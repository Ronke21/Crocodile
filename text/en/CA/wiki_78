<text>Stephen Cradock (born 22 August 1969) is an English guitarist, most notable for playing in the rock group Ocean Colour Scene. Cradock also plays the guitar in Paul Weller&#x27;s band, having appeared on all of Weller&#x27;s solo records following his self-titled debut solo album. Cradock began playing lead guitar for British ska band The Specials in 2014.

Cradock&#x27;s playing style has been described as having a &quot;distinctive retro sound&quot;. Cradock&#x27;s influences include The Beatles and The Rolling Stones. Cradock, also known as Fanny or Chopper, also plays keyboards, bass guitar and drums.

==Life and career==

===Early years===
Cradock was born in Solihull, West Midlands; his father Chris Cradock, a police officer, would later become his son&#x27;s manager. He was educated at Lode Heath School in Solihull.

Cradock formed his first band called The Boys in 1988, with schoolfriends from Solihull. The band played at various mod events around the Midlands with a set consisting mainly of cover songs. Whilst gaining popularity on the Birmingham gig circuit, the band was well received by audiences in various other towns, including London and Bournemouth, and the band released their first three-track EP, &quot;Happy Days&quot;, on their own label, and the band contributed to a compilation album by the London-based label Unicorn with their song &quot;Going Out&quot;. This was followed by the peak of the band&#x27;s career–a support slot for Steve Marriott at the Irish Centre in Digbeth.

In the late 1980s Cradock met his idol and future mentor, Paul Weller. Despite catching the attention of Polydor and CBS, the band dissolved and Cradock proceeded to form Ocean Colour Scene with Simon Fowler, Damon Minchella and Oscar Harrison.

===Ocean Colour Scene===
Cradock formed Ocean Colour Scene in 1989 with Fowler, Minchella and Harrison after the dissolution of both The Boys and The Fanatics. In 1991 Cradock returned to Weller&#x27;s London studio with Ocean Colour Scene; Cradock and Weller became friends and Ocean Colour Scene were soon invited to tour with Weller.
Within two years of being signed, the band released their debut LP, &quot;Ocean Colour Scene&quot;, on Fontana Records. Whilst they gained some popularity, the band felt their potential had not been reached. Following Cradock&#x27;s first full tour with Paul Weller, he self-funded the production of the band&#x27;s second LP &quot;Moseley Shoals&quot;.

OCS signed to MCA Records in 1995, and &quot; Moseley Shoals&quot; sold over 3,000,000 copies worldwide.

===Paul Weller===

Cradock joined Weller&#x27;s band in 1992, having supported him with Ocean Colour Scene. Cradock has appeared on all studio albums by Weller, playing the guitar and other instruments. For the album &quot;22 Dreams&quot;, Cradock co-wrote the tracks &quot;Night Lights&quot;, &quot;111&quot; and &quot;Song for Alice&quot;. In 1999, Weller presented Cradock with a Rickenbacker guitar for his 30th birthday. This guitar can be heard on Ocean Colour Scene&#x27;s &quot;Free My Name&quot; single from &quot;A Hyperactive Workout for the Flying Squad&quot;. Weller and Cradock still continue their musical partnership, joining forces whenever Weller takes to the road. Cradock is also credited with co-writing the track &quot;Drifters&quot; on the 2012 release &quot;Sonik Kicks&quot; – an album that reached no.1 in the UK albums chart. He also took to the stage with Weller to perform tracks from this album for five nights at London&#x27;s Roadhouse in March 2012. A version of Cradock&#x27;s &quot;Lay Down Your Weary Burden&quot; (from his 2011 album &quot;Peace City West&quot;) featured on Weller&#x27;s 2012 EP &quot;When Your Garden&#x27;s Overgrown&quot;.

==Solo career==

===&quot;The Kundalini Target&quot;===
Cradock announced on the Ocean Colour Scene website that he had begun work on a solo album in early 2008, the recording of which took place at Black Barn Studios in Surrey. During a phone interview on BBC Radio Tees in April 2008, Cradock discussed his solo album and disclosed that he plays all the instruments on the album. Occasionally, Cradock performed his own songs during his tour with Weller during their acoustic gigs of 2007 and 2008. The album features Paul Weller and wife Sally Cradock.

The album title was confirmed as &quot;The Kundalini Target&quot;; it reached No. 114 in the album charts, 34 in Play.com&#x27;s charts and 30 in iTunes&#x27; charts.

===&quot;Peace City West&quot;===
Cradock&#x27;s second solo album &quot;Peace City West&quot; was released on Kundalini Music (a label founded by Cradock and his wife) on 4 April 2011 and features collaborations with James Buckley, from the cult TV show &quot;The Inbetweeners&quot;, Paul Weller, Sally Cradock, Andy Crofts of The Moons and PP Arnold.

===&quot;Travel Wild – Travel Free&quot;===
This September 2013 release by Steve Cradock was his third solo effort, and also featured his wife Sally on co-production and co-writing.

===&quot;A Soundtrack to an Imaginary Movie&quot;===
Released in June 2022, Cradock began recording the first tracks in 2020 at his home studio. The instrumental album has jazz, folk, classical and film soundtrack influences. As well as contributions from Sally Cradock, the track Sarcoline features saxophone by the late Brian Travers of UB40.

==Personal life==
Cradock married Sally Edwards, a record promoter for Ocean Colour Scene, in 1996. The couple have two children.

<text>Herbert Kretzmer (5 October 192514 October 2020) was a South African-born English journalist and lyricist. He was best known as the lyricist for the English-language musical adaptation of &quot;Les Misérables&quot; and for his collaboration with French singer and songwriter Charles Aznavour.

==Early life==
Kretzmer was born in Kroonstad, South Africa on October 5, 1925. He was one of four sons of Lithuanian Jewish immigrants William and Tilly Kretzmer, who fled the pogroms of Tsarist Russia to settle in small-town South Africa early in the 20th century. His parents ran a furniture store. Kretzmer&#x27;s oldest brother, Elliot, flew as part of a bomber crew in the South African Air Force during the Second World War, eventually becoming the Mayor of Johannesburg in 1991. Kretzmer matriculated at Kroonstad High School and then attended Rhodes University.

==Journalist==

Kretzmer began his professional career writing documentary films and the commentary for a weekly cinema newsreel. However, he soon moved on to print journalism, initially as a reporter and feature writer for the &quot;Johannesburg Sunday Express&quot;. He subsequently relocated to London in 1954, and pursued twin careers as journalist and lyric writer.

After several years as a feature writer on the &quot;Daily Sketch&quot;, Kretzmer became a profile writer on the &quot;Sunday Dispatch&quot; in 1959 and the &quot;Daily Express&quot;, interviewing John Steinbeck, Truman Capote, Tennessee Williams, Sugar Ray Robinson, Louis Armstrong, Henry Miller, Cary Grant, and Duke Ellington. He became senior drama critic of the &quot;Daily Express&quot; in 1962. He held this post for 16 years, covering approximately 2,500 first nights during this time.

From 1979 to 1987, he wrote television criticism for the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, winning two national press awards, including TV Critic Of The Year in 1980.

==Lyricist==
Kretzmer wrote lyrics for the BBC&#x27;s 1960s televised satire &quot;That Was the Week That Was&quot;, including the racial satire &quot;Song of Nostalgia for an All-American State&quot; and the much-recorded tribute to John F. Kennedy, &quot;In the Summer of His Years&quot;, co-written by Kretzmer and performed by Millicent Martin within hours of his assassination.

Kretzmer won an Ivor Novello Award for the Peter Sellers and Sophia Loren comedy hit &quot;Goodness Gracious Me&quot;, co-composed with David Lee. Other award-winning Kretzmer lyrics include the English translation of &quot;Hier Encore&quot; into &quot;Yesterday When I Was Young&quot; (which was a major hit in North America for Roy Clark), and the chart-topping “She”, both written with and for the French singer Charles Aznavour.

Kretzmer wrote the lyrics for Anthony Newley&#x27;s musical film &quot;Can Hieronymus Merkin Ever Forget Mercy Humppe and Find True Happiness&quot;, whose score included &quot;When You Gotta Go&quot;, often used as a closing song by singers including Barbra Streisand.

Kretzmer wrote the book and lyrics of the West End musical, &quot;Our Man Crichton&quot;, composed by David Lee and based on J M Barrie&#x27;s satirical play &quot;The Admirable Crichton&quot;. The musical starred Kenneth More and Millicent Martin. Kretzmer later wrote (with composer Laurie Johnson) the lyrics for a large-scale comedy parody, &quot;The Four Musketeers&quot;, which ran for more than a year at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, starring Harry Secombe as the swordsman d&#x27;Artagnan.

Kretzmer&#x27;s songs for Aznavour and &quot;Our Man Crichton&quot; came to the attention of producer Cameron Mackintosh in 1984. The latter thought highly of the musical&#x27;s lyricism, and invited him to write an English version of a French musical &quot;Les Misérables&quot; (by Alain Boublil and Claude-Michel Schönberg). Kretzmer&#x27;s lyrics extended the two-hour Paris original into a three-hour show. The all-sung &quot;Les Mis&quot; opened at the Barbican Theatre on 8 October 1985 and is still running in the West End, the longest-running West End musical. The score includes such well-covered ballads as &quot;I Dreamed a Dream&quot;, &quot;Bring Him Home&quot;, &quot;On My Own&quot;, &quot;Master of the House&quot;, and &quot;Empty Chairs at Empty Tables&quot;. For his work on the &quot;Les Misérables&quot; lyrics, Kretzmer received Tony and Grammy awards. Kretzmer earned a total of approximately $20 million from &quot;Les Miserables&quot; royalties.

Kretzmer wrote the lyrics for &quot;Marguerite&quot; in 2008 from an original text by Alain Boublil. It was a musical set in Nazi-occupied Paris, to music by Michel Legrand. The show was part of a Jonathan Kent Season at the Haymarket Theatre before moving on to a season in Japan.  &quot;Marguerite&quot; was shortlisted in the Best Musical category in the Evening Standard Drama Awards 2008.

Kretzmer&#x27;s last musical project was &quot;Kristina&quot;, based on Vilhelm Moberg’s epic suite of novels about Swedish emigrants to Minnesota in the 19th century. The show, originally conceived and written by lyricist Björn Ulvaeus and composer Benny Andersson from ABBA, was presented and recorded in a concert version over two nights at Carnegie Hall, New York in September 2009.

==Honours==

Kretzmer was appointed a Chevalier of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres in 1988. He received the Jimmy Kennedy Award (a division of the Ivor Novello Awards) for services to songwriting. In 1996, he was elected an Honorary Doctor of Letters at Richmond College. Kretzmer received an Honorary Doctorate from Rhodes University in South Africa on 7 April 2011.

Kretzmer was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2011 New Year Honours for services to music.

He was nominated for Best Original Song at the 85th Academy Awards and the 70th Golden Globe Awards for the song &quot;Suddenly&quot; from the 2012 film version of &quot;Les Miserables&quot;.

==Personal life==

Kretzmer married Elisabeth Margaret Wilson in 1961; the couple had one son (Matthew) and one daughter (Danielle). They divorced in 1973. His second marriage was to Sybil Sever in 1988. Kretzmer was an atheist. 

Kretzmer suffered from Parkinson&#x27;s disease. He died on 14 October 2020, at his home in London, nine days after his 95th birthday.

<text>The Shard, also referred to as the Shard London Bridge and formerly London Bridge Tower, is a 72-storey mixed-use development supertall pyramid-shaped skyscraper, designed by the Italian architect Renzo Piano, in Southwark, London, that forms part of The Shard Quarter development. Standing high, The Shard is the tallest building in the United Kingdom, the seventh-tallest building in Europe, and the second-tallest outside Russia behind the Varso Tower in Warsaw, which beats the Shard by less than half a metre. The Shard replaced Southwark Towers, a 24-storey office block built on the site in 1975.

The Shard&#x27;s construction began in March 2009; it was topped out on 30 March 2012 and inaugurated on 5 July 2012. Practical completion was achieved in November 2012. The tower&#x27;s privately operated observation deck, The View from The Shard, was opened to the public on 1 February 2013. The glass-clad pyramidal tower has 72 habitable floors, with a viewing gallery and open-air observation deck on the 72nd floor, at a height of . The Shard was developed by Sellar Property Group on behalf of LBQ Ltd and is jointly owned by Sellar Property (5%) and the State of Qatar (95%).

==Background==

===Planning===
In 1998, London-based entrepreneur Irvine Sellar and his partners decided to redevelop the 1970s-era Southwark Towers following a UK government white paper encouraging the development of tall buildings at major transport hubs. Sellar flew to Berlin in the spring of 2000 to meet the Italian architect Renzo Piano for lunch. According to Sellar, Piano spoke of his contempt for conventional tall buildings during the meal, before flipping over the restaurant&#x27;s menu and sketching a spire-like sculpture emerging from the River Thames.

In July 2002, the Deputy Prime Minister, John Prescott, ordered a planning inquiry after the development plans for the Shard were opposed by the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment and several heritage bodies, including the Royal Parks Foundation and English Heritage. The inquiry took place in April and May 2003, and on 19 November 2003, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister announced that planning consent had been approved. The government stated that:


Sellar and his original partners CLS Holdings plc and CN Ltd (acting for the Halabi Family Trust) secured an interim funding package of £196 million in September 2006 from the Nationwide Building Society and Kaupthing Singer &amp; Friedlander. This enabled them to pay off the costs already incurred and to buy out the Southwark Towers occupational lease from the building&#x27;s tenants, PricewaterhouseCoopers. Vacant possession of the site was secured a year later, after PricewaterhouseCoopers completed the relocation of their operations.

In September 2007, preparations for the demolition of Southwark Towers began. However, later that same month, turbulence in the financial markets reportedly put the Shard&#x27;s construction in jeopardy, threatening to render the project an example of the Skyscraper Index.

In November 2007, building contractor Mace was awarded the contract to build the Shard for a fixed price of no more than £350 million. However, this price increased to almost £435 million in October 2008.

In April 2008, demolition of Southwark Towers was visibly under way, and by October, the building had been substantially reduced in height, and was no longer visible on the skyline. The demolition was completed in early 2009, and site preparation began for the construction of the Shard.

===Funding===
Towards the end of 2007, the gathering uncertainty in the global financial markets sparked concerns about the viability of the Shard. However, in January 2008, Sellar announced that it had secured funding from a consortium of Qatari investors, who had paid £150 million to secure an 80% stake in the project. The consortium included Qatar National Bank, QInvest, Qatari Islamic Bank and the Qatari property developer Barwa Real Estate, as well as Sellar Property. The deal involved a buyout of the Halabi and CLS Holdings stakes, and part of the Sellar Property stake. The new owners promised to provide the first tranche of finance, allowing construction of the tower to begin. In 2009, the State of Qatar consolidated its ownership of London Bridge Quarter (known now as Shard Quarter), including The Shard, through the purchase of the private Qatari investors&#x27; stakes. Shard Quarter is today jointly owned by the State of Qatar and Sellar.

==Architecture==
Renzo Piano, the project&#x27;s architect, designed The Shard as a spire-like sculpture emerging from the River Thames. He was inspired by the railway lines next to the site, the London spires depicted by the 18th-century Venetian painter Canaletto, and the masts of sailing ships. Piano&#x27;s design met criticism from English Heritage, who claimed the building would be &quot;a shard of glass through the heart of historic London&quot;, giving the building its name, The Shard. Piano considered the slender, spire-like form of the tower a positive addition to the London skyline, recalling the church steeples featured in historic engravings of the city, and believed that its presence would be far more delicate than opponents of the project alleged. He proposed a sophisticated use of glazing, with expressive façades of angled glass panes intended to reflect sunlight and the sky above, so that the appearance of the building would change according to the weather and seasons. The building features 11,000 panes of glass, with a total surface area of equivalent to the area of almost eight Wembley football pitches.

The Shard was designed with energy efficiency in mind. It is fitted with a combined heat and power (CHP) plant, operating on natural gas from the National Grid. Fuel is efficiently converted to electricity, and heat is recovered from the engine to provide hot water for the building.

Following the destruction of New York&#x27;s World Trade Center (WTC) in the terror attacks of 11 September 2001, architects and structural engineers worldwide began re-evaluating the design of tall structures. The Shard&#x27;s early conceptual designs were among the first in the UK to be amended following the publication of the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) report into the collapse of the WTC. The building is designed to maintain its stability under very onerous conditions, with its post-tensioned concrete and composite floors, load-bearing pillars, and tapering shape giving it a sway tolerance of .

In 2014, The Shard claimed first place at the Emporis Skyscraper Awards, recognising buildings over completed in the previous twelve months. The Emporis judges hailed the building as &quot;a skyscraper that is recognized immediately and which is already considered London&#x27;s new emblem&quot;.

===Layout===
==Construction==

For the construction of the skyscraper some path-breaking engineering methods were used, such as top-down construction, where foundations are dug while the core is built up – this was a first for the UK. In February 2009, a mobile crane and a small piling rig arrived on site. In early March 2009, the crane began putting steel beams into the ground, as part of preparations for the core of the building. Full construction began on 16 March 2009. Demolition work on New London Bridge House started in May 2009, as part of the concurrent London Bridge Place project. The first steelwork went into The Shard&#x27;s piles on 28 April. Five cranes were used to build The Shard, with four of them &#x27;jumping&#x27; with the tower as it rose. Crane 1 was erected in September 2009 and Crane 2 was erected at the beginning of October. By 20 October 2009, steel beams had begun appearing on site, with concrete being poured at the northern part of the site, ready for Crane 3.

By March 2010, the concrete core was rising steadily at about a day. After a pause in March–April 2010, it continued rising, reaching the 33rd floor in mid-June, almost level with the top of Guy&#x27;s Hospital, which stands at . On 27 July 2010, the core stopped rising, having reached the 38th floor, and was reconfigured for further construction. By mid-November 2010, the core had reached the 68th floor, with the tower&#x27;s steel reaching the 40th floor and glass cladding enveloping a third of the building. In late November, the core&#x27;s height exceeded , ending One Canada Square&#x27;s 18-year reign as Britain&#x27;s tallest building.

The Shard&#x27;s concrete core topped out at the 72nd floor in early 2011, standing at . The early part of January 2011 saw the installation of hydraulic screens, which were used to form the concrete floors of the hotel and apartment section of the tower, and rose with the floors up to the 69th floor. On 25 January 2011, the concrete pumps began pouring the first concrete floor at the 41st floor. By the end of February 2011, concrete flooring had risen to the 46th floor, with a new floor being poured on average every week. The cladding of the structure also progressed, mainly on the tower&#x27;s &quot;backpack&quot;. During this phase of construction, a fox was discovered living at the top of the unfinished skyscraper. The fox, named Romeo by staff, is thought to have entered the building through the central stairwell. It survived by eating scraps of food left by builders working on the incomplete structure. The fox was captured and taken to Riverside Animal Centre in Wallington.

August 2011 saw steady progress in construction, with cladding enveloping more than half the building&#x27;s exterior. Pouring of the concrete floors reached the 67th floor, and progression on the tower&#x27;s cladding reached the 58th floor. By mid-August, the core box had been removed. By 19 September 2011, the tower&#x27;s steel was approaching the height of the completed core, reaching almost . On 24 September, a final crane – at the time, the tallest ever built in Britain – was erected to install the skyscraper&#x27;s upper spire. The spire was pre-fabricated and pre-assembled based upon 3D models, and underwent a &quot;test run&quot; in Yorkshire before being lifted onto the building itself. By late December 2011, The Shard had become the tallest building in the European Union, superseding the Commerzbank Tower in Frankfurt, Germany.

The Shard&#x27;s steel structure was topped out on 30 March 2012, when its , 500-tonne spire was winched into place. The steel structure thus reached a height of . The final 516 panes of glass were added shortly after, topping the tower out at its full height of .

The Shard was inaugurated on 5 July 2012 by the Prime Minister of Qatar, Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani, in a ceremony attended by Prince Andrew, Duke of York. Practical completion of the building was achieved in November 2012.

==Height==

Standing at its highest point, and at the highest point of its steelwork, The Shard became the tallest building in the European Union in December 2011, and the tallest completed building in Europe on 30 March 2012. It is taller than Frankfurt&#x27;s Commerzbank Tower at the record holder between 1997 and 2005 and three later skyscrapers of Moscow: the Triumph-Palace, Naberezhnaya Tower, and City of Capitals. These three had each held the title for roughly years. The Shard was overtaken by a fourth such tower in November 2012: the Mercury City Tower. The Shard was surpassed as the tallest European building outside Russia by the 310-metre (1,017 ft) Varso Tower, Warsaw, Poland in February 2021.

The Shard is the second-tallest free-standing structure in the United Kingdom, after the concrete transmission tower at Emley Moor. Another planned London skyscraper, the Pinnacle (now replaced by 22 Bishopsgate), was originally proposed to rival the height of The Shard, but was reduced to a height of because of concerns from the Civil Aviation Authority. It is taller than all of the natural peaks in London and in adjoining counties, the highest of which is Walbury Hill, close to Wiltshire.

==Initial tenants==
The Shard comprises a 26-floor office complex, occupied by 32 companies across 10 business sectors, 3 restaurants—Aqua Shard, Oblix, and Hutong—the five-star Shangri-La The Shard, London hotel, 10 residential apartments, and the UK&#x27;s highest viewing gallery, The View from The Shard.

In February 2013, &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; reported that the developers of The Shard were in negotiations to secure the first tenants of the building&#x27;s 26 floors of office space. At the time, potential tenants included financial restructuring specialists Duff &amp; Phelps, private equity firm Hatton Corporation, and the South Hook Liquefied Natural Gas Company.

The Shard&#x27;s fourth, fifth, and sixth floors host the HCA (Hospital Corporations of America), part of London Bridge Hospital. The Shard&#x27;s 31st, 32nd, and 33rd floors host three restaurants: Oblix, Hutong, and Aqua Shard. The building&#x27;s Shangri-La Hotel occupies floors 34–52. The hotel was initially expected to open by the end of 2013, but its opening was ultimately delayed to 6 May 2014. In March 2014, Mathys &amp; Squire became the first law firm to take tenancy in the building. In May 2014, the Foresight Group, an investment firm, moved its head UK office into The Shard on the 17th floor. In June 2015, Warwick Business School opened its new base in The Shard, occupying the same floor and was officially opened by the mayor of London, Boris Johnson. It houses a 100-seat lecture theatre and a smaller one at 60 seats, plus 8 seminar rooms and an IT lab, offering postgraduate and executive education.

In July 2013, the Qatari broadcaster Al Jazeera Media Network announced that it would open a new television studio and newsroom for Al Jazeera English in The Shard. Al Jazeera moved in on 13 September 2014; its first live broadcast from the building was on 10 November 2014. The facility currently houses all primary operations for Al Jazeera Media Network&#x27;s channels in London; it is capable of running an entire channel independent from Al Jazeera&#x27;s other hubs, and is the network&#x27;s second-biggest hub after its facility in Doha, Qatar.

In January 2015, further tenants for The Shard were announced, including IO Oil &amp; Gas Consulting, Gallup, and The Office Group. In May 2015, the American recruitment consultancy Robert Half International announced that it would move several branches of its business into The Shard, having purchased of floor space on the tower&#x27;s tenth floor. In August 2015, the international law firm Greenberg Traurig announced that it would open its offices on the eighth floor of The Shard by the end of the year.

Matches Fashion took over 35,000 sq ft in January 2016, and six months later expanded its headquarter&#x27;s presence in The Shard by 40%. In March 2016, marketing agency Jellyfish signed a lease for of office space on the 22nd floor, with occupancy beginning later in the year. A month later, publishing house Dods Group let almost on Level 11, becoming The Shard&#x27;s 28th office occupier. In December, Kraft Heinz relocated their European and UK headquarters from Hayes in Hillingdon to The Shard after taking on Levels 20 &amp; 21.

The Shard offices were announced as fully let in October 2017, following lettings to Mitie and existing occupiers, Foresight Group, and Warwick Business School.

==Urban exploration, BASE jumping, and climbing==
In December 2011, a group of recreational explorers calling themselves the Place Hackers evaded security and made their way to the top of the Shard building site, climbing one of the tallest cranes in the process. They later posted photographs of the London skyline taken from the top of the Shard on the Internet and received wide media attention. One member of the group, Oxford University researcher Bradley Garrett, later revealed to various news outlets that over 20 urban explorers had made their way to the top of the building during its construction. In a 2012 article for &quot;Domus&quot; magazine, Garrett wrote that &quot;the conceptual barrier to places in our cities is brought about by a process of engineered exclusion&quot; and that the explorers were &quot;cultivating the creative city that money can&#x27;t buy&quot;.

BASE jumpers reportedly jumped from The Shard over ten times between 2009 and 2012. Four jumps were reportedly made by Dan Witchalls, who had filmed one attempt. The highest jump was said to have been from a height of . In March 2016 another person BASE jumped from The Shard.

On 3 September 2012, a team of 40 people, including Prince Andrew, Duke of York, abseiled from the tower&#x27;s 87th floor. This feat was performed to raise money for the Outward Bound Trust and the Royal Marines Charitable Trust Fund. In November 2012, the French urban climber Alain Robert was spotted in the building by security guards. At the end of the month, the Shard&#x27;s owners won an injunction to prevent him from entering or climbing the building.

On 11 July 2013, six Greenpeace volunteers climbed the Shard and unfurled a flag in protest against Arctic oil drilling by Royal Dutch Shell. The protestors announced they were &quot;experienced climbers&quot;, but medical personnel were summoned to the base of the tower nonetheless. The Shard&#x27;s staff closed the tower&#x27;s observatory and gave them a safety briefing and other advice during their climb. After completing their 16-hour climb, the protestors were arrested by police on suspicion of aggravated trespass.

<text>Nigel Gray Leakey VC (1 January 1913 – 19 May 1941) was a British soldier and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
Leakey was born in Kiganjo, Kenya to English parents. Leakey&#x27;s mother Elizabeth died in 1926. His father, Arundell Gray Leakey, was the son of Reverend John Arundell Leakey, clergyman in England. He was a cousin of archaeologists Louis Leakey and Richard Leakey. Leakey&#x27;s younger brother Rea Leakey served in the Royal Tank Regiment in the Second World War, and later became a major general. His sister Agnes Leakey (later Agnes Hofmeyr) worked for black and white reconciliation in Kenya.

After serving in the Duke of Cornwall&#x27;s Light Infantry in the early 1900s, Leakey&#x27;s father became a farmer at Nyeri Station, west of Mount Kenya in Central Province, Kenya, about north of Kiganjo and about north of Nairobi. His father was an honorary Kikuyu tribesman known as &quot;Morungaru&quot; (&quot;tall and straight&quot;); he was kidnapped and brutally murdered by the Mau Mau in October 1954, and his second wife Mary was also killed.

Leakey was educated in Kenya, and then attended Bromsgrove School in England. Returning to Kenya, at the outbreak of war in 1939 he joined the Kenya Regiment and, after training, was attached to the King&#x27;s African Rifles.

==Victoria Cross==

Leakey was a 28 years old sergeant in the 1/6th Battalion, King&#x27;s African Rifles during the Second World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross. Leakey&#x27;s 1/6th Battalion was part of the 22nd (East African) Brigade (12th African Division).

On 19 May 1941, at Alaba Kulito, Abyssinia, when Allied forces had made a bridgehead against strong Italian opposition, the Italians made a sudden counterattack with both light and medium tanks. In the face of withering fire, Leakey leaped on top of an Italian tank, wrenched open the turret and killed all the crew except the driver, whom he forced to drive the tank to cover. Along with three others, Leakey tried to repeat this with another Italian tank, but just as he opened the turret, he was killed. The confusion and loss of armour Leakey caused was critical to the Italian defeat in the battle. Captain David Hines witnessed the event through binoculars, as did other soldiers.

Leakey has no known grave but he is commemorated on the East Africa Memorial, near Nairobi, Kenya.

His second cousin twice removed, Joshua Leakey, was also awarded the Victoria Cross for his service in Afghanistan in 2013.

Leakey&#x27;s medal is kept by a member of the Leakey family in England.

<text>In harmonic analysis and number theory, an automorphic form is a well-behaved function from a topological group &quot;G&quot; to the complex numbers (or complex vector space) which is invariant under the action of a discrete subgroup formula_1 of the topological group. Automorphic forms are a generalization of the idea of periodic functions in Euclidean space to general topological groups.

Modular forms are holomorphic automorphic forms defined over the groups SL(2, [[Automorphic form|R]]) or PSL(2, [[Automorphic form|R]]) with the discrete subgroup being the modular group, or one of its congruence subgroups; in this sense the theory of automorphic forms is an extension of the theory of modular forms. More generally, one can use the adelic approach as a way of dealing with the whole family of congruence subgroups at once. From this point of view, an automorphic form over the group &quot;G&quot;(A&quot;F&quot;), for an algebraic group &quot;G&quot; and an algebraic number field &quot;F&quot;, is a complex-valued function on &quot;G&quot;(A&quot;F&quot;) that is left invariant under &quot;G&quot;(&quot;F&quot;) and satisfies certain smoothness and growth conditions.

Henri Poincaré first discovered automorphic forms as generalizations of trigonometric and elliptic functions. Through the Langlands conjectures, automorphic forms play an important role in modern number theory.

==Definition==

In mathematics, the notion of factor of automorphy arises for a group acting on a complex-analytic manifold. Suppose a group formula_2 acts on a complex-analytic manifold formula_3. Then, formula_2 also acts on the space of holomorphic functions from formula_3 to the complex numbers. A function formula_6 is termed an &quot;automorphic form&quot; if the following holds:

: formula_7

where formula_8 is an everywhere nonzero holomorphic function. Equivalently, an automorphic form is a function whose divisor is invariant under the action of formula_2.

The &quot;factor of automorphy&quot; for the automorphic form formula_6 is the function formula_11. An &quot;automorphic function&quot; is an automorphic form for which formula_11 is the identity.

An automorphic form is a function &quot;F&quot; on &quot;G&quot; (with values in some fixed finite-dimensional vector space &quot;V&quot;, in the vector-valued case), subject to three kinds of conditions:

# to transform under translation by elements formula_13 according to the given factor of automorphy &quot;j&quot;;
# to be an eigenfunction of certain Casimir operators on &quot;G&quot;; and
# to satisfy a &quot;moderate growth&quot; asymptotic condition a height function.

It is the first of these that makes &quot;F&quot; &quot;automorphic&quot;, that is, satisfy an interesting functional equation relating &quot;F&quot;(&quot;g&quot;) with &quot;F&quot;(&quot;γg&quot;) for formula_13. In the vector-valued case the specification can involve a finite-dimensional group representation ρ acting on the components to &#x27;twist&#x27; them. The Casimir operator condition says that some Laplacians have &quot;F&quot; as eigenfunction; this ensures that &quot;F&quot; has excellent analytic properties, but whether it is actually a complex-analytic function depends on the particular case. The third condition is to handle the case where &quot;G&quot;/Γ is not compact but has cusps.

The formulation requires the general notion of &quot;factor of automorphy&quot; &quot;j&quot; for Γ, which is a type of 1-cocycle in the language of group cohomology. The values of &quot;j&quot; may be complex numbers, or in fact complex square matrices, corresponding to the possibility of vector-valued automorphic forms. The cocycle condition imposed on the factor of automorphy is something that can be routinely checked, when &quot;j&quot; is derived from a Jacobian matrix, by means of the chain rule.

A more straightforward but technically advanced definition using class field theory, constructs automorphic forms and their correspondent functions as embeddings of Galois groups to their underlying global field extensions. In this formulation, automorphic forms are certain finite invariants, mapping from the idele class group under the Artin reciprocity law. Herein, the analytical structure of its L-function allows for generalizations with various algebro-geometric properties; and the resultant Langlands program. To oversimplify, automorphic forms in this general perspective, are analytic functionals quantifying the invariance of number fields in a most abstract sense, therefore indicating the &#x27;primitivity&#x27; of their fundamental structure. Allowing a powerful mathematical tool for analyzing the invariant constructs of virtually any numerical structure.

Examples of automorphic forms in an explicit unabstracted state are difficult to obtain, though some have directly analytical properties:

- The Eisenstein series (which is a prototypical modular form) over certain field extensions as Abelian groups.

- Specific generalizations of Dirichlet L-functions as class field-theoretic objects.

- Generally any harmonic analytic object as a functor over Galois groups which is invariant on its ideal class group (or idele).

As a general principle, automorphic forms can be thought of as analytic functions on abstract structures, which are invariant with respect to a generalized analogue of their prime ideal (or an abstracted irreducible fundamental representation). As mentioned, automorphic functions can be seen as generalizations of modular forms (as therefore elliptic curves), constructed by some zeta function analogue on an automorphic structure. In the simplest sense, automorphic forms are modular forms defined on general Lie groups; because of their symmetry properties. Therefore, in simpler terms, a general function which analyzes the invariance of a structure with respect to its prime &#x27;morphology&#x27;.

==History==
Before this very general setting was proposed (around 1960), there had already been substantial developments of automorphic forms other than modular forms. The case of Γ a Fuchsian group had already received attention before 1900 (see below). The Hilbert modular forms (also called Hilbert-Blumenthal forms) were proposed not long after that, though a full theory was long in coming. The Siegel modular forms, for which &quot;G&quot; is a symplectic group, arose naturally from considering moduli spaces and theta functions. The post-war interest in several complex variables made it natural to pursue the idea of automorphic form in the cases where the forms are indeed complex-analytic. Much work was done, in particular by Ilya Piatetski-Shapiro, in the years around 1960, in creating such a theory. The theory of the Selberg trace formula, as applied by others, showed the considerable depth of the theory. Robert Langlands showed how (in generality, many particular cases being known) the Riemann–Roch theorem could be applied to the calculation of dimensions of automorphic forms; this is a kind of &quot;post hoc&quot; check on the validity of the notion. He also produced the general theory of Eisenstein series, which corresponds to what in spectral theory terms would be the &#x27;continuous spectrum&#x27; for this problem, leaving the cusp form or discrete part to investigate. From the point of view of number theory, the cusp forms had been recognised, since Srinivasa Ramanujan, as the heart of the matter.

==Automorphic representations==

The subsequent notion of an &quot;automorphic representation&quot; has proved of great technical value when dealing with &quot;G&quot; an algebraic group, treated as an adelic algebraic group. It does not completely include the automorphic form idea introduced above, in that the adelic approach is a way of dealing with the whole family of congruence subgroups at once. Inside an &quot;L&quot;2 space for a quotient of the adelic form of &quot;G&quot;, an automorphic representation is a representation that is an infinite tensor product of representations of p-adic groups, with specific enveloping algebra representations for the infinite prime(s). One way to express the shift in emphasis is that the Hecke operators are here in effect put on the same level as the Casimir operators; which is natural from the point of view of functional analysis, though not so obviously for the number theory. It is this concept that is basic to the formulation of the Langlands philosophy.

==Poincaré on discovery and his work on automorphic functions==
One of Poincaré&#x27;s first discoveries in mathematics, dating to the 1880s, was automorphic forms. He named them Fuchsian functions, after the mathematician Lazarus Fuchs, because Fuchs was known for being a good teacher and had researched on differential equations and the theory of functions. Poincaré actually developed the concept of these functions as part of his doctoral thesis. Under Poincaré&#x27;s definition, an automorphic function is one which is analytic in its domain and is invariant under a discrete infinite group of linear fractional transformations. Automorphic functions then generalize both trigonometric and elliptic functions.

Poincaré explains how he discovered Fuchsian functions:

<text>Leonard Clemence &quot;Leo&quot; Tindemans (; 16 April 1922 – 26 December 2014) was a Belgian politician. He served as the prime minister of Belgium from 25 April 1974 until he resigned as minister on 20 October 1978. He was a member of the Christian Democratic and Flemish party.

==Early life==
Tindemans was born in Zwijndrecht, Belgium, to a Catholic family.

==Political career==

===Early career===
Tindemans was affiliated with the CVP. At the time, the party was strong in the northern region of Flanders. Tindemans was elected to the Belgian Chamber of Representatives in 1961 and re-elected in 1965, 1968, 1971, 1974, 1977 and 1978. From 1965 to 1973 Tindemans also served as the mayor of Edegem.

In 1968 Tindemans became minister tasked with the relations between the communities (1968–1972) during which he prepared the first constitutional reform which saw Belgium start transforming into a federal state. In 1972 he became minister for agriculture (1972–1973). In 1973 he became deputy Prime Minister and minister for the budget (1973–1974).

===Prime Minister (1974–1978)===
Tindemans served as Prime Minister of two Belgian governments, from 25 April 1974 to 20 October 1978. His first cabinet was a minority government formed by the Christian-democrats and liberals. When his first government fell in 1977, Tindemans won the snap general election with 983,000 votes, still a record for any election in Belgium. This formed his second cabinet with the Christian-democrats, socialists and Flemish nationalists. His second government (1977–1978) fell due to the controversy surrounding the Egmont pact.

He was awarded the Charlemagne Prize 1976.

===Tindemans Report===
At the conclusion of the Paris Summit in 1974, Tindemans was tasked with devising a report to define what was meant by the term &#x27;European Union.&#x27; Consulting not only reports drawn up by the European Parliament, European Commission and the European Court of Justice, Tindemans also sought advice from members of European governments and &quot;other powerful forces in the various States&quot;. Tindemans deliberately sought to avoid using the term constitution, and instead referred to his proposals as &quot;a new phase in the history of the unification of Europe which can only be achieved by a continuous process&quot;. Four major areas were outlined in the report: European foreign policy, European economic and social policies, European citizen rights, and the strengthening of existing European institutions.

In regards to a common foreign policy, Tindemans argues that Europe must present itself united outward not only in security, tariffs and trade, but also in an economic sense. He advocated for the creation of a single decision-making centre to handle these issues, and making foreign policy cooperation between member states a legal obligation – Tindemans felt that this role largely would lie within a strengthened Council. He argued for placing the interest of joint action above each country&#x27;s own interests, and advocated for placing a delegate responsible for representing a collective Europe&#x27;s decisions. In addition, Tindemans placed particular emphasis on strengthening Europe-United States relations, proposing that a delegate be assigned to represent European Union to the United States. Lastly on the foreign policy front, Tindemans advocated for the eventual creation of a common defense policy.

On the economic and social policy front, Tindemans advocated for reigniting discussions about a common economic and monetary policy, which had stalled in Europe during the early 1970s recession. As part of this revival of talks, he also advocated for the consolidation and modification of the snake. He proposed expanding the scope of monetary policy by establishing an internal monetary policy, budgetary policy, and plans for the control of inflation. Tindemans supported abolishing the remaining obstacles to free trade of capital that existed within the European Economic Community. Finally, Tindemans hoped for a citizen&#x27;s Europe; he advocated for European civil rights, consumer rights, and protection of the environment. He also pushed for a European passport union, and creation of integrated educational systems. Finally, Tindemans encouraged broad institutional reform, pushing for increased powers to the European Parliament, and overall reform for the European Council, the Council of Ministers, and the European Commission.

Due to economic conditions at the time, the Tindemans report failed to make an immediate impact. Despite this the report generated a request from the Council of Foreign Ministers and the commission to create an annual progress report on the European Union. In addition, though quite optimistic and federalist in scope, several items which Tindemans advocated for eventually found themselves in the European Union, such as a common economic and foreign policy, as well as symbols for the European Union.

===Transnational networks===

In the 1970s he was a regular Le Cercle participant (Johannes Grossmann, Die Internationale der Konservativen, München 2014, p. 473).

He participated in at least one Bilderberg Conference in Aachen in 1980. He appears on the provisional list of participants for the 1967 Bilderberg Conference which means that he was invited and accepted the invitation. He either cancelled in the last minute or was omitted from the official list of participants.

==Later career==

In 1976, during the founding Congress of the European People&#x27;s Party in Brussels, he was elected first President of the new party, a role which gave him the important tasks of harmonising and finding consensus between the different leaders and member parties of the EPP and of leading the party during the first direct elections to the European Parliament in 1979.

Tindemans received an Honorary Doctorate from Heriot-Watt University in 1978.

Tindemans was elected to the European Parliament with a record number of votes (983.000 votes, which is still a record for any election in Belgium) and was a member of that parliament from 1979 to 1981 (during which time he also was chairman of the CVP). With the general elections of 1981 Tindemans returned to the Belgian politics and became minister of foreign affairs (1981–1989). With the European elections in 1989 Tindemans went back to the European Parliament where he served two terms until he retired in 1999. During 1994–1995 he was chairman of the Tindemans group.

==Death==
Tindemans died on 26 December 2014 in Edegem, Antwerp, Belgium, aged 92.

<text>The Jari project was an attempt to create a tropical tree farm in Brazil for producing pulp for paper.

==Background==
The Jari project was a brainchild of US entrepreneur and billionaire Daniel K. Ludwig. In the 1950s he noticed that demand for paper was rising. Since the forests of the temperate zone were already in use, the supply of the wood pulp for paper was fixed. Ludwig foresaw a future increase in the price of paper due to the increase of mass media. Since most of the natural forest timber was not suitable for paper production, Ludwig planned a site where the natural forest would be replaced by a tree farm. It would have to be started decades ahead to supply the future paper production.

==History==
===Growth===
Ludwig selected the fast-growing tropical tree &quot;Gmelina arborea&quot; for his tree farm. At first he considered locating his tree farm in Costa Rica but the Brazilian military government encouraged him to settle on the lower reaches of the Rio Jari, a tributary of the Amazon River. In 1967, Ludwig bought 1.6 million acres (6,475 km2) for $3 million.

Ludwig controlled the project mainly from the United States. He built a settlement, Monte Dourado, with houses, schools, the only hospital in the area, bakery, supermarket, nurseries, bridges and community buildings. He also built roads and railways. The clearing of the land using heavy bulldozers damaged the topsoil the trees were to be planted in. It became necessary to employ local workers instead for land clearing. Removing the forest cover allowed sunshine to harden the lateritic soil. Gmelina turned out to grow crooked stems, which were very hard to load onto trucks. Also, the new trees were damaged by the numerous insects living in the area of the Amazon. Pinus radiata was planted on the sandier river-bottom soils.

Other settlements, the &quot;free cities&quot; of Beiradão and Beiradinho, grew up across the river to provide services not contemplated by the American planners. In its heyday, the Jari Project had 35,000 workers.

Ludwig had also commissioned two large ship-shaped platforms that were built in Japan and floated to the Jari Project. One barge module contained the pulping sector of the pulp mill. This module housed the digesting, the brown stock, the bleach plant, and the pulp machine. The second module housed the recovery boiler, the evaporators and the recaust. The pulp mill barge was finished in 1978 and launched on 1 February. It traveled through the Indian Ocean and around the Cape of Good Hope, arriving at the Brazilian city of Munguba on 28 April. The power group module arrived four days later. Both barges were floated into specially built locks. Hundreds of gum wood piles had been driven into the ground to support the two barges. By closing the locks and pumping the water out, the barges gently settled on the many piles.

It was found that the growth rate of the Gmelina wood was much lower than that predicted and anticipated. To satisfy the demand of the pulp mill production it became necessary to purchase other species of wood from other Brazilian sources. Beginning in 1981 the foresters planted Eucalyptus as they harvested the Gmelina. Eucalyptus tested well for pulping, grew quite well and reduced the demand on purchased wood from other sources.

===Diversification===
Another of Ludwig&#x27;s ideas was to grow all the food needed, including rice to feed the workers, which did not turn out well either. Rice growing required large amount of pesticides to keep insects at bay and the soil did not have enough sulfur for rice. Ludwig corrected the situation with the application of ammonium sulfate. He included cattle farming to feed on the grass that grew among the pine trees. 
He also discovered a very large source of kaolin. The mining of kaolin on the Jari river is still a large-scale commercial operation. Kaolin is exported to numerous countries in Asia and Europe for coating fine paper.

===Decline===
Problems also began to increase because of the so-called Amazon Factor - the combined effects of soil, insects, humidity and tropical disease. It was very hard to keep engineers for the pulp mill, as there was little entertainment for their wives. Newly planted trees required manual weeding for a few years, which meant importing many field laborers from the poverty-stricken Northwest of Brazil. Workers contracted malaria. Insects devoured the harvest and supplies.

Then Brazilian government officials began to criticize Ludwig&#x27;s methods and the extent of his land ownership. They also questioned the project&#x27;s exemption from taxes, not to mention his methods - he had fired twenty-nine directors during the thirteen years of the project and preferred to decide everything essential by himself.

Ludwig gave up in May 1981. The next year he turned the Jari project over to a consortium of Brazilian businessmen. He did not receive any money but the several hundreds of millions of dollars of debt were transferred to new owners. Ludwig was to receive a gradually diminishing cut of the possible profits until the year 2026. The new owners demanded - as Ludwig had - investment in the local infrastructure.

The remains of the project remain in Brazilian hands in the form of the Jarcel Cellulose company. Ownership is in the hands of Brazilian banks and holding companies.

<doc id="782157" wikidata="Q2215201" url="?curid=782157" title="Salon Kitty">
<text>Salon Kitty was a high-class Berlin brothel used by the Nazi intelligence service, the &quot;Sicherheitsdienst&quot; (SD), for espionage purposes during .

Created in the early 1930s by Katharina &quot;Kitty&quot; Schmidt, the salon was taken over by Nazi secret service and senior SS officer Reinhard Heydrich and operated by his subordinate Walter Schellenberg in 1939. The brothel was overtly managed by original owner Kitty Schmidt throughout its existence. The plan was to seduce top German dignitaries and foreign visitors, as well as diplomats, with alcohol and women so they would disclose secrets or express their honest opinions on Nazi-related topics and individuals. Guests included Heydrich himself, Joseph Dietrich, Galeazzo Ciano and Joseph Goebbels. The salon had to relocate after an air raid in 1942, but eventually, as the war progressed, the project lost its importance due to the decreased number of clientele.

Salon Kitty has been the inspiration or subject of brothels featured in films involving Nazi espionage.

==History==
In the 1930s, &quot;Salon Kitty&quot; was a high-class brothel at 11 Giesebrechtstrasse in Charlottenburg, a wealthy district of Berlin. Its usual clientele included German dignitaries, foreign diplomats, top industrialists, high-ranking civil servants and senior Nazi Party members. Its madame was Katharina Zammit, better known as Kitty Schmidt, who ran the brothel from its inception.

Schmidt had secretly been sending money to British banks with fleeing refugees ever since the Nazis took power in Germany in January 1933. When she eventually tried to leave the country on 28 June 1939, &quot;Sicherheitsdienst&quot; (SD) agents arrested her at the Dutch border and took her to Gestapo headquarters. Once there she was seen by Walter Schellenberg, who at that time worked in the counter-intelligence department of the SD. He gave her an ultimatum: cooperate with the Nazis or be sent to a concentration camp.

Using Salon Kitty for espionage purposes was an idea of Reinhard Heydrich, a leading SS general and police chief within Nazi Germany. Instead of infiltrating the brothel, Schellenberg took it over altogether. The idea was to entertain prominent guests with wine and women, so they would disclose secrets or talk about their real opinions to ensure their support could be relied upon. The nine rooms of the salon were lavishly expanded and renovated to the highest standards of the 1930s. Schellenberg installed covert listening devices in the rooms and converted the basement into a &quot;workshop&quot; where five operators could make transcriptions of conversations from the love-making rooms.

For the purpose of espionage, the SS started looking for young women to work in the brothel. In a circular deemed &quot;top secret&quot;, Schellenberg asked administrative offices in Berlin for assistance. The requirement profile read: &quot;Wanted are women and girls, who are intelligent, multilingual, nationalistically minded and furthermore man-crazy&quot; (&quot;Gesucht werden Frauen und Mädchen, die intelligent, mehrsprachig, nationalistisch gesinnt und ferner mannstoll sind.&quot;). Berlin&#x27;s &quot;Sittenpolizei&quot; (&quot;vice squad&quot;) arrested dozens of Berlin prostitutes and selected the most attractive as potential agents to work at Salon Kitty. Among other things, they were trained to recognise military uniforms and to glean secrets from innocuous conversation. They were not told about the microphones, but had to make a report after every encounter. The ladies all had their particular attractions and had been trained to satisfy even the discerning customers. Historian Paul Roland further notes that among the women who entertained members of the Nazi elite were respected ladies of Berlin&#x27;s high society who were given no allowances for their &quot;contributions&quot; and were nearly all married to men of good financial means.

In March 1940, Schmidt was told to continue business as if nothing had happened, except now she had a special book of twenty additional girls she should only show to certain clients. If a customer used the phrase &quot;I come from Rothenburg&quot;, she was instructed to show him the book, allow him to make his decision and call for the girl he had selected. The girl would then spend the night with the guest and depart later.

===Notable guests===

Salon Kitty became even more popular when selected guests in the military and diplomatic corps were told the &quot;secret codeword&quot; and monitors made thousands of recordings during their visits. One of the customers was Galeazzo Ciano, son-in-law of Italian dictator Benito Mussolini and Foreign Minister of Fascist Italy, whose forthright opinions about the Führer were not particularly positive. Another visitor, SS General Sepp Dietrich, wanted all the 20 special girls for an all-night orgy, but he revealed no secrets. Additionally, propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels has been marked as a client; he enjoyed &quot;lesbian displays&quot; that were otherwise considered anti-social acts outside of that context. Heydrich also made a number of &quot;inspection tours&quot;, although the microphones were turned off on those occasions.

British agent Roger Wilson, under his cover identity as Romanian press secretary &quot;Ljubo Kolchev&quot;, noticed the microphone wires while there. He became a frequent customer of the salon with a regular girl and later arranged a wiretap to three cables. After that, British intelligence heard some of the same conversations as the SD.

===Air raid and closing===
As the war progressed, the clientele of Salon Kitty decreased. In July 1942, the building was demolished during a British air attack and the brothel had to be relocated. Within the year the SD decided to abandon the project, also due to Schellenberg no longer having to report to anyone on the issue after the assassination of Heydrich by the Czechoslovak resistance in May 1942. The salon was handed back to Schmidt, with the threat that she should keep silent or face retaliation.

Madame Schmidt did not talk about the matter even after the war. She died in 1954, at the age of 71, without revealing the identity of any of her former employees. The number of Gestapo recordings from the brothel was estimated by the Stasi (East German Security Service) to be about 25,000. Virtually all of the recordings have since been lost or destroyed due to their post-war unimportance. According to a 2005 article in &quot;Die Tageszeitung&quot;, the brothel continued to exist after World War II under the management of Schmidt&#x27;s son and daughter. In the 1990s, it was turned into a home for asylum-seekers, which was closed soon after because of local protest against the residents.

==Media==

The story of what happened at Salon Kitty first came to light in Walter Schellenberg&#x27;s memoirs, published in Germany in 1956 under the title &quot;The Labyrinth&quot;. Peter Norden later expanded the story in his 1973 book &quot;Madam Kitty&quot;. This book became the basis for the highly controversial 1976 film &quot;Salon Kitty&quot;, directed by Tinto Brass and starring Helmut Berger as Walter Schellenberg (renamed Helmut Wallenberg) and Ingrid Thulin as Kitty Schmidt (renamed Kitty Kellermann).

The 1981 BBC comedy drama &quot;Private Schulz&quot;, about a German fraudster and petty criminal&#x27;s unwilling World War II service in the SS, prominently features the salon. In the first episode, Schultz is given the job of staffing the listening post in the brothel&#x27;s basement and recording the conversations picked up by the hidden microphones.

The concept of the Gestapo using a brothel full of spies to find traitors within the Nazi regime has been recycled several times in various European Nazi exploitation films.

<text>Josephine Myrtle Corbin (May 12, 1868 – May 6, 1928) was an American sideshow performer born as a dipygus. This referred to the fact that she had two separate pelvises side by side from the waist down, as a result of her body axis splitting as it developed. Each of her smaller inner legs was paired with one of her outer legs. She was said to be able to move her inner legs, but they were too weak for walking.

==Early life and family==
Corbin was born in Lincoln County, Tennessee. Corbin&#x27;s parents were William H. Corbin, aged 25 at the time of his daughter&#x27;s birth, and Nancy Corbin (née Sullins), aged 34. Both parents were described by physicians who examined the infant shortly after her birth as being very similar in appearance, &quot;both having auburn hair, blue eyes, and very fair complexion&quot;; in fact, they looked so similar that the physicians felt compelled to point out that they were not &quot;blood kin&quot;. The Corbins had four children in total, including a child from Nancy&#x27;s first marriage.

Myrtle&#x27;s birth was not marked by anything &quot;peculiar about the labour or delivery&quot; according to her mother. Doctors who examined the child shortly after her birth noted that a breech presentation &quot;would have proved fatal to the infant, and possibly to the mother.&quot; Corbin soon showed herself to be a strong child, weighing three weeks after the birth, and it was reported in a journal published later that year that she &quot;nurses healthily&quot; and was &quot;thriving well&quot;.

==Career==
Corbin entered the sideshow circuit with the moniker &quot;Four-Legged Girl from Texas&quot; when she was 13 years old; one of her first promotional pamphlets described her as being as &quot;gentle of disposition as the summer sunshine and as happy as the day is long.&quot; Her popularity in this industry was such that other showmen turned to exhibiting four-legged gaffs (falsified performances). When Corbin herself was no longer performing, there were several phony four-legged women to whom audiences could turn.

==Presence in medical literature==
Teratologists in medical journals and encyclopedias in the 19th century classified Corbin&#x27;s anomaly using several different, yet equally complex, terms, according to conventions of the time. Some referred to her as a &quot;dipygus dibrachius tetrapus&quot;, others named her condition posterior dichotomy,&#x27; subvariety schizorachis&quot;. One doctor, Brooks H. Wells, described her as &quot;female, belonging to the monocephalic, ileadelphic class of monsters by fusion.&quot; 

==Personal life==
At age 18, she married James Clinton Bicknell, with whom she had four daughters and a son.

In the spring of 1887 approximately a year after marrying Bicknell, Corbin became pregnant for the first time: her condition was discovered by Dr. Lewis Whaley, of Blountsville, Alabama, who was sent for after Corbin had experienced pain in her left side, fever, headache, and a decreased appetite. In addition, the physician noted that &quot;vomiting and amenorrhoea had persisted for two months&quot;. Whaley wrote up the case for the &quot;Atlanta Medical and Surgical Journal&quot;, which led to a resurgence of interest in Myrtle throughout the late 1880s, now known in medical journals as &#x27;Mrs. B.&#x27;

Examining Corbin, Whaley discovered that the duplication of her external sexual organs was mirrored by a similar duplication internally. He determined that it was in her left uterus that Mrs. B. was pregnant. According to Whaley, upon being told that she was pregnant, she replied in disbelief, saying &quot;If it had been in my right side I would come nearer believing you are correct.&quot; From this comment, physicians determined that Corbin preferred intercourse in the right side, and this fact was commented upon in several subsequent reports. The pregnancy caused Corbin to become gravely ill, and after consulting with colleagues, Whaley decided to perform an abortion eight weeks after her initial examination. She was, reportedly, between three and four months pregnant at the time. She made a full recovery, and the procedure (as well as her unique anatomy), did not prevent her from successfully carrying subsequent pregnancies to term. As medical journals across the United States and around the world turned renewed attention to a now mature Corbin, details about her personality revealed a sense of the woman: One article noted that &quot;The lady, Mrs. B... the Myrtle Corbin of days gone by, [is] attractive in face, physically well, and able to attend to all her household duties&quot;, while she was described elsewhere as being &quot;very intelligent&quot; and &quot;a refined woman, of some musical taste.&quot;

==Death==
She died in Cleburne, Texas, on May 6, 1928. Her casket was covered in concrete and various family members kept watch until it was fully cured. This was to prevent grave robbers from stealing her corpse. Several medical practitioners and private collectors offered financial compensation for her corpse.

<text>John Dering Nettleton, VC (28 June 1917 – 13 July 1943) was a South African officer in the Royal Air Force (RAF) during the Second World War. He is most famous for leading the Augsburg raid, a daylight attack against the MAN U-boat engine plant in Augsburg on 17 April 1942. For his role in this mission he was awarded the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
Born on 28 June 1917 in Nongoma, Natal Province, South Africa, Nettleton was the grandson of Admiral A.T.D. Nettleton. He was educated at Western Province Preparatory School in Cape Town from 1928 to 1930. Nettleton served as a naval cadet on the &quot;General Botha&quot; training ship, and then for 18 months in the South African Merchant Marine. He took up civil engineering, working in various parts of South Africa.

==Second World War==
Commissioned in the Royal Air Force (RAF) in December 1938, Nettleton then served with Nos. 207, 98 and 185 Squadrons before joining No. 44 Squadron flying the Handley Page Hampden. He took part in a daylight attack on Brest on 24 July 1941 and in a series of other bombing raids and was mentioned in despatches in September 1940. Nettleton was promoted flying officer in July 1940, flight lieutenant in February 1941 and was a squadron leader by July 1941. No. 44 Squadron was based at RAF Waddington, Lincolnshire at this time and had taken delivery of Lancasters in late 1941.

In 1942 a daylight bombing mission was planned by RAF Bomber Command against the MAN U-boat engine plant in Augsburg in Bavaria, responsible for the production of half of Germany&#x27;s U‑boat engines. It was the first major mission flown using the new Avro Lancaster, a four engine bomber with tremendous lift, great range, and a heavy defensive armament. It would be the longest low‑level penetration raid made during the course of the Second World War. Nettleton was nearing the end of his first tour, and was placed in command of the mission. The operation would require the force to fly at very low level to avoid detection from German radar. To prepare for the raid the two squadrons committed were pulled out of the bombing campaign against Germany to practice low level formation flying.
The Augsburg raid commenced on the afternoon of 17 April 1942, when Nettleton led six Lancaster bombers from RAF Waddington south in two flights of three. A few miles away at RAF Woodhall Spa, six more Lancasters from No. 97 Squadron took to the air and headed south as well. The two groups did not link up, which was not required as part of their mission. Both groups reached Selsey Bill independently, flew out over the channel and turned toward the French coast. The No. 97 Squadron group caught sight of the No. 44 Squadron aircraft as they approached the continent, but the No. 44 Squadron aircraft were running a course slightly to the north of what was planned and the No. 97 Squadron commander chose not to close up. Shortly after Nettleton&#x27;s group crossed the French coast near Dieppe, German fighters of Stab and II./JG 2, returning after intercepting a planned diversionary raid which had been organised to assist the bombers, attacked the No. 44 Squadron aircraft a short way inland. Four of the Lancasters were shot down. Nettleton continued towards the target, and his two remaining aircraft attacked the factory, bombing it amid heavy anti aircraft fire. Both aircraft dropped their bombs but were hit as they flew away from the target. Nettleton&#x27;s aircraft limped back on three engines. His companion&#x27;s Lancaster caught on fire and crashed. At the end of his return flight Nettleton&#x27;s aircraft overflew the United Kingdom and was out over the Irish Sea before turning back and finally landing near Blackpool. He was awarded the Victoria Cross, gazetted on 24 April 1942. His award citation read:

On the night of 12/13 July 1943, Bomber Command put in a raid of 295 Lancasters against Turin in northern Italy. The object of the raid was to encourage the fascist government of Italy to withdraw from the war. Turin was a distant target, and being summer the nights were relatively short. With limited darkness, the return to England could not be flown direct, and had to be routed over the Bay of Biscay to avoid German day fighters. Flying Lancaster KM-Z (ED331), Nettleton took off from RAF Dunholme Lodge in Lincolnshire at 10:23 pm. Another Lancaster on the mission was that of Leonard Bradfield. As dawn rose a number of Lancasters caught sight of each other and grouped together for protection. Also returning from the mission, Bradfield and his crew spotted a group of Lancasters off their starboard side, on a track some 30 degrees to their west. Bradfield was confident he was on the correct course. He had a good visual, and his position had been confirmed with a strong signal from Gee. The Lancasters to their west were too near the coast. Bradfield&#x27;s aircraft signalled, but they received no response.

At about 6:30 am the group of Lancasters with Nettleton were intercepted by German day fighters that had been scrambled from their base south of Brest. Among the Lancaster losses from the mission, three aircraft were known to have been shot down over the [[Bay of Biscay], while six more were lost without a trace. Nettleton and his crew were among the losses. Their bodies were never recovered. All are commemorated on the [[Runnymede Memorial]].

==Legacy==
Following the war the government of Southern Rhodesia named a new school after Squadron Leader Nettleton: Nettleton Junior School, Braeside, Salisbury, Southern Rhodesia (present-day [[Harare, Zimbabwe]]).

On 2 March 1994, a Junior Rank accommodation block was formally opened at RAF Shawbury under the name of Nettleton. A commemorative plaque is located inside detailing Nettleton&#x27;s life and service.

<doc id="782162" wikidata="Q1635267" url="?curid=782162" title="Cone (topology)">
<text>In topology, especially algebraic topology, the cone of a [[topological space]] formula_1 is intuitively obtained by stretching &quot;X&quot; into a cylinder and then collapsing one of its end faces to a point. The cone of X is denoted by formula_2 or by formula_3. 

== Definitions ==
Formally, the cone of &quot;X&quot; is defined as:

:formula_4

where formula_5 is a point (called the vertex of the cone) and formula_6 is the projection to that point. In other words, it is the result of attaching the cylinder formula_7 by its face formula_8 to a point formula_5 along the projection formula_10. 

If formula_1 is a non-empty compact subspace of Euclidean space, the cone on formula_1 is homeomorphic to the union of segments from formula_1 to any fixed point formula_14 such that these segments intersect only in formula_5 itself. That is, the topological cone agrees with the geometric cone for compact spaces when the latter is defined. However, the topological cone construction is more general.

The cone is a special case of a join: formula_16 the join of formula_1 with a single point formula_18.&quot;&quot; 

==Examples==
Here we often use a geometric cone (formula_19 where formula_1 is a non-empty compact subspace of Euclidean space). The considered spaces are compact, so we get the same result up to homeomorphism.

* The cone over a point &quot;p&quot; of the real line is a line-segment in formula_21, formula_22.
* The cone over two points {0, 1} is a &quot;V&quot; shape with endpoints at {0} and {1}.
* The cone over a closed interval &quot;I&quot; of the real line is a filled-in triangle (with one of the edges being &quot;I&quot;), otherwise known as a 2-simplex (see the final example). 
* The cone over a polygon &quot;P&quot; is a pyramid with base &quot;P&quot;.
* The cone over a disk is the solid cone of classical geometry (hence the concept&#x27;s name).
* The cone over a circle given by
::formula_23
:is the curved surface of the solid cone:
::formula_24
:This in turn is homeomorphic to the closed disc.
More general examples:&quot;&quot;
* The cone over an &quot;n&quot;-sphere is homeomorphic to the closed (&quot;n&quot; + 1)-ball.
* The cone over an &quot;n&quot;-ball is also homeomorphic to the closed (&quot;n&quot; + 1)-ball.
* The cone over an &quot;n&quot;-simplex is an (&quot;n&quot; + 1)-simplex.

==Properties==

All cones are path-connected since every point can be connected to the vertex point. Furthermore, every cone is contractible to the vertex point by the homotopy

:formula_25.

The cone is used in algebraic topology precisely because it embeds a space as a subspace of a contractible space.

When &quot;X&quot; is compact and Hausdorff (essentially, when &quot;X&quot; can be embedded in Euclidean space), then the cone formula_2 can be visualized as the collection of lines joining every point of &quot;X&quot; to a single point. However, this picture fails when &quot;X&quot; is not compact or not Hausdorff, as generally the quotient topology on formula_2 will be finer than the set of lines joining &quot;X&quot; to a point.

== Cone functor ==
The map formula_28 induces a functor formula_29 on the category of topological spaces Top. If formula_30 is a continuous map, then formula_31 is defined by 
:formula_32, 
where square brackets denote equivalence classes.

==Reduced cone==
If formula_33 is a pointed space, there is a related construction, the reduced cone, given by 
:formula_34

where we take the basepoint of the reduced cone to be the equivalence class of formula_35. With this definition, the natural inclusion formula_36 becomes a based map. This construction also gives a functor, from the category of pointed spaces to itself.

<text>Julia Pastrana (August 1834 – 25 March 1860) was a performer and singer during the 19th century who had hypertrichosis. Pastrana, an indigenous woman from Mexico, was born in 1834, somewhere in the state of Sinaloa. She was born with a genetic condition, hypertrichosis terminalis (or generalized hypertrichosis lanuginosa); her face and body were covered with straight black hair. Her ears and nose were unusually large, and her teeth were irregular. The latter condition was caused by a rare disease, undiagnosed in her lifetime, gingival hyperplasia, which thickened her lips and gums.

==Life and career==
Multiple versions of Pastrana&#x27;s early life exist. Literature produced by those who managed the freak shows she appeared in described her as belonging to a Native American tribe called &quot;Root Diggers&quot; whose members were similar to apes and lived in caves. In this version, it is said that a woman identified only as Mrs. Espinosa was kidnapped by the tribe and held in a cave and took Pastrana with her when she was able to escape. In another version, which is based on the words of indigenous villagers in Ocoroni, Mexico, Pastrana was a local girl whom they referred to as &quot;wolf woman.&quot; In this version, Pastrana lived with her mother until her mother died, after which, her uncle sold her to the circus. Both accounts claim that, at some point, she lived in the home of Pedro Sanchez, the then-governor of Sinaloa, and left the home in 1854.

According to Ireneo Paz, Francisco Sepúlveda, a customs official in Mazatlán, purchased Pastrana and brought her to the United States. At first, Pastrana performed under the management of J.W. Beach, but in 1854, she eloped with Theodore Lent, marrying him in Baltimore, Maryland. Lent took over her management, and they toured throughout the US and Europe. Pastrana was advertised as a hybrid between an animal and a human and worked in sideshows and freak shows under the stage names the &quot;Baboon Lady&quot;, the &quot;Dog-faced Woman&quot;, the &quot;Hairy Woman&quot;, the &quot;Ape-faced Woman&quot;,
the &quot;Ape Woman&quot;, the &quot;Bear Woman&quot;, and &quot;The Nondescript&quot;. During her performances, she demonstrated her intelligence and talent: singing, dancing, and interacting with the audience.

During a tour in Moscow, Pastrana gave birth to a son, with features similar to her own. The child survived only three days, and Pastrana died of postpartum complications five days later.

==Medical examinations==

During her life, Pastrana&#x27;s management arranged to have her examined by doctors and scientists, using their evaluations in advertisements to attract a larger audience. One doctor, Alexander B. Mott, M.D., certified that she was specifically the result of the mating of a human and an &quot;Orangutan&quot;. Another, Dr. S. Brainerd of Cleveland, declared that she was of a &quot;distinct species&quot;. Francis Buckland stated that she was &quot;only a deformed Mexican Indian woman&quot;. Samuel Kneeland, Jr., a comparative anatomist of the Boston Society of Natural History, declared that she was human and of Indian descent.

Charles Darwin discussed her case after her death, describing her as follows: &quot;Julia Pastrana, a Spanish dancer, was a remarkably fine woman, but she had a thick masculine beard and a hairy forehead; she was photographed, and her stuffed skin was exhibited as a show; but what concerns us is, that she had in both the upper and lower jaw an irregular double set of teeth, one row being placed within the other, of which Dr. Purland took a cast. From the redundancy of the teeth her mouth projected, and her face had a gorilla-like appearance&quot;.

==After death==

After Pastrana&#x27;s death, Lent sold her body and their son&#x27;s body to Professor Sukolov of Moscow University who permanently preserved them. Her body was taxidermically preserved. The process was a blend of taxidermy techniques and embalming chemicals. Although generically referred to as a &quot;mummy&quot; by some authors, her preserved body was technically not a mummy because it was not mummified. Her body was &quot;stuffed&quot;, as noted by renowned naturalist and taxidermist Charles Darwin. After the bodies were preserved by Sukolov, Lent re-purchased them from him and began exhibiting them throughout Europe. Lent later found another woman with similar features, married her and changed her name from Marie Bartel to Zenora Pastrana, becoming wealthy from her exhibition.

For over a hundred years, the bodies of Pastrana and her son were displayed around the world in museums, circuses and amusement parks. They appeared in Norway in 1921 and toured the US as late as 1972. Later that year, a tour of Sweden drew considerable public opposition, leading to the bodies being withdrawn from public view. Vandals broke into the storage facility in August 1976 and damaged the baby&#x27;s body. The remains were consumed by mice. Julia&#x27;s preserved body was stolen in 1979, but stored at the Oslo Forensic Institute after the body was reported to police but not identified. It was identified in 1990 and for many years rested in a sealed coffin at the Department of Anatomy, Oslo University. In 1994, the Norwergian Parliament recommended burying her remains, but the Minister of Sciences decided to keep them, so scientists could perform research. A special permit was required to gain access to her remains.

On 2 August 2012, it was reported in &quot;Aftenposten&quot; that Pastrana would finally be buried in Mexico at an unspecified date. In February 2013, with the help of Sinaloa state governor Mario López Valdez, New York-based visual artist Laura Anderson Barbata, Norwegian authorities, and others, the body was turned over to the government of Sinaloa and her burial was planned. Hundreds of people attended her Catholic funeral, and her remains were buried in a cemetery in Sinaloa de Leyva, a town near her birthplace. Filmmaker Eva Aridjis filmed the burial for her feature documentary &quot;Chuy, The Wolf Man&quot;, a portrait of a modern-day Mexican family with congenital hypertrichosis.

==Theatre==
A musical &quot;Pastrana&quot; by Australian writers Allan McFadden and Peter Northwood was performed by Melbourne&#x27;s Church Theatre in 1989. The production was nominated for five Melbourne Green Room Awards.

A play based on Pastrana&#x27;s life, &quot;The True History of the Tragic Life and Triumphant Death of Julia Pastrana, the Ugliest Woman in the World&quot; (1998) was written by Shaun Prendergast. A 2003 Texas production of the play staged by Kathleen Anderson Culebro, sister of Laura Anderson Barbata, led to the campaign by Anderson Barbata to repatriate Pastrana&#x27;s remains from Norway to Mexico.

==Film==
Marco Ferreri&#x27;s film &quot;The Ape Woman&quot; (1964) is based on Pastrana&#x27;s life story.

On 14 October 2013 the in-development movie &quot;Velvet&quot; was announced, based on the life and experiences of Julia Pastrana, and from an original screenplay by Celso García and Francisco Payó González. &quot;Velvet&quot; is directed by Celso García and is an international production with the support of various personalities behind and in front of the camera. The announcement appeared in an article published in Mexican newspaper &quot;Mural&quot;, member of the editorial group Reforma.

==Music==
The Ass Ponys wrote and recorded the song &quot;Julia Pastrana&quot; about her life on their 1993 album &quot;Grim&quot;.

The musical supergroup Apparatjik released a single titled &quot;Julia&quot; on March 20, 2020, accompanied by a lyric video.

<doc id="782165" wikidata="Q2752431" url="?curid=782165" title="Monolake">
<text>Monolake is a German electronic music project founded in 1995, initially consisting of members Gerhard Behles and Robert Henke. Monolake is now being perpetuated by Henke while Behles has focused on running the music software company Ableton, which they founded in 1999 together with Bernd Roggendorf. In 2004, Torsten Pröfrock became a member of the project.
Monolake is now perpetuated by Henke alone.

Monolake&#x27;s minimal, dub-influenced techno helped establish the sound of the Chain Reaction label, also located in Berlin, which subsequently used their own [ml/i] (&quot;Monolake / Imbalance Computer Music&quot;) label for the group&#x27;s output. Both current members of Monolake have their own solo projects, with Henke releasing under his own name and Pröfrock as &quot;T++&quot; and &quot;Various Artists.&quot;

In 2008, T++ followed Ricardo Villalobos in bridging the gap between minimal techno and dubstep by remixing Shackleton&#x27;s &quot;Death Is Not Final&quot; for the Skull Disco label.

In 2009, Henke appeared in the electronic music documentary &quot;Speaking In Code&quot;, which presented the completion of the Monodeck. As of 2012, Henke has been designing a new form of live show syncing surround-sound audio stems with visual loops, allowing for improvisation.

Monolake is named after Mono Lake, which is east of the Sierra Nevada in California.

==Monodeck==

Henke is a software engineer who develops custom software and hardware for live performances. As well as working as an engineer for Ableton, Henke designed the Atlantic Waves software for performing live with other producers in different countries simultaneously.

In 2003, Henke designed the Monodeck, a MIDI-controller interface for spontaneous editing and effects work during live performances, even without having to look at the computer screen. The Monodeck and its successor, Monodeck II, control Ableton Live through special software designed with Max/MSP.

<doc id="782167" wikidata="Q1157703" url="?curid=782167" title="Daisy and Violet Hilton">
<text>Daisy and Violet Hilton were English-born entertainers who were conjoined twins. They were exhibited in Europe as children, and toured the United States sideshow, vaudeville and American burlesque circuits in the 1920s and 1930s. They were best known for their film appearances in &quot;Freaks&quot; and the biographic &quot;Chained for Life&quot; (1951).

The twins were born at 18 Riley Road, Brighton, England. Their mother was Kate Skinner, an unmarried barmaid. The sisters were born joined by their hips and buttocks; they shared blood circulation and were fused at the pelvis but shared no major organs.

They were variously in media called or referred to as The Siamese Twins, The Hilton Sisters and The Brighton Twins or The Brighton Conjoined Twins and in the United States as the San Antonio Twins. The sisters performed alongside Bob Hope and Charlie Chaplin. After years of being managed professionally by their legal guardians, in the early 1930s, on the advice of Harry Houdini, they were legally emancipated.

==Early life==

A medical account of the birth and a description of the twins was provided for the &quot;British Medical Journal&quot; by physician James Augustus Rooth, who helped deliver them. He reported that subsequently the Sussex Medico-Chirurgical Society considered separation, but unanimously decided against it as it was believed that the operation would certainly lead to the death of one or both of the twins. He noted these twins were the first to be born in the UK conjoined and to survive for more than a few weeks.

Their mother was a woman named Kate Skinner. Her then-employer, Mary Hilton, gained custody of the twins through uncertain means, with differing accounts claiming that Skinner disowned the pair, sold them, or was swindled into relinquishing custody over her daughters. The girls stayed for a period above the Queen&#x27;s Arms pub in Brighton. They later moved to the Evening Star pub.

Most accounts agree that Mary Hilton recognized the novelty presented by a pair of conjoined twins who had survived birth (a rarity at that time) and quickly sought to exploit them as a carnival sideshow exhibition.

==Performing career==
The Hilton sisters toured first in Britain in 1911 (aged three) as &quot;The Double Bosses&quot;.They went through Germany, then to Australia, then in 1916 to the US. In 1926, Bob Hope formed an act called the Dancemedians with the sisters, who had a tap-dancing routine. When Mary died in Birmingham, Alabama, the girls were bequeathed to Mary&#x27;s daughter Edith Meyers, and Edith&#x27;s husband Meyer Meyers, a former balloon salesman.

The couple took over management of the twins. Held mostly captive, the girls were punished if they did not do as the Meyers wished. They kept the twins from public view for a while and trained them in jazz music. Violet was a skilled saxophonist and Daisy a violinist. They lived in a mansion in San Antonio, Texas.

In 1931, the sisters sued their managers and were legally emancipated, gaining freedom from their contract and awarded US$100,000 in damages (equivalent to $ in ). They went into vaudeville as &quot;The Hilton Sisters&#x27; Revue&quot;. Daisy dyed her hair blonde and they began to wear different outfits so as to be distinguishable from each other. After vaudeville lost popularity, the sisters performed at burlesque venues.

Shortly after gaining independence from the Meyers, the Hiltons sailed to the UK on the &quot;Berengaria&quot; in December, 1932. They spent most of 1933 in the UK and returned to the US in October, 1933.

Violet began a relationship with musician Maurice Lambert, and they applied in 21 states for a marriage license, but it was always refused.

In 1932, the twins appeared in the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer film &quot;Freaks&quot;. Afterwards, their popularity faded, and they struggled to make a living in show business.

==Later life==
In 1936, Violet married actor James Moore as a publicity stunt. The marriage lasted ten years on paper, but it was eventually annulled. At the time of the wedding, Daisy was visibly pregnant. Her child was given up for adoption. In 1941, Daisy married Harold Estep, better known as dancer Buddy Sawyer. The marriage lasted ten days.
In 1952, the twins starred in a second film, &quot;Chained for Life&quot;, an exploitation film loosely based on their lives. Afterwards, they undertook personal appearances at double-bill screenings of their two films.

The Hiltons&#x27; last public appearance was in 1961, at a drive-in theater in Charlotte, North Carolina. Without warning, their tour manager abandoned them there with no means of transportation or income. They applied for a job in a nearby grocery store, offering to work for one salary. The owner hired them at two full salaries and designed a discreet two-person cashier station so that customers could not tell the sisters were conjoined. The Hiltons rented a small two bedroom home courtesy of the shop owner&#x27;s church, Purcell United Methodist, and settled into a quiet life, involving work and church. During the holidays they remembered fellow employees and favorite customers with Christmas gifts.

On January 4, 1969, after they did not report to work and attempts to reach them by telephone failed, the police were called to investigate. The twins were found dead in their home, victims of the Hong Kong flu. According to the autopsy, Daisy died first; Violet died between two and four days later. Violet had not called for any help.

==Media legacy==
In 1989, a musical based on the Hilton twins, &quot;Twenty Fingers Twenty Toes&quot;, with book by Michael Dansicker and Bob Nigro and music and lyrics by Michael Dansicker, premiered at the WPA Theatre and ran for 35 performances. The script can be found in the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts. It began as an accurate portrayal of the twins&#x27; early life, but then included a wholly fictitious plot by their keepers to have them surgically separated as adults. 

&quot;Side Show&quot;, a Broadway musical loosely based on the sisters&#x27; lives, with lyrics by Bill Russell and music by Henry Krieger, opened at the Richard Rodgers Theater on October 16, 1997. It starred Emily Skinner as Daisy and Alice Ripley as Violet, and received four Tony Award nominations, but closed after 91 performances. In 2014, a substantially rewritten version of the musical was mounted at the Kennedy Center and moved to Broadway, where it opened at the St. James Theater on November 17, 2014, starring Erin Davie as Violet and Emily Padgett as Daisy. Although well-reviewed, the revival closed on 4 January 2015.

In 2012, Leslie Zemeckis filmed a documentary, &quot;Bound by Flesh&quot;, about the sisters&#x27; lives. &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; called it &quot;scrupulously researched&quot; and a &quot;masterful film&quot;. The film won Best Documentary awards at both the 2012 Hollywood Film Festival and the 2013 Louisiana International Film Festival.
==Other legacy==
Brighton &amp; Hove 316 (YX69 NWD), a 2019 Enviro400ER bus that currently operates in their home town, was named in their honour.

In May 2018, it was announced that Brighton and Hove City Council and the current owner of the house in which the twins were born had agreed that a commemorative blue plaque could be erected at the property.

On 26 May 2022, a commemorative blue plaque was unveiled at 18 Riley Road, dedicated to Violet and Daisy Skinner: The Hilton Twins.

The first story in Megan Mayhew Bergman&#x27;s 2015 short story collection &quot;Almost Famous Women&quot;, entitled &quot;The Pretty, Grown-Together Children,&quot; is based on the Hilton twins.

<doc id="782170" wikidata="Q5354301" url="?curid=782170" title="Eleanor Jarman">
<text>Eleanor Jarman (born Ella Berendt, April 22, 1901 – date of death unknown) was an American fugitive who was imprisoned and escaped from custody in 1940. Jarman was never apprehended, and her ultimate whereabouts remain unknown.

==Early life and crime career==

Jarman was one of 12 children (3 died young) born to Julius and Amelia Berendt, in 1901, in Sioux City, Iowa. She married Michael Roy Jarman, and they had two children, LeRoy and LaVerne. The family moved to Chicago, Illinois, where Michael Roy abandoned the family and Eleanor worked primarily as a waitress until she met George Dale. Dale supported her and the children by robbing small shops in Chicago&#x27;s West Side. In the spring and summer of 1933, Eleanor became an accomplice.

On August 4, 1933, Dale, Jarman, and the get-away-car driver Leo Minneci tried to rob a clothing store. But, in a struggle, Dale shot and killed the shop owner, Gustav Hoeh.

When the robbers drove away, several witnesses noted the license plate. That led police to Minneci, who was the first to be arrested. He blamed Dale and Jarman for the robbery. Jarman claimed she was in the back room looking at clothes.

Witnesses gave contradictory statements as to how many shots were fired and what role Jarman had played in the crime. The press (primarily to sell newspapers) exaggerated Jarman&#x27;s involvement and dubbed her &quot;the Blonde Tigress.&quot; She was compared to her contemporary Bonnie Parker (of Bonnie and Clyde).

In a trial that lasted less than a week, Jarman was convicted as an accomplice in the murder, even though it had become clear that Dale had pulled the trigger. The prosecuting attorney, Wilbur Crowley, called for the death penalty for all three –– Dale, Jarman, and Minneci.

George Dale, however, was the only one sentenced to the electric chair. As his last wish, he wrote a love letter to Jarman. Jarman and Minneci each were sentenced to prison for 199 years, one of the longest criminal sentences ever imposed at the time. Jarman&#x27;s children were sent to live with her older sister and her husband, Hattie and Joe Stocker, in Sioux City, Iowa. 

==After imprisonment==
===A model prisoner===
For the next seven years, Jarman was a model prisoner at the Dwight Correctional Center (Illinois). In 1940, according to her family, she heard that her son was about to run away from home and, concerned about her children, escaped the prison on August 8, 1940, with another inmate, Mary Foster. She apparently went to Sioux City, Iowa, confirmed that her children were all right and then went underground.

===The 1975 meeting===
Over the next 35 years, Jarman maintained surreptitious contact with her family through classified ads. In 1975, she arranged a secret meeting with her brother Otto Berendt, his wife Dorothy, and Jarman&#x27;s son Leroy, by then in middle-age. During this meeting, which the family disclosed decades later, Leroy tried to persuade his mother to give herself up. She refused and said that she was not worried about capture, believing the authorities had long since stopped looking for her. Her family claimed that their communication tapered off in the mid-1990s. A 1993 petition to grant Jarman a pardon failed.

Although Jarman officially remained a fugitive, she was born in , so it is essentially certain that she is dead, and that her death and burial was recorded under an alias.

Eleanor&#x27;s likely burial under an alias is discussed in Silvia Pettem&#x27;s book, &quot;In Search of the Blonde Tigress: The Untold Story of Eleanor Jarman.&quot;

<doc id="782172" wikidata="Q63901" url="?curid=782172" title="Franz von Werra">
<text>Franz Xaver [[Freiherr]] von Werra (13 July 1914 – 25 October 1941) was a German World War II fighter pilot and flying ace who was shot down over Britain and captured. He was the only Axis prisoner of war to escape from Canadian custody and return to Germany apart from a U-boat seaman, Walter Kurt Reich, said to have jumped from a Polish troopship into the St. Lawrence River in July 1940. Werra managed to return to Germany via the US, Mexico, South America and Spain, finally reaching Germany on 18 April 1941.

&quot;Oberleutnant&quot; von Werra was awarded the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross on 14 December 1940. His story was told in the book &quot;The One That Got Away&quot; by Kendall Burt and James Leasor, which was made into a film of the same name, starring Hardy Krüger.

==Biography==
Franz Freiherr von Werra was born on 13 July 1914, to impoverished Swiss parents in Leuk, a town in the Swiss canton of Valais. The title of Freiherr (equal to Baron) came from his biological father, Leo Freiherr von Werra, who after bankruptcy, faced deep economic hardship. Because his relatives were legally obliged to look after the Baron&#x27;s wife and six children, his cousin Rosalie von Werra persuaded her childless friend Louise Carl von Haber to permit the Baron&#x27;s youngest, Franz and his sister, to enjoy the benefits of wealth and education. The von Habers did not tell the children their true origin.

Werra joined the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; in 1936 and was commissioned a &quot;Leutnant&quot; in 1938. At the beginning of the Second World War he was serving with &quot;Jagdgeschwader&quot; 3 in the Battle of France. He became adjutant of II Gruppe, JG 3 and was described as engaging in boisterous &#x27;playboy&#x27; behavior. He was once pictured in the press with his pet lion Simba, which he kept at the aerodrome as the unit mascot. Werra scored his first four victories in May 1940, during the Battle of France. Downing a Hawker Hurricane on 20 May, two days later he claimed two Breguet 690 bombers and a Potez 630 near Cambrai. In a sortie on 25 August during the Battle of Britain, he claimed a Spitfire west of Rochester, and three Hurricanes, as well as five destroyed on the ground for a total of nine RAF planes eliminated. The details of the actions are unknown, as the incident has not been found in British records.

===Capture and escapes===

On 5 September 1940, Werra&#x27;s Bf 109E-4 (&quot;W.Nr. 1480&quot;) was shot down over Winchet Hill, Kent. It is unclear who was responsible for this victory, which was originally credited to Pilot Officer Gerald &quot;Stapme&quot; Stapleton of 603 Squadron. The Australian ace Flight Lieutenant Paterson Hughes (234 Squadron) was posthumously given half of the credit, in &quot;The London Gazette&quot; 22 October 1940 citation awarding him a bar to his DFC. Some sources suggest that P/O George Bennions of 41 Squadron may have damaged Werra&#x27;s fighter before Hughes and Stapleton also scored hits on it. Other sources suggest F/L John Terence Webster of 41 Squadron was the victor.

Werra crash-landed in a field on Loves Farm and was captured by the unarmed cook of a nearby army unit. He was initially held in Maidstone barracks by the Queen&#x27;s Own Royal West Kent Regiment, from which he attempted his first escape. He was digging with a pick axe while guarded by Military Police Private Denis Rickwood, who was armed only with a small truncheon. There is no mention of this escape attempt in the book &quot;The One that Got Away.&quot; He was interrogated for 18 days at the London District Prisoner of War &quot;cage&quot; Trent Park, a country house in Hertfordshire which before the war had been the seat of Sir Philip Sassoon. Eventually, Werra was sent to POW Camp No. 1, at Grizedale Hall in the Furness Fells area of Lancashire, between Windermere and Coniston Water.

On 7 October he tried to escape for a second time, during a daytime walk outside the camp. At a regular stop, while a fruit cart provided a lucky diversion and other German prisoners covered for him, Werra slipped over a dry-stone wall into a field. The guards alerted the local farmers and the Home Guard. On the evening of 10 October at around 11:00 p.m., two Home Guards found him sheltering from the rain in a hoggarth (a type of small stone hut used for storing sheep fodder that is common in the area). On being removed from the hut he knocked the lamp to the ground, extinguishing the light, then he quickly escaped and disappeared into the night. On 12 October, he was spotted climbing a fell. The area was surrounded, and Werra was eventually found, almost immersed in a muddy depression in the ground. He was sentenced to 21 days of solitary confinement and on 3 November was transferred to Camp No. 13 in Swanwick, Derbyshire, also known as the Hayes camp.

In Camp No. 13, Werra joined a group calling itself A.G. (Swanwick Excavations, Ltd.), which was digging an escape tunnel. The tunnel can still be seen at the Hayes Conference Centre. On 17 December 1940, after a month&#x27;s digging, it was complete. The camp had forgers who equipped the escape group with money and fake identity papers. On 20 December, Werra and four others slipped out of the tunnel under the cover of anti-aircraft fire and the singing of the camp choir. The others were recaptured quickly, leaving Werra to proceed alone. He had taken along his flying suit and decided to masquerade as Captain van Lott, a Dutch Royal Netherlands Air Force pilot. He told a friendly locomotive driver that he was a downed bomber pilot trying to reach his unit, and asked to be taken to the nearest RAF base. At Codnor Park railway station, a local clerk became suspicious but eventually agreed to arrange his transportation to the aerodrome at RAF Hucknall, near Nottingham. The police also questioned him but von Werra convinced them he was harmless. At Hucknall, a Squadron Leader Boniface asked for his credentials and von Werra claimed to be based at Dyce near Aberdeen. While Boniface went to check this story, von Werra excused himself and ran to the nearest hangar, trying to tell a mechanic that he was cleared for a test flight. Boniface arrived in time to arrest him at gunpoint, as he sat in the cockpit, trying to learn the controls. Von Werra was sent back to the Hayes camp under armed guard.

In January 1941, von Werra was sent with many other German prisoners to Canada on the , in a convoy departing Greenock on 10 January 1941, guarded by among others. His group was to be taken to a camp on the north shore of Lake Superior, Ontario, so Werra began to plan his escape to the United States, which was still neutral. On 21 January, while on a prison train that had departed Montreal, he jumped out of a window, again with the help of other prisoners and ended up near Smiths Falls, Ontario, 30 miles from the St. Lawrence River. Seven other prisoners tried to escape from the same train but were soon recaptured. Werra&#x27;s absence was not noticed until the next afternoon.

After crossing the frozen St. Lawrence River, von Werra made his way to Ogdensburg, New York, arriving several months before the US entered the war and turned himself over to the police. The immigration authorities charged him with entering the country illegally and Werra contacted the local German consul, who paid his bail. He came to the attention of the press and told them a very embellished version of his story. While the U.S. and Canadian authorities were negotiating his extradition, the German vice-consul helped him over the border to Mexico. Werra proceeded in stages to Rio de Janeiro, (Brazil), Barcelona, (Spain) and Rome, (Italy). He finally reached Nazi Germany on 18 April 1941.

===Return and death===

On his return to Nazi Germany, von Werra became a hero. Adolf Hitler awarded him the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross (). Werra was assigned the task of improving German techniques for interrogating captured pilots, based on his experiences with the British system. Werra reported to the German High Command on how he had been treated as a POW, and this caused an improvement in the treatment of Allied POWs in Germany. He wrote a book about his experiences titled &quot;&quot; (My Escape from England), although it remained unpublished.

On 22 June 1941, German forces launched Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the Soviet Union. Two days later, &quot;Oberleutnant&quot; Wilfried Balfanz, the commander of I. &quot;Gruppe&quot; of &quot;Jagdgeschwader&quot; 53 (JG 53—53rd Fighter Wing), was killed in action. In consequence, &quot;Oberleutnant&quot; Ignaz Prestele briefly commanded the &quot;Gruppe&quot; until von Werra was appointed the (group commander) on 1 July. At the time, I. &quot;Gruppe&quot; was based at Hostynne.

In early August 1941, I. &quot;Gruppe&quot; withdrew to Germany to re-equip with the new Bf 109 F-4 at Mannheim-Sandhofen Airfield. On 20 September, the &quot;Gruppe&quot; relocated to the Netherlands where they were based at airfields at Katwijk, specifically , and Haamstede where they were tasked with patrolling the Dutch airspace. On 25 October 1941, Werra took off in Bf 109 F-4/Z, &quot;Werknummer&quot; (factory number) 7285, on a practice flight. His aircraft suffered engine failure and crashed into the sea near Katwijk. von Werra was presumed killed, though his body was never found. &quot;Hauptmann&quot; Herbert Kaminski succeeded him as commander of I. &quot;Gruppe&quot;.

==Film==

Von Werra&#x27;s story was the subject of the 1957 film &quot;The One That Got Away&quot; starring Hardy Krüger as Franz von Werra. The film was based on a book by Kendall Burt and James Leasor published in 1956. A documentary called &quot;von Werra&quot; (with clips from &quot;The One That Got Away&quot;) was released in the 2000s.

==Summary of career==

===Aerial victory claims===

According to Obermaier, von Werra was credited with 21 aerial victories, eight of which over the Western Allies and thirteen on the Eastern Front, plus five further aircraft destroyed in ground attack missions. Mathews and Foreman, authors of &quot;Luftwaffe Aces — Biographies and Victory Claims&quot;, researched the German Federal Archives and found records for fourteen aerial victory claims, plus five further unconfirmed claims. This figure of confirmed claims includes eleven aerial victories on the Eastern Front and three on the Western Front.

<text>In mathematics, the Ramanujan conjecture, due to , states that Ramanujan&#x27;s tau function given by the Fourier coefficients of the cusp form of weight 

:formula_1

where formula_2, satisfies

:formula_3

when is a prime number. The generalized Ramanujan conjecture or Ramanujan–Petersson conjecture, introduced by , is a generalization to other modular forms or automorphic forms.

== Ramanujan L-function ==
The Riemann zeta function and the Dirichlet L-function satisfy the Euler product,

+\dots\right)&lt;/math&gt;|}}

and due to their completely multiplicative property

Are there L-functions other than the Riemann zeta function and the Dirichlet L-functions satisfying the above relations? Indeed, the L-functions of automorphic forms satisfy the Euler product (1) but they do not satisfy (2) because they do not have the completely multiplicative property. However, Ramanujan discovered that the L-function of the modular discriminant satisfies the modified relation

\right)^{-1},&lt;/math&gt;|}}

where is Ramanujan&#x27;s tau function. The term

:formula_4

is thought of as the difference from the completely multiplicative property. The above L-function is called Ramanujan&#x27;s L-function.

==Ramanujan conjecture==
Ramanujan conjectured the following:
# is multiplicative,
# is not completely multiplicative but for prime and in we have: , and

Ramanujan observed that the quadratic equation of in the denominator of RHS of ,

: formula_5

would have always imaginary roots from many examples. The relationship between roots and coefficients of quadratic equations leads to the third relation, called Ramanujan&#x27;s conjecture. Moreover, for the Ramanujan tau function, let the roots of the above quadratic equation be and , then

:formula_6

which looks like the Riemann Hypothesis. It implies an estimate that is only slightly weaker for all the , namely for any :

:formula_7

In 1917, L. Mordell proved the first two relations using techniques from complex analysis, specifically using what are now known as Hecke operators. The third statement followed from the proof of the Weil conjectures by . The formulations required to show that it was a consequence were delicate, and not at all obvious. It was the work of Michio Kuga with contributions also by Mikio Sato, Goro Shimura, and Yasutaka Ihara, followed by . The existence of the connection inspired some of the deep work in the late 1960s when the consequences of the étale cohomology theory were being worked out.

==Ramanujan–Petersson conjecture for modular forms==
In 1937, Erich Hecke used Hecke operators to generalize the method of Mordell&#x27;s proof of the first two conjectures to the automorphic L-function of the discrete subgroups of . For any modular form

:formula_8

one can form the Dirichlet series

:formula_9

For a modular form of weight for , absolutely converges in , because . Since is a modular form of weight , turns out to be an entire and satisfies the functional equation:

:formula_10

this was proved by Wilton in 1929. This correspondence between and is one to one (). Let for , then is related with via the Mellin transformation

:formula_11

This correspondence relates the Dirichlet series that satisfy the above functional equation with the automorphic form of a discrete subgroup of .

In the case Hans Petersson introduced a metric on the space of modular forms, called the Petersson metric (also see Weil–Petersson metric). This conjecture was named after him. Under the Petersson metric it is shown that we can define the orthogonality on the space of modular forms as the space of cusp forms and its orthogonal space and they have finite dimensions. Furthermore, we can concretely calculate the dimension of the space of holomorphic modular forms, using the Riemann–Roch theorem (see the dimensions of modular forms).

 used the Eichler–Shimura isomorphism to reduce the Ramanujan conjecture to the Weil conjectures that he later proved.　The more general Ramanujan–Petersson conjecture for holomorphic cusp forms in the theory of elliptic modular forms for congruence subgroups has a similar formulation, with exponent where is the weight of the form. These results also follow from the Weil conjectures, except for the case , where it is a result of .

The Ramanujan–Petersson conjecture for Maass forms is still open (as of 2022) because Deligne&#x27;s method, which works well in the holomorphic case, does not work in the real analytic case.

==Ramanujan–Petersson conjecture for automorphic forms==
 reformulated the Ramanujan–Petersson conjecture in terms of automorphic representations for as saying that the local components of automorphic representations lie in the principal series, and suggested this condition as a generalization of the Ramanujan–Petersson conjecture to automorphic forms on other groups. Another way of saying this is that the local components of cusp forms should be tempered. However, several authors found counter-examples for anisotropic groups where the component at infinity was not tempered. and showed that the conjecture was also false even for some quasi-split and split groups, by constructing automorphic forms for the unitary group and the symplectic group that are non-tempered almost everywhere, related to the representation .

After the counterexamples were found, suggested that a reformulation of the conjecture should still hold. The current formulation of the generalized Ramanujan conjecture is for a globally generic cuspidal automorphic representation of a connected reductive group, where the generic assumption means that the representation admits a Whittaker model. It states that each local component of such a representation should be tempered. It is an observation due to Langlands that establishing functoriality of symmetric powers of automorphic representations of will give a proof of the Ramanujan–Petersson conjecture.

==Bounds towards Ramanujan over number fields==
Obtaining the best possible bounds towards the generalized Ramanujan conjecture in the case of number fields has caught the attention of many mathematicians. Each improvement is considered a milestone in the world of modern number theory. In order to understand the Ramanujan bounds for , consider a unitary cuspidal automorphic representation:

:formula_12

The Bernstein–Zelevinsky classification tells us that each p-adic can be obtained via unitary parabolic induction from a representation

:formula_13

Here each formula_14 is a representation of , over the place , of the form

:formula_15

with formula_16 tempered. Given , a Ramanujan bound is a number such that

:formula_17

Langlands classification can be used for the archimedean places. The generalized Ramanujan conjecture is equivalent to the bound .

 obtain a first bound of for the general linear group , known as the trivial bound. An important breakthrough was made by , who currently hold the best general bound of for arbitrary and any number field. In the case of , Kim and Sarnak established the breakthrough bound of when the number field is the field of rational numbers, which is obtained as a consequence of the functoriality result of on the symmetric fourth obtained via the Langlands–Shahidi method. Generalizing the Kim-Sarnak bounds to an arbitrary number field is possible by the results of .

For reductive groups other than , the generalized Ramanujan conjecture would follow from principle of Langlands functoriality. An important example are the classical groups, where the best possible bounds were obtained by as a consequence of their Langlands functorial lift.

==The Ramanujan–Petersson conjecture over global function fields==
Drinfeld&#x27;s proof of the global Langlands correspondence for over a global function field leads towards a proof of the Ramanujan–Petersson conjecture. Lafforgue (2002) successfully extended Drinfeld&#x27;s shtuka technique to the case of in positive characteristic. Via a different technique that extends the Langlands–Shahidi method to include global function fields, proves the Ramanujan conjecture for the classical groups.

==Applications==
An application of the Ramanujan conjecture is the explicit construction of Ramanujan graphs by Lubotzky, Phillips and Sarnak. Indeed, the name &quot;Ramanujan graph&quot; was derived from this connection. Another application is that the Ramanujan–Petersson conjecture for the general linear group implies Selberg&#x27;s conjecture about eigenvalues of the Laplacian for some discrete groups.

<text>Antoine Ó Raifteirí (also Antoine Ó Reachtabhra, or Anthony Raftery; 30 March 1779 – 25 December 1835) was an Irish language poet who is often called the last of the wandering bards.

==Biography==
Antoine Ó Raifteirí was born in Killedan, near Kiltimagh in County Mayo. His father was a weaver. He had come to Killedan from County Sligo to work for the local landlord, Frank Taaffe. Ó Raifteirí&#x27;s mother was a Brennan from the Kiltimagh area. She and her husband had nine children. Antoine was an intelligent and inquisitive child. Some time between 1785 and 1788, Antoine Ó Raifteirí&#x27;s life took a huge turn. It all started with a cough. Soon two of the children began experiencing headaches. Another child had a high fever. A rash appeared on Antoine&#x27;s hand. It caused severe itching. Soon the children were covered in that same rash. They had contracted smallpox. Within three weeks, eight of the nine children had died. One of the last things young Antoine saw before going blind was his eight siblings laid out dead upon the floor.

As Ó Raifteirí&#x27;s father was a weaver, he had not experienced the worst of that era&#x27;s poverty, but it would be much more difficult for his son to escape hardship. He lived by playing his fiddle and performing his songs and poems in the mansions of the Anglo-Irish gentry. His work draws on the forms and idiom of Irish poetry, and although it is conventionally regarded as marking the end of the old literary tradition, Ó Raifteirí and his fellow poets did not see themselves in this way.

In common with earlier poets, Antóine had a patron in Taaffe. One night Frank sent a servant to get more drink for the house. The servant took Antóine with him, both of them on one of Franks good horses. Whatever the cause (said to be speeding) Antóine&#x27;s horse left the road and ended up in the bog, drowned or with a broken neck. Frank banished Antóine and he commenced the life of an itinerant. According to An Craoibhín (Douglas Hyde) one version of the story is that Antóine wrote Cill Aodáin (as DH Kileadan, County Mayo, his most famous work apart from Anach Cuan, to get back in Frank Taaffe&#x27;s good books. Taaffe however was displeased at the awkward way Antóine worked his name into the poem, and then only at the end. Another version has it that Antóine wrote this poem in competition to win a bet as to who could praise their own place best. When he finished reciting the poem his competitor is reported to have said &quot;Bad luck to you Raftery, you have left nothing at all for the people of Galway&quot; and refused to recite his own poem.

None of his poems were written down during the poet&#x27;s lifetime, but they were collected from those he taught them to by An Craoibhín Aoibhinn Douglas Hyde, Lady Gregory and others, who later published them.

Ó Raifteirí was lithe and spare in build and not very tall but he was very strong and considered a good wrestler. He always wore a long frieze coat and corduroy breeches.

Ó Raifteirí died at the house of Diarmuid Cloonan of Killeeneen, near Craughwell, County Galway, and was buried in nearby Killeeneen Cemetery. In 1900, Lady Gregory, Edward Martyn, and W. B. Yeats erected a memorial stone over his grave, bearing the inscription &quot;RAFTERY&quot;. A statue of him stands in the village green, Craughwell, opposite Cawley&#x27;s pub.

==Poetry==
Ó Raifteirí&#x27;s most enduring poems include &quot;Eanach Chuin&quot; and &quot;Cill Aodain&quot; which are still learned by Irish schoolchildren.

===Eanach Chúin===
===Cill Aodáin===
These are the opening two verses of &quot;Cill Aodáin&quot;:
==Legacy==
*The first four lines of &quot;Mise Raifteirí an File&quot; appeared on the reverse of the Series C Irish five pound note.

* Douglas Hyde wrote a play called &quot;The Marriage&quot; (&quot;An Pósadh&quot;) where a poor newlywed couple is visited by Raftery on their wedding day. The bard attracts a lot of people with his music, and leaves after giving the couple all the numerous gifts given to him for it. Soon after, it is discovered that Raftery had actually been dead for a while.
* The author James Stephens published English translations of poems attributed to Ó Raifteirí in his book &quot;Reincarnations&quot;. The American composer Samuel Barber wrote a composition for mixed chorus – also entitled &quot;Reincarnations&quot; – based on three of the poems translated by Stephens.
*An annual festival, Féile Raifteirí, is held in Loughrea, County Galway each year on the last weekend in March. Ó Raifteirí spent most of his later years in townlands close to the town. The festival features a contemporary Irish language poet and promotes the native arts of Ireland. The festival ends with a visit to Raifteirí grave in neighbouring Craughwell.
* Kiltimagh town square features a granite memorial in honour of Antoine Ó Raifteirí erected in 1985, in that same year Kiltimagh twinned with Craughwell, the final resting place of the blind Gaelic poet.
* Scoil Raifteirí, an All-Irish Primary School in Castlebar, County Mayo is named in honour of the poet.
* The Raftery Room Restaurant is located in Kiltimagh Main Street*
* Ó Raifteirí is mentioned in passing by IRA member Liam Devlin in Jack Higgins&#x27;s 1975 novel &quot;The Eagle Has Landed.&quot;
* In 2011 Seán Ó Cualáin directed a feature film &quot;Mise Raiftearaí an Fíodóir Focal&quot;/&quot;I am Raifteirí, The Weaver of Words&quot; documenting the life of Ó Raifteirí, which was produced by Sonta Teo for TG4, and featured Irish actor Aindrias de Staic in the lead role as Ó Raifteirí.
* A street on the Ballymagroarty estate in Derry, Raftery Close, is named after Antoine Ó Raifteirí. All the streets in the estate are named after Irish writers.
* Sketch of Raifteirí http://www.irishpage.com/graf/raftery.gif
* In Radclyffe Hall&#x27;s novel &quot;The Well of Loneliness&quot;, Stephen Gordon&#x27;s horse is named Raftery after the Irish poet.
* Bob Dylan&#x27;s 2020 song &quot;I Contain Multitudes&quot; contains the line &quot;Follow me close, I&#x27;m going to Bally-na-Lee&quot;, presumed by Richard F. Thomas, Paul Muldoon, Brian Hiatt, and others to be a reference to Raifteiri&#x27;s &quot;The Lass From Bally-na-lee&quot; (&quot;Agus gluais go lá liom go Baile Uí Laí&quot; / &quot;So walk with me to Bally-na-Lee&quot;).
* Liam Clancy speaks Raifteiri&#x27;s poem &quot;Mary Hynes&quot; over music in a song which appears on the compilation CD &quot;Favourites&quot; (2005)

<text>Ely Sakhai (born 1952) is an American art dealer and civil engineer who owned Manhattan art galleries The Art Collection and Exclusive Art. He was later charged and convicted for selling forged art and was sentenced to 41 months in federal prison for fraud. After his release he continued to operate The Art Collection in Great Neck, New York .

==Art galleries==

Sakhai emigrated from Iran to the United States in 1962 and gained a civil engineering degree from Columbia University. He later developed an interest in art and opened a number of small art galleries in the 1970s and 1980s. In the 1980s, Sakhai purchased a range of Impressionist and Post-Impressionist works by artists including Marc Chagall, Paul Gauguin, Marie Laurencin, Monet, Auguste Renoir and Paul Klee.

Sakhai and his wife became active members of the Long Island community where they donated money to Jewish organisations and established a Torah study centre.

==Art forgery allegations==

According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the United States Attorney&#x27;s Office, Sakhai bought lesser-known works and had the paintings copied by Chinese immigrants working in the upstairs area of his gallery.

Sakhai then took the genuine certificates of authenticity and attached them to copies to sell. Months or years later he would obtain a new certificate of authenticity for the original and then sell it. In several instances he sold the forgeries to Asian collectors and real works to New York and London galleries. According to reports, Japanese collectors trusted the certificates and would not subsequently commission European experts to authenticate the paintings. Sakhai would also buy relatively worthless paintings to reuse the canvases for new forgeries. Sakhai denied involvement and suggested that he often consigned paintings to other dealers which put them out of his control.

==Charges and conviction==

In May 2000, both Christie&#x27;s and Sotheby&#x27;s realized they were both offering Paul Gauguin&#x27;s &quot;Vase de Fleurs&quot; (also known as &quot;Lilas&quot;), both supposedly original. Both auction houses took the paintings to Gauguin expert Sylvie Crussard at the Wildenstein Institute in Paris. She confirmed that the Christie&#x27;s painting was a forgery; Christie&#x27;s had to withdraw their catalogue from the printers. They also informed the owners, &quot;Gallery Muse&quot; in Tokyo. The original painting was auctioned at Sotheby&#x27;s and Ely Sakhai received $310,000 which was traced by the FBI.

On March 9, 2000, the FBI arrested Sakhai at his gallery on Broadway and charged him with eight counts of wire and mail fraud and estimated Sakhai had made $25 million from the deals. He was later released on bail.

On March 4, 2004, Sakhai was charged with eight counts of fraud, and again released on bail. Later in 2004 he pleaded guilty to, according to his lawyer, &quot;resolve his difficulties with the government and get this behind him&quot;. In July 2005 he was sentenced to 41 months in prison, fined $12.5 million, and ordered to forfeit eleven works of art. Both before and after charges were laid, Sakhai maintained he was innocent and openly discussed the case and his other business ventures with journalists.

==Other business ventures==

After charges were laid against him, Sakhai closed his Manhattan galleries and opened a new gallery, The Art Collection, in Great Neck, New York, which he continued to operate after his imprisonment. In 2009, Sakhai cooperated with ICE agents seeking to return a copy of Belgian artist Anto Carte&#x27;s &quot;Young Girl in a Blue Dress&quot; stolen by the Nazis during World War II.
Sakhai remains a resident of New York.

<doc id="782185" wikidata="Q1269296" url="?curid=782185" title="Abergele rail disaster">
<text>The Abergele rail disaster took place near Abergele, North Wales, in August 1868. At the time, it was the worst railway disaster to have occurred in Great Britain.

The Irish Mail train was on its way from London to Holyhead. At Llanddulas -- the nearest sidings to Abergele -- a complicated shunting operation was blocking the main line. In the confusion a brake-van and six wagons loaded with paraffin were left uncoupled on a gradient leading down to Abergele. A collision with other wagons caused these to run downhill into the path of the Irish Mail train, the casks of paraffin bursting on impact and catching fire, engulfing the passenger train. 

Flames and smoke made rescue impossible and 33 people died in the crash, some of them burned beyond recognition. The inquest blamed the two brakemen on the goods train, who had failed to properly secure the wagons, as well as the stationmaster at Llanddulas who was supervising the operation. The Board of Trade also strongly criticised the London and North Western Railway for poor practices.

== Narrative ==

=== The Irish Mail ===
On 20 August 1868, at 7.30 a.m., the London and North Western Railway&#x27;s down day &quot;Irish Mail&quot; train left the LNWR&#x27;s London terminus, Euston Station, for Holyhead. One of the railway&#x27;s most powerful engines, &quot; Prince of Wales &quot;, hauled behind it a chief guard&#x27;s van, a travelling post office (mail van and tender), a luggage van, four passenger carriages, and a second guard&#x27;s van at the rear of the train. At 11.30 a.m. in Chester, four more passenger carriages were attached immediately behind the front guard&#x27;s van; the train then set off for Holyhead, its next scheduled stop, via the North Wales Coast Line (Chester and Holyhead Railway). At about 12.39 p.m. the train passed through Abergele at about 40 miles per hour (~64 km/h). Following a late start from Euston, and a further slight delay in Chester, it was about 5 minutes late overall; by that time it should already have been 3 miles (5 km) further on and passing Llanddulas.

=== The goods train ===
Ahead of it, a &#x27;pick-up&#x27; goods train 43 wagons long had left Abergele at 12.15 p.m. on the same line; to clear the down line for the express, the goods train was to be put into sidings at Llanddulas until the express had passed.

At Llanddulas, there were two sidings (Llysfaen sidings), serving a lime quarry to the south of the line. When the goods train reached them (about 12.25 p.m.), both were partly occupied by goods wagons (&#x27;cargo trucks&#x27;, or freight cars) and consequently neither siding could take the entire goods train. Under the direction of the Llanddulas stationmaster, therefore, the brake van and the last six wagons of the goods train were uncoupled and left on the main down line (protected by the distant signal for Llanddulas). Rather than simply shunting the rest of the train into one of the sidings and returning for the odd six, a series of &#x27;loose shunting&#x27; operations was embarked upon intended to put empty wagons (there were 26 in the train) into one of the sidings and accumulate a shorter train of loaded wagons on the main line ready to put into the other siding.

=== Runaway wagons ===
There were two brakesmen on the goods train; however, both men dismounted to take part in the shunting operations. The wagons did not have their own brakes applied, and so were held solely by the brake van – on a gradient of as much as 1 in 100, falling towards Abergele. The next set of loaded wagons were &#x27;loose shunted&#x27; into the original wagons with such force as to jostle the brake van and release its own unsecured brake, and the wagons moved off in the direction of Abergele. The brake van was unoccupied, and no-one was able to catch up with it in order to board it and reapply the brake; the runaway wagons disappeared out of sight around a curve in the line. The next thought was to reverse the engine towards Abergele and retrieve the wagons, but this intention was quickly overtaken by the succeeding events.

=== Collision===
About beyond Abergele, Arthur Thompson, the engine driver of the &quot;Irish Mail&quot;, saw some wagons no more than 200 yards (~200 metres) in front, emerging from around a curve in the steep cutting at that point. He initially thought the wagons were on the up line, &quot;but immediately afterwards perceived that they were running towards him on the down line on which he was travelling&quot;. He promptly shut off steam, and the fireman, who had also seen the hazard, applied his brake. Thompson prepared to jump clear and called to his fireman &quot;For God’s sake Joe, jump; we can do no more&quot;. Thompson then jumped; Joe, his fireman, did not.

The Irish Mail is thought to have been doing 28–30 mph (45–50 km/h) when it hit the wagons, which were probably travelling at 12–15 mph (20–25 km/h) towards it at impact. The force of the collision derailed the engine, its tender and the leading guard&#x27;s van. The engine ran on about 30 yards and overturned to the left; the tender overturned to the right and ended up fouling the up line, along which the up (London-bound) &quot;Irish Mail&quot; was soon due to pass.

However, the heavy loss of life resulting from the crash was caused less by the impact itself, and more by the load of the two runaway wagons next to the brake van, which carried 50 wooden barrels, holding about 1,700 gallons (~7,750 litres) of paraffin oil between them. This oil would have been of a slightly different kind from modern kerosene but with similar flammability (its &#x27;igniting point&#x27; is noted as in the report) and uses (oil lamps etc.).

=== Fire, casualties, and Lord Hamilton&#x27;s testimony ===
Some of the barrels broke up in the collision, and their contents caught fire. The engine, tender, guard&#x27;s van and the first three-passenger carriages were instantly enveloped in dense smoke and flames, which soon spread to the fourth carriage and the front of the leading post office van. This prevented any immediate attempt to rescue the occupants of the first four carriages, who all died, together with the guard in the front guard&#x27;s van and the locomotive&#x27;s fireman.

Local farm labourers and quarry workers eventually formed a bucket chain to fetch water from the sea 200 yards (~200 metres) away to put out the fire in these carriages; when they did the victims were found to be burnt beyond recognition, reduced to mere &quot;charred pieces of flesh and bone&quot;. Three of them were later identified by their personal effects. The victims were buried in a mass grave in St Michael&#x27;s churchyard in Abergele, with the London &amp; North Western Railway Company paying all funeral expenses.

The engine driver, Arthur Thompson, survived the collision, but was wounded by flying splinters; he died in October the same year from a pre-existing condition (ulcerated bowels), the inquest upon him concluding that his death had been hastened by his injuries in the accident. The post office workers in the travelling post office escaped, with some of the mail, but the leading post office van was destroyed by fire. There were no deaths or even serious injuries in the carriages behind the post van, and the carriages themselves were successfully detached and saved from the fire.

A first-class passenger, possibly the Marquess of Hamilton, CB, MP, a Lord of the Bedchamber to Albert Edward, Prince of Wales, and/or labourers sent by the surviving guard, ran to Llanddulas to warn of the accident, and the up &#x27;Irish Mail&#x27; was successfully held there. Lord Hamilton, the Tory MP for Donegal in Ulster, was the eldest son of His Excellency The 1st Duke of Abercorn, the then Lord Lieutenant of Ireland; Abercorn had only been raised to a dukedom some ten days beforehand. The surviving passengers resumed their journey at 6 p.m. the same day (as did the up &#x27;Irish Mail&#x27;).

There were more than one dozen casualties part identified, including both The 7th Baron Farnham, KP, an Anglo-Irish peer, and his wife, Baroness Farnham. Her jewels were found and valued at £6,000. Much coinage gold and silver were melted together from the heat. The deceased were recognised by the artefacts which included two locks from guns, scissors, one Bible and the metalwork from suitcases.

The &quot;Railway News&quot; said of the incident:

===Inquest and prosecutions===
At the subsequent inquest, the two brakesmen of the goods train did not give evidence (on legal advice), and the coroner&#x27;s jury returned a verdict of manslaughter against them. The jury also strongly censured the station master at Llanddulas for allowing shunting when the express was expected imminently, contrary to the LNWR&#x27;s rules. The brakesmen were tried for manslaughter at Ruthin assizes the following spring, but acquitted. From contemporary press accounts, at the assizes the judge&#x27;s charge to the grand jury gave a strong indication that the brakesmen were – or should have been – under the control of a superior officer: the Llanddulas stationmaster. He then instructed the jury that they should consider if the brakesmen were under the control of the stationmaster, and if there was culpable negligence, whose was the negligence? Despite this, the jury returned a true bill, and the brakesmen were tried the next day, the trial jury retiring for less than 10 minutes before returning a verdict of &#x27;Not Guilty&#x27;.

== Lessons ==

===Railway inspector&#x27;s report===
The Board of Trade inspector, Colonel Frederick Henry Rich, issued his report within a month of the accident. He found that:

* The immediate cause of the accident was the failure of the senior brakesman to apply the individual wagon brakes on the six detached wagons;
* The brake van&#x27;s brake had been broken by loose shunting of loaded wagons into the six wagons at too high a speed; the secondary cause was the failure of the senior brakesman to moderate their speed by applying wagon brakes, and;
* The station master at Llanddulas &quot;was very culpable&quot; in not having directed the goods train into the sidings as soon as it arrived at Llanddulas.

However, his analysis went beyond that of the inquest jury; he considered that these failings did not excuse the LNWR, and to some extent were its responsibility.

He then criticised the LNWR on a number of points:
* The section of line was being run on the interval system in a way which was &quot;much to be condemned&quot;. The intervals allowed appeared wholly inadequate, particularly for a powerful passenger/mail express being expected to follow a mixed goods working, along a section containing a 1 in 100 gradient – not to mention the need for shunting of goods wagons at Llanddulas to allow the express past. He recommended that on the section in question, and any others like it, &quot;the block telegraph system should be put strictly in force&quot;;
* Llanddulas station and Llysfaen sidings had never been inspected by a Government official or been approved by the Board of Trade. They were &quot;quite unfit&quot; to be used at the same time to support both the quarry operations and accommodation of slower trains to allow expresses to pass them. He recommended that an additional siding large enough to accommodate any train being passed should be provided, and kept free from quarry traffic;
* The LNWR &quot;appeared to have a very slack system of supervision&quot;, with nobody to look after guards, train them, or monitor their performance;
* Dangerous materials were included in normal goods trains with no greater care taken of them than of other cargoes. He recommended that they should be sent by separate &quot;special&quot; trains, with additional precautions observed;
* The practice of locking the doors of passenger carriages from the outside. He recommended that all doors be left unlocked.

He then returned to his previous point about what in modern parlance would be &quot;safety culture&quot; and &quot;compliance&quot; issues, but he saw as a simple question of discipline:

He then gave a number of examples, beginning with one which was undeniably relevant:

...before ending:

=== Catchpoints ===
Although this was not one of the recommendations of the Board of Trade report, it became the practice for steep inclines to be fitted with runaway catchpoints so that runaway vehicles would be derailed and stopped before they had a chance to collide with following trains. These catchpoints became widespread, and only diminished in numbers when all rolling stock was fitted with continuous automatic brakes in the 1980s.

=== Petroleum Act 1879 ===

Not until 1879 was any legislation passed to regulate the carriage of flammable liquids by rail.

== Similar accidents ==
*Versailles rail accident (1842); wooden carriages which caught fire and cars locked from outside
*Stairfoot rail accident (1870)
*Chelford rail accident (1894); only vaguely similar but the accident report quotes LNWR rules on shunting brought in as a result of Abergele

=== Previous similar but minor accidents on North Wales Coast Line ===
* Penmaenmawr (1854) - goods train still shunting when express arrived - express overran &#x27;distant&#x27; signal.
* Bangor (1856) - defective interval working - passenger train predictably caught up with goods train - block working recommended.
* Penmaenrhos Tunnel (1859) - defective interval working- light engine predictably caught up with goods train - block working recommended more strongly: covering letter concludes My Lords direct me to call the attention of the directors to the concluding recommendation of the inspecting officer as to the desirableness of working the line by means of the electric telegraph.

<doc id="782187" wikidata="Q105868" url="?curid=782187" title="Gabriela Sabatini">
<text>Gabriela Beatriz Sabatini (; born 16 May 1970) is an Argentine former professional tennis player. A former world No. 3 in both singles and doubles, Sabatini was one of the leading players from the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s, amassing 41 titles. In singles, Sabatini won the 1990 US Open, the WTA Finals in 1988 and 1994, and was runner-up at Wimbledon 1991, the 1988 US Open, and the silver medalist at the 1988 Olympics. In doubles, Sabatini won Wimbledon in 1988 partnering Steffi Graf, and reached three French Open finals. Among Open era players who did not reach the world No. 1 ranking, Sabatini has the most wins over reigning world No. 1 ranked players. In 2006, she was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame and in 2018 &quot;Tennis&quot; Magazine ranked her as the 20th-greatest female player of the preceding 50 years.

==Childhood and junior career==
Sabatini was born 16 May 1970 in Buenos Aires, Argentina, to Osvaldo and Beatriz Garofalo Sabatini. Her father was an executive in General Motors. Her elder brother, Osvaldo, is an actor and producer.

Sabatini started playing tennis at the age of six, and won her first tournament at eight. In 1983, age 13, she became the youngest player ever to win the Orange Bowl in Miami, Florida. She won the girls&#x27; singles at the 1984 French Open and the US Open girls&#x27; doubles with fellow Argentinian Mercedes Paz. Sabatini reached world No. 1 in the junior rankings that year and was named 1984 Junior World Champion by the International Tennis Federation.

Sabatini stated that she deliberately lost matches in her youth to avoid having to do on-court interviews and therefore avoid media attention. She said that her shyness had been a major problem, and she thought she had to speak on-court after playing in the final of a tournament; so, she would lose in the semifinals.

==Career==
===Early years===
In 1985, aged 15 years and three weeks, Sabatini became one of the youngest-ever players to reach the semifinals of the French Open, where she lost to Chris Evert. She won her first WTA Tour singles title later that year in Tokyo. She first entered the world&#x27;s top ten (at #10) in September 1985, and ended the year ranked number 12. She received the WTA Newcomer of the Year award.

Sabatini reached the semifinals of Wimbledon in 1986, losing to Martina Navratilova, before winning her second WTA title in Buenos Aires, She re-entered the world&#x27;s top ten in September 1986 and would remain there for 508 consecutive weeks until May 1996.

Sabatini reached the semifinals of the 1987 French Open, and reached the final of the 1987 WTA Tour Championships, losing to Steffi Graf both times. She also won three WTA titles, including defeating world No. 4, Pam Shriver in Brighton.

===1988: US Open and Olympics finals; WTA Finals champion===
In February 1988, Sabatini entered the top five in rankings, and would remain there uninterrupted until August 1993. Having reached her third French Open semifinal, she then reached her first Grand Slam singles final at the US Open, where she lost to Graf in three sets. Sabatini represented Argentina in the 1988 Summer Olympics held in Seoul and was selected to carry her country&#x27;s flag in the opening ceremony. She went on to win the silver medal in the women&#x27;s singles competition, losing to Graf in the final. Sabatini teamed-up with Graf to win the women&#x27;s doubles title at Wimbledon that year. At the end of 1988, Sabatini won her first WTA Tour Championships, without dropping a set.

===1989===
In 1989, Sabatini reached seven tournament finals and won four titles, including the Miami Open (defeating Evert in the final). In defeating world No. 2, Martina Navratilova, and No. 1, Steffi Graf, to obtain the Amelia Island title, she became only the fifth player in Open Era history to defeat both the No. 1 and 2 ranked players at the same tournament. She also reached the semifinals of the Australian Open and US Open Grand Slam tournaments.

===1990: US Open champion===
At the Australian Open, Sabatini sprained her ankle during a third-round match while one set up, and had to be taken off Centre Court in a wheelchair. 80 minutes later, in the following match, Mark Woodforde also sprained his ankle on the same court and was forced to retire by wheelchair too. Multiple players had complained of the dangers of playing on the Rebound Ace hard court surface used at the tournament, which they claimed became very sticky – and therefore potentially dangerous – in very hot conditions. Sabatini was sidelined for six weeks by the injury, returning to the tour in mid-March and winning her first tournament back – the Virginia Slims of Florida – without the loss of a set.

She reached the semi-finals of Wimbledon, losing to eventual champion Martina Navratilova, in straight sets.

At the US Open, Sabatini progressed to her second Grand Slam final where she defeated world No. 1 Graf in straight sets 6–2, 7–6 to win the title, having saved two set points against her while 5-6 down in the second set. She credited her win with being more aggressive and coming to the net whenever she could to attack Graf&#x27;s shorter balls. Sabatini also beat Graf in the semifinals of the WTA Championships in Madison Square Garden later that year, losing in the final to Monica Seles, 6–4, 5–7, 3–6, 6–4, 6–2. It was the first five-set match to be played on the women&#x27;s tour since 1901.

===1991: Wimbledon final===
Sabatini won five tournaments in the first half of the year. She beat three top five players (Graf, Navratilova and Fernandez) on her way to winning the title in Tokyo, and beat Graf on three further occasions in Boca Raton, Key Biscayne and Amelia Island. In the Italian Open final, Sabatini defeated world no. 1 Seles for the loss of just five games. She reached the semifinals at Roland Garros (saving two match points in defeating Jana Novotná in the quarter-finals) and then her third Grand Slam singles final at Wimbledon, where she lost to Graf 4–6, 6–3, 6–8 (having served for the match twice). Sabatini came close to attaining the world No. 1 ranking in 1991, but was narrowly denied by Graf and then Monica Seles. All three players&#x27; rankings were within a few points of each other for much of the year. Her year was capped by receiving the WTA Most Improved Player of the Year award.

===1992===
Sabatini reached eight finals and won five titles, including her fourth Italian Open (where she beat world No. 1 Seles in the final again), Amelia Island (defeating Graf in the final) and Hilton Head. She also reached the semifinal stage at three of the four grand slams:- the Australian Open, French Open and Wimbledon; and a quarterfinal at the US Open.

===1993===
At the Australian Open, Sabatini reached the semifinals, saving three match points in the quarterfinals against Mary Pierce to defeat her 4–6, 7–6, 6–0, before losing to eventual champion, Seles. She reached consecutive finals at the Italian Open and German Open during the clay-court season. At the French Open in June, Sabatini lost to Mary Jo Fernandez in the quarterfinals 8–10 in the final set, in what was – at the time – the third longest match in Open Era tennis, having led 5–1 in the second set. Sabatini also reached the quarterfinals at Wimbledon, and at the US Open where she lost to Graf in three sets.

That year in May, following the stabbing attack of Monica Seles in the WTA Hamburg tournament, a vote among the top players was held by the tour organisers to decide whether Seles should be allowed to have her world no. 1 ranking protected while recovering from the knife attack. Of the 17 players voting, all players voted against protecting Seles&#x27; ranking, apart from Sabatini (who abstained). Despite the vote result, Seles was eventually granted a joint No. 1 ranking (with Graf) upon her return to the tour two years later.

===1994: WTA Finals champion===
In 1994, Sabatini reached the finals of Amelia Island and Strasbourg, and the semifinals of both the Australian Open and US Open. Across 15 consecutive Grand Slam events from Wimbledon 1990 to Australian Open 1994, she did not lose before the quarterfinal stage; this was the third longest streak of consecutive quarterfinal Grand Slam appearances in women&#x27;s tennis ever (behind Graf and Navratilova tied on 19). In November, Sabatini defeated Lindsay Davenport in the final of the WTA Championships in New York to win her second title at that tournament. In the first round, she beat world No. 6, Martina Navratilova, in what was Navratilova&#x27;s last match before retirement.

===1995===
Sabatini won the title at the Sydney International, defeating Davenport in the final in straight sets. As well as the reaching a record seventh final in the Amelia Island Championships and her third final at the Porsche Tennis Grand Prix, she also reached the quarterfinals of both the French Open and Wimbledon, and the semifinals of the US Open (where she lost to eventual champion Graf 4–6, 6–7). Their semifinal was the 40th and final match between the pair, in which Graf led 29–11. Sabatini&#x27;s 11 wins meant she had defeated Graf more times than any other player ever managed to defeat her.

===1996: injury and retirement===
Sabatini missed several months of the season due to a pulled stomach muscle injury. In New York in October, she announced her retirement from professional tennis. At the end of the year, she received the WTA Diamond Aces Award (given to the player considered to have done the most to promote tennis both on and off the court).

From 1986 until her five-month injury absence in 1996, Sabatini spent 508 consecutive weeks within the world&#x27;s top 10. This remains the fourth longest top-10 streak among any player in WTA-tour history. She spent 312 of those weeks in the world&#x27;s top five, and finished six consecutive seasons with a top-5 ranking. Sabatini reached the semifinal stage or better in Grand Slam championships on 18 occasions in singles and 14 times in doubles, and reached at least one Grand Slam singles semifinal for 11 consecutive years. She defeated the reigning world No. 1 on ten occasions (Graf seven times, Seles twice and Navratilova once) during her career.

Sabatini won the Diamond Konex Award in 2000 as the most distinguished &quot;Sportsperson of the Decade&quot; in Argentina, and in July 2006 she was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame.

==Personal life==
In the late 1980s, Sabatini launched a line of fragrances after partnering with the German perfume company Mülhens. Her signature scent debuted in 1989. Since retiring, she has continued to promote her lines of perfumes.

In 1992, Sabatini became the first ever tennis player to have a rose named after her, an orange-red bloom.

Great American Doll Company created a doll in Sabatini&#x27;s likeness in 1994, dressed in tennis attire. That same year, Sabatini published a motivational book entitled &quot;My Story&quot;.

In 2003, she obtained Italian citizenship &quot;jus sanguinis&quot; through her paternal great-grandfather – David Sabatini – who was born in Potenza Picena in Central Italy, and immigrated to Argentina at the end of the 19th century with his wife Rosa Vivani.

A statue of Sabatini was unveiled in central Buenos Aires by Mauricio Macri in 2014. Within weeks of its unveiling, however, the bronze-coloured racket was stolen from the statue&#x27;s grip. The statue is placed alongside memorials to other Argentinian sports stars including Lionel Messi, Diego Maradona, Guillermo Vilas and Roberto de Vicenzo.

Sabatini was awarded the International Club&#x27;s prestigious Jean Borotra Sportsmanship Award in 2017 in recognition of both the sportsmanship she demonstrated throughout her career, and for her charitable projects post-retirement. She received the award from Rod Laver at the 2018 Wimbledon Championships.

In 2019, the ITF presented Sabatini with its highest accolade, the Philippe Chatrier Award, for her achievements both during her tennis career and post-retirement charity work, specifically her work involving UNICEF, UNESCO, the Special Olympics, and as an &#x27;Athlete Role Model&#x27; at the 2018 Youth Olympic Games.

Through her brother Osvaldo, Sabatini&#x27;s sister-in-law is Venezuelan actress Catherine Fulop and her niece is Argentinian singer and actress Oriana Sabatini, who married Paulo Dybala, a renowned Argentinian footballer. Sabatini resides in Buenos Aires, Boca Raton (Florida) and Pfäffikon in Switzerland.

<text>Dundela Football Club, nicknamed &quot;The Duns&quot; is a semi-professional, Northern Irish football club from Belfast, currently playing in the NIFL Championship, and plays its home matches at Wilgar Park. The club&#x27;s colours are green and white. The home kit has green shirts, green shorts and green socks, whilst the away kit is all red.

==History==
Dundela Football Club was formed in 1895 from employees of a local dairy owned by the Agnew family and members of a local harriers&#x27; club. Wilgar Park has been the home to the club since 1900. The park lies in the heartland of east Belfast, in a suburb named Strandtown. Its capacity is approximately 1,200. The venue is nicknamed &quot;The Hen Run&quot;.

The club&#x27;s greatest achievement to date came in April 1955, when it defeated Glenavon by three goals to nil at Windsor Park, Belfast in the final of the Irish Cup. It was the first time a club from the Irish Alliance won the competition.

The club&#x27;s darkest hour occurred on 25 August 1995, when team captain, Michael Goddard died during a game at Stangmore Park, home of Dungannon Swifts, after being struck on the chest with the ball.

Dundela&#x27;s local rivals are Harland &amp; Wolff Welders.

===2017/18-present===
Dundela FC emerged victorious in the 2017/18 NIFL Premier Intermediate League, securing a notable accomplishment in the club&#x27;s history.

In the subsequent 2018/19 NIFL Championship campaign, Dundela FC secured a commendable 4th-place finish. The Belfast-based football club continued to exhibit competitive prowess as it navigated the challenges of the Championship.

In the curtailed 2019/20 season The Duns finished sixth. The following season was cancelled due to the global pandemic. NIFL Championship football returned after the pandemic in the 2021/22 campaign in which Dundela finished 8th.

In the 2022/23 campaign, Dundela exhibited improvement, climbing up the table to achieve 4th place.

In April 2023, Dundela winger Aodhan Gillen died in a car accident, at the age of 22.

In 2023, the club appointed former player Stephen Gourley as manager, following the departure of Paul Harbinson.

The following season, the club would perform incredibly well, leading the NIFL Championship for much of the season, however were unable to be promoted due to issues with the pitch dimensions at Wilgar Park, an issue which will not be rectified in the near future. Such an issue emphasized the great need for stadia improvement within Northern Ireland.

<text>Dead Vent 7 is the first full length album by Single Cell Orchestra. It was released in 1995 on Reflective Records.

<text>Eleanor Florence Rathbone (12 May 1872 – 2 January 1946) was an independent British Member of Parliament (MP) and long-term campaigner for family allowance and for women&#x27;s rights. She was a member of the noted Rathbone family of Liverpool.

==Early life and education==
Rathbone was the daughter of the social reformer William Rathbone VI and his second wife, Emily Acheson Lyle. She spent her early years in Liverpool. Her family encouraged her to concentrate on social issues; the family motto was &quot;What ought to be done, can be done.&quot;

Rathbone was educated mainly at home, tutored in Latin and Greek by feminist Janet Case, later attending Kensington High School (now Kensington Prep School), London. She went on to attend Somerville College, Oxford, against the protests of her mother, and received Classics coaching from Lucy Mary Silcox. She studied with tutors outside of Somerville, which at that time did not yet have a Classics tutor, taking Roman History with Henry Francis Pelham, Moral Philosophy with Edward Caird, and Greek History with Reginald Macan. Some of these classes were taken together with Barbara Bradby, a lifelong friend.

Rathbone was devoted to her studies, taking little part in the entertainments available to female students such as games, and engaging in limited socialising with male students. Her handwriting was reportedly so poor that she had to dictate her final exam papers to a typist, and she received a result in the Second class.

In 1894 she was one of the seven founding members of the &quot;Associated Prigs&quot;. This was the unofficial name of a women&#x27;s discussion group that met on Sundays evenings. The first meeting was in Edith Marvin&#x27;s room. They never agreed a name or leader but the group would keep notes and the links established were valuable after they left Somerville. Another founder member was Mildred Pope and other early members were Margery Fry and Hilda Oakeley.

Denied an Oxford degree due to her gender, she was one of the steamboat ladies who travelled to Ireland between 1904 and 1907 to receive an &quot;ad eundem&quot; University of Dublin degree (at Trinity College Dublin).

After Oxford, Rathbone worked alongside her father to investigate social and industrial conditions in Liverpool, until he died in 1902. They also opposed the Second Boer War. In 1903 Rathbone published their &quot;Report on the results of a Special Inquiry into the conditions of Labour at the Liverpool Docks&quot;, a report that revealed the impact of erratic docker&#x27;s wages on the living standards of their wives and children. In 1905 she assisted in establishing the School of Social Science at the University of Liverpool, where she lectured in public administration. Her connection with the university is still recognised by the Eleanor Rathbone building, lecture theatre and Chair of Sociology.

== Suffrage campaigner ==
Rathbone joined the Liverpool Women&#x27;s Suffrage Society shortly after university and soon became a member of the executive committee of the National Union of Women&#x27;s Suffrage Societies. She wrote a series of articles for suffragist magazine &quot;The Common Cause&quot;. Rathbone and other Liverpool suffrage campaigners, such as Alice Morrissey, ensured women&#x27;s political and franchise groups acted co-operatively in Liverpool despite the sometimes violent sectarianism and political divisions of the community at that time. In 1913 with Nessie Stewart-Brown she co-founded the Liverpool Women Citizen&#x27;s Association to promote women&#x27;s involvement in political affairs and educate women in citizenship to prepare them for enfranchisement. This initiative was widely copied across the country.

When the Representation of the People Act afforded women over the age of 30 the right to vote in 1918, Rathbone was instrumental in ensuring this included a local government vote as well as parliamentary.

The following year she succeeded Millicent Garrett Fawcett as President of the National Union of Societies for Equal Citizenship (the renamed National Union of Women&#x27;s Suffrage Societies) and led successful campaigns for universal women&#x27;s suffrage, equal guardianship of children, divorce law reform and widow&#x27;s pensions.

==Local politician and campaigner==

Rathbone was elected as an independent member of Liverpool City Council in 1910 for the seat of Granby Ward, a position she retained until 1935.

Rathbone campaigned for a number of social and political issues at the local level and was involved in establishing various groups and charitable organisations. At the outbreak of the First World War, Rathbone organised the Town Hall Soldiers&#x27; and Sailors&#x27; Families Association (today known as SSAFA, the Armed Forces charity) to support wives and dependants of soldiers. She also formed the Liverpool 1918 Club alongside Elizabeth Macadam, a luncheon club for women aiming to maintain friendships and professional contacts forged during the First World War and women&#x27;s suffrage campaign. The club still meets at the Adelphi Hotel and is reputedly the oldest women&#x27;s forum still meeting. In 1919, Rathbone co-founded the Liverpool Personal Service Society with social worker Dorothy Keeling. Also involved in its formation were Elizabeth Macadam and academic Frederic D&#x27;Aeth. The Personal Service Society was a social care organisation, which aimed to be &quot;a society for any citizen in difficulty&quot;.

From 1918 onwards, Rathbone campaigned for a system of family allowances paid directly to mothers. She also opposed violent repression of rebellion in Ireland (see Irish Home Rule movement).

Rathbone campaigned for women&#x27;s rights in India, although in a misguided manner. A believer that the Raj authorities were not getting to grips with Indian social issues, she used figures from the 1931 census to support her misguided claim that child marriages were not in decline and that the act had caused a significant spike in the numbers. She claimed that there had been a 50 percent increase in wives under the age of 15 and a quadrupling of wives under 5 years old since 1921, and that the lives of women were being blighted. She thought Indians incapable of helping themselves and in need of firmer instruction from British authorities, who should enforce change, rather than merely encourage it. In turn, debates such as those, based on untrustworthy information, informed opinions about Indian nationalism and the role of Britain generally in the country. Rathbone herself was confronted by Rama Rau, an Indian feminist, who said that the British were simply not well-placed to understand Indian culture and that &quot;educated Indian women were working in every province of their country to eradicate social evils and outmoded customs and prejudices, and we refused to accept the assertion that the removal of social evils in Indian society was the responsibility of the British&quot;.

She contested the 1922 General Election as an Independent candidate at Liverpool East Toxteth against the sitting Unionist MP and was defeated.

In 1924 in the &quot;Disinherited Family&quot;, she argued that economic dependence of women was based on the practice of supporting variably-sized families with wages that were paid to men, regardless of whether the men had families or not. Later she exposed insurance regulations that reduced married women&#x27;s access to unemployment benefits and health insurance.

==Westminster politician==
Rathbone campaigned for Parliament as a feminist, stating &quot;I am standing as a woman, not because I believe there is any antagonism between men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s interests but because I believe there is need in the House of Commons for more women who can represent directly the special experience and point of view of women.&quot;

In 1929 Rathbone entered parliament as an independent MP for the Combined English Universities. One of her first speeches was about what is now known as female genital mutilation in Kenya, then a British colony. During the Depression, she campaigned for cheap milk and better benefits for the children of the unemployed. In 1931 she helped to organise the defeat of a proposal to abolish the university seats in the parliament and won re-election in 1935.

Rathbone realised the nature of Nazi Germany and in the 1930s joined the British Non-Sectarian Anti-Nazi Council to support human rights.
In 1934, she become the leader of the Children&#x27;s Minimum Committee which was constituted after the BMA Nutrition Report to sensitise the public opinion about the &quot;wide discrepancy&quot; existing between &quot;the cost of a satisfactory diet and the actual sums available to poorly paid or unemployed parents for the nourishment of their children.&quot;

When in 1931 Japan invaded Manchuria, Eleanor Rathbone thought Britain was too complacent and did not explain how Japan could have been deterred, without, like the Soviet invasion of Hungary in 1956, risking a World War:769.

In 1936 she began to warn about a Nazi threat to Czechoslovakia. She also favoured rearmament and argued for its necessity in the &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot;.

She became an outspoken critic of appeasement in Parliament. She denounced British complacency in Hitler&#x27;s remilitarisation of the Rhineland:223, and the Italian conquest of Abyssinia. She supported the League of Nations&#x27; attempt to impose sanctions on Italy, although she expressed sympathy for France&#x27;s opposition to the sanctions including oil, as France had no oil. She criticised when Britain, having imposed sanctions on Italy, subsequently lifted them, and was appalled when in January 1939, on a visit to Italy by Neville Chamberlain and Lord Halifax at a state banquet in Rome, Mr Chamberlain set the seal of social cordiality on the Abyssinian betrayal by raising his glass to &quot;His Majesty the King of Italy, Emperor of Ethiopia&quot;229, 232.

In respect of the Spanish Civil War. Once she tried to hire a ship to run the blockade of Spain and remove Republicans at risk from reprisals. Her determination was such that junior ministers and civil servants of the Foreign Office would reputedly duck behind pillars when they saw her coming. She supported the points of Winston Churchill and Clement Attlee but earned the enmity of Neville Chamberlain:249. She observed:

&quot;I am no admirer of any dictatorship, certainly not that of Stalin, but it is only fair to recognise in the sordid history of the Non-Intervention Agreement the one bright spot was the part played by the USSR&quot;

In 1936, Rathbone was one of several people who supported the British Provisional Committee for the Defence of Leon Trotsky, and signed a letter to the &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot; defending Trotsky&#x27;s right to asylum and calling for an international inquiry into the Moscow Trials. While she advocated for gender difference, during a speech to Parliament she said that &quot;those who expect women’s contributions to be something completely &quot;sui generis&quot;, utterly different from the contribution of men, will be disappointed.&quot;

On 30 September 1938, Rathbone denounced the just-publicised Munich Agreement:249. She pressured the parliament to aid the Czechoslovaks and grant entry for dissident Germans, Austrians and Jews:287. In late 1938 she set up the Parliamentary Committee on Refugees to take up individual cases from Spain, Czechoslovakia and Germany. During World War II she regularly chastised Osbert Peake, undersecretary at the Home Office:283, and in 1942 pressured the government to publicise the evidence of the Holocaust.

Eleanor Rathbone often supported unpopular causes such as German and Italian internees. At the height of the battle of Britain on 10 July 1940, she complained of the harsh treatment of internees, many of which were Germans who had fled from Germany because they were anti Hitler. In a speech to the House of Commons on 15 October 1945, she was one of few Britons prepared to criticise the expulsion of 2,500,000 people of German origin from Czechoslovakia during the winter months of 1946 because it might create large-scale starvation.:326 Many Germans had been anti-Nazi. Later, Eleanor Rathbone achieved limited success when the minister agreed not to allow the deportation of pregnant women or young children during the winter months320.

==Personal life==
At the end of the First World War, Rathbone and the social work campaigner Elizabeth Macadam bought a house in London together. The two friends continued to share the house until Rathbone&#x27;s sudden death in January 1946.

Rathbone&#x27;s studies in Classics and Philosophy, as well as her experience of social work led her to reject religion and adopt a rationalist perspective. She believed that concern for others was the foundation of ethics.

Rathbone was a first cousin once-removed of the actor Basil Rathbone. Her nephew John Rankin Rathbone was the Conservative MP for Bodmin from 1935 until his death in the Battle of Britain, 1940, when his wife Beatrice succeeded him as MP. Her great-nephew Tim Rathbone was Conservative MP for Lewes from 1974 to 1997.

Her great-niece, Jenny Rathbone, was a Labour councillor in Islington and later was the Parliamentary Candidate for the Labour Party in the South Wales constituency of Cardiff Central at the 2010 General Election. She was elected to the National Assembly for Wales as representative for Cardiff Central in the 2011 National Assembly elections.

Brian Harrison&#x27;s suffrage interviews project, titled &quot;Oral evidence on the suffragette and suffragist movements: the Brian Harrison interviews&quot;, holds a number of interviews with employees of Rathbone&#x27;s.   

In February 1977 Harrison interviewed Marjorie Soper, who worked for Rathbone at the Family Endowment Society where she was involved in research and propaganda for family allowances which Rathbone considered an integral part of the &#x27;new feminism&#x27;.  Soper also ghost wrote articles for Rathbone.

In March 1977 Doris Cox was interviewed twice, firstly with Marjorie Soper and secondly with Vera Schaerli (the journalist, also known as Vera Craig).  Cox and Soper describe Rathbone&#x27;s personality, her secretarial arrangements and her home, her Parliamentary speeches and relationships with politicians. Cox and Schaerli talk about Rathbone&#x27;s working and domestic arrangements with Elizabeth Macadam, and of the demands Rathbone placed on her employees and her style of working.

An August 1977 interview took place with Helga Wolff, who became an employee of Rathbone after being introduced by Erna Nelki. Wolff was a secretary for Rathbone&#x27;s refugee work and speaks about the Parliamentary Committee on Refugees as well as Rathbone&#x27;s secretarial arrangements in the early 1940s.

In September 1984 he interviewed Vera Schaerli again, who describes Rathbone&#x27;s personality and personal relationships as well as her influence on Members of Parliament

==Legacy==

In 1945, the year before her death, Eleanor Rathbone saw the Family Allowances Act pass into law.:310

In 1986, a blue plaque was erected for her by Greater London Council at Tufton Court, Tufton Street, Westminster, London SW1P 3QH, City of Westminster, where she had lived.

Her name and picture (and those of 58 other women&#x27;s suffrage supporters) are on the plinth of the statue of Millicent Fawcett in Parliament Square, London, unveiled in 2018.

The University of Liverpool acknowledges Rathbone by way of its Eleanor Rathbone Building; the site houses the School of Law and Social Justice and the Department of Psychology, as well as the Eleanor Rathbone Theatre used for stage productions and musical performances. Edge Hill University has a hall of residence called Eleanor Rathbone in honour of her work as a social reformer.

<text>Ralstonism was a social movement founded by Webster Edgerly that promoted his pseudoscientific ideas of personal and racial hygiene. It began as the Ralston Health Club, which published Edgerly&#x27;s writings. It was a hierarchical organization where members were ranked according to the number of &quot;degrees&quot; they had, which ranged from 0 to 100. Members gained in the hierarchy by purchasing and studying Ralston&#x27;s books, each of which taught five degrees. Edgerly at first published his ideas under the pseudonym Everett Ralston, but later used his own name and explained &quot;Ralston&quot; as an acronym for &quot;Regime, Activity, Light, Strength, Temperation, Oxygen, Nature&quot;

Edgerly saw his followers as the founding members of a new race, based on Caucasians, and free from &quot;impurities&quot;. He advocated the castration of all &quot;anti-racial&quot; (non-Caucasian) males at birth.

Edgerly wrote 82 of what would today be called self-help books under the pseudonym &quot;Edmund Shaftesbury&quot;. They covered subjects including diet, exercise, punctuation, sexual magnetism, artistic deep breathing, facial expressions, and ventriloquism. Although Edgerly publicly claimed that the Ralston Company had no goods for sale, he did sell his books through mail order.

In addition to advice like toothbrushing, the books make various recommendations: for example, every young man should engage in a form of probationary marriage with a woman old enough to be his grandmother. Edgerly also created his own language, called the Adam-Man-Tongue, with a 33-letter alphabet.

The Magnetism Club of America, another Ralstonite organization, was founded to give its members mind control.

Ralstonites were to follow strict dietary guidelines. For example, watermelons were supposed to be poisonous to Caucasians. Correct diet and proper physical exercise would help readers attain personal magnetism, which would give them control over the thoughts of others. Much of the physical regime demanded moving in graceful curves and arcs and walking exclusively on the balls of one&#x27;s feet. Because sudden starts and stops and sharp angular movements caused a &quot;leakage of vital force&quot;, Ralstonites were to even pick marbles in continuous circles. There was a proper way to bathe (dry bath), gesture, sit, stand, sleep, talk, and have sex.

In 1900, Edgerly joined forces with the founder of Purina Food Company, which took the name Ralston Purina Company (which would later become Nestlé Purina PetCare). It made whole wheat cereal that Ralstonites were to consume. The food company Edgerly founded evolved into what is now called Ralcorp which was the original manufacturer of cereal brands including Chex and Cookie Crisp.

Between 1894 and 1895, Edgerly bought large areas of farmland along the northern slope of Hopewell Valley, New Jersey, where he founded Ralston Heights in 1905. A house he designed was built to contain a community of Ralstonites he meant to be a core of a future City of Ralston. The contours of the estate followed Edgerly&#x27;s conviction that sudden stops and walking in straight lines would cause leakage of vital force. Edgerly planned to expand to hundreds of lots, sixteen small farms, seven palaces and a Temple of Ralston. This community did not materialize, at least not in the form Edgerly intended. Much of the estate still exists, albeit in ruined condition.

In 2020, a fiction novel entitled &quot;Ralston Heights&quot; was published by James Betz, an author from nearby Pennington, New Jersey. Albeit supernatural horror, Betz&#x27; story was influenced by Webster Edgerly&#x27;s Hopewell Valley residence along with the Ralstonism movement.

<text>Erlend Otre Øye (born 21 November 1975) is a Norwegian composer, musician, producer, singer and songwriter from Bergen, best known for being one half of the indie folk duo Kings of Convenience, along with Eirik Glambek Bøe. Among other musical projects he is front-man for the band The Whitest Boy Alive, and has contributed to tracks by electronic music artists such as Dntel and Norwegian duo Röyksopp. He is also the co-founder of the independent label Bubbles Records. Since 2012 he has lived in Sicily and played extensively with trio La Comitiva. 

In addition to his native Norwegian, he also speaks English and some Italian.

== Biography ==

===Bergen===
Erlend Øye was born on 21 November 1975 in Bergen, his parents met in 1974 in a demonstration in support of the victims of the 1973 Chilean coup d&#x27;état against Salvador Allende that took place in Bergen, at which time his father read a poem, which allowed him to meet Øye&#x27;s mother. Having grown up listening to Leonard Cohen, Nick Drake, Suzanne Vega and The Smiths, during high school in the early-mid 1990s, he and some of his friends formed the band Skog (&quot;&quot;forest&quot;&quot; in Norwegian), taking inspiration from the famous song &quot;A Forest&quot; by The Cure. In 1996 he joined the band Peachfuzz as electric guitarist, playing several times in London between 1996 and 1998.

In 2008 he started to collaborate on a project with Mikal Telle of &quot;Tellé Records&quot; and they created the independent label &quot;Opplett&quot; with the aim of producing young talent from Bergen and the surrounding area. The label &quot;Opplett&quot; published three projects: the album &quot;Opplett 2008&quot; that contains seven songs by seven different artists (as Lars Vaular, John Olav Nilsen &amp; Gjengen and Razika, 2008); the first single of Indie rock band Razika called &quot;Love is All About the Timing&quot;; and the first album of the band Fjorden Baby!.

===London===
In 1998 he moved to London and then in 1999 to Manchester. 
When he was back home in Bergen for vacations he jammed with Eirik Glambek Bøe, his former high school and Skog mate. The duo formed Kings of Convenience in 1998 and released the debut record, &quot;Quiet is the New Loud&quot;, in 2001.

===Berlin===
In the same period, he collaborated with the electronic Norwegian duo Röyksopp, lending his voice for the song &quot;Poor Leno&quot; and &quot;Remind Me&quot; on the record &quot;Melody A.M.&quot;. As a result, he became interested in electronic music and spent the next years in Berlin from 2002 to 2006 or travelling around the world, recording his solo album &quot;Unrest&quot; in ten different cities with ten different electronic music artists. He toured as a DJ, singing along with the records that he played and released a remix record for the DJ Kicks series in 2004. In the same year, Kings of Convenience released the second record &quot;Riot on an Empty Street&quot;. Meanwhile, he founded another project in Berlin, The Whitest Boy Alive. The band originally started as an electronic band, but slowly developed into a band with no electronic elements, releasing the debut record &quot;Dreams&quot; in 2006, while the latest record entitled &quot;Rules&quot; was released in 2009. Both the records were released by Bubbles Records, the independent label founded by Erlend Øye and Marcin Öz in 2006. In 2006, he appeared in the Italian movie &quot;Shooting Silvio&quot; acting as DJ during a house party. In 2009, Kings of Convenience released the third record &quot;Declaration of Dependence&quot;. In 2011 and 2013, he produced the records &quot;Hest&quot; and &quot;Six months is a long time&quot; by fellow Bergen band Kakkmaddafakka.

===Sicily===
In 2012, during a small concert organized in a vernissage in Ortigia in Sicily, he publicly stated that he had bought a house in the city of Syracuse to move there with his mother. In 2013, he released a new single, entitled &quot;La Prima Estate&quot;, sung in Italian and inspired by his time living in Italy, which is accompanied by a videoclip shot in Syracuse. He is currently working on more songs in Italian, which will be made into an album. In 2014, The Whitest Boy Alive announced the end of the project. On 3 October 2014, he released his second solo album &quot;Legao&quot;, recorded in Reykjavík with Hjálmar, a reggae group from Iceland, which was anticipated by the single &quot;Garota&quot; with a videoclip shot in Seoul. Despite currently living in Sicily, he is still involved in the Bergen music scene, promoting local bands and assisting the organization of the annual Traena Music Festival.

=== Chile ===
On numerous occasions Øye has visited Chile. His first presentation was in 2006, during his tour in South America. In 2017 he traveled to Chile to spend a season at the home of a close friend who lived in Santiago, where he mainly dedicated himself to composing songs on the ukulele. After playing at the &quot;En Orbita&quot; Festival, he met Tiare Galaz (a member of the Chilean band Niña Tormenta), who also played the ukulele. After talking with Tiare backstage, they agreed to meet another day to share their experiences on the instrument. After being invited to dinner the next day by Tiare, he met Diego Lorenzini, who brought him a chord notebook. Some time later, he was invited to a series of concerts of the Matiné Uva Robot, where he met musicians Rosario Alfonso and Javier Bobbert. In an interview with CNN Chile, he said &quot;from that moment on we started to play regularly while I was in Chile. It was very surprising to see how the musical search of these four Chileans was very similar to what I was doing with the support band that I had formed with three Sicilian friends - called La Comitiva -, so I finally decided to invite them to open my tour of Germany together&quot;. Chilean artists were invited to a tour with Øye through Europe, where he established a great friendship with Chilean musicians. During the summer of 2018, he returned to Chile to accompany the Swedish-Argentine singer-songwriter José González, and later accompanied Niña Tormenta, Diego Lorenizi and the band Salanca Selector at an outdoor concert in the Chilean town of Pirque. In 2019 Øye collaborated with Diego Lorenzini in his song &quot;Me voy a Valparaíso&quot; from his album &quot;De algo hay que morir&quot; (UVA Robot, 2019). In late 2019, The Whitest Boy Alive announced a new series of performances in Chile and Argentina and in 2020 released the non-album single &quot;Serious&quot;, the project&#x27;s first new material since 2009&#x27;s &quot;Rules&quot;.

=== Mexico ===
In the beginning of 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Øye found himself stranded in San Jose del Cabo, Mexico. In a hotel that came equipped with a recording studio, Øye and Sebastian Maschat, the drummer of Whitest Boy Alive, recorded the album &quot;Quarantine At El Ganzo&quot;.

<doc id="782210" wikidata="Q1176726" url="?curid=782210" title="David Stein (art forger)">
<text>David Stein (born Henri Haddad, January 27, 1935, Alexandria, Egypt – October 1999, Bordeaux, France) was an artist who, until 1966, had been frequently sentenced for theft by the French courts before becoming an art forger and art dealer with 15 aliases. Stein studied the artworks of Marc Chagall, Matisse, Braque, Paul Klee, Miró, Jean Cocteau and Rouault.

== Forgeries ==
In 1967, Marc Chagall notified authorities of forgeries of his work exhibited in a New York gallery, and Stein was arrested. Art dealers refused to cooperate with the prosecution because they thought that it would have made their expertise in the art field questionable. Stein was convicted of six counts of art forgery and grand larceny. During his prison term, Joseph Stone, the judge who arrested him, brought him to his office to paint. He remained a friend of the Stein family. In 1989, Stein still continued to make forgeries.

After Stein had served his prison term in the United States, he was deported to France, where he served another term. Prison authorities allowed him to make further paintings, although now using his own name. In 1969, a London gallery sold some of these paintings. After Stein was released, he sold his paintings under his own name.

== Later life ==
In the mid-1980s, director Gil Cates gave his agent Arthur Axelman at William Morris a copy of the book, which had been written without Stein&#x27;s involvement. Axelman set out to find Stein, and after several years, he located him in Manhattan. Stein became an Axelman client and friend. Axelman introduced Stein to Keith Carradine and Alan Rudolph, director of the movie The Moderns, starring John Lone, Géraldine Chaplin, Keith Carradine and Linda Fiorentino. Stein appeared in the film as an art critic and provided all of the art.

Stein was living in France after the United States told him to leave US territory in 1988. He met the French photoreporter Stéphane Korb in 1981 in New York, and they became close friends. For 10 years, with the agreement of David Stein, he has been a confidant in Stein&#x27;s photo archives and files about his personal life since 1981, including the story of the fake collages of Superman comics signed &quot;Andy Warhol 1960&quot;. David Stein tried to escape a number of creditors after the series of Superman collages. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, in 1989, two comics experts discovered a series of fake collages in the Andy Warhol retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art. The same event happened in Paris three years later. Stein put four fake Superman collages in a public auction.

David Stein died in October 1999 in Bordeaux, France, from cancer. He had three children.

<text>Captain Frederick Charles Booth VC, DCM (6 March 1890 – 14 September 1960) was a Rhodesian recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==
Booth was born in Holloway, North London, and educated at Cheltenham College. He served in the British South Africa Police in Southern Rhodesia from 1912 to 1917 and his regimental number was 1630. He was 26 years old, and a sergeant in the British South Africa Police attached to the Rhodesian Native Regiment during the First World War, when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 12 February 1917 in Johannes Bruck, German East Africa (now Tanzania), during an attack in thick scrub on an enemy position, Sergeant Booth went forward alone to rescue an injured man. He then rallied the poorly organised native troops and brought them to the firing line. On many previous occasions this NCO had set a splendid example of pluck, and endurance.

In 1918 he was commissioned into the Middlesex Regiment and in 1939 served with the Auxiliary Military Pioneer Corps.

Booth died on 14 September 1960 in Brighton, Sussex, England. He is buried at Bear Road Cemetery, Brighton, in the Red Cross Plot.

<text>Second Lieutenant Basil Arthur Horsfall, VC (4 October 1887 – 27 March 1918) was a British-Ceylonese recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
Born on 4 October 1887 in Colombo, Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), Horsfall was educated at S. Thomas&#x27; College, Mount Lavinia in Ceylon and at Sir William Borlase&#x27;s Grammar School, Marlow in England. He left a position with Barclay&#x27;s Bank, London, to become a rubber planter back in Ceylon, where he also held a civil service position with the Public Works Department and served with the Ceylon Engineer Volunteers. During World War I, he returned to Britain in July 1916 to enlist in the British Army and was commissioned as a 2nd Lieutenant in the East Lancashire Regiment in December. He was wounded at Rouex on 11 May 1917 while serving with the 1st Battalion. After recovering from his wound he joined the 11th Battalion, (the Accrington Pals), in the Autumn of 1917.

==Victoria Cross==
On 21 March 1918, between Moyenneville and Ablainzevelle, France, the Germans attacked positions held by Second Lieutenant Horsfall&#x27;s centre platoon. After his three forward sections were driven back, he was wounded in the head by enemy fire. Ignoring the wound, he immediately reorganised what remained of his troops and counterattacked to regain his original position. Despite the severity of his head wound, he refused to go to the dressing station, as the three other officers in his company had been killed. Later, he made another counterattack, but was ordered to withdraw. The last to leave his position, he was shot soon afterwards.

==Distinctions and tributes==

* Victoria Cross. Horsfall&#x27;s medal is kept in the Queen&#x27;s Lancashire Regiment Museum at Fulwood Barracks, Preston, Lancashire.
* Horsfall&#x27;s name is on the Arras Memorial in France. It is not known where he is buried.
* The school of Ablainzevelle was named after Horsfall in 2019.
There is a blue plaque commemorating Horsfall on the front wall of Borlase School in Marlow. His name is recorded on the war memorial inside the school chapel and a replica of his VC is placed inside the chapel.

<text>Paris is a live album recorded by The Cure at Le Zénith de Paris in October 1992, during their &quot;Wish&quot; tour. The band announced the album in July 1993 and released it that October.

&quot;Paris&quot; was released at the same time as &quot;Show&quot;, which was recorded in the United States. The album features more cult classics like &quot;The Figurehead&quot; and &quot;One Hundred Years&quot; than &quot;Show&quot;, which is generally more single-friendly.

50% of the royalties earned by the album were given to the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement charities in support of their international relief work.

In mid-1996, &quot;Billboard&quot; reported that &quot;Paris&quot; had sold 95,000 copies in the United States by that point, much less than the 213,000 copies of &quot;Show&quot; sold there by the same point. The magazine described the release of the album &quot;within a few weeks&quot; of &quot;Show&quot; as exemplifying the &quot;unorthodox career path&quot; that the band had taken.

== Reception ==
Stephen Thomas Erlewine of &quot;AllMusic&quot; praised the album, observing &quot;&quot;Show&quot; featured mostly hit singles; &quot;Paris&quot; features the songs that built their cult, including &quot;Close to Me&quot; and &quot;Letter to Elise.&quot; Consequently, most fans will find this the more interesting of the two live albums, and, out of the two records, it is the more consistent and satisfying.&quot;

Patrick Brennan of &quot;Hot Press&quot; was also positive on the song choices and felt it was &quot;for die-hard Cure fans it&#x27;s a gorgeous treat and for other acolytes of the lukewarm or lapsed variety it might well re-recruit them back into Bob Smith&#x27;s sometimes wacky, ofttimes gloomy and always idiosyncratic world.&quot;

Michele Kirsch of &quot;Vox&quot; praised the album&#x27;s &quot;top shelf sound engineers&quot; and &quot;good editing&quot;. Rating the album eight out of ten, he noted &quot;there&#x27;s nothing here that doesn&#x27;t work.&quot;

<text>Frank William Baxter VC (29 December 1869 – 22 April 1896) was a Rhodesian recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==
Born on 29 December 1869 in Woolwich, London, Baxter was 26 years old, and a trooper in the Bulawayo Field Force during the Matabeleland Rebellion, when, on 22 April 1896 (Matabeleland Rebellion), near Umguza, Mashonaland, Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), Baxter gave up his horse to a wounded comrade who was lagging behind, with an enemy force in hot pursuit. Baxter then tried to escape on foot, hanging on to the stirrup of another mounted scout of the Bulawayo Field Force, until he was hit in the side by enemy fire. He let go of the stirrup and died moments later.

Baxter is buried at Bulawayo Town Cemetery, Bulawayo, Zimbabwe.

==The Medal==
Baxter&#x27;s medal is on display in the Lord Ashcroft VC collection in the Imperial War Museum in London.

<text>Robert &#x27;Rob&#x27; Hume is an English ornithologist, author and journalist specialising in avian and natural history subjects. From Spring 1989 (vol. 12 no. 5), until Summer 2009 (vol. 22 no. 6), he was editor of the RSPB&#x27;s award-winning &quot;Birds&quot; magazine, having previously edited the young people&#x27;s award-winning version, &quot;Bird Life&quot;, at the RSPB&#x27;s headquarters, The Lodge.

Hume did his early birdwatching at Chasewater, Staffordshire, and was a member of the West Midland Bird Club. He spent several years studying at Swansea University, during which time he birdwatched regularly at Blackpill and on the Gower Peninsula.

He is a past member (and the fifth chairman) of the British Birds Rarities Committee; and a past member of the editorial board of&quot; British Birds&quot; magazine, but resigned both posts in 1997. His autobiography, &quot;Life With Birds&quot;, was published in September 2005.

His drawings of birds often appeared in West Midland Bird Club reports and a number of books and journals. He wrote and illustrated articles in the short-lived &quot;Midlands Birdwatcher&quot; quarterly magazine, five issues of which were published in late 1976 and 1977.

He has led wildlife holidays in various European countries, Israel and Africa and has birded widely in Europe, in India and Sri Lanka, Australia, the Caribbean and North America.

<text>Kivijärvi (; literally &quot;stone(y) lake&quot;) is a municipality of Finland. It is located in the Central Finland region. The municipality has a population of () and covers an area of of which is water. The population density is .

Neighbouring municipalities are Kannonkoski, Karstula, Kinnula, Kyyjärvi, Perho and Viitasaari. The municipality is unilingually Finnish.

The municipal coat of arms of Kivijärvi is inspired by a folktale related to Kivijärvi&#x27;s church. According to the story, the construction work of the first church building did not progress when all the work done during the day was mysteriously destroyed during the night. In that case, it was decided that the site of the church would be chosen by putting a rooster on the back of the lake to drift on top of the bottom log of the church, and where the rooster would land, the church of parish would be erected there. The coat of arms was designed by Gustaf von Numers and was approved for use on April 18, 1963.

==Nature==
There are all together 89 lakes in Kivijärvi. Biggest lakes are Kivijärvi, Heitjärvi and Heikinjärvi. Salamajärvi National Park is partly located in Kivijärvi.

== History ==
The toponym was first mentioned in 1554 as &quot;Kijuijerffuj ärmarch&quot;, referring to hunting grounds held by Tavastians. The village of Kivijärvi has existed at least since 1571, when it was a part of the large Rautalampi parish. It was transferred to the Viitasaari parish after its establishment in 1628. Kivijärvi became a chapel community in 1750 and fully independent from Viitasaari in 1864. Kinnula was separated from Kivijärvi in 1904, though it had had its own church since 1867. In 1934, parts of Kivijärvi and Viitasaari were separated in order to form the Kannonkoski municipality.
=== Suomenselkä municipality ===
Kannonkoski, Karstula, Kivijärvi and Kyyjärvi planned to merge into the from January 1, 2022. Karstula, Kivijärvi and Kyyjärvi accepted the merger proposal, but Kannonkoski did not. After Kannonkoski left the planned merger, Kivijärvi also left it. Later, the merger project of the remaining Karstula and Kyyjärvi also failed at the Kyyjärvi municipal council meeting held on May 17, 2021, and the Ministry of Finance does not propose a forced merger either.

<text>A financial analyst is a professional undertaking financial analysis for external or internal clients as a core feature of the job.

The role may specifically be titled securities analyst, research analyst, equity analyst, investment analyst, or ratings analyst.
The job title is a broad one:
 
In banking, and industry more generally, various other analyst-roles cover financial management and (credit) risk management, as opposed to focusing on investments and valuation.

==Role==
Financial analysts can work in a variety of industries. A large proportion of them are employed by mutual- and pension funds, hedge funds, securities firms, banks, investment banks, insurance companies, and other businesses, helping these companies or their clients make investment decisions. In corporate roles, financial analysts perform budget, revenue and cost modelling and analytics as part of their responsibilities; credit analysis is likewise a distinct area.

Financial analysts invariably use spreadsheets (and statistical software packages) to analyze financial data, spot trends, and develop forecasts. The analyst often also meets with company officials to gain a better insight into a company&#x27;s prospects and to determine the company&#x27;s managerial effectiveness.

Analysts specializing in advanced mathematical modeling and programming are referred to as &quot;quants&quot;; see for an overview, and for the various roles.

===Securities firms===
In a stock brokerage house or investment bank, the analyst will read company financial statements - applying financial statement analysis - and analyze commodity prices, sales, costs, expenses, and tax rates in order to determine a company&#x27;s value and project future earnings. On the basis of their results, they write reports and make presentations, usually making recommendations—a &quot;trade idea&quot;—to buy or sell a particular investment or security.

Typically, at the end of the assessment, an analyst would provide a rating recommending or investment action: to buy, sell, or hold the security. Senior analysts may actually make the decision to buy or sell for the company or client if they are the ones responsible for managing the assets. Other, &quot;junior&quot; analysts use the data to model and measure the financial risks associated with making a particular investment decision. See .

Usually, financial analysts study a specific industry—called &quot;sector specialists&quot;—assessing current trends in business practices, products, and industry competition. Among the industries with the most analyst coverage are biotechnology, financial services, energy, mining and resources, and computer hardware, software and services. Analysts must keep abreast of new regulations or policies that may affect the industry, as well as monitor the economy to determine its effect on earnings. As equity analysts divide securities by distinct sectors, companies which fall outside or across multiple sectors are sometimes neglected; the impact on returns (and on &quot;earnings management&quot;) here is debated.

Analysts also specialize in fixed income. Similar to equity analysts, &quot;fixed income analysts&quot; assess the value and analyze the risks of various securities, here focusing on interest rate- and fixed income securities, particularly bonds. They may further specialize, but here by issuer-type: i.e. municipal bonds, government bonds, and corporate bonds; the latter specialization is often decomposed into convertible bonds, high-yield bonds, and distressed bonds; some cover syndicated loans. The reporting focuses on the ability of the issuer to make payments—similar to the credit analysis described below—but also on the relative value of the security in question, and in context of the overall market and yield curve. See Fixed income analysis.

Analysts are generally divided into &#x27;sell-side&#x27; and &#x27;buy-side&#x27;. The buy-side is sometimes considered more prestigious, professional, and scholarly, while the sell-side may be higher-paid and more like a sales and marketing role. It is common to begin careers on the sell-side at large banks then move to the buy-side at a fund.

* A sell-side analyst&#x27;s work is not used by its employer to invest directly, rather it is sold either for money or for other benefits by the employer to buy-side organizations. Sell-side research is often used as &#x27;soft money&#x27; rather than sold directly, for example provided to preferred clients in return for business. Writing reports or notes expressing opinions is always a part of &quot;sell-side&quot; (brokerage) analyst job and is often not required for &quot;buy-side&quot; (investment firms) analysts. It is sometimes used to promote the companies being researched when the sell-side has some other interest in them, as a form of marketing, which can lead to conflicts of interest.
* A buy-side analyst, such as a fund manager, works for a company which buys and holds stocks itself, on the analyst&#x27;s recommendation. As they gain experience, analysts often move from buy-side research, concerning individual securities and sectors, into portfolio management itself, selecting the mix of investments for a company&#x27;s portfolio. They may also become fund managers and manage large investment portfolios for individual investors.

Typically, analysts use fundamental analysis principles, but technical analysis and tactical evaluation of the market environment are also routine. Analysts obtain information by studying public records and filings by the company, as well as by participating in public earnings calls where they can ask direct questions to the management. Additional information can be also received in small group or one-on-one meetings with senior members of management teams. However, in many markets such information gathering became difficult and potentially illegal due to legislative changes brought upon by corporate scandals in the early 2000s. One example is Regulation FD (Fair Disclosure) in the United States. Many other developed countries also adopted similar rules.

Analyst performance is ranked by a range of services such as StarMine owned by Thomson Reuters or Institutional Investor magazine. Research by Numis found that small companies with the most analyst coverage outperformed peers by 2.5 per cent — while those with low coverage underperformed by 0.7%.
See Neglected firm effect.

===Investment Banking===
Financial analysts in the investment banking departments of securities or banking firms often work in teams, analyzing the future prospects of companies, and selling shares to the public for the first time via an initial public offering (IPO), or issuing bonds; this task is often identical to that of a securities analyst. On this basis, they will then make presentations to prospective investors re the merits of investing in the new company, presenting their &quot;pitch books&quot; on a &quot;roadshow&quot;; see bookrunner and securities underwriting. An additional component of the IB role here: analysts ensure that all forms and written materials necessary for compliance with Securities and Exchange Commission regulations are accurate and complete.

Many IB analysts work in mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) departments, similarly preparing analyses on the costs and benefits of a proposed merger or takeover, and assisting with regulatory submissions; here there are both buy-side- and sell-side analysts. See . The analysis is somewhat more specialized than for an IPO, as it must consider valuation pre- and post-merger, a function of efficiencies, synergies, or increased market share, financing employed, including M&amp;A specific considerations such as the swap ratio, and tax optimization, both re the transaction and for the new entity.

At more senior levels, vice presidents (VPs) or Senior VPs will manage the workflow and deliverables—with modelling performed by Associate VPs—but not be involved in the line-by-line detail &quot;per se&quot;. Directors will be responsible for &quot;rainmaking&quot; and maintaining existing client relationships. The latter role incorporates a significant advisory element—guiding the client regarding their profile and exposure in the capital markets, and advising on M&amp;A and other corporate activity (and liaising with sales and trading).

Investment banks, and large trading houses, often employ an economics team or group. This team produces the economic forecasts informing the various valuations and overall investment strategy; see and Economic analyst.

====Middle office====
Within banking, there are other non-quant analyst roles (not necessarily titled &quot;financial analyst&quot;), mainly within the &quot;middle office&quot;; these are generally linked, at least by dotted line, to both the Finance and Risk Management areas.

* Corporate Treasury is responsible for an investment bank&#x27;s funding, capital structure management, and liquidity risk monitoring; see . It is then (co)responsible for the bank&#x27;s funds transfer pricing (FTP) framework, allowing for comparable financial performance evaluation among business units
* Product Control is primarily responsible for &quot;explaining&quot; the P&amp;L; i.e.: attributing returns to individual desks, decomposing these into their risk factors, and ensuring that traders&#x27; positions are reflected at their market values; the tools here are often built by a separate quant team, possibly front office, but maintained by Product Control.
* Credit Risk monitors the bank&#x27;s debt-clients on an ongoing basis, as described below; it is additionally responsible for tracking the risk capital and risk adjusted returns on these clients, and reporting re concentration risk and risk appetite.

These areas, together with the various dedicated Risk Groups, allow the Finance department to advise senior management regarding the firm&#x27;s global risk exposure and the profitability and structure of the firm&#x27;s various businesses; see .

A comptroller (or financial controller) is a senior position, responsible for these analyses and internal control more generally, usually reporting to the bank&#x27;s chief financial officer, as well as copying the chief risk officer.

===Corporate and other===
As outlined, the job title is a broad one, and analyst-roles also include financial management and (credit) risk management. 

====Financial planning and analysis====
Financial analysts within corporates provide inputs into all elements of the firm&#x27;s financial management.

* The short term focus is on working capital management, and includes tasks such as profitability analysis, cost analysis, variance analysis, and cash flow forecasting (often overlapping treasury management).
* Medium term elements are budgeting and planning; their models here form the basis for financial forecasting, scenario analysis (sometimes re corporate strategy), and balance sheet optimization. The latter, extends to involvement with dividend policy, and capital structure; relatedly, forecasts here also feed into group ALM.
* Analysts are also involved with long term &quot;capital budgeting&quot;, i.e. decisions relating to &quot;project&quot; selection and valuation and related funding considerations; these forecasts feed through to the debt capital markets team, &quot;DCM&quot;, responsible for securing and managing long-term funding. 
* Risk analytics will span all perspectives. Similar to treasury though, the team may reside in a separate unit; see Three lines of defence.

Management of these deliverables sits with the financial manager (FM); while budget analyst, cost analyst, treasury analyst or manager, risk analyst or manager and corporate finance analyst are often specialized roles. The area overall is sometimes referred to as &quot;FP&amp;A&quot; (Financial Planning and Analysis). The financial director or chief financial officer (FD, CFO) has primary responsibility for managing the company&#x27;s finances, including financial planning, management of financial risks, record keeping, and financial reporting.

====Credit analysts ====
There are several analyst roles related to credit risk, macro or micro. Ratings analysts (who are often employees of ratings agencies), evaluate the ability of companies or governments that issue bonds to repay their debt. On the basis of their evaluation, a management team assigns a rating to a company&#x27;s or government&#x27;s bonds. 

Financial analysts employed in commercial lending perform balance sheet analysis, examining the borrower&#x27;s audited financial statements and corollary data in order to similarly assess lending risks, and to confirm that yield is appropriate given risk; this task is both upfront and on a monitoring basis thereafter. The focus is on current and forecasted debt- and liquidity ratios generally, and specifically those related to any loan covenants, such as debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) and loan-to-value ratio (LTVR).

In retail banking, credit analysts build models to determine an applicant&#x27;s creditworthiness, assign an initial credit score, and monitor this and the loan on the basis of an ongoing &quot;behavioral&quot; score. In this and the latter role, impairment- and provision-modelling are a prominent deliverable (see IFRS 9); the probability of default (PD), exposure at default (EAD) and loss given default (LGD) statistics or models are (often) provided by a separate (but dedicated) credit-quant team.

====Accounting analysts ====
Some financial analysts specialize as accounting analysts; they will collect industry data (mainly balance sheet, income statement and capital adequacy in banking sector), merger and acquisition history and financial news for their clients. They then typically &quot;standardize&quot; the different companies&#x27; data, facilitating peer group analysis: the main objective here is to enable their clients to make better decisions about the investment across different regions. They also provide the abundance of financial ratios calculated from the data gathered from financial statements, and possibly other sources.

==Qualification==
===General===
In general,

a business-related bachelor&#x27;s degree majoring in Accounting, in Finance, or in Economics is a minimum requirement for an entry or junior role. Given the nature of the work, (some) proficiency in Excel is typically a recommendation (and analysts may be expected to learn database software &quot;on the job&quot;); see further under Financial Modeling.

With seniority, often, analysts are expected to earn an MBA, having gained 2–3 years experience in the junior role. Increasingly, it is preferred that, even to enter, analysts hold a Master of Finance degree.

More specific qualifications may be required additionally:

* In (senior) financial management roles, a professional accounting certification – the CPA, CA, CMA, or CIMA – is often a prerequisite; this, given the overlap with tax and financial reporting.
* Risk managers increasingly require the FRM / PRM, or an actuarial qualification such as CERA.
* Credit analysts in technical-roles may require these also (or at a minimum, specified math-credits); in commercial-lending roles, an industry certification, such as the CBA from the NACM may be specified.
* In treasury management roles, analysts often hold the ACT or CTP credential.

===Securities and Investment banking===
In securities and IB roles, it is lately preferred that, similarly, even to enter, analysts earn a Master of Finance or the CFA designation—in Europe, the CIIA also—with the MBA still common at senior levels.

Often, there are also regulatory requirements. For example, in the United States, sell-side or Wall Street research analysts must register with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). In addition to passing the &quot;General Securities Representative Exam&quot; (Series 7), these candidates must pass the &quot;Research Analyst Examination&quot; (Series 86/87) in order to publish research for the purpose of selling or promoting publicly traded securities.
For other jurisdictions, see List of securities examinations.

For sector specialists—with approximately five years industry experience—less weight is placed on finance qualifications, as a relevant advanced degree or qualification in the field is often necessary. (They will later be encouraged to earn the CFA, CIIA, or MBA.) For example, valuing financial service firms and valuing mining corporates requires specialized knowledge regarding their valuation-, regulatory-, and accounting standards; and, respectively, qualifications in actuarial science, and mining engineering or geology will then be required. Other sectors may similarly require specific technical qualifications: e.g. in pharmacy / life sciences for &quot;bio-tech&quot;; in electronic engineering for (some) areas in &quot;high tech&quot; (e.g. semiconductors).

Many large teams will also include a CPA or CA in a dedicated technical role. (In the Commonwealth, the CA qualification is often sufficient to access (junior) analyst roles.) Banks often also recruit analysts with accounting qualifications to the middle office roles. The economics team is usually led by a PhD in the discipline, while a masters in economics is the typical requirement to join the team.

<text>Sefanaia Sukanaivalu VC (1 January 1918 – 23 June 1944) was a Fijian soldier and a posthumous recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to Commonwealth forces. He is the only Fijian to be awarded the VC.

==Biography==
Sukanaivalu was born on Yacata, Fiji, on 1 January 1918 and joined the Fiji Infantry Regiment in 1942. By mid-1944, he was a corporal in the 3rd Battalion, which was taking part in the Bougainville campaign. He died under Japanese fire on 23 June 1944, at Mawaraka, during an attempt to rescue comrades, in circumstances which led to his being awarded the Victoria Cross.

The citation reads:

His body was eventually recovered by Australian forces assisted by members of the Fijian 1st Docks Company. Sukanaivalu was buried at Rabaul (Bita Paka) War Cemetery, New Britain, Papua New Guinea. In 2005, it was announced that there were plans to repatriate Sukanaivalu&#x27;s remains to Fiji.

<text>Unic was a French manufacturer founded in 1905, and active as an automobile producer until July 1938. After this the company continued to produce commercial vehicles, retaining its independence for a further fourteen years before being purchased in 1952 by Henri Pigozzi, who was keen to develop Unic as a commercial vehicle arm of the then flourishing Simca business.

==Origins==
Unic was founded by Georges Richard after he left Richard-Brasier. In 1905 Richard had a meeting with the entrepreneur-financier Baron Henri de Rothschild and obtained funding for the creation of the &quot;société anonyme des automobiles Unic&quot;, based at Puteaux. The objective was to manufacture &quot;unique&quot; (rather than mainstream) vehicles, and at the start the company made only light cars and taxis with two-cylinder and four-cylinder engines.

The taxi business would remain important to Unic for more than three decades, while Rothschild&#x27;s steady financial support through good times and bad, provided stability which sustained the business, critically during the immediate post-war years.

==Growth and diversification==
Although the manufacturer&#x27;s initial range was restricted to light cars, their popularity as taxis led to the production of delivery vans and other small utility style vehicles. The 1943 cc 12 CV (9 kW) four-cylinder model (used mainly as a taxi) was extremely successful and survived in production for nearly 20 years. (The engine was enlarged later to 2120 cc.) During World War I, taxis made by the company participated in the Marne operation. After World War I, a new four-cylinder (1847 cc) was offered, along with the taxis.

==First truck and founder&#x27;s death==
In 1922 the firm introduced a three-ton truck, called the Unic MSC, which marked the start of a switch towards production of larger commercial vehicles. 1922 was also the year when the founder of Unic, Georges Richard, died while awaiting transfer to a Paris clinic, following a motor accident en route to Rouen. Georges Dubois, hitherto in charge of vehicle testing, took on responsibility for the business.

==Passenger cars in the 1920s==
During the 1920s, a 1997 cc sports model was marketed and in some models sleeve valve engines were used.

By the time of the 19th Paris Motor Show, in October 1924, Unic were exhibiting three passenger cars. All had four cylinder engines, although large 4-cylinder engines such as that fitted in the 16HP model were by now seen as rather old fashioned:
* Unic &quot;Type L1T&quot; 10 CV/HP: 4-cylinder 1843 cc: wheelbase 
* Unic &quot;Type L3T&quot; 11 CV/HP: 4-cylinder 2000 cc: wheelbase 
* Unic 16 CV/HP: 4-cylinder 3450 cc: wheelbase 

Four years later, at the 22nd Paris Motor Show, only one of the two cars on show was fitted with a 4-cylinder engine. This was an evolution of the two-litre model exhibited in 1924, now branded as the Unic &quot;Type L9&quot;, with a wheelbase and usually fitted with &quot;Torpedo&quot; or &quot;Berline&quot; (saloon/sedan) bodies. However, for the 1929 model year attention was now focused on the company&#x27;s first 8-cylinder model. The new Unic 14 CV/HP &quot;Type H1&quot; featured a -litre straight-8 power unit and sat on a substantial wheelbase. It was priced at 55,000 francs in bare chassis form.

==Passenger cars in the 1930s==

The 8-cylinder Unic &quot;Type H1&quot; introduced in 1928 was progressively updated in accordance with the changing tastes of the time: by 1933 car had evolved into the Unic &quot;Type H3&quot; and the engine size had grown from litres to 2646 cc. October 1933 was nevertheless the last time an 8-cylinder passenger car would appear on the Unic show stand.

For the next few years the company focused on 4-cylinder cars in the 11 CV/HP tax band, just as they had through the mid-1920s. For 1934 Unic announced their new &quot;Type U4&quot; model, featuring a 2-litre side-valve engine and now also employing a 4-speed transmission. The body-work of the standard 5-seater &quot;berline&quot; (sedan/saloon) was no longer completely flat-backed, but the proportions of the car may have drawn criticism, since between the car&#x27;s October 1933 launch and May 1934, the rear overhang was slightly increased, while at the front a slightly raked grill replaced the flat one, and the overall profile became a little more streamlined. In addition to this passenger car, Unic continued to produce through 1934 a similarly sized taxi of &quot;great robustness&quot;.

==Final year of car production==
In March 1937 Unic updated their four-cylinder passenger car model for the last time, and for the 1937 October Motor Show the six-cylinder model was also given a more streamlined look, in line with the fashion of the time. By this time the passenger car range was down to just these two models. The Unic Type U4D was a four-cylinder 2,150 (12CV) car which featured overhead valves and offered a maximum output of , supported by a robust, rather traditional chassis with a wheelbase. The imposing six-cylinder Unic Type U6C provided from a 3,000 cc engine (17CV), transmitted via an electromagnetic &quot;Cotal&quot; preselector gear box, with a choice of wheelbase lengths between and .

The appeal of Unic passenger cars by this time derived not from technical brilliance nor from stunning originality. Those who appreciated the cars were impressed by excellent reliability resulting from a meticulous approach taken during the production process. Also admired were their elegant spacious bodies, most of which came from the coach builder Letourneur et Marchand or from their subsidiary, Autobineau. Unic cars by now were not being sold in large numbers and this was reflected in the price. At the 1937 Motor Show the standard steel-bodied Unic Type U-4 D with its 12CV engine was priced at 53,750 francs (or 35,500 francs in bare chassis form). The slightly more powerful 13CV Talbot Type T4 &quot;Minor&quot; was listed at 42,500 Francs (or 35,000 Francs in bare chassis form), while from the top end of the Citroën range a long wheel base &quot;familiale&quot; version of the Traction 11CV Longue could be had for 28,900 francs including the body, while prototype testing was already well under way of a 2867 cc (15/16CV) version of the aggressively priced and marketed Citroën Traction. Few customers in this class were willing to pay the price for the Unic&#x27;s virtues of dependability, style and space, and Unic passenger car production ceased in July 1938.

After 1938 Unic concentrated in the truck business, being one of the leading French makes. In 1966 it was taken over by the Italian company Fiat and eventually merged into Iveco in 1975.

== Post–World War II timeline ==

In 1952, the firm was taken over by Simca, headed by Henri Pigozzi, who wanted a commercial vehicle production unit. Trucks of this period are commonly referred to as Unic-Simca trucks.

In 1956 the French arm of the Swiss truck manufacturer Saurer was taken over.

In 1966 Unic joined the Fiat Group.

In 1975 a holding company named IVECO was established covering truck and bus brands such as Fiat, OM, Lancia, UNIC and Magirus.

In 1976 UNIC-FIAT S.A. became UNIC S.A.

In 1992 IVECO UNIC S.A. changed its name to IVECO FRANCE S.A.

In 2003, the company&#x27;s headquarters moved from Villejuif to Boissy St Léger, where a second facility was established in 1995.

<text>The National Shrine of Mary, Queen of Peace, also known as Mary, Queen of Peace Shrine, Our Lady of Peace Quasi-Parish and commonly known as the EDSA Shrine, is a small church of the Archdiocese of Manila located at the intersection of Ortigas Avenue and Epifanio de los Santos Avenue (EDSA) in Barangay Ugong Norte, Quezon City, Philippines. It is a declared Important Cultural Property by the National Commission for Culture and the Arts. Built in 1989 on donated land to commemorate the People Power Revolution, the shrine is the site of two peaceful demonstrations that toppled Presidents Ferdinand Marcos in 1986, and Joseph Estrada (the EDSA Revolution of 2001 or EDSA II). The EDSA Shrine is the northernmost tip of the Ortigas Center, a financial and commercial district occupying large tracts of land in Quezon City, Mandaluyong, and Pasig.

==History==
Cardinal-Archbishop Jaime Sin proposed the construction of a commemorative shrine two days after the Marcos family went into exile following the People Power Revolution of February 1986 which saw the deposing of President Ferdinand Marcos, the end of his authoritarian regime and the installation of Corazon Aquino as his successor. Sin made the proposal as an act of thanksgiving to the Virgin Mary to whom devout Catholics attribute the success of the peaceful revolution. The “Rosary miracle” honors the Holy Rosary of Our Lady of EDSA&#x27;s role in the peaceful victory.

The concept for a commemorative shrine developed when Sin and Bishop Gabriel Reyes were en route to Camp Aguinaldo to preside a Thanksgiving Mass. At a corner of Epifanio de los Santos and Ortigas Avenues, Reyes pointed out to Sin the site where a group of protesters, which included Catholic religious sisters, offered flowers to soldiers during the revolution. At an empty lot nearby stood two billboards that featured advertisements by the Family Rosary Crusade. The billboards showed the image of the Virgin Mary along with the slogans &quot;The family that prays together stays together&quot; and &quot;A world at prayer is a world at peace&quot;. The two clergymen concluded that the success of the revolution was a miracle that could be attributed to the intercession of the Virgin Mary. They compared the EDSA event to the success of the Battle of Lepanto and Battles of La Naval de Manila which also both ended in victories for the Catholic belligerents (i.e., the Venetians and Spaniards in Lepanto against the Muslim Ottomans and the Spaniards against the Protestant Dutch forces in Manila).

Cardinal Sin convinced the Ortigas and Gokongwei family to donate the corner lot where the EDSA Shrine now stands today The shrine was initially planned to be built inside Camp Crame, but plans were scrapped because churches built on government-owned property had to be ecumenical in nature.

EDSA Shrine was then constructed with Francisco Mañosa as architect. Leandro Locsin and William Coscolluela was also involved with the preparatory work of the building. The construction was almost finished by November 1989 and the shrine was set to be inaugurated by December 8, 1989, the date of the Feast of the Immaculate Conception. However such plans were interrupted by a coup attempt which began on November 29, 1989 by the Reform the Armed Forces Movement against President Corazon Aquino.

The coup attempt ended on December 7, 1989, and the inauguration went as planned which was never postponed by Cardinal Sin. The church was consecrated on December 15, 1989, and dedicated to the Virgin Mary on the same date. Socrates Villegas, then a priest, was installed as the church&#x27;s first rector.

When the Second EDSA Revolution was successful in deposing President Joseph Estrada in January 2001, Cardinal Sin declared the EDSA Shrine as holy ground, crediting the Virgin Mary to the event. A marker was installed on the anniversary of the 1986 People Power Revolution recognizing the shrine as a &quot;Holy Ground&quot;. At the facade is set of sculptures recalling the events of the First and Second People Power Revolutions, the latter which was held there at the shrine.

Other rallies and demonstrations held in the shrine were: Pro-Estrada rally (April 25 – May 1, 2001), protests against Reproductive Health Bill (August 4, 2012), &quot;EDSA Tayo&quot; rally against pork barrel (September 7, 2013), 2015 Iglesia ni Cristo protests (August 27–31, 2015) and &quot;Lord, Heal Our Land&quot; con-celebrated mass (November 5, 2017). In 2019, the National Commission for Culture and the Arts declared the church as an Important Cultural Property. 

On February 26, 2024, during Mass at the EDSA Shrine to mark the 38th anniversary of the People Power Revolution, Bishop Pablo Virgilio David, president of the Catholic Bishops&#x27; Conference of the Philippines (CBCP), stated that the EDSA Shrine was not only for the Archdiocese of Manila but for the entire country. On January 25, 2025, the CPCP was formally elevated to the status of a National Shrine.

== Dedication ==
Our Lady of Peace, &quot;Mother of Peace&quot;, &quot;Queen of Peace&quot; or &quot;Our Lady Queen of Peace&quot; is a title of the Blessed Virgin Mary in the Catholic Church. She is represented in art holding a dove and an olive branch – both traditional symbols of peace. The patronal image for this particular shrine is unique, as its design follows that of the statue atop the shrine roof. Mary, crowned and clad in golden robes, has her arms outstretched and her Immaculate Heart exposed, while two or three white doves rest at her hands and feet.

Her official memorial in the General Roman Calendar is on July 9 in the universal Church except for Hawaii and some churches in the United States, where it is kept on January 24.

==Architecture and design==
Francisco Mañosa was responsible for the architectural and structural design of the EDSA Shrine. The National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCAA) described Mañosa&#x27;s take on the building&#x27;s design as a &quot;modern take on Filipino architecture and adaptation of tropical architecture&quot;. The building is also noted for its &quot;neovernacular&quot; style and its distinguished &quot;native architectural forms and indigenous materials&quot; by architecture historian Gerard Lico.

The EDSA Shrine&#x27;s design consisted of a promenade, the People&#x27;s Plaza, with a statue of the Virgin Mary sculpted by Virginia Ty-Navarro as its focal point, and an underground church which was inspired from the Cathedral of Brasília.

Mañosa envisioned a different design from the existing building. The architect&#x27;s vision for the shrine, which he dubbed as the &quot;People&#x27;s Basilica&quot; is derived from the concept of the but on a larger scale. The initial design called for the use of seven pitched roofs clustered together which framed a statue of the Virgin Mary. However one influential member of the committee objected to the design preferring a Spanish colonial design for the EDSA Shrine which caused Mañosa to withdraw from the project but was convinced by Cardinal Jaime Sin to remain committed to the project and made the design for the current building.

==Our Lady of EDSA sculpture==

The sculpture of the Virgin Mary as the Our Lady of EDSA, Queen of Peace is a prominent feature of the EDSA Shrine. The committee behind the construction of the EDSA Shrine commissioned sculptor Virginia Ty-Navarro for the sculpture. Napoleon Abueva was initially considered for the sculpture design but Abueva was recovering from a stroke at that time. Manny Casal was the second choice who proposed a marble sculpture of the Virgin Mary with open arms comforting people of various backgrounds; lay people, clergy, children, and soldiers. Casal intended the sculpture to be done on-site. Abueva and Casal while not selected to sculpt the shrine&#x27;s main sculpture contributed other works installed within the shrine grounds.

Ty-Navarro sculpted the Virgin Mary sculpture in her studio in San Juan. The sculpture was transported to the shrine by helicopter with assistance from the United States embassy due to Ty-Navarro not anticipating that the road to the shrine is too narrow for the sculpture.

<text>Thomas &quot;Tommy&quot; Ricketts VC (April 15, 1901 – February 10, 1967) was a Newfoundland soldier and recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. Ricketts is the youngest army recipient fighting in a combatant role.

==Victoria Cross==
Ricketts, who was 17 years old and a private in the 1st Battalion, Royal Newfoundland Regiment during the First World War, was cited in the &quot;London Gazette&quot; for his actions on October 14, 1918.
King George V presented Ricketts with his VC at York Cottage on the Sandringham Estate on January 19, 1919. At the ceremony, the King reportedly stated: &quot;This is the youngest VC in my army.&quot; General Dighton Probyn, one of the oldest living VC holders at the time, was also present at the investiture.

While Ricketts is the youngest VC army recipient in a combatant role, he is not the youngest VC recipient. Hospital Apprentice Andrew Fitzgibbon and Drummer Thomas Flinn (who despite strictly being a non-combatant, received his VC for hand-to-hand combat during the Indian Mutiny), both aged 15, were awarded the VC in non-combatant roles. While Ricketts, Fitzgibbon and Flinn were all living VC recipients, Jack Cornwell of the Royal Navy was awarded the VC posthumously for his actions at the Battle of Jutland at age 16.

Ricketts was also awarded France&#x27;s Croix de Guerre with Golden Star in 1919.

==After the war==
After the war, Ricketts studied pharmacy, and opened a business on Water Street in St. John&#x27;s. He was the youngest living VC recipient from the time of his award until 1940.

Ricketts was given a state funeral when he died in 1967, and is commemorated by a memorial on the former site of his pharmacy. Ricketts is buried at the Anglican Cemetery, Forest Road, St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. Ricketts&#x27; medals are on display at The Rooms in St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland and Labrador.
Ricketts is sometimes erroneously referred to as having been a Canadian soldier during the First World War. Newfoundland was a self-governing dominion at the time and did not become a province of Canada until 1949.

The sports arena in Baie Verte is named in honour of Ricketts. In 2018, the &quot;Tommy Ricketts Memorial Peace Park&quot; opened in Conception Bay South.

A photo of Ricketts is used on the cover of the 2001 Anchor Canada edition of Pierre Berton&#x27;s &quot;Vimy&quot; paperback.

<text>Now That&#x27;s What I Call Music! (often shortened to NOW) is a series of various artists compilation albums released in the United Kingdom and Ireland by Sony Music and Universal Music (Universal/Sony Music) which began in 1983. Spinoff series began for other countries the following year, starting with South Africa, and many other countries worldwide soon followed, expanding into Asia in 1995, then the United States in 1998.

The compilation series was conceived in the office of Virgin Records in London and took its name from a 1920s British advertising poster for Danish bacon featuring a pig saying &quot;Now. That&#x27;s What I Call Music&quot; as it listened to a chicken singing. The pig became the mascot for the series, making its last regular appearance on &quot;Now That&#x27;s What I Call Music 5&quot;, before reappearing in 2018, and again since 2021.

==Original United Kingdom and Ireland series==

=== Conception of &quot;Now That’s What I Call Music!&quot; series ===
In 1983, the ideas of the Now That’s What I Call Music! series were conceived in Richard Branson&#x27;s Virgin Records offices, in Vernon Yard, near Portobello Road in Notting Hill, London. The co-creators behind this idea were Stephen Navin, Head of Licensing and Business Affairs at Virgin Records from 1979 to 1990, and Jon Webster, General Manager from 1983 to 1988. The concept found resonance with Simon Draper, the Managing Director of Virgin Records from 1979 to 1990.

Despite having so many songs high up in the charts, they were tired of third party labels using their hits and making money out of their success.

They managed to convince EMI, where Peter Jamieson, the Managing Director of EMI Records from 1983 to 1986, was captivated by Virgin’s innovative ideas on a compilation album. The partnership materialised during negotiations on Richard Branson’s boat in Little Venice.

==== The naming inspiration ====
Amidst the conception of the series, the name found its roots in a distinctive source. An old 1920s Danish Bacon poster featuring a pig saying &quot;Now, That&#x27;s What I Call Music&quot; as it listened to a chicken singing, discovered by Branson in an antiques shop not far from their Vernon yard office, where a woman he liked named Joan Templeman was working. 

Branson managed to amass an impressive collection of old hand painted tin signs that were covering his houseboat, but instead of adding to his collection, he gifted it to Simon Draper. The poster was hung behind Draper&#x27;s desk at the Virgin Records office. Branson wrote, &quot;He was notoriously grumpy before breakfast and loved his eggs in the morning, so I bought him the poster, framed it and had it hung behind his desk.&quot; 

The pig became the mascot for the series, making its last regular appearance on &quot;Now That&#x27;s What I Call Music 5&quot;, and made a reappearance on the cover of &quot;Now That&#x27;s What I Call Music! 100&quot; in 2018 and &quot;Now That&#x27;s What I Call Music! 109&quot; in 2021.

Notably, Richard Branson later married Joan Templeman in 1989. 
=== Commercial success ===
The first &quot;Now&quot; was released on 28 November 1983 and featured 30 UK hit singles from that year on a double vinyl LP or cassette. Although the compilation of recent hit songs into a single release was not a new concept (K-tel and Ronco, for example, had been issuing various-artist compilations for some years), this was the first time that two major record labels had collaborated on such a venture. Virgin agreed to a deal with EMI, which allowed a greater number of major hits to be included (the first album in the series included a total of &quot;eleven number ones&quot; on its sleeve). The album went to number one, and soon after, CBS/WEA&#x27;s &quot;The Hits Album&quot; adopted a similar format to &quot;Now&quot;. The two series co-existed for the rest of the 1980s, and when Universal (formerly PolyGram from &quot;Now 8&quot; in 1986 through to &quot;Now 42&quot; in 1999) joined the collaboration, the &quot;Now&quot; series was more successful commercially. The &quot;Out Now&quot; series by MCA and Chrysalis was also established as a rival to the series, but was short-lived and lasted only two volumes.

By 1989, &quot;Now&quot;, &quot;Hits&quot;, and other various-artist compilation albums were occupying such a large fraction of the UK Albums Chart that a separate UK Compilation Chart was created to restrict the Albums Chart to releases by a single act.

The rate of release settled very quickly to three per year: one release around late March/early April, another around late July and a third around late November. Over a hundred &quot;main series&quot; (not including spin-off and special edition) albums have been released to date. The UK series has followed a double-album format throughout the series (many other foreign franchises of the &quot;Now&quot; series are only released on one disc), now exploiting the capacity of the CD to include between 40 and 46 tracks over two discs. Since July 2006 (&quot;Now That&#x27;s What I Call Music! 64&quot;), the &quot;Now!&quot; series have only been released on CD and digital download formats. Previously, the series had been available on vinyl, cassette and MiniDisc, until these formats declined in popularity.

Peter Duckworth and Steve Pritchard have been managing the Now brand since &quot;Now 17&quot;. Mark Goodier has voiced the &quot;Now&quot; adverts since &quot;Now That&#x27;s What I Call Music! 21&quot; in 1992, when he worked for BBC Radio 1, with the exception of &quot;Now That&#x27;s What I Call Music! 95&quot; in 2016, which was voiced by Matt Edmondson due to Goodier suffering a stroke around that time. Ashley Abram of Box Music compiled the albums from &quot;Now That&#x27;s What I Call Music II&quot; in 1984 through to &quot;Now That&#x27;s What I Call Music! 81&quot; in 2012. Jenny Fisher took over as the compiler beginning with &quot;Now That&#x27;s What I Call Music! 82&quot;.

On 23 October 2013, the NOW Music television channel was launched in the UK. Targeting a broad age group, the channel used to play current popular music in the daytime and hits from its 30-year back catalogue in the evenings. It was renamed to Now 80s on 27 December 2016. Its success has led to two more branded channels exploring decades, Now 90s on 27 December 2017, replacing Chilled TV, and Now 70s on 27 December 2019, replacing Total Country.

=== Records/achievements ===
The most successful volume to date is 1999&#x27;s &quot;Now That&#x27;s What I Call Music! 44&quot;, which sold 2.3 million copies and remains the biggest-selling various artists compilation album in the UK. 2008&#x27;s &quot;Now That&#x27;s What I Call Music! 70&quot; sold 383,002 units in the first week of sales, the biggest ever first week sale of any &quot;Now&quot; album.

===Most featured artists===
As of July 2024, the most featured artists are Kylie Minogue with 34 followed by Robbie Williams with 31 singles, Calvin Harris with 32, David Guetta with 30, Rihanna with 27, Katy Perry with 22 and Girls Aloud with 21. This does not include any uncredited appearances in groups or on charity records.
== Formats ==
Although the albums started out on only vinyl records and cassette tapes, the formats on which the albums have been released have changed over the years:
*Unabridged (double CD) full versions of &quot;Now&quot; were first available starting with &quot;Now That&#x27;s What I Call Music 10&quot; in 1987, although a version of &quot;Now 4&quot; was released on CD featuring songs that had appeared on the vinyl and cassette configurations of &quot;Now&quot;s 2, 3 and 4. &quot;Now That&#x27;s What I Call Music 8&quot; (17 tracks) and &quot;Now That&#x27;s What I Call Music 9&quot; (16 tracks) were released as single disc CDs in 1986 and 1987, respectively. A &quot;Special Collectors Edition&quot; of Now 1 was released on CD in 2009 as a digipak, 2015 and again in 2018 as a jewel case album. 
*Vinyl editions of the main series ended in 1996 with &quot;Now That&#x27;s What I Call Music! 35&quot;, though there have been spin-offs such as &quot;NOW presents the 70s&quot;, released as a five LP vinyl boxset by Sony/EMI in 2021.
*MiniDiscs started with &quot;Now That&#x27;s What I Call Music! 43&quot; in 1999 and ended with &quot;Now That&#x27;s What I Call Music! 48&quot; in 2001.
*The first &quot;Now&quot; album to be released as a digital download was &quot;Now That&#x27;s What I Call Music! 62&quot; in 2005 across online music stores.
*Cassette tapes ceased in 2006 with the final cassette being &quot;Now That&#x27;s What I Call Music! 64&quot;.
*VHS tapes were released as companions to all the &quot;Now&quot; albums from the first volume through &quot;Now That&#x27;s What I Call Music! 20&quot;, except for &quot;Now! That&#x27;s What I Call Music 19&quot;. They contained music videos, some for tracks featured on the accompanying album and others for tracks not on the album. Some of the earlier volumes were also released on Betamax and for some volumes laserdiscs were also released.

== Spin-offs ==

In addition to the main &quot;Now That&#x27;s What I Call Music&quot; series, there have been a number of spin-off compilations in the UK using the name, including:
*&quot;Now Dance&quot; – a series in its own right, these compilations originally consisted of 12&quot; mixes of current hits. They now focus on radio mixes of recent dance hits, and a &quot;Very Best of Now Dance&quot; compilation has been released.
*At least two different series of year-by-year &quot;retrospective&quot; compilations, covering 1983 to 1995 and 1980 to 1999, respectively were issued in the 1990s with the latter series known as &quot;Now - The Millennium Edition&quot;. In June 2021, the &quot;Now Yearbook&quot; series was launched. Starting with 1983, the series will cover each year in depth via compilations released on a four-CD boxset and 3 disc coloured vinyl LP set by Now Music, with a tie-in programme (featuring videos from the year in question) appearing on their Freeview TV channel. The original &quot;Now Yearbook 1983&quot; could be initially ordered as a special book-style CD boxset, with the title joined a few months later by a standard CD boxset called &quot;Now Yearbook Extra 1983&quot; which promised &#x27;60 more essential hits from 1983&#x27;, and tracks like Kenny Everett&#x27;s &quot;Snot Rap&quot;, Roman Holliday&#x27;s &quot;Don’t Try to Stop It&quot; and &quot;Friday Night&quot; by the Kids from &quot;Fame&quot;. 
*At least five &quot;best-of&quot; compilations including selected songs from the entire &quot;Now&quot; series. &quot;Now Decades&quot;, &quot;Now Years&quot;, &quot;Now 25 Years&quot;, &quot;Now 30 Years&quot;, and &quot;Now That’s What I Call Now! (100 Hits from 100 Nows)&quot; are these five albums, but there have been other albums, like &quot;Now No. 1&#x27;s&quot;, which also cover the entire &quot;Now&quot; series.
*At least one tie-up with &quot;Smash Hits&quot; magazine in 1987, called &quot;Now Smash Hits&quot;. (&quot;Smash Hits&quot; later went on to release their own compilations).
*Christmas releases, including some classic Christmas favourites.
*Genre-based spin-offs are normally issued in the 2020s as 4CD sets, though &quot;Now That&#x27;s What I Call Punk &amp; New Wave&quot; is due to be issued as a limited edition 2LP neon pink vinyl set with 34 songs from the standard compilation&#x27;s 89 tracks.
*Sometimes considered a spin-off, video releases, including video cassette editions of many early &quot;Now&quot; compilations, and (more recently) yearly DVD video releases.
*Other releases include &quot;Now Karaoke&quot; and the interactive DVD &quot;Now That&#x27;s What I Call A Music Quiz&quot;.
*A series of compilation video games (for the Commodore 64, among other home computers) were released in the mid-1980s by Virgin Games with the name &quot;Now Games&quot;.
*A Wii game was released on 2 December 2011 named &quot;Now That&#x27;s What I Call Music! - Dance and Sing&quot;. It features tracks by popular artists of the time, including Alexandra Burke, Jessie J, Lady Gaga, Rihanna, Tinie Tempah, Calvin Harris and Plan B. It features a Dance Mode, Sing Mode and Career Mode.
* In fall 2024, &quot;Now That&#x27;s What I Call a Musical!&quot;, a jukebox musical based on the album series, made its stage debut.

== Record labels ==
The record labels which make up the UK series have changed over the years but have always been controlled by EMI and Virgin Records, although Virgin Records&#x27; logo was last featured on &quot;Now! 74&quot; as the companies became merged. The current entity controlling the series is Now That&#x27;s What I Call Music LLP, a joint venture between Sony Music and Universal&#x27;s EMI label (the old EMI/Virgin/PolyGram bloc). 
*Virgin Records: a label from &quot;Now 1&quot; to &quot;Now 74&quot;. Until &quot;Now That&#x27;s What I Call Music! 61&quot;, they used just the &quot;Virgin&quot; logo. From that volume onwards, the &quot;Virgin Records&quot; logo was used.
*EMI: a label on all volumes. Until &quot;Now 75&quot;, the logo they used was simply the &quot;EMI&quot; logo. From that volume onwards, &quot;EMI TV&quot;&#x27;s logo was used instead.
*PolyGram: a label from &quot;Now That&#x27;s What I Call Music 8&quot; to &quot;Now That&#x27;s What I Call Music! 42&quot;.
*Universal Music: a label from &quot;Now That&#x27;s What I Call Music! 43&quot; onwards as a result of acquiring the Polygram label.
*Box Music Ltd.: were involved between 1984 and 2012, but it was &quot;Now That&#x27;s What I Call Music! 26&quot; onwards that their logo was used on the packaging.
*Music from EMI logo: It was used &quot;Now That&#x27;s What I Call Music! 62&quot; until &quot;Now 85&quot; when they used the Sony label instead, until &quot;Now 90&quot; when they stopped using labels on the main series.
*Sony BMG: used on the special edition of the album, &quot;Now! No.1s&quot;
*Universal Music Group (UMG): UMG purchasing of EMI in 2012, rights to a portion of the &quot;Now&quot; albums were transferred to Sony Music Entertainment (a partner in the original &quot;Hits Album&quot; brand). For a period, UMG used the brand of their catalog subsidiary, Universal Music TV (UMOD), on the &quot;Now&quot; series. However, by the 2020s, the EMI brand reappeared on certain &quot;Now&quot; spin-offs, including like &quot;Now Yearbook ’83 Extra&quot;, &quot;Now That’s What I Call Christmas&quot; and the re-issued &quot;Now That’s What I Call Music 10&quot;.
* &quot;Walt Disney Records&quot;: the label that released &quot;Now That&#x27;s What I Call Disney.&quot;

<text>Bapsfontein is a farming town in Ekurhuleni, South Africa, and falls into the Elandsvlei Conservancy area. It is situated at the intersection of the R25 and R50 roads. The area is known for its variety of birds as it is directly on the International Bird Route. The surrounding areas are made up of pristine grasslands and many pans are found in the area. Wetlands are protected in this area. Bapsfontein forms part of the catchment area for many essential rivers and dams.

Bapsfontein is approximately east-north-east of Kempton Park and approximately north-north-east of Benoni. It is zoned as an agricultural area, with a small peri-urban town. Nest Park falls within the Bapsfontein border. Nest Park is made up of approx 255 small farms and is a small village with friendly residents . Village life is although very peaceful also very active and there are annual potjiekos competitions, garden walks and other community events on the go during the year.

During the first half of 2004 various sinkholes appeared, as a result of too much groundwater being pumped out by vegetable farmers in the area.

Found in the area are approximated 19 sinkholes. The soil is dolomitic and high in lime, which makes it very fertile for crop farming. There are many horse owners in the area as there are many outrides and trails to explore.

<text>The Newcomen Society is an international learned society that promotes and celebrates the history of engineering and technology. It was founded in London in 1920, and takes its name from Thomas Newcomen, one of the inventors associated with the early development of the steam engine and who is widely considered the &quot;father of the Industrial Revolution&quot;. An early president was Loughnan St. L. Pendred.

The society is concerned with all branches of engineering: civil, mechanical, electrical, electronic, structural, aeronautical, marine, chemical and manufacturing as well as biography and invention.

The Newcomen Society is based at the Science Museum in London. There are regional branches in England: Midlands (Birmingham), North West (Manchester), North East (Newcastle), Western (Bristol) and Southern (Portsmouth), South Yorkshire (Sheffield) and one in Scotland (Glasgow and Edinburgh).

It publishes the &quot;International Journal for the History of Engineering and Technology&quot; (formerly the &quot;Transactions of the Newcomen Society&quot;) and &quot;Newcomen Links&quot;, a quarterly newsletter. An online archive of previous &quot;Transactions&quot; is available to members. The society also has a YouTube Channel with videos of meetings, conferences and online lectures.

The motto of the Society is the Latin &quot;actorum memores simul affectamus agenda&quot;, meaning &quot;mindful of things that have taken place, at the same time we strive after things yet to be done&quot;. The choice of a griffin regardant for the logo was to symbolise vigilance and looking backward while going forward.

The Newcomen Society is a registered charity and a limited company.

An American branch was established in 1923, but the Newcomen Society of the United States was entirely separate from its UK counterpart. The American group disbanded in 2007.

<doc id="782304" wikidata="Q3010684" url="?curid=782304" title="Kanara">
<text>Kanara or Canara, also known as Karāvali, is the historically significant stretch of land situated by the southwestern Konkan coast of India, alongside the Arabian Sea in the present-day Indian state of Karnataka. The subregion comprises three civil districts, namely: Uttara Kannada, Udupi, and Dakshina Kannada. Kasaragod was included prior to the States Reorganisation Act.

== Etymology ==
According to historian Severino da Silva, the ancient name for this region is &quot;Parashurama Srushti&quot; (creation of Parashurama). According to him and Stephen Fuchs, the name &quot;Canara&quot; is the invention of Portuguese, Dutch, and English people who visited the area for trade from the early sixteenth century onwards. The Bednore Dynasty, under whose rule this tract was at that time, was known to them as the Kannada Dynasty, i.e., the dynasty speaking the Kannada language. &quot;Karāvalli&quot;, the Kannada word for &#x27;coast&#x27;, is the term used by Kannada-speakers to refer to this region. The letter &#x27;d&#x27; being always pronounced like &#x27;r&#x27; by the Europeans, the district was named by them as &#x27;Canara&#x27; (a corruption of the word &quot;Kannada&quot;). This name was retained by the British after their occupation of the district in 1799, and has remained ever since. However, they also say that this issue is controversial.

== History ==

Since antiquity, much of the Canara coast (now spelled as &#x27;Kanara&#x27;) occupied a culturally distinct area known as Tulu Nadu. Historically, Tulu Nadu lay between the Gangavalli River in the north and the Chandragiri River in the south. Currently, Tulu Nadu consists of the Udupi and Dakshina Kannada districts of Karnataka, and the Manjeshwaram taluk of Kerala. The Uttara Kannada district in general is considered to be the southernmost part of the Konkan coast. Specifically, the littoral region north of the Gangavalli River is traditionally included in the Konkan.

The Portuguese occupied Kanara from 1498–1763. During this period, the geographical extent of Canara stretched from the southern banks of the Kali River in Karwar in the north to the northern banks of the Chandragiri River in Kasaragod in the south.

In 1799, after the conclusion of the Fourth Mysore War, the British took over the region and established the Canara district of the Madras Presidency. The district was bifurcated into the North and South Canara districts in 1859. The North Canara (also sometimes cited as &#x27;North Kanara&#x27;) district was transferred to the Bombay Presidency whereas the South Canara (also sometimes referred as &#x27;South Kanara&#x27;) district remained under the jurisdiction of the Madras Presidency. South Canara encompassed the undivided territory of the contemporary Udupi, Dakshina Kannada, and Kasaragod districts.

After India&#x27;s independence in 1947, the Bombay Presidency was reconstituted as the Bombay State. Following the States Reorganisation Act, 1956, the southern portion of Bombay State was added to Mysore State, which was renamed Karnataka in 1972. Kasaragod was included in Kerala. Subsequently, North and South Canara were renamed Uttara Kannada and Dakshina Kannada respectively. In 1997, Udupi district was carved out of the bigger Dakshina Kannada district.

== Geography ==
The Kanara region forms the coast of Karnataka situated on the south-western portion of Peninsular India. Coastal Karnataka forms the northern segment of the Malabar coast. Kanara constitutes an area of about 10,000 square kilometres (4,000 square miles). It is bounded by Konkan to the north, the Western Ghats to the east, the Kerala Plains to the south, and the Arabian Sea to the west. It stretches from north to south for about 225 kilometres (140 miles) and has a maximum width of about 64 kilometres (40 miles) in the south.

== Civil administration ==

Contemporary Kanara extends from the village of Majali in the north to the village of Talapady in the south. The three districts in the region: Uttara Kannada, Udupi, and Dakshina Kannada have their capitals in Karwar, Udupi, and Mangalore respectively.

== Demographics ==

The Kanara region have 3 Districts: Uttara Kannada, Udupi, and Dakshina Kannada. The combined population of these districts, according to the 2011 Census is about 47,04,179 . 

=== Languages ===

The main languages that are closely associated with the Kanara region are Kannada, Konkani and Tulu.

== Notes ==
 Konkan is now held to include all the land which lies between the Western Ghats and the Indian Ocean, from the latitude of Daman on the north to that of Terekhol, on the Goa frontier, on the south. Although most sources generally assign Kanara (Karavali) to the Malabar Coast, some other sources consider it to be a subterritory of the Konkan Coast. Consequently, this segment is thought to overlap the Konkan and Malabar Coast continuum; and usually corresponds to the southernmost and northernmost stretches of these locales respectively.

<text>Marathwada () is a proposed state and geographical region of the Indian state of Maharashtra. It was formed during the Nizam&#x27;s rule and was part of the then Hyderabad State. The region coincides with the Aurangabad division of Maharashtra. It borders the states of Karnataka and Telangana, and it lies to the west of the Vidarbha and east of Uttar Maharashtra regions of Maharashtra. The largest city of Marathwada is Aurangabad. Its people speak Marathi and Deccani Urdu (Hyderabadi Urdu). 

Marathwada is known for its struggle for merger in the Maharashtra state, which is commemorated on 17 September as Marathwada Liberation Day.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;Marathwada&quot; means &quot;the house of Marathi speaking people&quot;, that is land occupied by the Marathi-speaking population of the former Hyderabad state during the period of Nizam&#x27;s rule. The term can be traced to 18th century state records of the Nizam of Hyderabad.

==Demographics==

Marathwada has total area of 64590 km2 and had a population of 18,731,872 at the 2011 census of India.

===Languages===
At the time of the 2011 Census of India, the territory making up Marathwada had a variety of languages. 77.98% of the population spoke Marathi, 9.56% Urdu, 6.49% Hindi and 3.20% Lambadi as their first language.

===Religion===

Hinduism is the majority religion in Marathwada, with Islam and Buddhism being significant minorities. Sikhism has a significant presence in Nanded, meanwhile Jains are present in urban areas of Marathwada such as Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar, Jalna and Dharashiv.

At the time of the 2011 Census of India, 76.67% of the population of Marathwada followed Hinduism, 15.12% Islam, 7.17% Buddhism, 0.22% Christianity and the remaining 0.82% of the population followed other religions or stated no religion.

==Under Nizams rule==
The region of Hingoli and Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar were a major hub for the military stations and depot during the time of Nizam as well as during the British rule. Also Hyderabad State took special work to build Dams, modify and renovate the existing underwater system, particularly in Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar. Major works were undertaken to build railways (Nizam&#x27;s Guaranteed State Railway) connecting the city of Hyderabad to Bombay (now Mumbai) via Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar. Handlooms and paper factories were established in Kaghzipura near Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar. Religious sites were developed in Khuldabad.

Temporary guest houses were built for Sikh devotees in Nanded which lies in ruins due to neglect by the government authorities. Also roads connecting to Ahmedabad were initiated.

==Cities and districts==
===Major cities of Marathwada region===
All the cities below have population of more than 100,000 with Aurangabad having 1.1 million inhabitants per the 2011 census.
*Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar

There are Municipal Corporations at , Nanded-Waghala Municipal Corporation, Latur Municipal Corporation, Parbhani Municipal Corporation and Jalna Municipal Corporation. Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar Municipal corporation

==Tourism==




The state government recognises Aurangabad as the &quot;Tourism Capital of Maharashtra&quot;. There are various tourist attractions in Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar. Other places visited by tourists are:
==Education==

Marathwada has four government medical colleges, situated at Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar, Latur, Nanded and Ambajogai.
The region also has good government engineering colleges such as SGGS Nanded, Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar Government Engineering College.
It also has three major universities, being Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar Marathwada University at Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar, Vasantrao Naik Marathwada Agricultural University at Parbhani, and Swami Ramanand Teerth Marathwada University at Nanded.

The foundation of agricultural research in Marathwada region of Hyderabad state was laid by the 7th Nizam of Hyderabad &quot;Mir Osman Ali Khan&quot; with the commencement of the Main Experimental Farm in 1918 in Parbhani. During the Nizam&#x27;s rule agricultural education was available only at Hyderabad; crop research centers for sorghum, cotton and fruits existed in Parbhani. After independence, this facility was developed further by the Indian government which was renamed as Marathwada Agriculture University on 18 May 1972. The Institute of Chemical Technology, Mumbai (formerly known as UDCT) has a satellite campus located in Jalna which was established in 2018.

==Droughts and suicide of farmers==
Marathwada is affected by frequent anomalies in rainfall during Monsoon season, which accounts for almost 80 percent of the annual rainfall. The average annual rainfall over the division is 882 mm. Almost three-fourths of the Marathwada division is covered by farmlands. Hence, drought continues to have a considerable impact on the life of farmers.

In some Marathwada districts recurring droughts have forced people to drink fluoride-contaminated groundwater from borewells which has inflicted debilitating fluorosis on many.

The region also sees high instances of farmer suicides. According to government records, 422 farmers in Marathwada committed suicide in 2014. This was because of their inability to bear crop losses and a financial quandary made acute by water scarcity and an agrarian crisis. 2014 was the third consecutive year of low rainfall, and when rainfall did occur it was sometimes untimely and damaged crops. Of the 422 suicides, 252 cases were due to an inability to repay agricultural loans. There have been more than 117 farmer suicides in the first two months of 2017. According to a study by IIT Bombay, the severe or extreme droughts have frequently occurred in major portions of Marathwada, in the last few decades.

<doc id="782310" wikidata="Q3743627" url="?curid=782310" title="Geological hazard">
<text>A geologic hazard or geohazard is an adverse geologic condition capable of causing widespread damage or loss of property and life. These hazards are geological and environmental conditions and involve long-term or short-term geological processes. Geohazards can be relatively small features, but they can also attain huge dimensions (e.g., submarine or surface landslide) and affect local and regional socio-economics to a large extent (e.g., tsunamis).

Sometimes the hazard is instigated by the careless location of developments or construction in which the conditions were not taken into account. Human activities, such as drilling through overpressured zones, could result in significant risk, and as such mitigation and prevention are paramount, through improved understanding of geohazards, their preconditions, causes and implications. In other cases, particularly in montane regions, natural processes can cause catalytic events of a complex nature, such as an avalanche hitting a lake and causing a debris flow, with consequences potentially hundreds of miles away, or creating a lahar by volcanism.

Marine geohazards in particular constitute a fast-growing sector of research as they involve seismic, tectonic, volcanic processes now occurring at higher frequency, and often resulting in coastal sub-marine avalanches or devastating tsunamis in some of the most densely populated areas of the world 

Such impacts on vulnerable coastal populations, coastal infrastructures, offshore exploration platforms, obviously call for a higher level of preparedness and mitigation.

==Speed of development==

===Sudden phenomena===
Sudden phenomena include:
* avalanches (snow or rock) and its runout
* earthquakes and earthquake-triggered phenomena such as tsunamis
* forest fires (espec. in Mediterranean areas) leading to deforestation
* geomagnetic storms
* gulls (chasms) associated with cambering of valley sides
* ice jams (Eisstoß) on rivers or glacial lake outburst floods below a glacier
* landslide (displacement of earth materials on a slope or hillside)
* mudflows (avalanche-like muddy flow of soft/wet soil and sediment materials, narrow landslides)
* pyroclastic flows
* rockfalls, rock slides, (rock avalanche) and debris flows
* torrents (flash floods, rapid floods or heavy current creeks with irregular course)
*liquefaction (settlement of the ground in areas underlain by loose saturated sand/silt during an earthquake event)
* volcanic eruptions, lahars and ash falls.

===Slow phenomena===
Gradual or slow phenomena include:
* alluvial fans (e.g. at the exit of canyons or side valleys)
* caldera development (volcanoes)
* geyser deposits
* ground settlement due to consolidation of compressible soils or due to collapseable soils (&quot;see also compaction)
* ground subsidence, sags and sinkholes
* sand dune migration
* shoreline and stream erosion
* thermal springs

==Evaluation and mitigation==
Geologic hazards are typically evaluated by engineering geologists who are educated and trained in interpretation of landforms and earth process, earth-structure interaction, and in geologic hazard mitigation. The engineering geologist provides recommendations and designs to mitigate for geologic hazards. Trained hazard mitigation planners also assist local communities to identify strategies for mitigating the effects of such hazards and developing plans to implement these measures. Mitigation can include a variety of measures:
* Geologic hazards may be avoided by relocation. Publicly available databases, via searchable platforms, can help people evaluate hazards in locations of interest.
* Mapping geohazards using conventional or remote sensing techniques can also help identify suitable areas for urban development.
* The stability of sloping earth can be improved by the construction of retaining walls, which may use techniques such as slurry walls, shear pins, tiebacks, soil nails or soil anchors. Larger projects may use gabions and other forms of earth buttress.
* Shorelines and streams are protected against scour and erosion using revetments and riprap.
* The soil or rock itself may be improved by means such as dynamic compaction, injection of grout or concrete, and mechanically stabilized earth.
* Additional mitigation methods include deep foundations, tunnels, surface and subdrain systems, and other measures.
*Planning measures include regulations prohibiting development near hazard-prone areas and adoption of building codes.

== Earth observation of geohazards ==
In recent decades, Earth Observation (EO) has become a key tool in geohazards management, including preparedness, response, recovery, and mitigation. By leveraging remote sensing technologies, often supported by ground surveys, EO provides critical information to researchers, decision-makers, and planners. It has revolutionized our ability to map and monitor geohazards with precision and timeliness.

== In paleohistory ==
Eleven distinct flood basalt episodes occurred in the past 250 million years, resulting in large volcanic provinces, creating lava plateaus and mountain ranges on Earth. Large igneous provinces have been connected to five mass extinction events. The timing of six out of eleven known provinces coincide with periods of global warming and marine anoxia/dysoxia. Thus, suggesting that volcanic CO2 emissions can force an important effect on the climate system.

==Known hazards==

* 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami
* 2008 Sichuan earthquake
* 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami
* The Barrier (located in Garibaldi Provincial Park)
* Usoi Dam a natural landslide dam

<doc id="782313" wikidata="Q2257157" url="?curid=782313" title="Shoreham, Kent">
<text>Shoreham is a village and civil parish in the Sevenoaks District of Kent, England. It is located 5.2 miles north of Sevenoaks.

The probable derivation of the name is &quot;estate at the foot of a steep slope&quot;. Steep slope was from the Saxon word &quot;scor&quot;. pronounced &quot;shor&quot;, but written &quot;sore&quot; by Norman scribes.

The village of Shoreham contains three traditional independent pubs: The Samuel Palmer (formally Ye Olde George Inn), The King&#x27;s Arms and the Crown; with The Rising Sun in nearby Twitton.

==History==
The Darent valley was one of the major areas of Stone Age settlement; Shoreham is not mentioned in the Domesday Book.

In 1668, cricket was mentioned in a court case as being played at Shoreham, one of the sport&#x27;s earliest references.

It was also known as a smuggling area. 

Shoreham was the most bombed parish in the United Kingdom during the Second World War. The reasons for this is not clear but more than likely a combination of several factors - the Army took over several manor houses for operational use, there was a dummy airfield situated nearby at Lullingstone designed specifically to fool the Luftwaffe, and Fort Halstead was also nearby. Quite often, bomber crews would jettison their bombs having missed their primary target or if they were intercepted by the RAF on the way to London. 

Papermaking was once a local industry; the mill finally closed in 1928.

==War memorial==
Shoreham was the birthplace and home of Private Thomas Highgate, who was the first British soldier to be shot for desertion during the First World War on 8 September 1914, following the Battle of and Retreat from Mons. In 2000, when the memorial was being refurbished, Shoreham Parish Council voted not to inscribe Highgate&#x27;s name, although a space was left allowing for its inclusion at a later date. In 2006, a posthumous pardon led to some calls for Highgate&#x27;s details to be added.

The war memorial is incomplete. It has been established that at least one of its fallen, George Arthur Rouse (brother of Percy Aslin, marked on the memorial, both sons of Harriet Rouse, as recorded in the 1901 census), is missing. One hundred years after he died, an effort to have George added was underway.

Opposite the church, and in a direct sight line from the war memorial, is the Shoreham Memorial Cross. The cross was cut into the chalk hillside in 1920 in remembrance of the men of Shoreham killed during the First World War. The cross is referenced in the inscription on the war memorial, which reads; ‘SHOREHAM/KENT/REMEMBER/AS YOU LOOK/AT/THE CROSS/ON THE HILL/THOSE/WHO GAVE/THEIR LIVES/FOR/THEIR COUNTRY/1914-1919’. The memorial is a Grade II listed structure. The Shoreham Cross was designated a Scheduled monument in October 2021.

==Shoreham Aircraft Museum==
The official opening of the Shoreham Aircraft Museum in 1978 was attended by fifteen former Battle of Britain pilots. It pays lasting tribute to all those airmen who fought in the skies over southern England during World War II and houses a substantial collection of aviation relics excavated by the group over many years from sites of crashed British and German aircraft, as well as items which have been donated.

Run by local enthusiasts, the museum is largely funded by proceeds made by visitors whose donations contribute to the recovery and preservation of the artefacts.
The Battle of Britain brought the village of Shoreham directly into the war when on 15 September 1940, a Dornier Do 17Z, part of a force of about 100 German bombers approaching London, was shot down shortly before noon. The invading formation had been challenged by nine RAF squadrons and the battle developed into a series of individual &#x27;dogfights&#x27;. The unfortunate pilot of the Dornier was forced to land in a field at Castle Farm, with a Spitfire circling overhead, its cockpit canopy open, and its pilot waving a handkerchief, to signal a warning to the growing crowd of hop-pickers nearby to stay away until the Shoreham Home Guard arrived to recover the German crew. Feldwebel Heitsch, the pilot, and Feldwebel Pfeiffer, the observer, were taken to a nearby pub where they were bought a drink before being driven to Sevenoaks Police Station. The museum holds a collection of photographs of the Dornier, along with items taken from the wreckage at the time.

==Shoreham duck race==
The Duck Race is a long-running event in the village. It is held each year, on the May Day bank holiday. Entrants pay a small fee (usually £1) to enter their &#x27;duck&#x27; into the race. The duck has to travel along the river Darent from the war memorial in the village, to the bridge before the old Mill. A &#x27;duck&#x27; can be anything from a shop-bought rubber duck to a model made by the entrant(s). Actual ducks are forbidden. It is a large event in the village and several hundred people turn out each year to line the riverbanks and watch. Anyone can enter and there is a prize for the &#x27;Best Duck in Show&#x27; (awarded before the race begins) and the &#x27;First placed Duck.&#x27; The money raised goes towards charitable organisations in the village.

==Television==
The &quot;Showdown&quot; kitchen featured in the BBC programme &quot;The Big Family Cooking Showdown&quot; is a converted barn in Shoreham.

==Notable events==
On 29 September 1934, Airspeed Courier G-ACSY of London, Scottish &amp; Provincial Airways Ltd crashed just north of Shoreham, at the bottom of Cockerhurst Road. The aircraft was on a scheduled international passenger flight from Paris to Croydon Airport and all four people on board were killed.

<doc id="782315" wikidata="Q425733" url="?curid=782315" title="Kodisjoki">
<text>Kodisjoki is a tiny village and a former municipality of Finland. At the time of the municipality&#x27;s disestablishment, Kodisjoki was located in the province of Western Finland, now it is in the Satakunta region. Kodisjoki became part of the city of Rauma in 2007.

The municipality was unilingually Finnish.

== Geography ==
Kodisjoki bordered Rauma, Lappi, Laitila and Pyhäranta. Until 1997, it bordered Rauman maalaiskunta instead of Rauma.
=== Villages ===
Officially Kodisjoki only had a single village, also called Kodisjoki. The village consists of multiple parts: Ahteri, Heikolankulma, Heinilä, Isopuoli, Sahankulma, Vuorela and Ylöjänpää.

== History ==
Kodisjoki was first mentioned in 1504 as a part of the Laitila parish. Its name is derived from a dialectal word &quot;kodiksin/kodismaa&quot; referring to a garden or a small field next to a house. The name of Kodjala in Laitila has a similar etymology. Kodisjoki became a separate municipality in 1896, but due to its small size, it was still ecclesiastically subordinate to Laitila.

Kodisjoki was consolidated with the town of Rauma in 2007.

==History==
It is believed that the Iron Age town of Teljä was located next to the Kokemäenjoki river at Kokemäki. The oldest stone carving yet found in Finland, dated at 8,000 to 9,000 years old, was discovered in nearby Huittinen in 1903. The 10 cm elk&#x27;s head is in a permanent exhibition at the National Museum of Finland in the capital, Helsinki. Archeological finds from in and around Kokemäki have been dated to the Middle Ages.

Kokemäki is thought to have been founded in the 12th century, maybe even earlier. The Kokemäki parish was established in 1324. While part of the Kingdom of Sweden, the administrative area (slottslän) of Kumogård (Kokemäenkartano) was created in 1331. Kokemäki served as the administrative centre of the historical province of Satakunta until 1634. The Medieval Kokemäki Castle was demolished in 1367.

The medieval trading route of Huovintie goes from Turku, by Kokemäki and the river of Kokemäenjoki. Along the Huovintie were guild houses where travellers could stay overnight. This was located near the Kokemäki church.

The legend states that in 1156 Bishop Henry of Uppsala visited Satakunta on a preaching tour as a part of Eric IX of Sweden&#x27;s first crusade to Finland. St. Henry&#x27;s Chapel is a neogothic style brick chapel one kilometre east of the town centre of Kokemäki. The chapel was built in 1857 on the site of a medieval wooden granary which was used by Bishop Henry. It is possible that the original building dates back to between the 12th and 15th century, making it the oldest remaining wooden building in Finland.

Kokemäki was granted a town charter in 1869.

During the Revolution of 1918 some one-hundred-fifty-three individuals were killed in the municipality of Kokemäki.

<doc id="782319" wikidata="Q2445534" url="?curid=782319" title="Paithan">
<text>Paithan (), historically Pratiṣṭhāna , is a town with municipal council in Aurangabad district, Maharashtra, Maharashtra, India. Paithan is located south of present-day Aurangabad on the banks of the Godavari River. It was the capital of the Satavahana dynasty, which ruled from the second century BCE to the second century CE. It is one of the few inland towns mentioned in the famous first-century Greek book, the &quot;Periplus of the Erythraean Sea&quot;.

Paithan is associated with many spiritual leaders of all faiths since ages. To name some of them are - Changdev Maharaj, Saint Dnyaneshwar, Saint Sopandev, Saint Nivruttinath, Saint Muktabai, Saint Eknath, Saint Jaganade Maharaj, Saint Bhanudas, etc. Paithan was the home town and Samadhi sthal of the great Marathi saint Eknath; people flock yearly to his shrine during the time of the Paithan yatra, also known as the Nath Shashti. Apegaon village, the birthplace of Saint Dnyaneshwar and his three other siblings is located along the northern bank of the River Godavari, about 12 kilometers easterly to Paithan. The religious saints and philosophers enthralled the masses through their works written in simple Marathi style and popularized the bhakti cult in the wake of Islamic expansion. Therefore, Paithan eminently deserves the appellation as &quot;Santpura&quot;. Paithan is also an important place for followers of Mahanubhava Sampradaya. Sarvajna Chakradhar Swami stayed in Paithan for a long period.

Paithan is a well known ancient Digambar Jain (pilgrimage place of miracles). A beautiful black sand idol of 20th Jain Tirthankar, Bhagwan Munisuvratnath is in the temple.

Paithan is also known for its saris — the Paithani beautiful silk saris that sport intricately embroidered gold or silver borders.

Dnyaneshwar Udyan at Paithan is developed on the lines of Brindavan Gardens, Mysore.

The city is home to many noted personalities of modern times like Shankarrao Chavan, Yogiraj maharaj Gosavi (Descendant of Sant Eknath), Balasaheb Patil (Historian)

==History==

Pratishthana (Sanskrit: प्रतिष्ठान, lit. &quot;standing firmly&quot;) was capital of first Satavahana king Simuka, from where it grew into an empire covering almost half of present India. The Satavahanas were known as &quot;Trisamudratoyapitvahana&quot;. Later, under the name Pishtapura (Sanskrit: पिष्टपुर, lit. &quot;flour city&quot;), it was taken by the Chalukya ruler Pulakesin II who commissioned the recording of the event in a poem as &quot;reducing Pishtapuram to flour&quot;.

Pratishthanapura or present day Paithan is said to be the capital of Mulaka desh. Aurangabad, Nashik, Jalna, Washim are parts of Mulaka. Muluka or Mulaka is identified and it is also known as Moolaka or Moolaka desha along with Ashmaka.

According to Puranas, Pratishthana was built by King Sudyumna, son of Manu. Once Sudyumna, who was one of the few sons of Manu, strayed into Shiva&#x27;s forest during his hunting trip around Manulaya and was cursed to become a woman named Ila by Shiva. By praying to Shiva&#x27;s consort Parvati, Sudyumna managed to stay as man and woman alternatively every month. He would not remember events of one stage in the other. When he was a woman, he married the son of Chandra, Budha (Mercury, one of the nine planets the &#x27;Navagrahas&#x27;), through whom he had a son (Pururavas). Budha helped Ila to attain his former self by pleasing Shiva through &#x27;Ashvamedha Yagna&#x27; (Horse sacrifice). After leaving Budha, at the instance of Sage Vasiştha, Ila established Somavamsa in the city of Pratishthana in the valley of Sahya mountains by banks of river Godavari from where he ruled for long. After him, Pururavas became the king of Pratishthana.

In ancient times it was called Pratishthanpura and it has seen many ups and downs in its long and chequered history. Because of its long and continued existence it was the seat of a number of dynasties and dynastic rules. It was credited to be the capital of the ancient Janpadas like Asmaka. Thus, Paithan gained the epithet as &quot;Supratisthana&quot; (Sanskrit: सुप्रतिष्ठान, lit. &quot;standing very firmly&quot;) not only for its political importance as the capital city during the long rule of the Satavahanas and of great consequence till the Yadavas, but also for its affluence and of highly advanced civilization. Its importance has also been vouchsafed in the writings of the foreign travelers and geographers. As a great commercial centre, it was very well linked with the other important towns of ancient India and the western world. Its exports had earned great reputation in the western markets and had achieved international renown. Its quality textiles such as the Paithani had no parallel in the contemporary world. The Roman parliament was rather forced to put a ban on such types of luxurious imports to save the nation form extravagance. So its contributions in the field of trade and commerce are equally noteworthy and as important as in the fields of politics and religion.

Archaeologically, Paithan&#x27;s importance need not be overemphasised. The environs of Paithan have given evidence of pre-historic and proto-historic antiquities. Whereas, in the historical period archaeological data from the Satavahans to the Yadavas has been recorded. Even now a number of antiquities of different periods are abundantly available on the surface of the mounds at Paithan. Thus we come across an amazing variety of beads, terracotta. Bangles and coins of the Satavahana period. Some of the punch-marked coins predate the Satavahans and the foreign coins confirm its close contacts with the western world. 
Paithan, with its varied and variegated politico-economic and religio-social activities greatly contributed to the growth of a highly enriched cultural milieu and perhaps no other city in Maharashtra could possibly compare itself favorably with Paithan. Apart from the thriving of the three major religious sects such as Buddhism, Jainism and Vedic religion at Paithan ever since it became the capital city of the Satavahanas, all the religious movements during the medieval period have centered round this historic city.

Paithan the ancient city of Pratishthan, is situated on the left bank of the river Godavari. Since the second millennium B.C. The dawn of the Goda Valley Civilisation it has played a vital role in shaping the culture of the region and has been a sacred place for the Hindus, the Buddhists and the Jains.
From ancient times Paithan was important emporium of trade and commerce with links connecting it to marts in India and in Europe. It developed its own religion and educational institutions and in the field of art, drew the attention of the Muslim invaders, who overran the city and whose culture left its imprint upon the life and manners of the people of Paithan.
During the seventeenth century, the Marathas, recognizing the value of Paithan as a centre of religious and economic importance, strove hard to keep it under control. They felt a special affinity towards this ancient city and many Maratha rulers made it a point to stop at Paithan while on their way to other places. In 1679, for instance, Chhatrapati Shivaji halted at Paithan while proceeding to Jalna. During his stay he issued a charter appointing Kawale – a leading priest of Paithan – as a royal priest. This arrangement made by Shivaji for a local priest to perform the family rituals is understandable as Paithan was regarded as moksha-tirtha – a pilgrimage centre from where the soul could be liberated forever from a shackled existence. Shivajis son and successors honoured this charter for a long time.
The Peshwas, the administrators of the Maratha rulers, also kept close connections with Paithan city. Peshwa Balaji Bajirao in 1761, married into the Wakhare family – moneylender of Paithan and his successors . Peshwas Madhavrao and Narayanrao, maintained the close association. Peshwa Madhavrao, judging from his letters, was particularly impressed by the textiles of Paithan.

<doc id="782322" wikidata="Q945913" url="?curid=782322" title="Yakushi-ji">
<text>is one of the most famous imperial and ancient Buddhist temples in Japan, and was once one of the Seven Great Temples of Nanto, located in Nara. The temple is the headquarters of the Hossō school of Japanese Buddhism. Yakushi-ji is one of the sites that are collectively inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site under the name of &quot;Historic Monuments of Ancient Nara.&quot;

The temple&#x27;s main object of veneration, Yakushi Nyorai, also known as &quot;The Medicine Buddha&quot;, was one of the first Buddhist Deities to arrive in Japan from China in 680, and gives the temple its name.

==History==

The Jinshin Wars in Japan in 672 resulted in moving the capital from Otsu back to Asuka. The movement of the capital was due to family disputes over money and power leading to civil war between Prince Naka and Prince Ōama. Prince Ōama desired power over Prince Naka&#x27;s son, who was favored by his father to take the throne after him. After disagreements between Prince Ōama and Prince Naka&#x27;s son, Prince Ōtomo, Prince Ōama secured victory over his brother and nephew. Prince Ōama, as Emperor Tenmu, was responsible for moving the temple from Otsu back to Asuka in 672. The original Yakushi-ji was built in Fujiwara-kyō, Japan&#x27;s capital in the Asuka period. The Fujiwara capital was built during this time on the Chinese model, with hopes of improving economic stability and centralization of government as well as a strong military. 

Yakushi-ji was commissioned by Emperor Tenmu in 680 as an offering for the recovery from illness of his consort, who succeeded him as Empress Jitō. This act of building temples in devotion to Buddhist figures was a common practice among Japanese nobility after Buddhism was first imported from China and Korea. Emperor Tenmu had died by the time Empress Jitō completed the complex, in around 698. It was disassembled and moved to Nara eight years after the Imperial Court settled in what was then the new capital. The Nara Period (710–794) began with the transfer of the capital to Nara in 710 from the Fujiwara Capital. This was due once again to the desire to build a strong, centralized government. Emperor Shōmu instigated the construction of the &quot;Seven Great Temples&quot;: Tōdai-ji, Kōfuku-ji, Gangō-ji, Daian-ji, Yakushi-ji, Saidai-ji, and Hōryū-ji.

It has long been believed that the temple was moved to its present location in 718, following the move of the capital to Heijō-kyō, known today as Nara. However, excavation of the Fujiwara-kyō Yakushi-ji site in the 1990s suggested that there may have been two Yakushi-jis at one time. The Fujiwara-kyō Yakushi-ji is also referred to as Moto Yakushi-ji ( &quot;&quot;, &quot;original&quot;).

Fires destroyed most of the buildings in the complex in 973, and the main hall in 1528. The main hall was rebuilt in 1976, the west tower in 1981, the central gate in 1984, and both the east and west gates in 1995.

==East Pagoda==

, completed in 730 during the Nara period, is the only original 8th-century structure at Yakushi-ji. The structure stands at , and is regarded as one of the finest pagodas in Japan, representing the architecture of the Hakuhō to Tenpyō periods. The East Pagoda has just three storeys, but seems to have six because of the presence of inter-storey pent roofs (&quot;mokoshi&quot;). The structure is topped by a distinctive globe-shaped finial. The East Pagoda was disassembled for repair work from 1898 to 1900, and disassembled again in 2012. The had corroded, and the edges of the eaves of the pagoda had sagged. A seven-storey scaffold completely surrounded the East Tower as repair work continued to 2018.

==Architecture==

===Layout===

Yakushi-ji&#x27;s layout is symmetrical, with two main halls and two three-storey pagodas. The unique layout is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Yakushiji style&quot;. Yakushi-ji is geometrically planned as a grid to replicate the Fujiwara capital, and to embody the new location. The Golden Hall stands in the middle of Yakushiji. Forward to the east and west of the golden hall are two pagodas symmetrically placed in order to bring attention to the Hall. The Golden Hall in Fujiwara resembles the Golden Hall at Heijo. Eighteen column foundation stones found at Fujiwara show that the distance between each column is exactly the same as the distance between each column at Heijo. There are also identical staircases on each side of both temples. Discoveries of an underlying road system at Yakushiji at Fujiwara demonstrates that the temple was constructed around the road systems in the new capital. The East Pagoda replicated styles at the Heijo Yakushiji, with 12 granite column foundation stones found during excavations, while the West Pagoda demonstrated signs of being constructed during the early Nara period, after the capital had been moved, and has a different style. There are few remnants of the Fujiwara Yakushiji today: the only visible markings are the foundations and columns of the Golden Hall.

=== Yakushi Triad ===
Yakushi was first worshipped as a &quot;Medicine Buddha&quot; by members of the wealthy and powerful elite, who prayed to him for relief from illness for themselves or their loved ones. It was not until later that the Tendai sect developed a cult around him on the basis that he could bring health and prosperity to all human beings. Yakushi is still included among the 14 deities venerated at memorial services. 

Sculptures of Yakushi before the 7th century are made from bronze, but sculptures made later are made from wood. Among 247 statues known, 224 are wood, 17 bronze, four stone, and two iron. Other differences between old and new Yakushi sculptures include the fact that in the older sculptures Yakushi does not hold a medicine jar in his hand. The Yakushi Triad at Yakushi-ji is known for being one of the most well-known icons in Japan as well as one of the earliest example of T’ang style used in Japan. The Nara Period is evident in the Yakushi Triad due to the idea that they are wooden sculptures, which was used among sculptors in this time period. It is up for debate for scholars as to where the Yakushi Triad originated. There are arguments among scholars who believe it was made to be an icon at Fujiwara Kyo Yakushi, while others argue that it was made in the early Nara Period for Heijōkyō Yakushiji.

<text>Konnevesi is a municipality of Finland. It is located in the former province of Western Finland and is part of the Central Finland region. The municipality has a population of ()
and covers an area of of which , or almost 25%, is water. Neighbouring municipalities are Hankasalmi, Laukaa, Rautalampi, Vesanto and Äänekoski. The municipality is unilingually Finnish.

There are altogether exactly 100 lakes in Konnevesi. The biggest lakes are Keitele, Lake Konnevesi and Liesvesi. The population density is .

The logging tongs appearing in Konnevesi&#x27;s coat of arms refer to local forestry. The coat of arms was designed by Gustaf von Numers, and the Konnevesi municipal council approved it in its meetings on 23 April 1964. The Ministry of the Interior approved the coat of arms for use on 21 August that year.

==History==
The toponym Konnevesi was first mentioned in 1554 as &quot;Konnevessij äremarch&quot;. The name is derived from the lake Konnevesi, which in turn likely refers to a Sámic word meaning &quot;deer&quot; (reconstructed proto-Sámic &quot;*kontē&quot;).

Konnevesi was separated from Rautalampi in 1922. A municipal merger with Laukaa was planned in 2012, but was not accepted by the municipal government of Konnevesi.

== Villages ==
== Dialect ==
The dialect of Konnevesi is a Savonian dialect. The dialect is transitional between the Central Finnish and Northern Savonian subgroups, with the speech of the western villages having more Central Finnish features while the speech in the eastern villages (such as Mäkäräniemi) is closer to the Northern Savonian dialects.

Kontiolahti hosted the Biathlon World Championships in 1990, 1999 and 2015.

==History==
Kontiolahti originally belonged to the parish of Liperi. It became an independent municipality in 1873. The flood nuisance of Lake Höytiäinen and the desire for water abandonment inspired residents to try to build a canal to lower the water level, but the dam broke uncontrollably in 1859, and the landscape changed dramatically. After World War II, the Ruskeala&#x27;s migrants were stationed in Kontiolahti.

==Geography==

Kontiolahti has 183 lakes, and water bodies cover 22.3 percent (230 km2) of the municipality&#x27;s surface area. The largest of them are Lake Höytiäinen, Lake Kangasvesi and Lake Herajärvi. There are 11 Natura sites in all or part of Kontiolahti: Teerisaari-Sisuslahti, Soikkeli Forest, Pöllönvaara-Kruununkangas, Paihola Forest, Kolvananuuro and surrounding areas, Koli National Park, Jouhteninen, Huurunlampi-Sammakkolampi-Huurunrinne and Huuhkajanvaara.

<text>Korpilahti is a former municipality of Finland. Together with Jyväskylän maalaiskunta, Korpilahti was consolidated with Jyväskylä on January 1, 2009.

It is located in the former province of Western Finland and is part of the Central Finland region. There are about 4,500 summer-time inhabitants visiting the 2,000 summer cottages.

The municipality is unilingually Finnish. The municipality was also known as &quot;Korpilax&quot; in Swedish. The Swedish name is now considered outdated, according to the Institute for the Languages of Finland. Politically, Centre Party is dominant. Korpilahti was one of the poorest municipalities in Finland with an unemployment rate of 14.4% (2002).

Korpilahti is relatively well known for its nature, with large hills and about 200 lakes. Lake Päijänne, the second largest lake in Finland, is partially in the area of Korpilahti.

== Geography ==
=== Neighboring municipalities ===

<doc id="782332" wikidata="Q13533527" url="?curid=782332" title="Vernon Hill">
<text>Vernon W. Hill II (born August 18, 1945) is an American businessman, the founder and former chairman of Metro Bank, a UK retail bank with 77 stores, and assets of £7.4b ($10.6b). He was also the founder, former chairman, president and CEO of Commerce Bancorp of Cherry Hill, New Jersey, and chairman of pet insurance firm Fetch Inc. In 2016, Hill was named chairman of Philadelphia-based Republic Bank.

==Early career==
Although known for banking, Hill&#x27;s business outlook has been informed by early encounters with retailing. While taking morning classes at Wharton, Hill worked afternoons at a South Jersey bank owned by a local car retailer, where Hill observed the car dealer applying retail principles to banking operations, such as late opening hours. The job also brought Hill into contact with other local retailers, including McDonald&#x27;s. After graduation Hill founded a real estate firm to find and develop sites for McDonald&#x27;s, a task which required Hill to drive McDonald&#x27;s entrepreneur Ray Kroc on scouting trips. Hill claims his experience with McDonald&#x27;s taught him the importance of standardised presentation and scale economies in retailing.

&quot;Philadelphia Magazine&quot; reported that Hill&#x27;s experience with McDonald&#x27;s led directly to the creation of Commerce Bank. Referring to the creation of Commerce, Morton Kerr, chairman of the board of Markeim-Chalmers, Inc., a South Jersey real estate firm, and one of the original Commerce board members, observed:

&quot;A lot of us knew Vernon from being involved in real estate at that time…He was a 26-year-old kid who called about 15 of us to a meeting in his office. I&#x27;ll never forget it. He said, &#x27;We&#x27;re going to start a bank.&#x27; And he said we&#x27;d each have to put up between $25,000 and $125,000. This was 1973-who had that kind of money? But he&#x27;d arranged for all of us to borrow it. If you could put up $100,000, he got us loans for $80,000. Only seven of us didn&#x27;t get up and walk out, but we still thought he was crazy.&quot; 

The deal resulted in Commerce opening its first branch in Marlton, New Jersey, in 1973.

==Commerce Bancorp==
Commerce Bank was notable for its rapid expansion, from one branch in 1973 to 470 branches in 2008, and a deposit base that grew by an average of 25% per year between 1996 and 2001 (against an industry average of 5% in 2001). According to &quot;Forbes Magazine&quot;, Commerce produced a 23% annual shareholder return compounded for 30 years.

Commerce Bank&#x27;s economic model rested on the idea that the fixed costs of a bank branch are largely independent of volume, and so profitability lay in maximizing the number of deposits and accounts per branch. Additionally, Hill believed that the industry&#x27;s reliance on internet banking had led to dis-investment in bank branches, to the detriment of consumers who prioritised in-person service.

 “Other banks decided to push consumers out of the branch because it is the high-cost delivery channel. They wanted to push them online. We totally reject that. You can&#x27;t name me one retailer in this country that has pushed people where they don&#x27;t want to go and succeeded...We have some branches that get 100,000 customer visits a month; the average branch gets 40,000. An average McDonald’s gets 25,000 per month.”

Hill&#x27;s motto for Commerce was “America’s most convenient bank”.

Commerce Bank staff were awarded $5,000 if a nearby rival bank closed its branches; hundreds of mystery shoppers made tens of thousands of store visits annually, and salary increases were based on mystery shopping scores. Top-performing managers were given sports cars.

On June 29, 2007, Hill resigned as chairman and CEO of Commerce Bancorp after the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia and the board of directors of Commerce Bancorp established governance to stop doing business with firms under the control of Hill&#x27;s family. Notable business dealings with insiders included property leases with entities in which Hill was a partner, and the purchase of services from an architectural design business run by his wife, Shirley. No charges were brought.

On October 2, 2007, Commerce Bancorp announced that it would be merging with TD Bank Financial Group. The Canadian-based Toronto-Dominion Bank acquired Commerce for $8.5 billion (U.S. dollars) in cash and stock, at $42 per share of CBH stock, a purchase multiple of x28. Some industry commentators held that Hill&#x27;s departure and a strong Canadian dollar had made a takeover inevitable.

==Petplan==
Hill is chairman of Fetch Inc., a pet health insurance company founded by Chris and Natasha Ashton. It holds the U.S. and Canadian franchise from British pet insurance firm Petplan, the world&#x27;s biggest provider of policies for pets. Hill invested in the company in April 2008, believing pet health to be a growth market in the USA.

Speaking to &quot;Fortune&quot; in 2010, Hill said, &quot;People used to put down their pets when they got sick. Now they&#x27;re members of the family. People will want to save them with kidney transplants and hip replacements. This business will be huge.&quot;

==Metro Bank==
Metro Bank UK was launched in London in July 2010, with Hill as co-founder and vice-chairman.

Press commentary at the time centred on Metro being the first high-street bank to open in the United Kingdom for more than 100 years, and upon Hill&#x27;s belief that the competitive landscape of British banking amounted to a commercial opportunity to lead on service rather than price. In 2010, 85% of the UK market for current accounts was held by the &quot;big five&quot; banking institutions (HSBC, Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland, Santander and Lloyds). In 2008, an official report from the Office of Fair Trading concluded that UK banking was subject to weak competitive pressures and profit-maximising strategies. &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine described Metro at launch as &quot;...aiming to disrupt a storied industry dominated by a handful of established players&quot;.

In a &quot;BBC News&quot; interview, Thomson commented that the cost–driven model of traditional British banks required them to discourage customers from visiting branches, whereas Metro Bank&#x27;s model actively sought to attract customers into branches, using tactics such as longer opening hours and pet-friendly policies.

The pair spent a further two years securing a £75m launch investment, including funds from New York real estate developer Richard LeFrak, property investors the Reuben brothers and Fidelity, the fund management company. Metro was launched with plans to open 200 branches in London by 2020. Twelve branches were opened by December 2010. In June 2012, the company announced the completion of a £126m round of capital-raising to open further branches in London, including funds from Moore Capital and the billionaire investor Steve Cohen.

The noted investor Wilbur Ross commented, &quot;The question is whether [Hill’s] promotional flair and service concept will produce enough customers to offset the extra operational cost of providing the extra space&quot;.

Hill, who previously served as Metro&#x27;s vice chairman, replaced his co-founder Anthony Thomson as chairman in January 2013.

In September 2013, Metro had 225,000 accounts and was opening a new branch every month with a goal of opening 25 by the close of the year.

In April 2013, Hill was awarded the Institute of Economic Affairs&#x27; Free Enterprise Award, whose previous winners include Margaret Thatcher and Sir Richard Branson, for his work at Metro. The IEA noted that Hill &quot;has identified a clear opportunity and entered the UK banking scene at a time when the sector has been under constant fire&quot; and showed &quot;incredible perseverance and imagination&quot;, while IEA director general Mark Littlewood praised Metro Bank as &quot;a shining example of innovation improving people&#x27;s live. It&#x27;s refreshing to see more competition and choice in the banking sector on our high streets&quot;.

In August 2013, Tom Brown of Bankstocks.com wrote, &quot;So Vernon Hill has, not once, but twice, and in two different markets, built growth machines in the supposedly mature and sleepy banking business. That has to make him the world’s greatest growth-oriented banker, probably of all time.&quot; In the same month, Hill received the 2013 &quot;Stevie Award for International Chairman of the Year&quot;.

In 2018, Hill faced criticism when it was reported that Metro Bank had engaged his wife&#x27;s architecture firm, paying it £21m in fees, and also for his use of a £120,000 per year company expense allowance.

Hill stepped down as chairman in October 2019. He remains on the board as a non-executive director, and will leave the board officially at the end of 2019.

==Republic Bank==
Hill became chairman of Republic First Bancorp doing business as Republic Bank in 2016. He became chief executive officer in 2021, and was fired in May 2022.

==Book==
Hill is the author of &quot;Fans Not Customers: How to Create Growth Companies in a No Growth World&quot;, which was published by Profile Books in October 2012. It argues that it is better to have fans rather than customers and urges businesses to compete on service rather than price. The &quot;Financial Times&quot; reviewed Hill&#x27;s writing style as &quot;refreshingly to the point&quot; and said that &quot;for those looking for an alternate way of approaching service, the book will prove rich pickings&quot;.

==Other investments==
Hill was a partner with Steve Lewis in US Restaurants Inc, which operated 34 Burger King restaurants in metropolitan Philadelphia.

Hill&#x27;s first business was Site Development Inc, a real estate development firm which has developed over 1000 shopping centres and retail developments in America.

In 1994, Hill, along with partners John Silvestri and Steve Lewis, founded and developed Galloway National Golf Club near Atlantic City, New Jersey. The course was designed by Tom Fazio and is ranked by GolfDigest.com as being among the top 100 courses in America.

==Business philosophy==
&quot;Fortune Magazine&quot; describes Hill as a &quot;flamboyant, tradition-stomping American billionaire&quot; and &quot;the P.T. Barnum of banking&quot;.

Hill has often advocated a business development strategy based on organic growth rather than acquisition, and by generating customer loyalty through service rather than price. Speaking to a 2010 House of Commons Treasury Select Committee on competition and choice in the banking sector, Hill said:

&quot;My opinion is that great retailers never grow by acquisition…If you see yourself as a retailer delivering an unusual service, acquisitions are the easiest way to kill your model…[Organic growth] is slower, but you get what you want at the end. You get a group of people running your model, not somebody else’s model….&quot;

Hill is a critic of the shadow banking system, believing it to largely responsible for the financial crisis of 2007–2008.

&quot;We have two American banking systems. We have the normal banking system, with 8,000 banks serving consumers and businesses throughout America. Then we developed a shadow banking system…the money market funds, the investment banks, the credit default swaps. The current crisis is really a crisis of this shadow banking system….I think when [banks] are making a loan to, say, a restaurant, the overwhelming majority of banks aren’t playing games. As long as the guy’s paying, it’s a loan that pays back over time. Then we moved into all this exotic stuff — credit default swaps, CDOs. Believe me, no one at Goldman Sachs understands what they have on their books, because these kids are sitting at their computers dreaming this stuff up….&quot; 

Hill is often quoted as viewing his banks to be in the retail business rather than the banking business.

&quot;You don&#x27;t have to think about what time a Home Depot, a McDonald&#x27;s or a Starbucks is open,&quot; Hill says. &quot;They&#x27;re open. You just go. My theory was, if you advertise that [your bank is] open on Sunday, the consumer will automatically believe you&#x27;re open all the time. That message is more important than the savings.&quot;

In its 2007 20-20-20 Club, &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine listed Hill as one of seven CEOs (along with Warren Buffett and Larry Ellison) of publicly-traded companies with tenures of over 20 years to deliver an annual shareholder return in excess of 20%. Commerce produced a 23% annual compounded shareholder return over that time.

==Personal life==
Hill is the son of a Virginia real estate brokerage owner and the eldest of six children. He graduated from Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia in 1967, earning a BS in economics with a concentration in finance.

Hill&#x27;s 46,000 ft2 (4,270 m2) home, Villa Collina, is located in Moorestown Township, New Jersey. The home has an orangery. Hill has been married for 40 years to Shirley Hill, who is the founder of InterArch, the architectural and branding firm responsible for the branding for Commerce Bank and Metro Bank. The couple have four children, and Sir Duffield, their Yorkshire terrier.

The Hill Family Foundation supports various charitable organisations in both the US and Britain. It is one of the largest supporters of veterinary causes, including:

* A $10 million gift for the Vernon and Shirley Hill Pavilion at the School of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Vernon&#x27;s alma mater.
* The Penn World Veterinary Award 
* The UK Kennel Club Achievement Award

<text>Korpo (; ) is an island located in the Turku archipelago. It is a former municipality of Finland. On 1 January 2009, it was consolidated with Houtskär, Iniö, Nagu and Pargas to form the new town of Väståboland. As of 1 January 2012, Väståboland was renamed Pargas (Parainen in Finnish), which is also the name of a town on one of the islands, which has proven somewhat confusing for tourists and visitors to the area.

The climate in Korpo is somewhat different from the mainland&#x27;s climate. It typically has cooler summers than the mainland, but the winters are also less harsh. The archipelago as a whole is considered to have the shortest winter in Finland.

Korpo is a favourite tourist destination in Finland and it is home to many summer cottages. It is believed in the summer months the population rises from around 800 to 5,000. This is reflected in additional car ferries to and from the island operating in these months. Even so, with extra ferries there can still be extensive queues at peak times in summer and especially at weekends, when travellers can expect to wait up to an hour to board a car ferry.

Korpo also has a ferry terminal on the north of the island operating ferries to Houtskär, Norrskata and the Åland islands.

It is in the province of Western Finland and is part of the Southwest Finland region. The municipality had a population of 889 (2004-12-31) and covered an area of (excluding sea), of which is inland water. The population density was 5.27 inhabitants per km2. Utö, the southernmost inhabited island of Finland belonged to the municipality.

The municipality was bilingual, with majority being Swedish and minority Finnish speakers.

There are many islands belonging to Korpo, Aspö for example.

<doc id="782337" wikidata="Q7494044" url="?curid=782337" title="Shelvock">
<text>Shelvock is a name of Saxon origins - from the Old English meaning a shelf of level ground, or flat topped hill, and &quot;ac&quot; meaning oak, taken from the ancient Manor of Shelvock, near Ruyton-XI-Towns, Shropshire, England originally pronounced &quot;&quot;shelf&#x27;ac&quot;, &quot;shelv&#x27;ak&quot; or &quot;shelv&#x27;oak&quot;, but today as &quot;shel&#x27;vock&quot;&quot;. All families with this name (and associated variants Shilvock &amp; Shelvoke) are believed to be given to tenant-farmers and servants attached to the manor. 

Shelvock is also a type of freestone quarried on the property, a Permian sandstone, known to be used in the building of Grimpo Congregational Chapel, 3 km north of Shelvock.

==Manor of Shelvock==
In the Domesday period (1086) Shelvock was one of the three Berewicks (a hamlet attached to a manor) of the Manor of Wykey. Sometime between the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; and 1175 Shelvock became the head of the manor.

The first recorded spelling of Shelvock was Shelfhoc (1175), and later Sselvak and Schelfac (c. 1270). From the 15th century and for several centuries Shelvock was the seat of the Thornes family, before its decline in the 18th century and beyond. In the 1890s, then a farm house in the Parish of Ruyton-XI-Towns (Ruyton-of-the-Eleven-Towns, or simply Ruyton), Shelvock was part of the Tedsmore Hall property. In 1894 the township of Shelvock included the house and one cottage. In the 21st century only the working farm remains.

Detailed History of Shelvock Manor

==Family names==
&quot;Shelvock&quot; is the original family name of Shropshire origins. &quot;Shilvock&quot; - pronounced &quot;shil&#x27;vok&quot; - the variant created in the 17th or 18th century by Black Country (North Worcestershire/South Staffordshire) dialect and is the dominant family name and spelling today. After US immigration some Shilvock families reverted to the name Shelvock. Both family names can be found in Central England, the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.

Shelvoke is a variant (occasionally Shelvoak). Extinct as a family name (since the 1960s), the name survives only in a small number of UK engineering firms, the most notable of which are Accles &amp; Shelvoke and Shelvoke and Drewry, which the latter became incorporated into Shelvoke Dempster, Dennis Shelvoke, and other spin-off companies. The name also exists in a firm of accountants based in Cannock, Staffordshire.

Noted people with the name include:
* Captain George Shelvocke, 18th-century privateer and author
* George Shelvocke, son of Captain George Shelvocke, a member of the crew and later secretary general of the Post Office in London

Lammi became a separate parish in the beginning of the 15th century or slightly earlier. Koski was first mentioned as a separate parish in 1410, but it was merged into Lammi as a chapel community in 1540. The chapel was also known as &quot;Etola&quot; after another village in the area. Koski became a separate parish from Lammi in 1870. The name &quot;Hämeen-Koski&quot; was first suggested for the parish in 1897 by Väino Wallin to distinguish it from Koski Tl, at the time still a part of Marttila. Koski Hl was renamed &quot;Hämeenkoski&quot; in 1995.

Hämeenkoski was consolidated with Hollola in 2016.

<text>Charles John Lyttelton, 10th Viscount Cobham (8 August 1909 – 20 March 1977) was the ninth Governor-General of New Zealand and an English cricketer from the Lyttelton family.

==Background and education==
Lyttelton was born in Kensington, London, the son of John Lyttelton, 9th Viscount Cobham, and Violet Yolande Leonard. He was a cousin of the musician Humphrey Lyttelton. He was educated at Eton College and Trinity College, Cambridge, graduating with a law degree in 1932. He had a family connection with New Zealand, where he became governor-general, through his great-grandfather George Lyttelton, 4th Baron Lyttelton, who was chairman of the Canterbury Association and contributed financially to the early development of Christchurch. Hagley Park is named after their family estate (Hagley Park, Worcestershire), and the port town of Lyttelton bears his great-grandfather&#x27;s name. He visited New Zealand in 1950 in relation to property holdings in Christchurch.

==Military service==
Lyttelton joined the Territorial Army in 1933. He served in the Second World War with the British Expeditionary Force in France from 1940. He was commander of the 5th Regiment from 1943.

Lyttelton was made Honorary Colonel of Queen&#x27;s Own Warwickshire and Worcestershire Yeomanry on 1 April 1969.

==Political career==

After the war, Lyttelton wanted to follow in his father&#x27;s footsteps and enter the House of Commons. However, his father died in 1949 and he succeeded as Viscount Cobham, precluding a career in the Commons.

Cobham became the ninth Governor-General of New Zealand on 5 September 1957. Although from an aristocratic background, he proved popular. He was seen as an outdoors man with a sporting prowess in cricket, and golf, and a competent rugby judge. He was good with a gun and an enthusiastic fly fisherman, all attributes that resonated well with New Zealanders. Significant events during his tenure included the independence of Western Samoa and the opening of the Auckland Harbour Bridge.

Cobham was served by three Prime Ministers: Sidney Holland (1949–1957), Keith Holyoake (1957 and 1960–1972) and Walter Nash (1957–1960). He was most careful to not comment on controversial matters, and had a good working relationship with all three. He was instrumental in setting up the Outward Bound outdoor education organisation in New Zealand, opening the Outward Bound school in Anakiwa near Picton in September 1962, which bears his name. He visited the school in 1966 and was pleased with the progress that had been made.

Cobham served until 13 September 1962. He was a skilled orator and a book of his speeches sold 50,000 copies; he donated the £10,000 profit to Outward Bound. Cobham Oval in Whangarei and Cobham Court in Porirua are named after him.

==Cricket==

Lyttelton enjoyed a career in first-class cricket, playing more than 90 times for Worcestershire in the 1930s and captaining the club between 1936 and 1939.

He made his first-class debut, against Gloucestershire, in June 1932, but made a duck in his only innings and did not reappear for two years. He played five times in 1934, but it was only the following season that he became established in the side, playing about 20 matches a year from then until the Second World War, with the exception of 1937 when he appeared only twice.

His highest score (and only first-class century) was the 162 he made against Leicestershire in 1938, but he made many other useful contributions, reaching 50 on 14 further occasions. His most productive year was 1938, when he scored 741 runs at an average of 21.17.

With the ball, his first victim (in July 1934) was Charlie Barnett, while in 1935 he produced his best innings&#x27; bowling, claiming 4–83 against the South Africans. After 1935 his bowling became largely occasional, and with the exception of nine wickets in 1938, he never again took more than three in a season.

He played ten games for Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) pre-war: one against Oxford University in 1935, and nine on MCC&#x27;s tour of Australia and New Zealand during the following winter.

His cricketing career proper ended with the outbreak of war, but (now listed on the scorecard as Lord Cobham, having succeeded to the title in 1949) he played for an &quot;MCC New Zealand Touring Team&quot; against a strong &quot;London New Zealand Club&quot; side in 1954, taking two wickets including that of Bill Merritt. Remarkably, he made a one-off return to first-class action aged 51 in February 1961, more than two decades after his previous appearance at that level, when as Governor-General he captained a New Zealand side against MCC at Auckland: he showed he still had ability, with a handy first-innings 44 from number ten in the order.

A number of his relatives played first-class cricket. His great-grandfather George played for Cambridge University in the 1830s, his grandfather (also Charles) turned out for teams including Cambridge and MCC in the 1860s, his father John made a handful of appearances for Worcestershire in the 1920s, and his uncle – another Charles – played for Worcestershire, Cambridge and MCC before the First World War.

Lyttelton was a former President of the MCC when he became embroiled in what became known as the D’Oliveira affair. Bruce Murray writes that &quot;On 12 March 1968 Vorster saw Lord Cobham, a former MCC President, in Cape Town, and told him &#x27;quite categorically&#x27; that D’Oliveira would not be acceptable. As Cobham later recalled in a letter to Sir de Villiers Graaff, the leader of the United Party, &#x27;As I remember, he said that a Cape Coloured, alone of all races, castes and creeds, would be likely to provide a catalyst to the potentially explosive – or possibly one should say tricky – Cape Coloured situation&#x27;. In April Lord Cobham duly conveyed this information to Billy Griffith when he saw him at Lord’s&quot;.

==Family==
Lord Cobham married Elizabeth Alison Makeig-Jones on 30 April 1942 in Chelsea, London. They had four sons and four daughters. He died in Marylebone, London, on 20 March 1977, and was survived by his wife and children. He was cremated in London; his ashes were returned to Hagley for burial in the Lyttelton plot at Hagley parish church.

<doc id="782350" wikidata="Q942643" url="?curid=782350" title="HMX-1">
<text>Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1) is a United States Marine Corps helicopter squadron responsible for the transportation of the president and vice president of the United States, heads of state, Department of Defense officials, and other VIPs as directed by the Marine Corps and White House Military Office. A Marine helicopter with the president aboard uses the call sign &quot;Marine One&quot;. Previously, HMX-1 was also tasked with operational test and evaluation (OT&amp;E). This task was reassigned to VMX-1 in Yuma, Arizona; since the contract award of the new presidential helicopter in 2014 to Sikorsky Aircraft, however, HMX-1 has assumed the temporary role of OT&amp;E for this platform, because of its unique nature and mission. The VH-92A first flew in 2017 and became operational in 2024.
Nicknamed &quot;Nighthawks&quot;, HMX-1 is headquartered at Marine Corps Air Facility Quantico, Virginia, and maintains detachments at Joint Base Anacostia–Bolling in Washington, D.C., and Joint Base Andrews Naval Air Facility in Maryland.

==History==
In 1946, General Roy S. Geiger observed the atomic bomb tests at Bikini Atoll and instantly recognized that atomic bombs could render amphibious landings difficult because of the dense concentrations of troops, ships, and material at the beachhead. The Commandant of the Marine Corps convened a special board, the Hogaboom Board, that recommended that the Marine Corps develop transport helicopters in order to allow a more diffuse attack on enemy shores. It also recommended that they stand up an experimental helicopter squadron. HMX-1 was commissioned on 1 December 1947 under the command of Colonel Edward C. Dyer and based at MCAS Quantico, Virginia, because of its relative proximity to the Sikorsky and Piasecki plants in Connecticut, and to the Marine Corps schools where most of the original personnel would come from. They operated the Sikorsky HO3S-1 and the Piasecki HRP-1 and saw their first test of capabilities in May of that year when five squadron aircraft transported 66 Marines from the deck of the to Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. While the test aircraft could only carry three Marines each and required multiple trips, it did indicate the possibilities of the concept. In 1948 the Marine Corps Schools came out with &quot;Amphibious Operations - Employment of Helicopters (Tentative)&quot; or &quot;Phib-31&quot; which was the first manual for airmobile operations. The Marines used the term &quot;vertical envelopment&quot; instead of &quot;air mobility&quot; or &quot;air assault&quot;. HMX-1 performed the first ship-to-shore movement of troops from the deck of an aircraft carrier in an exercise in May 1948.

After the start of the Korean War, four HMX-1 helicopters were attached to VMO-6 and sent to help the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade at the Battle of Pusan Perimeter in 1950. They were used for battlefield observation and control as well as medical evacuation and the rescue of fliers. During the Chosin campaign they were used for liaison between the different Marine units strung along the western edge of the Chosin Reservoir. The requirements of the Korean War exceeded the Navy&#x27;s training requirement thus HMX-1 was pressed into service as a training command for the first few years of the war. They trained the nucleus of pilots that would form HMR-161, the first Marine helicopter transport squadron.

On 7 September 1957, President Dwight D. Eisenhower was vacationing in Newport, Rhode Island, when his immediate presence was needed at the White House. The President was required at the White House to deal with the &quot;Little Rock Nine&quot; crisis stemming from Arkansas Gov. Orval Faubus ordering the Arkansas National Guard to block black students from attending Central High School. President Eisenhower responded by sending the 101st Airborne into Little Rock to enforce the Brown vs. Topeka Board of Education desegregation ruling handed down by the U.S. Supreme Court in May 1954.

Typically, the return trip to Washington, D.C., required an hour-long ferry ride across Narragansett Bay to Air Force One at the Quonset Point Naval Air Station, followed by a 45-minute flight to Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland, and a 20-minute motorcade ride to the White House. Realizing the urgent need for his presence in Washington, President Eisenhower directed his staff to find a faster way to Air Force One.

An HMX-1 UH-34 helicopter was on Aquidneck Island in case of an emergency and could be used to fly the president to his awaiting aircraft. President Eisenhower approved the idea, and Col. Virgil D. Olson and his crew were ordered to rush to a landing pad at the Naval War College at Newport, where the President and Mrs. Eisenhower were staying during their vacation. Col. Olson reported making the flight to the waiting Air Force One across Narragansett Bay in a 6-minute flight.

Thus, a precedent was set. Col. Olson became the first presidential helicopter pilot and commander of a greatly expanded HMX-1 squadron. He served at the pleasure of the president for almost three years before continuing his service in Korea and Vietnam and at the Pentagon. President Eisenhower invited Col. Olson to join him at a White House luncheon in 1959 at which Col. Olson was required to convince the president he should be allowed to pursue his career beyond the limits of the Marine One assignment. President Eisenhower reluctantly agreed to Col. Olson&#x27;s request. Because of his historic role and his long involvement with the HMX-1 Squadron and Marine One operations, the squadron&#x27;s new facility at Marine Base Quantico, Va., was dedicated in honor of Col. Olson (1919–2012) on 12 August 2010. Col. Olson spoke at the dedication of the facility, a rarity for named Marine facilities throughout the world, most of which recognize deceased Marines.

Shortly after the 7 September 1957, mission from Newport, a naval aide to the President asked HMX-1 to evaluate landing helicopters on the south lawn of the White House. Preliminary assessment and trial flights concluded that ample room was present for a safe landing and departure. Formal procedures were finalized and HMX-1 began a long career of flying the President of the United States to and from the South Lawn and Andrews AFB, the home of Air Force One. Col. Olson is credited with initiating many of the procedures which are now standard operating procedure, including painting the top of the otherwise Marine green helicopters white, thus their &quot;White Top&quot; nickname. It also was Col. Olson who conceived the placement of the large white circular target at a predetermined spot on the White House lawn for the nose of Marine One on landing, a function necessitated when the White House gardener complained to Col. Olson that the rotor craft were destroying the trees, shrubs, and flowers on the South Lawn.

Initially, the helicopter function was shared with the Army, but in 1976, the Marine Corps was assigned the sole responsibility and mission of providing helicopter support to the President worldwide. Today HMX-1 also supports the Vice President, Secretary of Defense, Secretary of the Navy, Commandant of the Marine Corps, and all visiting heads of state in the Washington, D.C., area.

On 16 July 2009, Marine One flew with an all-female crew for the first time, as the final flight of the first woman to fly the president: Major Jennifer Grieves.

==Aircraft==
The first official presidential helicopter was the VH-34 Choctaw, beginning operations in September 1957, and replaced by the VH-3A Sea King beginning in 1962. In the late 1970s, the VH-3As were retired and replaced by the upgraded VH-3D. The current fleet is made up of the VH-3D and the VH-60N &quot;WhiteHawk&quot;, which entered service with the squadron in 1988.

The V designates the aircraft as configured for use by VIPs. The Executive Flight Detachment is the only Marine Corps unit to operate these Sikorsky aircraft. The VH-3D is capable of transporting 14 passengers while the VH-60N seats 11. Both helicopters require a pilot, copilot, and crew chief, and the VH-60N&#x27;s crew also includes a communications systems operator. Because the VH-60N folds easily for loading into an Air Force C-5 Galaxy or a C-17 Globemaster it is ideal for overseas assignments. The Marines can prepare a VH-60N for a C-5 load in less than two hours.

Due to the uniqueness of the VH platforms, all pilots and maintenance personnel assigned are trained by Sikorsky factory-trained instructors. Depending on the Military Occupational Specialty, these schools range from 1 to 5 months and are taught at the squadron. Sikorsky technical representatives then provide a watchful eye as the Marines operate and maintain the helicopters.

HMX-1 was scheduled to receive 23 new Lockheed Martin VH-71 Kestrel helicopters to replace the current fleet. However, in April 2009, it was announced that the Kestrel program was no longer included in the Defense budget. The VXX program was restarted, and is slated to deliver new aircraft between 2017 and 2023. also formerly operated a small number of CH-46 Sea Knights for utility purposes, and recently retired its fleet of CH-53E Super Stallions. These aircraft were replaced with MV-22B Ospreys by 2017. These support aircraft also share the HMX-1 dark green livery, but lack the white paint at the top of the aircraft (thus the nickname &quot;white tops&quot;) that the VIP transport helicopters have. On 11 August 2013 two MV-22 Ospreys made their presidential debut ferrying Secret Service agents, White House staff, and members of the media from CGAS Cape Cod to Martha&#x27;s Vineyard during the President&#x27;s vacation. , HMX-1 has 7 Sikorsky VH-3D of 1960s&#x27; vintage, 8 Sikorsky VH-60N from the 80s/90s era and 12 Bell-Boeing MV-22 Ospreys.

==Executive Flight Detachment==
The presidential and VIP flights are conducted by &quot;Whiteside&quot;, the Executive Flight Detachment. Most activities of Whiteside are directed by the White House Military Office. Whiteside, although based at Quantico, Virginia, operates extensively out of an adjunct facility at Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling in Washington, D.C.

Operations by &quot;Greenside&quot;, which is the rest of HMX-1, include operational test and evaluation, such as with the V-22, a vertical take-off and landing tiltrotor aircraft, and support of exercises and training evolutions for the Marine Corps Combat Development Command at Marine Corps Base Quantico, Virginia.

The &quot;X&quot; in its squadron designator originally stood for Experimental, emblematic of its original mission of testing new helicopters and flight systems. However, as its operational role in VIP transportation overshadowed its operational test and evaluation role, the &quot;Experimental&quot; moniker was dropped, although the squadron designator was left unchanged.

Marines who fly in the Executive Flight Detachment may be eligible for the Presidential Service Badge after a certain term of service.

<doc id="782352" wikidata="Q1035334" url="?curid=782352" title="Henri Pigozzi">
<text>Henri Théodore Pigozzi (born Enrico Teodoro Pigozzi; 26 June 1898, in Turin – 18 November 1964, in Neuilly-sur-Seine) was a car merchant and industrialist who is best known for having founded Société Industrielle de Mécanique et Carrosserie Automobile (Simca).

In 1912 his father disappeared, leaving Pigozzi, then aged 14, to take responsibility for his mother, his sister, and a small transport business.

In 1918, after the war, he secured the distribution rights for British and US motorcycles in the Piedmont region, selling surplus machines from the military stocks of the allied armies. Between 1920 and 1922 he worked for a firm that imported coal from the Saarland. In 1924 he set up his own business, importing scrap steel from France which was needed by the Piedmontese steel mills. The principal customer for steel in the region was Fiat and in 1922 Pigozzi was introduced to Giovanni Agnelli, the owner of Fiat. Agnelli was particularly interested in Pigozzi because at the time he was looking for a general commercial representative in France. Pigozzi was already familiar with the French industrial scene, and in 1926, when aged only 28, Pigozzi was appointed as Fiat&#x27;s General Representative in France.

In the same year, he established a new distributing company named SAFAF (Société Anonyme Français des Automobiles FIAT) in Suresnes (near Paris) for importing and later, for assembling Italian Fiat cars. From 1928 to 1934, about 30,000 FIATs were assembled and sold by him in his capacity as Director General of SAFAF.

Pigozzi bought the premises at Nanterre of the defunct Donnet-Zédel car manufacturing company, and on 2 November 1934 he established there the Société Industrielle de Mécanique et de Carrosserie Automobile, known as Simca. He ran Simca for nearly three decades, as Director General between 1935 and 1954 and as President-Director General between 1954 and 1963, which was when Chrysler, a minority share holder since buying 15% from Ford in 1958, increased their share-holding in the business to 64% and took control.

On 31 May 1963, with Chrysler in control, he was obliged to resign from the presidency of Simca.

According to his son Jean (see below), all three of Henri&#x27;s children were borne by his mistress but raised by his wife, Loisette, as her own.
(Cite profile by Ingrid Sischy, &quot;Living Large Is The Best Revenge&quot;, Vanity Fair, December 2010)

 He died suddenly, aged 66 from a heart-attack at Neuilly-sur-Seine, a suburb of Paris, on 18 November 1964, eighteen months later.

<doc id="782353" wikidata="Q780499" url="?curid=782353" title="Balin (Middle-earth)">
<text>Balin is a fictional character in J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s world of Middle-earth. A Dwarf, he is an important supporting character in &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, and is mentioned in &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;. As the Fellowship travel through the underground realm of Moria, they find Balin&#x27;s tomb and the Dwarves&#x27; book of records, which tells how Balin founded a colony there, becoming Lord of Moria, and that the colony was overrun by orcs.

Balin featured in the 1977 Rankin/Bass animated film of &quot;The Hobbit&quot;; in Peter Jackson&#x27;s 2012–2014 live-action film series, where he is portrayed by Ken Stott as reluctant to search for lost gold and sympathetic to Bilbo; and in the 2003 video game adaptation where he is voiced by Victor Raider-Wexler.

== Literature ==

===Early life===

Balin was born in Erebor, the son of Fundin. In the year Balin turned seven, Erebor was sacked by the dragon Smaug, and the Dwarves went into exile. During that period his younger brother Dwalin was born. Their father Fundin was killed in the Battle of Azanulbizar. Balin and his brother settled in the Blue Mountains with their surviving family. Balin and Dwalin were among those who set out with Thorin&#x27;s father Thráin II in an attempt to return to Erebor, but they lost Thráin under the eaves of Mirkwood. After many days of fruitless searching, they returned to the Blue Mountains.

===&quot;The Hobbit&quot;===

Balin was a member of Thorin Oakenshield&#x27;s company of Dwarves who travelled with Bilbo Baggins and Gandalf in the Quest of Erebor, on which the plot of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; centres. His brother Dwalin and he were the first to arrive at Bilbo&#x27;s house at the beginning of &quot;The Hobbit&quot;. He played a viol. He was among those who had been at the Mountain before the dragon came. He had been 7 years old while Thorin had been 24 on that day, making him the second-eldest of the Dwarves in the company.

Tolkien describes Balin as &quot;their look-out man&quot;: he spotted Bilbo approaching the Green Dragon Inn at Bywater, saw the trolls&#x27; fire in the Trollshaws, and was the first to see the elves in Mirkwood. After they escaped the goblins in the Misty Mountains, Balin as look-out for the company failed to notice Bilbo (made invisible by wearing his magic ring), and after this incident he came to respect Bilbo&#x27;s abilities as a burglar. Balin served as the &quot;de facto&quot; spokesman for the party after the Elvenking imprisoned the Dwarves, as they did not at first realise that Thorin had been captured with them as well.

In the course of the Quest, Balin was the Dwarf who developed the closest friendship with Bilbo. He was the only one who offered to look for Bilbo after he had gone down the secret Erebor passage. Some years after the Quest, he and Gandalf visited Bilbo at Bag End, where Balin told of the mountain&#x27;s glory restored in the years after the Battle of the Five Armies.

In &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;, one of the Dwarves of Thorin&#x27;s company, Glóin tells the Council of Elrond that Balin had left Erebor and ventured to reclaim Moria with a company of Dwarves including Óin and Ori (two of his companions from the Quest of Erebor), and Flói, Frár, Lóni, and Náli. The fate of Balin&#x27;s colony was uncertain, as no word had come from Moria in many years. The Fellowship (which included Balin&#x27;s cousin, Glóin&#x27;s son Gimli) later happened upon Balin&#x27;s tomb in the Chamber of Mazarbul, and learnt of his fate from the Dwarves&#x27; book of records, the Book of Mazarbul. It told how Balin discovered Durin&#x27;s Axe, and established a small colony, but it was overrun by orcs and Balin was killed by an orc archer in Dimrill Dale. Thus he died in the same place as his father, having been self-proclaimed Lord of Moria for less than five years. Balin&#x27;s tomb was inscribed &quot;Balin Fundinul Uzbad Khazad-Dûmu&quot;, with smaller runes beneath giving the translation into English (as the representation of Tolkien’s invented language of Westron): &quot;Balin, son of Fundin, Lord of Moria&quot;.

==Analysis==

The Tolkien scholar John D. Rateliff writes that Balin is the only Dwarf of Thorin&#x27;s company whose name does not come directly from the Old Norse poem &quot;Völuspá&quot;, part of the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;. The name appears in Sir Thomas Malory&#x27;s Middle English prose tale &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;, but in Rateliff&#x27;s view Sir Balin is not nearly as likeable a character.

The Tolkien scholar Tom Shippey notes that in the final scene of &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, Balin, Bilbo, and Gandalf discuss the connection between prophecy, individual action, and truth. Balin states that the new master of Dale is wise and popular, and the people &quot;are making songs which say that in his day the rivers run with gold.&quot; They agree that &quot;after a fashion&quot;, the metaphors can indeed be true, that in Shippey&#x27;s words &quot;romance and reality are differences of presentation not of fact&quot;.

When Balin leaves, disastrously, to seek his fortune in Moria, &quot;a shadow of disquiet&quot; came over the Dwarves, as Glóin reports to the Council of Elrond. Shippey writes that the metaphor of the shadow is ominous, and ambiguous: it could mean simple earthly discontent, or it could mean a spell from Mordor: &quot;maybe Balin simultaneously fell [made his own choice] and was pushed [bewitched].&quot;

Tolkien expended enormous effort on constructing a facsimile &quot;Book of Mazarbul&quot; to resemble the burnt, torn volume abandoned at Balin&#x27;s tomb, carefully staining and tearing the paper and burning in the burn-marks to make it as authentic as possible. However, his publisher Allen &amp; Unwin chose not to include his artwork in the first edition, prompting Tolkien to remark that without it the text at the start of &quot;The Bridge of Khazad-Dûm&quot; was &quot;rather absurd&quot;.

==Adaptations==
Don Messick voiced Balin in Rankin/Bass&#x27;s 1977 animated version of &quot;The Hobbit&quot;.

In Jackson&#x27;s live-action film series of &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, Balin is portrayed by Ken Stott as reluctant to go on the quest for old gold, whether or not the dragon had stolen it from Balin&#x27;s ancestors. As such, he is sympathetic to Bilbo, who appears quite unsuitable for the task he is being given.

In the 2003 video game adaptation Balin is voiced by Victor Raider-Wexler.

<text>PlanetSide is a discontinued 2003 massively-multiplayer online first-person-shooter video game developed and published by Sony Online Entertainment.

&quot;PlanetSide&quot; chronicles the efforts of three factions as they fight for territorial control over ten different continents on the planet Auraxis. Players take on the role of individual soldiers fighting for one of the three factions within the game, and can specialize in various fields such as combat vehicle crewman, infantry, invisible infiltrator or a variety of combat support roles; such as combat medic or combat engineer. The game is played primarily in a first person perspective, with the option of third-person.

Unlike most shooting games, in which small-scale matches take place in essentially an instanced map, &quot;PlanetSide&quot; battles can involve hundreds of players in a single fight. &quot;PlanetSide&quot; battles concern control over territory and strategic points, and can cause repercussions to all three factions. To date, &quot;PlanetSide&quot; remains one of the few MMOFPS games ever created. A sequel, &quot;PlanetSide 2&quot;, was released in November 2012. Rather than a direct sequel, it is a &quot;re-imagining&quot; of the first game. On January 24, 2014 Sony Online Entertainment announced that the game was going to be free-to-play in April 2014. The game was officially launched as free to play on April 29, 2014, after several delays. On July 1, 2016, at 4:00pm PT, the servers went offline permanently.

&quot;PlanetSide&quot; holds the Guinness World Record for &quot;Most players online at one time in an FPS war game,&quot; which was set when 6,400 players were active at once on the game&#x27;s Emerald server. It once broke the record for &quot;Most players in an online FPS battle&quot; as well with 600 players (now held by the game&#x27;s sequel, &quot;PlanetSide 2&quot;).

==Plot==
After exploring through a deep space wormhole, the Terran Republic, a highly centralized oligarchic galactic government which had unconditionally ruled humanity for the past thousand years, discovered a single habitable planet. Not only was this planet suitable for the sustenance of life, but it also already possessed many native, highly developed, and staggeringly familiar flora. The Science Institute named this planet &quot;Auraxis&quot;. Taking a keen interest in this aberration, the Republic quickly sent expeditions through the wormhole to explore and colonize the planet. Shortly after arriving, the colonists discovered the remains and technology of a lost and ancient alien species – the Vanu (or &quot;Ancients&quot;). This technology proved to be so complex and powerful as to barely be conceivable to human minds, involving levels of energy previously thought to be physically unquantifiable. This allowed for the quick colonization of the ten continents of Auraxis, the creation of power sources and vehicles for the use of the colonists and, most importantly, it facilitated the development of &quot;rebirthing&quot; technology. This nanotechnology allowed the Terrans to deconstruct and reconstruct their own bodies, allowing fast transportation across the world. Later on, it was discovered that dead workers could be brought back to life using the technology, revealing a startling new possibility: &quot;immortality&quot;. Needless to say, the incredible power (and value) of this technology was systemically acknowledged, and despite the scale of the advances made due to the study of the technology, it was also recognized that humanity had not yet even scratched the surface of any future possibilities. Later on, the discovery that the planet itself had been an artificial construction of the Ancients further served to solidify the realization that, if left unchecked, Vanu technology would forever and irrevocably change humanity and its future.

Shortly after the rebirthing technology was discovered, the wormhole collapsed, cutting the colony off from the &quot;Mother Republic&quot; and preventing the return of Vanu technology for proper examination. The Republic authorities took measures to hide this fact, while desperately exhausting all theoretical options for re-establishing the traversability of the wormhole. Meanwhile, as widespread usage of the technology grew, the Republic began to fear the potential repercussions of allowing so much power to be shifted so quickly into the hands of so many people. Namely, it feared that the rebirthing technology and the potential impunity to death, disease, and pain it afforded would cause massive philosophical shifts amongst the isolated population, thus pulling out one leg of the tripod that had sustained the Republic for a millennium: that of deterrence. More generally, the military feared that if use of the technology continued to spread, that the other two bases might come away as well: a populace armed with practically god-like power would have very little need of a strong authoritarian body to provide structure and purpose to their lives. Based on these trepidations, the Republic began to restrict usage of the new technologies, and halted all further research and development involving the Ancient Tech.

It was too late, however, and their concerns began to materialize earlier than they had expected. As research diminished, so too did hopes of reopening the wormhole. As news of this began to escape the scientific community, general dissension set in. Among the populace, a great resultant of the loss of faith in the capability of the Republic (&quot;which had always presented itself as infallible&quot;) was a split in their loyalties. Two distinct groups emerged: the &quot;loyalists&quot; and the &quot;separatists&quot;. The separatists argued that the recent behavior of the Republic was full of obvious knee-jerk moves and over-reactive mistakes. Claiming that the Republic knew its end was at hand, the separatists advocated breaking away and forming a new society, now that their would-be &quot;oppressors&quot; were isolated and without aid. The loyalists countered that the Republic had never been abusive (&quot;a claim hotly debated&quot;) and had always looked out for its own, and that the Terran people at least owed them continued loyalty on that point alone. Meanwhile, in the intellectual circles and among the scientific establishment, there had long been the feeling that the Republic was ill at-ease with the possibilities of the &quot;New Science&quot;, and a movement had begun to sequester and conceal as many of the Vanu artifacts as could be feasibly obtained without overt notice.

As the Terran demographic continued to polarize, these movements finally came to fruition as the predecessors of the Vanu Sovereignty made their exodus and took with them the research and artifacts they had managed to stockpile over the Auraxian years. Encouraged by this, the separatists seceded, seizing a number of military stockpiles and procuring a small arsenal of military assets: they called themselves the New Conglomerate. In a backlash to this, the Republic declared these two factions outlawed, announcing their intentions to reunify with them at all costs. Shortly after this, war broke out between the Terran Republic and the New Conglomerate. Not long after, the Vanu Sovereignty was attacked by the New Conglomerate and dragged into the war.

==Factions==

===Terran Republic (TR)===
A conservative, authoritarian, collectivist nation who strive to regain contact with the homeworld and reunite the warring factions. Their leadership is a public oligarchy known as the Overwatch, composed of various representative officials and their associated Ministries, who regulate allotted portions of society in accordance with their own expertise and the collective will towards favourable outcomes. They believe that authority is the bastion that protects humanity and that in a truly free society, with no Big Brother to guide and watch over citizens, misery and suffering would quickly be visited to all. Furthermore, they regard the Vanu technology as dangerous and disruptive, a chaotic force threatening the stability of their righteous order, and only begrudgingly do they use it in warfare. Their vision of the future is one of peace restored through their benevolent rule, and humanity reunited by the reopening of the wormhole. They stand by the view that the Vanu became extinct by meddling with power on the orders of magnitude which was to be found in their artifacts and technologies, and they fear groups such as the Sovereignty will drive humanity to a similar fate, causing as much damage to reality as possible along the way. Their ordnance is characterized by its high rate of fire and ammo consumption.

===New Conglomerate (NC)===
A separatist faction determined to remain free of the controlling and domineering Republic, as well as to liberate the rest of humanity from the Republic, whether or not they share the Conglomerate&#x27;s theories. Unlike the authoritarian and technocratic TR and VS governments, the NC are fighting for democracy, freedom, and human rights. As a rebel group, their leadership lies with the Revolutionary Command, a visible co-operative of military experts and leaders who direct the liberation efforts as a whole. They feel that any form of control is oppression and that a miserable free man is better off than a contented slave. Consequently, they view the Vanu technology as a potential tool of control, and the Vanu Sovereignty as technocratic tyrants, would-be dictators like the Republic, only under the banner of science and probably much worse. Their view of the future is one of freedom and self-government, where every man elects his own path and flourishes in what ways he sees fit. They rely on ponderous vehicles and slow-firing heavy weaponry, foregoing mobility and tactical flexibility for heavy armor and superior firepower. As their name suggests, the New Conglomerate is a diverse collection of forces that have banded-together (but have little trust of one another): ordinary citizens drawn into the conflict, various rebel groups that were previously autonomous, expatriate Terran and Vanu soldiers, and the Expeditionary Force (&quot;XForce&quot;) of the Royal House of Auraxis (the rightful heirs to the Vanu throne, forced into exile, the sole possessors of a working wormhole). The NC&#x27;s democratic philosophy is often their Achilles&#x27; heel militarily, as they lack the iron-fisted leadership structure of the TR and VS. From the New Conglomerate&#x27;s point of view, however, theirs is the only moral and just cause.

===Vanu Sovereignty (VS)===
A loose transhumanist group of academics, intellectuals, and common people who believe that human destiny lies in the further development and exploitation of the alien technology. Their leadership is the clandestine Sovereignty Council, the composition of which is unknown without itself and the existence of which is obscured to those outside the Sovereignty. They see the Republic as pedantic and outmoded; a used-up idea and restriction on the continuing ascendancy of the species through the synthesis of man and machine. They also see the New Conglomerate as a savage, ochlocratic band of thugs who have repackaged old mistakes in new dressings and are desperately afraid of &quot;new concepts&quot; which they cannot grasp, and the future these promise to the far-sighted. Their view of the future is one of scientific perfection and purity: they believe that the Vanu used the power of their advanced technologies to transcend their physical limitations and the mundane world, ascending to a superior state of being, and ultimately, a higher plane of existence. Scientists and intellectuals through-and-through, they see this path as an enlightened ascension and hold the Ancients up as a shining example for mankind to follow. Hopefully and eagerly they envision humanity imitating this metamorphosis, firstly through the enhancement of the human condition via &quot;hypertech&quot; (&quot;foreseeable technological breakthroughs which have not yet quite arrived&quot;), and eventually, by the replacement of human beings altogether; from there, not even they can imagine yet. They are most reliant on alien science and technology, and often more than compensate for their shortcomings through the superiority of their engineering, using mind-bending physics, high-energy arrays, and other exotic weaponry to defend themselves.

==Gameplay==
Gameplay took place on the ground and in the air, across desert, mountains, forests and swamps, with factions attempting to capture as many facilities as possible on the surface of the planet while denying them to their enemy. There are many strategies and opportunities that skilled players can use in order to direct combat operations. The player controls their chosen character from a first-person perspective, with an optional third-person mode.

===Character progression===
&quot;PlanetSide&quot; featured an experience/leveling system. Earned experience is divided into three categories: Battle Experience, Support Experience, and Command Experience. Battle Experience is gained from elimination of enemy soldiers, the capture of base facilities, and exploring and interacting with the game world. Support Experience is earned through &quot;Assist&quot; kills: after aiding another player, the first player gains a percentage of experience the other player gains through kills. Command Experience was gained from leading a squad or platoon in a successful base capture. Functionally, Battle Experience and Support Experience are identical, both contributing towards Battle Rank, which lead to benefits such as the ability to use different equipment, implants, or appearance upgrades. Accumulated Command Experience let the player use several team-oriented abilities.

=== Server shutdown ===
On July 1, 2016, at 4:00pm PT, Planetside servers went offline permanently.

A fan-made recreation of the original servers called &quot;PlanetSide Forever&quot; began development shortly before the shutdown.

&quot;PlanetSide 2&quot; was officially released on November 20, 2012.

==Reception==
&quot;PlanetSide&quot; was a runner-up for &quot;Computer Games Magazine&quot;″s list of the 10 best games of 2003. However, it won the magazine&#x27;s &quot;Best Technology&quot; award.

Although the initial game was well received, &quot;Core Combat&quot;, the game&#x27;s only expansion, was released six months after release with a mediocre response. It added six new caverns, three new vehicles, and three new weapons.

<doc id="782360" wikidata="Q913245" url="?curid=782360" title="Lustmord">
<text>Brian Williams is a Welsh musician, sound designer and composer. He has released albums under the name Lustmord starting in the 1980s and through the present.

Williams began as a recording artist within the industrial genre, working with Chris &amp; Cosey and SPK. Shifting his work to Lustmord, Williams continued to employ the threatening aesthetics of industrial, while employing reverb and similar effects to evoke an atmosphere of cosmic horror. Starting with the 1989 album &quot;Heresy&quot;, Lustmord albums have been centered on manipulating sampled recordings with a computer. These samples infamously included field recordings made in locations such as crypts, caves, and slaughterhouses. Williams now downplays the sinister connotations of these locations and says they were picked for &quot;acoustics&quot;.

The influence of Williams work on subsequent artists has led critics to call him &quot;a reluctant pioneer of the dark ambient genre who regards his music as neither dark nor ambient.&quot;

== Biography ==

Williams was raised in the town of Bethesda, Gwynedd in Wales in a family of working class origin. He moved to London, living in a Lambeth squat. There he befriended Throbbing Gristle members Cosey Fanni Tutti and Chris Carter, who urged him to make his own music.

=== As Lustmord ===
Williams began releasing records as Lustmord with a self-titled debut (as &quot;&quot;Lustmørd&quot;)&quot; in 1980. &quot;Lustmord&quot; in German translates literally as “lust murder,” and alludes to a painting tradition in Weimar-era Germany, in which artists like Otto Dix and George Grosz painted scenes of rape and mutilated female bodies that captured the amorality of the interwar period.

Williams released Lustmord&#x27;s sophomore album &quot;Paradise Disowned&quot; in 1984 on which he continued to refine his sound. Critics and Williams himself considered his Lustmord third album, 1989&#x27;s &quot;Heresy&quot;, to be his breakthrough work. Williams has attributed &quot;Heresy&quot;&#x27;s success to his use of an Atari computer as a digital audio workstation. In retrospectives of Lustmord&#x27;s work and the dark ambient genre, critics have called &quot;Heresy&quot; a milestone.

Lustmord has extracted field recordings made in crypts, caves, and slaughterhouses, and combined it with occasional ritualistic incantations and Tibetan horns. His treatments of acoustic phenomena encased in digitally expanded bass rumbles have a dark-ambient quality. Some of Lustmord&#x27;s most notable collaborations include Robert Rich on the critically acclaimed &quot;Stalker&quot;, Jarboe, John Balance of Coil, Monte Cazazza, Clock DVA, Chris &amp; Cosey, Paul Haslinger, and experimental sludge group Melvins on &quot;Pigs of the Roman Empire&quot;. He worked with Tool again in 2019, providing the ocean and wave sound effects on the track &quot;Descending&quot; on their album &quot;Fear Inoculum&quot;.

Williams collaborated with Graeme Revell and Paul Haslinger to contribute as &quot;musical sound designer&quot; and occasionally as an additional composer on 44 Hollywood film soundtracks, most notably on &quot;The Crow&quot; and &quot;Underworld&quot;.

Lustmord worked on Tool&#x27;s DVD singles and remixed versions of &quot;Schism&quot; and &quot;Parabola,&quot; which were released on 20 December 2005. Lustmord also contributed to Tool&#x27;s 2006 album &quot;10,000 Days&quot; with the atmospheric storm sounds on the title track, &quot;10,000 Days&quot;. He later worked again with Tool vocalist Maynard James Keenan, collaborating on Keenan&#x27;s project Puscifer debut album &quot;&quot;V&quot; is for Vagina&quot;, as well as providing several remixes for &quot;&quot;V&quot; is for Viagra. The Remixes&quot;. Lustmord eventually generated a collection of dub remixes of several tracks from &quot;&quot;V&quot; is for Vagina&quot; known as &quot;&quot;D&quot; Is for Dubby - The Lustmord Dub Mixes&quot;. The nine-track LP was released as a digital download on 17 October 2008, available directly from the Puscifer website. He also did some additional music including the track &quot;The Western Approaches&quot; feat. Wes Borland on guitar for the documentary &quot;Blood into Wine&quot;.

Lustmord released the album &quot;[ O T H E R ]&quot; on California-based label Hydra Head Records in July 2008. It features guest appearances by Adam Jones, King Buzzo, and Aaron Turner.

===Live performances===
Lustmord appeared live for the first time in 25 years as part of the high mass observance by the Church of Satan. The ceremony took place on 6 June 2006. A recording of the performance titled &quot;Rising&quot; was released. Lustmord himself noted that the offer was &quot;one of those things that was just too funny to say &#x27;no&#x27; to&quot;.

Lustmord performed for the second time in 29 years at Unsound Festival Kraków on 22 October 2010.

Lustmord performed at Art&#x27;s Birthday celebration (initiated by Robert Filliou) at Södra Teatern in Stockholm, Sweden, on 15 January 2011. He performed in New York for the first time on 9 and 10 April 2011 at the Unsound Festival, coming to the attention of the &quot;New York Times&quot;.
Lustmord&#x27;s first performance in the Netherlands was in September 2011 at the Incubate Festival.

Lustmord played for the first time in Moscow, Russia, on 8 April 2012, at Cinema 35mm. Bad Sector played the first act of the show.

===Video games===
Around 1999, Lustmord was also involved with the video game &quot;&quot;—his work eventually went unused when the project changed direction. He provided music and sound design for a variety of other projects since, such as &quot;Far Cry Instincts&quot;, &quot;Underworld&quot; and NVIDIA demos, many of which include collaborations with Haslinger. He was also involved with the 2003 game Master of Orion. In 2015 he composed the soundtrack for &quot;Evolve&quot; with Jason Graves., and composed the soundtrack of the horror game Scorn together with Aethek.

===Films===
Lustmord composed the soundtrack of the 2017 film &quot;First Reformed&quot; and the 2020 film &quot;The Empty Man&quot;.

Lustmord had two songs used in the TV show &quot;&quot; seasons one and two: “Babel” and “Y Gair.”

== Personal life ==

In early 1990s, Williams relocated to California from London with his wife Tracey, who is a fabricator at Legacy Effects. He is an atheist and has noted that while his ominous music gives an impression to some people that he&#x27;s &quot;somehow dark and [he] live[s] in a castle or in a dungeon&quot;, and that although he&#x27;s &quot;very serious about certain aspects of [his] work&quot;, he&#x27;s &quot;not that serious about [himself]&quot;.

However, he lost his seat in the 2003 Scottish Parliament election. He was elected again in May 2007 and was appointed Minister for Environment in Scotland&#x27;s first-ever SNP administration by First Minister Alex Salmond.

He was then reshuffled on 10 February 2009 to become Minister for Culture, External Affairs and the Constitution, and was later promoted to the Scottish Cabinet on 1 December 2009 replacing Fiona Hyslop as Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning until November 2014, when he was sacked by new First Minister Nicola Sturgeon. He became a backbencher and was a professor of culture and governance at the University of Glasgow from 2015 to 2016. Russell later served in the second Sturgeon government as Minister for UK Negotiations on Scotland&#x27;s Place in Europe from August 2016 to June 2018. He returned to the Cabinet in 2018 as Cabinet Secretary for Government Business and Constitutional Relations, later Cabinet Secretary for the Constitution, Europe and External Affairs, before standing down at the 2021 Scottish Parliament election. Russell was elected President of the SNP in November 2020 and resigned from this position in December 2023 ahead of his appointment as Chairman of the Scottish Land Commission. He stepped in as acting Chief Executive of the SNP from March to April 2023 following Peter Murrell’s resignation.

==Background==
Russell was born in Bromley, Kent to an English mother and a Scottish father.
He grew up in Troon, where he attended Marr College. He went to Edinburgh University, where he studied first theology and then Scottish history and literature. He worked in television and the media prior to establishing his own media company, Eala Bhan Ltd.

Russell is conversant in Gaelic and gave a speech in the language which was the first occasion the European Council was addressed in Gaelic.

Journalist Chris Deerin described him as &quot;a man of culture – and he is likely to tell you so&quot;.

==Political career==
===Joining the SNP===
Originally a member of the Labour club at Edinburgh University, Russell joined the SNP in 1974 during the February election of that year, was active in Edinburgh, in the Western Isles and in the Inverness constituency and stood for the first time for as an SNP candidate in 1984 in Clydesdale in a local government election. He was then the Clydesdale candidate for the Westminster Parliament in June 1987. Later that year he became the elected Vice Convenor of the SNP responsible for Publicity (succeeding Alex Salmond) and in 1990 was Salmond&#x27;s campaign manager during the SNP leadership campaign.

During that time he worked as executive director of Network Scotland, a media and educational company, but he gave up his party posts in 1991 to concentrate on establishing his own TV production company, Eala Bhan Ltd. He returned to active politics in December 1994 when he became the SNP&#x27;s first full-time Chief Executive. In that role, he was the party&#x27;s election director for the 1997 and 1999 campaigns as well as for the successful Perth and Kinross by-election in 1995 (having been deputy campaign director in the 1992 General Election and for the Govan and Glasgow Central by-elections of 1987 and 1988).

===SNP Chief Executive===
Russell was Chief Executive of the SNP in the period prior to the first Scottish election of 1999 and has been an active member of the SNP for over three decades, often working closely with former party leader Alex Salmond.

=== Scottish Parliament ===
====Election====

He was placed second by the party on the South of Scotland list for the 1999 Scottish Parliament elections (as well as standing for the Cunninghame South Constituency which he also fought in 2003) and after his election was appointed SNP Business Manager in the new Parliament which resulted in him becoming a founding member of the Parliamentary Bureau. After John Swinney was elected leader of the SNP in 2000, Russell became Shadow Minister for Education and Culture, a post he held until 2003. He was named as &quot;Debater of the Year&quot; in the &quot;Herald&quot; Awards in 2000, and was nominated for &quot;Scottish Politician of the Year&quot; in the same awards in 2002 as well as for the Channel 4 &quot;Scottish Politician of the Year&quot; title.

When he lost his seat at the end of the first Scottish Parliament, Russell focused on his work as an author and newspaper columnist, commenting on various aspects of Scottish culture and Scottish politics. He did, however, stand for the leadership of the SNP in 2004, in the election prompted by John Swinney&#x27;s resignation. He finished third behind Alex Salmond and Roseanna Cunningham. Russell continued as a political commentator, generating some controversy with his strongly free market views in his book, &quot;Grasping The Thistle&quot;, in which he called for the NHS to be abolished and replaced with an insurance based healthcare system. It also called for inheritance tax and the Barnett Formula to be scrapped and a voucher system introduced for education.

Many SNP members saw Russell&#x27;s absence from the Scottish Parliament as a great loss to the SNP&#x27;s profile and performance there. In 2006 he was once again placed second on the SNP regional list in the South of Scotland though this time the list was chosen by a one member, one vote system for which Russell had argued over a long period and was re-elected to Parliament in 2007. He was also the party&#x27;s candidate in the Dumfries constituency.

====Cabinet appointment====

Following the SNP&#x27;s narrow victory at the 2007 Scottish Parliament election, Russell was appointed the Minister for Environment. In the first reshuffle of the SNP Government in February 2009, Russell was moved to be Minister for Culture, External Affairs and the Constitution.

In December 2009 Russell was promoted to the Scottish Cabinet as Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning following the repositioning of Fiona Hyslop to Culture, Tourism and External Affairs.

Russell left the Scottish Cabinet in November 2014, when Nicola Sturgeon took over as First Minister. 

====Cabinet Secretary for Scotland&#x27;s EU future====

On 25 August 2016 he was appointed as the Scottish government&#x27;s new minister with responsibility for Brexit negotiations with the UK government.

====Covid–19 pandemic====

During the pandemic he called for Britain to join the EU&#x27;s vaccine procurement scheme, tweeting about the British Government&#x27;s decision to go it alone: &quot;This idiotic refusal is all about Brexit and nothing to do with the pandemic. It will cost lives.&quot;. 

He announced in 2020 that he would not be standing for re-election in 2021.

=== Post-Scottish Parliament ===

In November 2020 he was elected to the honorary position of SNP President – having campaigned on a platform of holding an independence referendum in autumn 2021. Russell won 60% of the vote, beating political blogger Craig Murray, who placed second, and former MP Corri Wilson, who placed third.

In response to Operation Branchform and the arrest of Peter Murrell, Russell claimed that the Scottish National Party was facing its biggest crisis in 50 years. 

==Campaigner==
For many years, Russell has campaigned for justice on behalf of former police detective, Shirley McKie, who was awarded £750,000 compensation by the Scottish Executive in a February 2006 out-of-court settlement. The Justice 1 committee of the Scottish Parliament conducted a nine-month inquiry into the McKie case in 2006, and its report was published on 15 February 2007. In April 2007, Michael Russell and Shirley&#x27;s father, Iain McKie, published a book on what they described as the worst miscarriage of justice in a generation: &quot;Shirley McKie – The Price of Innocence&quot; (). Shirley McKie&#x27;s case assumed an international significance with a possible linkage to the case of convicted Lockerbie bomber, Abdelbaset al-Megrahi, who was granted leave to appeal against his conviction for a second time by the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission on 28 June 2007. Megrahi&#x27;s appeal began in Edinburgh on 28 April 2009, and a public inquiry into the McKie case started in Glasgow on 2 June 2009.

Russell supported the successful campaign to have The Tinkers&#x27; Heart in Argyll listed as a Scheduled Monument, with listing taking place in 2015.

==Academic career==
In May 2015, the University of Glasgow announced that Russell would be taking up a part-time post as a professor of culture and governance.

==Controversies==
Russell attracted criticism regarding the negative depictions of Scottish towns and cities included in his 1998 travel book &quot;In Waiting: Travels in the Shadow of Edwin Muir.&quot; In his book, Russell said of Glasgow: &quot;Pull over and stop the car (if you dare) and walk into the closes smelling of urine and rubbish, cluttered with dirt and debris. It is not uncommon to have to step over a comatose body, with or without a needle by its side.&quot; The Scottish capital was also described in a less than positive light: &quot;The flag on Edinburgh Castle is an awful mutant tablecloth and the National Trust for Scotland is arrogant and elitist.&quot;

In November 2009, Russell was engaged in a controversy when his most senior aide was forced to resign after being exposed by the News of the World as the author of an online political blog with controversial content.

In January 2011 Russell was referred to the parliamentary standards watchdog over allegations that he tried to influence school closures for his own electoral benefit. &quot;The MSP was reported to Holyrood&#x27;s standards watchdog after a leaked email revealed he quizzed SNP councillors about their support for the axing of local schools. The message, sent from Mr Russell&#x27;s parliamentary account, concerned proposed closures in the area where he is due to seek election in May. He now represents the South of Scotland but will stand as a candidate in Argyll &amp; Bute.&quot; Kilmodan Primary, the school nearest to Russell&#x27;s home was later amongst those saved from closure as well as Toward Primary where his wife Cathleen was headteacher (Cathleen had also been headteacher at Kilmodan). In January 2011 Mrs Russell transferred to Sandbank Primary School, which was safe from closure.

Russell was also accused of interfering in school closure decisions taken by councils. &quot;The Convention of Scottish Local Authorities (Cosla), the body which represents council leaders, has now written to Mr Russell accusing him of failing to act in a &quot;consistent, pragmatic and limited way&quot;.&quot;
Russell was further accused of &quot;bullying&quot; in his dealings with Shetland Islands Council where the council was asked to postpone cost-cutting school closures. &quot;Mr Russell was last night accused of &quot;bullying&quot; councils into agreeing to his moratorium. A senior local government source said: &#x27;Russell is acting like a school bully on this and bullying councils into backing this delay.&#x27;&quot;

==Books and publications==
Russell has written several books, including:

==Personal life==
Russell married Cathleen MacAskill, a primary school head teacher, in March 1980 and they have one son, Cailean. Since August 1992 the family have lived in an 18th-century single storey farm dwelling in Glendaruel on the Cowal peninsula in Argyll and Bute.

Russell previously separated from his wife for a time after he lost his seat at Holyrood in 2003 and had an affair with his researcher Eilidh Bateman. Bateman, who was 21 years his junior, later dumped Russell just 10 days after he publicly announced he was leaving his wife.

<doc id="782366" wikidata="Q756956" url="?curid=782366" title="Dark ambient">
<text>Dark ambient (referred to as ambient industrial especially in the 1980s) is a genre of post-industrial music that features an ominous, dark droning and often gloomy, monumental or catacombal atmosphere, partially with discordant overtones. It shows similarities with ambient music, a genre that has been cited as a main influence by many dark ambient artists, both conceptually and compositionally. Although mostly electronically generated, dark ambient also includes the sampling of hand-played instruments and semi-acoustic recording procedures.

== Characteristics ==
Dark ambient often consists of evolving dissonant harmonies of drones and resonances, low frequency rumbles and machine noises, sometimes supplemented by gongs, percussive rhythms, bullroarers, distorted voices and other found sounds, often processed to the point where the original sample cannot be recognized. For example, entire works may be based on radio telescope recordings (e.g. Arecibo&#x27;s &quot;Trans-Plutonian Transmissions&quot;), the babbling of newborn babies (e.g. Nocturnal Emissions&#x27; &quot;Mouths of Babes&quot;), or sounds recorded through contact microphones on telegraph wires (e.g. Alan Lamb&#x27;s &quot;Primal Image&quot;).

Generally, the music tends to evoke a feeling of solitude, melancholy, confinement, darkness, and isolation. &quot;Ishkur&#x27;s Guide to Electronic Music&quot; says dark ambient often evokes, &quot;End of days, end of civilizations, feelings of intense isolationism in spite of a socially flattening society.&quot; However, while the theme in the music tends to be &quot;dark&quot; in nature, some artists create more organic soundscapes. The &quot;Symphonies of the Planets&quot; series, a collection of works by Brain/Mind Research inspired by audible-frequency plasma waves recorded by the &quot;Voyager&quot; uncrewed space probes, can also be considered an organic manifestation of dark ambient.

== Etymology ==
The term &quot;dark ambient&quot; was coined in the early 1990s by Roger Karmanik to describe the music of Raison d&#x27;être and related artists that are heavily associated with the Cold Meat Industry record label.

==Origins and development==
Dark ambient has its roots in the 1970s with the introduction of newer, smaller, and more affordable effects units, synthesizer and sampling technology. Early genre elements can be found on Throbbing Gristle&#x27;s 1978 album &quot;D.o.A: The Third and Final Report of Throbbing Gristle&quot;, and in the soundtrack to the 1977 David Lynch film &quot;Eraserhead&quot;. Important early precursors of the genre were Tangerine Dream&#x27;s early double-album &quot;Zeit&quot; (1972), which unlike most of their subsequent albums abandoned any notion of rhythm or definable melody in favour of &quot;darkly&quot; sinuous, occasionally disturbing sonics; and also, &quot;Affenstunde&quot; (1970) by fellow krautrock band Popol Vuh.


Projects like Lustmord, Nocturnal Emissions, Lab Report, and Zoviet France evolved out of industrial music during the 1980s, and were some of the earliest artists to create consistently dark ambient music. These artists make use of industrial principles such as noise and shock tactics, but wield these elements with more subtlety. Additionally, ambient industrial often has strong occultist tendencies with a particular leaning toward magick as expounded by Aleister Crowley, and chaos magic, often giving the music a ritualistic flavor.

The album &quot;Deep Listening&quot; by pioneering electronic and experimental composer Pauline Oliveros in collaboration with Stuart Dempster and Panaiotis released in 1989 as well as the album &quot;Zamia Lehmanni: Songs of Byzantine Flowers&quot; by Australian musical group SPK released in 1987 are also cited as having made a considerable impact on the development of dark ambient. 

In the 2020s, artists known for producing dark ambient work include acts associated with the Cryo Chamber record label, run by Simon Heath who has been composing dark ambient music for over two decades. The website &quot;This Is Darkness&quot; is devoted to the dark ambient genre in all its iterations.

Isolationism, also referred to as isolationist ambient, is an experimental style of ambient music that was prominent in the 1990s. The term was coined by British musician Kevin Martin and first appeared in print in a September 1993 issue of &quot;The Wire&quot; magazine. He described it as a form of fractured, subdued music that &quot;pushed away&quot; listeners rather than comforting them. In 1994 Martin curated a compilation album, &quot;Isolationism&quot;, collecting various examples of the genre. Journalist David Segal referred to it as &quot;ambient&#x27;s sinister, antisocial cousin&quot;.

John Everall, owner of the Sentrax label, placed the origins of &quot;Isolationist&quot; music in early industrial groups, krautrock, ambient music and experimental composers such John Cage and Karlheinz Stockhausen, and others. James Plotkin identified Brian Eno&#x27;s ambient works as an influence on the isolationist scene, along with American experimental bands such as Illusion of Safety. As Plotkin says,

<text>The pewees are a genus, Contopus, of small to medium-sized insect-eating birds in the Tyrant flycatcher family Tyrannidae.

These birds are known as pewees, from the call of one of the more common members of this vocal group. They are generally charcoal-grey birds with wing bars that live in wooded areas.

The genus &quot;Contopus&quot; was introduced by the German ornithologist Jean Cabanis in 1855 with the eastern wood pewee as the type species. The name of the genus combines the Ancient Greek words &quot;kontos&quot; &quot;pole&quot; or &quot;shaft&quot; and &quot;pous&quot; &quot;foot&quot;.

The genus contains 16 species:

<text>Systems Application Architecture (SAA), introduced in 1987, is a set of standards for computer software developed by IBM. The SAA initiative was started in 1987 under the leadership of Earl Wheeler, the &quot;Father of SAA&quot;. The intent was to implement SAA in IBM operating systems including MVS, OS/400 and OS/2. AIX—IBM&#x27;s version of the UNIX operating system—was not a target of SAA, but does have interoperability with the SAA family.

SAA did not define new standards, but selected from among IBM&#x27;s existing guidelines and software. IBM also purchased some third party software from developers such as Bachman Information Systems, Index Technology, Inc., and KnowledgeWare, Inc. These were intended to be implemented uniformly across all SAA compliant environments.

The standard was &quot;designed to make application programs look and work in the same manner across the entire range of the company&#x27;s personal computing systems, midrange processors and System/370 processors.&quot;

SAA was labeled &quot;complex, obscure, and potentially difficult to learn.&quot; 
Under Lou Gerstner IBM later quietly discontinued use of the &quot;SAA&quot; umbrella. By 2001, SAA was being spoken of in the past tense. However many of the individual components of SAA are still in use .

==Common programming interface (CPI)==
The Common Programming Interface attempted to standardize compilers and application programming interfaces among all systems participating in SAA, with the objective of providing &quot;a common programming interface for the entire IBM computer product line - PCs, System/3x, System/370. This implies that under SAA, a program written for any IBM machine will run on any other&quot;.

CPI included a number of pieces:
* Programming languages — PL/I, COBOL, Fortran, C, RPG and REXX
* Application generator — IBM Cross System Product (CSP)
* Communications — Common Programming Interface for Communications (CPI-C)
* Database access — SQL
* Query interface — QMF
* Presentation interface — the OS/2 Presentation Manager was defined to be and when developed was a full implementation of the SAA presentation interface. IBM Graphical Data Display Manager (GDDM) provided compatible SAA graphics support for MVS and VM.
* Dialog interface — ISPF represented the text mode dialog interface; OS/2 represented the full graphical interface.
* Resource Recovery — Common Programming Interface: Resource Recovery (CPI-RR)

==Common user access (CUA)==

Common User Access aimed at providing &quot;a common user interface for the entire IBM product line. A user who sits down at a PC should see the same menus, keyboards and procedures that he would at a 3270 terminal.&quot;

Because of hardware differences complete commonality was impossible to attain. IBM created two CUA standards, the &quot;Basic Interface&quot; for IBM 3270 and IBM 5250 terminals, and the &quot;Advanced Interface&quot; for so-called &quot;intelligent workstations&quot;, or PCs. The keyboard was standardized to the Model M, 101 key, &quot;AT Enhanced&quot; keyboard layout.

==Common communications services (CCS)==
Common Communications Services defined the methods by which heterogeneous systems communicated. CCS depended on &quot;Advanced Program-to-Program Communications&quot;, also known as APPC or LU6.2, Systems Network Architecture (SNA) PU2.1 or &quot;Low Entry Networking&quot; for peer-to-peer networking, and &quot;SNA Management Services&quot; for network control.

Three types of data links were supported:
* Synchronous Data Link Control (SDLC) high speed wide area networks
* X.25 packet-switched networks
* Token Ring local area networks (LAN)

Application Services were provided by:
* CCS supported IBM 3270 data streams, mainly for existing devices
* Document Content Architecture specified a format for documents to be exchanged among different word processors and other software 
* Intelligent Printer Data Stream (IPDS) was a page description language like Xerox Interpress or Adobe PostScript
* SNA Distribution Services (SNADS) for store and forward document transmission
* Document Interchange Architecture (DIA) for electronic mail
* Distributed Data Management Architecture (DDM) for file sharing and as the base architecture of DRDA 
* Distributed Relational Database Architecture (DRDA) for sharing relational databases

==Common applications==
OfficeVision was the SAA-compliant successor to PROFS and AS/400 Office for &quot;office automation&quot;. The AD/Cycle family of development tools was intended to simplify the development of SAA applications.

<doc id="782378" wikidata="Q973175" url="?curid=782378" title="Tōshōdai-ji">
<text>is a Buddhist temple of the Risshū sect in the city of Nara, in Nara Prefecture, Japan. The Classic Golden Hall, also known as the &quot;kondō&quot;, has a single story, hipped tiled roof with a seven bay wide facade. It is considered the archetype of &quot;classical style&quot;.

It was founded in 759 by the Tang dynasty Chinese monk Jianzhen during the Nara period. Jianzhen was hired by the newly empowered clans to travel in search of funding from private aristocrats as well.

Tōshōdai-ji is one of the places in Nara that UNESCO has designated as World Heritage Site &quot;Historic Monuments of Ancient Nara&quot;.

A reflection written by Yan Wenjing on the hope for friendly Sino-Japanese relations describing the author&#x27;s discovery of lotus flowers imported from China which had been planted around the portrait of Jianzhen in the Tōshōdai-ji is included as one of the oral assessment passages on the Putonghua Proficiency Test.

<doc id="782384" wikidata="Q1089982" url="?curid=782384" title="Mau-Mau (card game)">
<text>Mau-Mau is a card game for two to five players that is popular in Germany, Austria, South Tyrol, the United States, Brazil, Greece, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Israel and the Netherlands. Mau-Mau is a member of the shedding family, to which the game Crazy Eights with the proprietary card game Uno belongs. Other similar games are Whot! or Switch. However, Mau-Mau is played with standard French or German-suited playing cards.

== History ==
Mau-Mau surfaced in Germany shortly after the Second World War. In 1961, it was still &quot;a very recent game&quot; that had gained &quot;astonishing popularity within just a few years&quot;. 

Its rules were first published in 1958 and although &quot;it appeared quite suddenly... anyone who has played it once will be enthralled by it... Its particular charm lies in its cheerful, light entertaining character and perfectly refined simplicity. Anyone can play it in five minutes&quot;.

==Rules==

The game is typically played with a 32-card pack, either a French-suited pack from which the Twos, Threes, Fours, Fives and Sixes have been removed or, especially in Europe, with a 32-card German pack.
For more than five players, two packs of cards may be used.

The aim is to be first to get rid of all of one&#x27;s cards. Most of the time, the winner will have to say something at this point, usually &quot;Mau&quot;. If the winner fails to say this, they do not win and instead must take penalty cards. If a player&#x27;s last card is a Jack, they must reply differently, usually saying &quot;Mau Mau&quot;.

Before the start of the game, a player who is not the dealer cuts the deck four times. If the player cuts 1–3 significant cards, they’re allowed to keep them if they want. However, if four cards where the cards are cut are found to be power cards, the deck needs to be reshuffled and the cut is repeated. The players are each dealt a hand of cards (usually 5 or 6). The rest is placed face down as the stock or stack. At the beginning of the game the topmost card is revealed and placed face up on the table then the players take it in turns to play their cards.

A card can only be played if it corresponds to the suit or value of the face-up card. For example, if it is the 10 of spades, only another spade or another 10 can be played (but see below for Jacks).
If a player is not able to do this, they draw one card from the stack; If they can play this card, they may do so; otherwise, they keep the drawn card and their turn ends. When the drawing stack is empty, the playing stack (except for the topmost card) is shuffled and turned over to serve as a new drawing stack.

The 7, 8, Jack, and Ace of all suits are significant cards:

*If a 7 is played, the next player has to draw two cards but may play. (A variant of the game allows the player facing the 7 to play another 7, in which case the player to their left must take 4 cards from the pack, unless they play a 7 too, in which case the player to their left must take 6 cards from the pack, unless they also play a 7, in which case the player to their left must take 8 cards from the pack.)
*Any 8 forces the next player to miss their turn. (A variant of the game allows the player facing the 8 to play another 8, in which case the next player after them must play another 8 or miss a turn, etc.)
*A Jack of any suit is the equivalent of a Joker and can be played on any card. The player who plays it then chooses a card suit. The next player then plays as if the Jack was of the chosen suit.
*If an Ace is played, one other card &quot;must&quot; be played with it. If the player does not have another card, or cannot follow in suit or number, then the player must take a card from the pack. If a player&#x27;s final card is an Ace, they cannot win on that turn.
*When a player has only one card left, they must say &quot;Mau&quot; (even if it is an Ace); if that card is a Jack, they must say &quot;Mau-Mau&quot;. Failure means that the player must take a card.
*If the game is scored, &quot;and&quot; the winning card is a Jack, then all points against the losers are doubled.
== Variants ==
===Austria and Bavaria===
In Austria and Bavaria, a variation is the 32-card game known as Neuner (&quot;Nines&quot;); in this variation, a Joker is added and the Nines are used as wild cards.

=== Czech Republic ===
The most popular variant of this game in the Czech Republic is called Prší (&quot;raining&quot; in Czech).
It is played with a deck of 32 German cards (four card suits, values from 7 to Ace) and has almost identical rules with several differences:
*Players are dealt four cards each.
*Ace forces the next player to skip their turn.
*7 forces the next player to draw two cards, unless they too play a 7, thus requiring the next player to draw four cards and so on. A player who draws cards cannot play a card in the same turn.
*In some rules, K forces the next player to draw 4 cards. They may play 7 to pass the penalty on to the next player who must draw 6 cards or play another 7 and so on. subsequent player, etc. Similarly, K may be played on 7 instead of another 7.
*An Ober (&quot;svršek&quot;) can be played on any card except a 7 or Ace and its player may then choose a suit. The next player then plays as if the Ober was of the chosen suit.
*In some variations, an Unter (&quot;spodek&quot;) cannot be played on any card (it has no special meaning).
*There is no requirement for a player to announce that they only have one card left. (Though it is accepted to say &quot;Prší&quot; as a celebration.)
*In some variation, when 10 is played all other players take a card and the player who played it plays again.
*In some variations, when a player gets rid of their cards, the player may be returned to the game if they would have taken cards because of 7 specifically (or 10 from the variation above). Thus the player truly wins only when they haven&#x27;t had a card in their hand for one whole additional round. (Saying &quot;Prší&quot; is acceptable every time a person loses all their cards.)
Some may play with less common modifications:

==== Variation: Quick ====
A player can play multiple cards at once if these requirements apply:

* The Posted power cards have the same rank
* The bottom card can be played according to already known rules

Playing multiple power cards at once is typically treated as playing a single one.
The exception is sevens, where the number of cards for the next player to draw accumulates, so the next player has to draw 2 times the number of played sevens, or play another seven.
(When playing the variation with 10 being a power card, rules differ from group to group.)

With certain combinations of homebrew rules and 5 or more players it is possible that somebody has to draw more cards than are available on the table.
Solutions include adding more decks to the game or decreasing the penalties of power cards.

==== Variation: Blind ====
Players play cards face-down. The card&#x27;s rank and suit is spoken by the player.
If the next player believes the first one, the card is accepted as &quot;canon&quot; and game continues.
If the next player doesn&#x27;t believe the card is as specified by the first player, the card is revealed.
If the first player told the truth, the next player is penalized: they must draw one or more cards, miss their turn, and so on (the details vary in different versions of the game).
If the first player lied, the first player is penalized (he usually returns the card to their hand and miss their turn, draw one or more additional cards etc.)

=== Iran ===
The game known as هفت خبیث (&quot;Evil Seven&quot; in Persian) in Iran is a variation of Mau-Mau, sharing similar mechanics and utilizing Jacks and Sevens in the same manner. However, there are a few notable distinctions:
* When an Ace is played, it results in the subsequent player missing their turn.
* If an Eight is played, another card must be played simultaneously. Failure to do so, whether due to lack of another card or inability to match the suit or number, requires the player to draw a card from the deck. Importantly, if a player&#x27;s final card happens to be an Eight, they cannot declare victory during that turn.
* Playing a Ten causes a reversal in the direction of play.
* When a player plays a Two, they can choose another player and make them draw a card.
* One card left: say تک‌کارت (&quot;Single Card&quot; in Persian).

=== Netherlands ===
In the Netherlands Mau-Mau is mainly known as Pesten (meaning &quot;bullying&quot;). It is played with a deck of 54 or 55 cards (52 standard plus two or three jokers); multiple decks may be shuffled together if there are too many players to comfortably play with only one deck. The main differences with Mau-Mau are as follows, though there is typically some variation in the rules depending on the group of players.

* All players receive between five and seven cards.
* 2 forces the next player to draw two cards.
* Joker may be played on any other card and forces the next player to draw 5 cards. It may permit the next player to change suit, even if the following rule is applied.
* Playing a 2s or Jokers in succession shifts the draw to the next player cumulatively. So if the first player plays a Joker and the second player a 2, the third player must draw 5 + 2 = 7 cards (or play a 2 or a Joker).
* A 7 allows the player to play another legal card if able; if this is another 7, the player goes again (announced as &quot;Zeven: nog even&quot; or &quot;Zeven: (blijft) kleven&quot;, meaning approximately &quot;Seven: another go&quot; resp. &quot;Seven: sticky&quot;).
* 8 forces the next player to skip the turn (&quot;Acht: wacht&quot;, &quot;Eight: wait&quot;).
* Ace reverses the order of play (&quot;Aas: draai&quot;, &quot;Ace: turn&quot;).
* A King has the same effect as the 7 (&quot;heer nog &#x27;n keer&quot;, &quot;King, go again&quot;)
* Jack changes suit. 
* One card left: say &quot;Laatste kaart&quot; (&quot;Last card&quot;) or knock on the table. (It&#x27;s a common rule that if people forget to knock or announce their last card before the next player plays or draws that they must draw an entirely new hand, 5 or 7 cards). The final card may not be an effect card, the player must draw if it is.

===Portugal===
In Portugal, a variation on this game is called Puque. The rules are almost the same, with the 2 replacing the 8 as the &quot;skip turn&quot; card. A player must say Puque when playing their next-to-last card, and doesn&#x27;t have to say anything different from end with a Jack, still getting the double score.

=== Russia ===
Variants are called Чешский Дурак (&quot;Czech Fool&quot;), Фараон (&quot;Pharaoh&quot;), Крокодил (&quot;Crocodile&quot;) or 101. Usually played with 36-card, French pack. The rules are similar to Czech and Slovak rules.
* The players are dealt five cards.
* Ace forces the next player to skip the turn.
* 7 forces the next player to take 1 card (or more).
* 6 forces to take one card (or more) and skip.
* Queen changes suit.
* (optional) 10 changes turn direction.
* (optional) King of spades forces to take multiple cards and skip.

=== Slovakia ===
In Slovakia, the game is called Faraón (&quot;Pharaoh&quot;). It is the same as in the Czech Republic with the following exceptions:
*Players are dealt 5 cards initially. The loser of a hand starts all subsequent hands with one card fewer. Once a player has lost four hands they start the next with only one card. If they lose a further hand they’re out of the game. The winner of each hand plays first on the following hand.
*A player can play several cards of the same rank in succession, for example if a heart is on top of the discard pile they could play the ace of hearts and the ace of leaves on top of it. The two aces would mean the next two players miss their turns. In some versions it is not possible for players to defend against an ace as they don&#x27;t have a turn.
*If a 7 (or more together) is played, the next player has to draw three cards (or six or nine or twelve). They can pass this penalty on to the subsequent player by playing a 7 (or more) too. This subsequent player must then draw three cards for each seven played in total (unless they play sevens themself, passing the obligation to the next player and increasing it).
*The Unter of Leaves cancels out the obligation to draw cards due to sevens and can have other jacks played on top of it by the same player.
*An Ober can be played on any card. The player who plays it then chooses a suit. The next player then plays as if the Ober was of the chosen suit.
*In some variations, when a player is forced to draw three cards (or six or nine or twelve), if they draw a 7 or an Unter of Leaves in the first 3 cards they may play it and make the subsequent player draw three cards (or cancel drawing cards in the case of the Unter of Leaves), though they have to keep the cards they have already drawn and their turn is skipped.

=== Switzerland ===
A Swiss version of the game called Tschau Sepp, played with 36 cards, has existed at least since the early 1960s.

<doc id="782385" wikidata="Q1089248" url="?curid=782385" title="Active fault">
<text>An active fault is a fault that is likely to become the source of another earthquake sometime in the future. Geologists commonly consider faults to be active if there has been movement observed or evidence of seismic activity during the last 10,000 years.

Active faulting is considered to be a geologic hazard – one related to earthquakes as a cause. Effects of movement on an active fault include strong ground motion, surface faulting, tectonic deformation, landslides and rockfalls, liquefaction, tsunamis, and seiches.

Quaternary faults are those active faults that have been recognized at the surface and which have evidence of movement during the Quaternary Period.

Related geological disciplines for &quot;active-fault&quot; studies include geomorphology, seismology, reflection seismology, plate tectonics, geodetics and remote sensing, risk analysis, and others.

== Location ==
Active faults tend to occur in the vicinity of tectonic plate boundaries, and active fault research has focused on these regions. Active faults tend to occur less within the area of any given plate. The fact that intraplate regions may also present seismic hazards has only recently been recognized.

== Measurement ==
Various geologic methods are used to define the boundaries of an active fault such as remote sensing and magnetic measurements, as well as other ways. Several types of data, such as seismologic reports or records over time, are used to gauge fault activity. Activity and fault area are correlated, and risk analysis is employed with other factors to determine the potential earthquake hazard.

== Geologic conditions in U.S. ==
The geologic conditions and plate tectonic setting in much of the Western U.S. has resulted in the region being underlain by relatively thin crust and having high heat flow, both of which can favor relatively high deformation rates and active faulting.

In contrast, in the Central and Eastern U.S. (CEUS) the crust is thicker, colder, older, and more stable. Furthermore, the CEUS is thousands of miles from active plate boundaries, so the rates of deformation are low in this region. Nevertheless, the CEUS has had some rather large earthquakes in historical times, including a series of major earthquakes near New Madrid, Missouri in 1811–1812, a large earthquake near Charleston, South Carolina in 1886, and the Cape Ann earthquake northeast of Boston in 1755.

<text>Kuhmo (known as &quot;Kuhmoniemi&quot; until 1937) is a town and a municipality in Finland and is located at the south-eastern corner of the Kainuu region. The municipality has a population of () and covers an area of of which is water. The population density is . It shares a border of with Russia (Finnish-Russian border). Neighbouring towns are Hyrynsalmi, Lieksa, Nurmes, Ristijärvi, Sotkamo and Suomussalmi. A neighbour city across the Russian border is Kostomuksha. Vartius, one of the border crossing points between Finland and Russia, is located in northern Kuhmo.

Kuhmo&#x27;s eastern border is located at a drainage divider, and the town area is within the drainage basin of Oulujärvi.

The municipality is unilingually Finnish.

==History==
The first inhabitants arrived in Kuhmo after the last ice-age, around 8000 BCE. Proof of Stone Age habitation has been found around Ontojärvi and Lammasjärvi. Sami people inhabited Kuhmo area until migration from Karelia and Savonia pushed Sami people up north. The influence of Sami culture is still found in the placenames. Wide spreading water routes are known to have attracted hunters, raiders, merchants and tax collectors since the 9th century.

In the Treaty of Nöteborg, the settlement between Sweden and the Novgorod Republic on August 12, 1323, the Kuhmo area belonged to Novgorod. Yet hunters and tax collectors kept on penetrating to the area from west. Swedish interest was to push the border further east.

Permanent habitation settled to the area after Gustav I, king of Sweden, had promised tax relief to peasants who would move north. Almost all the habitation was destroyed in the Russo-Swedish war between 1570 and 1595. In the Treaty of Teusina, the region of Kuhmo was annexed into Sweden. In the following centuries, this area was continuously raided in a number of wars and quarrels.

In 1809, Finland was annexed from Sweden to the Russian Empire as the Grand Duchy of Finland. For merchants from Karelia and Russia, Kuhmo became a trade route and a place to sell their goods. As a memorial of those merchants, on the market of Kuhmo there stands the statue “Laukunkantaja” (in English, &quot;The Bag Bearer&quot;). In this era, Elias Lönnrot, compiler of the Finnish National Epic &quot;Kalevala&quot; made his poem-collecting trips via Kuhmo to Karelia. Lönnrot made some of the editing in Kuhmo. Reconstruction of the hut where he has staying can be seen in the Kalevala village. Publishing &quot;Kalevala&quot; in 1835 fueled birth of Karelianism, which became a major trend in culture spheres towards the end of 19th century. Akseli Gallen-Kallela, who is considered one of the founders of Karelianism, spent his honeymoon in Kuhmo. During their stay Gallen-Kallela painted some of his works at Lapinsalmi, lake Lentua. Scenery to lake Lentua based the background of the middle picture in his work Aino triptych.

During the 19th century burn-beating was still essential in agriculture but in decline. At the end of 18th century tar production had arrived to the area as a new and steadily growing source of income. In the year 1900 tar production in Kuhmo was highest in Finland, at 1.6 million litres. Tar was shipped from Kuhmo to Oulu by rowboats. Largest boats could carry 25 – 27 barrels, 125 litres each. Remains of tar pits, where tar was distilled from pine, can be found everywhere in the Kuhmo area.

The village of Jonkeri and its surroundings near Lake Jonkeri were transferred from Nurmeksen maalaiskunta to Kuhmo in 1903.

The Winter War was an important event in the history of Kuhmo. During the war Kuhmo was bombarded 48 times and ground battles took place as near as ten kilometers from the center of the town. The Soviet army´s objective in Kuhmo was to proceed through Kuhmo and Kajaani to Oulu and divide Finland into two. The offensive was stopped on the Kuhmo – Saunajärvi road at Jyrkänkoski and on the Kuhmo – Kiekinkoski road at Tyrävaara, Both battlescenes are approximately 10 km from the city center. At narrow Kuhmo (Saunajärvi road) the Soviet 54th Division was forced to spread its troops which made Finnish guerilla tactics efficient. After being stopped, Soviet forces were divided and encircled into small pockets. A campaign to destroy the pockets and prevent the Soviet 44th Division from rescuing encircled forces continued until the Moscow peace treaty. After the war Kuhmo kept its eastern borderline unchanged, thus having an unchanged borderline for 400 years straight since the Treaty of Teusina of 1595.

==Geography ==

By area the municipality is the second largest in the region (and the twelfth largest in the country), covering twice the land area of Luxembourg. The population is heavily concentrated in Kuhmo-town. Most of the area is very wild, featuring more than 600 lakes and for the rest extensively forested, providing a home to abundant wild life that includes brown bears, wolves and Finnish forest reindeer.

The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry has set Kuhmo as a part of Eastern Finland´s stable bear population area. According to the plan, the population density of bears in this area will be maintained higher than in the rest of the country. The wolf population is also dense by comparison to the rest of the country. In consequence, the number of reindeer has decreased lately.

The topography is made up of low hills, of which the most significant are near the Russian frontier on the eastern side. To the south, Kuhmo is bordered by North Karelia.

Several nature reserves have been founded in Kuhmo for the protection of the frontier wilderness. Forest administration maintains several hiking routes on the reserves and almost all are accessible to the public.

==== Rimpi ====
Rimpi is a former village near the Russian border, nowadays officially a part of Vartius. Traditionally inhabited by Karelian Orthodox Christians, Rimpi was one of three Karelian-speaking villages in Kainuu, the other two being Kuivajärvi and Hietajärvi in Suomussalmi. The village was destroyed in the Winter War and later rebuilt, however Finnish authorities did not allow the inhabitants to build Karelian-type houses. By the early 1980s, it no longer had permanent inhabitants. New people moved there permanently in 1991.

<text>Dáibhí Ó Bruadair (1625 – January 1698) was a 17th-century Irish language poet who was probably received his training in a Bardic school . He lived through a period of change in Irish history, and his work reflects the demise of the old Irish cultural and political order and the decline in position of poets in Irish society. His ode, &quot;D&#x27;Aithle Na bhFileadh&quot; (&quot;The High Poets are Gone&quot;), written upon the death of a fellow poet, laments this decline and reflects that Ireland was now a far less educated place due to it.

==Biography==
Ó Bruadair was born in Barrymore, County Cork and spent much of his adult life in County Limerick, receiving the patronage of both Irish and Anglo-Irish landowners. This patronage was vital, as Ó Bruadair was the first of the 17th-century poets to attempt to live purely from his poetry, in the manner of the professional bards of the medieval period. It would seem that this attempt was not particularly successful, as his poem &quot;Is mairg nár chrean le maitheas saoghalta&quot; indicates that he was reduced to working as a farm labourer. He died in poverty and, as poems such as &quot;Mairg nach fuil &#x27;na Dhubhthuata&quot; (&quot;O It&#x27;s best be a total boor&quot;) show, with bitterness on him towards the &#x27;blind ignorant crew&#x27; that was the uneducated peasantry. This view was also reflected by poets such as Brian Mac Giolla Phádraig.

As well as Irish, Ó Bruadair knew Latin and English. As a poet, he wrote on historical and political subjects, as well as producing elegies on a number of his patrons, satires on Cromwellian planters, religious poems and, almost uniquely amongst Gaelic poets, at least two epithalamia. His versification was also varied, and he wrote in both syllabic and assonantal metres.

<text>Kuhmoinen () is a municipality of Finland, in Pirkanmaa region, but until 2021, it was part of the Central Finland region. The municipality is home to inhabitants.

Neighbour municipalities are Jämsä, Kangasala, Luhanka, Orivesi, Padasjoki and Sysmä. The municipality is unilingually Finnish.

Kuhmoinen is a municipality very much preferred by summer residents, and the municipality&#x27;s population increases fivefold during the summer months.

==Nature==
There are altogether even 316 lakes in Kuhmoinen. Kuhmoinen lies on the west coast of Lake Päijänne. Biggest lakes in Kuhmoinen after Päijänne are Vehkajärvi and Isojärvi.

Isojärvi National Park resides in Kuhmoinen on the south side of Lake Isojärvi.

== History ==
Kuhmoinen was established in the medieval times. It was first mentioned in 1483 as &quot;Kuchmois&quot;. At the time, it was a part of the Padasjoki parish and a center of a fourth (&quot;neljänneskunta&quot;) within the parish.

<text>Common User Access (CUA) is a standard for user interfaces to operating systems and computer programs. It was developed by IBM and first published in 1987 as part of their Systems Application Architecture. Used originally in the MVS/ESA, VM/CMS, OS/400, OS/2 and Microsoft Windows operating systems, parts of the CUA standard are now implemented in programs for other operating systems, including variants of Unix. It is also used by Java AWT and Swing.

== Motivations and inspirations ==
IBM wanted a standard way to interact with text-based user interface software, whether the screen was a dumb terminal connected to a mainframe or a PS/2 with VGA graphics. CUA was a detailed specification and set strict rules about how applications should look and function. Its aim was in part to bring about harmony among DOS applications, which until then had independently implemented different user interfaces.

For example, to open a file:
* In WordPerfect, the command to open a file was , .
* In Lotus 1-2-3, a file was opened with (to open the menus), (for File), (for Retrieve).
* In Microsoft Word, a file was opened with (to open the menus), (for Transfer), (for Load).
* In WordStar, (to get to the &quot;Opening Menu&quot;), followed by .
* In emacs, a file is opened with + followed by + (for find-file).
* In vi, use to allow commands, then to open the file browser.

 was often the help key (such as Volkswriter (1982)), but in WordPerfect, help was on instead. Some programs used to cancel an action, while some used it to complete one; WordPerfect used it to repeat a character. Some programs used to go to the end of a line, while some used it to complete filling in a form. sometimes toggled between overtype and inserting characters, but some programs used it for &quot;paste&quot;.

Thus every program had to be learned individually and its complete user interface memorised. It was a sign of expertise to have learned the UIs of dozens of applications, since a novice user facing a new program would find their existing knowledge of a similar application either of no use or actively a hindrance to understanding as learned behavior might need to be unlearned for the new application.

The detailed CUA specification, published in December 1987, is 328 pages long. It has similarities to Apple Computer&#x27;s detailed human interface guidelines (139 pages). The Apple HIG is a detailed book specifying how software for the 1984 Apple Macintosh computer should look and function. When it was first written, the Mac was new, and graphical user interface (GUI) software was a novelty, so Apple took great pains to ensure that programs would conform to a single shared look and feel. CUA had a similar aim, but it faced the more difficult task of trying to impose this retroactively on an existing, thriving but chaotic industry, with the much more ambitious goal of unifying all UI, from personal computers to minicomputers to mainframes; and supporting both character and GUI modes, and both batch and interactive designs. By comparison, the Apple HIG only supported interactive GUI on a standalone personal computer. CUA also attempted to be a more measurable standard than the Apple HIG and had large sections formatted as checklists to measure compliance.

== Description ==

The CUA contains standards for the operation of elements such as dialog boxes, menus and keyboard shortcuts that have become so influential that they are implemented today by many programmers who have never read the CUA.

Some of these standards can be seen in the operation of Windows itself and DOS-based applications like the MS-DOS 5 full-screen text editor edit.com. CUA hallmarks include:
* All operations can be done with either the mouse or the keyboard;
* If applicable to the page/screen in question provides a refresh function; 
* Menus are activated/deactivated with the key;
* Menus are opened by pressing the key plus the underlined letter of the menu name;
* Menu commands that require parameters to proceed are suffixed with an ellipsis (&quot;…&quot;);
* Options are requested using secondary windows (often called dialog boxes);
* Options are divided into sections using notebook tabs;
* Navigation within fields in dialog boxes is by cursor key; navigation between fields is by pressing the key; + moves backwards;
* Dialog boxes have a &#x27;Cancel&#x27; button, activated by pressing the key, which discards changes, and an &#x27;OK&#x27; button, activated by pressing , which accepts changes;
* Applications have online help accessed by a Help menu, which is the last option on the menu bar; context sensitive help can be summoned by ;
* The first menu is to be called &#x27;File&#x27; and contains operations for handling files (new, open, save, save as) as well as quitting the program; the next menu &#x27;Edit&#x27; has commands for undo, redo, cut, copy, delete, paste commands;
* The Cut command is +; Copy is +; Paste is +;
* The size of a window can be changed by dragging one of the 8 segments of the border.

CUA not only covers DOS applications, but is also the basis for the Windows Consistent User Interface standard (CUI), as well as that for OS/2 applications — both text-mode and the Presentation Manager GUI — and IBM mainframes which conform to the Systems Application Architecture.

CUA was more than just an attempt to rationalise DOS applications — it was part of a larger scheme to bring together, rationalise and harmonise the overall functions of software and hardware across IBM&#x27;s entire computing range from microcomputers to mainframes.

The third edition of CUA took a radical departure from the first two by introducing the object-oriented workplace. This changed the emphasis of the user&#x27;s interactions to be the data (documents, pictures, and so on) that the user worked on. The emphasis on applications was removed with the intention of making the computer easier to use by matching users&#x27; expectations that they would work on documents using programs (rather than operating programs to work on documents). (See also object-oriented user interface.)

== Influence ==

CUA strongly influenced the early Microsoft Windows operating system during the period of joint IBM and Microsoft cooperation on OS/2 Presentation Manager. But later releases of IBM&#x27;s CUA documents were not used for Microsoft products, and so CUA became less significant in the Windows environment. For instance, the Start menu was introduced. Most of the standard keystrokes and basic GUI widgets specified by the CUA remain available in Windows. The well-known combination for closing a window, , stems from CUA.

CUA never had significant impact on the design of Unix terminal (character-mode) applications, which preceded CUA by more than a decade. However, all major Unix GUI environments/toolkits, whether or not based on the X Window System, have featured varying levels of CUA compatibility, with Motif/CDE explicitly featuring it as a design goal. The current major environments, GNOME and KDE, also feature extensive CUA compatibility. The subset of CUA implemented in Microsoft Windows or OSF/Motif is generally considered a de facto standard to be followed by any new Unix GUI environment.
