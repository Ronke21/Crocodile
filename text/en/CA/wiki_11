<text>Robert Paul &quot;Tad&quot; Williams (born March 13, 1957) is an American fantasy and science fiction writer. He is the author of the multivolume &quot;Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn&quot; series, &quot;Otherland&quot; series, &quot;Shadowmarch&quot; series, and &quot;The Bobby Dollar&quot; series, as well as the standalone novels &quot;Tailchaser&#x27;s Song&quot; and &quot;The War of the Flowers&quot;. Most recently, Williams published &quot;The Last King of Osten Ard&quot; series, with its final novel &quot;The Navigator&#x27;s Children&quot; being published in 2024. More than 17 million copies of Williams&#x27; works have been sold.

Williams&#x27;s work in comics includes a six issue mini-series for DC Comics called &quot;The Next&quot;. He also wrote &quot;Aquaman: Sword of Atlantis&quot; issue #50 to #57. Other comic work includes &quot;Mirrorworld: Rain&quot; and &quot;The Helmet of Fate: Ibis the Invincible #1&quot; (DC).

Williams is collaborating on a series of young-adult books with his wife, Deborah Beale, called &quot;The Ordinary Farm Adventures&quot;. The first two books in the series are &quot;The Dragons of Ordinary Farm&quot; and &quot;The Secrets of Ordinary Farm&quot;. The in-progress third book is under the current title &quot;The Heirs of Ordinary Farm&quot; and does not have a release date yet.

== Early life and career ==

Robert Paul &quot;Tad&quot; Williams was born in San Jose, California, on March 14, 1957. He grew up in Palo Alto, the town that grew up around Stanford University. He attended Palo Alto Senior High School. His family was close, and he and his brothers were always encouraged in their creativity. His mother gave him the nickname &quot;Tad&quot; after the young characters in Walt Kelly&#x27;s comic strip &quot;Pogo.&quot; The semi-autobiographical character Pogo Cashman, who appears in some of his stories, is a reference to the nickname.

Before becoming a full time fiction author Williams held many jobs including delivering newspapers, food service, DJ and station music director for college radio station KFJC, shoe sales, branch manager of a financial institution, writing for the TheatreWorks company and drawing military manuals.
Williams also worked for Apple, developing an interest in interactive multi-media. He and his colleague Andrew Harris created a company, Telemorphix, in order to produce it. The result was &quot;M. Jack Steckel&#x27;s 21st Century Vaudeville&quot;, which was broadcast on San Francisco Bay Area local TV in 1992 and 1993.

In addition, he created &quot;Valley Vision,&quot; a TV series concept, a show about a local TV station. A pilot was shot featuring several people who would go on to become Bay Area acting alumni, including Greg Proops, Mike McShane, Joan Mankin, Marga Gomez and several members of the San Francisco Mime Troupe.

In his mid twenties, he turned to writing and submitted the manuscript of his novel &quot;Tailchaser&#x27;s Song&quot; to DAW Books. To get his publishers to look at his first manuscript he spun a story about needing a replacement copy because his had been destroyed. It worked. DAW Books liked it and published it, beginning a long association that continues to this day. Williams continued working various jobs for a few more years, including three years from 1987 to 1990 as a technical writer at Apple Computer&#x27;s Knowledge Engineering Department, taking problem-solving field material from engineers and turning it into research articles (which led, in part, to the &quot;Otherland&quot; books), before making fiction writing his full-time career.

== Writing and influences ==

Writing long stories was an early hallmark for Williams. &quot;I remember specifically one &#x27;folktale&#x27; assignment when I was thirteen that was supposed to be three pages, and I wound up writing a seventeen-page sword-and-sorcery epic with illustrations, etc.&quot; His first attempt at professional writing was &quot;a rather awful science-fiction screenplay called &quot;The Sad Machines&quot; that I&#x27;ve never shown to anyone outside my family, I think. The only interesting thing about it now is that its main character, Ishmael Parks, was a definite precursor to Simon in the Osten Ard books.&quot;

Williams traces his interest in the science fiction and fantasy genre back to the books his mother read to him when he was a child, and that he later read to himself: E. Nesbit, &quot;The Wind in the Willows&quot;, and of course Tolkien.

A long list of authors have influenced and inspired Williams&#x27;s work: Ray Bradbury, Theodore Sturgeon, Fritz Leiber, Michael Moorcock, Roger Zelazny, Harlan Ellison, Kurt Vonnegut, Ursula K. Le Guin, Hunter S. Thompson, Thomas Pynchon, J. D. Salinger, William Butler Yeats, Wallace Stevens, Barbara Tuchman, Philip K. Dick, Ruth Rendell, James Tiptree Jr. (Alice Sheldon), Jane Austen, T. S. Eliot, Jorge Luis Borges, Patrick O&#x27;Brian, Roald Dahl, Dr. Seuss (Theodor Geisel), A. A. Milne, J. J. Norwich, Stephen Jay Gould, John Updike, Thomas Berger, Raymond Chandler, William Shakespeare, and James Thurber.

Williams has also had an influence on other authors in his genre. His &quot;Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn&quot; series was one of the works that inspired George R. R. Martin to write &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot;. &quot;I read Tad and was impressed by him, but the imitators that followed—well, fantasy got a bad rep for being very formulaic and ritual. And I read &quot;The Dragonbone Chair&quot; and said, &#x27;My god, they can do something with this form,&#x27; and it&#x27;s Tad doing it. It&#x27;s one of my favorite fantasy series.&quot; Martin incorporated a nod to Williams in &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot; with &quot;House Willum&quot;: The only members of the house mentioned are Lord Willum and his two sons, Josua and Elyas, a reference to the royal brothers in &quot;The Dragonbone Chair.&quot;

In &quot;Tad Williams: The American Tolkien?&quot; Ash Silverlock observes that &quot;echoes of Williams&#x27;s work&quot; can be seen in the works of Robin Hobb, Terry Goodkind and Robert Jordan. Blake Charlton, Christopher Paolini, and Patrick Rothfuss have also indicated they&#x27;ve been inspired by Williams.

== Family life ==

Williams and his wife and partner Deborah Beale live in Northern California with their two children and &quot;far more cats, dogs, turtles, pet ants and banana slugs than they can count.&quot;

<doc id="759870" wikidata="Q4889724" url="?curid=759870" title="Bennett Park (Detroit)">
<text>Bennett Park was a ballpark in Detroit. Located at Michigan and Trumbull Avenues, it was home to the Detroit Tigers and was named after Charlie Bennett, a former player whose career ended after a train accident in 1894. 

The Tigers began play at Bennett Park in the minor Western League with a 17–2 win over the Columbus Senators on April 28, 1896. That league was renamed the American League in 1900, and the AL declared itself a major league starting in 1901.

==History==

The ballpark sat 5,000 when it opened in 1896 and was gradually expanded to 14,000 by the time it was closed after the 1911 season. When the American League became a major league in 1901 the ballpark seated 8,500, the smallest park in the majors. Private parties built &quot;Wildcat&quot; bleachers on the rooftops of houses behind the left field fence, to the chagrin of Tiger ownership, since people paid to watch games from those bleachers but the Tigers did not get revenue.

The park was noted for its dangerous playing surface, with cobblestones beneath the dirt and sometimes protruding over the dirt.

This small ballpark enjoyed some big success, as the Tigers and their young sensation Ty Cobb won three consecutive pennants during 1907–1909. However, their success ran out in the post-season on each occasion, when they lost to stronger National League teams in the World Series. This ballpark was hallowed ground to fans of the Chicago Cubs, as it was on this site in both 1907 and 1908 that the Cubs clinched their first two World Series championships (and their last one for over a century, until 2016).

Between the 1911 and 1912 seasons, the Tigers acquired the rest of the block, demolished both the wildcat bleachers and Bennett Park, and built Navin Field on the same site, though the new stadium was shifted by 90°, with home plate where the left field corner had formerly been.

===First night game===

Bennett Park was home to the first nighttime baseball game in Detroit. On September 24, 1896, the Tigers played their last game of their first season at Bennett Park, an exhibition doubleheader against the Cincinnati Reds. Tigers owner George Arthur Vanderbeck had workers string lights above the stadium for the nighttime game. A crowd of 1200 attended the experiment, which was described by a local newspaper as &quot;an amusing and financial success&quot;.

Nighttime baseball did not return to Detroit until June 15, 1948, when the first game under the lights was played at Briggs Stadium.

<doc id="759871" wikidata="Q1436826" url="?curid=759871" title="Sebastianism">
<text>Sebastianism () is a Portuguese messianic myth, based on the belief that King Sebastian of Portugal, who disappeared in the 1578 battle of Alcácer Quibir, would reappear and return to Portugal at some critical point in the future. The belief gained momentum after an interpretation by priest António Vieira of the second chapter of the Book of Daniel (Daniel 2) and the Book of Revelation. In Brazil the most important manifestation of Sebastianism took place in the context of the proclamation of the Republic, when movements defending a return to the monarchy emerged. It is categorised as an example of the king asleep in mountain folk motif, typified by people awaiting a hero. The Portuguese author Fernando Pessoa wrote about such a hero in his epic &quot;Mensagem&quot; (&quot;The Message&quot;).

It is one of the longest-lived and most influential millenarian legends in Western Europe, having had profound political and cultural resonances from the time of Sebastian&#x27;s death until at least the late 19th century in Brazil.

== Death of Sebastian the King ==
King Sebastian of Portugal (January 20, 1554 – August 4, 1578) was the grandson of John III, and became heir to the throne due to the death of his father, Crown Prince João Manuel, two weeks before his birth. This period had seen continued Portuguese colonial expansion in Africa, Asia and Brazil, until a dramatic and unlikely succession of plague, bad harvest years, economical depression and the unexpected deaths of all ten of John III&#x27;s children suddenly threatened the continued existence of Portugal as an independent nation. The young king was educated under the guidance of the Jesuits. Luís de Camões dedicated &quot;the Lusiads&quot; to King Sebastian.

Almost immediately after coming of age, Sebastian began plans for the conquest of Morocco. The Portuguese landed in Asilah in 1578, and at the Ksar El Kebir the Portuguese, along with mercenaries from various parts of Christendom, were routed along with their ally the deposed Moroccan sultan Abu Abdallah Mohammed II. After the disastrous defeat against the Saadians of Morocco, Sebastian was almost certainly killed in battle.

Many Portuguese doubted the reports of his death however, and some still expected the king to return based on differing accounts of the outcome of the battle. Those who opposed the pretensions of Philip II of Spain to the throne of Portugal tended to support such versions of events, and backed the rule of King Henry or the claims of António, Prior of Crato, during the Portuguese succession crisis of 1580.

After António was defeated and Portugal fell under the rule of the Habsburgs, Philip ordered that a body recovered from the battlefield, identified as Sebastian, be ransomed from the Saadians and paraded throughout Portugal in a funeral procession. The body was, however, found to be in too advanced a state of decay shortly after its recovery to be definitively and conclusively confirmed as Sebastian, and was mostly rejected by Portuguese society as being his.

===Appearance of imposter pretenders===
Since Sebastian&#x27;s body was never definitively identified after his death, during this time, various impostors claimed to be King Sebastian in 1584, 1585, 1595 and 1598.

The first appeared in 1584; he was a commoner of Alcobaça, quickly apprehended and spared execution by a sentence to work in the galleys.

A second imposter was a son of a stone-cutter from the Azores, who had retired to a hermitage. Because of his frequent self-inflicted deprivations and penitences, those in nearby communities proclaimed him to be the king, atoning for the misfortune of his subjects. Despite his initial denials, he finally consented to the acclamation of local peasants. Traveling to Lisbon, he was paraded through the streets on an ass, exposed to the jeers of the populace, and publicly hanged.

A third Sebastian arose in Spain: an Augustinian friar, Miguel dos Santos, who once had been a chaplain of Sebastian and confessor to Dom Antonio, and was ultimately confessor to the nunnery of Madrigal de las Altas Torres, Castile. He met there Gabriel de Espinosa, a baker, whose appearance recalled the person of Sebastian. Dos Santos persuaded him to impersonate Sebastian. María Ana de Austria, a nun who was a cousin of Sebastian via her father John of Austria, supported the claim. The friar and Espinosa were both captured, forced to confess, and hanged.

A fourth impostor arose in Naples, but was transferred to a prison in Spain. His claims were undermined by his inability to speak Portuguese.

==Sebastianism in Portugal==
The first and greatest proponent of Sebastianism was a supporter of King António in exile by the name of Dom João de Castro (grandson of the viceroy of India of the same name). After the death of King António, Dom João published a series of writings expounding the idea that King Sebastian was &quot;the Hidden One&quot;, foretold to lead Portugal and all Christian nations in the unification of the Earth and the creation of one, last, Fifth Empire that was to succeed the four previous great earthly empires, based on the Book of Daniel, the Book of Revelation, and most importantly the messianic verses of António Gonçalves de Bandarra, written a few decades prior. He published three books and wrote over twenty other volumes of manuscripts during his exile in Paris, between the end of the 16th century and 1623. The most important was &quot;Paráfrase e Concordância de Algumas Profecias de Bandarra&quot;, published in 1603. They proved especially popular among the Portuguese who resented foreign rule, and were quoted by later Sebastianists and proponents of a Fifth Monarchy, such as Sebastião de Paiva in &quot;Tratado da Quinta Monarquia&quot; and Félix da Costa in &quot;Exposição do XI, XII &amp; XII Capítulos do IV Livro do Profeta Esdras&quot;.

The idea that Sebastian awaited the proper time to reveal himself on an unknown island spread spontaneously. It was named by some as the &quot;Ilha Encoberta&quot; (&quot;Shrouded Island&quot;) and by others as Antilia, reminiscent of unidentified mythical islands which geographers, sailors and cartographers hypothesized to exist, or claimed to have sighted and even visited.

When Portugal revolted from Habsburg rule in 1640, King John IV of Portugal had to swear to yield his throne to Sebastian, who would have been 86 years old by that point.

The verses of Bandarra influenced the Jesuit priest António Vieira, one the greatest literary figures in the history of the Portuguese-speaking world and an ardent supporter of King John IV. In his book &quot;História do Futuro&quot; he anticipated a ruler who would inaugurate an epoch of unparalleled prosperity that was to unite the world under the spiritual leadership of the Pope and the temporal leadership of a Portuguese king, and would last a millennia till the coming of the Antichrist. Vieiras &quot;História&quot; together with Bandarras &quot;Trovas&quot; are two of the most important texts for Sebastianism. Accused of heresy, he was arrested by the Inquisition from October 1665 to December 1667, and finally imposed a sentence which prohibited him from teaching, writing or preaching.

The Inquisition condemned Sebastianism and actively sought to confiscate any writings associated with it, particularly the verses of Bandarra, in an effort to stamp out the belief, though with little success. In 1727 the epitaph from the grave of Bandarra was removed by order of Chief-Inquisitor Dom Veríssimo de Lencastre.

The latent popularity of Sebastianism persisted throughout the 18th century. In 1752, a Sebastianist predicted that a terrible earthquake would destroy Lisbon on All Saints&#x27; Day. After the Lisbon earthquake struck on All Saints&#x27; Day three years later (November 1, 1755), there was a surge of converts to Sebastianism. The most severe blow to Sebastianism was dealt by the violent persecution during the premiership of the Marquis of Pombal, as part of his campaign against the Jesuits, which he expelt from the country under the accusation of, among other things, fabricating Sebastianism and the verses of Bandarra, by their association with António Vieira. In 1761 two men were arrested and delivered to the Inquisition for propagating Sebastianist ideas.

Notwithstanding continued official condemnation, the verses of Bandarra remained in issue, as a popular form of folk-literature. In 1803 the Marquis of Nisa sponsored a new edition of the verses of Bandarra, at Nantes, France.

During the Napoleonic wars, the occupation of Portugal by French forces under the command of marshal Junot sparked a revival of Sebastianism. Some of the prophecies of Bandarra were seen as being confirmed particularly by the fact that marshal Junot ordered the universal extraction of taxes equally from every Portuguese individual, along with the resulting social unrest. The Napoleonic invasions of Portugal motivated new editions of the verses of Bandarra, in 1809, prefaced by friar José Leonardo da Silva, in 1815 and 1822.
One of the most important Portuguese authors of the 20th century, the poet Fernando Pessoa built upon Sebastianist motifs. The second part of &quot;Mensagem&quot;, called &quot;Mar Português&quot; (&quot;Portuguese Sea&quot;), Pessoa references Portugal&#x27;s Age of Exploration and its seaborne empire until the death of King Sebastian in 1578. Pessoa brings the reader to the present as if he had woken up from a dream of the past, to fall in a dream of the future: he sees King Sebastian returning and still determined to accomplish a Universal Empire.

The third cycle, &quot;O Encoberto&quot; (&quot;The Hidden One&quot;), refers to Pessoa&#x27;s vision of future world peace and the Fifth Empire which, according to Pessoa, is spiritual and not material. After the Age of Force (Vis), and Taedium (Otium) will come Science (understanding) through a reawakening of &quot;The Hidden One&quot;, or &quot;King Sebastian&quot;. The Hidden One represents the fulfillment of the destiny of mankind, designed by God since before Time, and the accomplishment of Portugal. Sebastian is highly important to the work, as indeed he is referenced in all three parts of &quot;Mensagem&quot;. He was portrayed as representing the capacity of dreaming, and the belief in the possibility of achieving dreams.

Many Portuguese folk tales, particularly in the Azores, feature King Sebastian, usually riding a white horse, and sometimes followed by companions. Often named as &quot;the enchanted king&quot;, they generally involve the monarch appearing before one or a few residents on full moon nights or holy days, such as the feast of Saint John, and asking a simple question (such as &quot;who goes&quot;); a correct answer would dispel the charm the king is under, while a wrong answer will simply result in the king vanishing, to appear on another occasion.

== Sebastianism in Brazil ==

With the proclamation of Brazil as a Republic in 1889, Brazil became a secular state, in contrast to the former Brazilian Empire, where Catholicism had been the official religion. In imperial administration, the church had very important roles: functioning as registrar for births, deaths, weddings, and even for the recording of property.

The coup d&#x27;état against the régime of Emperor Pedro II and the republican reforms brought few changes in most people&#x27;s lifestyle – for example, universal enfranchisement was not enacted —, the greatest change for Brazilians really was the &quot;godless&quot; government. Catholicism and the monarchy had been closely tied and strongly affected Brazilian people. Most of the opposition movements to the republic in the 1890s, 1900s and early 1910s had religious motivations. The character of King Sebastian returned to people&#x27;s imagination: he would come back to defend the divine right of the Brazilian monarchy, who were directly descended from the Portuguese monarchs, to rule in Brazil and to defend Catholicism, which had been removed from government by the Republic.

The forced abolishment of Catholic marriage and the imposition of mandatory civil marriage was a point of particular contention among the poor but deeply religious people of northern Bahia. An itinerant preacher by the name of Antônio Conselheiro founded the town of Canudos with his followers. The village was very small but offered the &quot;Conselheiristas&quot; protection, as the location was hard to access. Within two years, as the religious community prospered, Conselheiro convinced several thousand followers to join him, eventually making it the second-largest urban center in Bahia at the time. The settlement was supported by cultivation of crops and export of leather, with residents allowed to retain private property and businesses. &quot;The poor were maintained through donations to the community&quot;.

Conselheiro claimed to be a prophet and prophesied the return of king Sebastian. A popular tune sung by minstrels among the community went that &quot;Dom Sebastião has arrived/And he brings many directives/Abolishing the civil union/And conducting marriage./Our King Sebastian/Shall visit us/Regret be on the poor man/Who is [married] under dogs law.&quot; He held that &quot;it was the monarch’s God-given right to rule&quot;, which caused him to be progressively branded as a monarchist figure by the unstable Republic at the time. The ultra-conservative doctrine he preached, implicitly criticizing the &quot;wayward behavior&quot; of many priests, was &quot;attractive&quot; to many &quot;sertanejos&quot;, and led the Church hierarchy to view him as a &quot;threat to the Church&#x27;s authority and popularity&quot;. In 1893 the community entered into conflict with the magistrate of a neighbouring town, which spun into an ultimately violent confrontation with the state that became the deadliest civil-war in Brazilian history, known as the War of Canudos. Conselheiro perished amidst the fighting and the community was violently razed at the end of a fourth military expedition sent against it, with over 25,000 people being estimated to have been killed.

In the state of Maranhão, there is a belief, especially on the Lençóis Island, on the coast of the state, that King Sebastian would live on this island, having many legends around his figure, how to become an enchanted black bull with a star on the forehead. The leather of the bull of Bumba-meu-Boi, especially those of sotaques of zabumba and the tambourines played with the back of the hand, from the regions of Cururupu and Guimarães, usually have the tip of the horns in gold metal and, embroidered on the forehead, of gold and jewels, in allusion to the legend. Afro-Brazilian religions in the state, such as Tambor de Mina and terecô, also have a special connection with King Sebastian, who is believed to be an &quot;encantado&quot; (an entity with special powers).

<text>Tehachapi Pass (Kawaiisu: &quot;Tihachipia&quot;, meaning &quot;hard climb&quot;) is a mountain pass crossing the Tehachapi Mountains in Kern County, California. Traditionally, the pass marks the northeast end of the Tehachapis and the south end of the Sierra Nevada range.

The route is a principal connector between the San Joaquin Valley and the Mojave Desert. The Native American Kitanemuk people used the pass as a trade route before the American settlement of the region in the 19th century. The main line of the former Southern Pacific Railroad opened though the pass in 1876; the tracks are now owned by the Union Pacific Railroad and shared with BNSF Railway as the Mojave Subdivision. U.S. Route 466 was built in the 1930s, and the road is now State Route 58. The Pass is also the route of the planned California High-Speed Rail line.

The Tehachapi Mountains are also crossed by Tejon Pass at the southwest end of the range.

==Name==
The precise meaning of the name Tehachapi Pass is often a source of confusion. Technically (i.e., as noted on USGS topographic maps), the name refers to the narrowest part of the canyon on the eastern approach to the summit (as at San Gorgonio Pass), where the elevation is about . The actual high point is just east of the town of Tehachapi, at an elevation (on the railroad next to Tehachapi Boulevard) of . The highway sign refers to this location as Tehachapi Summit. However, the term Tehachapi Pass is routinely used to refer to both this location and the approaches on either side.

==Features==
The mountain pass acts as a venturi effect to air moving between ocean and desert, increasing wind speed.

The area east and south of the pass is home to the Tehachapi Pass Wind Farm, and to the west is Alta Wind Energy Center, some of California&#x27;s larger wind farms. 

The railroad landmark known as the Tehachapi Loop is about west of the summit. The pass is also a proposed route for the California High-Speed Rail line between Palmdale and Bakersfield.

<text>Once Were Warriors is New Zealand author Alan Duff&#x27;s bestselling first novel, published in 1990. It tells the story of an urban Māori family, the Hekes, and portrays the reality of domestic violence in New Zealand. It was the basis of a 1994 film of the same title, directed by Lee Tamahori and starring Rena Owen and Temuera Morrison, which made its U.S. premiere at the Hawaii International Film Festival. The novel was followed by two sequels, &quot;What Becomes of the Broken Hearted?&quot; (1996) and &quot;Jake&#x27;s Long Shadow&quot; (2002).

==Plot summary==
Beth Heke left her small town and, despite her parents&#x27; disapproval, married Jake &quot;the Muss&quot; Heke. After eighteen years, they live in a slum and have six children. Their interpretations of life and being Māori are tested. Beth is from a more traditional background and in saying so, relates to the old ways; Jake is an interpretation of what some Māori have become. Beth sometimes tries to reform herself and her family—for example, by giving up drinking and saving the money that she would have spent on alcohol. However, she finds it easy to lapse back into a pattern of drinking and irresponsibility. The family is also shown to be disconnected from Western culture and ways of learning. Beth reflects that neither she nor anyone else she knows has any books at home, and her daughter, Grace, is the only character with a real interest in school and learning. (This disconnection from books and education is a major concern of Duff&#x27;s, for which reason he founded the charity Duffy Books in Homes, which gives free books to children from poor backgrounds and generally encourages reading.)

Jake is unemployed and spends most of the day getting drunk at the local pub with his friends. There he is in his element, buying drinks, singing songs and savagely beating any other patron whom he considers to have stepped out of line (hence his nickname &#x27;The Muss&#x27;). He often invites huge crowds of friends back to his home for wild parties. While Jake portrays himself as an easygoing man out for a good time, he has a vicious temper when drinking. This is highlighted when his wife dares to &#x27;get lippy&#x27; at one of his parties and he savagely attacks her in front of their friends.

Nig, the Hekes&#x27; eldest son, moves out to join a street gang. He cares about his siblings but despises his father for his thoughtless brutality, a feeling returned by the elder Heke. Nig attempts to find a substitute family in the form of the gang, but this is unsuccessful as the gang members are either too brutal or, in the case of Nig&#x27;s gang girlfriend, too beaten down to provide him with the love and support he craves.

The second son, Mark &#x27;Boogie&#x27; Heke, has a history of minor criminal offenses and is taken from his family and placed in a borstal. Despite his initial anger, Mark finds a new niche for himself, as the borstal manager instructs him in his Māori heritage.

Grace, the Hekes&#x27; thirteen-year-old daughter, loves writing stories as an escape from the brutality of her life. Grace&#x27;s best friend is a drug-addicted boy named Toot who has been cast out by his parents and lives in a wrecked car. He is the one who really cares for her. She is the maternal figure within the family when her family is a drunken mess, clearing up the house and going with Boogie to court to attempt to make a good impression of their broken family.

Grace is raped in her bed one night, and she subsequently hangs herself. Jake, a suspect, leaves his family and starts living in a park, where he reflects on his life and befriends a homeless young man. Meanwhile, Beth starts a Māori culture group and generally attempts to revive the community.

===Autobiographical elements===
&quot;Once Were Warriors&quot;, and Duff&#x27;s fiction in general is strongly influenced by his childhood experiences. In his 1999 autobiography, &quot;Out of the Mist and Steam&quot;, he describes his Māori mother (and most of her relatives) as alcoholic, irresponsible and physically and emotionally abusive. His Pākehā father and his relatives, by contrast, were highly educated and sophisticated—one uncle, Roger Duff, was a well-known anthropologist; his paternal grandfather was liberal magazine editor and literary patron Oliver Duff.

As a teenager, Duff himself spent some time in borstal, and he drew on this when writing about Boogie. The book&#x27;s setting of Two Lakes is based on his hometown of Rotorua (a Māori-language name meaning &quot;two lakes&quot;; &quot;roto&quot; lake, &quot;rua&quot; two), and on the Ford Block of state housing in the town.

<text>Heist-aan-Zee, Heist or Heyst, is a town (formerly a municipality, until 1971) in Knokke-Heist, West Flanders, Belgium.
It was a prominent summer beach resort in the 1890s.

It had a beachfront lined with hotels and a &quot;dike&quot; paved walkway on a storm fender. Fishing boats were moored on the beach, and one could purchase a ticket to bathe in the sea.

<text>Underneath the Radar is the debut album by Underworld, released in 1988. The album was a success in Australia, South Africa and the US (where it reached number 139 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200). The title track of the album was released as a single which reached top five on the ARIA singles charts and number seventy-four on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

The album was recorded in one continuous single take and was promoted as such to underscore the technical expertise of the band members. Promotional appearances for the album&#x27;s release featured the band playing the entire album live and in sequence.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Trouser Press&quot; wrote that &quot;Rupert Hine’s production of &quot;Underneath the Radar&quot; gives it a sturdy dance backbone and the familiar sound of late-&#x27;80s British techno- beat; Heaven 17 leaning towards the Thompson Twins.&quot; &quot;MusicHound Rock: The Essential Album Guide&quot; deemed the album &quot;much more of a modern rock effort.&quot;

<doc id="759881" wikidata="Q911595" url="?curid=759881" title="StumbleUpon">
<text>StumbleUpon was a website, browser extension, toolbar, and mobile app with a &quot;Stumble!&quot; button that, when pushed, opened a semi-random website or video that matched the user&#x27;s interests, similar to a random web search engine. Users were able to filter results by type of content and were able to discuss such webpages via virtual communities and to rate such webpages via like buttons. StumbleUpon was shut down in June 2018.

==History==
StumbleUpon was founded in November 2001 by Garrett Camp, Geoff Smith, Justin LaFrance and Eric Boyd during Camp&#x27;s time in graduate school at the University of Calgary. A prototype was ready by February 2002 and, with great reviews, the extension was installed by thousands of users daily. However, at the time, the company did not advertise and generate much revenue.

In September 2005, Camp met Silicon Valley investor Brad O&#x27;Neill, who provided early funding to the company, assisted the company with a move to San Francisco, and introduced the company to other angel investors that led to $1.2 million of investments. These investors included Tim Ferriss, Ram Shriram of Google, Mitch Kapor of Mozilla Foundation, First Round Capital and Ron Conway and the company was then valued at approximately $4 million. In February 2006, the company used part of the new investments to move to offices in South of Market, San Francisco.

On December 13, 2006, StumbleUpon launched StumbleVideo. The site allowed users without a toolbar to &quot;stumble&quot; through all the videos that toolbar users had submitted and rate them using an Ajax interface. The site aggregated videos from CollegeHumor, DailyMotion, FunnyOrDie, Google, MetaCafe, MySpace, Vimeo, and YouTube.

On February 12, 2007, StumbleUpon launched a version of StumbleVideo that ran on the Wii console, optimized for the Wii&#x27;s smaller screen resolution.

In April 2007, StumbleUpon launched the StumbleThru service, allowing users of the toolbar to stumble within websites such as those of Flickr, MySpace, Wikipedia, YouTube, BBC, CNN, PBS, The Onion, and Phys.org.

In late 2006, the company received informal acquisition offers and on May 30, 2007, the company was sold to eBay for over $75 million.

In July 2007, StumbleUpon was named as one of the 50 best websites by &quot;Time&quot;.

In April 2008, the company had 5 million users, and by the end of May it collected its five-billionth &quot;stumble&quot;, more than one billion of which took place in early 2008.

In March 2009, StumbleUpon launched Su.pr, a URL shortening service, primarily to link to Twitter and Facebook statuses and updates. In 2013, StumbleUpon discontinued the su.pr service.

In April 2009, Garrett Camp, Geoff Smith and other investors including Ram Shriram re-acquired the company for $29 million.

In 2009, StumbleUpon drove more traffic to webpages than any other social media site in the US, including Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Digg, Reddit, and Pinterest.

In May 2010, StumbleUpon claimed to have more than 10 million members.

In March 2011, the company raised $17 million from investors including Accel Partners, August Capital, DAG Ventures, First Round Capital and Sherpalo Ventures.

In March 2011, the company launched Paid Discovery, its advertising platform, whereby users were redirected to the webpages of advertisers, which were disclosed as sponsored content.

In August 2011, StumbleUpon reached the 25 billion stumble mark and was adding over 1 billion stumbles per month.

In August 2011, the company added the &quot;StumbleUpon Explore Box&quot;, where users can enter a specific interest into the search box and be redirected to a related website that has been evaluated by the StumbleUpon community.

On October 24, 2011, StumbleUpon deleted years&#x27; worth of user-generated content, and removed HTML blogging, standalone blog posts, and photoblogging capabilities. Additionally, all previous blog posts were converted from HTML to plain text, and all photos were deleted from previous blog posts.

In December 2011, the company launched a major redesign, including offering tools to allow users to have more control over content. In the month following the redesign, traffic fell 25%.

In April 2012, StumbleUpon announced that it had over 25 million registered users.

In September 2012, StumbleUpon released an update for its iOS app that added &quot;StumbleDNA,&quot; which aggregated content that was recommended for the user, trending content as well, as a section where users could view the activity of their StumbleUpon connections. It also released a redesign of its website in beta release, and extended it to all users on October 24.

On January 16, 2013, StumbleUpon laid off 30% of its staff, reducing it from 110 to 75 employees.

On September 24, 2013, StumbleUpon acquired 5by, a mobile app founded by Greg Isenberg that recommends videos based on user interests. The service was shut down in December 2015.

In October 2014, the company introduced a feature to allow users to chat about webpages that they discovered using StumbleUpon.

In August 2015, a majority stake in the company was re-acquired by Garrett Camp.

StumbleUpon was shut down in June 2018 and its accounts were transitioned to Mix.com, another content discovery venture built in part through Camp&#x27;s studio startup company, Expa.

<doc id="759885" wikidata="Q641041" url="?curid=759885" title="Darrell Armstrong">
<text>Darrell Eugene Armstrong (born June 22, 1968) is an American former professional basketball player, who played 14 seasons in the National Basketball Association. He is an assistant coach for the NBA&#x27;s Dallas Mavericks, who won the championship in the 2010–11 season.

==Early life==
Armstrong was born in Gastonia, North Carolina and graduated from Ashbrook High School of Gastonia in 1986. At Ashbrook, Armstrong was a punter and wide receiver on the football team and began playing basketball as a senior. Armstrong then attended Fayetteville State University, a Division II college in Fayetteville, North Carolina and part of the Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association (CIAA) conference, and joined the football team as a walk-on placekicker. Armstrong played football for the 1986 and 1987 seasons and twice kicked school-record 48-yard field goals. In 1988, Armstrong joined the Fayetteville State basketball team and would play three seasons under coach Jeff Capel II. In his senior season of 1990–91, Armstrong played 24 games and averaged 16.4 points, 3.6 rebounds, and 4.7 assists. Armstrong was the CIAA Slam Dunk champion in 1990 and a first-team All-CIAA selection in 1991.

==Minor and international leagues (1991–1995)==
Armstrong was not selected in the 1991 NBA draft and began his career with the Atlanta Eagles (renamed Trojans in 1994) of the United States Basketball League (USBL) in 1991. Armstrong was named to the USBL All-Defensive team three consecutive seasons from 1992 to 1994, was a second-team All-USBL selection in 1992, and first-team All-USBL selection in 1993 and 1994.

In October 1992, Armstrong signed with the Capital Region Pontiacs of the Continental Basketball Association (CBA). Armstrong later played for the South Georgia Blues of the Global Basketball Association until the team folded in 1993. After playing for the Blues, Armstrong returned to Gastonia. He volunteered at Ashbrook High School as an assistant basketball coach and worked the night shift at a yarn factory.

Armstrong signed with Pezoporikos Larnaca of Cyprus in 1993. He averaged 32.0 points and 8.0 assists and won Player of the Year honors.

For the 1994–95 season, Armstrong played for Coren Ourense of the Spanish Liga ACB and averaged 24.6 points, 4.5 rebounds, and 2.5 assists. He was a ULEB All-Star in 1994.

Armstrong first signed with the NBA as a free agent for the Orlando Magic in late 1994–95, playing in the last 3 games of the regular season with 10 points in 8 minutes of action including a spectacular one-handed reverse windmill dunk late in a blowout vs the Indiana Pacers in his 2nd game. In 95–96 he played just 41 minutes in 13 games, scoring 42 points total; despite his limited minutes, he participated in the 1996 Slam Dunk Contest. He was inactive after February.

He saw 67 games in his first full season on the roster in 1996–97, averaging 6 points per game in 15 minutes per game off the bench. Armstrong won the NBA Sixth Man of the Year Award and the NBA Most Improved Player Award in 1999, thus becoming the first player in NBA history to win both awards simultaneously. In a 1999 game against the Philadelphia 76ers, Armstrong stole an inbounds pass and streaked to the other end of the court for a game winning layup as time expired. He subsequently became the starting point guard for the Magic. His career year was in 1999–00, averaging 16.2 ppg in 31 mpg. 

On February 14, 2001, Armstrong recorded 22 points and a career-high 16 assists in a 114–101 win over the Los Angeles Clippers.

During his nine years in Orlando, the team never posted a losing record, making the NBA playoffs seven times.

On July 7, 2003, Armstrong was arrested after an incident outside an Orlando night club. He was subsequently charged with resisting arrest and assaulting a police officer, but the case was eventually dismissed.

===New Orleans Hornets===
During the 2003 off-season, Armstrong signed with the New Orleans Hornets as a free agent.

===Dallas Mavericks===
He was traded by the Hornets to the Dallas Mavericks in exchange for Dan Dickau and a second round draft pick on December 3, 2004.
On December 19, 2005, while he was still with the Dallas Mavericks, Armstrong was fined $1,000 for grabbing a microphone before a Mavericks game against the Minnesota Timberwolves at the American Airlines Center and yelling &quot;How &#x27;bout those Redskins!&quot; Only a few hours prior, the Cowboys had been routed by the Redskins 35–7. Armstrong was raised in North Carolina as a Redskins fan.

===Indiana Pacers===
After appearing in the 2006 NBA Finals with the Mavericks, he was traded to the Indiana Pacers in exchange for guard Anthony Johnson in July 2006. Armstrong was released by the Pacers on October 1, 2007.

===New Jersey Nets===
After being released by the Pacers, Armstrong signed with the New Jersey Nets after clearing waivers. He appeared in 50 games in 2007–08, averaging 2.5 ppg in 11.0 minutes, and buried three 3-pointers in his final appearance of the season.

==Player profile==
Despite his short height, Armstrong had the ability to dunk. He accidentally completed a reverse layup in the 1996 Slam Dunk Contest, which was deemed the worst dunk in the competition&#x27;s history by Kenny Smith. Subsequently, he was awarded last place in the contest, and was never invited to compete again.

==Coaching career==
On January 26, 2009, the Dallas Mavericks hired Armstrong to be assistant coach for player development. Armstrong helped coach the Mavericks to win the 2011 NBA Finals.

==Personal life==
On February 15, 2025, Armstrong was arrested in Dallas, Texas on a charge of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon.

<doc id="759888" wikidata="Q2303119" url="?curid=759888" title="Popeye (video game)">
<text>is a 1982 platform game developed and released by Nintendo as an arcade video game. It is based on the comic strip of the same name created by E. C. Segar and licensed from King Features Syndicate. Some sources claim that Ikegami Tsushinki did programming work on the game. As Popeye, the player must collect hearts thrown by Olive Oyl from the top of the screen while being chased by Brutus . Popeye can punch bottles thrown at him, but can only hurt Brutus after eating the one can of spinach present in each level. Unlike Nintendo&#x27;s earlier &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; games, there is no jump button. There are three screens.

The game was licensed by Atari, Inc. for exclusive release in the United Kingdom and Ireland in an Atari-designed cabinet. Nintendo ported the game to the Famicom, and Parker Brothers published versions for other home systems. &quot;Popeye no Eigo Asobi&quot; is an English teaching spin-off released for the Famicom on November 22, 1983.

==Gameplay==

The object of the game is for Popeye the Sailor to collect a certain number of items dropped by Olive Oyl, depending on the level—24 hearts, 16 musical notes, or 24 letters in the word &quot;HELP&quot;—while avoiding the Sea Hag, Brutus, and other dangers. The player can make Popeye walk back and forth and up and down stairs and ladders with a 4-way joystick. There is a punch button, but unlike similar games of the period, no jump button.

Brutus chases Popeye and can jump down a level, reach down to the next lower level, and jump up to hit Popeye if he is directly above. Popeye can attack Brutus after eating the can of spinach found in each level. Spinach makes Popeye invincible for a short period, during which Brutus runs away and can be temporarily knocked out simply by running into him.

Popeye punches to destroy harmful items such as bottles, vultures, and skulls. He loses a life when hit by Brutus or any flying object, or if he fails to collect a dropped item within a certain time after it reaches the bottom of the screen. On the first screen of each cycle, Popeye can hit a punching bag to knock a bucket off a hook; if it falls on Brutus&#x27;s head, he becomes stunned for several seconds and the player earns a score bonus.

Other licensed &quot;Popeye&quot; characters in the game are Olive Oyl, Swee&#x27;Pea, and Wimpy.

== Development ==
&quot;Popeye&quot; was designed by Genyo Takeda and Shigeru Miyamoto. Previously, Nintendo had originally intended to make a video game based on the &quot;Popeye&quot; characters, but was denied a license, so the characters of Mario, Donkey Kong, and Pauline were developed for &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; (1981). Nintendo managed to acquire the license to the &quot;Popeye&quot; characters after the success of &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;, allowing them to develop a game based on them.

==Ports==
Parker Brothers ported the game to the Atari 8-bit computers, Atari 2600, Atari 5200, Intellivision, Commodore 64, TI-99/4A, and ColecoVision. It is one of the few games ported to the Magnavox Odyssey².

On July 15, 1983, &quot;Popeye&quot; became one of the three launch games for the Famicom, along with &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; and &quot;Donkey Kong Jr.&quot;.

==Reception==
In the United States, &quot;Popeye&quot; topped the &quot;Play Meter&quot; arcade chart for street locations in April 1983.

&quot;Electronic Games&quot; wrote in 1983 that the arcade version of &quot;Popeye&quot; at first appeared to be &quot;yet another variation of a theme that&#x27;s become all too familiar since &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; [...] But there are some nuances, not the least of which are the graphics and sound effects, that tend to allow the game the benefit of the doubt in execution. [...] &quot;Popeye&quot; does offer some interesting play that is more than complemented by the cosmetics.&quot; The &quot;Arcade Express&quot; newsletter scored it 7 out of 10 in January 1983, calling it &quot;the closest thing to a videogame cartoon seen yet in an arcade&quot;, but also that &quot;game play, unfortunately, doesn&#x27;t come up to visual standards.&quot; Michael Pugliese writing for &quot;The Coin Slot&quot; described &quot;Popeye&quot; as &quot;a visually stimulating and exciting game that will go well in any location [...] it contains all the challenges and character appeal to make it a solid earner for a long time.&quot; &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; magazine gave the arcade game a generally favorable review.

&quot;Antic&quot; wrote that the Atari 8-bit version &quot;is a thoroughly entertaining challenge for gamers of all ages&quot; and that its mechanics unique among climbing games gave it above-average replay value. &quot;Computer Games&quot; magazine gave the ColecoVision and home computer conversions an A rating, calling &quot;Popeye&quot; a &quot;terrific cartoony climbing game, much better than &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;&quot;.

==Legacy==
&quot;Popeye no Eigo Asobi&quot; is an English teaching spin-off for Famicom, released on November 22, 1983. A board game based on the video game was released by Parker Brothers in 1983.

In 2008, Namco Networks released an enhanced remake for mobile phones. The gameplay is largely the same, plus an enhanced mode with a bonus stage and an extra level that pays homage to the short &quot;A Dream Walking&quot; where Popeye must save Olive from sleepwalking. Tokens are earned to buy old comic strips.

On November 4, 2021, &quot;Popeye&quot; was released for the PS4 and Nintendo Switch as a 3D reimagining of the arcade game. It was met with poor Metacritic scores. It was delisted in 2023.

Ben Falls earned the world record score of 3,023,060 on December 20, 2011, according to the Twin Galaxies International Scoreboard.

<text>Knokke () is a town in the municipality of Knokke-Heist, which is located in the province of West Flanders in Flanders, Belgium. The town itself has 15,708 inhabitants (2007), while the municipality of Knokke-Heist has 33,818 inhabitants (2009).
Knokke is the most north-eastern seaside resort on the Belgian coast. It lies adjacent to the Dutch border; separated from the Dutch territory by the Zwin nature reserve. Knokke came into existence as a result of the construction of dikes that were to protect the area around the &#x27;Zwin&#x27; sea-arm.

Originally a vacation haven for the city folk of Brussels in the early 19th century, artists such as James Ensor, Alfred Verwee and others started to frequent the small hamlet to paint its beautiful vistas. The artists rented a small miller&#x27;s cottage and founded the &quot;Cercle des Artistes&quot; in 1880. It gradually became a resort town with upscale clientele, restaurants and shops. St. George&#x27;s Anglican Church serves the English-speaking community.

Nowadays Knokke is well known for its beaches and for the dike system to which it owes its origins. The largest of Belgium&#x27;s ten casinos, Knokke Casino, is located on a seaside promenade and is open 20 hours a day.

The town lies at the northern end of the Belgian Coast Tram line and is also served by NMBS trains at Knokke railway station. The N34 connects Knokke to De Panne.

==In popular culture==
Knokke is immortalised in the Jacques Brel song, &quot;Jacky (La Chanson de Jacky)&quot;: &quot;Even if one day in Knokke-le-Zoute/I become, as I fear/Singer for old women...&quot; It does not feature in the English language version written by Mort Shuman.

In the 1970s the town was the host of the light entertainment competition for the Golden Sea swallow of Knokke. In 1976 the British entry, BBC&#x27;s &quot;The Norman Wisdom Show&quot;, won first prize.

The successful 2023 Belgian-Flemish television series &quot;Knokke Off&quot; was filmed and set in Knokke.

<text>Windsor Arena (nicknamed The Barn) is an indoor arena located in Windsor, Ontario. Its capacity is approximately 4,400 with standing room. The arena&#x27;s ice is by or . The arena was the home of the Windsor Spitfires of the Ontario Hockey League from 1975 to 2008, at which time the team&#x27;s home was moved to the WFCU Centre.

== History ==

Originally named the Border Cities Arena, it hosted the Detroit Cougars (later renamed the Detroit Red Wings) for the 1926-1927 NHL season, while the Olympia Stadium was under construction. The Border Cities Arena, built in 1925 for the local junior hockey team, was expanded from 6,000 to 9,000 for the Cougars. The arena was later renamed the Windsor Arena.

Having been constructed in 1924, the arena is among the oldest of its type in North America.

In 2006, the WFCU Centre, located in the city&#x27;s east side off Lauzon Road, was approved by the Windsor city council. The decision to replace the arena is attributed to complaints about Windsor Arena&#x27;s seating and tiny concourses.

The Spitfires&#x27; final game at the Windsor Arena was played on December 4, 2008. Windsor beat the Guelph Storm 2-1, giving the Spitfires a perfect 12-0 record at The Barn for the 2008-09 season.

From 2009 until 2013, the University of Windsor Lancers hockey teams took over as the major tenants of the arena.
Also, the Windsor Minor Hockey Association used this arena for games until 2013.

In February 2014, the arena was used as a site for salt storage. I In April 2014, Catholic Central High School proposed a plan to construct a new school on the site, with the full demolition of Windsor Arena being part of the plan without any emphasis. The City of Windsor approved the plan to build the new Catholic Central High School on the site, but the plans never came to fruition and the school was constructed elsewhere.

<doc id="759903" wikidata="Q1426589" url="?curid=759903" title="A Ghost Is Born">
<text>A Ghost Is Born is the fifth studio album by the American rock band Wilco, released on June 22, 2004, by Nonesuch Records. It features singer Jeff Tweedy on lead guitar more than any previous Wilco album. The band streamed the album online free, and offered a five-song EP to purchasers.

Tweedy entered a rehab clinic shortly before the release of the album, delaying its release by two weeks. It also shortened its promotional tour. Despite this, &quot;A Ghost Is Born&quot;&#x27;s opening week was the best sales week for the band at the time, and the album was met with positive reviews from major publications such as &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; and PopMatters. The album earned Wilco a Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album.

==Production==
Wilco signed a contract with Nonesuch Records in November 2001 after a lengthy dispute with Reprise Records over the release of the band&#x27;s fourth album &quot;Yankee Hotel Foxtrot&quot;. &quot;Foxtrot&quot; was welcomed with positive reviews from &quot;The Village Voice&quot;—where the album was rated by the critics as the best album of 2002—and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. It sold over 590,000 copies, earning a Gold certification by the Recording Industry Association of America.

===Composition===
Recording for a new album began in November 2003 under the working title &quot;Wilco Happens&quot;. The album was produced by Jim O&#x27;Rourke, who mixed &quot;Foxtrot&quot; and was a member of Wilco side project Loose Fur. O&#x27;Rourke encouraged lead singer Jeff Tweedy to develop his guitar skills for the album; Tweedy recently became the lead guitarist for the band due to the dismissal of Jay Bennett after the &quot;Yankee Hotel Foxtrot&quot; recording sessions. Tweedy sought to play solos on the album that were unlike those of jam bands such as Phish and The Grateful Dead. Instead, he performed composed solos influenced by Television such as the one during the coda of &quot;At Least That&#x27;s What You Said&quot;. Tweedy refers to the guitar solo at the end of the track as a &quot;musical transcription&quot; of one of his panic attacks. &quot;A Ghost Is Born&quot; was recorded in a manner different from &quot;Foxtrot&quot; or 1999&#x27;s &quot;Summerteeth&quot;; whereas those recordings were performed live in the studio and then extensively de-constructed and arranged in Pro Tools, &quot;A Ghost Is Born&quot; was first performed live, edited and arranged in Pro Tools, and then performed and re-recorded with minimal overdubbing. Tweedy was excited about writing an album this way:

An unusual feature of &quot;A Ghost Is Born&quot; is the fifteen-minute long track &quot;Less Than You Think&quot;. The first part of the song begins as a ballad which references belief systems and atheism which after 3 minutes, fades out. The second part consists of electronic drones and noise, intended to audibly represent the migraines that lead singer Jeff Tweedy had been suffering from while addicted to pain killers during the recording sessions for &quot;A Ghost Is Born&quot;. For the song, each band member created a synthesizer noise that mimicked an electronic sound. The installations were simultaneously activated in the room and recorded. The noise, which served as the coda to the song, was remixed to provide dynamics to the track. Calling it &quot;the track that everyone will hate,&quot; Tweedy defended the song&#x27;s inclusion on the album:

&quot;A Ghost Is Born&quot; was the first Wilco album with pianist Mikael Jorgensen; he had previously worked as an engineer with the band on their collaboration with The Minus 5. Jeff Tweedy provided lead vocals and acted as lead guitarist for the only time since the band formed. John Stirratt, the only original member aside from Tweedy, played bass and guitar. Glenn Kotche and Jim O&#x27;Rourke, Tweedy&#x27;s associates from Loose Fur, acted as drummer and multi-instrumentalist, respectively. Leroy Bach played a variety of keyboards as well as bass guitar. All members of the band contributed with a synthesizer part on &quot;Less Than You Think&quot;.

==Marketing and promotion==
Wilco began touring in support of &quot;Ghost&quot; even before the album had been released. Multi-instrumentalist Leroy Bach left the band after the recording sessions to join a theater production, so Wilco added jazz rock guitarist Nels Cline and multi-instrumentalist Pat Sansone to replace him. Sansone had been playing with The Autumn Defense, a side project led by bassist John Stirratt. However, the tour to support the album had to be abridged. In May 2004, Tweedy checked himself into a rehabilitation clinic in Chicago, Illinois due to chronic migraine headaches, anxiety attacks, and clinical depression. In the process of treating the ailments, Tweedy became addicted to prescription painkillers. His rehab led to the cancellation of the European stage of the tour and a delay in the album&#x27;s release date. Intended for release on June 8, 2004, the album was officially released on June 22, 2004.

The band also webcast the album in its entirety on the Internet in a promotion with Apple Computer. Nonesuch was willing to allow the MPEG-4 broadcast due to the success of a similar broadcast in the promotion of &quot;Yankee Hotel Foxtrot&quot;. Additionally, Wilco offered a free EP to purchasers of the album. The EP featured two outtakes from the album—&quot;Panthers&quot; and &quot;Kicking Television&quot;—and live versions of &quot;At Least That&#x27;s What You Said&quot;, &quot;The Late Greats&quot;, and &quot;Handshake Drugs&quot;. The EP was later packaged with the album and sold as a &quot;deluxe version&quot;.

==Reception==
In its debut week, &quot;A Ghost Is Born&quot; peaked at number 8 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart and sold over 81,000 copies, the highest US chart peak and best sales week ever attained by the band at that time. The album was an international hit as well, peaking at number 24 in Norway, number 29 in Sweden, number 33 in New Zealand, number 34 in Belgium, and number 37 in Ireland. As of April 13, 2007, the album has sold over 340,000 copies in the United States, according to Nielsen SoundScan.

Like &quot;Foxtrot&quot;, &quot;A Ghost Is Born&quot; was well received by critics. On Metacritic, the album holds a score of 81 out of 100 from 33 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. Jon Pareles of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called &quot;A Ghost Is Born&quot; &quot;as eerie as anything Wilco have recorded yet&quot; and applauded Tweedy for offering &quot;illuminating curiosity about what can happen in a song.&quot; &quot;Billboard&quot; cited it as Wilco&#x27;s &quot;most difficult and uncompromising album to date.&quot; Akiva Gottlieb of &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot; praised &quot;A Ghost Is Born&quot; as being &quot;even more brilliant&quot; than &quot;Yankee Hotel Foxtrot&quot;, a sentiment echoed by Michael Metevier of &quot;PopMatters&quot;, who added that the album made him &quot;surprised and delighted enough to last several lifetimes.&quot; Keith Phipps of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; wrote that &quot;A Ghost Is Born&quot; &quot;channels its shaggy sound into pop music&quot; that &quot;constantly threatens to erupt into noise or fade into silence, but it&#x27;s still hard not to hum along.&quot; James Hunter of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; felt that &quot;Wilco&#x27;s ideas are unremarkable, but are worked out with intelligence and striking conception. And as it happens, the new organic emphasis tables some of Wilco&#x27;s lamer stylistic obsessions.&quot; &quot;Q&quot; called the album &quot;more meandering&quot; than &quot;Yankee Hotel Foxtrot&quot;, but also &quot;more confident, more coherent, yielding an all-enveloping warmth that&#x27;s entirely resistant to any iPod shuffle function.&quot;

Among mixed reviews, Rob Mitchum of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; criticized &quot;A Ghost Is Born&quot; as &quot;wildly uneven&quot; and &quot;less cohesive than any other Wilco release.&quot; &quot;Village Voice&quot; critic Robert Christgau called it a &quot;privileged self-indulgence&quot; due to its extreme musical dynamics. &quot;NME&quot; wrote of the album: &quot;It&#x27;s like Scissor Sisters on tranquilisers. With a bit of ELO. And a dash of Ramones. And, with this eclecticism, a worrying lack of focus.&quot; Joshua Klein of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; felt that the album possessed an &quot;incomplete&quot; quality which nonetheless can be &quot;quite intriguing, more of a side step than a forward leap, but a worthy experiment all the same.&quot; Ann Powers of &quot;Blender&quot; wrote that on first listen, the album is &quot;rather monotonous, a bunch of moderately singable tunes with some noise piled up around the edges&quot;, but that it &quot;starts to insinuate meaning&quot; over subsequent listens.

In 2005, &quot;A Ghost Is Born&quot; won two Grammy Awards for Best Alternative Music Album and Best Recording Package. Although the band was nominated for Grammys for work on previous albums, this was the first time that they won one. The band only won one award, as the winner for Best Recording Package is credited towards the artist of the artwork, not the performer.

<text>The Écossaise (in French, &quot;Scottish&quot;) is a musical form and a type of contradanse in a Scottish style – a Scottish country dance at least in name – that was popular in France and Great Britain at the end of the 18th century and at the beginning of the 19th. Despite the Écossaise mimicking a Scottish country dance, it is actually French in origin. The écossaise was usually danced in 2/4 time in two lines, with men facing the women. As the dance is executed, couples progress to the head of the line.

Écossaise compositions were mainly written for solo piano, so that couples could dance to it. The musical form was also adopted by some classical composers, including Ludwig van Beethoven, (WoO 83 and WoO 86 for piano and WoO 22 and WoO 23, now lost, for military band); Franz Schubert, (D.145, 158, 299, 421, 511, 529, 643, 697, 734, 735, 781, 782, 783, 816, and 977); Frédéric Chopin (Op. 72 number 3) and Cécile Chaminade&#x27;s &quot;Écossaise,&quot; Op. 151.

<doc id="759912" wikidata="Q3283375" url="?curid=759912" title="The Sonny &amp; Cher Comedy Hour">
<text>The Sonny &amp; Cher Comedy Hour is an American variety show starring American pop singers Sonny Bono and Cher, who were married to each other at the time. The show ran on CBS in the United States, and premiered in August 1971. The show was cancelled in May 1974, due to the couple&#x27;s divorce, but the duo reunited in 1976 for the similarly formatted &quot;The Sonny and Cher Show&quot; (a title sporadically used during the run of the &quot;Comedy Hour&quot;), which ran for two seasons, ending August 29, 1977.

==&quot;The Sonny &amp; Cher Nitty Gritty Hour&quot; (1971)==
&quot;The Sonny &amp; Cher Comedy Hour&quot; was preceded by a one-off television special titled &quot;The Sonny &amp; Cher Nitty Gritty Hour&quot;. Commissioned by the Canadian network CTV, it was recorded in 1970 and aired on May 31, 1971, at 8:30 p.m. on Channel 4 in Toronto. The special featured guest appearances by Sandy Baron, Suzanne Charney, Billy Van, Jerelyn Homer, psychologist Dr. Joyce Brothers and Andrea Davidson of the National Ballet of Canada. &quot;The Sonny &amp; Cher Nitty Gritty Hour&quot; was produced by Ernest D. Glucksman, directed by Tim Kiley and executive produced by Philip Wedge. The writing team included Sandy Baron, Neal Marshall and Dennis Klein.

The program combined musical performances with comedic sketches, focusing on themes of relationships and gender dynamics. Sonny and Cher performed &quot;We&#x27;ve Only Just Begun&quot; and humorously portrayed their professional partnership. A recurring &quot;battle of the sexes&quot; theme featured sketches on topics such as in-laws and household dynamics. Cher performed &quot;Alfie&quot; in a solo number exploring modern women&#x27;s conflicts, illustrated through contrasting dance styles—one representing innocence, the other experience—culminating in Cher dancing in underwear, symbolizing her struggle between traditional and contemporary values. The special also presented portrayals of historical couples such as Samson and Delilah, Christopher Columbus and Queen Isabella, and Julius Caesar and Cleopatra. Other segments included &quot;I&#x27;m Getting Married&quot;, a comedy sketch with Billy Van and Sandy Baron, and an advice feature with Dr. Joyce Brothers providing relationship insights.

Although sometimes described as a pilot to CBS&#x27;s &quot;The Sonny &amp; Cher Comedy Hour&quot;, the &quot;Nitty Gritty Hour&quot; was originally produced and broadcast exclusively in Canada. In 2015, choreographer David Winters claimed he initially conceived Sonny and Cher&#x27;s television format, envisioning a comedy-music blend with playful insults between Sonny and Cher. According to Winters, he developed the concept as a TV special and pilot, aiming for an ABC summer series, but the network chose the Smothers Brothers instead. He alleged that CBS later copied the idea, hired new producers and writers, and signed Sonny and Cher for their own series, &quot;The Sonny &amp; Cher Comedy Hour&quot;, which became a major hit. Despite feeling wronged, Winters said he refrained from legal action to avoid conflicts with a major network but remained convinced his idea was the foundation of the successful CBS show.

==&quot;The Sonny &amp; Cher Comedy Hour&quot; (1971–1974)==
By 1971, Sonny &amp; Cher had stopped producing hit singles as a duet act. Cher&#x27;s first feature film, &quot;Chastity&quot;, was not a success, and the duo decided to sing and tell jokes in nightclubs across the country. CBS head of programming Fred Silverman saw them one evening and offered them their own show. &quot;The Sonny &amp; Cher Comedy Hour&quot; was originally supposed to be a summer replacement series, but high ratings gave Silverman sufficient reason to bring it back later that year, with a permanent spot on the schedule. The show was taped at CBS Television City in Hollywood.

The show was a top-20 hit in the ratings for its entire run. Each episode opened with the show&#x27;s theme song, which segued into the first few notes of &quot;The Beat Goes On&quot;. Every episode, Sonny exchanged banter with Cher, allowing Cher to put down Sonny in a sarcastic, yet comic manner. Comedy skits followed, mixed with musical numbers. At the end of each episode, Sonny and Cher sang their hit &quot;I Got You Babe&quot; to the audience.

Many regular cast members appeared in sketches. Some notables include Teri Garr, Murray Langston (who later found brief fame as &quot;The Unknown Comic&quot; on &quot;The Gong Show&quot;), and Steve Martin (who also served as one of the show&#x27;s writers). Regulars included:

*Peter Cullen (1971–1974)
*Freeman King (1971–1974)
*Murray Langston (1971–1974)
*Clark Carr (1971–1972)
*Tom Solari (1971–1972)
*Ted Zeigler (1971–1974)
*Steve Martin (1972–1975)
*Billy Van (1973–1976)
*Bob Einstein (1973–1974)
*Teri Garr (1973–1974)
*Gene Merlino (1971–1974)

Among the many guests who appeared on &quot;The Sonny &amp; Cher Comedy Hour&quot; were Carol Burnett, George Burns, Glen Campbell, Tony Curtis, Bobby Darin, Phyllis Diller, Merv Griffin, the Jackson 5, Jerry Lee Lewis, Ronald Reagan, Burt Reynolds, The Righteous Brothers, Dinah Shore, Sally Struthers, the Supremes, Chuck Berry, and Dick Clark.

The show was scheduled to return for a fourth season in October 1974, but Sonny and Cher separated that fall, resulting in the cancellation of the show.

In 2004, selected episodes from &quot;The Sonny &amp; Cher Comedy Hour&quot; were released in a three-disc set called &quot;The Sonny &amp; Cher Ultimate Collection: The Best of The Sonny &amp; Cher Comedy Hour and The Sonny and Cher Show&quot; on Region 1 DVD.

===Recurring routines===
*The Vamp Sketch: A sequence featuring at least three mini-skits, Cher played notorious women in history (e.g.: Cleopatra, Nefertiti, Marlene Dietrich), each one preceded by Cher in a parlor setting lying atop an old-style upright piano with Sonny pretending to play, singing one verse of the song between each mini-skit (the lyrics usually set up the next mini-skit), followed by the chorus, &quot;She was a scamp, a camp and a bit of a tramp, she was a V-A-M-P, vamp&quot;. It ended with all the characters from each skit (even Sonny and Cher, via camera trickery, in their respective costumes) all converging to sing the final chorus together. In later seasons, the Vamp sketch was replaced with &quot;Shady Miss Lady Luck&quot;, a similar group of mini-sketches that were bracketed by Cher in a Las Vegas-style setting.
*Sonny&#x27;s Pizza: Sonny is the proprietor of a pizza restaurant whose food, according to almost everyone except Sonny himself, is not fit to be eaten (the logo on the front door is augmented with the slogan, &quot;You won&#x27;t believe you ate the whole thing&quot;, a play on the then-popular Alka-Seltzer commercial).
*Mr. &amp; Ms.: This gender-bending sketch has Cher as the breadwinner in the household, working as a business executive and wearing a three-piece suit. She would come home to Sonny, a beleaguered house-husband who usually complained about how bad his day had been.
* The Fortune Teller: Cher is inside a fortune-telling vending machine. When Sonny inserted a quarter to hear his fortune, she would give bad news or insults, but anyone else, particularly a given week&#x27;s guest star, would get a good fortune that would almost immediately come true.
* At the Launderette: A laundromat sketch that has Cher as Laverne, a housewife with tacky fashion sense cracking jokes to straight-woman Olivia, played by Garr.

== &quot;The Sonny Comedy Revue&quot; (1974) ==
In 1974, Sonny and Cher agreed to end the show, as they were separating from each other. Their timeslot was given to &quot;Tony Orlando and Dawn&quot; the next fall. They both starred in separate variety shows over the next two years. Sonny Bono&#x27;s 1974 variety series, &quot;The Sonny Comedy Revue&quot;, led off the ABC Sunday-night lineup, but lasted just 13 episodes. While it retained the creative team behind &quot;The Sonny &amp; Cher Comedy Hour,&quot; Bono&#x27;s solo effort was largely a victim of the show&#x27;s weak time slot and the established hits it faced on NBC and CBS. Initially, when Cher was reported as appearing in her own show on CBS,&quot;TV Guide&quot; predicted that Sonny&#x27;s show would be the greater success.

== &quot;Cher&quot; (1975–1976) ==
Starting in early 1975, Cher also returned to network television with her solo variety show, entitled &quot;Cher&quot;, which also aired on CBS. It did well during its abbreviated run and was renewed for the 1975–76 season. During the second season, though, Cher herself decided to end the show to work with Sonny again. Although Sonny&#x27;s show had most of the cast and crew from the comedy hour (except the musical director) and was expected to be the bigger hit, Cher&#x27;s show easily became the greater success, both in the ratings and by fan response. Due to contracts, Cher was unable to perform many of her sketches and characters from the comedy hour on her show; Sonny had them on his show, instead.

Among the many guests who appeared on the &quot;Cher&quot; show were Bette Midler, Elton John, Pat Boone, David Bowie, Ray Charles, Steve Martin, The Jackson 5, Ike &amp; Tina Turner, Dion, Wayne Newton, Linda Ronstadt, Flip Wilson, Lily Tomlin, Frankie Valli, Tatum O&#x27;Neal, Raquel Welch, Wayne Rogers, and Labelle.

==&quot;The Sonny and Cher Show&quot; (1976–1977)==
In February 1976, with the bitterness of their divorce behind them, the couple reunited for &quot;The Sonny and Cher Show&quot;. This incarnation of the series was produced by veteran musical variety-show writers, Frank Peppiatt and John Aylesworth. It was basically the same format as their first variety series, but with different writers to create new sketches and songs. A new logo – a stylized hand with fingers crossed – symbolized their working relationship.

The duo&#x27;s opening conversations were markedly more subdued and made low-key references to the couple&#x27;s divorce, as well as Cher&#x27;s subsequent marriage to Gregg Allman. (During production, Cher was pregnant with and eventually bore Allman&#x27;s son, Elijah). Some jokes would become awkward; in one opening segment Cher gave Sonny a compliment, and Sonny jokingly replied &quot;That&#x27;s not what you said in the courtroom!&quot; Nonetheless, the revived series garnered enough ratings to be renewed for a second season. By this time, however, the variety show genre was already in steep decline, and &quot;Sonny and Cher&quot; was one of the few successful programs of the genre remaining on the air. The show&#x27;s final season, which aired as a mid-season replacement in the winter of 1977, was moved to the Friday night death slot, with the last episodes burned off in a late-evening Monday nighttime slot not typically used for comedy or variety series that summer.

The cast of regulars included &quot;Comedy Hour&quot; alums Ted Zeigler and Billy Van, Gailard Sartain (on loan from Peppiatt and Aylesworth&#x27;s other series &quot;Hee Haw&quot;), announcer Jack Harrell (who later gained fame as the longtime announcer for the original version of &quot;The People&#x27;s Court&quot;), and mime duo Shields and Yarnell. Billy Van left the show during season 1.

Some of the guests who appeared on &quot;The Sonny and Cher Show&quot; included Frankie Avalon, Muhammad Ali, Raymond Burr, Ruth Buzzi, Charo, Barbara Eden, Neil Sedaka, Farrah Fawcett, Bob Hope, Don Knotts, Jerry Lewis, Tony Orlando, The Osmonds, Debbie Reynolds, The Smothers Brothers, Tina Turner, Twiggy, The Jacksons, and Betty White.

==Production notes==
&quot;The Sonny &amp; Cher Comedy Hour&quot; taped its opening and closing segments in front of a live studio audience. The Sonny &amp; Cher &quot;concert&quot; segment was also taped in front of the same audience, as were some of the segments featuring musical guest stars—as these typically were taped after the closing segment was completed. Due to blocking, costuming, and other staging and production requirements, most of the comedy segments were taped without an audience, with a laugh track added in postproduction.

==Syndication==
Reruns of the series were seen on TV Land at the time of its launch in April 1996, with both the 1971–74 series and the 1976–77 series being treated as one; however, only about 65 of the original 100 episodes were aired. TV Land then edited the shows down to 30-minute episodes from the original hour, and ultimately discontinued broadcasting the series in 2000. From 2016 to 2020, getTV broadcast several episodes of both the 1971–74 and 1976–77 series, including some which had never aired on TV Land. In addition, getTV also carried the series &quot;Cher&quot; under a separate contract.

<text>The toolbar, also called a bar or standard toolbar (originally known as ribbon), is a graphical control element on which on-screen icons can be used. A toolbar often allows for quick access to functions that are commonly used in the program. Some examples of functions a toolbar might have are open file, save, and change font. Toolbars are usually distinguished from palettes by their integration into the edges of the screen or of other windows. This can result in wasted space if multiple underpopulated bars are stacked atop each other or interface inefficiency if overloaded bars are placed on small windows.

== Variants ==
There are several user interface elements derived from toolbars:
* An address bar, location bar or URL bar is a toolbar that mainly consists of a text box. It typically accepts URLs or file system addresses. They are found in web browsers and file managers.
* A breadcrumb or breadcrumb trail allows users to keep track of their locations within a program or a file system. They are toolbars whose contents dynamically change to indicate the navigation path.
* A ribbon was originally used to refer to a toolbar, but it now means a complex user interface which consists of multiple toolbars chosen between through tabs.
* A taskbar is a toolbar provided by an operating system to launch, monitor and manipulate software. A taskbar may hold other sub-toolbars.
A search box is not in itself a toolbar but one may appear within a toolbar, as is the case with the address bar.

Toolbars may appear in various software. Some web browsers allow the user to customize its toolbars&#x27; contents or location. Plug-ins can be used to add new toolbars to some programs.

Sometimes trojan horse viruses will take the form of a toolbar.

<text>Buffalo Memorial Auditorium, colloquially known as The Aud, was a multipurpose indoor arena in downtown Buffalo, New York. Opened on October 14, 1940, it was home to the Canisius Golden Griffins (NCAA), the Buffalo Bisons (AHL), the Buffalo Bisons (NBL), the Buffalo Braves (NBA), the Buffalo Sabres (NHL), the Toronto-Buffalo Royals (WTT), the Buffalo Stallions (MISL), the Buffalo Bandits (MILL), the Buffalo Blizzard (NPSL) and the Buffalo Stampede (RHI). It also hosted events such as college basketball, concerts, professional wrestling and boxing. The venue was closed in 1996 after the construction of the venue now known as KeyBank Center, and remained vacant until being demolished in 2009.

==History==

===Planning and construction===
The Buffalo Memorial Auditorium was a public works project designed by Green &amp; James to replace the aging Broadway Auditorium and Fort Erie&#x27;s recently collapsed Peace Bridge Arena. In June 1938, city officials sent a loan and grant application to the Public Works Administration for funds to build the structure. The approval of the $1.2 million grant was announced in Washington, D.C., on October 7, 1938. Construction at the junction of the Erie Canal and Main-Hamburg Canal began on November 30, 1939.

The Auditorium&#x27;s construction brought a great deal of activity to downtown Buffalo. On December 31, 1939, &quot;Buffalo Evening News&quot; reporter Nat Gorham wrote:

===Opening and reception===

Built for $2.7 million, Memorial Auditorium&#x27;s grand opening celebration took place on October 14, 1940. The dedication event was a luncheon attended by 3,000 people, including the mayors of more than 60 local communities. The building was dedicated as a war memorial to those who had perished in World War I. The arena originally seated 12,280 for ice hockey, with an additional 2,000-3,000 seats in the floor area for basketball and other events. Memorial Auditorium&#x27;s first event—a rally for Republican presidential candidate Wendell Willkie—took place on October 14, 1940. In its first seven months, events such as auto shows, roller skating, circuses and dog shows drew nearly one million spectators. All told, the Auditorium&#x27;s first year attendance was 1.3 million.

===Alterations===

An $8.7 million renovation took place after the 1970–71 inauguration of the Sabres and Braves franchises, making it a more suitable home for the NHL and NBA. The arena&#x27;s roof was raised to make room for an upper level that increased the arena&#x27;s capacity from 10,449 for hockey to over 17,000 for basketball and 15,360 for hockey in 1971–72, to 15,668 for hockey in 1972–73, and to 15,858 for hockey in 1973–74.

Other changes to the Aud&#x27;s original design included:

* A new scoreboard, which would be the Aud&#x27;s final scoreboard upgrade. 
* A new upper level with stairways, escalators and upper exits. 
* Repainted and replaced seats. The original gray seats at the top of the lower bowl were painted blue, and all seats in the lower sections were replaced with cushioned seats in the Red and Gold sections.
* The removal of exit tunnels in Red sections 6, 7, 14, 15, 22, 23, 30 and 31, and Blue sections 2, 3, 10, 11, 18, 19, 26, 27, 34 and 35. The areas the tunnels occupied were replaced with seats, and the continuous wall that separated the red and blue sections was opened at each stairway. 
* The removed exit tunnel openings in the wall that separated the red and upper gold sections were closed into a continuous wall between the remaining red exit tunnels.

The Aud&#x27;s seats were mostly made of white ash, but the gold seats were converted to padded cushion seats. From top to bottom (floor level), the seating colors went orange, blue (originally grey), red and gold.

In 1974, the city added five seats, increasing capacity for hockey in the 1974–1975 season to 15,863. After the hockey season, the city removed the walls and aisle that separated the upper gold and red seating sections. The 570 gold seats the city installed in the vacant space raised the arena&#x27;s capacity to 16,433 for hockey and over 18,000 for basketball.

In the late 1980s, the Buffalo Common Council and mayor James D. Griffin scaled back plans to renovate the Aud after the Sabres&#x27; owners made it clear the franchise&#x27;s long-term viability depended upon a new arena. A compromise led the city to agree to build a new venue (Marine Midland Arena) and keep the Aud functional until the new arena was complete. The 1990 renovation added designated handicap-accessible seating areas (lowering the seating capacity to 16,325 for hockey), new air conditioning and elevators. The money the city borrowed for these improvements was not repaid until 2001, five years after the Aud closed.

===Closing and vacancy===

The Aud closed in 1996, at which time the Sabres, Bandits and Blizzard moved to Marine Midland Arena. After 1996, the building remained vacant, although members of Studio Arena Theatre used the floor as a surface for painting backgrounds. During the 2001–02 season, Sabres officials and the city moved items from the Aud&#x27;s main concourse to the new venue, by then renamed HSBC Arena, including a sign for the &quot;Pour Man&#x27;s Aud Club&quot; which was reincarnated at the new venue.

In 2003, the Sabres filmed a 30-minute infomercial inside the Aud to promote season ticket sales. While the production showed the arena was intact, it was without utilities and the crew had to supply all light and electrical sources.

The Aud continued to deteriorate after the 2003 production visit. Water pipes ruptured, moisture began to take its toll and the city&#x27;s lax monitoring led to graffiti, vandalism and theft of many artifacts. A segment aired during the CBC Television &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot; broadcast of the 2008 NHL Winter Classic showed the arena&#x27;s seating bowl and floor were virtually untouched. Notably, the advertisements on the boards from the final Sabres game in 1996 against the Hartford Whalers and the scoreboard above center ice remained. The door to the Sabres&#x27; penalty box was gone, as it had been presented as a memento to notable Sabres enforcer Rob Ray.

===Demolition===

The city abandoned its plans to repurpose the Aud as a Bass Pro Shops store on March 29, 2007, when Bass Pro announced it would construct a new building on the site after the auditorium&#x27;s demolition.

In December 2007, the city sold the Aud to the Erie Canal Harbor Development Corporation for $1 in hopes it would lead to asbestos removal and demolition. All salvageable items were to be removed and sold or stored. The sales of these artifacts, especially of seats, would help pay for a memorial to the Aud. The salvaged items include art deco flag holders, limestone eagles, a time capsule as well as a number of blue and orange level seats, which were sold at auction.

The city also salvaged ten cylindrical stainless steel &quot;ice tanks&quot; that helped maintain chilly conditions at ice level during hockey season and cooled spectators during warmer weather. In 2007, the city moved them to Shea&#x27;s Performing Arts Center as part of a $1.5 million overhaul of the landmark theater&#x27;s heating and cooling system.

Asbestos removal and other environmental remediation took place in late 2008 and the expected $10 million demolition of the Aud began in January 2009. On February 9, 2009, the &quot;Buffalo Memorial Auditorium&quot; entablature above the main entrance fell and much of the front façade met the same fate soon afterward. The &quot;Farewell Buffalo Memorial Auditorium Ceremony&quot; took place on June 30, 2009, at 1:30 pm when officials opened the copper box time capsule. The structure&#x27;s final pieces came down in early July 2009.

In February 2010, Bass Pro Shops announced that it was no longer pursuing a store in Buffalo, leaving the site vacant.

===Legacy===

After the Bass Pro Shops decision, the Erie Canal Harbor Development Corporation began to convert the site (known as the Aud Block) into an extension of Canalside with the junction of the old Erie Canal and Main-Hamburg Canal re-dug (although shallower than the original canals) and new bridges. The canals that opened in 2014 are frozen for skating and other winter activities by an underground refrigerant plant housed in a rebuilt sub-basement that was part of Memorial Auditorium. In addition, a marker on the canal ice denotes center ice&#x27;s former location.

Across Main Street at LECOM Harborcenter is the one-of-a-kind Tim Hortons restaurant with a memorial to the Auditorium. A statue of the chain&#x27;s founder and namesake, who played at the arena during his time with the Buffalo Sabres, occupies the corner of the site facing the restaurant.

==Notable events==

===Basketball===

====College====

Before the National Basketball Association and National Hockey League came to Buffalo, college basketball was Memorial Auditorium&#x27;s most popular sporting event. On December 11, 1940, the Auditorium hosted its first college basketball game when Canisius College played the University of Oregon. Interest in college basketball grew after World War II, and the first college basketball sellout crowd occurred in the 1946–1947 season when 11,029 spectators saw Canisius lose to Notre Dame. Ten days later, a record 11,891 watched Canisius defeat Niagara 52–44.

While the teams were typically from Western New York, including Canisius, Niagara University, St. Bonaventure University, the University at Buffalo and Buffalo State College, other teams such as Cornell University took part. Over time, the rivalry among the &quot;Little Three&quot; colleges—Niagara, Canisius, and St. Bonaventure—came to dominate the Auditorium&#x27;s college basketball schedule. Throughout the 1950s, the three schools were all national powers, and their games at Memorial Auditorium drew strong local and national interest.

* The Aud hosted first-round games of the 1954 NCAA basketball tournament.
* The Auditorium hosted the men″s Division I ECAC Upstate Region tournament organized by the Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC) in 1975.
* In 1991, a visit from Buffalo native Christian Laettner and the national champion Duke University Blue Devils against Canisius drew an Aud collegiate-record crowd of 16,279.
* A 1996 Buffalo News article named Memorial Auditorium&#x27;s all-time all-visitors team: Ed Macauley (Saint Louis University), Tom Gola (La Salle University), Tom Heinsohn (College of the Holy Cross), Jerry West (West Virginia University), Willie Somerset (Duquesne University), Dave Bing (Syracuse University), Sonny Dove (St. John&#x27;s University) and Bob Lanier (St. Bonaventure University).

====National Basketball League====
The National Basketball League&#x27;s Buffalo Bisons were the first professional basketball franchise to call Memorial Auditorium home. The team featured center Don Otten and coach Nat Hickey, but on December 27, 1946—only 13 games into their inaugural season—owner Ben Kerner moved them to Moline, Illinois. After the 1949 merger of the National Basketball League and the Basketball Association of America and stops in Milwaukee and St. Louis, the team became the Atlanta Hawks.

====National Basketball Association====
Professional basketball returned to the Aud in 1970 with the National Basketball Association&#x27;s Buffalo Braves. The Braves were a modest success but often found the competing interests of the Sabres and the Little Three college teams made it difficult to schedule home games. The Braves moved to San Diego in 1978 and then to Los Angeles in 1984, where they are now the Los Angeles Clippers.

The NBA retained a presence at the venue by staging an annual series of preseason exhibitions called the NBA Classic:

* The Los Angeles Lakers defeated the New Jersey Nets 105–93 on October 24, 1988
* The New York Knicks defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers 96–93 on October 14, 1989
* The Chicago Bulls defeated the Miami Heat 115–107 on October 26, 1989
* The Boston Celtics defeated Washington Bullets 104–96 on October 26, 1990
* The Chicago Bulls defeated the Sacramento Kings 105–96 on October 27, 1992
* The New York Knicks defeated the Denver Nuggets 100–98 on October 17, 1995

====World University Games====
The basketball events of the World University Games were held at the venue in July 1993. The United States defeated Canada in the gold medal game 95–90 before a crowd of 11,000.

===Hockey===

====American Hockey League====
The American Hockey League&#x27;s Buffalo Bisons played 30 seasons at the Memorial Auditorium, beginning with the 1940–41 season. The Bisons won five Calder Cup championships, with the last coming in 1970 during the franchise&#x27;s final game. The team folded in 1970 after the National Hockey League awarded Buffalo an expansion team.

On May 15, 1973, the Cincinnati Swords, then the Sabres&#x27; AHL affiliate, played the final game of the 1973 Calder Cup Finals at the Auditorium. The Swords won the Calder Cup with a 5–1 win over the Nova Scotia Voyageurs in front of 15,019 fans—the largest playoff crowd in AHL history at the time. The Rochester Americans also played several games at the Aud after they became the Sabres&#x27; affiliate, including several during their 1987 Calder Cup championship season.

====National Hockey League====
The Buffalo Sabres made their Memorial Auditorium debut on October 15, 1970, in a game attended by NHL President Clarence Campbell that began with a ceremonial faceoff between Sabres captain Floyd Smith and Montreal Canadiens captain Jean Béliveau. The Sabres&#x27; Roger Crozier made 53 saves in a 3–0 loss.

The arena hosted games three, four, and six of the 1975 Stanley Cup Finals, where the Sabres faced the Philadelphia Flyers. Eventually, the Flyers would win their second consecutive Stanley Cup championship in game six at the arena. This was the only Stanley Cup Finals appearance made at the Auditorium.

On January 4, 1976, the Sabres played Krylya Sovetov as part of the &quot;Super Series&quot; of exhibitions between the Soviet Union&#x27;s two best club teams—CSKA Moscow and Krylia Sovietov (named &quot;Red Army&quot; and &quot;Soviet Wings&quot; respectively, during the series) and eight of the NHL&#x27;s top teams. The Sabres&#x27; 12–6 victory over the 1974 Soviet league and European Cup champions was the worst defeat ever for a professional Soviet hockey club.

Memorial Auditorium hosted the NHL All-Star Game on January 24, 1978. Two members of the Sabres&#x27; &quot;French Connection&quot; line—Gilbert Perreault and Rick Martin—played for the Wales Conference. Both had a significant impact: Martin scored a goal with 1:39 remaining in regulation to tie the game at 2–2 and force overtime, and Perreault scored the game-winning goal 3:55 into overtime to defeat the Campbell Conference 3–2.

The Edmonton Oilers&#x27; Wayne Gretzky made NHL history at the Aud on February 24, 1982, when he scored a natural hat trick during the game&#x27;s final seven minutes to help defeat the Sabres 6–3. Gretzky broke Phil Esposito&#x27;s record for goals in a season (76) with the hat trick&#x27;s first goal, his 77th of the season. In March 2009, Gretzky visited Buffalo as the Phoenix Coyotes&#x27; head coach and recounted his memories of Memorial Auditorium in an interview with &quot;Buffalo News&quot; hockey reporter Mike Harrington:

During a game at the Memorial Auditorium between the visiting St. Louis Blues and Clint Malarchuk&#x27;s Buffalo Sabres on March 22, 1989, Steve Tuttle of the Blues and Uwe Krupp of the Sabres crashed hard into the goal crease during play. As they collided, Tuttle&#x27;s skate blade hit the right front side of Malarchuk&#x27;s neck, severing his carotid artery and partially cutting his jugular vein.[2]

The venue hosted the 1991 NHL Entry Draft, notable for Eric Lindros being selected first overall by the Quebec Nordiques and refusing to sign with the team.

The Sabres occupied the Auditorium through the 1995–96 season, when they moved to nearby Marine Midland Arena, now known as KeyBank Center. Michael Peca scored the last in-game goal at the Aud while Pat LaFontaine put in a ceremonial goal after the 4–1 win over the Hartford Whalers. It was the last arena where the ice sheet fell short of the league-mandated by size (though Maple Leaf Gardens had irregularly shaped corners).

====College====
College hockey made its modern debut at Memorial Auditorium on January 23, 1972, when the University at Buffalo Bulls met the Central Collegiate Hockey Association&#x27;s Ohio State University. Ohio State won the game 5–2.

====Roller Hockey International====
Roller Hockey International&#x27;s Buffalo Stampede called the Aud home from 1994 to 1995, winning the league championship in their first season.

===Lacrosse===
====Major Indoor Lacrosse League====
The Buffalo Bandits of Major Indoor Lacrosse League played in the Aud from the 1992 season until the arena&#x27;s closure. Winners of the MILL title in 1992, 1993, and 1996, the Bandits are now a member of the National Lacrosse League and play at KeyBank Center.

===Soccer===

====Major Soccer League====
Major Soccer League&#x27;s Buffalo Stallions attracted 11,028 to their home debut at the Aud against the Philadelphia Fever on December 7, 1979. The team played in the venue until 1984. Soccer legend Eusébio notably finished his career playing for the Stallions in their inaugural season.

====National Professional Soccer League====
The Aud was home to the Buffalo Blizzard of the National Professional Soccer League from 1992 to 1996.

===Tennis===

In 1974, the Toronto-Buffalo Royals of World Team Tennis called the Aud home for one season.

===Figure skating===
The Auditorium has hosted numerous notable figure skating events:

* The Aud was one of the original venues that hosted Ice Capades in 1940.
* Ice Follies made its debut at the venue in 1941, and continued making regular stops after becoming Disney on Ice in 1981.
* The annual pageant to benefit the Skating Association for the Blind and Handicapped (SABAH) was staged at the venue from 1979 to 1996.
* The venue was host to the 1990 Skate America competition.

===Combat sports===

====Professional wrestling====

The first sporting event at the venue was a Great Lakes Athletic Club professional wrestling card on October 18, 1940, that was headlined by Ed Don George defeating Joe Savoldi. Great Lakes Athletic Club owner Jack Herman continued booking shows at the venue before selling the promotion in 1947 to Ed Don George, who changed the promotion&#x27;s name to Upstate Athletic Club. WBEN-TV would regularly broadcast Upstate Athletic Club&#x27;s cards from the venue in 1948. Don George would later sell the promotion to his matchmaker, Ignacio &quot;Pedro&quot; Martinez, in 1955. Ilio DiPaolo, the son-in-law of Martinez, was the promotion&#x27;s biggest star. WGR-TV broadcast Upstate Athletic Club&#x27;s cards from the venue in 1956 as &quot;Wrestling from War Memorial Auditorium&quot;. Martinez would continue booking shows at The Aud until 1968, when he ran into financial trouble and was forced to promote outside the area. He returned in 1970 with his National Wrestling Federation, but the promotion folded in 1974.

Jim Crockett Promotions debuted at the venue on July 19, 1980, with a show headlined by Ric Flair and Sweet Ebony Diamond defeating Greg Valentine and The Iron Sheik.

The Honky Tonk Man defeated Ricky Steamboat to win the WWF Intercontinental Championship during a &quot;WWF Superstars of Wrestling&quot; taping at the venue on June 2, 1987.

The inaugural Ilio DiPaolo Memorial Show was held at the venue on June 7, 1996, and was headlined by The Giant defeating Sting to retain the WCW World Heavyweight Championship. DiPaolo had died the previous year after being struck by a car. It was the final sporting event at the venue, and set the venue&#x27;s all-time record for professional wrestling attendance with 14,852.

====Boxing====

The auditorium hosted many boxing matches, most notably:

* Ezzard Charles defeating Freddie Beshore to retain the NBA Heavyweight Title on August 15, 1950.
* Gene Hatcher defeating Johnny Bumphus to win the WBA Junior Welterweight Title on June 1, 1984. (&quot;The Ring&quot; magazine Upset of the Year) 
* Livingstone Bramble defeating Ray Mancini to win the WBA Lightweight Title on June 1, 1984.
* Héctor Camacho defeating Roque Montoya to win the vacant NABF Lightweight Title on April 29, 1985.
* Tony Tubbs defeating Greg Page to win the WBA Heavyweight Title on April 29, 1985.

====Mixed martial arts====
UFC 7: The Brawl in Buffalo was held at the Aud on September 8, 1995. It would be the final UFC event in the state before mixed martial arts was banned by New York State in February 1997. UFC would not return to New York State until UFC 205 in 2016.

==Special features==

===Tributes===
The Buffalo Sabres retired the numbers of all three members of The French Connection – Gilbert Perreault (11) in 1990, René Robert (14) in 1995, and Rick Martin (7) in 1995. The number of Tim Horton (2) was retired in 1996. Banners for all four individuals were hung in the rafters of Memorial Auditorium, and later moved to the rafters of Marine Midland Arena after the venue closed.

Championship banners were hung at the venue for the Buffalo Sabres (1975, 1980 and 1981 Division Champions &amp; 1975 and 1980 Prince of Wales Champions), Buffalo Bandits (1992 and 1993 World Champions), and the Buffalo Stampede (1994 World Champions). Banners were also hung to recognize postseason appearances by the Canisius Golden Griffins basketball team, and commemorating the venue hosting the 1993 World University Games . Only banners for the Sabres and Bandits were relocated to Marine Midland Arena after the venue&#x27;s closure.

===Eateries===
At the time of its closing in 1996, the Aud&#x27;s concessions included:

* The Aud Club, an upscale bar and restaurant with a private entrance that was also rented out for banquets and social functions. It was designed by Philip Amigone, the architect of the Chez Ami Supper Club.
* The Pour Man&#x27;s Aud Club, an affordable eatery in the venue&#x27;s lobby.

Delaware North handled all concessions for the venue through its Sportservice subsidiary. The company&#x27;s founder, Louis Jacobs, was the original operating manager of Buffalo Memorial Auditorium.

<text>The African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, or the AME Zion Church (AMEZ) is a historically African-American Christian denomination based in the United States. It was officially formed in 1821 in New York City, but operated for a number of years before then. The African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church adheres to Wesleyan-Arminian theology.

The AME Zion Church is not to be confused with the similarly named African Methodist Episcopal Church, which was officially formed in 1816 by Richard Allen and Daniel Coker in Philadelphia. The denomination was made up of AME churches in the Philadelphia region, including Delaware and New Jersey. Though the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church was founded to grant equal rights to African Americans in Methodist Christianity, its church membership is composed of people of all racial backgrounds.

==History==

The origins of this church can be traced to the John Street Methodist Church of New York City. Following acts of overt discrimination in New York (such as black parishioners being forced to leave worship), many black Christians left to form their own churches. The first church founded by the AME Zion Church was built in 1800 and was named &quot;Zion;&quot; one of the founders was William Hamilton, a prominent orator and abolitionist. These early black churches still belonged to the Methodist Episcopal Church denomination, although the congregations were independent. During the Great Awakening, the Methodists and Baptists had welcomed free blacks and slaves to their congregations and as preachers.

The fledgling Zion church grew, and soon multiple churches developed from the original congregation. These churches were attended by black congregants, but ministered to by white ordained Methodist ministers. In 1820, six of these churches met to ordain James Varick as an elder, and in 1821 he was made the first General Superintendent of the AME Zion Church. A debate raged within the white-dominated Methodist church over accepting black ministers. This debate ended on July 30, 1822, when James Varick was ordained as the first bishop of the AME Zion church, a newly independent denomination. The total membership in 1866 was about 42,000. Two years later, it claimed 164,000 members, as it sent missionaries to the South after the American Civil War to plant new churches with the newly emancipated freedmen. The AME Zion Church had been part of the abolitionist movement and became known as the &#x27;Freedom Church&#x27;, because it was associated with the period after emancipation of the slaves.

Black churches were integral in helping build communities and develop leadership among the freedmen in the South, as well as communities in the North, like Auburn, NY. Later they played an increasingly powerful role in the civil rights movement of the mid-20th century. The AME Zion Church remained smaller than the African Methodist Episcopal (AME) Church, a denomination started in Philadelphia in the early 19th century, because some of its ministers lacked the authority to perform marriages, and many of its ministers avoided political roles. Its finances were weak, and in general its leadership was not as strong as that of the AME Church. However, it was the leader among all Protestant denominations in ordaining women and giving them powerful roles in the church.

An influential leader bishop was James Walker Hood (1831–1918) of North Carolina. He not only created and fostered his network of AME Zion churches in North Carolina, but he also was the grand master for the entire South of the Prince Hall Freemasonry, a secular black fraternal organization that strengthened the political and economic forces inside the black community. Hood Theological Seminary in Salisbury, North Carolina is named in this bishop&#x27;s honor.

The Methodist Wesleyan-Holiness movement came to the AME Zion Church, with Julia A. J. Foote among others preaching the doctrine of entire sanctification throughout pulpits of the connexion. Foote was the first woman ordained as a deacon within the connexion in 1894 and &quot;in 1899, was ordained—the second female elder in her denomination.&quot;

In 1924 Cameron Chesterfield Alleyne became the church&#x27;s first resident bishop in Africa.

==Organization==

A general conference is the supreme administrative body of the church. Between meetings of the conference, the church is administered by the AMEZ Board of Bishops. &quot;The &quot;Book of Discipline&quot; is the instrument for setting forth the laws, plan, polity, and process by which the AME Zion Church governs itself.&quot;

The denomination operates Livingstone College in Salisbury, North Carolina, and two junior colleges. In 1906 the religious studies department of Livingstone College was renamed Hood Theological Seminary, in honor of the influential bishop. Hood remained a department of the College until 2001.

On July 1, 2001, the seminary began operating independently of the college, and in March 2002, the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS), the college&#x27;s accrediting agency acknowledged that the seminary was a separate institution, sponsored by the AME Zion Church independently of the college.

The AME Zion missionaries are active in North and South America, Africa, and the Caribbean region. In 1998, the AME Zion Church commissioned the Reverend Dwight B. and BeLinda P. Cannon as the first family missionaries to South Africa in recent memory. These modern-day missionaries served from 1997 through 2004. Dr. Cannon was Administrative Assistant to the late Bishop Richard K. Thompson, who oversaw the work of South Africa, Zimbabwe, and Swaziland.

The AME Zion Church has performed mission work in the countries of Nigeria, Liberia, Malawi, Mozambique, Angola, Côte d&#x27;Ivoire, and Ghana in Africa; England, India, and Jamaica, St. Croix-Virgin Islands, Trinidad, and Tobago in the Caribbean; and others.

==Ecumenism==
In May 2012, the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church entered into full communion with the United Methodist Church, African Methodist Episcopal Church, African Union Methodist Protestant Church, Christian Methodist Episcopal Church, and Union American Methodist Episcopal Church, in which these churches agreed to &quot;recognize each other&#x27;s churches, share sacraments, and affirm their clergy and ministries.&quot;

The AME Zion Church has been in negotiations for many years to merge with the Christian Methodist Episcopal Church (CME) into a tentatively named Christian Methodist Episcopal Zion Church with more than 2 million members. The plan was originally for unification by 2004. The AME Zion church is very similar in doctrine and practice to the CME Church and the AME Church.

<text>The Moog Cookbook was an American electronic duo consisting of Meco Eno (Roger Manning) and Uli Nomi (Brian Kehew). The project was a parody of and tribute to the novelty Moog records of the late 1960s and early 1970s, which featured cover versions of popular songs using the then-new Moog synthesizer.

The band released two albums in the mid-1990s: &quot;The Moog Cookbook&quot; (1996) featured instrumental cover versions of contemporary alternative rock songs, while its follow-up, &quot;Ye Olde Space Bande&quot; (1997), featured similar covers of classic rock tracks. The pair reunited in 2004 to record &quot;Bob&#x27;s Funk&quot; for the soundtrack of the film &quot;Moog&quot;, a documentary on the life of Robert Moog.

In 2005, the group independently released &quot;Bartell&quot;, an archival compilation album consisting of tracks recorded for compilations and soundtracks, remixes for other artists, holiday songs and other rarities.

==Formation and concept==
The Moog Cookbook was formed by Roger Manning and Brian Kehew shortly after the demise of Manning&#x27;s band Jellyfish. It was conceived as both a parody of and tribute to the novelty Moog records of the late 1960s and early 1970s, which featured cover versions of popular songs using the then-new Moog synthesizer. Manning recalled that &quot;When Brian and I finally met, we &quot;knew&quot; we had to do this, because we knew we could do it right, and we knew we had the resources — before someone else did it, and did it &quot;wrong&quot;.&quot;

The band&#x27;s name is derived from a 1978 cookbook, &quot;Moog&#x27;s Musical Eatery&quot;, written by Shirleigh Moog, the first wife of synthesizer pioneer Robert Moog. On stage and in their promotional materials, they donned space-suit disguises that were similar to outfits worn by another emerging electronic duo, Daft Punk. This was reportedly only a coincidence. Kehew said that &quot;The look of Moog Cookbook can be traced back to those kinds novelty bands like the Spotnicks and French disco band, Space, who had a hit with &quot;Magic Fly&quot; in 1977 and wore astronaut helmets and plastic jumpsuits. I know Daft Punk were into them too.&quot;

==&quot;The Moog Cookbook&quot; and &quot;Ye Olde Space Bande&quot;==

Their first album, &quot;The Moog Cookbook&quot; (1996), featured instrumental cover versions of contemporary alternative/modern rock songs by bands such as Soundgarden, Green Day, and Weezer. Manning said that he and Kehew &quot;wanted to concentrate on bastardizing alternative hits. We couldn&#x27;t wait to sink our teeth into songs we wanted to destroy and make really gross.&quot; Kehew said, &quot;We would not reject &quot;any&quot; bad idea, that’s for sure.&quot; Its liner notes contained the tagline &quot;No MIDI.&quot; This is a direct parody of the &quot;No Synthesizers!&quot; tagline found in the liner notes of Queen albums throughout the 1970s.

The record was critically acclaimed and became an underground hit. Music journalist Brian Chidester commented that their debut record &quot;yielded solid overseas sales amidst the retro-obsessed landscape of &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;, the Swing revival and thrift shop mania. The duo even performed live on MTV in full space regalia and found a small domestic audience attuned to similar electronic psych-pop coming out of Europe by bands like Stereolab, Mouse on Mars and the High Llamas.&quot;

Dave Grohl from the Foo Fighters was a fan and commissioned the duo to record a piece for an opening segment of a Foo Fighters music video. Daft Punk were also &quot;huge fans&quot;, as Kahew remembered, &quot;and came into the music store I was working in at the time. They were friends with Air, the French band, who came to meet us a month later.&quot; Afterward, Manning and Kehew joined Air on their first tour as supporting musicians and remixed their single &quot;Kelly Watch the Stars&quot; (1998).

In 1997, Moog Cookbook followed up with &quot;Ye Olde Space Bande&quot; (1997), which included similar covers of classic rock tracks by groups such as by Kiss, Boston, Led Zeppelin. It featured contributions from Devo&#x27;s Mark Mothersbaugh, who plays on the duo&#x27;s version of Van Halen&#x27;s &quot;Ain&#x27;t Talkin&#x27; &#x27;bout Love&quot;. Other musicians featured on album were the MC5&#x27;s Wayne Kramer, the Go-Gos&#x27; Charlotte Caffey, and the Eels&#x27; Mark Oliver Everett. 

==Later years==
Moog Cookbook disbanded in 1998. According to Manning: &quot;As creatively fulfilling as it was, Moog Cookbook was not financially viable. We weren&#x27;t coming out of rave culture and house music like Daft Punk. Not writing original songs, we didn&#x27;t see a future in continuing to make what were essentially comedy records.&quot; In Kehew&#x27;s view: &quot;Where [we] took it serious, Moog Cookbook was like Spinal Tap in so much as we loved the early synth sound enough that we could parody it. If those efforts played some small role in the larger electronic music explosion, then I&#x27;m proud of that.&quot;

In December 2014, a limited edition Christmas EP entitled &quot;Xmas Recipes (Y Mas)&quot; was released on Bandcamp. The album contained the last five tracks of the duo&#x27;s previous compilation album, as well as six other holiday related tracks and rarities. The EP was only available for five days, with the official Bandcamp page being removed on 25 December.

<doc id="759961" wikidata="Q2370898" url="?curid=759961" title="Chicago Coliseum">
<text>Chicago Coliseum was the name applied to three large indoor arenas, which stood at various times in Chicago, Illinois, from the 1860s to 1982. They served as venues for large national conventions, exhibition halls, sports events, and entertainment. 

The first Coliseum stood at State and Washington streets in Chicago&#x27;s downtown in the late 1860s. The second venue was located at 63rd Street near Stony Island Avenue in the south side&#x27;s Woodlawn community (near the site of the 1893 World&#x27;s Fair). It hosted the 1896 Democratic National Convention (known for the &quot;Cross of Gold&quot; speech), and several early indoor American football games. After hosting a notable convention for the then new and growing bicycle industry, it burned a few months later.

The third Chicago Coliseum was located at Wabash Avenue near 15th Street on the near south side. It hosted five consecutive Republican National Conventions, (1904, 1908, 1912, 1916, 1920) and the Progressive Party National Convention in 1912 and 1916. It also hosted the Lincoln Jubilee in 1915. In the 1920s, it became a popular professional ice hockey venue, and hosted the worlds first roller derby, during the Great Depression. In the 1950s to early 1970s, the Coliseum served as a general admission venue for rock concerts, roller derbys, and professional wrestling matches. Generally closed in 1971, it was sold for redevelopment in 1982; however, portions of the building remained standing until the early 1990s. The Coliseum is commemorated in a public park named in its honor, across from its last site.

==History: the first Coliseum==

The first Coliseum hosted horse shows, boxing matches, and circus acts beginning in 1866. Typical of most 19th century cities, Chicago had a flourishing bachelor subculture, which made events at the Coliseum often rowdy affairs. The arena&#x27;s history is hazy as there are no accurate sources as to when it opened or closed.

==The second Coliseum==
The second Coliseum, in the Woodlawn neighborhood on the city&#x27;s south side, had a difficult history. Initial construction began early in 1895 on a site of the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition, but on August 22, the incomplete structure collapsed, and builders had to start over. Construction of the building entailed the use of of steel, of lumber, and 3 million bricks, and was finally completed in June 1896. The building was impressive in size for its day, twice as large as Madison Square Garden; its interior was supported by 12 massive arches, high with a span of . The facility housed of interior floor space.

Buffalo Bill&#x27;s Wild West Show opened the facility, and in July 1896, it hosted the Democratic Party&#x27;s national convention, which nominated for the presidency William Jennings Bryan; he famously electrified the crowd with his historic &quot;Cross of Gold&quot; speech. In October 1896 the Coliseum hosted the Barnum and Bailey Circus, the largest three-ring circus in the country.

College football teams immediately saw the feasibility of playing indoor games in the Coliseum, and four big games took place:

* University of Michigan vs. University of Chicago, Thanksgiving Day, November 26, 1896; won by Chicago, 7–6.
* Carlisle Indian School vs. University of Wisconsin, December 19, 1896; won by Carlisle, 18–8.
* Carlisle Indian School vs. University of Illinois, November 20, 1897; won by Carlisle, 23–6.
* University of Michigan vs. University of Chicago, Thanksgiving Day, November 25, 1897; won by Chicago, 21–12.

The Carlisle games represented the first time the Carlisle Indian School played in the Midwest. In 1896, 8,000 fans each attended the Chicago-Michigan and Carlisle-Wisconsin games, and in 1897, 12,000 fans attended the Carlisle-Illinois game and 10,000 showed for the second Michigan-Chicago game.

In January 1897, the Coliseum hosted one of the largest trade shows in the country, the annual Bicycle manufacturer&#x27;s trade show. Another grand trade show took place in October, the Chicago Horse Show. The Coliseum by this time was hailed as a financial success. Besides football games, the facility hosted bicycle races, the Military and Athletic Carnival of the AAU, Buffalo Bill&#x27;s Wild West Show, horse shows, agricultural exhibitions, and commercial trade shows.

On December 24, 1897, around 6:00 PM, during the Manufacturers&#x27; Carnival and Winter Fair, after many visitors had left the exhibit for supper, a fire caused by faulty electrical wiring broke out and swept through the building. Despite initial reports of numerous deaths, only one man died, a fireman (not a city fire fighter, but the facility&#x27;s furnace man). The building was completely destroyed, primarily when one of the 12 arches supporting the roof fell over to bring down all the other arches like a row of dominoes. The fire consumed the building within 20 minutes. This massive structure, one of the greatest indoor facilities of the 19th century, had a lifespan of only 19 months.

==The third Coliseum==
Candy manufacturer Charles F. Gunther built the third Coliseum at 1513 South Wabash Avenue in 1899. He purchased Libby Prison, a structure in Richmond, Virginia, constructed as a warehouse which became a Confederate prison during the Civil War. Gunther had it dismantled, shipped to Chicago on 132 railroad cars, and rebuilt in 1889 as the Libby Prison War Museum, which displayed memorabilia from the Civil War. After about a decade the old prison was torn down again, except for a castellated wall that became part of the new Chicago Coliseum.

In January 1902, the Coliseum Garden Company procured a five-year lease from the Coliseum &quot;to provide music and high class vaudeville entertainments&quot; for the months of June, July, August and September.

Until 1908, the Coliseum hosted the notorious First Ward Ball, an annual political fundraiser for the two First Ward aldermen &quot;Bathhouse&quot; John Coughlin and Michael &quot;Hinky Dink&quot; Kenna – Coughlin and Kenna had been known as the &quot;Lords of the Levee&quot;. Mayor Fred Busse was finally successful in halting the Ball in 1909.

From 1904 through 1920, this Coliseum hosted five consecutive Republican National Conventions, and the Progressive Party convention in 1912 and 1916.

During World War II, the army used the structure to house a radio training school which was previously in the nearby Stevens Hotel.

===Ice hockey===
In 1926, the Coliseum built an ice rink at the arena to support professional ice hockey. The Coliseum hosted the Chicago Black Hawks of the National Hockey League (NHL) from 1926–1929 with a seating capacity of 6,000. It was also the home of the Chicago Cardinals (later renamed Chicago Americans) of the American Hockey Association (AHA) for the season of 1926–27 and the Chicago Shamrocks of the AHA from 1931–32. In June 1928, fight promoter Paddy Harmon announced plans to construct Chicago Stadium, with the Black Hawks as the marquee tenants.

As the 1928–29 NHL season approached, the Stadium was not yet ready, and Blackhawks owner Major Frederic McLaughlin had had a falling-out with Harmon. Consequently, the Blackhawks arranged to continue playing at the Coliseum. However, they could only get ice time through January 1929; they played the remainder of their &quot;home&quot; games in Detroit and in Fort Erie, Ontario, across the Niagara River from Buffalo.

The Blackhawks were back at the Coliseum as the 1929–30 season opened, but negotiations with the Stadium resumed in the fall of 1929 after Harmon was deposed as head of the Chicago Stadium Corporation. In December 1929, the team began play at the Stadium.

In 1932, another dispute led the Blackhawks to return temporarily to the Coliseum, for their first three home games of the 1932–33 campaign. On November 21, the Blackhawks defeated the Montreal Canadiens, 2–1, in their final game on Coliseum ice. Canadiens superstar Howie Morenz was the last player to score an NHL goal at the Coliseum, assisted by Aurel Joliat and Johnny Gagnon, at 7:06 of the second period.

===Other events===

Over its history, the Coliseum featured a wide variety of other events that included the 1915 Lincoln Jubilee, which celebrated 50-years since the abolition of slavery in the U.S.; sessions of the 28th International Eucharistic Congress in June 1926; bowling tournaments; professional wrestling bouts that included stars Gorgeous George and Angelo Poffo; circuses meetings of Black Muslims; Black Panthers and the last convention of the radical antiwar organization Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) in June 1969.

With the ice hockey&#x27;s Blackhawks gone and the Great Depression in full swing in the 1930s, use of the arena was limited. In 1935, promoter Leo Seltzer, drawing on the Depression-era popularity of roller skating, conceived the idea of a Roller Derby. In 1935, he staged the world&#x27;s first Roller Derby at the arena. The event drew more than 20,000 people.

===Refurbishing for the Chicago Zephyrs===
The arena was re-furbished for use by the Chicago Packers, an expansion NBA team. Among the improvements was an increase of the seating capacity to 7,000. After playing their first season in the International Amphitheater, the Packers changed their name to the Zephyrs and moved into the Coliseum in 1962. In 1963 they moved to Baltimore and took the name Bullets. (Today they are known as the Washington Wizards). The NBA would return to Chicago with the Bulls expansion team in 1966, but the Bulls opted to use the International Amphitheatre and then Chicago Stadium as their home courts, so the Coliseum remained without a major tenant. The Bulls now play at the United Center.

===The Syndrome===
During the 1960s and early 1970s, many popular bands of the era played The Coliseum, including Cream (twice in 1968), Jethro Tull, The Jimi Hendrix Experience (December 1, 1968), The Doors (November 3, 1968) or B.B. King (May 16, 1970).

During 1970 and 1971, The Coliseum occasionally saw duty as &quot;The Syndrome&quot;, a general-admission venue for rock music concerts. The inaugural concert was staged on Friday, October 16, 1970, featuring Humble Pie, Brethren, Chase, and the headline act, Grand Funk Railroad. Other bands that played The Syndrome included Rod Stewart and the Faces, The Grateful Dead, Steppenwolf, New Riders of the Purple Sage, Traffic, Ten Years After, Fleetwood Mac, Mountain, Alice Cooper, Siegel-Schwall Band, Mott The Hoople, and Savoy Brown.

On March 8, 1971, riots erupted at both The Chicago Coliseum and Chicago Amphitheater amongst fans attempting to watch a live, closed-circuit television broadcast of the Muhammad Ali – Joe Frazier fight being staged at Madison Square Garden in New York. When Coliseum projection equipment broke down, management asked an audience of 7,000 to leave just before the fight began. &quot;..A group of youths, angered by the announcement began tearing up ticket counters near the door and throwing them thru [sic] the front windows. Others, who had paid $10 a head to see the fight, began hurtling chairs and bottles from the balcony onto the main floor. An estimated 80 police were rushed to the Coliseum to restore order.&quot;

As a result of the damage, all scheduled concerts were cancelled with the exception of March 12, 1971, featuring James Taylor and Carole King.

On March 13, 1971, the city shut the building due to fire code violations, and it fell into disrepair. In 1982, it was sold for redevelopment and partially demolished; however, the planned construction never took place and large portions of the outer wall facing Wabash remained until the early 1990s when it was finally cleared. Part of the Libby facade was given to the Chicago History Museum. The site is now occupied by the Soka Gakkai USA Culture Center. Coliseum Park, located across Wabash Avenue on the site of the former Haven School at 14th Place and Wabash Avenue, commemorates the Coliseum.

<text>In computer programming, the IUnknown interface is the fundamental interface in the Component Object Model (COM). The COM specification mandates that COM objects must implement this interface. Furthermore, every other COM interface must be derived from IUnknown. IUnknown exposes two essential features of all COM objects: object lifetime management through reference counting, and access to object functionality through other interfaces.

An IUnknown (or IUnknown-derived) interface consists of a pointer to a virtual method table that contains a list of pointers to the functions that implement the functions declared in the interface, in the order that they are declared in the interface. The in-process invocation call overhead is therefore identical to virtual method calls in C++.

==Methods==
The IUnknown interface exposes three methods: codice_1, codice_2, and codice_3:
* codice_1 allows the caller to retrieve references to the interfaces that the component implements. It is similar to codice_5 in C++ or casts in Java and C#. Specifically, it is used to obtain a pointer to another interface, given a GUID that uniquely identifies that interface (commonly known as an interface ID, or IID). If the COM object does not implement that interface, an E_NOINTERFACE error is returned instead.
* codice_2 is used to increment the reference count when a new client is acquiring the object. It returns the new reference count.
* codice_3 is used to decrement the reference count when clients have finished using the object. It returns the new reference count. The object will delete itself during release when the reference-count reaches zero, which means that the caller must never use an interface after calling Release.

interface IUnknown {
 virtual HRESULT QueryInterface (REFIID riid, void **ppvObject) = 0;
 virtual ULONG AddRef () = 0;
 virtual ULONG Release () = 0;

The IUnknown interface ID is defined as a GUID with the value of {00000000-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}.

A COM component&#x27;s interfaces are required to exhibit the reflexive, symmetric, and transitive properties. The reflexive property refers to the ability for the codice_1 call on a given interface with the interface&#x27;s ID to return the same instance of the interface. The symmetric property requires that when interface B is retrieved from interface A via codice_1, interface A is retrievable from interface B as well. The transitive property requires that if interface B is obtainable from interface A and interface C is obtainable from interface B, then interface C should be retrievable from interface A.

== Miscellaneous ==
*Components designed under the ActiveX visual component standard must, at a minimum, implement the IUnknown interface.
*IUnknown serves as the base for Mac OS X&#x27;s Core Foundation CFPlugIn framework.
*In Mozilla&#x27;s XPCOM component model, this interface is also known as nsISupports.

==See also==
* IOleObject - This is the base interface for Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) objects.
* IDispatch - This interface provides name-based dynamic method dispatch for OLE Automation COM objects
* IObjectWithSite - This COM interface allows a parent/child pair of objects to connect to each other to implement a Browser Helper Object (BHO)
* IInspectable - The COM-derived Windows Runtime (WinRT) uses this IUnknown-derived interface as its base interface

<text>The Moog Cookbook is the debut record by the American electronic music duo the Moog Cookbook, released in 1996. It consists of ten cover versions of alternative rock tracks performed using Moog synthesizers and other analog synthesizers. The album was critically acclaimed and became an underground hit. In 1997, it was followed by the similar &quot;Ye Olde Space Bande&quot;.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Stereo Review&quot; praised &quot;the delicious nastiness of &quot;The Moog Cookbook&quot;, which takes ten sacred-cow songs down a few pegs... Soundgarden&#x27;s &#x27;Black Hole Sun&#x27;, for instance, becomes an unholy cross of generic bossa nova and the theme to the old &quot;Dating Game&quot; TV show, while the deep brooding of Tom Petty&#x27;s &#x27;Free Fallin&#x27;″ gets trashed via robot vocals and some Rick Wakemanesque keyboard flourishes.&quot;

<text>The Hamilton Tiger-Cats are a professional Canadian football team based in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. They are currently members of the East Division of the Canadian Football League (CFL). The Tiger-Cats play their home games at Tim Hortons Field. 

The club traces its origins back to 1869 to the founding of Hamilton Football Club which adopted the nickname “tigers” a few years after its founding (although it had been informally called the Tigers since its first game). In 1950, the Tigers absorbed the cross-town upstart Hamilton Wildcats largely to eliminate the gate competition from the underfunded Wildcats. The Tigers adopted the name &quot;Tiger-Cats&quot;.

Since 1950, the team has won the Grey Cup championship eight times, most recently in 1999. The Hamilton Tiger-Cats Football Club recognizes all Grey Cups won by Hamilton-based teams as part of their history, bringing their win total to 15 (the Hamilton Tigers with five, the Hamilton Flying Wildcats and Hamilton Alerts with one each). However, the CFL does not recognize these wins under one franchise, rather as the individual franchises that won them. If one includes their historical lineage, Hamilton football clubs won league championships in every decade of the 20th century.

In their first 40 years after absorbing the Wildcats, the Tiger-Cats qualified for the playoffs in all but three of those years and won seven Grey Cup championships. They are one of six teams in the modern era to win the Grey Cup at home and were the first to accomplish this when they did it in 1972. However, since 1990, they have missed the playoffs on eleven occasions and have won just one Grey Cup in 1999. In addition to having the longest Grey Cup drought of all the CFL teams, they are the only team to have not won the Grey Cup in the 21st century. Their lowest point came in 2003, when they lost a CFL record 17 games in one season, with just one win. The franchise has started to return to prominence after qualifying for the post-season in eight of the 10 years of the 2010s, including appearances in the 101st, 102nd, 107th and 108th Grey Cups, where they lost each time.

== Ownership ==

Businessman Bob Young purchased the club on October 7, 2003. He was born in Hamilton, Ontario, and graduated from Victoria College at the University of Toronto. His fortune was earned in the software industry and he is currently the owner and CEO of Lulu, a self-publishing website.

, the Hamilton Tiger-Cats Executive Committee consists of five people: Bob Young, Caretaker; Scott Mitchell, CEO; Doug Rye, Executive Vice President; President and COO Matt Afinec; and Vice Chairman Glenn Gibson.
On January 2, 2022, the club reorganized its ownership under the newly announced Hamilton Sports Group, an entity that also owns Forge FC and the master licence for Tim Hortons Field. Bob Young continues to serve as chairman and the largest shareholder while also welcoming new investment from Hamilton-based steel company Stelco (represented by its chairman and CEO Alan Kestenbaum), club CEO Scott Mitchell, and local sports executive Jim Lawson.

In late 2024, American steelmaker Cleveland-Cliffs acquired Stelco, including their 40% share of Hamilton Sports Group. Young continues to own a fraction over 40%, with Mitchell owning just under 20%, and Lawson owning a small percentage.

== History ==
The history of Hamilton Tiger-Cats Football Club can be traced back to November 3, 1869 in a room above George Lee&#x27;s Fruit Store, when the Hamilton Football Club was formed. The Hamilton football club played their first game on December 18, 1869 against the 13th Battalion (now Royal Hamilton Light Infantry). In 1872, the Hamilton Football club began play at the Hamilton AAA Grounds and they became officially known as the Tigers in 1873. Due to clubs colours, they were informally referred to as “the tigers” since their first game years before.

The Hamilton Tigers began play in the Ontario Rugby Football Union (ORFU) in 1883 and won their first Canadian Dominion Football Championship in 1906 when the Tigers beat McGill University 29–3. The Tigers continued in the ORFU until 1907, when the Interprovincial Rugby Football Union (IRFU) was formed. The IRFU later became known as the Big Four and eventually, the BIg Four became the Eastern conference of the modern CFL in the 1950s. The Tigers faced stiff local competition with the ORFU&#x27;s Hamilton Alerts who, in 1912, won the City of Hamilton its first Grey Cup, the trophy that was now awarded to the Canadian Dominion Football Champions, by beating the Toronto Argonauts 11–4.
In the following season (1913), the Tigers won their first of five Grey Cups when they beat the Toronto Parkdale Canoe Club by the lopsided margin of 44–2. The Alerts were refused entry into the ORFU in 1913 with many of its players opting to join the Tigers, while the Alerts gradually faded from existence. The Alerts gave way to a team under the name Hamilton Rowing Club from 1913 to 1915, who also played in the ORFU. In 1914, the Alerts were absorbed by the Hamilton Tigers and the football club continued playing under the name &quot;Tigers&quot;. In 1915, in the final pre-war season, the Hamilton Tigers won their second Grey Cup.

After over a decade-long drought, the Hamilton Tigers won the Grey Cup championship game in 1928, 1929 and 1932. The 1941 season saw the Tigers suspend play for the remainder of World War II. The Hamilton Tigers folded, largely because a number of players had gone into the armed services. It is believed by some that the failure of the Tigers is what caused the IRFU to be dissolved, and the Eastern Rugby Football Union (ERFU) to be formed. Because of the absence of the Tigers, a new club called the Hamilton Wildcats were formed to play in the ORFU in 1941. The Wildcats were given permission to use players from the Hamilton Tigers, but not the traditional black and yellow colors of the Tigers. In 1943, the Hamilton Flying Wildcats, stocked with Royal Canadian Air Force personnel, won the 31st Grey Cup.

Things returned to normal in 1945 when the IRFU and the Hamilton Tigers resumed play while the Wildcats (no longer known as the Flying Wildcats) continued on in the ORFU. In 1948 the Hamilton Wildcats joined the IRFU to replace the Tigers who joined the Ontario Rugby Football Union. The Tigers and Wildcats switch of unions only lasted two years (1948–49) as both clubs struggled. At this time, the Tigers and Wildcats competed for fans, talent and bragging rights so vehemently that neither team could operate on a sound financial level. Consequently, the Tigers absorbed the Wildcats in 1950 to form the Hamilton Tiger-Cats that would compete in the IRFU. Under the guidance of prominent and distinguished local leaders such as Ralph &quot;Super-Duper&quot; Cooper and F.M. Gibson, it was decided that the two teams should merge as one that would represent Hamilton. Cooper was named team president and Carl Voyles served as head coach and general manager. A contest was held among the fans to determine the colors for the newly formed football club; the result was a combination of the two clubs&#x27; colors: yellow, black, red, and white. However, the black and gold of the Tigers were largely adopted (the red tongue on the logo is only remaining nod to Wildcats red) and remain to this day. In 1950, the newly christened Hamilton Tiger-Cats began playing in Civic Stadium (renamed Ivor Wynne Stadium in 1971) until 2012 after which it was demolished and replaced with a new stadium on the same site, Tim Hortons Field, in 2014.

=== A Steel Town dynasty (1950–1972) ===
The Ti-Cats had great success throughout the 1950s and 1960s, appearing in ten Grey Cups. They finished first in the East thirteen times from 1950 to 1972. During that same time span, they appeared in eleven Grey Cup finals winning the championship six times. Players, such as Angelo Mosca, Bernie Faloney, Joe Zuger and Garney Henley became football icons in the Steel City. Beginning in 1957 under coach Jim Trimble (who left the team after the 1962 season), the Tiger-Cats played in every national final through 1967, except for those of 1960 and 1966, winning 4 Cups (1957, 1963, 1965 and 1967).

The Cats&#x27; 1972 Grey Cup win, 13–10 over the Saskatchewan Roughriders, was led by two sensational rookies, Chuck Ealey who had an outstanding college career at the University of Toledo and Ian Sunter, an 18-year-old kicker who booted the deciding field goal that gave Hamilton the cup on their home turf.

During this era, the Tiger-Cats also became (and remain to this day) the only Canadian team to have ever defeated a current National Football League team; on August 8, 1961, they defeated the Buffalo Bills by a score of 38–21 (at the time, Buffalo was still a part of the American Football League).

=== Late 20th century ===

In 1978, Toronto Maple Leafs owner Harold Ballard assumed ownership of the Tiger-Cats. Ballard claimed to be losing a million dollars a year. The Tiger-Cats contended on and off during the rest of the 1970s and 1980s (reaching the playoffs in every year of the latter decade), reaching the Grey Cup game again in 1980 and winning the East Division by a mile in 1981 with an 11–4–1 record under head coach Frank Kush, but were stunned by the Ottawa Rough Riders, who finished a distant second at 5–11, in the East final. The Tabbies&#x27; defence was very stout, talented and hungry that decade, led by standouts Grover Covington, Ben Zambiasi, Howard Fields and Mitchell Price. They were complemented very well on offence with quarterbacks Tom Clements and Mike Kerrigan throwing to Rocky DiPietro and Tony Champion leading to three straight trips to the Grey Cup in 1984, 1985 and 1986, the latter resulting in winning the title over the Edmonton Eskimos by a score of 39–15. In 1986, Ballard publicly called the Tiger-Cats a bunch of overpaid losers. After the Tiger-Cats beat the Toronto Argonauts in the 1986 Eastern Final, Ballard said &quot;You guys may still be overpaid, but after today, no one can call you losers.&quot; A few days later, the Tiger-Cats won the 1986 Grey Cup by beating the Edmonton Eskimos 39–15; Ballard said it was worth every penny.

Hamilton businessman David Braley bought the team on February 24, 1989, and he eventually sold the team to a community-based group in 1992 due to continued poor attendance figures (Braley later bought the B.C. Lions in 1997 and the Toronto Argonauts in 2010). Hamilton returned to the Grey Cup in 1989 (making their fifth appearance in the Grey Cup game in the 1980s), but were on the losing end of a 43–40 thriller to Saskatchewan. The 1990s began on a sour note for the team, missing the playoffs for the first time in back-to-back years under the Tiger-Cats banner. By 1994, the team was in grave jeopardy; with the Buffalo Bills then in the midst of their run of four consecutive Super Bowl appearances and the Toronto Argonauts contending for the Grey Cup, almost all of the football attention in the Hamilton area had been sucked toward those two teams and away from the Tiger-Cats. Fewer than 6,000 season tickets were sold, prompting a threat from the CFL Commissioner Larry Smith to revoke the franchise if they did not both double the ticket sales for 1995 and raise million in corporate sponsorship. Both thresholds were met and exceeded.

The 1990s were marked by financial instability, and constant struggles on the field. Quarterback was a weak spot for the Ti-Cats, as the first half of the decade had names like Don McPherson, Damon Allen, Timm Rosenbach, Matt Dunigan, Lee Saltz and Todd Dillon taking their turns at the pivot. Despite the excellent play of Eastern All-Star Earl Winfield rewriting the team&#x27;s record books for pass catching, Hamilton struggled to attract crowds to Ivor Wynne Stadium. It was not until 1998 with the arrival of head coach Ron Lancaster and the pitch-and-catch duo of Danny McManus and Darren Flutie plus the pass rush abilities of Joe Montford that led Hamilton back to the CFL&#x27;s elite, reaching the Grey Cup finals in 1998 and winning the cup the following year. However, the Ti-Cats then suffered a slow decline. In 2000, Hamilton finished 9–9, losing 4 of their last 5 games, as well as the East semifinal 24–22 to Winnipeg.

=== Early 21st century ===

In 2001, Hamilton finished 11–7, and lost to Winnipeg in the playoffs for a second straight season, 28–13. In 2002, Hamilton finished 7–11 and missed the playoffs. The team reached their lowest ebb in 2003, having not only a franchise-worst season, but the worst record in CFL history, finishing 1–17 (and losing the most games in the CFL&#x27;s 18-game schedule), with only a 27–24 overtime victory in week 14 keeping the declawed Tiger-Cats from having an imperfect season.
Native Hamiltonian Bob Young has owned the Tiger-Cats since 2004, and although the team had a resurgence in home attendance, corporate sponsorship plus a brand new &quot;Tiger Vision&quot; scoreboard at Ivor Wynne stadium, it struggled with its on-field performance. Last place finishes both in 2005 (5–13) and 2006 (4–14), resulted in an overhaul of the coaching staff for 2007. The moves still did not immediately help, as the team continued to lag in last place in 2007 and 2008 despite numerous apparent upgrades. In 2009, their fortunes turned around when they finished in second place in the East, qualifying for the playoffs for the first time in several years. However, they failed to win the Grey Cup, marking the 2000s as the first decade since the 1890s that Hamilton failed to win a national championship.
On August 31, 2011, the Tiger-Cats announced plans to close Ivor Wynne Stadium at the end of the 2012 season and begin play in the long planned Pan American Stadium in 2014. Throughout the 2013 season, they played their home games at Guelph University&#x27;s stadium because the new stadium was still under construction. On November 24, 2013, the Hamilton Tiger-Cats lost to the Saskatchewan Roughriders 45–23 in the 101st Grey Cup at Mosaic Stadium at Taylor Field. The game had star appeal as actor Tom Hanks attended with comedian Martin Short, a Hamilton native. Early in the third quarter, Hanks was shown replacing a Ti-cats toque with a Riders hat, drawing a loud roar from the crowd. After construction of the new stadium fell behind schedule in 2014, the team moved the first few games of its 2014 season to Ron Joyce Stadium.

Tim Hortons Field opened in time for the 2014 Labour Day Classic, which coincided with the Tiger-Cats going on a long run that propelled the team from 1–6 prior to that game to 9–9 (in a year when the East was particularly weak, this was enough to win the division) and two further playoff wins, propelling the team to its second straight Grey Cup appearance, which was also its second straight Grey Cup loss, as the Calgary Stampeders held off a late comeback effort from the Tiger-Cats to win 20–16. The team went undefeated at Tim Hortons Field in its inaugural season at the stadium.

== Stadium ==
The Tiger-Cats have played home games at Tim Hortons Field since 2014. The stadium is located in downtown Hamilton at the former site of Ivor Wynne Stadium. The team played at Civic Stadium from 1950 until 1970. Renovations were done, and in 1971 the stadium was renamed in honour of Ivor Wynne. The team played there until 2012. During construction of Tim Hortons Field in 2013, the Tiger-Cats played at Alumni Stadium in Guelph, Ontario.

== Logo ==

The artwork for the original &quot;leaping tiger&quot; was designed by Jake Gaudaur, a former Tiger-Cat player, President, and CFL Commissioner. The Princeton University Tigers athletic logo for many years was a mirror image of the Hamilton logo, except in orange. Both logos have since been revised or replaced. The colours of the logo are the clubs traditional colours for well over 100 years: black, yellow, and white. The red tongue is the last remaining nod to the upstart red-clad Hamilton Wildcats.

== Rivals ==
Since 1873, the arch-rivals of the Tiger-Cats have been the Toronto Argonauts. The first meeting took place on October 18, 1873 at the University of Toronto where the Argonauts defeated the Hamilton Football Club by a Goal and a Try to Nil. The biggest event of the rivalry is the annual Labour Day Classic, first held in 1948, with Hamilton holding a 31-15 lead. Hamilton has hosted the match almost continuously since 1996, with a rematch held the following week in Toronto. There have been 17 playoff match-ups between the two teams, with Toronto holding a 10-7 edge. Hamilton and Toronto are merely 51 km apart along the Queen Elizabeth Way (QEW) highway and, for relatively brief periods of time, were the only CFL teams in Ontario as there was no Ottawa team from 1997-2002, and again from 2006-2013. 

Other Tiger-Cats rivals include the Montreal Alouettes, the Ottawa Redblacks, and recently the Winnipeg Blue Bombers after a pair of Grey Cup matchups.

== Broadcasters ==
Corus Radio Hamilton was the official radio broadcast rights holder for the Tiger-Cats and had been the official voice for CFL football in the Greater Hamilton Area for over 40 years. AM900 CHML, together with sister station CJXY-FM, offered coverage of all Tiger-Cats games, including pre-season games. Hamilton Tiger-Cats games broadcast on CHML were anchored by the announcers team of Rick Zamperin, John Salavantis, and Matt Holmes. Zamperin, CHML&#x27;s sports director, became the play-by-play announcer in 2007 after six seasons as sideline reporter. Colour commentator John Salavantis was a former football coach with the Tiger-Cats, Ottawa Rough Riders, Montreal Machine, and the Ottawa University Braves. CHML&#x27;s Matt Holmes was the pre-game show host and sideline reporter. The post-game show, &quot;The Fifth Quarter&quot;, was hosted by Ted Michaels. (CHML continued to carry &quot;The Fifth Quarter&quot; as an unofficial postgame show, with Rick Zamperin as host, until the station&#x27;s closure.)

In May 2015, the Tiger-Cats left CHML for CKOC, where the team operates a joint venture with TSN Radio. Through the 2015 season, former McMaster Marauders quarterback Marshall Ferguson offered sideline analysis of all Tiger-Cats games, along with a post-game show on TSN 1150 Hamilton. Ferguson was promoted to lead play-by-play announcer in 2016. Select Tiger-Cats games are simulcast on CKTB in St. Catharines (also owned by Bell Media) to extend the Tiger-Cats radio network listenership towards the Niagara region (CHML&#x27;s coverage pattern already covered Niagara, whereas CKOC&#x27;s is pointed more toward Toronto and does not cover Niagara as well). Bell Media announced it was dropping TSN Radio from CKOC on February 9, 2021, and the Tiger-Cats responded that it was ending the partnership with Bell shortly thereafter and had begun working on alternate ways to distribute the broadcasts. It announced the launch of the &quot;Ticats Audio Network&quot; on August 3, 2021, with game broadcasts returning to CHML and other audio content moving to a podcast format. Radio broadcasts relocated to CJXY-FM midway through the 2024 season when CHML suddenly closed on August 14, 2024. Affiliates also include CJOY/1460, &amp; CKGL/570.

<text>Thongchai McIntyre (, ; born Albert Thongchai McIntyre; 8 December 1958) is a Thai singer, actor and 2023 National Artist Performing Arts. He is also sometimes known as Bird Thongchai, Phi Bird (&quot;Older brother Bird&quot;) or simply Bird (). He finished high diploma management major from Thonburi Commercial College.

Considered to be Thailand&#x27;s most famous superstar, he is one of the most successful singers in Thailand&#x27;s history, having sold more than 25 million albums. He is best known for his string (Thai pop) and luk thung music, having debuted in 1986 and quickly became famous with his singing style and stage persona. He has also acted in numerous films, on television, musicals, and in commercials. He is of Mon, Scottish and Thai descent. 

==Early life==

McIntyre was born in Bangkok&#x27;s Wat Nimmanoradi neighbourhood to parents Udom and James McIntyre. He was the youngest of nine siblings, and his life in the slums did not give him much of a head start, thus his childhood was filled with struggle to supplement the income of his family. As a child, he sometimes taught English to other children in the slum in exchange for 5 to 10 baht. Raised in a music-loving family, Bird McIntyre loved to sing and dance, and showcased his talents in school. His father died when Bird was still a child. He began working as a bank officer.

==Career==
While still working as a bank officer, he met the famous Thai TV producer Kai Varayuth, who recognised Bird&#x27;s talent. Bird débuted in his first TV series with the help of Kai. His most memorable role was that of Captain Kobori in the 1990 television series &quot;Khu Kam&quot;, a tragic love story about a Japanese soldier (Bird) and a local Thai girl during World War II. He reprised this role in the 1996 film adaptation, &quot;Sunset at Chaophraya&quot;.

He reached the height of his musical career in the early nineties. Among his best-known songs are &quot;Duay Rak Lae Pook Pan&quot;, &quot;Koo Gud&quot;, &quot;Sabai Sabai&quot; and &quot;Kob Jai Jing Jing&quot;. His popular singles released recently include luk thung singles &quot;Mah Tummai&quot; (with Jintara Poonlarp), &quot;Fan Ja&quot; (with Jintara and Jarin B. (Joey Boy), Nat Myria Benedetti, and Katreeya English), &quot;Lao Su Kan Fang&quot;, and &quot;Yak Tham Kor Tob&quot; and &quot;Mai Kang Ying Pae&quot; from his album &quot;Volume One&quot;. In the mid-nineties, he became the first Thai artist to receive an International MTV Award for his performance in &quot;Sunset at Chaophraya&quot;.

He was featured on CNN and in &quot;Variety&quot; magazine. An award-winning documentary of his life entitled &quot;Crossing Borders&quot;, directed by Phanjanit Garnploog, can be seen at St. John&#x27;s University in New York. In 2010, Bird made his first international tour in Los Angeles and the 50th Anniversary of Lincoln Center in New York.

In late 2007, he released another album entitled &quot;Simply Bird&quot;, which features songs such as Chuay Rap Tee and Mee Tae Kid Tueng.

<text>Night Over Water is a thriller novel written by author Ken Follett in 1991.

&quot;Night Over Water&quot; is a fictionalized account of the final flight of the Pan American Clipper passenger airplane during the first few days of World War II, early September, 1939. Follett is careful to state that, though the flight and all of the characters are fictional the plane, a Boeing 314, was real and was nicknamed the &quot;Pan Am Clipper.&quot; It was a flying boat, an aircraft that landed in the sea, not on an airstrip, powered by 4 propeller engines. It was capable of crossing the Atlantic Ocean in little more than 24 hours with intermediate stops in Shannon Estuary at Foynes, Ireland, Bay of Exploits at Botwood, Newfoundland and Shediac Bay, Canada, at each of which stops Follett adds a scene or two of intrigue. This route made the Pan Am Clipper the fastest mode of transatlantic travel at the time — and very appealing to those who wanted to escape from Britain before the start of the war.

The tale begins with several separated threads, telling the individual stories of the people who later all end up in this last flight to New York. Though Follett bundles all these together, the events the characters share while travelling with the clipper are still told through the perspectives introduced before. Each of these main characters is heading for his own interests in the beginning but soon they melt together.

The theme is the importance of recognizing the threat of totalitarianism and also a feminist message of women standing up for themselves.

== List of Characters ==
* Tom Luther - enigmatic passenger with a mystery mission to kidnap a fleeing passenger
* Eddie Deakin - flight engineer being blackmailed by the kidnapping of his wife into helping Tom Luther

<text>Ivar Johan Haglund (March 21, 1905 – January 30, 1985) was a Seattle folk singer, restaurateur and the founder of Ivar&#x27;s.

==Background==
Ivar Johan Haglund was born in Seattle, Washington, the son of pioneers Johan Ivar Haglund, a Swedish immigrant and Daisy Hanson Haglund, daughter of Norwegian immigrants. His maternal grandparents had purchased Alki Point in 1869 from Seattle pioneer David Swinson Maynard. The house on the property, which is now located at 3045 64th Avenue SW in West Seattle, is considered to be the oldest house in Seattle. His mother died of starvation when he was only three on February 26, 1908, while under treatment by Linda Hazzard, a so-called fasting specialist. However, following autopsy, it was determined that his mother had been suffering from terminal stomach cancer, possibly for years, and that she would have died even without Hazzard&#x27;s &quot;treatment&quot;. The official cause of death was reported as stomach cancer. Ivar himself was treated by Hazzard several times after his mother&#x27;s death, likely due to his father&#x27;s belief that Hazzard&#x27;s treatment had eased his late mother&#x27;s suffering and extended her life.

Haglund “graduated from the University of Washington in 1928 with a degree as a stockbroker.”

==Career==

In 1938, he opened Seattle&#x27;s first aquarium along with a fish and chips counter on Pier 54. Friends who visited him included novelist Thomas Wolfe (1900–1938), one of whose last photographs was taken in the company of Haglund in July 1938. In 1946, Haglund opened a full restaurant on Pier 54, Ivar&#x27;s Acres of Clams, which with the fish and chip counter survives to this day (although they have been thoroughly remodeled). He coined its motto, &quot;Keep Clam.&quot; He expanded the fine dining and fish and chips restaurants into a regional chain. In 1965 he bought Pier 54. Ivar&#x27;s Salmon House opened in 1971. The 1980s saw the addition of multiple Ivar&#x27;s Fish Bars. Today, there are 24 Ivar&#x27;s fast casual Seafood Bars, three Fish Bars, and three full-service restaurants: Ivar&#x27;s Acres of Clams, Ivar&#x27;s Salmon House and Ivar&#x27;s Mukilteo Landing.

After his neighbor on Pier 56 put up a sign reading &quot;Don&#x27;t Feed Sea Gulls, Health Regulation&quot; in 1971, Haglund responded with his own sign encouraging customers to feed the seagulls. In 1976, Haglund bought the Smith Tower, a Seattle landmark that was once the tallest building in North America west of the Mississippi River. In 1983, he was elected port commissioner after filing as a prank. He died of a heart attack just over a year later. With no direct heirs, he left his estate principally to the University of Washington School of Business in support of the University Restaurant Program.

In 2009, the Ivar&#x27;s restaurant company enlisted local historians to conspire in a hoax, in which historic billboards were placed underwater, ostensibly by Haglund before his death, and then &quot;rediscovered.&quot;

<text>is a Japanese amateur astronomer, discoverer of minor planets, and, by profession, a junior high school science teacher. As a planetarian, a member of the professional staff of a planetarium, he has done much for the spread of astronomy in Japan through speaking on planetaria and the results of astronomical observation.

In 2001, while working as support staff at JK1ZAM, the club station of Iruma Children’s Center (an educational institution for children in Iruma City), he helped achieve the first ARISS school contact in Japan. Also, in 2003, as a coordinating teacher, he helped accomplish the first solo contact between a junior high school in Japan and the ISS, with the support of JK1ZAM. He regularly spoke on the astronomical talk program &quot;Sunset Café&quot; at the local radio station &quot;FM CHAPPY 77.7&quot; from December 2006 to November 2008. He held the position of vice-director on the board of the Saitama Planetarium Liaison Council (2007–2008). He supports ARISS (Amateur Radio on the International Space Station), which is a program that offers students an opportunity to experience the excitement of amateur radio by talking directly with crew members of the ISS (International Space Station).

The Eos main-belt asteroid 6025 Naotosato, which Takeshi Urata discovered in 1992, was named after him.

== Discoveries of minor planets ==
Since 1995, Satō has discovered a large number of minor planets from his own Chichibu Astronomical Observatory at Chichibu, including asteroids such as 7038 Tokorozawa, 7851 Azumino, 8581 Johnen, 8924 Iruma, 9418 Mayumi and 118230 Sado. He is ranked among the top 50 asteroid discoverers in the world (&quot;The Astronomy Yearbook – 2008&quot;). The Minor Planet Center credits him with the discovery of 142 minor planets during 1995–1998, of which 18 were co-discoveries with astronomer Takeshi Urata &quot;(also see table)&quot;. Naoto Satō is also known for the prediscovery of C/1989 Y2, a parabolic comet credited to McKenzie–Russell.

<doc id="759993" wikidata="Q3544085" url="?curid=759993" title="USS Lionfish">
<text>USS &quot;Lionfish&quot; (SS-298), a , was the only ship of the United States Navy named for the lionfish, a scorpaenid fish native to the Pacific and an invasive species found around the Caribbean. She was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1986, and is now on display at Battleship Cove in Fall River, Massachusetts.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Lionfish&quot; was laid down on 15 December 1942; launched on 7 November 1943, sponsored by Mrs. May Philipps Train, wife of Rear Admiral Harold C. Train; and commissioned on 1 November 1944. Her first commanding officer was Lieutenant Commander Edward D. Spruance, son of World War II admiral Raymond Spruance.

==World War II==
After completing her shakedown cruise off New England, she began her first war patrol in Japanese waters on 1 April 1945. Ten days later, she avoided two torpedoes fired by a Japanese submarine. On 1 May, &quot;Lionfish&quot; destroyed a Japanese schooner with her deck guns. After a rendezvous with the submarine , she transported United States Army Air Forces B-29 Superfortress survivors to Saipan in the Mariana Islands and then made her way to Midway Atoll in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands for replenishment.

On 2 June 1945 she started her second war patrol, and on 10 July 1945 fired torpedoes at a surfaced Japanese submarine , after which &quot;Lionfish&quot;″s crew heard explosions and observed smoke through their periscope, although &quot;I-162&quot; was undamaged. She subsequently fired on two more Japanese submarines. &quot;Lionfish&quot; ended her second and last war patrol performing lifeguard duty (the rescue of downed fliers) off the coast of Japan. When World War II ended on 15 August 1945, she headed for San Francisco, California, and was decommissioned at Mare Island Navy Yard in Vallejo, California, on 16 January 1946.

==Post World War II==
&quot;Lionfish&quot; was recommissioned on 31 January 1951, and headed for the United States East Coast for training cruises. After participating in NATO exercises and a Mediterranean cruise, she returned to the East Coast and was decommissioned at the Boston Navy Yard on 15 December 1953.

In 1960, the submarine was placed in service, but not recommissioned, as a reserve training submarine at Providence, Rhode Island.

==Museum ship==
In 1971, she was stricken from the Navy Register. In 1973, she began permanent display as a memorial at Battleship Cove in Fall River, Massachusetts, where she is one of the museum&#x27;s most popular exhibits.

As &quot;Lionfish&quot; was never converted to a GUPPY configuration, she is one of the very few preserved American World War II-era submarines in her &quot;as built&quot; configuration. Because of this state of preservation, she was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1986. 

After nearly a decade of closure, Lionfish reopened to the public on February 14th, 2025.

==In popular culture==
The submarine is featured on the DVD case of the 2007 Ubisoft game &quot;Silent Hunter 4: Wolves of the Pacific&quot;.

The submarine was also featured in the 2015 movie drama &quot;Subconscious&quot;.

<doc id="760001" wikidata="Q2703852" url="?curid=760001" title="Chicago Stadium">
<text>The Chicago Stadium was an indoor arena in Chicago from 1929 to 1995. When it was built, it was the largest indoor arena in the world with a maximum seating capacity of 26,000. It was the home of the National Hockey League&#x27;s Chicago Blackhawks and the National Basketball Association&#x27;s Chicago Bulls. It was used for numerous other sporting events, opening with a championship boxing match in March 1929. In sports, it gained the nickname, the &quot;Madhouse on Madison&quot;, and a feature during events was the playing of the largest Barton pipe organ ever built. It also hosted five United States presidential nominating conventions, including for Franklin D. Roosevelt, and for his opponents in 1932 and 1944.

The Stadium was built by Paddy Harmon, a promoter, who sank his entire fortune into the project, only to lose control to the Stadium shareholders. After exiting receivership in 1935, the Stadium was owned by the Norris and Wirtz families until its closure in 1994 and demolition in 1995. It was replaced by the United Center built across the street, also owned substantially by the Wirtz family, and its former location now supports the center.

==History==
The Stadium hosted the Chicago Blackhawks of the NHL from 1929 to 1994 and the Chicago Bulls of the NBA from 1967 to 1994. The arena was the site of the first NFL playoff game in 1932; the 1932, 1940, and 1944 Democratic National Conventions; and the 1932 and 1944 Republican National Conventions, as well as numerous concerts, rodeo competitions, boxing matches, political rallies, and plays.
The Stadium was built by Harmon, first proposed in 1926, not long after the legalization of professional boxing in Illinois. Encouraged by the success of the New York Rangers and New York Americans expansion NHL teams, and their Madison Square Garden, Harmon also wanted to bring an NHL team to Chicago, but he lost out to Col. Frederic McLaughlin. This team would soon be known as the Chicago Black Hawks (later &#x27;Blackhawks&#x27;). With or without the Black Hawks, Harmon then spent $2.5 million and borrowed more funds from friends, including $600,000 from James E. Norris, in order to build the stadium. Eric Hall was the architect and he designed a stadium where all had a view of the action. His design philosophy was &quot;The man who pays the lowest admission price has as much right to see the show as those who sit at the ringside&quot;. The building used Art Deco flourishes, including flattened columns, long vertical windows, relief sculptures of various athletics and medallions of wrestlers adorned the walls above entrances.

Breaking ground in July 1928, it opened eight months later, on March 28, 1929. Various reports give the cost at US$5 million, US$7 million and . Chicago Stadium was the largest indoor arena in the world at the time, with permanent seating for 15,000 people, and a capacity for 26,000 with floor seats and standing room. It was situated in Harmon&#x27;s old &quot;Valley&quot; neighbourhood where he grew up. Its first event was a boxing match between Tommy Loughran and Mickey Walker for a purse of .

Detroit&#x27;s Olympia stadium, built two years earlier, was a model for the Chicago Stadium. The Stadium was also the first arena with an air conditioning system. However, the system was fairly rudimentary by modern standards, and was memorably given to filling the arena with fog during late-season basketball and hockey games. The Stadium also had no elevators. To get kegs of beer to upper-floor concessions, concession workers formed a line to pass the kegs upstairs. To return the kegs downstairs, the workers simply rolled them down the stairs, damaging the stairs in the process.

Harmon became the Stadium&#x27;s first president. Building it incurred enemies. Harmon himself helped put out a fire on the Stadium&#x27;s roof set by disgruntled workmen. Harmon reached an impasse in getting the Black Hawks as a tenant, although both sides wanted the team to move to the Stadium from the Chicago Coliseum, which was much smaller. Fed up with the delay, the Stadium board of directors forced Harmon to resign as president, although he remained an executive with the Stadium. Sheldon Clark became the new president, and he retained Nate Clark as the Stadium&#x27;s boxing matchmaker. The board acceded to the Black Hawks&#x27; terms and the team moved in weeks later. After Harmon was ousted, dynamite was placed at the home of James Norris when Sidney Strotz, treasurer of the Stadium was attending for dinner. The dynamite&#x27;s fuse went out, preventing its explosion.

Harmon sank his entire fortune into the Stadium, and when he died less than a year later due to a car crash, he had only his shares in the Stadium and $2.50 in cash on hand to leave to his widow and daughter. His funeral was held in the Stadium, paid for by friends, and the Stadium held a benefit boxing show in August 1930 to benefit his family.

Struggling to pay the interest on the Stadium&#x27;s debt, the Stadium planned to turn the Stadium into a dog track for the summer of 1930 with the backing of Thomas Duggan, but dog racing was ruled illegal in Chicago. Al Capone had operated dog racing tracks in Cook County for several years before the authorities stopped his tracks from operating.

On January 20, 1933, the Stadium went into receivership. Sidney Strotz of the Stadium Corporation and Fred E. Hummel were named receivers. Strotz announced to the media that the Stadium would operate much like it had before. In 1935, the Stadium was sold to Norris and Arthur Wirtz, a Chicago real estate owner. Norris and Wirtz had in 1933 purchased the Detroit NHL franchise and the Detroit Olympia. By court judgment, control of the Stadium changed hands to Norris and Wirtz for a total of , of which $150,000 went for back taxes, $50,000 for reorganization expenses, and $50,000 for new working capital.

===Seating capacity===
The Stadium sat 17,317 for hockey at the time of closure, though standing room pushed the &quot;actual&quot; attendance beyond that figure. The official attendance figures in the published game summaries were often given in round numbers, such as 18,500 or 20,000. The largest recorded crowd for an NHL game at the stadium was 20,069 for a playoff game between the Blackhawks and Minnesota North Stars on April 10, 1982.
 


==&quot;The Madhouse on Madison&quot;==
In addition to the close-quartered, triple-tiered, boxy layout of the building, much of the loud, ringing noise of the fans could be attributed to the fabled 3,663-pipe Barton organ. It was estimated to have the total volume of 25 brass bands. The organ was considered to have the world&#x27;s largest theater organ console with six manuals (keyboards) and over 800 stops. It was Harmon&#x27;s intention that the massive organ would be needed to provide the music for whatever event was playing in the building. It was played by Al Melgard for decades during hockey games there, earning the Stadium the moniker &quot;The Madhouse on Madison&quot;.

For years, the Stadium was also known as &quot;The Loudest Arena in the NBA&quot;, due to its barn-shaped features. When the Stadium closed in 1994, the organ was removed and prepared to be installed in the 19th hole museum. Soon after the museum closed, sending the organ along with another theatre organ to a warehouse in Phoenix Arizona. In October 1996, a year after the stadium was razed, a propane tank explosion melted and destroyed both pipe organs, excluding the console. The organ is currently in the residence of Phil Maloof and is in good working condition with new pipes.

In the Stanley Cup semifinals of 1971, when the Blackhawks scored a series-clinching empty-net goal in Game seven against the New York Rangers, CBS announcer Dan Kelly reported, &quot;I can feel our broadcast booth shaking! That&#x27;s the kind of place Chicago Stadium is right now!&quot; The dressing rooms at the Stadium were placed underneath the seats, and the cramped corridor that led to the ice, with its twenty-two steps, became the stuff of legend. Legend has it a German Shepherd wandered the bowels at night as &quot;the security team.&quot;

During the 1973 Stanley Cup Finals against Montreal, Blackhawks owner Bill Wirtz had the horn of his yacht (Kahlenberg Q-3) installed in the building, and had it sound after Blackhawks goals. This practice would, in the ensuing years, become commonplace in professional hockey.

Nancy Faust, organist for 40 years at Chicago White Sox games, also played indoors at the Stadium, at courtside for Chicago Bulls home games from 1976 to 1984, and on the pipe organ for Chicago Blackhawks hockey there from 1985 to 1989. She was replaced at the keyboard in 1990 by Frank Pellico, who served as the Hawks&#x27; organist until 2025.

It also became traditional for Blackhawk fans to cheer loudly throughout the singing of the national anthems, especially when sung by Chicago favorite Wayne Messmer. Denizens of the second balcony often added sparklers and flags to the occasion. Arguably, the most memorable of these was the singing before the 1991 NHL All-Star Game, which took place during the Gulf War. This tradition has continued at the United Center. Longtime PA announcer Harvey Wittenberg had a unique monotone style: &quot;Blackhawk goal scored by #9, Bobby Hull, unassisted, at 6:13.&quot; The Chicago Stadium also provided a unique fan experience. On the west side of the building was the Players/Employee/VIP Visitors Parking Lot. It is also where Teams/Bands/Politicians/Performers would enter the building through the legendary Gate 3 1/2 (Appropriately placed between Gates 3 and 4 on the North and South Sides). Although protected by fencing, it was where fans could see the talent get out of their cars or teams exit their buses before going into the building. It was also a great autograph and informal &quot;meet and greet&quot; opportunity.

The mid-1980s saw the beginning of a famous tradition for Bulls games at Chicago Stadium. Then-public address announcer Tommy Edwards would introduce the team&#x27;s starting lineup, accompanied by spotlights amid a darkened stadium, and the playing of &quot;Sirius&quot; by The Alan Parsons Project. This trademark introduction would continue under Edwards&#x27; successor Ray Clay, and soon became synonymous with the Bulls&#x27; 1990s dynasty with Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen and head coach Phil Jackson. During this period, the Bulls ceased using the organ in favor of recorded music in-game.

In 1992, both the Blackhawks and the Bulls reached the finals in their respective leagues. The Blackhawks were swept in their finals by the Pittsburgh Penguins, losing at Chicago Stadium, while the Bulls won the second of their first of three straight NBA titles on their home floor against the Portland Trail Blazers. The next time the Bulls clinched the championship at home was in the newly built United Center in (when they did so against the Seattle SuperSonics), their second season at the new arena, and the Blackhawks would not reach the Stanley Cup Finals again until (in which they defeated the Philadelphia Flyers in six games), their 16th season in the new building, although they won their first championship since in Philadelphia. The Blackhawks last won the Stanley Cup at the Stadium in ; they did not win the Cup again at home until at the United Center.

===Last analog game clock in any NHL arena===
It was also the last NHL arena to retain the use of an analog dial-type large four-sided clock for timekeeping in professional hockey games. Boston Garden and the Detroit Olympia (as well as the Buffalo Memorial Auditorium in its pre-NHL days) had identical scoreboards but replaced them with digital timers in the mid-1960s, with Boston having their digital four-sided clock in use for the 1969–70 NHL season. After removing the balcony-edge game clocks at either end and at mid-ice zones of the Stadium, the replacement four-sided game clock suspended over center ice of the Stadium, built by Bulova as their &quot;Sports Timer&quot;, was installed in Chicago in 1943. Each side of the clock had a large diameter 20-minute face in the center that kept the main game time for one period of ice hockey, with a set of shorter black-colored minute and longer red-colored sweep-second hands, and a pair of smaller, 5-minute capacity dual-concentric faces for penalty timekeeping, to the left and right of the primary 20-minute face—with each of the 5-minute penalty timers having its own single hand and each clock face, both the central main timer&#x27;s dial and flanking penalty timer dials (when a penalty was counting down) illuminated from behind during gameplay. The &quot;outer&quot; face of each penalty timer had a single hand that avoided obscuration of the &quot;inner&quot; face and its own, &quot;solid&quot; single hand, through the use of metal rods forming the outer hand&#x27;s &quot;shaft&quot;, holding its hand&#x27;s &quot;pointer&quot; head—the set of two concentric faces for each penalty timer dial could handle two penalties for each set, with an illuminated &quot;2&quot; on each penalty timer dial lighting up to display a minor penalty infraction. It was difficult to read how much time was left in a period of play on the main game timer&#x27;s large face, as each minute of play was marked by a longer line on every third &quot;seconds&quot; increment on the central main dial, due to the minute hand&#x27;s twenty-minute &quot;full rotation&quot; timing capacity for one period of ice hockey. The difficulty was compounded on the main central dial from the aforementioned minute and sweep-second hands being in constant motion during gameplay. The &quot;Sports Timer&#x27;s&quot; only digital displays were for scoring and for penalized players&#x27; numbers, each digit comprising a six-high, four-wide incandescent light dot matrix display.

That clock eventually was replaced by a four-sided scoreboard with a digital clock, first used on September 21, 1975, in Blackhawks preseason play, crafted by the Day Sign Company of Toronto, much like the one used at the end of the 1960s (and constructed by Day Sign Company) to replace the nearly identical Bulova Sports Timer game-timekeeping device in the Boston Garden, and then in 1985 by another, this one with a color electronic message board. That latter scoreboard was built by White Way Sign, which would build scoreboards for the United Center.

The Stadium was also one of the last three NHL arenas (the others being Boston Garden and the Buffalo Memorial Auditorium) to have a shorter-than-regulation ice surface, as their construction predated the regulation. The distance was taken out of the neutral zone.

==Demolition==
After the Blackhawks and Bulls moved to the United Center, the Chicago Stadium was demolished in 1995. Its site is now a parking lot for the United Center across the street. CNN televised the demolition, showing devoted Blackhawks and Bulls fans crying as the wrecking ball hit the old building. The console of the Barton organ now resides in the Phil Maloof residence in Las Vegas, Nevada. Also, the center of the Chicago Bulls&#x27; floor resides in Michael Jordan&#x27;s trophy room at his mansion in North Carolina.

A pavement plaque with the words &quot;Chicago Stadium – 1929–1994 – Remember The Roar&quot; is located behind a statue of the Blackhawks&#x27; greatest players on the north side of the United Center. Two friezes from Chicago Stadium were incorporated into a building at St. Ignatius College Prep School, 1076 W. Roosevelt Road.

Two of the Stadium&#x27;s main parking lots, which are still used for United Center parking, retain signs that read &quot;People&#x27;s Stadium Parking&quot;.

<text>, also known as or , was a Japanese political activist known for his perennial candidacy. He was the leader and founder of the World Economic Community Party ().

He was born in Ginowan, Okinawa on February 5, 1944. After graduating from Chuo University in Tokyo in 1968, he moved back to Okinawa and ran a &quot;juku&quot;, a private school. Matayoshi was trained as a Protestant preacher, and through his religious studies developed a particular concept of Christianity strongly influenced by eschatology. In 1997, he established the World Economic Community Party, a political party based on his conviction that he was God. His concept was both religious and political, a mix of Christian eschatology like Augustine&#x27;s &quot;De civitate Dei&quot; (&quot;City of God&quot;) and conservative collectivism. He died from kidney cancer on 20 July 2018 in Tokyo, aged 74.

== Political program ==
According to his programme he would have carried out the Last Judgment as Christ, but within the current political system. His first step was to have been appointed the Prime Minister of Japan. Then he would have reformed Japanese society and be offered the post of the Secretary-General of the United Nations. Matayoshi would then have reigned over the whole world with two legitimate authorities, not only religious but also political. The world economic system would have been altered to encourage every nation to be self-sufficient, based on agriculture. He condemned permanent residency and the naturalisation of foreigners because he viewed the abandonment of one&#x27;s motherland to be wrong. He wanted ethnically non-Japanese people to go back to their ancestral homeland even if they were born in Japan. He wanted the US to withdraw its army from all overseas positions, including Okinawa. After his Judgment he would have thrown the corrupt into the Fire (see Book of Revelation).

== Elections ==

Matayoshi presented himself as a candidate in many elections from 1997 through to 2013, despite winning none of them. He became well known for his eccentric campaigns in which he urged opponents to commit suicide by hara-kiri (disembowelment; note that he avoided the more polite &quot;seppuku&quot;) and said that he will cast them into Gehenna. Like most Japanese politicians, he campaigned in a single small regulation size mini-van fitted with oversized loudspeakers. Unlike most, however, he blasted his campaign slogans in a stylised, kabuki-inspired voice.

<doc id="760019" wikidata="Q732147" url="?curid=760019" title="Percival Molson Memorial Stadium">
<text>Percival Molson Memorial Stadium (also known in French as Stade Percival-Molson; commonly referred to as Molson Stadium in English or Stade Molson in French) is an outdoor football and multi-purpose stadium in Downtown Montreal, on the slopes of Mount Royal, in the borough of Ville-Marie. Named in honour of Percival Molson, and owned by McGill University, it was the home of the Montreal Alouettes of the Canadian Football League from 1954 to 1967 and again since 1998. The stadium is also home to the McGill Redbirds and Martlets of the RSEQ, the Montreal Royal of the American Ultimate Disc League, the Selwyn House Gryphons high-school football team and the Canadian Corporate Soccer League, the largest amateur corporate league in Canada.

==History==

Constructed in 1914 at the corner of University and Pine (avenue Des Pins), the stadium sat dormant through World War I with the cessation of football from 1914 to 1918. On July 5, 1917, Captain Percival Molson (1880–1917), great-grandson of brewer John Molson and a McGill University alumnus and sports star who had been instrumental in getting the stadium plan approved, was killed in action in France. His will left $75,000 to the university to help pay most of the total costs for the completion of the stadium. William C. Macdonald and John W. McConnell also donated money to help build and renovate the stadium. Designed by Percy Erskine Nobbs, the stadium was officially dedicated as &quot;McGill Graduates&#x27; Stadium&quot; at an intercollegiate track meet on October 22, 1915. It was renamed &quot;Percival Molson Memorial Stadium&quot; on October 25, 1919 by the university&#x27;s Board of Governors, in his honour.
The Montreal Alouettes played at the stadium from 1954 to 1967 before moving to the Autostade. An attempted return to the Molson Stadium in 1972 was not successful and the team went back to the Autostade the following season. When the revived Alouettes franchise was forced to move a 1997 playoff game out of Olympic Stadium due to a U2 concert scheduled for the day of the game, they played the game at Molson Stadium before a sellout crowd, prompting the Als to make it their primary home again the following season. However, all playoff games were played at Olympic Stadium until 2015.
The only Grey Cup game played at Molson Stadium was in 1931, which was the first time the Grey Cup was contested outside of Ontario. It also served as a venue for field hockey, during the 1976 Summer Olympics. It seated 20,202 and had been sold out for Alouettes games from August 12, 1999 until 2009. A renovation project begun in 2009 increased capacity from 20,202 to over 25,000 before seats were removed in 2014 to reduce capacity to 23,420. The seating capacity was lowered to 20,025 following a reconfiguration prior to the 2019 season.

The Alouettes&#x27; decision to return to the venue was problematic because the team was being sponsored by the Labatt Brewing Company and the stadium shared the name of its major competitor, Molson, though not named for it. Eventually, the team chose to change sponsors and have been sponsored by Budweiser since 2014. In 2004, The Alouettes installed a FieldTurf surface at Molson Stadium replacing the old-style Astroturf.

==Renovation==

Molson Stadium has been renovated and expanded, adding nearly 5,000 seats in time for the 2010 CFL season. The project to see the smallest CFL stadium increase to a seating capacity of 25,012 cost $29.4 million. 

Eleven rows were removed from the south side of the stadium to construct a second tier and add the majority of the new seats, about 3,800. Also, temporary bleachers in the east end-zone were replaced with 1,500 permanent seats, a new section was added to the northeast corner, and 19 new private suites were constructed. The cost of the renovations were shared by the Quebec government ($19.3 million), the city of Montreal ($4 million), and Robert Wetenhall, the Alouettes&#x27; owner ($6,023,935).

==Layout==
Because the playing surface is surrounded by a running track, the full 65-yard width and 20-yard length of the end zones is not available at the two end lines. However, the full width is available for more than half of each end zone, with the only missing pieces being the relatively small bits off the corners. Since the 2014 CFL season, it is the only stadium in the CFL to cut the corners on the end zones after Edmonton&#x27;s Commonwealth Stadium squared off its.

<text>was a Japanese astronomer, discoverer of minor planets and comets.

The fireball passed over west Japan and was recorded by photos and a sketch. Kōichirō Tomita identified that it was the Kosmos 133 spacecraft (30 November 1966).

He is credited by the Minor Planet Center with the discovery of 9 numbered minor planets during 1978–1982, such as 2252 CERGA, 3056 INAG, 3765 Texereau, 4051 Hatanaka.

He is the author of at least one astronomy book (in Japanese) about comets (which was translated and published in Russian in 1982).

The Nysa asteroid 2391 Tomita is named after him.

<doc id="760027" wikidata="Q1470555" url="?curid=760027" title="Frost line">
<text>The frost line—also known as frost depth or freezing depth—is most commonly the depth to which the groundwater in soil is expected to freeze. The frost depth depends on the climatic conditions of an area, the heat transfer properties of the soil and adjacent materials, and on nearby heat sources. For example, snow cover and asphalt insulate the ground and homes can heat the ground (see also &quot;heat island&quot;). The line varies by latitude, it is deeper closer to the poles. The maximum frost depth observed in the contiguous United States ranges from 0 to . Below that depth, the temperature varies, but is always above .

Alternatively, in Arctic and Antarctic locations the freezing depth is so deep that it becomes year-round permafrost, and the term &quot;thaw depth&quot; is used instead. Finally, in tropical regions, frost line may refer to the vertical geographic elevation below which frost does not occur.

&quot;Frost front&quot; refers to the varying position of the frost line during seasonal periods of freezing and thawing.

== Building codes ==
Building codes take frost depth into account because of frost heaving, which can damage buildings by moving their foundations. For this reason, foundations are generally built below the frost depth. Water and sewage pipes are typically buried below the frost line to prevent them from freezing. Alternatively, pipes may be insulated or heated using heat tape or similar products to allow for shallower depths. Due to additional cost, this method is typically only used where deeper trenching is not an option due to utility conflicts, shallow bedrock, or other conditions that make deeper excavation infeasible. 

There are many ways to predict frost depth, including factors related to air temperature, soil temperature, and soil properties.

<doc id="760032" wikidata="Q1361404" url="?curid=760032" title="Law of 22 Prairial">
<text>The Law of 22 Prairial, also known as the &quot;loi de la Grande Terreur&quot;, the law of the Great Terror, was enacted on 10 June 1794 (22 Prairial of the Year II under the French Revolutionary Calendar). It was proposed by Georges Auguste Couthon but seems to have been written by Maximilien Robespierre according to Laurent Lecointre. Using this law, the Committee of Public Safety simplified the judicial process to one of indictment and prosecution.

==Background==
The immediate background to the introduction of the Prairial Law was the attempted assassinations of Jean-Marie Collot d&#x27;Herbois on 23 May and of Maximilien Robespierre on 25 May. Introducing the decree at the Convention, Georges Couthon, who had drafted it, argued that political crimes were far worse than common crimes because in the latter &quot;only individuals are wounded&quot; whereas in the former &quot;the existence of free society is threatened&quot;. Under these circumstances, &quot;indulgence is an atrocity... clemency is parricide&quot;. The law was an extension of the centralisation and organisation of the Terror, following the decrees of 16 April and 8 May which had suspended the revolutionary court in the provinces and brought all political cases for trial in the capital. The result of these laws was that by June 1794 Paris was full of suspects awaiting trial. On 29 April it was reported that the forty prisons of Paris contained 6,921 prisoners; by 11 June this number had increased to 7,321 and by 28 July to 7,800.

The law was also prompted by the idea that members of the Convention who had supported Georges Danton were politically unreliable - a view shared by Robespierre, Couthon, Saint-Just and others. They felt that these people needed to be brought swiftly to justice without a full debate by the Convention itself. They considered Jean-Pierre-André Amar, for example, to be suspect.

==Purpose==
* The law extended the reach of the Revolutionary Tribunal, which henceforth could hear cases for &quot;slandering patriotism&quot;, &quot;seeking to inspire discouragement&quot;, &quot;spreading false news&quot; and &quot;depraving morals, corrupting the public conscience and impairing the purity and energy of the revolutionary government&quot;.

* It placed an active obligation on all citizens to denounce and bring to justice those suspected - &quot;Every citizen is empowered to seize conspirators and counterrevolutionaries, and to bring them before the magistrates. He is required to denounce them as soon as he knows of them.&quot; As Couthon explained to the Convention, &quot;For a citizen to become suspect it is sufficient that rumour accuses him&quot;.

* It limited trials in the Revolutionary Tribunal to three days.

* It prevented the Revolutionary Tribunal both from calling witnesses, or from allowing defence counsel to the accused. Juries were to come to judgement entirely on the basis of the accusation and the accused&#x27;s own defence.

* It required the Tribunal to come to one of only two possible verdicts - acquittal or death.

* The law cancelled all previous legislation on the same subject. Without being explicit, this removed the immunity of members of the Convention, which until then had protected them from summary arrest and required that the Convention itself vote to send any of its members to trial.

* The law would free the Revolutionary Tribunals from control by the Convention and would greatly strengthen the position of the accusateur public by limiting the ability of suspects to defend themselves. Furthermore, the law broadened the sorts of charges that could be brought so that virtually any criticism of the government became criminal.

==Effect==
The Prairial Law had an immediate effect on the tempo of executions under the Terror. From an average of five executions a day in Germinal, the rate rose to seventeen in Prairial and twenty-six in Messidor. The law thus inaugurated the period known as &quot;The Great Terror&quot;.

==Consequences==
The proposals were met with dismay when they were presented to the Convention. The Committee of Public Safety had not reviewed the text before it was presented, although it was presented in the name of the Committee itself. The Committee of General Security had not even been informed that the law was being drafted.

Some of the deputies were uneasy, in particular, about the removal of their immunity and asked for the debate to be adjourned so the clauses could be examined. Robespierre refused and demanded immediate discussion. At his insistence the entire decree was voted on, clause by clause. It passed. The next day, 11 June, when Robespierre was absent, Bourdon de l&#x27;Oise and Merlin de Douai put forward an amendment proclaiming the inalienable right of the Convention to impeach its own members. The amendment was passed.

Furious, Robespierre and Couthon returned to the Convention the next day, 12 June, and demanded that the amendment of the previous day be revoked. Robespierre made a number of veiled threats and during the debate clashed particularly with Jean-Lambert Tallien. The Convention acceded to Robespierre&#x27;s wishes and restored the original text of the decree Couthon had drafted.

As the Terror accelerated and members felt more and more threatened, Tallien and others began to make plans for the overthrow of Robespierre. Less than two months later, on 27 July, Tallien and his associates overthrew Robespierre, beginning the Thermidorian Reaction.

The Law of 22 Prairial was repealed on 1 August 1794 and Antoine Quentin Fouquier-Tinville, who had presided over the Revolutionary Tribunal, was arrested and later guillotined.

<doc id="760038" wikidata="Q5123438" url="?curid=760038" title="City Stadium (Green Bay)">
<text>City Stadium is an American football stadium in Green Bay, Wisconsin, on the north side of the Green Bay East High School property.
It was the home of the Green Bay Packers of the NFL from 1925 through 1956. Renovated and downsized, City Stadium remains the home to the adjacent Green Bay East High School athletic teams. Prior to 1925, the Packers played home games at nearby Hagemeister Park (the site of East High School itself) and Bellevue Park.

==History==
The horseshoe-shaped stadium was made of wood and originally did not have any toilet facilities. It stood behind East High School and next to the East River. The Packers used the school for locker room facilities, but visiting teams often dressed at their hotel (usually the Hotel Northland) before the game rather than use the lockers at East High. The stadium originally seated 6,000 and its capacity was gradually expanded to 25,000. The Packers compiled a record of 88-41-7 () at City Stadium, including NFL championship seasons in 1929, 1930, 1931, 1936, 1939, and 1944. However, City Stadium never hosted an NFL Championship Game. Of the four championship games the Packers played in during the years of City Stadium, the team hosted only one, the 1939 title game, which was played in Milwaukee instead.

Although City Stadium was the Packers&#x27; official home field, in 1933—during the worst of the Great Depression—they began to play part of their home schedule in Milwaukee. After holding one contest at Borchert Field in 1933, the Packers played two or three home games each year in Milwaukee, at State Fair Park in West Allis from 1934 to 1951 and at Marquette Stadium in 1952. The games were moved to County Stadium after it opened in 1953. The practice continued through 1994, after which they were again based solely in Green Bay.
While its playing surface was consistently praised, by the 1950s the stadium was seen as too small and inadequate, even after expansion, which was limited by both natural and man-made factors, including both East High to the south and the East River on its north and east edges. The leaders of the NFL, including George Halas, gave the Packer board an ultimatum—build a new stadium or move to Milwaukee full-time.

The residents of Green Bay responded by approving (70.3%) a bond issue in April 1956 to build a new City Stadium, which opened the following year, as &quot;old&quot; City Stadium became a high school field. The new stadium was renamed Lambeau Field in August 1965, after the death of team founder Curly Lambeau.

===After the Packers===

In recent years, ornamental fencing and monuments to the history of the field have been erected. Before the 2008 renovations, it was often referred to as East Stadium or Old City Stadium.

The 100th Green Bay East–West football game was played at City Stadium in 2005, with approximately 8,000 people attending the historic event. 
As an observance of the 50th anniversary of the opening of Lambeau Field, the Packers held practice at City Stadium on July 31, 2007. 

In the summer of 2008, City Stadium was renovated with a new press box, new bleachers on the home side of the field, and two new football goal posts. Much of the structure had dated to the 1960s and become unsafe. The field received artificial turf in 2017. The only remaining part of the original venue is the equipment shed at the northwest corner of the facility.

In addition to football, the field has hosted soccer matches. Until 2004, the Green Bay East and Green Bay Preble soccer programs shared the field for their home games. It is also a part of the City Walk section of the Packers Heritage Trail.

<doc id="760042" wikidata="Q550311" url="?curid=760042" title="Yoshihiro Togashi">
<text>is a Japanese manga artist. He began drawing manga at an early age, before being recognized for his talent by the publishing company Shueisha while attending college. Togashi has authored several different manga series in different genres over the past three decades. He is best known for writing and illustrating the &quot;YuYu Hakusho&quot; (1990–1994) and &quot;Hunter × Hunter&quot; (1998–present) series, which are some of the best-selling manga series of all time. Togashi is married to Naoko Takeuchi, the author of &quot;Sailor Moon&quot;.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Born in Shinjō, Yamagata to a family that owned a paper shop, Togashi began drawing manga casually in his first to second year of elementary school. In high school, Togashi joined the fine-arts club; he later enrolled at Yamagata University where he studied education in the hope of becoming a teacher. During college he submitted some of his manga work to &quot;Weekly Young Jump&quot;, published by Shueisha. In 1986, at age 20, he authored a manga titled for which he received the Tezuka Award, the most prestigious award for new comic artists in Japan. Another manga by Togashi titled was an honorable mention in Shueisha&#x27;s first annual &quot;Hop Step Award Selection&quot; magazine, published in 1988. After having given up his goal of becoming a teacher, Togashi was contacted by an editor of &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; during his senior year of college, who asked him to move to Tokyo.

===Career===
Togashi&#x27;s earliest published works for Shueisha include , a collection of comedy manga short-stories. &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; published some of the stories prior to a &quot;tankōbon&quot; release in 1989. Between 1989 and 1990, Togashi authored , a four-volume romance manga involving the relationship between a normal, human boy and a beautiful, devil girl.

In 1990, Togashi made a name for himself with his next series, . Based on his interests in the occult and horror films, the plot features the character Yusuke Urameshi, who is killed and brought back to life as an &quot;Underworld Detective&quot;. The manga, which lasted 175 chapters over 19 &quot;tankōbon&quot; from 1990 to 1994, went on to sell over 78 million copies worldwide, earned Togashi a Shogakukan Manga Award in 1994, and received a hit anime adaptation. In 1995, he created , a science fiction-comedy manga. Comprising three volumes, it was first published in &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; in 1995 and ran until 1997. &quot;Level E&quot; was adapted into an anime television series in 2011.

Togashi&#x27;s next major manga series, &quot;Hunter × Hunter&quot;, began serialization in 1998. The story revolves around the protagonist Gon Freecss, a young boy searching for his father, a legendary, elite member of society called a &quot;Hunter&quot;. This manga also performed very well commercially, with the first 20 volumes selling nearly 55 million copies in Japan as of August 2011. It has 84 million copies in circulation as of July 4, 2022. In 2008, Togashi tied with &quot;One Piece&quot; author Eiichiro Oda as the fifth favorite manga artist from a poll posted by the marketing research firm Oricon.

In 2017, Togashi wrote the two-chapter manga . It was illustrated by Hachi Mizuno and published in the September and November issues of &quot;Grand Jump Premium&quot;.

==Personal life==
Togashi is married to Naoko Takeuchi, the creator of &quot;Sailor Moon&quot;. The two were introduced at a party hosted by Kazushi Hagiwara in August 1997. The following year, Takeuchi assisted Togashi for a short time by adding screentone to his manga &quot;Hunter × Hunter&quot;. Togashi and Takeuchi were married on January 6, 1999. In attendance for the ceremony were several fellow manga artists and voice actors from both the &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; and &quot;Yu Yu Hakusho&quot; anime series. The couple have two children and have collaborated on a children&#x27;s book titled , which Takeuchi wrote and Togashi illustrated.

Togashi enjoys board-game-style video games and bowling with his family. He also likes watching horror movies, and considers &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Up&quot; and &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; his favorites. Togashi cites visual effects designer H. R. Giger as a major influence. Togashi suffered from an immense amount of stress while working on &quot;YuYu Hakusho&quot;, which caused him inconsistent sleep patterns and chest pain. On March 29, 2011, Togashi and his fellow manga artists posted messages on the official &quot;Shōnen Jump&quot; website in support of the victims of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. He has a younger brother named Hideaki Togashi, who is also a manga artist. The Togashi Paper Store run by his mother is still open in Shinjō, Yamagata.

On May 24, 2022, Togashi created a Twitter account that was later verified by Shueisha. He gained over one million followers in one day, and two million in 72 hours. He is the most-followed manga artist on the platform, with over three million followers. Currently he mainly posts the progresses of his works on Twitter.

For years, he has been suffering from chronic back issues, leading to several hiatuses spanning multiple years. Due to these issues, he is only able to draw sporadically and only while laying down.

==Style==
Manga critic Jason Thompson stated that &quot;Togashi is no ordinary mangaka; he does things his own way&quot;, furthering that his first one-shots were a mix of school comedy and &quot;splatter-film horror references&quot;. At age 24, Togashi created a hit with the supernatural fighting comedy &quot;YuYu Hakusho&quot;, one of the &quot;obvious imitators&quot; of the &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; formula of &quot;start out as a comedy and then, once the readers like the characters, have them kick the crap out of each other&quot;. Then, rather than continue the series for as long as possible to maximize his profit, Togashi ended the series abruptly. He then created the &quot;0% fighting and 100% humor&quot; science-fiction horror manga &quot;Level E&quot;.

Togashi&#x27;s style of artwork began with screentone but gradually developed into minimalism. Both Rika Takahashi of EX.org and Claude J. Pelletier of &quot;Protoculture Addicts&quot; found the art style in &quot;Hunter × Hunter&quot; much simpler than &quot;YuYu Hakusho&quot; and &quot;Level E&quot;. Thompson noted that artwork during &quot;Hunter × Hunter&quot;″s magazine run is often &quot;sketchy&quot; and missing backgrounds, but Togashi goes back and fixes it for its collected &quot;tankōbon&quot; release. He also wrote that Togashi has a love of gore and noted that some panels in &quot;Hunter × Hunter&quot; are apparently censored for gore, being covered with screentone.

Since 2006, Togashi has taken numerous lengthy hiatuses while serializing &quot;Hunter × Hunter&quot;. Some were due to illness and lower back pain, while reasons for others were never disclosed. In 2012, Thompson speculated that Togashi&#x27;s slow output was &quot;because he&#x27;s a perfectionist who enjoys his work and wants to do things himself&quot;, noting that his assistants could potentially be called upon further. In his 2017 book &quot;Sensei Hakusho&quot;, which recounts his work as Togashi&#x27;s assistant from 1990 to 1997, Kunio Ajino stated that Togashi was unusually generous to his staff. In July 2022, Togashi revealed that he was unable to sit in a chair for two years due to his back and hip problems, but was able to resume drawing by doing so while lying down.

Manga artists Nobuhiro Watsuki and Pink Hanamori have cited Togashi and &quot;YuYu Hakusho&quot; as an influence. He is one of the favorite artists of &quot;Naruto&quot; author Masashi Kishimoto. &quot;Jujutsu Kaisen&quot; author Gege Akutami named Togashi as an influence and was inspired by &quot;YuYu Hakusho&quot; and &quot;Hunter × Hunter&quot;.

<doc id="760054" wikidata="Q135662" url="?curid=760054" title="Cupid and Psyche">
<text>Cupid and Psyche is a story originally from &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; (also called &quot;The Golden Ass&quot;), written in the 2nd century AD by Lucius Apuleius Madaurensis (or Platonicus). The tale concerns the overcoming of obstacles to the love between Psyche (; , ) and Cupid (, ) or (, Greek Eros, ), and their ultimate union in a sacred marriage. Although the only extended narrative from antiquity is that of Apuleius from the 2nd century AD, Eros and Psyche appear in Greek art as early as the 4th century BC. The story&#x27;s Neoplatonic elements and allusions to mystery religions accommodate multiple interpretations, and it has been analyzed as an allegory and in light of folktale, &quot;Märchen&quot; or fairy tale, and myth.

The story of Cupid and Psyche was known to Boccaccio in c. 1370. The &quot;first printed version&quot; dates to 1469. Ever since, the reception of &quot;Cupid and Psyche&quot; in the classical tradition has been extensive. The story has been retold in poetry, drama, and opera, and depicted widely in painting, sculpture, and even wallpaper. Though Psyche is usually referred to in Roman mythology by her Greek name, her Roman name through direct translation is Anima.

==In Apuleius==
The tale of Cupid and Psyche (or &quot;Eros and Psyche&quot;) is placed at the midpoint of Apuleius&#x27;s novel, and occupies about a fifth of its total length. The novel itself is a first-person narrative by the protagonist Lucius. Transformed into a donkey by magic gone wrong, Lucius undergoes various trials and adventures, and finally regains human form by eating roses sacred to Isis. Psyche&#x27;s story has some similarities, including the theme of dangerous curiosity, punishments and tests, and redemption through divine favor.

As a structural mirror of the overarching plot, the tale is an example of &quot;mise en abyme&quot;. It occurs within a complex narrative frame, with Lucius recounting the tale as it in turn was told by an old woman to Charite, a bride kidnapped by pirates on her wedding day and held captive in a cave. The happy ending for Psyche is supposed to assuage Charite&#x27;s fear of rape, in one of several instances of Apuleius&#x27;s irony.

Although the tale resists explication as a strict allegory of a particular Platonic argument, Apuleius drew generally on imagery such as the laborious ascent of the winged soul (&quot;Phaedrus&quot; 248) and the union with the divine achieved by Soul through the agency of the &quot;daemon&quot; Love (&quot;Symposium&quot; 212b).

===Story===

There were once a king and queen, rulers of an unnamed city, who had three daughters of conspicuous beauty. The youngest and most beautiful was Psyche, whose admirers, neglecting the proper worship of Aphrodite (love goddess Venus), instead prayed and made offerings to her. It was rumored that she was the second coming of Venus, or the daughter of Venus from an unseemly union between the goddess and a mortal. Venus is offended, and commissions Cupid to work her revenge. Cupid is sent to shoot Psyche with an arrow so that she may fall in love with something hideous. He instead scratches himself with his own dart, which makes any living thing fall in love with the first thing it sees. Consequently, he falls deeply in love with Psyche and disobeys his mother&#x27;s order.

Although her two humanly beautiful sisters have married, the idolized Psyche has yet to find love. Her father suspects that they have incurred the wrath of the gods, and consults the oracle of Apollo. The response is unsettling: the king is to expect not a human son-in-law, but rather a dragon-like creature who harasses the world with fire and iron and is feared by even Jupiter and the inhabitants of the underworld.

Psyche is arrayed in funeral attire, conveyed by a procession to the peak of a rocky crag, and exposed. Marriage and death are merged into a single rite of passage, a &quot;transition to the unknown&quot;. Zephyrus the West Wind bears her up to meet her fated match, and deposits her in a lovely meadow &quot;(locus amoenus)&quot;, where she promptly falls asleep.

The transported girl awakes to find herself at the edge of a cultivated grove &quot;(lucus)&quot;. Exploring, she finds a marvelous house with golden columns, a carved ceiling of citrus wood and ivory, silver walls embossed with wild and domesticated animals, and jeweled mosaic floors. A disembodied voice tells her to make herself comfortable, and she is entertained at a feast that serves itself and by singing to an invisible lyre.

Although fearful and without the proper experience, she allows herself to be guided to a bedroom where, in the darkness, a being she cannot see has sex with her. She gradually learns to look forward to his visits, though he always departs before sunrise and forbids her to look upon him. Soon, she becomes pregnant.

====Violation of trust====
Psyche&#x27;s family longs for news of her, and after much cajoling, Cupid, still unknown to his bride, permits Zephyr to carry her sisters up for a visit. When they see the splendor in which Psyche lives, they become envious, and undermine her happiness by prodding her to uncover her husband&#x27;s true identity, since surely as foretold by the oracle she was lying with the vile winged serpent, who would devour her and her child.
One night after Cupid falls asleep, Psyche carries out the plan her sisters devised: she brings out a dagger and a lamp she had hidden in the room, in order to see and kill the monster. But when the light instead reveals the most beautiful creature she has ever seen, she is so startled that she wounds herself on one of the arrows in Cupid&#x27;s cast-aside quiver. Struck with a feverish passion, she spills hot oil from the lamp and wakes him. He flees, and though she tries to pursue, he flies away and leaves her on the bank of a river.

There she is discovered by the wilderness god Pan, who recognizes the signs of passion upon her. She acknowledges his divinity &quot;(numen)&quot;, then begins to wander the earth looking for her lost love.

Psyche visits first one sister, then the other; both are seized with renewed envy upon learning the identity of Psyche&#x27;s secret husband. Each sister attempts to offer herself as a replacement by climbing the rocky crag and casting herself upon Zephyr for conveyance, but instead is allowed to fall to a brutal death.

====Wanderings and trials====
In the course of her wanderings, Psyche comes upon a temple of Ceres, and inside finds a disorder of grain offerings, garlands, and agricultural implements. Recognizing that the proper cultivation of the gods should not be neglected, she puts everything in good order, prompting a theophany of Ceres herself. Although Psyche prays for her aid, and Ceres acknowledges that she deserves it, the goddess is prohibited from helping her against a fellow goddess. A similar incident occurs at a temple of Juno. Psyche realizes that she must serve Venus herself.

Venus revels in having the girl under her power, and turns Psyche over to her two handmaids, Worry and Sadness, to be whipped and tortured. Venus tears her clothes and bashes her head into the ground, and mocks her for conceiving a child in a sham marriage. The goddess then throws before her a great mass of mixed wheat, barley, poppyseed, chickpeas, lentils, and beans, demanding that she sort them into separate heaps by dawn. But when Venus withdraws to attend a wedding feast, a kind ant takes pity on Psyche, and assembles a fleet of insects to accomplish the task. Venus is furious when she returns drunk from the feast, and only tosses Psyche a crust of bread. At this point in the story, it is revealed that Cupid is also in the house of Venus, languishing from his injury.
At dawn, Venus sets a second task for Psyche. She is to cross a river and fetch golden wool from violent sheep who graze on the other side. These sheep are elsewhere identified as belonging to Helios. Psyche&#x27;s only intention is to drown herself on the way, but instead she is saved by instructions from a divinely inspired reed, of the type used to make musical instruments, and gathers the wool caught on briers.

For Psyche&#x27;s third task, she is given a crystal vessel in which to collect the black water spewed by the source of the rivers Styx and Cocytus. Climbing the cliff from which it issues, she is daunted by the foreboding air of the place and dragons slithering through the rocks, and falls into despair. Jupiter himself takes pity on her, and sends his eagle to battle the dragons and retrieve the water for her.

====Psyche and the underworld====
The last trial Venus imposes on Psyche is a quest to the underworld itself. She is to take a box &quot;(pyxis)&quot; and obtain in it a dose of the beauty of Proserpina, queen of the underworld. Venus claims her own beauty has faded through tending her ailing son, and she needs this remedy in order to attend the theatre of the gods &quot;(theatrum deorum)&quot;.

Once again despairing of her task, Psyche climbs a tower, planning to throw herself off. The tower, however, suddenly breaks into speech, and advises her to travel to Lacedaemon, Greece, and to seek out the place called Taenarus, where she will find the entrance to the underworld. The tower offers instructions for navigating the underworld:

The airway of Dis is there, and through the yawning gates the pathless route is revealed. Once you cross the threshold, you are committed to the unswerving course that takes you to the very Regia of Orcus. But you shouldn&#x27;t go emptyhanded through the shadows past this point, but rather carry cakes of honeyed barley in both hands, and transport two coins in your mouth.

The speaking tower warns her to maintain silence as she passes by several ominous figures: a lame man driving a mule loaded with sticks, a dead man swimming in the river that separates the world of the living from the world of the dead, and old women weaving. These, the tower warns, will seek to divert her by pleading for her help: she must ignore them. The cakes are treats for distracting Cerberus, the three-headed watchdog of Orcus, and the two coins for Charon the ferryman, so she can make a return trip.

Everything comes to pass according to plan, and Proserpina grants Psyche&#x27;s humble entreaty. As soon as she reenters the light of day, however, Psyche is overcome by a bold curiosity, and can&#x27;t resist opening the box in the hope of enhancing her own beauty. She finds nothing inside but an &quot;infernal and Stygian sleep&quot;, which sends her into a deep and unmoving torpor.

====Reunion and immortal love====
Meanwhile, Cupid&#x27;s wound has healed into a scar, and he escapes his mother&#x27;s house by flying out of a window. When he finds Psyche, he draws the sleep from her face and replaces it in the box, then pricks her with an arrow that does no harm. He lifts her into the air, and takes her to present the box to Venus.

He then takes his case to Zeus, who gives his consent in return for Cupid&#x27;s future help whenever a choice maiden catches his eye. Zeus has Hermes convene an assembly of the gods in the theater of heaven, where he makes a public statement of approval, warns Venus to back off, and gives Psyche ambrosia, the drink of immortality, so the couple can be united in marriage as equals. Their union, he says, will redeem Cupid from his history of provoking adultery and sordid liaisons. Zeus&#x27;s word is solemnized with a wedding banquet.

With its happy marriage and resolution of conflicts, the tale ends in the manner of classic comedy or Greek romances such as &quot;Daphnis and Chloe&quot;. The child born to the couple will be Voluptas (Greek Hedone ), &quot;Pleasure&quot;.

====&quot;The Wedding of Cupid and Psyche&quot;====

The assembly of the gods has been a popular subject for both visual and performing arts, with the wedding banquet of Cupid and Psyche a particularly rich occasion. With the wedding of Peleus and Thetis, this is the most common setting for a &quot;Feast of the Gods&quot; scene in art. Apuleius describes the scene in terms of a festive Roman dinner party &quot;(cena)&quot;. Cupid, now a husband, reclines in the place of honor (the &quot;top&quot; couch) and embraces Psyche in his lap. Zeus and Hera situate themselves likewise, and all the other gods are arranged in order. The cupbearer of Jove (Zeus&#x27;s other Roman name) serves him with nectar, the &quot;wine of the gods&quot;; Apuleius refers to the cupbearer only as &quot;ille rusticus puer&quot;, &quot;that country boy&quot;, and not as Ganymede. Liber, the Roman god of wine, serves the rest of the company. Vulcan, the god of fire, cooks the food; the Horae (&quot;Seasons&quot; or &quot;Hours&quot;) adorn, or more literally &quot;empurple&quot;, everything with roses and other flowers; the Graces suffuse the setting with the scent of balsam, and the Muses with melodic singing. Apollo sings to his lyre, and Venus takes the starring role in dancing at the wedding, with the Muses as her chorus girls, a satyr blowing the aulos &quot;(tibia&quot; in Latin), and a young Pan expressing himself through the pan pipes &quot;(fistula)&quot;.

The wedding provides closure for the narrative structure as well as for the love story: the mysteriously provided pleasures Psyche enjoyed in the &quot;domus&quot; of Cupid at the beginning of her odyssey, when she entered into a false marriage preceded by funeral rites, are reimagined in the hall of the gods following correct ritual procedure for a real marriage. The arranging of the gods in their proper order &quot;(in ordinem)&quot; would evoke for the Roman audience the religious ceremony of the &quot;lectisternium&quot;, a public banquet held for the major deities in the form of statues arranged on luxurious couches, as if they were present and participating in the meal.

The wedding banquet was a favored theme for Renaissance art. As early as 1497, Giovanni Sabadino degli Arienti made the banquet central to his description of a now-lost Cupid and Psyche cycle at the Villa Belriguardo, near Ferrara. At the Villa Farnesina in Rome, it is one of two main scenes for the Loggia di Psiche (ca. 1518) by Raphael and his workshop, as well as for the Stanza di Psiche (1545–46) by Perino del Vaga at the Castel Sant&#x27; Angelo. Hendrick Goltzius introduced the subject to northern Europe with his &quot;enormous&quot; engraving called &quot;The Wedding of Cupid and Psyche&quot; (1587, 43 by 85.4 cm), which influenced how other northern artists depicted assemblies of the gods in general. The engraving in turn had been taken from Bartholomaeus Spranger&#x27;s 1585 drawing of the same title, considered a &quot;&quot;locus classicus&quot; of Dutch Mannerism&quot; and discussed by Karel Van Mander for its exemplary composition involving numerous figures.

In the 18th century, François Boucher&#x27;s &quot;Marriage of Cupid and Psyche&quot; (1744) affirmed Enlightenment ideals with the authority figure Jupiter presiding over a marriage of lovely equals. The painting reflects the Rococo taste for pastels, fluid delicacy, and amorous scenarios infused with youth and beauty.

==As allegory==
The story of Cupid and Psyche was readily allegorized. In late antiquity, Martianus Capella (5th century) refashions it as an allegory about the fall of the human soul. For Apuleius, immortality is granted to the soul of Psyche as a reward for commitment to sexual love. In the version of Martianus, sexual love draws Psyche into the material world that is subject to death: &quot;Cupid takes Psyche from Virtue and shackles her in adamantine chains&quot;.

The tale thus lent itself to adaptation in a Christian or mystical context, often as symbolic of the soul. In the Gnostic text &quot;On the Origin of the World&quot;, the first rose is created from the blood of Psyche when she loses her virginity to Cupid. To the Christian mythographer Fulgentius (6th century), Psyche was an Adam figure, driven by sinful curiosity and lust from the paradise of Love&#x27;s domain. Psyche&#x27;s sisters are Flesh and Free Will, and her parents are God and Matter. To Boccaccio (14th century), the marriage of Cupid and Psyche symbolized the union of soul and God.

The allure to interpret the story as a religious or philosophical allegory can still be found in modern scholarship. Psyche by her very name represents the aspirations of the human soul—towards a divine love personified in Cupid. This simplistic interpretation overlooks the original characterisation of Cupid as a corrupter who delights in disrupting marriages (&quot;The Golden Ass&quot; IV. 30) and was &quot;notorious for his adulteries&quot; (VI. 23), as well as the descriptions of his sensual unions with Psyche (V. 13), the aid Jupiter offers to Cupid in return for a new girl that Jupiter may seduce (VI. 22), and the name given to Cupid and Psyche&#x27;s child (&quot;Voluptas/&quot;Pleasure). However, when he admits that &quot;I [Cupid], the famed archer, wounded myself with my own weapon, and made you [Psyche] my wife&quot; (V. 24), having cut himself on his own magic arrow (which induces passionate love for the first person the victim lays eyes on), the temptation for an allegorical interpretation of the story becomes somewhat complexified but not inherently contradictory or unsubstantiated. The arrows of desire make it so that the victim cannot be satisfied with anyone except the sole target of their newfound affections; thus, Cupid&#x27;s former predilections no longer occupy the same prominence they once held in his character, so that he changes from a wanton homewrecker to a devoted husband by the end of the narrative. 

==Classical tradition==
Apuleius&#x27;s novel was among the ancient texts that made the crucial transition from roll to codex form when it was edited at the end of the 4th century. It was known to Latin writers such as Augustine of Hippo, Macrobius, Sidonius Apollinaris, Martianus Capella, and Fulgentius, but toward the end of the 6th century lapsed into obscurity and survived what was formerly known as the &quot;Dark Ages&quot; through perhaps a single manuscript. The &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; remained unknown in the 13th century, but copies began to circulate in the mid-1300s among the early humanists of Florence. Boccaccio&#x27;s text and interpretation of &quot;Cupid and Psyche&quot; in his &quot;Genealogia deorum gentilium&quot; (written in the 1370s and published 1472) was a major impetus to the reception of the tale in the Italian Renaissance and to its dissemination throughout Europe.

One of the most popular images from the tale was Psyche&#x27;s discovery of a naked Cupid sleeping, found in ceramics, stained glass, and frescos. Mannerist painters were intensely drawn to the scene. In England, the Cupid and Psyche theme had its &quot;most lustrous period&quot; from 1566 to 1635, beginning with the first English translation by William Adlington. A fresco cycle for Hill Hall, Essex, was modeled indirectly after that of the Villa Farnesina around 1570, and Thomas Heywood&#x27;s masque &quot;Love&#x27;s Mistress&quot; dramatized the tale to celebrate the wedding of Charles I and Henrietta Maria, who later had her withdrawing chamber decorated with a 22-painting &quot;Cupid and Psyche&quot; cycle by Jacob Jordaens. The cycle took the divinization of Psyche as the centerpiece of the ceiling, and was a vehicle for the Neoplatonism the queen brought with her from France. The &quot;Cupid and Psyche&quot; produced by Orazio Gentileschi for the royal couple shows a fully robed Psyche whose compelling interest is psychological, while Cupid is mostly nude.

Another peak of interest in &quot;Cupid and Psyche&quot; occurred in the Paris of the late 1790s and early 1800s, reflected in a proliferation of opera, ballet, Salon art, deluxe book editions, interior decoration such as clocks and wall paneling, and even hairstyles. In the aftermath of the French Revolution, the myth became a vehicle for the refashioning of the self. In English intellectual and artistic circles around the turn of the 18th and 19th centuries, the fashion for &quot;Cupid and Psyche&quot; accompanied a fascination for the ancient mystery religions. In writing about the Portland Vase, which was obtained by the British Museum around 1810, Erasmus Darwin speculated that the myth of Cupid and Psyche was part of the Eleusinian cycle. With his interest in natural philosophy, Darwin saw the butterfly as an apt emblem of the soul because it began as an earthbound caterpillar, &quot;died&quot; into the pupal stage, and was then resurrected as a beautiful winged creature.

===Literature===
In 1491, the poet Niccolò da Correggio retold the story with Cupid as the narrator. John Milton alludes to the story at the conclusion of &quot;Comus&quot; (1634), attributing not one but two children to the couple: Youth and Joy. Shackerley Marmion wrote a verse version called &quot;Cupid and Psyche&quot; (1637), and La Fontaine adapted the story into a mixed prose and verse romance named &quot;Les Amours de Psiché et de Cupidon&quot; (&quot;The Loves of Cupid and Psyche&quot;; 1669).

William Blake&#x27;s mythology draws on elements of the tale particularly in the figures of Luvah and Vala. Luvah takes on the various guises of Apuleius&#x27;s Cupid: beautiful and winged; disembodied voice; and serpent. Blake, who mentions his admiration for Apuleius in his notes, combines the myth with the spiritual quest expressed through the eroticism of the Song of Solomon, with Solomon and the Shulamite as a parallel couple.

Mary Tighe published her poem &quot;Psyche&quot; in 1805. She added some details to the story, such as placing two springs in Venus&#x27; garden, one with sweet water and one with bitter. When Cupid starts to obey his mother&#x27;s command, he brings some of both to a sleeping Psyche, but places only the bitter water on Psyche&#x27;s lips. Tighe&#x27;s Venus only asks one task of Psyche, to bring her the forbidden water, but in performing this task Psyche wanders into a country bordering on Spenser&#x27;s &quot;Fairie Queene&quot; as Psyche is aided by a mysterious visored knight and his squire Constance, and must escape various traps set by Vanity, Flattery, Ambition, Credulity, Disfida (who lives in a &quot;Gothic castle&quot;), Varia and Geloso. Spenser&#x27;s Blatant Beast also makes an appearance. Tighe&#x27;s work influenced English lyric poetry on the theme, such as the &quot;Ode to Psyche&quot; (1820) by John Keats. Letitia Elizabeth Landon&#x27;s poem &quot;Cupid and Psyche&quot; (1826) illustrates an engraving of a painting by W. E. West.

William Morris retold the Cupid and Psyche story in verse in &quot;The Earthly Paradise&quot; (1868–70), and a chapter in Walter Pater&#x27;s &quot;Marius the Epicurean&quot; (1885) was a prose translation. About the same time, Robert Bridges wrote &quot;Eros and Psyche: A Narrative Poem in Twelve Measures&quot; (1885; 1894).

Sylvia Townsend Warner transferred the story to Victorian England in her novel &quot;The True Heart&quot; (1929), though few readers made the connection till she pointed it out herself. Other literary adaptations include &quot;The Robber Bridegroom&quot; (1942), a novella by Eudora Welty; &quot;Till We Have Faces&quot; (1956), a version by C. S. Lewis narrated by a sister of Psyche; and the poem &quot;Psyche: &#x27;Love drove her to Hell&#x27;&quot; by H.D. (Hilda Doolittle). Robert A. Johnson made use of the story in his book &quot;She: Understanding Feminine Psychology&quot;, published in 1976 by HarperCollinsPublishers.

====Translations====
William Adlington made the first translation into English of Apuleius&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; in 1566, under the title &quot;&quot;. Adlington seems not to have been interested in a Neoplatonic reading, but his translation consistently suppresses the sensuality of the original. Thomas Taylor published an influential translation of &quot;Cupid and Psyche&quot; in 1795, several years before his complete &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;. A translation by Robert Graves appeared in 1951 as &quot;The Transformations of Lucius Otherwise Known as THE GOLDEN ASS, A New Translation by Robert Graves from Apuleius&quot;, published by Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, New York.

====Folklore and children&#x27;s literature====
=====Origins=====
Folklore scholarship has also occupied itself with the possible origin of the narrative. Swedish folklorist , who authored a long study on the story, German philologist Ludwig Friedländer and Russian folklorist Vladimir Propp defended the idea that it originated from a legitimate folklore source.

Some scholars tend to look for a single source: Stith Thompson suggested an Italian origin, while Lesky, Gédeon Huet and indicated a Greek origin. French favoured a North African source, followed by French researchers Nedjima and Emmanuel Plantade, who all argue that the tale is a reworking of Berber folklore, since Apuleius was born and lived in Madauros, Numidia, located in what is modern day Algeria.

Another line of scholars argue for some myth that underlines the Apuleian narrative. German classicist Richard August Reitzenstein supposed on an &quot;Iranian sacral myth&quot;, brought to Greece via Egypt. Graham Anderson argues for a reworking of mythic material from Asia Minor (namely, Hittite: the Myth of Telipinu). In a study published posthumously, Romanian folklorist also argued for a folkloric origin, but was of the notion that Apuleius superimposed Graeco-Roman mythology on a pre-Christian myth about a serpentine or draconic husband, or a &quot;King of Snakes&quot; that becomes human at night.

On the other extreme, German classicist took a hard and skeptical approach and considered the tale to be a literary invention of Apuleius himself.

=====Literary legacy=====
Friedländer also listed several European tales of marriage between a human maiden and prince cursed to be an animal, as related to the &quot;Cupid and Psyche&quot; cycle of stories (which later became known as &quot;The Search for the Lost Husband&quot; and &quot;Animal as Bridegroom&quot;).

Bruno Bettelheim notes in &quot;The Uses of Enchantment&quot; that the 18th-century fairy tale &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; is a version of &quot;Cupid and Psyche&quot;. Motifs from Apuleius occur in several fairy tales, including &quot;Cinderella&quot; and &quot;Rumpelstiltskin&quot;, in versions collected by folklorists trained in the classical tradition, such as Charles Perrault and the Grimm brothers. In the Grimm version, Cinderella is given the task of sorting lentils and peas from ash, and is aided by birds just as ants help Psyche in the sorting of grain and legumes imposed on her by Venus. Like Cinderella, Psyche has two envious sisters who compete with her for the most desirable male. Cinderella&#x27;s sisters mutilate their own feet to emulate her, while Psyche&#x27;s are dashed to death on a rocky cliff. In Hans Christian Andersen&#x27;s &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot;, the Little Mermaid is given a dagger by her sisters, who, in an attempt to end all the suffering she endured and to let her become a mermaid again, attempt to persuade her to use it to slay the Prince while he is asleep with his new bride. She cannot bring herself to kill the Prince, however. Unlike Psyche, who becomes immortal, she doesn&#x27;t receive his love in return, but she, nevertheless, ultimately earns the eternal soul she yearns for.

Thomas Bulfinch wrote a shorter adaptation of the Cupid and Psyche tale for his &quot;Age of Fable&quot;, borrowing Tighe&#x27;s invention of Cupid&#x27;s self-wounding, which did not appear in the original. Josephine Preston Peabody wrote a version for children in her &quot;Old Greek Folk Stories Told Anew&quot; (1897).

C. S. Lewis&#x27; &quot;Till We Have Faces&quot; is a retelling of Apuleius&#x27; &quot;Cupid and Psyche&quot; from the perspective of one of Psyche&#x27;s sisters. &quot;Till We Have Faces&quot; is C. S. Lewis&#x27; last work of fiction and elaborates on Apuleius&#x27; story in a modern way.

===Performing arts===
In 1634, Thomas Heywood turned the tale of Cupid and Psyche into a masque for the court of Charles I. Lully&#x27;s &quot;Psyché&quot; (1678) is a Baroque French opera (a &quot;tragédie lyrique&quot;) based on the 1671 play by Molière, which had musical &quot;intermèdes&quot; by Lully. Matthew Locke&#x27;s semi-opera &quot;Psyche&quot; (1675) is a loose reworking from the 1671 production. In 1800, Ludwig Abeille premièred his four-act German opera &quot;(singspiel)&quot; &quot;Amor und Psyche&quot;, with a libretto by based on Apuleius.

In the 19th century, &quot;Cupid and Psyche&quot; was a source for &quot;transformations&quot;, visual interludes involving &quot;tableaux vivants&quot;, transparencies and stage machinery that were presented between the scenes of a pantomime but extraneous to the plot. During the 1890s, when &quot;tableaux vivants&quot; or &quot;living pictures&quot; were in vogue as a part of vaudeville, the 1889 &quot;Psyché et l&#x27;Amour&quot; of Bouguereau was among the artworks staged. To create these &quot;tableaux&quot;, costumed performers &quot;froze&quot; in poses before a background copied meticulously from the original and enlarged within a giant picture frame. Nudity was feigned by flesh-colored bodystockings that negotiated standards of realism, good taste, and morality. Claims of educational and artistic value allowed female nudes—a popular attraction—to evade censorship. &quot;Psyché et l&#x27;Amour&quot; was reproduced by the scenic painter Edouard von Kilanyi, who made a tour of Europe and the United States beginning in 1892, and by George Gordon in an Australian production that began its run in December 1894. The illusion of flight was so difficult to sustain that this &quot;tableau&quot; was necessarily brief. The performer billed as &quot;The Modern Milo&quot; during this period specialized in recreating female sculptures, a &quot;Psyche&quot; in addition to her namesake &quot;Venus de Milo&quot;.

Frederick Ashton choreographed a ballet &quot;Cupid and Psyche&quot; with music by Lord Berners and decor by Sir Francis Rose, first performed on 27 April 1939 by the Sadler&#x27;s Wells Ballet (now Royal Ballet). Frank Staff danced as Cupid, Julia Farron as Psyche, Michael Somes as Pan, and June Brae as Venus.

===Psychology===
Viewed in terms of psychology rather than allegory, the tale of Cupid and Psyche shows how &quot;a mutable person … matures within the social constructs of family and marriage&quot;. In the Jungian allegory of Erich Neumann (1956), the story of Psyche was interpreted as &quot;the psychic development of the feminine&quot;.

&quot;Cupid and Psyche&quot; has been analyzed from a feminist perspective as a paradigm of how the gender unity of women is disintegrated through rivalry and envy, replacing the bonds of sisterhood with an ideal of heterosexual love. This theme was explored in &quot;Psyche&#x27;s Sisters: Reimagining the Meaning of Sisterhood&quot; (1988) by Christine Downing, who uses myth as a medium for psychology.

James Hillman made the story the basis for his critique of scientific psychology, &quot;The Myth of Analysis: Three Essays in Archetypal Psychology&quot; (1983). Carol Gilligan uses the story as the basis for much of her analysis of love and relationships in &quot;The Birth of Pleasure&quot; (Knopf, 2002).

===Fine and decorative arts===
The story of Cupid and Psyche is depicted in a wide range of visual media. Psyche is often represented with butterfly wings, and the butterfly is her frequent attribute and a symbol of the soul, though the literary &quot;Cupid and Psyche&quot; never says that she has or acquires wings. In antiquity, an iconographical tradition existed independently of Apuleius&#x27;s tale and influenced later depictions.

====Ancient art====

Some extant examples suggest that in antiquity Cupid and Psyche could have a religious or mystical meaning. Rings bearing their likeness, several of which come from Roman Britain, may have served an amuletic purpose. Engraved gems from Britain represent spiritual torment with the image of Cupid torching a butterfly. The two are also depicted in high relief in mass-produced Roman domestic plaster wares from the 1st to 2nd centuries AD found in excavations at Greco-Bactrian merchant settlements on the ancient Silk Road at Begram in Afghanistan (see gallery below). The allegorical pairing depicts perfection of human love in integrated embrace of body and soul (&#x27;psyche&#x27; Greek for butterfly symbol for transcendent immortal life after death). On sarcophagi, the couple often seem to represent an allegory of love overcoming death.

A relief of Cupid and Psyche was displayed at the mithraeum of Capua, but it is unclear whether it expresses a Mithraic quest for salvation, or was simply a subject that appealed to an individual for other reasons. Psyche is invoked with &quot;Providence&quot; &quot;(Pronoia)&quot; at the beginning of the so-called Mithras Liturgy.

In late antiquity, the couple are often shown in a &quot;chin-chuck&quot; embrace, a gesture of &quot;erotic communion&quot; with a long history. The rediscovery of freestanding sculptures of the couple influenced several significant works of the modern era.

Other depictions surviving from antiquity include a 2nd-century papyrus illustration possibly of the tale, and a ceiling fresco at Trier executed during the reign of Constantine I.

====Modern era====
Works of art proliferated after the rediscovery of Apuleius&#x27;s text, in conjunction with the influence of classical sculpture. In the mid-15th century, Cupid and Psyche became a popular subject for Italian wedding chests &quot;(cassoni)&quot;, particularly those of the Medici. The choice was most likely prompted by Boccaccio&#x27;s Christianized allegory. The earliest of these &quot;cassoni&quot;, dated variously to the years 1444–1470, pictures the narrative in two parts: from Psyche&#x27;s conception to her abandonment by Cupid; and her wanderings and the happy ending. With the wedding of Peleus and Thetis, the subject was the most common choice for specifying paintings of the Feast of the Gods, which were popular from the Renaissance to Northern Mannerism.

&quot;Cupid and Psyche&quot; is a rich source for scenarios, and several artists have produced cycles of works based on it, including the frescoes at the Villa Farnesina (ca. 1518) by Raphael and his workshop; frescoes at Palazzo del Tè (1527–28) by Giulio Romano (painter)Giulio Romano; engravings by the &quot;Master of the Die&quot; (mid-16th century); and paintings by the Pre-Raphaelite Edward Burne-Jones (in the 1870s–90s). Burne-Jones also executed a series of 47 drawings intended as illustrations for Morris&#x27;s poem. &quot;Cupid and Psyche&quot; was the subject of the only cycle of prints created by the German Symbolist Max Klinger (1857–1920) to illustrate a specific story.

The special interest in the wedding as a subject in Northern Mannerism seems to spring from a large engraving of 1587 by Hendrik Goltzius in Haarlem of a drawing by Bartholomeus Spranger (now Rijksmuseum) that Karel van Mander had brought back from Prague, where Spranger was court painter to Rudolf II. &quot;The Feast of the Gods at the Marriage of Cupid and Psyche&quot; was so large, at 16 7/8 x 33 5/8 in. (43 x 85.4 cm), that it was printed from three different plates. Over 80 figures are shown, placed up in the clouds over a world landscape that can be glimpsed below. The composition borrows from both Raphael and Giulio Romano&#x27;s versions.

The most popular subjects for single paintings or sculpture are the couple alone, or explorations of the figure of Psyche, who is sometimes depicted in compositions that recall the sleeping Ariadne as she was found by Dionysus. The use of nudity or sexuality in portraying Cupid and Psyche sometimes has offended contemporary sensibilities. In the 1840s, the National Academy of Art banned William Page&#x27;s &quot;Cupid and Psyche&quot;, called perhaps &quot;the most erotic painting in nineteenth-century America&quot;. Classical subject matter might be presented in terms of realistic nudity: in 1867, the female figure in the &quot;Cupid and Psyche&quot; of Alphonse Legros was criticized as a &quot;commonplace naked young woman&quot;. But during the same period, Cupid and Psyche were also portrayed chastely, as in the pastoral sculptures &quot;Psyche&quot; (1845) by Townsend and &quot;Cupid and Psyche&quot; (1846) by Thomas Uwins, which were purchased by Queen Victoria and her consort Albert, otherwise keen collectors of nudes in the 1840s and 50s.

Portrayals of Psyche alone are often not confined to illustrating a scene from Apuleius, but may draw on the broader Platonic tradition in which Love was a force that shaped the self. The &quot;Psyche Abandoned&quot; of Jacques-Louis David, probably based on La Fontaine&#x27;s version of the tale, depicts the moment when Psyche, having violated the taboo of looking upon her lover, is abandoned alone on a rock, her nakedness expressing dispossession and the color palette a psychological &quot;divestment&quot;. The work has been seen as an &quot;emotional proxy&quot; for the artist&#x27;s own isolation and desperation during his imprisonment, which resulted from his participation in the French Revolution and association with Robespierre.

<text>Yash Johar (6 September 1929 – 26 June 2004) was an Indian film producer and the founder of Dharma Productions. His films featured lavish sets, were often set in &quot;exotic&quot; locations, and incorporated Indian traditions and family values. He was the father of Karan Johar, now a noted filmmaker himself.

== Personal life ==
Johar was born on 6 September 1929 in Amritsar, Punjab, in a Punjabi Hindu family associated with the Arya Samaj. He was married to Hiroo, sister of filmmakers B. R. Chopra and Yash Chopra. He died on 26 June 2004 in Mumbai, aged 74, of a chest infection, though he had also been fighting cancer. After his death, his son took over Dharma Productions.

== Career ==
Johar began his career as a publicist and still photographer in the early 1950s, working on the film &quot;Baadal&quot; . He worked for Sashadhar Mukherjee&#x27;s production company Filmistan as a production executive on the film &quot;Love in Simla&quot; (1960). In 1962, he joined Sunil Dutt&#x27;s production house Ajanta Arts. He was a production controller for films like &quot;Mujhe Jeene Do&quot; and &quot;Yeh Raaste Hai Pyaar Ke&quot;. He helped filmmaker Dev Anand handle the production of his 1965 film &quot;Guide&quot;, which was successful at the box office. He continued with Dev Anand&#x27;s Navketan Films and handled production of films like &quot;Jewel Thief&quot;, &quot;Prem Pujari&quot; and &quot;Hare Rama Hare Krishna&quot;.

In 1976, Johar launched his own banner, Dharma Productions. The first film produced by the company, &quot;Dostana&quot;, directed by Raj Khosla, was a box office success in 1980. The company produced a handful of other films in the 1980s and early 1990s, most notably &quot;Duniya&quot; (1984), &quot;Agneepath&quot; (1990), &quot;Gumrah&quot; (1993) and &quot;Duplicate&quot; (1998).

He was also an associate producer on the 1994 Hollywood film &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;.

The company found unprecedented success with the 1998 award-winning film &quot;Kuch Kuch Hota Hai&quot;, the directorial debut of his son Karan Johar. The film starring Shah Rukh Khan, Kajol, Rani Mukerji and Salman Khan was one of the biggest hits of the year both domestically and in the overseas market. The film was critically acclaimed as well, winning major awards at Indian award ceremonies. Karan&#x27;s second directorial, &quot;Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham...&quot; in 2001 was also immensely successful.

Johar was also involved in the production and distribution company Dreamz Unlimited founded in 1999 by Shah Rukh Khan, Juhi Chawla and Aziz Mirza. He helped set up the company as well as handling the production process of their first film, &quot;Phir Bhi Dil Hai Hindustani&quot; (2000).

&quot;Kal Ho Naa Ho&quot;, was the last film he was involved in, which was a major critical and commercial success, becoming the top-grossing film domestically and in the overseas market that year.

<doc id="760058" wikidata="Q1143666" url="?curid=760058" title="TD Place Arena">
<text>TD Place Arena, originally the Ottawa Civic Centre, is an indoor arena located in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. Opened in December 1967, it is used primarily for sports, including curling, figure skating, ice hockey, and lacrosse. The arena has hosted Canadian and world championships in figure skating, curling, and ice hockey, including the first women&#x27;s world ice hockey championship in 1990. It is also used for concerts and conventions such as Ottawa SuperEX.

The arena is the home to the Ottawa 67&#x27;s of the Ontario Hockey League (OHL) and the Ottawa Charge of the Professional Women&#x27;s Hockey League (PWHL). It was the home of the Ottawa Senators of the National Hockey League (NHL) from 1992 through 1995, the Ottawa Nationals of the World Hockey Association (WHA) from 1972 to 1973, the Ottawa Civics of the WHA in 1976, and the Ottawa Rebel of the National Lacrosse League (NLL) from 2002 to 2003.

Canadian Prime Ministers Pierre Trudeau, John Turner, Brian Mulroney, and Kim Campbell were elected party leaders during party conferences that were held at TD Place Arena.

==History==
In the 1960s, the City of Ottawa was preparing to rebuild the football stadium at Lansdowne Park, on Bank Street at the Rideau Canal. During the planning phase, the old Ottawa Auditorium arena was demolished and the City now needed two new sports venues. The City combined plans and the arena, named the Civic Centre, was built together under the north grandstand of the football stadium. One side of the arena is located beneath the upper part of the stadium grandstand, with a much lower ceiling than the opposite side of the arena.

Dominion Bridge was the supplier of the huge steel girders for the arena and stadium&#x27;s frame, some so large they had to be brought to the site by barge, up the Ottawa River and down the Rideau Canal. According to Dominion Bridge &quot;the most striking feature of the unique design concept is a giant overhanging roof reaching out 170 degrees from atop eight massive steel A-frames.&quot;

The new Civic Centre opened on December 29, 1967—although seating was not complete—for an exhibition game between the Ottawa 67&#x27;s, boosted by five players from the Montreal Junior Canadiens, and the NHL Montreal Canadiens. Seats were taken temporarily from the Coliseum building nearby. Then President Howard Darwin said about 500 fans had to be turned away at the door. Of the 9,000 who attended the opening game, only six ticket-holders requested and received refunds. The football stadium and arena complex served as the official Canadian Centennial project for the city of Ottawa, as federal government grant money depended on the facility opening within 1967, and construction was rushed to meet the deadline.

It was renovated and seating increased in 1992 in order to temporarily accommodate the Ottawa Senators of the NHL.

The renovation also sealed up constant leaks that had been a problem for the Civic Centre for years. During the 2011–12 season, a 67&#x27;s game had to be rescheduled because of the leaking roof. Midway through the renovation process at the end of 2013, steel corrosion was discovered by workers and cost an extra $17 million to repair. While the arena was renovated, the 67&#x27;s used the Canadian Tire Centre for the 2012–13 and 2013–14 seasons.

==Sports==

===Ice hockey===
The primary tenant since the building&#x27;s opening has been the Ottawa 67&#x27;s junior men&#x27;s team. The arena&#x27;s seating capacity is large by junior standards. The team played before large crowds in the 1960s and 1970s but attendance started to drop in the late &#x27;80s and bottomed out after the arrival of the Ottawa Senators in the early 1990s. In 1998, the team was bought by local businessman Jeff Hunt, and he successfully improved attendance to take advantage of the arena&#x27;s large capacity. Since then, the 67&#x27;s have been one of the top-10 junior teams in Canada in terms of attendance, often finishing first on the list. The club has also been successful on the ice, winning the OHL championship in 1977, 1984, and 2001, and the Memorial Cup championship in 1984 and 1999. The 1972 and 1999 Memorial Cup tournaments were played at the arena, and the 1999 tournament was won by the host 67&#x27;s.

In the 1970s, the arena was home to two WHA teams, the Ottawa Nationals and Ottawa Civics. Neither survived in Ottawa for more than one season. The Nationals played for one regular season, but moved their playoff games to Toronto, and subsequently moved there permanently to become the Toronto Toros. The Civics were the hastily transplanted Denver Spurs franchise that played only two home games in Ottawa before disbanding.

The arena hosted the first-ever Canada Cup hockey game on September 2, 1976, when Canada defeated Finland 11-2. The arena also hosted games for the 1981 Canada Cup.

The arena was the site of the first IIHF Women&#x27;s World Ice Hockey Championships in 1990. Canada defeated the United States 5–2 on March 25, 1990, to win the gold medal.

Starting in 1992, the Ottawa Senators called the arena home for three and a half NHL seasons. In preparation for hosting the NHL, the arena was refurbished, adding additional seating and 32 private boxes.

In 1995, Roller Hockey International&#x27;s Ottawa Loggers (renamed the &quot;Ottawa Wheels&quot; prior to their move to the Corel Centre) brought inline hockey to the arena, though the inline version of the sport proved to be both unprofitable and unpopular in Ottawa.

Beginning in 2024, the arena is the home of the Ottawa Charge. The team&#x27;s first ever game on January 2, 2024, drew 8,318 fans, which set a new attendance record for professional women&#x27;s hockey. In the game, Montreal defeated Ottawa 3–2 in overtime.

In 2008 and 2009, it was used for games of the 2009 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships.

===Figure skating===
The arena&#x27;s unique arrangement of having most of the seats on one side of the ice has been described by Barbara Underhill as making it an ideal venue for figure skating presentations. The arena has hosted the 1978 and 1984 World Figure Skating Championships and the 2003 World Synchronized Skating Championships. The arena has hosted the Canadian Figure Skating Championships in 1987, 1996, 1999, 2006 and 2017.

Both Worlds provided memorable moments in sports. In 1978 Vern Taylor performed the first &#x27;Triple Axel&#x27; jump in competition. In 1984, the Canadian pairs champions Barbara Underhill and Paul Martini won the Championship in dramatic fashion:

&quot;After a disappointing Olympics in Sarajevo, Barbara and Paul seriously contemplated retiring from skating before Worlds&#x27;. However, advised by their friend Brian Orser to put on her old skate boots, Barbara and Paul were propelled onto the ice, onto the podium and into history. Their flawless program is considered one of the great Canadian sporting moments and gave Canada a national thrill.&quot;

===Other sports ===

The arena has played host to several national curling championships; and hosted the 2023 World Men&#x27;s Curling Championship. In men&#x27;s play, the arena hosted the 1979, 1993, 2001, and 2016 Brier men&#x27;s championships. It also hosted the 1990 Scott Tournament of Hearts women&#x27;s championships.

The arena was the home of the Ottawa Rebel of the National Lacrosse League for one and a half seasons.

The World Wrestling Federation used the arena jointly with the Robert Guertin Centre in Gatineau for its shows in Ottawa until The Palladium (Canadian Tire Centre) was built in 1996. From 1992 to 1994, the arena would host the November event on the last Friday of the month, with the March and June events being held at Robert Guertin Arena. It still uses the arena from time to time for house shows.

In June 2016, the arena held a MMA event, hosting &quot;UFC Fight Night: MacDonald vs. Thompson&quot;. This marked the first time a UFC event was held in Ottawa.

===Non-sports usage===
In April 1968, the arena hosted the Liberal Party of Canada leadership convention, when Pierre Trudeau was named Canadian Prime Minister. It also hosted the 1984 Liberal Party leadership convention. The arena also hosted the Progressive Conservative leadership conventions in 1983 and 1993.

Until the mid-2000s, the Central Canada Exhibition, or Ottawa SuperEx, used the arena for concerts and exhibits.

<doc id="760079" wikidata="Q1215095" url="?curid=760079" title="Eye of the Needle (novel)">
<text>Eye of the Needle is a spy thriller novel written by Welsh author Ken Follett. It was originally published in 1978 by the Penguin Group under the title Storm Island. This novel was Follett&#x27;s first successful, best-selling effort as a novelist, and it earned him the 1979 Edgar Award for Best Novel from the Mystery Writers of America. The revised title is an allusion to the &quot;eye of a needle&quot; aphorism.

The book was made into a motion picture of the same title in 1981, starring Donald Sutherland, with a screenplay adapted by Stanley Mann and directed by Richard Marquand.

== Plot summary ==
In 1940, Henry Faber, a German spy nicknamed &#x27;die Nadel&#x27; (&#x27;The Needle&#x27;) due to his trademark weapon being a stiletto, is working at a London railway depot, collecting information on Allied troop movements. Faber is halfway through radioing this information to Berlin when his widowed landlady stumbles into his room hoping for intimacy. Faber fears that Mrs. Garden will eventually realise that he was using a transmitter and that he is a spy, so he kills her with his stiletto, then resumes his transmission.

David, a trainee RAF pilot, and his bride Lucy are on their honeymoon when they&#x27;re involved in a car crash. David loses the use of both his legs. Unable to fly during the Battle of Britain, David grows embittered and he and Lucy retire to the isolated (fictitious) Storm Island off the east coast of Scotland. Lucy later gives birth to their son Jonathan (&#x27;Joe&#x27;), conceived just before the wedding, but their subsequent relationship remains celibate. 
Four years later, MI5 has executed or recruited all German spies in Britain except Faber. A history professor formerly acquainted with Faber, Godliman, and a widowed ex-policeman, Bloggs, are employed by MI5 to catch him. They start with the interrupted broadcast and his codename &quot;Die Nadel&quot;. They connect the landlady&#x27;s murder to Faber by him having used his &#x27;needle&#x27; during the transmission. They then interview Faber&#x27;s fellow tenants from 1940. One identifies Faber from a photo of him as a young army officer.

Faber is ordered by Berlin to investigate the First United States Army Group (FUSAG) military base. He takes photos and discovers it is a dummy and has merely been constructed to look real from the air. Several soldiers try to arrest him but he kills them with his stiletto. Realising that FUSAG being fake implies that the D-Day landings will be in Normandy rather than around Calais, Faber heads for Aberdeen, Scotland, where a U-boat will take him and his intelligence back to Germany.
Godliman and Bloggs realise what Faber is trying to achieve and chase him across Northern England and Scotland. Faber escapes many times but his repeated killings (intended to prevent people from recognizing his appearance) allow MI5 to track him to Aberdeen. Both Hitler and Churchill are informed that Faber has the critical information. German Field Marshalls Rommel and Von Rundstedt, both already convinced that Normandy is indeed the target, lobby Hitler for several reserve panzer divisions, but Hitler delays making a decision until he receives Faber&#x27;s intelligence.

In Aberdeen, Faber steals a small trawler and sets out to meet the U-boat. Caught by a fierce storm, he is shipwrecked on Storm Island, collapsing near the isolated house where David, Lucy and Joe live. Lucy nurses him back to health. Stuck in a loveless marriage to the crippled David, she begins a physical relationship with Faber. David soon discovers both Lucy&#x27;s infidelity and Faber&#x27;s FUSAG photos. David confronts Faber, but after a struggle Faber kills David by rolling him off a cliff, and tells Lucy it was another accident. However, she discovers her husband&#x27;s body and realises the truth.

Faber realises he may be caught before leaving the island and so tries to radio the information about FUSAG directly to Germany. Lucy stops him by short-circuiting the electricity in the cottage, injuring herself in the process. By the cold logic which has guided his actions throughout his career, Faber should kill Lucy, but he finds himself unable to do so, being deeply in love with her to the detriment of his mission and of simple self-preservation. Unable to send a radio message, Faber attempts to descend the cliff and swim to the waiting U-boat. Lucy throws a rock down at him, striking him and causing him to lose his balance and fall to his death. An RAF patrol plane then appears and drives the U-boat away. A fictitious radio message is sent with Faber&#x27;s call code, convincing the Germans that the planned invasion is still targeting Calais and causing Hitler to deny Rommel and Rundstedt the reserve panzer divisions. Bloggs comforts the widowed Lucy, with the epilogue implying that they later married.

== List of characters ==
* Henry Faber – &quot;Die Nadel&quot;, also called The Needle, a German spy
* David Rose – young RAF fighter pilot
* Lucy Rose – David Rose&#x27;s wife
* Billy Parkin – young soldier who identified Faber
* Percival Godliman – history professor, recruited to MI5
* Frederick Bloggs – policeman, seconded to MI5

==Inspiration==
Operation Fortitude was an Allied counter-intelligence operation run during World War II. Its goal was to convince the German military that the planned D-Day landings were to occur at Calais and not Normandy. As a part of Fortitude the fictitious First United States Army Group (FUSAG) was created. FUSAG used fake tanks, aircraft, buildings and radio traffic to create an illusion of an army being formed to land at Calais. The controversial American General George S. Patton was given command of this &#x27;army&#x27; which also influenced the German military. As Follet notes in the foreword to the novel, if the deception had been discovered the invasion of Nazi-occupied Europe would have become more difficult.

== Film reference ==
In the film &quot;The Iron Lady&quot; there is a scene in which the retired Margaret Thatcher is shown reading &quot;Eye of the Needle&quot;.

The Bollywood movie &quot;Fanaa&quot; is loosely based on the book, moved to a contemporary Indian location. The role of the German spy Faber being taken by a Kashmiri separatist militant seeking to gain a nuclear weapon, while the role of Lucy is given to a Kashmiri girl who loves the militant yet ends up killing him.

Another Bollywood movie &quot;Right Yaaa Wrong&quot; is also loosely based on the book.

==Critical reception==

On 5 November 2019 &quot;BBC News&quot; listed &quot;Eye of the Needle&quot; on its list of the 100 most inspiring novels.

<doc id="760134" wikidata="Q1754397" url="?curid=760134" title="Aracati">
<text>Aracati () is a city or municipality in the state of Ceará, in the northeast region of Brazil. The city was officially founded on April 11, 1747. It is part of the microregion of Litoral de Aracati, which is one of the four microregions that make up the macroregion of Jaguaribe. It is the birthplace of the revolutionary Eduardo Angelim, the romanticist Adolfo Caminha, the bishop Manuel do Rego Medeiros, the abolitionist Dragão do Mar, the actor Emiliano Queiroz, the classical pianist Jacques Klein and the writer Yury Teodósio.

The city center of Aracati was named an important historical site in April 2000 by the National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage of Brazil. The city has several colonial-period residences, and churches from the 17th and 18th century. The facades of many residential buildings of Aracati have well-preserved examples of &quot;azulejo&quot;, the blue-white ceramic tiles common in Portuguese colonial architecture.
Aracati receives a significant amount of international tourism for its small size, attracted primarily by the quiet and calm life of the coast. Foreign-born residents can be seen living and working more and more frequently in its famous beach of Canoa Quebrada. The beaches of Majorlândia and Quixaba are also important in the region and also offer services such as bars, restaurants, and hotels.

== History ==
The Potiguara, the original inhabitants of the land which Aracati now occupies, probably first came into contact with Europeans on February 2, 1500, on meeting the Spanish navigator Vicente Yáñez Pinzón. On August 10, 1603, during an expedition against the French who had invaded Maranhão, Pero Coelho de Souza erected a fort, Fortim de São Lourenço, on the banks of the Jaguaribe River. The village of Santa Cruz do Aracati arose around this fort.

The economic growth of Aracati was enabled by the creation of workshops or charqueadas in Ceará, which allowed the state to begin competition in the livestock industry. Aracati became a producer of dried meat and the main export port of this product to the sugarcane regions, in addition to continuing to be an important military centre. The main purpose of the Fortim de São Lourenço was now to protect the port, traders and residents against attacks by Indians such as the Payacu. Workshops for preserving meat and leatherwork already existed in Aracati in 1740. On the strength of this trade, Aracati became the economic, political, and social centre of Ceará. By 1779, Aracati had about two thousand people, five streets, many townhouses, and more than seventy stores. On October 25, 1842, the town was officially elevated to the status of a city by Provincial Law 244.

In 1824, during the uprising of the Confederation of Ecuador, the village of Aracati became the scene of one of the most important events in the history of Northeastern Brazil: Tristão Gonçalves de Alencar Araripe led rebel troops in assaulting and sacking the town, staying there for a week.

Throughout its history, the city suffered from the flooding of the Jaguaribe River, until a flood in 1985, motivated the construction of a dike. Buildings destroyed or damaged in floods tended to be rebuilt some distance from the river, to avoid the odors of the cattle industries; over time, this caused the city as a whole to move away from the river responsible for its emergence.

<doc id="760137" wikidata="Q1370332" url="?curid=760137" title="Yoshiaki Oshima">
<text>(born 1952) is a Japanese astronomer at Gekko Observatory and prolific discoverer of 61 asteroids as credited by the Minor Planet Center, and include the binary asteroid 4383 Suruga, the potentially hazardous object (7753) 1988 XB and the Jupiter trojan 4715 Medesicaste.

== International asteroid monitoring project ==

Japan Spaceguard Association (JSGA) is keen to have astronomical education for young people and held &quot;Spaceguard Private Investigator of the Stars— the fugitives are asteroids!&quot; program in 2001. Yoshiaki Oshima participated as one of the committee member. JSGA submitted a paper on that project in a proceedings, with Oshima as a contributor.
JSGA held an astronomical education program as part of their International Asteroid Monitoring Project, that collaborated with the British Council and its International Schools&#x27; Observatory (ISO) program which had involved 12 teams of junior high to senior high school classes from Asian and European countries.

The Private Investigator of Stars was co-sponsored by the British Council which advised the International Asteroid Monitoring Project by coordinating observatory in the Canary islands and participating laboratories for ISO. Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper held an asteroid hunting contest for the JSGA and run articles on their pages. 438 school classes and other teams signed up with 1,317 indibivisuals, and 133 teams reported the results of their observation.

JSGA based its project headquarters in its observatory called Bisei Spaceguard Center, owned by the Japan Space Forum. An optical telescope on the Canary island has been operated by the staff of Astrophysics Research Institute at John Moore University in Liverpool, and images were transmitted to each classroom via internet connection.

== Honors ==

The outer main-belt asteroid 5592 Oshima is named after him. The naming citation also mentions his contribution to the development of the instrumentation at the Nihondaira Observatory.

== List of discovered minor planets ==
In 1988, Oshima discovered (7753) 1988 XB, a near-Earth object and potentially hazardous asteroid that approaches the orbit of Earth as close as 2.5 lunar distances. He also discovered 4715 Medesicaste, a 64-kilometer sized Jupiter trojan in 1989. By the end of the same year, he discovered 4383 Suruga a binary with a minor-planet moon. All discoveries he made at the Gekko Observatory &quot;(see table below)&quot;.

<text>BankSA, formerly known as the Bank of South Australia, the State Bank of South Australia and the Savings Bank of South Australia is the largest bank in South Australia. It is a subsidiary of Westpac.

==History==
The Savings Bank of South Australia was established in the colony of South Australia on 11 March 1848 by sole employee John Hector.The first deposit comprised the life savings of an Afghan shepherd. The first premier of the colony, B. T. Finniss, was a trustee of the bank&#x27;s inaugural board, and F. H. Robe, Lieutenant Governor of the colony, was president of the bank. 

The Savings Bank of South Australia later merged with the former State Bank of South Australia (established 1896), becoming the new State Bank, owned by the Government of South Australia, in 1984.

The State Bank of South Australia was compartmentalised and bought by The Advance Bank due to deteriorating loan book and financial management. Prior to a bailout by the Government of South Australis, the Savings Bank was on the verge of collapse, which was hastened by the 1991 Royal Commission into The Organisation Of Public State Funds of South Australia. Advance Bank was purchased by St. George Bank in 1997 and the State Bank became part of the greater Westpac Corporation after the merger with St. George Bank.

==Today==
BankSA is a wholly owned entity of St George Bank, which is owned by the Westpac Banking Corporation. Westpac is a publicly listed ASX private company with an Australian Financial Services Licence (AFSL). Both BankSA and Westpac are a part of the Australian Prudential Banking Deposit Scheme, which gives government assurances of all deposits placed into the bank in the event of financial crises.

== Technology and digital banking==
Westpac and synonymously BankSA launched online banking services via internet and smartphone application on 5 December 2015.

==Adelaide Fringe partnership==
In November 2005, the State Bank began its sponsorship of Australia&#x27;s biggest arts festival, the Adelaide Fringe, with a partnership until 2010. This sponsorship was renewed, and BankSA was the Fringe&#x27;s principal partner until 2022.

==Further local alliances==
BankSA is a private company that also extends its banking services to government and public institutions, and fellow private businesses, including the entities listed below:
* Law Society of South Australia 
* Country Fire Service Volunteers&#x27; Association 
* Australian Medical Association 
* Port Adelaide Football Club 
*Local South Australian accounting, financial planning, legal and real estate firms 

==Implications in Royal Commissions==
BankSA has not been the subject of Royal Commission findings; however, it did have an indirect history in two separate Royal Commissions. The 1991 Royal Commission in South Australia determined that the State Bank of South Australia had an underperforming loan book due to weak lending rules and operational inefficiencies, which led to a government bailout. As a result, the State Bank of South Australia had to separate and sell off the profitable part of its bank to Advance Bank, which was acquired by Westpac in 2008.

Westpac, was implicated in the Banking Royal Commission of 2017 and was ordered to pay the largest penalty of $1.3 billion for money laundering. BankSA was not directly implicated in any penalty or criminal action.

<text>Rachel Anne McAdams (born November 17, 1978) is a Canadian actress. After graduating from a theatre degree program at York University in 2001, she worked in Canadian television and film productions, such as the drama film &quot;Perfect Pie&quot; (2002), for which she received a Genie Award nomination, the comedy film &quot;My Name Is Tanino&quot; (2002), and the comedy series &quot;Slings &amp; Arrows&quot; (2003–2005), for which she won a Gemini Award.

In 2002, she made her Hollywood film debut in the comedy &quot;The Hot Chick&quot;. She rose to fame in 2004 with the comedy &quot;Mean Girls&quot; and the romantic drama &quot;The Notebook&quot;. In 2005, she starred in the romantic comedy &quot;Wedding Crashers&quot;, the psychological thriller &quot;Red Eye&quot;, and the comedy-drama &quot;The Family Stone&quot;. She was hailed by the media as Hollywood&#x27;s new &quot;it girl&quot;, and received a BAFTA Award nomination for Best Rising Star.

After a hiatus, McAdams gained further prominence starring in the films &quot;The Time Traveler&#x27;s Wife&quot; (2009), &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; (2009), &quot;Morning Glory&quot; (2010), &quot;Midnight in Paris&quot; (2011), &quot;The Vow&quot; (2012), and &quot;About Time&quot; (2013).

She made her Broadway debut in the Amy Herzog play &quot;Mary Jane&quot; (2024) for which she was nominated for a Tony Award.

==Early life and education==
Rachel Anne McAdams was born on November 17, 1978, in London, Ontario, Canada, to nurse Sandra ( Gale) and truck driver Lance McAdams. She grew up in St. Thomas in a Protestant household. The eldest of three children, she has a younger sister who is a make-up artist and a younger brother who is a personal trainer. McAdams is of Scottish, English, Irish and Welsh descent. Her maternal fifth great-grandfather, James Gray, fought as a Loyalist Ranger during the American Revolution and fled to Upper Canada after the Battles of Saratoga.

McAdams began figure skating when she was four, but turned down an opportunity to move to Toronto when she was nine for pair skating training. She skated competitively until she was 18, winning regional awards. She has said that skating prepared her for acting by teaching her to be &quot;in tune&quot; with her body.

McAdams attended Myrtle Street Public School and Central Elgin Collegiate Institute. She said that she did not enjoy academic work and often pretended to be sick to avoid going to school. Nonetheless, she was active in student life. In addition to playing sports (including volleyball, badminton, and soccer), she was on the student council, participated in the Crime Stoppers program, and was a member of the Peer Helping Team. She worked at a McDonald&#x27;s restaurant during summer holidays for three years.

She developed an interest in performing when she was seven, and while her parents did not discourage her, they did not &quot;go out and find me an agent.&quot; She attended Disney and William Shakespeare summer camps as a child. From age 12, she participated in Original Kids Theatre Company, London productions, and in her late teens directed children&#x27;s theatre productions. She was also involved in school stage productions, and won a performance award at the Sears Ontario Drama Festival. She was inspired by two of her teachers, who taught her English and drama, respectively, in grades 11 and 12. She intended to take cultural studies at the University of Western Ontario before being persuaded by her drama teacher that a professional acting career was a viable option.

She enrolled in York University&#x27;s four-year theatre program and graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts honours degree in 2001. While there, she worked with the Toronto-based Necessary Angel Theatre Company.

==Career==
===2001–2003: Early work===
In 2001, McAdams made her television debut in the MTV pilot &quot;Shotgun Love Dolls&quot; as Beth Swanson, which was filmed during March break from York University. She also made her Canadian film debut that year in the comedy &quot;My Name Is Tanino&quot;. The Italian-Canadian co-production was filmed in Sicily when McAdams was 22 years old, and it marked her first time on an airplane. McAdams later earned a Genie Award nomination in Canada for her role in the drama &quot;Perfect Pie&quot;.

In 2002, she made her Hollywood film debut with Rob Schneider and Anna Faris in the comedy &quot;The Hot Chick&quot;, which McAdams has described as a &quot;huge milestone&quot; in her career. She played a catty high school student who swaps bodies with Schneider&#x27;s character, a small-time criminal. Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; felt she &quot;emerges as a young actress of much promise&quot;. Afterwards, McAdams returned to Canada to star as Kate McNab in &quot;Slings and Arrows&quot;, a comedy mini-series about backstage theatre life at the fictional New Burbage Shakespearean Festival. She was written out of the second season of the program following her success in the United States. She received two Gemini Award nominations for her work on the program, winning one.

===2004–2005: Breakthrough===
McAdams&#x27;s break-out role came in 2004, when she starred in the comedy film &quot;Mean Girls&quot; opposite Lindsay Lohan, Lacey Chabert, and Amanda Seyfried, based on Rosalind Wiseman&#x27;s book &quot;Queen Bees and Wannabes&quot;. McAdams was 24 years old when she was cast as the mean high school queen bee Regina George, and she modelled her character on Alec Baldwin&#x27;s performance in the drama &quot;Glengarry Glen Ross&quot; (1992). Mike Clark of &quot;USA Today&quot; praised her &quot;comic flair&quot; while Jenny McCartney of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; found her &quot;delightfully hateful.&quot; Mick LaSalle of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; felt that &quot;McAdams brings glamour and magnetism to Regina, but also the right hint of comic distance.&quot; The film grossed $129million worldwide and earned McAdams two MTV Movie Awards. &quot;Mean Girls&quot; later reached No. 12 in an &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; list of the Greatest Ever High School Movies. Tina Fey, who co‑starred in the film and wrote the screenplay, has credited McAdams with teaching her how to act in front of a camera rather than an audience: &quot;She&#x27;s a film actor. She&#x27;s not pushing. And so I kind of learned that lesson from watching her.&quot;

Later in 2004, McAdams starred opposite fellow Canadian Ryan Gosling in the romantic drama &quot;The Notebook&quot;, based on Nicholas Sparks&#x27; novel of the same name. She played Allie Hamilton, a wealthy Southern belle who has a forbidden love affair with Gosling&#x27;s poor labourer, Noah Calhoun. McAdams spent time in Charleston, South Carolina, prior to filming to familiarize herself with the Southern accent, and took ballet and etiquette classes. Filming took place from late 2002 to early 2003. Although McAdams and Gosling became romantically involved in 2005, they had a combative relationship on set. &quot;We inspired the worst in each other,&quot; Gosling has said. &quot;It was a strange experience, making a love story and not getting along with your co-star in any way.&quot; At one point, Gosling asked the film&#x27;s director Nick Cassavetes to &quot;bring somebody else in for my off-camera shot&quot; because he felt McAdams was being uncooperative. Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised the &quot;spontaneous and combustible&quot; performances of the two leads while Roger Ebert was won over by the &quot;beauty and clarity&quot; of McAdams&#x27;s performance. Michael Wilmington of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; declared her &quot;a real discovery&quot; who &quot;infuses young Allie with that radiant, breathlessly winning ingénue grace and charm that breaks hearts&quot;. The film grossed over $115million worldwide. McAdams won an MTV Movie Award and four Teen Choice Awards. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; has said that the movie contains the All-Time Best Movie Kiss while the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; has included a scene from the film in a list of the 50 Classic Movie Kisses. &quot;The Notebook&quot; has appeared on many Most Romantic Movies lists. &quot;I&#x27;m so grateful to have a film that people respond to in that way&quot;, McAdams told &quot;Elle&quot; in 2011. &quot;It was a big deal.&quot;

In 2005, McAdams starred with Owen Wilson, Vince Vaughn, and Bradley Cooper in the romantic comedy &quot;Wedding Crashers&quot;. McAdams played a daughter of an influential politician, who is caught in a love triangle with Wilson and Cooper&#x27;s characters. McAdams listened repeatedly to Fleetwood Mac&#x27;s 1975 song &quot;Landslide&quot; to prepare for emotional scenes, and Wilson has said the song made her cry immediately: &quot;It was like turning on a faucet.&quot; She trained for a sailing certification for a boating sequence because her character was said to be an accomplished sailor. Manohla Dargis of &quot;The New York Times&quot; felt McAdams &quot;makes the most of her underdeveloped character&quot; and &quot;grows more appealing with every new role&quot;. Brian Lowry of &quot;Variety&quot; found her &quot;a beguiling presence&quot; who &quot;actually creates a real character – a rarity for females in one of these lad-mag escapades&quot;. From a production budget of $40million, the film grossed over $285million worldwide.

Afterwards, McAdams starred opposite Cillian Murphy in Wes Craven&#x27;s psychological thriller &quot;Red Eye&quot;, where she played a young hotel manager who is held captive by Murphy&#x27;s character while aboard a red-eye flight. Craven has said McAdams was the only actress he considered for the part. She was drawn to the relatable qualities of her character: &quot;She was not some sweaty, tank-top-wearing, Uzi-carrying super woman&quot;. Robert Koehler of &quot;Variety&quot; found her &quot;increasingly impressive&quot; while Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; asserted that &quot;she brings more presence and credibility to her role than is really expected; she acts without betraying the slightest awareness that she&#x27;s inside a genre. Her performance qualifies her for heavy-duty roles.&quot; Upon release, the film, which was made on a budget of $26million, earned over $95million at the worldwide box office. In late 2005, McAdams starred with Sarah Jessica Parker and Diane Keaton in the seasonal family comedy-drama &quot;The Family Stone&quot;, which gave McAdams an opportunity to play a dishevelled and sardonic sister, rather than the usual &quot;obvious&quot; girlfriend or wife roles. She was eager to work with Keaton and remarked, &quot;It&#x27;s never about line counts for me. It&#x27;s about the people I get to work with.&quot; Justin Chang of &quot;Variety&quot; noted that &quot;a deglammed but still radiant McAdams proves once again that she&#x27;s the real deal, delivering a deliciously feisty performance&quot;. Manohla Dargis of &quot;The New York Times&quot; felt that her &quot;engaging screen presence holds your attention and sympathy despite the handicap presented by her character&#x27;s personality.&quot; The film was a commercial success: it cost $18million to make and grossed over $92million worldwide.

===2006–2010: Career hiatus and return===
At this point in her career, McAdams was hailed as &quot;the next Julia Roberts&quot; and the new &quot;Hollywood it girl&quot;. &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; invited McAdams, along with actresses Scarlett Johansson and Keira Knightley, to appear on its March 2006 cover, the annual Hollywood issue. Upon arrival on the photo set, McAdams discovered it was a nude session, declined and left. She later parted ways with her publicist at the time, who had not informed her in advance. Knightley later recounted, &quot;Quite early on Rachel just said, &#x27;No, I&#x27;m not into that.&#x27; She&#x27;s a lovely girl, and I really respect her for doing that.&quot; When asked about the incident in 2008, McAdams had &quot;no regrets&quot;. McAdams took a break from her film career from 2006 to 2007. &quot;There were a lot of cooks in the kitchen, a lot of voices around me, and I wanted to step away so I could hear my own voice again&quot;, McAdams said in 2013. &quot;Truthfully, I never really wanted to be a big movie star. I never even wanted to work outside of Canada, or outside of the theatre.&quot; During that period, McAdams turned down roles in the films &quot;The Devil Wears Prada&quot; (2006), &quot;Casino Royale&quot; (2006), &quot;&quot; (2006), &quot;Iron Man&quot; (2008), and &quot;Get Smart&quot; (2008). In February 2006, she made a one-off stage appearance in &quot;The Vagina Monologues&quot; at St. Lawrence Centre for the Arts, Toronto to raise funds for V-Day. That same year, McAdams received a Rising Star Award nomination from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts and hosted the Academy Awards for Technical Achievement.

McAdams returned to her film career in 2008. She starred with Pierce Brosnan and Chris Cooper in the 1940s film noir &quot;Married Life&quot; where she played Kay Nesbitt, a young widow who wins the affections of Brosnan and Cooper&#x27;s older characters. In preparation for the role, McAdams studied old films, particularly those of Kim Novak. She has said the film shoot re-energized and re-inspired her and made her eager to continue working more often again. Lisa Schwarzbaum of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; found McAdams &quot;a particularly delightful vision after her two-year intermission&quot;. Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; criticized her break from the big screen but felt that, despite a performance of &quot;tender feeling&quot;, &quot;her natural vivaciousness and spontaneity are straitjacketed&quot; by the film noir format. The film had a limited release and was a box-office failure. It grossed just over $2million worldwide, failing to recoup its production budget of $12million.

Afterwards, McAdams starred with Tim Robbins and Michael Peña in the road trip comedy-drama &quot;The Lucky Ones&quot;, a story about three Iraq War soldiers on a brief road trip back in the United States. She trained at a real boot camp, at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, prior to filming. In 2011, McAdams said that Colee Dunn was &quot;probably one of my favorite characters I&#x27;ve ever played&quot;. The film also had a limited release and Laura Kern of &quot;The New York Times&quot; found her &quot;luminous as always&quot; while Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; hailed the performance as &quot;her coming of age as an actress&quot;. &quot;Previously she has been seen mostly as a hot chick or an idealized sweetheart&quot;, he wrote. &quot;Here she is feisty, vulnerable, plucky, warm, funny ... Watch the poignancy of the scene when she meets her boyfriend&#x27;s family.&quot; Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; found her &quot;feisty, gorgeous, and as mercurial as a mood ring&quot;. &quot;The Lucky Ones&quot; is the least commercially successful film of McAdams&#x27;s career as of 2012, having grossed just $266,967 worldwide.

In 2009, McAdams starred with Russell Crowe, Helen Mirren and Ben Affleck in the political thriller &quot;State of Play&quot;, based on the BBC drama television series of the same name. McAdams played Della Frye, an online reporter who investigates a possible conspiracy with Crowe&#x27;s character, a veteran print journalist. McAdams visited &quot;The Washington Post&quot;″s offices and met with politicians on Capitol Hill for her research. Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; felt she was &quot;perfectly cast as an ambitious wonkette&quot; while Sukhdev Sandhu of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; noted that &quot;McAdams, with her lively eyes and large, expressive forehead, holds her own against Crowe. Mercifully, she avoids any temptation to play girly and demure to his grizzled alpha male.&quot; The film grossed over $87million worldwide. Also in 2009, McAdams starred opposite Eric Bana in the science fiction romantic drama &quot;The Time Traveler&#x27;s Wife&quot;, based on Audrey Niffenegger&#x27;s best-selling novel of the same name. McAdams fell &quot;madly in love&quot; with the novel, but was initially slightly hesitant to accept the role because she felt Clare Abshire, the long-suffering wife, was a &quot;character that people have already cast in their heads&quot;. Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; said, &quot;I&#x27;d watch the vibrant Rachel McAdams and Eric Bana in anything, but &quot;The Time Traveler&#x27;s Wife&quot; is pushing it.&quot; Betsy Sharkey of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; found her &quot;luminous [yet], sadly, her facility as an actress is mostly wasted.&quot; Writing in &quot;The Chicago Tribune&quot;, Michael Phillips, in an otherwise tepid review, said of her performance: &quot;Every scene she&#x27;s in, even the silly ones, becomes better—truer, often against long odds—because she&#x27;s in it. Her work feels emotionally spontaneous yet technically precise. She has an unusually easy touch with both comedy and drama, and she never holds a melodramatic moment hostage.&quot; The film was a commercial success, earning over $101million worldwide.

In late 2009, McAdams starred in the mystery/action-adventure film &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; with Robert Downey, Jr. and Jude Law. She played Irene Adler, an antagonist and love interest of Downey&#x27;s title character Sherlock Holmes, and welcomed the opportunity to play a character who is &quot;her own boss and a real free spirit&quot;. Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; felt her character was &quot;not very well integrated into the rest of the story, a shortcoming the normally resourceful McAdams is unable to do much about&quot;. A. O. Scott of &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated, &quot;Ms.McAdams is a perfectly charming actress and performs gamely as the third wheel of this action-bromance tricycle. But Irene feels in this movie more like a somewhat cynical commercial contrivance. She offers a little something for the ladies and also something for the lads, who, much as they may dig fights and explosions and guns and chases, also like girls.&quot; The film was a major commercial success, earning over $524million at the worldwide box office.

In 2010, McAdams starred with her &quot;The Family Stone&quot; co-star Diane Keaton and Harrison Ford in the comedy &quot;Morning Glory&quot;. She played a television producer attempting to improve the poor ratings of a morning television program. The film was billed as a starring vehicle for McAdams. She initially felt she was unsuited to the role saying, &quot;I&#x27;m not funny. So I said, &#x27;if you need me to be funny, you might want to look somewhere else&#x27;&quot;. The film&#x27;s director Roger Michell had a number of dinners with McAdams and persuaded her to join the cast. Since working with Keaton, McAdams has described her as a mentor figure. Kenneth Turan of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; said McAdams &quot;gives the kind of performance we go to the movies for&quot; while Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; felt she played &quot;as lovable a lead as anyone since Amy Adams in &quot;Junebug&quot;&quot; in an otherwise &quot;routine&quot; movie. &quot;Variety&quot;″s Andrew Barker was impressed by her gift for physical comedy. While Manohla Dargis of &quot;The New York Times&quot; felt she &quot;plays her role exceptionally well&quot; and is &quot;effortlessly likable&quot;, it called on Hollywood to give her parts &quot;worthy&quot; of her talent. &quot;Ms.McAdams has to rely on her dimples to get by. She does, but she could do better.&quot; The film was a modest commercial success, grossing $58million worldwide from a production budget of $40million. McAdams later expressed her disappointment that the film failed to find a larger audience.

===2011–2014: Work with auteurs===
In 2011, McAdams starred in Woody Allen&#x27;s fantasy romantic comedy &quot;Midnight in Paris&quot; with her &quot;Wedding Crashers&quot; co-star Owen Wilson and Michael Sheen. The film opened the 2011 Cannes Film Festival. McAdams played Inez, the shrewish fiancée of Wilson&#x27;s character Gil. Allen wrote McAdams&#x27; part for her, after hearing &quot;glowing reports&quot; from his friend and her former co-star Diane Keaton. He said that he was &quot;crazy about Rachel&quot; and wanted to give her the opportunity to play something other than &quot;beautiful girls&quot;. The film was shot on location in Paris and McAdams has said that the experience &quot;will always have a great place in my heart&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&quot; criticized that she &quot;has morphed from the sweet thing in &quot;Wedding Crashers&quot; to the dream-crushing bitch that, according to American comedies, women become once they ensnare their man&quot;. Richard Corliss of &quot;Time&quot; &quot;felt sorry for McAdams, whose usually winning presence is ground into hostile cliché&quot;. However, Kenneth Turan of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; felt she &quot;deftly handles a part that is less amiable than usual for her&quot; and A. O. Scott of &quot;The New York Times&quot; found her &quot;superbly speeded-up&quot;. It became Allen&#x27;s highest-grossing film ever in North America and was the most commercially successful independent film of 2011. With a production budget of $17million, the film has grossed over $151million worldwide. McAdams, along with six other members of the cast, received a Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture nomination. Allen won the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay and the film itself was nominated for three other Academy Awards, including Best Picture.

McAdams reprised her role as Irene Adler in the mystery/action-adventure sequel &quot;Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows&quot;, but the female lead role was played by Noomi Rapace. Joel Silver, the film&#x27;s producer, has said that &quot;we always intended to have a different kind of girl for each movie&quot; in the vein of Bond girls. He found it &quot;complicated&quot; to persuade McAdams to return in a smaller role: &quot;She loved being with us, but she hoped to have a bigger role.&quot; Joe Morgenstern of &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; felt &quot;she vanishes all too soon in this overproduced, self-enchanted sequel, and so does the spirit of bright invention that made the previous film such a pleasant surprise.&quot; Scott Mendelson of &quot;The Huffington Post&quot; remarked that she &quot;exhibits far more personality and roguish charm in her few moments here than she did in all of the previous film. Freed from the constraints of being the de-facto love interest, McAdams relishes the chance to go full-villain.&quot; The film has grossed over $543million worldwide.

In 2012, McAdams starred opposite Channing Tatum in the romantic drama &quot;The Vow&quot;, based on a true story. McAdams and Tatum played a newlywed couple who try to rebuild their relationship after a car crash leaves the wife with no recollections of who he is or their marriage. McAdams was drawn to the &quot;roller coaster&quot; faced by her character and found it interesting that the story was told &quot;through the guy&#x27;s eyes&quot;. A. O. Scott of &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated that &quot;the dimply and adorable Rachel McAdams&quot; brings &quot;enough physical charm and emotional warmth to distract from the threadbare setting and the paper-thin plot&quot;. Joseph Amodio of &quot;Newsday&quot; felt that McAdams, &quot;exuding her usual uncanny warmth on-screen&quot;, &quot;is the real draw&quot;. However, Betsy Sharkey of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; felt she was &quot;wasted&quot; in the role: &quot;She is such an appealing actress that it&#x27;s hard not to wish someone could make better use&quot; of her. Mary Pols of &quot;Time&quot; found the film an example of McAdams &quot;coasting&quot; in &quot;unabashedly romantic&quot; movies and asserted that &quot;she&#x27;s a much more versatile and clever actress&quot; than such projects would suggest. The film, financed for $30million, was a major commercial success and became her biggest box-office hit in a leading role. It topped the U.S. box office and has grossed over $196million worldwide.

In 2013, McAdams co-starred opposite Ben Affleck in Terrence Malick&#x27;s romantic drama &quot;To the Wonder&quot;. McAdams played a horse ranch worker in Oklahoma and the love interest of Affleck&#x27;s character. She found Malick to be an &quot;incredibly helpful&quot; director; they discussed her character in detail and he took her on a tour of the local town, pointing out which house she would have grown up in and where she would have attended school. Upon its limited theatrical American release, the film polarized film critics. Oliver Lyttelton of &quot;IndieWire&quot; noted that &quot;McAdams has the least to do of the principals, but is wonderfully haunted and sad in her brief appearances&quot;. Afterwards, McAdams starred in Brian De Palma&#x27;s erotic thriller &quot;Passion&quot; opposite Noomi Rapace. They played two business executives engaged in a power struggle. De Palma saw McAdams&#x27; performance in &quot;Mean Girls&quot; and decided to cast her as Christine. The movie was released in selected theatres in the US. Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; noted that McAdams &quot;uses her sexy billboard smile and emphatic delivery to nail a certain type of troublemaker boss who embeds her aggression in pert &#x27;sincerity&#x27;&quot; while Robert Abele of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; remarked: &quot;McAdams and Rapace are gesturally awkward and wildly miscast—more sorority sisters in a spat than cross-generational power antagonists.&quot;

In 2013, McAdams starred in Richard Curtis&#x27; romantic comedy-drama &quot;About Time&quot; opposite Domhnall Gleeson. Zooey Deschanel was originally slated to play McAdams&#x27;s role but dropped out shortly before filming began. A fan of Curtis for years, McAdams wanted to work with him on what he stated would be his last project as a director. The film was a commercial success at the international box office, and McAdams had a positive reception among critics, with Leslie Felperin of &quot;Variety&quot; praising her and Gleeson for their &quot;radiant, believable chemistry&quot; which &quot;keeps the film aloft.&quot; The following year, McAdams starred opposite Philip Seymour Hoffman in an adaptation of John le Carré&#x27;s espionage thriller &quot;A Most Wanted Man&quot;, directed by Anton Corbijn. McAdams&#x27; attempt at a German accent was criticised by some reviewers. Richard Lawson of &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; noted that McAdams had a &quot;little less success with her accent&quot; than her co-star Hoffman but, nonetheless, she &quot;proves as intelligent, soulful, and magnetic a presence as ever&quot;. In late 2014, McAdams received a star on Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame.

===2015–2018: &quot;Spotlight&quot; and beyond===
In 2015, McAdams starred with Michael Keaton, Mark Ruffalo and Stanley Tucci as journalist Sacha Pfeiffer in Tom McCarthy&#x27;s &quot;Spotlight&quot;, a drama about the child-abuse scandal in Boston&#x27;s Catholic Church. To prepare for her role, McAdams spent time with Pfeiffer. The film garnered critical acclaim and won the Academy Award for Best Picture. Though Justin Chang of &quot;Variety&quot; felt McAdams imbued her character with &quot;sensitivity and grit&quot;, he was nonetheless surprised by her subsequent Academy Award nomination: &quot;[The performance] has the sort of fine-grained subtlety that voters too rarely notice. Take another look at that scene in which she gently, skillfully encourages an abuse survivor to lay bare his most lacerating secrets—a small master class in how the simple act of listening can become a conduit for compassion.&quot; For her role, McAdams received nominations for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, Critics&#x27; Choice Movie Award for Best Supporting Actress and Screen Actors Guild Award nominations in the categories of Outstanding Actress in a Supporting Role and Outstanding Cast in a Motion Picture.

She next starred with her &quot;Wedding Crashers&quot; co-star Bradley Cooper, Emma Stone and John Krasinski in Cameron Crowe&#x27;s romantic comedy-drama &quot;Aloha&quot;. She played the ex-girlfriend of Cooper&#x27;s character, who is married to Krasinski&#x27;s character with two children. While the film received a negative reaction and controversy from critics and audiences alike, Wesley Morris of &quot;Grantland&quot; remarked: &quot;Someone who can speak Crowe&#x27;s language really helps. McAdams might be the best he&#x27;s ever had ... [She] puts the perfect amount of air in her lines, giving the words a lightness that conflates optimism, amusement, and resignation. She&#x27;s never seemed lovelier, more instinctive, or more present.&quot; Mark Olsen of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; felt she &quot;plays likely the strongest, most rounded female character Crowe has ever written, a woman suddenly lips to lips with the life she has and the one she might have had, and the actress brings a grounded, unforced earthiness to the role that is a joy to watch.&quot;

She co-starred with Jake Gyllenhaal in the boxing drama &quot;Southpaw&quot; (2015), where she played the wife of Gyllenhaal&#x27;s character. A.O. Scott of &quot;The New York Times&quot; conceded: &quot;It features some pretty appealing players. There are worse things to see at the multiplex than Ms. McAdams playing a tough cookie standing by her man.&quot; She co-starred with James Franco, Charlotte Gainsbourg and Marie-Josée Croze in Wim Wenders&#x27; drama &quot;Every Thing Will Be Fine&quot;. The film received a U.S. limited release in December 2015. Guy Lodge of &quot;Variety&quot; remarked: &quot;Poor McAdams, sporting sensible hair and a truly mystifying cod-Continental accent, continues her thankless run of needy, tossed-aside love interests in big-name auteur projects.&quot; That same year, McAdams returned to television and starred as Det. Ani Bezzerides in the second season of HBO&#x27;s anthology crime drama &quot;True Detective&quot; with her &quot;Wedding Crashers&quot; co-star Vince Vaughn, Colin Farrell and Taylor Kitsch. Richard Vine of &quot;The Guardian&quot; remarked: &quot;If there&#x27;s anyone with any chance of enjoying a McConaughaissance here it&#x27;s probably McAdams – an actor whose characters are more usually associated with the death of the romcom than murders involving people with eyes burned out by acid. Here, her Ani is a convincing mess.&quot; She received a nomination for the Critics&#x27; Choice Television Award for Best Actress in a Movie/Miniseries for her role. Also in 2015, McAdams played Buttercup in a one-off, staged LACMA Live Read of &quot;The Princess Bride&quot;.

The following year, McAdams voiced The Mother of The Little Girl in an animated version of &quot;The Little Prince&quot;, and co-starred with Benedict Cumberbatch in the Marvel Cinematic Universe superhero film &quot;Doctor Strange&quot;. Peter Debruge of &quot;Variety&quot; said McAdams played &quot;the most competent—and human—of Marvel&#x27;s window-dressing girlfriends,&quot; while Gregory Ellwood of &quot;Indiewire&quot; remarked: &quot;It goes without saying that McAdams will never get the credit she deserves for transforming the barely sketched out role of Strange&#x27;s former medical colleague Christine Palmer into a captivating three-dimensional character that feels like an integral part of the storyline even when she isn&#x27;t.&quot; Also in 2016, McAdams narrated an audiobook version of L. M. Montgomery&#x27;s novel &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot;, released by Audible.

After a year-long absence from the screen, McAdams co-starred with Jason Bateman in the comedy &quot;Game Night&quot; (2018). Glenn Kenny of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said the film served as a &quot;reminder that Ms. McAdams is one of cinema&#x27;s most accomplished and appealing comic actresses.&quot; Richard Lawson of &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; felt her character lacked &quot;any real arc or motivation of her own&quot;, but &quot;It&#x27;s a testament to McAdams&#x27;s talent and charm, then, that she doesn&#x27;t get lost in the movie, asserting herself in every scene with a goofy brightness.&quot; She performed some of her own stunt driving in a getaway scene. Later in 2018, McAdams starred opposite Rachel Weisz in Sebastián Lelio&#x27;s romantic drama &quot;Disobedience&quot;, based on Naomi Alderman&#x27;s novel. Manohla Dargis of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said McAdams &quot;does some lovely work here to convey a woman agonizing over her existential situation&quot;.

===2020–present ===
In 2020, she co-starred with Will Ferrell in the Netflix musical comedy film &quot;Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga&quot;. McAdams reprised the role of Christine Palmer in the superhero sequel &quot;Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness&quot;. Released in May 2022, it garnered mixed reviews. McAdams starred in &quot;Are You There God? It&#x27;s Me, Margaret.&quot;, a film adaptation of Judy Blume&#x27;s novel of the same name. The film was released in April 2023 to positive reviews. &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;″s Richard Lawson wrote in his review that McAdams &quot;deftly paints a thorough and compelling picture of a woman of the era&quot; in her portrayal of the titular Margaret&#x27;s mother, Barbara.

McAdams appeared as a cameo guest on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in January 2024, introducing Reneé Rapp as musical guest and appeared as a look-a-like of herself in a comedy sketch where the look-a-like asked Jacob Elordi for acting advice. McAdams made her Broadway debut in 2024, starring in Amy Herzog&#x27;s play &quot;Mary Jane&quot; at the Samuel J. Friedman Theatre. Performances started April 2 with opening night set for April 23, 2024. Adrian Holden of &quot;The Guardian&quot; described her performance as &quot;magnetic&quot;, adding, &quot;The role of Mary Jane ... is a perfect fit for McAdams&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; noted that McAdams&#x27; &quot;projection was muted at a recent performance&quot; but added &quot;[She] masters her portrayal of a determined caregiver continually sitting in the uncertainty of worry, despite constantly leaning toward positivity.&quot; For her performance, she earned a Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play nomination.

==Activism==

===Environmental activism===
McAdams is an environmentalist. She ran an eco-friendly lifestyle website, GreenIsSexy.org, with two of her friends for five years from 2007 to 2011. Her house is powered by Bullfrog renewable energy. She travels around Toronto by bicycle and does not own a car, but drives when in Los Angeles because it is &quot;a harder town to cycle in&quot;. She volunteered in Biloxi, Mississippi, and Louisiana in fall of 2005, as part of the clean-up effort following Hurricane Katrina. McAdams sat on a TreeHugger/Live Earth judging panel in 2007. She appealed for donations during the Canada for Haiti telethon in 2010. She was involved in Matter of Trust&#x27;s &quot;hair boom&quot; efforts following the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill.

<text>Arizona State Prison Complex – Safford is one of 13 prison facilities operated by the Arizona Department of Corrections (ADC). ASPC-Safford is located in Safford, Graham County, Arizona, 173 miles southeast of the state capital of Phoenix, Arizona.

== History ==

In 1968, the Arizona State Legislature passed a bill making the Fort Grant State Industrial School a part of the State&#x27;s Department of Corrections. In 1973, Fort Grant became an adult male prison. In December 1997, the Arizona State Prison at Fort Grant became the Fort Grant Unit of ASPC-Safford.

Designated as a prison complex, Safford had its beginnings as a Department facility in 1970. Then called the Safford Conservation Center, it was a minimum security work camp that housed 185 adult male inmates in tents and Quonset huts before any permanent buildings were erected, the first one a 48-man dormitory constructed in 1976. Two 64-man dormitories were completed by 1983. 

The 1986–87 building program added 100EBUs, in the form of Quonset huts, to expand the capacity of the unit. Today, the prison has a designated capacity of 730 and the Graham and Tonto units house adult male minimum security inmates, the majority working in the community or for other government agencies.

== Population ==

ASPC-Safford has an inmate capacity of approximately 1,717 in 3 housing units at security levels 2 and 3. The ADC uses a score classification system to assess inmates&#x27; appropriate custody and security level placement. The scores range from 1 to 5 with 5 being the highest risk or need.
== Human rights abuses ==

Amnesty International has singled out the prison as an example of human rights violations in US prisons. In an incident in August 1995 at the Graham Unit, 600 prisoners were &quot;forced by guards to remain outdoors, handcuffed, for 96 hours, required to defecate and urinate in their clothes. Many suffered severe sunburn, heat exhaustion and dehydration in the intense heat.&quot;

<doc id="760165" wikidata="Q253246" url="?curid=760165" title="Arcuate nucleus (hypothalamus)">
<text>The arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (ARH), or ARC, is also known as the infundibular nucleus to distinguish it from the arcuate nucleus of the medulla oblongata in the brainstem. The arcuate nucleus is an aggregation of neurons in the mediobasal hypothalamus, adjacent to the third ventricle and the median eminence. The arcuate nucleus includes several important and diverse populations of neurons that help mediate different neuroendocrine and physiological functions, including neuroendocrine neurons, centrally projecting neurons, and astrocytes. The populations of neurons found in the arcuate nucleus are based on the hormones they secrete or interact with and are responsible for hypothalamic function, such as regulating hormones released from the pituitary gland or secreting their own hormones. Neurons in this region are also responsible for integrating information and providing inputs to other nuclei in the hypothalamus or inputs to areas outside this region of the brain. These neurons, generated from the ventral part of the periventricular epithelium during embryonic development, locate dorsally in the hypothalamus, becoming part of the ventromedial hypothalamic region. The function of the arcuate nucleus relies on its diversity of neurons, but its central role is involved in homeostasis. The arcuate nucleus provides many physiological roles involved in feeding, metabolism, fertility, and cardiovascular regulation.

==Cell populations==

===Neuroendocrine neurons===
Different groups of arcuate nucleus neuroendocrine neurons secrete various types or combinations of neurotransmitters and neuropeptides, such as neuropeptide Y (NPY), gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), agouti-related peptide (AgRP), cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART), kisspeptin, dopamine, substance P, growth hormone–releasing hormone (GHRH), neurokinin B (NKB), β-endorphin, melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH), and somatostatin. Proopiomelanocortin (POMC) is a precursor polypeptide that is cleaved into MSH, ACTH, and β-endorphin and expressed in the arcuate nucleus.

Groups of neuroendocrine neurons include:
* TIDA neurons, or tuberoinfundibular dopamine neurons, regulate the secretion of prolactin from the pituitary gland and release the neurotransmitter dopamine. TIDA neurons have nerve endings in the median eminence that release dopamine into the hypophysial portal blood. In lactating females, TIDA neurons are inhibited by the stimulus of suckling. Dopamine released from their nerve endings at the median eminence is transported to the anterior pituitary gland, where it regulates the secretion of prolactin. Dopamine inhibits prolactin secretion, so when the TIDA neurons are inhibited, there is increased secretion of prolactin, which stimulates lactogenesis (milk production). Prolactin acts in a short-loop negative feedback manner to decrease its levels by stimulating the release of dopamine. Dopaminergic neurons of the arcuate also inhibit the release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone, explaining in part why lactating (or otherwise hyperprolactinemic) women experience oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea (infrequency or absence of menses).
* Kisspeptin/NKB neurons within the arcuate nucleus form synaptic inputs with TIDA neurons. These neurons express estrogen receptors and also coexpress neurokinin B in female rats.
* GHRH neurons help to control growth hormone (GH) secretion in conjunction with somatostatin and NPY.
* NPY/AgRP neurons and POMC/CART neurons make up two groups of neurons in the arcuate nucleus that are centrally involved in the neuroendocrine function of feeding. Medial neurons utilize NPY peptides as neurotransmitters to stimulate appetite, and lateral neurons utilize POMC/CART to inhibit appetite. NPY and POMC/CART neurons are sensitive to peripheral hormones such as leptin and insulin. POMC/CART neurons also secrete melanocyte-stimulating hormone, which suppresses appetite.
* GnRH neurons have also been found. These neurons secrete GnRH and histamine.
* There are also groups of neurons expressing NKB and dynorphin that help to control reproduction.

===Centrally-projecting neurons===
Other types of neurons have projection pathways from the arcuate nucleus to mediate different regions of the hypothalamus or to other regions outside of the hypothalamus. Projections of these neurons extend a long distance from the arcuate nucleus to the median eminence to influence the release of hormones from the pituitary gland. Neurons of the arcuate nucleus have intrahypothalamic projections for neuroendocrine circuitry. such as neural projections that influence feeding behavior project to the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVH), the dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus (DMH), and the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA). Populations of neurons connect to the intermediate lobes of the pituitary gland, from the lateral division of the ARH to the neural and intermediate parts of the pituitary gland, and the caudal division of ARH to the median eminence.

Groups of neurons that project elsewhere within the central nervous system include:
* Centrally projecting neurons that contain neuropeptide Y (NPY), agouti-related protein (AGRP), and the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA. These neurons, in the most ventromedial part of the nucleus, project strongly to the lateral hypothalamus and to the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, and are important in the regulation of appetite. When activated, these neurons can produce ravenous eating. These neurons are inhibited by leptin, insulin, and peptide YY and activated by ghrelin.
* Centrally projecting neurons that contain peptide products of pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC), and cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART). These neurons have widespread projections to many brain areas, including to all nuclei in the hypothalamus. These cells are important in the regulation of appetite, and, when activated, they inhibit feeding. These neurons are activated by circulating concentrations of leptin and insulin, and they are directly innervated and inhibited by the NPY neurons. POMC neurons that project to the medial preoptic nucleus are also involved in the regulation of sexual behavior in both males and females. The expression of POMC is regulated by gonadal steroids. The release of a POMC product, beta-endorphin is regulated by NPY.
* Centrally projecting neurons that make somatostatin; the neurosecretory somatostatin neurons that regulate growth hormone secretion are a different population, located in the periventricular nucleus.
* Feeding regulatory neurons also activate oxytocin-containing neurons of the periventricular nucleus (PVN), which projects to nucleus of tractus solitarius in the medulla oblongata.
* Others receive direct synaptic inputs from extra hypothalamic sites projecting into the amygdala, the hippocampus, and the entorhinal cortex.

===Other cells===
Other cell populations include:
* A small population of neurons that sensitive to ghrelin. The role of this population is not known; many neurons in the arcuate nucleus express receptors for ghrelin, but these are thought to respond mainly to blood-borne ghrelin.
* The arcuate nucleus is also contacted by the processes of specialized ependymal cells, called tanycytes.
* Astrocytes in the arcuate nucleus hold high capacity glucose transporters that function as nutrient sensors for appetite controlling neurons
* The diverse and specialized collections of neurons reside within a special compartment with glial cells and have their own network of capillaries and a membrane of tanycytes that help create a blood brain barrier. Circulating or molecules such as hormones travel in the blood and can directly affect these neurons and their plasticity as evidence by adult neurogenesis.

<text>Florida Institute of Technology (Florida Tech or FIT) is a private research university in Melbourne, Florida. The university comprises four academic colleges: Engineering &amp; Science, Aeronautics, Psychology &amp; Liberal Arts, and Business. Approximately half of Florida Tech&#x27;s students are enrolled in the College of Engineering &amp; Science. The university&#x27;s 130-acre primary residential campus is near the Melbourne Orlando International Airport and 16 miles from 
Patrick Space Force Base. The university was founded in 1958 as Brevard Engineering College to provide advanced education for professionals working in the U.S. space program at the Kennedy Space Center and Space Launch Delta 45 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. Florida Tech has been known by its present name since 1966. In 2024, Florida Tech had an on-campus student body of 5,101 between its Melbourne Campus and Off-Campus Sites, as well as 4,762 students enrolled in their online programs, almost equally divided between graduate and undergraduate students with the majority focusing their studies on engineering and the sciences. Florida Tech is classified among &quot;R2: Doctoral Universities – High research activity&quot;.

==History==
Florida Institute of Technology was founded in 1958 as Brevard Engineering College to support NASA by Dr. Jerome P. Keuper, who became the first president. The first concept for the school was developed under the name Brevard Engineering Institute. Classes were originally held at the Melbourne Municipal Airport in buildings formerly used by the Naval Air Station Melbourne. In 1961, the university moved to its current location in Melbourne, Florida. During the 1960s additional classroom and laboratory buildings, a library (formally dedicated on 23 January 1965), the Denius Student Center, Hedgecock Gymnasium, Gleason Auditorium and several dormitories were constructed. In 1961, the first graduate received an associate degree. The university was accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools in 1964 and officially changed its name to Florida Institute of Technology in 1966. Also in 1966, Dr. Jack Morelock founded the Department of Oceanography. In 1967, the School of Aeronautics was created. Defense scientists and NASA would meet with students recruiting for the space program. In 1969, the Panther Battalion Army ROTC program was formed. In 1970, the college merged with Aerospace Technical Institute to form the School of Aeronautics.
In 1972, the university launched its first off-campus program at the request of the United States Navy.

The Evans Library was completed in early 1984. The following year the original library was renovated and dedicated as the Jerome P. Keuper Administration Building. In 1988, the Homer R. Denius Student Center was renovated, the student plaza completed, and the applied research laboratory building acquired. The Claude Pepper Institute for Aging and Therapeutic Research and Skurla Hall, home of the School of Aeronautics, opened in 1990. In 1997, the university received a $50 million grant from the F. W. Olin Foundation. An engineering building and life sciences building were opened in 1999 in result of the grant.

Seven new residence halls were completed in 2003. Each resident hall was named after one of the seven fallen astronauts of the Shuttle Columbia disaster and dedicated to their memory. In 2004, Florida Tech obtained National Science Foundation (NSF) funding to build a 24-inch telescope atop the newly completed F.W. Olin Physical Sciences Center. However, Melbourne Beach resident Jim Ortega, who had retired from the University of Virginia to Florida in 1998, stepped forward with the additional funds needed to secure a 32-inch telescope and its associated observatory. In gratitude to this donation, the telescope was named the Ortega Telescope as part of the Ortega Observatory. In 2005, the F.W. Olin Physical Sciences Center opened.

Construction on the Emil Buehler Center for Aviation Training and Research at Melbourne International Airport began in 2008. The following year, the College of Business became the Nathan M. Bisk College of Business, and the Ruth Funk Center for Textile Arts, the Emil Buehler Center for Aviation Training and Research at the Melbourne International Airport, the Scott Center for Autism Treatment, the Harris Center for Science and Engineering and the Harris Institute for Information Assurance were opened.

In 2009, the college began offering online degrees. November 20, 2015, marked the unveiling of the Harris Student Design Center, an 11,500 square foot building on the south side of campus. This facility provides space for students completing design projects. In 2016, the Center for Advanced Manufacturing and Innovative Design (CAMID) and the Larsen Motorsports High Performance Vehicles &amp; Research Development Center opened at the Research and Development Center on Palm Bay Road.

The university established its football program in 2010. The Panther Aquatic Center was opened a year later. In 2011, the university partnered with the Brevard Art Museum and established it as the Foosaner Art Museum.

In October 2020, the university broke ground at the Olin Quad for the new Health Sciences Research Center, a 61,000 square foot three story facility with 22,300 square feet for classrooms, training and labs.

===College archives===
The Harry P. Weber University Archives opened in 2014. It was named after professor emeritus Harry Weber, who first joined the college in 1966 and was instrumental in establishing the archives. The archive collection serves to preserve the history of the institution and it is located in the Evans Library.

===Jensen Beach Campus===
Florida Institute of Technology&#x27;s Jensen Beach Campus, also known as School of Marine and Environmental Technology or (SOMET), was a specialized branch campus located on the former campus of Saint Joseph College of Florida on the Indian River Lagoon in Jensen Beach, Florida, approximately 50 miles south of the university&#x27;s main campus. The campus attracted oceanography, underwater technology and other assorted marine biology students. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration had more officers that are graduates of Florida Tech in Jensen Beach than from any other campus or college in the country. The SOMET was transferred to the main campus and became the Department of Marine and Environmental Sciences (DMES). The campus closed after the transition in 1986. In 2016, DMES was renamed Department of Ocean Engineering and Sciences (DOES) to communicate the department&#x27;s focus.

<text>Dragon Quest IV: Chapters of the Chosen, titled Dragon Warrior IV when initially localized to North America, is a 1990 role-playing video game, the fourth installment of the &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; video game series developed by Chunsoft and published by Enix, and the first of the Zenithian Trilogy. It was originally released for the Famicom on 11 February 1990 in Japan. A North American NES version followed in October 1992, and would be the last &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; game localized and published by Enix&#x27;s Enix America Corporation subsidiary prior to its closure in November 1995, as well as the last &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; game to be localized into English prior to the localization of &quot;Dragon Warrior Monsters&quot; in December 1999. The game was remade by Heartbeat for the PlayStation, which eventually was available as an Ultimate Hits game. The remake was ported by ArtePiazza to the Nintendo DS, released in Japan November 2007 and worldwide in September 2008. A mobile version based on the Nintendo DS remake was released in 2014 for Android and iOS.

&quot;Dragon Quest IV&quot; differs from the rest of the series by breaking up the game into five distinct chapters, each of which focuses on a different protagonist or protagonists. The first four are told from the perspective of the Hero&#x27;s future companions and the fifth one, from the Hero&#x27;s perspective, brings all the characters together as they start their journey to save the world. The remake adds a sixth chapter.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Dragon Quest IV&quot; offered several new features over the first three titles, while carrying on many of those introduced in the previous games. Similar features included are the day and night cycles, the ability to travel via ship and a flying vehicle (this time, a hot air balloon), and the three levels of keys. They are Thief, Magic and Ultimate (originally localized as Final). There are also travel doors, which allow the party to move a great distance on the world map with little travel. Unlike the Hero in &quot;Dragon Warrior III&quot;, the Hero of &quot;Dragon Quest IV&quot; is not required to be in the party at all once the wagon becomes available. Despite this, the Hero is again the character that possesses the most powerful healing and attack spells. Many spells, weapons, armor, and shops (including the vault/bank) function the same as in past games.

In addition to the new chapter-based storylines, an artificial intelligence system called &quot;Tactics&quot; was implemented that allowed the player to provide strategies to the party members (who become NPCs in the final chapter), such as prioritizing damage, healing or MP conservation, while maintaining full control of the Hero. &quot;Dragon Quest V: Hand of the Heavenly Bride&quot;, &quot;Dragon Quest VI: Realms of Revelation&quot; and the remakes of IV allow tactics to be set for characters individually rather than using one tactics mode for all characters, as well as including the &quot;Follow Orders&quot; Tactics mode, which allows other characters to be controlled manually. This &quot;Tactics&quot; system is seen as a precursor to &quot;Final Fantasy XII&quot; &quot;Gambits&quot; system. The wagon, first introduced in this game, allows the player to choose which characters are used in battle. The wagon can also be seen in &quot;Dragon Quest V,&quot; &quot;Dragon Quest VI,&quot; and &quot;Dragon Quest Monsters: Caravan Heart&quot; (JP release only). The first casino appears in this installment as a place to play several mini-games (slot machine, poker, and the Monster Betting that was introduced in &quot;Dragon Warrior III&quot;) using tokens that could be traded for special items. Searching drawers and inside of jars was first introduced in this game as a means to find items. Small Medals, later Mini Medals, were introduced as a new item to search for and trade for special unique items from a secluded king.

Saving the game was made easier by allowing one to save a game in a House of Healing, rather than talking to a king. Also, the save (&quot;Confession&quot; in the DS remake) and EXP point to the next level-up (&quot;Divination&quot; in the DS remake) are now separate commands. Returning to the format of the original North American &quot;Dragon Warrior&quot;, programmers allowed users to open a door using a command appearing in the top level of the menu (rather than requiring users to search through various characters&#x27; inventories for the key as in some previous games). The only requirement was that at least one character in the party needed to have an appropriate key in his or her inventory. Since this command was added, an unlocked door was added in this game, as well as large Castle Doors. However, this command was eliminated in later games and the remake, in which doors can be opened by attempting to walk through them.

==Synopsis==

In the original version, the game is divided into five chapters. The first four provide back-story for the Hero&#x27;s party members, while the fifth follows the Hero themself as they meet up with the other characters.

Chapter One follows the soldier, Ragnar McRyan, who is tasked by the King of Burland to find children who have gone missing from a nearby town, befriending a Cureslime named Healie, who aspires to become human. Ragnar finds and defeats the monster responsible for the abductions and returns the children to their homes. In doing so, he learns the monsters were looking for the Legendary Hero, who is supposedly still a child, in order to kill them. Ragnar decides to leave his home and set out on a quest to protect them.

Chapter Two follows the tomboyish Princess Alena and her two friends and mentors, tutor Borya and chancellor Kiryl, as she travels to prove her strength. Partway through her journey, Alena&#x27;s father loses his voice after speaking of a dream he had depicting the end of the world. After restoring his voice, she travels to the town of Endor to enter a fighting tournament. She defeats all of the combatants except a warrior named Psaro the Manslayer, who fails to appear. After the victory, she returns to her home castle to find all the inhabitants have gone missing, so she sets out to find out what happened to everyone.

Chapter Three follows the merchant, Torneko, a humble merchant working in a weapon shop in his hometown with his wife and young son. His dream is to own his own shop and be the world&#x27;s greatest merchant. As he travels and performs favors at the towns he visits, Torneko eventually obtains permission to purchase a shop in Endor. Torneko is soon able to obtain the funds to purchase the shop and move his family to Endor. After establishing a successful business with his wife, he hears about a set of legendary weapons, which he sets out to find by funding the construction of an underground passageway to a neighboring continent.

Chapter Four follows the dancer, Maya, and the fortuneteller, Meena, two sisters seeking revenge for the murder of their father by his former student, Balzack. By teaming up with a former student of their father, Oojam, they manage to plot a way into the Palais de Léon and find the man responsible. They attempt to avenge their father&#x27;s murder by defeating Balzack, but are quickly defeated by Balzack&#x27;s master, the Marquis de Léon, and are thrown in the dungeon. Oojam sacrifices himself to allow the sisters to escape the castle. They then decide to flee the continent and head for Endor, where they hope to learn more about their new foe and about the Legendary Hero, whom they became aware of during their travels.

Chapter Five follows the game&#x27;s protagonist, known as &quot;the Hero&quot;. It begins with the Hero&#x27;s hometown being attacked by monsters, led by Psaro the Manslayer. The Hero manages to escape, and is joined by the main characters of the previous chapters. Together, they accomplish various deeds, such as defeating Marquis de Léon and Balzack, as well as collecting various pieces of Zenithian Armor, equipment that can only be worn by the one chosen to save the world. Later, they spy on Psaro and discover that Estark, the Ruler of Evil, has been awakened. They then travel to Estark&#x27;s palace and defeat him just as Psaro&#x27;s followers discover him.

In the town of Strathbaile, the heroes have a dream that explains Psaro&#x27;s plan. Developing a deep hatred of humanity after the death of his elven girlfriend, Rose, at the hands of humans, Psaro plans to become the next Ruler of Evil using the power of evolution he obtained from the &quot;Armlet of Transmutation&quot;. The party then complete the set of Zenithian armor to permit entry into the Zenithian Castle. There, they meet the Zenith Dragon, who guides them to Nadiria, where Psaro is undergoing his evolution into the new Ruler of Evil. There, they defeat his generals before challenging him. After fighting a continually evolving form of Psaro, he is vanquished.

The PlayStation and DS remakes include a sixth chapter that acts as an alternate ending. This chapter focuses on the heroes working with Psaro to avenge the death of Rose, and finally put the world back in order. Throughout this chapter, Rose is revived and the party is able to defeat her true killer, the Dark Priest Aamon, one of Psaro the Manslayer&#x27;s subordinates who intended to take the secrets of evolution for himself and usurp him, setting all plans in motion that drove Psaro to his insanity.

== Development ==
According to Yuji Horii, he wanted to have something the player went around collecting as the previous &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; games had crests and orbs respectively. However, he did not want to do the same thing over again by forcing the player to collect a certain number of items before they beat the game; mini medals instead have nothing to do with clearing the game. The promotional illustrations for the Japanese version was drawn by famed manga artist Akira Toriyama, who provided the artwork for the previous games in the series and would continue to do so for every future installment.

=== 1992 North American localization ===
Unlike all the other games up to this point, the changes in this version were not as radical. Among them were the usual religious/violence censorship, new graphics for the opening copyright and ending credits, and the betting in the Casino was slightly modified to allow more money being won during a bet.

=== PlayStation remake ===
&quot;Dragon Quest IV&quot; was remade for the PlayStation on November 22, 2001 in Japan. It was developed by Heartbeat and published by Enix. The remake was developed using &quot;Dragon Quest VII&#x27;s&quot; 3D graphics engine. The characters, towns, world maps, sound, battles and enemies all received updates. The character sprites were updated to match the original artwork for the characters in the original &quot;Dragon Quest IV&quot; Manual and artwork. With this remake came several new features. Among these features were a new chapter in which Psaro is available as a party member (as well as a prologue chapter), an intra-party talk command similar to &quot;Dragon Quest VII&quot;, and the ability to turn off the artificial intelligence for party members to allow for direct control of their attacks (except UC Party Members). The game sold over one million copies in Japan by the end of 2001.

Enix America originally planned to bring the remake to North America in 2002 and had even advertised this upcoming release on the back cover to the US instruction manual for &quot;Dragon Warrior VII&quot;, but it was later canceled, due to Heartbeat closing its video game development operations before the localization and translation could be completed. It was later explained that the cost and time that a different company would need to invest to complete the translation prevented Enix from passing this to another developer, as Heartbeat was the most familiar with their own design.

=== Nintendo DS remake ===
&quot;Dragon Quest IV&quot; was later re-released for the Nintendo DS in Japan in November 2007. The game has been remade into a 2D/3D hybrid, similar to the PlayStation version. This release has kept many of the enhancements from the PlayStation, such as the slightly altered immigrant town, but has received enhanced upgrades to smooth the graphics further, and improved sound. This release also allows players to take manual control of all of their party members in the final two chapters.

Shortly after the Japanese release, several people editing the Japanese ROM file discovered a near complete English translation along with Spanish, French, German, and Italian translations already inside the Japanese game. On April 9, 2008, Square Enix applied for a trademark to the title &quot;Chapters of the Chosen&quot;, and speculation began that this was the new subtitle to &quot;Dragon Quest IV&quot; for an American release.

On April 18, 2008, &quot;Dragon Quest IV: Chapters of the Chosen&quot; was found to have a rating of E10+ by the ESRB, for Alcohol Reference, Animated Blood, Mild Fantasy Violence, Mild Language, Simulated Gambling, and Suggestive Themes. An official release date of September 16, 2008 was finally established on the official North American site. The game was released in Europe under the title &quot;Dragon Quest: Chapters of the Chosen&quot;, omitting the number IV in a similar fashion to the European version of &quot;Dragon Quest VIII&quot;.

This version of the game contains an entirely new translation of the script. It was claimed in Nintendo Power that the new translation has changed the names of many of the main characters, weapons and towns to be closer to, or include their original Japanese names, while adding several new localizations. This version also uses the new spell naming convention first used in &quot;Dragon Quest VIII&quot;, such as the spell &quot;Beat&quot; from &quot;Dragon Warrior IV&quot; becoming &quot;Whack&quot;. The western translations have been slightly changed in places where the Japanese version included sexual components, and the Japanese version&#x27;s party talk feature was completely excised from the western versions.

The Nintendo DS English translation includes 13 regional dialects for the various areas, including Burland now being Scottish, and Zamoksva being Russian. Simon Carless of Gamasutra feels that the use of dialects can help some people to understand different cultures, saying, &quot;It has the potential to nurture cross-language and cross-cultural understanding in a very intelligent manner.&quot;

A version based on Nintendo DS remake was released in Japan on April 17, 2014 for Android and iOS. It was released internationally on August 7, 2014. The Android version of the game features cloud saving, autosaves, a quick save feature, and a pause feature for ease of use on the mobile platform. This version also reintroduces the party talk feature removed from the international Nintendo DS releases, being translated into the appropriate language. It also replaced the orchestrated music with the synthesized MIDI music in the title screen, which is performed by the Tokyo Metropolitan Symphony Orchestra. However, the synthesized music is entirely remastered in the iOS and Android versions, other than the synthesized music in the DS version.

== Other media ==
=== Manga ===
A five volume manga called &quot;Dragon Quest: Princess Alena&quot; was released. It followed the story of Chapter 2, Alena&#x27;s adventure, but begins to divert during the events in the Birdsong Tower. From this point forward, it introduces several new characters, including the evil Evil Leather Dominatrix Woman, and new locations, including an Arctic location and a haunted house. This story ends with Alena fighting Psaro and defeating him before he goes on with the Golden Bracelet to perfect the secret of evolution.

=== Soundtrack ===
As with every &quot;Dragon Quest&quot;, Koichi Sugiyama composed the music and directed all the associated spinoffs. The song heard during gameplay depends on a number of factors. A specific track is always played for towns, another for caves or dungeons, another while the party is mounted on the hot air balloon, for instance. Lastly, while out in the world, each of the first four acts has its own theme song, as does the Hero—in act five, the theme song played depends on who is the first character in the formation.

The original &quot;Dragon Warrior IV&quot; was one of the few NES games to feature a &quot;crescendo&quot; during the battle music, a gradual increase in volume from soft to loud. This technique was rare for an NES game. However, the PlayStation and Nintendo DS versions do not feature the crescendo in the battle music. This level of detail can be found in the NES version&#x27;s soundtrack, as well as the 2014 Android and iOS mobile releases.

&quot;Dragon Quest IV ~The People Are Shown the Way~ Symphonic Suite&quot; is a compilation of music from &quot;Dragon Quest IV&quot;. The first print of the album was in 1990, the London Philharmonic version came out a year later, and a reprint of the original was released in 2000. In 1991, Enix released a set of videos featuring Koichi Sugiyama conducting the London Philharmonic Orchestra performing the soundtrack in Warwick Castle, along with clips of acting.

== Reception ==
===Sales===
Upon release in Japan, the game sold out cartridges and grossed ( at the time, or adjusted for inflation) within one hour of its release. By 1992, it had sold units in Japan. The original Famicom version went on to sell units, becoming the fourth best-selling game of the system, below its predecessor &quot;Dragon Quest III&quot;. The original game sold a worldwide total of copies, including in Japan and 80,000 in the United States, grossing several hundred million dollars by 1993 ( adjusted for inflation).

The PlayStation version of &quot;Dragon Quest IV&quot; was the fourth best-selling game in Japan in 2001 with over 1 million copies sold, and has sold nearly 1.2 million copies as of December 26, 2004. As of August 8, 2008, the DS remake has sold 1.15 million units in Japan, and 1.46 million copies worldwide as of May 31, 2009.

===Critical response===
&quot;Dragon Quest IV&quot; was awarded &quot;Best Game Grand Prize&quot; and &quot;Best RPG Game&quot; in &quot;Famitsu&quot; magazine&#x27;s 1990 Best Hit Game Awards. It was also awarded &quot;Best Challenge&quot; and 2nd place &quot;Best Overall Game&quot; (NES) in 1993 by &quot;Nintendo Power&quot;.

In 1997 &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; editors ranked &quot;Dragon Warrior IV&quot; the 58th best console video game of all time, calling it &quot;easily the best RPG ever released for the NES - in the U.S. or Japan.&quot; They particular cited the epic length of the game&#x27;s quest. In August 2008, &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; ranked &quot;Dragon Quest IV&quot; the 18th best Nintendo Entertainment System video game, describing it as the peak of the NES&#x27; &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; series and praising it for its innovative five-act story that made it one of their favourite old-school role-playing games. Readers of &quot;Famitsu&quot; voted the game as the 14th best game of all time in a 2006 poll. In particular, critics noticed with interest that the game&#x27;s third chapter, Torneko&#x27;s, departed largely from standard RPGs by making the only goal to collect money and by allowing players to have Torneko simply working in an in-game store.

&quot;Dragon Quest IV: Chapters of the Chosen&quot; was a nominee for Best RPG on the Nintendo DS in IGN&#x27;s 2008 video game awards. Critics pointed out that the game may feel outdated, especially to players not accustomed to &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; games, but that some of the characters, such as Ragnar, make the game stand out of the recent JRPGs. &quot;Ragnar McRyan is in no way a character designed off the back of some intense Japanese schoolgirl demographic focus testing&quot;, wrote Eurogamer&#x27;s Simon Parkin, pleased.

===Legacy===
&quot;Dragon Quest IV&quot; is the first game in the series to spawn spin-offs. The merchant Torneko (also known as Taloon in the NES version) was popular enough to star his own series, in which he finds himself in quests in order to expand his store. These games are the &quot;Torneko no Daibouken&quot; sub-series (translated as &quot;Torneko&#x27;s Great Adventure&quot;), roguelike and random dungeon games produced by Enix (and Square Enix) and developed by Chunsoft. The success of the games later inspired the creation of the &quot;Mystery Dungeon&quot; series.

Ragnar, Healie, and Torneko all later appear as cameos in &quot;Dragon Quest VIII: Journey of the Cursed King&quot; in the Monster Arena. Torneko later cameos in &quot;Dragon Quest Yangus&quot; as a merchant. In the &quot;Dynasty Warriors&quot; spin-off &quot;Dragon Quest Heroes: The World Tree&#x27;s Woe and the Blight Below&quot;, Alena, Kiryl, Maya, and Psaro appear as playable characters; they are joined by Torneko and Meena in &quot;Dragon Quest Heroes II&quot;, and the compilation port &quot;Dragon Quest Heroes I·II&quot; for Nintendo Switch also includes Ragnar as a console-exclusive character for &quot;Heroes II&quot;. The male version of the protagonist also appeared as a playable character in the 2018 crossover fighting game &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot; via downloadable content. He is fully voiced for the first time by Takeshi Kusao.

<text>Frankie Burke (June 6, 1915 – April 7, 1983) was a Hollywood actor, best known for his appearance as a member of The East Side Kids.

==Early life==
Burke was born Frankie Vaselle and grew up in Brooklyn, New York. His name was changed when he began working in films. Burke went to P.S. 25. He grew up watching James Cagney on film in local theaters and, having been told many times how much he resembled him, figured if Cagney could become famous, so could he. Burke sold newspapers on the street corners before deciding to hitchhike to Hollywood in 1937 to meet Cagney, but when the first attempt failed, he went back to Brooklyn.

In 1937, Burke worked as a bellhop at a hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada.

==Life in Hollywood==
He was discovered by a Warner Brothers talent scout, out searching for young men who resembled Cagney for a role in 1938&#x27;s &quot;Angels with Dirty Faces&quot;. He went on to do eighteen more films, several of which were uncredited, before his last role in 1941&#x27;s &quot;Shadow of the Thin Man&quot;.

==Death==
Burke died of lung cancer in 1983. He was survived by one son.

<text>Donald Montgomery Hutson (January 31, 1913 – June 26, 1997), nicknamed &quot;the Alabama Antelope&quot;, was an American professional football player and coach in the National Football League (NFL). In the era of the one-platoon football, he played as an end and spent his entire 11-year career with the Green Bay Packers. Under head coach Curly Lambeau, Hutson led the Packers to four NFL Championship Games, winning three in 1936, 1939, and 1944.

Hutson joined the Packers in 1935 and played 11 seasons before he retired in 1945. He led the league in receiving yards in seven separate seasons and led the league in receiving touchdowns in nine seasons. A talented safety on defense, he also led the NFL in interceptions in 1940, becoming the first and only player to lead the league in receiving touchdowns and interceptions in the same season. Hutson was an eight-time All-Pro selection, a four-time All-Star, and was twice awarded the Joe F. Carr Trophy as the NFL Most Valuable Player.

Hutson is considered to have been the first modern wide receiver, and is credited with creating many of the modern pass routes used in the NFL today. He was the dominant receiver of his day, and is widely considered one of the greatest receivers in NFL history. Hutson was the first 1,000-yard receiver in the NFL. He held almost all major receiving records at the time of his retirement, including career receptions, yards, and receiving touchdowns. He was inducted as a charter member of both the College Football Hall of Fame and the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Hutson&#x27;s number 14 was the first jersey retired by the Packers, and he is a member of the Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame. Hutson was selected to the National Football League 50th Anniversary All-Time Team as one of the greatest players of the NFL&#x27;s first 50 years in 1969, to the 75th in 1994, and to the 100th in 2019.

==Early life and college==
Don Hutson was born on January 31, 1913, in Pine Bluff, Arkansas, one of three sons of Roy B. Hutson and Mabel Clark Hutson. While a Boy Scout, he played with snakes. He said that is where he got his quickness and agility. As a teenager Hutson played baseball for Pine Bluff&#x27;s town team. As a senior at Pine Bluff High School he was an all-state basketball player, which he said was his favorite sport. &quot;I&#x27;m like most [athletes],&quot; he said. &quot;I&#x27;d rather see football, but I&#x27;d rather play basketball.&quot; Hutson played one year of football at Pine Bluff.

Hutson played at end for coach Frank Thomas&#x27;s Alabama Crimson Tide football team from 1932 to 1934. Bear Bryant, future long-time coach of the Tide, was the self-described &quot;other end&quot; on the Tide in 1933 and 1934. Bryant once remarked, &quot;...he was something to see even then. We&#x27;d hitchhike to Pine Bluff just to watch him play. I saw him catch five touchdown passes in one game in high school.&quot;

Sportswriter Morgan Blake ranked the undefeated 1934 Tide as the best team he ever saw. Hutson&#x27;s College Football Hall of Fame profile reads: &quot;Fluid in motion, wondrously elusive with the fake, inventive in his patterns and magnificently at ease when catching the ball ... Hutson and fellow Hall of Famer Millard &quot;Dixie&quot; Howell became football&#x27;s most celebrated passing combination.&quot; Hutson had six catches for 165 yards, including two touchdowns of 54 and 59 yards in the 1935 Rose Bowl against Stanford. He also scored the winning touchdown over Robert Neyland&#x27;s Tennessee Volunteers on an end-around.

Hutson was recognized as a first-team All-American for six different organizations and received a second-team selection by one other. In an attempt to name retroactive Heisman Trophy winners before its first year of 1936, Hutson was awarded it for 1934 by the National Football Foundation. Georgia Tech coach Bill Alexander once said, &quot;All Don Hutson can do is beat you with clever hands and the most baffling change of pace I&#x27;ve ever seen.&quot;

==NFL career==

When he graduated from Alabama, Hutson did not plan on playing professionally. In those days, the NFL was not highly regarded in the South compared to college football. But Green Bay Packers head coach Curly Lambeau saw the speedy Hutson as the perfect receiver for an expanded passing attack, which at the time revolved around the passing of single-wing backs Red Dunn and Arnie Herber to shifty halfback &quot;Johnny Blood&quot; McNally.

Before the draft existed, college players could sign with any team they wanted, and while Hutson did sign a contract with Green Bay, he had also signed a contract with the NFL&#x27;s Brooklyn Dodgers. Both contracts came to the NFL office at the same time, and NFL president Joseph Carr declared that Hutson would go to Green Bay, as the Green Bay contract had an earlier date of signing. Hutson later claimed he chose the Packers because they offered the most money—$300 a game. &quot;That was far and above what they had ever paid a player,&quot; said Hutson. &quot;Each week they&#x27;d give me a check for $150 from one bank and $150 from another so nobody would know how much I was getting paid.&quot;

Hutson&#x27;s first catch as a professional was on an 83-yard touchdown pass from Herber on the first play from scrimmage against the Chicago Bears, in the second game of the 1935 season. It was the only score of the game as the Packers won 7–0. He caught six touchdowns total in his rookie season, which led the league. It was the first in a string of four straight seasons and nine seasons total that Hutson led the league in touchdown receptions.

The 1936 season brought the Packers their fourth league title, with a 21–6 win over the Boston Redskins in the 1936 NFL Championship Game. Hutson scored the first touchdown of the game, on a 48-yard pass from Herber in the first quarter. Hutson became the youngest player in league history to lead the league in both receptions and receiving yardage, a record not broken until 2022 by Minnesota Vikings receiver, Justin Jefferson. He completed the season with 34 receptions for 536 yards and eight touchdowns, which were all league records, and helped Herber set the NFL season passing yards record. Hutson&#x27;s yardage record was broken the next season by Chicago Cardinals receiver Gaynell Tinsley, who challenged Hutson over the next few years for the title of best receiver in the NFL.

In 1938, Hutson had nine touchdown receptions, again setting the league record, as he led the Packers to another NFL Championship Game, this time against the New York Giants. However, a knee injury he suffered four weeks earlier kept him out of the game&#x27;s starting lineup. He entered as a substitute three separate times late in the game but was unable to be a factor, catching no passes as Green Bay was defeated 23–17.

Hutson reclaimed the season receiving yards record from Tinsley in 1939 by catching 34 passes for 846 yards—an average of 24.9 yards per reception, the highest of his career. He again led the Packers to the championship game, for a rematch against the Giants. This time Green Bay was victorious, with a 27–0 shutout win. Hutson had two receptions in the game for 21 yards and a rushing attempt that went for three yards.

In 1940, Hutson scored seven touchdowns and kicked 15 extra points to lead the league in scoring by edging out Rams fullback Johnny Drake by a single point. On September 29, Hutson caught his 38th career touchdown pass, breaking Johnny Blood&#x27;s record. With 99 touchdown receptions for his career, he remained the record holder for almost 50 years, until surpassed by the last touchdown of Steve Largent&#x27;s career in 1989.

In 1941, Hutson became the first receiver to catch 50 passes in a season, doing so while again leading the league in receptions, receiving yards, and touchdowns. He also scored two rushing touchdowns, for a total of 12. After the season, he was awarded the Joe F. Carr Trophy as the league&#x27;s most valuable player. He received six of the nine first place votes, finishing ahead of his quarterback Cecil Isbell, who received two first place votes.

Hutson repeated as league MVP in 1942 as he shattered most of his own records; he caught 74 passes for 1,211 yards and 17 touchdowns and averaged over 110 receiving yards per game. This was the first time a receiver had reached the 1,000 yard milestone. He again received six of nine first place votes for the Joe F. Carr Trophy. &quot;The selection did not rest alone on his great pass catching ability,&quot; reasoned the selection committee. &quot;Also considered were his nuisance value as a disrupter of enemy defenses and his ability to transform the Packers into a confident, powerful aggregation in clutch situations.&quot; His production helped Isbell become the first NFL quarterback to throw for over 2,000 yards in a season.

In February 1943, Hutson announced his retirement from football due to a lingering chest injury. He changed his mind and returned for the 1943 season, however, and caught 47 passes for 776 yards and eleven touchdowns, leading the league in all three. He also threw his first and only completed pass of his career: a 38-yard touchdown pass to Harry Jacunski against the Bears. Additionally, he successfully kicked 36 extra points on 36 tries, and had an 83-yard interception return touchdown. After the season Hutson again announced his intention to retire as a player, this time to be an assistant coach for the Packers. He once again returned as a player in 1944 and again led the league with 58 receptions, 866 yards, and nine touchdowns, while also serving as assistant coach. He led the Packers to the 1944 NFL Championship Game against the Giants and caught two passes for 47 yards, as the Packers won their third and final championship with Hutson, 14–7.

For the third time in as many years Hutson announced his retirement, and for the third time he returned as a player in 1945. A sportswriter for &quot;The Pittsburgh Press&quot; jokingly declared Hutson &quot;holder of the world&#x27;s record for coming out of retirement.&quot; In a week three, 57–21 blowout win against the Detroit Lions, Hutson set an NFL record with four touchdown receptions in a game, all of them coming in the second quarter. He also kicked five extra points in the quarter, for a total of 29 points, which as of 2015 remains a record for points by a player in a single quarter.

In all, Hutson caught 488 passes for 7,991 yards and 99 touchdowns. He rushed for three touchdowns, scored two touchdowns on blocked punts, and had an interception return touchdown for a career total of 105. He scored at least six receiving touchdowns in each of his 11 seasons. Hutson led the NFL in receptions eight times, including five consecutive times: 1941 to 1945. He led the NFL in receiving yards seven times, including four straight times: 1941 to 1944. He led the NFL in scoring five times: 1941 to 1945. As of 2016, Hutson still holds the highest career average touchdowns per game for a receiver, at 0.85. Hutson&#x27;s single season record of 17 touchdown receptions in 1942 stood for 42 years until broken by receiver Mark Clayton in 1984, a year in which Miami&#x27;s quarterback Dan Marino had more completions (362) than the entire 1942 Packers team&#x27;s pass attempts (330). His four receiving touchdowns in a game has been surpassed three times and tied several times, but his four in a single quarter has yet to be matched. His record 99 touchdown receptions stood for 44 years, well into the modern era. In his 11-year professional career, Hutson never missed a game due to injury. He invented many pass routes still in use today, including the chair route.

At his peak, Hutson was a challenge to defend, mainly because no one had ever seen anything like him in the NFL before. Even when opposing defenses deployed their best defender or multiple defenders against Hutson, he was almost always able to break free. Hutson&#x27;s ability to beat defenders was remarkable considering he played in an era when there were far fewer restrictions on how and when a defender could legally hit a receiver. It was initially thought that the 6–1, 185-pound Hutson was too fragile for the NFL. However, according to Tony Canadeo, who played alongside Hutson from 1941 to 1944, Hutson was as skilled going over the middle as he was going deep.

===Defense and special teams===
For many of his 11 seasons, Hutson was also the Packers&#x27; kicker. He added 172 extra points on 183 attempts and seven field goals on 15 attempts for another league record 823 points. He led the league in extra points made and attempted in 1941, 1942 and 1945 and in field goals made in 1943. As did almost all players in his day, Hutson played both offense and defense. On defense, he played safety and intercepted 30 passes over the final six years of his career. His highest season total was in 1943, when he intercepted eight passes in ten games. In 1940, he led the NFL with six interceptions.

Hutson was a player-coach during the last two seasons of his playing career. After his retirement as a player, Hutson remained on the Packers staff as an assistant until 1948.

==Personal and later life==
From an early age Hutson was interested in business. &quot;At the university [of Alabama], I was the only athlete in the business school,&quot; he said. &quot;The only reason I wanted to play pro sports was to get a stake.&quot; While both were students at Alabama, he partnered with Bear Bryant to operate a laundromat in Tuscaloosa called Captain Kidd Cleaners. However, neither were educated in laundering, and they sold the business after two years. While in Green Bay, Hutson opened the Packer Playdium bowling alley, which proved so successful that he twice considered retirement from football to fully dedicate his time to its operation. He then started the Hutson Motor Car Co. dealership and in 1951 purchased Chevrolet and Cadillac agencies in Racine, Wisconsin. &quot;I never aimed for automobiles,&quot; said Hutson. &quot;That just happened to be the thing I got into. I just wanted to run a business, any business. He also served on the Packers board of directors from 1952 to 1980, when he was elected a director emeritus.

Hutson was a Freemason.

After he retired from the dealership business, Hutson settled in Rancho Mirage, California, where he lived until his death on June 26, 1997, at the age of 84.

==Honors and recognition==

Hutson has been honored in a variety of ways. He was elected to the Wisconsin Athletic Hall of Fame as a charter member in 1951, and the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame in 1968, also as an initial member. His number 14 was the first number retired by the Packers, in a public ceremony at a game at City Stadium on December 2, 1951. Hutson Street in the Packerland Industrial Park in Green Bay is named for him, and in 1994 the Packers named their new state-of-the-art indoor practice facility across the street from Lambeau Field the &quot;Don Hutson Center.&quot;

Hutson was inducted as a charter member of both the College Football Hall of Fame in 1951, and Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1963. His college career made him a unanimous choice for the Associated Press Southeast Area All-Time football team 1920–1969 era. Hutson is a member of the Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame, inducted in 1972 along with his quarterbacks, Arnie Herber and Cecil Isbell. There is a park named after him in his hometown of Pine Bluff, Arkansas. On the occasion of his 75th birthday he performed the ceremonial coin toss of Super Bowl XXII to end the pregame ceremonies. Hutson was named to the NFL&#x27;s 1930s All-Decade Team and 50th Anniversary Team in 1970, and in 1994 he was named to the NFL 75th Anniversary All-Time Team. In 1999, he was ranked sixth on &quot;The Sporting News&quot; list of the 100 Greatest Football Players, the highest-ranking Packer and the highest-ranking pre–World War II player. In 2012, the NFL Network named Hutson the greatest Green Bay Packer of all time.

In 2005, the Flagstad family of Green Bay donated to the Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame an authentic Packers No. 14 jersey worn by Hutson. The jersey was found in a trunk of old uniforms in 1946 at the Rockwood Lodge, the Packers&#x27; summer training camp from 1946 to 1949, owned by Melvin and Helen Flagstad. The jersey, a rare NFL artifact valued at over $17,000, was donated by son Daniel Flagstad in memory of his parents.

Hutson&#x27;s most productive seasons were from 1942 to 1945, a time in which the NFL was severely depleted with many of its most talented players and prospective college athletes serving in the military during World War II. Hutson was classified I-A for the military draft, but had three daughters, so was able to avoid conscription. On the notion that Hutson exploited watered-down defenses, former Packers Hall of Fame running back Paul Hornung responded as such: &quot;I&#x27;m a believer. Am I a believer! You know what Hutson would do in this league today? The same things he did when he played.&quot;

==NFL records==
As of the end of the 2017 NFL season, Hutson still holds the following records: most seasons leading league in pass receptions (8), most consecutive seasons leading league in pass receptions (5), most seasons leading league in pass receiving yards gained (7), most consecutive seasons leading league in pass receiving yards gained (4), most seasons leading league in pass receiving touchdowns (9), most seasons leading the league in total touchdowns (8), Most consecutive seasons leading league in pass receiving touchdowns (5), most seasons leading league in scoring (5, now tied), and most consecutive seasons leading league in scoring (5).

Hutson was the youngest receiver in NFL history, at the age of 23 during the 1936 season, to lead the league in both receptions and receiving yards during a single season. The mark was not broken for 86 years until 2022, when Minnesota Vikings receiver Justin Jefferson surpassed it.

<text>Hal Haig &quot;Harry&quot; Prieste (November 23, 1896 – April 19, 2001) was an American athlete who participated in the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp as a diver.

==Biography==
He was born Haig Prieste in Fresno, California, to Armenian immigrant parents. Their original surname was Keshishian. &quot;Haig&quot; is the name of the progenitor of the Armenians. Prieste first took &quot;Harry&quot; as his American name, but later switched to &quot;Hal.&quot;

He won a bronze medal in platform diving as a member of the 1920 US Olympic team. He also competed in the 1920 plain high diving event, but he was eliminated in the first round.

He is known for taking the original five-interlocking-ring Olympic flag as a prank at the 1920 Summer Olympics hosted by the city of Antwerp, Belgium. At the end of the Games, the flag could not be found. In 1997, at a banquet hosted by the US Olympic Committee, a reporter was interviewing him and the reporter mentioned that the IOC had not been able to find out what had happened to the original Olympic flag. &quot;I can help you with that,&quot; Prieste said matter-of-factly; &quot;it&#x27;s in my suitcase.&quot; At the end of the Antwerp Olympics, spurred on by team-mate Duke Kahanamoku, he climbed a flagpole and stole the Olympic flag. For 77 years the flag was stored away in the bottom of his suitcase. The flag was returned to the IOC by Prieste, by then 103 years old, in a special ceremony held at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney. At the handover, IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch gave him a commemorative Olympic medal in a box, to which the hard-of-hearing Prieste responded, &quot;What is it? Kleenex?&quot; The Antwerp Olympic Flag is now on display at the Olympic Museum in Lausanne, Switzerland, with a plaque thanking him for donating it.

At the time of his death at 104, Prieste was the world&#x27;s oldest former Olympic medalist, and the first known Olympian whose lifespan covered three centuries (1896–2001).

<doc id="760204" wikidata="Q1502403" url="?curid=760204" title="Panamint Range">
<text>The Panamint Range is a short rugged fault-block mountain range in the northern Mojave Desert, within Death Valley National Park in Inyo County, eastern California. A small part of the southern end of the range is in San Bernardino County. Dr. Darwin French is credited as applying the term Panamint in 1860 during his search for the fabled Gunsight Lode. 

The origin of the name is the Paiute or Koso word Panümünt or Pa (water) and nïwïnsti (person).
==Geography==
The range runs north–south for approximately through Inyo County, forming the western wall of Death Valley and separating it from the Panamint Valley to the west. The range is part of the Basin and Range Province, at the western end of the Great Basin.

The highest peak in the range is Telescope Peak, with an elevation of .

==Features==
Both Mount Whitney above the Owens Valley and Badwater Basin in Death Valley are visible from certain vantage points in the Panamint Range, making it one of few places where one can simultaneously see both the highest and lowest points in the contiguous United States. Dante&#x27;s View east of Death Valley is another.

Being a sky island habitat of the Mojave Desert, with more precipitation and temperature variation than the desert floor and hills, there are various plant and animal species endemic to the Panamint Range.

===Mining===
The Panamint Mining District is on the western side of the Panamint Range. Panamint City (est. 1873) was a mining town in the district, formerly in the central section of the range. The historic mining community of Ballarat (est. 1890s), also in the district, is now a ghost town. The Gold Hill Mining District (est. 1875) was in the southwestern section of the range, at the northeast end of Butte Valley.

The Wildrose Charcoal Kilns (completed 1877) are ruins of charcoal kilns located near Wildrose Canyon in the northern range and within Death Valley National Park. They were built in 1877 by the Modock Consolidated Mining Company, to provide fuel for smelters near their lead and silver mines in the Argus Range. The ten beehive shaped masonry structures, about tall, are the best known surviving examples of such charcoal kilns in the western U.S.

<doc id="760209" wikidata="Q5583722" url="?curid=760209" title="Goodwood Racecourse">
<text>Goodwood Racecourse is a horse-racing track five miles north of Chichester, West Sussex, in England controlled by the family of the Duke of Richmond, whose seat is nearby Goodwood House. It hosts the annual Glorious Goodwood meeting in late July and early August, which is one of the highlights of the British flat racing calendar, and is home to three of the UK&#x27;s 36 annual Group 1 flat races, the Sussex Stakes, the Goodwood Cup and the Nassau Stakes. Although the race meeting has become known as &#x27;Glorious Goodwood&#x27;, it is sponsored by Qatar and officially called the &#x27;Qatar Goodwood Festival&#x27;.
It is considered to enjoy an attractive setting to the north of Trundle Iron Age hill fort, which is used as an informal grandstand with views of the whole course. One problem is that its proximity to the coast means that it can get foggy.

This is an unusual, complex racecourse with a straight six furlongs—the &quot;Stewards&#x27; Cup Course&quot;—which is uphill for the first furlong and mostly downhill thereafter. There is a tight right-handed loop at the far end of the straight on which there are starts for various longer distance courses. These include the 1 mile 2 furlongs (1m 2f) &quot;Craven Course&quot;, the 1m 4f &quot;Gratwicke Course&quot; and the 1m 6f &quot;Bentinck Course&quot;. The start for the 2m 5f &quot;Cup Course&quot; is quite close to the winning post—horses travel outwards on the straight, around the loop and back. Throughout the loop there are severe undulations and sharp turns. The course is used for flat racing only.

From 1968 to 1970 the course&#x27;s late summer meeting was shown on ITV, and from the early 2000s some races from the course occasionally appeared on Channel 4, but otherwise the course had been covered exclusively by the BBC for 50 years from 1956 (when it first appeared on television) to 2006. In 2007 the rights passed to Channel 4 Racing. Since 2017 races have been live on ITV Racing after the channel won the rights to televise horse racing from Channel 4.

In the late 18th century, Goodwood became the location for the first flag start on a British racecourse, at the behest of Lord George Bentinck, after a particularly shambolic start involving jockey Sam Arnull caused by an elderly deaf starter with a speech impediment. Its primary meeting, now known as &quot;Glorious Goodwood&quot;, was established in 1802 and the important early handicap the Goodwood Stakes was established in 1823.

<doc id="760228" wikidata="Q1754173" url="?curid=760228" title="The Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy">
<text>The Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy were an American hip-hop musical ensemble, active during the early 1990s. The band was formed in 1990 by Michael Franti (vocals, production, misc. instruments) and Rono Tse (drums, percussion, programming), who had worked together in The Beatnigs. They released two albums, the critically acclaimed &quot;Hypocrisy Is the Greatest Luxury&quot; in 1992, and &quot;Spare Ass Annie and Other Tales&quot; (with William S. Burroughs) in 1993.

Their first live performance was on August 23, 1991 at the Kennel Club in San Francisco.
The group was associated with contemporary bands, including House of Pain and Pop Will Eat Itself. They also were somewhat reminiscent of Gil Scott-Heron due to the half-spoken vocal styles of Franti and the up-front political messages in the music. The Disposable Heroes played many concerts, sometimes opening the bill for more well-known acts such as U2 (on their landmark Zoo TV Tour), Rage Against the Machine, Nirvana and Arrested Development. Guitarist Charlie Hunter made his recording debut with the Disposable Heroes before earning fame in jazz.

==Career==
Michael Franti and Rono Tse had both been members of industrial hip hop band The Beatnigs, which released one album on Alternative Tentacles and undertook several international tours before breaking up.

Explaining the name of the new group, The Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy, Franti said in 1992 that 
:&quot;If you&#x27;re a young black person, your only role models are athletes and entertainers. You see these people used by the corporate system to make money, after which they&#x27;re thrown on the scrap heap. they&#x27;re disposable heroes...the name Hiphoprisy deals with the fact that, inevitably, there is hypocrisy in all of our lives, including mine&quot;

Their debut album, &quot;Hypocrisy Is the Greatest Luxury&quot;, received critical and underground acclaim upon its release in 1992, but was not commercially successful. Franti&#x27;s lyrics address a wide range of social issues, from Mass Media bias and abuse (&quot;Television, the Drug of the Nation&quot;) to racial equality (&quot;Socio-Genetic Experiment&quot;, in large part inspired by Franti&#x27;s childhood as a biracial child adopted by a white family), and Homophobia (in &quot;Language of Violence&quot;). The album also included a cover of the Dead Kennedys track &quot;California über alles&quot; (with updated lyrics about Governor Pete Wilson). &quot;Television,&quot; which received wide airplay on college and alternative radio stations, had previously been recorded by Michael Franti&#x27;s first band, The Beatnigs. In common with other bands of the time on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, the Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy used sampling and scratching as a primary tool of music recording, and mixed rock, hip hop and jazz. The album was listed in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

Among their contemporaries, the band had strong artistic, political, and personal ties to both Meat Beat Manifesto and Consolidated. The recording of &quot;Hypocrisy is the Greatest Luxury&quot; was co-produced by Consolidated&#x27;s Mark Pistel, and prolific Meat Beat Manifesto frontman Jack Dangers assisted with mixing.

In 1993, the duo worked with William S. Burroughs, recording music for a collaborative album entitled &quot;Spare Ass Annie and Other Tales&quot;. This album diverged greatly from the style of the band&#x27;s previous work, as they were largely providing musical background and accompaniment to Burroughs&#x27; spoken readings from several of his books. The Disposable Heroes split up shortly after.

Peter Jenner, who had managed Pink Floyd and The Clash, managed the group.

==Legacy==
Michael Franti later formed Spearhead, while Tse worked with the Mystik Journeymen. In 1995, Franti said of Spearhead &quot;The big problem with Disposable Heroes was that it was a record people listened to because it was good for them - kind of like broccoli. I want Spearhead to be more like sweet potatoes.&quot;

The style of turntablism developed by the Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy was influential on DJ Product©1969, who credited his work, including as a member of the rap rock band Hed PE, as being influenced by Disposable Heroes.

&quot;Television, the Drug of The Nation&quot; was listed at number 401 on NME&#x27;s &quot; The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot; in 2014.

<text>The Wondermints are an American rock band from Los Angeles that released four studio albums between 1995 and 2002. The main line-up consisted of Darian Sahanaja (keyboards); Nick Walusko (also known as Nicky Wonder; guitar), and Mike D&#x27;Amico (percussion). The band members are also known for serving as part of the backing band for Brian Wilson since 1999. Other contributors to the Wondermints have included Brian Kassan (bass), David Nolte (bass) and Probyn Gregory (various).

==History==
The group formed in 1992, and released a vinyl single, &quot;Proto Pretty&quot;, which was later compiled on Rhino Records&#x27; &quot;Poptopia&quot; series of power pop compilations. They followed this with the albums &quot;Wondermints&quot; (1995), &quot;Wonderful World of the Wondermints&quot; (an album of cover versions from 1996), &quot;Bali&quot; (1998) and &quot;Mind If We Make Love to You&quot; (2002). Most of these albums were released in Japan prior to release in the United States. The group also contributed to the soundtrack of the first Austin Powers movie at the request of Mike Myers.

In 1999, the group signed on to be part of Brian Wilson&#x27;s touring band. Walusko and Gregory have played with him continuously ever since, with D&#x27;Amico only having toured with Wilson in 1999, 2000, 2002, and 2003. When D&#x27;Amico left to spend time with his family, he was replaced in 2001 and early 2002 by Andy Paley, and in 2004 by Nelson Bragg. D&#x27;Amico rejoined Wilson&#x27;s band in the summer of 2008, replacing Jim Hines on drums after relieving fellow multi-instrumentalist Scott Bennett of his temporary drumming duties. Sahanaja also missed a few shows in 2003 and 2008, being replaced by Gary Griffin, and in 2016, when Billy Hinsche took his place.

All Wondermints can be heard on Wilson&#x27;s CDs and DVDs &quot;Live at the Roxy Theatre&quot;, &quot;Brian Wilson on Tour&quot;, &quot;Pet Sounds Live&quot;, and &quot;Brian Wilson Reimagines Gershwin&quot;, with Sahanaja, Walusko, and Gregory also appearing on the &quot;Pet Sounds Live in London&quot; album and the studio albums &quot;Gettin&#x27; in Over My Head&quot;, &quot;Brian Wilson Presents Smile&quot;, &quot;That Lucky Old Sun&quot; and &quot;No Pier Pressure&quot;.

The band is part of a power pop scene in Los Angeles, many of whose members play on each other&#x27;s records. All of the members of Wondermints, especially Gregory, have made frequent guest appearances and have several side projects, some of the more notable of which are Love, The Eels, Baby Lemonade, The Negro Problem, Stew and Kim Fox.

On August 7, 2019, Walusko died at the age of 59.

<text>Edwin Emmanuel Bradford (21 August 1860 – 7 February 1944) was an English clergyman and a Uranian poet and writer of stories, articles and sermons. His prolific verse celebrating the high spiritual status of love between men and boys was remarkably well-received and favourably reviewed in his lifetime.

==Life==
===Early life and education===
Edwin Emmanuel Bradford was the eighth and youngest child of precious metal worker Edwin Greenslade Bradford, who had a business on the Strand in Torquay, and Maria Wellman. His mother died in 1873 when he was twelve or thirteen. The next year his father, much altered since his wife&#x27;s death, committed suicide. The young Bradford attended Castle College, a high-class preparatory school in Torquay, and matriculated at Exeter College, Oxford in 1881. He was awarded a Third Class honours B.A. in Theology in 1884, an M.A. in 1901, a Bachelor of Divinity degree in 1904 and, for a thesis arguing that Saint Paul contradicts himself on the subject of free will, a Doctor of Divinity degree in 1912. He referred back to the university later to express an egalitarian view: &quot;And to this day, I&#x27;m proud to say, my dear old &quot;alma mater&quot; / Cares little if you&#x27;re rich or poor, or who may be your &quot;pater&quot;!&quot;

===Church appointments===

Appointed deacon in 1884, Bradford was ordained as a priest the following year. He served curacies at High Ongar (1884-6) and Walthamstow (St Saviour&#x27;s, 1887), was assistant chaplain to the English church in Saint Petersburg, Russia (1887-9) and was assistant curate of St George&#x27;s Church in rue Auguste Vacquerie, Paris (1890-9). After his years in Paris he would continue to enjoy conversing in French.

Back in England he was curate at Eton (1899-1905) and Upwell (Christchurch, 1905-9) before being appointed, on the nomination of Christchurch rector Charles Francis Townley, vicar of Holy Trinity church in the small country parish of Nordelph, Norfolk in 1909. He played the organ himself. Next to the vicarage he had the village boys dig out a swimming pool and pile the soil in the form of small mountains, to recreate his impression of Switzerland during a visit. He allowed his goats to graze around, placed statuettes of lions around the pool and was able to contemplate the young swimmers from his house. The vicarage was hung with many pictures, including reproductions of works by Henry Scott Tuke and a reproduction of &quot;The Two Princes Edward and Richard in the Tower&quot; by John Everett Millais.

Bradford told the poet John Betjeman, who visited him in Nordelph in 1935, that his last boyfriend was called Edmund and that he had not had a boyfriend for thirty years. He spoke out in favour of birth control and masturbation and said he thought the laws against sexuality were wicked, cruel and out of date. He declared himself to be very happy with his Nordelph curacy. In 1940, he was fined for allowing light to be displayed from his house in contravention of the wartime blackout. He remained unmarried and lived at the Nordelph vicarage with at least two successive housekeepers until his death in 1944, bequeathing his effects to his last housekeeper, Sarah Esther Beales. His death took place at the vicarage and he was buried in Nordelph.

Soil subsidence was a constant problem in Nordelph, and the vicarage was propped up already in Bradford&#x27;s time. The church, having become structurally unsafe, was demolished in 2010.

Early in life Bradford was an Anglo-Catholic, but he subsequently became a Modernist, albeit one who liked ritual. In his poetry and elsewhere he made clear his opposition to drinking and gambling.

===Social circle===
Bradford was a lifelong friend of poet and priest Samuel Elsworth Cottam, with whom he had been an undergraduate classmate and who he had met again at the Anglican church in Paris, where they were both curates. Bradford&#x27;s friends and acquaintances, often found in Uranian circles, further included Edward Carpenter, George Cecil Ives, John Leslie Barford (&quot;Philebus&quot;), Leonard Henry Green, Horatio Brown, John Betjeman and W. H. Auden. Betjeman stated in a footnote to his poem &quot;A Shropshire Lad&quot; that its opening line, &quot;The gas was on in the Institute,&quot; was derived from a line in Bradford&#x27;s novel in verse &quot;Boyhood&quot;. Auden referenced Bradford and Bradford&#x27;s friend Cottam in his long poem &quot;Letter to Lord Byron&quot;: &quot;The most I ask is leave to share a pew / With Bradford or with Cottam, that will do&quot;.

==Writings==
===Poetry===

The most prolific of Uranian authors, Bradford was principally a poet. Between 1908 and 1930 twelve collections of his poetry were published by Kegan Paul in London. The first collection, with a print run of five hundred copies, was financed by Bradford, subsequent volumes paying their way.

In 2021, Bradford&#x27;s own copies of his poetry books were acquired for the library of his alma mater, Exeter College. They contain his copious handwritten notes, including copied comments from admirers or critics which demonstrate the closeness of the Uranian circle. Some of Bradford&#x27;s notes are in a private code as yet uncracked.

====Themes====
Extolling the high spiritual status of romantic love between men and boys, Bradford advocates a new chivalry that transcends boundaries of class; an aristocracy of lofty friendship that does not depend on pedigree. His poetry provides a particularly English and Christian take on the love of boys: &quot;Is Boy-Love Greek? Far off across the seas / The warm desire of Southern men may be: / But passion freshened by a Northern breeze / Gains in male vigour and in purity. / Our yearning tenderness for boys like these / Has more in it of Christ than Socrates.&quot;

For Bradford, the love of mankind and of beauty on earth is inseparable from the love of God, as he explained in a letter to Leonard Green: &quot;the beauty of Nature &quot;suggests&quot; what He is like ... and the beauty of His children gives us an idea of His beauty.&quot; His hope was to experience in heaven &quot;the growth of love on earth begun&quot;, as well as &quot;closer ties to God and man / Which never shall be riven!&quot;

However, this interpretation of beauty and love as linked to the divine does not lead him to reject the physical in favour of an exclusively spiritual love: &quot;&quot;The mere word &quot;carnal&quot; shall not me affright; / Nor will I cease, in Puritans&#x27; despite, / To love the boyish body with the sprite, / And hymn it too.&quot;&quot; Moreover, rather than expressing abstracted reflection, Bradford&#x27;s &quot;poetry of action&quot; often describes concrete events and dramatic situations. This goes so far as to include the frequent use of personal names, the poems describing the narrator&#x27;s dealings with a myriad of boys such as Eddie Worth, Merrivale White, Leslie de Lampton, Clinton Fane, Merivale Trelawney Bates, Steve Ailwyn, Our Jack, Will, Eric, Aubrey, Silvester, Joe and Jim, and so on.

Bradford&#x27;s work can just barely be interpreted as a sign of nonsexual romantic friendship with youths (&quot;Nay, boys need love, but not the love of woman: / Romantic friendship, passionate but pure, / Should be their first-love&quot;), but several verses, such as &quot;The Bather in the Blue Grotto at Capri&quot; and &quot;Alan&quot;, are plainly erotically inspired. Many of his poems are direct though sometimes self-effacing pleas of love to the young males in his life. In Bradford&#x27;s own words: &quot;Here&#x27;s a loyal and a loving heart, / Take it, lad, or leave it.&quot;

====Style====
Poetic forms employed by Bradford include the narrative ballad, ballad dialogues, Browningesque dramatic monologues and verse resembling the classic Horatian style of A. E. Housman&#x27;s &quot;A Shropshire Lad&quot;. A brisk, unencumbered tone and an undertone of irony mark him out as a modern poet.

The atmosphere of his poetry ranges from vigorous, cheerful Edwardian charm, described as &quot;Hinge and Bracket meet John Betjeman&quot;, to sensuous poetry reminiscent of &quot;the languid, sun-drenched style of the painter Henry Scott Tuke&quot;. In a characterisation of the ambience of his verse, Paul I. Webb writes: &quot;We follow him on moonlit assignations, don our boaters for picnics on the beach, and live – in our imaginations – in a world where the most passionate feelings are expressed by meaningful looks over the Earl Grey and Bath Olivers.&quot;

While optimistic in the main, Bradford occasionally turns polemic, as when he attacks some of the motivations for procreation: &quot;Breed on with fury; pour your children in / Till every shop and factory be full, / And labour cheap. What if they&#x27;re starved and thin? / — I have no heart to procreate / Earth children for the sword: / The Love that links me to my mate, / Himself is his reward.&quot;

====Reception====
Bradford&#x27;s outspokenly and unapologetically homoerotic verse was well-received and favourably reviewed in major newspapers and journals during his lifetime – remarkably so, given the public hostility to homosexuality. Reasons for its widespread favourable reception may include a naïve or Platonic reading of the friendships extolled, as well as the prevalent esteem for a classical education, which gave an air of scholarship and respect to homosexuality as expressed in the rarefied world of poetry. In contrast, however, to the classical inspiration of much Uranian poetry, Bradford mostly eschewed mythological allusions and focused on contemporary life: &quot;Talk about the Greeks&#x27; impeccability of form: / Give to me a Belton boy whose flesh and blood are warm.&quot;

Quite independently from their subject matter, the upbeat self-confidence of his poems resonated with the age: &quot;At once scholarly in their rhythmical craftsmanship and cheering in their fresh and vigorous eloquence, the work [&quot;The Romance of Youth and Other Poems&quot;] will please any earnest-minded reader in search of relief from the querulous indifference so often exemplified in contemporary verse.&quot;

Bradford&#x27;s insistence on boy love as the highest form of love, and his deprecation of things female, at times led to the charge of misogyny, as when a reviewer of his collection &quot;Passing the Love of Women&quot;, irked in particular by the lines &quot;we damn ourselves if we condemn her, / She is but meaner man&quot;, wrote: &quot;The tenor of the verses as a whole is to denounce the &quot;love of women,&quot; and from a perfectly honest belief in their inferiority. It seems to me now to be &quot;up to&quot; some feminist poet to reply.&quot; Bradford sought to defend himself against such criticisms by penning the poem &quot;No Misogynist&quot;.

The poets Auden and Betjeman were entertained by the apparent naïvety of Bradford&#x27;s poetry. However, Betjeman appreciated the poet, whom he visited in Nordelph. Lamenting that Bradford&#x27;s poetry never made it into anthologies, he made an effort to popularise it and anthologised the poem &quot;Paddy Maloy&quot;. Betjeman&#x27;s friend George Alfred Kolkhorst collected Bradford&#x27;s work. The writer Dorothy L. Sayers, whose father was vicar of Christchurch near Nordelph, called Bradford &quot;an entertaining little crank—and rather a dear&quot;, though finding his collections &quot;Passing the Love of Women&quot; and &quot;The New Chivalry&quot; unreadable. S. E. Cottam&#x27;s volume of poetry &quot;Cameos of Boyhood&quot; (1930) was noticeably imitative of Bradford&#x27;s verse and delighted the latter: &quot;I nearly always find books of verse unreadably dull. Yours is a complete exception.&quot;

Among later commentators on Bradford&#x27;s poetry, Timothy d&#x27;Arch Smith considered that his &quot;ideas were superior to his poetical abilities, but he had a good sense of rhythm and ... his verses rattle along in a breezy, unself-conscious, style&quot;. Michael Matthew Kaylor believed that in the course of his two-decade career as a published poet, Bradford had not revealed &quot;any improvement, stylistically or conceptually&quot;. Rictor Norton recommended Bradford&#x27;s poems of &quot;leaping, rollicking freedom&quot; to readers with &quot;a penchant for good old-fashioned apple pandowdy like auntie used to make&quot;. Paul I. Webb found the poet&#x27;s enthusiasms to be catching, noting that it is his &quot;ability to reach out to us that makes Bradford so likeable a character, and which gives his poetry more depth than just a collection of amusingly camp pieces&quot;.

Bradford was involved with the production of the first and only issue of &quot;The Quorum. A Magazine of Friendship&quot;, one of the earliest attempts at establishing a British homosexual magazine, which was privately published and circulated in 1920 as a specimen copy to the members of the British Society for the Study of Sex Psychology. The issue opened out with his poem &quot;Friendship and Love&quot;, which concludes: &quot;Which is most dear? Nay, they are one in root: / Love is the blossom, Friendship is the fruit.&quot;

===Prose===

Bradford wrote stories of adventure, travel and school life for such magazines as &quot;The Captain&quot;, &quot;Chatterbox&quot; and &quot;The Boy&#x27;s Own Paper&quot;. He published a collection of articles about gallant chaps at the main public schools of England, &quot;Stories of Life at Our Great Public Schools&quot; (1908). Written in collaboration with the boys themselves, the articles initially ran through several numbers of &quot;Young England&quot;.

Bradford&#x27;s time as a chaplain in Saint Petersburg is reflected in a number of Russian-themed poems and stories. One tale set in Russia, originally printed in &quot;The Boy&#x27;s Own Paper&quot; in 1893, was posthumously published in a limited edition by Timothy d&#x27;Arch Smith (&quot;Boris Orloff: A Christmas Yarn&quot;, 1968). It is a sentimental tale of the friendship between two lads, the narrator and Arthur, the son of a Yorkshire vicar. To Arthur&#x27;s distress, the narrator is obliged to go live in Russia, where he becomes friends with a wild little Russian boy, Boris Orloff, who reminds him of his English chum.

Bradford also published a collection of sermons discussing the human character and humility (&quot;Sermon Sketches for the Sundays of the Christian Year&quot;, 1907).

<text>Petr Pravec (born September 17, 1967) is a Czech astronomer and a discoverer of minor planets, born in Třinec, Czech Republic.

Pravec is a prolific discoverer of binary asteroids, expert in photometric observations and rotational lightcurves at Ondřejov Observatory. He is credited by the Minor Planet Center with the discovery and co-discovery of 350 numbered minor planets, and is leading the effort of a large consortium of stations called &quot;BinAst&quot; to look for multiplicity in the near-Earth objects and inner main-belt populations.

He is a member of the &quot;Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic&quot;.

The main-belt asteroid 4790 Petrpravec, discovered by Eleanor Helin in 1988, is named after him. The official naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 20 June 1997 ().

<text>Gettin&#x27; In over My Head is the fourth studio album by American musician Brian Wilson, released June 2004 on Rhino Records. Many of the songs were reworked versions of tracks recorded for the scrapped album &quot;Sweet Insanity&quot; and the Andy Paley sessions from the 1990s. The album reached #100 in the US during a 1-week chart stay, and #53 in the UK. Critical reaction was mixed.

It features an assortment of celebrity guests such as Paul McCartney, Elton John, Eric Clapton and Carl Wilson (the latter appearing posthumously on &quot;Soul Searchin″&quot;, a rejected Beach Boys song from the Paley sessions). Peter Blake created the cover art and assigned 2004 &quot;Brian Wilson Presents Smile&quot; artist Mark London to art-direct the rest of the package.

As of 2023, the album is not available on streaming services.

==Background==


One songwriter who was reached for a collaboration was XTC&#x27;s Andy Partridge who recalled, &quot;I rang up a lot of people ... and heard quite a few stories that would put off any sane person from getting involved in the Brian Wilson camp ... They said he would call me ... either he changed his mind, or the management changed his mind, or maybe he just forgot&quot;.

==Reception==
At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from critics, &quot;Gettin&#x27; In Over My Head&quot; received an average score of 55 based on 14 reviews, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Writing in &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot;, reviewer Jackie Wilson wrote, &quot;Wilson is still frighteningly detached from the moment. ... it&#x27;s best to think of this one as a celebrity&#x27;s children&#x27;s record.&quot; Critic Robert Christgau said that the album&#x27;s only improvement on &quot;Imagination&quot; was the absence of producer Joe Thomas.

John Bush of AllMusic highlighted &quot;Soul Searchin″&quot; and the title track in what was otherwise a collection of &quot;weak songs&quot; with &quot;trite lyrics&quot;. He wrote, &quot;Whether it&#x27;s a solo composition or one written with a talented collaborator like Andy Paley, Wilson&#x27;s songs are uniformly embarrassing&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s Alexis Petridis was disappointed with the record&#x27;s &quot;musical conservatism&quot; – which be believed came out of Wilson&#x27;s self-described desperation to be considered in league with Sting, Paul Simon, and Bruce Springsteen – and wrote, &quot;The worst thing about &quot;Gettin&#x27; In Over My Head&quot; - far worse than the mediocre songs and the MOR guest appearances - is that it doesn&#x27;t sound terribly happy.&quot;

Matthew Weiner of &quot;Stylus&quot; introduced his review by declaring, &quot;It&#x27;s time to face the facts: we’re never, never, &quot;ever&quot; getting another great record out of Brian Wilson again. It&#x27;s over.&quot; He added that, given the involvement of the Wondermints and all the other musicians and songwriters Wilson could have potentially collaborated with, &quot;it&#x27;s impossible to conclude that the utter failure of &quot;Getting In Over My Head&quot; falls anywhere other than squarely on Wilson himself&quot;.

Conversely, &quot;Uncut&quot;″s reviewer said the album was &quot;the most consistent and sympathetically constructed solo album he&#x27;s made.&quot; &quot;Billboard&quot;″s review called it &quot;An unexpected but dazzling return to the top form of the later Beach Boys years.&quot;

<text>Charles W. Juels (1944 – January 21, 2009) was an American amateur astronomer and psychiatrist by profession, who became a prolific discoverer of minor planets after his retirement.

Juels was born in New York City in 1944, and grew up in Cincinnati, Ohio. In 1969 he graduated from Cincinnati College of Medicine. After his retirement as a psychiatrist in Phoenix, Arizona, he began hunting for minor planets at his private Fountain Hills Observatory, in Fountain Hills, Arizona. He quickly became noted when he was credited with the discovery of 65 numbered minor planets during the first 18 months of his short career as a discoverer of minor planets.

In total, Juels is credited by the Minor Planet Center (MPC) with the discovery of 475 minor planets made between 1999 and 2003, and ranks as one of the world&#x27;s top discoverers on the MPC charts.

In December 2002, Juels and Paulo R. Holvorcem won the &quot;Harvard–Smithsonian 2003 Comet Award&quot; for their joint charge-coupled device (CCD) electronic-camera discovery of C/2002 Y1, a near-parabolic comet.

He died on January 21, 2009, at the age of 64. The main-belt asteroid 20135 Juels, discovered by Paul G. Comba in 1996, was named in his honor. Naming citation was published on 9 March 2001 ().

== List of discovered asteroids ==
As of 2016, the MPC credits Juels with the discovery of 475 numbered minor planets, discovered between 1999 and 2003. Several of his discoveries were named after people, in particular after astronomers such as 24105 Broughton and 24101 Cassini.

<text>Paulo Renato Centeno Holvorcem (born 10 July 1967) is a Brazilian amateur astronomer and mathematician who lives in Brasília, Brazil.

He is a prolific discoverer of asteroids. He is credited by the Minor Planet Center with the discovery or co-discovery (with Charles W. Juels) of about 197 minor planets between 1998 and 2010.

Holvorcem with Juels also discovered two comets: C/2002 Y1 (Juels-Holvorcem) and C/2005 N1 (Juels-Holvorcem). Holvorcem was also involved in the discovery of C/2011 K1 (Schwartz-Holvorcem).

The main-belt asteroid 13421 Holvorcem was named after him on 9 January 2001 ().

Paulo&#x27;s SkySift pipeline software is used by many observatories across the world for the detection of minor planets and transients.

<text>Dia , also known as Jupiter LIII, is a prograde irregular satellite of Jupiter. Provisionally known as S/2000 J 11, it received its name on March 7, 2015. It is named after Dia, daughter of Deioneus (or Eioneus), wife of Ixion. According to Homer, she was seduced by Zeus in stallion form; Pirithous was the issue.

The satellite is one of several known small bodies in the Himalia group.

Dia is thought to be about 4 kilometres in diameter. It orbits Jupiter at an average distance of 12 million km in 274 days, at an inclination of 28° (to Jupiter&#x27;s equator), and with an eccentricity of 0.21.

==Observational history==

Dia was discovered by a team of astronomers from the University of Hawaii led by Scott S. Sheppard in 2000 with an observation arc of 26 days.

Initial observations were not followed up, and Dia was not observed for more than a decade after 2000. This apparent disappearance led some astronomers to consider the moon lost. One theory was that it had crashed into Himalia, creating a faint ring around Jupiter. However, it was finally recovered in observations made in 2010 and 2011.

<text>Andrea Boattini (born 16 September 1969) is an Italian astronomer and a prolific discoverer of minor planets and comets.

== Career ==

After developing a growing interest in minor planets, he graduated in 1996 from the University of Bologna with a thesis on near-Earth objects (NEOs). He is involved in various projects related to NEO follow-up and search programs, with special interest in the NEO class known as Atens.

He currently works at the Lunar and Planetary Laboratory, University of Arizona after many years spent at the Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR, National Research Council) and the Astronomical Observatory in Rome. He worked for the Catalina Sky Survey project from 2007 to 2014, in Tucson, Arizona (USA). Meanwhile, he discovered the active comets C/2007 W1 (Boattini), C/2008 J1 (Boattini), C/2008 S3 (Boattini), C/2009 P2 (Boattini), C/2009 W2 (Boattini), C/2010 F1 (Boattini), C/2010 G1 (Boattini) as well as the most distant discovery of an inbound active comet, C/2010 U3 (Boattini). He also accidentally recovered 206P/Barnard-Boattini from the Mount Lemmon Survey &quot;(also see lost comet)&quot;.

== Honors ==

Asteroid 8925 Boattini is named in his honour. The official was published by the Minor Planet Center (MPC) on 2 February 1999 ().

== List of discovered minor planets ==
Andrea Boattini is credited by the MPC with the discovery of hundreds of minor planets made between 1977 &quot;(see following comment)&quot; and 2006.

The minor planet , discovered at the Siding Spring Observatory on 17 September 1977, is credited by the MPC to Andrea Boattini and his older co-discoverer Giuseppe Forti (born 1939). However Boattini did not co-discover this asteroid on the day after his 8th birthday in 1977, but rather recovered the body from the original observations, referenced as MPS 18832, which were published by the MPC on 13 October 2000. He named the asteroids 12848 Agostino and 14973 Rossirosina, in honor of his father Agostino (born 1932) and his mother, Rosina Rossi Boattini (born 1934).

In addition to the officially discovered (i.e. numbered) minor planets, near-Earth asteroids and , first observed by Boattini in 2007 and 2012, respectively. His co-discoverers are: M. Tombelli, V. Goretti, A. Di Paola, L. Tesi, G. Forti, G. D&#x27;Abramo, F. Pedichini, A. Caronia, A. Di Clemente, F. Bernardi, V. Cecchini, H. Scholl, M. Mazzucato.

== List of discovered comets ==

Andrea Boattini has also discovered or re-discovered 25 comets &quot;(see table)&quot;.

<text>Arche , also known as &#x27;, is a moon of Jupiter. It was discovered by a team of astronomers from the University of Hawaii led by Scott S. Sheppard on 31 October 2002, and received the temporary designation &#x27;.

Arche is about 3 kilometres in diameter, and orbits Jupiter at an average distance of 23,717,000 km in 746.185 days, at an inclination of 165° to the ecliptic (162° to Jupiter&#x27;s equator), in a retrograde direction and with an eccentricity of 0.149.

It was named in 2005 after Arche, whom some Greek writers described as one of the four original Muses, an addition to the earlier three (Aoede, Melete, and Mneme).

Arche belongs to the Carme group, made up of irregular retrograde moons orbiting Jupiter at a distance ranging between 23 and 24 Gm and at an inclination of about 165°.

<text>Stephenville (Canada 2021 Census population 6,540) is a town in Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada, on the west coast of the island of Newfoundland.

The town functions as a local service centre for the southwestern part of the island, serving a direct population of 35,000 people from surrounding areas and over 100,000 people along the entire southwestern coast of the island.

The primary employer in the town was a paper mill, which closed in 2005.

Stephenville has a modern 40-bed hospital (built in 2003), schools, grocery stores, a movie theatre, four banks, an International Airport (Stephenville International Airport, CYJT, now named Dymond International Airport), year round ice free sea port (Port Harmon), and many government institutions. The provincial community college system, College of the North Atlantic, is headquartered in Stephenville and maintains a campus there for students from the southwestern region of the island. The Newfoundland and Labrador Public Library system is also headquartered in Stephenville. A provincial minimum/medium security facility was established in 1978 and provides core programs for federal and provincial offenders at the West Coast Corrections Centre (W.C.C.C)

==History==

The Stephenville area was formerly known as the Acadian village, between 1848 and 1870. The populace of the village consisted of Roman Catholics who eked out a living, farming and fishing. The town&#x27;s population continued to grow because of the stable economy. It was also formerly home to Ernest Harmon AFB, which was operated by the United States Army Air Forces and later the United States Air Force from 1941 to 1966.

The base precipitated an economic boom of sorts on Newfoundland&#x27;s southwest coast during the 1940s. Corner Brook to the northeast had been considered the major population center for the region, given its industrial base and nearby recreational opportunities in the Humber River. With the massive investment of the Government of the United States in the base, the Stephenville and St. George&#x27;s Bay area began to flourish. The village of Stephenville grew from a hamlet of several hundred people with no paved streets, sidewalks, water or sewage system in 1941 into a modern town of over 5,000 by the mid-1950s. By the time Ernest Harmon AFB closed in 1966, the town had more than doubled in size, partly as a result of the provincial government&#x27;s forced resettlement policy toward residents of outports.

After the base was closed, the facility was turned over to the federal government which then provided it to the provincial government to diversify the local community.

The facility included the air field, which has two runways (10,000 ft x 200 ft, 4,000 ft x 150 ft) and numerous buildings which are operated as the Stephenville International Airport. An abandoned USAF Pinetree Line radar site is located on nearby Table Mountain, north of the town. The town uses many former USAF structures for housing, recreation and entertainment.

In 2005, Abitibi closed the town&#x27;s pulp and paper mill. At the time of closure the mill had approximately 300 full-time and part-time employees.

== Transportation ==

The Stephenville International Airport, formerly Ernest Harmon AFB, serves a small portion of the west coast of the island; weekly summer air service is offered to Toronto Pearson with Sunwing Airlines, twice weekly international flights are offered to Saint-Pierre et Miquelon, France, in February, June and August with Air Saint Pierre,

Daily intraprovincial bus service connecting to major population centres and ferry terminals across the island is provided by DRL Coachlines. Dedicated bus service between Stephenville and Corner Brook is provided by Eddy&#x27;s Bus Services. Dedicated bus service between Stephenville and Port aux Basques is provided by Gateway Bus Service.

Three taxi companies serve the town: Crown Taxi, Blue Bird Taxi, and King&#x27;s Cab.

The town is located 15 kilometres northwest of the Trans-Canada Highway, and is accessible using Provincial Highway Routes 490 and 460.

Rail service to the town, as well as all of Newfoundland, was discontinued by Terra Transport in 1988.

The density of the town core, and its flat topography, permit residents to enjoy outdoor activities such as walking, bicycling, roller blading, and cross-country skiing.

==Education==

The first educational institution in the Bay St. George area was the Roman Catholic Church. Bishop John T. Mullock established the first church of the Roman Catholic faith at Sandy Point in 1848 when the population of the area was about 2,000. Father Belenger was the first priest in the St. Georges Bay area from 1850 to 1868. Father Sears, then priest in the area, established a church in the growing town of Stephenville. In 1884, there were four Catholic schools in the parish, one at Sandy Point, one at the Highlands, one at Port aux Basques and one at Campbell&#x27;s Creek.

Today, Stephenville is served by four schools: Stephenville Primary, Stephenville Elementary and Stephenville Middle Schools, which are feeder schools for Stephenville High School, SHS also takes in students from St. Thomas Aquinas School in Port-au-Port East.

Stephenville is also home to the Bay St. George campus of College of the North Atlantic (CNA), which is Newfoundland and Labrador&#x27;s public college system. The provincial Headquarters for CNA is located in the D.S.B Fowlow Building of the campus.

Western College is also located in Stephenville. Formerly known as CompuCollege, the Western College is an affiliate of Eastern College.

== Geography ==
The town is located on the northeast coast of Bay St. George in southwestern Newfoundland, and on the Atlantic Ocean. It is situated on a small plateau and surrounded by the Long Range Mountains and Lewis Hills on either side. The downtown area lies to the north of the Stephenville International Airport, and the rest of the town expands primarily to the northwest.

The town is bisected by Blanche Brook, a small river which runs roughly north to south before meeting Warm Brook, which flows roughly east to west, before both empty in Bay St. George. The original town of Stephenville is situated on the west side of the brook while the east side consists of the area which was once part of Ernest Harmon Air Force Base. There are 4 bridges which span Blanche Brook: Hansen Highway Bridge, Blanche Brook Bridge (Main Street), Columbus Bridge (Minnesota Drive) and the newest West Street Bridge built after the 2005 flood. 3 smaller bridges span Warm Brook, located at: Mississippi Drive, Carolina Avenue and Connecticut Drive. Another waterway, Gaudon&#x27;s Brook, forms the western border with Kippens.

The brooks have been used to create a greenbelt/park area that extends through the centre of town, including Blanche Brook Park which was constructed following the destruction of a neighbourhood which formerly occupied the same space.

===Climate===
Stephenville has a maritime-influenced humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dfb&quot;). While continental patterns dominate with vast seasonal differences and extremely snowy winters, seasonal lag is prevalent as a result of the seawater warming slowly. As a result, summer normals peak in August, with September being warmer than June in spite of the rapidly descending sun strength. Winters are dominated by the high snowfall, but also can see rainy spells during milder weather, which can occur year-round.

==Demographics==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Stephenville had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

==Arts and entertainment==

There are numerous bars and pubs operating in Stephenville. The nightlife caters to a diverse population including students attending both College of the North Atlantic and Western College in town. Live entertainment can be found most nights of the week in at least one location. On weekends, DJs are in house at several nightclubs which have also played host to upcoming DJs and performers from cities such as Montreal and Toronto, while other locations host well-known local performers.

The Bay St. George Folk Arts Council hosts a monthly &quot;Folk Night&quot; at Emile&#x27;s Pub in downtown Stephenville. The Council promotes local folk artists who work in both the visual arts and in music.

Each summer, the Stephenville Theatre Festival produces high quality professional productions that have attracted visitors from all over Canada and the United States and has been reviewed by publications such as the New York Times. The festival employs upwards of 70 people and is the premiere tourist attraction for the island&#x27;s southwest coast. The festival performs at the Stephenville Arts and Culture Centre, the second largest of the six arts centres throughout the province. The centre contains a 450-seat main theatre, a 150-seat secondary theatre and an art exhibition area in a building that was once The Service Club on the Ernest Harmon Air Force Base.

Following in Stephenville&#x27;s strong theatre history and culture, the 2nd Stage Players provide year-round theatre productions put off by locals. The troupe was started by well-known Newfoundland theatre figure Jerry Doyle, who has also initiated acting workshops for youth and adults alike.

The newly renovated Stephenville Cinema is one of only two movie theatres remaining on the west coast of Newfoundland. In its heyday it played host to the likes of Bob Hope, Mae West and Frank Sinatra. Today it hosts big Hollywood titles.

==Sports and recreation==

The town has numerous indoor and outdoor recreation opportunities. Various schools have public gymnasiums and there are private recreation and fitness facilities in the town and surrounding areas. Stephenville often hosts atlantic, provincial, and regional championships in sports such as curling, hockey, cross-country skiing, soccer, and more.

The International Appalachian Trail has been extended through the area, providing a continuous recreational hiking trail along the Long Range Mountains. The abandoned railway corridors of the Newfoundland Railway have also been designated the &quot;T&#x27;railway Provincial Park&quot;, providing a level wilderness trail for bicycling and walking.

Within the town itself, the Walk-a-Ways Trail System offers takes pedestrians throughout the town, from the Base, to Port Harmon, into the downtown and to the fossil forest at its northern terminus. The trail links all of Stephenville&#x27;s recreation areas and complexes including Bike lanes, several soccer fields, baseball and softball diamonds and tennis courts.

The town also has an 18-hole links golf course that was expanded from a 9-hole course in 1999. The course was originally built by the United States Air Force. The former Caribou Club on the base was converted into a 4 sheet curling rink in the 1970s and retains its original name: The Caribou Curling Club.

The Stephenville Dome is home to the &quot;Stephenville Lightning&quot; hockey team of the Central West Senior Hockey league and is the main ice rink for the Bay St. George region, boasting an Olympic-size ice surface and seating for approximately 1,200 patrons. The rink plays host to hockey, figure skating, broomball, general skating, home shows, conventions and concerts. Along with the Pepsi Centre in Corner Brook, the Stephenville Dome co-hosted the 1999 Canada Winter Games and housed events such as figure skating and speedskating. Meanwhile, the Regional Aquatic Centre provides residents with a full range of aquatic activities. This modern swimming facility built in 1995 includes a regulation sized pool, kiddie pool, hot tub, and water slide.

In addition to privately owned fitness centres, the YMCA has a facility in Stephenville. The West Coast Training Centre, a facility featuring numerous amenities such as a gymnasium, weight room, steam room, squash courts, multi-purpose rooms, and office/meeting space was slated to be closed by provincial government as a cost-cutting measure in 2013. The town assumed ownership of the facility shortly afterward and reached an operation agreement with the YMCA. The organization operates a renovated, modern facility with space for sports such as basketball, volleyball, martial arts, as well as fitness classes and include workout space.

<text>Luciano Tesi (; born 10 December 1931) is an Italian veterinarian, amateur astronomer, discoverer of many minor planets, and director of the San Marcello Pistoiese Observatory.

In 1980, he founded the &quot;Amateur Group of Pistoiese Mountain&quot; (). Later on, this resulted in the construction of the Pistoia Mountains Astronomical Observatory. As the director of the observatory, he has collaborated with many discoverers in following up near-Earth objects and in finding minor planets since 1994.

The near-Earth object and Amor asteroid, 15817 Lucianotesi, discovered by Andrea Boattini and Maura Tombelli at San Marcello Pistoiese in 1994, was named in his honor.

== Discoveries ==
Luciano Tesi is credited by the Minor Planet Center (MPC) with the discovery of many numbered minor planets since 1994 &quot;(see table)&quot;, mostly in collaboration with several other astronomers. Together with Giancarlo Fagioli, he also discovered the main-belt asteroid 280641 Edosara, which was erroneously credited to &quot;T. esi&quot; by the MPC. Co-discoveries made by Tesi/Fagioli appear as 3 separate records in the MPC&#x27;s List of &quot;Minor Planet Discoverers&quot;.

<text>Eupheme , also Jupiter LX, originally known as , is an outer natural satellite of Jupiter, 2 km in diameter.

==Discovery==
It was discovered by a team of astronomers from the University of Hawaii led by Scott S. Sheppard in 2003. The moon was lost following its discovery in 2003. It was recovered in 2017 and given its permanent designation that year. 

==Name==
It was named in 2019 after Eupheme, the ancient Greek spirit of words of good omen, praise, acclaims, shouts of triumph, and applause, the daughter of Hephaestus and Aglaea and granddaughter of Zeus. The name was suggested by Twitter user Lunartic (@iamalunartic) in a naming contest held by the Carnegie Institute on the social network who concurrently helped in naming another Jovian moon Philophrosyne.

==Orbit==
Eupheme orbits Jupiter at an average distance of 19,622 Mm in 628.06 days, at an inclination of 146° to the ecliptic (146° to Jupiter&#x27;s equator), in a retrograde direction and with an eccentricity of 0.2507. It belongs to the Ananke group, retrograde irregular moons that orbit Jupiter between 19.3 and 22.7 Gm, at inclinations of roughly 150°.

<doc id="760295" wikidata="Q6234801" url="?curid=760295" title="John Gambril Nicholson">
<text>John Gambril (Francis) Nicholson (1866–1931) was an English school teacher, poet, and amateur photographer. He was one of the Uranians, a clandestine group of British men who wrote poetry idealizing the beauty and love of adolescent boys. As a school master at various boarding schools in England and Wales, Nicholson formed &quot;passionate friendships&quot; with some of his students, and dedicated much of his poetry to favoured students.

==Biography==
John Gambrill Nicholson (the Francis was added later and the -ll / -l spelling varied over the years) was born in Essex in 1866. He was educated locally at the King Edward VI Grammar School, Chelmsford, where one of his teachers was Frederick Rolfe, a gay man who would go on to a career as a noted novelist and artist. He studied at Oxford University before entering upon his career as an English Master at various schools in England and Wales: at Buxton (1884–7); Ashton (1887–8); Rydal Mount School, Colwyn Bay (1888–94), where he also coached the football team; Arnold House School, Chester (1894–6); and Stationers&#x27; School, Hornsey, north London (1896–1925, retired).

Nicholson was a member of the Order of Chaeronea, a secret society for homosexuals founded in 1897 by fellow Uranian George Ives. He was also an officer of the British Society for the Study of Sex Psychology, an organization founded in 1913 and largely devoted to the study and defense of homosexuality.

Nicholson was an amateur photographer of boys, apparently inspired by the work of Wilhelm von Gloeden.

==Writing==
Havelock Ellis wrote that Nicholson&#x27;s verse showed “delicate charm combined with high technical skill.”

Nicholson&#x27;s first book of poems &quot;Love in Earnest&quot; (1892) was dedicated to the memory of his mother, but the first section, a sequence of 50 numbered sonnets (which open with &quot;Some lightly love, but mine is Love in Earnest -/My heart is ever faithful while it hears/An echo of itself in thine, though years/Should pass ere its full passion thou returnest&quot;), was dedicated to &quot;W.E.M.&quot; This was the flaxen-haired blue-eyed William Ernest Mather (1877–99)—second son of Sir William Mather—a pupil of his at Rydal Mount School 1888–90, who died young after being thrown from his horse. A photograph of Nicholson with Ernest, taken at Llandudno in June 1889, was published in &quot;The Book Collector&quot; (Summer 1978).

&quot;Love in Earnest&quot; attracted the notice of the Uranian poets, including John Addington Symonds, and it is believed to have contributed to the use of &quot;earnest&quot; as a coded term for homosexuality among Uranians. Some scholars have speculated that Oscar Wilde exploited this allusion in his 1895 play &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot;.

In 1894, Nicholson contributed &quot;The Shadow of the End&quot;, an &quot;intensely poetic prose meditation&quot; on the death of a beloved boy, to the sole issue of the Uranian magazine &quot;The Chameleon&quot;. He also contributed a poem on the topic of nude bathing for the April 1894 issue of &quot;The Artist and Journal of Home Culture&quot;.

Nicholson&#x27;s second volume of poetry &quot;A Chaplet of Southernwood&quot; (1896), celebrated the beauty of another Rydal Mount pupil (1891–94), William Alexander (Alec) Melling (1878–1962).

A third volume of verses &quot;A Garland of Ladslove&quot; (subtitled &quot;Verses for Victor / To F.V.R. / (1902–1910)&quot;) was written for Frank Victor Rushforth (1888–1945), who entered the Indian Civil Service after university. As Timothy d&#x27;Arch Smith writes: &quot;Nicholson&#x27;s friendship with Victor began when the boy was thirteen. It was not altogether a happy relationship for it laboured under the usual difficulty that the boy was not able to respond to the ardour of Nicholson&#x27;s passion.&quot; &quot;Southernwood&quot; and &quot;Ladslove&quot; are alternative English names for the aromatic plant from southern Europe &quot;Artemisia abrotanum&quot;.

===&quot;The Romance of a Choir-Boy&quot;===

Nicholson&#x27;s semi-autobiographical novel &quot;The Romance of a Choir-Boy&quot; was written between 1896 and 1905 but not published until privately printed in 1916. In it his &quot;alter ego&quot; protagonist Philip Luard chastely pursues the unresponsive twelve-year-old Teddy Faircloth of the title, despite his friend Gerrard urging him to a more sensual approach. The novel ends with the quotation: &quot;Physical intimacies are but surface emotions, forgotten as soon as they are satisfied; whereas spiritual intimacies live in the heart, they are part of our eternal life, and reach beyond the stars.&quot; It was reprinted in 2013.

<text>Eirene , also Jupiter LVII and originally known as , is a retrograde irregular satellite of Jupiter. It was discovered by a team of astronomers from the University of Hawaii led by Scott S. Sheppard in 2003
but was then lost. It was recovered in 2017 and given its permanent designation that year.

==Characteristics==
Eirene is about 4 kilometres in diameter, and orbits Jupiter at an average distance of 23,974,000 km in 743.88 days, at an inclination of 166° to the ecliptic (167° to Jupiter&#x27;s equator), in a retrograde direction and with an eccentricity of 0.307.

It belongs to the Carme group, made up of irregular retrograde moons orbiting Jupiter at a distance ranging between 23 and 24 Gm and at an inclination of about 165°.

==Name==
The moon was named in 2019 after Eirene (Εἰρήνη), the daughter of Zeus and Themis and the goddess of peace in Greek mythology; the name originated from a naming contest held on Twitter with sixteen tweets suggesting the name, most significantly by users Quadrupoltensor (@Quadrupoltensor) who first suggested the name and PaulR (@PJRYYC).

<doc id="760298" wikidata="Q16237738" url="?curid=760298" title="International Workers Order">
<text>The International Workers Order (IWO) was an insurance, mutual benefit and fraternal organization founded in 1930 and disbanded in 1954 as the result of legal action undertaken by the state of New York in 1951 on the grounds that the organization was too closely linked to the Communist Party. At its height in the years immediately following World War II, the IWO reached nearly 200,000 members and provided low-cost health and life insurance, medical and dental clinics, and supported foreign-language newspapers, cultural and educational activities. The organization also operated a summer camp and cemeteries for its members.

==Organizational history==

===Factional war in the &quot;Arbeter Ring&quot; (1920s)===

The International Workers Order began as the byproduct of a split of The Workmen&#x27;s Circle (&quot;Der Arbeter Ring&quot;, now called The Workers Circle), a Jewish mutual benefit society of social democratic coloration. Principal functions of the Workmen&#x27;s Circle included the provision of unemployment insurance, medical insurance, and life insurance for its members, as well as providing a setting for the discussion of social problems at its meetings. During the factionally charged political climate of the American Left in the 1920s, a parallel Communist fraternal benefit society emerged—the IWO.

The origins of the split that established the IWO date back to 1922. In February of that year, a nominating conference of the &quot;Arbeter Ring&quot; was held, at which a new Executive Committee was to be nominated. Nearly 200 delegates attended this conference, which was dominated by adherents of the Socialist Party of America (SPA), who prevented adherents of the Communist movement from gaining a single seat on the Credentials Committee. A spontaneous walkout of Left Wing delegates resulted.

In May 1922 the Workmen&#x27;s Circle held its 22nd Convention at Toronto. This gathering was attended by 26 Left Wing delegates out of a total of 138. These two fractions battled over two resolutions of the Executive Committee: one against Soviet Russia for its judicial action against the Socialist Revolutionaries and other political opponents of the regime, and a second directed against the Workers Party of America and its Yiddish language organ, the &quot;Morgen Freiheit&quot; (Morning Freedom). While the SPA-influenced delegates held the day, a &quot;Protest Convention&quot; quickly organized in response to the resolutions of the 22nd Convention. This was held on June 2, 1922, and attended by 338 delegates, representing 235 branches of the organization from 23 states.

The National Executive Committee of the Workmen&#x27;s Circle struck back, dissolving the Left Wing-dominated Boston District Committee and removing several Left Wingers from positions of authority in the organization. The Left Wing found itself in a majority position in Minnesota, Missouri, Virginia, Texas, and Ontario, inspiring the National Executive Committee to dissolve the five state organizations, as well as various Left Wing branches. Despite the rough treatment, the Left Wing resisted splitting the organization, instead opting to continue its fight within the Workman&#x27;s Circle organization itself. This tactic was followed through 1925.

The 1925 Convention of the Arbeter Ring was particularly bitter. Nearly 1,000 delegates were in attendance, of whom approximated one-fourth supported a program of the Left Wing calling for the Workmen&#x27;s Circle to become an actively political organization. The Left Wing fought relentlessly to win the right to read a 10-minute statement to the convention, declaring that &quot;to our shame, the Workmen&#x27;s Circle, our Order, lately has become and out-and-out toll and weapon in the hands of the reactionary element in the Jewish working class movement.&quot; A two-day &quot;National Protest Conference&quot; was held in response to the Socialist-dominated convention, which was attended by the representatives of 191 branches. The conference organized itself into a &quot;Left Wing Alliance&quot; and declared that it would fight &quot;against the terror of the Right Wing machine&quot; and &quot;for the non-party [i.e. non-Socialist Party] character of the Workmen&#x27;s Circle.&quot; Aid to the children&#x27;s school movement, a pet project of the Left, was pledged.

The National Executive Committee of the Workmen&#x27;s Circle responded to the organization of the Left Wing Alliance predictably, expelling 64 branches with a membership of close to 15,000. This put the Executive Committee of the Alliance in a precarious situation. Rather than risk &quot;suicide&quot; through a premature split, the Executive Committee instructed its branches to comply with various requests of the NEC to resign from the Alliance or be expelled. A split was thereby narrowly averted. The NEC adopted a lengthy process for reinstatement of expelled branches, drawing out the process over months and demoralizing the Left Wing.

As the Communist movement became more radical at the end of the 1920s, following the doctrine of the so-called Third Period of new revolutionary upheaval, the bad marriage of Socialists and Communists in the Arbeter Ring crashed upon the rocks. The 1929 Convention attempted to eliminate the Left Wing from participation. The gathering was addressed by a guest speaker, Victor Chernov, leader of the Russian Socialist Revolutionary Party (PSR), considered a notorious counterrevolutionary by the Communists of the day. In the supercharged environment, it was charged that a physical attack was made on the reporter of the Communist Party&#x27;s Yiddish daily, the &quot;Freiheit.&quot; The convention renewed the two controversial Toronto resolutions of 1922 and formally approved the action of the NEC in suppressing the Left Wing movement in the Workmen&#x27;s Circle.

A split was at hand. On October 11, 1929, a three-day &quot;National Conference of Minority Groups of the Workmen&#x27;s Circle&quot; gathered in New York City, attended by 193 delegates, representing 108 branches and 23 minority factions of branches. These delegates unanimously decided to leave the Workmen&#x27;s Circle and build a new explicitly working class order. A manifesto issued by the conference declared:

&quot;The time has come when everyone who takes the interests of the workers seriously must shake off the dust of the Workmen&#x27;s Circle. The Workmen&#x27;s Circle, originally organized under the banner of the class struggle, writing into its program the abolition of the capitalist order...has been transformed in the past few years into an instrument of capitalist politics.

&quot;There was not one single important occasion in the life of the Jewish workers in the last 7 or 8 years when the leadership of the Workmen&#x27;s Circle did not line up with the enemies of the working class. The counterrevolutionary physiognomy of the Workmen&#x27;s Circle is most clearly expressed in its attitude toward the Soviet Union, the only proletarian state in the world, the pride and crown of achievement of all class conscious workers throughout the entire world.&quot;
===Establishment of the IWO===

The first General Secretary of the IWO was Rubin Saltzman and the first President was William Weiner, both &quot;open and prominent&quot; members of the Communist Party USA.

The IWO described itself in the following manner in its &quot;Declaration of Principles&quot;: 

Scholar Robert M. Zecker describes the IWO as a &quot;mutual self-insurance society.&quot; The IWO provided very low cost term life insurance, coverage which could be supplemented with additional protection against sickness. The Order did not employ sales representatives and paid no commissions on policies sold. For many, the IWO took over the social functions associated with the Communist Party&#x27;s language federations, which had lessened in importance throughout the decade of the 1920s. Different national sections of the IWO published news in their own languages, organized singing societies, sports teams, marching bands, dance companies, and theater groups.

The IWO grew rapidly, from a tiny organization of 3,000 to 5,000 members at the time of formation in 1930, the organization rocketed to a membership of 67,000 by 1935. 

By its third convention on May 6–11, 1935, Max Bedacht had become IWO general secretary. By 1938 it had grown to over 141,000.

While the IWO aggressively promoted the Communist Party&#x27;s program and policies to its members, one scholarly observer has concluded: As World War II approached, membership in the IWO continued to climb. At the end of September 1941, the organization claimed a membership of 155,000 and assets approaching $1.9 million. According to the testimony of IWO General Secretary Max Bedacht, these members had organized into over 19,000 branches and generated an income for the organization of over $1 million per year.

===Post-war years===

At its height in the years immediately following World War II, the IWO had almost 200,000 members and provided low-cost health and life insurance, medical and dental clinics, and supported foreign-language newspapers, cultural and educational activities. The IWO offered insurance to all working people at the same rate regardless of race or occupation and was, at the time, the only service provider where African Americans could obtain insurance at the same rate as others and also the only place where workers in dangerous occupations such as coal mining could obtain insurance at a rate equivalent to other occupations.

The IWO also ran a Jewish summer camp, Camp Kinderland and the racially integrated camp &quot;Wo-Chi-Ca&quot;. Additionally the IWO owned and operated cemeteries throughout the US and Canada, a common practice among left wing Jewish mutual-aid organizations like the Farband and the Workmen&#x27;s Circle.

While the leadership of IWO sections were members of the Communist Party, most of the IWO&#x27;s rank-and-file members were not party members.

The IWO was made up of a total of 15 sections, the largest section of which was the Jewish section representing one-third of the membership of the IWO and which in 1944 was renamed the Jewish People&#x27;s Fraternal Order. There was also an English section and 13 other language sections including the Hungarian Workmen&#x27;s Sick, Benevolent, and Educational Federation; the Ukrainian-American Fraternal Union; the Carpatho-Russian National Society; the (Spanish) Cervantes Society Mutualista Obrera Puertorriqueña; the (Italian) Garibaldi American Fraternal Society; the Hellenic-American Brotherhood; the Serbian-American Federation; the Russian American Mutual Aid Society; the Slovak Workers Society; the Polonia Society; the Rumanian American Fraternal Society; the Czech Workers Society and the Finnish American Mutual Aid Society (descended from the Finnish Socialist Federation).

===Demise===

As early as 1944, the Special Committee on Un-American Activities of the US House of Representatives (best known as the Dies Committee) attacked the IWO as a &quot;huge patronage machine furnishing positions for a host of Communist functionaries, who serve as the party&#x27;s controlling commissars within the organization.&quot; The Dies Committee expressed its confidence that &quot;a comparison made in each local area will bear out the charge that the personnel of the Communist Party and the International Workers Order interlock closely.&quot; In addition to General Secretaries Saltzman and Bedacht, those explicitly singled out by the Dies Committee for membership in the Communist Party while holding an executive position in the IWO were President William Weiner, Executive Secretary Herbert Benjamin, General Executive Board members Moissaye J. Olgin and Max Steinberg, and assistant to the General Secretary Rebecca Grecht, among others.

As a financial support mechanism of the Communist Party, the IWO came under concerted government attack during the Cold War which erupted following the termination of World War II. The U.S. Attorney General placed the IWO on its list of subversive organizations in 1947. Though financially solvent and conservatively managed, the New York State Insurance Department contended that, since the IWO was engaged in political activity, which was prohibited to insurance organizations, it placed its members&#x27; interests in jeopardy, leading ultimately to its liquidation in 1954 by order of the New York State Insurance Department.

==Legacy==
Following the demise of the IWO, Camp Kinderland became an independent entity and the Jewish People&#x27;s Fraternal Order reconstituted itself as the Jewish Cultural Clubs and Societies without the mutual benefit component of JPFO. A Canadian equivalent of the JPFO, the United Jewish Peoples&#x27; Order, still exists as does the Association of United Ukrainian Canadians. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the IWO received mention as a mutual aid society that might bear revisit for applicability to the growing number of gig workers, left out of a 20th-century system whose benefits to employees depends on full-time employment (also considered for mutual aid societies more broadly), though others have questioned the IWO&#x27;s contemporary relevance if based on intersectionality.&quot;

<text>Dennis di Cicco (born 1950) is an American amateur astronomer and a discoverer of minor planets, who lives in New England.

He has discovered 60 numbered asteroids from his backyard observatory in Sudbury, Massachusetts (IAU code: 817). He was a member of the editorial staff of &quot;Sky and Telescope&quot; magazine from 1974 until his resignation as senior editor in June 2014. His special interests include astronomical photography and the history of astronomical photography, telescope making, and astronomical observing. During 1978 and 1979 he was the first person to successfully photograph the analemma, making 48 separate exposures on a single piece of film during a 12-month period. The project is described in the June 1979 issue of &quot;Sky &amp; Telescope&quot;. The asteroid 3841 Dicicco was named after him.

Di Cicco conducted observations and calculations to determine the exact time and date of Ansel Adams’ famous photograph, Moonrise, Hernandez, New Mexico.

He grew up in Hanover, Massachusetts.

<text>Asgard is the second largest multi-ringed basin (large impact crater) on Jupiter&#x27;s moon Callisto. It is named after Asgard, the realm of the gods in Norse mythology. The central part of Asgard is dominated by the domed Doh impact crater.

A smaller multi-ring structure is superposed on the northern part of Asgard. It is called Utgard (also from Norse mythology) and measures around in diameter. Utgard is the fourth largest multi-ring feature on Callisto. A substantial part of the central region of Utgard is covered with deposits from the relatively young Burr crater.

<text>Han Zheng (; born 22 April 1954) is a Chinese politician who since 2023 has served as the 11th vice president of China. He previously served as the first-ranking vice premier of China between 2018 and 2023, and as the seventh-ranking member of the Politburo Standing Committee of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) between 2017 and 2022.

Han served as CCP deputy committee secretary and mayor of Shanghai between 2003 and 2012. In November 2012, he was promoted to become the CCP committee secretary of Shanghai, the top political post in the city, and also gained a seat on the CCP Politburo. In October 2017, he became a member of the 19th CCP Politburo Standing Committee, the top decision-making body in China, and in March 2018 became the first-ranked vice premier of China. During this tenure he served as the CCP&#x27;s top leader in regards to Hong Kong and Macau affairs, presiding over the government&#x27;s response to the 2019–2020 Hong Kong protests and the 2021 Hong Kong electoral changes.

Han retired from the Politburo Standing Committee, as well as the broader Central Committee after the 20th CCP National Congress in October 2022. At the 2023 National People&#x27;s Congress in March 2023, Han was elected the vice president of China and a deputy to the 14th National People&#x27;s Congress. Regarded as &quot;number eight&quot; in seniority of the leadership of China and a close adviser to president Xi Jinping, Han&#x27;s ceremonial role in the state government has focused on foreign affairs and diplomacy. He has served as president Xi&#x27;s special representative at events such as the coronation of Charles III and Camilla in 2023 and the second inauguration of Donald Trump in 2025.

==Early career==
He was born in Shanghai in April 1954, but traces his ancestry to Cixi, in neighboring Zhejiang province. He was a sent-down youth during the Cultural Revolution, working at a collective farm in Chongming County, Shanghai. He later worked at a warehouse of a lifting installation company, later working at the company&#x27;s supply and marketing division. He additionally served as a deputy secretary of the Communist Youth League of China (CYLC) between 1975 and 1980. He joined the Chinese Communist Party in 1979.

He then worked at the Shanghai Chemical Equipment Industry company in an administrative role between 1980 and 1982. He was the secretary of the CYLC committee at the Chemical Industry Bureau of the Shanghai Municipal People&#x27;s Government between 1982 and 1986, and the deputy CCP secretary of the Shanghai School of Chemical Engineering between 1986 and 1987. He worked as the CCP secretary and deputy director of the Shanghai No. 6 Rubber Shoes Factory between 1987 and 1988; during this time, he was praised by then Shanghai mayor Zhu Rongji.

He was the CCP secretary and deputy director of the Dazhonghua Rubber Plant between 1988 and 1990. Between 1983 and 1985, he additionally attended a two-year college program in Fudan University, and later completed an undergraduate degree in politics at the East China Normal University between 1985 and 1987 through part-time studies.

In June 1990, Han officially entered the CYLC Shanghai Committee, and would rise to become its deputy secretary in charge of day-to-day work, then elevated to secretary in 1991. In November 1992 he was named governor and deputy CCP secretary of Luwan District. During his tenure in the district, Han spearheaded the Huaihai Road revitalization initiative, transforming the street to a glamorous shopping destination. Han also focused on fixing the ecology of the district and expanding its green spaces. He then obtained a master&#x27;s degree in international political economy from East China Normal University between 1991 and 1994 and earned the title of senior economist.

== Career in Shanghai ==
In July 1995, Han was named deputy secretary-general of the Shanghai Municipal People&#x27;s Government, during which he was made the deputy CCP secretary of the Municipal Comprehensive Economic Work Committee, the director of the City Planning Commission, and the director of the Securities Management Office. In December 1997, he was named a member of the municipal CCP Standing Committee for the first time, entering sub-provincial ranks. In February 1998 he was named vice mayor of Shanghai; in May 2002 he was named Deputy CCP Secretary of Shanghai. Han joined the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party at the 16th Party Congress in 2002. In 2003 he was named the Mayor of Shanghai.
In 2006, Han became the acting CCP Committee Secretary of Shanghai after the dismissal of Chen Liangyu over corruption probes during the Shanghai pension scandal. His tenure as the interim party secretary in Shanghai lasted a five months, when on 24 March 2007, Xi Jinping was elected Shanghai Party Secretary from the same post in the neighboring province of Zhejiang. After serving as aide to Xi, Xi became a member of CCP Politburo Standing Committee in October 2007, and became vice president in 2008.

Yu Zhengsheng succeeded Xi as Shanghai Party Secretary, and Han worked for him for the next five years. By 2008 Han was expected to step back from leadership as fallout from Chen&#x27;s scandal, though Yu encouraged the relevant authorities in Beijing to keep Han on. Han assumed the party secretary post in November 2012, shortly after the conclusion of the 18th CCP National Congress, and also gained a seat on the 18th Politburo of the Chinese Communist Party. Due to his long career in Shanghai, Han is considered to be a member of the Shanghai clique.

== First Vice Premier ==
Han was chosen to be a member of the 19th CCP Politburo Standing Committee, China&#x27;s top decision-making body, at the first plenary session of the 19th Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party on 25 October 2017.
In March 2018 the National People&#x27;s Congress appointed him as the first-ranked vice premier of the State Council in Li Keqiang Government.

=== Hong Kong ===
Han succeeded Zhang Dejiang as the leader of the Central Coordination Group for Hong Kong and Macau Affairs in April 2018, making him the CCP&#x27;s top leader in regards to Hong Kong and Macau affairs. The Central Coordination Group was later upgraded to a Central Leading Group in 2020.

Han was a key figure in the Chinese leadership&#x27;s response during the 2019–2020 Hong Kong protests. According to a Reuters report in 2019, shortly after the storming of the Legislative Council Complex, Han Zheng authorized Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam to directly communicate with his office, rather than go through the Hong Kong Liaison Office. It also reported that Han summoned Lam to the Bauhinia Villa, used by the Chinese government for talks with Hong Kong officials, on 12 June. There, Lam proposed the suspension of the extradition bill which triggered the protests, which Han then agreed to after talking to other leaders in China.

In March 2021, Han said that electoral reforms in Hong Kong, designed to reduce the power of district councillors and to increase the power of the election committee, were being implemented to &quot;prevent subversion.&quot;

== Vice President ==
After the 20th CCP National Congress in October 2022, Han Zheng retired from the Politburo Standing Committee, as well as the broader Central Committee, at the age of 66. He was subsequently elected as a deputy to the 14th National People&#x27;s Congress (NPC), the only departing PSC member to do so. On 10 March 2023, Han was elected during the first session of the 14th NPC as the vice president of China, succeeding Wang Qishan. As vice president, Han is known as &quot;number eight&quot; in seniority of the leadership of China, after the seven-member Politburo Standing Committee while his role in the government remains ceremonial and concerns serving as an envoy for, and close adviser to, president Xi.

As vice president, Han has taken part in diplomatic activities. Han was President Xi&#x27;s special representative at the coronation of Charles III and Camilla in May 2023. In August, Han met with British foreign secretary James Cleverly in Beijing. He additionally attended the general debate of the seventy-eighth session of the United Nations General Assembly, giving a speech on 21 September. Han also met with US secretary of state Antony Blinken on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly that month. In October, Han attended the inauguration of Prabowo Subianto as the eighth president of Indonesia. 

In May 2024, Han met with Russian president Vladimir Putin in Harbin, where both Han and Putin attended the opening ceremony of 8th China-Russia expo. On 10 October, he succeeded Wang Qishan as the honorary president of the Red Cross Society of China. He attended the second inauguration of Donald Trump on 20 January 2025 as President Xi&#x27;s special representative. Han&#x27;s attendance marks the first time a senior official of China&#x27;s government has been sent to a US presidential inauguration. Han&#x27;s presence at the event, as he is a trusted senior official, was seen by commentators as representative of Xi&#x27;s interest in strengthening China–United States relations. Han attended separate meetings with incoming US vice president JD Vance and Trump ally Elon Musk before the inauguration, where Han and each of the two reaffirmed this directive to promote agreement and stable relations between their respective countries.

== Family ==
Han Zheng is married to Wang Ming, who reportedly once served as a vice chair of the Shanghai Charity Foundation. They have one daughter.

<text>The first USS &quot;Abbot&quot; (DD-184) was a in the service of the United States Navy until traded to Britain at the beginning of World War II. She served in the Royal Navy as HMS &quot;Charlestown&quot; (I21), a .

==Service history==

===As USS &quot;Abbot&quot;===
Named after Commodore Joel Abbot, she was laid down on 5 April 1918 by the Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company, Newport News, Virginia, launched on 4 July 1918, sponsored by Miss Louise Abbot, great-granddaughter of Cdre. Abbot, and commissioned on 19 July 1919.

Based at Norfolk, Virginia, &quot;Abbot&quot; operated along the east coast and in the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean, especially in Cuban waters. The destroyer was placed out of commission at the Philadelphia Navy Yard on 5 July 1922.

After being laid up for almost 20 years, &quot;Abbot&quot; was recommissioned on 17 June 1940 and patrolled along the east coast until going out of commission once more at Halifax, in Nova Scotia, on 23 September 1940 to be transferred to Britain under terms of the agreement by which the U.S. exchanged 50 overage destroyers for bases on British colonial territory in the Atlantic. &quot;Abbot&quot; was struck from the Navy list on 8 January 1941.

===As HMS &quot;Charlestown&quot;===
Temporarily named HMS &quot;Abbot and then quickly renamed HMS &quot;Charlestown, the destroyer was assigned to the 17th Destroyer Division and arrived at Belfast, Northern Ireland on 8 October. She took part in several minelaying operations along the west coast of Scotland. In September 1943, &quot;Charlestown&quot; was allocated to the Rosyth Escort Force to escort convoys along the east coast of Britain.

&quot;Charlestown&quot; was damaged in a collision with the minesweeper off Harwich, England in December 1944. Due to her age, it was decided not to repair her, and the destroyer was placed in reserve at Grangemouth, Firth of Forth. &quot;Charlestown&quot; was decommissioned on 15 January 1945 and was eventually scrapped.

<doc id="760319" wikidata="Q1127687" url="?curid=760319" title="Kelp gull">
<text>The kelp gull (Larus dominicanus), also known as the Dominican gull, is a gull that breeds on coasts and islands through much of the Southern Hemisphere. The nominate &quot;L. d. dominicanus&quot; is the subspecies found around South America, parts of Australia (where it overlaps with the Pacific gull), and New Zealand (where it is known as the black-backed gull, the southern black-backed gull, mollyhawk – particularly the juveniles, or by its Māori name karoro). &quot;L. d. vetula&quot; (known as the Cape gull) is a subspecies occurring around Southern Africa.

The specific name comes from the Dominican Order of friars, who wear black and white habits.

==Description==

The kelp gull superficially resembles two gulls from further north in the Atlantic Ocean, the lesser black-backed gull and the great black-backed gull, and is intermediate in size between these two species. This species ranges from in total length, from in wingspan and from in weight. Adult males and females weigh on average and respectively. Among standard measurements, the wing chord is , the bill is and the tarsus is . The adult kelp gull has black upper parts and wings. The head, underparts, tail, and the small &quot;mirrors&quot; at the wing tips are white. The bill is yellow with a red spot, and the legs are greenish-yellow (brighter and yellower when breeding, duller and greener when not breeding). The call is a strident &quot;ki-och&quot;. Juveniles have dull legs, a black bill, a dark band in the tail, and an overall grey-brown plumage densely edged whitish, but they rapidly get a pale base to the bill and largely white head and underparts. They take three or four years to reach maturity.

==Subspecies==
There are five subspecies of kelp gull. The African subspecies &quot;L. d. vetula&quot; is sometimes split as the Cape gull, &quot;L. vetula&quot;. It has a more angular head and a smaller shorter bill. The adult has a dark eye, whereas the nominate kelp gull usually has a pale eye. Young Cape gulls have almost identical plumage to similarly aged kelp gulls.

The kelp gull is a rare vagrant to the United States, with the first record in 1989 on Chandeleur Islands in Louisiana. They have interbred with American herring gull on these islands, leading to intermediate birds that may backcross to one another. After Hurricane Katrina in 2005, breeding populations of the two species and their hybrids were displaced from the island, though putative hybrids have been reported elsewhere and may be the result of other offshore colonies. 

==Behaviour==
Kelp gulls are omnivores like most &quot;Larus&quot; gulls, and they will scavenge as well as seek suitable small prey. They gather on landfills and a sharp increase in population is therefore considered as an indicator for a degraded environment. Kelp gulls have been observed feeding on living right whales since at least 1996. The kelp gull uses its powerful beak to peck down centimetres into the skin and blubber, often leaving the whales with large open sores, some of which have been observed to be half a meter in diameter. This predatory behavior has been documented in Argentinian waters. At rocky sites along the Southern African coast, such as at Boulders Beach in Cape Town, kelp gulls (&quot;Larus dominicanus vetula&quot;) can be seen picking up shellfish and repeatedly flying up several meters and dropping them onto the rocks below in order to break them open. They have also been reported pecking the eyes out of seal pups on the coast of Namibia before attacking the blind seals in a group.

The nest is a shallow depression on the ground lined with vegetation and feathers. The female usually lays 2 or 3 eggs. Both parents feed the young birds.

==Cape gull (&quot;Larus dominicanus vetula&quot; or &quot;Larus vetula&quot;)==

The Cape gull differs from other forms of kelp gulls by its darker iris and larger body and bill size. The Southern African population is estimated to include 11,000 breeding pairs, and is expanding.
