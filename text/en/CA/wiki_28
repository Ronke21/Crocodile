<text>Carran (), also Carron, is a small village in County Clare, Ireland. It is in the Burren region, within a civil parish of the same name. It is notable mainly for being the birthplace of Michael Cusack, the inspirer and co-founder of the Gaelic Athletic Association. At the time of the 2011 Census, Carran had 106 inhabitants.

==Geography==

Carran parish is located on the uplands of the Burren and is bounded on the northwest by County Galway and on the south by Kilnaboy. &quot;Slieve Carran&quot;, one of the highest points in the Burren, lies north of the village.

The land is mainly rocky pasture with much limestone. In the past there were copper mines. It is said that Saint Columb founded an abbey at Glanculmkil, later to become the parish church. An 1837 account said this church was in ruins, and there were the remains of two other old churches at Crunane and Glanculmkil. A stone bed is called Saint Columb&#x27;s bed, and nearby is a spring of fine water.

The parish contains the townlands of Ballyconry, Ballydoora, Ballyline, Cahermackirilla, Cahergrillaun, Cappagh, Cappaghkennedy, Carran, Castletown, Clab, Clooncoose, Commons, Coolnatullagh, Coskeam, Creevagh, Crughwill, Fahee North, Fahee South, Fanygalvan, Glencolumbkille North, Glencolumbkille South, Iskancullin, Keelhilla, Knockans Lower, Knockans Upper, Meggagh East, Meggagh West, Mogouhy, Moheramoylan, Moheraroon, Moygowna, Poulacarran, Poulaphuca, Poulawack, Poulcaragharush, Pullagh, Rannagh East, Rannagh West, Sheshodonnell East, Sheshodonnell West, Sladoo and Termon.

==Economy==
In the village itself, a pub/restaurant (Cassidy&#x27;s), a hostel, and a number of bed and breakfasts can be found. It also sports a church, a schoolhouse (built in 1858) and a town hall. The schoolhouse now is used by the &quot;Burrenlife Project&quot;.

The number of inhabitants was 106 at the time of the 2011 Census, down from 115 in 2006.

Carran is located centrally to a number of tourist sights: Within eight kilometres of the village are several stone forts, Poulnabrone dolmen, a turlough (disappearing lake) and limestone scenery (&quot;pavement&quot;). There is also &quot;Gleann Ciosog&quot; (a Gaelic Athletic Association pitch for the local football team &quot;Michael Cusacks&quot;). Carran was the birthplace of Michael Cusack, the inspirer and co-founder of the Gaelic Athletic Association. A visitor centre commemorating him has been constructed south of the village on road L1014.

East of the village is a Field Research Station, opened in 1975 by University College Galway (now NUI Galway). A bit beyond is the &quot;Burren Perfumery&quot;, according to Lonely Planet the &quot;only handycraft perfumery in Ireland&quot;.

In addition, the area offers walking trails like the &quot;Carran loop&quot; or around the Carran turlough and scenic views over the Burren.

==Places of interest==
* Carran church (&quot;Teampull a&#x27;Chairn&quot;), located on the road between Leamaneh Castle and Ballyvaughan, is a ruin that measures 19 metres in length and 7 metres in breadth. The west end contains a (broken) belfry at the top and the south end has a pointed doorway and two windows, one of which is pointed and the other which is broken. These features indicate a construction date in the 15th century. The east end contains another pointed window broad on the inside and narrow on the outside. There seem to have been living quarters for the priest above the ground floor worship area. A broken stone altar remains under this window and at the left corner is a holy water font. In the north wall were three corbels decorated with carved heads, two males and one female. Only one of these heads now remains, two were removed in the 1970s. The remaining head wears a kind of hood or helmet or basinet indicating a carving from the late 14th or early 15th century.
* The cliff-bound valley of Kilcorney, 7 kilometres away, is characteristic of the area.
* Not far from the village is &quot;Temple Cronan&quot;, a 12th-century church. The west end of the church has some grotesque Romanesque heads on its exterior wall. In the churchyard there are two &quot;Cumdachs&quot; for bones, according to tradition built by St. Cronan. They are constructed from large flagstones, so placed as to meet at the top similar to a roof. West of the church is the holy well, &quot;Tobar Chronain&quot;, at which stations are performed.
* In Keelhilla townland lies the hermitage of Colman mac Duagh, a pilgrimage destination since medieval times and the site of a small oratory and several other antiquities.
* Also situated in the parish is Poulawack Cairn (&quot;Poll an Bhaic&quot;, The Hole of the Angle), a Neolithic/Bronze Age burial site excavated first by the Harvard Archaeological Expedition of 1934.
* &quot;Cahercommaun&quot; triple stone fort in the neighbouring Parish of Kilnaboy, is also close to Carran. 
* Another ring fort in the area is &quot;Caherconnell&quot;.
* Creevagh wedge tomb is located in the parish.
*Cashlaungar, a stone ringfort located 2.7 km to the south of Carran.

<text>John Garland Pollard (August 4, 1871April 28, 1937) was a Virginia lawyer and American Democratic politician, who served as the 21st Attorney General of Virginia (1914-1918) and as the 51st Governor of Virginia (1930 to 1934), as well as on the Federal Trade Commission (1919-1921) and as chairman of the Board of Veterans Appeals (1934-1937).

==Early life==
John Garland Pollard was born on August 4, 1871, in King and Queen County, Virginia. He was the fourth child and second son of Baptist minister John Pollard (1839 - 1911), and his wife the former Virginia Bagby (1839 - 1918). The Pollard family lived in Baltimore, Maryland, early in his childhood, before moving to Richmond&#x27;s Church Hill neighborhood. Pollard later took pride in his Norman–English ancestry, tracing his ancestors to colonial Virginians. Pollard attended Richmond College (now the University of Richmond) but ill health led him to suspend his studies. He later entered Columbian College, now George Washington University where Pollard studied law, as well as worked at the Smithsonian Institution to support himself before receiving his degree in 1893. Pollard also wrote &quot;The Pamunkey Indians of Virginia&quot;, an anthropological survey that detailed the vanishing language and traditions of the early Virginia tribe.

In 1897 John Pollard married Grace Phillips of Portsmouth, Virginia, with whom he had four children (including Charles Phillips Pollard (1903 - 1990)) before her death in 1931. In July 1933 Governor Pollard married his Canadian-born executive secretary, Violet E. MacDougall.

==Career==
In 1893, Pollard was admitted to the Virginia bar and joined the legal practice of his uncle Henry Robinson Pollard in Richmond. He also became involved in politics, supporting Democrat William Jennings Bryan in his presidential campaigns and opposing the dominant political organization of Virginia&#x27;s U.S. Senator Thomas Staples Martin.

In 1901, Pollard was elected from Richmond as a delegate to the Virginia Constitutional Convention of 1901–1902. He unsuccessfully proposed deleting the word &quot;Christian&quot; from the constitution&#x27;s preamble, and joined with 15 Democrats and 12 Republicans to vote against the entire suffrage provision (which restricted voting by African Americans and poor whites and passed nonetheless). Pollard also voted for promulgating the Constitution of 1902 without a referendum.

In 1904, he published Pollard&#x27;s Code, an annotation of Virginia&#x27;s law. He also became president of the Children&#x27;s Home Society of Virginia, which part-time position he continued for two decades. In 1911, Pollard campaigned for Carter Glass and Congressman William A. Jones in their attempts to upset incumbent U.S. Senators Martin and Claude Swanson, but those attempts failed. He later worked for the presidential candidacy of Virginia born Woodrow Wilson (whom Martin and Swanson opposed), but after winning the Presidency, Wilson allowed Martin&#x27;s friends to distribute patronage.

In 1913, Pollard campaigned to become Virginia&#x27;s Attorney General against two Martin organization candidates (S.W. Williams and S.G. Cummings). They divided the organization vote and Pollard (who advocated election law reform, increased public education funding, and abolition of fee-based compensation of public officials) narrowly won the Democratic primary. He then easily won the general election in November, alongside Governor Henry C. Stuart and Lieutenant Governor J. Taylor Ellyson. He took office in January 1914 and the following month became president of the Progressive Virginia Democratic League. Pollard campaigned for Prohibition, and Virginia went dry in September 1914. The attorney general also cracked down on gambling and vice in Norfolk, Hopewell and Colonial Beach. His successful conclusion of the lawsuit against West Virginia relating to pre-Civil War debt and recovery of Martha Washington&#x27;s will from J.P. Morgan&#x27;s estate also brought Pollard public acclaim.

Pollard announced his candidacy for Governor of Virginia in 1915, but the Democratic primary was a three-way race, with the Prohibitionists endorsing Ellyson (because of his machine support, despite his lukewarm support for Prohibition), rather than let the &quot;wet&quot; Westmoreland Davis win. Davis nonetheless won the primary with 44% of the vote, and Ellyson garnered 27,811 votes to Pollard&#x27;s 22,436 votes. Disappointed and fearful that his political campaign had ruined his law practice, but unable to secure a federal appointment, Pollard volunteered with the Young Men&#x27;s Christian Association and moved to Europe in 1918. He talked about the war&#x27;s goals and assisted American soldiers abroad for 18 months.

Returning to Washington, D.C., in the summer of 1919, Pollard secured a nomination from Woodrow Wilson as a short-term member of the Federal Trade Commission.

In 1921, Pollard moved to Williamsburg, Virginia, where he became the first Dean of the Marshall Wythe School of Citizenship and Government, at The College of William and Mary as well as professor of constitutional law and history. Pollard also became involved in efforts to restore the colonial town along with the Rev. W. A. R. Goodwin, including rebuilding the Raleigh Tavern, among the first efforts to recreate Colonial Williamsburg. Fellow citizens elected Pollard mayor. He also served as chairman of the area Democratic committee, taught Sunday School at the local Baptist Church, and developed Pollard Park, a small garden-like development that expressed his ideas on urban planning, and was later listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

After Senator Martin&#x27;s death, Pollard made peace with the local Democratic organization, supporting E. Lee Trinkle for governor in 1921 and Claude A. Swanson for U.S. Senator in 1922. Governor Trinkle appointed Pollard to the Commission on Simplicity in Government, where he signed a report critical of the state&#x27;s tax structure. When Harry F. Byrd was elected Governor in 1925, Pollard helped pass some controversial constitutional amendments which otherwise had little support in the Commonwealth&#x27;s eastern section. Pollard also refused to desert the Democratic Party when it nominated Al Smith, both Catholic and anti-Prohibition (a/k/a &quot;wet&quot;). Methodist bishop James Cannon Jr. organized anti-Smith Democrats in Virginia and split what had been the consistently Democratic state, with the result that Republican presidential candidate Herbert Hoover received its electoral votes.

==Governor of Virginia==
Although Pollard warned Byrd that he would be his own man, he accepted support from the new leader of the Democratic machine and ran for governor in 1929. He won 76% of the Democratic primary vote, defeating Prohibitionist G. Walter Mapp (who had lost to Byrd in 1925, and whose close association with Cannon became a liability when the bishop&#x27;s financial dealings became a scandal) and Rosewell Page of Hanover County. In the 1929 general election, voters elected Pollard Governor of Virginia. He won 62.78% of the vote, defeating anti-Byrd Democrat turned Republican William Moseley Brown (a psychology professor at Washington and Lee University) as well as Socialist John J. Kafka, and Independent W.A. Rowe.

John Garland Pollard took the oath of office as governor of Virginia in January 1930, as the Great Depression became apparent. He faced reduced state revenues, and per government economics of the time accordingly cut state employee wages and reduced services throughout his administration. Pollard had hoped to overhaul fee-based administration, but counties were not required to accept his reforms. With Byrd&#x27;s assistance, the legislature did pass a workman&#x27;s compensation act as Gov. Pollard had urged in 1930, as well as reformed election laws and fisheries. Pollard generally deferred to Byrd allies E. R. Combs (the state comptroller) and C.H. Morrissette (tax commissioner). That summer, a severe drought parched the tobacco crop, stunted farm produce, threatened to kill orchards and destroyed cattle prices (farmers selling stock cheaply rather than pay high feed prices despite the railroad reducing hay transport costs by 50%). Pollard appointed Byrd to head the State Drought Relief Committee, as well as tried to use the highway department as a relief agency, borrowing $2.4 million to match federal advances on future highway allocations. Virginia Labor Commissioner John Hopkins Hall initially claimed the state&#x27;s diversified industry had mitigated the depression&#x27;s effects. Due to the presence of the U.S. Navy, Norfolk seemed to not experience the Depression, and the percentage of those out of work in the Commonwealth was below the national average.

On September 29, 1930, 4,000 workers supported by the United Textile Workers of America left their jobs at the Dan River Mills in Danville (a town already reeling from the closing of cotton mills and furniture factories). Rather than repeat the bloodshed of North Carolina textile strikes, after the mill owner refused his offer to mediate and a November riot in support of 40 striking mill workers charged with unlawful assembly, Pollard acceded to local authorities&#x27; requests and called out three companies of the state&#x27;s National Guard, which kept the peace until the strike collapsed on January 29, 1931. Moreover, widespread poverty within the state reduced the influence of economic fluctuations. In 1929 Virginia ranked 36th in per capita income (although 19th in total income); many blacks, mill workers and subsistence farmers lived in poverty. One tenth of Virginia&#x27;s 170,000 farmers had incomes over $2500 in 1929, but even in that year two of every five earned less than $600. Farm tenancy was high in the state&#x27;s cotton and tobacco-growing areas, although Virginia also had among the second lowest percentage in the nation of farms subject to mortgages, so foreclosures were not a severe problem. Pollard petitioned President Hoover for continuation in federal road advances (requesting $5 million to be repaid in 10 to 15 years), in order to avoid a dole. Governor Pollard again balanced the state budget, although he also appointed an Unemployment Relief Committee headed by Byrd confidante William T. Reed, who also opposed expensive work relief programs but urged businesses to adopt a five-day workweek and start new building projects.

However, by mid-1931, Virginia had between 50,000 and 60,000 unemployed workers; industrial employment had decreased 14% and wages 24% since 1929. The state treasury&#x27;s $4 million surplus had become a deficit, industrial output had fallen 17%, tobacco and wool prices fell 60% and corn 26%. Norfolk was clearly suffering, as were Lynchburg and Richmond. Even affluent farmers and businessmen were living hand to mouth. In 1932, Pollard again adopted Byrd&#x27;s philosophy of curtailing expenses and not raising taxes. He cut his own salary 10% and recommended the same for all state employees for one year. He denied the education superintendent&#x27;s request for $2 million in additional money, and the Norfolk delegation&#x27;s request to divert automobile tax revenues to schools, instead ordering road appropriations reduced. However, the Byrd organization satisfied those demanding tax relief by allowing the state to take over and maintain county feeder roads. Virginia also lost a congressional seat after the 1930 census, and the redistricting that passed the Byrd-controlled legislature was ruled unconstitutional. As the depression continued, unemployment in Virginia peaked at 145,000 in July 1932 (19% of the work force), and state revenues had decreased 32% from the 1929 level. In some counties, tax delinquencies increased to 20%, so Pollard cut appropriations in 1932 and 1933. However, some relief came with the expansion of the federal Reconstruction Finance Corporation in July 1932. Congress authorized $300 million in loans to states and an additional $322 million for public works, so Governor Pollard requested $4.5 million and appointed an Emergency Relief Committee, noting that unemployment was highest in the cities of Richmond and Hopewell, as well as in Wise, Pulaski, Pittsylvania, Brunswick, Lunenburg and Halifax counties (all tobacco-producing or industrialized).

When Democrat Franklin D. Roosevelt (FDR) was elected President (Virginia supporting him by more than 2 to 1 margin and unseating its only Republican in Congress) in November 1932, Virginia&#x27;s economic prospects improved. However, Senator Carter Glass refused the position of Secretary of the Treasury that he had held under President Woodrow Wilson almost two decades earlier, citing ill health. Then FDR appointed Virginia&#x27;s other Senator, Claude Swanson, Secretary of the Navy. After Congress concurred in that post, Governor Pollard quickly appointed Byrd to the vacant U.S. Senate seat. This cemented Byrd&#x27;s hold of the state Democratic organization, as well as gave him a national platform. Initially, the state&#x27;s federal delegation supported FDR&#x27;s Hundred Days reforms, including creation of the Tennessee Valley Authority, Agricultural Adjustment Administration and Civilian Conservation Corps(CCC). Governor Pollard quickly filled the state&#x27;s initial CCC quota of 5,000 young men to do conservation work, and set up Camp Roosevelt in the George Washington National Forest near Luray. Pollard had also accepted gifts to create the state&#x27;s first park, Richmond Battlefield Park in 1932, but since Virginia lacked funds to develop it, it was turned over to the National Park Service in March 1936.

However, Senator Glass soon criticized the New Deal, and the new Senator Byrd had some early defeats, particularly as he opposed Roosevelt&#x27;s repeal of Prohibition in early 1933. Moreover, Virginia&#x27;s tax revenues were much lower than expected, so as May 1933 ended Gov. Pollard announced another 5% salary cut for state employees and proposed a 30% reduction in department appropriations (Virginia&#x27;s $560,000 surplus as the 2-year budget cycle began had become a deficit of $619,000 despite cutting appropriations by $3 million). The additional cuts produced outcries ranging from legislators to the State Corporation Commission to the Education Superintendent. A cartoon in the &quot;Richmond Times-Dispatch&quot; portrayed Gov. Pollard as Horatio defending a bridge against wet forces. When Byrd sent his lieutenant, state Senator William M. Tuck of Halifax, to the Governor to call a special legislative session to legalize beer and make it taxable (a penny per bottle), Governor Pollard (despite his long advocacy of prohibition) called the special legislative session and resulting constitutional convention, which promptly ratified the 21st Amendment. The General Assembly of 1934 then established a state monopoly on liquor sales. The state legislature also passed measures implementing the National Recovery Administration, despite the criticism by Senator Carter Glass and 4th district Congressman Patrick Henry Drewry, but its operation proved rocky, and few Virginians mourned its demise at the pen of the U.S. Supreme Court in May 1935, well after Pollard&#x27;s term ended.

Virginia&#x27;s Constitution prohibited governors from seeking re-election, so Pollard supported the Democratic party&#x27;s candidate in the 1933 election, and George Peery (hand-picked by Sen. Byrd) succeeded Pollard in 1934.

Among other accomplishments, Pollard may have been most proud of establishing the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, the first state art museum in the United States. He raised $100,000 to match the challenge of philanthropist John Barton Payne, then became president of the board of directors and continued his involvement the rest of his life.

After his governorship ended, Pollard accepted President Roosevelt&#x27;s appointment as chairman of the Board of Veterans Appeals.

<doc id="764686" wikidata="Q1145118" url="?curid=764686" title="Please Twins!">
<text>is an anime television series scripted by Yōsuke Kuroda and produced by Bandai Visual, which was later adapted into a light novel and one-volume manga series. It centers on a family of three teenagers in high school all living together who are unsure which two of them are related to each other due to a reference from an old photograph. The &quot;Please Twins!&quot; anime series is a spin-off sequel to &quot;Please Teacher!&quot;. It first aired in Japan on the WOWOW satellite television network on July 15, 2003 and finished with a total of 12 episodes plus a later OVA episode released on DVD. The series was later adapted into a light novel in 2004, which spanned a total of two volumes and, soon after, into a short one-&quot;tankōbon&quot; manga version (authored by Akikan), which was serialized in MediaWorks&#x27;s &quot;Dengeki Daioh&quot; magazine in September 2005.

==Plot==
&quot;Please Twins!&quot; is a story about three high-school students: Maiku Kamishiro, Karen Onodera, and Miina Miyafuji. The three were drawn together by a photograph of their childhood home which later makes all of them seek out the house in the picture. However, the picture shows only two children, a boy and a girl. The three conclude from this that only one of the girls, either Karen or Miina, can be related to Maiku. The other must be a nonrelative. The only other identifying feature of the pair in the picture is that the boy and the girl have eyes of the same unusual color, a feature that furthers the ambiguity as all three of them share the same eye color.

The main concern of the male lead, Maiku, is that, although he eventually comes to care for both of the girls, he does not know which of them is his sister. In addition, the two girls develop feelings for Maiku, forming a love triangle that cannot be resolved until the truth of their relationship is known. All three main characters are in the predicament of wanting to discover their past versus the risk of losing a romantic relationship.

The events of the story are set the year after &quot;Please Teacher!&quot; and characters from that series appear in supporting roles throughout &quot;Please Twins!&quot;.

==Characters==
;
:The main protagonist of the story, Maiku (pronounced &#x27;Mike&#x27; in the English dub) tends to be very secretive and stoic. He moves into the blue house shown on the news about a UFO appearance (an incident which happened in &quot;Please Teacher!&quot; episode 1), which is the same house on an old photograph that he kept. At the beginning of the story, he is living alone but is soon joined by Miina Miyafuji and Karen Onodera after they each trace their copies of the photograph to the house, and the three appear to have the same unusual blue eye color. He treats his two potential relatives harshly, frequently calling them idiots and bossing them around; however we find out later in the series he does this to avoid getting hurt by people he cares about. Later, he warms to them but still maintains a tough exterior. He is a computer programmer who takes contract work and a student in high school. He acknowledges Miina as his girlfriend in the OVA episode. In the light novel Miina is his biological sister and Maiku chooses Karen.
:
:Miina has an enthusiastic and outgoing personality. Gradually she develops feelings for Maiku but is afraid to act on them. As she states it, if she is related to Maiku she has a &#x27;right&#x27; to live in the house, but can&#x27;t have a romantic relationship with him. If she isn&#x27;t related then she can have that relationship, but can&#x27;t live in the house. She outwardly expresses herself as happy-go-lucky, although she is hiding things about her past. The anime, novel and manga each have different resolutions to the mystery of the photo. In the anime&#x27;s end, Maiku accepts Miina&#x27;s feelings; in the light novel she is his sister. 
:
:Karen is usually a very shy and timid girl who is even prone to passing out (called &#x27;nyu&#x27;s&#x27;, for the syllable she utters as she does so) when a situation gets too intense for her to handle. She frequently calls people by a title. Like Miina, she also develops feelings for Maiku, though she does not act on them giving the same reasons Miina does. In the anime it turns out that Karen is Maiku&#x27;s twin sister, as discovered when she finds a diary in the abandoned house across the street from their house that proves they are related. In the light novel she and Maiku are not related and the two begin a romantic relationship. 

===Supporting characters===
:
:Haruko is Matagu&#x27;s younger sister and is usually very bubbly and hyperactive. She has a very immature personality and, while she acknowledges that her brother is a pervert, she seems completely oblivious to such mature matters. She attends class 1A. She, Akina Sagawa and Futaba Mashita greet Miina and Karen on their first day of school.
:
:Kousei is Maiku&#x27;s only real friend at the beginning of the series. He sits next to Maiku in class, and often becomes a bit too flirtatious with Maiku, usually resulting in him getting punched or slapped away by Maiku. For example, when Maiku reveals he needs money, Kousei actually tells him that if he stayed with him for a night, he would pay as much as Maiku wanted, resulting in him getting slapped. Despite Kousei&#x27;s flirtations making Maiku uncomfortable and Maiku hitting or slapping Kousei in response, the two are close friends throughout the series. Kosei is assumed by his peers to be Homosexual, by his many openly flirtatious interactions with Maiku. However, it&#x27;s eventually revealed that Kousei is still in love with his ex-girlfriend, Tsubaki, revealing that he is actually bisexual. Kosei eventually manages to work out things with Tsubaki and they get together again in the end.
:
:Tsubaki is the vice president of the student council and usually has a very serious personality. Intelligent and outgoing, gifted with a busty figure and possessing a more mature personality than the &#x27;twin&#x27; girls, she is a source of concern for Karen and Miina as being an obvious rival for Maiku&#x27;s affections. Her attempts to interest Maiku in a relationship, however, are met with Maiku&#x27;s tacit plea for just friendship. It is not until she confers with (the much older and wiser) Ichigo that Tsubaki realizes that Maiku cannot engage in any casual romantic relationship due to both his obligations to his new-found &#x27;family&#x27; and his own forcibly matured, responsible nature. This causes Tsubaki to gain a higher degree of respect for Maiku, and to focus her attentions on the one person she once thought too forceful in expressing his affection for her, Kousei Shimazaki. In the anime she had objected to Kousei putting his hand on her breast when they kissed for the first time. In the light novel she had been psychologically traumatized when her brother died at a young age and she had been trying to fill a void, first with Kousei, then with Maiku. In the anime, however; Tsubaki managed to work out things with Kosei and they get together again in the end.
:
:Yuuka is Miina&#x27;s friend from middle school. She appears at the end of episode 9, recognizing Miina and recalling the history that Miina has been trying to put behind her. Miina comes to terms with it in episode 10, and Yuuka is seen again at the beginning of episode 11. In the light novel this section of the &quot;Please Twins!&quot; story is entirely rewritten and Yuuka is omitted, replaced with Yukiko Kachofugetsuin, Karen&#x27;s rival in playing the piano.

===From &quot;Please Teacher!&quot;===
Some of the &quot;Please Teacher!&quot; characters return in various supporting roles.
:
:Ichigo has changed a lot since the events of &quot;Please Teacher!&quot;. She has become president of the student council, described in the first novel as the most effective in the school&#x27;s history, and somewhat perversely enjoys getting dirt on other students. Ichigo usually avoids male companionship though, in fact, she has normal desires in this regard. This is partly due to a unique disease where she was put into a &quot;standstill&quot;, a form of metabolic stasis similar to a coma, for six years, which stopped her aging process. The disease can be triggered by psychological stress; hence her deadpan, phlegmatic personality is a counter to prevent its onset, a stronger personality trait in &quot;Twins&quot; than in &quot;Please Teacher!&quot;. She has also added a quiet &quot;heh heh heh&quot; to the end of many of her statements, as if she were privately enjoying a joke. In effect, she appears to be a grade-schooler when in fact she is much older when the story begins. Most of the details of her life are revealed in &quot;Please Teacher!&quot; and are not mentioned in this story. In the &quot;Twins&quot; anime series, there was no mention of her growth standstill, while the light novels make only one vague passing allusion. In the novels, Ichigo and Matagu Shido have a history, which Morino dislikes and guards against.
:
:Matagu is a senior to the main characters and tends to come off as an incestuous pervert, though he is otherwise good-natured. His appearances tend to be for comic relief. He also has a sister complex on Haruko, possibly due to him having no luck with women. At the end of this series, he is in the hospital after being haunted by the ghost in the countryside and he has no visitors.
:
:Mizuho is employed as a teacher at the school where all the characters attend. She is homeroom teacher of Class 1B, with Maiku and Kosei being her students. She is in fact a half-human alien. She can be somewhat ditzy, but also very open-hearted, compassionate and sociable. In a somewhat nostalgic replay of the situation that led to her and Kei being discovered by the former headmaster, Miina and Karen are forced to hide in the very same sports equipment locker. Marie locates them, and Mizuho transports herself to it covertly to counsel the two girls on the true nature of Maiku&#x27;s seeming gruffness towards them, asserting that it screens genuine kindness and affection for them. Her half-alien nature is never mentioned in the &quot;Twins&quot; anime, and this scene is the only allusion to it in the anime. She is married to Kei Kusanagi which is now an open secret at the school.
:
:Marie is Mizuho&#x27;s diminutive assistant and companion. A quasi-organic systems link to the operating system controlling Kazami&#x27;s cloaked and submerged starship and its transporter functions, &#x27;he&#x27; has been nicknamed &quot;Fushigi-chan&quot; (&quot;Little Wonder&quot; in English) by Karen for an ability to materialize almost anywhere, often after being summoned without any seeming communications device employed. &#x27;He&#x27; makes occasional appearances in the neighborhood, at school and the protagonist&#x27;s shared residence. As &#x27;his&#x27; master Kazami does with &quot;Pochy&quot;, &#x27;he&#x27; enjoys eating &quot;Prech&quot;, a snack food based on the real-life snack Pretz, for which he has an insatiable appetite. The anime establishes that Marie&#x27;s existence is publicly known and accepted (despite &#x27;his&#x27; other-worldly appearance and demonstrated abilities such as levitation) by several of the school&#x27;s students as being a part of the local UFO folklore surrounding the area, thanks to the events of &quot;Please Teacher!&quot;. It is commented by Mizuho that Marie is a frequent visitor and overnight guest at the Kamishiro residence, and is seen &#x27;sleeping&#x27; on the same futon with the two girls.
:Mizuho&#x27;s mother. She is a very sensual, self-assured, bold but subtly assertive woman. She appears in one chapter of the light novels, hooking onto Maiku at a festival. She does not appear in the anime or the manga.
:
:Kei is the senior to the main characters who does not speak in the first 12 episodes of the &quot;Twins&quot; series. Kei has the same extraordinary disease as Ichigo which caused him to be in a &quot;standstill&quot; for three years. Kei is now 20 in this series. He was covertly married to Mizuho Kazami in the original series, but their marriage is now common knowledge in this series. This is from rumors spread around the school in the post-credits scene of the &quot;Please Teacher!&quot; OVA.
:
:Koishi is a third-year high school student in this series. She is slender, with short brown hair cut straight across in back. Her parents own the Herikawa Groceries and she assists there. As such, she becomes Miina and Karen&#x27;s manager after the two of them obtain part-time jobs at the store, thanks to Ichigo&#x27;s machinations and her longtime friendship with Koishi. She was most of the time behind the counter studying for university entrance exams. She is seen with Miina in episode 11, and in one brief camera shot in EP12 along with Kaede Misumi. In the OVA, she has a conversation with Miina in which she encourages Miina to pursue a romantic relationship with Maiku, then spends the rest of the episode with Ichigo.
:
:A brash student with dyed blonde hair, Hyosuke aspires to attend college at Tokyo University and become a professional statesman, much like his brother. Currently going out with Kaede. He only appears in episode 13.
:
:Kaede tends to be a rather shy girl most of the time. Her physical characteristics include that she is one quarter Irish, tall (for a Japanese) and with red hair and freckles. Currently going out with Hyosuke. She appears only in episode 13 and at the end of episode 12 in which she and Koishi have a look at the photos that Ichigo took.
:
:A quiet male teacher whose hobby is creating human-powered planes, he is in a secret relationship with Koishi. He is the homeroom teacher of Class 1A. Miina, Karen, Haruko, Akina Sagawa and Futaba Mashita are all in his class. In this series, he has shaved his beard and has become popular with the girls as Koishi said he would.

;Nat
:Nat (Nat-chan in Japanese) is known as the little girl during the summer (both in this anime, and in &quot;Please Teacher!&quot;). In this series she is seated on a lifeguard&#x27;s tower with her dog seated beside her, scanning with binoculars for a boy to fall in love with. She spots Maiku and falls for him. A moment later, however, she sees Karen and Miina with Maiku and she tumbles backward off the tower, dragging her dog by the leash after her, heartbroken.

==Media==

===Anime===
The &quot;Please Twins!&quot; anime series, scripted by Yōsuke Kuroda, directed by Yasunori Ide, and produced by Bandai Visual, premiered in Japan on the WOWOW satellite television network between July 15, 2003 and October 14, 2003, consisting of a total of 12 episodes. An OVA episode continuing the story was later released on DVD on April 23, 2004. The series has been licensed for North American distribution by Bandai Entertainment. Two pieces of theme music were used for the episodes: one opening theme and one ending theme. The opening theme is &quot;Second Flight&quot; by Kotoko and Hiromi Satō, and the ending theme is &quot;Asu e no Namida&quot; by Mami Kawada.

====Episode list====
===Light novel===
&quot;Please Twins!&quot; was later adapted into a light novel, authored by Gō Zappa and illustrated by Taraku Uon and Hiroaki Gōda. It was published in Japan by MediaWorks in 2004. It was later licensed for North American distribution by ComicsOne and published in two volumes in 2005.

The light novel covers several different events that did not occur in the anime and omits some events altogether. While the basic story stays intact, there is one large difference: the identity of Maiku&#x27;s sister in the novel differs from the anime version.

===Manga===
The series was later adapted into a short one-volume manga version, authored by Akikan, which was serialized in MediaWorks&#x27;s &quot;Dengeki Daioh&quot; magazine in September 2005. The manga has since been licensed for North American distribution by ComicsOne and published in 2006.

<text>Pōmare I (c. 1753 – September 3, 1803) (fully in old orthography: Tu-nui-ea-i-te-atua-i-Tarahoi Vaira&#x27;atoa Taina Pōmare I; also known as Tu or Tinah or Outu, or more formally as Tu-nui-e-a&#x27;a-i-te-atua) was the unifier and first king of Tahiti and founder of the Pōmare dynasty and the Kingdom of Tahiti between 1788 and 1791. He abdicated in 1791 but remained in power as the guardian regent during the minority of his successor Pōmare II from 1791 until 1803. He is best known in the western world for being the ruler of Tahiti during the mutiny on the &quot;Bounty&quot; in 1789.

==Name==
&quot;Outu&quot; is the phonetic English rendering of &quot;O Tū&quot;, Tū being the name, o the nominal predicate meaning &quot;that is&quot;. Older literature writes his family name as Tunuieaiteatua, which leaves incertainties about the proper pronunciation as Tahitian usually did (and does) not write macrons and glottals. Barring this incertainty, in the current proper orthography would be Tū-nui-ēa-i-te-atua meaning Great-Tū,-road-to-the-god. Tū (standing straight up) was a major Tahitian god.

Ariitaimai claims that this Tū is a contraction of &quot;atua&quot; (god), but that is unlikely. The name Pōmare was adopted later. Pō-mare means &quot;night cougher&quot;, a nickname he took, as was common in that time, in honor of his daughter Princess Teri’inavahoroa who died from tuberculosis in 1792. Because of a Polynesian tradition of not saying the monarch&#x27;s name in vain, &quot;pō&quot; and &quot;mare&quot; were replaced by &quot;rui&quot; and &quot;hota&quot; respectively. Currently &quot;rui&quot; is only used in the Bible, &quot;pō&quot; having become the standard word again.

==Biography==
Tu was the son of Teu, chief of Pare-&#x27;Arue, and his wife, Tetupaia-i-Hauiri (Tetupaia). Tetupaia was the granddaughter of Tamatoa II of Raiatea. Tu&#x27;s great uncle was Tutaha, who acted as his regent. 

Born at Pare, ca. 1753, he initially reigned under the regency of his father and succeeded on the death of his father as Arii-rahi of Porionuu on November 23, 1802. Pōmare further succeeded in uniting the different chiefdoms of Tahiti into a single kingdom, composed of the islands of Tahiti itself, Moorea, Mehetia, and the Tetiaroa group. He thus became the first king of unified Tahiti in 1788. 

One year into his reign as Tahiti&#x27;s king, Pōmare hosted the crew of HMS &quot;Bounty&quot; who had visited Tahiti to collect breadfruit plants for transportation to the West Indies. The subsequent mutiny on the &quot;Bounty&quot; caused the mutineers to return briefly to Tahiti, where they were under Pōmare&#x27;s protection, until leaving the island and eventually relocating to Pitcairn. A small number of mutineers stayed behind and were later located by HMS &quot;Pandora&quot;, to which Pōmare accepted British authority and allowed the mutineers to be arrested and taken back to England for trial.

Pōmare&#x27;s service as the first king of unified Tahiti ended when he abdicated in 1791. He was succeeded by Tū Tūnuiʻēʻaiteatua Pōmare II, who reigned from 1791 until 1821: however, though no longer monarch, Pomare remained regent of Tahiti during the minority of Pomare II, from 1791 until 1803. In 1792, HMS &quot;Providence&quot; visited Tahiti and Pōmare was reunited with William Bligh, the victim of mutiny four years earlier. Bligh interviewed Pōmare regarding the mutineers and subsequently wrote an account of where he suspected the mutineers may have escaped to following their departure from Tahiti. 

Pōmare married 4 times and had three sons and three daughters. He died from thrombosis.

==Portrayals==
Due to Pōmare&#x27;s role as King of Tahiti during the Mutiny on the Bounty, he has subsequently been portrayed in various dramatic films about the Bounty. In both the 1935 film and the 1962 version, he is known as &quot;Chief Hitihiti&quot; and played respectively by Bill Bambridge and Matahiariʻi Tama. In the 1984 film &quot;The Bounty&quot; he is known as &quot;King Tynah&quot; and is portrayed by New Zealand actor Wi Kuki Kaa. Historically, Tynah may have been a different individual from Pōmare, as he is mentioned in the Bounty log as a &quot;Paramount Chief&quot;, a title separate from monarch.

<text>A casserole (French: diminutive of , from Provençal , meaning &#x27;saucepan&#x27;) is a kind of large, deep pan or bowl used for cooking a variety of dishes in the oven; it is also a category of foods cooked in such a vessel. To distinguish the two uses, the pan can be called a &quot;casserole dish&quot; or &quot;casserole pan&quot;, whereas the food is simply &quot;a casserole&quot;. The same pan is often used both for cooking and for serving.

==History==


Baked dishes have existed for thousands of years. Early casserole recipes consisted of rice that was pounded, pressed, and filled with a savoury mixture of meats such as chicken or sweetbread. Sometime around the 1870s the casserole seems to have taken on its current definition. Cooking in earthenware containers has always been common in most cultures, but the idea of casserole cooking as a one-dish meal became popular in the United States in the twentieth century, especially in the 1950s when new forms of lightweight metal and glass cookware appeared on the market. By the 1970s casseroles took on a less-than-sophisticated image. Culinary experts, such as John F. Mariani, attribute this to the beginning of the dark ages of American culinary culture.

== American-style casserole ==
In the United States, a casserole or hot dish is typically a baked food with three main components: pieces of meat (such as chicken or ground meat) or fish (such as tuna) or other protein (such as beans or tofu), various chopped or canned vegetables (such as green beans or peas), and a starchy binder (such as flour, potato, rice or pasta); sometimes, there is also a crunchy or cheesy topping. Liquids are released from the meat and vegetables during cooking, and further liquid in the form of stock, wine, beer, gin, cider, vegetable juice, or even water may be added when the dish is assembled. Casseroles are usually cooked slowly in the oven, often uncovered. They may be served as a main course or side dish, and, conveniently, may be served in the vessel in which they were cooked.

== Other cuisines ==
Many baked dishes served in the baking dish can be classed as casseroles. Examples include Lancashire hotpot (English), cassoulet (French), moussaka (Greek), and timballo (Italian).

In English-speaking Commonwealth countries like the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand, the term &quot;casserole&quot; is most commonly used to refer to a dish of meat with vegetables (especially root vegetables) and a gravy-style sauce; dishes containing a large proportion of starchy ingredients, e.g., pasta or those cooked in creamy sauces are not generally referred to as casseroles, and might be called ‘bakes’ or ‘gratins.’ In the UK, the terms casserole and stew tend to be used interchangeably, although some distinguish them by saying stews are cooked on a stovetop while casseroles are cooked in an oven.

<text>Pōmare II (c. 1782 – 7 December 1821) (fully Tu Tunuieaiteatua Pōmare II or in modern orthography Tū Tū-nui-ʻēʻa-i-te-atua Pōmare II; historically misspelled as Tu Tunuiea&#x27;aite-a-tua), was the second king of Tahiti between 1782 and 1821. He was installed by his father Pōmare I at Tarahoi, 13 February 1791. He ruled under regency from 1791 to 1803.

== Life ==
Initially recognised as supreme sovereign and Ariʻi-maro-ʻura by the ruler of Huahine, he was subsequently forced from Tahiti and took refuge in Moʻorea on 22 December 1808, but returned and defeated his enemies at the Battle of Te Feipī, on 11 November 1815.
He was thereafter recognised as undisputed king (Te Ariʻi-nui-o-Tahiti) of Tahiti, Moʻorea and its dependencies.

On 15 November 1815, he proclaimed himself King of Tahiti and Moʻorea in the name of the Christian God.

Pōmare II extended his realm to land outside of the Society Islands. He inherited his father&#x27;s dominion over the Tuamotus and settled many conflicts between the disparate local chieftains in 1817 and 1821. However, his family&#x27;s rule only extended to the eastern and central portions of the Tuamotus archipelago. In 1819, the king took nominal possession of Raivavae and Tubuai in the Austral Islands, although control was relegated to the local chiefs.

== Conversion to Christianity ==
Pomare II believed that he lost favour with the god &#x27;Oro, and, aided by the missionary Henry Nott, he began paying more attention to the God of the Christians.

He was baptised on 16 May 1819 at the Royal Chapel, Papeʻete – Christianity and the support of English missionaries aided the centralisation of monarchic power.

Three London Missionary Society missionaries, Henry Bicknell, William Henry, and Charles Wilson preached at the baptism of King Pōmare II. Afterwards, &quot;Henry Bicknell stood on the steps of the pulpit, took water from a basin held by William Henry, and poured it&quot; on King Pōmare&#x27;s head.

Today a majority of 54% of the French Polynesian population belongs to various Protestant churches, especially the Maohi Protestant Church which is the largest and accounts for more than 50% of the population. It traces its origins to Pomare II, the king of Tahiti, who converted from traditional beliefs to the Reformed tradition brought to the islands by the London Missionary Society.

== Family ==
Pōmare II was married first before March 1797 (betrothed January 1792) to his double first cousin Tetua-nui Taro-vahine, Ariʻi of Vaiari (now Papeari), who died at ʻArue, on 21 July 1806. Around 1809, he married two sisters: Teriʻitoʻoterai Teremoemoe and Teriʻitariʻa who were daughters of Tamatoa III, Ariʻi Rahi of Raiatea.

With his second wife Teriʻitoʻoterai Teremoemoe, he had three children:
*ʻAimata (28 February 1813 – 17 September 1877), who ruled as Pōmare IV
*Teinaiti (21 November 1817 – 20 March 1818), who died young
*Teriʻitariʻa (25 June 1820 – 8 January 1827), who ruled as Pōmare III

== Death ==
Pōmare died of alcohol-related causes at Motu Uta, Papeete, Tahiti on 7 December 1821.

He was succeeded by his son Pōmare III, who reigned 1821–1827.

<doc id="764702" wikidata="Q608897" url="?curid=764702" title="JC Denton">
<text>JC Denton is the player character and protagonist of the first-person role-playing video game &quot;Deus Ex&quot; and a supporting character in its sequel, &quot;Deus Ex: Invisible War&quot;. He is voiced by Jay Anthony Franke in both games. Denton was created by &quot;Deus Ex&quot; director Warren Spector. In his twenties, Denton begins the first &quot;Deus Ex&quot; as a new graduate of UNATCO, and a prized nano-augmented agent. JC is initially dedicated to his duties, but is influenced by his brother, fellow nano-augmented UNATCO agent Paul Denton.

The character was intentionally designed as a blank slate, one which the player could roleplay and immerse themselves in. This characteristic led to criticism by reviewers, who singled out his monotone delivery and lack of prominent personality flaws. Despite this, JC Denton remains a popular and iconic video game character, with critics citing his deadpan humor as a memorable aspect.

==Concept and design==
JC was designed as a blank slate, in accordance with the roleplaying elements of &quot;Deus Ex&quot;. The creators sought to maximize immersion in the game and player freedom. Warren Spector reported taking this &quot;maybe too far&quot; and developers directed Denton&#x27;s voice actor &quot;no emotion in your voice, no inflection, nothing&quot;. Spector continued: &quot;That&#x27;s how far we were willing to go to ensure that the players inhabited the body of the character.&quot;

JC&#x27;s deadpan-voice and sarcasm was an influence for Adam Jensen, protagonist of the prequel series.

&quot;JC Denton&quot; is said to be a codename, and the player can create JC&#x27;s true name and pick from a variety of preset appearances. In addition, JC&#x27;s skill-set and augmentations may be customized, defining JC&#x27;s characteristics. JC&#x27;s personality and morality may be defined by the player, through actions and dialogue choices. JC Denton&#x27;s voice actor, Jay Anthony Franke, was a quality-assurance tester at Ion Storm Studios, and did work on a previous game of the studio, &quot;Daikatana&quot;. This led to him being hired for the role of Denton. Franke was also a tester on &quot;Deus Ex&quot;, his lines not added until the end of production.

Denton is the clone of Paul Denton (also voiced by Franke), the first nano-augmented agent in the &quot;Deus Ex&quot; universe, though ostensibly not the first nano-augmented person. The two came from a family in poverty, until Paul was noticed by members of Majestic-12. In exchange for money, Paul&#x27;s mother carries a clone of him, and eventually gives birth to JC. The two are shepherded by Majestic-12, with their parents murdered and JC put into a Majestic-12 run school.

Paul has been noted by critics to be an anchor for JC, as a non-controllable character whose motivation and actions are not decided by the player. Kirk Hamilton in Kotaku writes &quot;J.C. Denton, by way of our actions, became a hero or a monster, and that transformation was largely reflected through the lens of his brother Paul.&quot;

==Appearances==
===&quot;Deus Ex&quot;===
In the original, Denton begins as a newly graduated nano-augmented agent of UNATCO (United Nations Anti-Terrorist Coalition), fighting the secessionist NSF in New York. However, he learns that he is a pawn of a global conspiracy led by the organisation Majestic-12, and so defects with Paul. The ending of the game allows him to side with the Illuminati to bring about a benevolent conspiracy over the world, destroy the internet and bring about a decentralized dark age over the world, or merge with the artificial intelligence Helios in order to govern the world.

===&quot;Deus Ex: Invisible War&quot;===
In the second game, JC is no longer the player character. &quot;Invisible War&quot; takes place after events that mix elements from multiple of &quot;Deus Ex&quot;″s endings. Denton brings about the collapse of globalized civilization but merges with Helios; however, this merger becomes problematic, almost killing him and forcing him into cryogenic stasis. His two accomplices, Paul and scientist Tracer Tong, both seek to bring about his plans while he is in stasis, by forming the organisation ApostleCorp. ApostleCorp trains JC&#x27;s clone and second sibling, Alex Denton. The transhumanist agenda of ApostleCorp brings it into conflict with other factions in &quot;Invisible War&quot;. Alex awakens JC from stasis, and has the choice of aiding him in his plans to unite humanity in a post-human society or opposing him. If JC is sided with, Helios succeeds in creating a singularity-level society.

==Characteristics==
While the meaning of his initials is never revealed in the games, they were revealed by Warren Spector in 2017 to stand for &quot;Jesus Christ&quot;, as fans had speculated since the game&#x27;s release. Denton&#x27;s full name was based on a friendly exclamation Spector often used, &quot;Jesus Christ, Denton&quot;, referring to his friend, the writer Bradley Denton. This exclamation can be heard in the game shouted by Walton Simons if the player chooses to kill the prisoners while he interrogates them downstairs at UNATCO headquarters. The developers were planning to go further and make Denton a descendant of Jesus Christ, but this was never used in the game.

==Reception==
In 2012, &quot;GamesRadar+&quot; called JC Denton one of the best heroes in gaming, describing him as &quot;the kind of guy you’d bring in if you need something done, and you need it done right&quot;. Characterizing him as a futuristic version of Sherlock Holmes, the site pointed to his intelligence, resourcefulness, and loner attitude as making him effective, while also calling him a &quot;walking biochemistry project&quot; due to his augmentations. Noting that Denton was &quot;always up to the task&quot;, they nevertheless reinforced the fact that the player decided Denton&#x27;s loyalties.

JC Denton and later &quot;Human Revolution&quot; protagonist Adam Jensen have sometimes been compared by critics due to their similarities. Robert Zak of &quot;PCGamesN&quot; stated that, while he believed that Denton and Jensen were similar at first, both being &quot;mild rip-offs of Neo from &quot;The Matrix&quot;&quot;, upon replaying Deus Ex, he realized there was more to Denton than he had remembered. Calling JC a &quot;bloody joker&quot; and &quot;an embodiment of action hero one-liner cheekiness who lightens the tone of a game at just the right moments&quot;, he cited witty retorts made by Denton to the leader of the NSF and fellow agent Anna Navarre. Explaining that Denton had &quot;likeable brashness&quot;, Zak called him &quot;a bit of a dick, but in an irreverent way&quot;, noting that the game had not, like its successors, tried to take its &quot;crackpot&quot; narratives overly seriously. In contrast, he described Jensen&#x27;s dialog as full of &quot;awkwardly written earnestness&quot;. While &quot;Rock Paper Shotgun&quot;″s Alec Meer called Denton the &quot;blankest of blank characters&quot;, he stated that Denton&#x27;s motivations and dynamics were still better than Jensen&#x27;s, due to the supporting characters surrounding him such as Paul Denton.

&quot;Kotaku&quot;″s Kirk Hamilton wrote that the player embodied Denton&#x27;s motivation by pressing the &quot;W&quot; key, allowing him to become either a hero or a monster, while the transformation was depicted via the lens of his brother. Contrasting Denton with Solid Snake, a similar &quot;blank slate&quot; character, he noted that Snake spent the previous decade growing without the player&#x27;s help.

== Legacy ==
In 2021, a fan modding team released the Lay D Denton Project, which restored Ion Storm&#x27;s original vision to have JC Denton be a gender-selectable protagonist, adding a female incarnation of Denton with full voice acting by Karen Rohan that mimicked the original as closely as possible. All references to Denton being male were changed, including splicing the original dialog.

<text>Pōmare III (1820–1827), born Teriʻitariʻa, was the king of Tahiti between 1821 and 1827. He was the second son of King Pōmare II and his second wife, Queen Teriʻitoʻoterai Tere-moe-moe. Sources differ on his relation to his sister with missionary sources citing them as half-siblings while later sources cited Tere-moe-moe as their mother.

== Biography ==

He was born at Papofai, on 25 June 1820, as Teriʻitariʻa, and was baptised 10 September 1820. He succeeded to the throne on the death of his father 7 December 1821. He was crowned at Papaʻoa, ʻArue, 21 April 1824.

The British missionaries decided that Pomare should have a coronation, although Tahitian tradition required investment with a sacred girdle and did not involve the use of a crown. The coronation was arranged by the British missionary Henry Nott and involved a procession of Tahitian judges and other dignitaries as well as British missionaries, accompanying the infant king, seated in a covered chair, to a specially-constructed stone platform. Here he sat behind a table carrying a crown, a bible and a book of Tahitian law. Mr. Davies, a senior missionary, spoke on his behalf, confirming that he agreed to reign with justice and mercy, according to the law and the word of God. Nott then placed the crown on his head.

While Pomare was king the missionaries advanced their own agenda in his name, for example by having him write to George IV to request British protection and the British flag.

He ruled under the regency of his mother Queen Teriʻitoʻoterai Tere-moe-moe, his aunt and stepmother Teriʻitariʻa Ariʻipaeavahine, and the five principal chiefs of Tahiti due to his minority.

Pōmare III&#x27;s education took place at the South Sea Academy, Papetoai, Moʻorea. He died of dysentery in January 1827 and was succeeded by his full sister, ʻAimata Pōmare IV Vahine-o-Punuateraʻitua, who reigned 1827–1877.

<doc id="764709" wikidata="Q1348831" url="?curid=764709" title="Lowell George">
<text>Lowell Thomas George (April 13, 1945 – June 29, 1979) was an American singer, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and record producer. He was the primary guitarist, vocalist, and songwriter for the rock band Little Feat. Before forming Little Feat, he was a member of Frank Zappa&#x27;s band the Mothers of Invention.

==Early life==
Lowell George was born in Los Angeles, California, the son of Willard H. George, a furrier who raised chinchillas and supplied furs to the movie studios.

George&#x27;s first instrument was the harmonica. At the age of six he appeared on &quot;Ted Mack&#x27;s Original Amateur Hour&quot; performing a duet with his older brother, Hampton. As a student at Hollywood High School (where he first befriended future bandmate Paul Barrere and second wife Elizabeth Levy), he took up the flute in the school marching band and orchestra. He had already started to play Hampton&#x27;s acoustic guitar at age 11, progressed to the electric guitar by his high school years, and later learned to play the saxophone, shakuhachi and sitar. During this period, George viewed the teen idol-oriented rock and roll of the era with contempt, instead favoring West Coast jazz and the soul jazz of Les McCann and Mose Allison. Following graduation in 1963, he briefly worked at a gas station (an experience that inspired such later songs as &quot;Willin″&quot;) to support himself while studying art and art history at Los Angeles Valley College for two years.

==Musical career==
===Early bands===
Initially funded by the sale of his grandfather&#x27;s stock, George&#x27;s first band, The Factory, formed in 1965 and released at least one single on the Uni Records label, &quot;Smile, Let Your Life Begin&quot; (co-written by George). Members included future Little Feat drummer Richie Hayward (who replaced Dallas Taylor in September 1966); Martin Kibbee (a.k.a. Fred Martin), who would later co-write several Little Feat songs with George (including &quot;Dixie Chicken&quot; and &quot;Rock and Roll Doctor&quot;); and Warren Klein on guitar. Frank Zappa produced two tracks for the band, but they were not released until 1993 on the album &quot;Lightning-Rod Man&quot;, credited to Lowell George and The Factory. The band made an appearance on the 1960s sitcom &quot;F Troop&quot; as &quot;The Bedbugs&quot;. They were also featured in an episode of &quot;Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.&quot;, &quot;Lost, the Colonel&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (season 3, episode 27). They appeared in the scene inside the A-Go-Go club, with their music playing loudly. They received credit at the end of the episode as The Factory&#x27; Lowell-Warren-Martin-Rich, Courtesy of Universal Records&quot;. Following the disbanding of The Factory, George briefly joined The Standells.

===Zappa and The Mothers of Invention===
In November 1968, George joined Zappa&#x27;s Mothers of Invention as rhythm guitarist and nominal lead vocalist; he can be heard on &quot;Weasels Ripped My Flesh&quot;, &quot;Burnt Weeny Sandwich&quot;, &quot;You Can&#x27;t Do That on Stage Anymore, Vol. 1&quot;, &quot;You Can&#x27;t Do That on Stage Anymore, Vol. 4&quot; and the first disc of &quot;You Can&#x27;t Do That on Stage Anymore, Vol. 5&quot;. During this period, he absorbed Zappa&#x27;s autocratic leadership style and avant garde-influenced conceptual/procedural-oriented compositional methods. He earned his first production credit (in conjunction with Zappa and Russ Titelman) on &quot;Permanent Damage&quot;, an album recorded by &quot;groupie group&quot; The GTOs. George later asserted that &quot;he performed no real function in the band&quot; and left the group in May 1969 under nebulous circumstances. GTOs member Pamela Des Barres has claimed that George was fired by Zappa for smoking marijuana, while George claimed at a 1975 Little Feat concert that he was fired because he &quot;wrote a song [&quot;Willin] about dope.&quot; On the other hand, biographer Mark Brend asserts that Zappa liked the song but thought there was no place for it in the Mothers&#x27; set; George himself alternatively claimed that &quot;it was decided that I should leave and form a band&quot; by mutual agreement. George also claimed to have played uncredited guitar on &quot;Hot Rats&quot;.

===Little Feat===
After leaving the Mothers of Invention, George invited a contingent of fellow musicians (including former Zappa bassist Roy Estrada, keyboardist Bill Payne, and drummer Richie Hayward) to form a new band, which they named Little Feat. George usually (but not always) played lead guitar and focused on slide guitar, but Ry Cooder played the slide on &quot;Willin on the debut Little Feat album after George badly injured his hand while working on a powered model airplane, although George rerecorded some of his material and he played the rest of the slide work on the album. Mark Brend wrote that George&#x27;s &quot;use of compression defined his sound and gave him the means to play his extended melodic lines.&quot; George began playing slide with the casing of a Sears, Roebuck, and Co. Craftsman 13/16&quot; spark plug socket wrench that was given to him by a friend—Steve, whom he had met from New Hampshire—rather than the traditional glass or steel finger tube. (Spark plugs came in two sizes at the time: 13/16&quot; and, later, 5/8&quot;; the former was universal during George&#x27;s time.)

Little Feat signed to Warner Bros. Records through Zappa&#x27;s efforts and their first album was &quot;Little Feat&quot;, produced by Russ Titelman, but it was not a commercial success and only sold 11,000 copies on initial release.

The follow-up album, &quot;Sailin&#x27; Shoes&quot;, produced by Ted Templeman, was the band&#x27;s first record to feature cover artwork by Neon Park, but despite good reviews the album fared no better commercially.
Estrada left the band in 1972 to join Captain Beefheart&#x27;s Magic Band as well as to get away from the pollution in Los Angeles and he was replaced on bass by Kenny Gradney. In addition, Little Feat expanded to a sextet by adding a second guitarist Paul Barrere and percussionist Sam Clayton, thus cementing the classic line-up, and they took on a New Orleans funk direction with their next album, &quot;Dixie Chicken&quot;, the first to be produced by George.

By the spring of 1976, Little Feat were touring North America opening for The Who.

Little Feat released several other studio albums in the 1970s, including &quot;Feats Don&#x27;t Fail Me Now&quot;, &quot;The Last Record Album&quot;, and &quot;Time Loves a Hero&quot;. The group&#x27;s 1978 live album &quot;Waiting for Columbus&quot; became their best-selling album to date. &quot;Down on the Farm&quot; was their last album to feature George, and was released shortly after his death in 1979.

Tensions within the group, especially between George, Payne, and, to a lesser extent, Barrere regarding musical direction and leadership, led to Payne and Barrere&#x27;s departure from the group in 1979 and the group&#x27;s subsequent disbandment. In an interview with Bill Flanagan, conducted 11 days before his death, George stated that he was keen to re-form Little Feat without Payne and Barrere, in order to reassert his full control over the group.

===Record production===
George was also a producer and produced the Grateful Dead&#x27;s 1978 album &quot;Shakedown Street&quot;, as well as Little Feat&#x27;s records and his own 1979 solo album &quot;Thanks, I&#x27;ll Eat It Here&quot;; he also co-produced a couple of tracks on Valerie Carter&#x27;s 1977 release &quot;Just A Stone&#x27;s Throw Away&quot;. In 1977 he co-produced John Starling&#x27;s debut solo album, &quot;Long Time Gone&quot;.

===Session work===
When not playing with Little Feat, George lent his talents as a session player to various artists, most frequently as a slide guitarist. He contributed to Barbara Keith&#x27;s 1972 self-titled debut, John Cale&#x27;s &quot;Paris 1919&quot; (1973), Happy End&#x27;s &quot;Happy End&quot; (1973), Bonnie Raitt&#x27;s &quot;Takin&#x27; My Time&quot; (1973; &quot;I Feel the Same&quot; and &quot;Guilty&quot;), Harry Nilsson&#x27;s &quot;Son of Schmilsson&quot; (1973; &quot;Take 54&quot;), James Taylor&#x27;s &quot;Gorilla&quot; (1975; &quot;Angry Blues&quot;), The Meters&#x27; &quot;Rejuvenation&quot; (1974; &quot;Just Kissed My Baby&quot;), John Sebastian&#x27;s &quot;Tarzana Kid&quot; (1974) and Jackson Browne&#x27;s &quot;The Pretender&quot; (1976).

Along with The Meters, George&#x27;s slide work features prominently on Robert Palmer&#x27;s first solo studio album, &quot;Sneakin&#x27; Sally Through the Alley&quot;, recorded in New Orleans in 1974. A year later, Palmer&#x27;s second album, &quot;Pressure Drop&quot;, was effectively produced by George, and Little Feat served as the core band on the sessions. However, Palmer kept the producer&#x27;s credit because of a dispute between Island Records and Warner Brothers. Later CDs list Steve Smith as producer.

==Death==
On June 15, 1979, George began a tour in support of his solo album, &quot;Thanks I&#x27;ll Eat it Here&quot;. On June 29, the morning after an appearance at Washington, D.C.&#x27;s Lisner Auditorium, where the bulk of &quot;Waiting for Columbus&quot; had been recorded in 1977, George collapsed and died of a heart attack in his Arlington, Virginia, hotel room at the Twin Bridges Marriott. His heart attack was caused by an accidental heroin overdose. George&#x27;s body was cremated in Washington, D.C., on August 2. His ashes were flown back to Los Angeles, where they were scattered from his fishing boat into the Pacific Ocean.

According to Fred Tackett, &quot;We were driving down the New Jersey Turnpike in this bus and we stopped at this pizza joint off the highway. Everybody in the band shared a cheese pizza but Lowell bought a large pizza with everything on it, carried it to the back of the bus, and he ate the entire pizza by himself. He died two or three days later. So, when people ask me, &#x27;What really killed Lowell?&#x27; I say, &#x27;It was a pizza on the New Jersey Turnpike.

<text>Operation Gothic Serpent was a military operation conducted in Mogadishu, Somalia, by an American force code-named &quot;Task Force Ranger&quot; during the Somali Civil War in 1993. The primary objective of the operation was to capture Mohamed Farrah Aidid, leader of the Somali National Alliance who was wanted by the UNOSOM II in response to his attacks against United Nations troops. The operation took place from August to October 1993 and was led by US Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC).

On 3 October 1993, the task force executed a mission to capture two of Aidid&#x27;s lieutenants. The mission ultimately culminated in what became known as the Battle of Mogadishu. The battle was extremely bloody and the task force inflicted significant casualties on Somali militia forces, while suffering heavy losses themselves. The Malaysian, Pakistani, and conventional US Army troops under UNOSOM II which aided in TF Ranger&#x27;s extraction suffered losses as well, though not as heavy. The intensity of the battle prompted the effective termination of the operation on 6 October 1993. This was followed by the withdrawal of TF Ranger later in October 1993, and then the complete exit of American troops in early 1994.

The repercussions of this encounter substantially influenced American foreign policy, culminating in the discontinuation of the UNOSOM II by March 1995. At the time, the Battle of Mogadishu was the most intense, bloodiest single firefight involving US troops since Vietnam.

==Background==

=== Intervention in Somalia ===

In December 1992, US President George H. W. Bush ordered the military to join the UN in a joint operation known as Operation Restore Hope, with the primary mission of restoring order in Somalia. The country had collapsed into civil war in 1991 and the following year a severe famine, induced by the fighting, broke out. Over the next several months, the situation deteriorated.

During the early months of 1993, all the parties involved in the civil war agreed to a disarmament conference held in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Enactment of the agreed upon terms, however, was not so easily achieved. One powerful faction, the Somali National Alliance (SNA) led by Gen. Mohamed Farah Aidid, formed in late 1992 and had become particularly anti-UNOSOM. Major disagreements between the UN and the Somali National Alliance began soon after the establishment of UNOSOM II in March, centering on the perceived true nature of the operation&#x27;s political mandate. By May 1993, relations between the SNA and UNOSOM would rapidly deteriorate.

=== UNOSOM II - SNA conflict ===

On 5 June 1993, one of the deadliest attacks on UN forces in Somalia occurred when 24 Pakistani soldiers were ambushed and killed in an SNA controlled area of Mogadishu. Any hope of a peaceful resolution of the conflict quickly vanished. The next day, the UN Security Council issued Resolution 837, calling for the arrest and trial of those who carried out the ambush. US warplanes and UN troops began an attack on Aidid&#x27;s stronghold. Aidid remained defiant, and the violence between Somalis and UN forces escalated. A significant number of Somali civilians also resented international forces following incidents such as the June 1993 UN mass shooting of protesters and the 12 July 1993 Bloody Monday raid. These events and other incidents led significant numbers of civilians, including women and children, to take up arms and actively resist US and UNOSOM II forces during fighting in Mogadishu. 

Following the 12 July 1993 raid carried out by the US QRF force for UNOSOM II, the conflict began sharply escalating and SNA forces began deliberately targeting American forces in Somalia for the first time. According to US special envoy to Somalia Robert B. Oakley, &quot;Before July 12th, the US would have been attacked only because of association with the UN, but the US was never singled out until after July 12th.&quot; For the remainder of July firefights between the SNA and UNOSOM began occurring almost daily. The SNA would put out a bounty for any American soldier or UN personnel killed, leading to a doubling of attacks against UNOSOM II forces. 

==Task Force Ranger==
On 8 August 1993, Somali National Alliance militia detonated a remote controlled bomb against a US Army vehicle, killing four military policemen. On 19 August, a second bomb attack injured four more soldiers. And on 22 August, a third attack occurred, injuring 6 US soldiers. In response, President Clinton approved Operation Gothic Serpent, which would deploy a 441 man special task force, named Task Force Ranger, to hunt down and capture Aidid. By this time, however, circumstances on the ground had changed significantly and Aidid was in hiding, no longer appearing publicly.

On 22 August, advance forces were deployed to Somalia followed shortly after by the main force on 25 August. TF Ranger, led by Major General William F. Garrison, was under JSOC. Thus, it was not under UN command or the command of US General Thomas M. Montgomery, the deputy commander of UNOSOM II forces as well as commander of US forces in Somalia. Instead, Garrison and TF Ranger received orders directly from CENTCOM.

The force consisted of:
* B Company, 3rd Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment
* C Squadron, 1st Special Forces Operational Detachment-Delta (1st SFOD-D) (also called Delta Force)
* 1st Battalion, 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (160th SOAR), which included 8 MH-60 Black Hawks, 4 AH-6 Little Birds, and 4 MH-6 Little Birds
* Naval Special Warfare Development Group (DEVGRU) SEALs
* 24th Special Tactics Squadron pararescuemen and combat controllers

The task force had intelligence support from a joint effort between CIA officers and Intelligence Support Activity.

==Early missions==
In Mogadishu, the task force occupied an old hangar and construction trailers under primitive conditions, without access to potable water.

Only days after arriving, on 28 August, Somali militia launched a mortar attack on the hangar at 19:27 which injured four Rangers. These mortar attacks became a regular occurrence but rarely caused any further significant injuries.

The task force launched its first raid at 03:09 on 30 August, hitting the Lig Ligato house. There, they captured 9 individuals along with weapons, drugs, communications gear, and other equipment. They were highly embarrassed, however, when it was found out that the prisoners they had taken were actually UN employees. Regardless of the fact that the employees were in a restricted area and were found with weapons and drugs, the incident was ridiculed in the media. Colin Powell, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was reportedly so upset he &quot;had to screw myself off the ceiling&quot;.

Missions followed on 6 September, with a raid on an old Russian compound; 14 September, when they raided the Jialiou house/police station; 17 September, with a raid on Radio Mogadishu; 18 September, a raid on the garages of Osman Atto&#x27;s (the Somali National Alliance&#x27;s chief financier); and 21 September when they captured Osman Atto himself. Local intelligence assets had given Atto a cane that concealed a hidden locating beacon. Delta operators tracked his vehicle convoy via helicopter and disabled Atto&#x27;s vehicle with shots to its engine block before taking him into custody. This was also the first known takedown of a moving vehicle from a helicopter.

To obfuscate when exactly a mission would occur, Garrison had the 160th SOAR conduct flights with soldiers aboard multiple times per day so militia could not rely solely on seeing helicopters to know that a raid was going to occur. They also varied their insertion and extraction tactics, using various permutations of ground vehicle and helicopter-based infil and exfil.

At approximately 0200 on 25 September, Aidid&#x27;s men shot down a Black Hawk with an RPG and killed three crew members at New Port near Mogadishu, though the two pilots, who were both injured, managed to escape and evade to reach friendly units. Pakistani and US forces secured the area and were able to evacuate the casualties. The helicopter and crew were from 9th Battalion, 101st Aviation Regiment and 2nd Battalion, 25th Aviation Regiment, and not part of the Task Force Ranger mission, but the helicopter&#x27;s destruction was still a huge psychological victory for the SNA.

==Battle of Mogadishu==
On the afternoon of 3 October 1993, informed that two lieutenants of Aidid&#x27;s clan were at a residence in the &quot;Black Sea&quot; neighborhood in Mogadishu, the task force sent 19 aircraft, 12 vehicles, and 160 men to capture them. The two Somali lieutenants alongside 22 others were quickly captured and loaded on a convoy of ground vehicles. However, armed militiamen and civilians, some of them women and children, converged on the target area from all over the city. Shortly before the mission was to be concluded, an MH-60 Black Hawk, &quot;Super Six One&quot;, was shot down by SNA forces using a rocket-propelled grenade (RPG). Both of the pilots were killed on impact, but the crew survived the crash landing.

Shortly afterward, another Black Hawk helicopter, &quot;Super Six Four&quot;, was shot down by an RPG fired from the ground. No rescue team was immediately available, and the small surviving crew, including one of the pilots, Michael Durant, couldn&#x27;t move. Two Delta snipers, Master Sergeant Gary Gordon and Sergeant First Class Randy Shughart, provided cover from a helicopter and repeatedly volunteered to secure the crash site. After a 10th Mountain relief force from the Mogadishu airport was halted and turned back by an SNA ambush, Shughart and Gordon were finally granted permission to be inserted. They made their way to the crash site, quickly establishing a perimeter, and securing the surviving crew. The Black Hawk wreck came under heavy attack from the Somali militia, despite attempts from the 160th helicopters overhead to hold back the crowd. After losing close air support to damage from RPG-7 fire, MSG Gordon, SFC Shughart, and the surviving crew of Super 64 were overrun and killed, save for CW3 Durant who was taken hostage. Shughart and Gordon were both posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for their actions.

Meanwhile, the remaining Rangers and Delta operators fought their way to the first crash site. Repeated attempts by the Somalis to overrun US positions were beaten back with heavy small arms fire accompanied by fierce close air support from helicopters. US gunships constantly engaged hostile forces throughout the night, eventually expending nearly 80,000 rounds of ammunition. Consequently the helicopters have been credited with saving US forces from being overrun.

A rescue convoy nearly 70 vehicles long was organized and bolstered by hundreds of UNOSOM II forces, including the 19th Battalion, Royal Malay Regiment (Mech); Pakistani 15 FF Regiment and a squadron of M48 Pattons from 19th Lancers; and US Army 2nd Battalion, 14th Infantry, 10th Mountain Division (which included elements of 1st Battalion, 87th Infantry; 41st Engineer Battalion; and 2nd Battalion, 25th Aviation). After hours of heavy combat with the Somalis, the rescue convoy broke through and extracted the besieged forces.

=== Casualties ===
The mission&#x27;s objective of capturing Aidid&#x27;s associates was accomplished, but the battle turned out to be the most difficult close combat that US troops had engaged in since the Vietnam War. In the end, four MH-60 Black Hawks were shot down by SNA forces with two crashing in hostile territory. 18 Americans were killed and 85–97 wounded along with dozens of UNOSOM troops. In total, the US forces would suffer an estimated 70% casualty rate from the battle.

Two days after the battle&#x27;s end, a Somali mortar strike on their compound killed one Delta Force operator and injured another 12–13 members of TF Ranger.

Somali casualties were estimated to be 314 killed and 812 wounded (including civilians), though figures greatly vary.

== Termination and US withdrawal ==
The American public, outraged at the losses sustained, demanded a withdrawal.

On 6 October 1993, U.S. President Bill Clinton would personally order General Joseph P. Hoar to terminate all combat operations against Somali National Alliance, except in self defence. General Hoar would proceed to relay the stand down order to Generals William F. Garrison of Task Force Ranger and Thomas M. Montgomery of the American Quick Reaction Force. The following day on 7 October, Clinton publicly announced a major change in course in the mission. 

Substantial U.S. forces would be sent to Somalia as short term reinforcements, but all American forces would be withdrawn from the country by the end of March 1994. He would firmly defend American policy in Somalia but admitted that it had been a mistake for American forces to be drawn into the decision &quot;to personalize the conflict&quot; to Aidid. He would go on to reappoint the former U.S. Special Envoy for Somalia Robert B. Oakley to signal the administrations return to focusing on political reconciliation. The stand down order given to U.S. forces in Somalia led other UNOSOM II contingents to effectively avoid any confrontation with the SNA. This led to the majority of UNOSOM patrols in Mogadishu to cease and numerous checkpoints in SNA controlled territory to be abandoned. 

On 9 October 1993, Special Envoy Robert B. Oakley arrived in Mogadishu to obtain the release of captured troops and to consolidate a ceasefire with the Somali National Alliance. Oakley and General Anthony Zinni would both engage in direct negotiations with representatives of the SNA. It was made clear that the manhunt was over, but that no conditions put forward by the SNA would be accepted for the release of prisoners of war. On 14 October, Aidid announced in a brief appearance on CNN the release of Black Hawk pilot Michael Durant. 

Three months later all SNA prisoners in U.N. custody were released including Aidid&#x27;s lieutenants Omar Salad Elmi and Mohamed Hassan Awale, who had been the targets of the 3 October raid.

==Legacy==
US Secretary of Defense Les Aspin resigned his post late in 1993. He was specifically blamed for denying the US Army permission to have its own armor units in place in Somalia, units which might have been able to break through to the trapped soldiers earlier in the battle. US political leaders had, at the time, felt the presence of tanks would taint the peacekeeping image of the mission.

Clinton expressed surprise that the Battle of Mogadishu had even occurred, and later claimed that he had decided on a diplomatic solution before the incident. Despite his apparent reservations there had been no direct orders previously given to TF Ranger to halt operations against the SNA.

The Somali National Alliance viewed the Battle of Mogadishu as a victory against the United States and UNOSOM II. The victory ensured the pullout of US and UN forces and the end to the humanitarian aid which had rescued the country from famine. Osama bin Laden, who was living in Sudan at the time, cited this operation, in particular the US withdrawal, as an example of American weakness and vulnerability to attack.

<text>Pōmare IV (28 February 1813 – 17 September 1877), more properly ʻAimata Pōmare IV Vahine-o-Punuateraʻitua (otherwise known as ʻAimata – &quot;eye-eater&quot;, after an old custom of the ruler to eat the eye of the defeated foe), was the Queen of Tahiti between 1827 and 1877. She was the fourth monarch of the Kingdom of Tahiti.

== Family ==
Pōmare was the daughter of Pōmare II and Teriʻitoʻoterai Tere-moe-moe, his second wife. Her grandfather was Pōmare I.

She succeeded as ruler of Tahiti after the death of her brother Pōmare III when she was only 14 years old.

== Biography ==

In 1843, the French declared Tahiti a French protectorate and installed a governor at Papeete. She fought in vain against French intervention, writing to the King Louis Philippe I of France and Queen Victoria, asking in vain for British intervention, and exiling herself to Raiatea in protest. What followed was the bloody French-Tahitian War which lasted from 1843 to 1847, involving every kingdom of the Society Islands. The Tahitians suffered many casualties, but the French losses were also great. Although the British never assisted the Tahitians, they actively condemned France and war nearly broke between the two powers in the Pacific. These conflicts ended in the defeat of the Tahitian forces at the Fort of Fautaua. The French were victorious, but they weren&#x27;t able to annex the island due to diplomatic pressure from Great Britain, so Tahiti and Moorea continued to be ruled under the French protectorate. A clause to the war settlement was that Queen Pōmare&#x27;s allies in Huahine, Raiatea, and Bora Bora would be allowed to remain independent.

Pōmare IV eventually relented and ruled under the French administration from 1847 until 1877. She attempted to install her children in positions of power in Tahiti and the Leeward Islands. Three of her children were to become monarchs in their own right: King Pōmare V of Tahiti (r. 1877–1880), Queen Teriʻimaevarua II of Bora Bora (r. 1860–1873), King Tamatoa V of Raiatea-Tahaa (r. 1857–1871).

Pōmare IV died on 17 September 1877. She is buried in the Royal Mausoleum, Papaʻoa, ʻArue. She was succeeded by Pōmare V, who reigned 1877–1880.

== Issue ==
In December 1822, Pōmare married the future King Tapoa II of Taha&#x27;a and Bora Bora. In 1830, Tahiti was visited by HMS &quot;Seringapatam&quot;, and her captain William Waldegrave noted in his diary with some surprise that Pōmare was then sixteen years old and married but had no children. The marriage remained childless and ended with the Queen repudiating it on the ground that Tapoa was sterile.

On 5 December 1832, Pōmare was married again, this time to her first cousin, Tenaniʻa Ariʻifaʻaite a Hiro (10 January 1820 – 6 August 1873). By her second husband, she had issue:

# A boy (1833, died young), died of dysentery.
# Henry Pōmare (August 1835, died young), died of dysentery.
# Ariʻiaue Pōmare (12 August 1838 – 10 May 1856), Crown Prince of Tahiti, Ariʻi of Afaʻahiti.
# Pōmare V (3 November 1839 – 12 June 1891), succeeded as King of Tahiti.
# Teriʻimaevarua II (23 May 1841 – 12 February 1873), succeeded as Queen of Bora Bora.
# Tamatoa V (23 September 1842 – 30 September 1881), succeeded as King of Ra&#x27;iātea and Taha&#x27;a.
# Victoria Pōmare-vahine (1844 – June 1845).
# Punuariʻi Teriʻitapunui Pōmare (20 March 1846 – 18 September 1888), Ariʻi of Mahina and President of the Tahitian High Court.
# Teriʻitua Tuavira Pōmare (17 December 1847 – 9 April 1875), Ariʻirahi of Hitiaʻa, called &quot;Prince Joinville&quot;.
# Tevahitua Pōmare (1850/1852, died young).

<doc id="764713" wikidata="Q1364394" url="?curid=764713" title="Torre Picasso">
<text>Torre Picasso (Picasso Tower) is a skyscraper in Madrid, Spain designed by Minoru Yamasaki. From 1988 until 2007 it was the tallest building in Madrid, measuring and with 43 floors. Torre Picasso is located next to the Pablo Picasso Square, within the commercial complex AZCA along the Paseo de la Castellana.

The building is currently the fifth-largest in Madrid and the tenth-tallest building in Spain.

==History==

=== Planning and construction ===
The Torre Picasso was part of a plan to build a large block of modern buildings in the expansion area of northern Madrid. Construction of this area, better known as AZCA, began in 1970 and in 1975 the developer &quot;Unión de Explosivos Río Tinto, S.A.&quot; awarded the design of the tower to American architect Minoru Yamasaki, in collaboration with Jorge Mir Valls and Rafael Coll Pujol. In 1980, Yamasaki received a license to build the highest office complex of Madrid.

Construction began late 1982, and the building opened in December 1988. During this period, construction stalled for a period until new owners &quot;Portland Valderrivas S.A.&quot; and &quot;Inmobiliaria Asón S.A.&quot;, purchased the incomplete structure and relaunched work in 1985 under the direction of architect Fernando Alas. In 2002, Fomento de Construcciones y Contratas (FCC) regained control of the building through a purchase of Portland Valderrivas. FCC owned the tower until December 2011 when Pontegadea Inmobiliaria, a division of Industria de Diseño Textil, S.A. purchased the structure for €400 million. PER Gestora Inmobiliaria, S.L.manages the building.

=== Skyline position ===

At its opening in 1988, Torre Picasso surpassed the elder office tower Torre de Madrid. Notable surrounding skyscrapers are Torre Europa, Banco de Bilbao Tower and Torre Titania. Torre Picasso was Spain&#x27;s tallest building until 2001, when it was overtaken by the Gran Hotel Bali in Benidorm, Alicante, the Torre Espacio in 2007, and Torre Caja Madrid, Torre de Cristal and Torre Sacyr Vallehermoso since 2009.

== Figures and statistics ==

The following information can be found on the official website of Torre Picasso:

* Height: above ground ( including basement)
* 43 floors
** 5 basement floors (first level is a commercial area, others are parking)
** ground floor houses the lobby
** 42 floors house offices
** 44th floor contains mechanical equipment
** 45th floor contains the heliport
* Area: office space, in total
* Size per floor: 
* 26 elevators; 18 serve office floors divided into three zones:
** 1st-18th floors at 
** 18th-32nd floors at 
** 32nd-43rd floors at (fastest in Spain)
* Glass façade surface: 
* Parking space: 837
* Foreseen population: 6,000 persons
* Daily visitors: 1,500 persons

==Architecture==
The structure has a rectangular footprint with a windowless two-storey base. A wide round arch, resting on an underground steel structure for support, serves as the entrance and supports the façade above. The opening under this arch is covered by a special security glass named &quot;STADIP&quot; (the one used in Torre Agbar in Barcelona). Windows on floors 3 through 43 are grouped in twos divided by a slender pier. The groupings are divided by larger piers into 15 bays across the front of the building and 11 bays on the sides. The façade is covered in white aluminum and the corners of the structure are chamfered. The top two floors are also windowless and the parapet flares to form a cornice. Elevators, in three groupings, occupy a bay in the rear of the structure along with stairways.

==Cultural depictions==
* The tower was previously home to the Canal+ TV studios.
* It was featured in the last scenes of Alejandro Amenábar&#x27;s 1997 movie &quot;Open Your Eyes&quot;. Lead character César (portrayed by Eduardo Noriega) commits suicide by jumping from the Torre Picasso.
* It was featured in the Crisis (TV series) pilot as the Porter Pearce HQ though the action is supposed to happen in the DC area.

<doc id="764719" wikidata="Q4116971" url="?curid=764719" title="Mercurial diuretic">
<text>Mercurial diuretics are a form of renal diuretic containing mercury.

Although previously widely used, they have largely been superseded by safer diuretics such as thiazides, and are now rarely used.
==History and mechanism==
Inorganic mercury compounds, such as mercury(I)chloride (calomel), were found to have diuretic properties when they were used to treat syphilis. Proposed use of these compounds date back at least to the 16th century, shortly after the beginning of the syphilis epidemic in 1497 following Columbus&#x27; return to Europe.

Mercurial diuretics cause diuresis by reducing the reabsorption of sodium in the ascending loop of Henle, thus causing more water being delivered to the distal convoluted tubule. Unfortunately, earlier physicians misconstrued hallmark symptoms of mercury poisoning such as excessive salivation as signs of mercury&#x27;s efficacy until the early 1960s, when the use of mercurial diuretics was halted in medicine.

==Side effects==
Due to the idiosyncratic nature of mercury toxicity, the risk of severe disease and sudden death are unpredictable and frequently show no warning signs. Physicians during the 20th century believed that a fever/rash complex suggested the risk of severe side effects for the next upcoming doses if treatment was not halted. Warkany and Hubbard noted in their seminal 1953 paper establishing mercury as the cause of infantile acrodynia that &quot;... in modern times the capricious behavior of mercurial diuretics has been rather disturbing to those who use them frequently. Thousands of injections are given without untoward effects but occasionally a therapeutic dose results in sudden death. Only rarely is this caused by the first dose. More often the patient tolerates several—in one case 164—doses before the fatal reaction occurs. The mechanism of these reactions is not clear: they can neither be explained nor predicted; yet they cannot be denied.&quot;

After finding associations between mercurial diuretics and &quot;mercurial&quot; nephrotic syndrome, in addition to the sharp decline in infantile acrodynia cases after the late 1950s following the removal of many sources of childhood mercury exposure, the dangers of mercurial diuretics were realized. This led to the discontinuation of mercurial diuretics in favor of far less toxic and far more effective diuretics. This is similar to the fashion in which penicillin quickly replaced arsenic and mercury as the main antibiotic used in the treatment of syphilis for both children and adults.

<text>Andrei Ivanovich Zhelyabov (; – ) was a Russian revolutionary and member of the executive committee of Narodnaya Volya.

After graduating from a gymnasium in Kerch in 1869, Zhelyabov got into a Law School of the Novorossiysky University in Odessa. He was expelled from the university for his participation in student unrests in October 1871 and sent away from Odessa. In 1873, Zhelyabov lived in a town of Gorodische (present-day Cherkas&#x27;ka oblast&#x27; of Ukraine) and maintained close ties with revolutionaries from Kiev and activists of the Ukrainian &quot;Hromada&quot;. After his return to Odessa, Zhelyabov became a member of the revolutionary Felix Volkhovsky group (the Odessa affiliate of “Chaikovtsi”) and conducted propaganda among workers and intelligentsia. He was arrested in late 1874 and then released on bail. Nevertheless, he continued his illegal activities. Zhelyabov was one of the suspects in the &quot;Trial of the 193&quot;. After his acquittal in 1878, he moved to Podolsk province for the purpose of spreading revolutionary propaganda among the peasantry.

Zhelyabov gradually came to support violent political struggle and terror. He participated in the Lipetsk Congress of political terrorists in June 1879. Zhelyabov was accepted in “Zemlya i volya” at the Voronezh Congress of its members and came forward as one of the chief defenders of terrorism. After the split of &quot;Zemlya i volya&quot;, he was one of the main organizers of &quot;Narodnaya volya&quot; and its newspaper &quot;Worker’s Gazette&quot; (fall of 1880). Zhelyabov took active part in devising a few of the most important documents of the party&#x27;s Program. Also, he was one of the chief organizers of the assassination of Alexander II of Russia on March 1, 1881. However, he had been arrested a few days before it actually happened. Zhelyabov demanded that his case be considered together with the case of the Pervomartovtsi. He was executed by hanging on April 3, 1881, with the rest of the terrorists, including his wife Sophia Perovskaya.

In admiration of Zhelyabov&#x27;s dedication to his revolutionary cause, Vladimir Lenin went as far as to compare him with other great revolutionaries, such as Maximilien Robespierre and Giuseppe Garibaldi.

<doc id="764733" wikidata="Q3066761" url="?curid=764733" title="Mizrahi Hebrew">
<text>Mizrahi Hebrew, or Eastern Hebrew, refers to any of the pronunciation systems for Biblical Hebrew used liturgically by Mizrahi Jews: Jews from Arab countries or east of them and with a background of Arabic, Persian or other languages of Asia. As such, Mizrahi Hebrew is actually a blanket term for many dialects.

Sephardi Hebrew is not considered one of these, even if it has been spoken in the Middle East and North Africa. The Sephardim were expellees from Spain and settled among the Mizrahim, but in countries such as Syria and Morocco, there was a fairly high degree of convergence between the Sephardi and the local pronunciations of Hebrew. Yemenite Hebrew is also considered quite separate, as it has a wholly different system for the pronunciation of vowels.

The same terms are sometimes used for the pronunciation of Modern Hebrew by Jews of Mizrahi origins. It is generally a compromise between Modern Standard Hebrew and the traditional liturgical pronunciation as described in this article. A common form of such compromise is the use of , and for , and , respectively, with most or all other sounds pronounced as in Standard Israeli Hebrew.

==Features==

The following features are generally found in the pronunciation of Jews from Arabic-speaking countries, and the variations tend to follow the Arabic dialect of the country in question.
*The stress tends to fall on the last syllable wherever that is the case in Biblical Hebrew.
* (Aleph) is pronounced with a clear glottal stop except when it is used as a mater lectionis.
* (Bet without dagesh) is pronounced in some countries (such as among some Syrians) and (voiced labiodental fricative) in others (such as Morocco). In Iraq, it is pronounced /β/, between a /w/ and /b/ sound. 
* (Gimel without &quot;dagesh&quot;) is pronounced (voiced velar fricative) like Arabic .
* (Dalet without &quot;dagesh&quot;) is normally pronounced , but occasionally (such as in the Iraqi pronunciation of the words and, in the Shema only, ) , like Arabic (voiced dental fricative).
* (Vav) is pronounced in some countries and in others (such Iraq).
* (Ḥet) is pronounced , like Arabic (voiceless pharyngeal fricative).
* (Ṭēth) is pronounced , like Arabic (pharyngealized voiceless alveolar stops).
* (Kaph without &quot;dagesh&quot;) is pronounced , like Arabic (voiceless velar fricative).
* (Ayin) is pronounced , like the Arabic (voiced pharyngeal fricative).
* (Tsade) is pronounced , like Arabic (pharyngealized voiceless alveolar fricative).
* (Qoph) is usually pronounced like Arabic (voiceless uvular stop), but other sounds occur such as , or (glottal stop).
* (Resh) is trilled , even among Baghdadi Jews, who pronounced the equivalent letter in Judaeo-Arabic as a uvular , close to Arabic .
* (Tav without &quot;dagesh&quot;) is pronounced in some countries and —like Arabic (voiceless dental fricative)—in others, such as Iraq.
*Vowels generally have the same sounds as in Sephardi Hebrew:
**Tzere is pronounced .
**Holam is pronounced .
**Kamatz gadol is pronounced .

The pronunciation of Mizrahi Jews from non-Arab countries differs in some respects. For example, among Persian Jews, distinctively Arabic sounds such as and do not occur, and certain sounds do occur which are not present in other forms of Mizrahi Hebrew. For example, Kamatz gadol is pronounced , like the long in Persian, (Qof) is approximately pronounced (voiced velar fricative), and ח (Het) is pronounced identical to ה (Hay), as opposed to the Arab 

==History==

In Talmudic times, it was noted that the Galilean (and maybe Syrian) pronunciation of Hebrew and Aramaic differed from those of both Judaea and Babylonia, principally by the loss of distinct sounds for the guttural letters he, ḥet, and ʿayin. That feature is still found in Samaritan Hebrew.

After the Arab conquest of Palestine and Mesopotamia, much work was done by the Masoretes in standardising and refining the pronunciation of Biblical Hebrew, under the influence of the Arabic grammarians of the time. That included establishing the pronunciation of the guttural letters by reference to their Arabic equivalents. Three distinct notations for the vowels were devised: the Palestinian, the Babylonian and the Tiberian, the last of which eventually superseded the others.

The distinctive Babylonian pronunciation of Geonic times is still preserved by Yemenite Jews, but they do not retain the Babylonian notation. In Iraq, it appears to have been superseded by the Palestinian pronunciation (similar to today&#x27;s Sephardi Hebrew) in or around the 11th century, when the Tiberian notation was adopted: both Saadia Gaon and Jacob Qirqisani report that in their time the Palestinian pronunciation had come to be regarded as standard. Nevertheless, in their reading of unvocalised texts such as the Mishnah, Baghdadi Jews preserve certain peculiarities of the old Babylonian pronunciation, particularly with their choices between dagesh and rafe and between silent and vocal &quot;sheva&quot;.

The process of assimilation to Arabic went the furthest with the Babylonian Jews. For example, in Classical Arabic and in some spoken dialects including Mesopotamian Arabic, there is no phonemic distinction between and , but a phonetic difference is made by the presence of an adjacent emphatic or guttural consonant. Accordingly, the Babylonian notation does not distinguish between patach (in other pronunciations ), segol (in other pronunciations or ) and sheva na&#x27;, and the three vowels are still pronounced alike (as ) by Yemenite Jews. In Levantine Arabic, by contrast, there are distinct and sounds, and both vowels are distinguished in both the Palestinian and the Tiberian notations.

After the expulsion of the Jews from Spain in 1492, Sephardic exiles took the leading position in most Arab and Ottoman countries, and the local pronunciation of Hebrew assimilated to Sephardi Hebrew in many respects, particularly for pronouncing the vowels. Today&#x27;s Iraqi Jews distinguish between patach () and segol () in the same way as most other Sephardi and Mizrahi Jews. However, distinct sounds for the guttural and emphatic letters and the sound for bet rafe were retained in many Arab countries, probably under the influence of Arabic.

Iraqi Jews, like Yemenite Jews, retain the Classical Arabic sounds of waw () and tav raphe (). In other Arab countries, &quot;tav raphe&quot; is pronounced , which is equally consistent with the pronunciation of both Sephardi Hebrew and of colloquial Arabic. The pronunciation of &quot;waw&quot; as , in countries other than Iraq and Yemen, is more clearly Sephardic in origin.

<text>Grace Melzia Bumbry (January 4, 1937 – May 7, 2023) was an American opera singer, considered one of the leading mezzo-sopranos of her generation, who also ventured to soprano roles. She belonged to a pioneering generation of African-American classical singers, led by Marian Anderson. She was recognized internationally when Wieland Wagner cast her for the 1961 Bayreuth Festival as Venus in &quot;Tannhäuser&quot;, the first black singer to appear at the festival.

Bumbry&#x27;s voice was rich and dynamic, possessing a wide range, and was capable of producing a very distinctive plangent tone. In her prime, she also possessed good agility and bel canto technique, as for example her rendition of Eboli in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Don Carlo&quot; in the 1970s and 1980s. She was particularly noted for her fiery temperament and dramatic intensity on stage. Later, she also became known as a recitalist and interpreter of lieder, and as a teacher. From the late 1980s on, she concentrated her career in Europe, rather than in the United States. A long-time resident of Switzerland, she spent her last years in Vienna.

== Early life and education ==
Grace Ann Melzia Bumbry was born in St. Louis, Missouri, on January 4, 1937. She was the third child of Benjamin Bumbry, a railroad freight handler, and Melzia Bumbry, a teacher. They were a family of modest means, deeply religious and highly musical. Bumbry trained in classical piano beginning at age 7, but determined she would become a singer after seeing Marian Anderson in concert. She joined the local Methodist choir at age 12, and performed as a soloist in a school production of Handel&#x27;s &quot;Messiah&quot;. She listened to Anderson on radio and in recordings &quot;at every opportunity&quot;, and was also inspired to become a singer by listening to the St. Louis Symphony conducted by Vladimir Golschmann.

Bumbry graduated from the prestigious Charles Sumner High School, the first black high school west of the Mississippi. She later credited Kenneth Billups, her voice teacher at Sumner (together with a later teacher, Armand Tokatyan of Santa Barbara) for her &quot;vocal prowess&quot;. At age 17, at the urging of Billups and Sara Hopes, her choir director, she entered and won a teen talent contest sponsored by St. Louis radio station KMOX. Prizes for first place included a $1,000 war bond, a trip to New York, and a scholarship to the St. Louis Institute of Music. However, the institution excluded African Americans, and her parents refused the offer of private lessons instead.

Embarrassed, the contest promoters arranged for her to appear on Arthur Godfrey&#x27;s national radio broadcast &quot;Talent Scouts&quot; program, singing Verdi&#x27;s aria &quot;O don fatale&quot; from &quot;Don Carlos&quot;. It moved Godfrey to tears. The success of that performance led to an opportunity to study at the Boston University College of Fine Arts. She later transferred to Northwestern University, where she met Lotte Lehmann, a German dramatic soprano, especially for Wagner roles, who gave master classes there and was impressed.

Lehmann invited Bumbry to study with her in Santa Barbara, California. Initially planned for just the summer of 1955, Bumbry remained on a scholarship by Lehmann for three and a half years. During this time, she studied piano and theory (with György Sándor), and then studied further interpretation and languages, and attended the summer programm of the Music Academy of the West in Montecito in three consecutive years, 1956, 57 and 58. Lehmann was also her mentor in her early career. Bumbry also studied with renowned teachers Marinka Gurewich and Armand Tokatyan. She studied singing lieder with Pierre Bernac in Paris.

== Career ==
In 1958, she was a joint winner of the Metropolitan Opera National Council Auditions with soprano Martina Arroyo; later that year, she made her recital debut in Paris. Bumbry made her operatic debut in 1960 when she sang Amneris in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Aida&quot; at the Paris Opéra; that same year she joined the Basel Opera, where she was based for four years. Her roles there included Bizet&#x27;s Carmen, Dalila in &quot;Samson et Dalila&quot; by Saint-Saëns, Orfeo in Gluck&#x27;s &quot;Orfeo ed Euridice&quot;, and Verdi&#x27;s Lady Macbeth and Azucena.

=== International popularity ===
Bumbry gained international renown when she was cast by Wieland Wagner, Wagner&#x27;s grandson, as Venus in &quot;Tannhäuser&quot; at the 1961 Bayreuth Festival, at age 24, the first black singer to appear there, which earned her the nickname &quot;Black Venus&quot;. The cast included Victoria de los Ángeles as Elisabeth, Wolfgang Windgassen in the title role, Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau as Wolfram, and the opera was conducted by Wolfgang Sawallisch. She caused a sensation; while conservative opera-goers were outraged at the idea, Bumbry&#x27;s performance was so moving that by the end of the opera she had won the audience over and they applauded for 30 minutes, necessitating 42 curtain calls.

The ensuing furor in the media made Bumbry an international &quot;cause célèbre&quot;. She was invited by Jacqueline Kennedy to sing at the White House in 1962. She returned to the White House in 1981, singing at the Ronald Reagan inauguration.

In November 1962, she starred in the title role of the musical &quot;Carmen Jones&quot; in a studio cast album recorded in London with British performers and an orchestra conducted by Kenneth Alwyn.

Bumbry made her debut at the Royal Opera House in London in 1963 as Eboli, alongside Boris Christoff as the king and Tito Gobbi as Posa, in a 1958 production by Luchino Visconti. In 1964, she made her debut at the Vienna State Opera as Santuzza in Mascagni&#x27;s &quot;Cavalleria rusticana&quot;, and at the Salzburg Festival as Verdi&#x27;s Lady Macbeth, opposite Fischer-Dieskau&#x27;s Macbeth. She made her debut at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City in 1965, again as Eboli. A reviewer noted:

In 1966 she appeared as Carmen opposite Jon Vickers&#x27;s Don José in two different lauded productions, one with conductor Herbert von Karajan in Salzburg, and the other for her debut with the San Francisco Opera. She first appeared at La Scala in Milan as Azucena. She returned to the San Francisco Opera in 1967 for her first performance of Laura Adorno in Ponchielli&#x27;s &quot;La Gioconda&quot; alongside Leyla Gencer in the title role, Renato Cioni as Enzo Grimaldi, Maureen Forrester as La Cieca and Chester Ludgin as Barnaba. Other major mezzo-soprano roles in her repertoire included the title role in Massenet&#x27;s &quot;Hérodiade&quot;, Ulrica in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Un ballo in maschera&quot;, and the title role of &quot;Telemaco&quot;. In 1990, she appeared as both Cassandre and Didon in &quot;Les Troyens&quot; by Berlioz for the opening of the Opera Bastille in Paris.

=== Soprano roles ===
In the 1970s, Bumbry, having recorded many soprano arias, began taking on soprano roles on stage. The first official soprano role was Salome by Richard Strauss at the Royal Opera House in 1970. She first appeared as Puccini&#x27;s Tosca at the Metropolitan Opera in 1971, and then at La Scala in 1974. Later roles at the Metropolitan Opera included Leonora in both &quot;Il trovatore&quot; and &quot;La forza del destino&quot; and Bess in Gershwin&#x27;s &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot;.

She also took on more unusual roles, such as Janáček&#x27;s Jenůfa (in Italian) at La Scala in 1974, with Magda Olivero as the Kostelnička, and Ariane in &quot;Ariane et Barbe-bleue&quot; by Paul Dukas in Paris in 1975. Bumbry first appeared as Norma in 1977 in Martina Franca, Italy. The following year, she sang both Adalgisa and Norma in the same production at the Royal Opera House, first opposite Montserrat Caballé as Norma; later with Josephine Veasey as Adalgisa. She first performed as Sélika in Meyerbeer&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Africaine&quot; in London in 1978.

She also assumed roles such as Abigaille in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Nabucco&quot; and La Gioconda. Other noted soprano roles included Chimène in &quot;Le Cid&quot;, Elisabeth in &quot;Tannhäuser&quot;, and Elvira in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Ernani&quot;.

=== Later career ===
In 1998 she was interviewed by August Everding for her career in German. In the 1990s, Bumbry founded the Grace Bumbry Black Musical Heritage Ensemble, a group devoted to preserving and performing traditional Negro spirituals; she toured with the group. She then devoted herself to teaching, judging international competitions, and to the concert stage, giving a series of recitals in 2001 and 2002 in honor of her teacher, Lotte Lehmann, including at the Théâtre du Châtelet in Paris, London&#x27;s Wigmore Hall and New York&#x27;s Alice Tully Hall. She was sometimes accompanied by pianist Sebastian Peschko.

In 2010, after an absence of many years from the opera stage, she performed in Scott Joplin&#x27;s &quot;Treemonisha&quot; at the Theatre du Chatelet in Paris, She appeared at the Deutsche Oper Berlin as the Old Lady in Bernstein&#x27;s &quot;Candide&quot; in 2012, and finally as the Countess in Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;Pique Dame&quot; at the Vienna State Opera on January 30, 2013, conducted by Seiji Ozawa.

Her advice to young singers was:

=== Personal life and death ===
In 1963, Bumbry married the Polish-born tenor Erwin Jaeckel. They divorced in 1972. Jack V. Lunzer, her long-term partner, died in 2016.

On October 20, 2022, Bumbry was on a flight from Vienna to New York when she had a stroke. Her health declined over the following months, and she died from related complications at a hospital in Vienna on May 7, 2023, at age 86.

== Vocal range ==
Bumbry&#x27;s career in the world of opera was a remarkable and long one, if somewhat controversial. Initially, Bumbry began her career as a mezzo-soprano, but later expanded her repertoire to include many dramatic soprano roles. In the mid-1970s and 1980s she considered herself a soprano; but in the 1990s, as her career approached its twilight, she often returned to mezzo roles.

She was one of the more successful singers who have made the transition from mezzo-soprano to soprano (along with her compatriot and contemporary Shirley Verrett, as well as contemporary Welsh mezzo-sorano-turned-soprano Gwyneth Jones); however, audiences and critics were divided over whether she was a &quot;true&quot; soprano. Nonetheless, she sang major soprano roles at most major opera houses around the world up until the end of her operatic career in the 1990s—singing Puccini&#x27;s Turandot at the Royal Opera House in 1993. Her main operatic career spanned from 1960, her debut in Paris as Amneris, to 1997 as Klytämnestra in Lyon.

== Recordings ==
Bumbry&#x27;s earliest recordings are of oratorios made in the late 1950s with the Utah Symphony conducted by Maurice Abravanel, including Handel&#x27;s &quot;Israel in Egypt&quot; and &quot;Judas Maccabeus&quot;. She recorded Handel&#x27;s &quot;Messiah&quot; in London in 1961 conducted by Adrian Boult, alongside Joan Sutherland and Kenneth McKellar.

In aria compilations, she included both mezzo and soprano repertoire early. Much of her recorded legacy is from her mezzo period, including at least two recordings of &quot;Carmen&quot; and recordings with her as Amneris, Venus (with Anja Silja as Elisabeth, from the 1962 Bayreuth Festival), Eboli, Abigaille, Orfeo, Lady Macbeth (from the 1984 Salzburg Festival), and in Verdi&#x27;s Messa da Requiem at the Royal Festival Hall in April 1964.

While there are no commercially released complete studio opera recordings with her in a soprano role, live performances were recorded of &quot;Le Cid&quot; (with the Opera Orchestra of New York), &quot;Jenůfa&quot; at La Scala, and &quot;Norma&quot; in Martina Franca. She also recorded music for the musical &quot;Carmen Jones&quot;, based on the Bizet opera; as well as operetta such as &quot;Der Zigeunerbaron&quot; by Johann Strauß.

== Honors ==
Among other honors, a UNESCO Award, five Distinguished Alumna Awards from the Music Academy of the West and Italy&#x27;s Premio Giuseppe Verdi were bestowed on Bumbry and she was named Commandeur des Arts et Lettres by the French government. She received a Grammy Award in 1972 for Best Opera Recording. In 1992, Bumbry was inducted into the St. Louis Walk of Fame. In 2005, she was presented with The Arts for Life Lifetime Achievement Award by the Marian Anderson Award Foundation. In December 2009, she was among those honored with the 2009 Kennedy Center Honors, for her contribution to the performing arts.

<text>Pōmare V (3 November 1839 – 12 June 1891) was the last monarch of Tahiti, reigning from 1877 until his forced abdication in 1880. He was the son of Queen Pōmare IV.

== Biography ==

He was born as Teri&#x27;i Tari&#x27;a Te-rā-tane and became Heir Apparent and Crown Prince (&quot;Ari&#x27;i-aue&quot;) upon the death of his elder brother on 13 May 1855. He became king of Tahiti on the death of his mother on 17 September 1877. His coronation was on 24 September 1877 at Pape&#x27;ete.

He married twice, first on 11 November 1857 to Te-mā-ri&#x27;i-Ma&#x27;i-hara Te-uhe-a-Te-uru-ra&#x27;i, princess of Huahine. He divorced her on 5 August 1861. His second marriage was to Joanna Marau-Ta&#x27;aroa Te-pa&#x27;u Salmon (thereafter known as Her Majesty The Queen Marau of Tahiti), at Pape&#x27;ete on 28 January 1875. He divorced her on 27 July 1887.

Pōmare V had one son and two daughters.

On 29 June 1880, he gave Tahiti and its dependencies to France, whereupon he was given a pension by the French government and the titular position of Officer of the Orders of the Legion of Honour and Agricultural Merit of France.

He died at the Royal Palace, Pape&#x27;ete, and is buried at the Tomb of the King, Utu&#x27;ai&#x27;ai in &#x27;Arue.

<doc id="764772" wikidata="Q1360624" url="?curid=764772" title="Operation Varsity">
<text>Operation Varsity (24 March 1945) was a successful airborne forces operation launched by Allied troops toward the end of World War II. Involving more than 16,000 paratroopers and several thousand aircraft, it is the largest airborne operation ever conducted on a single day and in one location.

&quot;Varsity&quot; was part of Operation Plunder, the Anglo-American-Canadian effort, led by Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery, to cross the northern Rhine River and from there enter Northern Germany. &quot;Varsity&quot; was meant to help the surface river assault troops secure a foothold across the Rhine in Western Germany by landing two airborne divisions on its eastern bank near the village of Hamminkeln and the town of Wesel.

The plans called for dropping two divisions from U.S. XVIII Airborne Corps, under Major General Matthew B. Ridgway, to capture key territory and to generally disrupt German defenses to aid the advance of Allied ground forces. The British 6th Airborne Division was to capture the villages of Schnappenberg and Hamminkeln, clear part of the Diersfordter Wald (Diersfordt Forest) of German forces, and secure three bridges over the River Issel. The U.S. 17th Airborne Division was to capture the village of Diersfordt and clear the rest of the Diersfordter Wald of any remaining German forces. The two divisions would hold the territory they had captured until relieved by advancing units of 21st Army Group, and then join in the general advance into northern Germany.

The airborne forces made several mistakes. Pilot error caused paratroopers from the 513th Parachute Infantry Regiment, a regiment of the U.S. 17th Airborne Division, to miss their drop zone and land on a British drop zone instead. Still, the operation was a success: both divisions captured Rhine bridges and secured towns that could have been used by Germany to delay the advance of the British ground forces. The two divisions incurred more than 2,000 casualties, but captured about 3,500 German soldiers. The operation was the last large-scale Allied airborne operation of World War II.

==Background==

By March 1945, the Allied armies had advanced into Germany and had reached the River Rhine. The Rhine was a formidable natural obstacle to the Allied advance, but if breached would allow the Allies to access the North German Plain and ultimately advance on Berlin and other major cities in Northern Germany. Following the Broad Front approach laid out by General Eisenhower, the Supreme Allied Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force, it was decided to attempt to breach the Rhine in several areas. Field Marshal Sir Bernard Montgomery, commanding the Anglo-Canadian 21st Army Group, devised Operation Plunder, subsequently authorized by Eisenhower, for a Rhine crossing by the forces under his command. Plunder envisioned the British Second Army, under Lieutenant-General Miles C. Dempsey, and the U.S. Ninth Army, under Lieutenant General William Simpson, crossing the Rhine at Rees, Wesel, and an area south of the Lippe Canal.

To ensure that the operation was a success, Montgomery insisted that an airborne component be inserted into the plans for the operation, to support the amphibious assaults that would take place; this was code-named Operation Varsity. Three airborne divisions were initially chosen to participate in the operation, these being the British 6th Airborne Division, the U.S. 13th Airborne Division and the U.S. 17th Airborne Division, all of which were assigned to U.S. XVIII Airborne Corps, commanded by Major General Matthew B. Ridgway. One of these airborne formations, the British 6th Airborne Division, commanded by Major-General Eric Bols, was a veteran division; it had taken part in Operation Overlord, the assault on Normandy in June the previous year. However, the U.S. 17th Airborne Division, under Major General William Miley, had been activated only in April 1943 and had arrived in Britain in August 1944, too late to participate in Operation Overlord. The division did not participate in Operation Market Garden. It did, however, participate in the Ardennes campaign but had yet to take part in a combat drop. The U.S. 13th Airborne Division, under Major General Eldridge Chapman, had been activated in August 1943 and was transferred to France in 1945; the formation itself had never seen action, although one of its regiments, the 517th Parachute Infantry, had fought briefly in Italy, and later in Southern France and the Ardennes campaign.

==Prelude==
===Allied preparation===
Operation Varsity was planned with these three airborne divisions in mind, with all three to be dropped behind German lines in support of the 21st Army Group as it conducted its amphibious assaults to breach the Rhine. During the earliest planning stages, it became apparent that the 13th Airborne Division would be unable to participate in the operation, as there were only enough combat transport aircraft in the area to transport two divisions effectively. The operation was then altered to accommodate the two remaining airborne divisions, the British 6th and U.S. 17th Airborne Divisions. The two airborne divisions would be dropped behind German lines, with their objective to land around Wesel and disrupt enemy defences in order to aid the advance of the British Second Army towards Wesel.

To achieve this, both divisions would be dropped near the village of Hamminkeln, and were tasked with a number of objectives: they were to seize the Diersfordter Wald, a forest that overlooked the Rhine, including a road linking several towns together; several bridges over a smaller waterway, the River Issel, were to be seized to facilitate the advance; and the village of Hamminkeln was to be captured. The Diersfordter Wald was chosen by Lieutenant-General Dempsey, the British Second Army commander, as the initial objective because its seizure would deny the Germans artillery positions from which they could disrupt Second Army&#x27;s bridging operations. Once these objectives were taken, the airborne troops would consolidate their positions and await the arrival of Allied ground forces, defending the territory captured against the German forces known to be in the area.

Operation Varsity would be the largest single-lift airborne operation conducted during the conflict; more significantly, it would contradict previous airborne strategy by having the airborne troops drop &quot;after&quot; the initial amphibious landings, in order to minimize the risks to the airborne troops learned from the experiences of Operation Market Garden, the attempt to capture the Rhine bridges in the Netherlands in 1944. Unlike Market Garden, the airborne forces would be dropped only a relatively short distance behind German lines, thereby ensuring that reinforcements in the form of Allied ground forces would be able to link up with them within a short period: this avoided risking the same type of disaster that had befallen the British 1st Airborne Division when it had been isolated and practically annihilated by German infantry and armour at Arnhem. It was also decided by the commander of the First Allied Airborne Army, General Lewis H. Brereton, who commanded all Allied airborne forces, including U.S. XVIII Airborne Corps, that the two airborne divisions participating in Operation Varsity would be dropped simultaneously in a single &quot;lift&quot;, instead of being dropped several hours apart, addressing what had also been a problem during Operation Market Garden. Supply drops for the airborne forces would also be made as soon as possible to ensure adequate supplies were available to the airborne troops as they fought.

By this period of the conflict, the number of German divisions remaining on the Western Front was rapidly declining, both in numbers and quality, a fact in the Allies&#x27; favour. By the night of 23 March, Montgomery had the equivalent of more than 30 divisions under his command, while the Germans fielded around 10 divisions, all weakened from constant fighting. The best German formation the Allied airborne troops would face was the 1st Parachute Army, although even this formation had been weakened from the losses it had sustained in earlier fighting, particularly when it had engaged Allied forces in the Reichswald Forest in February. First Parachute Army had three corps stationed along the river; the II Parachute Corps to the north, LXXXVI Army Corps in the centre, and LXIII Army Corps in the south. Of these formations, the II Parachute Corps and LXXXVI Corps had a shared boundary that ran through the proposed landing zones for the Allied airborne divisions, meaning that the leading formation of each corps—these being the 7th Parachute and 84th Infantry Divisions—would face the airborne assault. After their retreat to the Rhine both divisions were under-strength and did not number more than 4,000 men each, with 84th Infantry Division supported by only 50 or so medium artillery pieces.

The seven divisions that formed the 1st Parachute Army were short of manpower and munitions, and although farms and villages were well prepared for defensive purposes, there were few mobile reserves, ensuring that the defenders had little way to concentrate their forces against the Allied bridgehead when the assault began. The mobile reserves that the Germans did possess consisted of some 150 armoured fighting vehicles under the command of 1st Parachute Army, the majority of which belonged to XLVII Panzer Corps. Allied intelligence believed that of the two divisions that formed XLVII Panzer Corps, the 116th Panzer Division had up to 70 tanks, and the 15th Panzergrenadier Division 15 tanks and between 20–30 assault guns. Intelligence also pointed to the possibility of a heavy anti-tank battalion being stationed in the area. Also, the Germans possessed a great number of antiaircraft weapons; on 17 March Allied intelligence estimated that the Germans had 103 heavy and 153 light anti-aircraft guns, a number which was drastically revised a week later to 114 heavy and 712 light anti-aircraft guns. The situation of the German defenders, and their ability to counter any assault effectively, was worsened when the Allies launched a large-scale air attack one week prior to Operation Varsity. The air attack involved more than 10,000 Allied sorties and concentrated primarily on Luftwaffe airfields and the German transportation system. The German defenders were also hampered by the fact that they had no reliable intelligence as to where the actual assault would be launched; although German forces along the Rhine had been alerted as to the general possibility of an Allied airborne attack, it was only when British engineers began to set up smoke generators opposite Emmerich and began laying a long smokescreen that the Germans knew where the assault would come.

==Battle==

Operation Plunder began at 9 pm on the evening of 23 March, and by the early hours of the morning of 24 March Allied ground units had secured a number of crossings on the eastern bank of the Rhine. In the first few hours of the day, the transport aircraft carrying the two airborne divisions that formed Operation Varsity began to take off from airbases in England and France and began to rendezvous over Brussels, before turning northeast for the Rhine dropping zones. The airlift consisted of 541 transport aircraft containing airborne troops, and a further 1,050 troop-carriers towing 1,350 gliders. The U.S. 17th Airborne Division consisted of 9,387 personnel, who were transported in 836 C-47 Skytrain transports, 72 C-46 Commando transports, and more than 900 Waco CG-4A gliders. The British 6th Airborne Division consisted of 7,220 personnel transported by 42 Douglas C-54 and 752 C-47 Dakota transport aircraft, as well as 420 Airspeed Horsa and General Aircraft Hamilcar gliders. This immense armada stretched more than in the sky and took 2 hours and 37 minutes to pass any given point, and was protected by some 2,153 Allied fighters from the U.S. Ninth Air Force and the Royal Air Force. The combination of the two divisions in one lift made this the largest single day airborne drop in history. At 10 am British and American airborne troops belonging to the 6th Airborne Division and 17th Airborne Division began landing on German soil, some 13 hours after the Allied ground assault began.

===6th Airborne Division===
The first element of the British 6th Airborne Division to land was the 8th Parachute Battalion, part of the 3rd Parachute Brigade under Brigadier James Hill. The brigade actually dropped nine minutes earlier than scheduled, but successfully landed in drop zone A, while facing significant small-arms and 20 mm anti-aircraft fire. The brigade suffered a number of casualties as it engaged the German forces in the Diersfordter Wald, but by 11:00 hours the drop zone was all but completely clear of enemy forces and all battalions of the brigade had formed up. 

The key place of Schnappenberg was captured by the 9th Parachute Battalion in conjunction with the 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion.

The 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion lost its Commanding Officer (CO), Lieutenant Colonel Jeff Nicklin, to German small-arms fire only moments after he landed. Despite taking casualties, the brigade cleared the area of German forces, and by 13:45 Brigadier Hill reported that the brigade had secured all of its objectives. Canadian medical orderly Corporal Frederick George Topham was awarded the Victoria Cross for his efforts to recover casualties and take them for treatment, despite his own wounds and great personal danger.

The next British airborne unit to land was the 5th Parachute Brigade, commanded by Brigadier Nigel Poett. The brigade was designated to land on drop zone B and achieved this, although not as accurately as 3rd Parachute Brigade due to poor visibility around the drop zone, which also made it more difficult for paratroopers of the brigade to rally. The drop zone came under heavy fire from German troops stationed nearby, and was subjected to shellfire and mortaring which inflicted casualties in the battalion rendezvous areas. However, the 7th Parachute Battalion soon cleared the DZ of German troops, many of whom were situated in farms and houses, and the 12th Parachute Battalion and 13th Parachute Battalion rapidly secured the rest of the brigade&#x27;s objectives. The brigade was then ordered to move due east and clear an area near Schermbeck, as well as to engage German forces gathered to the west of the farmhouse where the 6th Airborne Division Headquarters was established. By 15:30 Brigadier Poett reported that the brigade had secured all of its objectives and linked up with other British airborne units.

The third airborne unit that formed a part of the 6th Airborne Division was the 6th Airlanding Brigade, commanded by Brigadier Hugh Bellamy. The brigade was tasked with landing in company-sized groups and capturing several objectives, including the town of Hamminkeln. The gliders containing the airborne troops of the brigade landed in landing zones P, O, U and R under considerable antiaircraft fire, the landing being made even more difficult due to the presence of a great deal of haze and smoke. This resulted in a number of glider pilots being unable to identify their landing areas and losing their bearings; a number of gliders landed in the wrong areas or crashed. However, the majority of the gliders survived, allowing the battalions of the brigade to secure intact the three bridges over the River Issel that they had been tasked with capturing, as well as the village of Hamminkeln with the aid of American paratroopers of the 513th Parachute Infantry Regiment, which had been dropped by mistake nearby. The brigade secured all of its objectives shortly after capturing Hamminkeln.

===17th Airborne Division===
The 507th Parachute Infantry Regiment, under the command of Colonel Edson Raff, was the lead assault formation for the 17th Airborne Division, and was consequently the first American airborne unit to land as part of Operation Varsity. The entire regiment was meant to be dropped in drop zone W, a clearing north of Wesel; however, excessive ground haze confused the pilots of the transport aircraft carrying the regiment, and as such when the 507th dropped it split into two halves. Colonel Raff and approximately 690 of his paratroopers landed northwest of the drop zone near the town of Diersfordt, with the rest of the regiment successfully landing in drop zone W. The colonel rallied his separated paratroopers and led them to drop zone W, engaging a battery of German artillery en route, killing or capturing the artillery crews before reuniting with the rest of the regiment. By 2 pm, the 507th PIR had secured all of its objectives and cleared the area around Diersfordt, having engaged numerous German troops and also destroying a German tank. The actions of the 507th Parachute Infantry during the initial landing also gained the division its second Medal of Honor, when Private George Peters posthumously received the award after charging a German machine gun nest and eliminating it with rifle fire and grenades, allowing his fellow paratroopers to gather their equipment and capture the regiment&#x27;s first objective.
The 513th Parachute Infantry Regiment was the second American airborne unit to land after the 507th, under the command of Colonel James Coutts. En route to the drop zone, the transport aircraft carrying the 513th had the misfortune to pass through a belt of German antiaircraft weapons, losing 22 of the C-46 transport aircraft and damaging a further 38. Just as the 507th had, the 513th also suffered from pilot error due to the ground haze, and as such the regiment actually missed its designated drop zone, DZ X, and was dropped on one of the landing zones designated for the British 6th Airlanding Brigade. Despite this inaccuracy the paratroopers swiftly rallied and aided the British glider-borne troops who were landing simultaneously, eliminating several German artillery batteries that were covering the area. Once the German troops in the area had been eliminated, a combined force of American and British airborne troops stormed Hamminkeln and secured the town. By 2 pm, Colonel Coutts reported to Divisional Headquarters that the 513th Parachute Infantry had secured all of its objectives, having knocked out two tanks and two complete regiments of artillery during their assault. During its attempts to secure its objectives, the regiment also gained a third Medal of Honor for the 17th Airborne Division when Private First Class Stuart Stryker posthumously received the award after leading a charge against a German machine-gun nest, creating a distraction to allow the rest of his platoon to capture the fortified position in which the machine-gun was situated.

The third component of the 17th Airborne Division to take part in the operation was the 194th Glider Infantry Regiment (GIR), under the command of Colonel James Pierce. Troopers of the 194th GIR landed accurately in landing zone S, but their gliders and tow aircraft took heavy casualties; 12 C-47 transports were lost due to anti-aircraft fire, and a further 140 were damaged by the same fire. The regiment landed in the midst of a number of German artillery batteries that were engaging Allied ground forces crossing the Rhine, and as such many of the gliders were engaged by German artillery pieces that had their barrels lowered for direct-fire. However, these artillery batteries and their crews were defeated by the glider-borne troops, and the 194th Glider Infantry Regiment was soon able to report that its objectives had been secured, having destroyed 42 artillery pieces, 10 tanks, 2 self-propelled anti-aircraft vehicles and 5 self-propelled guns.

== OSS teams ==
The Office of Strategic Services sent four teams of two (codename &quot;Algonquin&quot;, teams Alsace, Poissy, S&amp;S and Student), with Operation Varsity to infiltrate and report from behind enemy lines, but none succeeded. Team S&amp;S had two agents in Wehrmacht uniforms and a captured Kϋbelwagen; to report by radio. But the Kϋbelwagen was put out of action while in the glider; three tires and the long-range radio were shot up (German gunners were told to attack the gliders not the tow planes).

==Aftermath==

Operation Varsity was a successful large-scale airborne operation. All of the objectives that the airborne troops had been tasked with had been captured and held, usually within only a few hours of the operation beginning. The bridges over the Issel had been successfully captured, although one later had to be destroyed to prevent its capture by counter-attacking German forces. The Diersfordter Forest had been cleared of enemy troops, and the roads through which the Germans might have routed reinforcements against the advance had been cut by airborne troops. Finally, Hamminkeln, the village that dominated the area and through which any advance would be made, had been secured by air-lifted units. By nightfall of 24 March, 15th (Scottish) Infantry Division had joined up with elements of 6th Airborne, and by midnight the first light bridge was across the Rhine. By 27 March, twelve bridges suitable for heavy armour had been installed over the Rhine and the Allies had 14 divisions on the east bank of the river, penetrating up to . According to &quot;Generalmajor&quot; Heinz Fiebig, commanding officer of one of the defending German formations, 84th Infantry Division, the German forces defending the area had been greatly surprised by the speed with which the two airborne divisions had landed their troops, explaining that their sudden appearance had had a &quot;shattering effect&quot; on the greatly outnumbered defenders. He revealed during his interrogation that his division had been badly depleted and could muster barely 4,000 soldiers.

The U.S. 17th Airborne Division gained its fourth Medal of Honor in the days following the operation, when Technical Sergeant Clinton M. Hedrick of the 194th Glider Infantry Regiment received the award posthumously after aiding in the capture of Lembeck Castle, which had been turned into a fortified position by the Germans.

===Casualties===
The casualties taken by both airborne formations were quite heavy, although lighter than had been expected. By nightfall of 24 March, the 6th Airborne Division had suffered around 1,400 personnel killed, wounded or missing in action out of the 7,220 personnel who were landed in the operation. The division also claimed to have secured around 1,500 prisoners of war. The 17th Airborne Division suffered a similar casualty rate, reporting around 1,300 casualties out of 9,650 personnel who took part in the operation, while the division claimed to have taken 2,000 POWs, a number similar to those taken by 6th Airborne. This made a total of around 3,500 POWs taken by both airborne formations during the operation. Between 24 and 29 March, the 17th Airborne had taken a total of 1,346 casualties. The air forces involved in the operation also suffered casualties; 56 aircraft in total were lost during the 24th, 21 out of the 144 transport aircraft transporting the 17th Airborne were shot down and 59 were damaged by antiaircraft fire, and 16 bombers from the Eighth Air Force were also shot down during supply drops.

===Battle honours===
In the British and Commonwealth system of battle honours, there was no distinct award for service in Operation Varsity. Instead, units that participated in the operation were included in the awards made between 1956 and 1959 to all units that participated in the Rhine crossing between 23 March and 1 April 1945: &quot;Rhine&quot;, or &quot;The Rhine&quot; to Canadian units, later translated to &quot;Le Rhin&quot; for French Canadian units.

==Post-war praise==
Contemporary observers and historians generally agree that Operation Varsity was successful. General Eisenhower called it &quot;the most successful airborne operation carried out to date&quot;, and an observer later wrote that the operation showed &quot;the highest state of development attained by troop-carrier and airborne units&quot;. In the official summary of the operation, Major General Ridgway wrote that the operation had been flawless, and that the two airborne divisions involved had destroyed enemy defences that might otherwise have taken days to reduce, ensuring the operation was successful.

Several modern historians have also praised the operation and the improvements that were made for Varsity. G. G. Norton argued that the operation benefited from the lessons learned from previous operations, and Brian Jewell agrees, arguing that the lessons of &quot;Market Garden&quot; had been learned as the airborne forces were concentrated and quickly dropped, giving the defenders little time to recover. Norton also argues that improvements were made for supporting the airborne troops; he notes that a large number of artillery pieces were available to cover the landings and that observers were dropped with the airborne forces, thus augmenting the firepower and flexibility of the airborne troops. He also highlights the development of a technique that allowed entire brigades to be landed in tactical groups, giving them greater flexibility. Dropping the airborne forces after the ground forces had breached the Rhine also ensured that the airborne troops would not have to fight for long before being relieved, a major improvement on the manner in which the previous large-scale airborne operation, &quot;Market Garden&quot;, had been conducted.

Historian Peter Allen states that while the airborne forces took heavy casualties, &quot;Varsity&quot; diverted German attention from the Rhine crossing onto themselves. Thus, the troops fighting to create a bridgehead, across the Rhine, suffered relatively few casualties, and were able to &quot;break out from the Rhine in hours rather than days&quot;.

==Post-war criticism==
Despite a great deal of official accolade and praise over the success of the operation, a number of criticisms have been made of the operation and the errors that were made. Several military historians have been critical of the need for the operation, with one historian, Barry Gregory, arguing that &quot;Operation Varsity was not entirely necessary...&quot;. Another historian, James A. Huston, argues that &quot;...had the same resources been employed on the ground, it is conceivable that the advance to the east might have been even more rapid than it was&quot;. In &quot;The Last Offensive,&quot; the US Army official history of the operation, Charles B. MacDonald (1990) asked &quot;whether under the prevailing circumstances an airborne attack (was) necessary or .. even justified.&quot;

===Aircraft shortages===

One specific failure in the massive operation was the critical lack of transport aircraft for the operation, an issue that had dogged every large-scale airborne operation the Allies had conducted. In the original planning for &quot;Varsity&quot;, an extra airborne division, the 13th, had been included; however, a lack of transport aircraft to drop this division led to it being excluded from the final plan. Thus, a third of the troops planned to be used were discarded, weakening the fighting power of the airborne formation. In the event, though, the airborne troops actually employed were sufficient to overwhelm the defenders.

There was also a shortage of gliders, although Brereton eventually got the 906 CG-4As he needed for Varsity and 926 for Operation Choker II, an American crossing of the Rhine at Worms planned for March. New gliders were shipped crated from America for assembly in Europe. Some were recovered from the Netherlands despite pilfering for fabric and instruments and a storm which destroyed over a hundred; after two months only 281 of the 2000 gliders there were retrieved. There was little recovery of gliders from Normandy.

Some historians have commented on this failure; Gerard Devlin argues that because of this lack of aircraft the remaining two divisions were forced to shoulder the operation by themselves.

===Aircraft and troop losses===
Losses of airborne troops were high. The cause of this high casualty rate can most likely be traced to the fact that the operation was launched in full daylight, rather than a night-assault. The airborne landings were conducted during the day primarily because the planners believed that a daytime operation had a better chance of success than at night, the troops being less scattered.

However, landing paratroopers, and especially gliders, without the cover of darkness left them exceedingly vulnerable to anti-aircraft fire. The official history of the British Airborne Divisions highlights the cost of this trade-off, stating that of the 416 gliders that landed, only 88 remained undamaged by enemy fire, and that between 20–30 percent of the glider pilots were casualties. Another historian argues that the gliders landing in daylight was a calamity, with the 194th Glider Infantry Regiment having two-thirds of their gliders hit by ground fire and suffering heavy casualties as they landed. The casualty rates were worsened by the slow rates of release and descent of the gliders themselves, and the fact that each aircraft towed two gliders, slowing them even further; as the time to release a glider unit was 3–4 times longer than a parachute unit, the gliders were vulnerable to flak.
A large number of paratroop drop aircraft were hit and lost as well. This was largely due to the hostile conditions encountered by the drop aircraft. Operation Varsity&#x27;s paratroop drop phase was flown in daylight at slow speeds at very low altitudes, using unarmed cargo aircraft, over heavy concentrations of German 20 mm, 37 mm, and larger calibre antiaircraft (AA) cannon utilizing explosive, incendiary, and armor-piercing incendiary ammunition. By that stage of the war, German AA crews had trained to a high state of readiness; many batteries had considerable combat experience in firing on and destroying high speed, well-armed fighter and fighter-bomber aircraft while under fire themselves. Finally, while many if not all of the C-47s used in Operation Varsity had been retrofitted with self-sealing fuel tanks, the much larger C-46 Commando aircraft employed in the drop received no such modification. This was exacerbated by the C-46&#x27;s unvented wings, which tended to pool leaked gasoline at the wing root where it could be ignited by flak or a stray spark. Although 19 of 72 C-46 aircraft were destroyed during Operation Varsity, losses of other aircraft types from AA fire during the same operation were also significant, including 13 gliders shot down, 14 crashed, and 126 damaged; 15 Consolidated B-24 bombers shot down, and 104 damaged; and 30 C-47s shot down and 339 damaged.

Lieutenant-Colonel Otway, who wrote an official history of the British airborne forces during World War II, stated that Operation Varsity highlighted the vulnerability of glider-borne units. While they arrived in complete sub-units and were able to move off more quickly than airborne troops dropped by parachute, the gliders were easy targets for anti-aircraft fire and short-range small-arms fire once landed; Otway concluded that in any future operations, troops dropped by parachute should secure landing zones prior to the arrival of glider-borne units. Thus, by having the landings conducted during daylight to ensure greater accuracy, the Allied planners incurred a far greater casualty rate, particularly amongst the glider-borne elements. The operation also suffered from poor piloting. Although the piloting was of a better quality than in the Sicilian and Normandy operations, there were still significant failures on the part of the pilots, especially when it is considered that the drop was conducted in daylight. A significant error occurred when the pilots of the transports carrying 513th Parachute Infantry Regiment dropped much of the regiment several miles from their designated drop zones, with the mis-dropped units actually landing in the British landing zones.

<text>Drive-Thru Records was a California-based independent record label owned by siblings Richard and Stefanie Reines. The label was partially responsible for popularizing the pop-punk/emo merger sound of the early to mid-2000s. After facing financial obstacles in getting their bands&#x27; music into stores, Drive-Thru entered into a distribution deal with MCA/Universal. In 2003 MCA was dissolved and folded into Geffen Records. One of the clauses of that agreement was MCA/Geffen being able to sign any band of their choosing from Drive-Thru&#x27;s roster.

Once the Universal deal ended, they signed a contract with independent label Sanctuary Records. Starting with a new roster, the label garnered a top 10 platinum hit with &quot;Here In Your Arms&quot; by Hellogoodbye. However, Sanctuary was on the verge of bankruptcy, and sold their assets to Universal Music. Drive-Thru Records got trapped in that deal, and were stuck with UMG, the catalog division of Universal. The label&#x27;s last release was in 2008, when Richard and Stefanie Reines decided to concentrate on artist management and put Drive-Thru Records on indefinite hiatus.

The independent label sold over 7 million CDs. Bands that achieved notable success during their time with the label include Hellogoodbye, New Found Glory, Something Corporate, Fenix*TX, Finch, The Starting Line, Steel Train, Midtown, Rx Bandits, The Early November, Senses Fail, Home Grown, Halifax and Allister.

==Love Minus Zero Recordings==

Love Minus Zero Recordings was founded as the second subsidiary of Drive-Thru Records in January 2007. This label was intended to comprise artists of a stronger singer-songwriter genre. Only two acts were ever signed to Love Minus Zero: Roark and Biirdie. This imprint was soon reabsorbed back into Drive-Thru Records.

== Commercial Success ==
Drive-Thru Records have earned several silver, gold, and platinum albums and singles, that have been certified by RIAA, CRIA and BPI.

<text>A colander (or cullender) is a kitchen utensil perforated with holes used to strain foods such as pasta or to rinse vegetables. The perforations of the colander allow liquid to drain through while retaining the solids inside. It is sometimes called a pasta strainer. A sieve, with much finer mesh, is also used for straining.

==Description and history==
Traditionally, colanders are made of a light metal, such as aluminium or thinly rolled stainless steel. Colanders are also made of plastic, silicone, ceramic, and enamelware.

The word &quot;colander&quot; comes from the Latin , meaning sieve.

==Types==
* Bowl- or cone-shaped – the usual colander
* Mated colander pot – a colander inside a cooking pot, allowing the food to drain as it is lifted out

==Other uses==
The colander in the form of a pasta strainer was adopted as the religious headgear of the satirical religion Pastafarianism, which worships the Flying Spaghetti Monster.

Colanders may be used during solar eclipses to project multiple small low-resolution images of a partial eclipse onto a flat surface for safe viewing.

<doc id="764785" wikidata="Q1145741" url="?curid=764785" title="Black Mesa Research Facility">
<text>The Black Mesa Research Facility (also simply called Black Mesa) is a fictional underground laboratory complex that serves as the primary setting for the video game &quot;Half-Life&quot; and its expansions, as well as its unofficial remake, &quot;Black Mesa&quot;. It also features in the wider &quot;Half-Life&quot; universe, including the &quot;Portal&quot; series. Located in the New Mexico desert in a decommissioned Cold War missile site, it is the former employer of &quot;Half-Life&quot;&#x27;s theoretical physicist protagonist, Gordon Freeman, and a competitor of Aperture Science. While the facility ostensibly conducts military-industrial research, its secret experiments into teleportation have caused it to make contact with the alien world of Xen, and its scientists covertly study its life-forms and materials. In a catastrophic event known as the &quot;Black Mesa Incident&quot;, an &quot;anti-mass spectrometer&quot; experiment conducted on Xen matter causes a Resonance Cascade disaster that allows aliens to invade Earth, and is the catalyst for the events of the series.

&quot;Half-Life&quot; was critically acclaimed for its storytelling and level design. At the time, the integration of narrative in the form of interactive cutscenes and NPCs was considered groundbreaking for a first-person shooter.

== Level content ==

=== &quot;Half-Life&quot; ===

In &quot;Black Mesa Inbound&quot;, the player controls Gordon Freeman as he enters the facility on a monorail. After noticing the G-Man on a different train, Gordon departs and enters the Anomalous Materials Lab. He explores the area, donning his Hazardous Environment Suit, and then enters the test chamber. After the Anti-Mass Spectrometer power is turned up to 105%, the Resonance Cascade disaster occurs, and Freeman must escape the destroyed chamber. In &quot;Unforeseen Consequences&quot;, Freeman returns to the Anomalous Materials Lab, fighting his way through the aliens that have started appearing from warps in space. He then makes his way through an office complex.

In &quot;We&#x27;ve Got Hostiles&quot;, Freeman encounters the Hazardous Environment Combat Unit (HECU), a special forces unit of the United States Marine Corps sent to cover up the disaster by killing all of the surviving Black Mesa personnel. He travels through a series of Cold War-era storage rooms to reach the surface. Escaping an Osprey helicopter, he goes back underground in a different location. In &quot;Blast Pit&quot;, he must destroy an alien tentacle that has appeared from beneath a nuclear silo. After successfully destroying the tentacle with a rocket engine, in &quot;Power Up&quot;, Freeman must kill a Gargantua alien by baiting it into a room with giant Tesla coils. He then navigates a series of underground rail tunnels in &quot;On a Rail&quot;, culminating in the rocket launch of a satellite that can determine the scope of the disaster.

In &quot;Apprehension&quot;, Freeman fights through flooded rooms filled with aquatic aliens called Icthyosaurs. However, he is caught by the HECU Marines and dumped in a trash compactor. He escapes, and infiltrates a waste processing facility. In &quot;Questionable Ethics&quot;, Freeman stumbles upon a secret part of Black Mesa that studies aliens. In &quot;Surface Tension&quot;, Freeman crosses a hydroelectric dam, evading a Boeing AH-64 Apache. In &quot;Forget About Freeman!&quot;, Freeman makes his way past a battle between aliens and the military to reach the Lambda Complex. In &quot;Lambda Core&quot;, Gordon floods the facility&#x27;s nuclear reactor with coolant, fighting off aliens along the way. Navigating through a maze of teleporters in a teleportation lab, he is finally allowed by scientists into a giant teleportation chamber that sends him to Xen, ending the Black Mesa portion of the game.

==== &quot;Opposing Force&quot; ====
It is revealed in &quot;Friendly Fire&quot; that government black operators have been sent into the facility to not only kill any Black Mesa personnel and HECU Marines remaining, but also to detonate a thermonuclear weapon inside the facility, thereby destroying the entire base and everyone in it. Corporal Shephard (whom the player controls), then defuses the weapon after a firefight with a few black operators. The warhead is later reactivated by the G-Man, and it detonates at the end of the game, destroying a significant portion of the facility and any survivors still trapped inside.

== Development ==
Series writer Marc Laidlaw initially conceived of Black Mesa, and brainstormed numerous potential names before arriving on the final one, including &quot;Black Butte Missile Base&quot;, &quot;Diablo Plains&quot;, and &quot;Diablo Mesa&quot;. In &quot;Half-Life 2: Raising the Bar&quot;, he professed that he was glad his final choice was Black Mesa Research Facility, rather than &quot;Black Butte&quot;. Black Mesa&#x27;s themes of science and horror were partially inspired by &quot;The Borderland&quot;, an episode of &quot;The Outer Limits&quot; that focused on a team of scientists who manipulated magnetic fields to enter the fourth dimension.

The monorail sequence that introduces the player to the Black Mesa facility was initially intended as a tech demo. Laidlaw stated that when a programmer implemented a new type of game object called &quot;func_tracktrain&quot;, which allowed trains to branch onto different tracks, as well as bank and pivot into turns, he decided to incorporate a train into the game&#x27;s story. The path of the monorail itself is made up of six different map files without individual loading screens, adding hallways as transition areas to give the illusion of level streaming.

The disaster sequence in the test chamber was created in a single weekend by developers John Guthrie and Kelly Bailey, who worked for 48 hours straight without sleep, ultimately exciting everyone in the office when they discovered and played it the following Monday.

== Reception ==
The starting monorail sequence became well known for allowing the player to walk freely around the train and look at whatever they chose, rather than be locked in place. Other scripted events that were notable for allowing the player to retain full control include the Resonance Cascade disaster.

The design of Black Mesa was characterized by critics as &quot;mundane&quot;, and representing &quot;workaday normality&quot;, however, its designers also gave its corporate environments &quot;terrifying potential&quot; by making it possible for aliens to spawn even in apparently empty areas. This allows for numerous potential places of ambush. Its visual design was called dystopian, featuring large amounts of solid-state hardware, much of which is malfunctioning or in disrepair even prior to the alien invasion. Scenes in Black Mesa have been described as &quot;industrial disarray&quot; and &quot;bureaucracy run amok&quot;, while the facility itself was called &quot;an amalgam of every top-secret military-scientific installation ever created or imagined&quot;.

The Resonance Cascade in Black Mesa was noted as being a metaphor for how the laboratory destabilizes the difference between &quot;inside&quot; and &quot;outside&quot;. Its teleportation experiments caused Black Mesa&#x27;s features to be reproduced upon &quot;the planet at large&quot;.

== Legacy ==
Black Mesa&#x27;s design has been credited as inspiring future cinematic shooters, including the &quot;Battlefield&quot; and &quot;Call of Duty&quot; franchises, being called a &quot;revolutionary step&quot; for the genre.

<doc id="764790" wikidata="Q3001112" url="?curid=764790" title="Supreme Court of Ohio">
<text>The Supreme Court of the State of Ohio is the highest court in the U.S. state of Ohio, with final authority over interpretations of Ohio law and the Ohio Constitution. The court has seven members, a chief justice and six associate justices, who are elected at large by the voters of Ohio for six-year terms. The court has a total of 1,550 other employees. Since 2004, the court has met in the Thomas J. Moyer Ohio Judicial Center (formerly known as the Ohio Departments Building) on the east bank of the Scioto River in Downtown Columbus. Prior to 2004, the court met in the James A. Rhodes State Office Tower and earlier in the Judiciary Annex (now the Senate Building) of the Ohio Statehouse.

The Ohio Supreme Court and the rest of the judiciary is established and authorized within Article IV of the Ohio Constitution.

== History ==
The Supreme Court of Ohio was founded in 1802, established in the state constitution as a three-member court, holding courts in each county every year. The constitution was approved that year, one year before statehood. In 1823, the state legislature ordered the court to meet annually in Columbus. It was located in the Ohio Statehouse beginning in 1857, and moved into the Statehouse Annex in 1901. The first female justice on the court was Florence E. Allen who served from 1923 to 1934. In 1974, the court moved from the annex building to the Rhodes State Office Tower. It moved to the Ohio Judicial Center in 2004.

=== Important cases ===
In Berkheimer v. REKM (25 July 2024), the Supreme Court of Ohio ruled that “ A diner reading “boneless wings” on a menu would no more believe that the restaurant was warranting the absence of bones in the items than believe that the items were made from chicken wings, just as a person eating “chicken  fingers” would  know that he had not been served fingers.”

In dissent three Democratic jurists called this “utter jabberwocky”. Further positing that “read the word “boneless,” they think that it means “without bones,” as do all sensible people.”

In &quot;DeRolph v. State&quot; (1997) the Supreme Court of Ohio found that Ohio&#x27;s method of funding its schools was unconstitutional. The case originated in the Perry County Schools.

In &quot;Mapp v. Ohio&quot; (1961), the U.S. Supreme Court reversed the Supreme Court of Ohio, and found that evidence seized unlawfully without a search warrant cannot be used in criminal prosecutions.

== Justices ==
All the seats on the court are elected at large by the voters of Ohio. Every two years, two of the associate justice seats are up for election to a six-year term. For one of those three elections in a six-year cycle, the chief justice&#x27;s seat is also up for election. In order to run for a seat on the court, a person must be admitted to the bar in Ohio, and have practiced as a lawyer or served as a judge for at least six years. There is an age limit: One may not run for a seat on any Ohio court if one is more than 70 years of age. This limit often forces the retirement of long-time justices. Justice Francis E. Sweeney, Sr., was barred by this rule from running for re-election in 2004, as was Justice Terrence O&#x27;Donnell in 2018 and as Chief Justice Maureen O&#x27;Connor was in 2022. However, a judge who reaches the age of 70 after being elected is not prevented from completing her or his term in office.

The governor of Ohio may appoint a justice to the Court when there is a vacancy.

Until June 2021, judicial elections were non-partisan. This meant that parties nominated candidates in primary elections, but party designations for the candidates were not permitted on the general election ballot. Candidates and judges are also restricted in making public political statements. In response to the 2020 election of Democrat Jennifer Brunner, Ohio Republicans passed a law making general elections partisan, one of seven states to elect justices with party labels on the ballot. The Ohio Judicial Conference and Ohio Courts of Appeals Judges opposed the change, saying the judiciary should be independent of parties.

From the seating of Robert R. Cupp in 2007 to replace Democrat Alice Robie Resnick until the 2010 appointment of Eric Brown as chief justice, the court consisted entirely of Republicans who had been nominated through the primary process and won the general election, or who were appointed to an open seat by a Republican governor. This occurred once again in 2018 when Republican Mary DeGenaro was appointed to fill the seat vacated by the lone Democrat on the court, Bill O&#x27;Neill. Democrats once again joined the court in 2019 with the election of Michael Donnelly and Melody Stewart in November 2018. In the court&#x27;s history, there have been four instances where the female justices have outnumbered the male justices. The first occurred from January to May 2003, the second time occurred in 2005 and 2006, the third time occurred between January 2011 and January 2017, and the fourth time occurred between January 2018 and December 2022.

===Compensation===
As of 2018, the chief justice receives $174,700 per year and associate justices $164,000 per year.

==Disciplinary Counsel==
The Ohio Supreme Court disciplinary counsel investigates Ohio judges and attorneys in order to protect the public. The Ohio Supreme Court announced through its website the dismissal of the former disciplinary counsel on August 29, 2013. Currently, Joseph Caligiuri is the disciplinary counsel and his office investigates grievances.

<text>Albert George Wilson (July 28, 1918 – August 27, 2012) was an American astronomer and a discoverer of minor planets.

He was born in Houston, Texas. He received his Ph.D. in mathematics from Caltech in 1947; his thesis title was &quot;Axially Symmetric Thermal Stresses in a Semi-Infinite Solid&quot; advised by Harry Bateman.

In 1949, he accepted a job at Palomar Observatory, and led the Palomar Sky Survey. In 1953, he became assistant director of Lowell Observatory, and served as director from 1954 to 1957. He later worked at Rand Corporation and other private sector positions. In 1962, he became founding editor of the astronomical magazine &quot;Icarus&quot;. In 1966, he accepted the position of associate director of McDonnell-Douglas Corporation Advanced Research Laboratories (DARL), which he held from 1966 until 1972. Wilson then became an adjunct professor at USC, teaching courses in philosophy and science until his retirement. After retiring Wilson was associated with the &quot;Institute on Man and Science&quot; and the &quot;Institute of the Future&quot;, lecturing and consulting for both groups.

He discovered a number of asteroids, and also co-discovered the periodic comet 107P/Wilson–Harrington with Robert George Harrington. The object is also known as the minor planet 4015 Wilson–Harrington.

<text>The Waco siege, also known as the Waco massacre, was the siege by US federal government and Texas state law enforcement officials of a compound belonging to the religious cult known as the Branch Davidians, between February 28 and April 19, 1993. The Branch Davidians, led by David Koresh, were headquartered at Mount Carmel Center ranch in unincorporated McLennan County, Texas, 13 miles (21 kilometers) northeast of Waco. Suspecting the group of stockpiling illegal weapons, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) obtained a search warrant for the compound and arrest warrants for Koresh and several of the group&#x27;s members.

The ATF had planned a sudden daylight raid of the ranch in order to serve these warrants. Any advantage of surprise was lost when a local reporter who had been tipped off about the raid asked for directions from a US Postal Service mail carrier who was coincidentally Koresh&#x27;s brother-in-law. Thus, the group&#x27;s members were fully armed and prepared; upon the ATF initiating the raid, an intense gunfight erupted, resulting in the deaths of four ATF agents and six Branch Davidians. Following the ATF entering the property and its failure to execute the search warrant, a siege was initiated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), during which negotiations between the parties attempted to reach a compromise.

After 51 days, on April 19, 1993, the FBI launched a CS gas (tear gas) attack in an attempt to force the Branch Davidians out of the compound&#x27;s buildings. Shortly thereafter, the Mount Carmel Center became engulfed in flames. The fire and the reaction to the final attack within the group resulted in the deaths of 76 Branch Davidians, including 20–28 children and Koresh.

The events of the siege and attack, particularly the origin of the fire, are disputed by various sources. Department of Justice reports from October 1993 and July 2000 conclude that although incendiary CS gas canisters were used by the FBI, the Branch Davidians had started the fire, citing evidence from audio surveillance recordings of very specific discussions between Koresh and others about pouring more fuel on piles of hay as the fires started, and from aerial footage showing at least three simultaneous ignition points at different locations in the building complex. The FBI contends that none of their agents fired any live rounds on the day of the fire. Critics contend that live rounds were indeed fired by law enforcement, and suggest that a combination of gunshots and flammable CS gas was the true cause of the fire.

The Ruby Ridge standoff and the Waco siege were cited by Timothy McVeigh as the main reasons for his and Terry Nichols&#x27;s plan to execute the Oklahoma City bombing exactly two years later, on April 19, 1995, as well as the modern-day American militia movement.

== Background ==

The Branch Davidians (also known as &quot;The Branch&quot;) were a religious group that originated in 1955 from a schism in the Shepherd&#x27;s Rod (Davidians) following the death of the Shepherd&#x27;s Rod founder Victor Houteff. Houteff founded the Davidians based on his prophecy of an imminent apocalypse involving the Second Coming of Jesus Christ and the defeat of the evil armies of Babylon. As the original Davidian group gained members, its leadership moved the church to a hilltop several miles east of Waco, Texas, which they named &quot;Mount Carmel&quot;, after a mountain in Israel mentioned in Joshua 19:26 in the Bible&#x27;s Old Testament.

A few years later, they relocated again to a much larger site east of the city. In 1959, Victor&#x27;s widow, Florence Houteff, announced that the expected Armageddon was about to take place, and members were told to gather at the center to await this event. Many of them built houses, others stayed in tents, trucks, or buses, and most of them sold their possessions.

After the failure of this prophecy, control of the site (Mount Carmel Center) fell to Benjamin Roden, founder of the Branch Davidian Seventh-day Adventist Association (Branch Davidians). He promoted different doctrinal beliefs than those of Victor Houteff&#x27;s original Davidian Seventh-day Adventist organization. On Roden&#x27;s death, control of the Branch Davidians fell to his wife, Lois Roden. Lois considered their son, George Roden, unfit to assume the position of prophet. Instead, she groomed Vernon Wayne Howell (later known as David Koresh) to be her successor.

In 1984, a meeting resulted in a division of the group, with Howell leading one faction (calling themselves the Branch Davidians) and George Roden leading the competing faction. After this split, George Roden ran Howell and his followers off Mount Carmel at gunpoint. Howell and his group relocated to Palestine, Texas.

After the death of Lois Roden in November 1986 and probate of her estate in January 1987, Howell attempted to gain control of Mount Carmel Center by force. George Roden had dug up the casket of Anna Hughes from the Davidian cemetery and had challenged Howell to a resurrection contest to prove who was the rightful heir to the leadership. Howell instead went to the police and claimed Roden was guilty of corpse abuse, but the county prosecutors refused to file charges without proof.

On November 3, 1987, Howell and seven armed companions tried to get into the Mount Carmel chapel, intending to photograph the body in the casket as incriminating evidence. Roden was informed of the interlopers and opened fire. The Sheriff&#x27;s Department responded about 20 minutes into the gunfight, during which Roden had been wounded. Sheriff Harwell got Howell on the phone and told him to stop shooting and surrender. Howell and his companions, dubbed the &quot;Rodenville Eight&quot; by the media, were tried for attempted murder on April 12, 1988. Seven were acquitted, and the jury hung on Howell&#x27;s verdict. The county prosecutors did not press the case further.

Even with all the effort to bring the casket to court, the standing judge refused to use it as evidence for the case. Judge Herman Fitts ruled that the courtroom is no place for a casket when defense attorney Gary Coker requested it be used as evidence for the case. Eight men, including six of the defendants, were forced to carry the casket away from the courthouse and down the street to a van awaiting the body. In response to questions about the body, Roden admitted to attempting to resurrect Hughes on three occasions.

While waiting for the trial, Roden was put in jail under contempt of court charges because of his use of foul language in some court pleadings. He threatened the Texas court with sexually transmitted diseases if the court ruled in Howell&#x27;s favor. Alongside these charges, Roden was jailed for six months for legal motions he filed with explicit language. Roden faced 90 days in jail for living on the property after being ordered to neither live on the property nor call himself the leader of the religious group in a 1979 case. Soon after the trial, several of Howell&#x27;s followers moved from their headquarters in Palestine, Texas, back to Mount Carmel. In mid-1989, Roden used an axe to kill a Davidian named Wayman Dale Adair, who visited him to discuss Adair&#x27;s alleged vision of being God&#x27;s chosen messiah. He was found guilty under an insanity defense and was committed to a mental hospital. Shortly after Roden&#x27;s commitment, Howell raised money to pay off all the back taxes on Mount Carmel owed by Roden and took legal control of the property. After these legal proceedings, it was noted in a 90-minute interview by the Davidians&#x27; attorney Douglas Wayne Martin that the religious group had been back and forth to court since 1955.

On August 5, 1989, Howell released the &quot;New Light&quot; audiotape, in which he said that God told him to procreate with the women in the group to establish a &quot;House of David&quot; of his &quot;special people.&quot; This involved separating married couples in the group, who had to agree that only he could have sexual relations with the wives, while the men should observe celibacy. Howell also said that God had told him to start building an &quot;Army for God&quot; to prepare for the end of days and a salvation for his followers.

Howell filed a petition in the California State Superior Court in Pomona on May 15, 1990, to legally change his name &quot;for publicity and business purposes&quot; to Koresh. On August 28, he was granted the petition. By 1992, most of the land belonging to the group had been sold except for a core . Most of the buildings had been removed or were being salvaged for construction materials to convert much of the main chapel and a tall water tank into apartments for the resident members of the group. Many of the members of the group had been involved with the Davidians for a few generations, and many had large families.

== Prelude ==
On February 27, 1993, the &quot;Waco Tribune-Herald&quot; began publishing &quot;The Sinful Messiah&quot;, a series of articles by Mark England and Darlene McCormick, who reported allegations that Koresh had physically abused children in the compound and had committed statutory rape by taking multiple underage brides. Koresh was also said to advocate polygamy for himself and declared that he was married to several female residents of the small community. The paper claimed that Koresh had announced he was entitled to at least 140 wives and that he was entitled to claim any of the women in the group as his, that he had fathered at least a dozen children, and that some of these mothers became brides as young as 12 or 13 years old.

In addition to allegations of sexual abuse and misconduct, Koresh and his followers were suspected of stockpiling illegal weapons. In May 1992, Chief Deputy Daniel Weyenberg of the McLennan County Sheriff&#x27;s Department called the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) to notify them that his office had been contacted by a local UPS representative concerned about a report by a local driver. The UPS driver said a package had broken open on delivery to the Branch Davidian residence, revealing at least half a dozen grenades. He also noted that the compound had been receiving packages from an arms dealer for months.

On June 9, the ATF opened a formal investigation and a week later it was classified as sensitive, &quot;thereby calling for a high degree of oversight&quot; from both Houston and headquarters. The documentary &quot;Inside Waco&quot; claims that the investigation started when in 1992 the ATF became concerned over reports of automatic gunfire coming from the Carmel compound. On July 30, ATF agents David Aguilera and Skinner visited the Branch Davidians&#x27; gun dealer Henry McMahon, who tried to get them to talk with Koresh on the phone. Koresh offered to let ATF inspect the Branch Davidians&#x27; weapons and paperwork and asked to speak with Aguilera, but Aguilera declined.

Sheriff Harwell told reporters regarding law enforcement talking with Koresh, &quot;Just go out and talk to them, what&#x27;s wrong with notifying them?&quot; The ATF began surveillance from a house across the road from the compound several months before the siege. Their cover was poor (the &quot;college students&quot; were in their thirties, had new cars, were not registered at the local schools, and did not keep a schedule that would have fit any legitimate employment or classes). The investigation included sending in an undercover agent, Robert Rodriguez, whose identity Koresh learned, though he only revealed that fact on the day of the raid.

== Aguilera&#x27;s affidavit ==
The ATF used an affidavit filed by Special Agent David Aguilera to obtain the search and arrest warrant that led to the Waco siege. The official filing date of this affidavit was February 25, 1993. Allegedly, the initial investigation began in June 1992 when a postal worker informed a sheriff of McLennan County that he believed he had been delivering explosives to the ammo and gun store owned and operated by the Branch Davidians. This store, named the &quot;Mag-Bag&quot;, had been identified by the postal worker as suspicious in deliveries. The worker continued deliveries to the Mt. Carmel Center and reported seeing occupied observation posts; in the affidavit, it states he believed there were armed personnel at these observation posts.

The McLennan county sheriff was notified in May and June of that year of two cases of inert grenades, black gunpowder, 90 pounds of powdered aluminum, and 30–40 cardboard tubes. Aguilera also noted that the Mag-Bag had purchased several AR-15/M-16 parts kits. Some of the sellers of these kits were currently under investigation by the ATF, and the ATF had seized illegal weapons from their previous customers. Aguilera stated, &quot;I have been involved in many cases where defendants, following a relatively simple process, convert AR-15 semi-automatic rifles to fully automatic rifles of the nature of the M-16&quot; to justify the ATF&#x27;s involvement in the case.

In November 1992, a local farmer (Ben Hays) and his wife (Cameron Krejeci) reported to the sheriff that he had heard machine-gun fire. &quot;By the sound of it,&quot; he said, &quot;it was likely a .50 caliber machine gun and multiple M-16s.&quot; This farmer claimed he was very familiar with machine guns, having done a tour overseas in the US Army. The affidavit closed with Aguilera verifying the story via interviews made with associated parties and gun shops from which the Mag-Bag purchased items. Among these items were over forty-five AR-15 upper receivers and five M-16 upper receivers, which Aguilera annotated, &quot;These kits contain all the parts of an M-16 except for the lower receiver unit, which is the &#x27;firearm&#x27; by lawful definition,&quot; admitting that neither the noise complaints nor the items ordered were necessarily illegal.

== ATF raid ==
=== Preparations ===
Using the affidavit filed by Aguilera that alleged that the Davidians had violated federal law, the ATF obtained search and arrest warrants for Koresh and specific followers on weapons charges, citing the many firearms they had accumulated. The search warrant commanded a search &quot;on or before February 28, 1993&quot;, in the daytime between 6:00 am and 10:00 pm. The ATF made a claim that Koresh was possibly operating a methamphetamine lab, allowing him to obtain military assets under the war on drugs. Although the ATF&#x27;s investigation &quot;focused on firearm violations, not on illegal drugs&quot;, the ATF requested assistance from the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the United States Department of Defense (DOD) &quot;citing a drug connection&quot; based on 1) a recent delivery to the compound of &quot;chemicals, instruments, and glassware&quot;, 2) a written testimony from a former compound resident, alleging &quot;Howell had told him that drug trafficking was a desirable way to raise money&quot;, 3) several current residents who &quot;had prior drug involvement&quot;, 4) two former residents who were incarcerated for drug-trafficking crimes, and 5) National Guard overflights&#x27; thermal images showing a &quot;hot spot inside the compound, possibly indicating a methamphetamine laboratory&quot;. The original request for assistance was initially approved, but the commander of the Special Forces detachment questioned it, and the ATF obtained only a training site at Fort Hood, Texas, from February 25 to February 27 with safety inspections for the training lanes, and was given only medical and communications training and equipment.

The ATF had planned their raid for Monday, March 1, 1993, with the code name &quot;Showtime&quot;. The ATF later claimed that the raid was moved up a day, to February 28, 1993, in response to the &quot;Waco Tribune-Herald&quot;″s &quot;The Sinful Messiah&quot; series of articles (which the ATF had tried to prevent from being published). Beginning February 1, ATF agents had three meetings with &quot;Tribune-Herald&quot; staff regarding a delay in publication of &quot;The Sinful Messiah&quot;. The paper was first told by the ATF that the raid would take place February 22, which they changed to March 1, and then ultimately to an indefinite date. ATF agents felt the newspaper had held off publication at the request of the ATF for at least three weeks. In a February 24 meeting between &quot;Tribune-Herald&quot; staff and ATF agent Phillip Chojancki and two other agents, the ATF could not give the newspaper staff a clear idea of what action was planned or when. The &quot;Tribune-Herald&quot; informed ATF they were publishing the series, which included an editorial calling for local authorities to act. Personnel of the &quot;Tribune-Herald&quot; found out about the imminent raid after the first installment of &quot;The Sinful Messiah&quot; had already appeared on February 27.

The ATF preferred to arrest Koresh when he was outside Mount Carmel, but planners received inaccurate information that Koresh rarely left it. The Branch Davidian members were well known locally and had cordial relations with other locals. The Branch Davidians partly supported themselves by trading at gun shows and took care to have the relevant paperwork to ensure their transactions were legal. Branch Davidian Paul Fatta was a federal firearms licensed dealer, and the group operated a retail gun business called the Mag-Bag. When shipments for the Mag-Bag arrived, they were signed for by Fatta, Steve Schneider, or Koresh. The morning of the raid, Paul Fatta and his son Kalani were on their way to an Austin gun show to conduct business.

=== February 28 ===
The ATF attempted to execute their search warrant on Sunday morning, February 28, 1993. The local sheriff, in audiotapes broadcast after the incident, said he was not told about the raid. Despite being informed that the Branch Davidians knew a raid was coming, the ATF commander ordered that it go ahead, even though their plan depended on reaching the compound without the Branch Davidians being armed and prepared.

Any advantage of surprise was lost when a KWTX-TV reporter who had been tipped off about the raid asked for directions from a US Postal Service mail carrier who was coincidentally Koresh&#x27;s brother-in-law. Koresh then told undercover ATF agent Robert Rodriguez that they knew a raid was imminent. Rodriguez had infiltrated the Branch Davidians and was astonished to find that his cover had been blown. The agent made an excuse and left the compound. When asked later what the Branch Davidians had been doing when he left the compound, Rodriguez replied, &quot;They were praying.&quot; Branch Davidian survivors have written that Koresh ordered selected male followers to begin arming and taking up defensive positions, while the women and children were told to take cover in their rooms. Koresh told them he would try to speak to the agents, and what happened next would depend on the agents&#x27; intentions. The ATF arrived at 9:45 am in a convoy of civilian vehicles containing uniformed personnel in SWAT-style tactical gear.

ATF agents claimed that they heard shots coming from within the compound; Branch Davidian survivors claimed that the first shots came from the ATF agents outside. A suggested reason may have been an accidental discharge of a weapon, possibly by an ATF agent, causing the ATF to respond with fire from automatic weapons. Other reports claim the first shots were fired by the ATF &quot;dog team&quot; sent to kill the dogs in the Branch Davidian kennel. Three helicopters of the Army National Guard were used as an aerial distraction, and all took incoming fire. During the first shots, Koresh was wounded, shot in the hand and the stomach. Within a minute of the raid&#x27;s start, Branch Davidian Wayne Martin called emergency services, pleading for them to stop shooting. Martin asked for a ceasefire, and audiotapes record him saying, &quot;Here they come again!&quot; and, &quot;That&#x27;s them shooting! That&#x27;s not us!&quot;
The first ATF casualty was an agent who had made it to the west side of the building before he was wounded. Agents quickly took cover and fired at the buildings while the helicopters began their diversion and swept in low over the complex, 350 feet (105 m) away from the building. The Branch Davidians fired on the helicopters and hit them. None of the crewmembers were injured, but the helicopter pilots pulled away from the compound and landed. On the east side of the compound, agents put two ladders against the side of the building. They then climbed onto the roof to secure it and reach Koresh&#x27;s room and the location where they believed weapons were stored. On the west slope of the roof, three agents reached Koresh&#x27;s window and were crouching beside it when they came under fire. One agent was killed and another wounded. The third agent clambered over the peak of the roof and joined other agents attempting to enter the armory. The window was smashed, a flashbang stun grenade was thrown in, and three agents entered the armory. When another tried to follow them, a hail of bullets penetrated the wall and wounded him, but he was able to reach a ladder and slide to safety. An agent fired his shotgun at Branch Davidians until he was hit in the head by return fire and killed. Inside the armory, the agents killed a Branch Davidian and discovered a cache of weapons, but subsequently came under heavy fire; two were wounded. As they escaped, the third agent laid down covering fire, killing a Branch Davidian. As he made his escape, he hit his head on a wooden support beam and fell off the roof but survived. An agent outside provided them with covering fire but was shot by a Branch Davidian and killed instantly. Dozens of ATF agents took cover, many behind Branch Davidian vehicles, and exchanged fire with the Branch Davidians. The number of ATF wounded increased, and an agent was killed by gunfire from the compound as agents were firing at a Branch Davidian perched on top of the water tower. The exchange of fire continued, but 45 minutes into the raid the gunfire began to slow down as agents began to run low on ammunition. The shooting continued for a total of two hours.

Lieutenant Lynch of the McLennan County Sheriff Department contacted the ATF and negotiated a ceasefire. Sheriff Harwell states in William Gazecki&#x27;s documentary &quot;&quot; that the ATF agents withdrew only after they were out of ammunition. ATF agent Chuck Hustmyre later wrote: &quot;About 45 minutes into the shootout, the volume of gunfire finally started to slacken. We were running out of ammunition. The Davidians, however, had plenty.&quot; In all, four ATF agents (Steve Willis, Robert Williams, Todd McKeehan, and Conway Charles LeBleu) had been killed during the firefight. Another 16 had been injured. After the ceasefire, the Branch Davidians allowed the ATF dead and wounded to be evacuated and held their fire during the ATF retreat.

The five Branch Davidians killed in the raid were Winston Blake, Peter Gent, Peter Hipsman, Perry Jones, and Jaydean Wendell; two were killed by the Branch Davidians after having been wounded. Their bodies were buried on the grounds. Nearly six hours after the 11:30 am ceasefire, Michael Schroeder was shot dead by ATF agents who alleged he fired a pistol at agents as he attempted to re-enter the compound with Woodrow Kendrick and Norman Allison.

Alan A. Stone&#x27;s report states that the Branch Davidians did not ambush the ATF and that they &quot;apparently did not maximize the kill of ATF agents&quot;, explaining that they were rather &quot;desperate religious fanatics expecting an apocalyptic ending, in which they were destined to die defending their sacred ground and destined to achieve salvation.&quot; A 1999 federal report noted:

The violent tendencies of dangerous cults can be classified into two general categories—defensive violence and offensive violence. Defensive violence is utilized by cults to defend a compound or enclave that was created specifically to eliminate most contact with the dominant culture. The 1993 clash in Waco, Texas at the Branch Davidian complex is an illustration of such defensive violence. History has shown that groups that seek to withdraw from the dominant culture seldom act on their beliefs that the endtime has come unless provoked.

== FBI siege ==
ATF agents established contact with Koresh and others inside the compound after they withdrew. The FBI took command soon after as a result of the deaths of federal agents, placing Jeff Jamar, head of the Bureau&#x27;s San Antonio field office, in charge of the siege as Site Commander. The FBI Hostage Rescue Team (HRT) was headed by HRT Commander Richard Rogers, who had previously been criticized for his actions during the Ruby Ridge incident. As at Ruby Ridge, Rogers often overrode the Site Commander at Waco and had mobilized both the Blue and Gold HRT tactical teams to the same site, which ultimately created pressure to resolve the situation tactically due to lack of HRT reserves.

At first, the Davidians had telephone contact with local news media, and Koresh gave phone interviews. The FBI then cut Davidian communication to the outside world. For the next 51 days, communication with those inside was by telephone by a group of 25 FBI negotiators. The final Justice Department report found that negotiators criticized the tactical commanders for undercutting negotiations.

In the first few days, the FBI believed they had made a breakthrough when they negotiated with Koresh an agreement that the Branch Davidians would peacefully leave the compound in return for a message, recorded by Koresh, being broadcast on national radio. The broadcast was made, but Koresh then told negotiators that God had told him to remain in the building and &quot;wait&quot;. Despite this, soon afterwards negotiators managed to facilitate the release of 19 children, ranging in age from five months to 12 years old, without their parents. However, 98 people remained in the building. The children were interviewed by the FBI and Texas Rangers, some for hours at a time. Allegedly, the children had been physically and sexually abused long before the standoff. This was the key justification offered by the FBI (both to then President Bill Clinton and to Attorney General Janet Reno) for launching CS gas attacks to force the Branch Davidians out of the compound.

During the siege, the FBI sent a video camera to the Branch Davidians. In the videotape made by Koresh&#x27;s followers, Koresh introduced his children and his &quot;wives&quot; to the FBI negotiators, including several minors who claimed to have had babies fathered by Koresh; he had fathered perhaps 14 of the children who stayed with him in the compound. Several Branch Davidians made statements in the video. On day nine, Monday, March 8, the Branch Davidians sent out the videotape to show the FBI that there were no hostages, but everyone was staying inside on their own free will. This video also included a message from Koresh.

The negotiators&#x27; log showed that when the video was reviewed, there was concern that its release to the media would gain sympathy for Koresh and the Branch Davidians. Videos also showed the 23 children still inside the compound, and child care professionals on the outside prepared to take care of those children as well as the previous 19 released. As the siege continued, Koresh negotiated for more time, allegedly so that he could write religious documents he needed to complete before surrendering. His conversations, which were dense with Biblical imagery, alienated the federal negotiators, who treated the situation as a hostage crisis. Among themselves, the negotiation teams took to calling Koresh&#x27;s words &quot;Bible babble.&quot;

On March 7, the FBI began consulting with Bible scholars Phillip Arnold and James Tabor, who studied a transcript of Koresh&#x27;s radio broadcast to try to understand his theology. That week, Arnold and Tabor were guests on talk radio programs on Dallas radio stations KRLB and KGBS. Koresh heard the programs on a battery-powered radio. On March 16, he asked the FBI for permission to discuss the Bible with Arnold directly. The FBI denied this request.

On April 1, Arnold and Tabor were interviewed by radio talk show host Ron Engleman on KGBS to discuss the situation. Tabor said that the Apostle Paul wrote much of the New Testament from prison and, in a similar manner, Koresh&#x27;s message would reach a wider audience if he surrendered peacefully, even if it meant going to prison. On April 4, a tape recording of this broadcast was delivered to Koresh by Dick DeGuerin, Koresh&#x27;s lawyer. According to David Thibodeau, an eyewitness inside the compound, Koresh responded favorably to the tape.

As the siege wore on, two factions developed within the FBI, one believing negotiation to be the answer, the other, force. Increasingly aggressive techniques were used to try to force the Branch Davidians out, for instance, sleep deprivation of the inhabitants through all-night broadcasts of recordings of jet planes, pop music, Buddhist chanting, and the screams of rabbits being slaughtered. Outside the compound, nine M3 Bradley infantry fighting vehicles carrying M651 CS tear gas grenades and ferret rounds, and five M728 Combat Engineer Vehicles obtained from the US Army began patrolling. The armored vehicles were used to destroy perimeter fencing and outbuildings and crush cars belonging to the Branch Davidians. Armored vehicles repeatedly drove over the grave of Peter Gent despite protests by the Branch Davidians and the negotiators.

Two of the three water storage tanks on the roof of the main building had been damaged during the initial ATF raid. Eventually, the FBI cut all power and water to the compound, forcing those inside to survive on rainwater and stockpiled military MRE rations. Criticism was later leveled by Schneider&#x27;s attorney, Jack Zimmerman, at the tactic of using sleep-and-peace-disrupting sound against the Branch Davidians: &quot;The point was this—they were trying to have sleep disturbance and they were trying to take someone that they viewed as unstable to start with, and they were trying to drive him crazy. And then they got mad &#x27;cos he does something that they think is irrational!&quot;

Despite the increasingly aggressive tactics, Koresh ordered a group of followers to leave. Eleven people left and were arrested as material witnesses, with one person charged with conspiracy to murder. The children&#x27;s willingness to stay with Koresh disturbed the negotiators, who were unprepared to work around the Branch Davidians&#x27; religious zeal. The children were aware that an earlier group of children who had left with some women were immediately separated, and the women arrested.

During the siege, several scholars who study apocalypticism in religious groups attempted to persuade the FBI that the siege tactics being used by government agents would only reinforce the impression within the Branch Davidians that they were part of a Biblical &quot;end-of-times&quot; confrontation that had cosmic significance. This would likely increase the chances of a violent and deadly outcome. The religious scholars pointed out that the beliefs of the group may have appeared to be extreme, but to the Branch Davidians, their religious beliefs were deeply meaningful, and they were willing to die for them.

Koresh&#x27;s discussions with the negotiating team became increasingly difficult. He proclaimed that he was the Second Coming of Christ and had been commanded by his father in heaven to remain in the compound. From April 5 until April 13, Koresh refused to speak to the FBI, citing observance of the Passover holiday. FBI planners, growing increasingly impatient, considered using snipers to kill Koresh and other key Branch Davidians. The FBI voiced concern that the Branch Davidians might commit mass suicide, as had happened in 1978 at Jim Jones&#x27; Jonestown complex. Koresh had repeatedly denied any plans for mass suicide when confronted by negotiators during the standoff, and people leaving the compound had not seen any such preparation.

On April 14, Koresh released a letter to his lawyer, Dick Deguerin, that was his last communication with the outside world. In it, he claimed to be writing down an interpretation of the seven seals of the Book of Revelation, promising to exit the compound as soon as it was completed:I want the people of this generation to be saved. I am working night and day to complete my final work of the writing out of these Seals. I thank my Father. He has finally granted me the chance to do this. It will bring New Light and hope to many and they will not have to deal with me the person. I will demand the first manuscript of the Seals be given to you. Many scholars and religious leaders will wish to have copies for examination. I will keep a copy with me. As soon as I can see that people like Jim Tabor and Phil Arnold have a copy I will come out and then you can do your thing with this beast.This letter sparked immediate disagreement within the FBI. While some saw it as a breakthrough, others ridiculed it, suspecting it to be a delay tactic to buy Koresh time to prepare for a violent confrontation. The FBI consulted psychologist Murray Miron of Syracuse University to understand Koresh&#x27;s mental state. After examining this and four other letters by Koresh, Miron wrote in an April 15 report that he exhibited &quot;all the hallmarks of rampant, morbidly virulent paranoia&quot; concluding &quot;I do not believe there is in these writings any better, or at least certain, hope for an early end to the siege.&quot;

== Final assault and the burning of the Mount Carmel Center ==

Newly appointed US Attorney General Janet Reno approved recommendations by the FBI Hostage Rescue Team to mount an assault, after being told that conditions were deteriorating and that children were being abused inside the compound. Reno made the FBI&#x27;s case to Clinton. Recalling the April 19, 1985, The Covenant, The Sword, and the Arm of the Lord (CSA) siege in Arkansas (which was ended without loss of life by a blockade without a deadline), Clinton suggested similar tactics against the Branch Davidians. Reno countered that the FBI Hostage Rescue Team was tired of waiting; that the standoff was costing a million dollars per week; that the Branch Davidians could hold out longer than the CSA; and that the chances of child sexual abuse and mass suicide were imminent. Clinton later recounted: &quot;Finally, I told her that if she thought it was the right thing to do, she could go ahead.&quot; Over the next months, Reno&#x27;s reason for approving the final CS gas attack varied from her initial claim that the FBI Hostage Rescue Team had told her that Koresh was sexually abusing children and beating babies (the FBI Hostage Rescue Team later denied evidence of child abuse during the standoff) to her claim that Linda Thompson&#x27;s &quot;Unorganized Militia of the United States&quot; was on the way to Waco &quot;either to help Koresh or to attack him.&quot;

The assault took place on April 19, 1993. Because the Branch Davidians were heavily armed, the FBI Hostage Rescue Team&#x27;s arms included .50 caliber (12.7 mm) rifles and armored Combat Engineering Vehicles (CEV). The CEVs used explosives to punch holes in the walls of buildings of the compound so they could pump in CS gas (tear gas) and try to force the Branch Davidians out without harming them. The stated plan called for increasing amounts of gas to be pumped in over two days to increase pressure. Officially, no armed assault was to be made. Regarding the initial plan to tear gas the building the spokesperson of the FBI Carl Stern claimed that input was taken from psychologists, psychiatrists, behavioral specialists, as well as, “scientific, medical stuff”. Loudspeakers were to be used to tell the Branch Davidians that there would be no armed assault and to ask them not to fire on the vehicles. According to the FBI, the Hostage Rescue Team agents had been permitted to return any incoming fire, but no shots were fired by federal agents on April 19. When several Branch Davidians opened fire, the FBI Hostage Rescue Team&#x27;s response was to increase the amount of gas being used. An anonymous official claimed that the reason for the FBI&#x27;s increased aggression was bureau audio listening equipment inside the compound; this claim was neither corroborated or denied by FBI Director William Sessions.

The FBI Hostage Rescue Team delivered Ferret brand CS gas rounds via M79 grenade launchers. Very early in the morning, the FBI Hostage Rescue Team fired two military M651 CS gas rounds at the Branch Davidian construction site. Around mid-morning, the FBI Hostage Rescue Team began to run low on 40 mm Ferret CS rounds and asked Texas Ranger Captain David Byrnes for CS gas rounds. The rounds procured from Company &quot;F&quot; in Waco turned out to be unusable pyrotechnics and were returned to Company &quot;F&quot;. 40 mm munitions recovered by the Texas Rangers at Waco included dozens of plastic Ferret Model SGA-400 Liquid CS rounds, two metal M651E1 military pyrotechnic CS gas rounds, two metal NICO Pyrotechnik sound and flash grenades, and parachute illumination flares. After more than six hours, no Branch Davidians had left the building, sheltering instead in an underground concrete block room (&quot;the bunker&quot;) within the building or using gas masks.

At around noon, three fires broke out almost simultaneously in different parts of the building and spread quickly; footage of the blaze was broadcast live by television crews. The government maintains the fires were deliberately started by the Branch Davidians. Some Branch Davidian survivors and other experts hold that the fires were accidentally or deliberately started by the assault, possibly by the pyrotechnic rounds used by the FBI.

Nine people left the building during the fire. The remaining Branch Davidians, including the children, were either buried alive by rubble, suffocated, or shot. Many were killed by smoke or carbon monoxide inhalation and other causes as fire engulfed the building. According to the FBI, Steve Schneider—Koresh&#x27;s top aide—shot and killed Koresh and then himself. In all, 76 people died. A large concentration of bodies, weapons, and ammunition was found in &quot;the bunker&quot; storage room. The Texas Rangers&#x27; arson investigator report assumes that many of the occupants were either denied escape from within or refused to leave until escape was not an option. It also mentions that the structural debris from the breaching operations on the west end of the building could have blocked a possible escape route through the tunnel system. An independent investigation by two experts from the University of Maryland&#x27;s Department of Fire Protection Engineering concluded that the compound residents had sufficient time to escape the fire, if they had wanted.

Autopsies of the dead revealed that some women and children found beneath a fallen concrete wall of a storage room died of skull injuries. The US Department of Justice report indicated that only one body had traces of benzene, one of the components of solvent-dispersed CS gas, but that the gas insertions had finished nearly an hour before the fire started, and that it was enough time for solvents to dissipate from the bodies of the Branch Davidians that had inhaled the gas. Autopsy records also indicate that at least 20 Branch Davidians were shot, including Koresh, as well as five children under the age of 14. Three-year-old Dayland Gent was stabbed in the chest. The medical examiner who performed the autopsies believed these deaths were mercy killings by the Branch Davidians trapped in the fire with no escape. The expert retained by the US Office of Special Counsel concluded that many of the gunshot wounds &quot;support self-destruction either by overt suicide, consensual execution (suicide by proxy), or less likely, forced execution.&quot;

=== Chronology of the events of April 19 ===
== Aftermath ==

The new ATF Director, John Magaw, criticized several aspects of the ATF raid. Magaw made the Treasury report on Waco required reading for new agents. A 1995 Government Accountability Office report on the use of force by federal law enforcement agencies observed that &quot;On the basis of Treasury&#x27;s report on the Waco operation and views of tactical operations experts and ATF&#x27;s own personnel, ATF decided in October 1995 that dynamic entry would only be planned after all other options have been considered and began to adjust its training accordingly.&quot;

Nothing remains of the buildings today other than concrete foundation components, as the entire site was bulldozed two weeks after the end of the siege. Only a small chapel, built years after the siege, stands on the site. It is still used by the remaining Branch Davidians as a place of worship and memorial. A memorial plaque for the four ATF agents killed in the shootout is on the grounds as is the barbed wire the authorities used to prevent the cult members from escaping.

=== FBI&#x27;s post-Waco adjustments ===
The Waco siege prompted the FBI to reevaluate its tactics and procedures. The agency made several adjustments in response to the criticism it faced. Firstly, there was a greater emphasis on crisis negotiation and peaceful resolutions, leading to increased training and the establishment of specialized negotiation teams. Secondly, the Hostage Rescue Team underwent enhancements in terms of training, equipment, and coordination to improve their effectiveness in high-risk operations. Interagency cooperation was emphasized to facilitate better coordination and information sharing among federal entities involved in complex operations. The FBI also recognized the value of intelligence gathering and analysis, leading to a focus on enhancing intelligence capabilities. Lastly, after-action reviews were conducted, and lessons learned were incorporated into training programs to better prepare agents for future situations.

=== Trial and imprisonments of Branch Davidians ===
The events at Mount Carmel spurred both criminal prosecution and civil litigation. On August 3, 1993, a federal grand jury returned a superseding ten-count indictment against 12 of the surviving Branch Davidians. The grand jury charged, among other things, that the Branch Davidians had conspired to, and aided and abetted in, the murder of federal officers, and had unlawfully possessed and used various firearms. The government dismissed the charges against one of the 12 Branch Davidians according to a plea bargain.

After a jury trial lasting nearly two months, the jury acquitted four of the Branch Davidians on all charges. Additionally, the jury acquitted all of the Branch Davidians on the murder-related charges but convicted five of them on lesser charges, including aiding and abetting the voluntary manslaughter of federal agents. Eight Branch Davidians were convicted on firearms charges.

The convicted Branch Davidians, who received sentences of up to 40 years, were:
* Kevin A. Whitecliff – convicted of voluntary manslaughter and using a firearm during a crime.
* Jaime Castillo – convicted of voluntary manslaughter and using a firearm during a crime.
* Paul Gordon Fatta – convicted of conspiracy to possess machine guns and aiding Branch Davidian leader Koresh in possessing machine guns.
* Renos Lenny Avraam (British national) – convicted of voluntary manslaughter and using a firearm during a crime.
* Graeme Leonard Craddock (Australian national) – convicted of possessing a grenade and using or possessing a firearm during a crime.
* Brad Eugene Branch – convicted of voluntary manslaughter and using a firearm during a crime.
* Livingstone Fagan (British national) – convicted of voluntary manslaughter and using a firearm during a crime.
* Ruth Riddle (Canadian national) – convicted of using or carrying a weapon during a crime.
* Kathy Schroeder – sentenced to three years after pleading guilty to a reduced charge of forcibly resisting arrest.

Six of the eight Branch Davidians appealed both their sentences and their convictions. They raised a host of issues, challenging the constitutionality of the prohibition on possession of machine guns, the jury instructions, the district court&#x27;s conduct of the trial, the sufficiency of the evidence, and the sentences imposed. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit vacated the defendants&#x27; sentences for use of machine guns, determining that the district court had made no finding that they had &quot;actively employed&quot; the weapons, but left the verdicts undisturbed in all other respects, in United States v. Branch, 91 F.3d 699 (5th Cir. 1996), cert. denied (1997).

On remand, the district court found that the defendants had actively employed machine guns and re-sentenced five of them to substantial prison terms. The defendants again appealed. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. The Branch Davidians pressed this issue before the United States Supreme Court. The Supreme Court reversed, holding that the term &quot;machine gun&quot; in the relevant statute created an element of the offense to be determined by a jury, rather than a sentencing factor to be determined by a judge, as had happened in the trial court. On September 19, 2000, Judge Walter Smith followed the Supreme Court&#x27;s instructions and cut 25 years from the sentences of five convicted Branch Davidians, and five years from the sentence of another. All Branch Davidians had been released from prison by July 2007.

Thirty-three British citizens were among the Branch Davidians during the siege. Twenty-four of them were among the 80 Branch Davidian fatalities (in the raid of February 28 and the assault of April 19), including at least one child. Two more British nationals who survived the siege were immediately arrested as &quot;material witnesses&quot; and imprisoned without trial for months. Derek Lovelock was held in McLennan County Jail for seven months, often in solitary confinement. Livingstone Fagan, another British citizen, who was among those convicted and imprisoned, says he received multiple beatings from correctional officers, particularly at Leavenworth. There, Fagan claims to have been doused inside his cell with cold water from a high-pressure hose, after which an industrial fan was placed outside the cell, blasting him with cold air. Fagan was repeatedly moved between at least nine different facilities. He was strip-searched every time he took exercise, so he refused exercise. Released and deported back to the UK in July 2007, he still retained his religious beliefs.

=== Civil suits by Branch Davidians ===
Several of the surviving Branch Davidians, as well as more than a hundred family members of those who had died or were injured in the confrontation, brought civil suits against the United States government, numerous federal officials, the former governor of Texas Ann Richards, and members of the Texas Army National Guard. They sought monetary damages under the Federal Tort Claims Act, civil rights statutes, the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, and Texas state law. The bulk of these claims were dismissed because they were insufficient as a matter of law or because the plaintiffs could advance no material evidence in support of them.

The court, after a month-long trial, rejected the Branch Davidians&#x27; case. The court found that, on February 28, 1993, the Branch Davidians initiated a gun battle when they fired at federal officers who were attempting to serve lawful warrants. ATF agents returned gunfire to the building, the court ruled, to protect themselves and other agents from death or serious bodily harm. The court found that the government&#x27;s planning of the siege—i.e., the decisions to use tear gas against the Branch Davidians; to insert the tear gas using military vehicles and to omit specific planning for the possibility that a fire would erupt—was a discretionary function for which the government could not be sued. The court also found that the use of tear gas was not negligent. Further, even if the United States government were negligent by causing damage to the buildings before the fires broke out, thus either blocking escape routes or enabling the fires to spread faster, that negligence did not legally cause the plaintiffs&#x27; injuries because the Branch Davidians started the fires.

The Branch Davidians appealed. They contended that the trial court judge, Walter S. Smith Jr., should have recused himself from hearing their claims on account of his relationships with defendants, defense counsel, and court staff; prior judicial determinations; and comments during trial. The Fifth Circuit concluded that these allegations did not reflect conduct that would cause a reasonable observer to question Judge Smith&#x27;s impartiality, and it affirmed the take-nothing judgment, in Andrade v. Chojnacki, 338 F.3d 448 (5th Cir. 2003), &quot;cert. denied&quot; (2004).

== Press coverage surrounding the Waco siege ==
The press coverage of the Waco siege was criticized for its sensationalism and for providing a platform for Koresh and his followers. Some journalists were accused of glamorizing Koresh and his beliefs, leading to concerns that the media attention may have unintentionally fueled the cult leader&#x27;s messianic complex and prolonged the standoff. The legal proceedings that followed were complex and involved charges ranging from firearms violations to conspiracy to commit murder. Several surviving Branch Davidians faced trial, and some were convicted and sentenced to lengthy prison terms. The trials were also criticized by some who believed that the defendants that were fueled by the media did not receive a fair trial or that the government failed to fully investigate its own actions during the siege.

== Controversies ==
Roland Ballesteros, one of the agents assigned to the ATF door team that assaulted the front door, told Texas Rangers and Waco police that he thought the first shots came from the ATF dog team assigned to neutralize the Branch Davidians&#x27; dogs, but later at the trial, he insisted that the Branch Davidians had shot first. The Branch Davidians also claimed that the ATF door team opened fire at the door, and they returned fire in self-defense. An &quot;Austin Chronicle&quot; article noted, &quot;Long before the fire, the Davidians were discussing the evidence contained in the doors. During the siege, in a phone conversation with the FBI, Steve Schneider, one of Koresh&#x27;s main confidants told FBI agents that &#x27;the evidence from the front door will clearly show how many bullets and what happened&#x27;.&quot; Houston attorney Dick DeGuerin, who went inside Mount Carmel during the siege, testified at the trial that protruding metal on the inside of the right-hand entry door made it clear that the bullet holes were made by incoming rounds. DeGuerin also testified that only the right-hand entry door had bullet holes, while the left-hand entry door was intact. The government presented the left-hand entry door at the trial, claiming that the right-hand entry door had been lost. The left-hand door contained numerous bullet holes made by both outgoing and incoming rounds. Texas Trooper Sgt. David Keys testified that he witnessed two men loading what could have been the missing door into a U-Haul van shortly after the siege had ended, but he did not see the object. Michael Caddell, the lead attorney for the Branch Davidians&#x27; wrongful death lawsuit explained, &quot;The fact that the left-hand door is in the condition it&#x27;s in tells you that the right-hand door was not consumed by the fire. It was lost on purpose by somebody.&quot; Caddell offered no evidence to support this allegation, which has never been proven. Fire investigators stated that it was &quot;extremely unlikely&quot; that the steel right door could have suffered damage in the fire much greater than did the steel left door, and both doors would have been found together. The right door remains missing, and the entire site was under close supervision by law enforcement officials until the debris—including both doors—had been removed.

In the weeks preceding the raid, Rick Alan Ross, a self-described cult expert and deprogrammer affiliated with the Cult Awareness Network, appeared on major networks such as NBC and CBS in regard to Koresh. Ross later described his role in advising authorities about the Davidians and Koresh, and what actions should be taken to end the siege. He was quoted as saying that he was consulted by the ATF and he contacted the FBI on March 4, 1993, requesting &quot;that he be interviewed regarding his knowledge of cults in general and the Branch Davidians in particular.&quot; The FBI reports that it did not rely on Ross for advice whatsoever during the standoff, but that it did an interview and received input from him. Ross also telephoned the FBI on March 27 and March 28, offering advice about negotiation strategies, suggesting that the FBI &quot;...attempt to embarrass Koresh by informing other members of the compound about Koresh&#x27;s faults and failures in life, in order to convince them that Koresh was not the prophet they had been led to believe.&quot; The ATF also contacted Ross in January 1993 for information about Koresh. Several writers have documented the Cult Awareness Network&#x27;s role about the government&#x27;s decision-making concerning Waco. Mark MacWilliams notes that several studies have shown how &quot;self-styled cult experts like Ross, anticult organizations like the Cult Awareness Network (CAN), and disaffected Branch Davidian defectors like Breault played important roles in popularizing a harshly negative image of Koresh as a dangerous cult leader. Portrayed as &quot;self-obsessed, egomaniacal, sociopathic and heartless&quot;, Koresh was frequently characterized as either a religious lunatic who doomed his followers to mass suicide or a con man who manipulated religion for his own bizarre personal advantage.&quot; According to religious scholars Phillip Arnold and James Tabor who made an effort to help resolve the conflict, &quot;the crisis need not have ended tragically if only the FBI had been more open to Religious Studies and better able to distinguish between the dubious ideas of Ross and the scholarly expertise.&quot;

In a &quot;New Yorker&quot; article in 2014, Malcolm Gladwell wrote that Arnold and Tabor told the FBI that Koresh needed to be persuaded of an alternative interpretation of the Book of Revelation, one that does not involve a violent end. They made an audiotape, which they played for Koresh, and which seemed to convince him. The FBI waited only three days before beginning the assault, instead of an estimated two weeks for Koresh to complete a manuscript sparked by this alternative interpretation, and then come out peacefully. An article by Stuart A. Wright published in &quot;Nova Religio&quot; discussed how the FBI mishandled the siege, stating that &quot;there is no greater example of misfeasance than the failure of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to bring about a bloodless resolution to the 51-day standoff.&quot; Some of Wright&#x27;s major concerns about the operation include that the FBI officials, especially Dick Rogers, exhibited increasing impatience and aggression when the conflict could have been resolved by more peaceful negotiation. He mentions that Rogers said in an interview with the FBI that &quot;when we started depriving them, [we were] really driving people closer to him [Koresh] because of their devotion to him,&quot; which was different from what he said in the Department of Justice report.

Attorney General Reno had specifically directed that no pyrotechnic devices be used in the assault. Between 1993 and 1999, FBI spokesmen denied (even under oath) the use of any sort of pyrotechnic devices during the assault, but pyrotechnic Flite-Rite CS gas grenades had been found in the rubble immediately following the fire. In 1999, FBI spokesmen backtracked, saying that they had used the grenades, but then contended they had only been used during an early morning attempt to penetrate a covered, water-filled construction pit 40 yards (35 m) away and were not fired into the building. The FBI stated that the pyrotechnic devices were unlikely to have contributed to the fire. When the FBI&#x27;s documents were turned over to Congress for an investigation in 1994, the page listing the use of the pyrotechnic devices was missing. The failure for six years to disclose the use of pyrotechnics, despite her specific directive, led Reno to demand an investigation. A senior FBI official told &quot;Newsweek&quot; that as many as 100 FBI agents had known about the use of pyrotechnics, but no one spoke up until 1999.

The FBI had planted surveillance devices in the walls of the building, which captured several conversations the government claims are evidence that the Davidians started the fire. The recordings were imperfect and at many times difficult to understand, and the two transcriptions that were made had differences at many points. According to reporter Diana Fuentes, when the FBI&#x27;s April 19 tapes were played in court during the Branch Davidian trials, few people heard what the FBI audio expert claimed to hear; the tapes &quot;were filled with noise, and voices only occasionally were discernible… The words were faint; some courtroom observers said they heard it, some didn&#x27;t.&quot; The Branch Davidians had given ominous warnings involving a fire on several occasions. This may or may not have been indicative of the Branch Davidians&#x27; future actions, but was the basis for the conclusion of Congress that the fire was started by the Branch Davidians, &quot;absent any other potential source of ignition.&quot; This was before the FBI admission that pyrotechnics were used, but a yearlong investigation by the Office of the Special Counsel after that admission nonetheless reached the same conclusion, and no further congressional investigations followed. During a 1999 deposition for civil suits by Branch Davidian survivors, fire survivor Graeme Craddock was interviewed. He stated that he saw some Branch Davidians moving about a dozen one gallon (3.8 L) cans of fuel so they would not be run over by armored vehicles, heard talk of pouring fuel outside the building, and after the fire had started, something that sounded like &quot;light the fire&quot; from another person. Professor Kenneth Newport&#x27;s book &quot;The Branch Davidians of Waco&quot; attempts to prove that starting the fire themselves was pre-planned and consistent with the Branch Davidians&#x27; theology. He cites as evidence the above-mentioned recordings by the FBI during the siege, testimonials of survivors Clive Doyle and Graeme Craddock, and the buying of diesel fuel one month before the start of the siege.

The FBI received contradictory reports on the possibility of Koresh&#x27;s suicide and was not sure about whether he would commit suicide. The evidence made them believe that there was no possibility of mass suicide, with Koresh and Schneider repeatedly denying to the negotiators that they had plans to commit mass suicide, and people leaving the compound saying that they had seen no preparations for such a thing. There was a possibility that some of his followers would join Koresh if he decided to commit suicide. According to Alan A. Stone&#x27;s report, during the siege the FBI used an incorrect psychiatric perspective to evaluate Branch Davidians&#x27; responses, which caused them to over-rely on Koresh&#x27;s statements that they would not commit suicide. According to Stone, this incorrect evaluation caused the FBI to not ask pertinent questions to Koresh and to others on the compound about whether they were planning a mass suicide. A more pertinent question would have been, &quot;What will you do if we tighten the noose around the compound in a show of overwhelming power, and using CS gas, force you to come out?&quot; Stone wrote: The tactical arm of federal law enforcement may conventionally think of the other side as a band of criminals or as a military force or, generically, as the aggressor. But the Branch Davidians were an unconventional group in an exalted, disturbed and desperate state of mind. They were devoted to David Koresh as the Lamb of God. They were willing to die defending themselves in an apocalyptic ending and, in the alternative, to kill themselves and their children. However, these were neither psychiatrically depressed, suicidal people nor cold-blooded killers. They were ready to risk death as a test of their faith. The psychology of such behavior—together with its religious significance for the Branch Davidians—was mistakenly evaluated, if not simply ignored, by those responsible for the FBI strategy of &quot;tightening the noose&quot;. The overwhelming show of force was not working in the way the tacticians supposed. It did not provoke the Branch Davidians to surrender, but it may have provoked David Koresh to order the mass-suicide.

=== Danforth&#x27;s report ===
The Oklahoma City bombing on April 19, 1995, caused the media to revisit many of the questionable aspects of the government&#x27;s actions at Waco, and many Americans who previously supported those actions began asking for an investigation of them. By 1999—as a result of certain aspects of the documentaries discussed below, as well as allegations made by advocates for Branch Davidians during litigation, public opinion held that the federal government had engaged in serious misconduct at Waco. A &quot;Time&quot; poll conducted on August 26, 1999, for example, indicated that 61 percent of the public believed that federal law enforcement officials started the fire at the Branch Davidian complex.

In September 1999, Attorney General Reno appointed former US Senator John C. Danforth as Special Counsel to investigate the matter. In particular, the Special Counsel was directed to investigate charges that government agents started or spread the fire at the Mount Carmel complex, directed gunfire at the Branch Davidians, and unlawfully employed the armed forces of the United States. A yearlong investigation ensued, during which the Office of the Special Counsel interviewed 1,001 witnesses, reviewed over 2.3 million pages of documents, and examined thousands of pounds of physical evidence. In the &quot;&quot; of November 8, 2000, Special Counsel Danforth concluded that the allegations were meritless. The report found that certain government employees had failed to disclose during litigation against the Branch Davidians the use of pyrotechnic devices at the complex, and had obstructed the Special Counsel&#x27;s investigation. Disciplinary action was pursued against the employees.

Allegations that the government started the fire were largely based on an FBI agent&#x27;s having fired three &quot;pyrotechnic&quot; tear gas rounds, which are delivered with a charge that burns. The Special Counsel concluded that the rounds did not start or contribute to the spread of the fire, based on their finding that the FBI fired the rounds nearly four hours before the fire started, at a concrete construction pit partially filled with water, away and downwind from the main living quarters of the complex. The Special Counsel noted that recorded interceptions of Branch Davidian conversations included such statements as &quot;David said we have to get the fuel on&quot; and &quot;So we light it first when they come in with the tank right ... right as they&#x27;re coming in.&quot; Some Branch Davidians who survived the fire acknowledged that other Branch Davidians started the fire. FBI agents witnessed Branch Davidians pouring fuel and igniting a fire, and noted these observations contemporaneously. Lab analysis found accelerants on the clothing of Branch Davidians, and investigators found deliberately punctured fuel cans and a homemade torch at the site. Based on this evidence and testimony, the Special Counsel concluded that the fire was started by the Branch Davidians.

Charges that government agents fired shots into the complex on April 19, 1993, were based on forward looking infrared (FLIR) video recorded by the Night Stalkers aircraft. These tapes showed 57 flashes, with some occurring around government vehicles that were operating near the complex. The Office of Special Counsel conducted a field test of FLIR technology on March 19, 2000, to determine whether gunfire caused the flashes. The testing was conducted under a protocol agreed to and signed by attorneys and experts for the Branch Davidians and their families, as well as for the government. Analysis of the shape, duration, and location of the flashes indicated that they resulted from a reflection off debris on or around the complex, rather than gunfire. Additionally, an independent expert review of photography taken at the scene showed no people at or near the points from which the flashes emanated. Interviews of Branch Davidians, government witnesses, filmmakers, writers, and advocates for the Branch Davidians found that none had witnessed any government gunfire on April 19. None of the Branch Davidians who died on that day displayed evidence of having been struck by a high velocity round, as would be expected had they been shot from outside of the complex by government sniper rifles or other assault weapons. Given this evidence, the Special Counsel concluded that the claim that government gunfire occurred on April 19, 1993, amounted to &quot;an unsupportable case based entirely upon flawed technological assumptions.&quot;

The Special Counsel considered whether the use of active-duty military at Waco violated the Posse Comitatus Act or the Military Assistance to Law Enforcement Act. These statutes generally prohibit direct military participation in law enforcement functions but do not preclude indirect support such as lending equipment, training in the use of equipment, offering expert advice, and providing equipment maintenance. The Special Counsel noted that the military provided &quot;extensive&quot; loans of equipment to the ATF and FBI, including—among other things—two tanks, the offensive capability of which had been disabled. Additionally, the military provided limited advice, training, and medical support. The Special Counsel concluded that these actions amounted to indirect military assistance within the bounds of applicable law. The Texas National Guard, in its state status, also provided substantial loans of military equipment, as well as performing reconnaissance flights over the Branch Davidian complex. Because the Posse Comitatus Act does not apply to the National Guard in its state status, the Special Counsel determined that the National Guard lawfully provided its assistance.

Ramsey Clark—a former US Attorney General, who represented several Branch Davidian survivors and relatives in a civil lawsuit—said that the report &quot;failed to address the obvious&quot;: &quot;History will clearly record, I believe, that these assaults on the Mt. Carmel church center remain the greatest domestic law enforcement tragedy in the history of the United States.&quot;

== Equipment and manpower ==

=== Government agencies ===
* Raid (February 28): 75 federal agents (ATF and FBI); three Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters crewed by 10 Texas National Guard counter-drug personnel as distraction during the raid and filming; ballistic protection equipment, fire retardant clothing, regular flashlights, regular cameras (i.e., flash photography), pump-action shotguns and flashbang grenades, 9 mm handguns, 9 mm MP5 submachine guns, 5.56 NATO M16 rifles, a .308 bolt-action sniper rifle.
* Siege (March 1 through April 18): Hundreds of federal agents; two Bell UH-1 Iroquois helicopters.
* Assault (April 19): Hundreds of federal agents; military vehicles (with their normal weapon systems removed): approx. nine M3 Bradley infantry fighting vehicles, four or five M728 Combat Engineering Vehicles (CEVs) armed with CS gas, two M1A1 Abrams main battle tanks, one M88 recovery vehicle.
* Support: one Britten-Norman Defender surveillance aircraft; a number of Texas National Guard personnel for maintenance of military vehicles and training on the use of the vehicles and their support vehicles (Humvees and flatbed trucks); surveillance from Texas National Guard counter-drug UC-26 surveillance aircraft and from Alabama National Guard; three soldiers from Delta Force, to serve as observers (also present during assault); two senior US Army officers as advisers, two members of the British Army&#x27;s 22nd Special Air Service (SAS) Regiment as observers; 50+ men in total.

=== Branch Davidians ===
The Branch Davidians were well-stocked with small arms, possessing 305 total firearms, including numerous rifles (semi-automatic AK-47s and AR-15s), shotguns, revolvers and pistols; 46 semi-automatic firearms modified to fire in fully automatic mode (included on above list): 22 AR-15 (erroneously referred to as M16), 20 AK-47 rifles, 2 HK SP-89, 2 M-11/Nine Texas Rangers reported &quot;at least 16 AR-15 rifles,&quot;; 2 AR-15 lower receivers modified to fire in fully automatic mode; 39 &quot;auto sear&quot; devices used to convert semi-automatic weapons into automatic weapons; parts for fully automatic AK-47 and M16 rifles; 30-round magazines and 100-round magazines for M16 and AK-47 rifles; pouches to carry large ammunition magazines; substantial quantities of ammunition of various sizes.

Other items found at the compound included about 1.9 million rounds of &quot;cooked off&quot; ammunition; grenade launcher parts; flare launchers; gas masks and chemical warfare suits; night vision equipment; hundreds of practice hand grenade hulls and components (including more than 200 inert M31 practice rifle grenades, more than 100 modified M-21 practice hand grenade bodies, 219 grenade safety pins and 243 grenade safety levers found after the fire); Kevlar helmets and ballistic vests; 88 lower receivers for the AR-15 rifle; and approximately 15 sound suppressors or silencers (the Treasury reports lists 21 silencers, Texas Rangers report that at least six items had been mislabeled and were actually 40 mm grenades or flash bang grenades from manufacturers who sold those models to the ATF or FBI exclusively; former Branch Davidian Donald Bunds testified he had manufactured silencers under direct orders of Koresh).

The ATF knew that the Branch Davidians had two .50 caliber rifles, so they asked for Bradley fighting vehicles, which could resist that caliber. During the siege, Koresh said that he had weapons bigger than .50 rifles and that he could destroy the Bradleys, so they were supplemented with two Abrams tanks and five M728 vehicles. The Texas Rangers recovered at least two .50 caliber weapons from the remains of the compound.

Whether the Branch Davidians fired the .50 caliber rifles during the raid or the assault is disputed. Various groups supporting gun control, such as Handgun Control Incorporated and the Violence Policy Center, have claimed that the Branch Davidians had fired .50 caliber rifles, and they have cited this as one reason to ban these weapons. The ATF claims such rifles were used against ATF agents the day of the search. Several years later, the General Accounting Office, in response to a request from Henry Waxman, released a briefing paper titled &quot;Criminal Activity Associated with .50 Caliber Semiautomatic Rifles&quot; that repeated the ATF&#x27;s claims that the Branch Davidians used .50 caliber rifles during the search. FBI Hostage Rescue Team snipers reported sighting one of the weapons, readily identifiable by its distinctive muzzle brake, during the siege.

== Legacy ==
=== Connection to the Oklahoma City bombing ===


Timothy McVeigh cited the Waco incident as a primary motivation for the Oklahoma City bombing, his 19 April 1995 truck bomb attack that destroyed the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building, a US government office complex in downtown Oklahoma City, and destroyed or damaged numerous other buildings in the vicinity. The attack claimed 168 lives (including 19 children under age 6) and left over 600 injured in the deadliest act of terrorism on US soil before the September 11 attacks. As of 2024, it remains the deadliest act of domestic terrorism in American history.

Within days after the bombing, McVeigh and Terry Nichols were both taken into custody for their roles in the bombing. Investigators determined that the two were both sympathizers of an anti-government militia movement and that their motive was to avenge the government&#x27;s handling of the Waco and Ruby Ridge incidents. McVeigh testified that he chose the date of April 19 because it was the second anniversary of the deadly fire at Mount Carmel. In March 1993, McVeigh drove from Arizona to Waco to observe the federal standoff. Along with other protesters, he was photographed by the FBI, and McVeigh was briefly interviewed by a television reporter. A courtroom reporter also claims to have later seen McVeigh outside the courthouse at Waco, selling anti-government bumper stickers.

Other events sharing the date of fire at Mt. Carmel have been mentioned in discussions of the Waco siege. The April 20, 1999, Columbine High School massacre might have been timed to mark either an anniversary of the FBI&#x27;s assault at Waco or Adolf Hitler&#x27;s birthday. Some of the connections appear coincidental. Eight years before the Waco fire, the ATF and FBI raided another compound of a religious cult: The Covenant, the Sword, and the Arm of the Lord. Some ATF agents who were present at that raid were present at Waco. April 19 was also the date from the American Revolution&#x27;s opening battles of Lexington and Concord.

=== Montana Freeman siege ===
The Montana Freemen became the center of public attention in 1996 when they engaged in a prolonged armed standoff with agents of the FBI. The Waco siege, as well as the 1992 incident between the Weaver family and the FBI at Ruby Ridge, Idaho, were still fresh in the public mind, and the FBI was extremely cautious and wanted to prevent a recurrence of those violent events. After 81 days of negotiations, the Freemen surrendered to authorities on June 14, 1996, without loss of life.

=== Media portrayals of Waco ===
The Waco siege has been the subject of numerous documentary films and books. The first film was a made-for television docudrama film, &quot;In the Line of Duty: Ambush in Waco&quot;, which was made during the siege, before the April 19 assault on the church, and presented the initial firefight of February 28, 1993 as an ambush. The film&#x27;s writer, Phil Penningroth, has since disowned his screenplay as pro-ATF &quot;propaganda&quot;.

====Books====
The first book about the incident was 1993&#x27;s &quot;Inside the Cult&quot; co-authored by ex-Branch Davidian Marc Breault, who left the group in September 1989, and Martin King who interviewed Koresh for Australian television in 1992. In July 1993, true crime author Clifford L. Linedecker published his book &quot;Massacre at Waco, Texas&quot;.

Shortly after, in 1994, a collection of 45 essays called &quot;From the Ashes: Making Sense of Waco&quot; was published, about the events of Waco from various cultural, historical, and religious perspectives. The essays in the book include one by Michael Barkun that talked about how the Branch Davidians&#x27; behavior was consistent with other millenarian religious sects and how the use of the word cult is used to discredit religious organizations, one by James R. Lewis that claims a large amount of evidence that the FBI lit the fires, and many others. All of these perspectives are united in the belief that the deaths of the Branch Davidians at Waco could have been prevented and that &quot;the popular demonization of nontraditional religious movements in the aftermath of Waco represents a continuing threat to freedom of religion&quot;.

Carol Moore&#x27;s The Davidian Massacre: Disturbing Questions About Waco That Must Be Answered was published in 1995.

The American novelist John Updike has been directly inspired by the Waco events for the fourth and last part of his book &quot;In the Beauty of the Lilies&quot; (1996) which described how a troubled child could integrate such a sect and the inner dynamics that led to a collective massacre.

====Documentaries====
The first documentary films critical of the official versions were &quot;Waco, the Big Lie&quot; and &quot;Waco II, the Big Lie Continues&quot;, both produced by Linda Thompson in 1993. Thompson&#x27;s films made several controversial allegations, the most notorious of which was her claim that footage of an armored vehicle breaking through the outer walls of the compound, with an appearance of orange light on its front, was showing a flamethrower attached to the vehicle, setting fire to the building. As a response to Thompson, Michael McNulty released footage to support his counter-claim that the appearance of light was a reflection on aluminized insulation that was torn from the wall and snagged on the vehicle. (The vehicle is an M728 CEV, which is not normally equipped with a flamethrower.) McNulty accused Thompson of &quot;creative editing&quot; in his film &quot;Waco: An Apparent Deviation&quot;. Thompson worked from a VHS copy of the surveillance tape; McNulty was given access to a beta original. McNulty in turn was later accused of having digitally altered his footage, an allegation he denied.

The next film was &quot;Day 51: The True Story of Waco&quot;, produced in 1995 by Richard Mosley and featuring Ron Cole, a self-proclaimed militia member from Colorado who was later prosecuted for weapons violations. Thompson&#x27;s and Mosley&#x27;s films, along with extensive coverage given to the Waco siege on some talk radio shows, galvanized support for the Branch Davidians among some sections of the right, including the nascent militia movement, while critics on the left also denounced the government siege on civil liberties grounds. In 2000, radio host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones made a documentary film, &quot;America Wake Up (Or Waco)&quot;, about the government&#x27;s purported role in the siege.

In 1997, filmmakers Dan Gifford and Amy Sommer produced their Emmy Award-winning documentary film, &quot;&quot;, presenting a history of the Branch Davidian movement and a critical examination of the conduct of law enforcement, both leading up to the raid and through the aftermath of the fire. The film features footage of the Congressional hearings on Waco, and the juxtaposition of official government spokespeople with footage and evidence often directly contradicting the spokespeople. In the documentary, Dr. Edward Allard (who held patents on FLIR technology) maintained that flashes on the FBI&#x27;s infra-red footage were consistent with a grenade launcher and automatic small arms fire from FBI positions at the back of the complex toward the locations that would have provided exits for Branch Davidians attempting to flee the fire. &quot;Waco: The Rules of Engagement&quot; was nominated for a 1997 Academy Award for best documentary and was followed by another film in 1999, &quot;Waco: A New Revelation&quot;.

In 2001, another Michael McNulty documentary, &quot;The F.L.I.R. Project&quot;, researched the aerial thermal images recorded by the FBI, and using identical FLIR equipment recreated the same results as were recorded by federal agencies April 19, 1993. Subsequent government-funded studies contend that the infra-red evidence does not support the view that the FBI improperly used incendiary devices or fired on Branch Davidians. Infra-red experts continue to disagree and filmmaker Amy Sommer stands by the original conclusions presented in &quot;Waco: The Rules of Engagement&quot;.

The documentary &quot;The Assault on Waco&quot; was first aired in 2006 on the Discovery Channel, detailing the entire incident. A British-American documentary, &quot;Inside Waco&quot;, was produced jointly by Channel 4 and HBO in 2007, attempting to show what happened inside by piecing together accounts from the parties involved. The MSNBC documentary &quot;Witness to Waco: Inside the Siege&quot; was released in 2009.

A Netflix documentary series called &quot;&quot;, was released in March 2023. The series encompasses three episodes and features real and never before released footage and interviews with surviving cult members along with others involved.

Dramatizations

In 2018, the miniseries &quot;Waco&quot; premiered on Paramount Network, dramatizing both the Waco siege and the 1992 siege at Ruby Ridge. It received mixed reviews, with critics praising the direction and performances but criticizing the show&#x27;s overly sympathetic portrayal of Koresh.

====Songs====
Grant Lee Buffalo&#x27;s 1994 album &quot;Mighty Joe Moon&quot; opening track &quot;Lone Star Song&quot; directly references the siege.

Two heavy metal bands wrote songs about the Davidian standoff: Machine Head&#x27;s &quot;Davidian&quot; opened their debut album &quot;Burn My Eyes&quot; and Sepultura’s &quot;Amen&quot; was the fourth track from their &quot;Chaos A.D.&quot; album. Native American activist Russell Means included a song about the siege on his 2007 album &quot;The Radical&quot;, titled &quot;Waco: The White Man&#x27;s Wounded Knee&quot;.

Punk rock band No use for a name wrote “51 days” about the massacre, and as reference to how long the standoff lasted from their 1995 album ¡Leche con carne!.

Hip hop duo Heavy Metal Kings, featuring Vinnie Paz of Jedi Mind Tricks and Ill Bill, reference the siege in their song &quot;Impaled Nazarene&quot; from their 2011 self-titled debut. Ill Bill recounts Koresh&#x27;s story, portraying him in a positive light. The track ends with an audio clip of Koresh talking as the music fades out over the last moment. Jedi Mind Tricks has a history of incorporating mysticism and conspiracy theories into his music, and he also incorporated them into the song &quot;Blood In Blood Out&quot; from the 2003 album &quot;Visions of Gandhi&quot; raps &quot;I like blood/ I like tastin&#x27; ya flesh/ I like slugs/ I like David Koresh.&quot;

Also in 2011, British indie rock band the Indelicates released a concept album, &quot;David Koresh Superstar&quot;, about Koresh and the Waco siege.

Japanese doom metal band Church of Misery released a song about Koresh and the Waco Siege on their 2023 album &quot;Born Under a Mad Sign&quot; entitled &quot;Come and Get Me Sucker (David Koresh).&quot; The song also includes an audio sample from an interview between Koresh and journalist Martin King that originally aired on the Australian television program &quot;A Current Affair&quot;.

====Video games====
The map Oregon from the tactical shooter &quot;Rainbow Six Siege&quot;, developed and published by Ubisoft, bears a similarity to the Mount Carmel Center. Despite the fact that it has not been confirmed by the developers, it has also been seen as a source of inspiration for the map&#x27;s setting, because the main building closely resembles the Davidians&#x27; church. While the map does not include the entire compound, comparing the two bears a striking resemblance to the original compound.

===Series===
The Waco siege is used as a subplot in the episode &quot;Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub&quot; of South Park S3E8. In the episode the ATF plans to save the day by stopping the &#x27;cultists&#x27; of a meteor-shower from killing themselves. Even if it means they have to &quot;Kill every single one of them&quot;. The episode depicted the ATF as incompetent and shows them killing multiple innocent people needlessly.

The X-Files season 4 episode 5, The Field Where I Died makes references to various cult related events from that period, including the Waco siege. The episode centres around an ATF and FBI investigation of a cult compound suspected to be involved in child abuse and illegal gun manufacturing. 

====Personal accounts====
Branch Davidian survivor David Thibodeau wrote his account of life in the group and of the siege in the book &quot;A Place Called Waco&quot;, published in 1999. His book served in part as the basis for the 2018 Paramount Network six-part television drama miniseries &quot;Waco&quot;, starring Michael Shannon as the FBI negotiator Gary Noesner, Taylor Kitsch as Koresh, and Rory Culkin as Thibodeau. Developed by John Erick Dowdle and Drew Dowdle, it premiered on January 24, 2018.

&quot;The City of God: A New American Opera&quot; by Joshua Armenta dramatized the negotiations between the FBI and Koresh, premiered in 2012, utilizing actual transcripts from the negotiations as well as biblical texts and hymns from the Davidian hymnal. In 2015, Retro Report released a mini documentary looking back at Waco and how it has fueled many right-wing militias.

<text>R. Talsorian Games (RTG) is a designer and publisher of role-playing game books and accessories. Originally based in Berkeley, California, the company was moved to Renton, Washington, in 1997. Their titles include the &quot;Cyberpunk&quot; series and several anime-related RPG titles. Their major product line today is the Fuzion system.

The company&#x27;s chairman is Mike Pondsmith, usually known as &quot;Maximum Mike&quot; by players, R. Talsorian Games, and members of their online bulletin board.

Products include &quot;Cyberpunk 2020&quot;, &quot;Mekton Zeta&quot; (an anime RPG), &quot;Castle Falkenstein&quot; (a Sorcery and steampunk RPG), &quot;The Witcher: Role-Playing Game&quot; (based on a fantasy series based on novels by Andrzej Sapkowski and video games by CD Projekt Red), &quot;Teenagers from Outer Space&quot; (an anime universal setting, the first generic anime RPG until the creation of &quot;Big Eyes, Small Mouth&quot; using the Tri-Stat system) and several RPGS based on anime such as &quot;Bubblegum Crisis&quot;, &quot;Armored Trooper Votoms&quot; and &quot;Dragonball Z&quot;. They also produced the short-lived &quot;Dream Park&quot; RPG based on the setting of the &quot;Dream Park&quot; novels.

== History ==
The success of his small-press published game &quot;Mekton&quot; convinced Mike Pondsmith that he would be able to make a business by designing games, so he founded R. Talsorian Games in 1985, and using this new company he published a second edition of &quot;Mekton&quot; (1986). The company&#x27;s second game was &quot;Teenagers from Outer Space&quot; (1987). The third published edition of &quot;Mekton&quot; was called &quot;Mekton II&quot; (1987) and was the company&#x27;s first game to use their full-fledged Interlock System. Pondsmith&#x27;s next game, &quot;Cyberpunk 2013&quot; (1988), was R. Talsorian&#x27;s second design to use the Interlock game system.

R. Talsorian was one of the first RPG publishers to embrace desktop publishing. Its first desktop published books were &quot;Mekton II&quot; in 1987, which looked much different from products that R. Talsorian would be putting out just a few years later (such as &quot;Cyberpunk 2020&quot; (1989)). &quot;Cyberpunk&quot; became wildly popular and received most of the company&#x27;s attention for much of the rest of its lifespan.

After an eight-year hiatus that began with its withdrawal from GenCon in 1998 over a conflict regarding floor space and dealer space, the company began a semi-regular publishing schedule again in 2006. Despite its &quot;major&quot; lines being on hiatus during that period, RTG still supported three licensed anime RPG lines (&quot;Bubblegum Crisis&quot;, &quot;Armored Trooper VOTOMS&quot; and &quot;Dragonball Z&quot;) through its ANimechaniX label and occasionally issued reprints for &quot;Mekton Z&quot; and &quot;Cyberpunk 2020&quot;.

On January 4, 2006, R. Talsorian Games founded their first demo team, The Chrome Berets. The Chrome Berets were founded and are supervised by David &quot;Knighthawk&quot; Simpson, creator of Knighthawk’s Cyberpunk Archive, a popular fan site for the game. The purpose of The Chrome Berets is to promote the company and products and playtest upcoming products.

<text>Jean-Victor Poncelet (; 1 July 1788 – 22 December 1867) was a French engineer and mathematician who served most notably as the Commanding General of the . He is considered a reviver of projective geometry, and his work &quot;Traité des propriétés projectives des figures&quot; is considered the first definitive text on the subject since Gérard Desargues&#x27; work on it in the 17th century. He later wrote an introduction to it: &quot;Applications d&#x27;analyse et de géométrie&quot;.

As a mathematician, his most notable work was in projective geometry, although an early collaboration with Charles Julien Brianchon provided a significant contribution to Feuerbach&#x27;s theorem. He also made discoveries about projective harmonic conjugates; relating these to the poles and polar lines associated with conic sections. He developed the concept of parallel lines meeting at a point at infinity and defined the circular points at infinity that are on every circle of the plane. These discoveries led to the principle of duality, and the principle of continuity and also aided in the development of complex numbers.

As a military engineer, he served in Napoleon&#x27;s campaign against the Russian Empire in 1812, in which he was captured and held prisoner until 1814. Later, he served as a professor of mechanics at the École d&#x27;application in his home town of Metz, during which time he published &quot;Introduction à la mécanique industrielle&quot;, a work he is famous for, and improved the design of turbines and water wheels. While a professor of applied mechanics, he also, independently from Coriolis, pioneered the use of work in mechanics and the work-energy theorem, including coining the term &quot;mechanical work&quot;. In 1837, a tenured &#x27;Chaire de mécanique physique et expérimentale&#x27; was specially created for him at the Sorbonne (the University of Paris). In 1848, he became the commanding general of his &quot;alma mater&quot;, the . He is honoured by having his name listed among notable French engineers and scientists displayed around the first stage of the Eiffel tower.

==Biography==

===Birth, education, and capture (1788–1814)===
Poncelet was born in Metz, France, on 1 July 1788, the illegitimate then legitimated son of Claude Poncelet, a lawyer of the Parliament of Metz and wealthy landowner. His mother, Anne-Marie Perrein, had a more modest background. At a young age, he was sent to live with the Olier family at Saint-Avold. He returned to Metz for his secondary education, at Lycée Fabert. After this, he attended the , a prestigious school in Paris, from 1808 to 1810, though he fell behind in his studies in his third year due to poor health. After graduation, he joined the Corps of Military Engineers. He attended the École d&#x27;application in his hometown during this time, and achieved the rank of lieutenant in the French Army the same year he graduated.

Poncelet took part in Napoleon&#x27;s invasion of Russia in 1812. His biographer Didion writes that he was part of the group which was cut from Marshal Michel Ney&#x27;s army at the Battle of Krasnoi and was forced to capitulate to the Russians, though other sources say that he was left for dead. Upon capture, he was interrogated by General Mikhail Andreyevich Miloradovich, but he did not disclose any information. The Russians held him as a prisoner of war and confined him at Saratov. During his imprisonment, in the years 1812–1814, he wrote his most notable work, &quot;Traité des propriétés projectives des figures&quot;, which outlined the foundations of projective geometry, as well as some new results. Poncelet, however, could not publish it until after his release in 1814.

===Release and later employment (1822–1848)===
In 1815, the year after his release, Poncelet was employed a military engineer at his hometown of Metz. In 1822, while at this position, he published &quot;Traité des propriétés projectives des figures&quot;. This was the first major work to discuss projective geometry since Desargues&#x27;, though Gaspard Monge had written a few minor works about it previously. It is considered the founding work of modern projective geometry. Joseph Diaz Gergonne also wrote about this branch of geometry at approximately the same time, beginning in 1810. Poncelet published several papers about the subject in Annales de Gergonne (officially known as &quot;Annales de mathématiques pures et appliquées&quot;). However, Poncelet and Gergonne ultimately engaged in a bitter priority dispute over the Principle of Duality.

In 1825, he became the professor of mechanics at the École d&#x27;Application in Metz, a position he held until 1835. During his tenure at this school, he improved the design of turbines and water wheels, deriving his work from the mechanics of the Provençal mill from southern France. Although the turbine of his design was not constructed until 1838, he envisioned such a design twelve years previous to that. In 1835, he left École d&#x27;Application, and in December 1837 became a tenured professor at Sorbonne (the University of Paris), where a &#x27;Chaire de mécanique physique et expérimentale&#x27; was specially created for him with the support of Louis Jacques Thénard.

===Commanding General at École Polytechnique (1848–1867)===
In 1848, Poncelet became the Commanding General of his &quot;alma mater&quot;, the École Polytechnique. He held the position until 1850, when he retired.

During this time, he wrote &quot;Applications d&#x27;analyse et de géométrie&quot;, which served as an introduction to his earlier work &quot;Traité des propriétés projectives des figures&quot;. It was published in two volumes in 1862 and 1864. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1865.

==Contributions==
===Poncelet–Steiner theorem===

Poncelet discovered the following theorem in 1822: Euclidean compass and straightedge constructions can be carried out using only a straightedge if a single circle and its center is given. Swiss mathematician Jakob Steiner proved this theorem in 1833, leading to the name of the theorem. The constructions that this theorem states are possible are known as Steiner constructions.

===Poncelet&#x27;s porism===
In geometry, Poncelet&#x27;s porism (sometimes referred to as Poncelet&#x27;s closure theorem) states that whenever a polygon is inscribed in one conic section and circumscribes another one, the polygon must be part of an infinite family of polygons that are all inscribed in and circumscribe the same two conics.

<doc id="764819" wikidata="Q2891869" url="?curid=764819" title="Waikīkī Aquarium">
<text>The Waikīkī Aquarium is an aquarium in Honolulu, Hawaii, United States. It was founded in 1904 and has been an institution of the University of Hawaii at Mānoa since 1919. The aquarium is the second-oldest still-operating public aquarium in the United States, after the New York Aquarium.

Built next to a living coral reef on the Waikīkī shoreline, the Waikīkī Aquarium is home to more than 3,500 organisms of 490 species of marine plants and animals. Each year, over 330,000 people visit, and over 30,000 schoolchildren participate in the aquarium&#x27;s education activities and programs. The Waikiki Aquarium was designated a Coastal Ecosystem Learning Center of the Coastal America Partnership federal program.

==Establishment==
The Waikiki Aquarium was established on March 19, 1904, by the Honolulu Rapid Transit Authority, a forerunner of the present-day TheBus. Then known as the Honolulu Aquarium, its purpose was to entice travelers to ride the trolley all the way to the end of the line at Queen Kapiolani Park. It was built on land donated by James Bicknell Castle with funds from Charles Montague Cooke and his wife Anna Rice Cooke. In 1955, the Aquarium moved to its present location, a 2.35-acre parcel of land two hundred yards south of the original site, and changed its name to Waikiki Aquarium.

The aquarium opened in 1904 with 35 tanks and 400 marine organisms, and during its first year, biologist David Starr Jordan proclaimed it as having the finest collection of fishes in the world. Considered state-of-the-art at that time, the aquarium also received positive comments from such notable visitors of that era as William Jennings Bryan and Jack London.

The Aquarium has had five directors. Frederick A. Potter, a clerk for the Honolulu Rapid Transit Company, was transferred to manage the Aquarium, becoming the first director in 1904. Despite his lack of formal training in marine sciences, Potter was a vigorous supporter of Hawaiian ichthyology, and served as director until May 1940. Potter&#x27;s Angelfish (&quot;Centropyge potteri&quot;), was named in his honor.

In 1940, Spencer Tinker was appointed the second director of the Aquarium, after serving on the faculty of the University of Hawaii Zoology Department. Tinker was well known for his books on Hawaiian fishes, Pacific crustaceans, and other marine life: his book &quot;Hawaiian Fishes&quot; remains a classic. Tinker&#x27;s Butterflyfish, &quot;Chaetodon tinkeri&quot;, was named after him. Tinker retired in 1973. 
The Hawaiian butterflyfish is named &quot;Chaetodon tinkeri&quot; in honor of Spencer Tinker, who became the aquarium&#x27;s second director in 1940.

During those early years (1919–1973) admissions to the Aquarium were deposited to the State General Fund and did not return to the Aquarium for upkeep. This lack of investment resulted in the Aquarium falling into disrepair and it was in urgent need of a new purpose and vision. In 1975, Leighton Taylor was appointed the third director. An ichthyologist by training, and an expert on sharks, Taylor understood the need for a new Aquarium vision committed to education, conservation and research, and he realized the need to diversify revenue sources. The logo, Education Department, Volunteer Program, library, research facility, gift shop, Friends of the Waikiki Aquarium support organization, the first Exhibits Master Plan (1978), and accreditation by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) all happened during his tenure. By accepting donations, memberships and grants, the Aquarium was able to fund increased services and to renovate exhibits. Taylor&#x27;s goby, &quot;Trimma taylori&quot;, is named in his honor.

In 1990, Bruce Carlson was appointed the fourth director, a post he had held in an interim capacity since the departure of Taylor in 1986. Carlson had previously worked closely with Taylor and others to design new and more naturalistic exhibits that focused on the marine life of Hawaii and the western Pacific. Carlson developed a set of clearly defined goals and strategic plans, and initiated the coral propagation program. From 1992 to 1994, Carlson oversaw the aquarium&#x27;s most extensive renovation since 1955. The $3.2 million investment from the Legislature enhanced the Aquarium&#x27;s mission of research, education and conservation through greatly improved exhibits and visitor facilities. In 2000 the Aquarium was designated a Coastal Ecosystem Learning Center of the Coastal America partnership. Four reef animals are named after him: the damselfish &quot;Paraglyphidodon carlsoni&quot;, the anthias fish &quot;Pseudanthias carlsoni&quot;, and two nudibranchs &quot;Halgerda carlsoni&quot; and &quot;Ardeadoris carlsoni&quot;.

In April 2004, Andrew Rossiter was appointed the fifth director, joining the Aquarium at the onset of its 100th anniversary celebrations. His long-term ambition at the Aquarium is to increase public awareness of the ecology and conservation of marine life and reef habitats through aquarium exhibitory, research and education. His goal is to consolidate and build upon the existing exhibitory expertise and the solid foundation laid down by his two predecessors, and to modernize, diversify and expand the aquarium&#x27;s facilities through a program of gradual renewal, renovation and replacement.

==Development and conditions==
The Waikiki Aquarium developed the first displays of living Pacific corals in the United States in 1978 using water from a seawater well and natural sunlight. A special surge device was developed later to allow culture of staghorn and table corals (Acropora spp.). Some of the corals at the Waikiki Aquarium are over 30 years old.

The Waikiki Aquarium was the second aquarium in the world, and the first in the United States, to maintain the chambered nautilus (Nouméa Aquarium was first) and the first in the world to produce viable Nautilus embryos.

Other &quot;firsts&quot; for the Waikiki Aquarium were displays of the blacktip reef sharks (&quot;Carcharhinus melanopterus&quot;) ca. 1957; broadclub cuttlefish (&quot;Sepia latimanus&quot;) in 1978; a mahimahi hatchery and exhibit (&quot;Coryphaena&quot; &quot;hippurus)&quot; in 1991; and the giant clam (&quot;Tridacna gigas&quot;) in 1979. The largest giant clam at the Waikiki Aquarium was acquired from the Micronesian Mariculture Demonstration Center in Palau in June 1982 and was estimated to be five-years old at that time. At 38 years old in 2016, it is the longest-lived giant clam in any aquarium in the world.

The Waikiki Aquarium has won national awards for its exhibits and aquatic culture methods: Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) Bean Award for Nautilus propagation (1991); AZA/Munson Conservation Award for &quot;Corals are Alive&quot; exhibition (1999); AZA/Munson Conservation Exhibit Award (2003); and the AZA Bean Award for the &quot;South Pacific Habitat&quot; exhibition (2003).

==Art==
Art at the Waikiki Aquarium includes:
*&quot;Tropical Sounds&quot; (2000), a group of abstract ceramic sculptures by Jun Kaneko
*&quot;Vita Marinae&quot;, a 1975 ceramic tile waterscape by Claude Horan

<text>Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins (8 February 1807 – 27 January 1894) was an English sculptor and natural history artist renowned for his work on the life-size models of dinosaurs in the Crystal Palace Park in south London. The models, accurately made using the latest scientific knowledge, created a sensation at the time. Hawkins was also a noted lecturer on zoological topics.

== Education and early career ==
Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins was born in Bloomsbury, London on 8 February 1807, the son of Thomas Hawkins, an artist, and Louisa Anne Waterhouse, the daughter of a Jamaica plantation family of apparent Catholic sympathies. He studied at St. Aloysius College, and learned sculpture from William Behnes. At the age of 20, he began to study natural history and later geology. He contributed illustrations to &quot;The Zoology of the Voyage of HMS Beagle&quot;.

During the 1840s, he produced studies of living animals in Knowsley Park, near Liverpool for Edward Stanley, 13th Earl of Derby. The park was one of the largest private menageries in Victorian England and Hawkins&#x27; work was later published with John Edward Gray&#x27;s text as &quot;Gleanings from the Menagerie at Knowsley&quot; . Over the same period Hawkins exhibited four sculptures at the Royal Academy between 1847 and 1849, and was elected a member of the Society of Arts in 1846 and a fellow of the Linnean Society in 1847. Fellowship of the Geological Society of London followed in 1854.

== Great Exhibition ==
Meanwhile, possibly due to Derby&#x27;s connections, Hawkins was appointed assistant superintendent of the Great Exhibition of 1851 in London. The following year, he was appointed by the Crystal Palace company to create 33 life-size concrete models of extinct dinosaurs to be placed in the south London park to which the great glass exhibition hall was to be relocated. In this work, which took some three years, he collaborated with Sir Richard Owen and other leading scientific figures of the time: Owen estimated the size and overall shape of the animals, leaving Hawkins to sculpt the models according to Owen&#x27;s directions.

A dinner was held inside the mould used to make the &quot;Iguanodon&quot;. The dinner party, hosted by Owen on 31 December 1853, garnered attention in the press. Most of the sculptures are still on display in Crystal Palace Park.

== United States ==
In 1868, he traveled to the United States to deliver a series of lectures. Working with the scientist Joseph Leidy, Hawkins designed and cast an almost complete skeleton of Hadrosaurus foulkii which was then displayed at the Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia. Supported on an iron framework in a lifelike pose, this was the world&#x27;s first mounted dinosaur skeleton.

Hawkins was later commissioned to produce models for New York City&#x27;s Central Park museum similar to these he had created in Sydenham. He established a studio on the original site of the American Museum of Natural History in Manhattan, and planned to create a Paleozoic Museum. During his ten years in America (1868–1878), Hawkins designed exhibit halls for the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., and began to create an enormous paleontological museum for New York City. The museum was to have been in Central Park. His work was all destroyed in 1871 by Henry Hilton, the corrupt and bizarre-acting Treasurer and VP of Central Park, but was for many decades thought to have been the work of Hilton&#x27;s employer, William &quot;Boss&quot; Tweed, a corrupt politician who wasn&#x27;t adequately compensated for his patronage. However, Tweed himself was fighting scandals regarding his corrupt dealings at the time, and was later proved innocent of the destruction of Hawkins&#x27; models in 2023, when the real culprit was revealed through reexamination of historical records and annual reports and minutes. Hilton&#x27;s motivations towards the vandalism are largely unknown, but may have been personal, with Hilton being purported to have told Hawkins that he &quot;should not bother with &quot;dead animals&quot;, as there was enough to do among the living&quot;, and that Hilton had little understanding or appreciation for art or nature, with several instances being recorded of him whitewashing priceless relics, statues and artifacts in bizarre acts of vandalism. Furthermore, Hilton had been placed in charge of establishing the American Museum of Natural History, and it is possible he wanted to eliminate the planned Paleozoic Museum, which he saw as competition.

Following the tragic loss of his studio through destruction of all of his dinosaur models at the hands of Hilton&#x27;s vandals, he returned to England in 1874, but almost immediately returned, doing dinosaur reconstructions at Princeton University (then called the College of New Jersey) in Princeton, New Jersey (where he also created paintings of dinosaurs). These paintings remain in the collection of the Princeton University Art Museum. Hawkins also worked at the Centennial Exhibition of 1876 in Philadelphia. He again returned to Britain in 1878.

== Family and death ==
Hawkins had married in 1826 to Mary Selina Green, and by her had several children. In 1835, he met and fell in love with artist Frances &#x27;Louisa&#x27; Keenan, and the next year he left his family and bigamously married her. He kept in touch with Mary and her children, but lived with Louisa, having two additional daughters. On his 1874 return to England, he seems to have become estranged from Louisa. He was living with his son by Mary, amidst what he described a &quot;climax of domestic troubles&quot; thought to indicate that Louisa had finally learned that their 38-year marriage had been invalid, and this may have led to his precipitous return to America in 1875. After his second return to England, he moved to West Brompton to be near his first wife, Mary, who was ill. Mary died in 1880.

In 1883, Hawkins again married Louisa, although since they were not cohabitants at the time this was probably done for legalistic reasons (to legitimize their children), and they apparently never reconciled before her death the next year. Hawkins suffered a debilitating stroke in 1889, leading to erroneous reports of his death. He died in Putney on 27 January 1894. There is a blue plaque at 22 Belvedere Road (&quot;Fossil Villa&quot;) in Upper Norwood, commemorating where he lived between 1856 and 1872.

== Legacy ==
Robert J. Sawyer&#x27;s 1994 novel &quot;End of an Era&quot; mentions the famous New Year&#x27;s Eve 1853 dinner party inside the &quot;Iguanodon&quot;, citing both Hawkins and Sir Richard Owen by name.

<text>The poiseuille (symbol Pl) has been proposed as a derived SI unit of dynamic viscosity, named after the French physicist Jean Léonard Marie Poiseuille (1797–1869).

In practice the unit has never been widely accepted and most international standards bodies do not include the poiseuille in their list of units. The third edition of the IUPAC Green Book, for example, lists Pa⋅s (pascal-second) as the SI-unit for dynamic viscosity, and does not mention the poiseuille.

The equivalent CGS unit, the poise, symbol P, is most widely used when reporting viscosity measurements.

<text>The &quot;AA-1&quot; class was a class of three experimental submarines of the United States Navy, built toward the end of World War I, between 1916 and 1920, intended to produce a high-speed fleet submarine. The design was not a success and the submarines saw only limited active service. However, the lessons learned were applied to the design of the later V-boats. The class was later renamed as the T-class.

== Design ==
In the early 1910s, only a dozen years after inaugurated the Navy&#x27;s undersea force, naval strategists had already begun to wish for submarines that could operate as long range reconnaissance vessels, in closer collaboration with the surface fleet than the Navy&#x27;s existing classes, which had been designed primarily for coastal defense. These notional &quot;fleet&quot; submarines would necessarily be larger and better armed, but primarily, they would need a surface speed of some to be able to maneuver with the 21-knot battleships the battle fleet was built around. This was the designed speed of the and later battleships, including the Standard-type battleships that were under construction and proposed in 1913.

In the summer of 1913, Electric Boat&#x27;s chief naval architect, former naval constructor Lawrence Y. Spear, proposed two preliminary fleet-boat designs for consideration in the Navy&#x27;s 1914 program. In the ensuing authorization of eight submarines, Congress specified that one should &quot;be of a seagoing type to have a surface speed of not less than twenty knots.&quot; This first fleet boat, laid down in June 1916, was named &quot;Schley&quot; after Spanish–American War hero Winfield Scott Schley. With a displacement of 1,106 tons surfaced, 1,486 tons submerged, on a length of , &quot;Schley&quot; (later &quot;AA-1&quot;, and finally &quot;T-1&quot;) was twice as large as any previous U.S. submarine. To expedite production Spear simply expanded an existing partial double hull design for a foreign customer without thickening the hull plating or strengthening the framework. This resulted in a complicated tank arrangement and a diving depth that was limited to . To achieve the required surface speed, two diesel engines arranged in tandem on each shaft drove twin screws, and a separate diesel generator was provided for charging batteries. Although &quot;Schley&quot; and two sister boats authorized in 1915 - &quot;AA-2&quot; (later &quot;T-2&quot;), and &quot;AA-3&quot; (later &quot;T-3&quot;) - initially all made their design speed of , they could only maintain that speed for short periods of time before extreme torsional vibration problems with their tandem engines forced them to slow. As the engines were clutched together, it was impossible to perfectly synchronize their operation and that resulted in an unbalanced situation. That and other circumstances resulted in poor engine reliability. 

The engineering plant included four New London Ship and Engine Company (NELSECO) 6-EB-19 four-cycle six-cylinder diesels, each in two tandem pairs, and two Electro Dynamic main electric motors, each, directly driven by the engines. Two 60-cell Exide batteries provided submerged power. One NELSECO four-cycle four-cylinder auxiliary diesel generator was included to charge batteries while the main engines were operating at high speed. From 1923 to 1927, &quot;T-3&quot; was re-engined with two German-built Maschinenfabrik Augsburg Nürnberg AG (MAN) four-cycle ten-cylinder diesels, each.

In addition to the usual four bow 18 inch (450 mm) torpedo tubes, the design incorporated two twin trainable external torpedo tubes in the deck superstructure, immediately forward and aft of the sail. These could fire on either broadside, but not dead ahead or dead astern. Two 3-inch (76 mm)/23 caliber retractable deck guns were in the original design for the submarines, but they were never installed. As with other contemporary U.S. submarine designs, the &quot;AA-1&quot; class was optimized for a high submerged speed, with a small conning tower fairwater and no bridge structure, although &quot;chariot&quot; style bridge structures were later added to all three boats. In August 1918 &quot;T-1&quot; was experimentally rearmed with a single 4-inch (102 mm)/50 caliber non-retractable gun at the expense of the forward trainable torpedo tubes, probably to test the effect of a bigger gun on submerged speed as well as provide more anti-ship firepower. Larger submarine deck guns were considered because many German U-boats were equipped with guns of up to and some were equipped with 150 mm (5.9 inch) guns. The 4 inch gun would later become standard on the S-class submarines. The trainable tubes were eliminated from the design by the time AA-2 and AA-3 were commissioned, and only AA-1 was so equipped.

== Service ==
They were based out of Hampton Roads, Virginia as part of Submarine Division 15 in the Atlantic Fleet and were used for training and maneuvers. On August 23, 1917, &quot;Schley&quot; was renamed &quot;AA-1&quot; prior to launching, to free the name for the destroyer . On July 17, 1920, the three boats were reclassified as Fleet Submarines and given the hull numbers SF-1, SF-2, and SF-3. Their names were changed from the AA-series to &quot;T-1&quot;, &quot;T-2&quot;, and &quot;T-3&quot; on September 22, 1920. AA-2 and AA-3 never carried those names during their commissioned service, having been renamed into the T-series after launching but before being accepted by the Navy.

All three boats had been decommissioned by 1923 and placed into storage at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Between 1925 and 1927, &quot;T-3&quot; was restored to service in order to test German-built diesels ( MAN engines), then returned to Philadelphia. All three were struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 19 September 1930 and sold for scrap on 20 November 1930.

<doc id="764837" wikidata="Q6792735" url="?curid=764837" title="Maureen O'Connor">
<text>Maureen O&#x27;Connor (born August 7, 1951) is an American lawyer and judge who served as the chief justice of the Ohio Supreme Court from 2011 to 2022. She was elected to the court in 2002, becoming chief justice in 2010. She was the first woman to lead the Ohio Supreme Court and the longest serving woman elected statewide in Ohio&#x27;s History.

Prior to this, O&#x27;Connor served as an associate justice of the Ohio Supreme Court and as the 61st lieutenant governor of Ohio, serving under Governor Bob Taft. She is a Republican.

==Education and experience==
O&#x27;Connor earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree at Seton Hill University, Greensburg, Pennsylvania in 1973 and a Juris Doctor degree at the Cleveland State University College of Law in 1980. In 1981, O&#x27;Connor began practicing law in Summit County, Ohio. In 1985, she was appointed a magistrate of the Summit County Probate Court. She was then elected as a judge of the Summit County Court of Common Pleas, serving on the bench from 1993 to 1995. In 1994, she was elected to the office of Summit County prosecutor and served in that office from 1995 to 1999. O&#x27;Connor received &quot;The Cleveland State University Distinguished Alumnae Award for Civic Achievement&quot; in 1997.

== Service as Ohio Lieutenant Governor ==
In 1998, O&#x27;Connor was selected by Bob Taft to be his running mate for the November election. The ticket was victorious and O&#x27;Connor was elected Ohio&#x27;s 61st lieutenant governor serving in that office from 1999 until she resigned at the end of 2002. 

== Ohio Supreme Court tenure ==
In 2002, O&#x27;Connor ran for and was elected to the Ohio Supreme Court, defeating Democrat Timothy Black. She began serving in 2003. She was reelected in 2008 with 67.14% of the vote against Democrat Joseph Russo. O&#x27;Connor defeated Chief Justice Eric Brown in the 2010 general election with 67.59% of the vote. Brown had been appointed chief justice by Gov. Ted Strickland in May 2010 after the death of Thomas J. Moyer. She is the sixth woman to have served as an Ohio Supreme Court justice and is the first woman to hold the post of chief justice.

For the 2016 election, the Democratic Party did not field a candidate to run against O&#x27;Connor.

She was described as an &quot;independent voice&quot; on the Ohio Supreme Court. She dissented on a ruling that upheld the forced closure of the last abortion clinic in Toledo, Ohio; she has expressed support for criminal justice reform; and called for less partisan influence in how judges are selected in Ohio.

In 2022, O&#x27;Connor was the deciding vote in a ruling that struck down a heavily pro-Republican gerrymandered redistricting map. She criticized how Republicans abused the redistricting process. After her vote, Ohio Republicans called for impeaching her. O&#x27;Connor retired in 2023 as she was unable to run for another term.

After her retirement, O&#x27;Connor joined the campaign of Citizens Not Politicians Ohio, which placed an unsuccessful amendment on the 2024 ballot to replace the Ohio Redistricting Commission with an independent citizens&#x27; redistricting commission.

<doc id="764848" wikidata="Q290467" url="?curid=764848" title="Autoregressive moving-average model">
<text>In the statistical analysis of time series, autoregressive–moving-average (ARMA) models are a way to describe a (weakly) stationary stochastic process using autoregression (AR) and a moving average (MA), each with a polynomial. They are a tool for understanding a series and predicting future values. AR involves regressing the variable on its own lagged (i.e., past) values. MA involves modeling the error as a linear combination of error terms occurring contemporaneously and at various times in the past. The model is usually denoted ARMA(&quot;p&quot;, &quot;q&quot;), where &quot;p&quot; is the order of AR and &quot;q&quot; is the order of MA.

The general ARMA model was described in the 1951 thesis of Peter Whittle, &quot;Hypothesis testing in time series analysis&quot;, and it was popularized in the 1970 book by George E. P. Box and Gwilym Jenkins.

ARMA models can be estimated by using the Box–Jenkins method.

== Mathematical formulation ==

=== Autoregressive model ===

The notation AR(&quot;p&quot;) refers to the autoregressive model of order &quot;p&quot;. The AR(&quot;p&quot;) model is written as

:formula_1

where formula_2 are parameters and the random variable formula_3 is white noise, usually independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) normal random variables.

In order for the model to remain stationary, the roots of its characteristic polynomial must lie outside the unit circle. For example, processes in the AR(1) model with formula_4 are not stationary because the root of formula_5 lies within the unit circle.

The augmented Dickey–Fuller test assesses the stability of IMF and trend components. For stationary time series, the ARMA model is used, while for non-stationary series, LSTM models are used to derive abstract features. The final value is obtained by reconstructing the predicted outcomes of each time series.

=== Moving average model ===

The notation MA(&quot;q&quot;) refers to the moving average model of order &quot;q&quot;:

:formula_6

where the formula_7 are the parameters of the model, formula_8 is the expectation of formula_9 (often assumed to equal 0), and formula_10, ..., formula_3 are i.i.d. white noise error terms that are commonly normal random variables.

=== ARMA model ===
The notation ARMA(&quot;p&quot;, &quot;q&quot;) refers to the model with &quot;p&quot; autoregressive terms and &quot;q&quot; moving-average terms. This model contains the AR(&quot;p&quot;) and MA(&quot;q&quot;) models,

:formula_12

=== In terms of lag operator ===
In some texts, the models is specified using the lag operator &quot;L&quot;. In these terms, the AR(&quot;p&quot;) model is given by

:formula_13

where formula_14 represents the polynomial

:formula_15

The MA(&quot;q&quot;) model is given by

:formula_16

where formula_17 represents the polynomial

:formula_18

Finally, the combined ARMA(&quot;p&quot;, &quot;q&quot;) model is given by

:formula_19

or more concisely,

:formula_20

or

:formula_21
This is the form used in Box, Jenkins &amp; Reinsel. 

Moreover, starting summations from formula_22 and setting formula_23 and formula_24, then we get an even more elegant formulation: formula_25

== Spectrum ==
The spectral density of an ARMA process isformula_26where formula_27 is the variance of the white noise, formula_17 is the characteristic polynomial of the moving average part of the ARMA model, and formula_29 is the characteristic polynomial of the autoregressive part of the ARMA model.

== Fitting models ==

===Choosing &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot;===

An appropriate value of &quot;p&quot; in the ARMA(&quot;p&quot;, &quot;q&quot;) model can be found by plotting the partial autocorrelation functions. Similarly, &quot;q&quot; can be estimated by using the autocorrelation functions. Both &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot; can be determined simultaneously using extended autocorrelation functions (EACF). Further information can be gleaned by considering the same functions for the residuals of a model fitted with an initial selection of &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot;.

Brockwell &amp; Davis recommend using Akaike information criterion (AIC) for finding &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot;. Another option is the Bayesian information criterion (BIC).

===Estimating coefficients===

After choosing &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q,&quot; ARMA models can be fitted by least squares regression to find the values of the parameters which minimize the error term. It is good practice to find the smallest values of &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot; which provide an acceptable fit to the data. For a pure AR model, the Yule-Walker equations may be used to provide a fit.

ARMA outputs are used primarily to forecast (predict), and not to infer causation as in other areas of econometrics and regression methods such as OLS and 2SLS.

=== Software implementations ===
* In R, standard package codice_1 has function codice_2, documented in ARIMA Modelling of Time Series. Package codice_3 has an improved script called codice_4 for fitting ARMA models (seasonal and nonseasonal) and codice_5 to simulate data from these models. Extension packages contain related and extended functionality: package codice_6 includes the function codice_7, documented in &quot;Fit ARMA Models to Time Series&quot;; packagecodice_8 contains codice_9 for fractionally integrated ARMA processes; and package codice_10 includes codice_11 for selecting a parsimonious set of &quot;p, q&quot;.

== History and interpretations ==
The general ARMA model was described in the 1951 thesis of Peter Whittle, who used mathematical analysis (Laurent series and Fourier analysis) and statistical inference. ARMA models were popularized by a 1970 book by George E. P. Box and Jenkins, who expounded an iterative (Box–Jenkins) method for choosing and estimating them. This method was useful for low-order polynomials (of degree three or less).

ARMA is essentially an infinite impulse response filter applied to white noise, with some additional interpretation placed on it.

In digital signal processing, ARMA is represented as a digital filter with white noise at the input and the ARMA process at the output.

== Applications ==
ARMA is appropriate when a system is a function of a series of unobserved shocks (the MA or moving average part) as well as its own behavior. For example, stock prices may be shocked by fundamental information as well as exhibiting technical trending and mean-reversion effects due to market participants.

== Generalizations ==

There are various generalizations of ARMA. Nonlinear AR (NAR), nonlinear MA (NMA) and nonlinear ARMA (NARMA) model nonlinear dependence on past values and error terms. Vector AR (VAR) and vector ARMA (VARMA) model multivariate time series. Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models non-stationary time series (that is, whose mean changes over time). Autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (ARCH) models time series where the variance changes. Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA or periodic ARMA) models periodic variation. Autoregressive fractionally integrated moving average (ARFIMA, or Fractional ARIMA, FARIMA) model time-series that exhibits long memory. Multiscale AR (MAR) is indexed by the nodes of a tree instead of integers.

=== Autoregressive–moving-average model with exogenous inputs (ARMAX) === 

The notation ARMAX(&quot;p&quot;, &quot;q&quot;, &quot;b&quot;) refers to a model with &quot;p&quot; autoregressive terms, &quot;q&quot; moving average terms and &quot;b&quot; exogenous inputs terms. The last term is a linear combination of the last &quot;b&quot; terms of a known and external time series formula_30. It is given by:

:formula_31
where formula_32 are the parameters of the exogenous input formula_30.

Some nonlinear variants of models with exogenous variables have been defined: see for example Nonlinear autoregressive exogenous model.

Statistical packages implement the ARMAX model through the use of &quot;exogenous&quot; (that is, independent) variables. Care must be taken when interpreting the output of those packages, because the estimated parameters usually (for example, in R and gretl) refer to the regression:
: formula_34
where formula_35 incorporates all exogenous (or independent) variables:
: formula_36

<doc id="764849" wikidata="Q242387" url="?curid=764849" title="Lily Pons">
<text>Alice Joséphine Pons (April 12, 1898 – February 13, 1976), known professionally as Lily Pons, was a French-American operatic lyric coloratura soprano and actress who had an active career from the late 1920s through the early 1970s. As an opera singer, she specialized in the coloratura soprano repertoire and was particularly associated with the title roles in &quot;Lakmé&quot; and &quot;Lucia di Lammermoor&quot;. In addition to appearing as a guest artist with many opera houses internationally, Pons enjoyed a long association with the Metropolitan Opera in New York City, where she performed nearly 300 times between 1931 and 1960.

She also had a successful and lucrative career as a concert singer, which continued until her retirement from performance in 1973. From 1935 to 1937, she made three musical films for RKO Pictures. She also made numerous appearances on radio and on television, performing on variety programs such as &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, &quot;The Colgate Comedy Hour&quot;, and &quot;The Dave Garroway Show&quot;. In 1955, she topped the bill for the first broadcast of what became an iconic television series, &quot;Sunday Night at the London Palladium&quot;. She made dozens of records, recording both classical and popular music. She was awarded the &quot;Croix de Lorraine&quot; and the &quot;Légion d&#x27;honneur&quot; by the government of France.

Pons was also adept at making herself into a marketable cultural icon. Her opinions on fashion and home decorating were frequently reported in women&#x27;s magazines, and she appeared as the face for Lockheed airplanes, Knox gelatin, and Libby&#x27;s tomato juice advertisements. A town in Maryland named itself after her, and thereafter the singer contrived to have all her Christmas cards posted from Lilypons, Maryland. &quot;Opera News&quot; wrote in 2011, &quot;Pons promoted herself with a kind of marketing savvy that no singer ever had shown before, and very few have since; only Luciano Pavarotti was quite so successful at exploiting the mass media.&quot;

==Early life and education==
Pons was born in Draguignan in Provence, to a French father, Léonard Louis Auguste Antoine Pons, and an Italian-born mother, Maria (née Naso), later known as Marie Pétronille Pons. She first studied piano at the Paris Conservatory, winning the first prize at the age of 15. At the onset of World War I in 1914, she moved with her mother and younger sister Juliette (born December 22, 1902 – died 1995) to Cannes, where she played piano and sang for soldiers at receptions given in support of the French troops and at the famous Hotel Carlton that had been transformed into a hospital, and where her mother worked as a volunteer nurse orderly.

In 1925, encouraged by soprano and August Mesritz, a successful publisher who agreed to fund her singing career, she started taking singing lessons in Paris with . She later studied singing with Alice Zeppilli in New York. On October 15, 1930, Pons married her first husband, Mesritz, and spent the next several years as a housewife. The marriage ended in divorce on December 7, 1933.

==Career==
Pons successfully made her operatic debut in the title role of Léo Delibes&#x27; &quot;Lakmé&quot; at Mulhouse in 1928 under Reynaldo Hahn&#x27;s baton, and went on to sing several coloratura roles in French provincial opera houses. She was discovered by the dramatic tenor/impresario Giovanni Zenatello, who took her to New York, where she auditioned for Giulio Gatti-Casazza, the general manager of the Metropolitan Opera. The Met needed a star coloratura after the retirement of Amelita Galli-Curci in January, 1930. Gatti-Casazza engaged Pons immediately, and she also signed a recording contract with RCA Victor.
On January 3, 1931, Pons, unknown in the U.S., made an unheralded Met debut as Lucia in Donizetti&#x27;s &quot;Lucia di Lammermoor&quot;, and on that occasion the spelling of her first name was changed to &quot;Lily&quot;. Her performance received tremendous acclaim. She became a star and inherited most of Galli-Curci&#x27;s important coloratura roles. Her career after this point was primarily in the United States. She became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 1940. From 1938 to 1958, she was married to conductor Andre Kostelanetz. In 1955, they built a home in Palm Springs, California.

Pons was a principal soprano at the Met for 30 years, appearing 300 times in 10 roles from 1931 until 1960. Her most frequent performances were as Lucia (93 performances), Lakmé (50 performances), Gilda in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Rigoletto&quot; (49 performances), and Rosina in Rossini&#x27;s &quot;The Barber of Seville&quot; (33 performances). She drew a record crowd of over 300,000 to Chicago&#x27;s Grant Park Music Festival in 1939 for a free concert.

In 1944, during World War II, Pons cancelled her fall and winter season in New York and instead toured with the USO, entertaining troops with her singing. Her husband Andre Kostelanetz directed a band composed of American soldiers as accompaniment to her voice. The pair performed at military bases in North Africa, Italy, the Middle East, the Persian Gulf, India, and Burma in 1944. In places, the heat of the sun at the outdoor performances was so overbearing that Pons, always wearing a strapless evening gown, held wet towels to her head between numbers.

In 1945, the tour continued through China, Belgium, France, and Germany in a performance near the front lines. Returning home, she toured the U.S., breaking attendance records in cities such as Milwaukee at which 30,000 attended her performance on July 20, 1945. That same month, she also appeared in Mexico City, conducted by Gaetano Merola.

In 1949 Pons translated into English Jean Cocteau&#x27;s screenplay and accompanying essays for &quot;The Blood of a Poet&quot;, calling his film &quot;this great piece of French visual music.&quot;

Other roles in her repertoire included Olympia in Jacques Offenbach&#x27;s &quot;The Tales of Hoffmann&quot;, Philine in Ambroise Thomas&#x27;s &quot;Mignon&quot;, Amina in Vincenzo Bellini&#x27;s &quot;La sonnambula&quot;, Marie in Donizetti&#x27;s &quot;The Daughter of the Regiment&quot;, the title role in Delibes&#x27;s &quot;Lakmé&quot;, the Queen in Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s &quot;Golden Cockerel&quot;, and the title role in Donizetti&#x27;s &quot;Linda di Chamounix&quot;, (a role she sang in the opera&#x27;s Met premiere on March 1, 1934). The last major new role Pons performed (she learned the role during her first season at the Met) was Violetta in &quot;La traviata&quot;, which she sang at the San Francisco Opera. Another role Pons learned, but decided not to sing, was Mélisande in Debussy&#x27;s opera &quot;Pelléas et Mélisande&quot;; the reason, as she confided in a later interview, was twofold: first, because she felt soprano Bidu Sayão owned the role; and secondly, because the tessitura lay mainly in the middle register of the soprano voice rather than in the higher register. In her last performance at the Met, on December 14, 1960, she sang &quot;Caro nome&quot; from &quot;Rigoletto&quot; as part of a gala performance.

She also made guest appearances at the Opéra Garnier in Paris, Royal Opera House in London, La Monnaie in Brussels, Teatro Colón in Buenos Aires, and the Chicago Opera. Her final opera appearance was as Lucia to the Edgardo of 21-year-old Plácido Domingo in 1962 at the Fort Worth Opera. On February 11, 1960, Pons appeared on NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Ford Show, Starring Tennessee Ernie Ford&quot;.

Although Pons continued to sing concerts after she retired, her greatest acclaim occurred in May 1972, when the news media announced that she would emerge from retirement to sing a concert at Lincoln Center under the baton of Andre Kostelanetz, her former husband. All tickets to the concert were sold within an hour of their availability. The program of the historic concert, which took place on Wednesday evening, May 31, 1972, did not include any of the coloratura arias which Pons sang in her prime, but did include ones more suited to her range at age 74. As she often did in earlier concerts, she included “Estrellita” among the songs in her program, and received a prolonged ovation after the concluding note.

==Radio, television, and film==
She starred in three RKO films: &quot;I Dream Too Much&quot; (1935) with Henry Fonda, &quot;That Girl from Paris&quot; (1936), and &quot;Hitting a New High&quot; (1937). She also performed an aria in the 1947 film &quot;Carnegie Hall&quot;.

==Death==

Pons died of pancreatic cancer in Dallas, Texas, at the age of 77. Her remains were brought back to her birthplace to be interred in the Cimetière du Grand Jas in Cannes. Her only direct living relative, her nephew, John de Bry (son of her sister, Juliette Pons), is an archaeologist living in Florida.

==Legacy==
A village in Frederick County, Maryland, 10 miles south of Frederick, Maryland, is called Lilypons in her honor.

George Gershwin was in the process of writing a piece of music dedicated to her when he died in 1937. The incomplete sketch was found among Gershwin&#x27;s papers after his death, and was eventually revived and completed by Michael Tilson Thomas; it was given the simple title, &quot;For Lily Pons&quot;.

Pons donated Ita, her pet ocelot, to the New York Zoological Gardens when it became too dangerous to remain in her apartment in The Ansonia on Manhattan&#x27;s Upper West Side. Pons had received the pet, which she believed was a baby jaguar, from a friend in Brazil. The pet and Pons were very attached to each other, but it snarled at visitors and was deemed a hazard.

The 1937 Merrie Melodies cartoon &quot;The Woods Are Full of Cuckoos&quot; caricatures Pons as &quot;Lily Swans&quot;.

In 1937 the Boston and Maine Railroad, at the suggestion of Wayne E. Whittemore of the Hobbs Junior High School in Medford, Massachusetts, named its locomotive 4108, a 4-8-2 Mountain type in her honor and invited her to a ceremony at North Station to dedicate 4108 and other Mountain locomotives whose names were chosen by New England schoolchildren. 

In Stephen Frears&#x27;s 2016 film &quot;Florence Foster Jenkins&quot;, Pons is played by Aida Garifullina.

There is a line of depression-era glassware, originally created in the 1930s, known as &quot;Lily Pons.&quot; It comes in several colors and takes the shape of lily pads and lily flowers.

==Recordings==

Pons left a significant legacy of recordings, on the Odeon (1928-29), RCA Victor (1930-40), and Columbia (1941-54) labels, and included excerpts from &quot;Il barbiere di Siviglia&quot;, &quot;La bohème&quot;, &quot;Brother and Sister&quot;, &quot;Les contes d&#x27;Hoffmann&quot;, &quot;Die Entführung aus dem Serail&quot;, &quot;Die Zauberflöte&quot;, &quot;Lakmé&quot;, &quot;Mireille&quot;, &quot;Le nozze di Figaro&quot;, &quot;Parysatis&quot;, &quot;Rigoletto&quot;, &quot;Alessandro&quot;, &quot;Le coq d&#x27;or&quot;, &quot;Dinorah&quot;, &quot;Floridante&quot;, &quot;Lucia di Lammermoor&quot;, &quot;Mignon&quot;, &quot;L&#x27;enfant et les sortilèges&quot;, &quot;La fille du régiment&quot;, &quot;Linda di Chamounix&quot;, &quot;La perle du Brésil&quot;, &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot;, &quot;I puritani&quot;, &quot;Il re pastore&quot;, &quot;Roméo et Juliette&quot;, &quot;La sonnambula&quot;, &quot;Le timbre d&#x27;argent&quot;, &quot;La traviata&quot;, &quot;Le toréador&quot;, &quot;Zémire et Azor&quot;, as well as songs by Julian Benedict, Henry Bishop, Claude Debussy, Henri Duparc, Gabriel Fauré, Charles Gounod, Myron Jacobson, Frank La Forge, and Darius Milhaud.

Pons also starred in complete recordings of &quot;Die Fledermaus&quot; (as Adele, 1950-51) and &quot;Lucia di Lammermoor&quot; (1954).

<text>Tales to Astonish is the name of two American comic book series, and a one-shot comic, all published by Marvel Comics.

The primary title bearing that name was published from January 1959 to March 1968. It began as a science-fiction anthology that served as a showcase for such artists as Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko, then featured superheroes during the period fans and historians call the Silver Age of Comic Books. It became &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; with issue No. 102 (April 1968). Its sister title was &quot;Tales of Suspense&quot;.

A second Marvel comic bearing the name, reprinting stories of the undersea ruler the Sub-Mariner, ran 14 issues from December 1979 to January 1981. A superhero one-shot followed in 1994.

==Publication history==

===Science-fiction anthology===
&quot;Tales to Astonish&quot; and its sister publication &quot;Tales of Suspense&quot; were both launched with a January 1959 cover date.
The early run of the first volume of &quot;Tales to Astonish&quot; ran from issues #1–34 (January 1959 – August 1962), initially under Atlas Comics, the 1950s forerunner of Marvel; it fell under the Marvel banner with issue No. 21 (July 1961), the first with a cover sporting the early &quot;MC&quot; box. It contained science-fiction mystery/suspense stories written primarily by editor-in-chief Stan Lee and his brother, Larry Lieber, with artists including Jack Kirby, Steve Ditko, Dick Ayers, Don Heck and Paul Reinman. One such story, &quot;The Man in the Ant Hill&quot;, in No. 27 (January 1962), introduced the character Hank Pym, who would be repurposed eight issues later as the superhero Ant-Man. Anthology stories continued to appear as backups until &quot;Tales to Astonish&quot; became a superhero &quot;split book&quot; in 1964, when it began featuring one story each of Giant-Man and the Hulk.

===Ant-Man, Giant-Man and the Wasp===

Following his one-shot story in No. 27 (January 1962), Hank Pym became the insect-sized hero Ant-Man in No. 35 (September 1962). The series was plotted by Lee and scripted by Lieber, with penciling first by Kirby and later by Heck and others. The Wasp was introduced as Ant-Man&#x27;s costar in issue No. 44 (June 1963). Ant-Man and Pym&#x27;s subsequent iteration, Giant-Man, introduced in No. 49 (November 1963), starred in 10- to 13-page and later 18-page adventures, with the rest of &quot;Tales to Astonish&quot; devoted to the anthological science fiction and fantasy stories the comic normally ran. Aside from Lee and Lieber, occasional writers included Ernie Hart, under the pseudonym H. E. Huntley, Leon Lazarus (#64, February 1965) and Al Hartley (#69, the feature&#x27;s finale, July 1965). Artists of the latter part of the run included Ditko, Ayers, Carl Burgos, and Bob Powell.

The backup feature &quot;Tales of the Wasp&quot; (#51–56) used the superheroine as a framing device for anthological science-fiction stories, having her relate tales to hospitalized servicemen and the like. The Wasp also starred in two subsequent solo backup stories. All were scripted and penciled by Lieber.

===Hulk and Sub-Mariner===
The Hulk, whose original series &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; had been canceled after a six-issue run in 1962–63, returned to star in his own feature when &quot;Tales to Astonish&quot; became a split book at issue No. 60 (October 1964), after having guest-starred as Giant-Man&#x27;s antagonist in a full-length story the previous issue. The Hulk had proven a popular guest-star in three issues of &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; and an issue of &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot;. His new stories here were initially scripted by Lee and illustrated by the seldom-seen team of penciler Steve Ditko and inker George Roussos. This early part of the Hulk&#x27;s run introduced the Leader, who would become the Hulk&#x27;s nemesis, and this run additionally made the Hulk&#x27;s identity known, initially only to the military and then later publicly. The Abomination first appeared in &quot;Tales to Astonish&quot; No. 90, and is introduced as a KGB agent and spy. Stan Lee chose the name &quot;the Abomination,&quot; which he realized belonged to no other character, before conceiving the character&#x27;s background and appearance. Lee recalled that he simply told artist Gil Kane to &quot;make him bigger and stronger than the Hulk and we&#x27;ll have a lot of fun with him.&quot;

Namor the Sub-Mariner received his first feature in a decade beginning with No. 70 (August 1965). The Golden Age character Byrrah was reintroduced in issue No. 90 (April 1967). After the final issue of &quot;Tales to Astonish&quot; (which became the solo magazine &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; with issue No. 102, April 1968), Namor co-starred in the split-book one-shot &quot;Iron Man and Sub-Mariner&quot; No. 1 before going on to his own 72-issue series.

Giant-Man and Wasp were featured prominently in Namor stories in issues #77-78, steering their return to the Avengers in #26 of that series. Stan Lee had originally removed all Avengers with their own series/serials from the team ten issues earlier to make continuity easier to maintain. Wasp had been at a cruise ship swimming pool when she went to alert the Avengers of Namor&#x27;s activities in #77, explaining why she was dressed for swimming in &quot;The Avengers&quot; #26.

==Revivals==
A second volume of &quot;Tales to Astonish&quot;, using the cover logo &quot;Tales to Astonish starring the Sub-Mariner&quot;, ran 14 issues (December 1979 – January 1981), reprinting edited versions of &quot;Sub-Mariner&quot; #1–14 (May 1968 – June 1969). All but the last issue ran 18-page versions of the originally 20-page stories, with panels and text reworked to condense the plot. That last issue also included three Namor pinups, one by creator Bill Everett, reprinted from &quot;Marvel Mystery Comics&quot; No. 9 (July 1940); one by penciler Jack Kirby and inker Sol Brodsky, reprinted from &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; No. 33 (December 1964); and a new one by artist Alan Weiss. Covers repurposed the original art, with the premiere issue&#x27;s image flipped 180 degrees.

&quot;Tales to Astonish&quot; vol. 3 No. 1 (December 1994) was a 72-page one-shot special starring the Hulk, Namor, Ant-Man, and the Wasp in the story &quot;Loki&#x27;s Dream&quot; by writer Peter David, with painted art by John Estes.

<text>Rosa Ponzillo, known as Rosa Ponselle (January 22, 1897 – May 25, 1981) was an American operatic dramatic soprano.

She sang mainly at the New York Metropolitan Opera and is generally considered to have been one of the greatest sopranos of the 20th century.

==Early life==

She was born Rosa Ponzillo on January 22, 1897, in Meriden, Connecticut, the youngest of three children. The family lived on the city&#x27;s west side in a neighbourhood chiefly populated by immigrants from the south of Italy, first at the corner of Lewis Avenue and Bartlett Street, then on Foster Street, where Ponselle was born, moving when she was three to Springdale Avenue. Her parents were Italian immigrants from Caiazzo, near Caserta. Ponselle had an exceptionally mature voice at an early age and, at least in her early years, sang on natural endowment with little, if any, vocal training. Instead, her early prowess as a piano student (which was cultivated by a local music teacher, Anna Ryan, the organist of a nearby Catholic church), seemed to incline Rosa to instrumental rather than vocal music. But with the influence and example of her older sister, Carmela, who was then pursuing a career as a cabaret singer, Rosa began to augment her engagements as a silent-movie accompanist in and around Meriden by singing popular ballads to her audiences while the projectionist changed film reels. By 1914, her reputation as a singer led to a long-term engagement at the San Carlino theater, one of the largest movie houses in New Haven, near the Yale campus.

==Vaudeville==
By then, Carmela was already an established singer in vaudeville after her debut in &quot;The Girl from Brighton&quot;, a 1912 Broadway musical. Three years later, in 1915, Carmela brought Rosa to audition for her vaudeville agent. In spite of being markedly overweight (a stark contrast to the fashion-model physique of her older sister), Rosa impressed with her voice, and she was hired to perform with Carmela as a &quot;sister act&quot;. Between 1915 and 1918, the Ponzillo Sisters (also known as &quot;Those Tailored Italian Girls&quot;) became a headlining act on the Keith Vaudeville Circuit, appearing in all the major Keith theaters and earning a substantial income in the process. The sisters&#x27; act consisted of traditional ballads, popular Italian songs, and operatic arias and duets.

In 1918, Carmela and Rosa demanded a substantial fee increase from the Keith Vaudeville Circuit, as a result of which their act was dropped. At the time, Carmela was studying in New York with a well-connected voice teacher/agent named William Thorner. Thorner auditioned Rosa, and agreed to give her lessons. (Rosa later denied that Thorner had ever given her voice lessons, but her statements on the subject are contradictory.) Although initially less impressed with Rosa&#x27;s future prospects than with Carmela&#x27;s, Thorner changed his opinion after the legendary baritone Victor Maurel, whom Giuseppe Verdi had chosen to create Iago in &quot;Otello&quot;, auditioned both sisters at his friend Thorner&#x27;s request. Soon afterward, Thorner persuaded the great tenor Enrico Caruso, star of the Metropolitan Opera, to visit his studio to hear Carmela and Rosa sing. Caruso was usually wary when asked to listen to amateur singers, but was deeply impressed with Rosa&#x27;s voice. He arranged an audition for Rosa attended by the Met&#x27;s general manager, Giulio Gatti-Casazza. Gatti was equally impressed with Rosa&#x27;s singing and offered her a contract for the Met&#x27;s 1918/1919 season.

==Metropolitan Opera debut and early operatic career==
Rosa Ponselle made her debut at the Metropolitan Opera on November 15, 1918, just a few days after World War I had ended, as Leonora in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;La forza del destino&quot;, opposite Caruso and Giuseppe De Luca. It was her first performance on any opera stage. She was quite intimidated for being in the presence of Caruso, and in spite of an almost paralyzing case of nervousness (which she suffered from throughout her operatic career), she scored a tremendous success, both with the public and with the critics. &quot;New York Times&quot; critic James Huneker wrote: &quot;...what a promising debut! Added to her personal attractiveness, she possesses a voice of natural beauty that may prove a gold mine; it is vocal gold, anyhow, with its luscious lower and middle tones, dark, rich and ductile, brilliant in the upper register.&quot;

In addition to Leonora, Ponselle&#x27;s roles in the 1918/19 season included Santuzza in &quot;Cavalleria rusticana&quot;, Reiza in Weber&#x27;s &quot;Oberon&quot;, and Carmelita in the (unsuccessful) world premiere of Joseph Carl Breil&#x27;s &quot;The Legend&quot;.

In the following Met seasons, Ponselle&#x27;s roles included the lead soprano roles in &quot;La Juive&quot; (opposite Caruso&#x27;s Eléazar, his final new role before his death in 1921), &quot;William Tell&quot;, &quot;Ernani&quot;, &quot;Il trovatore&quot;, &quot;Aida&quot;, &quot;La Gioconda&quot;, &quot;Don Carlos&quot;, &quot;L&#x27;Africaine&quot;, &quot;L&#x27;amore dei tre re&quot;, &quot;Andrea Chénier&quot;, &quot;La vestale&quot;, and the role that many considered her greatest achievement, Bellini&#x27;s &quot;Norma&quot;, in the Met&#x27;s historic 1927 revival. In addition to her operatic activities, which were centered at the Met, Ponselle had a lucrative concert career. A tour of the West coast included an appearance at the Lobero Theatre in Santa Barbara on March 14, 1927 in the Artist Series of the Community Arts Association&#x27;s Music Branch, accompanied by pianist Stuart Ross. As her career progressed, Ponselle negotiated through her manager more concerts and exponentially higher fees before and after each Metropolitan Opera season.
==Appearances abroad and later operatic career==

Outside the US, Ponselle sang only at Covent Garden in London (for three seasons) and in Italy (in order, so she said, to honor a promise she had made to her mother that she would one day sing in Italy). In 1929, Ponselle made her European debut in London, at the Royal Opera House at Covent Garden. Up until that time, her career had been concentrated entirely in America. Ponselle sang two roles at Covent Garden in 1929: &quot;Norma&quot; and &quot;Gioconda&quot;. She had great success and was tumultuously acclaimed by the normally staid London audiences. She returned to London in 1930 in &quot;Norma&quot;, &quot;L&#x27;amore dei tre re&quot;, and &quot;La traviata&quot; (her first performances as Violetta). In her final London season in 1931, she sang in &quot;La forza del destino&quot;, &quot;Fedra&quot; (an opera by her coach and long-time friend, Romano Romani), and a reprise of &quot;La traviata&quot;.
In 1933 Ponselle sang her only performances in Italy, as Giulia in &quot;La vestale&quot;, with the Maggio Musicale in Florence. As in London, the audiences were wildly enthusiastic. At the second performance, Ponselle had to encore the aria, &quot;O nume tutelar&quot;. Her success was such that she considered an engagement at Milan&#x27;s La Scala, but after witnessing a Florence audience&#x27;s brutal treatment of a famous tenor, Giacomo Lauri-Volpi, who cracked on a high note, she decided not to press her luck further with the notoriously difficult Italian opera-going public. Other than her appearances in London and Florence, Ponselle never sang outside the United States.

Ponselle continued in the 1930s to add roles to her repertoire at the Metropolitan Opera. In 1930 she sang her first New York appearances in 1931 as Violetta, a role she had sung with such success in London but which received a more mixed reception from the New York critics, some of whom found her interpretation too forceful and dramatic. &quot;The eminent soprano endeavored to make every number passionately emotional by … spasmodic utterances,&quot; wrote critic W.J. Henderson. &quot;Her attempt at transforming Verdi&#x27;s plaintively pathetic conception into hard-breathing tragedy was most unfortunate.&quot; In 1931 she sang in another unsuccessful world premiere, Montemezzi&#x27;s &quot;La notte di Zoraima&quot;, which sank without a trace. Like many other opera singers of that time, she made a brief trip to Hollywood and made screen tests for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Paramount Pictures, but nothing came of them.
In 1935, Ponselle sang her first Carmen at the Met. In spite of a great popular success with the role, for which she had prepared meticulously, Ponselle received a drubbing from most of the New York critics, especially Olin Downes in the New York Times, whose savagely caustic review (&quot;We have never heard Miss Ponselle sing so badly, and we have seldom seen the part enacted in such an artificial and unconvincing manner&quot;) hurt Ponselle deeply. The only roles Ponselle sang during her last two seasons at the Met were Santuzza and Carmen, roles that did not tax her upper register. Differences with the Met management regarding repertoire led her not to renew her contract with the company for the 1937/38 season. Her last operatic performance was as Carmen on April 22, 1937, in a Met tour performance in Cleveland.

==Retirement==

Ponselle did not consciously or purposely retire after that Cleveland &quot;Carmen&quot; in 1937; rather, it was an organic process of relinquishment in response to a range of factors. These included, amongst others, her receding upper vocal range which intensified her nerves; her dissatisfaction with the Metropolitan Opera House&#x27;s refusal to accede her proposed musical repertoire (she had expressed a desire to sing Cilea&#x27;s &quot;Adriana Lecouvreur&quot;, which had an appropriately low tessitura, but general manager Edward Johnson blocked any revival due to the opera&#x27;s poor financial returns during its 1907-1908 season at the Met, despite the presence of Caruso in the cast); mental and physical performance exhaustion from the strain of 21 intensive years of continuous performances and rising levels of performance-related anxiety; her marriage in 1936 to Carle A. Jackson, the socialite son of the then-mayor of Baltimore; and her enjoyment of the life she now led without the demands of performing. To mark her transition, Ponselle and Jackson constructed a luxurious villa in Maryland&#x27;s Green Spring Valley, called &quot;Villa Pace&quot;, where she resided for the remainder of her life.

In 1949, Ponselle&#x27;s marriage to Jackson ended in divorce. The breakup was traumatic for Ponselle, and she suffered a nervous breakdown. Although she never again appeared on the concert or opera stage, Ponselle continued to sing at home for friends, who reported that her voice was as magnificent as ever. This was further demonstrated in 1954, when RCA Victor came to Villa Pace and recorded Ponselle singing a wide variety of songs. In the late 1940s, Ponselle became the mentor of the fledgling Baltimore Civic Opera Company, providing coaching and voice lessons for the young singers who appeared with the company. Among those to have received her tutelage during their Baltimore Civic Opera appearances, at the start of their careers, were Beverly Sills, Sherrill Milnes, Plácido Domingo, James Morris, Lili Chookasian, Joshua Hecht, and Martha King.

==Death==
Ponselle died at her estate, Villa Pace near Baltimore, on May 25, 1981, aged 84, after a long battle with bone marrow cancer. She is buried in nearby Druid Ridge Cemetery. In her obituary, Allen Hughes wrote in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Miss Ponselle made an indelible impression through the impact of her phenomenal voice. It was a dramatic soprano that seemed to move seamlessly from the low notes of a contralto to a dazzling high C. She had coloratura flexibility, a splendid trill, powerful fortes, delicate pianissimos and precise intonation.&quot; Hughes quotes Harold C. Schonberg who wrote in 1972, &quot;That big, pure colorful golden voice would rise effortlessly, hitting the stunned listener in the face, rolling over the body, sliding down the shoulder-blades, making one wiggle with sheer physiological pleasure.&quot;

==Recordings==

Martin Bernheimer, writing in &quot;The New Grove Dictionary of Opera&quot;, had this to say about Ponselle&#x27;s voice and recordings: 

Ponselle&#x27;s voice is generally regarded as one of the most beautiful of the century. She was universally lauded for opulence of tone, evenness of scale, breadth of range, perfection of technique and communicative warmth. Many of these attributes are convincingly documented on recordings. In 1954 she made a few private song recordings, later released commercially, revealing a still opulent voice of darkened timbre and more limited range.
Ponselle&#x27;s recording career began with the acoustic horn, continued with electric recording, and ended on magnetic tape. Over her career, she made 166 commercial recordings (not including alternate takes), either in the studio or at Villa Pace. These are supplemented by live recordings from the 1930s, which include three complete operas and numerous songs and arias from her appearances on radio. Additionally, there are numerous &quot;private&quot; recordings made by Ponselle herself and others at the Villa Pace, from 1949 through the late 1970s.

===Columbia recordings===
Shortly before her Metropolitan Opera debut in 1918, Ponselle signed a 5-year contract with the Columbia Graphophone Company. Although Victor was the much more prestigious label, and the one for which Caruso recorded, Ponselle was advised by William Thorner and his assistant and accompanist, Romano Romani, to sign a contract with Columbia because she would become the company&#x27;s leading soprano and not just one in a stable of great singers at Victor. Romani, a young composer whose opera &quot;Fedra&quot; had earned favorable attention in Italy, was conducting recording sessions for Columbia at the time. Under his baton, Ponselle made 44 discs for Columbia, including arias from many operas in which she never sang, such as &quot;Lohengrin&quot;, &quot;Tosca&quot;, &quot;La bohème&quot;, &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot;, and &quot;I vespri siciliani&quot;. All her Columbia discs were acoustical recordings. Her 1923 Columbia recording of &quot;Selva opaca&quot; from &quot;William Tell&quot; was her personal favorite among all her acoustic recordings, because she felt that it was the most accurate representation of her voice and style at the time. Of particular interest among the Columbia discs are three duets she made with Carmela of some of their vaudeville hits, including a version of &quot;Comin&#x27; Thro&#x27; the Rye&quot; that features an elaborate coloratura cadenza that would not be out of place in Bellini&#x27;s &quot;Norma&quot; but sounds a bit strange in the Scottish Highlands. One of Ponselle&#x27;s regrets about signing with Columbia was that it deprived her of the opportunity to record with Caruso, who was an exclusive Victor artist.

===Victor recordings===
Ponselle&#x27;s contract with Columbia Records expired in 1923, and she immediately signed with the Victor Talking Machine Company. Her recordings from 1923 until mid-1925 are all acoustics; Victor began electrical recording in March 1925. Among her electrical Victor records, Ponselle&#x27;s most admired titles include &quot;Pace, pace mio Dio&quot;, &quot;Suicidio!&quot;, &quot;Casta diva&quot;, and the two arias from &quot;La vestale.&quot; She also recorded several ensembles, including the complete Tomb Scene from &quot;Aida&quot; with Giovanni Martinelli, &quot;Mira, o Norma&quot; with Marion Telva, the Adalgisa of her first Normas in 1927, and a trio from &quot;La forza del destino&quot; with Martinelli and Ezio Pinza. Ponselle made no studio recordings after 1939. In 1954 RCA Victor, unable to persuade Ponselle to return to the recording studio, took its recording equipment to the Villa Pace and set up a microphone in the foyer. Ponselle, with piano accompaniment by conductor Igor Chichagov, recorded alternate versions of 53 songs, many of which were released on two LP discs, &quot;Rosa Ponselle Sings Today&quot; and &quot;Rosa Ponselle in Song&quot;. They show that Ponselle&#x27;s voice was in magnificent condition even at age 57, with extraordinary richness and depth. &quot;Not only in the richness of the sound and the trueness of the emotion,&quot; critic Irving Kolodin wrote of the first RCA Victor LP, &quot;but in the admirable discipline of what she has undertaken, the best in these performances of October 1954 mark the Ponselle of today as an artist to be reckoned with the fine singers of 1955.&quot;

===Live recordings===
During the 1930s, Ponselle sang often on the radio and she generally had her broadcasts recorded on 78 rpm Acetate discs. Many of these have been released since on LP and CD. There are five complete opera performances from the Metropolitan Opera radio broadcasts: &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; (1934), &quot;La traviata&quot; (1935), and three performances of &quot;Carmen&quot; (March 28, 1936 Boston, January 9, 1937 New York and April 17, 1937 Cleveland). The April 1937 &quot;Carmen&quot; is the Cleveland tour performance that was Ponselle&#x27;s farewell to the operatic stage. The &quot;Traviata&quot; and &quot;Carmen&quot; performances are in good sound (for a mid-30s radio broadcast transcription); the &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; is in very poor sound. Ponselle&#x27;s live recordings also include many songs and arias from her radio concerts. Finally, there are private recordings made at the Villa Pace of Ponselle singing various songs and arias accompanying herself on the piano, some of which she never recorded elsewhere. There is a particularly moving and very freely rendered performance of the aria &quot;Senza mamma&quot; from &quot;Suor Angelica.

<text>The Stockholm Concert Hall () is the main hall for orchestral music in Stockholm, Sweden.

With a design by Ivar Tengbom chosen in competition, inaugurated in 1926, the Hall is home to the Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra. It is also where the awarding ceremonies for the Nobel Prize and the Polar Music Prize are held annually. The interior includes work by Ewald Dahlskog, and the walls and ceiling in the minor hall, now known as Grünewald Hall, were painted by Isaac Grünewald. The exterior is the site of sculptor Carl Milles&#x27; 1936 bronze fountain, the Orfeus-brunnen (&quot;the Orpheus Well&quot;).

The blue building lies to the east of Hötorget.

Many pop and rock concerts by famous artists have taken place at the Stockholm Concert Hall.

Construction of the concert hall was funded in part by a testamentary donation from Rosa Nachmanson.

<text>Ernest Cook Poole (January 23, 1880 – January 10, 1950) was an American journalist, novelist, and playwright. Poole is best remembered for his sympathetic first-hand reportage of revolutionary Russia during and immediately after the Revolution of 1905 and Revolution of 1917 and as a popular writer of proletarian-tinged fiction during the era of World War I and the 1920s.

Poole was the winner of the first Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, awarded in 1918 for his book, &quot;His Family.&quot;

==Biography==

===Early years===

Poole was born in Chicago, Illinois, on January 23, 1880, to Abram Poole and Mary Howe Poole. His Wisconsin-born father was a successful commodities trader at the Chicago Board of Trade, his mother hailed from a well-established Chicago family; together they raised 7 children.

Poole was educated at home until he was almost 7 years old, at which time he was enrolled in Chicago&#x27;s University School for Boys. There he first showed a proclivity for the written word, working briefly on the staff of the school newspaper. His was a privileged youth, spending summers at the family&#x27;s seasonal home at Lake Forest, on the shores of Lake Michigan. The family&#x27;s Michigan Avenue home in Chicago was populated with servants, including gardeners and governesses, and he grew up in proximity of the scions of the city elite, including young relatives of Cyrus McCormick and Abraham Lincoln.

Following high school graduation, Poole, an accomplished violinist, took a year off to study music, with a view to becoming a professional composer. He found the process of writing music difficult, however, and — inspired by his literary-oriented and story-telling father — turned his attention to the written word as a possible profession.

After his year-long escape from formal education, Poole moved to Princeton, New Jersey, to attend Princeton University, where he attended courses in political science taught by Woodrow Wilson. There he continued to demonstrate an interest in journalism and fiction writing, working on the staff of the school&#x27;s daily newspaper, &quot;The Prince&quot; — before finding straight journalism tedious. He moved from nuts-and-bolts journalism to the arts, contributing material to the campus literary magazine, &quot;The Lit,&quot; and penning two librettos for the illustrious Princeton Triangle Club, although both were rejected.

It was at Princeton that Poole was influenced to the ideas of progressive reform associated with the burgeoning muckraker movement, with the book &quot;How The Other Half Lives&quot; by Jacob Riis playing a particularly pivotal role in the evolution of Poole&#x27;s worldview. He also read translations of Russian classics by Leo Tolstoy and Ivan Turgenev, which deeply impressed Poole for their realistic style and aroused what would become a lifelong interest in him in the authors&#x27; native land.

===Settlement worker===
Poole graduated from Princeton &quot;cum laude&quot; in 1902 and immediately moved to New York City to live in the University Settlement House on the city&#x27;s impoverished Lower East Side. During his stint as a settlement worker, Poole gained the notice of editors at &quot;McClure&#x27;s Magazine&quot; for an article he wrote on the social situation in New York&#x27;s Chinatown district and authored a report for the New York Child Labor Committee on the continuing child labor problem.

Pushed by the Child Labor Committee to seek publicity by rewriting some of his lurid anecdotes of the life of street urchins, Poole wrote an article that early in 1903 found its way into the fledgling muckraking magazine, &quot;McClure&#x27;s.&quot; Payment for the freelance effort was received and confidence boosted. The next phase of Poole&#x27;s life, that of a professional writer, had begun.

Headstrong and confident, Poole immersed himself in his passion, fiction, while still ensconced as a settlement worker. Three short stories were immediately penned and sent out to various New York magazines — only to be returned with letters of rejection. Poole retreated to writing short works of investigative journalism on the boys of the city streets and met with better success, seeing print for one piece in &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; and two others in the &quot;New York Evening Post.&quot;

Poole&#x27;s settlement house was active teaching classes and housing club groups during the day. In the evenings it hosted a steady stream of guests, including some of the most famous progressive activists of the day, including social worker Jane Addams, journalist Lincoln Steffens, British author H. G. Wells and left wing politicians Keir Hardie and Ramsay MacDonald, as well as renowned attorney Clarence Darrow. Acquaintances were made and ideas absorbed by Poole, who increased in commitment to attempt to the wrongs of society through intelligent social reform.

Anxious to learn more about the people of the crowded Lower East Side milieu in which he lived, Poole set about learning Yiddish, eavesdropping on conversations and jotting down fragments of the dialog he heard for future use in his imaginative writing. He met and made friends with Abraham Cahan, publisher of the Yiddish-language &quot;Jewish Daily Forward&quot; &quot;(Der Forverts)&quot; and gained an appreciation from the venerable revolutionary of the struggle being waged by oppressed Jews and others against the Tsarist autocracy in Russia.

The tipping point for the 23-year old Poole as a settlement worker came when he was selected to investigate the problem of tuberculosis in New York City&#x27;s Lower East Side tenement slums. Poole spent weeks going from room to room observing and surveying residents and taking testimony about the fate of previous inhabitants. His report, &quot;The Plague in Its Stronghold,&quot; generated attention from the press and Poole conducted tours of reporters and photographers around the tenement blocks, with the coverage spurring hearings of the New York State Legislature in Albany. The task proved a strain on Poole&#x27;s mental and physical well-being and he himself became feverish and was sent home to the family summer home in Lake Forest to recuperate.

===Magazine correspondent===
Poole&#x27;s time as a settlement worker at an end, he threw himself into investigative journalism. In 1904 the popular illustrated news weekly &quot;The Outlook&quot; dispatched Poole to live for six weeks in the packinghouse district of Chicago to report on the ongoing stockyards&#x27; strike, which prominently featured a melange of striking new immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe against thousands of African-American strikebreakers brought for the purpose to the city.

When his &quot;Outlook&quot; piece was completed, Poole stayed on the scene as the volunteer press agent for the union of the striking slaughterhouse workers. The job put him in touch with the young Upton Sinclair, who was on the scene to do research for what he hoped would become the &quot;&quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot; of the Labor Movement,&quot; published in 1906 as &quot;The Jungle.&quot; Poole&#x27;s close friends in New York included two others who would travel to Imperial Russia as correspondents in 1905 — the socialists Arthur Bullard and William English Walling.

Back in New York, Poole met the émigré Russian revolutionary Yekaterina Breshkovskaya, the so-called &quot;Little Grandmother of the Revolution.&quot; Together with an interpreter and a stenographer, Poole sat for eight hours listening to Breshkovskaya&#x27;s personal story and the history of the revolutionary movement fighting for the overthrow of the Romanov dynasty of Imperial Russia. Poole&#x27;s interview would ultimately result in a pamphlet issued by the Chicago socialist publishing house Charles H. Kerr &amp; Co., &quot;For Russia&#x27;s Freedom.&quot;

Fascinated by the tumultuous Russian political situation, Poole successfully convinced &quot;The Outlook&quot; to send him to Russia as the magazine&#x27;s correspondent and a contract was drawn up. Poole sailed for England, then proceeded to France before traveling by train to Berlin and on to Russia, bringing with him communications and money entrusted to him in Paris for underground Russian constitutionalists. Together with a translator, Poole traveled Russia extensively in the early days of the 1905 Revolution, ultimately turning in 14 pieces to &quot;The Outlook&quot; detailing his experiences and observations.

After his return from Russia, Poole continued to produce feature short stories depicting urban working class life for the periodical press, all the while gathering anecdotes for future novels. Poole split his output between &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; and &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Magazine,&quot; as a successful freelance writer.

Poole married the former Margaret Ann Witherbotham in 1907 and the couple established a household in the Greenwich Village section of New York City. The couple would raise three children.

For several years after his marriage, Poole found himself to writing of plays for the stage, an offshoot of the writing profession that pitted low probability of success against potentially immense financial rewards if a piece was successfully staged. His first effort, revolving around life in a steel mill, failed to find a producer but his second, a drama about the construction of a bridge in the Rocky Mountains, led to six weeks of rehearsals and a grand New York opening — followed by poor reviews and a quick close.

Poole would ultimately write 11 plays for the New York stage, two of these in conjunction with Harriet Ford. A total of three of Poole&#x27;s efforts would be staged, with the two successful dramas running for 6 weeks and 3 months, respectively. His urge to write for the stage whetted, Poole would return to more secure forms of writing.

===Political activism===
Poole was slow to join the growing Socialist Party of America (SPA), initially resisting joining because, as he later recalled, he had &quot;got free from one church and I didn&#x27;t propose to get into this other and write propaganda all my life, instead of the truth as I saw it and felt it.&quot; Around 1908 he made the acquaintance of party leader Morris Hillquit, however, who became a &quot;lovable friend&quot; and persuaded the non-Marxist Poole that his views fell within the &quot;very broad and liberal&quot; ideological umbrella of the Socialist Party. Poole joined a branch of Local New York and maintained his red card in the organization at least through the years of World War I.

From 1908 Poole began writing for the &quot;New York Call,&quot; a socialist daily closely associated with the Socialist Party of America (SPA). Poole was also among those left wing intellectuals who helped to found the Intercollegiate Socialist Society (ISS), joining in the task with his friends Arthur Bullard and Charles Edward Russell.

===Novelist===

Leaving the world of the stage, Poole began to concentrate on full length fiction. In the spring of 1912 he began research on the waterfront environs of Brooklyn Heights, New York, gathering observations and anecdotes that he would painstakingly work into shape for the first of his major novels, &quot;The Harbor,&quot; which was accepted by Macmillan in the spring of 1914. Physically and emotionally drained by the writing process, Poole spent two months in Europe before returning to the family&#x27;s new home in the White Mountains of New Hampshire to begin work on his next book.

This idyllic interlude was shattered in the summer of 1914 when World War I erupted across Europe. The world situation so dramatically changed, Poole recovered the manuscript for his book from Macmillans and spent a month writing a completely new ending. Drawn to cover the conflict as a war correspondent as if a moth to a flame, Poole belatedly attempted to make use of his contacts with the publishers of various magazines, but found that all the positions for correspondents in France and England had been filled. He was ultimately able, however, to persuade &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; to send him to the German capital of Berlin to cover the war from the opposite camp, and early in November 1914 he sailed aboard a British ship for Europe.

In Germany, joining other western war correspondents such as Jack Reed he viewed German hospitals, troop trains, and saw the front from the German side. He would spend three months in Europe covering the conflict.

Finally published in 1915, Poole&#x27;s &quot;The Harbor&quot; was well received by critics and the reading public and his place in the American literary scene was thereby firmly established. He followed the book up with a new novel in 1917 dealing with intergenerational conflict, &quot;His Family.&quot; This book was also warmly regarded, resulting in Poole being awarded the first Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1918, an award which at least one 21st Century literary critic has argued was awarded to Poole as much for his previous effort, &quot;The Harbor.&quot;

Poole&#x27;s next novel attempted to follow up the successful &quot;His Family&quot; with a sequel, &quot;His Second Wife,&quot; published in serial form in &quot;McClure&#x27;s&quot; before being released in hard covers later in 1918. This book proved distinctly less successful than his previous literary efforts with critics and the reading public, however, and Poole&#x27;s fiction never achieved such acclaim again.

From 1920 until 1934, Poole produced works of fiction for Macmillan at the rate of approximately one a year. While none of these attained the critical acclaim of Poole&#x27;s wartime writings, the 1927 book &quot;Silent Storms&quot; was met with some degree of public success.

===Interpreter of the Bolshevik Revolution===

In 1917 &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; dispatched Poole to Russia to report on the Russian Revolution, where he joined other sympathetic American commentators such as John &quot;Jack&quot; Reed and Louise Bryant. His journalism on the rapidly changing world in Russia was closely read by a curious public, and the articles subsequently provided the raw material for two works of non-fiction, &quot;&quot;The Dark People&quot;: Russia&#x27;s Crisis&quot; and &quot;The Village: Russian Impressions,&quot; both of which were published in book form by Macmillan in 1918.

===Later years===

After the war, Poole, Paul Kennaday, and Arthur Livingston initiated an agency, the Foreign Press Service, that negotiated for foreign authors with English-language publishers.

After a six year hiatus with Macmillan, Poole published his memoirs, &quot;The Bridge: My Own Story,&quot; in 1940. He returned to writing books during the final decade of his life, publishing one work of non-fiction on famous figures in Chicago history and two lesser novels.

===Death and legacy===

Poole died of pneumonia in New York City on Tuesday, January 10, 1950, thirteen days away from his 70th birthday.

<text>Friedrich Reinhold Kreutzwald ( – ) was an Estonian writer and the author of the national epic &quot;Kalevipoeg&quot;.

==Life==
Friedrich Reinhold Kreutzwald&#x27;s parents were born at the Jömper estate, Governorate of Estonia, Russian Empire (in present-day Jõepere, Lääne-Viru County, Estonia) where his father Juhan worked as a shoemaker and granary keeper and mother Anne was a chambermaid. The family sent their son to continue his studies at the Wesenberg (Rakvere) district school.

In 1820, he graduated from secondary school in Dorpat (Tartu) and began working as an elementary school teacher. In 1833, Kreutzwald graduated from the Faculty of Medicine at the Imperial University of Dorpat.

Kreutzwald married Marie Elisabeth Saedler on 18 August the same year. From 1833 to 1877, he worked as the municipal physician in Werro (Võru). He was the member of numerous scientific societies in Europe and received honorary doctorates from a number of universities.

==Works==

Kreutzwald is the author of several moralistic folk books, most of them translated into German: &quot;Plague of Wine&quot; 1840, &quot;The World and Some Things One Can Find in It&quot; 1848–49, &quot;Reynard the Fox&quot; 1850, and &quot;Wise Men of Gotham&quot; 1857. In addition to these works, he composed the national epic &quot;Kalevipoeg&quot; (Kalev&#x27;s Son), using material initially gathered by his friend Friedrich Robert Faehlmann; and wrote many other works based on Estonian folklore, such as &quot;Old Estonian Fairy-Tales&quot; (1866), collections of verses, and the poem &quot;Lembitu&quot; (1885), published after his death.

Kreutzwald is considered one of the intellectual leaders of the Estonian national awakening. He also was a role model for young Estonian-speaking intellectuals.

Pope-Hennessy was director of the Victoria and Albert Museum between 1967 and 1973, and director of the British Museum between 1974 and 1976. He was a scholar of Italian Renaissance art. Many of his writings, including the tripartite &quot;Introduction to Italian Sculpture&quot;, and his magnum opus, &quot;Donatello: Sculptor&quot;, are regarded as classics in the field.

==Early years==
Born into an Irish Catholic family in the Belgravia district of Central London, Pope-Hennesssy&#x27;s father was Major-General Richard Pope-Hennessy, who was the son of the politician Sir John Pope Hennessy. Pope-Hennessy&#x27;s mother was Dame Una Pope-Hennessy. He was the elder of two sons; his younger brother, James Pope-Hennessy, was a noted writer.

Pope-Hennessy was educated at Downside School, a Catholic boarding school for boys, in Stratton-on-the-Fosse. He then went on to Balliol College, Oxford, where he specialised in modern history. At Oxford, he was introduced by Logan Pearsall Smith, a family friend, to Kenneth Clark, who later became a mentor.

Upon graduation, Pope-Hennessy embarked his journeyman years by travelling in continental Europe and becoming acquainted with art collections, both public and private.

During World War II he served as a Flight Lieutenant in the Deputy Directorate of Intelligence at the Air Ministry.

==Career==
Between 1955 and 1963, Pope-Hennessy&#x27;s three-volume &quot;Introduction to Italian Sculpture&quot; was published, covering Gothic, Renaissance and High Renaissance and Baroque sculpture. The following year, he was named Slade Professor of Fine Art at the University of Cambridge.

Pope-Hennessy served as the director of the Victoria and Albert Museum between 1967 and 1973, and then as director of the British Museum from 1974 until 1976. There, he was nicknamed by colleagues as &quot;The Pope&quot;.

Traumatised by the murder of his gay brother James in January 1974, Pope-Hennessy left the British Museum after only two years as director. Initially, he went to Tuscany, but was enticed by an offer from the Metropolitan Museum of Art to head its department of European painting, and moved to New York City. He combined this curatorial post with a professorship at New York University&#x27;s Institute of Fine Arts. Pope-Hennessy was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1974 and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1978. In 1986, Philippe de Montebello, director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, created the John Pope-Hennessy Curatorship of European Paintings.

Pope-Hennessy also served on the boards of the Venice in Peril Fund and Save Venice Inc., two non-profit organisations dedicated to the conservation and preservation of Venetian cultural heritage.

Besides his own scholarly publications, some of which became classics and were often reprinted, and his responsibilities as a museum director, he provided his name and expertise for others (such as Sotheby&#x27;s or the &quot;Collins Encyclopedia of Antiques&quot;). He also wrote a foreword for Helmut Gernsheim&#x27;s photographies of &quot;Beautiful London&quot;, contributed to a book on &quot;Westminster Abbey&quot; (1972), and wrote an autobiography that was published in 1991.

==Death and legacy==
Although never really rich, Pope-Hennessy improved his financial situation substantially in the 1980s by selling two paintings he had acquired in 1946 in the sale of the Bridgewater House collection: Domenichino&#x27;s &quot;Christ Carrying the Cross&quot;, which he had bought for GBP38, to the Getty Museum for USD750,000 and Annibale Carracci&#x27;s &quot;Vision of Saint Francis&quot;, which he had bought for only GBP28, to the National Gallery of Canada for GBP100,000. With these proceeds he was able to afford his new lodging in Florence.

Hence, he retired at the age of seventy-five and moved permanently to Florence with his lover, Michael Mallon, and resided at Palazzo Canigiani, where he died five years later. Pope-Hennessy is buried in the Cimitero degli Allori in Florence. His gravestone includes a quote from the First Epistle to the Corinthians in the Bible. The remains of his impressive art collection in Florence were sold two years after his death for roughly GBP1,000,000 at Christie&#x27;s in New York.

<doc id="764882" wikidata="Q216622" url="?curid=764882" title="Tarim Basin">
<text>The Tarim Basin is an endorheic basin in Xinjiang, Northwestern China occupying an area of about and one of the largest basins in Northwest China. Located in China&#x27;s Xinjiang region, it is sometimes used synonymously to refer to the southern half of the province, that is, Southern Xinjiang or Nanjiang (), as opposed to the northern half of the province known as Dzungaria or Beijiang. Its northern boundary is the Tian Shan mountain range and its southern boundary is the Kunlun Mountains on the edge of the Tibetan Plateau. The Taklamakan Desert dominates much of the basin. The historical Uyghur name for the Tarim Basin is Altishahr (Traditional Uyghur: , ), which means &#x27;six cities&#x27; in Uyghur. The region was also called &quot;Little Bukhara&quot; or &quot;Little Bukharia&quot;.

==Geography and relation to Xinjiang==

Xinjiang consists of two main geographically, historically, and ethnically distinct regions with different historical names, Dzungaria and the Tarim Basin (Altishahr), which Qing China unified into Xinjiang province in 1884. At the time of the Qing conquest in 1759, Dzungaria was inhabited by steppe-dwelling, nomadic Mongolic-speaking, Tibetan Buddhist Dzungars, while the Tarim Basin (Altishahr) was inhabited by sedentary, oasis-dwelling, Turkic-speaking Uyghur Muslim farmers. Dzungaria and the Tarim Basin were each governed separately until the creation of Xinjiang in 1884.

=== Tarim Basin locations ===

====North side====
The Chinese called this the &quot;Tien Shan Nan Lu&quot; or Tien Shan South Road, as opposed to the &quot;Bei Lu&quot; north of the mountains. Along it runs the modern highway and railroad while the middle Tarim River is about 100 km south. The caravans met in Kashgar before crossing the mountains. Bachu or Miralbachi; Uchturpan north of the main road; Aksu on the large Aksu River; Kucha was once an important kingdom; Luntai; Korla, now a large town; Karashar near Bosten Lake; Turpan north of the Turpan Depression and south of the Bogda Shan; Hami; then southeast to Anxi and the Gansu Corridor.

====Center====
Most of the basin is occupied by the Taklamakan Desert which is too dry for permanent habitation. The Yarkand, Kashgar and Aksu Rivers join to form the Tarim River which runs along the north side of the basin. Formerly it continued to Loulan, but some time after 330 AD it turned southeast near Korla toward Charkilik, and Loulan was abandoned. The Tarim ended at the now-dry Lop Nur, which occupied a shifting position east of Loulan. Eastward is the fabled Jade Gate which the Chinese considered the gateway to the Western Regions. Beyond that was Dunhuang with its ancient manuscripts and then Anxi at the west end of the Gansu Corridor.

====South side====
Settlements include Kashgar; Yangi Hissar, famous for its knives; Yarkand, once larger than Kashgar; Karghalik (Yecheng), with a route to India; Karakash; Khotan, the main source of Chinese jade; eastward the land becomes more desolate; Keriya (Yutian); Niya (Minfeng); Qiemo (Cherchen); Charkilik (Ruoqiang). The modern road continues east to Tibet. There is currently no road east across the Kumtag Desert to Dunhuang, but caravans somehow made the crossing through the Yangguan pass south of the Jade Gate.

===Roads and transportation===

====Railways====
The whole Tarim Basin and the Taklamakan Desert are surrounded by railroads. The Southern Xinjiang Railway branches from the Lanxin Railway near Turpan, follows the north side of the basin to Kashgar, and curves southeast to Khotan, while Hotan–Ruoqiang railway loops around the south and west side of the Traim. They are part of the Taklimakan Desert railway loop, joined together with sections of the Golmud–Korla railway, Hotan–Ruoqiang railway, Kashgar–Hotan railway, and Southern Xinjiang railway.

====Roads====
The main road from eastern China reaches Ürümqi and continues as highway 314 along the north side to Kashgar. Highway 315 follows the south side from Kashgar to Charkilik and continues east to Tibet. There are currently four north–south roads across the desert. 218 runs from Charkilik to Korla along the former course of the Tarim, forming an oval whose other end is Kashgar. The Tarim Desert Highway, a major engineering achievement, crosses the center from Niya to Luntai. The new Highway 217 follows the Khotan River from Khotan to near Aksu. A road follows the Yarkant River from Yarkand to Baqu. East of the Korla-Charkilik road, travel continues to be very difficult.

====Rivers====
Rivers coming south from the Tien Shan join the Tarim, the largest being the Aksu. Rivers flowing north from the Kunlun are usually named for the town or oasis they pass through. Most dry up in the desert; only the Hotan River reaches the Tarim in good years. An exception is the Qiemo River which flows northeast into Lop Nor. Ruins in the desert imply that these rivers were once larger.

====Caravans and passes====
The original caravan route seems to have followed the south side. At the time of the Han dynasty conquest, it shifted to the center (Jade Gate-Loulan-Korla). When the Tarim changed course about 330 AD it shifted north to Hami. A minor route went north of the Tian Shan. When there was war on the Gansu Corridor trade entered the basin near Charkilik from the Qaidam Basin. The original route to India seems to have started near Yarkand and Kargilik, but it is now replaced by the Karakoram Highway south from Kashgar. To the west of Kashgar via the Irkeshtam border crossing is the Alay Valley, which was once the route to Persia. Northeast of Kashgar the Torugart pass leads to the Ferghana Valley. Near Uchturpan the Bedel Pass leads to Lake Issyk-Kul and the steppes. Somewhere near Aksu the difficult Muzart Pass led north to the Ili River basin (Kulja). Near Korla was the Iron Gate Pass and now the highway and railway north to Ürümqi. From Turfan the easy Dabancheng pass leads to Ürümqi. The route from Charkilik to the Qaidam Basin was of some importance when Tibet was an empire.

North of the mountains is Dzungaria with its central Gurbantünggüt Desert, Ürümqi, and the Karamay oil fields. The Kulja territory is the upper basin of the Ili River and opens out onto the Kazakh Steppe with several roads east. The Dzungarian Gate was once a migration route and is now a road and rail crossing. Tacheng or Tarbaghatay is a crossroads and former trading post.

== Geology ==

The Tarim Basin is the result of an amalgamation between an ancient microcontinent and the growing Eurasian continent during the Carboniferous to Permian periods, a process which ended in the earliest Triassic with the closure of the Palaeo-Asian Ocean. At present, deformation around the margins of the basin is resulting in the microcontinental crust being pushed under Tian Shan to the north, and Kunlun Shan to the south.

A thick succession of Paleozoic, Mesozoic and Cenozoic sedimentary rocks occupy the central parts of the basin, locally exceeding thicknesses of . The source rocks of oil and gas tend to be mostly Permian mudstones and, less often, Ordovician strata which experienced an intense and widespread early Hercynian karstification. The effect of this event are e.g. paleokarst reservoirs in the Tahe oil field. Below the level enriched with gas and oil is a complex Precambrian basement believed to be made up of the remnants of the original Tarim microplate, which accrued to the growing Eurasian continent in Carboniferous time.

The snow on K2, the second-highest mountain in the world, flows into glaciers which move down the valleys to melt. The melted water forms rivers which flow down the mountains and into the Tarim Basin, never reaching the sea. Surrounded by desert, some rivers feed the oases where the water is used for irrigation while others flow to salt lakes and marshes.
Lop Nur is a marshy, saline depression at the east end of the Tarim Basin. The Tarim River ends in Lop Nur.

The Tarim Basin is believed to contain large potential reserves of petroleum and natural gas. Methane comprises over 70 percent of the natural gas reserve, with variable contents of ethane (&lt;1% – c. 18%) and propane (&lt;0.5% – c. 9%). China National Petroleum Corporation&#x27;s comprehensive exploration of the Tarim basin between 1989 and 1995 led to the identification of 26 oil- and gas-bearing structures. These occur at deeper depths and in scattered deposits. Beijing aims to develop Xinjiang into China&#x27;s new energy base for the long run, supplying one-fifth of the country&#x27;s total oil supply by 2010, with an annual output of 35 million tonnes. On June 10, 2010, Baker Hughes announced an agreement to work with PetroChina Tarim Oilfield Co. to supply oilfield services, including both directional and vertical drilling systems, formation evaluation services, completion systems and artificial lift technology for wells drilled into foothills formations greater than deep with pressures greater than and bottom-hole temperatures of approximately . Electrical submersible pumping (ESP) systems will be employed to dewater gas and condensate wells. PetroChina will fund any joint development.

In 2015, Chinese researchers published the finding of a vast, carbon-rich underground sea beneath the basin.

== History ==
It is speculated that the Tarim Basin may be one of the last places in Asia to have become inhabited: It is surrounded by mountains and irrigation technologies might have been necessary.

The Northern Silk Road on one route bypassed the Tarim Basin north of the Tian Shan mountains and traversed it on three oases-dependent routes: one north of the Taklamakan Desert, one south, and a middle one connecting both through the Lop Nor region.
* The northern Tarim route ran from Kashgar via Aksu, Kucha, Korla, through the Iron Gate Pass, then Karasahr, Jiaohe, Turpan, Gaochang and Kumul to Anxi.
* The southern Tarim route ran from Kashgar through Yarkant, Karghalik, Pishan, Khotan, Keriya, Niya, Qarqan, Qarkilik, Miran and Dunhuang to Anxi.
* The middle Tarim route, the shortest of the four, connected Korla on the northern Tarim route through Loulan and across the Lop Nor region and Dunhuang on the southern Tarim route. The Lop Nor region became uninhabitable in the 4th century and the middle route has been deserted since the 6th century.

===Early periods===
In the early period, beginning around 2000 BC, there were six different cultural zones in the Tarim Basin, and bronze began to appear. One of these cultures was the Xintala culture (–1500 BC), near the site of Yanqi, also known as Karashar, to the north and east of the Tarim, at the Kaidu river.
Structures made of mud bricks were found at Xintala, showing building techniques similar to those seen in early oasis sites in western Central Asia, as well as in Yanbulake. There were no burials in Xintala culture, and its settlements were small.
Autosomal genetic evidence suggests that the earliest Tarim people arose from locals of primarily Ancient North Eurasian descent with significant Northeast Asian admixture. The Tarim mummies have been found in various locations in the eastern Tarim Basin such as Loulan, the Xiaohe Tomb complex, and Qäwrighul. These mummies have previously been suggested to be of Tocharian origin, but recent evidence suggests that the mummies belonged to a distinct population unrelated to later Indo-European pastoralists, such as Afanasievo. 

In the Iron Age, the Chawuhu culture (c. 1000–400 BC) flourished in the Yanqi (Karashar) oasis, and also reached the Alagou sites near the Turfan basin, and north to the region close to Ürümqi.

Earlier diggings in the southern Tarim Basin, in the 1990s, suggested that Yuansha (Djoumbulak Koum) in the Keriya river valley was the earliest fortified urban site, from around 400 BC, but new surveys and excavations between 2018 and 2020, showed that the site Kuiyukexiehai&#x27;er (Koyuk Shahri), located in the northern Tarim Basin, is actually the earliest fortified urban settlement in the entire region, covering 6 hectares, and developed in four phases between c. 770 BC and 80 AD. Spouted jars were found at this site, similar to those of Chawuhu culture, and buckles and moulds with animal motifs resemble steppe traditions.

Another people in the region besides these Tarim people were the Indo-Iranian Saka people, who spoke various Eastern Iranian Khotanese Scythian or Saka dialects. In the Achaemenid era Old Persian inscriptions found at Persepolis, dated to the reign of Darius I (r. 522–486 BC), the Saka are said to have lived just beyond the borders of Sogdiana. Likewise, an inscription dated to the reign of Xerxes I (r. 486–465 BC) has them coupled with the Dahae people of Central Asia. The contemporary Greek historian Herodotus noted that the Achaemenid Persians called all Indo-Iranian Scythian peoples &quot;Saka&quot;. They were known as the Sai (塞, sāi, &quot;sək&quot; in archaic Chinese) in ancient Chinese records. These records indicate that they originally inhabited the Ili and Chu River valleys of modern Kazakhstan. In the Chinese &quot;Book of Han&quot;, the area was called the &quot;land of the Sai&quot;, i.e. the Saka. A people believed to be Saka has also been found in various locations in the Tarim Basin, for example in the Keriya region at Yumulak Kum (Djoumboulak Koum, Yuansha) around 200 km east of Khotan, with a tomb dated to as early as the 7th century BC.

According to the Sima Qian&#x27;s &quot;Shiji&quot;, the nomadic Indo-European Yuezhi originally lived between Tengri Tagh (Tian Shan) and Dunhuang in Gansu, China. However, the Yuezhi were assaulted and forced to flee from the Hexi Corridor of Gansu by the forces of the Xiongnu ruler Modu Chanyu, who conquered the area in 177–176 BC (decades before the Han Chinese conquest and colonization of western tip of Gansu or the establishment of the Protectorate of the Western Regions). In turn the Yuezi attacked and pushing the Sai (i.e. Saka) west into Sogdiana, where in the mid-2nd century BC the latter crossed the Syr Darya into Bactria, but also into the Fergana Valley where they settled in Dayuan, south towards northern India, and eastward as well, where they settled in some of the oasis city-states of the Tarim Basin. Whereas the Yuezhi continued westward and conquered Daxia around 177–176 BC, the Sai (i.e. Saka), including some allied Tocharian peoples, fled south to the Pamirs before heading back east to settle in Tarim Basin sites like Yanqi (焉耆, Karasahr) and Qiuci (龜茲, Kucha). The Saka are recorded as inhabiting Khotan by at least the 3rd century and also settled in nearby Shache (莎車), a town named after its Saka inhabitants (i.e. &quot;saγlâ&quot;). Although the ancient Chinese called Khotan &quot;Yutian&quot; (于闐), its more native Iranian names during the Han period were &quot;Jusadanna&quot; (瞿薩旦那), derived from Indo-Iranian &quot;Gostan&quot; and &quot;Gostana&quot;, the names of the town and region around it, respectively.

===Han dynasty===
Around 200 BCE, the Yuezhi were overrun by the Xiongnu. The Xiongnu then tried to invade the western region of China, but ultimately failed and lost control of the region to the Chinese. The Han Chinese wrested control of the Tarim Basin from the Xiongnu at the end of the 1st century under the leadership of General Ban Chao (32–102 CE), during the Han-Xiongnu War. The Chinese administered the Tarim Basin as the Protectorate of the Western Regions. The Tarim Basin was later under many foreign rulers, but ruled primarily by Turkic, Han, Tibetan, and Mongolic peoples.

The powerful Kushans, who conquered the last vestiges of the Indo-Greek Kingdom, expanded back into the Tarim Basin in the 1st–2nd centuries CE, where they established a kingdom in Kashgar and competed for control of the area with nomads and Chinese forces. The Yuezhi or Rouzhi (, ) were an ancient people first reported in Chinese histories as nomadic pastoralists living in an arid grassland area in the western part of the modern Chinese province of Gansu during the 1st millennium BC. After a major defeat by the Xiongnu, in the 2nd century BC, the Yuezhi split into two groups: the Greater Yuezhi (&quot;Dà Yuèzhī&quot; 大月氏) and Lesser Yuezhi (&quot;Xiǎo Yuèzhī&quot; 小月氏). They introduced the Brahmi script, the Indian Prakrit language for administration, and Buddhism, playing a central role in the Silk Road transmission of Buddhism to Eastern Asia.

Three pre-Han texts mention peoples who appear to be the Yuezhi, albeit under slightly different names.
* The philosophical tract &quot;Guanzi&quot; (73, 78, 80 and 81) mentions nomadic pastoralists known as the &quot;Yúzhī&quot; 禺氏 (Old Chinese: *ŋʷjo-kje) or &quot;Niúzhī&quot; 牛氏 (OC: *ŋʷjə-kje), who supplied jade to the Chinese. (The &quot;Guanzi&quot; is now generally believed to have been compiled around 26 BC, based on older texts, including some from the Qi state era of the 11th to 3rd centuries BC. Most scholars no longer attribute its primary authorship to Guan Zhong, a Qi official in the 7th century BC.) The export of jade from the Tarim Basin, since at least the late 2nd millennium BC, is well-documented archaeologically. For example, hundreds of jade pieces found in the Tomb of Fu Hao (c. 1200 BC) originated from the Khotan area, on the southern rim of the Tarim Basin. According to the &quot;Guanzi&quot;, the Yúzhī/Niúzhī, unlike the neighbouring Xiongnu, did not engage in conflict with nearby Chinese states.
* The &quot;Tale of King Mu, Son of Heaven&quot; (early 4th century BC) also mentions the &quot;Yúzhī&quot; 禺知 (OC: *ŋʷjo-kje).
* The &quot;Yi Zhou Shu&quot; (probably dating from the 4th to 1st century BC) makes separate references to the &quot;Yúzhī&quot; 禺氏 (OC: *ŋʷjo-kje) and &quot;Yuèdī&quot; 月氐 (OC: *ŋʷjat-tij). The latter may be a misspelling of the name &quot;Yuèzhī&quot; 月氏 (OC: *ŋʷjat-kje) found in later texts, composed of characters meaning &quot;moon&quot; and &quot;clan&quot; respectively.

===Sui–Tang dynasties===

After the Han dynasty, the kingdoms of the Tarim Basin began to have strong cultural influences on China as a conduit between the cultures of India and Central Asia and China. Indian Buddhists had previously travelled to China during the Han dynasty, but the Buddhist monk Kumārajīva from Kucha, who visited China during the Six Dynasties period was particularly renowned. Music and dances from Kucha were also popular in the Sui and Tang periods.

During the Tang dynasty, a series of military expeditions were conducted against the oasis states of the Tarim Basin, then vassals of the Western Turkic Khaganate. The campaigns against the oasis states began under Emperor Taizong with the annexation of Gaochang in 640. The nearby kingdom of Karasahr was captured by the Tang in 644 and the kingdom of Kucha was conquered in 649.

The expansion into Central Asia continued under Taizong&#x27;s successor, Emperor Gaozong, who dispatched an army in 657 led by Su Dingfang against the Western Turk qaghan Ashina Helu. Ashina was defeated and the khaganate was absorbed into the Tang empire. The Tarim Basin was administered through the Anxi Protectorate and the Four Garrisons of Anxi. Tang hegemony beyond the Pamir Mountains in modern Tajikistan and Afghanistan ended with revolts by the Turks, but the Tang retained a military presence in Xinjiang. These holdings were later invaded by the Tibetan Empire to the south in 670. For the remainder of the Tang dynasty, the Tarim Basin alternated between Tang and Tibetan rule as they competed for control of Central Asia.

===Kingdom of Khotan===

As a consequence of the Han–Xiongnu War from 133 BC to 89 AD, the Tarim Basin region of Xinjiang in Northwest China, including the Saka-founded oasis city-state of Khotan and Kashgar, fell under Han Chinese influence, beginning with the reign of Emperor Wu (r. 141–87 BC) of the Han dynasty. Much like the neighboring people of the Kingdom of Khotan, people of Kashgar, the capital of the Shule Kingdom, spoke Saka, one of the Eastern Iranian languages. As noted by the Greek historian Herodotus, the contemporary Persians labelled all Scythians &quot;Saka&quot;. Indeed, modern scholarly consensus is that the Saka language, ancestor to the Pamir languages in northern India and Khotanese in Xinjiang, belongs to the Scythian languages.

During China&#x27;s Tang dynasty (618–907 AD), the region once again came under Chinese suzerainty with the campaigns of conquest by Emperor Taizong of Tang (r. 626–649). From the late 8th to 9th centuries, the region changed hands between the Chinese Tang Empire and the rival Tibetan Empire. By the early 11th century the region had fallen to the Muslim Turkic peoples of the Kara-Khanid Khanate, which led to both the Turkification of the region and its conversion from Buddhism to Islam.
Suggestive evidence of Khotan&#x27;s early link to India are minted coins from Khotan dated to the 3rd century, bearing dual inscriptions in Chinese and Gandhari Prakrit in the Kharosthi script. Although Prakrit was the administrative language of nearby Shanshan, 3rd-century documents from that kingdom record the title &quot;hinajha&quot; (i.e. &quot;generalissimo&quot;) for the king of Khotan, Vij&#x27;ida-simha, a distinctively Iranian-based word equivalent to the Sanskrit title &quot;senapati&quot;, yet nearly identical to the Khotanese Saka &quot;hīnāysa&quot; attested in contemporary documents. This, along with the fact that the king&#x27;s recorded regnal periods were given in Khotanese as &quot;kṣuṇa&quot;, &quot;implies an established connection between the Iranian inhabitants and the royal power&quot;, according to the late Professor of Iranian Studies Ronald E. Emmerick (d. 2001). He contended that Khotanese-Saka-language royal rescripts of Khotan dated to the 10th century &quot;makes it likely that the ruler of Khotan was a speaker of Iranian.&quot; Furthermore, he elaborated on the early name of Khotan:

In Northwest China, Khotanese-Saka-language documents, ranging from medical texts to Buddhist literature, have been found, primarily in Khotan and Tumshuq (northeast of Kashgar). They largely predate the arrival of Islam to the region under the Turkic Kara-Khanids. Similar documents in the Khotanese-Saka language were found in Dunhuang dating mostly to the 10th century.

===Turkic influx===
After the collapse of the Uyghur Khaganate of modern-day Mongolia, Uyghur people migrated to the Tarim Basin and mixed with the Tocharians and converted to their religion, and adopted their method of oasis agriculture. In the tenth century, the Karluks, Yagmas, Chigils and other Turkic tribes founded the Kara-Khanid Khanate in Semirechye, Western Tian Shan, and Kashgaria.

===Islamisation of the Tarim Basin===
The Karakhanids became the first Islamic Turkic dynasty in the tenth century when Sultan Satuq Bughra Khan converted to Islam in 966 while he controlled Kashgar. Satuq Bughra Khan and his son directed endeavors to preach Islam among the Turks and engage in conquests. Satok Bughra Khan&#x27;s nephew or grandson Ali Arslan was slain by the Buddhists during the war. Buddhism lost territory to the Turkic Karakhanid Satok Bughra Khan during the Karakhanid reign around Kashgar. The Tarim Basin became Islamicized over the next few centuries.

====Turkic-Islamic Kara-Khanid conquest of Iranic Saka Buddhist Khotan====
In the tenth century, the Buddhist Iranic Saka Kingdom of Khotan was the only city-state that was not conquered yet by the Turkic Uyghur (Buddhist) and the Turkic Karakhanid (Muslim) states. The Buddhist entitites of Dunhuang and Khotan had a tight-knit partnership, with intermarriage between Dunhuang and Khotan&#x27;s rulers and Dunhuang&#x27;s Mogao grottos and Buddhist temples being funded and sponsored by the Khotan royals, whose likenesses were drawn in the Mogao grottoes. Halfway in the 10th century Khotan came under attack by the Karakhanid ruler Musa, a long war ensued between the Turkic Karakhanid and Buddhist Khotan which eventually ended in the conquest of Khotan by Kashgar by the Karakhanid leader Yusuf Qadir Khan around 1006.

Accounts of the Muslim Karakhanid war against the Khotanese Buddhists are given in &quot;Taẕkirah of the Four Sacrificed Imams&quot; written sometime in the period from 1700 to 1849 which told the story of four imams from Mada&#x27;in city (possibly in modern-day Iraq) who traveled to help the Islamic conquest of Khotan, Yarkand, and Kashgar by Yusuf Qadir Khan, the Karakhanid leader. The &quot;infidels&quot; were defeated and driven towards Khotan by Yusuf Qadir Khan and the four Imams, but the Imams were assassinated by the Buddhists prior to the last Muslim victory. After Yusuf Qadir Khan&#x27;s conquest of new land in Altishahr towards the east, he adopted the title &quot;King of the East and China&quot;.

In 1006, the Muslim Kara-Khanid ruler Yusuf Kadir (Qadir) Khan of Kashgar conquered Khotan, ending Khotan&#x27;s existence as an independent state. The Islamic conquest of Khotan led to alarm in the east and Dunhuang&#x27;s Cave 17, which contained Khotanese literary works, was closed shut possibly after its caretakers heard that Khotan&#x27;s Buddhist buildings were razed by the Muslims, the Buddhist religion had suddenly ceased to exist in Khotan. The Karakhanid Turkic Muslim writer Mahmud al-Kashgari recorded a short Turkic language poem about the conquest:

English translation:

We came down on them like a flood,
We went out among their cities,
We tore down the idol-temples,
We shat on the Buddha&#x27;s head!
In Turkic:
kälginläyü aqtïmïz
kändlär üzä čïqtïmïz
furxan ävin yïqtïmïz
burxan üzä sïčtïmïz
====Conversion of the Buddhist Uyghurs====
The Buddhist Uyghurs of the Kingdom of Qocho and Turfan embraced Islam after conversion at the hands of the Muslim Chagatai Khizr Khwaja.

Kara Del was a Mongolian ruled and Uighur populated Buddhist Kingdom. The Muslim Chagatai Khan Mansur invaded and used the sword to make the population convert to Islam.

After being converted to Islam, the descendants of the previously Buddhist Uyghurs in Turfan believed that the &quot;infidel Kalmuks&quot; (Dzungars) were the ones who built Buddhist monuments in their area, in opposition to the current academic theory that it was their own ancestral legacy.

=== Before Qing conquest ===
The eastern regions of the Chagatai Khanate in the early 14th century had been inhabited by a number of Mongol nomadic tribes. These tribes resented the conversion of khan Tarmashirin to Islam and the move of the khan to the sedentary areas of Transoxiana. They were behind the revolt that ended in Tarmashirin&#x27;s death. One of the khans that followed Tarmashirin, Changshi, favored the east and was non-Muslim. In the 1340s as a series of ephemeral khans struggled to hold power in Transoxiana, little attention was paid by the Chagatayids to the eastern regions. As a result, the eastern tribes there were virtually independent. The most powerful of the tribes, the Dughlats, controlled extensive territories in Moghulistan and the western Tarim Basin. In 1347 the Dughlats decided to appoint a khan of their own, and raised the Chagatayid Tughlugh Timur to the throne.

In 1509 the Dughlats, vassal rulers of the Tarim basin, rebelled against the Moghulistan Khanate and broke away. Five years later Sultan Said Khan, a brother of the Khan of Moghulistan in Turfan, conquered the Dughlats but established his own Yarkent Khanate instead. By the early 17th century, the Naqshbandi Sufi Khojas, descendants of Muhammad, had replaced the Chagatayid Khans as rulers of the Tarim Basin. There was a struggle between two Khoja factions: the Afaqi (White Mountain) and the Ishaqi (Black Mountain). The Ishaqi defeated the Afaqi and the Afaq Khoja invited the 5th Dalai Lama (the leader of the Tibetans) to intervene on his behalf in 1677. The Dalai Lama then called on his Dzungar Buddhist followers in the Dzungar Khanate to act on the invitation. The Dzungar Khanate conquered the Tarim Basin in 1678, during the Dzungar conquest of Altishahr, after which they set up Afaq Khoja as their puppet ruler.

===Qing dynasty===

Xinjiang did not exist as one unit until 1884 under Qing rule. It consisted of the two separate political entities of Dzungaria and the Tarim Basin (Eastern Turkestan). Dzungharia or Ili was called Zhunbu 準部 (Dzungar region) Tianshan Beilu 天山北路 (Northern March), &quot;Xinjiang&quot; 新疆 (New Frontier), or &quot;Kalmykia&quot; (La Kalmouquie in French). It was formerly the area of the Dzungar (or Zunghar) Khanate 準噶爾汗國, the land of the Dzungar people. The Tarim Basin was known as &quot;Tianshan Nanlu 天山南路 (southern March), Huibu 回部 (Muslim region), Huijiang 回疆 (Muslim frontier), Chinese Turkestan, Kashgaria, Little Bukharia, East Turkestan&quot;, and the traditional Uyghur name for it was Altishahr (, &quot;Алтә-шәһәр&quot;). It was formerly the area of the Eastern Chagatai Khanate 東察合台汗國, land of the Uyghur people before being conquered by the Dzungars.

== Demographics ==
The population of the Tarim Basin is estimated at approximately 5.5 million.

=== People of the Tarim Basin ===

According to census figures, the Tarim Basin is dominated by the Uyghurs. They form the majority population in cities such as Kashgar, Artush, and Hotan. There are however large pockets of Han Chinese in the region, such as Aksu and Korla. There are also smaller numbers of Hui and other ethnic groups, for example, the Tajiks who are concentrated at Tashkurgan in the Kashgar Prefecture, the Kyrgyz in Kizilsu, and the Mongols in Bayingolin.

The language spoken by the earliest Tarim residents is unclear; however it is widely agreed upon that they would eventually be Indo-European speakers. The mummies have been described as being both &quot;Caucasoid&quot; and &quot;Mongoloid&quot; and mixed-race individuals are also observed, and genetics analysis also indicate that the population was of mixed ancestry in the bronze and iron age periods. Professor James A. Millward described the original Uyghurs as physically Mongoloid, giving as an example the images in Bezeklik at Temple 9 of the Uyghur patrons, until they began to mix with the Tarim Basin&#x27;s original Tocharian and eastern Iranian inhabitants. However, according to a genetic study of early Uyghur remains from the Uyghur Khaganate in Mongolia, most Uyghur-period individuals exhibit a high but variable degree of west Eurasian ancestry. The east–west admixture in the Uyghur Khaganate was said to have taken place around the year 500 AD.

== Archaeology ==
Although archaeological findings are of interest in the Tarim Basin, the prime impetus for exploration was petroleum and natural gas. Recent research with help of GIS database have provided a fine-grained analysis of the ancient oasis of Niya on the Silk Road. This research led to significant findings; remains of hamlets with wattle and daub structures as well as farm land, orchards, vineyards, irrigation pools and bridges. The oasis at Niya preserves the ancient landscape. Here also have been found hundreds of 3rd and 4th century wooden accounting tablets at several settlements across the oasis. These texts are in the Kharosthi script native to today&#x27;s Pakistan and Afghanistan. The texts are legal documents such as tax lists, and contracts containing detailed information pertaining to the administration of daily affairs.

Additional excavations have unearthed tombs with mummies, tools, ceramic works, painted pottery and other artistic artifacts. Such diversity was encouraged by the cultural contacts resulting from this area&#x27;s position on the Silk Road. Early Buddhist sculptures and murals excavated at Miran show artistic similarities to the traditions of Central Asia and North India and stylistic aspects of paintings found there suggest that Miran had a direct connection with the West, specifically Rome and its provinces.

<text>Hötorget (&quot;Haymarket&quot;) is a city square in the center of Stockholm, Sweden that has been transitioning since the Early Medieval Period. 

==Description==
To its east lies the Royal Concert Hall, to its south lies Filmstaden Sergel, one of the largest multiscreen cinemas in inner-city Stockholm, and the adjacent Hötorgshallen food market hall, and to the west lies the Haymarket by Scandic Hotels. Southeast of the square are the five high-rise office buildings &quot;Hötorgsskraporna&quot;. To the north is the Kungshallen food court. During the daytime it is the site of a fruit and vegetable market, except on Sundays, when flea markets are arranged.

Hötorget station, on the Green line of the Stockholm metro, was opened in 1952 and is decorated with light blue tiles. The station kept its vintage style, in contrast to other more modern stations on the same line, retaining its original construction arrangements and materials such as tiles, signs, illumination, etc. There is an illuminated art installation on the ceiling of the station.
The platforms of Hötorget station make a brief appearance in Madonna&#x27;s &quot;Ray of Light&quot; music video.

The term &quot;Hötorget art&quot; () is a derogatory term for kitschy Swedish 20th century art lacking artistic value. The artist does not follow elite principles for sellable art, such as making multiple copies of each painting. Hötorget art is art which established art experts do not sell or assign a value. Such art was sold at Hötorget by artists to the common people, bypassing art galleries.

<text>Fort Clatsop was the encampment of the Lewis and Clark Expedition in the Oregon Country near the mouth of the Columbia River during the winter of 1805–1806. Located along the Lewis and Clark River at the north end of the Clatsop Plains approximately southwest of Astoria, the fort was the last encampment of the Corps of Discovery, before embarking on their return trip east to St. Louis.

The Lewis and Clark Expedition wintered at Fort Clatsop before returning east to St. Louis in the spring of 1806. It took just over three weeks for the Expedition to build the fort, and it served as their camp from December 8, 1805 until their departure on March 23, 1806.

The site is now protected as part of the Lewis and Clark National Historical Park, part of which was formerly known as Fort Clatsop National Memorial until 2004. The original Fort Clatsop decayed in the wet climate of the region but was reconstructed for the sesquicentennial in 1955 from sketches in the journals of William Clark. The replica lasted for fifty years, but was severely damaged by fire in early October 2005, weeks before Fort Clatsop&#x27;s . A new replica, more rustic and rough-hewn, was built by about 700 volunteers in 2006; it opened with a dedication ceremony that took place on December 9. The site is currently operated by the National Park Service.

==Background==
In 1803, Thomas Jefferson completed the Louisiana Purchase from France. As much of the area had not been explored by Europeans, Jefferson commissioned an expedition to be led by his secretary, Meriwether Lewis, along with William Clark. Jefferson set a number of goals for the expedition, most notably to determine what the land contained, including plants, animals, and natural resources. Jefferson also wanted to establish good relations with the Native Americans of the area. Additionally, Jefferson was very interested in finding a water route to the Pacific Ocean, which would have cut the travel time from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean considerably.

==Locating and building the fort==
In late November 1805, after spending a number of days in what is today the state of Washington, Lewis and Clark proposed that the Corps of Discovery move to a location along the Columbia River, based on a recommendation of the local Clatsop Indians. The group decided to vote on the matter, with everyone, including the young Native American woman Sacagawea and African American slave York, participating. The group was given three choices: stay on the Washington side of the Columbia River, and be subjected to diets of fish and rainy weather, move upriver, or take the advice of the Clatsop Indians and explore the area to the south of the River. The expedition overwhelmingly decided to take the advice of the local Indians to explore the idea of spending the winter on the southern shore of the River.

Lewis decided to explore the area before moving the entire group. He and five men left to scout the area, leaving Clark and the rest of the group behind. Lewis became frustrated when he could not find the abundant elk that the Clatsop had talked about. In the meantime, Clark had not heard from his companion in a number of days and became increasingly worried. During Lewis&#x27; absence, the group performed a number of housekeeping tasks, including fixing their clothes from the wear they had suffered during the long and arduous journey.
Finally, Lewis returned with the news that he had found an adequate location in which to winter. On December 7, 1805, the Corps of Discovery began the short journey to the location chosen by Lewis. Upon arrival, the men split into different groups: Clark led a party to the Pacific Ocean in search of salt, while Lewis split the remaining men into two groups. One group was in charge of hunting, while the other was in charge of cutting down trees to be used in the construction of the fort.

Construction of the fort was slow, due to the incessant precipitation and unyielding wind that made working conditions less than ideal. On December 23, people started to move into the dwelling, even though it didn&#x27;t yet have a roof. The next day, Christmas Eve, everyone moved in. On Christmas Day it was named &quot;Fort Clatsop&quot; in reference to the local Indian tribe.

The structures of Fort Clatsop were relatively simple, consisting of two buildings surrounded by large walls. All of the men lived in one structure, while Lewis, Clark, Sacagawea, her husband Toussaint Charbonneau, and their son, Jean Baptiste, stayed in the other.

==Winter activities==
The winter of 1805–1806 was very long and rainy, leading to boredom and restlessness for the Corps of Discovery. They passed the time with various activities, including hunting the abundant deer and elk in the region. The deer and elk meat spoiled quickly, but the skins were used to make clothing and moccasins. Realizing the importance of their trip, Lewis spent most of his time at Fort Clatsop documenting the journey, taking notes on the wildlife, terrain, and other features. Lewis also made maps of the area, which would be especially helpful to future settlers of the Pacific Northwest. Finally, Lewis and Clark occasionally traded with the Clatsop Indians, a tribe they had come to dislike, viewing them as untrustworthy and prone to theft.

Ultimately, the group&#x27;s time along the Columbia River merely served as a place to spend the winter and recoup. The men were suffering from a number of different illnesses and conditions, including venereal diseases and respiratory problems, and felt that departing would make them all feel better.

==Departure==
Toward the end of the monotonous winter they spent at Fort Clatsop, the men were desperate to return east. Everyone was sick and quite restless, and the steady diet of elk was becoming unbearable. Moreover, even the elk were becoming more difficult to find. Originally, Meriwether Lewis determined the departure date would be April 1, but it was later moved up to March 20. Ultimately, they didn&#x27;t leave until two days after that due to poor weather.

In order to travel back up the Columbia and reach the mountains, the group was desperately in need of canoes. The Clatsops had a number of them, but refused to trade with Lewis and Clark. Eventually, an agreement was reached for one canoe, but Lewis decided they had no choice but to steal a second one, since they couldn&#x27;t all travel without at least two boats.

On March 22, the Corps of Discovery began the long journey back to St. Louis. Lewis decided not to send any of the men back with a copy of his notes by sea, as was usually customary, because of the small number of people in the group. Instead, Lewis decided that the group would travel two different routes, in order to see as much of the territory as possible on the way back to St. Louis.

==Later use==

As a parting gift, Lewis gave Fort Clatsop to Coboway, the chief of the Clatsops. Lewis and Clark had no use for the fort, as they were returning east with no plans to revisit the fort in the near future. Because of the heavy rainfall of the region, the original Fort Clatsop had rotted away by the middle of the 19th century.
The Clatsops used the fort as a useful base for security and other purposes, though they did strip away part of the wood for other uses. The area soon became a very important site for the fur trade in the Pacific Northwest. The location of the fort near the Pacific Ocean and the Columbia River made it a natural site for the fur trade, which expanded rapidly in the years after Lewis and Clark left. Numerous fur trading companies, including the American Fur Company and the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, constructed headquarters in the region.

Since then, there have been two reconstruction efforts. The first, in 1955, lasted for 50 years until a fire destroyed the entire structure in the late evening of October 3, 2005. Federal, state, and community officials immediately pledged to rebuild it. A 9-1-1 operator&#x27;s insistence that the fire was no more than fog over the nearby Lewis and Clark River delayed firefighters’ arrival by about 15 minutes, possibly impacting their ability to save part of the structure. Investigators found no evidence of arson. The fire started in one of the enlisted men&#x27;s quarters, where earlier in the day there had been an open hearth fire burning. It took 18 months to build the 1955 reconstruction, much longer than the 3.5 weeks it took to build the original. Shortly after the fire, a second replica was built and finished in 2006. In spite of the loss, the fire renewed archaeological interest in the site, as excavations had not been possible while the replica was standing. Additionally, the new replica was built utilizing information on the original fort that was not available for the 1955 replica. The 2006 replica also features a fire detection system.

The replica of the fort isn&#x27;t in the exact location of the original, as no remains of the original fort have been found. However, it is thought to be quite close to the exact location.

<text>Tick, Tick... Boom! (styled as tick, tick... BOOM!) is a musical by Jonathan Larson. It tells the story of an aspiring composer named Jon, who lives in New York City in 1990. Jon is worried he has made the wrong career choice to be part of the performing arts. The story is semi-autobiographical, as stated by Larson&#x27;s father in the liner notes of the cast recording – Larson had been trying to establish himself in theater since the early 1980s.

Larson began to perform the piece as a solo work in 1990. After his death in 1996, it was revised and revamped by playwright David Auburn as a three-actor piece and was premiered Off-Broadway in 2001. Since then, the show has had an Off West End production, a West End production, an American national tour, two Off-Broadway revivals, in 2014 and 2016, and numerous local and international productions.

A film adaptation, directed by Lin-Manuel Miranda and starring Andrew Garfield in the lead role, was released by Netflix in November 2021. It was generally well received by critics, and Garfield received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance.

==History==
The show was first performed as a workshop between September 6 and September 9, 1990 by Jonathan Larson at the Off-Broadway playhouse Second Stage Theater under the title &quot;Boho Days&quot;. Larson revised the developing piece following the Second Stage workshop, changing the title to &quot;Tick, Tick... Boom!&quot;, and presented with him as performer in November 1991 at the Village Gate (produced by Larson&#x27;s college friend Victoria Leacock), and then later in 1992 and 1993 in the &quot;O Solo Mio&quot; fests at New York Theatre Workshop. Larson performed the show as a &quot;rock monologue&quot;, a new form of theatre for the time. The performance attracted the attention of a young producer named Jeffrey Seller, who became a fan of Larson&#x27;s work. In 1995, he saw the New York Theatre Workshop production of Larson&#x27;s musical &quot;Rent&quot; and convinced his fellow producers to bring it to Broadway.

After Larson&#x27;s death in 1996, Leacock asked David Auburn, author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning play &quot;Proof&quot;, to reconfigure &quot;Tick, Tick... Boom!&quot;. He restructured the monologue into a three-actor musical, with one actor playing Jon and the other two actors playing Michael and Susan, as well as all the other roles in the show. Also, the script and score were streamlined and edited. This revised version of the piece premiered Off-Broadway at the Jane Street Theater on May 23, 2001. Auburn received credit as &quot;Script Consultant&quot;.

==Plot==
Jon is an aspiring composer for musical theater, who lives in SoHo, New York. The year is 1990, and as his 30th birthday approaches Jon is worried about his aging and lack of achievement (&quot;30/90&quot;). Michael, a friend of Jon&#x27;s since childhood, gave up acting to pursue a more lucrative career in marketing. Susan, Jon&#x27;s girlfriend, is a dancer who teaches ballet to &quot;wealthy and untalented children&quot;. On the roof of his apartment building, Jon reveals that he is nervous about an upcoming workshop of his newest musical, &quot;SUPERBIA.&quot; When Susan comes to join him, he comments on her dress and how beautiful it makes her look (&quot;Green Green Dress&quot;).

The next morning, Susan asks Jon about the possibility of leaving New York. Jon is torn between following his dream of composing and opting for security and family in a different career (&quot;Johnny Can’t Decide&quot;). His reverie is cut short when he remembers his day job as a waiter in a SoHo diner (&quot;Sunday&quot;).

After work, Michael picks Jon up in his brand new BMW to show Jon his new apartment. Michael exults at the thought of a life of luxury (&quot;No More&quot;), and pressures Jon further to consider changing his career path. He agrees to accompany Michael to work the next day and visit a brainstorming session at his firm. Back at home, Jon plans to spend the remainder of the evening composing, but is interrupted by a call from Susan (&quot;Therapy&quot;).

At Michael&#x27;s office, the brainstorming session involves naming a cooking fat substitute through a convoluted process. Jon sees the futility of the process and his unwillingness to cooperate gets him removed from the meeting. As Jon drives Michael to the airport for a business trip, they argue about the meeting. Michael tells Jon that the life Susan wants doesn&#x27;t sound bad, and that he wishes his job could give him the chance to settle down (&quot;Real Life&quot;).

After dropping Michael off, Jon goes to a rehearsal for &quot;SUPERBIA,&quot; but not before stopping to get a snack of Twinkies (&quot;Sugar&quot;). At the market, he spies Karessa Johnson, one of his actors for &quot;SUPERBIA.&quot; She reveals a similar weakness for Twinkies, and this leads to a sudden friendship between the two. After the rehearsal, Susan sees Jon and Karessa walking together and becomes jealous. Jon begs Susan to stay and be with him. Despite this, she leaves for home, and Jon thinks about what may have happened to make her behave this way (&quot;See Her Smile&quot;).

The next morning, Jon arrives early at the theater for the workshop of &quot;SUPERBIA.&quot; Karessa steals the show with her performance of “Come to Your Senses”. Jon gets many congratulations, but no offers to produce the show, and so, in his eyes, the workshop has been a failure. Jon visits Michael and tells him that he is through with music. Michael says that while he enjoys how he makes a lot more money now, he finds the job to be banal and unrewarding. The two argue, and Jon yells at Michael for not understanding fear or insecurity. Michael responds by telling Jon that he is HIV-positive. Shocked, Jon leaves quickly and wanders through Central Park until he finds himself at the closed Delacorte Theater. He finds an old rehearsal piano and begins to play it while collecting his thoughts. Jon ponders on whether the amount of sacrifice required for his career in music is worth it, and whether those telling him to &quot;have it all, play the game&quot; are right (&quot;Why&quot;). Ultimately, he realizes that he will only be happy as a professional composer, no matter what hardships that may bring.

The next morning is Jon&#x27;s thirtieth birthday party (&quot;30/90 (Reprise)&quot;). He sees Susan, who is getting ready to leave. She gives him his birthday gift: a thousand sheets of blank manuscript paper. They agree to write to each other, and she leaves. The phone rings, and the caller is Jon&#x27;s idol, Stephen Sondheim. Sondheim leaves Jon his contact information so they can meet and discuss &quot;SUPERBIA&quot;. Jon realizes that he is surrounded by friends and that his talents are finally being recognized (&quot;Louder than Words&quot;).

Notes
*&quot;No More&quot; features a sample from Movin&#x27; On Up, the theme song of the television series &quot;The Jeffersons&quot;
*&quot;Sunday&quot;, Jon&#x27;s song at the diner, is based on the Act I Finale from the Stephen Sondheim musical &quot;Sunday in the Park with George&quot;; Larson conceived it as a humorous homage to Sondheim, one of his largest influences.
*In &quot;Johnny Can&#x27;t Decide&quot;, all the characters are referring to themselves in third-person, just like George in the song &quot;Lesson #8&quot; from &quot;Sunday in the Park with George.&quot; In the monologue version of the musical, only Jon did this.
*Another reference to Sondheim is present in the song &quot;Why&quot;. Not only mentioning &quot;West Side Story&quot; in the lyrics, the song utilizes the same tritone made famous in the &quot;West Side Story&quot; song &quot;Maria&quot;.
*&quot;Why&quot; contains fragments of several other songs: &quot;Yellow Bird&quot;, &quot;Let&#x27;s Go Fly a Kite&quot; from the film &quot;Mary Poppins&quot;, &quot;Cool&quot; and &quot;Tonight – Quintet&quot; both from &quot;West Side Story&quot;, and &quot;Come to Your Senses&quot; from Larson&#x27;s &quot;Superbia&quot;.
*On the cast recording, there is an additional song cut from the final version of the show, &quot;Boho Days&quot;. This track is one of the few recordings of Larson&#x27;s voice publicly available. It was extracted from a demo tape recorded by Larson during the development of &quot;Tick, Tick... Boom!
*On the 1989 demo album of &quot;Tick, Tick... Boom!&quot;, one track is &quot;Why&quot;, performed by Larson himself. In this recording, in place of &quot;Come to Your Senses&quot; is a fragment of &quot;LCD Readout&quot; and another song, both of which also come from &quot;Superbia&quot;.

<doc id="764891" wikidata="Q5158283" url="?curid=764891" title="Concealed ovulation">
<text>Concealed ovulation or hidden estrus is the lack of any perceptible change (e.g., a change in appearance or scent) when an adult female is fertile and near ovulation. Some examples of perceptible changes are swelling and redness of the vulva in baboons and bonobos, and pheromone release in the feline family. In contrast, the females of humans and a few other species that undergo hidden estrus have few external signs of fecundity, making it difficult for a mate to consciously deduce, by means of external signs only, whether or not a female is near ovulation.
== Human females ==

In humans, an adult woman&#x27;s fertility peaks for a few days during each roughly monthly cycle. The frequency and length of fertility (the time when a woman can become pregnant) is highly variable between women, and can slightly change for each woman over the course of her lifespan. Humans are considered to have concealed ovulation because there is no outward physiological sign, either to a woman herself or to others, that ovulation, or biological fertility, is occurring. Knowledge of the fertility cycle, learned through experience or from educational sources, can allow a woman to estimate her own level of fertility at a given time (fertility awareness). Whether other humans, potential reproductive partners in particular, can detect fertility in women through behavioral or invisible biological cues is highly debated. Scientists and laypersons are interested in this question because it has implications for human social behavior, and could theoretically offer biological explanations for some human sexual behavior. However, the science here is weak, due to a relatively small number of studies.

Several small studies have found that fertile women appear more attractive to men than women during infertile portions of her menstrual cycle, or women using hormonal contraception. It has also been suggested that a woman&#x27;s voice may become more attractive to men during this time. Two small studies of monogamous human couples found that women initiated sex significantly more frequently when fertile, but male-initiated sex occurred at a constant rate, without regard to the woman&#x27;s phase of menstrual cycle. It may be that a woman&#x27;s awareness of men&#x27;s courtship signals increases during her highly fertile phase due to an enhanced olfactory awareness of chemicals specifically found in men&#x27;s body odor.

Analyses of data provided by the post-1998 U.S. Demographic and Health Surveys found no variation in the occurrence of coitus in the menstrual phases (except during menstruation itself). This is contrary to other studies, which have found female sexual desire and extra-pair copulations (EPCs) to increase during the midfollicular to ovulatory phases (that is, the highly fertile phase). These findings of differences in woman-initiated versus man-initiated sex are likely caused by the woman&#x27;s subconscious awareness of her ovulation cycle (because of hormonal changes causing her to feel increased sexual desire), contrasting with the man&#x27;s inability to detect ovulation because of its being &quot;hidden&quot;.
In 2008, researchers announced the discovery in human semen of hormones usually found in ovulating women. They theorized that follicle stimulating hormone, luteinising hormone, and estradiol may encourage ovulation in women exposed to semen. These hormones are not found in the semen of chimpanzees, suggesting this phenomenon may be a human male counter-strategy to concealed ovulation in human females. Other researchers are skeptical that the low levels of hormones found in semen could have any effect on ovulation. One group of authors has theorized that concealed ovulation and menstruation were key factors in the development of symbolic culture in early human society.

==Evolutionary hypotheses==

Evolutionary psychologists have advanced a number of different possible explanations for concealed ovulation. Some posit that the lack of signaling in some species is a trait retained from evolutionary ancestors, not something that existed previously and later disappeared. If signaling is supposed to have existed and was lost, then it could have been merely due to reduced adaptive importance and lessened selection, or due to direct adaptive advantages for the concealment of ovulation. Yet another possibility (regarding humans specifically) is that while highly specific signaling of ovulation is absent, human female anatomy evolved to mimic permanent signaling of fertility.

===Paternal investment hypothesis===

The paternal investment hypothesis is strongly supported by many evolutionary biologists. Several hypotheses regarding human evolution integrate the idea that women increasingly required supplemental paternal investment in their offspring. The shared reliance on this idea across several hypotheses concerning human evolution increases its significance in terms of this specific phenomenon.

This hypothesis suggests that women concealed ovulation to obtain men&#x27;s aid in rearing offspring. Schröder summarizes this hypothesis outlined in Alexander and Noonan&#x27;s 1979 paper: if women no longer signaled the time of ovulation, men would be unable to detect the exact period in which they were fecund. This led to a change in men&#x27;s mating strategy: rather than mating with multiple women in the hope that some of them, at least, were fecund during that period, men instead chose to mate with a particular woman repeatedly throughout her menstrual cycle. A mating would be successful in resulting in conception when it occurred during ovulation, and thus, frequent matings, necessitated by the effects of concealed ovulation, would be most evolutionarily successful. A similar hypothesis was proposed by Lovejoy in 1981 that argued that concealed ovulation, reduced canines and bipedalism evolved from a reproductive strategy where males provisioned food resources to his paired female and dependent offspring.

Continuous female sexual receptivity suggests human sexuality is not solely defined by reproduction; a large part of it revolves around conjugal love and communication between partners. Copulations between partners while the woman is pregnant or in the infertile period of her menstrual cycle do not achieve conception, but do strengthen the bond between these partners. Therefore, the increased frequency of copulations due to concealed ovulation are thought to have played a role in fostering pair bonds in humans.

The pair bond would be very advantageous to the reproductive fitness of both partners throughout the period of pregnancy, lactation, and rearing of offspring. Pregnancy, lactation and caring for post-lactation offspring require vast amounts of energy and time on the part of the woman. She must at first consume more food, then provide food to her offspring, while her ability to forage is reduced throughout. Supplemental male investment in the mother and her offspring is advantageous to all parties. While the man supplements the woman&#x27;s limited gathered food, the woman is enabled to devote the necessary time and energy to the care of their offspring. The offspring benefits from the supplemental investment, in the form of food and defense from the father, and receives the full attention and resources of the mother. Through this shared parental investment, both man and woman would increase their offspring&#x27;s chances for survival, thereby increasing their reproductive fitness. In this way, natural selection would favor the establishment of pair bonds in humans. To the extent that concealed ovulation strengthened pair bonding, selective pressure would favor concealed ovulation as well.

Another, more recent, hypothesis is that concealed ovulation is an adaptation in response to a promiscuous mating system, similar to that of our closest evolutionary relatives, bonobos and chimpanzees. The theory is that concealed ovulation evolved in women to lessen paternity certainty, which would both lessen the chances of infanticide (as a father is less likely to kill offspring that might be his), and potentially increase the number of men motivated to assist her in caring for her offspring (partible paternity). This is supported by the fact that all other mammals with concealed ovulation, such as dolphins and gray langurs, are promiscuous, and that the only other ape species that have multi-male communities, as humans do, are promiscuous. It is argued that evidence such as the Coolidge effect, showing that a man does not seem to be naturally geared towards sexual mate-guarding behavior (that is, preventing other males from having access to his sexual partner), supports the conclusion that sexual monogamy (though perhaps not social monogamy and/or pair bonding) was rare in early modern humans.

===Reduced infanticide hypothesis===
This hypothesis suggests the adaptive advantage for women who had hidden estrus would be a reduction in the possibility of infanticide by men, as they would be unable to reliably identify, and kill, their rivals&#x27; offspring. This hypothesis is supported by recent studies of wild hanuman langurs, documenting concealed ovulation, and frequent matings with males outside their fertile ovulatory period. Heistermann et al. hypothesize that concealed ovulation is used by women to confuse paternity and thus reduce infanticide in primates. He explains that as ovulation is always concealed in women, men can only determine paternity (and thus decide on whether to kill the woman&#x27;s child) probabilistically, based on his previous mating frequency with her, and so he would be unable to escape the possibility that the child might be his own, even if he were aware of promiscuous matings on the woman&#x27;s part.

===Sex and reward hypothesis===

Schröder reviews a hypothesis by Symons and Hill, that after hunting, men exchanged meat for sex with women. Women who continuously mimicked estrus may have benefited from more meat than those that did not. If this occurred with enough frequency, then a definite period of estrus would have been lost, and with it sexual signaling specific to ovulation would have disappeared.

===Social-bonding hypothesis===

Schröder presents the idea of a &quot;gradual diminution of mid-cycle estrus and concomitant continuous sexual receptivity in human women&quot; because it facilitated orderly social relationships throughout the menstrual cycle by eliminating the periodic intensification of male–male aggressiveness in competition for mates. The extended estrous period of the bonobo (reproductive-age females are in heat for 75% of their menstrual cycle) has been said to have a similar effect to the lack of a &quot;heat&quot; in women. While concealed human ovulation may have evolved in this fashion, extending estrus until it was no longer a distinct period, as paralleled in the bonobo, this theory of why concealed ovulation evolved has frequently been rejected. Schröder outlines the two objections to this hypothesis: (1) natural selection would need to work at a level above the individual, which is difficult to prove; and (2) selection, because it acts on the individuals with the most reproductive success, would thus favor greater reproductive success over social integration at the expense of reproductive success.

However, since 1993 when that was written, group selection models have seen a resurgence. (See group selection, reciprocal altruism, and kin selection.)

===Cuckoldry hypothesis===

Schröder in his review writes that Benshoof and Thornhill hypothesized that estrus became hidden after monogamous relationships became the norm in &quot;Homo erectus&quot;. Concealed ovulation allowed the woman to mate secretly at times with an alternative man, and thus gain the benefit of his genes for her offspring, while still retaining the benefits of the pair bond with her usual sexual partner. Her usual sexual partner would have little reason to doubt her fidelity, because of the concealed ovulation, and would have high, albeit unfounded, paternity confidence in her offspring. His confidence would encourage him to invest his time and energy in assisting her to care for the child, even though it was not his own. Again, the idea of a man&#x27;s investment being vital to the child&#x27;s survival is a central fixture of a hypothesis regarding concealed ovulation, even as the evolutionary benefits accrue to the child, the woman, and her clandestine partner, and not to her regular sexual partner.

==As a side effect of bipedalism==
Pawlowski presents the importance of bipedalism to the mechanics and necessity of ovulation signaling. The more open savannah environment inhabited by early humans brought greater danger from predators. This would have caused humans to live in denser groups, and, in such a scenario, the long-distance sexual signaling provided by female genital swellings would have lost its function. Concealed ovulation is thus argued to be a loss of function evolutionary change rather than an adaptation. Thermoregulatory systems were also modified in humans with the move to the savannah to conserve water. It is thought that female genital swellings would have incurred added cost because of ineffective evaporation of water from the area. Pawlowski continues by saying the change to bipedalism in early hominins changed both the position of female genitals and the line of vision of males. Since males could no longer constantly see the female genitals, swelling of them during estrus as a mode of signaling would have become useless. Also, anogenital swelling at each ovulatory period may have interfered with the mechanics of bipedal locomotion, and selection may have favored females who were less hindered by this occurrence. This hypothesis ultimately concludes that bipedalism, which was strongly selected for, caused the physiological changes and a loss of function of sexual signaling through female genital swelling, leading to the concealed ovulation we now observe.

Pawlowski&#x27;s paper offers views that differ from the other hypotheses regarding concealed ovulation in that it pinpoints physiological changes in early humans as the cause of concealed ovulation rather than social or behavioral ones. One of the strengths of this is derived from the other hypotheses&#x27; weaknesses – it is difficult to track the evolution of a behavior as it leaves no verifiable evidence in the form of bone or DNA. However, the fact that the hanuman langurs also display some concealed ovulation and that it is not directly caused by a physiological change to bipedalism may suggest bipedalism was not, at least, the sole cause of concealed ovulation in humans. As stated earlier, it is possible for many elements of different hypotheses to be true regarding the selective pressures for concealed ovulation in humans.

<doc id="764894" wikidata="Q451162" url="?curid=764894" title="Theodore M. Pomeroy">
<text>Theodore Medad Pomeroy (December 31, 1824 – March 23, 1905) was an American businessman and politician from New York who served as the 26th speaker of the United States House of Representatives for one day, from March 3, 1869, to March 4, 1869, the shortest American speakership term. He represented New York&#x27;s 24th congressional district in the United States House of Representatives from 1861 to 1869. He also served as the mayor of Auburn, New York, from 1875 to 1876, and in the New York State Senate from 1878 to 1879.

==Early life and education==
Theodore Medad Pomeroy was born on December 31, 1824. He spent his childhood in Elbridge, New York, where he went to live when he was nine years old.

He was educated at the Monroe Academy and at 15, entered Hamilton College as a junior. He graduated in 1842 at age 17 and was ranked in the first division of 6 in a class of 24.

==Career==

===Legal career===
In May 1843, at the age of 18, he left his parents&#x27; home in Cayuga and moved to Auburn, where he entered the firm of Beach &amp; Underwood as a law student. William H. Seward was counsel for the firm as he had just finished serving as the Governor of New York from 1838 to 1842. Christopher Morgan and Samuel Blatchford, who later became an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, became associated with the firm. On May 23, 1846, he was admitted to practice as an attorney in the state of New York.

===Political career===
In 1847, he was elected by the Whig Party as clerk of Auburn and in 1851, he was nominated by the Whigs and was elected district attorney. He was reelected again in 1853 and served a second term. At the end of his second term he was chosen to be a Member of the New York Assembly by the Republicans to represent the second district of Cayuga and served in the legislature in 1857 but declined renomination.

In September 1860, he was nominated and elected by the Republican Party to represent the 25th congressional district, composed of the counties of Cayuga and Wayne, in the House of Representatives. On July 4, 1861, he took his seat at the extra session of the 37th Congress convened by President Abraham Lincoln, right after the start of the Civil War. He was referred to as the youngest-looking member on the floor by Washington newspaper correspondents, who described him as follows:

He was nominated by acclamation in 1862, 1864, and 1866 from the 24th congressional district which comprised the counties of Cayuga, Wayne and Seneca. On March 3, 1869, Pomeroy&#x27;s final full day in office came to a close with the 40th Congress.

====One-day Speakership (1869)====
Schuyler Colfax, who was to be sworn into office as vice president the next day, resigned as speaker of the House. Upon his resignation, the House passed a motion declaring Pomeroy, who was himself leaving Congress the next day, duly elected as speaker in place of Colfax. In office for one day, his is the shortest tenure of any speaker of the U.S. House.

====New York politics====

After leaving Congress, Pomeroy was briefly out of politics. He returned to public life in the mid-1870s and was elected mayor of Auburn, New York, serving from 1875 to 1876, then as a member of the New York State Senate (25th D.) in 1878 and 1879.

===Banking career===
After the war ended, a boom in business production and industry began around the country. In the spring of 1866, the Merchants Union Express Company was organized to transport trade and goods across the United States with Elmore P. Ross as president, William H. Seward Jr. as vice-president, John N. Knapp as secretary, William C. Beardsley as treasurer, and Pomeroy as their attorney. By October 1866, the company was transporting goods across the major U.S. railroads and by the beginning of 1867, the company operated a network of express lines across the entire United States. The huge business incurred equally huge debts and in 1868, the company was acquired and merged with the American Merchants Union, now known as the American Express Company. Pomeroy stayed on and served as first vice-president and general counsel, along with co-founder William Fargo and later with William&#x27;s brother, J. C. Fargo, in 1868.

==Personal life==
On September 4, 1855, while serving his second term as District Attorney, he married Elizabeth Leitch Watson (1835–1892), the second daughter of Robert Watson, also of Auburn. Elizabeth&#x27;s sister, Janet MacNeil Watson (1839–1913), married William H. Seward Jr. (1839–1920). Together, they had five children.

Pomeroy retired from public life in 1879 and lived at 168 Genesee Street in Auburn, where he died in 1905. Harriet Tubman (1822–1913) was a close friend of the family who helped care for the Pomeroy children. She attended his funeral and it was reported that only her flowers and letter were placed on his casket and buried with him.

===Descendants===
Pomeroy&#x27;s grandchildren include New York state senator Robert Watson Pomeroy (1902–1989), Janet Pomeroy Avery (1891–1969), who married John Foster Dulles (1888–1959), the U.S. secretary of state during the Eisenhower administration, and Josephine Herrick (1897–1972), photographer and teacher.

His great-grandchildren include John W. F. Dulles (1913–2008), a professor of history and specialist in Brazil at the University of Texas at Austin, Lillias Dulles Hinshaw (1914–1987), a Presbyterian minister, and Avery Dulles (1918–2008), who converted to Roman Catholicism, entered the Jesuit order, and became the first American theologian to be appointed a cardinal.

<text>The Royal Hawaiian Band is the oldest and only full-time municipal band in the United States. At present a body of the City &amp; County of Honolulu, the Royal Hawaiian Band has been entertaining Honolulu residents and visitors since its inception in 1836 by Kamehameha III. During the monarchy it was nominally a military band. It reached global prominence under the leadership of Prussian Heinrich &quot;Henri&quot; Berger, an officer of the imperial German army loaned to the Kingdom of Hawaii in 1872. Berger composed many beloved marching tunes and other melodies, and would later be honored with the title of &quot;Father of Hawaiian Music.&quot; He collaborated with King Kalākaua in creating &quot;Hawaii Ponoi,&quot; the national anthem of Hawaii; it is still used today as the official state song.

During its long and distinguished history, the Royal Hawaiian band inspired the development of other brass bands in Hawaii, and possibly elsewhere in Polynesia and the Pacific. According to researcher Patrick Hennessey, the band may even be credited for originally introducing Hawaii&#x27;s song &quot;Aloha &#x27;Oe&quot; to the United States mainland.

, the Royal Hawaiian Band is composed of 40 full-time musicians under the baton of Bandmaster Clarke Bright, previously conducted by Michael Nakasone. The band performs every Friday at noon on the grass grounds of the historic Iolani Palace in downtown Honolulu and on Sundays at one o&#x27;oclock at the Kapiolani Park Bandstand in Waikiki.

<text>Gavriil Kharitonovich Popov (; born 31 October 1936), anglicised as Gabriel Popov, is a Russian politician and economist. He served as the mayor of Moscow from 1991 until he resigned in 1992.

==Biography==
Born to a Greek family in Moscow, Popov graduated Moscow Lomonosov University in political economy. He joined the Soviet Communist Party in 1959 and served as a secretary of the Komsomol committee of his university. Popov remained at the faculty of economics as a graduate student, then docent, and in 1978 became dean of the faculty. Yegor Gaidar, who would become Prime Minister of Russia, was one of his students.

During Perestroika Popov became heavily involved in politics. On June 12, 1991, he became the first democratically elected mayor of Moscow. In 1990, he left the CPSU, following Boris Yeltsin&#x27;s lead at the 28th Congress. He resigned in 1992 and was replaced by the vice-mayor, Yury Luzhkov. In January 2010, he and Luzhkov published an article highly critical of Yegor Gaidar.

After 1992, Popov returned to academia. He is now president of the International University in Moscow.

<text>Charles Alexandre Lesueur (; 1 January 1778 in Le Havre – 12 December 1846 in Le Havre) was a French naturalist, artist, and explorer. He was a prolific natural-history collector, gathering many type specimens in Australia, Southeast Asia, and North America, and was also responsible for describing numerous species, including the spiny softshell turtle (&quot;Apalone spinifera&quot;), smooth softshell turtle (&quot;A. mutica&quot;), and common map turtle (&quot;Graptemys geographica&quot;). Both Mount Lesueur and Lesueur National Park in Western Australia are named in his honor.

==Early life==
Charles Alexandre Lesueur was born on January 1, 1778, to Jean-Baptiste Denis Lesueur and Charlotte Thieullent. Charlotte died when Charles was sixteen years old, and Charles&#x27; maternal grandmother took care of him and his siblings. Charles attended the Collège du Havre and possibly the Ecole publique des mathématiques et d&#x27;hydrographie. He was in military service in a cadet battalion at age fifteen and was in the National Guard of Le Havre from 1797 to 1799. He joined the French Marines or Navy but was discharged for medical reasons. He then joined Nicolas Baudin&#x27;s expedition, nominally as a gunner on the ship &quot;Géographe&quot;.

==Career==
In 1801, Lesueur traveled to Australia on the expedition of Nicolas Baudin, assuming the duties of expedition artist alongside Nicolas-Martin Petit when the erstwhile appointed artists disembarked in France. With François Péron, he took over the duties as naturalist after the death of the expedition&#x27;s zoologist René Maugé. Together, they collected over 100,000 zoological specimens. In 1802, he made the only known sketches of the King Island emu in its natural habitat (the bird became extinct in 1822).

Between May 1816 and early 1837, he lived and traveled widely in the United States, particularly in Tennessee, Kentucky, and Missouri. He was elected a member of the American Philosophical Society in 1817. In 1833, he visited Vincennes, Indiana, where he sketched the first known drawing of Grouseland, the mansion of William Henry Harrison. The mansion is today a National Historic Landmark.
 
From 1826 to 1837, Lesueur was based in New Harmony, Indiana, where he filled sketchbooks full of the finds discovered during the utopian adventure funded by his friend and former employer, American geologist William Maclure. He arrived in the boat &quot;Philanthropist&quot; (which he also sketched) with other intellectuals who came to live in the small town of New Harmony, on the Wabash River. He took research trips (including series of six flat-boat trips to New Orleans) and sketched people, small towns, and scenes continuously. He was in New Harmony when Prince Maximilian, Prince of Wied-Neuweid, Germany, and artist Karl Bodmer came to spend five months there in 1832–1833. Prince Maximilian said of Lesueur, &quot;He had explored the country in many directions, was acquainted with everything remarkable, collected and prepared all interesting objects, and had already sent considerable collections to France.&quot; Indeed, Lesueur sent specimens of unique fish, animals, and fossils, as well as artifacts he had dug from the Indian Mounds in New Harmony, back to France, where they remain.

Lesueur returned to France in 1837, only after his friends Thomas Say and Joseph Barabino had died and William MacClure had returned to Philadelphia, accompanied by many of his fine books. He had spent 21 years in the United States, but continued his scholarly studies and activities in France, where he resumed his occupation of artist-naturalist and began to catalogue his extensive research and artwork. At last, he was awarded the honor of Chevalier de l’Ordre Royal de la Légion d&#x27;honneur for his long years of work in the sciences.

In March 1846, Lesueur was appointed curator of the Musée d&#x27;Histoire Naturelle du Havre. Nine months later, he died suddenly (12 December 1846) and was buried at Le Havre. In the 1900s, his work was finally published by the museum, totaling over 60 books, including reports of his zoological, geological, historical, and archaeological research, as well as studies of his life.
Pictured here is the oil portrait by Charles Willson Peale of Lesueur. The original hangs in the reading room of the Ewell Sale Stewart Library in the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia.

==Eponyms==
One species of frog, two species of lizards, and a species of jellyfish were named in honour of Lesueur (the last also honoring François Péron, also of the Baudin expedition):

*&quot;Litoria lesueurii&quot; – Lesueur&#x27;s frog (Hylidae)
*&quot;Amalosia lesueurii&quot; – Lesueur&#x27;s velvet gecko (Diplodactylidae)
*&quot;Intellagama lesueurii&quot; – eastern water dragon (Agamidae)

<text>Rend al-Rahim Francke (born 1949) is an Iraqi political activist who often appears on various current affairs programs. She held the position as Iraqi ambassador to the United States. She is considered to be a secularist trying to enable Iraq to transition to a liberal democratic model.

== Personal life ==
Francke was born in Baghdad to an affluent family and spent some of her childhood there. Her father is a Shiite Muslim and her mother is a Sunni Muslim. She went to boarding school in England and later studied at Cambridge University where she earned a master&#x27;s degree in English and at the Sorbonne. She worked as a banker and a currency trader in Lebanon and Bahrain, as well as London. Her family moved to England in 1978 and later emigrated again, this time to the United States in 1981. She became an American citizen in 1987.

Rend is married and has one child.

== Politics and advocacy ==
In 1991, Francke established the Iraq Foundation in Washington, D.C., to lobby for democracy, human rights and regime change in Iraq. In her role as executive director she represented the foundation with government and non-government institutions, including speaking before Congress to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

Francke has been an ally of the Bush administration in its Iraq foreign policy and is sympathetic of its neoconservative foreign policy. She is quite liberal though with respect to domestic policy. A staunch secularist, she did not cover her hair when she was ambassador for Iraq and continues to oppose fundamentalist politics in Iraq. She was part of the Committee for the Liberation of Iraq which was set up to lobby Congress to pursue the administration&#x27;s goal of invading Iraq and removing Saddam Hussein from power.
In 2002 she testified in front of the United States Senate Foreign Relations Committee and emphasized the long-term commitment needed to rebuild Iraq. She promoted &#x27;Nation Building&#x27;, emphasizing law and order as well as the prevention of retribution. In particular she did not want a repeat of the Afghanistan operation where the United States minimized its immediate efforts in its rebuilding after the fall of the Taliban, calling such an operation, &quot;a hit-and-run&quot;. She also thought it unlikely that Iraq would break up into three components.

Francke was appointed to the position of Iraqi ambassador to the United States on November 23, 2003. This was very unusual given that she was also a United States citizen. However, in October 2004 she was forced to resign due to American pressure for various reasons. They included the fact that she had made critical comments over U.S. handling of post-war Iraq in testimony to Congress and on TV interviews, that she was a cousin and close associate of Ahmed Chalabi, then under investigation for leaking intelligence to Iran, and for her apparent refusal to lead a delegation on a visit to wounded U.S. troops at Walter Reed Army Hospital.

In 2004, she was a guest of Laura Bush in the First Lady&#x27;s Box at the State of the Union address. The Iraq Foundation (an organization she co-founded) itself help set up the Iraq-America Freedom Alliance which has tried to stress the positive impacts of the American invasion and occupation of Iraq. It describes its mission as publicizing &quot;the stories of Iraqis and Americans who are building a secure, stable and democratic future in Iraq.&quot; She has said that she is disappointed with the post-war reconstruction effort, especially the initial lack of planning. However she continues to support the administration and its policies particularly as they have grown more determined to stabilize Iraq and has confidence that the US administration can be successful. On April 27, 2007, she appeared on the &quot;O&#x27;Reilly Factor&quot; and argued strongly for the United States&#x27; presence in Iraq.

== Views ==
Francke is a supporter of the United States and the Bush administration, but also has heavily criticized its role, which many believe led to her resignation. Moreover, Francke also criticized the role of Iraqis towards the United States. In a recent interview conducted by the Greater Good Science Center, Francke said, &quot; I think there&#x27;s a great deal of negligence. It&#x27;s not evil; its negligence and insensitivity..and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s possible to keep a healthy relationship unless you show that you care about a person, or a group of people, on a continuing basis.&quot; Francke claims that sympathy and empathy on both sides are needed if Iraq is to be repaired. She concludes, &quot;It is all a question of showing that you care about the other, that you&#x27;re in a partnership - not a relationship of occupier and occupied. You&#x27;re not in a relationship where it&#x27;s the all-powerful and the powerless.&quot;

<doc id="764912" wikidata="Q336071" url="?curid=764912" title="Arthur Porritt, Baron Porritt">
<text>Colonel Arthur Espie Porritt, Baron Porritt, (10 August 1900 – 1 January 1994) was a New Zealand physician, military surgeon, statesman and athlete. He won a bronze medal at the 1924 Summer Olympics in the 100 m sprint. He served as the 11th governor-general of New Zealand from 1967 to 1972.

==Early life==
Porritt was born in Whanganui, New Zealand, the son of Ivy Elizabeth Porritt (née McKenzie) and Ernest Edward Porritt, a doctor. His mother died in 1914 during his first year at the Wanganui Collegiate School, and his father left soon after to serve in World War I. He became a keen athlete.

In 1920 Porritt began studying towards a medical degree at the University of Otago where he was a resident at Selwyn College and President of the Selwyn College Students&#x27; Association. In 1923 Porritt was awarded a Rhodes Scholarship, and he studied medicine from 1924 to 1926 at Magdalen College, Oxford.

==Sporting career==
Porritt represented New Zealand at the 1924 Summer Olympics in Paris, France, where he won a bronze medal in the 100 metre dash; the winner was Harold Abrahams (1899–1978). The race took place at 7 pm on 7 July 1924. Abrahams and Porritt dined together at 7 pm on 7 July every year thereafter, until Abrahams&#x27; death. The race was later immortalised in the film &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot;, but due to Porritt&#x27;s modesty his name was changed to &quot;Tom Watson&quot;. He also won two qualifying races in the 200 m, but did not advance in the semi-final. Porritt was captain of the New Zealand team at the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam but withdrew from the 100 m because of an injury.

Porritt is only one of two people to have the rare honour of twice being the New Zealand flag bearer at Olympic Games, the other being Les Mills.

After retirement from athletics, Porritt was New Zealand&#x27;s team manager at the 1934 British Empire Games in London and 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin. Porritt was the New Zealand member of the International Olympic Committee from 1934 until he was appointed governor-general in 1967. He was the first President of the IOC Medical Commission and served from 1961 to 1967.

Porritt served as chairman of the British Empire and Commonwealth Games Federation from the 1950 Auckland games to the 1966 Kingston games.

==Medical and military career==
Porritt became a house surgeon at St Mary&#x27;s Hospital, London, in 1926 and later that year was appointed surgeon to the Prince of Wales, the future King Edward VIII.

On 8 March 1940, Porritt was commissioned a lieutenant in the Royal Army Medical Corps with the service number 125494. He served in France until the evacuation from Dunkirk, then in Egypt, operating on seriously wounded soldiers from the North African campaign, and later landing in Normandy on D-Day. A war-substantive major by February 1943, he was granted the temporary rank of lieutenant colonel and the acting rank of colonel later that year; on 18 December 1943, he was appointed a consultant surgeon with the local rank of brigadier. He relinquished this position and his brigadier&#x27;s rank on 1 September 1945, by which time he was a war-substantive lieutenant colonel. He ended his military career in September 1956, with the honorary rank of colonel in the Territorial Army.

Porritt was King&#x27;s Surgeon to George VI from 1946 to 1952, and was Serjeant Surgeon to Queen Elizabeth II until 1967.

In 1955 Porritt was called to Eastbourne by the suspected serial killer John Bodkin Adams, to operate on his patient Jack Hullett for colon cancer. The operation was a moderate success but the death of Hullett under Adams&#x27; supervision a few months later followed soon after by the death of his wife Bobby, led to Adams being put on trial for Bobby&#x27;s murder in 1957. He was acquitted but is suspected in up to 163 deaths.

Porritt was twice president of the Hunterian Society (once in 1951) and became president in 1960 of both the British Medical Association and the Royal College of Surgeons of England, the first person to hold the two positions simultaneously, and retained the presidency of the RCS until 1963.

In 1966 Porritt was elected president for two years of the Royal Society of Medicine but served only one year before leaving for New Zealand.

==Honours==
Porritt was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1943, and promoted to Commander (CBE) in 1945. He was decorated as an Officer of the US Legion of Merit on 14 November 1947. He was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of Saint Michael and Saint George (KCMG) in 1950, and was promoted to Knight Grand Cross (GCMG) in 1967. In 1957 he was appointed a Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (KCVO), being promoted to Knight Grand Cross (GCVO) in 1970. He was also made a Knight of the Order of St John of Jerusalem (KStJ) in 1957.

Porritt was created a Baronet of Hampstead on 25 January 1963. When he was elevated to be a Life Peer on 5 February 1973, he chose to honour his home town and was created Baron Porritt, of Wanganui in New Zealand and of Hampstead in Greater London.

==Governor-General==

In 1967 Porritt returned to New Zealand to be appointed by the Queen on the advice of Prime Minister Keith Holyoake as the 11th Governor-General of New Zealand, and the first to be born in New Zealand. His term marked a turning point in the country&#x27;s constitutional history: his successors have all been New Zealanders (although one of his predecessors, Lord Freyberg, moved to New Zealand when he was two). An earlier Gallup poll for the &quot;Auckland Star&quot; newspaper found 43 per cent of respondents preferred Britons for the role, while 41 per cent favoured New Zealanders and 6 per cent candidates from other Commonwealth countries. Newspapers at the time welcomed the appointment, the &quot;Greymouth Star&quot; saying that it was &quot;an acknowledgement of New Zealand&#x27;s maturity.&quot;

===Controversies===
Prior to the 1969 general election in September of that year, Porritt sparked a heated debate with a Labour candidate Eddie Isbey when he argued in a speech to the Southern Cross Medical Care Society that the welfare state was &quot;uneconomic&quot;.

Later, Porritt&#x27;s wife also created controversy, when she replied to a question on equal pay for women by stating: &quot;Perhaps when New Zealand, like India and Israel, produces a woman prime minister it will be time to call a halt to the emancipation movement&quot;.

At his last Waitangi Day speech in 1972, Porritt caused more controversy by stating that: &quot;Maori-Pakeha relationships are being dealt with adequately through the biological process of intermarriage.&quot;

At the end of his term in September 1972 Porritt returned to England.

===Memorials===
In Christchurch, New Zealand, a park was named Porritt Park in the suburb of Wainoni. The park surrounded by the Avon River / Ōtākaro became home to Canterbury Hockey, Canterbury Rowing, Canterbury Touch Rugby and also used as a venue for Cricket. Porritt Primary School in Napier opened in 1975, named in honour of his service to New Zealand. He has also a dedication of a running track in Hamilton, New Zealand named Porritt Stadium.

===Freemasonry===
Porritt was initiated in Oxford University&#x27;s Apollo University Lodge No. 357 on 13 June 1925, and later joined other English Constitution lodges, including Sancta Maria Lodge No. 2682 (a medical practitioners&#x27; lodge), Prince of Wales&#x27;s Lodge No. 259 (a so-called &#x27;red apron&#x27; lodge as it nominates one of the 19 Grand Stewards each year, who wear red aprons), and Royal Alpha Lodge No. 16 (membership of which is at the personal invitation of the Grand Master).

During his term as Governor-General (1968–1971), Porritt served as Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of New Zealand.

==Death==
Lord Porritt died in London at the age of 93 on 1 January 1994. His wife died in 1998. His son is Jonathon Porritt, a well-known environmental activist.

<text>The Penguin anti-ship missile, designated AGM-119 by the U.S. military, is a Norwegian passive IR seeker-based short-to-medium range anti-ship guided missile, designed for naval use.

==Overview==
Penguin was originally developed in a collaboration between the Norwegian Defence Research Establishment (NDRE; Norw. &quot;FFI&quot;) and Kongsberg Våpenfabrikk starting in the early 1960s, with financial support from the U.S. and West Germany. US Navy test facilities and technical assistance were made available to facilitate development. It was the first NATO anti-shipping missile with an IR seeker instead of the commonly used active radar seeker. Both hardware and software have been updated since entering series production in 1972.

Initial installation was in deck-mounted box launchers with snap-open doors. These were designed for minimal deck intrusion, allowing them to be retrofitted to existing small ships. The first such installations were on Snøgg-class and Storm-class patrol boats of the Norwegian Navy. The first airborne installations were on F-104Gs of the Norwegian Air Force, the missiles being fitted to standard Bullpup rails on the two underwing hardpoints.

Fire-control was provided by a Kongsberg SM-3 computer which could cue the missiles based on either active radar or passive ESM data.

The Penguin can be fired singly or in coordinated-arrival salvoes. Once launched the launching craft is free to turn away as the missile is inertially guided until the autonomous terminal homing phase. Propelled by a solid rocket engine, latest variants of Penguin can perform random weaving manoeuvres at target approach and strike the target close to the waterline. It can perform a terminal bunt and weave manoeuvre. The warhead (originally based on that of the AGM-12 Bullpup, built under license by Kongsberg) detonates inside the target ship by using a delay fuze. The MK3, when launched from high altitudes, can initially act as a glidebomb, only firing its rocket engine to extend range, or ideally to achieve maximum speed before hitting the target; for better penetration.


In its various versions, the Penguin can be launched from a number of different weapons platforms:
* Surface vessels: Missile boats (its initial application) as well as larger ships
* Fighter aircraft: certified for F-16
* Helicopters (certified for the following aircraft):
**Bell 412 SP
**Kaman SH-2 Seasprite
**Sikorsky SH-60 Seahawk/MH-60 Seahawk
**Westland Super Lynx

KDA&#x27;s successor to the Penguin is the Naval Strike Missile (NSM), offered from 2007 onwards. NSM features an imaging IR-seeker, GPS navigation, a turbojet sustainer engine (for much longer ranges, or more), and significantly more computer performance and digital signal processing power.

Penguin missiles were donated to Ukraine in May 2022.

== Operators ==

<doc id="764920" wikidata="Q730282" url="?curid=764920" title="Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center">
<text>The Yuri A. Gagarin State Scientific Research-and-Testing Cosmonaut Training Center (GCTC; Russian: Центр подготовки космонавтов имени Ю. А. Гагарина) is a Russian training facility responsible for training cosmonauts for their space missions. It is in Star City of Moscow Oblast, a name which may refer to the facility itself or to its grounds.

==Formation==

The facility was originally known only as Military Unit 26266 or в/ч 26266, and was a secret training base for Soviet Cosmonaut candidates. The site was chosen for its proximity to Moscow and other infrastructure that would be essential for its function: Chkalovsky Airport, and the Yaroslavl railroad. The densely forested area was originally a radar range with some existing infrastructure.

Military doctor Colonel Yevgeny Karpov was appointed as the first chief of the cosmonaut training centre or &quot;Tsentr Podgotovki Kosmonavtov&quot; (TsPK) on 24 February 1960. The centre was home to approximately 250 personnel divided into various departments who were responsible for the development of all aspects of the space program ranging from equipment to the well-being of the cosmonauts. These included specialists in heat exchange and hygiene, survival clothing, surgery, and training staff. Initially cosmonaut candidates were housed at the nearby Frunze Central Airfield (Moscow), followed by an apartment block in Chkalovsky before eventually moving to the newly built apartments on site where they would remain with their families throughout training.

==Civilian administration==
Until April 2009 the center was owned and operated by the Ministry of Defence (Russia) in cooperation with Russian Federal Space Agency. In April 2009, Russia President Dmitry Medvedev signed a presidential decree transferring the center from the Defence Ministry to the Russian Federal Space Agency (Roskosmos).

==Key infrastructure==
The facility contains infrastructure essential for the training of cosmonauts across a wide range of experiences, including simulating g-loads, mission specific/suit training, medical observation/testing and astronavigation.

Key GCTC facilities include:
*Full-size mockups of all major spacecraft developed since the Soviet era, including the Soyuz and Buran vehicles, the TKS modules and orbital stations of the Salyut Program, Mir, and ISS. These were co-existing or with time replaced one another inside two main training hangar halls of the center. Room 1 houses the Salyut 4, 6, Mir (Don-17KS) with Kvant (Don-37KE), Kvant 2 (Don-77KSD) and Kristall (Don-77KST) modules and a Soyuz 2 descent module simulators. Room 1A houses the Soyuz simulators (Don-7ST3 -old STK-7ST - for the Soyuz TMA; TDK-7ST4 - old TDK-7TS2 for Soyouz TM - for the Soyuz TMM; Don-732M modified for Soyuz TM and the Pilot 732 - for the TORU docking system). Other rooms house the Salyut 7, Spektr (Don-77KSO), Priroda (Don-77KSI), Buran, &quot;Zarya&quot; and &quot;Zvezda&quot; simulators.
*Zero-gravity training aircraft for simulating weightlessness (cf. Vomit Comet), including the MiG-15 UTI, Tupolev Tu-104 and later the IL-76 MDK with internal volume of . Training aircraft are based at the Russian Air Force base at Chkalovskiy airfield.
*A Medical observation clinic and testing facility.
*The original office of Yuri Gagarin and a number of monuments and busts to him and other cosmonauts.

==Heads of the CTC ==
* Yevgeny Karpov (1960–1963)
* Mikhail Odintsov (1963)
* Nikolay Kuznetsov (1963–1972)
* Georgy Beregovoy* (1972–1987)

<doc id="764925" wikidata="Q679603" url="?curid=764925" title="Baron Franz von der Trenck">
<text>Baron Franz von der Trenck (German: &quot;Franz Freiherr von der Trenck&quot;, Croatian: &quot;Barun Franjo Trenk&quot;) (Reggio di Calabria. January 1, 1711 – Brno. October 4, 1749) was an Austrian soldier whose unit is considered one of the worst in modern European history, and which was a law unto itself, taking property, livestock, and women as the unit saw fit.

==Early life==
Trenck was born into a military noble family which originated from Pomerania on 1 January 1711, in Reggio in south Italy, where his father Johann Heinrich von der Trenck served as an Austrian officer. Although born in Italy, Trenk was actually a Prussian, but was an Austrian subject with large estates in Croatia, more precisely Slavonia. He spent his childhood mostly in Italy, Slavonia, and Hungary, which was not unusual since his father&#x27;s job required frequent relocation. He was educated by the Jesuits at Ödenburg.

==Military career==
Trenck entered the Imperial Army in 1728 but resigned in disgrace three years later and decided to live peacefully in Požega. He married and lived on his estate for a few years. Upon the death of his wife who had perished in the Great Plague of 1738, he offered to raise an irregular corps of pandurs for service against the Turks, but this offer was refused, after which he entered the Imperial Russian Army as a mercenary. In Russia, he met and befriended Ernst Gideon von Laudon. However, after serving against the Turks and Tatars during the Russo-Turkish War for a short time as captain and major of cavalry, he was accused of bad conduct, brutality, and disobedience and condemned to death. Despite showing insubordination, he had gained popularity for defying an order to retreat. His sentence was commuted by Field Marshal Münnich to degradation and imprisonment.

After a time Trenck returned to Austria, where his father was governor of a small fortress, but there he came into conflict with everyone and actually took sanctuary in a convent in Vienna. Prince Charles Alexander of Lorraine, interesting himself in this strange man, obtained for him an amnesty and a commission in a corps of irregulars. In this command, besides his usual truculence and bad manners, he displayed conspicuous personal bravery, and in spite of the general dislike into which his vices brought him his services were so valuable that he was promoted to lieutenant colonel (1743) and colonel (1744).

Trenck earned most of his fame during the War of the Austrian Succession, as the leader and commander of a unit of pandurs, or paramilitary troops in the Imperial Army which specialized in frontier warfare, guerrilla tactics, and surprise hit-and-run actions, into which he recruited mostly Croatian mercenaries, experienced fighters from the Austro-Ottoman Military Frontier. Trenck&#x27;s Pandurs soon became infamous for the atrocities they committed on the civilian population, some actions deemed brutal even by the standards of the day.

When the War of the Austrian Succession broke out Trenck rallied volunteers and marched for Vienna to assist Maria Theresa. While in Vienna, Trenck&#x27;s Pandurs marched the streets before invading Prussia. At the Battle of Soor, he and his irregulars plundered when they should have been fighting and Trenck was accused of having allowed King Frederick the Great himself to escape.

==Imprisonment and death==
After a time he was brought before a court-martial in Vienna, which convicted him of having sold and withdrawn commissions to his officers without the permission of the empress, having punished his men without heed of the military code, and having drawn pay and allowance for fictitious men. Much was allowed to an irregular officer in all these respects, but Trenck had far outrun the admitted limits, and above all his brutalities and robberies had made him detested throughout Austria and Silesia. A death sentence followed, but the composition of the court-martial and its proceedings were thought to have been such as from the first forbade a fair trial as such, though most modern historians think the sentence to have been correct, even so. Nonetheless, concerns about the apparently arbitrary form of the proceedings meant that eventually the sentence was commuted by the Empress into one of cashiering and imprisonment. The rest of his life was spent in mild captivity in the fortress of Spielberg () in Brno, where he died on October 4, 1749. In his last will, he left the sum of 30,000 florins to the small town of Marienburg which had been sacked, burned, and razed to the ground by his troops.

Trenck&#x27;s mummified remains can presently be seen on display in the crypt of Brno&#x27;s Capuchin Monastery.

==Notes==
* Although Baron Trenck was not an ethnic Croat, even now there is phrase in Germany: &quot;Wir sind Kroaten, wir sind panduren&quot;, (&quot;We are Croats; we are Pandours&quot;), because many of his pandurs were Croatians.
* Franz is the first cousin of Friedrich Freiherr von der Trenck, who was serving in the Prussian Army. During the wars in Silesia, they were on different sides and Friedrich was imprisoned out of alleged conspiracy with Franz.
* Mark Twain included Baron Trenck in an ironic list of Tom Sawyer&#x27;s &quot;heroes&quot; in &quot;Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&quot;.
* His story was the basis for the 1911 operetta &quot;Baron Trenck&quot; by Felix Albini, Alfred Maria Willner, and Robert Bodanzky.

<doc id="764927" wikidata="Q284780" url="?curid=764927" title="Turpan Depression">
<text>The Turpan Depression or Turfan Depression, is a fault-bounded trough located around and south of the city-oasis of Turpan, in the Xinjiang Autonomous Region in far Western China, about southeast of the regional capital Ürümqi. It includes Lake Ayding, , the second or third lowest depression on Earth. 
By some measures, it is also the hottest and driest area in China during the summer.

==Geology and relief==
The Turpan Basin is a fault-bounded trough located in the eastern part of the Tian Shan. It covers an area of . The surrounding mountain ranges are: the central Tian Shan in the west, the Bogda Shan in the north-west, the Haerlike Shan in the north-west, and the Jueluotage Shan in the south. Beyond the surrounding mountain ranges lie the Junggar Basin in the north and the Tarim Basin in the south.

Some geographers also use the term Turpan-Hami Basin, which is understood as including the Turpan Depression along with the Hami Depression (located to the east of the Turpan Depression, and to the southwest of the city of Hami) and the Liaodong Uplift separating the two depressions. A source using this terminology gave the area of the Turpan Depression proper as , that of the Hami Depression as , and for the entire Turpan-Hami Basin, as .

The Turpan Basin formed in a shear zone during the Late Permian due to motion between the East European and the Angaran craton. It was subsequently deformed by the collision of the Indian Plate and Eurasian Plate in the Cenozoic. In the latter deformation, a thrust fault belt running from east to west, the Flaming Mountains, was formed in the center of the basin. The Flaming Mountains are long and wide; the highest peak reaches an elevation of above sea level. The Turfan volcano is located near Turpan.

Also in the center of the basin lies the Ayding Lake (Moonlight Lake) which has an elevation of below sea level, the sixth lowest exposed elevation on the Earth&#x27;s land surface. It is the lowest surface point in China.

The Shihongtan uranium ore deposit is located at the southwestern margin of the Turpan Depression, some south-southwest from Turpan City.

==History of human settlement==

The ancient city of Gaochang was a key point on the ancient Silk Road and dates back to the 1st century BC. It was burnt down in wars in the 14th century. The Bezeklik Thousand Buddha Caves, which are located in the Flaming Mountains&#x27; Mutou Valley, about east of the city of Turpan, have been hewn into the rock from the Tang dynasty–era up to the time of the Yuan dynasty (13th century). The caves are famous for their murals, which can still be found in about 40 of the 77 known caves. The desert climate has favored preservation of the content of the Astana-Karakhoja ancient tombs, which are located about 6 km from the ancient city of Gaochang. The tombs are the burial place for nobles, officials, and others who were interred there from the times of the Western Jin dynasty until the middle of the Tang dynasty era.

The modern city of Turpan has a population of 242,000, of whom 71% are Uyghur. For water, the city relies on wells and traditional &quot;karez&quot; (meaning &quot;well&quot; in the local Uyghur language).

==Climate==
The Turpan Basin has a harsh, continental desert climate (Koppen &quot;BWk&quot;) in which the precipitation is far less than the potential evaporation. At Turpan City, July is the hottest month with a 24-hour average temperature of and January the coldest with a 24-hour average temperature of . Monthly rainfall is highest in June, at and lowest in February and April, at . The annual average precipitation is only , falling on only 13 days per year. In contrast to this, the potential annual evaporation rate reaches . Because of its climate, the area is sometimes counted as one of the &quot;Furnaces of China&quot;, although the locations included under this heading vary.

==Vegetation and agriculture==
On the shores of Aydingkol Lake, reeds, tamarisks, saxauls, as well as other shrubs and weeds can be found. Away from sources of water, the Turpan Basin is not covered by vegetation. Consequently, agriculture is limited to oasis and depends on a sophisticated irrigation system known as the &quot;Karez System&quot;. The irrigation water comes from the surrounding mountain ranges, in particular from the annual melting of the snow. The Karez System consists of wells, underground channels, ground canals, and small reservoirs, which use the natural slope of the terrain to sustain the water flow and guide the water right to the plants while minimizing evaporation all along the way. The historical record of the system extends back to the Han dynasty. The number of Karez systems in the area is slightly below one thousand and the total length of the canals is about in length. The Karez System is therefore considered one of the three great ancient projects in China along with the Great Wall and the Grand Canal. Recently, development of groundwater through tubewells has led to a general fall in water tables, and many karez systems have failed. Farming in the Turpan Basin is particularly famous for its fruit. Because of the dry and hot conditions, the fruits grown in the depression have very high concentrations of sugar. They are traditionally processed by drying in open drying barns. The cultivated fruit include: mulberry, peach, apricot, apple, pomegranate, pear, fig, walnut, as well as grapes, watermelons and true melons. Among the fruit, the grapes stand out: more than 100 varieties of grape are cultivated in the area and it accounts for 90% of China&#x27;s seedless grape crop. Other specialty agricultural products of the region are Donghu Hami melons and long-staple cotton.

<doc id="764931" wikidata="Q3140169" url="?curid=764931" title="Hawaii Symphony">
<text>The Hawaiʻi Symphony Orchestra, formerly known as Honolulu Symphony Orchestra, was founded in 1900. It is the second oldest orchestra in the USA west of the Rocky Mountains. The orchestra now plays mainly at the Hawaii Theatre Center and occasionally the Neal S. Blaisdell Concert Hall in Honolulu. Dane Lam is the current Music Director, having assumed the post in July 2023. 

The orchestra was originally housed in a clubhouse on the slopes of Punchbowl. From 1996 to 2004, the orchestra was under the direction of conductor Samuel Wong. In August 2007, Andreas Delfs, became principal conductor of the orchestra. He led seven concerts per season in the orchestra&#x27;s Halekulani Masterworks series. JoAnn Falletta, artistic advisor to the orchestra from 2010, now holds the title of Conductor Emerita. Ignace Jang is the current concertmaster.

Previous music directors included Fritz Hart, George Barati, Robert La Marchina, and Donald Johanos.

In 2014, the Hawaiʻi Symphony Orchestra debuted its popular series musicthatPOPS, featuring Broadway music, Disney in Concert, Cirque de la Symphonie and Zelda in Concert, among others.

==History==
The symphony has undergone a series of transformations over the course of its first century. It has endured two World Wars, the Great Depression, financial crises, and changing musical and cultural fashions.

On October 30, 2009, the Honolulu Symphony Society&#x27;s board of directors voted to file for Chapter 11 protection. On November 6, 2009, the symphony announced the cancellation of concerts for the remainder of the 2009–2010 season. The organization said it was $1 million in debt and did not have enough money to support operations into November and beyond.

In 2010, facing a multimillion-dollar deficit, the symphony disbanded under Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, but was revived the next year under the new name &quot;Hawaiʻi Symphony Orchestra&quot; by a group of Honolulu businessmen. JoAnn Falletta was appointed artistic director, and Steven Monder, former director of the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra, was appointed president.

In May 2010, the symphony&#x27;s leaders said their goal was to decrease annual expenses to $4 million, from $8 million previously. The symphony&#x27;s 40-performance calendar would also be cut in half, with performances at smaller venues and different ticket prices, aiming to fill all seats with paying customers. The symphony was given an October 15 deadline to file its Chapter 11 plan of reorganization. In December 2010 it was announced that the symphony would be liquidated under Chapter 7 and end operations after 110 years.

In April 2011, a group of Hawaiʻi businesspeople called the Symphony Exploratory Committee announced efforts to revive the symphony. The committee bought out the symphony&#x27;s assets, and negotiated a new three-year contract with the musicians, planning to open a new season in fall of 2011.

<text>Manuel Gregorio Tavárez Ropero (November 16, 1843 – July 1, 1883), was a Puerto Rican classical and danza composer. He has been called &quot;The Chopin of America&quot;.

==Early years==
Tavárez was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico, the son of a French father and a Puerto Rican mother. San Juan was the city where he first began his musical studies. His first musical mentors were José Cabrizas and Domingo Delgado. Tavárez was a student of Gonzalo de J. Núñez (1850 – 1915), whose students also included the internationally known musicians and composers Juan Morel Campos and Arístides Chavier Arévalo. Tavárez became an accomplished pianist at an early age. He was able to enroll and study music in the Music Conservatory of Paris at the age of 15 with a scholarship granted by &quot;The Economic Society of Friends of Puerto Rico&quot; (La Sociedad Económica Amigos del Pais). Tavárez studied under the guidance of Auber and D&#x27;Albert. While in France, Tavárez suffered a stroke which left his hand partially paralyzed.

Tavárez returned to Puerto Rico because of his health problems. He settled down in Ponce where he gave piano lessons. He was able to overcome his health problems and began to put on musical concerts of his compositions.

==&quot;Father of the Puerto Rican Danza&quot;==
Tavárez is considered to be Puerto Rico&#x27;s first Romantic era composer. He also composed music in other genres as well. Among his best known works was the funeral march &quot;Redención&quot; (Redemption), dedicated to the memory of José Campeche; the rhapsody &quot;Souvenir de Puerto Rico&quot;, and his danzas &quot;Recuerdos de Antaño&quot; (Remembrance of Yesteryear) and what is considered his greatest work, the danza &quot;Margarita&quot;. The music created by Tavárez would always be recognized as an integral part of Puerto Rican culture. Tavárez is known as the &quot;Father of the Puerto Rican Danza&quot;. Among his most distinguished disciples was the composer Juan Morel Campos. His daughter Elisa Tavárez would also become an accomplished pianist.

==Death==
Manuel Gregorio Tavárez Ropero died on July 1, 1883, in the city of Ponce, Puerto Rico. He was 39 years old.

==Selection of Danzas by Tavárez==

The following is a list of some of Tavárez&#x27;s Danzas:
*La Sensitiva (The sensitive one)
*La Margarita
*Recuerdos de Antaño (Remembrance of Yesteryear)
*Redención (Redemption)
*Souvener de Puerto Rico
*Un Recuerdito (A small remembrance)

==Honors and recognitions==

<text>Carl Otto Lampland (December 29, 1873 – December 14, 1951) was an American astronomer. He was involved with both of the Lowell Observatory solar system projects, observations of the planet Mars and the search for Planet X.

==Biography==
Carl Otto Lampland was born near Hayfield in Dodge County, Minnesota. He was born into a family of ten children. Both his father Ole Helliksen Lampland (1834–1914) and his mother Berit Gulliksdatter Skartum (1850–1943) were born in Norway.

He was educated first at Valparaiso Normal School in Valparaiso, Indiana, where he earned a B.S. degree in 1899. He then studied at Indiana University Bloomington, where he received a B.A. degree in astronomy in 1902, an M.A. in 1906, and an honorary LL.D in 1930.

He first went to Lowell Observatory in 1902 when invited by Percival Lowell and Lampland was closely involved with Lowell in planetary observation. He designed cameras used for astronomy and also designed and maintained telescopes, including resilvering the mirror of the telescope. He also constructed thermocouples and used them to measure temperatures of planets. He won the Royal Photographic Society Medal in 1905 for the camera which he designed for the 24-inch Clark telescope. Together with William Coblentz, he measured large differences between the day and night temperatures on Mars which implied a thin Martian atmosphere. He discovered the asteroid 1604 Tombaugh. In 1907 Lampland and Lowell won a Royal Photographic Society exhibition medal for their photographs of Mars.
==Honors==
*Lampland was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1915.
*Lampland was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1931.
*The asteroid 1767 Lampland was named in his memory.
*The lunar crater &quot;Lampland&quot; was named after him.
*The Martian crater &quot;Lampland&quot; was also named after him.
*The C.O. Lampland Collection is maintained at the Lowell Observatory Archives in Flagstaff.
*His date of birth is the starting point for the Mars Sol Date calendar.

<doc id="764938" wikidata="Q558188" url="?curid=764938" title="David Porter (naval officer)">
<text>David Porter (February 1, 1780 – March 3, 1843) was an American naval officer and diplomat. Porter commanded a number of U.S. naval ships. He saw service in the First Barbary War, the War of 1812 and in the West Indies. On July 2, 1812, Porter hoisted the banner &quot;Free trade and sailors&#x27; rights&quot; as captain of USS &quot;Essex&quot;. The phrase resonated with many Americans. Porter was later court martialed; he resigned and then joined and became commander-in-chief of the Mexican Navy. Porter County, Indiana was named after him.

==Early life==

Born in Boston, Massachusetts, Porter served in the Quasi-War with France first as midshipman aboard , participating in the capture of &quot;L&#x27;Insurgente&quot; on February 9, 1799; then as 1st lieutenant of ; and finally in command of USS &quot;Amphitheatre&quot;. During the First Barbary War (1801–07), Porter was first lieutenant of , , and and was taken prisoner when the latter ran aground in Tripoli harbor on October 31, 1803. After his release on June 3, 1805, he remained in the Mediterranean as acting captain of and later captain of &quot;Enterprise&quot;.

==Early military career==
Porter married Evalina Anderson, and they had ten children who survived, including six sons. One of these, David Dixon Porter, became an admiral in the United States Navy. Porter purchased the grand home built by the judge and politician David Lloyd in Chester, Pennsylvania. He made many additions, and the home became known as the Porter House. It was destroyed by explosion in 1882.

Porter&#x27;s father, David Porter Sr., met and befriended another naval veteran of the American Revolutionary War, George Farragut, from the Balearic island of Minorca. In late spring 1808, David Sr. suffered sunstroke, and Farragut took him into his home, where his wife Elizabeth cared for him. Already weakened by tuberculosis, he died on June 22, 1808. Elizabeth Farragut died of yellow fever the same day. Motherless, the Farragut children were to be placed with friends and relatives.

While visiting Farragut and his family a short time later to express thanks for their care of his father and sympathy for their loss, Commodore Porter offered to take eight-year-old James Glasgow Farragut into his own household. Young James readily agreed. In 1809 he moved with Porter to Washington, where he met Secretary of the Navy Paul Hamilton and expressed his wish for a midshipman&#x27;s appointment. Hamilton promised that the appointment would be made as soon as he reached the age of ten; as it happened, the commission came through on December 17, 1810, six months before the boy reached his tenth birthday. When James went to sea soon after with his adoptive father, he changed his name from James to David, and it is as David Glasgow Farragut that he is remembered.

==Quasi-War==

Porter served in the Quasi-War with France. He was appointed a midshipman on 16 April 1798. Assigned to under the command of John Rodgers, he saw action in the battle against &quot;L&#x27;Insurgente&quot;, notably saving the mast by cutting away slings after it was damaged. He was then selected as one of twelve men assigned to take possession of &quot;L&#x27;Insurgente&quot; after the Americans captured her. He was promoted to lieutenant on 8 October 1799. As lieutenant he served as second in command of the schooner during the action of 1 January 1800, in which he got shot in his arm. 

==First Barbary War==

April, 1802 he was stationed on USS &quot;Chesapeake&quot;. He was promoted to master commandant on 22 April 1806 and was in charge of the naval forces at New Orleans from 1808 to 1810.

==War of 1812==
With the outbreak of the War of 1812, Porter was promoted to captain on July 2, 1812, and was assigned as commander of . He sailed out of New York harbor with the banner, &quot;Free trade and sailors&#x27; rights&quot; flying from the foretopgallant mast. On August 13, 1812, Porter captured the Royal Navy sloop as well as several British merchantmen.

In February 1813 he sailed &quot;Essex&quot; around Cape Horn and cruised the Pacific, attacking British whalers. Porter&#x27;s first action in the Pacific was the capture of the Peruvian merchantman &quot;Nereyda&quot;, releasing the captive American whalers on board. Over the next year, Porter captured 12 British whalers and 360 sailors. In June 1813, Porter released his prisoners, on the condition that they not fight against the United States until they were formally exchanged for American prisoners of war. Porter&#x27;s usual tactic was to raise British colors to allay the whaler&#x27;s suspicions, then once invited on board, he would reveal his true allegiance and purpose.

Porter and his fleet spent October–December 1813 resting and regrouping in the Marquesas Islands, which he claimed in the name of the United States and renamed them the Madison Islands, in honor of President James Madison. On March 28, 1814, Porter encountered British frigate and the sloop-of-war and the battle of Valparaiso ensued. He surrendered to British Captain James Hillyar after his ship became too disabled to offer any resistance.

==West Indies==

In 1814 he was given command of , the flagship of a five ship squadron destined for the West Indies to disrupt British shipping; however, the Treaty of Ghent was signed with Britain, ending the war, and the mission was canceled.
From 1815 to 1822, he was a member of the Board of Navy Commissioners but gave up this post to command the expedition for suppressing piracy in the West Indies (1823–25). While in the West Indies suppressing piracy, Porter invaded the town of Fajardo, Puerto Rico (a Spanish colony) to avenge the jailing of an officer from his fleet. The U.S. government did not sanction Porter&#x27;s act, and he was court-martialed upon his return to the U.S. Porter resigned from the U.S. Navy on August 18, 1826, and, shortly after, was appointed as commander-in-chief of the Mexican Navy. He held this position from 1826 to 1829.

==Later life and death==
He left the Mexican navy in 1829 and was appointed United States Minister to the Barbary States.

He was appointed as Chargé d&#x27;Affaires to the Ottoman Empire by President Andrew Jackson in 1831 and was promoted to Minister Resident in 1840.

He died on March 3, 1843, in Constantinople, Ottoman Empire while serving as United States Minister Resident to the Ottoman Empire. He was buried in the cemetery of the Philadelphia Naval Asylum, and then in 1845 reburied in the Woodlands Cemetery in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

<text>Widdershins (sometimes withershins, widershins or widderschynnes) is a term meaning to go counter-clockwise, anti-clockwise, or lefthandwise, or to walk around an object by always keeping it on the left. Literally, it means to take a course opposite the apparent motion of the sun viewed from the Northern Hemisphere (the face of this imaginary clock is the ground the viewer stands upon). The earliest recorded use of the word, as cited by the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, is in a 1513 translation of the &quot;Aeneid&quot;, where it is found in the phrase &quot;Abaisit I wolx, and widdersyns start my hair.&quot; In this sense, &quot;widdershins start my hair&quot; means &quot;my hair stood on end&quot;.

The use of the word also means &quot;in a direction opposite to the usual&quot; and &quot;in a direction contrary to the apparent course of the sun&quot;. It is cognate with the German language &quot;widersinnig&quot;, i.e., &quot;against&quot; + &quot;sense&quot;. The term &quot;widdershins&quot; was especially common in Lowland Scots.

The opposite of widdershins is &quot;deosil&quot;, or &quot;sunwise&quot;, meaning &quot;clockwise&quot;.

==Etymology==
Widdershins comes from Middle Low German &quot;weddersinnes&quot;, literally &quot;against the way&quot; (i.e. &quot;in the opposite direction&quot;), from &quot;widersinnen&quot; &quot;to go against&quot;, from Old High German elements &quot;widar&quot; &quot;against&quot; and &quot;sinnen&quot; &quot;to travel, go&quot;, related to &quot;sind&quot; &quot;journey&quot;.

==Superstition and religion==
Because the sun played a highly important role in older religions, to go against it was considered bad luck for sun-worshiping traditions.

It was considered unlucky in Britain to travel in an anticlockwise (not sunwise) direction around a church, and a number of folk myths make reference to this superstition; for example, in the fairy tale Childe Rowland, the protagonist and his sister are transported to Elfland after the sister runs widdershins round a church. There is also a reference to this in Dorothy Sayers&#x27;s novels &quot;The Nine Tailors&quot; (chapter entitled The Second Course; &quot;He turned to his right, knowing that it is unlucky to walk about a church widdershins ...&quot;) and &quot;Clouds of Witness&quot; (&quot;True, O King, and as this isn&#x27;t a church, there&#x27;s no harm in going round it widdershins&quot;). In Robert Louis Stevenson&#x27;s tale &quot;The Song of the Morrow,&quot; an old crone on the beach dances &quot;widdershins&quot;.

In the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Oriental Orthodox Churches it is normal for processions around a church to travel in an anticlockwise direction. This remains the case regardless of which hemisphere they are performed in.

In Judaism circles are also sometimes walked anticlockwise. For example, when a bride circles her groom seven times before marriage, when dancing around the bimah during Simchat Torah (or when dancing in a circle at any time), or when the Sefer Torah is brought out of the ark (ark is approached from the right, and departed from the left). This has its origins in the Temple in Jerusalem, where in order not to get in each other&#x27;s way, the priests would walk around the altar anticlockwise while performing their duties. When entering the Beis Hamikdash the people would enter by one gate, and leave by another. The resulting direction of motion was anticlockwise. In Judaism, starting things from the right side is considered to be important, since the right side is the side of Chesed (kindness) while the left side is the side of Gevurah (judgment). For example, there is a Jewish custom recorded in the Shulchan Aruch to put on the right shoe first and take off the left shoe first, following the example of Mar son of Ravina whom the Talmud records as putting his shoes on in this way.

The Bönpo in the Northern Hemisphere traditionally circumambulate (generally) in a counter-clockwise and &#x27;widdershins&#x27; direction, that is to say, a direction that runs counter to the apparent movement of the Sun within the sky from the vantage of the ground. This runs counter to the prevalent directionality of Buddhism (in general) and orthodox Hinduism. This is in keeping with the aspect and directionality of the &#x27;Sauvastika&#x27; (Tibetan: &quot;yung-drung&quot;), sacred to the Bönpo. In the Southern Hemisphere, the Bönpo practitioner is required to elect whether the directionality of &#x27;counter-clockwise&#x27; (deosil in the Southern Hemisphere) or running-counter to the direction of the Sun (widdershins in the Southern Hemisphere) is the key intention of the tradition. The resolution to this is left open to the practitioner, their &#x27;intuitive insight&#x27; (Sanskrit: &quot;prajna&quot;) and their tradition.

<doc id="764950" wikidata="Q2362526" url="?curid=764950" title="The Fall of Hyperion (novel)">
<text>The Fall of Hyperion is the second novel in the &quot;Hyperion Cantos&quot;, a science fiction series by American author Dan Simmons. The novel, published in 1990, won both the 1991 British Science Fiction and Locus Awards. It was also nominated for the Hugo Award and the Nebula Award.

Set in the 29th century, the novel documents a pilgrimage to the planet Hyperion. The seven pilgrims intend to travel to the Valley of the Time Tombs, where the Shrike, a metallic creature alleged to grant one wish to the members of a pilgrimage, dwells. Powerful entities such as the Hegemony of Man and the Artificial Intelligence (AI) TechnoCore seek to influence the pilgrims&#x27; journey.

The &quot;Hyperion Cantos&quot; is influenced strongly by various works, including the teachings of the environmentalist John Muir and the poetry of John Keats; a reincarnation of Keats narrates &quot;The Fall of Hyperion&quot;. The novel also contains explicit references to classical literature and modern writings, including the scientific works of the Jesuit and paleontologist Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, the physicist Stephen Hawking, and some of the fiction of author Jack Vance.

==Plot==

The Hegemony is an interstellar governmental entity formed by many planets, most of which are connected by instantaneous farcaster portals. Some worlds, like Hyperion, have no farcaster portals and are sparsely settled; they are known as the &quot;Outback&quot;. The farcasters are created and managed by the TechnoCore, an AI civilization. While the Core&#x27;s physical location is unknown, they interact with humans through various virtual realities.

The Hegemony is opposed by the Ousters, genetically modified humans that fled the Hegemony&#x27;s growing influence even before Earth was destroyed. The Ousters have mutated physically, believing that they should adapt to their outer-space surroundings rather than adapt the surroundings themselves. They have rarely fought full-scale conflicts with the Hegemony but are currently launching an invasion of Hyperion.

=== Severn&#x27;s narrative dreams of the pilgrims ===

Joseph Severn, the name assumed by a second John Keats AI persona, has dreams of the pilgrims on Hyperion. He reports these dreams to Hegemony CEO Meina Gladstone, allowing the government to have real-time access to information about the pilgrims.

Father Hoyt is killed by the Shrike. The Consul leaves to retrieve his ship from Keats. Father Hoyt&#x27;s body is resurrected into Father Paul Duré. Silenus goes to the Poets&#x27; City to complete his Cantos, but is surprised by the Shrike and impaled on the Tree of Pain. Lamia is also attacked by the Shrike and loses consciousness. She awakens in one of the TechnoCore&#x27;s computerized realities, in the company of Johnny. Lamia and Johnny converse with an AI named Ummon, which reveals some of the motivations of the TechnoCore and the existence of a war between human and AI ultimate intelligences. Johnny is killed by Ummon, and Lamia is released.

The Shrike appears and takes Kassad through a portal. Moneta explains that the Shrike can be controlled by one who defeats it in single combat. Kassad agrees to fight the Shrike. He is transported to a future Hyperion where the planet is desolate and without an atmosphere. All that remains is the Tree of Pain, the tombs, and hundreds of Shrikes. Vowing to save the victims impaled on the Tree, Kassad charges.

At the Tombs, Het Masteen reappears. Before dying, he reveals that the Shrike Cult has colluded with the Templar Brotherhood, and claims that he was meant to pilot the Tree of Pain through space and time. Shortly thereafter, Father Duré disappears. Minutes before the time of Rachel&#x27;s birth and the simultaneous opening of the Time Tombs, Sol offers her to the Shrike, who carries her into the Tombs.

=== Severn&#x27;s actions ===

Meina Gladstone positions Severn as a member of her staff. Gladstone is informed that the Ousters have counterattacked, attacking the WorldWeb itself in an unprecedented and unexpected move that appeared impossible. Since FORCE fleets have been committed to the Hyperion system, the first wave of worlds threatened by the Ouster invasion seems destined to fall. As sudden Shrike Cult uprisings devastate major Hegemony planets, Severn travels to Pacem and encounters Father Duré, who had been transported to Pacem by the Shrike. Intrigued by the collusion of the Templar Brotherhood with the Shrike Cult, Duré travels to God&#x27;s Grove, which is soon to be attacked by the Ousters. Severn and Gladstone&#x27;s chief of staff, Leigh Hunt, attempts to farcast to Tau Ceti Center. Instead, they arrive on a world that is an apparent replica of Old Earth, on the way to Rome, the place of the original Keats&#x27;s death. Like the original Keats, Severn dies of tuberculosis while the Shrike keeps watch outside, preventing Hunt from leaving with Severn until his physical form dies; his persona retreats into the TechnoCore.

=== Conclusion ===

The Consul meets with the leaders of the Ouster Swarm and learns that the Ousters are not responsible for the attack against the WorldWeb. The TechnoCore is the only power capable of launching such an attack. The Consul tells Gladstone the truth about the attack. Admiral Lee sends a transmission showing an autopsy on a supposed Ouster from their battlefleet, but the body destroys itself by consuming itself in the same manner as the Core cybrids do, confirming the intel that the supposed Ouster attacks are really Core attacks. The only Ouster swarm attack is the one on Hyperion. Through a dream, Severn tells Gladstone that the TechnoCore resides completely within the farcaster system. They fear other intelligences found in the Void Which Binds, another dimension through which the farcaster portals pass. Gladstone orders the immediate destruction of the farcaster network. General Morpurgo leads a ship supposedly on its way to Hyperion with a Core deathwand technology designed to kill any human on the surface and all of the Ouster swarm. Instead, the General and his son release the deathwand while the ship is in the farcaster network, saving Hyperion. The WorldWeb disintegrates; mass chaos and riots ensue. Gladstone allows herself to be killed by the rioters, as partial penance for the suffering she caused. The fatline, which utilizes the Void Which Binds for faster-than-light communication, is suddenly shut down by unknown forces.

On Hyperion, Lamia frees Silenus and destroys the Shrike through an unknown power. Rachel appears outside the Time Tombs as a young woman, carrying her infant self. She explains that she is Moneta and is traveling back in time with the Shrike under orders from humanity&#x27;s future. Sol enters the portal to raise the infant Rachel in the far future.

Several months later, the worst of the chaos caused by the Fall has abated. The novel ends with the Consul returning to the former Web Worlds in his starship to discover what happened, with Severn&#x27;s personality stored in his ship. Lamia is seven and a half months pregnant with Keats&#x27;s child, who is named by the Severn personality as &quot;The One Who Teaches.&quot;

<text>George Porter, Baron Porter of Luddenham, (6 December 1920 – 31 August 2002) was a British chemist. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1967.

==Education and early life==
Porter was born in Stainforth, near Thorne, in the then West Riding of Yorkshire. He was educated at Thorne Grammar School, then won a scholarship to the University of Leeds and gained his first degree in chemistry. During his degree, Porter was taught by Meredith Gwynne Evans, who he later said was the most brilliant chemist he had ever met. He was awarded a PhD from the University of Cambridge in 1949 for research investigating free radicals produced by photochemical means. He would later become a fellow at Emmanuel College, Cambridge.

==Career and research==
Porter served in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve during the Second World War. Porter then went on to do research at the University of Cambridge supervised by Ronald George Wreyford Norrish where he began the work that ultimately led to them becoming Nobel Laureates.

His original research in developing the technique of flash photolysis to obtain information on short-lived molecular species provided the first evidence of free radicals. His later research utilised the technique to study the detailed aspects of the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis, with particular regard to possible applications to a hydrogen economy, of which he was a strong advocate.

He was Assistant Director of the British Rayon Research Association from 1953 to 1954, where he studied the phototendering of dyed cellulose fabrics in sunlight.

Porter served as professor in the Chemistry department at the University of Sheffield in 1954–65. It was here he started his work on flash photolysis with equipment designed and made in the departmental workshop. During this tenure he also took part in a television programme describing his work. This was in the &quot;Eye on Research&quot; series. Porter became Fullerian Professor of Chemistry and Director of the Royal Institution in 1966. During his directorship of the Royal Institution, Porter was instrumental in the setting up of Applied Photophysics, a company created to supply instrumentation based on his group&#x27;s work. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1967 along with Manfred Eigen and Ronald George Wreyford Norrish. In the same year he became a visiting professor at University College London.

Porter was a major contributor to the Public Understanding of science. He became president of the British Association in 1985 and was the founding Chair of the Committee on the Public Understanding of Science (COPUS). He gave the Romanes Lecture, entitled &quot;Science and the human purpose&quot;, at the University of Oxford in 1978; and in 1988 he gave the Dimbleby Lecture, &quot;Knowledge itself is power.&quot; From 1990 to 1993 he gave the Gresham lectures in astronomy.

===Awards and honours===
Porter was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1960, a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1979, a member of the American Philosophical Society in 1986, and served as President of the Royal Society from 1985 to 1990. He was also awarded the Davy Medal in 1971, the Rumford Medal in 1978, the Ellison-Cliffe Medal in 1991 and the Copley Medal in 1992.

Porter also received an Honorary Doctorate from Heriot-Watt University in 1971.

He was knighted in 1972, appointed to the Order of Merit in 1989, and was made a life peer as Baron Porter of Luddenham, of Luddenham in the County of Kent, in 1990. In 1995, he was awarded an Honorary Degree (Doctor of Laws) from the University of Bath.

In 1976 he gave the Royal Institution Christmas Lecture on &quot;The Natural History of a Sunbeam&quot;.

Porter served as Chancellor of the University of Leicester between 1984 and 1995. In 2001, the university&#x27;s chemistry building was named the George Porter Building in his honour.

==Family==

In 1949 Porter married Stella Jean Brooke.

<doc id="764960" wikidata="Q331036" url="?curid=764960" title="James Madison Porter">
<text>James Madison Porter (January 6, 1793 – November 11, 1862) served as the 18th United States Secretary of War and a founder of Lafayette College.

Porter began his career studying law in 1809 and later became a clerk in the prothonotary&#x27;s office in an effort to manage a volunteer militia company at Fort Mifflin. Porter was admitted to the bar in 1813 and later appointed to attorney general for Northampton County, Pennsylvania. He was a professor of jurisprudence and political economy at Lafayette College (1837-1852), a judge of the twelfth judicial district (1839), ad interim U.S. Secretary of War under President John Tyler (1843), and was elected as a member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives in 1849.

==Early life and education==
James Madison Porter was born on January 6, 1793, in Norristown, Pennsylvania at his father&#x27;s estate known as Selma. He was the son of General Andrew Porter and Elizabeth Parker Porter, and was the youngest of thirteen children. James and his older brother, Judge Robert Porter, were home schooled during their early years and later attended Norristown Academy to continue their adolescent education.

==Career==
===Military service===
Porter began his military career in 1809 as an office clerk at the request of his father, who served as the Surveyor General of Pennsylvania at the time. His time spent as an office clerk proved to be beneficial in allowing him to acquire the knowledge that would lead him to enter the law office of John Passmore, Esquire. Porter was settled in Philadelphia in 1813 when rumors spread across the city that the British were coming during the War of 1812. Porter took matters into his own hands and organized militia units along the Delaware River. Although the British never arrived, the people of Philadelphia applauded his efforts. His military service ceased upon his arrival in Easton, Pennsylvania in 1818, but resumed in 1843 when President John Tyler appointed him Secretary of War. President John Tyler named Porter his secretary ad interim, hoping that after time, the Senate would approve Porter&#x27;s nomination. However, Porter served in the Cabinet only eleven months because the Senate did not confirm his nomination. This arose due to President Tyler&#x27;s troubled relationship with the Senate in previous years. President Tyler had offended the Whigs with his independent nomination and upon hearing of the Senate&#x27;s action, Porter immediately resigned his commission and returned to Easton.

===Business career===
Although primarily remembered for his political and educational achievements, James Madison Porter had a successful track record in business as well. He was the first president of the Delaware, Lehigh, Schuylkill, and Susquehanna Railroad that was charted in 1847 and became the Lehigh Valley Railroad in 1853. Moreover, although he was up for reelection in 1856 when the company was moving to Philadelphia, he chose to decline the offer. Porter was also the president of the Belvidere Delaware Railroad company, which is now part of the Pennsylvania Railroad, and the Easton Delaware Bridge Company. Under his administration, the original line opened in 1855. It stretched from Easton to Mauch Chunk, a region now known as Jim Thorpe. Additionally, Porter was invested in the natural resource industry. He organized a company called Northampton Quarry Company in 1817 in order to purchase and work a slate quarry near the bank of the Delaware River in Upper Mount Bethel County. By the 1830s, the company had expanded its reach and was renamed the Pennsylvania Slate Company. Additionally, Porter had similar investments in limestone quarries, coal mines, and a few mines involving the extraction of iron ore. Furthermore, Porter was involved in two commercial endeavors. He founded the savings bank known as the Dime Savings Institute of Easton that flourished for a few years until it was incorporated into a larger regional bank, and he was an originator of the Farmers&#x27; and Mechanics&#x27; Institute of Easton that was designed to advance the agricultural and mechanical arts.

===Political career===
Porter came to Easton in 1818 to serve as the deputy attorney general for Northampton County. He was very involved in handling the civil and murder cases of the community. In 1838, Porter was elected a member of the body of the Pennsylvania General Assembly to help reform the state constitution. Though not elected presiding officer, his role as chairman of the Committee on the Bill of Rights put him in a position to express his opinions. He maintained a political viewpoint that was conservative to moderate. In 1839, his brother David Rittenhouse Porter was elected governor for the Democratic ballot. In the same year, David appointed James as President Judge for the state district of Dauphin, Schuylkill and Lebanon counties. A recess appointment to the office of Secretary of War, Porter was never confirmed by the Senate, receiving only three favorable votes. After serving in Washington, D.C. under President Tyler for eleven months as Secretary of War, Porter was elected to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives in 1849. However, Porter left the legislature after only one year. From 1853 to 1855, he served as President Judge of the twenty-second judicial district that included Wayne, Pike, Monroe and Carbon counties. Porter&#x27;s political career came to end when he was asked to retire at age 63 due to health concerns.

===Founding of Lafayette College===

The borough (now city) of Easton in the mid-1700s and early 1800s did not see much success in building a sound educational system. Easton built its first school in 1755, and though seeing some classes of students graduate, the school closed in 1798. In 1784, there was a desire to build an academy for young students called the Easton Union Academy. Though it was chartered in 1794 by the trustees of the Union Academy, the school was unable to grow. The academy struggled with infrastructural upkeep and maintaining a cohort of teachers willing to provide instruction to students. In 1824, the academy closed and the School Board of Easton took over the property.

General Lafayette&#x27;s visit to America in 1824-1825 inspired the citizens of Easton. A group of 200 citizens traveled to Philadelphia on Wednesday, September 22 to meet Lafayette. Porter engaged in a positive exchange with Lafayette about Porter&#x27;s family legacy and stories of war. Enlightened, Porter traveled to Norwich University and Dartmouth College, where he first got the idea to establish a college in Easton. Despite previous efforts to establish educational institutions in the borough, Porter advocated Easton&#x27;s ability to sustain a college, saying that, &quot;Easton was &#x27;rich and flourishing&#x27; in men, in location, in resources, and in prospects. There was every reason to believe that a college established by the &#x27;combined efforts of its citizens&#x27; would succeed.&quot;

The newspaper, &quot;The Centinal,&quot; printed an advertisement calling for Easton citizens to attend a meeting on December 27, 1824, at the Easton Hotel to discuss the potential for building a college. At the meeting, led by Porter, the assembly discussed the ability for a college to thrive in Easton, saying that, &quot;It was emphasized that the academy, which had undertaken only secondary education, had failed because it was dependent purely on local patronage and was subject to all the whims and prejudices of the neighborhood, whereas an institution of higher learning would attract students from a wide area and would therefore be independent of these local factors&quot;. Porter emphasized the importance of teaching military science to prepare young men for war and inspire leadership. He also stressed the importance of teaching the German language because of the heritage of the majority of the population in Easton. Soon after, Porter, along with assembly members Joel Jones and Jacob Wagener, drafted a charter for the college to be sent for legislative approval.

On December 6, 1825, the Pennsylvania House of Representatives met to review the proposed charter. The charter was referred to the Committee on Education as Bill Number 12, who intensely debated the bill. After much deliberation, the bill was passed by the House one month later on January 6, 1826, with three provisions made that limited the power of the college, allowed those practicing any religion to be associated with the college, and allowed legislature to revoke the charter if deemed necessary. The bill was proposed to the Pennsylvania Senate on January 16, 1826, and again faced opposition. Some senators opposed the teaching of military science, believing it would inspire a war-like attitude in the students. After two months of discussion, the charter was approved by the Senate on March 7, 1829. Two days later, Governor of Pennsylvania J. Andrew Shulze approved the charter, and Lafayette College came into legal existence.

Several men joined Porter in his efforts to establish a college in Easton, including:
* Samuel Sitgreaves, a lawyer who served as a member of the Fourth and Fifth Congresses
* Colonel Thomas McKeen, a commissioned colonel of the Pennsylvania State Militia
* Joel Jones, the 141st mayor of Philadelphia and the first president of Girard College
* Colonel Christian Jacob Hutter, the founder of &quot;The Centinal&quot; and several other publications in Easton
* Thomas J. Rogers, a writer and Pennsylvania state senator who established &quot;The Northampton Farmer&quot; and &quot;Easton Weekly Advertiser&quot;
These men joined Porter in Easton and on his journey to Philadelphia to meet General Lafayette. Other men involved in the process were Jacob Wagener, Jacob Weygandt, Jr., William Shouse, Philip Mixsell, John Bowes, Peter Miller, Philip H. Mattes, John Carey, John R. Lattimore, Peter S. Michler, and Joseph K. Smith.

==Speeches and addresses==

===1837 speech to Convention of Pennsylvania on Right to Annul Charters of Incorporation===
Porter delivered this speech on November 20, 1837, in Philadelphia. Porter began by referencing a, &quot;Mr. Doran,&quot; of Philadelphia County who had originally offered a proposal stating that the state tax on real and personal property was to be repealed, as well as to charter a state bank to be named, &quot;The United States Bank.&quot; He continued by stating that Mr. Doran&#x27;s plan was not called up for second reading and consideration until the 18th day of November, 1837. Through the action of McCahen of Philadelphia County, the plan was passed with a vote of 53 to 50. Although Mr. Doran&#x27;s plan was enacted, several other plans were proposed prior to Porter&#x27;s speech. Porter moved forward in his speech by stating that he disagrees with a previous proposal given by a certain, &quot;Mr. Meredith.&quot; Meredith had proposed the following options:

1)&quot;That it is the sense of this convention that contracts made on the faith of the Commonwealth are, and of right ought to be, inviolable.&quot;

2)&quot;That it is the sense of this Convention that a charter duly granted by an act of Assembly is, when accepted, a contract with the parties to whom the grant is made.&quot;

In his address, Porter stated that he did not believe the proposal to be correct in principle, stating that all charters of incorporation should not be beyond legislative control. He further stated that the nature of all contracts are to be subject to the supervision of the Legislature which, &quot;has the power to alter, re-model, and repeal the same as the exigencies of the State and a regard for the public good may require.&quot; Porter then continued by stating that the proposal was only applicable in the case of private corporation affairs where a charter is a contract and cannot be changed by any other corporations without the consent of the original private corporation.

Porter then shifted his speech to the topic of large corporations and monopolies. He addressed the convention by stating that the state of Pennsylvania, and businessmen in general, should be careful to guard against the dangers of the intentions of monopolies, and large businesses. He stated that, &quot;it may be wise and salutary, and perhaps it may essentially aid us in arriving at sound and correct conclusions, to inquire into the origin, progress, uses and tendencies of corporations.&quot; Stating that a corporation is no more than an artificial being, Porter expressed his idea that a corporation&#x27;s intentions should be nothing more than what its charter defines. Porter then outlined several examples of how corporations in early Italy sought nothing but to grow in size, even at the expense of smaller businesses, and how these corporations eventually gained more power in national affairs than was appropriate. Porter believed in the rights of the individual citizen, as opposed to the rights of the larger corporations. Towards the end of his speech, Porter stated that the convention should mark his words that, &quot;If ever our republic fails, it will be by the destruction of the confidence of our citizens in the security of their individual rights.&quot;

===1832 address to Literary Societies of Lafayette College===
Porter gave this address on July 4, 1832, as the current president of the board of trustees of Lafayette College. Porter began by calling into memory the brave General Lafayette after which the college is named, and expressed his beliefs of future success for the college. Recalling a certain degree of nationalism expressed by Americans during the American Revolution, Porter stated that our Declaration of Independence was a quintessential expression of the American ideal.

Porter continued with his address by stating that ignorant and uneducated individuals can never be &quot;free&quot; (referring to American freedom) and that an educated people will never be enslaved to an oppressive government. Porter then stated that it is because of institutions like Lafayette that the American people might become educated and informed. Giving a brief history of the college, Porter continued by stating that the charter of Lafayette College was granted by legislature in 1826, and was not aided or endowed by the Commonwealth. He also gave a brief statement of how the college was first a military institution prior to becoming a liberal arts college.
The next major segment of Porter&#x27;s speech covered the role of Lafayette&#x27;s current, and future students. Porter stated that the student body was of an age where &quot;youth is buoyant.&quot; It is because of this youthful mindset that Porter believed young people are not always ready to make the most of their time, stating that &quot;(the youth are) ... not always sufficiently convinced of the necessity of improving the passing hours.&quot; Porter then stated that it is because of Lafayette College, and other colleges akin to Lafayette&#x27;s academic standard and ideals, that the student body would be successful, and become, &quot;ornaments of society.&quot; Porter explained the importance of constant intellectual stimulation as a fundamental building block towards adulthood, but also touched upon the importance of physical fitness as another fundamental necessity. Porter believed that intellectual and physical fitness should not be mutually exclusive, &quot;... he who has accomplished the greatest amount of physical labor in the three hours, per day, devoted to manual and agricultural pursuits, has, with scarcely an exception, made the greatest mental progress.&quot;

Porter finished his speech with a final statement on the sciences. Asking those students who were, &quot;blessed with brilliant minds,&quot; to remember the allegory of the Hill of Science; a strong work ethic will overcome the brilliant, but lazy. He stated that the image of Lafayette College was directly associated with the image of its student body, and that, &quot;much of the reputation of any college depends on the attainments and characters of its graduates.&quot; Porter&#x27;s final statements outlined the students&#x27; journey towards the &quot;active scenes&quot; of life. He made sure to stress that the student body should carry with them morals and unbending integrity.

===1835 address to the Mechanics of Easton, Pennsylvania===
Porter delivered this address on July 4, 1835. He began his address with a philosophical overtone, describing the rational faculties of man. Porter stated that man is only able to conceive of rational thought from existing rational thought; the same holds true for perceptions of objects. Porter then expressed his discontent towards the mental ability of man, stating, &quot;... without the aid of divine revelation, how utterly incapable is the mind of man, much we boast of its powers ...&quot; Although Porter was skeptical of the mental capability of man, he did acknowledge the intellectual prowess of a select few individuals in the earlier time period of mankind. Moving on to the subject of religion, Porter stated that religion has actually aided learning throughout even the earliest of monastic systems. He stated that the re-printing of the Bible aided in the expansion of intellectual curiosity and ideas, and that the German people benefitted the most from this re-printing of the Bible.

Porter then moved his speech forward by speaking about the influence of other works on the intellectual stimulation of mankind, &quot;But the influence which Letters, originating in Egypt and thence introduced to Greece, Italy and the rest of the world, have exercised and are continuing to exercise over the habits, manners and destinies of mankind ...&quot; Porter believed that a society that had been educated entirely, without an educated &quot;elite,&quot; is a society that is commended by all the motives of piety, morality, and patriotism. Porter stated that the piety of an intelligent community as well as its morality is of a &quot;purer and more lofty&quot; character than among the uninformed. He used the example of the early New England settlers and their union on the soil of America to further his point &quot;... at once presented the singular phenomenon of a society containing neither lords nor common people, neither rich nor poor ... These men possessed, in proportion to their numbers a greater mass of intelligence than is found in any European nation of our own time.&quot; Porter believed that a generally educated society is one that is on an inevitable road to success.

Porter began then final portions of his address by further stressing the importance of general education, specifically in the state of Pennsylvania. He stated that since the inchoate stages of Pennsylvania&#x27;s development, the state had prioritized education as a tenet of success, &quot;Our constitutional injunctions have been followed by repeated legislative enactments, until we have a system in operation which places the means of education within the reach of every member of the community.&quot; The quest for universal education for the people of early Pennsylvania was an undertaking that Porter gave great respect.

==Death and legacy==
On November 11, 1862, Porter died at his home in Easton, Pennsylvania at the age of 69. He is buried in Easton Cemetery alongside his wife, Eliza, who died on March 2, 1866.

The Porter Society, a scholarship at the college, was founded at Lafayette College in 1997 in honor of Porter.
