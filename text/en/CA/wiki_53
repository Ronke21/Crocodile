<text>Chatyr-Dag (; ; ) is a mountainous massif in Crimea, near the Simferopol-Alushta highway.

==Overview==
The mountain consists of two plateaus: the lower (north) and the upper (south). The lower plateau slopes gently down to its northern side, which is covered in steppe grass. On its southern end (near the steep slope of the higher plateau), the lower plateau is covered with beech forests and juniper glades. It has many hiking trails and several beautiful caves (listed below). On the east side of the lower plateau there is a grove of yews.

The upper plateau has the shape of a giant bowl and on its rim; the highest peaks are each named. The upper plateau is covered with alpine meadows. Its slopes are very steep and offer some routes for multipitch climbing (rock climbing routes longer than length of one climbing rope). The highest peak is Eklizi-Bourun (1527 m above sea level).

Caves in the Chatyr-Dag massif include:
* Marble Caves
* Emine Bair Hosar cave
* Fur-tree cave
* Obvalnaya cave
* Vyalova cave
* Artuch-Koba
* Vyalova cave system

<text>Sir John de Sutton V (February 1380 – 28 August 1406) was the 4th Baron Sutton of Dudley and heir to Dudley Castle. He was the son of Sir John de Sutton IV, 3rd Baron Sutton, and Joan(d. 1408). John married Constance Blount (d. 11 October 1432), daughter of Sir Walter le Blount of Barton who was killed at the Battle of Shrewsbury in c.1402, whose death was immortalized by Shakespeare.

John V is a descendant of the first Lord Dudley, Sir John de Sutton II (c. 1310–1359) the first to be summoned to the Parliament of England as Baron Sutton in 1342. From 1397 to 1406, John V held lands derived from the Earls of Powis, upon the death of his great grandmother Isabel de Cherleton. In 1401, during the second year of King Henry IV of England&#x27;s reign, John V did homage for the lands, including Castle Dudley. After John V&#x27;s death, the Blounts had a stake in Dudley lands when his mother-in-law, Sancha de Ayala (d.1418), took custody of his first child John VI, who was age six, as well as being granted John V&#x27;s valuable estates. Widowed, Constance was eventually sued by Robert Erghom for her dower in the King&#x27;s chancery by which she defaulted several times on the King&#x27;s grant of Dudley manor.

John V was succeeded by John Sutton VI, 1st Baron Dudley. By Constance, his other children included Thomas Sutton of Dudley, Jane Sutton of Dudley (who married Thomas Mainwaring) and Elizabeth Sutton of Dudley. He is also said to have had a child, Humphrey Dudley.

<text>The Diocese of Syracuse () is a Latin Church ecclesiastical territory, or diocese, of the Catholic Church in Upstate New York in the United States. Its episcopal see is located in Syracuse. It is a suffragan diocese in the ecclesiastical province of the metropolitan Archdiocese of New York.

On June 4, 2019, Pope Francis appointed Douglas Lucia to be the next Bishop of Syracuse. Lucia was consecrated to the episcopacy and installed as bishop on August 8, 2019.

== Territory ==
The Diocese of Syracuse includes seven counties:

* Broome
* Chenango
* Cortland
* Madison
* Oneida
* Onondaga
* Oswego

==History==

=== 1600 to 1700 ===
The first Catholic missionary, Simon Le Moyne, traveled to central New York in 1654 during a brief truce between the French and the Iroquois (Haudenosaunee) Confederacy. He was well suited for the expedition given his fluency in both the Huron (Wyandot) and Haudenosaunee languages. He left Quebec City in the French colony of New France to travel to the upper Mohawk Valley. During his 1654 visit, Onondaga Native Americans showed Le Moyne a spring that they believed to be cursed; he immediately recognized as a harmless salt spring.

In another visit to the area in 1656, Reverend Pierre-Joseph-Marie Chaumonot and Reverend Claude Dablon laid the groundwork to build Sainte Marie among the Iroquois near present-day Syracuse. It was a sizable mission, housing about seven Jesuit priests. and 50 French workmen.

In 1658, the French were forced to abandon Sainte Marie due to fears of an attacks by Mohawk/Haudenosaunee tribesmen. Additional missions in the area were undertaken later by both Jesuit and Sulpicians missionaries.

After the Dutch ceded their colony of New Amsterdam (New York) to the British in 1667, political tensions started rising in central New York. The British and French began disputing the territory, leading them to incite their allies, the French-allied Wyandot and the British allied Haudenosaunee, to fight each other. This situation led to rivalries, atrocities, and reprisals between the two Native American nations. This situation made it difficult for missionaries to safely maintain and continue their missions.

=== 1700 to 1800 ===
Just before the year 1700, the colonial legislature under Governor Bellomont passed laws banning Catholics in the British Province of New York, which included all of Upstate New York. One law mandated a life sentence to any Catholic priest. The penalty for harboring a Catholic was a £250 fine plus three days in the pillory. As a result, Catholic missionaries left the province. The last Jesuit missionary to the Iroquois surrendered at Albany in 1709. Great Britain gained full legal control over this territory with the signing of the Treaty of Paris (1763) at the conclusion of the Seven Years&#x27; War.

After the approval of the New York Constitution in 1777, freedom of worship for Catholics was guaranteed. This was soon followed by the same guarantee in the US Constitution.

On November 26, 1784, Pope Pius VI erected the Apostolic Prefecture of United States of America, including all of the new United States. On November 6, 1789, the same pope raised this prefecture to the Diocese of Baltimore. An early Catholic in the central New Region was Dominick Lynch, the founder of Rome. Lynch signed an address of congratulations by American Catholics to George Washington upon his election as American president in 1789.

=== 1800 to 1886 ===
On April 8, 1808, Pope Pius VII erected the Diocese of New York, taking all of New York State from the Diocese of Baltimore.

It took many decades before Catholics in central New York were able to build churches again. Catholic churches would be built in central New York. There were very few Catholics settled there, and only a small number of them could make the journey to Albany or New York City to attend mass. John C. Devereux, the first mayor of Utica, was a board member of St. Mary&#x27;s Church in Albany.

The population of Catholics swelled when teams of Irish Catholics arrived to construct the Erie Canal, and also when the opening of the canal increased trade, commerce, and additional immigration. Reverend Paul McQuade, pastor of St. Mary&#x27;s Church in Albany from 1813 to 1815, frequently visited Utica, and probably celebrated Masses there in private homes. The first public mass in Utica was celebrated in the courthouse on January 10, 1819. The first new Catholic church in the region, St. John&#x27;s, was constructed in Utica in 1821. With the advent of railroads in the region, even more Catholic immigrants started moving there.

In 1847, recognizing the population growth in Upstate New York, Pope Pius IX erected the Diocese of Albany, including all of the current territory of the Diocese of Syracuse.

=== 1886 to 1923 ===
In 1886, Pope Leo XIII erected the Diocese of Syracuse, taking its territory from the Diocese of Albany. The pope named Monsignor Patrick Ludden of Albany as the first bishop of Syracuse. St. John the Evangelist Church was selected to serve as the first cathedral. At the time of Ludden&#x27;s arrival, the diocese contained 70,000 Catholics, 74 priests, 46 parishes, 20 mission churches, and 16 parochial schools. He selected St. Mary&#x27;s Church in Syracuse as his new cathedral in 1903, and dedicated it in September 1910. In 1909, Reverend John Grimes of Albany was appointed as coadjutor bishop of the diocese by Pope Pius X to assist Ludden.

By the time of Ludden&#x27;s death in 1912, the diocese had a Catholic population over 150,000, with 129 priests, 80 parishes, 36 mission churches, and 21 parochial schools. Grimes automatically became the second bishop of Syracuse after Ludden died. Grimes served in Syracuse until his death in 1922.

=== 1923 to 1970 ===
Daniel Curley of the Archdiocese of New York was the next bishop of Syracuse, appointed by Pope Pius XI in 1923. During Curley&#x27;s tenure, the Catholic population of the diocese increased from 173,200 to 201,152. He established a Society for the Propagation of the Faith, 28 parishes, 18 schools, the Loretto Rest facility, and Lourdes Hospital. At his invitation, the Sisters of Perpetual Rosary opened the first home for cloistered nuns in Syracuse. Curley died in 1932.

In 1933, Monsignor John A. Duffy of the Diocese of Newark was appointed the fourth bishop of Syracuse by Pius XI. In 1934, when fan dancer Sally Rand was scheduled to appear in Syracuse, Duffy commented, &quot;I must regard the presence of the Rand woman on the stage as an act of public defiance of the Catholic people of Syracuse.&quot; Four years later in 1937, Pius XI named Duffy as bishop of the Diocese of Buffalo.

To replace Duffy, Pius IX named Monsignor Walter Foery of the Diocese of Rochester as the next bishop of Syracuse in 1937. In 1959, he expressed &quot;shock and deep regret&quot; that the Syracuse Metropolitan Health Council had admitted Planned Parenthood. After 33 years as bishop, Foery retired in 1970.

=== 1970 to present ===
Auxiliary David Cunningham of Syracuse replaced Foery in 1970, named by Pope Paul VI. Cunningham retired six years later and Paul VI named Auxiliary Bishop Francis Harrison of Syracuse to replace him. Harrison practiced a collegial manner of governing, and worked to include laity and especially women in the diocesan affairs. He launched diocesan programs for African Americans, Hispanic, Native Americans, and the disabled. He once played a game of golf with comedian Bob Hope, who later recorded a radio ad for the diocese&#x27;s first HOPE Appeal, an annual fundraiser Harrison started in 1978. Harrison resigned in 1987.

Pope John Paul II named Auxiliary Bishop Joseph O&#x27;Keefe of the Archdiocese of New York as the next bishop of Syracuse. O&#x27;Keefe served in Syracuse until his retirement in 1995. The same pope then selected Monsignor James Moynihan of the Diocese of Rochester to succeed O&#x27;Keefe as bishop. In 1998, Moynihan removed Reverend Richard McBrien as a columnist for the diocesan newspaper, replacing him with writer George Weigel; this action dismayed some members of the diocesan clergy. In November 2001 he released a pastoral letter to the people of Syracuse entitled: Equipping the Saints for the Work of Ministry. Moynihan was a founding member of the Bishop Sheen Ecumenical Housing Foundation, named after Bishop Fulton J. Sheen

After Moynihan retired in 2009, Pope Benedict XVI selected Bishop Robert J. Cunningham of the Diocese of Ogdensburg as the next bishop of Syracuse. He retired in 2018.

The current bishop of the Diocese of Syracuse is Douglas Lucia, formerly a priest of the Diocese of Ogdensburg. He was named by Pope Francis in 2019.

===Sex abuse scandals and bankruptcy===
In a 2011 legal deposition, Bishop Cunningham made statements about the victims of sex abuse describing them as &quot;culpable&quot; and &quot;accomplices&quot;. In 2015, when those statements became public, Cunningham made this comment:&quot;It is obvious that my choice of words should have been better. Bottom line is, I cannot go back and change my words but I can assure you that I did not believe the individual involved in the case was at fault.&quot; He also repeatedly reiterated that he doesn&#x27;t believe children are responsible for being abused.In June 2020, Bishop Lucia announced that the diocese had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy due the cost of lawsuits from hundreds of sexual abuse cases.. Lucia said he decided on bankruptcy to keep the diocese solvent and ensure that all the alleged victims got something for their lawsuits. Just days before the bankruptcy filing, 38 plaintiffs filed new sex abuse lawsuits under the New York Child Victims Act.

In December 2024, priest Nathan Brooks, who once served at parishes in Cortland County, New York, pled guilty to Endangering the Welfare of a Child and was sentenced in Homer Town Court to a term of probation supervision, counseling, and a full stay-away order; Brooks also faced a charge of forcible touching a minor over several years, but the family said it was satisfied with the resolution on the endangering charge. Cortland County District Attorney Patrick noted that in addition to violating the law, Brooks violated the policies of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Syracuse.

<doc id="771680" wikidata="Q1012374" url="?curid=771680" title="Hikone Castle">
<text>is an Edo-period Japanese castle located in the city of Hikone, Shiga Prefecture, Japan. It is considered the most significant historical site in Shiga. The site has been protected as a National Historic Site since 1951. Hikone is one of only twelve castles in Japan with its original &quot;tenshu&quot;, and one of only five castles with buildings listed as National Treasures.

==Overview==
Hikone Castle is located one kilometer from Lake Biwa due to land reclamation, but originally the castle was directly on the lakeshore, and the north and east sides were surrounded by water. The Hikone area is in eastern Ōmi Province, and the site was a natural bottleneck on the route of the Tōsandō (later the Nakasendō) highway connecting Heian-kyō with the eastern provinces. Strategically, it was a vital point in protecting the capital from attack from the east. In the Sengoku period, this area was controlled by the Azai clan, who were based in northern Ōmi, and who built a castle called Sawayama Castle approximately two kilometers from this site. The Azai were defeated by Oda Nobunaga, who assigned Sawayama Castle to his general Niwa Nagahide. Under Toyotomi Hideyoshi, this closest advisor, Ishida Mitsunari was entrusted with the castle. After Ishida Mitsunari was defeated at the Battle of Sekigahara in 1601, Tokugawa Ieyasu appointed his general Ii Naomasa as &quot;daimyō&quot; of a new domain centered at Sawayama Castle.

Ii Naomasa was one of the most capable and trusted of Ieyasu&#x27;s generals, noted not only for his military prowess, but also for his diplomacy and strategies. At first, he used Sawayama Castle, but was not happy with its situation. The castle was considered obsolete and had weak defenses as it was divided between hilltop and hillside areas. Furthermore, it was formerly the stronghold of the enemy leader and had strong associations with the former regime. Therefore, Ii Naomasa decide to relocate his seat to a new location on the shores of Lake Biwa, constructing a new castle per the latest contemporary design. The site was previously occupied by a Buddhist temple called Hogon-ji which had been built in 1080 and which was a popular pilgrimage site for the worship of Kannon.

Hikone Castle consists of two concentric water moats surrounding a 100 meter hill called &quot;Mount Konki&quot;. The hill itself is divided roughly into three sections, with the &quot;Kane-no-maru&quot; enclosure in the southeast, the &quot;Nishi-no-maru&quot; enclosure in the northwest and the &quot;Honmaru&quot;, or inner bailey in the middle. Dry moats protect these inner enclosures and are crossed by bridges. The faces of the moats were protected by stones. Originally front gate was &quot;Otemon&quot; gate facing westward, but later the &quot;Sawaguchi&quot; gate facing southeast which connected to Nakasendō became the main gate.

To save time and expense, the Ii clan scavenged many stones and buildings by demolishing all other fortifications in their territory and bringing the materials to Hikone. The three-story &quot;tenshu&quot; located at the center of the castle was brought from Ōtsu Castle. Originally built in 1575, the exterior has an older style of decoration on each roof, and the overall structure appears short and stout, as it was modified from what was originally a five-story tower. The &quot;Tenbin yagura&quot; was brought from Nagahama Castle. It is a gate with two two-story &quot;yagura&quot; watchtowers on either side, which protect the dry moats in front of the gate. The &quot;Nishinomaru Sanju Yagura&quot; was brought from Odani Castle.

==History==
However, due to injuries which he had suffered in battle, he died in 1602 when construction had just begun. The castle was finally completed under his son Ii Naokatsu in 1622 after 20 years of construction. The castle was used as the administrative center of Hikone Domain. Often considered the foremost of the &quot;fudai daimyō&quot;, the Ii clan served in many important positions within the Tokugawa shogunate. During the Bakumatsu period, the &quot;tairō&quot; Ii Naosuke was virtual ruler of the country during a time of very weak and ineffectual shoguns. However, his acquiescence in ending Japan&#x27;s national isolation policy under pressure from the western powers led to his assassination by pro-&quot;Sonnō Jōi&quot; forces in 1860. The final &quot;daimyō&quot; of Hikone, Ii Naonori grew increasingly dissatisfied with the hostile treatment still accorded Hikone Domain by the shogunal administration, which was dominated by the Hitotsubashi faction which had been hostile to Ii Naosuke. He also came to the realization that shogunate&#x27;s military system and equipment was now obsolete compared with the Satchō Alliance. Although Hikone Domain had been one of the strongest supporters of the Tokugawa shogunate, he was among the first to support the imperial cause in the Boshin War. During the Battle of Toba-Fushimi, although Hikone forces were stationed at Osaka Castle, they did not join the shogunal army, but simply marched home. The domain later took part in combat against the pro-shogunate Ōgaki Domain, and in other locations. The new Meiji government confirmed him as imperial governor of Hikone. When the new government ordered the dismantling of all feudal-era fortification nationwide, Hikone Castle was spared by a direct request from the emperor himself, who was touring the area. This preserved Hikone Castle intact. Today it remains one of the oldest largely original-construction castles in Japan. 

In 1934, the grounds of the castle were planted with over 1,000 Yoshino cherry trees. The castle and its grounds were donated by the Ii clan to the city of Hikone in 1944. During World War II, the city of Hikone was scheduled for destruction by an air raid on the night of August 15, 1945, but the end of the war occurred at noon that same day and the bombing was not conducted.

The main keep of Hikone Castle, along with its attached Tsuke Turret and Tamon Turret, were designated as a National Treasure by the Ministry of Education, Science, Sports and Culture in 1952.

Several other structures have been accorded Important Cultural Property status. Like the main keep complex, most of these structures are actually complexes of two or more connected buildings:

Major repairs were undertaken to the &quot;tenshu&quot; from 1957 to 1960, and on the various &quot;yagura&quot; from 1960 to 1968. In 1987, the &quot;daimyō&quot; palace was restored as the &quot;Hikone Castle Museum&quot;. Further repairs to the castle were undertaken from 1993 to 1996. On April 6, 2006, Hikone Castle was selected as one of Japan&#x27;s Top 100 Castles by the Japan Castle Foundation in 2006.

The castle is about a 15-minute walk from Hikone Station on the JR West Biwako Line.

<doc id="771690" wikidata="Q58809" url="?curid=771690" title="Adolf Hurwitz">
<text>Adolf Hurwitz (; 26 March 1859 – 18 November 1919) was a German mathematician who worked on algebra, analysis, geometry and number theory.

==Early life==
He was born in Hildesheim, then part of the Kingdom of Hanover, to a Jewish family and died in Zürich, in Switzerland. His father Salomon Hurwitz, a merchant, was not wealthy. Hurwitz&#x27;s mother, Elise Wertheimer, died when he was three years old. Family records indicate that he had siblings and cousins, but their names have yet to be confirmed except for an older brother, Julius, with whom he developed an arithmetical theory for complex continued fractions circa 1890. Hurwitz entered the in Hildesheim in 1868. He was taught mathematics there by Hermann Schubert. Schubert persuaded Hurwitz&#x27;s father to allow him to attend university, and arranged for Hurwitz to study with Felix Klein at Munich. Salomon Hurwitz could not afford to send his son to university, but his friend, Mr. Edwards, assisted financially.

==Educational career==
Hurwitz entered the University of Munich in 1877, aged 18. He spent one year there attending lectures by Klein, before spending the academic year 1877–1878 at the University of Berlin where he attended classes by Kummer, Weierstrass and Kronecker, after which he returned to Munich.

In October 1880, Felix Klein moved to the University of Leipzig. Hurwitz followed him there, and became a doctoral student under Klein&#x27;s direction, finishing a dissertation on elliptic modular functions in 1881. Following two years at the University of Göttingen, in 1884 he was invited to become an Extraordinary Professor at the Albertus Universität in Königsberg; there he encountered the young David Hilbert and Hermann Minkowski, on whom he had a major influence. Following the departure of Frobenius, Hurwitz took a chair at the Eidgenössische Polytechnikum Zürich (today the ETH Zürich) in 1892 (having to turn down a position at Göttingen shortly after), and remained there for the rest of his life.

Throughout his time in Zürich, Hurwitz was in continual ill health, which had been originally caused when he contracted typhoid whilst a student in Munich. He had severe migraines, and then in 1905, his kidneys became diseased and he had one removed.

==Contributions to mathematics==

He was one of the early students of the Riemann surface theory, and used it to prove many of the foundational results on algebraic curves; for instance Hurwitz&#x27;s automorphisms theorem. This work anticipates a number of later theories, such as the general theory of algebraic correspondences, Hecke operators, and Lefschetz fixed-point theorem. He also had deep interests in number theory. He studied the maximal order theory (as it now would be) for the quaternions, defining the Hurwitz quaternions that are now named for him. In the field of control systems and dynamical systems theory he derived the Routh–Hurwitz stability criterion for determining whether a linear system is stable in 1895, independently of Edward John Routh who had derived it earlier by a different method.
In Lie theory, Hurwitz proved the existence of the Haar measure on Lie groups (which Haar then extended to locally compact groups).

==Family==
In 1884, whilst at Königsberg, Hurwitz met and married Ida Samuel, the daughter of a professor in the faculty of medicine. They had three children.

<doc id="771697" wikidata="Q971797" url="?curid=771697" title="Chakram">
<text>The chakram (; ) is a throwing weapon from the Indian subcontinent. It is circular with a sharpened outer edge and a diameter of . It is also known as &quot;chalikar&quot; meaning &quot;circle&quot;, and was sometimes referred to in English writings as a &quot;war-quoit&quot;. The chakram is primarily a throwing weapon, but can also be used hand-to-hand. A smaller variant called &quot;chakri&quot; is worn on the wrist. A related weapon is the &quot;chakri dong&quot;, a bamboo staff with a &quot;chakri&quot; attached at one end.

==History==
The earliest references to the chakram come from the fifth century BCE Indian epics &quot;Mahabharata&quot; and &quot;Ramayana&quot;, where the Sudarshana Chakra is the weapon of the god Vishnu. Contemporaneous Tamil poems from the second century BCE record it as &quot;thikiri&quot; (திகிரி). &quot;Chakra-dhāri&quot; (&quot;chakram-wielder&quot; or &quot;disc-bearer&quot;) is a name for Krishna. The chakram was later used extensively by the Sikhs at least until the days of Ranjit Singh. Even in present days, the Nihangs wear chakkar on their &quot;damalaas &quot;and also in the uniform of Sikh Regiment worn on turban. It came to be associated with Sikhs because of the Nihang practice of wearing chakram on their arms, around the neck and even tied in tiers on high turbans. Portuguese chronicler Duarte Barbosa writes () of the chakram being used in the Delhi Sultanate.

The people of the kingdom ... are very good fighting men and good knights, armed with many kinds of weapons; they are great bowmen, and very strong men; they have very good lances, swords, daggers, steel maces, and battle-axes, with which they fight; and they have some steel wheels, which they call chakarani, two fingers broad, sharp outside like knives, and without edge inside; and the surface of these is of the size of a small plate. And they carry seven or eight of these each, put on the left arm; and they take one and put it on the finger of the right hand, and make it spin round many times, and so they hurl it at their enemies, and if they hit anyone on the arm or leg or neck, it cuts through all. And with these they carry on much fighting, and are very dexterous with them.

From its native India, variations of the chakram spread to other Asian countries. In Tibet and Malaysia, it was not flat but torus-like. Mongol cavalry used a similar throwing weapon with spiked edges.

Chakarani is a name for flat, steel, throwing ring similar to the chakram and used by the Jubba tribe of central Africa.

==Construction==

Chakram are traditionally made from steel or brass which is beaten into a circular shape against an anvil with an indentation for the curvature. Two ends are connected with a piece of brass and then heated, forming a complete circle before the brass is removed. Some chakram, even those used in combat, were ornately engraved, or inlaid with brass, silver or gold.

The chakram is wide and is typically in diameter. The smaller variations are known as &quot;chakri&quot; while the larger ones are called &quot;vada chakra&quot;, which were as large as a shield.

==Techniques==
The chakram&#x27;s combat application is largely dependent on its size. Regular-sized (diameter of , or more) steel chakram could be thrown , while brass chakram, due to their better airfoil design, could be thrown in excess of . If properly constructed, it should be a perfect circle. Warriors trained by throwing chakram at lengths of green bamboo. In single combat, the chakram could be thrown underarm like a modern Aerobie. In battles, it was usually thrown vertically so as to avoid accidentally hitting an ally on the left or right side. A stack of chakram could be quickly thrown one at a time like shuriken. On elephant or horseback, chakram could be more easily thrown than spears or arrows. Because of its aerodynamic circular shape it is not easily deflected by wind.

The most iconic method of throwing a chakram is &quot;tajani&quot;, wherein the weapon is twirled on the index finger of an upraised hand and thrown with a timed flick of the wrist. The spin is meant to add power and range to the throw, while also avoiding the risk of cutting oneself on the sharp outer edge. An adept user can twirl the chakram while using another weapon with the other hand. The use of tajani in battle was perfected by the Nihang who employed a particular formation to protect the chakram-wielder from harm. Although variants of the chakram would make their way to neighbouring parts of the region, the tajani technique appears to have remained unique to Indian martial arts.

The smaller chakri could also be worn on the arms or wrists and used like knuckledusters. When worn on the arms the chakri could be used to break or cut the opponent&#x27;s arms while grappling. The larger &quot;vada chakra&quot; were worn around the neck and thrown or dropped down on the opponent vertically. In the turban, it could be raked across an enemy&#x27;s face or eyes while fighting.

==Modern inventions and applications==
In the 1970s, the American inventor Alan Adler began attempting to improve upon a flying toy disc by considering its design characteristics. He tried streamlining the shape of the disc to reduce drag, but this resulted in a disc that was more unstable in flight. Eventually, inspired by British accounts of deadly Indian weaponry and martial arts, he turned his attention to the ring shape of the chakram. This led to the development of the predecessor of the Aerobie, which was called the &quot;Skyro&quot;.

<text>Ginocchio Historic District, in Marshall, Texas is a historic district listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The district takes its name from the Ginocchio family who operated a hotel, The Ginocchio, in the district during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The district houses numerous historic buildings including: Allen House, The Ginocchio, T&amp;P Depot, the Heflin-Thompson House and the Whaley House. The district is also home to two museums the Harrison County Historical Museum in the Ginocchio and the T&amp;P Railway Museum in the T&amp;P Depot. On January 26, 2007, the Heflin-Thompson House caught fire and suffered much damage. Ricky Thompson, Joel and Michelle Heflin all lost their home and most of their belongings in the fire.

The museum was moved from the Ginocchio hotel to the rear of the Memorial City Hall located at the southeast corner of the town square, and the Ginocchio hotel is currently being renovated with the new Ginocchio Restaurant and Bar slated to open soon.

The T&amp;P museum remains in the depot and is open according to their posted hours.

<doc id="771705" wikidata="Q7337784" url="?curid=771705" title="River Ryton">
<text>The River Ryton is a tributary of the River Idle. It rises close to the Chesterfield Canal near Kiveton Park, and is joined by a series of tributaries near Lindrick Common in the Metropolitan Borough of Rotherham, South Yorkshire, England. Most of its course is in Nottinghamshire, flowing through the town of Worksop. It meanders northwards to join the River Idle near the town of Bawtry on the South Yorkshire-Nottinghamshire border.

While much of its route is rural, its course through Worksop is man made, a result of development and milling. It used to flow through Scrooby, where there was a mill, but was diverted northwards in the 1960s. It supplies water to the Chesterfield Canal through two feeders, and a number of the bridges which cross it are of interest architecturally, which has resulted in them becoming Listed structures.

The water quality of the river is moderate, as a considerable proportion of the total flow is supplied by the processed water from sewage treatment works. Despite this, there are significant populations of fish in the river, and it is used for organised angling.

== Hydrology ==

The region through which the river flows is underlaid by an extensive water-bearing porous rock structure called the Magnesian Limestone aquifer, which is near the surface in the west and dips downwards to the east. Magnesian Limestone is so called because it contains quantities of the mineral Dolomite, which is rich in Magnesium. The Triassic Sherwood Sandstone aquifer is another porous rock layer which covers this to the east, and is the major geological component of the area. Further east, they are both covered by a layer of Mercia Mudstone. Where these aquifers reach the surface, they often supply water to the river system, but can also take water from it. This is affected by the extraction of groundwater, particularly for public water supply, and by fracturing of the aquifers as a result of subsidence caused by deep coal mining.

The Ryton draws its water from the Anston Brook, the Pudding Dyke, the Bondhay Dyke, and to a lesser extent the Broadbridge Dyke. Prior to the construction of the Chesterfield Canal in the 1770s, the flow of the Broadbridge Dyke was much greater, but water from its catchment area was diverted to form the reservoirs at Pebley and Harthill, which supply the canal. Overflow from the reservoirs reaches the Ryton by the Pudding Dyke, but the river also supplies water to the canal via the Brancliffe feeder and the Kilton feeder. The natural water sources are supplemented by the outflows from Dinnington and Anston Sewage Treatment Works into the Anston Brook, which together provide about 7 Ml/d (megalitres per day), while Kilton Treatment Works supplies about 12.8 Ml/d. At Manton, excess flow from the canal tops up the river, and water pumped from Manton Colliery formerly performed the same function. With the closure of the mine, a new borehole was constructed in 2004, and water is pumped from the Sherwood Sandstone aquifer into the river. The borehole is operated by Severn Trent Water.

In order to monitor flows on the river, the Environment Agency maintain gauging stations, one to the east of Worksop and a second to the east of Blyth at Craig y Nos. They also have one on Oldcotes dyke, just below Blyth Old Bridge. The catchment area above the Worksop gauging station is and the mean flow is 8.55 million gallons (38.88 Megalitres) per day. The catchment receives of rainfall in an average year. Oldcoates Dyke contributes 12.92 million gallons (58.75 Ml) per day, and the flow at the Blyth gauging station amounts to 28.89 million gallons (131.3 Ml) per day, derived from a catchment area of . This station has been operational since 1984. Previously, there was a gauging station a little further downstream at Serlby Park, but this was decommissioned in 1978, as the flow readings in the summer were not reliable. Data from the Blyth station is transmitted to the pumping station at West Stockwith, where it is used to control discharges from the River Idle into the River Trent.

Normal river levels at Worksop vary between and , but when the weather is more extreme, can rise up to . The highest level recorded at the gauging station was on 26 June 2007, when it reached .
At Blyth, the normal range is from to , rising to in severe weather. The highest level recorded was on 8 November 2019, when the river level reached .

== Course ==

The River Ryton starts to the east of Kiveton Park, next to the Chesterfield Canal, close to the contour. It is accompanied by the Sheffied to Lincoln Railway line which crosses it three times, before its flow is supplemented by Pudding Dyke, flowing northwards from Thorpe Salvin. It passes under the railway again, and under the freight line from to Doncaster Railport. At Lindrick Dale, Anston Brook, flowing in from beyond Anston to the west, joins on the left bank. Shortly afterwards, the Brancliffe feeder leaves the river, following an S-shaped course to supply water to the Chesterfield Canal near Turner Wood locks. A little further east, it crosses under the Sheffield to Lincoln Line again and through a three-arched aqueduct below the Canal, to pass through Shireoaks. It then loops around the village of Rhodesia, crossing under the Worksop to Nottingham railway line and the A57 Worksop bypass to arrive on the western edge of Worksop.

In Worksop, the river was used to power mills for centuries. Three water mills were mentioned in a survey carried out in 1636, one near the present junction of Westgate and Newcastle Avenue, one called Priory Mill, and a third called Bracebridge mill. All had ceased to operate by 1826, but a new water mill had been constructed further to the west, near to the present junction of Newcastle Avenue and the A57 Worksop bypass. It was known as Beard&#x27;s mill, after its owner Mr. Joseph Beard, and the mill pond was a hive of activity, being used as a skating rink in winter, and for fishing at other times of the year. More exotic activity recorded includes demonstrations of the launching of a lifeboat, and the bathing of elephants when travelling circuses visited the town. The mill building lasted until 1985, when it was demolished to make way for the Worksop bypass.

The course of the Ryton through Worksop is largely man-made. It originally flowed much nearer to Castle Hill, probably forming part of the defences, but was diverted in 1842 into a channel further north when the 4th Duke of Newcastle constructed Newcastle Street, in order to develop that part of the town. The river is then culverted as it passes under a shopping complex and the shops of Bridge Street. This section counts as a confined space, and was surveyed in 2007, in a joint venture between the Environment Agency, a team of divers, and Bassetlaw District Council. Some five tons of debris, half a ton of steel, and some stolen goods were removed from the culvert during the exercise. Beyond Watson Road bridge, sluices and extra channels point to the existence of the mill near the Priory. Priory Water Mill was in use from the medieval period until 1876, and a large lake called the Canch was formed in 1820, by constructing a dam across the leat which fed it. The Canch gradually became polluted, and was filled in when milling ceased in 1876. The buildings were utilised by William Bramer and Sons for their business of making chairs until they burnt down in 1912, and the site has more recently become the location of a sensory garden. Three channels continue under Priorswell Road through separate bridges, cross Bracebridge field, and join up again near the old High Hoe Road bridge.

=== Below Worksop ===
Continuing under the new High Hoe Road bridge, the river passes the derelict Grade II listed Italianate pumping station built in 1881 to pump sewage away from Worksop, before passing under the Chesterfield Canal again, through a 3-arched aqueduct. A feeder, which is at a higher level, passes under the canal through a culvert, and joins the canal through a sluice just below Kilton lock, after which the river and canal run parallel, until they pass through separate arches of a nine-arched viaduct which carries the Sheffield to Lincoln Railway line, opened in 1849. The river then follows a winding course through the estate of Osberton Hall and the village of Scofton, turning north to skirt the western edge of Ranby. Ranby Chequer Bridge marks the point at which the river, having flowed eastwards for most of its course, turns to the north west. The bridge itself can be reached from Ranby village by a footpath which runs along the central reservation of the A1 road for a short distance. The next major crossing is the B6045 at Hodsock Red Bridge, its three arches constructed of red bricks with stone lining, after which an early 19th-century Grade II listed twin-arched bridge carries the drive to Hodsock Priory over the river.
Then comes the A634 to the west of Blyth. The bridge here has three arches, was built for William Mellish of Blyth Hall around 1770, probably by the architect and bridge designer John Carr of York, and is a Grade I listed structure. Despite its age, it is called Blyth New Bridge, to distinguish it from Blyth Old Bridge which carries the same road over Oldcotes Dyke, a little further to the west. Before the next crossing of the B6045, the river is joined by Oldcotes Dyke, which flows eastwards from Roche Abbey, and drainage of the surrounding flood plain from here to the Idle is managed by the Rivers Idle and Ryton Internal Drainage Board. A network of drainage channels accompany the river from here to the junction with the River Idle, passing under the A1 road, collecting the runoff from the drainage channels of Whitewater Common, and skirting Serlby and Scrooby. To the north of Scrooby, the channel passes under the A638 Great North Road, the road into Scrooby village and the East Coast Main Line railway, crossing the contour at the railway bridge. The Great North Road bypassed Scrooby, passing to the west of the village, when it was reconstructed as a turnpike road in 1776. The construction included a number of brick arches, to allow the Ryton to flow under it even in times of flood, which can still be seen from Mill Lane. The river used to flow through the village, and powered Scrooby water mill, an 18th-century mill which was used to grind corn. Milling stopped in 1939, and the river was diverted to follow its present course further to the north in the 1960s. Beyond the railway, flood banks have been raised on both sides of the channel until it meets the River Idle just above Bawtry bridge, the limit of navigation on that river.

== Water quality ==
In order for wildlife, particularly fish, to thrive, the quality of the water needs to be good. The Environment Agency used a six-stage rating scale, from &#x27;A&#x27; to &#x27;F&#x27;, called the General Quality Assessment, to classify rivers. &#x27;A&#x27; on the GQA was the best quality of water, while &#x27;F&#x27; was the poorest. Factors which affect the quality are levels of ammonia, levels of dissolved oxygen and the Biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), which measures the amount of dissolved oxygen needed by organisms to break down organic matter in the water. These factors are generally worse when the water is discharged from sewage treatment processes, and tend to be worse in summer, when such discharges make up a greater proportion of the total flow in the river. Water quality steadily improved as a result of investment in the treatment processes, funded by the water industry&#x27;s Asset Management Plan. Good flows help the water to purify itself. In 2006, the upper Ryton was rated at &#x27;B&#x27; on the GQA scale, and Oldcotes Dyke was rated at &#x27;C&#x27;.

This classification system has been superseded for the water quality within the river systems in England. Each is given an overall ecological status, which may be one of five levels: high, good, moderate, poor and bad. There are several components that are used to determine this, including biological status, which looks at the quantity and varieties of invertebrates, angiosperms and fish. Chemical status, which compares the concentrations of various chemicals against known safe concentrations, is rated as good or fail.

The water quality of the Ryton was as follows in 2019.

The reasons for the ecological quality being less than good include the discharge of effluent from sewage treatment works, and drainage from the transport infrastructure. Oldcotes Dyke is also affected by runoff from agricultural land. Like most rivers in the UK, the chemical status changed from good to fail in 2019, due to the presence of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE), perfluorooctane sulphonate (PFOS) and mercury compounds, none of which had previously been included in the assessment.

The river Ryton supports various types of fish. In 2006, very few lived in the upper reaches, including the Anston Brook, because the water was only of moderate quality. A number of small streams contribute to the improvement of water quality, so that wild brown trout thrive as far as Worksop. Some trout and various types of cyprinids inhabit the water below Worksop, although abstraction of water results in spawning grounds and the habitats where the young fry live drying out during most summers, which has resulted in a decline in their numbers. Nevertheless, the lower reaches are still used for organised angling, and are the only part of the River Idle system where this activity takes place.

<doc id="771717" wikidata="Q223930" url="?curid=771717" title="Game (hunting)">
<text>Game or quarry is any wild animal hunted for animal products (primarily meat), for recreation (&quot;sporting&quot;), or for trophies. The species of animals hunted as game varies in different parts of the world and by different local jurisdictions, though most are terrestrial mammals and birds. Fish caught non-commercially (recreational fishing) are also referred to as game fish.
== By continent and region ==

The range of animal species hunted by humans varies in different parts of the world. This is influenced by climate, faunal diversity, popular taste and locally accepted views about what can or cannot be legitimately hunted. Sometimes a distinction is also made between varieties and breeds of a particular animal, such as wild turkey and domestic turkey. The flesh of the animal, when butchered for consumption, is often described as having a &quot;gamey&quot; flavour. This difference in taste can be attributed to the natural diet of the animal, which usually results in a lower fat content compared to domestic farm-raised animals.

In some countries, game is classified, including legal classifications with respect to licenses required, as either &quot;small game&quot; or &quot;large game&quot;. A single small game licence may cover all small game species and be subject to yearly bag limits. Large game are often subject to individual licensing where a separate permit is required for each individual animal taken (tags).

=== Africa ===
In some parts of Africa, wild animals hunted for their meat are called bushmeat; see that article for more detailed information on how this operates within the economy (for personal consumption and for money) and the law (including overexploitation and illegal imports). Animals hunted for bushmeat include, but are not limited to:
* Various species of antelope, including duikers
* Various species of primates like mandrills or gorillas
* Rodents like porcupines or cane rats
Some of these animals are endangered or otherwise protected, and thus it is illegal to hunt them.

In Africa, animals hunted for their pelts or ivory are sometimes referred to as &quot;big game&quot;.

Also see the legal definition of game in Eswatini.

==== South Africa ====
South Africa is a famous destination for game hunting, with its large biodiversity and therefore impressive variety of game species. Many creatures have returned to former areas from which they were once taken as a result of being killed for big-game hunting. Commonly hunted species include:

* Springbok
* Impala
* Steenbok
* Oribi
* Bushbuck
* Nyala
* Greater kudu
* Common eland
* Blue wildebeest
* Black wildebeest

South Africa also has 62 species of gamebirds, including guineafowl, francolin, partridge, quail, sandgrouse, duck, geese, snipe, bustard and korhaan. Some of these species are no longer hunted, and of the 44 indigenous gamebirds that can potentially be utilised in South Africa, only three, namely the yellow-throated sandgrouse, Delegorgue&#x27;s pigeon and the African pygmy goose warrant special protection. Of the remaining 41 species, 24 have shown an increase in numbers and distribution range in the last 25 years or so. The status of 14 species appears unchanged, with insufficient information being available for the remaining three species. The gamebirds of South Africa where the population status in 2005 was secure or growing are listed below:

* Helmeted guineafowl
* Greywing partridge
* Redwing partridge
* Orange River partridge
* Cape francolin
* Natal francolin

==== United Kingdom ====

In the UK game is defined in law by the Game Act 1831 (1 &amp; 2 Will. 4. c. 32). It is illegal to shoot game on Sundays or at night. Other non-game birds that are hunted for food in the UK are specified under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. UK law defines game as including:
* Black grouse (No longer hunted due to decline in numbers)
* Red grouse
* Brown hare
* Rock ptarmigan
* Grey and red-legged partridges
* Common pheasant

Deer are not included in the definition, but similar controls provided to those in the Game Act apply to deer (from the Deer Act 1991). Deer hunted in the UK are:
* Red deer
* Roe deer
* Fallow deer
* Sika deer
* Muntjac deer
* Chinese water deer
* and hybrids of these deer

Other animals which are hunted in the UK include:
* Duck, including mallard, tufted duck, teal, northern pintail and common pochard
* Goose, including greylag goose, Canada goose and pink-footed goose
* Wood pigeon
* Cuckoo
* Eurasian woodcock
* Common snipe
* Eurasian golden plover
* Corncrake

Capercaillie are not currently hunted in the UK because of a recent decline in numbers and conservation projects towards their recovery. The ban is generally considered voluntary on private lands, and few birds live away from RSPB or Forestry Commission land allegedly.

== Preparation ==
Game meat is typically taken from a wild animal that has been shot with a gun or bow. Hunters must be absolutely certain of their target before shooting and should make every effort to get the animal down as quickly and painlessly as possible. Once obtained, game meat must be processed to avoid spoiling. The method of processing varies by game species and size. Small game and fowl may simply be carried home to be butchered. Large game such as deer is quickly field-dressed by removing the viscera in the field, while very large animals like moose may be partially butchered in the field because of the difficulty of removing them intact from their habitat. Commercial processors often handle deer taken during deer seasons, sometimes even at supermarket meat counters. Otherwise the hunter handles butchering. The carcass is kept cool to minimize spoilage.

Traditionally, game meat was hung until &quot;high&quot; or &quot;gamey&quot;, that is, approaching a state of decomposition. However, this adds to the risk of contamination. Small game can be processed essentially intact, after gutting and skinning or defeathering (by species). Small animals are ready for cooking, although they may be disjointed first. Large game must be processed by techniques commonly practiced by commercial butchers.

== Cooking ==

Generally game is cooked in the same ways as farmed meat. Because some game meat is leaner than store-bought beef, overcooking is a common mishap which can be avoided if properly prepared. It is sometimes grilled or cooked longer or by slow cooking or moist-heat methods to make it more tender, since some game tends to be tougher than farm-raised meat. Other methods of tenderizing include marinating as in the dish Hasenpfeffer, cooking in a game pie or as a stew such as burgoo.

== Safety ==
The Norwegian Food Safety Authority considers that children, pregnant women, fertile-aged women, and people with high blood pressure should not consume game shot with lead-based ammunition more than once a month. Children who often eat such game might develop a slightly lower IQ, as lead influences the development of the central nervous system. This can be avoided by hunting with arrows or copper bullets.

<text>A bichon is a distinct type of toy dog; it is typically kept as a companion dog. Believed to be descended from the Barbet, it is believed the bichon-type dates to at least the 11th century; it was relatively common in 14th-century France, where they were kept as pets of the royalty and aristocracy. From France, these dogs spread throughout the courts of Europe, with dogs of very similar form being seen in a number of portraits of the upper classes of Germany, Portugal and Spain; from Europe, the type also spread to colonies in Africa and South America. The name &quot;bichon&quot; is believed to be a contraction of &quot;barbichon&quot;, which means &quot;little barbet&quot;.

==Breeds==
===Bichon Frisé===
The Bichon Frisé, formally known as the Bichon Tenerife, Tenerife dog or Canary Island lap dog, was bred on the island of Tenerife; it was believed to be descended from bichon-type dogs introduced from Spain in the 16th century. From the Canary Islands, the breed was imported back to the Continent where it became the sometimes favourite of the European courts, its fortunes depending upon the fashions of the time; during an ebb in the breed&#x27;s popularity it found its way into a number of circuses, performing throughout Europe with organ grinders. The breed again fell out of favour from the end of the 19th century and it was due to the efforts of Belgian and French enthusiasts in the 1930s that rescued it from extinction, which is why it is today recognised as a Franco-Belgian dog breed.

===Bolognese===
The Bolognese, also known as the Bichon Bolognese, Bolognese toy dog, Bologneser, Gutschen Hundle or Schoshundle, takes its name from the northern Italian city of Bologna. It is usually claimed the breed descends from the Maltese. It is believed examples of the breed were kept by the Medici family, who gave these dogs as gifts to garner favour. it is said that Louis XIV of France, Philip II of Spain and Catherine the Great of Russia, among other European rulers, all kept some.

===Bolonka===
The Bolonka, also known as the Bolonka Zwetna, is a recently developed breed from Russia. It is a coloured variation of the white Bolonka Franzuska that was established as a breed in 1988.
===Bolonka Franzuska===
The name of the breed means French lap dog (franzuskaja = French, Bolonka = lap dog, French Bichon). Since the Renaissance, Bolognese lap dogs have enjoyed great popularity and admiration in princely and royal houses. The close ties between the French and Russian nobility led to the spread of the lap dogs of the French ladies to tsarist Russia. Even Catherine the Great loved and adored these dwarf puppies. She owned a few puppies during her reign at the Romanov Tsar&#x27;s Court.

===Coton de Tuléar===
The Coton de Tuléar takes its name from the Madagascan port town of Tuléar, where it originated. The ancestors of these dogs were likely brought to Madagascar in the 17th century, where they became extremely popular with the local ruling class; they became so popular that laws were passed to prevent them being owned by commoners. The breed was relatively unknown to the outside world until the 1970s, when examples were exported to Europe and North America.
===Havanese===
The Havanese, also known as the Cuban shock dog, Bichon Havanais, Havana silk dog, Havana Spaniel, Havana Bichon or sometimes just the Havana, is a bichon-type breed from Cuba, taking its name from Havana. The breed is believed to be descended from bichon-type dogs imported to Cuba by Europeans in the 18th century, where it thrived. The breed&#x27;s fortunes turned with the Cuban Revolution in the 1950s; the Communists saw these dogs as the property of the former elite and sought to eliminate such dogs; the breed was saved by expatriates who fled with their pets to the United States.
===Löwchen===
The Löwchen, whose name means &quot;little lion dog&quot; in German, is another French breed of the bichon-type. The breed was known as early as the 16th century; by the 1970s, it was estimated only 70 remained, although thanks to a publicity drive the breed has recovered. Usually clipped to resemble a lion with a mane, when its hair grows naturally its resemblance to other breeds of the type is clear.
===Maltese===
The Maltese, sometimes called the Bichon Maltaise, is claimed to be descended from dogs brought to Malta by the Phoenicians in ancient times. Proponents of this theory cite ancient artwork from Malta with dogs of similar form, although the first concrete record of this breed dates from 1805 when the Knights of Malta wrote that the once famous local dog was almost extinct. Today&#x27;s Maltese is likely the result of subsequent crosses, and they became increasingly popular throughout the 19th and 20th centuries.

<text>Sir Henry Enfield Roscoe (7 January 1833 – 18 December 1915) was a British chemist. He is particularly noted for early work on vanadium, photochemical studies, and his assistance in creating Oxo (food), in its earlier liquid form.

== Life and work ==
Henry Enfield Roscoe was born in London, the son of Henry Roscoe (1800–1836) and Maria Roscoe, née Fletcher (1798–1885), and grandson of William Roscoe (1753–1831). Stanley Jevons the Australian economist was a cousin.

Roscoe studied at the Liverpool Institute for Boys and University College London. He then went to Heidelberg to work under Robert Bunsen, who became a lifelong friend. He also befriended William Dittmar. In 1857, Roscoe returned to England with Dittmar and was appointed to the chair of chemistry at Owens College, Manchester, with Dittmar as his assistant. In 1858 the state of the college was such that the &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot; called it &quot;a mortifying failure&quot;. In the same year Roscoe was accosted by a tramp near the college who asked him if it was the night asylum; he wrote &quot;I replied that it was not but if he would call again in six months&#x27; time he might find lodgings there.&quot; Roscoe remained at the college until 1886 by which time the Victoria University had been established. In 1881 he was a founder, and first president, of the Society of Chemical Industry and was also chair of the Manchester Section of the Society. From 1885 to 1895 he was MP for Manchester South. He served on several royal commissions appointed to consider educational questions, in which he was keenly interested, and from 1896 to 1902 was vice-chancellor of the University of London. He was knighted in 1884.

Roscoe&#x27;s scientific work includes a memorable series of researches carried out with Bunsen between 1855 and 1862, in which they laid the foundations of comparative photochemistry. In 1864 they carried out what is reputed to be the first flash photography, using magnesium as a light source. In 1867, Roscoe began an elaborate investigation of vanadium and its compounds, and devised a process for preparing it pure in the metallic state, at the same time showing that the substance which had previously passed for the pure metal was contaminated with oxygen. In so doing he corrected Berzelius&#x27;s value for the atomic mass. Roscoe was awarded the 1868 Bakerian Lecture for this work. He also carried out researches on niobium, tungsten, uranium, perchloric acid, and the solubility of ammonia.

Roscoe was elected an International Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1890.

He was the uncle of Beatrix Potter. The mineral Roscoelite was named after him, due to its vanadium content and Roscoe&#x27;s work on that element.

Roscoe received an honorary doctorate (LL.D) from the University of Glasgow in June 1901. In 1903, he was elected an International Member of the American Philosophical Society. In November 1909 he was sworn in the Privy Council. He was awarded the Franklin Institute&#x27;s Elliott Cresson Medal in 1912.

He died in Woodcote on 18 December 1915.

== Publications ==
Roscoe&#x27;s publications include, besides several elementary books on chemistry that had a wide circulation and were translated into many foreign languages, &quot;Lectures on Spectrum Analysis&quot; (1869); a &quot;Treatise on Chemistry&quot; (the first edition of which appeared in 1877–1892); &quot;A New View of Dalton&#x27;s Atomic Theory&quot;, with Dr Arthur Harden (1896); and an Autobiography (1906). The &quot;Treatise on Chemistry&quot;, written in collaboration with Carl Schorlemmer (1834–1892), who was appointed his private assistant at Manchester in 1859, official assistant in the laboratory in 1861, and professor of organic chemistry in 1874, was long regarded as a standard work. Roscoe&#x27;s &quot;Lessons in Elementary Chemistry&quot; (1866) passed through many editions in the UK and abroad.

<doc id="771729" wikidata="Q2249908" url="?curid=771729" title="High-Rise (novel)">
<text>High-Rise is a 1975 novel by British writer J. G. Ballard. The story describes the disintegration of a luxury high-rise building as its affluent residents gradually descend into violent chaos. As with Ballard&#x27;s previous novels &quot;Crash&quot; (1973) and &quot;Concrete Island&quot; (1974), &quot;High-Rise&quot; inquires into the ways in which modern social and technological landscapes could alter the human psyche in provocative and hitherto unexplored ways. It was adapted into a film of the same name, in 2015, by director Ben Wheatley.

==Plot==
Following his divorce, doctor and medical-school lecturer Robert Laing moves into his new apartment on the 25th floor of a recently completed high-rise building on the outskirts of London. This tower block provides its affluent tenants all the conveniences and commodities that modern life has to offer: a supermarket, bank, restaurant, hair salon, swimming pools, a gymnasium, its own school, and high-speed lifts. Its cutting-edge amenities allow the occupants to gradually become uninterested in the outside world, providing them with accommodation and a secure environment.

Laing meets fellow tenants Charlotte Melville, a secretary who lives one floor above him, and Richard Wilder, a documentary film-maker who lives with his family on the building&#x27;s lower floors. Life in the high-rise begins to degenerate quickly, as minor power failures and petty grievances among neighbours and between rival floors escalate into an orgy of violence. Skirmishes become frequent throughout the building as whole floors of tenants try to claim lifts and hold them for their own. Groups gather to defend their rights to the swimming pools, and party-goers attack &quot;enemy floors&quot; to raid and vandalise them. The lower, middle, and upper floors of the building gradually stratify into distinct groups.

It does not take long for the occupants to ignore social restraints, abandoning life outside the building and devoting their time to the escalation of violence inside; people quit their jobs, and families stay indoors permanently, losing all sense of time. As the amenities of the high-rise break down and bodies begin to pile up, no one considers leaving or alerting the authorities, instead exploring the newly-found urges and desires engendered by the building&#x27;s disintegration. As Laing navigates the new environment, Wilder sets out to reach floor 40—the top of the building—and finally confront the building&#x27;s architect, Anthony Royal.

==Legacy==
&quot;High-Rise&quot; was known to be among Joy Division singer Ian Curtis&#x27;s favourite books. The book has been cited as an influence upon the 1987 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial &quot;Paradise Towers&quot;. Hawkwind used the book as the basis for a song of the same name on their 1979 album &quot;PXR5&quot;.

Some critics have pointed out the thematic similarities between the novel and Canadian filmmaker David Cronenberg&#x27;s early film &quot;Shivers, a.k.a. They Came from Within&quot; (1975). Aside from the fact that they both came out the same year, both the book and the film tell a story in which the tenants of a humongous, isolated hi-tech residential building wind up descending into an anarchic orgy of sex and violence. Although lacking in formal precision and narrative tightness, compared to Cronenberg&#x27;s later, more mature films, it has been suggested that this is a truer (yet serendipitous) adaptation of the novel than Ben Wheatley&#x27;s 2015 version. Cronenberg later undertook the challenging project of adapting into film Ballard&#x27;s debut novel, &quot;Crash&quot; (1973), —a novel considered unfilmable up until then— about a subculture of people who fetishise car accidents. The 1996 film version stars James Spader, Holly Hunter and Elias Koteas.

In a lecture on J. G. Ballard with John Gray, Will Self represented &quot;Withnail and I&quot; director Bruce Robinson&#x27;s interpretation of the story which has &quot;the unconscious, the car park of the building, penetrating the ego in the conquest of the super ego in the top of the building.&quot; He then stated that Ballard would have hated that interpretation, with Self preferring instead the interpretation that &quot;Freudian ideas swirl and fail to coalesce,&quot; as they are &quot;appropriated by individual mythomanes without actually reflecting an external reality.&quot;

Canadian post-rock band Godspeed You! Black Emperor listed it on their recommended reading list to coincide with their appearance at and curation of the All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties festival in 2010.

==Artwork==
The cover of the novel&#x27;s first edition shows a high rise in Berlin&#x27;s Hansaviertel designed by the German architect Hans Schwippert.

==Film adaptation==

For over 30 years, British producer Jeremy Thomas had wanted to do a film version of the book. It was nearly made in the late 1970s, with Nicolas Roeg directing from a script by Paul Mayersberg. Later attempts with Canadian film-maker Vincenzo Natali attached to write and direct also failed, before the film adaptation was finally made in 2014.

With Jeremy Thomas producing, Ben Wheatley directing from a script by Amy Jump, and Tom Hiddleston starring in the lead role, the film had its world première at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 13, 2015, and was widely released in early 2016.

<text>Zelenograd (, , ) is a city and administrative okrug of Moscow, Russia. The city of Zelenograd and the territory under its jurisdiction form the Zelenogradsky Administrative Okrug (ZelAO), an exclave located within Moscow Oblast, north-west of central Moscow, along the M10 highway. Zelenograd is the smallest administrative okrug of Moscow by area, the second-lowest by population, and the largest Moscow exclave by area and by population within Moscow Oblast. Zelenograd, if it were a separate settlement, would be the fifth-largest city in Moscow Oblast and one of the 100 largest cities of Russia. Before the expansion of the territory of Moscow in 2012, Zelenograd occupied second place among the administrative okrugs of Moscow, second only to the Eastern Administrative Okrug, in terms of the share of greenery in its total area (approximately 30%).

Zelenograd was founded in 1958 as a new town in the Soviet Union, and developed as a center of electronics, microelectronics and the computer industry known as the &quot;Soviet/Russian Silicon Valley&quot;. It remains an important center of electronics in Russia. The city color is green and its emblematic animal is the squirrel.

==History==
Zelenograd was founded in 1958 as an unnamed planned city near the village and railway station of Kryukovo on a previously empty, forested place, and its architecture and civic layout yields to one general architectural plan (chief architects Igor Rozhin (1956–1963), then Igor Pokrovsky (1963–2002)), which has appreciable influence from the garden city movement, the development of the Tapiola district in Finland, and new towns in the United Kingdom (Harlow and others).

The city was planned as a center of the textile industry initially, but in 1962, Alexander Shokin (Chairman of State Committee of Electronic Technology, then first Minister of Electronic Technology) proposed to change the line of future city business to electronics. Some researchers of Soviet electronics history mentioned that a similar idea was proposed to the Soviet government by two fugitive Silicon Valley engineers - Alfred Sarant (more known in Russia as &quot;Philip Staros&quot;) and Joel Barr (&quot;Joseph Berg&quot;).

On January 15, 1963, the city received official city status and name &quot;Zelenograd&quot;, and on November 25, 1968, Zelenograd received the status of district of Moscow (one of the 30 districts) simultaneously.

In 1988, Zelenograd incorporated the former village of Kryukovo, one of the important sites during the Battle of Moscow (October 1941 – January 1942). Several monuments to the Defenders of Moscow and the heroes of the Great Patriotic War are located in Zelenograd and the surrounding area, the most famous of which is the &quot;Shtyki&quot; Memorial, from which the remains of the Unknown Soldier were taken for reinterment at the Kremlin Wall in the Alexander Garden in Moscow.

Before 1989, Zelenograd was a de facto closed city in some aspects: it was prohibited to take photos in the central parts of the city, near the plants, teaching and research facilities, and foreigners were not admitted into the city.

In 1991, Zelenograd was reformed in one of the administrative okrugs of Moscow.

==Geography==
The Skhodnya River originates near the village of Alabushevo (one of settlements, which are under Zelenograd jurisdiction) and forms two ponds within the precincts of city - Small and Large City Pond.

===Administrative divisions===
Zelenogradsky Administrative Okrug is divided into five districts:

<doc id="771734" wikidata="Q429887" url="?curid=771734" title="Rugby union at the Summer Olympics">
<text>Rugby union has been a men&#x27;s medal sport at the modern Summer Olympic Games, being played at four of the first seven competitions. The sport debuted at the 1900 Paris games where the gold medal was won by the host nation. It was subsequently featured at the London games in 1908, the Antwerp games in 1920 and the Paris games in 1924.

Shortly after the 1924 games, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) dropped rugby union as an Olympic sport. Since then there have been numerous attempts to bring the sport back to the Olympic programme. In October 2009 the IOC voted at its session in Copenhagen to include the sevens version of the sport in the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. The event made its debut in an Olympic programme at the 2014 Summer Youth Olympics.

==Inclusion==
The sport was introduced by Pierre de Coubertin, who is famous for reviving the modern Olympics. He also helped to establish rugby in France, refereeing the first domestic French club championship in 1892 and France&#x27;s first international, on New Year&#x27;s Day, 1906, at Parc des Princes. Coubertin formed the IOC in 1894, but rugby union was not featured until the II Olympiad.

===1900===
Three National Olympic Committees (NOCs), France, Germany and Great Britain, entered teams at the 1900 games. 

The teams were not national teams in the current sense of the word: the Union des Sociétés Françaises de Sports Athlétiques represented France, the Moseley Wanderers RFC represented Great Britain, and the FC 1880 Frankfurt represented Germany. 
Rules were also different from today&#x27;s: while points for penalties and conversions were worth three and two points respectively, the same as in the modern game, three points were awarded for tries (as opposed to the modern five), while four points were given for a drop goal (as opposed to the modern three). 

Also, four points were awarded for a goal from mark; this would be reduced to three points in 1905, and was deleted from the rules in 1977.

France won the gold, beating Great Britain by 27 points to 8 and defeating Germany by 27 points to 17. Some sources list the German team as second on the points difference, but no such determination was made in 1900. 6,000 people watched the game between France and Great Britain, which was the largest crowd at the Games. 

Two players on the French team were not of French nationality: Constantin Henriquez was from Haiti and André Roosevelt was an American, therefore, later IOC attributed the French medal to the Mixed team. Constantin Henriquez, a player on the French team, is the first known coloured athlete to compete in the Olympic Games.

===1908===
Rugby union was not played at the 1904 games in St. Louis, nor at the 1906 Intercalated Games, but was included in 1908, when the Olympics were held in the sport&#x27;s native country. 

The Rugby Football Union (RFU) was involved in the organization of the sport at this edition of the Olympics. Like the 1900 Games, three teams entered: Australasia (representing Australia and New Zealand), France, and hosts Great Britain (which included the whole of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland), but France pulled out prior to the commencement of the tournament, due to being unable to field a representative team. 

Australasia was represented by the Wallabies, who were already on tour in Britain. As the best English and Welsh players were on tour in New Zealand at the time, Great Britain was represented by the Cornwall county team, who were chosen by the RFU as an appropriate side after they defeated Durham to win the 1907 English County Championship. The choice of Cornwall was controversial, as only three of their players had ever represented England and the Wallabies had defeated them 18 points to five.

As expected, Australasia defeated Great Britain, claiming the gold medal, the score being 32 points to three. The match at the White City Stadium was played under poor conditions, in fog and on a slippery field. Two of the Australian team members would later win another Olympic gold medal: Danny Carroll would win another rugby gold with the United States in 1920, while Sydney Middleton would win a gold medal in rowing at the 1912 Games, where rugby was not on the programme. The sport also failed to appear on the provisional schedule of the 1916 Summer Olympics, which were cancelled due to World War I.

===1920===
A campaign to send an American side to the 1920 games in Antwerp started in California after a Berkeley rugby union touring party returned from British Columbia undefeated in 1920. The United States Olympic Committee (USOC) granted permission for their entry. A pool of players from Stanford, Berkeley, and Santa Clara made up the squad. 1908 champion Danny Carroll, a player-coach at Stanford at the time, was the team&#x27;s most prominent member. 

By the time the U.S. arrived in Antwerp, the Czech and Romanian teams had withdrawn, while the English RFU had declined an invitation to enter a team, to avoid interfering with the start of the English domestic season. This left France and the United States as the only teams.

Their match was played in rain in front of around 20,000 spectators, with the U.S., featuring many players new to the sport of rugby, causing a shock by winning by eight points to nil, all points being scored in the second half. 

One of the U.S. team members, Morris Kirksey, took home two more medals from Antwerp, finishing second to Charles Paddock in the 100 meters dash, and anchoring the winning 4 × 100 meters relay team.

===1924===

The sport was again included in the subsequent 1924 Games in Paris. The USOC decided to send a team, while the host nation and Romania entered. The American team was again made up of mainly Californian players. The U.S. squad departed on a seven-day voyage to England on an ocean liner from New York City.

France defeated Romania 59-3 and entered the final game as favorites. 

The gold medal game was played on 18 May in front of 30,000 spectators at the Colombes venue. During the final, French fans booed and hissed the American team throughout. French fans also threw bottles and rocks onto the field and at American players and officials, wild brawls broke out in the stands, and U.S. spectator Gideon Nelson was knocked unconscious after being hit in the face by a walking stick.

The Americans won the gold medal by 17-3. At the final whistle, French fans invaded the pitch, forcing police, and French players and officials, to protect the Americans. At the medal ceremony, &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; was drowned out by the booing and hissing of French fans, and the American team had to be escorted to their locker room under police protection.

Rare vintage footage of the 1924 Gold Medal match was included in the rugby documentary, A Giant Awakens: the Rise of American Rugby.

==Exclusion==
The crowd violence during, and the pitch invasion after, the 1924 Olympic Final served to give rugby a poor image. This, combined with the problems of attracting sufficient teams to make it a viable competition, the desire to include more individual and women&#x27;s events, and the departure of a major advocate when Baron Pierre De Coubertin stepped down as head of the Olympic Movement in 1925, marked the downfall of rugby at the Olympics. In 1928, the IOC turned down a request to stage rugby at the Amsterdam Games. 

An exhibition tournament was held at the 1936 Berlin Games, with France, Germany, Italy and Romania competing. In what is the last rugby union match played at the Olympics as of 2021, France beat Germany in the final 19 to 14.

In 1976, 22 African countries and Guyana demanded that New Zealand be banned from the Olympics in Montreal due to a New Zealand rugby team touring South Africa, which had been banned from the Olympics since 1964 because of its apartheid politics. 

As rugby union was no longer an Olympic sport, the IOC declined to ban New Zealand, and these 23 nations boycotted the 1976 Olympics.

==Efforts for re-inclusion==
===Fifteens===

Italy in 1960, the Soviet Union in 1980, and South Korea in 1988 made requests to have rugby union brought back. The 1980 request did not pass, and the 1988 games came close but failed to see the sport&#x27;s admission, which was backed by the International Rugby Football Board (now, World Rugby (WR)).

Apart from supporting the individual host cities&#x27; requests, the IRB did not focus its own efforts on returning the sport to the Olympics until the early 1990s, when efforts began to reunite the two movements with a series of informal meetings between the then IRB Secretary, Keith Rowlands, and the British Olympic Association Secretary, Dick Palmer. In 1994, when Vernon Pugh QC of Wales was elected Chairman of the IRB, the march towards Olympic recognition began in earnest. Pugh convinced the IRB Council that Olympic membership – initially as a non-participation sport – would be beneficial to rugby and offer the IRB member unions membership of their National Olympic Committees. Many European Federations, such as France, Italy and Romania, had been members of their National Olympic Committees for decades. The demand to get rugby back in the Olympics mounted as more rugby nations from Africa, Asia, Oceania and the Americas joined the IRB, because it was a sport seen as providing a realistic medal opportunity for a number of smaller nations.

A significant step in the process of acceptance back into the Olympic Movement was achieved at a ceremony held in Cardiff in November 1994, when the IRB was officially confirmed as a Recognised International Federation of the IOC. At that ceremony, International Olympic Committee President, Juan Antonio Samaranch, pointed out that rugby&#x27;s history and values were very much in tune with the Olympic philosophy and traditions. This historic meeting in Cardiff led to IRB representation at annual IOC meetings and consideration for inclusion in the programme of future Olympic Games. In 2002, a plan was presented to induct rugby sevens, golf and the Chinese martial art of wushu.

<text>Frederick Scott Archer (1813 – 1 May 1857) was an English photographer and sculptor who is best known for having invented the photographic collodion process which preceded the modern gelatin emulsion. He was born in either Bishop&#x27;s Stortford or Hertford, within the county of Hertfordshire, England (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland) and is remembered mainly for this single achievement which greatly increased the accessibility of photography for the general public.

==Life==
Scott Archer was the second son of a butcher in Bishops Stortford in Hertfordshire who went to London to take an apprenticeship as a goldsmith and silversmith with Mr. Massey of 116 Leadenhall Street.
On the recommendation of Edward Hawkins he trained at the Royal Academy Schools as a sculptor and found calotype photography useful as a way of capturing images of his sculptures. 
Dissatisfied with the poor definition and contrast of the calotype and the long exposures needed, Scott Archer invented the new process in 1848 and published it in &quot;The Chemist&quot; in March 1851, enabling photographers to combine the fine detail of the daguerreotype with the ability to print multiple paper copies like the calotype. In publishing his discovery, he did so knowingly without first patenting it, giving it as a gift to the world.

As a sculptor, he exhibited at the Royal Academy from 1836 until 1851.

He died impoverished, as since he did not patent the collodion process, he made very little money from it. 
An obituary described him as &quot;a very inconspicuous gentleman, in poor health.&quot;

His family received a gift of £747 after his death, raised by public subscription, and a small pension was also provided to support his three children after the death of their mother.

The Royal Photographic Society has a small collection of Scott Archer&#x27;s photographs; some are also held in the Victoria and Albert Museum.

Archer died on 1 May 1857 of a hereditary cystic disease of the liver which had plagued him for his last 11 weeks and is buried at Kensal Green Cemetery in London.

<doc id="771740" wikidata="Q2125192" url="?curid=771740" title="Race Across America">
<text>The Race Across America, or RAAM, is an ultra-distance road cycling race held across the United States that started in 1982 as the Great American Bike Race. 

RAAM is one of the longest annual endurance events in the world. All entrants must prove their abilities by competing in any of several qualifying events, completing a course within a specified time period.

Currently, RAAM is several hundred miles longer than the Tour de France, and the two races differ in many other aspects. The courses of both races have varied over the years. However, in the Race Across America, the direction has always been from the west coast to the east coast of the United States, approximately 3,000 miles (4,800 km), making it a transcontinental event. More importantly, the race has no stages, i.e., it is a nonstop event from start to finish, with the fastest competitors needing slightly over 7 days to complete the course. By contrast, the Tour de France features a different route each year (alternating between clockwise and counterclockwise circuits around France) and is about 2,300 miles long; the distance is divided into individual daily stages spread over the course of about 3 weeks including rest days and contested at much higher on-bike speeds, but much lower overall average speed.


==History==

The first incarnation of RAAM, The Great American Bike Race, was organized by John Marino in 1982. There were four competitors: John Marino himself, John Howard, Michael Shermer, and Lon Haldeman. The course started in Santa Monica, California and finished at the Empire State Building in New York City, where Haldeman emerged as the winner.

Results of the 1982 race:

After the first year, the name of the event changed to Race Across America, and participation became subject to qualification rather than invitation. The concept caught on and the event grew larger year after year, with riders from around the world showing up to compete. The race was televised on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Wide World of Sports&quot; through 1986. In 1989, team divisions were added to introduce new elements of technology and strategy: a category for HPVs and faired bikes resulted in record speeds, and a four-man team division gave racers the option of riding together or taking turns, allowing them to balance higher speeds against longer rest periods.

In addition to races across the full span of the United States, shorter races with a similar format have been included within RAAM; among these are a 24-hour version and the Race Across the West (RAW), typically ending in Durango, Colorado.

The solo division of the 2018 race began on June 12 in Oceanside, California; teams started on June 16, 2018. The finish line was once again in Annapolis, Maryland.


===Divisions===

The race has been held in many different divisions over the years. In 2008, for example, these were:
* RAAM: Solo Female
* RAAM: Solo Male
* RAAM: Solo Male (50–59)
* RAAM: Solo Male (60–69)

* Race Across the West: Solo Female
* Race Across the West: Two-Person Mixed (50–59)
* Race Across the West: Four-Person Male
* 24 Hour: Four-Person Female
* 24 Hour: Eight Person

===Fatalities and injuries===

There have been three fatalities in the race&#x27;s history. In 2003, team rider Brett Malin was killed when he was hit by an 18-wheel tractor-trailer outside Pie Town, New Mexico. In 2005, solo participant Bob Breedlove was killed in a collision with an oncoming vehicle near Trinidad, Colorado. Details are lacking because he was by himself (his support crew was a few miles behind) and the only witnesses were in the vehicle that collided with him. &quot;Outside&quot; magazine investigated the crash in its November 2006 issue.

On June 16, 2010, participant Diego Ballesteros Cucurull of Spain was critically injured when he was struck by a car near Wichita, Kansas. A little less than one month later, Ballesteros was home in Spain and undergoing rehabilitation. While not regaining the ability to walk, he continued to cycle using a handbike. Canadian cyclist Wayne Phillips was paralyzed 1985 when he was struck by a hit-and-run driver in New Mexico.

On June 15, 2015, while in 3rd place, Anders Tesgaard of Denmark was hit by an inattentive truck driver in West Virginia. The driver came from behind and hit Tesgaard at 60 mph. Tesgaard suffered a severe brain injury and multiple fractured bones. He was quickly flown to a hospital, where he went into a coma. He later stabilized and flown back to Denmark. However, he remained in a coma until his death on February 16, 2018.

On June 18, 2018, while in 3rd place, Austrian rider Thomas Mauerhofer was hit by a car while he made a left turn. He broke his sixth cervical vertebra and had to quit the race. Cervical vertebrae 5 to 7 had to be fused and a fragment of bone was removed. Unable to train for months, he was able to compete again the following year.

==Race structure==
As noted above, unlike most multi-day bicycle races such as the Tour de France, RAAM has a single stage, i.e., there is no specified distance to travel each day. There are no designated rest periods for food and sleep, whose timing must be decided by racers and their crews. The clock runs continuously from start to finish as in a time trial, and the final overall finish time includes rest periods. Thus, the winner is the rider who can best combine fast riding with short and infrequent stops. The winner usually finishes in eight to nine days, after riding approximately 22 hours per day through the varied terrain of the United States. The addition of the 8-person team division has enabled finish times of slightly over five days. Each racer or team has a support crew that follows in vehicles to provide food, water, mechanical repairs and medical aid. During the night, a vehicle with flashing lights is required to follow each rider to ensure safety.

Having to ride continuously for days with little to no sleep puts this event in the category of ultra-distance cycling races. The continuous physical output places considerable strain on the competitors as well as their support crews. As many as 50% of solo participants drop out due to exhaustion or for medical reasons. In addition, the race takes place on open roads, forcing participants to deal with sometimes dangerous traffic conditions. This represents another major difference between RAAM and more traditional bicycle road races on closed courses.

In 2006 the race format changed significantly with the addition of a Solo Enduro division, in which riders were obliged to rest off the bike for a total of 40 hours at specified points across the country. The 40 hours were to be deducted from a rider&#x27;s total time at the end of the race. These changes were made to improve safety and shift the emphasis to long-distance riding speed and away from the capacity to endure sleep deprivation. Because the intention was to phase out the traditional format, it was announced that henceforth the official RAAM champion would be the winner of the Solo Enduro division. In the first year the winner was 50-year-old Jonathan Boyer, who had won the fourth edition of RAAM twenty-one years earlier. However, interest in the Enduro format rapidly faded among riders, and the division was soon eliminated. The official RAAM champion is now the winner of the Solo Traditional division, which simply measures total elapsed time from west coast to east coast.

The Trans Am Bike Race is similar to RAAM in that it is a non-stop bicycle race across the US, but it covers an even longer distance and riders are self-supported, meaning that all support from other racers, friends, family, or organizers is forbidden. Supplies and services must be obtained from commercial sources and no support vehicles are allowed.

== Records ==

Because the course has varied, performances from different years are not entirely comparable. Records are usually expressed in terms of average speed, not total time, to account in part for differences in course length. For many years, the fastest men&#x27;s speed was by Pete Penseyres in 1986, when he rode at an average of . This record was finally broken in 2013 by Christoph Strasser, who then smashed his own record the following year by riding at . The fastest woman was Seana Hogan in 1995, who averaged over .

For many years, the shortest elapsed time for a solo crossing of the United States was outside of an official RAAM, by Michael Secrest in 1990, in 7 days, 23 hours, and 16 minutes. Again, this record was narrowly broken in 2013 by RAAM winner Christoph Strasser, who in 2014 set the current mark of 7:15:56. In comparison, in 1953 Corporal Donald Mainland, USMC (retired), raced from Santa Monica, California to New York City, a distance of 2,963 miles. Limiting himself to riding 10 hours per day, he completed the race in 14 days, 11 hours and 50 minutes, besting the previous record by 6 days. He rode about 200 miles a day, averaging about 20 mph. Prior to this, he was stationed in Japan and raced frequently in their &quot;Keirin,&quot; bicycle racing track sport. He owns a machining company in Racine, Wisconsin, and produced the bicycle frames for the 1972 Olympics, built many of the chrome Schwinn Paramounts in the 1970s and the Schwinn Superiors in the 1980s.

With his sixth win in 2019, Christoph Strasser passed the late Jure Robič of Slovenia as the all-time record holder for solo RAAM victories. He is also the first to take three Titles in a row. Robič was killed in September 2010 in a collision with a car while training for the Crocodile Trophy, the endurance mountain bike race held annually in Australia. He was the RAAM title-holder at the time of his death.

In its traditional form, RAAM is a solo competitor event – a non-stop individual time trial. As noted above, this idea was expanded in 1989 with the creation of the new HPV (Human Powered Vehicle) category as a four-person relay; race organizers called this the Human Powered Vehicle Race Across America. HPV RAAM was slated as a platform for technology advancement in cycling aerodynamics and human powered propulsion, but it also paved the way for more team competitions thereafter. Favored to win, Team Gold Rush led most of the way but did not finish. First, second and third places went to Team Lightning, Team Cronos and Team Strawberry, respectively. Team Lightning set the overall fastest RAAM time of 5:01:08 over a shorter course of , a record which still stands over 2 decades later. In later years team members could ride together to take advantage of drafting, so speeds improved, but in the 1989 race there could only be one rider on the road at a time.

Team Action Sports from Bakersfield, California, established the record for the four-person male division in 2004. The team, whose members were Nathaniel Faulkner, Kerry Ryan, Sean Nealy, and William Innes, averaged to complete the in 5:08:17. The record for an eight-person team was established by Team Bemer in 2022. This squad of riders completed in 5:01:52, for an average speed of .

In 2021, Leah Goldstein set the record as the first woman to win the overall solo division. As of 2023, women have been RAAM overall winners twice.

<text>Campoformido (; archaically &quot;Campoformio&quot;; ) is a town and (municipality) in the Regional decentralization entity of Udine in Friuli-Venezia Giulia, north-eastern Italy, with a population of 7743 (December 2019). It is notable for the Treaty of Campo Formio.

==History==

Campoformido is a village not far from Udine. It is known for the 1797 Treaty of Campo Formio signed between Napoleonic France and Austria, in which Napoleon ceded Veneto to Austria in exchange for Lombardy. The treaty enacted the dissolution of the Republic of Venice.

The treaty was signed by General Bonaparte and four representatives of the Habsburgs at the house of Bertrando Del Torre, a merchant, located in what is now the Trattato (Treaty) square. The house is open to visitors. To commemorate the event, two monuments, one placed outside the house and one inside, remained covered with lime for a long time after the fall of Napoleon. There is also, in the same square, a copy of the Statue of Peace; the original was brought to Udine and is located in Piazza della Libertà.

<doc id="771746" wikidata="Q7337719" url="?curid=771746" title="River Poulter">
<text>The River Poulter which rises near Scarcliffe in Derbyshire, England is a tributary river of the River Idle in Nottinghamshire. It supplied power to mills along its route, most of which are now gone, although their mill ponds remain. Cuckney mill building is used as a primary school. The river has been dammed to create several lakes in the Dukeries estates of Welbeck Abbey and Clumber House now the National Trust property of Clumber Park. The ornamental Gouldsmeadow Lake, Shrubbery Lake and Great Lake on the Welbeck estate are supplied by a tributary of the Poulter, while Carburton Forge Dam and Carburton Dam were built to power a forge and a mill. Clumber Lake, consisting of an upper and lower lake, which is spanned by a Grade II* listed ornamental bridge, is part of the Clumber estate, and has suffered from subsidence.

Beyond the parklands, the river flows eastwards past Elkesley, to join the River Idle just outside the village close to the A1 road. The river&#x27;s water quality is good, with most indexes showing that it is not far from being unpolluted enabling it to support populations of fish, while the lakes provide significant habitat for large numbers of birds.

==Course==
The Poulter rises at a spring to the south west of Scarcliffe in Derbyshire, close to the contour, and skirts around the southern edge of the village, before flowing in a north-easterly direction towards Nether Langwith. At the western edge of Langwith, it passes under the abandoned track of the railway which served Langwith Colliery, and skirts around a modern fish farm. Owl Sick, a stream which rises at Owl Spring in Scarcliffe Park joins it near the village, and is joined by a stream which rises near Whaley Hall Farm, and flows in a south-easterly direction through Whaley and the Poulter Country Park. The country park was the location of Langwith Colliery&#x27;s waste tip. The colliery closed in 1978 and by 1987 most of the site had been cleared, although a shaft was retained to pump water from the pit into the river to keep the neighbouring Creswell Colliery drained. The waste tips were landscaped in 1988 to form the country park.
The streams flow into the millpond which supplied Scarcliffe Mill, one of four mills known to have existed along this stretch. Records from Newstead Priory indicate there was a mill here in 1432, and it was marked on maps of the late 19th century. By 1938 the last mill was no longer in use and was demolished in the 1960s. The mill pond has become silted as a result of the poor condition of the dam and sluice, but could form a central part of a conservation area based on Apsley Grange, a large building on the opposite side of the road. Below the mill site, a small brick building once held the pumps used to regulate water levels in the river and pump water to Langwith Colliery. Next the river passes through an arch of a two-arched viaduct built in the 1870s by the Midland Railway. Although passenger traffic ceased in 1964 as part of the Beeching cuts, the line remained open for goods trains, and became part of the Robin Hood Line from Worksop to Nottingham in 1998. The other arch crosses the Whaley Thorns road, under which the river flows immediately afterwards.

Passing through Langwith, the river splits into two channels which pass either side of some houses and rejoin at an open space where a stone sign indicates it the site of a sheep dip in 1896. The first of a series of lakes, &quot;The Lake&quot;, covering an area of , lies to the east of Nether Langwith, beyond which the flow is augmented by the treated output from Langwith Sewage Treatment Works.

Langwith Mill House marks the location of a cotton mill built in 1786. It had four storeys and was one of the largest of its type in the region. It closed in 1848 and was used as a corn mill from 1886. The building is in a poor state of repair, and on the Buildings at Risk Register. The mill house is a Grade II Listed building, and housed a restaurant for a time, but is now empty. Soon the river splits, the northern channel dropping down, while the southern artificial channel maintains its level as it supplied the first of two mills at Cuckney. There have been mills here for several centuries, for a cotton mill was destroyed by fire in 1792. A lake called Cuckney Dam, covering , provided the water to power its replacement, which ceased operation on 12 July 1844. After the machinery had been removed, the Duke of Portland turned the building into a National School. The mill is now part of Cuckney Primary School, and its weir and sluices have been retained. The drop in level of some between the mill pond and the river beyond has enabled the school to harness the river to generate electricity. Its 7 kW crossflow turbine generating a significant proportion of the energy used by the school, was funded by a grant from Powergen&#x27;s Green Plan fund and a Clear Skies grant.

Flowing around the northern edge of Cuckney, the river reaches the site of a second corn mill which was situated to the east of the village. The mill has been demolished, but the sluices and weir are still visible.

===Welbeck Lakes===

Beyond the mill site are two channels, the western at the level of the mill pond, and the eastern at a lower level. Both channels head towards the first ornamental lake supplied by the river. At this point, the river has dropped some from its source. Welbeck Great Lake is part of the Welbeck estate, which was owned by the Dukes of Portland, and now owned by the Bentinck family. Millwood Brook flows into Gouldsmeadow Lake and through Shrubbery Lake, before joining the Great Lake. In the 1760s, the duke employed the architect and civil engineer Robert Mylne to construct a three-arched bridge, which had to be both functional and beautiful. Mylne experienced problems with the piers moving, which resulted in the central arch collapsing in February 1768, after which Mylne was sacked. In the 1840s, the fifth duke, who built an underground ballroom and tunnels on the estate, employed the engineer William Tierney Clark to construct a suspension bridge. The resident engineer for the project was Bland William Croker, who had assisted Clark with the construction of the Szechenyi suspension bridge in Budapest. The western channel of the Poulter flows through a culvert into the Great Lake, while the lower eastern channel flows through a culvert into Carburton Forge Dam.

Beyond the lake, a weir with a track over it drops the level to Carburton Forge Dam, built to provide power for a forge. In 1695 of land were leased to John Wheeler of Worcester by the duke, on which he built the forge, a dam pool and floodgates. Deeds held by the Nottinghamshire Archive Service record an agreement between Wheeler and the duke to pay compensation annually as a result of the stream supplying the forge flooding the duke&#x27;s land. The forge flourished until the 1770s. A writer called Pococke described how &quot;the pigs [of iron] were brought from Derbyshire to be melted into bars for use&quot; in 1751. The fifth duke removed all traces of the forge. Beyond Carburton Forge Dam, another weir drops the level to Carburton Dam. A &quot;water corn mill, walke mill or fulling mill&quot; was mentioned in a lease agreement in 1678. The five Welbeck lakes cover an area of .

Again there are two channels below the lake, with the main southern channel at a lower level than the northern one, which is called the Flood Dyke. Both cross under the B6034 Worksop to Ollerton road, and leave the Welbeck estate. The land between the two channels is sandy, and the Flood Dyke was used to irrigate the area, forming water meadows. Restoration of the historic structures was undertaken by the County Council in 2010/11, and interpretation boards have been erected to enable visitors to understand the process. Following an archaeological survey, restoration work was carried out on the main sluice in the Flood Dyke, and on a number of stone sluices, wooden hatches and cast iron valves, the latter dating from the 19th century.

===Clumber Lake===
Both channels pass under the road which serves the hamlet of Carburton, where the upper channel, Flood Dyke, ends in a field from where it enters a sluice and flows through a culvert into an open section. Water enters a second sluice and culvert and rejoins the lower channel. The upper sluice is marked &quot;sluices&quot; on the 1898 map, and fed a large fish pond to the east of the channel. The fish pond was disused by 1919, when it was marked as swampy ground. The lower channel flowed past the &quot;Wheel House (pumping station)&quot; in 1898. It continues under Carburton bridge to supply Clumber Lake, part of the Clumber estate of the Dukes of Newcastle, which has been owned by the National Trust since 1945. The Clumber estate was described in the 18th century as &quot;A black heath full of rabbits, having a narrow river running through it, with a small boggy close or two.&quot; In 1772, the second Duke of Newcastle started construction of Clumber Lake, to complement his new house. A dam was built at the bottom end of the estate, the river bed was excavated to create a wide expanse of water, and an ornamental bridge was erected at the western end. The project took 15 years to complete, and cost £6,612. The bridge, which consists of three unequal arches with balustrading along the top, was designed by Stephen Wright, and is long. It is a Grade II* listed structure.

Improvements to the lake were carried out in 1786 under the direction of Mr Marson the estate manager. The 4th Duke of Newcastle built a cascade below the bridge in 1823, and a new one in 1835, when the work was completed by Mr Grey. The duke described the construction as &quot;ingenious and well managed.&quot; There were problems in 1842, when the culvert feeding water from the lake to an engine which supplied water to the house was found to be clogged with fine tree roots. In spring 1845, 1846 and 1847, the duke drained the lake to make it wider and to improve the banks, which he felt looked &quot;neither natural nor handsome&quot; in places.

Below the ornamental bridge, a weir drops the level by around . In Victorian times, the park had two independent water supply systems, one supplying the house and its associated buildings, and the other supplying the farm and Hardwick village. About 500 people lived on the estate at the time. The house supply came from an artesian well, and was pumped to an underground reservoir, which held , from where it travelled by gravity. The difference in levels of the two parts of the lake was sufficient to power a Gilbert Gilkes and Gordon turbine, which drove the pump. The two systems became one in 1931, when a treble ram vertical pump was installed, driven by the existing turbine. Pumping is now done by electric pumps, but the original machinery is still in place, and was for a number of years used to supply the park with water if there was a power cut.

The lake covering some has been affected by subsidence caused by coal mining, and UK Coal funded remedial work in the 1980s and in 2004. The lowering of the water level during this work revealed the charred remains of the &quot;Lincoln&quot;, a one-third scale naval frigate which the Duke bought in 1871, and which was destroyed by fire in the 1940s. The river leaves the lake by a weir and cascade near Hardwick village, beyond which there is a ford, and another weir beyond that drops the level again, before the river passes under West Bridge on the A614 Worksop to Ollerton road. Most of the rest of the route is through woodland, in the middle of which a ford crosses the river near Crookford farm. The river is crossed by the B6387 Ollerton to Gamston road, and the A1 road near Gamston Airport, before joining the River Idle just downstream of the point where the River Maun and River Meden meet and the Idle begins.

==Hydrology==
The source of the Poulter is in a region where the underlying geology is an extensive water-bearing porous rock structure called the Magnesian Limestone aquifer. Magnesian limestone is named because if contains quantities of the mineral Dolomite, which is rich in Magnesium. Where this rock reaches the surface, springs often occur, and the Poulter starts at such a spring. Further to the east, the Magnesian Limestone is covered by a layer of porous rock called the Triassic Sherwood Sandstone aquifer, which is the major geological component of the area. Continuing eastwards, both are covered by a layer of Mercia mudstone. The groundwater levels in these aquifers affect whether they supply water to the river system, or take water from it, and levels are lower than they have historically been, as a result of the extraction of groundwater, particularly for public water supply, and by fracturing of the aquifers as a result of subsidence caused by deep coal mining.

Above Cuckney, where the Environment Agency have a gauging station which records flows in the river, the catchment for the River Poulter covers some , which has an average annual rainfall of (based on figures from 1961 to 1990). About a third of this finds its way into the river. Water quality is good. The Environment Agency use a six-stage rating scale, from &#x27;A&#x27; to &#x27;F&#x27;, the General Quality Assessment, to classify rivers. &#x27;A&#x27; on the GQA is the best quality of water, while &#x27;F&#x27; is the poorest. Factors which affect the quality are levels of ammonia, levels of dissolved oxygen and the Biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), which measures the amount of dissolved oxygen needed by organisms to break down organic matter in the water. These factors are generally worse when the water is discharged from sewage treatment processes, and tend to be worse in summer, when such discharges make up a greater proportion of the total flow in the river. The upper Poulter, above Welbeck Lake, is rated at &#x27;B&#x27; on the GQA scale, despite the fact that the flows are augmented by the outflow from Langwith Sewage Treatment Works, which contributes around 1.2 Ml/d (megalitres per day) and by water from Langwith fish farm, which can be up to 0.9 Ml/d, but which is seasonal in nature.
Water quality remains good through the length of the river. Figures for the final section before it joins the River Idle show that the levels of ammonia and dissolved oxygen are those which would be expected in a natural ecosystem. Between 1991 and 2006, the BOD has been reduced by more than 50 per cent, but there is still room for improvement. Levels of phosphates and nitrates, which are affected by agricultural activity, are quite high, but some improvements have occurred. Water quality is also measured by two biological indexes. These are NTAXA, which relates to the total number of invertebrate species found in samples of the water, and ASPT, (the Average Score Per Taxon), calculated from the numbers of specific invertebrates which are graded according to their sensitivity to organic pollution. The assessment for the years 2004 to 2006 rated the final section as grade A (very good) on the first index, and grade B (good) on the second. This indicates that the water is not far short from unpolluted.

The Environment Agency has since changed the system for assessing water quality in the river systems in England. Each is given an overall ecological status, which may be one of five levels: high, good, moderate, poor and bad. There are several components that are used to determine this, including biological status, which looks at the quantity and varieties of invertebrates, angiosperms and fish. Chemical status, which compares the concentrations of various chemicals against known safe concentrations, is rated good or fail.

The water quality of the Poulter was as follows in 2019.
The quality of the Millwood Brook has improved, as it was rated bad for ecological status in 2009. Like most rivers in the UK, the chemical status changed from good to fail in 2019, due to the presence of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE) and mercury compounds, neither of which had previously been included in the assessment.

==Flora and fauna==
The river&#x27;s upper reaches are diverse in terms of their physical nature and their ecological importance. They include an area of wet woodland providing a rich habitat for many species. Water quality is sufficient to support various fish species. The river above Welbeck Lake provides habitat for a significant population of wild brown trout. The size of the lakes results in water moving much more slowly and supports populations of cyprinids, pike and eels, which thrive in water which is relatively static. The lower reaches of the river are used for spawning by fish which inhabit the River Idle.

The lakes provide habitat for large numbers of birds. Clumber lake is fringed by alder, sallow and ash trees, with some sedge marsh. It was one of the first sites in the country used by gadwall for breeding, and also has a winter population of goosander. Hobbys frequent the reed bed below Clumber Dam in August and September, where they hunt swallows and martins. The upper lake is fringed by oak, yew, beech and Scots pine trees, and provides habitat for willow tits and woodpeckers, with blackcaps visiting in the summer. Mandarin ducks also visit occasionally.

<doc id="771749" wikidata="Q2901481" url="?curid=771749" title="Almost Like a Whale">
<text>Almost like a Whale by Steve Jones is a modern introduction to Charles Darwin&#x27;s &quot;Origin of Species&quot; and closely follows its structure. It won the 1999 BP Natural World Book Prize.

An American version was published as Darwin&#x27;s Ghost: The Origin of Species Updated ().

The title refers to Darwin&#x27;s observation that a bear, swimming in a lake and catching insects in its mouth, might conceivably evolve over time into a creature &quot;almost like a whale&quot;. This statement attracted much ridicule at the time.

<text>The T20 Blast, officially known as the [[Vitality Health and Life Insurance|Vitality]] Blast for sponsorship reasons, is a professional Twenty20 cricket league in England and Wales. The competition was established by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) in 2003. T20 Blast is the oldest domestic T20 league in the world. It is one of the top-level Twenty20 league in the world. Vitality Blast comprises 18 teams, with 17 in the England and 1 in Wales.
The competition has been known by a variety of names due to commercial sponsorship. It was known as the Twenty20 Cup from 2003 to 2009, the Friends Provident t20 and Friends Life t20 from 2010 to 2013, and the Natwest t20 Blast from 2014 to 2017. The competition has been sponsored by insurance company Vitality since 2018 and is known as the Vitality Blast.

==History==
When the Benson &amp; Hedges Cup ended in 2002, the ECB sought another one-day competition to fill with the younger generation in response to dwindling crowds and reduced sponsorship. The Board wanted to deliver fast-paced, exciting cricket accessible to fans who were put off by the longer versions of the game. Stuart Robertson, the marketing manager of the ECB, proposed a 20-over per innings game to county chairmen in 2001, and they voted 11–7 in favour of adopting the new format.

The first Twenty20 Cup was held in 2003 and was marketed with the slogan &quot;I don&#x27;t like cricket, I love it&quot; – a line from the cricket-themed pop song Dreadlock Holiday by 10cc.

=== Twenty20 Cup ===
The first official Twenty20 Cup matches were played on 13 June 2003. The first season of Twenty20 in England was a success, with the Surrey Lions defeating the Warwickshire Bears by nine wickets in the final to win the first Twenty20 Cup Final. On 15 July 2004 Middlesex versus Surrey (the first Twenty20 Cup game to be held at Lord&#x27;s) attracted a crowd of 26,500, the largest attendance for any county cricket game other than a one-day final since 1953. The tournament saw six different winners in its seven years.

By the end of 2009, the ECB had decided to implement a larger competition for the T20 format of the game. The Twenty20 English Premier League was a proposed cricket league to be run by the ECB consisting of 18 county teams and two overseas teams divided into two divisions with promotion and relegation. The proposal was influenced by the success of the Indian Premier League and by Allen Stanford who had organised the Stanford Super Series in the Caribbean. After the collapse of Stanford&#x27;s series, the proposals were scrapped. Instead of a modified 40 over league, the Clydesdale Bank 40 was implemented.

===Friends Provident/FriendsLife T20===
The Friends Provident T20 (renamed the FriendsLife T20 after just one season) was introduced in 2010. The competition initially divided the eighteen counties into North and South groups, before reverting to the previous model of three divisions of six teams. This period of Twenty20 cricket in England and Wales saw Leicestershire and Hampshire becoming the most successful sides, and in 2013 Northants won their first trophy for two decades.

===NatWest T20 Blast===
NatWest became the tournament sponsors in 2014, renewing the bank&#x27;s longstanding relationship with the county game. The first year of the tournament saw 700,000 spectators attend the games, the most in the competition&#x27;s history. The tournament was won in 2014 by the Birmingham Bears, Warwickshire County Cricket Club&#x27;s name for the purposes of Twenty20 cricket, making it the first time a county trophy had been won by a team using a city name. The final victors of this branding of the tournament in 2017 were Notts Outlaws.

===Vitality Blast===
Vitality became the tournament sponsors in 2018, signing an initial deal to sponsor the competition for four years, with the competition becoming known as the Vitality Blast. The most recent iteration, the 2023 Vitality Blast, was the 20th season of the domestic Twenty20 cricket competition in England and Wales. The tournament started on 20 May 2023 and ended on 15 July 2023, when Somerset were crowned the champions.

There are 18 teams that compete in the tournament, divided into two groups of nine.

Each team plays 14 group games, playing six teams in their group twice (both home and away) and two teams once (one at home, the other away).

The top four teams from each group qualify for the quarter-finals, with the four winners progressing to finals day.

==Competition format==
The 18 first-class counties compete for the title, initially playing in two or three geographical divisions, the number varying across the years. In 2018, matches were moved to be played in a block during July and August with the aim of attracting large crowds during the school summer holidays. In seasons with three divisions the top two teams in each division and the two best third place teams qualify for the playoff stage, in seasons with two divisions the top four teams in each division qualify for the playoff stage, with a set of quarter-finals leaving four teams in the competition. 

The two semi-finals and the final are played on one finals day at Edgbaston in September. In 2020, due to the delay in the start of the season because of the COVID-19 pandemic, matches started on 27 August in a three division format, with the quarter finals played on 1 October and the semi-finals and finals on 4 October (postponed due to rain on the third).

<text>Blaupunkt GmbH () was a German manufacturer, producing mostly car-audio gear and other electronic equipment. Owned by Robert Bosch GmbH from 1933 until 1 March 2009, it was sold to Aurelius AG of Germany. It filed for bankruptcy in late 2015 with liquidation proceedings completed in early 2016. The brand, now managed by GIP Development SARL of Luxembourg, is licensed for use by various product groups worldwide.

== History ==
Founded in 1924 in Berlin as &quot;Ideal,&quot; the company was acquired by Robert Bosch AG in 1933. In 1938 it changed its name to &quot;Blaupunkt&quot;, German for &quot;blue point&quot; or &quot;blue dot&quot;, after the blue dot painted onto its headphones that had passed quality control.

After World War II, Blaupunkt moved its headquarters and production to Hildesheim.

Blaupunkt took over a former Philips/Grundig factory in Portugal to produce automotive head units. It is still owned and operated by Bosch, used exclusively to make OEM units for car manufacturers and 24V (e.g., Coach) AV equipment. Later, factories were set up in Tunisia (speakers) and Malaysia (speakers and electronics).

In 1949, Blaupunkt advertised the first FM-capable car radio. By the 1960 and 1970s, Blaupunkt had become one of the leading German manufacturers of car radios and car audio equipment. In 1983, it began selling an in-dash CD player.

After the 2011 take-over, Blaupunkt became a managed brand name, with all production outsourced to China.

==Products==
Blaupunkt was involved in developing the Autofahrer-Rundfunk-Informationssystem traffic-information system for car radios and provided this feature on their German-market car radios from the late 1970s. The company attempted to have ARI used in the United States but had only a few radio stations per major city involved.

For many years, Blaupunkt car audio equipment models often carried the name of a city somewhere in the world, e.g., &quot;London RDM126&quot;. In Blaupunkt model terminology, this can be translated as &quot;An RDS CD player capable of controlling a Multichanger, rated at 4×30 W RMS (4 × 30 = 120) from the model year 1996&quot;. High-end models typically had German place names.

Blaupunkt also used the brand &quot;Velocity&quot; to sell products aimed at the top, audiophile end of the market. Audi, Volkswagen, Porsche, Mercedes-Benz, Proton, Vauxhall, Pontiac, Holden and BMW all fit Blaupunkt (now simply Bosch) products into their cars, often branded with the car manufacturer&#x27;s mark (e.g., The VW Gamma, Audi Symphony or BMW Business CD lines), with Fiat using them, occasionally unbranded but generally unmodified. Some later Holden Astra models are fitted with Blaupunkt systems (with others being produced by Delphi Automotive). Blaupunkt also specialised in coach installations, selling TVs, multiple-speaker setups, and PA equipment to that industry. That part of the business has remained with Robert Bosch Car Multimedia GmbH, a 100% subsidiary of Robert Bosch GmbH. The Blaupunkt branding is no longer used, even on &#x27;hidden&#x27; stickers.

==Rockford Fosgate alliance==
On 12 July 2012, Blaupunkt signed an agreement with Rockford Fosgate granting the Rockford Corporation exclusive distribution rights for the company&#x27;s car multimedia and headphones range for the North American market. Rockford Fosgate sold Blaupunkt products, including car radios, navigation, amplifiers, loudspeakers, rear seat entertainment, connectivity, and electronics for the OEM market through distributors.

<text>Alexander Charles Yoong Loong (; born 20 July 1976) is a Malaysian racing driver and broadcaster, who competed in Formula One at 18 Grands Prix from to . Yoong remains the only Malaysian driver to compete in Formula One.

Born in Kuala Lumpur to a Malaysian Chinese father and English mother, Yoong began his career in saloon cars before moving into the Proton one-make series. He later raced in single-seater cars where he won the Malaysian Championship in 1995. He moved into Formula Renault in 1996 with help from sponsors but finished outside the top-10. Yoong consulted his father, who believed his son would succeed in lower categories. Yoong decided to drive in Formula Three but dropped out in 1999 after withdrawal from his sponsors. He subsequently went into Formula 3000 and managed to improve despite a horrific crash at Spa-Francorchamps during the season. Yoong also raced in Formula Nippon where he achieved no success.

Yoong became the first and, , only Malaysian to race in Formula One with Minardi at the 2001 Italian Grand Prix and left the sport in 2002. Yoong had a less successful career in CART World Series but had improved in the Porsche Carrera Cup with a less successful foray into V8 Supercars. Yoong raced in A1 Grand Prix series between 2005 and 2008 and scored three victories. In between this, Yoong raced in the Le Mans 24 Hours. Yoong worked for Lotus Racing as head of driver development and is also a commentator for Fox Sports Asia.

==Early life==
Yoong was born on 20 July 1976 at the Sambhi Clinic in Kuala Lumpur. His mother, Johanna Bean, is English, and his father Hanifah Yoong Yin Fah is a Malaysian of Chinese descent through Alex&#x27;s grandfather Yoong Wan Hoi who emigrated in 1933. His grandfather worked as a contractor and steel trader but was forced to retire during the 1997 Asian financial crisis. In an interview in 1999, Yoong states that he sees himself first as a Malaysian, then part Chinese and part English. His father started racing sedans in 1978, and his mother followed suit in 1983 in rallying. Yoong became an avid follower of Formula One by the age of four. He cited Nelson Piquet and Ayrton Senna as his racing heroes. With a Kawasaki 50cc motocross bike he got on his eighth birthday, Yoong first showed his talent at racing.

==Early career==

His early racing career started in saloon cars in 1992 when he was 16. Yoong became the youngest driver in Malaysian motorsport history and moved into a one-make Proton series. He secured his first pole and won in his fourth role and ended up winning two out of five races. In late 1992, Yoong took up saloon racing and took a Toyota Corolla to the Macau Grand Prix and finished third in the 1600cc class in the Guia Race. Yoong later moved up into a 400-horsepower DTM-spec BMW and was the most powerful saloon in the region.

Moving up into the Formula Asia International Championship in 1994 with a RM 50,000 loan, Yoong took several podium finishes before claiming his first win in the season-ending round at Zhuhai in China. This result led to Yoong to go a title challenge in 1995. He had won the Malaysian national crown, but the Continental Championship campaign was far less successful; producing eight wins and finishing second in the championship missing out by two points. Within the same year, Yoong assisted in the filming of Jackie Chan&#x27;s racing film Thunderbolt at Shah Alam which led to Chan describing him as a &quot;very good racing driver&quot;. Yoong was contacted by Paul Stewart to test a Formula Vauxhall car before he gained the opportunity to test a Formula Renault Sport machine at Donington Park and Snetterton for the Startline Racing team.

===Formula Renault===
Yoong began a campaign in Formula Renault with Startline Racing in 1996 along with sponsorship from Malaysian tyre manufacturer, Silverstone tyres. At the first round in Donington, on lap one, Yoong outbraked three cars entering the Melbourne hairpin with his four tyres locking up, and by the 5th lap, Yoong was in 6th but an eventual collision with Rollo McNally but managed to finish 20th. Throughout the rest of the season, Yoong managed to score numerous top six finishes but was unable to win a race. Going into 1997, Yoong remained with Startline and believed he had a chance of competing for race wins. But inexperience shown by a crash at the fourth round at Donington along with an uncompetitive chassis saw Yoong finish outside the top 10 of the championship.

===Formula Three===
Yoong consulted with his father Hanifah, and believed the best chance was to go into lower categories. However, he decided to go into Formula Three to convince himself that he was a skilled driver. He joined Portman Racing Team in their Dallara HKS-Mitsubishi. Joining them at Spa, Yoong finished 16th in a field of thirty cars and came 11th at the next round at Silverstone.

During the off-season, Yoong took up mental and physical training with psychologists at the Bukit Jalil Sports Complex back in Malaysia. The training gave Yoong confidence when arriving back in England in 1998. Remaining with Portman Racing, the team was using Renault engines for their Dallara F397 and F398 chassis. Consistency brought Yoong results in the lower half of the top ten, which included two sixth places at Silverstone. Going into the round at Spa, Yoong switched to Alan Docking Racing. He had to adjust to the Mugen-Honda engine and came up with results very similar to Portman Racing.

1999 proved to be a watershed year. Yoong&#x27;s sponsors dropped out, and his father was forced to fund his son&#x27;s racing activities until the family became indebted. He missed the first two rounds of the year but made a strong comeback when he returned at Thruxton. Driving a Dallara F399 Mugen Honda, Yoong finished sixth, 11 seconds behind winner Jenson Button. He followed this strong finish with 5th at Brands Hatch, in a race that covered the top seven by 3.4 seconds. The second race at Brands Hatch saw Yoong record a second-place behind Narain Karthikeyan, which was followed up with another sixth at Oulton Park before leaving the series for Formula 3000. This result confirmed, Yoong moved up from 268th to 214th in the world rankings. Overall, Yoong finished 11th in the championship.

===Formula 3000===
Yoong joined the Italian F3000 championship from the third round onwards. During his time with Monaco Motorsports, a team run by ex-Formula One driver Lamberto Leoni, he was a team-mate to Marco Apicella. On Yoong&#x27;s debut at Enna Pergusa, he qualified 12th. He finished fifth.

At the next round at Donington, Yoong ended up starting fifth and drove arguably the best race of his career. During the race that caused unpredictable conditions and other competitors spinning out, Yoong ended up second at the midpoint, two seconds behind leader Werner Lupberger. The pair pulled out a 22-second gap over the entire field. With the deployment of the safety car to clear several cars who had retired, Yoong was unable to see the safety car&#x27;s lights in the spray. This mistake costed him eight seconds behind Lupberger, but Yoong set five consecutive fastest laps to catch up. Later in the race, while he was in fifth gear at 220 km/h, he aquaplaned and spun after hitting a puddle. But, Yoong miraculously recovered and once again closed on Lupberger. In the end, he finished second, 1.217s behind Lupberger.

Despite this brilliant result, Yoong was unable to qualify in Austria, Germany, or Hungary. In Belgium, having qualified 16th and up into 11th by the fifth lap, he collided with Justin Wilson&#x27;s Astromega car going into Eau Rouge. Yoong lost control and hurtled left side first into the tyre barrier at 260 km/h with an impact of around 6.5G. He was knocked unconscious for 20 minutes. He was treated by Sid Watkins and the FIA medical team on the scene. They discovered that Yoong&#x27;s helmet was badly damaged but was still intact. After 10 minutes, he was freed and taken to the track medical centre before he was taken by helicopter to the Liège hospital for a complete body and brain scan. Yoong was cleared by doctors of any neurological or spinal injuries but was kept for observation. Yoong managed to attend the race at Misano but needing crutches to walk and declared himself 80% fit and qualified ninth and finished in the same place.

The final round at Imola saw Yoong qualify seventh before being rammed off the track by Krisitan Kolby. Several laps later, his brakes failed at Tosa and pitched him into the gravel. He finished in 10th in the Drivers&#x27; Championship with eight points.

The end-of-the-season Formula Three 1999 race was hosted in Macau. Yoong went from 23rd on his way to ninth in the first heat before a 12th-place finish in the second to finish seventh overall.

In the Korean Formula Three Grand Prix at Changwon, an altercation with a backmarker placed him out in the first race, but the second heat saw a late-race charge from the back to snatch 10th on the final lap but was not classified overall because of this first heat retirement.

===Formula Nippon===
;2000
During the off-season, Yoong tested for both the Nakajima and Le Mans Formula Nippon teams. His first trial at Suzuka took place on 8–9 December 1999 attended by ex-Formula One driver Satoru Nakajima after Yoong set a lap that made him fifth fastest out of 12. Nakajima said of Yoong &quot;Alex is very much better than I originally thought&quot;. Yoong spent time at the Bukit Jalil institute with psychologist Michel Gagne and trainer Jorg Teichmann to recuperate from his injuries at Spa the previous year. His Formula Nippon career started disastrously at Suzuka after crashing his Reynard 99L Mugen at 250 km/h at the daunting 130R in qualifying and forced Yoong to miss the race. At Motegi, a mechanical failure stalled his car at the start at Mine after starting seventh, where he went on to cause a multi-car pile-up in desperation to climb back up the field. Yoong&#x27;s team manager, K. Homma told him he needs to calm down and finish races, and his father Hanifah encouraged him to take off the pressure.

Yoong returned to Malaysia for the annual Merdeka Millennium Endurance sports car race at Sepang and shared a TVR Chimaera to second place with Adam Lokman and Saladin Mazlan. He was able to race to sponsors TVR Malaysia, RentakAsia, and DiGi Telecommunications.

;2001
At Motegi, Yoong lost 6 places at the start after a multi-car accident and was called in for an early pitstop. He made a mistake on lap 14 and retired.

==Formula One==
===Minardi===
Yoong was visited by Minardi Sporting Director Rupert Manwaring during a visit to Malaysia to meet with potential backers for a Formula One seat. Manwaring offered him a seat, possibly as early as the British Grand Prix. By 5 July, Yoong had obtained sponsorship money from the government-backed Magnum Corporation, which was speculated by the Singapore Straits Times to be worth $5 million. The real figure was never publicly disclosed. He attended a two-day test at Mugello, becoming the first Malaysian to test a Formula One car with the FIA granting him his Super Licence.

====2001====
Yoong made his Formula One debut at the Italian Grand Prix, replacing Tarso Marques. Marques brought no money to the team and had been employed under the provision that another driver with more sponsorship money could replace him at any point in the season. Yoong secured backing from the Malaysian government-controlled lottery company Magnum, and made a deal with Minardi for the last three races of the 2001 season. During Friday practice at Monza, electrical problems limited Yoong&#x27;s running and gearbox trouble cut short Saturday free practice. During qualifying, he did not complete a flying lap with more gearbox problems and had to share the spare car with teammate Fernando Alonso. Yoong retired from the race whilst running 15th. At Indianapolis, Yoong retired after 38 laps due to a gearbox failure. At Suzuka, a track he knew well, Yoong finished in 16th, three laps down.

====2002====
For 2002, Alonso left the team, and Australian Mark Webber became Yoong&#x27;s new teammate. During the first race in Australia, he was beset by gearbox problems in free practice and spun twice when caught out by a wet track. Yoong qualified 21st ahead of Takuma Sato. During the race, he was up into ninth by the end of the first lap. Yoong was racing as high as fifth after passing David Coulthard for sixth. He eventually finished seventh after being passed by Mika Salo. This result was Yoong&#x27;s best-placed finish in Formula One. At his home race in Malaysia, he outpaced Eddie Irvine&#x27;s Jaguar during Friday Practice. Yoong qualified 22nd and at the start of the race, he overtook his teammate Webber at the first segment of the race. His refuelling rig malfunctioned at his first pit stop costing him time and lost a place to Irvine. Yoong retired after a collision with Irvine. In Brazil, Yoong finished 13th despite spinning and called it the toughest race he had ever done. At San Marino, he qualified 0.474s outside the 107% rule and failed to qualify. Yoong and Webber did not race in Spain after several rear and front wing failures for both drivers throughout practice and qualifying. In Austria, Yoong set a time over 4.2s slower than the pole-sitter. During the race, he spun in front of Ralf Schumacher before the Williams lapped him. Yoong retired with an engine failure. 
At Monaco, Yoong participated in the Historic Grand Prix of Monaco before the actual event. He drove a Lotus 72 that was driven by Ronnie Peterson. He led until a safety car intervention when Yoong discovered his car was stuck in fifth gear and was forced to drive in this manner until the end of the race. During the actual Grand Prix weekend, Yoong sustained an accident during Thursday practice followed by a similar incident in qualifying when, on his first flying lap, he slid into the Ste Devote barrier. The race saw Yoong retire after running over debris on the approach to Massanet and sidewalled the armco to sustain damage his right rear track rod. In Canada, he finished 14th despite a drink bottle button not being able to function and gained a penalty for speeding in the pit lane. At the Nürburgring, Yoong declared the track &quot;a bit of a go-kart circuit&quot; as he disliked the layout. A second drive-through penalty was gained after he moved as the fifth red light came on at the start. At Silverstone, he failed to make the 107% cut during qualifying whilst a 10th-place finish followed up at Magny-Cours despite a spin. At the German Grand Prix, Yoong failed to qualify, having missed the 107% cut by 0.2s.

Rumors spread that Yoong was to be replaced by either Alonso, who was Renault&#x27;s test driver, or Bryan Herta and Justin Wilson. Minardi eventually settled for Anthony Davidson to compete in the Hungarian and Belgium Grand Prix to allow Yoong for preparation for the final three rounds of the season. During this period, Yoong underwent a program in testing. Minardi later announced that Yoong would not drive for the team in 2003 but did not rule out any further involvement.

Yoong returned for the Italian Grand Prix. Despite an electronic problem at his pitstop, which cost him several minutes, Yoong finished ahead of Sato in 13th. In the United States, his form improved to qualify 20th with a time three seconds slower than Michael Schumacher, but during the race, Yoong suffered an engine failure. At the final race at Suzuka, he passed Webber on the first lap. On lap nine, Yoong spun into the gravel at turn two before retiring on Lap 14.

==After Formula One==
After his Formula One career, Yoong initially struggled to remain visible in international motorsports. Soon after leaving Formula One, Yoong claimed that he was owed $200,000 in salary and that Paul Stoddart was threatening legal action against Yoong&#x27;s sponsors for $1.5 million that was allegedly promised. Yoong later stated the deals were not related to his salary.

===Champ Car===

He went into Champ Car to join Dale Coyne racing to partner Joel Camathias after Roberto González left due to a lack of sponsorship. His debut race at Mexico saw Yoong qualify 17th and finished ninth. Yoong was signed on a contract for the remainder of the season was signed after an impressive test session at the Arizona Motorsports Park gave the opportunity for more sponsorship to come forward. Despite this, Yoong qualified last at Long Beach and became the first retirement. At Brands Hatch, he qualified 13th but spun out. At the Lausitzring, Yoong again qualified in 13th and mechanical problems struck him before half-distance. By the end of May, sponsorship funding was not being received, forcing Yoong to leave Champ Car.

===Porsche Carrera Cup Asia===
Yoong found a drive in the Porsche Carrera Cup Asia after being invited to drive a guest car in a round supporting the Macau Formula Three Grand Prix. Driving a 2002-spec car, he overcame several brushes with the wall to qualify 3rd and swept past Charles Kwan and pole-sitter Matthew Marsh at the start of the race. Despite a gearbox issue, Yoong won the race by 1.186 seconds.

===V8 Supercars===
In the middle of 2003, Yoong was signed by the SAE Racing team to enter the Bathurst 24-hour production car event. He was team-mates with Luke Searle (the son of the owner David Searle), Alan Gurr and Geoff Full in a BMW 320i. A test session at Queensland Raceway in July showed the car was competitive. The drivers qualified 14th, but problems arose. During the qualifying, the BMW&#x27;s engine had been losing power along with a failure of the fuel filter and the fuel injector jets were blocked. During the race, the issues were still present until 75 minutes before the race end, but the team did complete 50 laps. For 2004, Yoong was embarking in a career in the media for ESPN Star Sports as a Formula One presenter. By May of that year, support from Malaysian company Pan Global saw him drive in the V8 endurance events at Sandown and Bathurst.

For this to happen, Yoong signed with Shane Beikoff racing to compete in the final three rounds of the Konica Minolta series. Testing at Queensland Raceway gave Yoong his V8 Supercar debut in a Ford Falcon AU at Eastern Creek. After qualifying in 17th, he got into 13th at the start of the race but a collision with a fellow competitor saw Yoong drop two places. The damage caused the car to sit out for the rest of the weekend, but Yoong bounced back at Queensland Raceway to start ninth. The race was more eventful as he dropped to 25th and lapped after his car was stuck in fourth gear and an incident with Kevin Mundy on lap one meant he was unable to finish higher than 10th. The third race saw an 18th-place finish.

Yoong joined WPS Racing for the endurance races. Pairing up with New Zealand rookie John McIntyre, the entry struggled to 21st place in the 2004 Betta Electrical Sandown 500 having found themselves in the muddy run-off areas on multiple occasions – a fate also suffered by the team&#x27;s second Ford Falcon BA. McIntyre was moved to said other car for the Bathurst 1000, leaving Yoong to partner with Neil McFadyen. In the only start at the Mount Panorama Circuit for the pair of them, they kept out of trouble and finished two laps down in 15th. The Malaysian was retained by Craig Gore&#x27;s team for the single-driver event on the Gold Coast, where he retired from the first race and finished 23rd in the second. Yoong was replaced with Owen Kelly for the remaining rounds of the championship.

===A1 Grand Prix===
;2005–06
He drove for A1 Team Malaysia in the A1 Grand Prix series. The series is widely regarded as rejuvenating Yoong&#x27;s career and reputation. He became the lead driver and put together an outfit of primary Malaysian crew members, an example followed by other National teams. Amongst the non-Malaysians was team principal Jack Cunninghan and chief engineer Greg Wheeler. The first test session at Brands Hatch saw Yoong set the third fastest time behind France and Brazil and the second test had brought in GP2 Driver Fairuz Fauzy. In the inaugural race at Brands Hatch saw Yoong qualify 9th and finished 5th in the feature race after Fauzy drove in the sprint race. At the Lausitzring, Yoong started in 18th and charged up to seventh by the end of the first lap and ended up in sixth. Yoong drove at Eastern Creek to qualify ninth and finished eighth and fifth respectively. At his home race in Malaysia, Yoong repeated his results at Eastern Creek in Australia.

In Dubai, he started eighth and held off Jos Verstappen for 10th place and one point in the sprint race but an early spin in the feature event put a strong result out of the question. In Durban, the team gained Proton as a sponsor, but two consecutive retirements followed. Yoong made up for the retirements with a good qualifying for sixth place and finished fourth in the sprint race after a terrific overtaking pass on Neel Jani. The Indonesia round gave him a sixth place in qualifying and finished fourth in the sprint race after performing an overtake on Neel Jani who was driving with a loose win after a collision with Tomáš Enge. Yoong also gained a second place in the feature race, which saw him sustain three minor collisions and a mistimed, delayed pit stops and many overtaking moves.

At Monterrey, a 10th place on the grid followed by a seventh in the sprint race and 11th in the feature race. At the penultimate round at Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca, Yoong qualified fourth and a sprint race that saw wet conditions led to him spinning off and having to start at the back for the feature race where he climbed to 10th and one point. The final two rounds in China saw a victory in the sprint race whilst Yoong scored a podium in the feature race by finishing second.

;2006–07
The first round in Amsterdam saw Yoong collide with a stalled car before the warm-up lap but set the fastest lap and finished 17th and earlier ended up 12th in the sprint race. The race at Brno, became Yoong&#x27;s best results winning in both the sprint and feature races.
In Australia, Yoong finished seventh and sixth, respectively.
At the Round in Mexico, Yoong started from pole and gave Malaysia their third win of 2006–07 in the sprint race at the Autodromo Hermandos Rodriguez Circuit.

;2007–08
For 2007–08, Yoong was announced to remain with Malaysia and was partnered alongside Aaron Lim. At Zandvoort, Yoong qualified 20th for both races. Yoong suffered from four consecutive retirements from the races in Zhuhai and New Zealand. He did not attend the races at Australia and South Africa, bringing an end to starting 45 successive races. The decision came from the team electing to run Fairuz Fauzy. In Shanghai, Yoong started from 6th in the Sprint race and managed to climb up to 4th where he finished and scored 6th in the sprint race.

===Le Mans Series===
After the 2005–06 A1 Grand Prix season, Yoong raced in the 2006 Le Mans Series as well as the 2006 Le Mans 24 Hrs for Jan Lammers, the A1 Team Netherlands seat holder with team Racing For Holland. Yoong was very competitive, holding the third position in Lammers&#x27; Dome-Judd when the throttle stuck, sending the car into the wall at the first chicane on the Mulsanne Straight and breaking both steering arms. In the race at Istanbul, Yoong set the fastest lap 90 minutes into the race and retired after the starter motor failed during a pit stop. Lammers and Yoong elected not to attend the Spa 1000 km event after the team decided to change the engine from a Mugen to a Judd.

<text>The Pulitzer Prize for Illustrated Reporting and Commentary is one of the fourteen Pulitzer Prizes that is annually awarded for journalism in the United States. It is the successor to the Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Cartooning awarded from 1922 to 2021.

==History==
Since 1922 the prize had been awarded for a distinguished editorial cartoon or portfolio of cartoons published during the year, characterized by originality, editorial effectiveness, quality of drawing, and pictorial effect.

Since 1980, finalists (usually two) have been announced in addition to the winner.

Only two comic strips have been awarded the prize: &quot;Doonesbury&quot; by Garry Trudeau in 1976 and &quot;Bloom County&quot; by Berkeley Breathed in 1987. 

In 2021, with Ruben Bolling, Marty Two Bulls Sr, and Lalo Alcaraz the finalists, no winner was selected, which drew controversy. (The same thing happened in the category in 1923, 1936, 1960, 1965, and 1973, but it had not happened in 48 years, and it was the first time no winner was selected when the finalists&#x27; names had been made public.)

In 2022, the Editorial Cartooning prize was superseded by the revamped category of Illustrated Reporting and Commentary, In response, the Association of American Editorial Cartoonists &quot;issued a statement calling for the Pulitzer board to reinstate Editorial Cartooning as its own category while also recognizing Illustrated Reporting as a separate form.&quot; They wrote:
The 2022 award went to a work of comics journalism.

==List of winners==
==Repeat winners==

Through 2017, eighteen people have won the Editorial Cartooning Pulitzer twice, and five of those have won it three times.

Nelson Harding is the only cartoonist to have won the prize in two consecutive years, 1927 and 1928.

<doc id="771780" wikidata="Q3103853" url="?curid=771780" title="Geraint Evans">
<text>Sir Geraint Llewellyn Evans CBE (16 February 1922 – 19 September 1992) was a Welsh bass-baritone noted for operatic roles including Figaro in &quot;Le nozze di Figaro&quot;, Papageno in &quot;Die Zauberflöte&quot;, and the title role in &quot;Wozzeck&quot;. Evans was especially acclaimed for his performances in the title role of Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Falstaff&quot;. He sang more than 70 different roles in a career that lasted from his first appearance at Covent Garden in 1948 to his farewell there in 1984.

==Early life==
Evans was born in Cilfynydd, the only son of William John Evans (1899–1978), a coal miner, and his wife, Charlotte May, &quot;née&quot; Thomas (1901–1923). His family was Welsh speaking, and Evans spoke Welsh before he learned English.

On leaving school, aged 14, he worked as a window dresser for the High Class Ladies&#x27; Wear store in Pontypridd. He took singing lessons in Cardiff from Idloes Owen, who went on to found the Welsh National Opera, and sang with a local Methodist choir and the local amateur dramatic society. On the outbreak of World War II, he volunteered for the Royal Air Force; he was trained as a radio mechanic, but also took part in services entertainments. 

After the war he worked for the British Forces Radio Network in Hamburg, where he sang with the radio chorus and took lessons from the baritone Theo Herrmann. He then studied with Fernando Carpi in Geneva and at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama in London first, for a short time, with Walther Gruner and then with Walter Hyde.

==Roles==
During a career that lasted from his first appearance at Covent Garden in January 1948 to his farewell at the same house in June 1984, Evans played over 70 roles. He made his operatic début as the nightwatchman in &quot;Die Meistersinger&quot; at the Royal Opera House in 1948 and performed there as Figaro in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot; in 1949, a part which he sang more than 500 times during his international career. It was as Figaro that he made his début at La Scala, Milan in 1960, the first British singer to appear there since the war. 

His Vienna Staatsoper début as a last-minute replacement impressed Herbert von Karajan, who offered him a contract with the company, but Evans declined, believing that his place was at Covent Garden, which he always regarded as his operatic home; despite international success he always called himself &quot;Sir David [Webster]&#x27;s boy.&quot;

At the Glyndebourne Festival Opera in 1957, he first played the part with which he became internationally associated: the title role in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Falstaff,&quot; which he later played in opera houses around the world, including Covent Garden (1961, directed and designed by Franco Zeffirelli), the Vienna Staatsoper and the Metropolitan Opera (1964 in another Zeffirelli production). Other roles in which he was celebrated were Beckmesser in &quot;Die Meistersinger&quot;, Figaro, Don Pizarro in &quot;Fidelio&quot;, the title role in &quot;Don Pasquale&quot;, Dulcamara in &quot;L&#x27;elisir d&#x27;amore&quot; and Leporello in &quot;Don Giovanni.&quot; He was an outstanding actor in both comic and tragic roles such as Wozzeck.

Evans&#x27;s repertoire was in the bass-baritone range such as Don Pizarro, and in Mozart he chose the lower roles - Leporello rather than Don Giovanni, Figaro rather than the Count. Roles higher in the baritone register were not comfortable for him: he never undertook Iago in &quot;Otello&quot; and his one attempt at the title role in &quot;Rigoletto&quot;, at Covent Garden in 1964, ended in disaster when his voice failed on the first night, on which occasion he took the unusual step of apologising to the audience at the final curtain.

Evans appeared in the premières of many modern British operas, including Vaughan Williams&#x27;s &quot;Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot; (1951); Britten&#x27;s &quot;Billy Budd&quot; (1951) and &quot;Gloriana&quot; (1953), Walton&#x27;s &quot;Troilus and Cressida&quot; (1954), and Hoddinott&#x27;s &quot;The Beach of Falesá&quot; (1974) and &quot;Murder the Magician&quot; (1976). In &quot;Billy Budd&quot;, Britten wrote much of the title part with Evans in mind, but the singer, after preparing the role, found that it lay uncomfortably high for him and opted for the lesser role of Mr Flint, the Sailing Master. Later in his career, Evans switched to the bass role of the evil John Claggart, Master at Arms.

==Recordings and television==
Geraint Evans&#x27;s studio recordings include &quot;Falstaff&quot; (conducted by Georg Solti); Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Figaro&quot; (for both Otto Klemperer and Daniel Barenboim); Guglielmo in &quot;Così fan tutte&quot; (Klemperer); Ned Keene in &quot;Peter Grimes&quot; (conducted by the composer); Beckmesser in &quot;Die Meistersinger&quot; (conducted by Herbert von Karajan); Dulcamara in &quot;L&#x27;elisir d&#x27;amore&quot; (conducted by John Pritchard); Wozzeck (conducted by Karl Böhm). 

Evans was among the line-up of top singers assembled by Walter Legge for Klemperer&#x27;s 1961 recording of J. S. Bach&#x27;s St. Matthew Passion. Evans also recorded three Gilbert and Sullivan roles for EMI conducted by Sir Malcolm Sargent: Ko-Ko in &quot;The Mikado&quot; (1957), the Duke of Plaza Toro in &quot;The Gondoliers&quot; (1957) and Jack Point in &quot;The Yeomen of the Guard&quot; (1958). A performance of &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; conducted by Solti with Cesare Siepi as Giovanni and Evans as Leporello, recorded at Covent Garden in 1962, was released on CD in 2006 on the Royal Opera House&#x27;s own label. Lieder did not feature strongly in Evans&#x27;s repertoire, but he recorded songs from Gustav Mahler&#x27;s &quot;Des Knaben Wunderhorn&quot; with the young Janet Baker in 1966.

Between 1968 and 1981 Evans gave a series of televised masterclasses for the BBC in which he took young professional singers through key operatic works, including &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot;, &quot;Falstaff&quot;, &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;, &quot;The Magic Flute&quot;, &quot;La bohème&quot;, &quot;Peter Grimes&quot;, &quot;I Pagliacci&quot; and &quot;Così fan Tutte&quot;.

:His great qualities are a permanent commentary on all that make opera inviting, and finally impossible, to someone trained in the theatre. With his fine eighteenth-century face, looking like many of the actors&#x27; portraits in the Garrick club, dark eyes, bulbous nose and chubby cheeks, on the small side, bristling with invention, ferociously energetic, helpful, greedy, understanding, and unscrupulous, he knows from the outset what he intends to do, usually because he has already done it successfully, and rehearsals are spent getting his own way by running the whole gamut of techniques, from charm to bluster and back again.
The critic Peter Conrad commented on Evans&#x27;s &quot;physiognomic intelligence...His characterisations were built from the shoes up - his Claggart in &quot;Billy Budd&quot; minced; his Wozzeck plodded; his Beckmesser scurried like an officious beetle; his Falstaff had a pigeon-toed waddle.&quot;

Evans was knighted in 1969. Other honours conferred on him included:
Fellow of the Guildhall School of Music (1960); Sir Charles Santley Memorial Award (1963); Hon. Doctor of Music, University of Wales, (1965); Harriet Cohen International Award (1967); Hon. RAM (1969); Hon. Doctor of Music, Leicester University (1969); Fellow, University College, Cardiff (1976); Fellow of the Royal Northern College of Music (1978); Honorary Fellow of Jesus College, Oxford; San Francisco Opera Medal (1980); Fidelio Medal (1980); Fellow of the Royal College of Music (1981); Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts (1984); Freeman, City of London (1984); Society of Cymmrodorion Medal, 1984; Hon. Doctor of Music Oxford University (1985); Order of St John (1986); Fellow, Trinity College, London (1987); Fellow University College, Swansea (1990).

After his retirement from the operatic stage in 1984 (his farewell performances were as Dulcamara), he continued to work as an operatic stage director. He was more in demand abroad than at home in this capacity and directed &quot;Peter Grimes&quot;, &quot;Billy Budd&quot;, &quot;Falstaff&quot;, &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot; and &quot;Don Pasquale&quot; in the U.S. In 1984 Evans published his memoirs, &quot;A Knight at the Opera&quot;, written in collaboration with Noël Goodwin. A paperback edition was published the following year.

Evans&#x27;s final public appearance was in July 1992 (only two months before his death) at the gala to mark the closure of the old opera house at Glyndebourne, along with Janet Baker, Montserrat Caballé, Cynthia Haymon, Felicity Lott, Ruggero Raimondi, Elisabeth Söderström and Frederica von Stade.

Evans died in Bronglais Hospital, Aberystwyth, at the age of 70. A memorial service in Westminster Abbey was attended by more than 1,700 family, friends and admirers. The orchestra and chorus of the Royal Opera House were conducted by Bernard Haitink, Sir Georg Solti, Sir Colin Davis and Sir Edward Downes. Hymns were sung in Welsh, and lessons were read by Donald Sinden and Stuart Burrows. Among the congregation were Dame Joan Sutherland, Peter Brook, and representatives of the Welsh National Opera and the London Welsh rugby club.

<text>Mooré, also called More or Mossi, is a Gur language of the Oti–Volta branch and one of four official languages of Burkina Faso. It is the language of the Mossi people, spoken by approximately 6.46 million people in Burkina Faso, Ghana, Cote d’Ivoire, Benin, Niger, Mali, Togo, and Senegal as a native language, but with many more L2 speakers. Mooré is spoken as a first or second language by over 50% of the Burkinabè population and is the main language in the capital city of Ouagadougou.
It is closely related to Dagbani.

== Phonology ==
The Mooré language consists of the following sounds:

===Consonants===
Remark:
* The semivowel is pronounced (palatal nasal) in front of nasal vowels.

=== Vowels ===
Notes:
* All vowels (other than and ) can also be nasalized.
* All vowels (oral and nasal) can be short or long.
* Other linguists include the vowels and ; here, they are analysed as diphthongs, ( is considered to be ea and is considered to be oa).

== Orthography ==
In Burkina Faso, the Mooré alphabet uses the letters specified in the national Burkinabé alphabet. It can also be written with the newly-devised Goulsse alphabet.

Abciximab, a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor antagonist manufactured by Janssen Biologics BV and distributed by Eli Lilly under the trade name ReoPro, is a platelet aggregation inhibitor mainly used during and after coronary artery procedures like angioplasty to prevent platelets from sticking together and causing thrombus (blood clot) formation within the coronary artery. It is a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor.

While abciximab has a short plasma half-life, due to its strong affinity for its receptor on the platelets, it may occupy some receptors for weeks. In practice, platelet aggregation gradually returns to normal about 96 to 120 hours after discontinuation of the drug. Abciximab is made from the Fab fragments of an immunoglobulin that targets the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor on the platelet membrane.

==Indications for use==
Abciximab is indicated for use in individuals undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (angioplasty with or without stent placement). The use of abciximab in this setting is associated with a decreased incidence of ischemic complications due to the procedure and a decreased need for repeated coronary artery revascularization in the first month following the procedure.

Research also shows that this drug can be of use for patients with diabetes and chronic kidney disease. It is not the appropriate drug of choice if a patient is scheduled for an emergency surgery (i.e., heart surgery) because bleeding time may take about 12 hours to normalize. Pediatric uses include treatment of Kawasaki disease.

==Pharmacokinetics==
Abciximab has a plasma half-life of about ten minutes, with a second phase half-life of about 30 minutes. However, its effects on platelet function can be seen for up to 48 hours after the infusion has been terminated, and low levels of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor blockade are present for up to 15 days after the infusion is terminated. Abciximab does not require dose adjustments for patients with kidney failure.

==Side-effects==
Many of the side effects of abciximab are due to its anti-platelet effects which increase the risk of bleeding. The most common type of bleeding due to abciximab is gastrointestinal hemorrhage.

Thrombocytopenia is a rare but known serious risk characterized by a severe drop in platelets circulating in the blood. Abciximab induced thrombocytopenia is usually rapid occurring hours after administration but may occur up to 16 days later. Transfusing platelets is the only known treatment for abciximab-induced thrombocytopenia, but this therapy may have limited effectiveness because the drug may bind and inhibit the receptors on the newly transfused platelets.

<text>Sons of Ben were followers of Ben Jonson in English poetry and drama in the first half of the seventeenth century. These men followed Ben Jonson&#x27;s philosophy and his style of poetry. Unlike Jonson, they were loyal to the king.

Sons of Ben were the dramatists who were overtly and admittedly influenced by Jonson&#x27;s drama, his most distinctive artistic achievement. Joe Lee Davis listed eleven playwrights in this group: Richard Brome, Thomas Nabbes, Henry Glapthorne, Thomas Killigrew, Sir William Davenant, William Cartwright, Shackerley Marmion, Jasper Mayne, Peter Hausted, Thomas Randolph, and William Cavendish.

The term, or the alternative &quot;Tribe of Ben,&quot; was a self-description by some of the Cavalier poets who admired and were influenced by Jonson&#x27;s poetry, including Robert Herrick, Richard Lovelace, Sir John Suckling, and Thomas Carew. Jonson and his followers congregated at London taverns, especially the Apollo Room in the &quot;Devil Tavern&quot;, near Temple-Bar. Above the mantelpiece in this room Jonson inserted a marble slab engraved with his &quot;Leges Conviviales&quot;, or &#x27;Rules of Conviviality&#x27;. These were Jonson&#x27;s rules for the group. Written in Latin, they were modelled on Horace and Martial. Translations were reprinted throughout the following century.

<doc id="771790" wikidata="Q11232643" url="?curid=771790" title="Jobseeker's Allowance">
<text>Jobseeker&#x27;s Allowance (JSA) is an unemployment benefit paid by the Government of the United Kingdom to people who are unemployed and actively seeking work. It is part of the social security benefits system and is intended to cover living expenses while the claimant is out of work.

JSA is administered by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) in England, Wales, and Scotland, and in Northern Ireland by the Department for Communities. Claimants must be between 18 years of age and the State Pension age.

There is now one form of the benefit, based on National Insurance contributions, referred to by the DWP as &quot;New Style Jobseeker&#x27;s Allowance&quot; or &quot;New Style JSA&quot; for short. The previous form of the benefit, which was based on income and had replaced Income Support for most customers in 1996, is no longer available. Universal Credit was due to replace Jobseeker&#x27;s Allowance and other benefits for 500,000 new claimants from October 2013, and eventually will replace income-based Jobseeker&#x27;s Allowance entirely.

To be eligible for JSA, claimants must state that they are actively seeking work by filling in a &quot;Jobseeker&#x27;s Agreement&quot; form and attending a New Jobseeker interview (NJI). They must also go to a Jobcentre Plus every two weeks to &quot;sign on&quot;, that is, to certify that they are still actively seeking work. Until 2020, claims for Jobseeker&#x27;s Allowance were maintained by the legacy Jobseeker&#x27;s Allowance Payment System (JSAPS).

==Legislation==
===Earlier history===

Unemployment Benefit was first introduced in 1911 under the National Insurance Act 1911 to job seekers who had paid National Insurance contributions (&quot;the stamp&quot;). The maximum amount payable was seven shillings a week (). These payments were thus made only to people who had recently been in work, and not simply to those on low incomes. Furthermore, benefits were only paid for up to twelve months, by which time a claimant had to have regained work.

The Unemployment Insurance Act of March 1921 introduced a &#x27;seeking work&#x27; test which required claimants to be actively seeking work and willing to accept employment paying a fair wage. In February 1922 a means test was introduced which excluded some, such as single adults who lived with relatives, from receiving benefit payments.

As a direct consequence of the return from war of injured servicemen, the Disabled Persons (Employment) Act 1944 was brought into force to enable these to secure employment.

After the Second World War, National Assistance was introduced by the National Assistance Act 1948 (11 &amp; 12 Geo. 6. c. 29), allowing anyone of working age on a low income to apply for support.

National Assistance was replaced by Supplementary Benefit in November 1966, and Unemployment Benefit claimants could transfer to this after their initial entitlement had expired. Supplementary Benefit was later replaced by Income Support in April 1988.

===Legislation===

In 1995, legislation was passed through the House of Commons entitled the Jobseekers Act 1995. The &quot;Jobseeker&#x27;s Allowance Regulations 1996&quot; were produced within a period of six months from the act coming into force, with the change of Income Support provision to Jobseekers Allowance occurring on 7 October 1996. Previously, on 11 September 1996, the &quot;Social Security (Credits and Contributions) (Jobseeker&#x27;s Allowance Consequential and Miscellaneous Amendments) Regulations 1996&quot; were created, brought before parliament five days later and subsequently made policy coming into force also on 7 October.

The change was introduced to &quot;streamline&quot; the systematic administration of benefits by improving claimant compliance and to partially remove the distinction between means-tested claimants and those claiming against contribution records.

===Subsequent legislation===

in April 2011 Iain Duncan Smith introduced a period of mandatory work activity amounting to a maximum of four weeks of thirty hours each week in employment. It was expected this activity would be required of approximately 10,000 individuals. The main claimants who it was expected would be subject to mandatory work activity were those who had been &#x27;signing on&#x27; for at least thirteen weeks. Despite this any recipient of Jobseeker-benefit could be required to take part in work activity regardless of how long that person had been &#x27;signing on&#x27;.

At some time the Social Security Advisory Committee felt a need for an initiative so the Employment Skills and Regulations Scheme was considered. The governmental bodies had a look at the ideas and felt they were not altogether correct. So the government only accepted the need for two-thirds of the total of changes suggested. In 2011 the Jobseeker&#x27;s Allowance (Employment, Skills and Enterprise) Regulations were brought into force. One part of the scheme required the long-term unemployed to participate in unpaid work activity for a maximum of six-months.

==Statistics==
According to &quot;The Economist&quot;, in 2015 roughly 2% of welfare expenditure in the UK was spent on unemployment benefits; the bulk was spent in other areas.

The average number of claimants between the years 2003 and 2008 was 814,000 and average number of new claims was approximately 2,463,000. Nearly 40% of income-based claimants during 2003 were also claiming Housing Benefit. The DWP for England and Wales showed one third of the total number of claimants for JSA were persons having been convicted of a crime resulting in their act(s) having been recorded by the police authorities. In &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper in March 2001, the success of the New Deal scheme was reported; the report stated that 270,000 people were found full-time employment and the cost of achieving this end was half of the estimated amount. According to a report in 2008 by the Social Market Foundation there were approximately 100,000 long-term unemployed persons claiming JSA, at any given time. From 2010 to April 2011 the number of claimants having sanctions imposed increased to 75,000 persons amid claims that DWP staff deliberately made claiming more difficult and were required to refer 3 people a week for sanctions. The number of disabled people sanctioned doubled to 20,000 over the same period. The Department for Work and Pensions denied persecuting vulnerable people.

==Application methods==
According to the UK government webpage on how to apply, application can be made online or by phone. Application can also be made on paper forms; JSA1, or JSA4RR if reclaiming JSA.

==Claimant Commitment==
When claimants attended their first &#x27;Jobseeker Interview&#x27;, they were required to sign a contract with their advisor, called a claimant commitment. The contract can be changed at one-to-one interviews. Its terms include that claimants state:
* what activities they will perform to look for work
* The maximum commuting time they will accept
* The type of work they are ideally looking for (although claimants should be prepared to accept anything within their capabilities)
* How many times they will search suitable job search websites each week
* Whether they will use any magazines/newspapers to find jobs
* The maximum hours they are able to work, taking into consideration barriers such as health, child care etc.

Whether claimants are paid therefore depends on whether they uphold the contract they have agreed to – from a political theory known as Welfare Contractualism, first expressed in the 1998 paper &quot;New Ambitions for our Country: A New Contract for Welfare&quot;.

==Eligibility==
Applicants qualified by conforming to all of the following requirements:
# being 18 or over but below State Pension age. There were some exceptions for 16 and 17 year olds.
# Not being in full-time education.
# Living in England, Scotland or Wales.
# Being available for work.
# Actively seeking work.
# Working on average less than 16 hours per week.
# Attending a JSA interview after application.

===Contribution-based===
New-style (contribution-based) Jobseeker&#x27;s Allowance (&quot;JSA(C)&quot;) entitlement is based on Class 1 National Insurance contributions in the two complete tax years preceding the benefit year of claim. This allowance is paid regardless of assets; however, any personal or occupational pension over £50 a week would result in deductions. There were also other caveats (related to job-seeking activity) which excluded payment.

Many older citizens seeking work could not receive payments, despite qualifying through NI contributions, because they had pension income. Self-employed people do not pay Class 1 contributions, and may not have been able to claim JSA(C) until their case had been decided. However, they were both still eligible for NI credits (see below).

JSA(C) may be claimed for only 26 weeks in any benefit year. In order to make a claim, a customer must have actually paid NI contributions for the same number of weeks in one of the last two tax years (the remaining 18 months could be either paid, or credited contributions). When entitlement to JSA(C) is exhausted, Universal Credit may then have become payable if eligible (see below).

Certain other benefits including Statutory Sick Pay, Statutory Paternity Pay, Statutory Maternity Pay, statutory adoption pay, Employment and Support Allowance, bereavement benefit, Carer&#x27;s Allowance and JSA(C) itself also counted towards Class 1 contributions and were called &quot;Credited Class 1 contributions&quot;. 

If there was no entitlement to Universal Credit, a person could re-qualify for JSA(C) in a subsequent benefit year based on contributions paid in the relevant contribution years, providing that there had been a break of at least twelve weeks. They had to wait until the beginning of a new benefit year before they could claim again.

===Income-based===
People who were eligible for JSA(C) could also claim JSA(IB) for any additional payments due under that benefit (for family dependents, for example). JSA(IB) was payable only if the claimant had less than £16,000 in capital (correct as of May 2022). Payments are reduced if the claimant has savings between £6,000 and £16,000.

Both forms of benefit faced 100% marginal deductions if the individual earned more than a small amount – the &#x27;disregard&#x27; – which was £5 per week for single people, £10 per week for couples and £20 per week for certain other groups such as some lone parents and disabled people. The &#x27;disregard&#x27; remained at the same nominal amount since the 1980s and was never uprated with inflation, unlike benefits themselves. The benefit was withdrawn from those working 16 or more hours a week (though this did not apply to voluntary work). Part-time students could claim provided they did not have more than 16 hours a week in teacher contact time and the course was not officially designated as full-time by the college (irrespective of the number of hours of contact time).

==Work programmes==

===New Deal===

Starting in 2001, the New Deal introduced a second stage to the claim period. Initially, there was the jobseeker&#x27;s agreement and allowance. If a claimant who was below the female state pension was unemployed for over twelve months, they were placed on the New Deal scheme. They may also have entered the New Deal process early if they fell in special categories. From 2009, a Flexible New Deal scheme started using the private sector to provide tailored employment and skills support, with return-to-work performance incentives for the providers.

In Northern Ireland the New Deal was replaced in 2008 by a similar scheme known as Steps to Work. This scheme was administered by the Department for Employment and Learning which operates Jobs &amp; Benefits Offices jointly with the Social Security Agency.

During October 2009 the New Deal programmes were replaced by the Flexible New Deal programmes, which were available to claimants still unemployed after a period of twelve months.

===The Work Programme===

Various work programmes, under the collective label of &quot;New Deal&quot; (including Flexible New Deal, New Deal for Young People, New Deal 25+, New Deal for Disabled people, New Deal for Lone parents, Pathways to Work, Progress2Work and Employment Zones), were replaced by &quot;The Work Programme&quot; during June 2011. On 6 March 2012 the UK Government announced benefits changes for prisoners at the end of their sentence and those claiming JSA. They would be sent on the work programme, as would JSA claimants who had been claiming for the previous 26 weeks. On the work programme they were required to sign a form to agree to 30 hours a week of unpaid work or face sanctions of 6 months. Unlike New Deal there was no choice of training or help setting up a business, nor could the job seeker choose what type of unpaid work they did. In nearly all cases the unpaid placement involved shop work. From 2012, work placement advisors would receive £5,600 should they find work for a person leaving prison who keeps the job for two years. According to the Government, from June 2011 only 1 in 5 participants in the Work Programme remained off benefits for over six months.

==Pensioners==
Until 2020, men who reached the women&#x27;s State Pension age had two options. They could still claim Jobseeker&#x27;s Allowance, but had to remain actively seeking work. They would continue to receive the contribution-based rate of JSA if they were claiming it.

Alternatively, a man on a low income could apply for Pension Credit on reaching the women&#x27;s state pension age. This replaced Jobseeker&#x27;s Allowance payments and he would no longer need to &quot;sign on&quot; at the JobCentre. In both cases, the amount of benefit paid was the same (an additional &quot;Pensioner Premium&quot; was added to Income-based JSA). 

National Insurance credits were paid by the Government on his behalf, even if he claimed another benefit; this came to an end in 2016, with the new State Pension.

Women could only claim until they reached the State Pension age; this increased gradually between 2010 and 2020. The State Pension age is now 66 for both men and women, as of 2020.

All customers must move from JSA to either State Pension, or Pension Credit (if eligible) at the State Pension age. A special part-week payment of State Pension is paid for the benefit week including the customer&#x27;s birthday, making the claim continuous.

==Sanctioning==
A claimant&#x27;s Jobseeker&#x27;s Allowance may be stopped as a punishment. A person choosing to remain out of employment should a vacancy be available is obliged to give a &quot;good reason&quot; for the choice or their monies are to be withheld. The Work and Pensions Committee of the House of Commons discovered single parents, care leavers and claimants with health problems and disabilities were &quot;disproportionately vulnerable&quot; to, and impacted by, sanctions. There was an excessive human cost. Children could become &quot;collateral damage&quot; since parents losing benefits affects them. Examples of &quot;extreme hardship and distress&quot; included a wheelchair user who &quot;sofa-surfed&quot; or slept in a college library for a year when her whole benefit was wrongly withdrawn. A man was sanctioned because he missed a job centre appointment three days after he went to hospital with severe epileptic seizures. The committee found the impact of sanctions had not been properly evaluated and was &quot;pointlessly cruel&quot;.

Other reasons to be denied money are:
* Not being available for or actively seeking work or not signing the Jobseeker&#x27;s Agreement: if a claimant does not declare on the Jobseeker&#x27;s Agreement that they are available for and actively seeking work and sign the Agreement, the benefit will be suspended until the claimant completes and signs the agreement. Once the agreement has been signed, a decision maker will decide how much of the claim should be backdated, if any.
* Failing to attend a Jobcentre appointment: the claimant may be docked 4 or 13 weeks&#x27; income.
* Voluntarily leaving work or refusing a notified vacancy: The claimant may be sanctioned for up to 13 weeks&#x27; or 26 weeks&#x27; income in the case of repeated transgressions.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC6/11/13&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
* Refusing to attend compulsory scheme or failing to comply with a direction: A punishment of 4 weeks&#x27; loss of income for the first instance and 13 weeks&#x27; for second and subsequent instances.
* Not accepting or keeping to the Claimant Commitment
* Not going to a Jobcentre Plus when asked.
* Turning down a job or training course.
* Not applying for any jobs the claimant is told about.
* Not taking part in any interviews the claimant is invited to.
* Not going to any training booked for the claimant or not taking part in employment schemes.
* Leaving the last job or training without good reason or because of the claimant&#x27;s behaviour.

===Criticism of sanctions===
Sanctions have been found to be ineffective in getting claimants into work but do great harm to the claimants, especially to disabled claimants who are disproportionately targeted with sanctions.

The charity Oxfam oppose what they consider unfair sanctions:
&quot;The Guardian&quot; has listed ten cases of stopped benefits which it regards as either for &quot;trivial reasons&quot; or due to DWP &quot;administrative errors&quot;. The former included three people who were in hospital due to their own sickness or attending a sick partner and a person who went for a job interview instead of attending the job centre. The latter included letters sent by the DWP to the wrong address and people who arrived on time at the job centre but found an unusually long queue. &quot;The Independent&quot; cited a man who had a heart attack during a work capability assessment and was sanctioned for not completing it. Two cases show reasonably foreseeable consequences for sanctioned diabetic claimants: one resorted to begging for food, whilst another who was apparently unable to afford to keep his insulin properly refrigerated was found dead, leading to a parliamentary select committee investigation of sanctions. In the last quarter of 2013 there were 227,629 claimants sanctioned, a rise of 69,600 compared to the equivalent time in 2012. Over a million British claimants were sanctioned between October 2012 and December 2013. 633,000 got their benefits back after referral and 580,273 referrals were cancelled. Even when benefits are restored on appeal the stress sanctions cause can worsen mental health.

Paul Jenkins, chief executive of the Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust, who previously worked for Rethink Mental Illness, criticised the reintroduction of sanctions, which were suspended in March 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom. He said benefit sanctions policy was &quot;really cruel and ineffective&quot;.

====Alleged pressure on job centre staff====
According to Patrick Wintour in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, job centre staff were threatened they would be disciplined and given targets because it was felt too few claimants were sanctioned. Statistics are kept about the proportion of claimants sanctioned at each job centre and those with relatively low proportions of claimants sanctioned can face questions. There was reportedly a &#x27;climate of fear&#x27; at job centres with staff under pressure to sanction innocent people to meet targets. Sanctions also harm the children of sanctioned claimants. Sanctioned claimants and their families sometimes need food banks to get something to eat. The government was urged to review the effects of sanctions in particular on claimants with psychiatric problems and disabilities. People with learning difficulties frequently have trouble understanding what is required of them. James Bolton of Mencap said:

<text>Unica is a vulcanised lump paper material. It was (and to some extent still is) used to make boxes. The most famous product is probably a lunch box. But unica has also been used to make suitcases, helmets, buttons, shoes and, during the Second World War it was even used to make fuel tanks for Swedish aeroplanes. Many unica products were made by AB Tidan in Mariestad. Nowadays unica boxes are made by Alstermo Bruk in Småland, Sweden.

<text>Odin (known before as Win32-OS/2) is a project to run Microsoft Windows programs on OS/2 or convert them to OS/2 native format. It also provides the Odin32 API to compile Win32 (Windows API) programs for OS/2. The project&#x27;s goals are:
* Every Windows program should load and operate properly.
* Create a complete OS/2 implementation of the Win32 API.

Although this is far from complete, much of the Win32 API is not widely used, so partial implementation will give usable results. Odin32 is already used commercially for the OS/2 port of the Opera web browser. Odin is included in the ArcaOS operating system.

== Technical overview==
Odin achieves binary compatibility by converting Win32 executables and dynamic-link libraries to OS/2 format. Conversion can be done on the fly (each time the application is run) or permanently. Odin does not use emulation or a compatibility layer.

Odin identifies itself to Windows applications as Windows 2000 Service Pack 2.

Odin uses code from Wine, which runs Win32 applications on Unix-like operating systems.

== Name ==
The project is named after Odin, the god of wisdom and supreme god of Germanic and Norse mythology.

<text>In the game of rugby union, there are 15 players on each team, comprising eight forwards (wearing jerseys numbered 1–8) and seven backs (numbered 9–15). In addition, there may be up to eight replacement players &quot;on the bench&quot;, numbered 16–23. Players are not restricted to a single position, although they generally specialise in just one or two that suit their skills and body types. Players that play multiple positions are called &quot;utility players&quot;.

The scrum (a contest used to restart play) must consist of eight players from each team: the &quot;front row&quot; (two props – a loosehead and tighthead – and a hooker), the &quot;second row&quot; (two locks), and a &quot;back row&quot; (two flankers and a number 8). The players outside the scrum are called &quot;the backs&quot;: scrum-half, fly-half, inside centre, outside centre, two wings, and a fullback.

Forwards compete for the ball in scrums and line-outs and are generally bigger and stronger than the backs. Props push in the scrums, while the hooker tries to secure the ball for their team by &quot;hooking&quot; it back with their foot. The hooker is also usually responsible for throwing the ball in at line-outs, where it is mostly competed for by the locks, who are generally the tallest players on the team. The flankers and number eight are expected to be the first players to arrive at a breakdown and play an important role in securing possession of the ball for their team.

The backs play behind the forwards and are usually more lightly built and faster. Successful backs are skilful at passing and kicking. Full-backs need to be good defenders and kickers, and have the ability to catch a kicked ball. The wingers are usually among the fastest players in a team, and score many of the tries. The centres&#x27; key attacking roles are to break through the defensive line and link successfully with wingers. The fly-half can be a good kicker and generally directs the back line. The scrum-half retrieves the ball from the forwards and needs a quick and accurate pass to get the ball to the backs (often first to the fly-half).

Early names, such as &quot;three-quarters&quot; (for the wings and centres) and &quot;outside-half&quot; or simply &quot;out-half&quot; (for fly-half) are sometimes used in the Northern Hemisphere, while in New Zealand the fly-half and inside centre are called &quot;first five-eighth&quot; and &quot;second five-eighth&quot; respectively, while the scrum-half is known as the &quot;half-back&quot;.

==Overview==
There is a maximum of 15 players from each team allowed on a rugby field at any one time. The players&#x27; positions at the start of the game are indicated by the numbers on the backs of their shirts, 1 to 15. The positions are divided into two main categories; forwards (numbered 1 to 8) and backs (numbered 9 to 15). In international matches, there are eight substitutes that can replace an on-field team-mate. The substitutes, numbered 16 to 23, can either take up the position of the player they replace or the on-field players can be shuffled to make room for this player in another position. Typically, the forwards among the substitutes will have lower numbers than the backs. There are no personal squad numbers and a versatile player&#x27;s position and number may change from one game to the next. Players can also change positions during the match; common examples are the fly-half playing the full-back&#x27;s position in defence or a prop taking the hooker&#x27;s position at line-outs.

Different positions on the field suit certain skill sets and body types, generally leading to players specialising in a limited number of positions. Each position has certain roles to play on the field, although most have been established through convention rather than law. During general play, as long as they are not offside, the players may be positioned anywhere on the field. It is during the set pieces (scrum and line-out) that the positions are enforced.

==History==

During early rugby union games there were only really two positions; most players were in the forwards, who formed part of the scrimmage (which later was called &quot;scrummage&quot; and then &quot;scrum&quot;), and a few defensive &quot;tends&quot; (from &quot;goaltenders&quot;).

Eventually, the attacking possibilities of playing close behind the scrimmage were recognised. The players who stationed themselves between the forwards and tends became known as &quot;half-tends&quot;. Later, it was observed that the players outside scrimmage were not limited to a defensive role, so the tends and half-tends were renamed &quot;backs&quot; and &quot;half-backs&quot;. As the game became more sophisticated, the backs positioned at different depths behind the forwards. They were further differentiated into half-backs, three-quarter-backs, and full-back. Specialised roles for the scrum also evolved with &quot;wing-forward&quot; (modern day flankers) being employed to protect the half-back.

The first international between England and Scotland was played in 1871 and consisted of 20 players on each side: thirteen forwards, three half-backs, one three-quarter and three full-backs. The player numbers were reduced to fifteen in 1877. Numbers were added to the backs of players&#x27; jerseys in the 1920s, initially as a way for coaches and selectors to rate individual players.

==Names of positions==
The various positions have changed names over time, and many are known by different names in different countries. Players in the flanker positions were originally known as &quot;wing forwards&quot;, while in the backs, &quot;centre three-quarter&quot; and &quot;wing three-quarter&quot; were used to describe the outside centre and wing respectively (although the terms are still sometimes used in the Northern Hemisphere) The names used by World Rugby tend to reflect Northern Hemisphere usage although fly-half is still often known as &quot;outside-half&quot; or &quot;stand-off&quot; in Britain, and &quot;outhalf&quot; in Ireland. In New Zealand, the scrum-half is still referred to as the &quot;half-back&quot;, the fly-half is referred to as the &quot;first five-eighth&quot;, the inside centre is called the &quot;second five-eighth&quot; and the outside centre is simply known as &quot;centre&quot;. In America and Canada the number 8 is known as &quot;8-man&quot;.

Collective terms are also used to describe similar positions; the props and hooker combine to form the &quot;front row&quot;, the locks the &quot;second row&quot; and the flankers and number 8 the &quot;back row&quot;, &quot;loose forwards&quot; or the &quot;loosies&quot;. The front row and second row combined are collectively termed the &quot;tight five&quot;. In the backs, &quot;half-backs&quot; can be used to describe the scrum-half and fly-half; &quot;inside backs&quot; to describe the scrum-half, fly-half and inside centre; &quot;midfield&quot; for the fly-half and both centres (in New Zealand it refers only to the second five-eighth and centre); and &quot;outside backs&quot; for the outside centre, wings and full-back. The two props are distinguished by being either a &quot;tighthead&quot; (their head is positioned between the opposition prop and hooker) or &quot;loosehead&quot; (their head is positioned on the outside of the scrum). The &quot;blindside flanker&quot; binds to the scrum on the side closest to the side line, while the &quot;openside flanker&quot; binds on the side with the most space between the scrum and the sideline.

==Backs==
=== Full-back===
Full-backs (number 15) usually position themselves several metres behind the back line. They field any deep opposition kicks and are often the last line of defence should an opponent break through the back line. On attack, they can enter the back line, usually near the centres or wings, with the aim of providing an extra person and overlapping the defending players. Three of the most important attributes of a good full-back are good catching ability under a high kick, the ability to punt the ball a long distance with accuracy, and the speed and skill to join in back line attacking moves, especially counter-attacks. The full-back is the player most likely to field the high ball or &quot;up and unders&quot; kicked by the opposition. Good hands are needed to ensure the ball is caught cleanly to deny the opposition the chance to regain possession. As the full-back will inevitably catch the ball deep in their own territory with little support from their own players, they should either kick the ball downfield or run forward to link up with their backs to start a counter-attack. If the full-back kicks the ball out, the opposition have the line-out, whereas if they start a counter-attack they have a number of options.

To provide effective cover behind the defensive line, good full-backs are careful not to get caught out of position and must anticipate the opposition&#x27;s play. Their position behind the backline allows them to see any holes in the defensive line and they either communicate with the backs to close the gaps up or cover the gaps themselves. The full-back has the most potential for attacking the opposition, especially from a misdirected kick. If a kick is fielded and there is enough space and support, the full-back may decide to counter-attack by running the ball back towards the opposition. Due to their kicking skills, in some teams the full-back is also responsible for taking the goal kicks.

For much of the history of the sport, the full-back position was almost totally defensive. Originally, the ball could be kicked directly into touch from any spot on the field, with a line-out then following at the spot where the ball went into touch. This effectively placed a premium on full-backs&#x27; skills in kicking from hand. The first test tries by full-backs in international matches came relatively early, in 1878 and 1880, but it was not until 1934 that a full-back scored a try in the competition now known as the Six Nations Championship. Only three tries had been scored by full-backs in the Championship prior to 1969. According to rugby historian John Griffiths, the worldwide adoption of the current law restricting direct kicking into touch in September 1968 (a law previously used in Australia) &quot;revolutionised full-back play&quot;. JPR Williams of Wales was the first full-back to regularly score tries after the law change, scoring six times in Five Nations matches in the 1970s.

Notable full-backs include Serge Blanco, who scored 38 tries in 93 tests for France and was known for his counter-attacking ability. In 1997, he was among the inaugural set of rugby players inducted into the International Rugby Hall of Fame and in 2011 he was also inducted into the IRB Hall of Fame. Four full-backs who played for the British and Irish Lions are in the International Rugby Hall of Fame; Gavin Hastings (also inducted into the IRB Hall in 2013) and Andy Irvine from Scotland, Tom Kiernan from Ireland and the aforementioned Williams. Hastings and Irvine were accurate goal-kickers and Kiernan is credited with being the first attacking full-back in Irish rugby. Williams was chosen as the greatest Lions full-back at the inaugural Lions Legends Dinner at Lord&#x27;s in 2008 and is praised for his safety under the high ball, tackling and calm decision making. The other full-backs in the International Rugby Hall of Fame are Don Clarke and George Nēpia from New Zealand. Clarke, nicknamed &quot;the boot&quot;, was an accurate goal kicker and Nēpia was noted for his tackling and kicking ability.

=== Three-quarters===
==== Wing====

The wings are generally positioned on the outside of the backline with the number 11 on the left and the number 14 on the right. Their primary function is to finish off moves and score tries. Wingers are usually the fastest players in the team and tend to be either elusive runners or, more recently, big, strong and able to break tackles. The skills needed for the left wing and right wing are similar, although left-footed players are usually played on the left wing as they can step and kick better off their left foot. The winger on the blindside often &quot;comes off the wing&quot; to provide an extra man in the midfield, in the same way as would a full-back. One or both wingers will usually drop back on opposition kicks to give the full-back extra options for counter-attacking.

There have been a number of notable wings throughout history. David Campese, a member of both the International and IRB Halls of Fame, played 101 times for Australia and held the world record for most tries in test matches. He was famous for his goose step and reverse pass. Welsh international Gerald Davies was influential in helping the British Lions of 1971 become the only Lions touring party to win a test series in New Zealand. Ieuan Evans played 72 games for Wales and scored 33 tries – at that time a record for Wales. In 1994, International Rugby Hall of Famer John Kirwan retired as the (then) most capped player and highest try scorer in All Black history. One of the most notable wingers is Jason Robinson, who played 51 games for England. He also scored 248 points in 159 matches (about 6.5 points per match) for the Sale Sharks from 2000-2007.

Tony O&#x27;Reilly played wing for Ireland between 1955 and 1970 and scored a record 38 tries on two Lions tours. André Boniface is a French international that is a member of both the International Rugby Hall of Fame and the IRB Hall of Fame. Also in the IRB Hall of Fame is Bill Maclagan, a 19th-century player for Scotland and the Lions, who played at three-quarters, which eventually evolved into the modern position of wing. Another 2011 inductee in the IRB Hall is Brian Lima of Samoa, who played most of his career on the wing but ended it as a centre. He participated in five World Cups for Manu Samoa and became known as &quot;The Chiropractor&quot; for his ferocious tackling.

In 2012 Demi Sakata, a Japan star, who was considered one of the world&#x27;s top players of the 1960s, became his country&#x27;s first inductee into the IRB Hall.

Jonah Lomu entered the International Hall in 2007 and the IRB Hall of Fame in 2011, debuted as the youngest ever All Black.

==== Centre====
There are two centres in a rugby team, inside centre (number 12) and outside centre (number 13). The inside centre usually stands close to the fly-half or at first receiver on the other side of the scrum or breakdown. Like the fly-half, they generally possess a good kicking game and are good at reading the play and directing the attack. The outside centre is positioned outside the inside centre and is generally the faster of the two. The centres&#x27; main role is to provide space for the players outside them. They need to run good lines (run into spaces or at 90 degrees to their opposition), be able to side step and swerve, and have good passing skills. When the ball is moved along the opposition backline, the centres are the first players to make the tackle. They need to be aggressive tacklers to knock their opponent down and seize the ball and be good at organising the defensive lines. Outside centres generally have more room to move than inside centres. Centres also provide support at the breakdowns and can run as decoys to confuse the defence.

Brian O&#x27;Driscoll is the fourth-most-capped player in rugby union history, having played 141 test matches, 133 for Ireland (83 as captain), and 8 for the British and Irish Lions. He is the 8th-highest try scorer in international rugby union history, and the highest-scoring centre of all time. Danie Gerber played centre for South Africa during the apartheid era and even though he was only able to play 24 tests over 12 years, he scored 19 tries. Mike Gibson played for Ireland and the Lions; his record of 69 caps for Ireland lasted for 26 years. Tim Horan won two World Cups for Australia, being named the Player of the Tournament in 1999. As a player, Ian McGeechan won 32 caps for Scotland and went on two Lions tours, while as a coach he led the Lions a record four times. Welsh centre Gwyn Nicholls played from 1896 to 1906 and was known as the &quot;Prince of Threequarters&quot;. Other centres in the International Rugby Hall of Fame are Jo Maso and Philippe Sella from France, known for their flamboyant attacking play. Gibson and Sella are also in the IRB Hall of Fame. Seven centres are in the IRB Hall but not the International Hall—Frank Hancock, a 19th-century Welsh player whose skills led to the creation of the modern two-centre formation; Guy Boniface, French international and younger brother of André; brothers Donald and Ian Campbell of Chile; Zimbabwe international Richard Tsimba; and Bleddyn Williams and Jack Matthews, who formed a legendary centre partnership for Cardiff and Wales in the era immediately following the Second World War.

===Half-backs===
==== Fly-half====
A fly-half (number 10) is usually the first player to receive the ball from the scrum-half following a breakdown, line-out or scrum. Therefore, they must be decisive with what actions to take. They must possess leadership and communicate effectively with the back line. Good fly-halves are calm, clear thinking and have the vision to direct effective attacking plays. Fly-halves need good passing and kicking skills. Often the fly-half is the best kicker in the team and needs to be able to execute attacking kicks such as up-and-unders, grubbers and chip kicks as well as being able to kick for territory. Many fly-halves are also the team&#x27;s goal kickers.

Fly-halves in the International Rugby Hall of Fame include Cliff Morgan, as well as fellow Welshman Phil Bennett, the latter of whom unleashed two great sidesteps to set up what some have described as &quot;the greatest try of all time&quot;. South African Naas Botha scored 312 points (including a record 17 drop goals) despite playing most of his career when the Springboks were boycotted. Australia&#x27;s Mark Ella used his vision, passing skills and game management to orchestrate a new flat-back attacking style. Grant Fox was one of the most respected goal-kickers who scored more than 1,000 points in all matches for New Zealand. Barry John was known simply as &quot;the king&quot; to Welsh rugby fans and was rated third in the 1971 BBC Sports Personality of the Year Award. Jack Kyle is widely considered Ireland&#x27;s greatest player. Michael Lynagh took over fly-half from Ella, and in his first test in that position scored an Australian record of 23 points against Canada. Bennie Osler played for South Africa from 1924 until 1933, during which he played a South African record of 17 consecutive games and scored a then world record of 14 points in one game against New Zealand. Hugo Porta is regarded as one of the finest players that Argentina has produced and has been a member of the Laureus World Sports Academy since 2000.

Of the players mentioned above, Ella, Kyle, Morgan, Osler and Porta are members of the IRB Hall of Fame. Four fly-halves are in the IRB Hall but not the International Hall. Gareth Rees of Canada played in all of the first four Rugby World Cups, and remains the country&#x27;s all-time leading test points scorer. Kennedy Tsimba of Zimbabwe, younger brother of the aforementioned Richard, only played four times for his country, but was one of the world&#x27;s top fly-halves in the early 21st century, twice being named the player of the year in South Africa&#x27;s domestic Currie Cup. He was also the first black player to captain the Zimbabwe national team. Thomas Lawton, Snr, an Australian inducted in 2013, was one of the leading fly-halves of the 1920s and early 1930s.

==== Scrum-half====
The scrum-half (number 9) is the link between the forwards and the backs. They receive the ball from the line-out and remove the ball from the back of the scrum, usually passing it to the fly-half. They also feed the scrum. Along with the fly-half, they make many of the tactical decisions on the field. During general play, the scrum-half is generally the player who receives the ball from the forwards and passes it to the backs. They are good communicators, especially at directing the forwards around, and their aim is to provide the backs with clean ball. Good scrum-halves have an excellent pass, a good tactical kick and are deceptive runners. At defensive scrums they put pressure on the opposition scrum-half or defend the blindside. On defence in open play they generally cover for deep kicks after the ball has been passed wide. Traditionally, scrum-halves have been the smallest players on the team, but many modern scrum-halves are a similar size to the other players in the team.

Five scrum-halves are members of the International Rugby Hall of Fame; four of them are also in the IRB Hall of Fame. Ken Catchpole of Australia was made captain on his debut at 21 in 1961, and went on to captain the Wallabies in nearly half of his 27 tests. Danie Craven from South Africa was one of the greatest scrum halves in the 1930s and a respected administrator of the South African Rugby Board. Gareth Edwards played for Wales and the British and Irish Lions during the 1970s and is regarded by many as the greatest player in history. Nick Farr-Jones captained Australia through their 1991 Rugby World Cup winning campaign; he was enshrined in the International Hall in 1999. When Joost van der Westhuizen retired in 2003, he had 89 caps, at the time the most for any South African. Of these players, only van der Westhuizen is not in the IRB Hall.

Three scrum-halves are in the IRB Hall but not the International Hall. New Zealander David Kirk, inducted in 2011, was captain of the All Blacks team that won the inaugural 1987 Rugby World Cup. Fellow 2011 inductee Agustín Pichot, who played in three World Cups for Argentina, is perhaps best known as the Pumas&#x27; captain during their surprise run to third place in the 2007 World Cup, which eventually led to their 2012 entry into The Rugby Championship, previously the Tri Nations. Australian George Gregan, inducted in 2013, retired from international rugby in 2007 with a then-world record 139 test caps, and also captained the Wallabies 59 times.

==Forwards==
===Back row (Loose forwards)===
The back row (or loose forwards) consists of three players – two flankers, one on either side of the scrum; and a number eight at the back of the scrum.

==== Number eight====

The number eight, or eighthman in South Africa, binds between the locks at the back of the scrum, providing extra weight at the push. Number eights interact with the scrum-half at the back of the scrum to control and provide clean ball for the backs. They can also pick the ball from the back of the scrum and run with it or pass it to the scrum-half. At line-outs, they can be either another jumper or a lifter. Around the field, they have a similar set of responsibilities as the flankers at the breakdown. Number eights are often strong ball carriers and run off the backs in an attempt to break through or push past the opposition&#x27;s defensive line.

Number eights in the International Rugby Hall of Fame include: Mervyn Davies (Wales and British and Irish Lions), Morne du Plessis (South Africa), Brian Lochore (New Zealand) and Hennie Muller (South Africa).

==== Flanker====
The flanker&#x27;s role is to tackle the opposition and try to steal the ball. The openside flanker (number 7) binds to the side of the scrum that covers the greatest area, while the blindside flanker (number 6) covers the side nearest the side-line. They bind loosely to the side of the scrum, but still play an important role in keeping the props tight by pushing at an angle. They should be the first forward to a breakdown from a scrum or line-out and are expected to link with the backline or secure the ball at the tackle. Both positions have a high workrate, meaning the players need to be fit, fast and good at reading the opposition&#x27;s attacking plays.

During open play if they have not made the tackle they usually stand in the loose next to the ruck or maul. This allows them to arrive quickly at the next tackle. The blindside is generally the larger of the two and usually acts as a third jumping option at the line-out. The openside flanker is usually faster than the blindside, with good opensides excellent at turning over the ball at the tackle. Teams often use their openside flankers to &#x27;charge&#x27; the opposition fly-half, putting pressure on him and forcing him to rush his decision-making, kicking or passing. Blindside flankers also have the task of stopping any attempt by the opposition&#x27;s number eight to run with the ball around the blindside of a scrum.

Flankers in the International Rugby Hall of Fame include: Dave Gallaher, Michael Jones, Ian Kirkpatrick, Graham Mourie (all New Zealand), Francois Pienaar (South Africa), Jean Prat (France), Jean-Pierre Rives (France), Fergus Slattery (Ireland and Lions), and Wavell Wakefield (England). Pienaar and Prat are also members of the IRB Hall of Fame.

=== Locks===
The locks form the second row, with the loosehead lock (number 4) on the left and the tighthead lock (number 5) on the right. They scrummage by pushing against the front row, thereby providing much of the power, and are commonly known as the engine room. They are almost always the tallest players in a team, and are the primary targets when the ball is thrown in at line-outs. Locks must also have good catching and tackling ability. At the line-out the locks are lifted and supported by teammates, allowing them to compete for the ball, either passing or tapping it to the scrumhalf or setting up a drive. In scrums the two locks bind tightly together, and each puts their head between a prop and the hooker. They compete for the kick-offs, and are involved in securing the ball in rucks and mauls. They commonly make short runs carrying the ball into contact (sometimes known as &quot;crash balls&quot;).

Locks in the International Rugby Hall of Fame include: Bill Beaumont (England and Lions), Gordon Brown (Scotland and Lions), Frik du Preez (South Africa), John Eales (Australia), Martin Johnson (England and Lions), Brian Lochore (New Zealand), Willie John McBride (Ireland and Lions), and Colin Meads (New Zealand). Du Preez, Eales, Johnson and McBride are also members of the IRB Hall of Fame as players; Lochore was inducted into the IRB Hall primarily as a coach. Three locks are members of the IRB Hall of Fame but not the International Hall—Fairy Heatlie, a South African great of the era around 1900 who was also one of the first Argentina internationals; French international Lucien Mias; and early 20th-century Scottish international David Bedell-Sivright.

===Front row===
==== Prop====

The props &quot;prop up&quot; the hooker in the scrum. They form part of the front row of the scrum and push against the opposition&#x27;s props. The loosehead prop (number 1) is positioned to the left of the hooker and their head will be on the outside of the scrum when it engages. The tighthead prop (number 3) is to the right of the hooker with their head positioned between the opposition hooker and the opposition loosehead prop. The prop&#x27;s main role is to provide stability at the scrum and support the hooker in quickly winning the ball. At the line-out, the prop&#x27;s role is to support the jumper as they compete for the ball. They are usually positioned at the front of the line-out with a jumper in between them. They are also often involved in lifting jumpers when receiving kick-offs. While scrummaging is still seen as their main responsibility, modern props are also expected to contribute in the attack and defence.

Props have to take in pressure from the locks and loose forwards pushing from behind and the opposition pushing against them, so they are often among the strongest players in a team. Some of the more successful props have short necks and broad shoulders to absorb this force as well as powerful legs to drive the scrum forward. Since the game has become professional, non-specialist props or hookers cannot play in the front row. If, through sendings-off or injuries, a team does not have enough specialist front row players, the scrums become &#x27;uncontested&#x27; (i.e. no pushing is allowed and the team putting the ball into the scrum wins it). On their own scrum, the loosehead&#x27;s role is to provide the hooker with a clear view to strike the ball, while the tighthead tries to keep the scrum stable. When the opposition is putting the ball in, the tighthead attempts to disrupt the opposing hooker or loosehead, making it difficult for them to win the ball.

Props in the International Rugby Hall of Fame include: Jason Leonard (England and Lions), Syd Millar (Ireland and Lions) and Wilson Whineray (New Zealand).

==== Hooker====

The hooker (number 2) is positioned between the two props in the scrum. After the scrumhalf throws the ball into the scrum, the hooker from the team which threw in the ball must strike for the ball. Any front-row player may use a foot to strike for the ball and gain possession. However, given the role of the props in keeping the scrum stable, it is usually one of the hookers who successfully &quot;hooks&quot; the ball back with the movement of a leg and foot coming into contact with the ball to win possession for their team. Hookers generally have a short back and long arms to aid in binding to the props. Hookers are usually more mobile than the props, and are often used to carry the ball up during open play. Only specialist front-row players can play hooker; if a team cannot field one for any reason, the scrums will become uncontested. In addition to their role in the scrum, hookers generally throw the ball into the line-out.

Hookers in the International Rugby Hall of Fame include: Sean Fitzpatrick (New Zealand) and Keith Wood (Ireland and Lions). Two hookers are members of the IRB Hall. John Smit of South Africa, captain of the World Cup-winning Springboks in 2007, was inducted in 2011. Ronnie Dawson of Ireland and the Lions was inducted in 2013. He earned 27 caps for Ireland and appeared 17 times for the Lions from 1958 to 1965, captaining the Lions in six tests; after his playing career ended, he became the first head coach of Ireland and still later served as president of the IRFU and chairman of the IRB Council.

==Utility players==
Players who have the ability to play a number of positions in a team are called utility players. Utility players can be seen as &quot;Jack of all trades&quot; and they generally occupy the reserve position in a team. For this reason, many try to avoid being labelled as utilities. Players in the forward positions are generally more specialised than those that play in the backs. However, flankers can usually play number eight, like Grégory Alldritt, David Pocock, Caelan Doris and Kieran Read. Many players may also be capable of playing lock as well as a back-row position, with several modern examples being Sébastien Chabal, Maro Itoje, Tadhg Beirne, Ryan Baird, Courtney Lawes, Steven Luatua, and Cameron Woki, all with international caps in both rows of the scrum. The front row positions are usually very specialised, although some props can play both sides or even hooker. South African captain and IRB Hall of Fame member John Smit has played test matches in every front row position. Another IRB Hall member to have played multiple forward positions is 2013 inductee John Thornett, an Australian utility forward who played at flanker, number 8, lock and prop for the Wallabies from 1955 to 1967. 

Utility backs tend to cover a greater number of positions, with players commonly switching between scrum-half and fly-half, fly-half and centre, or wing and full-back. Another famous utility player was Austin Healey, who started and played test matches for England and club matches for Leicester Tigers at fly half, scrum-half, full-back and winger. Among members of the International Rugby or IRB Halls of Fame, Mike Gibson has 28 caps at fly-half, 48 at centre and 4 on the wing, and Tim Horan played 62 tests at centre, 2 on the wing and 9 at full-back. Danie Craven mostly played at half-back, but has also started a test in the forwards at number 8. Matt Giteau has also shown great versatility throughout his career, playing 6 tests at scrum-half, 46 at fly-half, 50 at centre and one on the wing. 2013 IRB Hall inductee Waisale Serevi, although most famous as a sevens player and primarily a fly-half in 15s, also started tests as a scrum-half, full-back and wing, and came off the bench once as a centre and once as an emergency lock.

==Rugby sevens==
Rugby sevens teams have only seven players on the field and can nominate five substitutes. The seven players are split into three forwards and four backs. Scrums are formed with three players who bind together the same as the front row. There are four backs: scrum-half, fly-half, centre, and wing. The scrum-half feeds the ball into the scrum. The other three players form the backline. Since play is much more open in sevens, with rucks and mauls generally kept to a minimum, most sevens players are backs or loose forwards in fifteen-a-side teams.

When a team is defending in open play or from a penalty kick, the defending team will often play a line of six defenders across the field, with one player deeper known as the &quot;sweeper&quot; whose role is to field kicks or to tackle attacking players who have broken through the defensive line.

<text>West Bridgford () is a town and the administrative centre of the Borough of Rushcliffe, in the county of Nottinghamshire, England. It lies south of Nottingham city centre, east of Wilford, north of Ruddington and west of Radcliffe-on-Trent; it is also south-west of Colwick and south-east of Beeston, which are on the opposite bank of the River Trent. The town is part of the Nottingham Urban Area and had a population of 36,487 in the 2021 Census.

==History==
West Bridgford was founded between 919 and 924, when defences and houses were built at the south end of Trent Bridge. It was established by Edward the Elder to protect Nottingham and the surrounding area against incursions from Danes in the North of England. A survey during Edward&#x27;s reign indicates that the population at this time was 192 people, 19 of whom were farmers.

Some main roads in central West Bridgford are named after wealthy families that dominated its early history.

The roads in the Gamston development have names from the Lake District, and Compton Acres from Dorset and the Purbeck Coast.

At the end of the First World War, the Musters family sold the Trent Bridge Inn and Trent Bridge cricket ground to the county cricket club. The club owned the inn briefly, then sold it at a profit to a brewery. After pressure, the Musters sold land for building, but strict planning regulations were stipulated for the West Bridgford Estate. This was planned over a grid of tree-lined roads. The main roads, such as Musters Road, had restrictions on housing density and size. All houses had to contain a specified number of bedrooms. Smaller houses were permitted on side roads and terraces were erected on roads such as Exchange Road for the servants of wealthy Nottingham merchants who had bought West Bridgford property.

The result is a community separate from Nottingham, with no ties of governance to it.

Though some services like business waste and cycling park provisions are carried out or provided by Nottingham City Council.

In Nottingham, West Bridgford was sometimes negatively dubbed &quot;Bread and Lard Island&quot;, suggesting that its residents had spent so much on big houses and fur coats that they could only afford to eat bread and lard. It grew from a small village in the mid-19th century into a town of over 36,000 inhabitants by 2021.

==Geography==

The northern boundary of West Bridgford is the River Trent. The river is spanned by two road bridges and a pedestrianised bridge allowing access from the town to the city of Nottingham. The bridges link to cycling routes in the city centre, railway station and the university areas.

==Bridges==
* Trent Bridge has three traffic lanes in each direction. It is decorated on the sides with carvings visible from the river. In 2017, it was fitted with permanent steel safety barriers at pavement level to protect pedestrians attending major sporting events. Two spans of the original medieval bridge remain, surrounded by a traffic island on the south side of the river, adjacent to Trent Bridge.
* Lady Bay Bridge has a single traffic lane in each direction. It was originally the rail crossing for the Midland Railway&#x27;s &quot;Melton loop&quot; from London to via , avoiding . Despite the line passing on an embankment through the centre of area, there was never a West Bridgford station; the nearest station was at Edwalton, which closed in July 1941, as did the line in May 1967. Much of the embankment has been removed and the route built over, but part has been converted into a public footpath. Some signs of railway sleepers and ballast can still be seen on the path.
* Wilford Suspension Bridge is a cycle and pedestrian bridge to the west of Trent Bridge, linking with The Meadows.
* The planned Waterside Bridge will give cycling and pedestrian access to Trent Basin and Colwick Country Park.

==Architecture==

The central West Bridgford area has a diversity of buildings, mostly Victorian, although larger properties are being demolished for development, as no protection exists for the common housing stock. St. Giles Church is medieval, but was heavily restored at the end of the 19th century.

==Local government==
West Bridgford was created as an urban sanitary district in 1891 and became an urban district with an elected council under the Local Government Act 1894. In 1935, the parishes of Edwalton and South Wilford were added to the urban district. This then became part of the larger borough of Rushcliffe under the Local Government Act 1972.

The town is part of the constituency of Rushcliffe, which is held currently by James Naish of the Labour Party.

Nottinghamshire County Council&#x27;s headquarters are at County Hall, a municipal building on the south bank of the River Trent. Rushcliffe Borough Council&#x27;s headquarters are at Rushcliffe Arena, a joint headquarters and leisure facility on Rugby Road.

==Sport==

Nottingham Forest Football Club play at the City Ground, beside the River Trent. The club was founded in 1865 and has played at the site since 1898. Between 1975 and 1993, Nottingham Forest was managed by Brian Clough and won a Football League title, two European Cups and four Football League Cups; it fielded players including Trevor Francis, Peter Shilton, John Robertson, Martin O&#x27;Neill, Stuart Pearce and Roy Keane.

At local level, West Bridgford has a number of football teams for all ages. West Bridgford Colts FC are thought to be the largest FA-approved football organisation in the country, running over 144 teams (checked Feb 2024) the club includes West Bridgford Football Club the Senior section for Colts, which started in 2011 on Saturday afternoons in the Nottinghamshire Senior League. Also playing in the Nottinghamshire Senior League are Magdala Amateurs who play at the ROKO Ground.

Trent Bridge Cricket Ground was first used in 1838 and held its first test match in 1899, when England played against Australia. It is the third oldest ground used as a test cricket venue after Lord&#x27;s in London and Eden Gardens in Calcutta, India. Trent Bridge is home to Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club, a first-class cricket club.

There are two rowing clubs in West Bridgford: Nottingham Rowing Club and &quot;Nottingham and Union Rowing Club&quot;, along with a rowing shell manufacturer, &quot;Raymond Sims Ltd&quot;. Several of the town&#x27;s secondary schools feature rowing activities.

West Bridgford has two large Rugby Union clubs: Nottingham Moderns RFC in Wilford village and West Bridgford Rugby Club. Nottingham RFC moved its training base and reserve team ground from Ireland Road, Beeston, to Lady Bay after the 2005/2006 season. It plays first-team fixtures at Meadow Lane, just over Trent Bridge from West Bridgford.

There are two interlinked Karate clubs in West Bridgford: South Notts Shotokan Karate Club (SNSKC) and West Bridgford Shotokan Karate Club (WBSKC), both of which are KUGB clubs.

West Bridgford Hockey Club on Loughborough Road was the childhood hockey club of Olympic Gold medallist and former West Bridgford resident Helen Richardson-Walsh.

==Retail==
West Bridgford was the location of the UK&#x27;s first major out-of-town superstore. In 1964, an American company, GEM, opened a store on Loughborough Road. Despite ambitions, GEM&#x27;s British operations were not a success, with only two other such stores opening. National concessionaires withdrew, and in 1966 the fledgling Asda superstore chain, owned by a Leeds-based dairy farming conglomerate, Associated Dairies, acquired a controlling interest in the GEM operations. The Loughborough Road site has an Asda store, although it was replaced by a much larger one on land adjacent to the old site in 1999. The original building was demolished and replaced by a car park and petrol station area.

In 2018, Rushcliffe Borough Council appointed a team of retail consultants to recommend improvements and changes to the town&#x27;s shopping areas and the wider public realm. These included better road design, with landscaping points to improve the movement of people from Gordon Road through to Central Avenue. Both roads have independent retailers and national chains. Other proposals included moving Bridgford Road car park underground and putting retail space at ground level. These proposals have largely been abandoned and, presently in 2024, have not been followed through.

==Education==
The West Bridgford School and Rushcliffe School are secondary schools with academy status. The Becket School and The Nottingham Emmanuel School are Catholic and Church of England schools respectively, both in West Bridgford, but operated through Nottingham City Council. The Becket School is fed by primary schools around Nottingham, but by only one school in West Bridgford: St Edmund Campion Catholic Primary School. The other feeder schools are Blessed Robert, St Edmund Campion, Our Lady and St Edward&#x27;s.

The West Bridgford School&#x27;s feeder primary schools are West Bridgford Infant and Junior School, Jesse Gray Primary School, Heymann Primary School and Greythorn Primary School. Rushcliffe School&#x27;s feeder primary schools are Abbey Road Primary School, Pierpont Gamston Primary School, Edwalton Primary School, Lady Bay Primary School and St Peter&#x27;s School in Ruddington.

==Transport==

===Railway===
The nearest railway station is , which lies approximately 1.5 miles north-west of the town in the city centre. It is a principal station on the Midland Main Line; East Midlands Railway operates regular inter-city services to and London St Pancras.

The former Manton Route from Nottingham to Melton Mowbray ran to the east of the town, although no station was ever built here. Instead, there was a station at Edwalton but it closed to passengers in 1944, with the through line to Nottingham not long after. Only a stub remains in use south of the old station site to Melton Mowbray as the Old Dalby Test Track. The site of Edwalton station has since been redeveloped for housing.

There was also a station in Ruddington on the Great Central Main Line between Loughborough Central and Nottingham Victoria; this closed in 1969 and since been left unused.

<doc id="771811" wikidata="Q1760545" url="?curid=771811" title="XML editor">
<text>An XML editor is a markup language editor with added functionality to facilitate the editing of XML. This can be done using a plain text editor, with all the code visible, but XML editors have added facilities like tag completion and menus and buttons for tasks that are common in XML editing, based on data supplied with document type definition (DTD) or the XML tree.

There are also graphical XML editors that hide the code in the background and present the content to the user in a more user-friendly format, approximating the rendered version or editing forms. This is helpful for situations where people who are not fluent in XML code need to enter information in XML based documents such as time sheets and expenditure reports. And even if the user is familiar with XML, use of such editors, which take care of syntax details, is often faster and more convenient.

==Functionality beyond syntax highlighting==

An XML editor goes beyond the syntax highlighting offered by many plaintext editors and generic source code editors, verifying the XML source based on an XML schema or XML DTD, and some can do it as the document is being edited in real time.
Other features of an editor designed specifically for editing XML might include element word completion and automatic appending of a closing tag whenever an opening tag is entered.
These features can help to prevent typographically originating errors in the XML code.
Some XML editors provide for the ability to run an XSLT transform, or series of transforms, over a document. Some of the larger XML packages even offer XSLT debugging features and XSL-FO processors for generation of PDF files from documents.

 &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot;?&gt;
 &lt;TrackedItemsList&gt;
 &lt;FlowRecipeID Value=&quot;TestPP.BND&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;MaterialID Value=&quot;54321&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;/TrackedItemsList&gt;

==Graphical editors==

Graphical editors based on GUIs may be easier for some people to use than text editors, and may not require knowledge of XML syntax. These are often called WYSIWYG (&quot;What You See Is What You Get&quot;) editors, but not all of them are WYSIWYG: graphical XML editors can be WYSIWYG when they try to display the final rendering or WYSIWYM (&quot;What You See Is What You Mean&quot;) when they try to display the actual meaning of XML elements. When they are not WYSIWYG, they do not display the (or one of the) graphical end result of a document, but instead focus on conveying the meaning of the text. They use DTDs or XML schemas and/or configuration files to map XML elements to graphical components.

These kinds of editors are generally more useful for XML languages for data rather than for storing documents. Documents tend to be fairly free-form in structure, which tends to defy the generally rigid nature of many graphical editors.

In the above example, the editor is using a configuration file to know that the TABLE element represents a table, the TR element represents a row of the table, and the TD element represents a cell of the table. It is using this information to display the table based on this structuring information, in order to make editing easier.

Schema and configuration files information can also be used to ensure that users do not create invalid documents. For instance, in a text editor, it is possible to create a row with too many cells in the table, while this would not be possible with the above graphical user interface.

==WYSIWYG editors==

WYSIWYG editors let people edit files directly with the tags represented by some form of graphical viewing rather than bare XML code. Often, WYSIWYG editors attempt to emulate the result of some transform or CSS stylesheet application. This emulation may or may not be possible, depending on the transformation from XML into the result.

Naive use of a WYSIWYG editor can lead to the creation of documents that do not have the intrinsic semantics of the particular XML language. This comes about if the user is focused on trying to achieve a certain visual presentation with the editor, rather than using the WYSIWYG to make editing the document easier. For instance, someone creating a web page could use an H2 element (meaning: second level title) instead of H1 (meaning: first level title) because it looks smaller on their current WYSIWYG editor. Such an author is making a choice based on the apparent visual representation, but a visitor to the author&#x27;s web page can offer a very different rendering in their browser.

However, as long as the underlying meaning of the document is understood by the author, and the author does not make decisions based on the exact look in the WYSIWYG editor, such an editor can be of value to the writer. It is generally much easier to read a document that is being rendered in some fashion than it is to read the raw XML code. Also, editing can be much more intuitive, as the WYSIWYG editor can use tools similar to many word processing applications. Some WYSIWYG editors even allow the user to use a DTD or Schema and define their own user interface for editing.

Usually WYSIWYG editors support CSS but not XSLT, because XSLT transformations can be very complex, and guessing what the user meant when changing the result can be impossible. The WYSIWYG editors that do support XSLT, such as Syntext Serna, will therefore apply changes directly to the original XML, while updating the view by running the XSLT for every change.

In the above example, a stylesheet is used to color table cells in a particular way. For instance, even rows do not have the same background color as odd rows, in order to make reading easier.

<text>The Black Country Urban Forest (BCUF) is a project to make urban forestry the characteristic landscape of one of England&#x27;s industrial areas, The Black Country.

It is not a forest in the modern sense of a large area of managed woodland. It is closer to the old concept of a Royal forest – a large area of land with many different land uses and activities, except that instead of being dedicated to the enjoyment of the privileged few, the BCUF is an amenity for all the people, from all backgrounds, that live in it.

==Origins==
The BCUF resulted from the “Millennium Forest”, the most ambitious urban forestry project ever undertaken in the UK – a huge program of urban tree planting and management of urban woodlands, creating a tremendous increase in the area of woodland in the area.

The Black Country (the part of the West Midlands conurbation consisting of the city of Wolverhampton and the Metropolitan Boroughs of Dudley, Sandwell, and Walsall) was the &#x27;forge&#x27; of the Industrial Revolution, and the legacy of this was huge areas of derelict land. Even at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries the Midland reafforesting association was creating new woodlands on former colliery tips and other suitable sites across the area. At the end of the 20th Century ambitious targets were set and huge increases in planting proposed.

==Development==
The successful project, “Treeways”, focused on transport corridors in the area, and acted as a pilot. The four voluntary sector principals in this project – National Urban Forestry Unit (NUFU), Wildlife Trust for Birmingham and the Black Country, British Trust for Conservation Volunteers (BTCV) and Groundwork Black Country. They went on to work closely with the four local authorities to propose the ambitious Millennium programme. Despite setbacks, and problems with achieving all the projected outputs, the project was essentially successful, and the concept of the BCUF continues. 

As well as tree planting and woodland management, woodland based businesses were supported, events and activities organised to engage local communities and studies of the area&#x27;s biodiversity were carried out.

The Millennium Forest project was funded by the UK&#x27;s Millennium Fund, matched by regeneration funding from the UK government and Europe, grants from the Forestry Commission and many other sources. The total cost was over £7 million.

A similar and wider project was started in 2006/7, the £50m Black Country Urban Park.

Responsibility for the Black Country Urban Forest is now shared between Groundwork Black Country and the landowners, each of whom entered into a 99-year deed of dedication, a legal agreement with the Millennium Commission.

<doc id="771831" wikidata="Q1442062" url="?curid=771831" title="Count Orlok">
<text>Count Orlok (; ; ) is a fictional character who first appeared in the silent film &quot;Nosferatu&quot; (1922) directed by F. W. Murnau. Based on Bram Stoker&#x27;s Count Dracula, he is played by German actor Max Schreck, and is depicted as a repulsive vampire descended from Belial, who leaves his homeland of Transylvania to spread the plague in the idyllic city of Wisborg in Biedermeier period Germany, only to find death at the hands of a self-sacrificing woman.

Count Orlok would reappear in subsequent remakes, played by Klaus Kinski, Doug Jones and Bill Skarsgård, as well as in comic book adaptations and sequels. He is also a character in &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot;, debuting in the season 2 episode Graveyard Shift. Orlok&#x27;s distinct appearance, which is closer to that of vampires of Eastern European folklore than to traditional depictions of Dracula, influenced numerous later vampire designs, including those of &quot;Salem&#x27;s Lot&quot;, &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; and the &quot;Blade&quot; film franchise, typically in order to distance the creatures from their more conventionally humanized or charming counterparts.

==Name==
As &quot;Nosferatu&quot; is an unauthorized and unofficial adaptation of Bram Stoker&#x27;s 1897 novel &quot;Dracula&quot;, character names were changed in an attempt to avoid accusations of copyright infringement, including changing Count Dracula&#x27;s name to Count Orlok which, according to historian Matei Cazacu, derives from the Romanian &quot;vârcolac&quot;, while David Annwn Jones links it phonetically to the Hungarian &quot;ordog&quot;. Jones also notes how &quot;orlok&quot; is an archaic form of the Dutch &quot;oorlog&quot;, meaning &quot;war&quot;. Alternative spellings have included &quot;Orlock&quot;, &quot;Orlac&quot; and &quot;Orloc&quot;.

The character is nevertheless referred to as &quot;Nosferatu&quot; in the film&#x27;s publicity material and in director F. W. Murnau&#x27;s annotated copy of the script. The character is referred to as Dracula in some rereleases of the film.

In Werner Herzog&#x27;s 1979 remake, &quot;Nosferatu the Vampyre&quot;, the character names revert to those used in the original novel, while the 2023 and 2024 remakes maintain the names used in the original 1922 film. In the 1988 sequel to the 1979 film, &quot;Vampire in Venice&quot;, the character is referred to as &quot;Nosferatu&quot;.

==Creation==

The character was largely conceived by Prana Film founder and occultist artist Albin Grau. Grau claimed he was inspired to shoot &quot;Nosferatu&quot; after meeting a farmer during the Serbian campaign, who stated that his father had been a vampire.

Grau had a strong influence on Orlok&#x27;s look, which was inspired by &#x27;s illustrations for Gustav Meyrink&#x27;s &quot;The Golem&quot;. He may have also been influenced by the corpses he saw in the trenches of the First World War. Further links to the war have been noticed in Orlok&#x27;s association with rats, which were a persistent nuisance in the trenches, and the character suddenly appearing enveloped in thick smoke, which has been linked to the poison gas used during the conflict. Grau also had the character correspond with Knock through letters filled with Enochian, hermetic and alchemical symbols.

The character was played by Max Schreck, whose military experiences during the First World War have been thought to have influenced his performance. According to Grau&#x27;s diary entries, Schreck, when in full makeup, was &quot;shunned&quot; by the Slovak assistants on set. His portrayal of Orlok was the first to depict vampires as being fatally vulnerable to sunlight. Previous vampire portrayals had shown them being uncomfortable with sunlight, but not mortally susceptible.

==Characterization==
In &quot;Nosferatu&quot;, the Count is described in the fictional book &quot;Of Vampyres, Ghastly Spirits, Witchcraft, and the Seven Deadly Sins&quot; as a hematophagous creature that dwells in dank caves, tombs and coffins filled with soil gathered from graveyards containing the victims of the Black Death. The book elaborates that Orlok originated from the &quot;seed of Belial&quot;, an entity described in the Dead Sea Scrolls as one of four Satanic archdemons and associated with pestilence in Psalm 41: 8-10. David Annwn Jones notes that this is in contrast to Count Dracula, upon whom the character was based, as Orlok is never stated to have once been human or of being an undead revenant, being instead a creature of demonic lineage who sleeps in coffins merely for the sake of protection against sunlight and convenience in transporting the rats under his command. The film contains no references to a Dracula-like noble ancestry and does not feature any brides or gypsy henchmen, with Orlok&#x27;s lust for the character of Ellen Hutter being his only human affiliation. Jones further comments that:

As noted by J. Gordon Melton, Orlok resembles folkloric vampires more than Dracula, being thoroughly repulsive, sporting a bald head, a beaklike nose, hollowed-out eyes, pointed ears, and sharp fingernails. His fangs, rather than being elongated canines, are positioned at the front of his mouth like those of a rat. He walks with a slow and labored gait, and his attire consists of a long black coat and tight pants which, according to , &quot;give the impression of skeletal limbs tightly wrapped in funereal clothes&quot;. Orlok also lacks Dracula&#x27;s suave or charm, acting with unrelenting strangeness, with his initial demeanor toward the character of Thomas Hutter being that of an old Eastern European aristocrat who has outlived his societal usefulness. All of these traits combined preclude the possibility of him ever being mistaken for a human, thus preventing viewers from identifying with him.

While never seen shapeshifting in the film, he is nevertheless shown to be capable of walking through walls, as per Stoker. His association with the plague, while absent in Dracula, is consistent with vampiric mythology, as vampires were once blamed for several historical epidemics. Unlike Stoker&#x27;s Dracula, he casts a shadow and reflects in mirrors.

==Fictional character biography==
Count Orlok is a vampire from Transylvania known as the &quot;Bird of Death&quot; who dwells alone in a vast castle hidden among the rugged peaks in a lost corner of the Carpathian Mountains. The castle and its master, forgotten by the world for centuries, are swathed in shadows and exhibit a highly sinister feel due to years of neglect. The local peasants live in terror of phantoms and werewolves haunting the region and never venture out after dark.

During the Biedermeier period in 1838, Orlok forms a pact with the housing agent Knock, promising him wealth in exchange for a house in the (fictional) city of Wisborg, Germany. Orlok receives Knock&#x27;s employee, Thomas Hutter, and almost reveals his true nature after Hutter accidentally cuts his finger, causing the Count to briefly lose control. Orlok then feeds off Hutter after he collapses from shock. When Hutter regains consciousness, Orlok signs the documents to purchase the house and notices a miniature portrait of Hutter&#x27;s wife, Ellen, remarking that she has a &quot;lovely neck.&quot;

After Hutter discovers Orlok&#x27;s vampiric nature, the Count attempts to feed off him again, but is repelled when he telepathically senses Ellen&#x27;s distress. The next morning, Orlok is discovered &quot;sleeping&quot; in a filthy coffin filled with earth. Hutter then witnesses Orlok loading a cart with several coffins filled with soil, one of which he then hides in, and they are driven off to be loaded onto the ship &quot;Empusa&quot; headed for Wisborg.

During his journey through Europe, he kills everyone onboard the &quot;Empusa&quot; and spreads the plague throughout the continent. Upon his arrival in Wisborg, Orlok infests the city with rats that sleep in his coffins, and countless people fall victim to the plague, forcing the local authorities to declare a quarantine and provoking hysteria among the citizens. Ellen learns that the Nosferatu can be vanquished only if a woman pure in heart willingly allows him to feed on her long enough to prevent him from seeking shelter from sunrise. Ellen coaxes Orlok to her room and lies in bed whilst he drinks from her neck. The sun rises, and Orlok is burned away in a cloud of smoke.

==Interpretations==
In his &quot;From Caligari to Hitler&quot;, Siegfried Kracauer identified Orlok as a &quot;scourge of God&quot; comparable to Attila, noting that it was &quot;highly significant that during this period German imagination, regardless of its starting-point, always gravitated towards such figures — as if under the compulsion of love-hate&quot;. draws a parallel between Orlok&#x27;s attempt at subjugating Wisborg with the failed imperial ambitions of Wilhelm II, but notes that &quot;the vampire at least had the consolation of experiencing love&quot;. notes how Orlok&#x27;s thirst for blood represents a love of eternal values rather than the &quot;erratic sphere of commerce&quot;, which would have resonated with contemporary audiences living in a period of inflation and multicultural tension. Kaes also draws a link between Orlok and the shell shocked veterans returning from the Eastern Front, with Orlok being interpreted as the personification of Thomas Hutter&#x27;s trauma, intruding into his personal life and competing for the love of Ellen.

Some authors have compared Orlok&#x27;s appearance to stereotypical caricatures of Jewish people from the time in which &quot;Nosferatu&quot; was produced. His features have also been compared to those of a rat or a mouse, the former of which Jews were often equated with. J. Hoberman notes how Orlok&#x27;s actions in the film evoke &quot;both the blood libel and the accusation of poisoning wells to spread disease that resulted in widespread pogroms and the near-extermination of Jews throughout the Rhineland in the mid-14th century&quot;. Others have said that perceived associations between Orlok and antisemitic stereotypes are unlikely to have been conscious decisions, citing director F. W. Murnau&#x27;s protectiveness of Jewish cast members and status as a homosexual, which would have made him &quot;presumably more sensitive to the persecution of a subgroup inside the larger German society&quot;.

==Reception==
Reception to Orlok, and his perceived &quot;monstrousness&quot; compared to other vampires, has been very positive, with publication Vulture Magazine declaring, &quot;A defining Dracula movie in all but name, Nosferatu is one of the most important and influential films ever made, thanks in part to Schreck’s terrifying Count Orlok. With his teetering build, bat-shaped ears, and curling nails, Orlok remains a potently unsettling villain a hundred years later.&quot; Roger Ebert praised Schreck&#x27;s performance as Orlok, noting that it &quot;avoids most of the theatrical touches that would distract from all the later performances ... The vampire should come across not like a flamboyant actor but like a man suffering from a dread curse.&quot; Likewise, Kim Newman praised the monstrous nature of Orlock, stating, &quot;Schreck&#x27;s vampire is truly nightmarish, scuttling from shadows like something you&#x27;d really like to see back under its rock.&quot;
Conversely, André Gide believed the Orlok character was too overtly monstrous to credibly deceive the other characters. Mordaunt Hall was also critical, stating: &quot;Max Schreck&#x27;s movements as Nosferatu are too deliberate to be lifelike&quot;.

==Later depictions==
===Kinski&#x27;s portrayals===

The character was portrayed by Klaus Kinski in Werner Herzog&#x27;s 1979 remake &quot;Nosferatu the Vampyre&quot;. Herzog described this incarnation as &quot;not a monster, but an ambivalent, masterful force of change. When the plague threatens, people throw their property into the streets; they discard their bourgeois trappings. A re‐evaluation of life and its meaning takes place.&quot; Kinski described him as &quot;a man without free will. He cannot choose, and he cannot cease to be. He is a kind of incarnation of evil, but he is also a man who is suffering, suffering for love. This makes it so much more dramatic, more double‐edged.&quot;

Kinski&#x27;s make-up was an imitation of Max Schreck&#x27;s in the 1922 original and was applied by Japanese artist Reiko Kruk. Although Kinski fought with Herzog and others during the making of other films, he got along with Kruk, and the four-hour makeup sessions proceeded without any outbursts from Kinski himself.

Kinski&#x27;s portrayal was praised by Roger Ebert, who wrote that there is &quot;nothing pleasant about Herzog&#x27;s vampire&quot;, which was &quot;played totally without ego by Klaus Kinski ... [who] does honor to the seriousness of vampires. ... if they were real, here is how they must look&quot;, while describes Kinski&#x27;s portrayal as &quot;without doubt, the most repugnant vampire in cinematic history&quot;. David Annwn Jones notes how Kinski&#x27;s character plays down the demonic aspects of the original Orlok and approaches Dracula more closely, as he mentions his noble lineage and has the ability to create more vampires from his victims. Furthermore, Kinski&#x27;s vampire does not reflect in mirrors, unlike the original. Simon Bacon, in comparing Kinski&#x27;s performance to Schreck&#x27;s, notes:
In the 1988 pseudo-sequel to the 1979 remake, &quot;Vampire in Venice&quot;, the vampire, played by Kinski once again, is portrayed as a &quot;Byronic hero&quot; seeking death by making love to a virgin woman. The film includes several innovations in the vampire myth, showing the monster as being able to walk around in daylight, cast a reflection in mirrors and is undeterred by crosses. Kinski initially refused to shave his head and wear fake fangs for the role, though conceded and wore Orlok&#x27;s traditional rat-like fangs for several scenes. Matthew Edwards stated that &quot;Kinski paints his sadistic vampire with a sneering disgust for those around him&quot;, while Roberto Curti stated that Kinski&#x27;s performance &quot;drowns the film&quot;.

===2023 remake===
Orlok was played by Doug Jones in the 2023 remake. In an interview with &quot;Dread Central&quot;, he stated: &quot;I don&#x27;t think Orlok realizes how much he&#x27;s faded. In his mind, he&#x27;s still the dashing count he once was, and that dichotomy fascinated me&quot;. His makeup was restricted to his face and hands, and took four hours to apply. Regarding his portrayal, Jones said: &quot;The farther you get from human, the harder it is to play, ... Orlok&#x27;s humanity is still there, buried under layers of torment and hunger. That&#x27;s where the real performance comes from—his desires, regrets, and fears&quot;. Director David Lee Fisher explained that this interpretation of Orlok was deliberately distanced from Kinski&#x27;s portrayal and approached Shreck&#x27;s original performance more closely, being &quot;an elemental force of nature ... definitely destructive, but not necessarily evil&quot;.

Jone&#x27;s performance received mixed responses, with Tarryn Gaherty of &quot;Collider&quot; praising him as one of the best aspects of the film, &quot;masterfully combin[ing] physical acting with prosthetics and practical effects&quot;, while Jennie Kermode of &quot;Eye For Film&quot; compared him unfavourably to prior Orlok performers, stating &quot;he cannot capture the same air of uncanny charisma [as Max Schreck], which the film really depends on; neither can he compel the viewer’s attention as Klaus Kinski did in his attempts&quot;.

===2024 remake===
Bill Skarsgård played Orlok in Robert Eggers&#x27; 2024 remake. This incarnation is portrayed as a former Solomonar who had made a pact with Satan in a bid for immortality.

Skarsgård was originally set to play Thomas Hutter, but Eggers decided to cast him as Orlok after seeing his performance as Pennywise in &quot;It Chapter Two&quot;. Eggers&#x27; intention was to distance his Orlok from conventional cinematic vampires and to draw inspiration from folklore, resulting in a &quot;hulking brute with a booming voice — less vampire, more undead Transylvanian nobleman&quot;, while still retaining details recalling Schreck&#x27;s portrayal, such as fingernails, posture and the shape of the head. The makeup was applied by David White, who modeled the skin tone on that of a 17th-18th century wax sculpture. Orlok&#x27;s design in this film is partially inspired by Vlad Dracula, whom the original Dracula was named after, with Eggers stating that &quot;there&#x27;s never been a version of Dracula or Nosferatu dressed like a Transylvanian nobleman with authentic Hungarian attire from the 16th century.&quot; Costume designer Linda Muir sought inspiration from the Transylvanian military from around 1560 to the mid-1600s, incorporating pieces of clothing such as dolman, fur coat, or kolpak into Orlok&#x27;s costume. Skarsgård, having refused to have his voice digitally modulated, was trained to lower his voice by Icelandic opera singer Ásgerður Júníusdóttir, incorporating Mongolian throat singing into his lines. 
Inspired by Orlok being an ancient Romanian count, Eggers decided to have him speak a reconstructed form of the Dacian language in the film. In creating the interior of Orlok&#x27;s castle, production designer Craig Lathrop sought to give it a haunted look by keeping furniture to a minimum. Corvin Castle was selected for exterior shots for being &quot;in terrible shape&quot;, thus coinciding with the &quot;diseased&quot; aesthetic Lathrop wanted. For Orlok&#x27;s sarcophagus, he incorporated Solomonic sigils and Dacian designs.

Skarsgård&#x27;s performance has been positively received by critics. Peter Bradshaw described Skarsgård&#x27;s portrayal as &quot;opaque and forbiddingly gruesome without being necessarily as scary as could be expected&quot;, while Matt Zoller Seitz described it as Skarsgård&#x27;s &quot;best work yet&quot; which is best thought not &quot;as a performance, but a repugnant yet strangely mesmerizing obscenity, excavated from a tomb and placed in front of the camera&quot;. Wesley Morris described it as &quot;the grossest-looking, ooziest, most cooked, most rotted, most mustached, least-living Dracula I can recall. ... This &#x27;Nosferatu&#x27; dares you to feel seduced and sick over the seduction&quot;.

==Legacy==
Orlok&#x27;s fascination with Hutter&#x27;s picture of his wife and his emergence from his coffin onboard the &quot;Empusa&quot; in a &quot;jack-in-the-box&quot; fashion have been imitated in several subsequent &quot;Dracula&quot; adaptations.

Orlok&#x27;s design influenced that of Kurt Barlow in the 1979 miniseries &quot;Salem&#x27;s Lot&quot;. Orlok-like vampires have also appeared alongside their more conventional counterparts in &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; and the &quot;Blade&quot; film franchise, where they are, according to Simon Bacon, &quot;utilised in order to convey a formidable antagonist in contrast to the increasingly humanised vampires that surround both Buffy and Blade; a return to the monstrosity that underpins the mythology&quot;. Orlok&#x27;s design was also the inspiration behind some non-vampiric creatures, including the Remans from &quot;Star Trek: Nemesis&quot;.

Orlok appeared in the four-part &quot;&quot; comic book series by Mark Ellis, which fleshes out his backstory and places him in the modern era. In this series, he is portrayed as a Carpathian nobleman from the 11th century who was killed after becoming a vampire and sealed in his castle, only to be unwittingly resurrected by a crusader whom he vampirises. Orlok then causes havoc throughout history, only to be stopped in contemporary Brooklyn.

Orlok, referred to as &quot;Nosferatu&quot;, was included in the 2002 &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot; episode &quot;Graveyard Shift&quot;. Writer and storyboard director Jay Lender had initially wanted to create an original character called &quot;Floorboard Harry&quot;, but replaced him with Orlok as a tribute to the magazine series &quot;Famous Monsters of Filmland&quot;, which he had enjoyed as a child and where he had first seen images of Orlok. According to &quot;Polygon&quot; writer James Grebey, &quot;it&#x27;s entirely possible that more people have seen Count Orlok in that episode of &quot;SpongeBob&quot; than have seen &quot;Nosferatu&quot;&quot;. The character would appear in some subsequent episodes of &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot;, and a child version of the character named &quot;Kidferatu&quot; features in &quot;Kamp Koral: SpongeBob&#x27;s Under Years&quot;. Robert Eggers, the director of the 2024 &quot;Nosferatu&quot; remake, credited &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot; with introducing Count Orlok to younger audiences.

<doc id="771839" wikidata="Q29058" url="?curid=771839" title="Catalan Sheepdog">
<text>The Catalan Sheepdog (, ) is a Spanish breed of herding dog. It originated in valleys and foothills of the Pyrenees of Catalonia, but has spread throughout Catalonia and much of Spain; there are breed societies in Finland, France, Germany and Holland.

It was traditionally used to herd livestock, particularly horses and sheep. In the twenty-first century it may also be kept as a companion animal.

== History ==

The Gos d&#x27;Atura derives from the former wide and variable population of long-haired herding dogs in the Pyrenees, from which the Pyrenean Shepherd and the Euskal Artzain Txakurra also derive. It was recognised as a breed at the time of the formation of the Real Sociedad Central para el Fomento de las Razas Caninas en España in 1911. The first breed standard was drawn up in 1929, and was adopted by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale when it definitively accepted the breed in 1954. A new standard was prepared in 1982, and modified at the time of the formation of the Club del Gos d’Atura Català in 1984.

==Appearance==

Height at the withers is in the range for dogs, and for bitches. Their coat is long and either flat or slightly wavy, and ranges from fawn to dark sable and light to dark grey. There is also a short-haired variety of this breed, but it is nearly extinct.

=== Size and weight ===

Height at withers: 47−55 cm and 20−25 kg for male dogs; from 45 to 53 cm and 17–21 kg for females.

=== Hair and hair color ===

Long and limp and a little curled.
Seen from afar the dog seems to be unicolour and may have lighter shadings at the limbs. When seen close up, it is noticeable that the colour comes from a mixture of hairs of different colour shades: fawn, brown more or less reddish, grey and black.
Long, flat, or very slightly wavy, rough with abundant undercoat on the whole posterior third of the body. On the head a beard, moustaches, tuft and eyebrows which do not affect sight can be noticed. Tail well covered with hair as are all four limbs. It is noticeable that during moulting a typical phenomenon may be observed: it occurs in two periods. First of all it affects the coat on the front part, giving the impression of two halves with different coats; then moults the hind part of the dog and everything becomes uniform again.

===Temperament===
This breed is used for herding and as a pet dog. Because of its intelligence, the Gos D&#x27;Atura, like most sheepdogs, is easy to train. This cheerful dog excels at dog-sports, such as agility and doggy-dance. In spite of its appearance, this courageous dog is also used as a watch-dog. An &quot;all-around-dog&quot; and great companion.

They guard sheep without needing instruction. Enough (outdoor) activity and distraction makes this dog a quiet and well-balanced home companion. This breed is appropriate for people with firm techniques and who can give the dog enough exercise. Early socialization is important, particularly if the dog will be around children. The dogs defend their family and become attached to it.

==Health==
Catalan sheepdogs are prone to hip dysplasia. Their average life span is 12 to 14 years.

<text>Dean Arnold Corll (December 24, 1939 – August 8, 1973) was an American serial killer and sex offender who abducted, raped, tortured and murdered a minimum of twenty-eight teenage boys and young men between 1970 and 1973 in Houston and Pasadena, Texas. He was aided by two teenaged accomplices, David Owen Brooks and Elmer Wayne Henley. The crimes, which became known as the Houston Mass Murders, came to light after Henley fatally shot Corll. Upon discovery, the case was considered the worst example of serial murder in United States history.

Corll&#x27;s victims were typically lured with an offer of a party or a lift to one of the various addresses at which he resided between 1970 and 1973. They would then be restrained either by force or deception, and each was killed either by strangulation or shooting with a .22 caliber pistol. Corll and his accomplices buried seventeen of their victims in a rented boat shed; four other victims were buried in woodland near Lake Sam Rayburn, one victim was buried on a beach in Jefferson County, and at least six victims were buried on a beach on the Bolivar Peninsula. Brooks and Henley confessed to assisting Corll in several abductions and murders; both were sentenced to life imprisonment.

Corll was also known as the Candy Man and the [[Pied Piper of Hamelin|Pied Piper]], because he and his family had previously owned and operated a candy factory in Houston Heights, and he had been known to give free candy to local children.

==Early life==

===Childhood===
Dean Arnold Corll was born on December 24, 1939, in Fort Wayne, Indiana, the first child of Mary Emma Robison (1916–2010) and Arnold Edwin Corll (1916–2001). Corll&#x27;s father was strict with his children, whereas his mother was markedly protective of both her sons. Their marriage was marred by frequent quarreling and the couple divorced in 1946, four years after the birth of their younger son, Stanley Wayne Corll. Mary subsequently sold the family home and relocated to a trailer home in Memphis, Tennessee, where Arnold had been drafted into the United States Air Force after the divorce, to allow her sons to remain in contact with their father.

Corll was a shy, serious child who rarely socialized with other children, but at the same time displayed concern for the wellbeing of others. He was also markedly sensitive to any form of criticism or rejection. At the age of seven, he suffered an undiagnosed case of rheumatic fever, which was not recognized until doctors found Corll had a heart murmur in 1950. As a result of this diagnosis, Corll was told to avoid P.E. classes in school.

Corll&#x27;s parents attempted reconciliation and remarried in 1950, subsequently moving to Pasadena, Texas, a suburb of Houston; however, the reconciliation was short lived and, in 1953, the couple once again divorced, with the mother again retaining custody of her two sons. The divorce was granted on amicable grounds and both boys maintained regular contact with their father.

Following the second divorce, Corll&#x27;s mother married a traveling clock salesman named Jake West. The family moved to the small town of Vidor, Texas, where Corll&#x27;s half-sister, Joyce Jeanine (1955–2016), was born. Corll&#x27;s mother and stepfather started a small family candy company, initially operating from the garage of their home. From the earliest days of the business, Corll worked day and night while still attending school. He and his younger brother were responsible for running the candy-making machines and packing the product, which his stepfather sold on his sales route. This route often involved West traveling to Houston, where much of the product was sold.

From 1954 to 1958, Corll attended Vidor High School, where he was regarded as a well-behaved student who achieved satisfactory grades. As had been the case in his childhood, Corll was also considered somewhat of a loner, although he is known to have occasionally dated girls in his teenage years. In high school, Corll&#x27;s only major interest was the brass band, in which he played trombone.
===Move to Houston Heights===
Corll graduated from Vidor High School in the summer of 1958. Shortly thereafter, he and his family moved to the northern outskirts of Houston so that the family candy business could be closer to the city where the majority of their product was sold. Corll&#x27;s family opened a new shop, which they named Pecan Prince in reference to the brand name of the family product. In 1960, at the request of his mother, Corll moved to Yoder, Indiana, to live with his widowed grandmother. During this time, Corll formed a close relationship with a local girl, although he rejected a subsequent marriage proposal she made to him in 1962. Corll lived in Indiana for almost two years but returned to Houston in 1962 to help with his family&#x27;s candy business, which by this date had moved to Houston Heights. He later moved into an apartment of his own above the shop.

Corll&#x27;s mother divorced West in 1963 and opened a new candy business, which she named Corll Candy Company; her eldest son was appointed vice president of the new family firm, with his younger brother Stanley being appointed secretary-treasurer. The same year, one of the teenaged male employees of Corll Candy Company complained to Corll&#x27;s mother that her son had made sexual advances towards him. In response, she fired the teenager.

===U.S. Army service===
Corll was drafted into the United States Army on August 10, 1964, and assigned to Fort Polk, Louisiana, for basic training. He was later assigned to Fort Benning, Georgia, to train as a radio repairman before his permanent assignment to Fort Hood, Texas. According to official military records, Corll&#x27;s period of service in the army was unblemished. Corll, however, reportedly hated military service; he applied for a hardship discharge on the grounds that he was needed in his family&#x27;s business. The army granted his request and he was given an honorable discharge on June 11, 1965, after ten months of service.
Reportedly, Corll divulged to some of his close acquaintances after his release from the army that it was during his period of service that he had first realized that he was homosexual and had experienced his first homosexual encounters. Other acquaintances noted subtle changes in Corll&#x27;s mannerisms when in the company of teenage males after he had completed his service and returned to Houston, which led them to believe he may have been homosexual.

==Corll Candy Company==
Following his honorable discharge from the army, Corll returned to Houston Heights and resumed the position he had held as vice-president of Corll Candy Company. Corll&#x27;s former stepfather had retained ownership of the family&#x27;s former candy business, Pecan Prince, following his divorce from Corll&#x27;s mother in 1963; competition between the two firms was fierce. As had been the case in his teenage years, Corll increased the number of hours he devoted to the candy business to satisfy an increasing public demand for his family&#x27;s product.

In 1965, Corll Candy Company relocated to 22nd Street, directly across the street from Helms Elementary School. Corll was known to give free candy to local children, in particular teenage boys. As a result of this behavior, he earned himself the nicknames of the &quot;Candy Man&quot; and the &quot;Pied Piper.&quot; The company employed a small workforce, and he was seen to behave flirtatiously toward several teenage male employees. Corll is also known to have installed a pool table at the rear of the candy factory where employees and local youths would congregate.

===Relationship with David Brooks===
In 1967, Corll befriended 12-year-old David Owen Brooks, then a sixth grade student and one of the many children to whom he gave free candy. Brooks initially became one of Corll&#x27;s many youthful companions, regularly socializing with Corll and various teenage boys who congregated at the rear of the candy factory. He also joined Corll on the regular trips he took to South Texas beaches in the company of various youths, and later commented that Corll was the first adult male who did not mock his appearance. Whenever Brooks told Corll he needed cash, Corll gave him money, and the youth began to view Corll as a father figure. Upon Corll&#x27;s urging, a sexual relationship gradually developed between the two. Beginning in 1969, Corll paid Brooks in cash or with gifts to allow him to perform fellatio on the youth.

Brooks&#x27;s parents were divorced; his father lived in Houston and his mother had relocated to Beaumont, a city east of Houston. In 1970, when he was 15, Brooks dropped out of Waltrip High School and moved to Beaumont to live with his mother. Whenever he visited his father in Houston, he also visited Corll, who allowed him to stay at his apartment if he wished. Later the same year, Brooks moved back to Houston. By his own later admission, Brooks began regarding Corll&#x27;s apartment as his second home.

By the time Brooks dropped out of high school, Corll&#x27;s mother and his half-sister, Joyce, had moved to Colorado after the failure of her third marriage and the closure of Corll Candy Company in June 1968. Although she often talked to her eldest son on the telephone, his mother never saw him again.

Following the closure of the candy company, Corll took a job as an electrician at the Houston Lighting and Power Company (HL&amp;P), where he tested electrical relay systems. He worked in this employment until the day of his death.

==Murders==
Between 1970 and 1973, Corll is known to have killed a minimum of 28 victims. All of his victims were males aged 13 to 20, the majority of whom were in their mid-teens. Most victims were abducted from Houston Heights, which was then a low-income neighborhood northwest of downtown Houston. In most of these abductions, he was assisted by one or both of his teenage accomplices: David Owen Brooks and Elmer Wayne Henley. Several victims were friends of one or both of Corll&#x27;s accomplices; others were individuals with whom Corll had himself become acquainted prior to their abduction and murder, and two other victims, Billy Baulch and Gregory Malley Winkle, were former employees of Corll Candy Company.

Corll&#x27;s victims were usually lured into either one of the two vehicles he owned (a Ford Econoline van and a Plymouth GTX) or a 1969 Chevrolet Corvette he is known to have purchased for Brooks in early 1971. The enticement was typically an offer of a party or a lift, and the victim would be driven to Corll&#x27;s house. At Corll&#x27;s residence, the youths would be plied with alcohol or other drugs until they passed out, tricked into donning handcuffs, or simply grabbed by force. They were then stripped naked and tied to either Corll&#x27;s bed or, usually, a plywood torture board which was regularly hung on a wall. Once manacled, the victims would be sexually assaulted, beaten, tortured and, sometimes after several days, killed by strangulation or shooting with a .22 caliber pistol. Their bodies were then tied in plastic sheeting and buried in one of four places: a rented boat shed in southwest Houston, a beach on the Bolivar Peninsula, a woodland near Lake Sam Rayburn (where Corll&#x27;s family owned a lakeside log cabin), or a beach in Jefferson County.

In several instances, Corll forced his victims to either phone or write to their parents with explanations for their absences in an effort to allay the parents&#x27; fears for their sons&#x27; safety. He is also known to have retained keepsakes—usually keys—from his victims.

During the years in which he abducted and murdered his victims, Corll often changed addresses. However, until he moved to Pasadena in the spring of 1973, he always lived in or close to Houston Heights.

===First known murders===
Corll killed his first known victim, an 18-year-old college freshman named Jeffrey Konen, on September 25, 1970. Konen vanished while hitchhiking with another student from the University of Texas to his parents&#x27; home in Houston. He was dropped off alone at the corner of Westheimer Road and South Voss Road near the Uptown area of Houston at approximately 6:15p.m. Corll likely offered Konen a lift to his home, which Konen evidently accepted. At the time of Konen&#x27;s disappearance, Corll lived in the Harold Turboff apartments, where he had paid a deposit of a month&#x27;s rent on September 21.

Brooks led police to Konen&#x27;s body on August 10, 1973. The body was buried at High Island Beach. Forensic scientists subsequently deduced that the youth had died of asphyxiation caused by manual strangulation and a cloth gag that had been placed in his mouth. The nude body was found buried beneath a large boulder, covered with a layer of lime, wrapped in plastic, and bound hand and foot with nylon cord, suggesting he had been violated.

Shortly after Konen&#x27;s murder, Brooks interrupted Corll in the act of sexually assaulting two teenage boys whom Corll had strapped to a four-poster bed. Corll promised Brooks a car in return for his silence; Brooks accepted the offer and Corll later bought him a green Chevrolet Corvette. Corll later told Brooks that he had killed the two youths, and offered him $200 (the equivalent of approximately $1,620 ) for any boy he could lure to Corll&#x27;s apartment.

On December 13, 1970, Brooks lured two 14-year-old Spring Branch youths named James Glass and Danny Yates away from a religious rally held in Houston Heights to Corll&#x27;s Yorktown apartment. Glass was an acquaintance of Brooks who, at Brooks&#x27;s behest, had previously visited Corll&#x27;s address. Both youths were tied to opposite sides of Corll&#x27;s torture board and subsequently raped, strangled, and buried in a boat shed he had rented on November 17. An electrical cord with alligator clips attached to each end was buried alongside Yates&#x27;s body.

Six weeks after the double murder of Glass and Yates, on January 30, 1971, Brooks and Corll encountered two teenage brothers, Donald and Jerry Waldrop, walking toward their parents&#x27; home. The Waldrop brothers had been driven to a friend&#x27;s home by their father with plans to discuss forming a bowling league and had begun walking home after learning their friend was not at home. Both boys were enticed into Corll&#x27;s van and driven to an apartment Corll had rented on Mangum Road, where they were raped, strangled and subsequently buried in the boat shed.

Between March and May 1971, Corll abducted and killed three victims, all of whom lived in Houston Heights and all of whom were buried toward the rear of the boat shed. In each of these abductions, Brooks is known to have been a participant. One of these three victims, 15-year-old Randell Harvey, was last seen by his family on the afternoon of March 9 cycling towards Oak Forest, where he worked part-time as a gas station attendant. Harvey was driven to Corll&#x27;s Mangum Road apartment, where he was subsequently killed by a single gunshot to the head. The other two victims, 13-year-old David Hilligiest and 16-year-old Gregory Malley Winkle, were abducted and killed together on the afternoon of May 29; both were murdered at an apartment Corll rented on West 11th Street.

As had been the case with parents of other victims of Corll, both sets of parents launched a frantic search for their sons. One of the youths who voluntarily offered to distribute posters the parents had printed offering a monetary reward for information leading to the boys&#x27; whereabouts was 15-year-old Elmer Wayne Henley—a lifelong friend of Hilligiest. The youth pinned the reward posters around the Heights and attempted to reassure Hilligiest&#x27;s parents that there might be an innocent explanation for the boys&#x27; absence.

On August 17, 1971, Corll and Brooks encountered a 17-year-old acquaintance of Brooks named Ruben Watson Haney walking home from a movie theater in Houston. Brooks persuaded Haney to attend a party at an address Corll had moved to on San Felipe Street the previous month. Haney agreed and was taken to Corll&#x27;s home where he was subsequently strangled and buried in the boat shed.

In September 1971, Corll moved to an apartment on Columbia Street. This address was also located in the Heights. Brooks later stated he had assisted Corll in the abduction and murder of two youths during the time Corll resided at this address, including one youth who was killed &quot;just before Wayne Henley came into the picture.&quot; In his confession, Brooks stated the youth killed immediately prior to Henley&#x27;s involvement in the murders was abducted from the Heights and kept alive for approximately four days before his murder. The identities of both of these victims remain unknown.

===Participation of Elmer Wayne Henley===
In the winter of 1971, Brooks encountered Wayne Henley; he later introduced him to Corll. Henley likely was lured to Corll&#x27;s address as an intended victim. However, Corll evidently decided the youth would make a good accomplice and offered him the same fee of $200 for any boy he could lure to his apartment, informing Henley that he was involved in a &quot;white slavery ring&quot; operating from Dallas.

Henley later stated that, for several months, he ignored Corll&#x27;s offer, although he did maintain an acquaintance with Corll and gradually began to view him as something of a &quot;brother-type person&quot; whose work ethic he admired and in whom he could confide. In early 1972, he decided to accept Corll&#x27;s offer because he and his family were in dire financial circumstances. Henley said the first abduction he participated in occurred during the time Corll resided at 925 Schuler Street, an address he moved to on February 19. (Brooks later claimed that Henley became involved in the abductions while Corll resided at the address he had occupied immediately prior to Schuler Street.) If Henley&#x27;s statement is to be believed, the victim was abducted from the Heights in February or early March 1972. In the statement Henley gave to police following his arrest, the youth stated he and Corll picked up &quot;a boy&quot; at the corner of 11th and Studewood, and lured him to Corll&#x27;s home on the promise of smoking some marijuana with the pair. At Corll&#x27;s residence—using a ruse he and Corll had prepared—Henley cuffed his own hands behind his back, freed himself with a key hidden in his back pocket, then duped the youth into donning the handcuffs before observing Corll bind and gag him. Henley then left the youth alone with Corll, believing he was to be sold into the sexual slavery ring. The identity of this first victim Henley assisted in the abduction of remains unknown.&lt;ref name=&quot;Henley vs. State 09/16/82&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

One month later, on March 24, 1972, Henley, Brooks, and Corll encountered an 18-year-old acquaintance of Henley&#x27;s named Frank Aguirre leaving a restaurant on Yale Street, where the youth worked. Henley called Aguirre over to Corll&#x27;s van and invited the youth to drink beer and smoke marijuana with the trio at Corll&#x27;s apartment. Aguirre agreed and followed the trio to Corll&#x27;s home in his Rambler. Inside Corll&#x27;s house, Aguirre smoked marijuana with the trio before picking up a pair of handcuffs Corll had left on his table. In response, Corll pounced on Aguirre, pushed him onto the table, and cuffed his hands behind his back.

Henley later claimed that he had not known of Corll&#x27;s true intentions towards Aguirre when he had persuaded his friend to accompany him to Corll&#x27;s home. In a 2010 interview, he claimed to have attempted to persuade Corll not to assault and kill Aguirre once Corll and Brooks had bound and gagged the youth. However, Corll refused, informing Henley that he had raped, tortured, and killed the previous victim he had assisted in abducting, and that he intended to do the same with Aguirre. Henley subsequently assisted Corll and Brooks in Aguirre&#x27;s burial at High Island Beach.

Despite the revelations that Corll was, in reality, killing the boys that he and Brooks had assisted in abducting, Henley nonetheless became an active participant in the abductions and murders. One month later, on April 20, he assisted Corll and Brooks in the abduction of another youth, 17-year-old Mark Scott. Scott—who was well known to Corll, Henley and Brooks—was specifically chosen by Corll to be his next victim as, according to Henley, he had recently &quot;cheated [Corll] on a deal&quot; relating to stolen property. He was grabbed by force and fought furiously against attempts by Corll to restrain him, even attempting to stab Corll with a knife after several hours of abuse and torture including burning with incense cones. However, Scott saw Henley pointing a pistol toward him and according to Brooks, Scott &quot;just gave up.&quot; Scott ultimately suffered the same fate as Aguirre: rape, torture, strangulation, and burial at High Island Beach.

Brooks later stated Henley was &quot;especially sadistic&quot; in his participation in the murders committed at Schuler Street and Henley later admitted to gradually becoming &quot;fascinated&quot; with &quot;how much stamina people have&quot; when subjected to the act of murder. Before Corll vacated the address on June 26, Henley assisted Corll and Brooks in the abduction and murder of two youths named Billy Baulch and Johnny Delome. In Brooks&#x27;s confession, he stated that both youths were tied to Corll&#x27;s bed and, after their torture and rape, Henley manually strangled Baulch, then shouted, &quot;Hey, Johnny!&quot; and shot Delome in the forehead, with the bullet exiting through the youth&#x27;s ear. Delome then pleaded with Henley, &quot;Wayne, please don&#x27;t!&quot; before he was strangled. Both youths were buried at High Island Beach.

During the time Corll resided at Schuler Street, the trio lured a 19-year-old named William Ridinger to the house. Ridinger was initially tied to hooks drilled upon the wall of the property and, later, the plywood board, where he was tortured and abused by Corll over the course of approximately three days. Brooks later claimed he persuaded Corll to allow Ridinger to be released, and the youth was allowed to leave the residence. On another occasion during the time Corll resided at Schuler Street, Henley knocked Brooks unconscious as he entered the house. Corll then tied Brooks to his bed and assaulted the youth repeatedly before releasing him. Despite the assault, Brooks continued to assist Corll in the abductions of the victims.

After vacating the Schuler Street residence, Corll moved to an apartment at Westcott Towers, where, in the summer of 1972, he is known to have killed a further two victims. The first of these victims, 17-year-old Steven Sickman, was last seen leaving a party held in the Heights shortly before midnight on July 19. The youth was savagely bludgeoned about the chest with a blunt instrument before he was strangled and buried in the boat shed. Approximately one month later, on or about August 21, 19-year-old Roy Bunton was abducted while walking to his job as an assistant in a Houston shoe store. Bunton was gagged with a section of Turkish towel and his mouth bound with adhesive tape. He was shot twice in the head and buried in the boat shed. Neither youth was named by either Brooks or Henley as being a victim of Corll, and both youths were identified as victims only in 2011.

On October 3, 1972, Henley and Brooks encountered two Heights teenagers, Wally Jay Simoneaux and Richard Hembree, walking to Hembree&#x27;s home. Simoneaux and Hembree were enticed into Brooks&#x27;s Corvette and driven to Corll&#x27;s Westcott Towers apartment. That evening, Simoneaux is known to have phoned his mother&#x27;s home and to have shouted the word &quot;Mama&quot; into the receiver before the connection was terminated. The following morning, Hembree was accidentally shot in the mouth by Henley, with the bullet exiting through his neck. Several hours later, both youths were strangled to death and subsequently buried in a common grave inside the boat shed directly above the bodies of James Glass and Danny Yates. Sometime in November 1972, 18-year-old Willard Branch, an Oak Forest youth known to both Corll and Henley, disappeared while hitchhiking from Mount Pleasant to Houston. His gagged and emasculated body was buried in the boat shed. On November 11, a 19-year-old Spring Branch youth named Richard Kepner disappeared on his way to a phone booth. Kepner was strangled and buried at High Island Beach. Altogether, at least ten teenagers between the ages of 13 and 19 were murdered between March and November 1972, five of whom were buried at High Island Beach, and five inside the boat shed.

On January 20, 1973, Corll moved to an address on Wirt Road in the Spring Branch district of Houston. Within two weeks of moving into this address, he had killed 17-year-old Joseph Lyles. Lyles was known to both Corll and Brooks. He had lived on Antoine Drive—the same street upon which Brooks resided in early 1973. On March 1, Corll vacated his Wirt Road apartment; he briefly resided in an apartment on South Post Oak Road before moving to 2020 Lamar Drive, an address his father had vacated in Pasadena.

===2020 Lamar Drive===
No known victims were killed between February 1 and June 4, 1973. Corll is known to have suffered from a hydrocele in early 1973, which may have contributed to this period of inactivity. In addition, around the time of Lyles&#x27;s murder, Henley spontaneously traveled to Florida with a long-haul truck driver uncle before temporarily relocating to Mount Pleasant in an apparent effort to distance himself from Corll. These facts may account for this sudden lull in killings.

Nonetheless, from June, Corll&#x27;s rate of killings increased dramatically, and both Henley and Brooks later testified to the increase in the level of brutality of the murders committed while Corll resided at Lamar Drive. Henley later compared Corll&#x27;s escalation to being &quot;like a blood lust&quot;, adding that he and Brooks would instinctively know when Corll was to announce that he &quot;needed to do a new boy,&quot; due to the fact that he would appear restless, smoking cigarettes and making reflex movements.

On June 4, Corll and Henley abducted 15-year-old William Ray Lawrence; the youth was last seen alive by his father on 31st Street. After three days of abuse and torture, Lawrence was strangled before being buried at Lake Sam Rayburn. Less than two weeks later, 20-year-old Raymond Stanley Blackburn was abducted, strangled, and buried at Lake Sam Rayburn.
On July 6, 1973, Henley began attending classes at the Coaches Driving School in Bellaire, where he became acquainted with 15-year-old Homer Luis Garcia. The following day, Garcia telephoned his mother to say he was spending the night with a friend; he was shot and left to bleed to death in Corll&#x27;s bathtub before he was buried at Lake Sam Rayburn. Five days later, on July 12, 17-year-old John Sellars of Orange County was bound, shot to death and buried at High Island Beach.

In July 1973, after Brooks married his pregnant fiancée, Henley temporarily became Corll&#x27;s sole procurer of victims, assisting in the abduction and murder of three Heights youths between July 19 and 25. Henley claimed these three abductions were the only three that occurred after his becoming an accomplice to Corll in which Brooks was not a participant. One of these three victims, 15-year-old Michael Baulch, brother of previous victim Billy Baulch, was last seen by his family on July 19 on his way to get a haircut; he was strangled and buried at Lake Sam Rayburn. The other two victims, Charles Cobble and Marty Ray Jones, were abducted together on the afternoon of July 25. Henley himself later buried both youths&#x27; bodies in the boat shed.

On August 3, 1973, Corll killed his last victim, a 13-year-old boy from South Houston named James Stanton Dreymala. Dreymala was abducted by Corll while riding his bike in Pasadena and driven to Lamar Drive upon the pretense of collecting empty glass bottles to resell. At Corll&#x27;s home, Dreymala was tied to Corll&#x27;s torture board, raped, tortured, and strangled with a cord before being buried in the boat shed. Brooks later described Dreymala as a &quot;small, blond boy&quot; for whom he had bought a pizza and in whose company he had spent forty-five minutes at Corll&#x27;s home before the youth was attacked.

==August 8, 1973==
On the evening of August 7, 1973, Henley invited 20-year-old Timothy Cordell Kerley to attend a party at Corll&#x27;s Pasadena residence. Kerley—a casual acquaintance of Corll who was intended to be his next victim—accepted the offer. Brooks was not present at the time. The two youths arrived at Corll&#x27;s house, where they sniffed paint fumes and drank alcohol until midnight before leaving the house, promising to return shortly. Henley and Kerley then drove back to Houston Heights and Kerley parked his vehicle close to Henley&#x27;s home. The two exited the vehicle and Henley, hearing commotion across the street emanating from the home of his 15-year-old friend Rhonda Louise Williams, walked toward her home. Williams—nursing a sprained ankle—had been beaten by her drunken father that evening and accepted Henley&#x27;s invitation to join him and Kerley at Corll&#x27;s home. Williams climbed into the back seat of Kerley&#x27;s Volkswagen. The trio then drove toward Corll&#x27;s Pasadena residence.

At approximately 3:00a.m. on the morning of August 8, Henley and Kerley, accompanied by Williams, returned to Corll&#x27;s residence. Corll was furious that Henley had brought a girl to his house, telling him in private that he had &quot;ruined everything&quot;. Henley explained that Williams had argued with her father that evening, and did not wish to return home. Corll appeared to calm down and offered the trio beer and marijuana. The three teenagers began drinking and smoking marijuana, with Henley and Kerley also sniffing paint fumes as Corll watched them intently. After approximately two hours, Henley, Kerley, and Williams each passed out.

===Final confrontation===
Henley awoke to find himself lying on his stomach and Corll snapping handcuffs onto his wrists. His mouth had been taped shut and his ankles had been bound together. Kerley and Williams lay beside Henley, securely bound with nylon rope, gagged with adhesive tape, and lying face down on the floor. Kerley had been stripped naked.

Noting Henley had awoken, Corll removed the gag from his mouth. Henley protested in vain against Corll&#x27;s actions, whereupon Corll reiterated that he was angry with Henley for bringing a girl to his house and that he intended to kill all three after he had assaulted and tortured Kerley, initially saying, &quot;Man, you blew it bringing that girl,&quot; before shouting: &quot;I&#x27;m gonna kill you all! But first I&#x27;m gonna have my fun!&quot; He then repeatedly kicked Williams in the chest before placing a transistor radio between her and Kerley and turning the volume to maximum.

Corll then lifted Henley to his feet and dragged him into his kitchen and placed a .22-caliber pistol against his stomach, threatening to shoot him. Henley calmed Corll, promising to participate in the torture and murder of both Williams and Kerley if Corll released him. After approximately thirty minutes of discussion, Corll agreed and untied Henley, then carried Kerley and Williams into his bedroom and tied them to opposite sides of his torture board: Kerley on his stomach; Williams on her back. He then removed the adhesive tape from Kerley&#x27;s mouth before informing him of his intentions to &quot;look up&quot; his anus as Henley again began inhaling paint fumes from a paper bag.

Corll then handed Henley a hunting knife and ordered him to cut away Williams&#x27;s clothes, insisting that, while he would rape and kill Kerley, Henley would do likewise to Williams. Henley began cutting away Williams&#x27;s clothes as Corll undressed and began to assault and torture Kerley. Both Kerley and Williams had awakened by this point. Kerley began writhing and shouting as Williams, whose gag Henley had removed, lifted her head and asked Henley, &quot;Is this for real?&quot; to which Henley answered, &quot;Yes.&quot; Williams then asked Henley: &quot;Are you going to do anything about it?&quot;

===Corll&#x27;s death===
Henley then asked Corll whether he might take Williams into another room. Corll ignored him and Henley then grabbed Corll&#x27;s pistol, shouting, &quot;You&#x27;ve gone far enough, Dean!&quot; As Corll clambered off Kerley, Henley elaborated: &quot;I can&#x27;t go on any longer! I can&#x27;t have you kill all my friends!&quot; Corll approached Henley, saying, &quot;Kill me, Wayne!&quot; Henley stepped back a few paces as Corll continued to advance upon him, shouting, &quot;You won&#x27;t do it!&quot; Henley then fired at Corll, hitting him in the forehead. The bullet failed to fully penetrate Corll&#x27;s skull and he continued to lurch toward Henley, whereupon the youth fired another two rounds, hitting Corll in the left shoulder. Corll then ran out of the room, trapping his right foot in a loose telephone wire and hitting the wall of the hallway. Henley fired three additional bullets into his lower back and shoulder as Corll slid down the wall in the hallway outside the room where the two other teenagers were bound. Corll died where he fell, his naked body facing the wall.

Henley would recall that immediately after he shot Corll, the sole thought in his mind was that Corll would have been proud of the way he had behaved during the confrontation, adding that Corll had been training him to react quickly and forcefully and that this was exactly what he had done.
After Henley had shot Corll, he and Kerley began weeping as Kerley repeatedly thanked him for saving his life. Henley then released Kerley and Williams from the torture board, and all three teenagers dressed and discussed what actions they should take. Henley suggested to Kerley and Williams that they should simply leave, to which Kerley replied, &quot;No, we should call the police.&quot; Henley agreed and looked up the number for the Pasadena Police Department (PPD) in Corll&#x27;s telephone directory.

==Contacting police==
At 8:24 a.m. on August 8, 1973, Henley placed a call to the PPD. His call was answered by an operator named Velma Lines. In his call, Henley blurted to the operator: &quot;Y&#x27;all better come here right now! I just killed a man!&quot; Henley gave the address to the operator as 2020 Lamar Drive, Pasadena. As Kerley, Williams, and Henley waited outside Corll&#x27;s home for the police to arrive, Henley mentioned to Kerley that he had &quot;done that (killing by shooting) four or five times.&quot;

Minutes later, a PPD patrol car arrived at 2020 Lamar Drive. The three were sitting on the curb outside the house, and the officer noted the .22 caliber pistol on the driveway near the trio. Two of the three were weeping; the older male simply stared blankly across the street. The younger male identified himself as Elmer Wayne Henley and told the officer that he was the individual who had made the call and indicated that Corll&#x27;s body was inside the house. After confiscating the pistol and placing Henley, Williams, and Kerley inside the patrol car, the officer entered the bungalow and discovered Corll&#x27;s body inside the hallway. The officer returned to the car and read Henley his &quot;Miranda&quot; rights. In response, Henley shouted: &quot;I don&#x27;t care who knows about it! I have to get it off my chest!&quot;

Kerley later told detectives that before the police officer had arrived at Lamar Drive, Henley had informed him, &quot;If you wasn&#x27;t my friend, I could have gotten $200 for you.&quot;

===Accomplices&#x27; confessions===
In PPD custody, Henley was initially questioned about the killing of Corll. He recounted the events of the previous evening and that morning, explaining that he had shot Corll in self-defense. The statements given by Kerley and Williams corroborated Henley&#x27;s account, and the detective questioning Henley believed he had indeed acted in self-defense.

When questioned regarding his claim that as Corll had threatened him that morning he had shouted that he had killed several boys, Henley explained that for almost three years, Brooks and he had helped procure teenage boys, some of whom had been their own friends, for Corll, who had raped and murdered them. Henley gave a verbal statement; stating he initially had believed the boys he had abducted were to be sold into a Dallas-based organization for &quot;homosexual acts, sodomy, maybe later killing,&quot; but soon learned Corll was himself killing the victims procured. Henley admitted he had assisted Corll in several abductions and murders, and that he had actively participated in the torture and mutilation of &quot;six or eight&quot; victims prior to their murder. Most victims had been buried in a Southwest Houston boat shed, with others buried at Lake Sam Rayburn and High Island Beach. Corll had paid up to $200 for each victim Brooks or he were able to lure to his apartment.

Police initially were skeptical of Henley&#x27;s claims, assuming the sole homicide of the case was that of Corll, which they had ascribed as being the result of drug-fueled fisticuffs that had turned deadly. Henley was quite insistent, however, and upon his recalling the names of three boys—Cobble, Hilligiest, and Jones—whom he stated he and Brooks had procured for Corll, the police accepted that there was something to his claims, as all three teenagers were listed as missing at Houston Police Department (HPD) headquarters. Hilligiest had been reported missing in the summer of 1971; the other two boys had been missing for just two weeks. Moreover, the floor of the room where the three teenagers had been tied was covered in thick plastic sheeting. Police also found a plywood torture board measuring with handcuffs attached to nylon rope at two corners, and nylon ropes to the other two. Also found at Corll&#x27;s address were a large hunting knife, rolls of clear plastic of the same type used to cover the floor, a portable radio rigged to a pair of dry cells to give increased volume, an electric motor with loose wires attached, eight pairs of handcuffs, a number of dildos, thin glass tubes, and lengths of rope.

Corll&#x27;s Ford Econoline van parked in the driveway conveyed a similar impression. The rear windows of the van were sealed by opaque blue curtains. In the rear of the vehicle, police found a coil of rope, a swatch of beige rug covered in soil stains, and a wooden crate with air holes drilled in the sides. The pegboard walls inside the rear of the van were rigged with several rings and hooks. Another wooden crate with air holes drilled in the sides was found in Corll&#x27;s backyard. Inside this crate were several strands of human hair.
==Search for victims==
Henley agreed to accompany police to Corll&#x27;s boat shed in Southwest Houston, where he claimed the bodies of several victims could be found. Inside the boat shed, police found a half-stripped stolen Chevrolet Camaro, a child&#x27;s bike, a large iron drum, water containers, two sacks of lime, two shovels, a broken rake, and a large plastic bag full of teenage boys&#x27; clothing.

Two prison trusties began digging through the soft, crushed-shell earth of the boat shed and soon uncovered the body of a blond-haired teenaged boy, lying on his side, encased in clear plastic and buried beneath a layer of lime. Police continued excavating through the earth of the shed, unearthing the remains of more victims in varying stages of decomposition. Most of the bodies found were wrapped in thick, clear plastic sheeting. Some victims had been shot, others strangled, the ligatures still wrapped tightly around their necks.

All of the victims found had been sodomized and most victims found bore evidence of sexual torture: pubic hairs had been plucked out, genitals had been chewed, objects had been inserted into their rectums, and glass rods had been inserted into their urethrae and smashed. Cloth rags had also been inserted into the victims&#x27; mouths and adhesive tape wound around their faces to muffle their screams. The tongue of the first victim uncovered protruded over one inch beyond the tooth margin; the mouth of the third victim unearthed on August 8 was so agape that all upper and lower teeth were visible, leading investigators to theorize the youth had died screaming. After the recovery of the eighth body from the boat shed was completed at 11:55 p.m., the search for further bodies was discontinued until the next day.

Accompanied by his father, Brooks presented himself at HPD headquarters on the evening of August 8 and gave a statement in which he denied any knowledge of or participation in the murders but admitted to having known that Corll had raped and killed two teenagers in 1970 and naming two youths—Ruben Haney and Mark Scott—whom he had seen in Corll&#x27;s company immediately before their disappearances.

On the morning of August 9, Henley gave a full written statement detailing his and Brooks&#x27;s involvement with Corll in the abduction and murder of numerous youths. In this confession, Henley readily admitted to having personally killed approximately nine youths and to have assisted Corll in the strangulation of others. He stated the &quot;only three&quot; abductions and murders Brooks had not assisted him and Corll with were committed in the summer of 1973. That afternoon, Henley accompanied police to Lake Sam Rayburn, where he, Brooks, and Corll had buried four victims killed that year. Two additional bodies were found in shallow, lime-soaked graves located close to a dirt road. Inside the lakeside log cabin owned by Corll&#x27;s family, police found a second plywood torture board, rolls of plastic sheeting, shovels, and a sack of lime.

Police found nine additional bodies in the boat shed on August 9. These bodies were recovered between 12:05p.m. and 8:30p.m., and all were in an advanced state of decomposition. The twelfth body unearthed bore evidence of sexual mutilation (the severed genitals of the victim were found inside a sealed plastic bag placed beside the body); another victim unearthed had several fractured ribs. The thirteenth and fourteenth bodies unearthed bore identification cards naming the victims as Donald and Jerry Waldrop.

Brooks gave a full confession on the afternoon of August 9, admitting to being present at several killings and assisting in several burials, although he continued to deny any direct participation in the murders. In reference to the torture board upon which Corll had restrained and tortured his victims, Brooks stated: &quot;Once they were on the board, they were as good as dead; it was all over, but the shouting and the crying.&quot; In reference to the actual murders, Brooks stated his witnessing the victims&#x27; deaths &quot;didn&#x27;t bother [him]&quot;, adding &quot;I saw it done many times.&quot; He agreed to accompany police to High Island Beach to assist in the search for the bodies of the victims.

On August 10, 1973, Henley again accompanied police to Lake Sam Rayburn, where two more bodies were found buried just apart. As with the two bodies found the previous day, both victims had been tortured and severely beaten, particularly around the head. That afternoon, both Henley and Brooks accompanied police to High Island Beach, leading police to the shallow graves of two victims. On August 13, both Henley and Brooks again accompanied the police to High Island Beach, where four more bodies were found, making a total of 27 known victims – the worst killing spree in American history at the time. Henley initially insisted that there were two more bodies to be found inside the boat shed and that the bodies of two more boys had been buried at High Island Beach in 1972.

At the time, the killing spree was the worst case of serial murder, in terms of the number of victims, in the United States, exceeding the 25 murders attributed to Juan Corona, who had been arrested in California in 1971 for killing 25 men. The macabre record number of known victims attributed to a single murder case set by Corll and his accomplices was surpassed only in 1978 by John Wayne Gacy, who murdered 33 boys and young men and who admitted to being influenced by press coverage of the Houston Mass Murders to manacle his victims prior to their abuse and murder.

Families of Corll&#x27;s victims were highly critical of the HPD, which had been quick to list the missing boys as runaways who had not been considered worthy of any major investigation. The families of the murdered youths asserted that the police should have noted an insidious trend in the pattern of disappearances of teenage boys from the Heights neighborhood; other family members complained the HPD had been dismissive of their adamant insistence that their sons had no reason to run away from home. Everett Waldrop, the father of Donald and Jerry Waldrop, complained that shortly after his sons had disappeared in 1971, he had informed police an acquaintance had observed Corll burying what appeared to be bodies at his boat shed. In response, the police performed a perfunctory search around the boat shed, before dismissing the reports as a hoax. Waldrop stated that on one of the many occasions when he visited the HPD, the police chief had simply told him, &quot;Why are you down here? You know your boys are runaways.&quot; The mother of Gregory Malley Winkle stated: &quot;You don&#x27;t run away (from home) with nothing but a bathing suit and 80 cents.&quot;

By May 1974, 21 of Corll&#x27;s victims had been identified, with all but four of the youths having either lived in or had close connections to Houston Heights. Two more teenagers were identified in 1983 and 1985; one of whom, Richard Kepner, had originally lived in Humble, Texas, but had relocated to Spring Branch shortly before his disappearance. The other youth, Willard Branch, lived in the Oak Forest district of Houston.

==Indictment==
On August 13, a grand jury convened in Harris County to hear evidence against Henley and Brooks: the first witnesses to testify were Williams and Kerley, who testified to the events of August 7 and 8 leading to the death of Corll. Another witness who testified to his experience at the hands of Corll was William Ridinger, who recounted his abuse at Corll&#x27;s Schuler Street address before he was released. Also to testify at the hearing were the investigators who recounted the various statements and confessions provided by Henley and Brooks in the days following Corll&#x27;s death and individuals tasked with supervising the exhumation of the victims&#x27; bodies.

After listening to over six hours of testimony, on August 14, the grand jury indicted Henley on three counts of murder and Brooks on one count. Bail for each youth was set at $100,000. Henley was not charged with the death of Corll, which prosecutors would ultimately rule on September 18 had been committed in self-defense.

By the time the grand jury had completed its investigation, Henley had been indicted for six murders, and Brooks for four. Both would later reject pretrial offers presented to them by Assistant District Attorney Don Lambright of life sentences in exchange for pleas of guilty to the murders for which they had been indicted. A pretrial motion that Henley undergo a psychiatric examination to determine whether he was mentally competent to stand trial was also opposed by his attorney, Charles Melder, upon the grounds the ruling would violate Henley&#x27;s constitutional rights.

==Trials and convictions==

===Henley===
Elmer Wayne Henley and David Owen Brooks were tried separately for their roles in the murders. Henley was brought to trial before Judge Preston Dial in San Antonio on July 1, 1974, charged with six murders committed between March 1972 and July 1973. Upon advice from his defense counsel, Henley did not take the stand to testify. His attorney, William Gray, did cross-examine several witnesses, but did not call any witnesses or experts for the defense.

The prosecution called twenty-four witnesses, including Kerley and Ridinger, and introduced eighty-two pieces of evidence, including Corll&#x27;s torture board and one of the boxes used to transport the victims. Inside the box, police had found hair which examiners testified came from both Cobble and Henley.

Other incriminating testimony came from police officers who read from Henley&#x27;s written statements. In one part of his confession, Henley had described luring two of the victims for whose murder he had been brought to trial, Cobble and Jones, to Corll&#x27;s Pasadena residence. Henley had confessed that after their initial abuse and torture at Corll&#x27;s home, Cobble and Jones each had one wrist and ankle bound to the same side of Corll&#x27;s torture board. The youths were then forced by Corll to fight each other with the promise that the one who beat the other to death would be allowed to live. After they had spent several hours beating each other, Jones was tied to a board and forced to watch Cobble again be assaulted, tortured, and shot to death before he himself was again raped, tortured, and strangled with a Venetian blind cord. Cobble and Jones were killed on July 27, 1973, two days after they had been reported missing. Several victims&#x27; parents had to leave the courtroom to regain their composure as police and medical examiners described how their relatives were tortured and murdered.

On July 15, 1974, both counsels presented their closing arguments to the jury: the prosecution seeking life imprisonment; the defense a verdict of not guilty. In his closing argument to the jury, District Attorney Carol Vance apologized for his not being able to seek the death penalty, adding that the case was the &quot;most extreme example of man&#x27;s inhumanity to man I have ever seen.&quot;

The jury deliberated for 92 minutes before finding Henley guilty of all six murders for which he was tried. The following day, July 16, formal procedures to sentence Henley for the six guilty verdicts began, and on August 8, Judge Preston Dial ordered that Henley serve each 99-year sentence consecutively (totaling 594 years), and he was transferred to the Huntsville Unit to formally begin his sentence.

Henley appealed his sentence and conviction, contending the jury in his initial trial had not been sequestered, that his attorneys&#x27; objections to news media being present in the courtroom had been overruled, and citing that his defense team&#x27;s attempts to present evidence contending that the initial trial should not have been held in San Antonio had also been overruled by the judge. Henley&#x27;s appeal was upheld and he was awarded a retrial in December 1978.

Henley&#x27;s retrial began on June 18, 1979. This second trial was held in Corpus Christi, with Henley again represented by defense attorneys William Gray and Edwin Pegelow. Henley&#x27;s attorneys again attempted to have Henley&#x27;s written statements ruled inadmissible. However, Judge Noah Kennedy ruled the written statements given by Henley on August 9, 1973, as admissible evidence. The retrial lasted nine days, with Henley&#x27;s attorneys again calling no defense witnesses and again attacking the credibility of Henley&#x27;s written confession. The defense also contended the evidence provided by the state &quot;belonged to Dean Corll, not Elmer Wayne Henley&quot;. On June 27, 1979, the jury deliberated for over two hours before reaching their verdict; Henley was again convicted of six murders and again sentenced to six 99-year terms, only to run concurrently this time rather than consecutively.

===Brooks===
Brooks was brought to trial on February 27, 1975. He had been indicted for four murders committed between December 1970 and June 1973, but was brought to trial charged only with the June 1973 murder of 15-year-old William Ray Lawrence.

Brooks&#x27;s defense attorney, Jim Skelton, argued that his client had not committed any murders and attempted to portray Corll and, to a lesser degree, Henley as being the active participants in the actual killings. Assistant District Attorney Tommy Dunn dismissed the defense&#x27;s contention outright, at one point telling the jury: &quot;This defendant was in on this killing, this murderous rampage, from the very beginning. He tells you he was a cheerleader if nothing else. That&#x27;s what he was telling you about his presence. You know he was in on it.&quot;

Brooks&#x27;s trial lasted less than one week. The jury deliberated for just 90 minutes before they reached a verdict. He was found guilty of Lawrence&#x27;s murder on March 4, 1975, and sentenced to life imprisonment. Brooks showed no emotion as the sentence was passed, although his wife burst into tears. Brooks also appealed his sentence, contending that the signed confessions used against him were taken without his being informed of his legal rights, but his appeal was dismissed in May 1979.

==Incarceration==
Henley is serving his life sentence at the Mark Stiles Unit in Jefferson County, Texas. Successive parole applications dating from July 1980 have been denied. He is next eligible for parole in October 2025.

Brooks served his life sentence at the Terrell Unit near Rosharon, Texas. He died of COVID-19-related complications at a Galveston hospital on May 28, 2020, at the age of 65.

Brooks is buried at Captain Joe Byrd Cemetery in Walker County.

==Victims==
Corll and his accomplices are known to have killed a minimum of 28 teenagers and young men between September 1970 and August 1973, although it is suspected that the true number of victims is higher. As Corll was killed immediately prior to his murders being discovered, the true number of victims he had claimed will never be known. Twenty-seven of Corll&#x27;s known victims have been identified, and the identity of a 28th victim whose body has never been found, Mark Scott, is conclusively known. All of these victims were killed by either shooting, strangulation or a combination of both.

* July 7: Homer Luis Garcia, 15. Met Henley while both youths were enrolled at a Bellaire driving school. He was shot in the head and chest and left to bleed to death in Corll&#x27;s bathtub before being buried at Lake Sam Rayburn.
* July 12: John Manning Sellars, 17. An Orange County youth killed two days before his 18th birthday. Sellars was killed by four gunshots to the chest and buried at High Island Beach. He was the only victim to be buried fully clothed.
* July 19: Michael Anthony Baulch, 15. Corll had killed his older brother, Billy, the previous year. He was strangled and buried at Lake Sam Rayburn. Remains identified September 2010.
* July 25: Marty Ray Jones, 18. Jones was last seen along with his friend and roommate, Charles Cobble, walking along 27th Street in the company of Henley. He was strangled with a Venetian blind cord and buried in the boat shed.
* July 25: Charles Cary Cobble, 17. A school friend of Henley whose wife was pregnant at the time of his murder; Cobble last phoned his father in a state of hysteria claiming he and Jones had been kidnapped by drug dealers. His body, shot twice in the head, was found in the boat shed.

* August 3: James Stanton Dreymala, 13. The son of Seventh-day Adventists, Dreymala was last seen riding his bike in Pasadena. He last called his parents to tell them he was at &quot;a party&quot; across town. He was strangled and buried in the boat shed.

Footnotes
* At Henley&#x27;s trial in 1974, Harris County medical examiner Joseph Jachimczyk raised questions as to whether John Sellars was actually a victim of Corll. Sellars, a U.S. Marine who had been reported missing on July 12, 1973, had been killed by four gunshot wounds to the chest fired from a rifle, whereas all of Corll&#x27;s other known victims had been either shot with the same pistol that Henley had used to kill Corll, strangled, or both. Moreover, Sellars&#x27;s car had been found burned-out in Starks, Louisiana, one week after Sellars had disappeared.
* Police had been led to Sellars&#x27;s body on August 13, 1973, by a trucker who recalled conversing with a youth he believed to be Henley after he had seen a car stuck in the sand close to where Sellars&#x27;s body was subsequently found. The youth had rebuffed the trucker&#x27;s offer to help free the car, stating he had two friends with him who would free the vehicle. Neither Henley nor Brooks specifically mentioned Sellars being a victim of Corll&#x27;s in their confessions, nor have they disputed his being a victim. The official tally of victims was reduced to 26 in 1974 after Dr. Jachimczyk testified Sellars &quot;probably was not&quot; murdered by Corll and his accomplices. However, Sellars was of the same age as Corll&#x27;s known victims and his grave on High Island Beach was close to where confirmed victims of Corll were buried. In addition, his body was found bound hand and foot with rope as other victims had been, and Sellars&#x27;s autopsy report indicates a possibility of his being sexually assaulted prior to or after death.

===Forensic developments===
In June 2008, Dr. Sharon Derrick, a forensic anthropologist with the medical examiner&#x27;s office in Houston, released digital images of Corll&#x27;s three still-unidentified victims. These victims were listed as ML73-3349, ML73-3356 and ML73-3378. Two of the unidentified victims were found buried in the boat shed and were estimated to have been killed in 1971 or 1972. ML73-3378 was buried at Lake Sam Rayburn just from the body of Homer Garcia, who had disappeared on July 7, 1973.

On October 17, 2008, ML73-3349 was identified as Randell Lee Harvey, a Heights teenager who had been reported missing on March 11, 1971 – two days after he had disappeared. Harvey, who had been shot through the eye, was wearing a navy blue jacket with red lining, jeans and lace-up boots. A plastic orange pocket comb was also found alongside his body.

A body found on a beach in Jefferson County on August 4, 1983, has been conclusively linked to Corll. The scattered skeletal remains were discovered within and close to plastic sheeting near an eroding sandbank, along with sections of rope. These remains were listed as ML83-6849. The body was identified November 11, 2009, through DNA analysis as 17-year-old Joseph Lyles, a Heights teenager who had disappeared on February 1, 1973. Lyles is known to have both visited Corll&#x27;s apartment and to have lived on the same street as Brooks. He was listed as a possible victim of Corll after the other murders were discovered in 1973. At the time of his disappearance, Corll resided in an apartment at 1855 Wirt Road, where he lived between January 20 and March 1, 1973, when he moved to his father&#x27;s Pasadena bungalow. Brooks had specifically stated Corll had &quot;got one boy by himself&quot; during the time he lived at this address. In addition, at the time that Lyles disappeared, Henley had temporarily moved to Mount Pleasant, which leaves a strong possibility that Corll had killed Lyles without the assistance of Henley.
On September 13, 2010, DNA analysis was able to confirm that the unidentified victim known as ML73-3378 was actually Michael Anthony Baulch, who had incorrectly been identified as case file ML73-3333: the second victim unearthed from the boat shed. Baulch had disappeared en route to a barbershop on July 19, 1973—a year after his brother, Billy, had been murdered by Corll. The 1973 misidentification of Michael Baulch was discovered as a result of an independent investigation conducted by freelance writers Barbara Gibson and Debera Phinney, who contacted Dr. Derrick with a tip indicating that the second victim unearthed from the boat shed had been misidentified; upon conducting additional DNA testing, Dr. Derrick discovered their suspicions were correct.

Henley had stated in his confession to police that he and Corll had &quot;choked&quot; Michael Baulch and buried him at Lake Sam Rayburn. The unidentified victim mistakenly identified as Baulch had been killed by two gunshots to the head and buried inside the boat shed. Three factors helped lead to the 1973 misidentification of Baulch: Michael&#x27;s parents had previously filed a missing persons report on their son (who had previously left home to search for his older brother) in August 1972—precisely the same time as the second victim unearthed from the boat shed was estimated to have been killed. This was the only missing persons report on file for Michael Baulch. In addition, the victim was of a similar height to Baulch and circumstantial dental fractures had also helped facilitate the misidentification.

On November 4, 2011, the victim mistakenly identified as Baulch (case file ML73-3333) was identified through DNA analysis as Roy Eugene Bunton, a Heights teenager who was last seen by his family heading for work at a Houston shoe store on or about August 21, 1972. Bunton&#x27;s family had always believed him to be a victim of Corll and had contacted Dr. Derrick in 2009 to submit a DNA sample for comparison with the unidentified bodies. Initially, the results conducted had been negative due to the misidentification of Bunton&#x27;s remains as being those of Baulch. However, upon discovering the 1973 misidentification of Baulch&#x27;s remains, DNA samples obtained from Bunton&#x27;s family were compared to those taken from the body mistakenly identified as being that of Baulch and these proved to be a conclusive match to Bunton.

In the confession given by Henley on August 9, 1973, the youth had stated that victim Mark Scott had been strangled and buried at High Island. Brooks had also stated in his confession that Scott was likely buried at High Island. Scott had been a blond youth who had not had any teeth extracted prior to his disappearance; however, Dr. Elizabeth Johnson of the Harris County Medical Institute had concluded in 1993 that the fifteenth set of remains unearthed from the boat shed—which had physical characteristics such as dark brown hair and two extracted molars—were those of Scott. Dr. Johnson had based her findings upon comparison of DNA analysis of a blood sample taken from Scott&#x27;s mother with the remains unearthed from the boat shed, stating with a 98.5% degree of accuracy the decedent had been related to Scott&#x27;s mother.

In a 2010 interview granted to investigative reporter Barbara Gibson, Henley disputed the 1993 identification of a victim buried in the boat shed as Scott and reiterated his claim that Scott had been buried at High Island &quot;in the sand: fetal position; head up,&quot; adding that he had repeatedly argued this point with Dr.Jachimczyk.

As a result of Henley&#x27;s claims, DNA tests on the body initially identified as Scott were again tested against samples of DNA taken from Scott&#x27;s family. In March 2011, DNA analysis confirmed that the victim known as ML73-3355 had been misidentified and the same month, the victim was identified as Steven Kent Sickman, a 17-year-old who was last seen walking down West 34th Street shortly before midnight on July 19, 1972. He was murdered at Corll&#x27;s Westcott Towers address. Sickman&#x27;s mother had reported her son missing shortly after his disappearance, but police had been unwilling to conduct a search for the youth, telling the mother that he was 17 years old and that unless they found a body, there was nothing they could do to assist her. Had Henley not been adamant in his assertion that the body of Scott had been misidentified, it is likely Sickman would have never been conclusively confirmed as a victim of Corll.

All six bodies directly linked to the Houston Mass Murders found at High Island have been identified. As Henley&#x27;s claim that the victim known as ML73-3355 was not Scott has been proven to be correct, a strong suspicion remains that Scott&#x27;s body remains buried on High Island.

==Unidentified victim==
Corll&#x27;s only known unidentified victim—the sixteenth body found in the boat shed—was in an advanced stage of decomposition at the time of his discovery, leading investigators to deduce that he had likely been killed in 1971 or 1972. This unidentified victim was found wearing red-white-and-blue striped swimming trunks, cowboy boots, a leather bracelet and a long-sleeved, khaki-colored T-shirt decorated with a peace symbol, leading investigators to conclude that he was likely killed in the summer months. In addition, his T-shirt bore a handwritten inscription believed to read either &quot;LB4MF&quot;, &quot;LBHMF&quot;, or &quot;L84MF&quot;. He had dark hair and may have had spina bifida, a congenital disability that could have affected his gait, or caused chronic pain. This victim has been referred to as &quot;John Houston Doe&quot; since the discovery of his body, but is also informally known as &quot;Swimsuit Boy&quot;.

This unidentified victim was found buried near the entrance to the boat shed between the bodies of Steven Sickman and Ruben Haney, whereas the bodies of the victims killed between December 1970 and May 1971 were found buried at the rear of the shed. It is likely, though not conclusive, that the unidentified sixteenth victim found within the boat shed may have been killed in the late summer or early fall of 1971. Dr. Derrick has stated that she believes this particular victim may be named Harman, Harmon or French, as the only outstanding missing persons reports relating to youths from the Houston area dated between 1970 and 1973, which fit the forensic profile of this unknown youth, include these surnames. One of these individuals, 15-year-old John Harmon, had been a Heights teenager reported missing in 1971. He is last known to have phoned his parents claiming to need money in much the same manner as victims Charles Cobble and Marty Jones had been forced to telephone their parents before their murder.

Dr. Derrick has stated she has reason to believe this victim may be named Robert (or &quot;Bobby&quot;) French, adding she has received an anonymous package containing a series of photographs potentially depicting this individual taken shortly before his murder, and that the sender of this package named this individual as one Bobby French.

In 2022, authorities announced that the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and the Harris County Institute of Forensic Science are actively working together to identify this victim. An updated facial reconstruction was released to the media in August 2023.

==Possible additional victims==
Forty-two boys had vanished from Houston Heights between 1970 and Corll&#x27;s death in 1973. The police were heavily criticized for curtailing the search for further victims once the record set by Juan Corona for having the most victims had been surpassed. After finding the 26th and 27th bodies, tied together, at High Island Beach on August 13, the search for any further victims was terminated, despite Henley&#x27;s insistence that two further bodies had been buried on the beach in 1972. A curious feature about this final discovery was the presence of two extra bones (an arm bone and a pelvis) in the grave, indicating at least one additional, undiscovered victim. Investigators later returned to the scene where these extra bones were discovered in efforts to locate any additional human remains at the site of their discovery, although this search yielded no further remains.

The two bodies that Henley had insisted were still buried on the beach may have been those of Scott and Lyles. In light of developments relating to the identifications of victims, the body of Scott still lies undiscovered at High Island, while Lyles&#x27;s remains were only found by chance in 1983. Had the search for bodies continued, both victims would have likely been discovered. Following Hurricane Ike in 2008, the area of High Island Beach where Corll is known to have buried his victims remains submerged, leaving a strong possibility that Scott&#x27;s body will never be found.

Former workers at Corll Candy Company recalled Corll doing a lot of digging in the years leading up to 1968, when his mother&#x27;s third marriage was deteriorating and the firm was failing. Corll stated he was burying spoiled candy to avoid contamination by insects. He subsequently cemented over the floor. He was also observed digging in waste ground that was later converted into a parking lot. Former workers also recalled that Corll had rolls of clear plastic of precisely the same type used to bury his victims. Moreover, co-workers at HL&amp;P also stated that, from the earliest days of his employment, Corll had repeatedly retained coils of used nylon cord that would otherwise have been discarded. This brand of cord was the same type used to strangle and bind the bodies of many of his victims. The suspicion is that Corll began killing much earlier than 1970 and had been abusing youths prior to this date.

Moreover, in one interview, Brooks claimed that Corll&#x27;s first murder victim was a youth killed at an apartment complex located at 1353 Judiway Street, where Corll had lived between October 7 and November 10, 1968, and when Brooks himself had been thirteen years old. The earliest of Corll&#x27;s victims mentioned by Brooks in his confession were two teenage boys killed at 3300 Yorktown, where Corll had only resided between October 1970 and January 1971. Corll&#x27;s earliest double murder, that of Glass and Yates, took place in December 1970; those victims were actually killed at Corll&#x27;s Yorktown address. A possibility exists that the earliest double murder victims were Glass and Yates; however, Brooks specifically described Glass as being killed in an altogether separate double murder from Corll&#x27;s first double murder in his confession to police. In addition, Brooks only knew the location of Konen&#x27;s body at High Island Beach because Corll had shown it to him. It is possible that the initial double murder Brooks had discovered Corll in the process of committing occurred after the murder of Konen and before those of Glass and Yates.

The confessions of Henley and Brooks separately describe two murders having occurred on unknown dates between September 25, 1971, and early March 1972: a youth Brooks described as having been murdered at Corll&#x27;s apartment on Columbia Street immediately prior to Henley&#x27;s involvement in the crimes and the unidentified first teenager whose abduction Henley had participated in shortly prior to the murder of Frank Aguirre. However, only one unidentified murder victim linked to the case remains meaning that, if the unidentified victim discovered in the boat shed is actually one of these two individuals, a further victim remains undiscovered. These details, alongside the two additional bones that were found with the 26th and 27th victims discovered plus the unidentified victim killed at Judiway Street, indicate a minimum of three and possibly six more unknown victims.

There are two suspiciously long gaps between known victims in the chronology of Corll&#x27;s known murders. His last known victim of 1971 was Ruben Watson Haney, who disappeared on August 17. The first victim of 1972 was Frank Aguirre, who disappeared on March 24, meaning no known victims were killed for seven months. Moreover, Corll also is not known to have killed between February 1 and June 4, 1973.

The January 14, 1973, disappearance of 16-year-old Norman Lamar Prater has been tentatively linked to Corll. Prater was last seen by his mother in Dallas in the company of an adult male and two teenage youths with shoulder-length hair; he had previously lived in the same neighborhood as most of Corll&#x27;s known victims and had attended the same high school as Henley between 1970 and 1971. Prater is known to have continued to visit his father in Houston during weekends after he moved with his mother to Dallas. However, no firm evidence exists to link Prater&#x27;s disappearance to Corll and his accomplices.

In March 1973, a Mr. and Mrs. Abernathy had reported to Galveston County authorities that they had observed three men carrying and burying a &quot;long, wrapped bundle&quot; at Galveston Beach. The couple identified two of the men as Corll and Henley. The third individual had long, blond hair—like Brooks. As the couple watched the trio, one of the men (whom they later identified as Henley) advanced upon their car with such a menacing expression that the couple felt compelled to drive away. Two women had also observed three men digging at the beach in May 1973—one of whom they positively identified as Brooks. However, police were again unwilling to extend the search.

In February 2012, a picture was released to the news media of a likely unknown victim of Corll. The color Polaroid image had been found in the personal possessions of Henley, which had been stored by his family since his arrest in 1973. The image depicts a blond-haired teenage youth in handcuffs, strapped to a device upon Corll&#x27;s floor, alongside a toolbox known to contain various instruments Corll used to torture his victims. The individual depicted has been ruled out by the Harris County Medical Examiner as being any of Corll&#x27;s known victims, including his one remaining known unidentified victim. Henley himself has stated that the picture must have been taken after he had acquired a Polaroid camera in 1972—although he is adamant that he has no idea who this boy is. Given that Henley became acquainted with Corll in 1972, it is likely this boy would have been killed in 1972 or 1973.

==Potential association with a national sex ring==
During a routine investigation in February 1975, the HPD discovered a large cache of pornographic pictures and films depicting boys as young as eight, most of whom were from the Heights. Of the sixteen individuals depicted within the films and photos, eleven of the individuals appeared to be among Corll&#x27;s known victims who had been identified by this date; other individuals in the cache were underage at the time the images and films had been taken, but had reached the legal age of consent by the time of the discoveries and their questioning by authorities, indicating the material had been accrued over many years.

The discovery raised the disturbing possibility that the statements Corll had given to both Henley and Brooks that he was associated with a Dallas-based organization which &quot;bought and sold boys&quot; may indeed have held a degree of truth. The discovery of the material in Houston in 1975 subsequently led to the arrest of five individuals in Santa Clara, California, including the owner of the warehouse where the cache had been stored, Roy Ames, a known producer of child pornography, whose name police had found on a card in Corll&#x27;s wallet. No direct link in these arrests to Corll was proven, as the HPD declined to pursue any possible link to the killings, stating they felt Corll&#x27;s victims&#x27; families had &quot;suffered enough.&quot;

On August 15, 1973, just two days after investigators had uncovered the final bodies initially linked to the Houston Mass Murders, investigators in Dallas uncovered a nationwide homosexual procurement ring operated by John David Norman. This police raid seized a card filing system containing up to 10,000 names of individuals across the United States ascribed to this network and the personal details of numerous teenage boys exploited by this sex trafficking ring.

There is still no conclusive evidence to suggest that Corll had ever solicited any of his victims in this manner, not only because the HPD chose not to pursue this potential possibility, but also because neither Brooks nor Henley ever mentioned having met any individuals from the &quot;organization&quot; Corll had claimed he was involved with. In addition, neither mentioned having seen any of the victims either filmed, photographed, or released from the devices Corll restrained his victims to until after their rape, torture, and murder. The arrests in Santa Clara do, however, suggest possible validity in Brooks&#x27;s statements to police that Corll had informed him that his earliest murder victims had been buried in California.

<text>The Poland national football team () represents Poland in men&#x27;s international football competitions since their first match in 1921. It is governed by the Polish Football Association (PZPN), the governing body for football in Poland. They are known by the nicknames &quot;The White-Reds&quot; and &quot;The Eagles&quot;, symbolized by their coat of arms featuring a white eagle on a red background. The team reached their peak World Ranking of 5th in 2017. Poland&#x27;s home ground is the Kazimierz Górski National Stadium in Warsaw. The current head coach is Michał Probierz.

Poland has competed in nine FIFA World Cups, with their first appearance being in 1938, where they were eliminated by Brazil. The country&#x27;s best result was third place, which Poland achieved in 1974 and 1982; this era is regarded as the golden era of Polish international football. Individually, Grzegorz Lato won the Golden Shoe at the 1974 FIFA World Cup having scored seven goals. The country&#x27;s most recent result at the event was reaching round of 16 at the 2022 FIFA World Cup. 

At the UEFA European Championship, Poland&#x27;s best result was a quarter-final appearance at the 2016 tournament before losing to eventual champions Portugal. Overall, they have competed in five European Championships since their debut in 2008. They were co-hosts of the 2012 edition, along with Ukraine.

Overall, Poland&#x27;s best ever result at an international football tournament was gold won at the 1972 Munich Olympics, along with the silver medal at the 1976 Montreal Olympics.

==History==
===Before independence===
The first Polish football clubs were Lechia Lwów (1903), Czarni Lwów (1903), Pogoń Lwów (1904), KS Cracovia (1906) and Wisła Kraków (1906). The Polish national federation, called the Polish Football Union (Polski Związek Piłki Nożnej, PZPN), was founded on 20 December 1919, in Kraków when 31 delegates elected Edward Cetnarowski as the first president. The PZPN joined FIFA in 1923 and UEFA in 1955.

In a similar fashion to other European states, football appeared in Poland in the late 19th century. In 1888, Prof. Henryk Jordan, a court physician of the Habsburgs and the pioneer of sports in Poland, opened a sports park in Kraków&#x27;s &quot;Błonia&quot;, a large open space surrounding the demolished city walls of that town. The park, along with the &quot;Sokół&quot; society founded in 1867, became the main centres to promote sports and healthy living in Poland. It was Jordan who began promoting football as a healthy sport in the open air; some sources also credit him with bringing the first football to Poland from his travels to Brunswick in 1890. Other source mentions Dr. Edmund Cenar as the one to bring the first ball and the one to translate The Cambridge Rules and parts of the International Football Association Board regulations to Polish language.

On 14 July 1894, during the Second Sokół Jamboree in Lwów at the General National Exhibition, a short football match was played between the Sokół members of Lwów and those from Kraków. It lasted only six minutes and was seen as a curiosity rather than a potentially popular sport. Nevertheless, it was the first recorded football match in Polish history. The Lwów team won after Włodzimierz Chomicki scored the only goal - the first known goal in Polish history.

This match precipitated the popularity of the new sport in Poland. Initially the rules and regulations were very simplified, with the size of the field and the ball varying greatly. Despite being discouraged by many educational societies and the state authorities, the new sport gained extreme popularity among pupils of various gymnasiums in Galicia. The first football teams were formed and in 1903–1904, four Lwów-based gymnasiums formed their own sport clubs: the IV Gymnasium for Boys formed a club later renamed to Pogoń Lwów, while the pupils of the I and II State Schools formed the &quot;Sława Lwów&quot; club, later renamed to Czarni Lwów. In the same season the Lechia Lwów was also formed. It is uncertain which of the clubs was created first as they were initially poorly organised; however, the Czarni Lwów are usually credited as being the first Polish professional football team. The following year, the popularity of the sport spread to nearby Rzeszów where Resovia Rzeszów was formed, while in the German-held part of Poland, the 1. FC Katowice and Warta Poznań were formed.

On 6 June 1906, a representation of Lwów youth came to Kraków for a repeat match, this time composed of two already organised teams, the Czarni and the team of the IV Gymnasium. Kraków&#x27;s representation was beaten in both meetings, 4–0 and 2–0 respectively. That summer the Buffalo Bill Wild West Show set up camp at Kraków&#x27;s Błonia, right outside of the traditional playground area and Jordan&#x27;s garden. On 5 August 1906 the team of the Kraków-based Jan Sobieski Gymnasium played a match against the British and American members of Buffalo Bill&#x27;s troupe, winning 1–0. The only goal scored by Stanisław Szeligowski was also the first goal scored by a Polish team in an international meeting. The success led to the popularisation of football in Kraków and to creation of the first Kraków-based professional football team, KS Cracovia initially composed primarily of students of the Jan Sobieski Gymnasium. By the autumn of that year there were already 16 teams in Kraków, including Wisła Kraków. In 1911, a Kraków-based Union of Polish Football for Galicia was formed and entered the Austrian Football Association. The union inspired the creation of a number of teams.

After the outbreak of World War I, most of the Galician football players, many of them members of either Strzelec or Sokół, joined Piłsudski&#x27;s Polish Legions. The unit, fighting alongside the Austro-Hungarian Army, fought mostly in various parts of Russian-held Poland, which led to popularisation of the new sport in other parts of partitioned Poland. Eventually, Poland regained its independence in 1918.

===1919–1939===

The first football federation was established on 25 June 1911 in Lwów as the Polish Football Union (&quot;Związek Polski Piłki Nożnej&quot;). After World War I, members of PFU established the Polish Football Federation (&quot;Polski Związek Piłki Nożnej&quot;) in Warsaw on 20 December 1919. Two years later, they appointed Hungarian-born Jesza Poszony as the first coach of the Polish national team.

Poland played its first official international match on 18 December 1921 in Budapest, losing to Hungary 1–0. Their first international victory came on 28 May 1922 when they took on Sweden in Stockholm and beat them 2–1. Józef Klotz scored the first-ever goal for the national football team in that game. Poland qualified for their first World Cup in 1937 when they beat Yugoslavia 4–0 and lost 1–0 in the two qualifying matches and ensured their place in the 1938 World Cup in France.

During their World Cup debut, Poland played Brazil and sent them to extra time, only to lose 6–5. Ernest Wilimowski, who played for Ruch Chorzów at the time, scored four of Poland&#x27;s five goals.

Poland played what would be their last international match before the outbreak of World War II against Hungary, the runners-up in the 1938 World Cup. Poland defeated Hungary 4–2.

===1939–1945===
When the Wehrmacht invaded Poland in September 1939, all Polish institutions and associations were dissolved, including the Polish Football Association PZPN. The German occupying forces forbade Poles to organise football matches. Consequently, there was no national team.

Nine former national players were murdered by the German occupying forces. Three of them were killed in Auschwitz: Marian Einbacher, Adam Knioła (both Warta Poznań) and Antoni Łyko (Wisła Kraków). Stefan Fryc (Cracovia) and Bronisław Makowski (Wisła Kraków), who were both active in the resistance, were killed in mass shootings. Four Jewish players were murdered in Jewish ghettos: Józef Klotz, Zygmunt Krumholz (both Jutrzenka Kraków), Leon Sperling (Cracovia) and Zygmunt Steuermann (Hasmonea Lwów), brother of actress and Hollywood screenwriter Salka Viertel.

===1946–1974===

On 11 June 1946, following the aftermath of World War II, Poland played their first international friendly match, a 3–1 defeat against Norway in Oslo. Poland&#x27;s biggest success in the early years after the war was their victory against one of Europe&#x27;s best at the time, Czechoslovakia. Poland defeated their southern neighbors 3–1.

Poland suffered the worst defeat in the team&#x27;s history on 26 April 1948 with a 0–8 loss to Denmark in Copenhagen. 15 years later, they posted their second highest-ever victory in Szczecin when they defeated Norway 9–0 on 4 September 1963. The game marked the debut for Włodzimierz Lubański, who scored one goal in the game. Lubański became the all-time top scorer for Poland while playing from 1963 to 1980, scoring 48 goals in 75 appearances, a record which stood for 37 years. The game remained their highest victory until the score was surpassed on 1 April 2009, when Poland defeated San Marino 10–0.

===1974–1986===
For 1974 World Cup qualification, Poland qualified and eliminated England, who missed out on the World Cup for the first time since 1946. For Poland themselves, this was their first appearance since 1938.
In their opening match of the 1974 World Cup, Poland met Argentina. Within eight minutes Poland were up 2–0 as Grzegorz Lato opened the scoring in the seventh minute and just a minute later Andrzej Szarmach doubled the lead. In the 60th minute, Argentina cut the lead in half when Ramon Heredia scored. Two minutes later, however, Lato scored his second, which turned out to be the winning goal as Carlos Babington gave Argentina their second in the 66th. Poland won 3–2.

Poland has won Haiti 7–0 in their second game, with a hat-trick from Szarmach and two goals from Lato. In their final match of the group stage, Poland met Italy. Poland were already through to the second round but needed at least a draw to win the group. Poland defeated Italy 2–1, finishing at the top of the group. In the second round, Poland won 1–0 against Sweden, who had not conceded any goals in their first three matches. Lato scored the only goal of the game. In the next game, Yugoslavia conceded a penalty from Poland in the 24th minute, and Stanislav Karasi tied it up for Yugoslavia in the 43rd. Lato scored the winning goal.

Poland faced hosts West Germany in the rain; Gerd Müller scored the winning goal in the 76th minute for West Germany. The Poles eventually defeated Brazil in the third place match.

In 1978 World Cup qualifying, Poland denied Portugal their second World Cup appearance and their first in 12 years. In the World Cup, Grzegorz Lato scored the only goal against African side Tunisia in the second match. In the final first-round match Poland met Mexico, with a 3–1 win.

In the second round, Poland met three South American teams. In 1974, Poland had played and won against both Argentina and Brazil; both teams would get their revenge this time around. First, Argentina beat the Poles 2–0 with two goals from tournament top scorer Mario Kempes. Poland then defeated Peru 1–0 with a goal from Andrzej Szarmach. In Poland&#x27;s last match of this World Cup, Brazil opened the scoring in the 12th minute on a goal from Nelinho. Even though Lato equalized one minute before half-time, it was not to be for Poland: two goals from Roberto in the 57th and 62nd minutes wrapped up a 3–1 win for Brazil.
On 29 November 1980, a dispute between players and technical staff began at a hotel in Warsaw, ending in the Okęcie Airport. Following the incident, several players of the Poland national team were banned from international duty, and Ryszard Kulesza resigned as head coach of the team. At the 1982 FIFA World Cup, Poland were drawn in a group with Italy, Cameroon and Peru. The first two games were consecutive 0–0 draws with Italy and Cameroon, but the final group game of the first round ended in a 5–1 win for Poland, meaning they would advance to the second round as group winners.

In the first game of the second round, Poland beat Belgium 3–0 with a hat-trick from Boniek securing a classic performance in the match, though the player would receive a yellow card in the following game. Nevertheless, Poland advanced as group winners to the knockout stage. However, Poland would eventually be stopped in the semi-finals, losing 0–2 to Italy; however, they also secured a place in the third place play-off, where Poland beat France 3–2, with the game also being regarded as &quot;the end of the golden era of Polish football&quot;.
In 1986 FIFA World Cup qualifying, Poland finished top of their qualifying group, with 3 wins, 2 draws and 1 defeat. Poland&#x27;s biggest win of the qualifying phase was a 4–1 win over Greece, while Poland&#x27;s biggest defeat was a 0–2 defeat to Belgium.

At the 1986 World Cup, Poland were drawn into a group with England, Morocco and Portugal. The first match was a 0–0 draw against Morocco; in the second match, Poland beat Portugal 1–0. In the final group game, they lost 0–3 to England, but Poland still advanced into the knockout stage as a result of Morocco winning 3–1 over Portugal. In the round of sixteen, Poland were eliminated after suffering a 4–0 defeat to Brazil.

===1986–2001===
After the &quot;Golden Era&quot; from the 1970s and 1980s, Poland suffered a severe drought in international football; they did not qualify for three consecutive editions of the FIFA World Cup, from 1990 to 1998.

In 1990 World Cup qualifying, Poland finished third in the qualifying group, behind Sweden and England. They finished on 5 points with two wins, one draw and three defeats. They began qualifying for the 1990 edition with a 1–0 win over Albania, before losing to Sweden (2–1) and England (3–0). Poland then drew 0–0 with England, lost to Sweden 2–0 and beat Albania 2–1 in their final game, but were 4 points behind England, thus failing to qualify.

In 1994 World Cup qualifying, Poland finished fourth in the qualifying group, behind Norway, the Netherlands and England. Poland began qualifying with a 1–0 win over Turkey, followed by a 2–2 draw with the Netherlands, a 1–0 win over San Marino, and a 3–0 win in the reverse fixture. Afterwards, Poland drew 1–1 with England, before falling to a 0–3 defeat in the reverse fixture. Poland would then go on to suffer consecutive defeats, losing 1–0 and 3–0 to Norway, followed by a 2–1 defeat to Turkey and a 1–3 defeat to the Netherlands in the final fixture.
In Euro 1996 qualifying, Poland drew a qualifying group with Romania, France, Slovakia, Israel and Azerbaijan. Poland lost 2–1 to Israel in the first game, and then recorded a 1–0 win over Azerbaijan and a 0–0 draw with France. Later, Poland lost 2–1 to Romania and beat Israel 4–3 and Slovakia 5–0 before consecutive draws with France (1–1) and Romania (0–0). Poland lost 4–1 to Slovakia in the penultimate qualifying game, and drew 0–0 with Azerbaijan in the final group game.

In 1998 World Cup qualifying, Poland finished third behind England and Italy. They began qualifying with a 2–1 loss to England before beating Moldova (2–1) and drawing 0–0 with Italy. Afterwards, they suffered successive defeats to Italy (3–0) and England (0–2). They won the next two games with scores of 4–1 over Georgia and 3–0 over Moldova, with Andrzej Juskowiak scoring a hat-trick against the latter. The final game was against Georgia, with Poland losing 0–3.

During UEFA Euro 2000 qualifying, Poland was drawn in a group with England, Sweden, Bulgaria and Luxembourg. Poland finished third, tied with England in points earned, but failed to qualify due to goal difference.

===2001–2006===

Poland qualified for the 2002 World Cup, their first appearance at the World Cup since 1986. Poland&#x27;s biggest win overall in the qualifying phase was a 4–0 win over Armenia, while their biggest defeat was a 4–1 defeat to Belarus.

The Polish drew a group featuring hosts South Korea, the United States and Portugal. The first match was played against the hosts on 4 June, with Poland losing 2–0. The second game was against Portugal on 10 June, which Poland lost 4–0, confirming their early elimination. Poland then played the United States in the final group game on 14 June, winning 3–1; however, the U.S. advanced to the quarter-finals after defeating Mexico in the round of 16. Despite the win, Poland finished last in the group, with a goal difference of –4 and 3 points.

Poland&#x27;s qualifying for the 2006 FIFA World Cup saw eight wins and two defeats. They finished behind England in the qualifying group; but as a result of being the second best second-placed team in the play-offs, they qualified automatically for the finals in Germany. The biggest win of the qualifying phase for Poland was an 8–0 victory over Azerbaijan, in which Tomasz Frankowski scored a hat-trick. The biggest defeat of the qualifying phase for Poland were two defeats against England, losing both home and away games by a scoreline of 1–2.

At the 2006 World Cup, Poland drew Germany, Ecuador and Costa Rica in Group A. Despite high hopes from the Polish press, media and fans, Poland&#x27;s campaign at the World Cup was seen as an underachievement; as Poland lost two and won one game, finishing third in the group. Poland&#x27;s first match was a 2–0 defeat to Ecuador, followed by a 1–0 defeat to Germany, with Oliver Neuville scoring a stoppage time winning goal; the defeat to Germany, following Ecuador&#x27;s 3–0 win over Costa Rica, officially ended Poland&#x27;s chances of advancing further than the group stage. The third and final group game saw Poland defeat Costa Rica 2–1, with Bartosz Bosacki getting on the scoresheet twice.

===2008===
In Euro 2008 qualifying, Poland were drawn into a group with Portugal, Serbia, Finland, Belgium, Kazakhstan, Armenia and Azerbaijan. Poland&#x27;s campaign began in uncomfortable fashion, suffering a 1–3 defeat to Finland on 2 September 2006 and then drawing 1–1 with Serbia on 6 September. In the third match, on 7 October, Poland won 1–0 over Kazakhstan, with Ebi Smolarek scoring the goal. On 11 October, Poland beat Portugal 2–1, with Smolarek scoring the two goals.

They beat Belgium 2–0 with two goals from Smolarek on 17 November and drew 2–2 with Serbia in the final qualifying game on the 21st, thus qualifying for the tournament as the 1st place team in the qualifying group following Portugal&#x27;s 0–0 draw with Finland. This was Poland&#x27;s first ever Euro appearance.

At UEFA Euro 2008, they were drawn in Group B, with Germany, Austria and Croatia. Germany and Poland played on 8 June at the Hypo-Arena in Klagenfurt, Austria, with Poland losing 2–0 with two goals from Lukas Podolski. In the second game, Poland drew 1–1 with Austria, taking the lead through Brazil-born Roger Guerreiro, before conceding in the third minute of stoppage time following a controversial penalty. Poland lost 1–0 in the final group game was against Croatia and finished bottom of the group.

===2010===

In 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifying, Poland were drawn in a group with Slovakia, Slovenia, the Czech Republic, Northern Ireland and San Marino.

The bid defeated others from Italy, Greece, Turkey, and a joint bid by Croatia and Hungary. Poland and Ukraine&#x27;s bid became the third successful joint-bid made to host the UEFA European Championship, after the Netherlands and Belgium in 2000, and Austria and Switzerland in 2008.

At UEFA Euro 2016, Poland were drawn in Group C, with Germany, Northern Ireland and Ukraine.

Poland&#x27;s first match was with Northern Ireland on 12 June at the Stade de Nice in Nice; they won the game 1–0 with a goal from Arkadiusz Milik in the 51st minute.

Poland played at the 2018 FIFA World Cup, their first World Cup since 2006, in Group H, against Senegal, Colombia and Japan. Despite the group being considered close, Poland were tipped as favorites to advance.

Poland&#x27;s tournament was disappointing overall; they lost to Senegal in the opening match, 2–1 on 19 June in Moscow. Five days later, on 24 June, they lost to Colombia in Kazan 3–0, mathematically eliminating them from the round of 16. They did beat Japan 1–0 in their final group game in Volgograd.

Qualifying for UEFA Euro 2020 was based on performance in the inaugural 2018–19 UEFA Nations League. In 2018, Poland was drawn into Group 3 in the 2018–19 UEFA Nations League A, along with Portugal and Italy. Poland was relegated to League B with two home defeats and two away draws, only to be allowed to remain on League A following UEFA rule changes.

Poland opened their UEFA Euro 2020 qualifying by a single-margin 1–0 win against Austria in Vienna. Three days later, Poland followed up their suit by beating Latvia 2–0 at home.

On 7 June 2019, Poland defeated North Macedonia 1–0 by a lone goal from Piątek. They then beat Israel 4–0 in Warsaw. Poland then lost 2–0 to Slovenia in Ljubljana. A following 0–0 home draw to Austria meant that Poland&#x27;s top spot was under bank, with Slovenia approaching very quickly.

In October, Poland embattled two opponents, Latvia and North Macedonia, for its UEFA Euro 2020 quest. Poland managed a convincing 3–0 away win over Latvia, eliminating them from the competition. Slovenia&#x27;s shock away defeat to North Macedonia relieved pressure for Poland, with Slovenia falling from second to fourth place. Eventually, Poland beat North Macedonia 2–0 at home, and with Slovenia falling at home to Austria, Poland qualified for the Euros for the fourth consecutive time.

Being allowed to remain in League A, Poland was drawn against Italy, the Netherlands, and Bosnia and Herzegovina. The performance of this tournament doubled as part of the upcoming 2022 FIFA World Cup qualification as playoff campaigns.

Poland started their League games without Lewandowski. In their first match, an away game against the Netherlands, the Poles lost 1–0. Later, Poland made a trip to Bosnia; the Bosnian team, including Edin Džeko, had held Italy 1–1 draw away before. However, Poland managed a comeback from a goal down, with Kamil Glik and Kamil Grosicki scoring to beat Bosnia 2–1. In October, Poland hosted Italy and Bosnia at home; a goalless draw with Italy combined with a 3–0 win over Bosnia made them temporarily occupy the top spot of the group. However, in November, Poland suffered a 2–0 defeat despite Italy being depleted by COVID-19. Poland lost to the Netherlands 2–1 at home, ending in third place.

Poland participated in UEFA Euro 2020, postponed to 2021 due to COVID-19. A 2–1 loss to Slovakia, followed by a 1–1 draw to Spain, preceded a 3–2 defeat to Sweden to eliminate the Poles.

=== 2022–present ===

Poland advanced to the second round (play-offs) of World Cup qualification to determine the final three European teams that would join the group winners at the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar. Poland was scheduled to face Russia in Moscow on 24 March 2022 in the semi-final of a four-team playoff bracket that also included Sweden and the Czech Republic. However, following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, FIFA indefinitely suspended Russia from all international competition. Poland advanced automatically to the play-off finals, where they defeated Sweden to qualify.

At the 2022 World Cup, Poland was drawn into Group C, where they were scheduled to play against Argentina, Saudi Arabia, and Mexico. The first match ended with a goalless draw against Mexico. Goals from Piotr Zieliński and Robert Lewandowski gave Poland a 2–0 win against Saudi Arabia in the second match. Following their loss to Argentina, Poland advanced to the knockout stage ahead of Mexico on goal difference, their first knockout stage appearance since 1986. During the match, Wojciech Szczęsny denied Lionel Messi on a penalty kick opportunity. Szczęsny became the third keeper ever to stop two penalties in a single World Cup, with the others being Brad Friedel in 2002 for the United States and Jan Tomaszewski in 1974, also for Poland. In the round of 16, Poland lost 3–1 to France, in which Robert Lewandowski scored a penalty in stoppage time.

Czesław Michniewicz did not renew his contract as manager and his place was taken by award-winning coach Fernando Santos to take on the mission of qualifying for Euro 2024. Defeats to the Czech Republic, Moldova and Albania brought his dismissal. In September 2023, Fernando Santos was replaced by Michał Probierz, who started with a win against the Faroe Islands in Euro 2024 qualifying, but then drew with Moldova. Poland later ended qualification for Euro 2024 with a 1–1 draw to the Czech Republic, ending all hopes for Poland to clinch automatic qualification. However, because of Poland&#x27;s Nations League performance, the Poles were able to salvage a place in the play-offs, where Poland defeated Estonia 5–1. After a goalless draw against Wales, the Poles won on penalties to secure a spot at the Euros. At the tournament, they finished last in the group after losing 2–1 to the Netherlands, 3–1 to Austria, and drawing 1–1 with France.

==Team image==
===Names===
The official FIFA country code for Poland is POL. This abbreviation is used to identify the team in FIFA, UEFA, and other matches. The same abbreviation is also used under the International Organization for Standardization. &quot;Polish national football team&quot; can be translated into Polish as &quot;&quot;Reprezentacja Polski w piłce nożnej&quot;. The team&#x27;s most common nicknames include &quot;Biało-czerwoni&quot;&quot;, which means &quot;The white-reds&quot;, and &quot;Orły&quot;, which translates into &quot;The Eagles&quot;. In English, the team is also widely known as &quot;The White Eagles&quot;, based on Poland&#x27;s national coat of arms.

===Supporters===

The Polish team enjoys widespread support in Poland and among Polish diaspora worldwide. A notable chant among Polish fans is &quot;Polska, biało-czerwoni&quot; (&quot;Poland, the White-Reds&quot;).

===National kits===
The national kits of Poland reflect the colours of the national flag, which are white and red. Apart from minor details (in the 1920s the socks in the home kit were striped), the design remains unchanged since 1921. The home kit consists of a white shirt, red shorts, and white socks; the away kit is all red (though sometimes worn with white shorts). On the rare occasions when both home and away kits clash with the opponent&#x27;s, a colours third kit is available, usually in either black or blue (currently navy blue with white-red sleeves).

The kit has traditionally been adorned with the coat of arms of Poland, i.e. the crowned white eagle. Until 2006, the coat of arms featured only the inscription &quot;POLSKA&quot; in capital letters above the eagle, and not, as with many other national teams, the national football federation logo. The Euro 2012 kits were the first to feature the logo of the PZPN. When the kit was first launched it did not include the coat of arms, but it was restored shortly thereafter. Since 2009, the kits have been provided by Nike.

==Stadiums==
===Main stadiums===
Silesian Stadium in Chorzów was built in 1956; the stadium has a seating capacity of 47,246. The stadium was renovated to expand its seating capacity to 55,211 and was reopened in October 2017.

<text>Karl Denke (11 February 1860 – 22 December 1924) was a German serial killer and cannibal who killed and cannibalized dozens of homeless vagrants and travellers from 1903 to 1924. He has been nicknamed the Cannibal of Münsterberg and the Forgotten Cannibal.

== Early life ==
Denke was born on 11 February 1860 in Oberkunzendorf, north-east of Münsterberg, Silesia, in the Kingdom of Prussia (now Ziębice, Poland), to a family of German farmers. Little is known of Denke&#x27;s childhood, but it is known that he was often described as a quiet and soft-spoken child who was difficult to raise, being noted as one of the worst students at his elementary school. At the age of 12, Denke ran away from home.

== Later years ==
After graduating from elementary school, Denke became the apprentice of a gardener and made a life for himself. At the age of 25, Denke&#x27;s father died and his older brother inherited their childhood home, while Denke received a portion of money, which he used to buy a piece of land. Denke tried farming, but this failed and Denke sold it as a result. Denke purchased a house to rent out on what is now Stawowa Street, but inflation forced him to sell it. Denke still refused to move out and lived in a small apartment to the right of the house&#x27;s ground floor. He acquired a vending licence and ran a nearby shop where he sold goods made from leather and boneless meat (which most speculate to have contained human remains). Denke volunteered as a cross-bearer and organist at the local Lutheran church, and was well-liked in his community, often affectionately referred to as &quot;Papa&quot; by the community. Denke quit his membership in the church in 1906.

== Murders ==
Karl Denke, for unknown reasons, began murdering homeless vagrants and poor travellers. His first known victim was Ida Launer in 1903. Six years later, in 1909, he killed 25-year-old Emma Sander (another slaughterhouse worker, Eduard Trautmann, was found guilty of her murder, but was released in 1926 after the truth was discovered). His last known victim was Rochus Pawlick. Denke also kept a ledger recording his murders. He is also believed to have sold the flesh of his victims in nearby Breslau as pickled meat to unsuspecting customers (advertised as pork).

== Arrest, suicide, and aftermath ==
On 21 December 1924, Denke lured a homeless drifter named Vincenz Olivier into his home with the promise of twenty pfennig if he wrote a letter for him. Olivier had been directed to Denke by a townswoman, as Denke was known for his charitable nature. According to Olivier, he had sat down at a desk after being handed a pen and paper, but turned to his host after becoming perplexed when Denke dictated &quot;Adolph, du fetter Wanst!&quot; (&quot;Adolph, you fat slob!&quot;), just in time to see him in the process of raising a pickaxe to strike Olivier&#x27;s head. The victim managed to duck, receiving a deep gash (8 cm in length and 2 cm wide) to the temple before he was able to wrestle the weapon from Denke in the ensuing struggle. Olivier escaped through the front door, screaming that a &quot;madman&quot; was trying to kill him attracting the attention of neighbours, who then alerted the authorities. Initially, Olivier&#x27;s testimony was disregarded due to Denke&#x27;s reputation among the townsfolk, leading to his arrest for vagrancy and panhandling. The judge, however, insisted on further investigation of Olivier&#x27;s claims, whereupon Denke was taken in for questioning. He was placed in a holding cell, where he hanged himself just hours later with an unspecified ligature (the exact nature of which varies from account to account, but most commonly a handkerchief and/or shoelace) before an interrogation could take place. In light of this, Denke&#x27;s home was searched and police found the gruesome truth of his murders and cannibalism, discovering unidentified flesh that was being cured inside of two tubs filled with brine, a box with an assortment of human bones and human fat stored inside pots. They also discovered several items, including shoes, belts, braces, and shoelaces, that analysis determined were made with tanned human skin. While the exact number of his victims is unknown, Denke&#x27;s ledger had 31 names recorded (including Olivier, who had escaped), confirming at least 30 victims. However, due to the large number of body parts found in his home, Denke&#x27;s body count was estimated to be as high as 42 or even higher.

A detailed report of what was found includes:

* sixteen femurs, with one pair of remarkably strong ones, two pairs of very thin ones, six pairs and two left femurs
* fifteen medium-sized pieces of long bones
* four pairs of elbow bones
* seven heads of radii
* nine lower parts of radii
* eight lower parts of the elbow
* a pair of upper shinbone
* a pair of lower elbows and radii, of which extremities still remain well connected
* a pair of upper arms and a pair of upper arm heads
* a pair of collarbones
* two shoulder blades
* eight heels and ankle bones
* 120 toes and phalanx
* 65 feet and metacarpal bones
* five first ribs and 150 pieces of ribs

Decades later, Denke&#x27;s case remains mostly forgotten. Still much about Denke&#x27;s life, motives, methods, and the exact number of victims remains unknown. Only two photographs of Denke are known to exist, with the only clear one having been taken after his death. 

Spree killer Wilhelm Brückner was found to have had an interest in Denke and Fritz Haarmann&#x27;s cases, with a note in his workplace reading &quot;&quot;Massenmörder Haarmann! Massenmörder Denke! Massenmörder&quot; ? ? ?&quot; (Mass murderer Haarmann! Mass murderer Denke! Mass murderer ? ? ?).

== Media ==
* Fritz Lang said in an interview that Denke was among several inspirations for his 1931 thriller film &quot;M&quot;.
* The film &quot;Motel Hell&quot; has a resemblance to Denke&#x27;s case, featuring a farmer who entraps and kills tourists to harvest their flesh for his smoked meats.
* Author Lydia Benecke published a psychological profile of Denke in 2013.
* Casefile covered Denke&#x27;s case in its 212th episode titled &quot;The Forgotten Cannibal&quot; on 21 May 2022.
* German progressive rock band RPWL mentioned Denke on their track &quot;Another Life Beyond Control&quot; from their 2023 album &quot;Crime Scene&quot;.
* The German Neue Deutsche Härte band Heldmaschine published a song called &quot;Karl Denke&quot;, released as a single.

<text>UNCOL (Universal Computer Oriented Language) is a universal intermediate language for compilers. The idea was introduced in 1958, by a SHARE ad-hoc committee. It was never fully specified or implemented; in many ways it was more a concept than a language.

UNCOL was intended to make compilers economically available for each new instruction set architecture and programming language, thereby reducing an N×M problem to N+M. Each machine architecture would require just one compiler back end, and each programming language would require one compiler front end. This was a very ambitious goal because compiler technology was in its infancy, and little was standardized in computer hardware and software.

==History==
The concept of such a universal intermediate language is old: the 
SHARE report (1958) already says &quot;[it has] been discussed by many independent persons as long ago as 1954.&quot; Macrakis (1993) summarizes its fate:

UNCOL is sometimes used as a generic term for the idea of a universal intermediate language. The Architecture Neutral Distribution Format is an example of an UNCOL in this sense, as are various bytecode systems such as UCSD Pascal&#x27;s p-code, and most notably Java bytecode.

<doc id="771872" wikidata="Q5115879" url="?curid=771872" title="ChuckleVision">
<text>ChuckleVision is a British children&#x27;s comedy television series created by Martin Hughes and the Chuckle Brothers for the BBC. It starred Barry and Paul Elliott as the Chuckle Brothers and occasionally their older brothers, Jimmy, and Brian Elliott (known professionally as the Patton Brothers).

It aired to critical acclaim and notoriety becoming widely known among a large span of generations for their Yorkshire humour and catchphrases such as &quot;To me, to you&quot; and &quot;Oh dear, oh dear&quot;. It ran for 292 episodes over twenty-two years from 1987 to 2009.

In January 2018 it was voted as one of the greatest children&#x27;s TV shows of all time by a &quot;Radio Times&quot; panel of experts. Further in August 2019, it was voted the best CBBC show of all time by readers of &quot;Radio Times&quot;.

==Plot==
Episodes of &quot;ChuckleVision&quot; were usually independent, with the basic plot for each involving the brothers undertaking a job, task or adventure. They were often employed by a character known as &quot;No Slacking&quot;, who, despite appearing as a different character in every episode, was always known by this name because of his catchphrase (&quot;And remember, No Slacking!&quot;). The character was always inconvenienced by Paul and Barry and was played by the brothers&#x27; real-life elder sibling, Jimmy Patton. Jimmy was part of a comedy act with his brother Brian, who also appeared in various episodes, mostly playing a villain with the catchphrase &quot;Getoutofit!&quot;. A large amount of the comedy is slapstick.

The duo also carried out work for &quot;Dan the Van&quot;, who was never seen on screen, apart from a single episode where the Chuckle Brothers take it upon themselves to make sure he arrives to a special meeting. Dan&#x27;s face cannot be seen as he is completely covered in bandages and is wearing dark glasses. Relatives of Dan the Van are sometimes seen or referred to, such as his grandmother, Lettuce the Van.

There are often references to Rotherham United football club as the brothers support the club in the TV show and the actors support them in real life too.

In the first two series (1987–1989), each episode focused on a certain topic, in the style of &quot;Blue Peter&quot;. These episodes had rarely been available since their original transmission, until the series was released onto DVD in Autumn 2011. Both series featured a segment called &quot;Armchair Theatre&quot; where Billy Butler would tell a story to the viewers. The first series also featured magician Simon Lovell performing a trick.

The brothers&#x27; main mode of transport was &quot;The Chuckmobile&quot;, a quadracycle with a red-and-white striped roof. Barry was usually the driver, whilst Paul put his feet up on the front bar. Paul only pedalled the bike very occasionally throughout the entire series. The registration plate of the bike is CHUCKLE 1. In 2018, &#x27;The Chuckmobile&#x27; was bought by entertainments company InTo Entertain, who now hire out the bike for events such as weddings, festivals and quirky occasions with the brand name &#x27;Chuckle Your Vision&#x27;.

An exception to the usual format of stand-alone episodes came with Series 14, broadcast in 2002. The series employed a continuous storyline throughout each episode, involving the brothers&#x27; hunt for a missing ruby. They continued a similar trend in the next two series, with two 3-part stories in Series 15, entitled &quot;The Purple Pimple&quot; and &quot;Magnetic Distraction&quot;. A two part story called &quot;Incredible Shrinking Barry&quot; appears in Series 16. From Series 17, this trend was not repeated.

==Characters==
* Paul Chuckle (played by Paul Elliott)
* Barry Chuckle (played by Barry Elliott)
* No Slacking (played by Jimmy Patton, series 3–21)
* Getoutofit (played by Brian Patton, series 7–20)

Paul is the dominant sibling of the two and often due to his blind confidence the two end up in bother. When Paul realises he has made a mistake, he often blames Barry and tends to make Barry do the work whilst taking the credit for himself. Neither brother is particularly bright.

Paul and Barry both possess Northern English accents and have a number of catchphrases, some of which involve one brother replying to the other brother&#x27;s line. Thus &quot;To me&quot; receives the reply &quot;To you&quot;, and &quot;Silly me&quot; is met with &quot;Silly you&quot;. The line &quot;Oh dear&quot; is regularly followed by &quot;Oh &quot;dear&quot;, oh dear&quot;, and sometimes by &quot;Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear&quot; when something goes wrong.

There are often references made to Rotherham United F.C., whom the brothers support in real life. In &quot;Football Heroes&quot;, Paul and Barry play for Rotherham after a mix-up with two former players of the club, Paul scores an own goal and thinking it was a genuine goal, celebrates with Barry.

==Production and broadcast==
The main writer throughout the series&#x27; run was John Sayle, who wrote most of the episodes in each series. Episodes have also been written by Russell T Davies and The Chuckle Brothers themselves. From Series 14 onwards, the run time of each episode was reduced from twenty minutes to fifteen. Series 12 and 13 were also re-edited to match the new run times.

From Series 14 onwards, outtakes were shown during the credits of each episode.

For Series 4, a new theme arrangement was produced by Dave Cooke. This remained from then on, but was shortened from Series 17.

From Series 13 onwards, all episodes were shot in widescreen.

The series ended its 22-year run at the end of 2009, due to dropped ratings and less interest by the BBC, with the final series airing in December of that year. Repeats occurred regularly until the end of 2012. The 2008 Christmas Special became the last episode to be broadcast on CBBC, being shown on Christmas Day 2013.

Following the death of Barry Elliot in 2018, all six episodes of the final series were made available on BBC iPlayer.

The Series 12 episode &#x27;No Pets Allowed&#x27; was repeated on BBC Four on 11 December 2022, as part of a season of repeats of classic children&#x27;s programmes for the BBC&#x27;s 100th anniversary.

==Awards==
On 9 December 2018, &quot;ChuckleVision&quot; received its first award, Special Recognition at the I Talk Telly Awards. The award was the only one to be decided by Founder Elliot Gonzalez, rather than the public.

Paul reacted to the news on Twitter, stating &quot;After 292 episodes spanning 22 years this is the first time EVER that ChuckleVision has been recognised for an award so thank you @elliot_gonzalez and italktelly.com&quot;.

==Commercial release==

=== TV series ===

A BBC VHS was released in April 1993 entitled &quot;Goofy Golfers&quot; which featured three episodes from the fourth series, however it is now out of production. In 2011 and 2012, Delta Music released two DVD box sets of the first two series. These were re-released in 2016 alongside series 3, which was released for the first time onto DVD by Simply Media.

=== Music ===
In 2014, composer Dave Cooke released &#x27;Volume 1&#x27; of ChuckleVision soundtracks and music cues as a digital download. Five more volumes, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 have since been released.

===Stage productions===
There have been four DVD releases of the brothers on stage: &quot;Pirates of the River Rother&quot;, &quot;Spooky Goings On&quot;, &quot;Indiana Chuckles and the Kingdom of the Mythical Sulk&quot; and &quot;The Chuckle Brothers in Trouble&quot;. All these feature live performances of the brothers, one filmed at Blackpool, one at Scarborough, one at Darlington, and the other at York. The &quot;Chuckle Brothers in Trouble&quot; DVD filmed at York was a &quot;rehearsal&quot; performance. There is also a box set of &quot;Pirates of the River Rother&quot; and &quot;Spooky Goings On&quot;, released in 2008.

<doc id="771876" wikidata="Q1142029" url="?curid=771876" title="Crumpet">
<text>A crumpet () is a small griddle bread made from an unsweetened batter of water or milk, flour, and yeast, popular in the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and South Africa.

Historically, crumpets are also regionally known as pikelets, however this is limited as pikelets are more widely known as a thinner, more pancake-like griddle bread; a type of the latter is referred to as a &quot;crumpet&quot; in Scotland.

==History and etymology==

Crumpets have been variously described as originating in Wales or as part of the Anglo-Saxon diet, based on proposed etymologies of the word. In either case, breads were, historically, commonly cooked on a griddle wherever bread ovens were unavailable. The &quot;bara-planc&quot;, or griddle bread, baked on an iron plate over a fire, was part of the everyday diet in Wales until the 19th century.

Small, oval pancakes baked in this manner were called &quot;picklets&quot;, a name used for the first recognisable crumpet-type recipe, published in 1769 by Elizabeth Raffald in &quot;The Experienced English Housekeeper&quot;. This name was derived from the Welsh or &quot;pitchy [i.e., dark or sticky] bread&quot;, later shortened simply to &quot;&quot;. The early 17th century lexicographer Randle Cotgrave referred to &quot;&quot;popelins&quot;, soft bread of fine flour, &amp;c., fashioned like our Welsh &quot;barrapycleds&quot;&quot;.

The word spread initially to the West Midlands of England, where it became anglicised as &quot;pikelet&quot;, and subsequently to Cheshire, Lancashire, Yorkshire, and other areas of the north; crumpets are still referred to as &quot;pikelets&quot; in some areas. The word &quot;crumpet&quot; itself, of unclear origin, first appears in relatively modern times; it has been suggested as referring to a crumpled or curled-up cake, based on an isolated 14th century reference to a &quot;crompid cake&quot;, and the Old English word &#x27; (&#x27;crumpled&#x27;) being used to gloss Latin &#x27;, possibly a type of thin bread.

Alternatively, &quot;crumpet&quot; may be related to the Welsh &#x27; or &#x27;, a type of pancake; Breton &#x27; and Cornish &#x27; for &#x27;pancakes&#x27; are etymologically cognate with the Welsh. An etymology , has also been suggested. However, a correspondent to Manchester &quot;Notes and Queries&quot;, writing in 1883, claimed that the &quot;crampet&quot;, as it was then locally known, simply took its name from the metal ring or &quot;cramp&quot; used to retain the batter during cooking.

The early crumpets were hard pancakes cooked on a griddle, rather than the soft and spongy crumpets of the Victorian era, which were made with yeast. From the 19th century, a little bicarbonate of soda was also usually added to the batter. In modern times, the mass production of crumpets by large commercial bakeries has eroded some regional differences. As late as the 1950s, Dorothy Hartley noted a wide degree of regional variation, identifying the small, thick, spongy type of crumpet specifically with the Midlands.

==Characteristics==

Crumpets are distinguished from similar sized muffins by being made from a batter, rather than a dough. English crumpets are generally circular, roughly in diameter and thick. Their shape comes from being restrained in the pan/griddle by a shallow ring. They have a characteristic flat top with many small pores and a spongy texture which allows butter or other spreads to permeate.

Crumpets may be cooked until ready to eat warm from the pan, but are also left slightly undercooked and then toasted. While premade commercial versions are available in most supermarkets, freshly home-made crumpets are less heavy and doughy in texture. They are usually eaten with a spread of butter, or with other sweet or savoury toppings.

While in some areas of the country the word &quot;pikelet&quot; is synonymous with the crumpet, in others (such as Staffordshire and Yorkshire) it refers to a different recipe. A pikelet is distinguished by containing no yeast as a raising agent and by using a thinner batter than a crumpet; and as being cooked without a ring, giving a flatter result than a crumpet. In Stoke-on-Trent, pikelets were once sold in the town&#x27;s many oatcake shops and still are. A 1932 recipe for Staffordshire pikelets specifies that they were made with flour and buttermilk, with bicarbonate of soda as a raising agent, and suggests cooking them using bacon fat.

The term &quot;pikelet&quot; is used in Australian and New Zealand cuisine for a smaller version, served cold or just warm from the pan, of what in Scotland and North America would be called a pancake and, in England, a Scotch pancake, girdle or griddle cake, or drop scone.

==Scottish crumpet==
A Scottish crumpet is broadly similar to the crumpet of parts of Northern England. It is made from the same ingredients as a Scotch pancake, and is about diameter and thick. It is available plain, or as a fruit crumpet with raisins baked in, usually fried in a pan and served with a fried breakfast. It is also sometimes served with butter and jam. The ingredients include a leavening agent, usually baking powder, and different proportions of eggs, flour, and milk, which create a thin batter. Unlike a pancake, it is cooked to brown on one side only, resulting in a smooth darker side where it has been heated by the griddle, then lightly cooked on the other side which has holes where bubbles have risen to the surface during cooking.

==Ireland==
While now relatively uncommon in Ireland, crumpets were once produced by Boland&#x27;s Bakery in Dublin during the 19th and much of the 20th centuries; Boland&#x27;s recipe was subsequently used by a number of other bakeries. Irish crumpets differed from most British recipes by having a yeastless batter and being cooked on both sides, giving a smooth rather than spongy top.

<text>Antonio de Torres Jurado (13 June 1817 – 19 November 1892) was a Spanish guitarist and luthier, and &quot;the most important Spanish guitar maker of the 19th century.&quot;

It is with his designs that the first recognizably modern classical guitars are to be seen. Most acoustic guitars in use today are derivatives of his designs.

==Biography==

Antonio de Torres was the son of Juan Torres, a local tax collector, and Maria Jurado. As was common, when he was 12 he started an apprenticeship as a carpenter. In 1833, a dynastic war broke out, and soon after Torres was conscripted into the army. Through his father&#x27;s machinations, young Antonio was dismissed as medically unfit for service. As only single men and widowers without children were subject to conscription, in 1835 his family pushed Torres into a hastily arranged marriage to Juana María López, the 13-year-old daughter of a shopkeeper. Children soon followed: a daughter in 1836, another in 1839, and a third in 1842, who died a few months later. His second daughter also died. In 1845 his wife died at the age of 23, of tuberculosis. These were difficult years for Torres, who was often in debt and forced to look for more lucrative forms of employment.

Although there is some debate as to who taught Torres, one theory is that sometime around 1842, Torres may have gone to work for José Pernas in Granada, rapidly learning to build guitars. He soon returned to Seville and opened a shop on the Calle de Cerrajería No. 7 that he shared with Manuel Soto y Solares. Although he made some guitars during the 1840s, it was not until the 1850s on the advice of the guitarist and composer Julián Arcas, that Torres made it his profession, and he began building in earnest. Julián Arcas offered Torres advice on building, and their collaboration turned Torres into an inveterate investigator of the guitar construction. Torres reasoned that the soundboard was key. To increase its volume, he not only made his guitars larger, but fitted them with thinner, hence lighter soundboards that were arched in both directions, made possible by a system of fan bracing for strength. These bracing struts were laid out geometrically, based on two isosceles triangles joined at their base creating a kite shape, within which the struts were set out symmetrically.
While Torres was not the first to use this method he was the one who perfected the symmetrical design. To prove that it was the top, and not the back and sides of the guitar that gave the instrument its sound, in 1862 he built a guitar with back and sides of papier-mâché. (This guitar resides in the Museu de la Musica in Barcelona, and before the year 2000 it was restored to playable condition by the brothers Yagüe, Barcelona).

There is an anecdote about how he had made a guitar made like a Chinese puzzle that could be assembled without glue and disassembled would fit in a shoe box. There is no evidence that he ever made such a guitar though.

During his later years, Torres&#x27;s close friend, a priest named Juan Martínez Sirvent, lent him a hand in his workshop. Many years later, in 1931 Sirvent wrote a letter to Francisco Rodríguez Torres, mentioning the following explanation Torres made when he, at the age of 68 was asked by the famous father Garzón at a dinner about his &quot;secret&quot; of how to make his outstandingly sounding guitars:

&quot;[...] smilingly [Torres] responded: &#x27;Father, I am very sorry that a man like you also falls victim to that idea that runs among ignorant people, Juanito (that is how he addressed me) has been witness to the secret many times, but it is impossible for me to leave the secret behind for posterity; this will go to the tomb with me for it is the result of the feel of the tips of the thumb and forefinger communicating to my intellect whether the soundboard is properly worked out to correspond with the guitar maker&#x27;s concept and the sound required of the instrument&#x27;. Everyone was left convinced that the artistic genius cannot be passed on [...]&quot;

In 1868, Torres married again, wedding Josefa Martín Rosada. Shortly after, Torres met Francisco Tárrega for the first time. Tárrega, who was then aged seventeen, had come to Seville from Barcelona to buy a Torres guitar from the maker of Julián Arcas&#x27; instrument. Torres offered him a modest guitar he had in stock, but on hearing him play, offered him a much better guitar that he had made for himself a few years before.

About 1870, Torres, who was then in his 50s, closed his shop in Seville and moved back to Almería where he and his wife opened up a china and crystal shop on the Calle Real. About five years later, Torres began his &quot;second epoch&quot; (as he referred to it on the labels of his guitars), building part-time when not busy in the china shop. After the death of his wife Josefa, in 1883, Torres began to devote increasing amounts of time to building guitars, making somewhere around 12 guitars a year until his death in La Cañada de San Urbano, Almería at the age of 75.

==Guitars==
Torres guitars are divided into two periods: the first belonging to Sevilla from 1852 to 1870, the second being the years 1871–1893 in Almería. The guitars Torres made were so superior to those of his contemporaries that their example changed the way guitars were built, first in Spain, and then in the rest of the world. Although they are not particularly loud by modern standards, they have a clear, balanced, firm, and rounded tone that projects very well. His guitars were widely imitated and copied. Because he never signed his guitars, and only numbered those from his second epoch, many fake Torres have been made, some by well-known and expert makers.

While the overall pattern of the modern classical guitar derives from Torres, there are some differences between Torres&#x27;s classical guitars and the modern instrument. Torres&#x27;s guitars all had soundboards of European spruce; now western red cedar is also frequently used. Luthiers have continued to develop the bracing of the soundboard, but most still use some version of the fan-bracing that Torres&#x27;s pioneered. Torres&#x27;s guitars were strung with gut trebles and basses of silk threads, overwound with silver. Since the 1950s almost all classical guitars have been strung with nylon. The tuning heads of Torres&#x27;s guitars were often set with traditional ebony friction pegs, similar to those of other string instruments. His later instruments were fitted with mechanical tuners, which are universal on classical guitars today.

==Inventory of guitars==

This is an incomplete list of guitars made by Antonio de Torres.
* The Romeros have five Torres guitars of uncertain year. Pepe Romero owns three Torres guitars (including the FE03 of 1856); Celin Romero and Angel Romero each own one.
* FE 04 &quot;La Leona&quot; (1856) - owned by Erhard Hannen, now is being played by Wulfin Lieske. 
* FE 09 (1859) - owned by Miguel Llobet, now in the collection of the Museu de la Música de Barcelona, Spain
* Sevilla, 1862 - Collection of José Luis Postigo 
* FE 13 (1860): owned by Miguel Llobet, who often used it in concerts in Germany together with the FE09 (1859). Llobet sold it in the first half of the 1920s to Hermann Hauser I, who kept it throughout his life, drawing inspiration from it for the development of his famous guitar of 1937. The guitar is a rare example of the originality of the guitar concept that Torres carried forward in the First Epoch period as it has never undergone restoration and is still in the condition in which its maker left it. The guitar is currently part of the Raccosta Collection (Verona, Italy);
* FE 17 (1864) - initially made by Torres for his personal use, acquired by Francisco Tárrega in Seville, in 1869. The back and ribs were made from flamed maple. Sold by Vicente Tárrega (brother of Francisco Tárrega) to Domingo Prat in 1917.
* Almería, 1864 - Collection of Félix Manzanero
*FE 18 (1864), presently owned by James Westbrook, www.theguitarmuseum.com
* FE 28 (1868) - Collection of Marcos Villanueva
* SE 49 (1883) - owned by Francisco Tárrega
* SE 52 (1883) - owned by Angel Romero.
* SE 70 &quot;La Invencible&quot; (1884)
* SE 107 (1887) - now is being played by Stefano Grondona.
* SE 114 (1888) - owned by Francisco Tárrega, now in the collection of Sheldon Urlik
* SE 116 &quot;La Itálica&quot; (1888) - Once owned by Leon Farre, one of the great enthusiasts of the Barcelona guitar world in the first half of the 20th century. Due to its particular sound qualities, the guitar received special attention from Miguel Llobet, Domingo Prat, Emilio Pujol and other guitar enthusiasts. Due to the beauty of its voice, Prat and Pujol gave it the nickname “La Italica”, while Llobet christened it with the epithet “La Leona de Farre”, in honour of its owner Leon Farre. The guitar later belonged to the Barcelona luthier Enrique Coll (a student of Simplicio and a mentor to Fleta). The guitar seems to have come out of a time machine, as it has never undergone restoration and is still in the original condition in which Torres left it in 1888. The guitar currently belongs to the Raccosta Collection (Verona, Italy);
* SE 124 (1888) - Once owned by Regino Sainz de la Maza, restored and owned by luthier R. E. Bruné. Nearly identical to SE 114 but with birds eye maple sides and back.

<doc id="771892" wikidata="Q275160" url="?curid=771892" title="Ficus benjamina">
<text>Ficus benjamina, commonly known as weeping fig, benjamin fig or ficus tree, and often sold in stores as just ficus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Moraceae, native to Asia and Australia. It is the official tree of Bangkok. The species is also naturalized in the West Indies and in the states of Florida and Arizona in the United States. Its small fruit are favored by some birds. Ficus tree has shown to have environmental benefits in urban areas like being a biomonitor. The plant also has allergens associated with it. 

==Description==
&quot;Ficus benjamina&quot; is a tree reaching tall in natural conditions, with gracefully drooping branchlets and glossy leaves , oval with an acuminate tip. The bark is light gray and smooth. The bark of young branches is brownish. The widely spread, highly branching tree top often covers a diameter of . It is a relatively small-leaved fig. The changeable leaves are simple, entire and stalked. The petiole is long. The young foliage is light green and slightly wavy, the older leaves are green and smooth; the leaf blade is ovate to ovate-lanceolate with wedge-shaped to broadly rounded base and ends with a short dropper tip. The pale glossy to dull leaf blade is cm long and wide. Near the leaf margins are yellow crystal cells (&quot;cystolites&quot;). The two membranous, deciduous stipules are not fused, lanceolate and (rarely to ) long.

&quot;F. benjamina&quot; is monoecious. The inflorescences are spherical to egg-shaped, shiny green, and have a diameter of . In the inflorescences are three types of flowers: male and fertile and sterile female flowers. The scattered, inflorescences, stalked, male flowers have free sepals and a stamen. Many fertile female flowers are sessile and have three or four sepals and an egg-shaped ovary. The more or less lateral style ends in an enlarged scar. Pollination of F. benjamina only occurs with a specific type of wasp that live symbiotically together. 

The ripe figs (collective fruit) are orange-red and have a diameter of .

The tree is treated as an ornamental bush and indoor plant in many places. But it is one of the best shade trees. It can grow to enormous size. Its capability of carbon sequestration is also good.

==Cultivation==
In tropical, subtropical and warm temperate latitudes, the weeping fig makes a very large and stately tree for parks and other urban situations, such as wide roads. It is often cultivated for this purpose, such as in Bourbong Street Weeping Figs in Bundaberg, where it is heritage listed. 

&quot;F. benjamina&quot; is a very popular houseplant in temperate areas because of its elegant growth and tolerance of poor growing conditions; it does best in bright, sunny conditions, but it also tolerates considerable shade. It requires a moderate amount of watering in summer and only enough to keep it from drying out in the winter. Longer days, rather high daytime and moderate night-time temperatures constitute favorable conditions for appreciable growth in a short time. It does not need to be misted. The plant is sensitive to cold and should be protected from strong drafts. When grown indoors, it can grow too large for its location and may need drastic pruning or replacing. &quot;F. benjamina&quot; has been shown to effectively remove gaseous formaldehyde from indoor air. &quot;F.&quot; &quot;benjamina&quot; also helps eliminate heavy metals most commonly in urban areas. The plant has been used as a biomonitor in New Mexico. 

Figs tend to be consumed dried. The fruit is edible, but the plant is not usually grown for its fruit. The leaves have been known to have pharmaceutical benefits like anti-oxidant. The leaves are very sensitive to small changes in light. When it is turned around or relocated, it reacts by dropping many of its leaves and replacing them with new leaves adapted to the new light intensity. The plant is also sensitive to changes in other environmental factors such as temperature, humidity and relocation (citation needed).
===Cultivars===
Numerous cultivars are available (e.g. &#x27;Danielle&#x27;, &#x27;Naomi&#x27;, &#x27;Exotica&#x27;, and &#x27;Golden King&#x27;). Some cultivars include different patterns of colouration on the leaves, ranging from light green to dark green, and various forms of white variegation. In cultivation in the UK, this plant and the variegated cultivar &#x27;Starlight&#x27; have gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit. The miniature cultivars, especially &#x27;Too Little&#x27;, are among the most popular plants for indoor bonsai.

==Destructive roots and hurricane propensity==
The United States Forest Service states, &quot;Roots grow rapidly, invading gardens, growing under and lifting sidewalks, patios, and driveways.&quot; They conclude that its use in tree form is too large for residential planting, therefore, the species should only be used as a hedge or clipped screen.

These trees are also considered a high risk for succumbing to storm gale winds in hurricane-prone South Florida. As a consequence, in many jurisdictions in South Florida, no permit is needed for removal of these trees. The South Florida Water District recommends removing them safely and promptly.

==Allergic reactions==
The plant is a major source of indoor allergens, ranking as the third-most common cause of indoor allergies after dust and pets. Common allergy symptoms include rhinoconjunctivitis and allergic asthma. &quot;Ficus&quot; plants can be of particular concern to latex allergy sufferers because of the latex in the plants and should not be kept in the environment of latex allergy sufferers. In extreme cases, &quot;Ficus&quot; sap exposure can cause anaphylactic shock in latex allergy sufferers. The consumption of parts of plants leads to nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Exceptions are the edible fruits.

Allergy to &quot;Ficus&quot; plants develops over time and from exposure. The allergy was first observed in occupational settings amongst workers who regularly handled the plants. A study of workers at four plant-leasing firms showed that 27% of the workers had developed antibodies in response to exposure to the plants.

<text>Shibaozhai () is a hill along the bank of the Yangtze River (Chang Jiang) in Zhong County, Chongqing, China. This rocky and craggy hill has extremely steep sides and is about tall. On the river side is a red pavilion which leans against the side of the hill providing a walkway to the temple at the top. The red pavilion built against the rock face is one of the largest wooden temples with nine floors. A yellow entrance at the base of the pavilion provides access.

==History==
At the top of Shibaozhai is a three-storied hall dedicated to Manjusri built during the reign of the Xianfeng Emperor (1850–1861), called the Purple Rain Pavilion. In the year 1819, the nine-story pavilion was constructed adjacent to the cliff to aid people in getting to the top of the hill. Prior to the construction of the pavilion, visitors to the temple were hoisted to the top using a system of chains. In 1956, three more stories were added at the top of the structure. On the top of the pagoda is a Buddhist temple.

==Current==
At the base of the hill alongside the river bank is a row of merchant stalls which follows the path from the dock to the entrance of the pavilion.

Many river cruise boats dock at Shibaozhai for a few hours to allow passengers to tour the pavilion and temple.

With the construction of the Three Gorges Dam the base of the red pavilion would have been beneath the reservoir&#x27;s water level in earlier designs.

<doc id="771897" wikidata="Q226085" url="?curid=771897" title="Popular Orthodox Rally">
<text>The Popular Orthodox Rally or People&#x27;s Orthodox Alarm (Greek: Λαϊκός Ορθόδοξος Συναγερμός, &quot;Laikós Orthódoxos Synagermós&quot;), often abbreviated to LAOS (ΛΑ.Ο.Σ.) as a reference to the Greek word for &quot;people&quot;, is a Greek right-wing populist political party. It was founded by journalist Georgios Karatzaferis in 2000, a few months after he was expelled from the centre-right New Democracy. Today, the party is led by Philippos Kampouris.

In 2004, LAOS secured support from the Party of Hellenism and the Hellenic Women&#x27;s Political Party. In 2005, LAOS absorbed the nationalist Hellenic Front. The youth branch of LAOS is the Youth of the Orthodox Rally (NEOS) (which is also a pun on the word for &quot;youth&quot; in Greek). The Popular Orthodox Rally was a member of the Europe of Freedom and Democracy (EFD) group in the European Parliament during the 7th European Parliament, and was a member of the Alliance of Independent Democrats in Europe, a European political party, until the AIDE&#x27;s dissolution in 2008.

The party failed to reach the 3% threshold of the popular vote in the 2004 elections, with 2.2%; three months later it gained 4.12% of the vote and one seat in the 2004 European Parliamentary Elections. LAOS received 3.8% of the vote in the 2007 elections, electing 10 members of parliament. In 2009 LAOS managed to elect two representatives in the European Parliament, receiving 7.14% of the vote. After receiving 5.63% of the vote and electing 15 members of parliament in the 2009 elections, LAOS dropped below the 3% threshold in 2012 and failed to secure any seats in parliament. On 8 April 2016 LAOS joined the alliance National Unity. The party did not contest the 2019 elections or the May 2023 or June 2023 Greek legislative election.

High profile members, such as Makis Voridis, Thanos Plevris and Adonis Georgiadis, have since joined New Democracy, all three becoming ministers in the Cabinet of Kyriakos Mitsotakis, in what has been described as a &quot;LAOSification&quot; of the latter. Prior to the 2023 Greek legislative election, the party&#x27;s founder and long-time president, Georgios Karatzaferis, praised Mitsotakis, calling him &quot;the best politician of the century&quot;.

==Ideology==

According to the Popular Orthodox Rally, &quot;the of the political world into the Right wing and the Left wing is no longer relevant after the end of the Cold War. Nowadays, everyone in every aspect of his or her everyday life is either in favour or against Globalization&quot;. The party claims to consist of radically diverse groups that span the entire left-right political spectrum. Party president Karatzaferis, speaking on the 6th anniversary of the party&#x27;s creation, stated &quot;We are united in the only party that has in its ranks labourers and scientists, workers and the unemployed, leftists and rightists&quot;.

Karatzaferis has described the Popular Orthodox Rally as &quot;a profoundly democratic party&quot;, consisting of everything from a &quot;pre-dictatorship Right&quot; to a merger of Left and Right to a &quot;Popular Liberalism&quot; in official party literature. He has also stated that he supports &quot;patriotism and social solidarity, taking from all ideologies and personalities I like. I don&#x27;t care if it&#x27;s called communism, liberalism or socialism.&quot;

However, the Popular Orthodox Rally is often characterized by opposing politicians and in the media as &quot;far-right&quot;, &quot;populist&quot;, &quot;radical right&quot;, &quot;right-wing&quot; and &quot;nationalist&quot;. It has also been argued that its founding declaration (now withdrawn from the web) included antidemocratic, anti-parliamentary ideas, and the proposal that decisions should be taken by a council, which would include military officers and Church officials. The Popular Orthodox Rally began as a party with an Orthodox Christian religious identity, but also one with a radically nationalist political identity. Although it has since allegedly tried to &#x27;moderate&#x27; the nationalist part of its appeal, with some of an extreme-nationalist or neo-fascist bent, such as Konstantinos Plevris, then leaving the party to join Patriotic Alliance or other fringe political organizations, more extreme-nationalists have recently once again joined its ranks and been elected to parliament. Of the ten Popular Orthodox Rally candidates who entered the parliament in 2007, four are considered to be part of the &quot;nationalist bloc&quot;: Makis Voridis, &quot;Thanos&quot; Plevris, Adonis Georgiadis, and Kiriakos Velopoulos.

Amid the Greek government-debt crisis, the party supported the first bail-out in 2010 (the only parliamentary party apart from the governing PASOK), but thereafter voted against PASOK government on crucial votes, including the 29 June 2011 vote on austerity measures. After George Papandreou resigned in November 2011, LAOS participated along with PASOK and the ND in the government of national unity (the Papademos cabinet), but resigned from the government in February 2012 due to further austerity measures and amid declining popularity in polls. LAOS failed to win any seats in the 2012 Greece parliamentary election, which can be attributed to its previous indecisive position.

==Platform==
The main points of the Popular Orthodox Rally platform are as follows:

* No accession of Turkey to the European Union
* Ban immigration from outside the European Union and deport all illegal immigrants.
* Opposition to the European Constitution and the Lisbon Treaty
* A strict stance in the Macedonia naming dispute; no recognition of the Republic of Macedonia under any name that includes the term &quot;Macedonia.&quot;
* Drastic tax cuts for both individuals and small businesses.

<text>Vallecas was a municipality of Spain that disappeared as such in 1950, when its annexation to the municipality of Madrid took place. Nowadays, the territory is roughly occupied by two districts: Puente de Vallecas (population 240,917) and Villa de Vallecas (population 65,162).

==Overview==
Vallecas is known for its working-class inhabitants who have given it the local names Vallekas or Valle del Kas. Many initiatives that take place in the district show this countercultural attitude by replacing the letter &quot;c&quot; with &quot;k&quot;, examples of these are the local radio station Radio Vallekas, the local television channel Tele K, the music festival Vallekas Rock, etc.

The local pride coalesces around the Rayo Vallecano football team.

During the 1960s, many Spanish immigrants to the Madrid conurbation settled in Vallecas, forming the largest slum area around Madrid.

During the decades of the Francoist State, Vallecas earned its reputation as a neighbourhood of resistance against Francoism.

In this tradition, Vallecas is also home to the Spanish ska band Ska-P, noted for its anarchist and leftist lyrics.

In recent years, the district of Vallecas Villa has experienced significant growth with about 25,000 new flats and houses called &quot;PAU de Vallecas&quot; or &quot;Ensanche de Vallecas&quot;, one of the biggest new areas in Madrid.

Professional footballer Álvaro Negredo is Vallecas&#x27; most famous export. Nicknamed &quot;The Beast of Vallecas&quot;, Negredo currently plays for Valladolid. The famous lightweight boxer Poli Díaz, nicknamed &quot;The Colt of Vallecas&quot;, also comes from this renowned working-class neighbourhood. Atlético Madrid and Spain national team midfielder Koke was also born in Vallecas.

<doc id="771916" wikidata="Q653848" url="?curid=771916" title="World map">
<text>A world map is a map of most or all of the surface of Earth. World maps, because of their scale, must deal with the problem of projection. Maps rendered in two dimensions by necessity distort the display of the three-dimensional surface of the Earth. While this is true of any map, these distortions reach extremes in a world map. Many techniques have been developed to present world maps that address diverse technical and aesthetic goals.

Charting a world map requires global knowledge of the Earth, its oceans, and its continents. From prehistory through the Middle Ages, creating an accurate world map would have been impossible because less than half of Earth&#x27;s coastlines and only a small fraction of its continental interiors were known to any culture. With exploration that began during the European Renaissance, knowledge of the Earth&#x27;s surface accumulated rapidly, such that most of the world&#x27;s coastlines had been mapped, at least roughly, by the mid-1700s and the continental interiors by the twentieth century.

Maps of the world generally focus either on political features or on physical features. Political maps emphasize territorial boundaries and human settlement. Physical maps show geographical features such as mountains, soil type, or land use. Geological maps show not only the surface, but characteristics of the underlying rock, fault lines, and subsurface structures. Choropleth maps use color hue and intensity to contrast differences between regions, such as demographic or economic statistics.

==Map projections==
All world maps are based on one of several map projections, or methods of representing a globe on a plane. All projections distort geographic features, distances, and directions in some way. The various map projections that have been developed provide different ways of balancing accuracy and the unavoidable distortion inherent in making world maps.

Perhaps the best-known projection is the Mercator Projection, originally designed as a nautical chart.
==Thematic maps==

A thematic map shows geographical information about one or a few focused subjects. These maps &quot;can portray physical, social, political, cultural, economic, sociological, agricultural, or any other aspects of a city, state, region, nation, or continent&quot;.
==Historical maps==

Early world maps cover depictions of the world from the Iron Age to the Age of Discovery and the emergence of modern geography during the early modern period. Old maps provide information about places that were known in past times, as well as the philosophical and cultural basis of the map, which were often much different from modern cartography. Maps are one means by which scientists distribute their ideas and pass them on to future generations.

<doc id="771921" wikidata="Q1587360" url="?curid=771921" title="Letter box">
<text>A letter box, letterbox, letter plate, letter hole, mail slot or mailbox is a receptacle for receiving incoming mail at a private residence or business. For outgoing mail, post boxes are often used for depositing the mail for collection, although some letter boxes are also capable of holding outgoing mail for a carrier to pick up. 
Letterboxes or mailboxes use the following primary designs:
* A slot in a wall or door through which mail is delivered (through-door delivery)
* A box attached directly to the building (direct-to-door delivery)
* A box mounted at or near the street (curbside delivery)
* A centralised mail delivery station consisting of individual mailboxes for an entire building also known as a &quot;flock&quot; throughout the South Island of New Zealand and parts of America.
* A centralised mail delivery station consisting of individual mailboxes for multiple recipients at multiple addresses in a particular neighborhood or community

==Styles and usage==
A &quot;letter box&quot;, or &quot;mail slot&quot; in American and Canadian usage, is a slot, usually horizontal but sometimes vertical, about 30 cm by 5 cm (12 inches by 2 inches), cut through the middle or lower half of a front door. This style is almost universal in British homes and offices, but in the US is limited primarily to urban areas. Most are covered by a or seal on the outside for weatherproofing. The flap may be closed by gravity, or sprung to prevent it opening and closing noisily in the wind. Some letterboxes also have a second flap on the inside to provide further protection from the elements. There may also be a small cage or box mounted on the inside of the door to receive the delivered mail. Mail slots are limited to receiving incoming mail, as most have no provision for securing and protecting outgoing mail for pickup by the mail carrier. Sending mail from private addresses is possible in the UK, but Royal Mail usually charge an extra per-item fee for this service.
Wall-mounted or attached mailboxes may also be used in place of mail slots, usually located close to the front door of the residence. They are known as &quot;full-service&quot; mailboxes when they have provisions for securing outgoing as well as incoming mail. Attached wall-mounted mailboxes are still used in older urban and suburban neighbourhoods in North America. They are especially common in urban and suburban areas of Canada, where the curbside mailbox is rarely seen except in rural areas. Attached mailboxes are less common in newer urban and suburban developments and in rural areas of the United States, where curbside delivery or delivery to a community mail station (cluster mailbox, known as a bank of post boxes in the UK) is generally used.

Rural and some suburban areas of North America may utilize curbside mailboxes, also known as rural mailboxes. These receptacles generally consist of a large metal box mounted on a support designed primarily to receive large quantities of incoming mail, often with an attached flag to signal the presence of outgoing mail to the mail carrier. In the US and Canada, rural curbside mailboxes may be found grouped together at property boundaries or road/driveway intersections, depending upon conditions. Although the United States Postal Service (USPS) has general regulations stating the distance a letter box may be from the road surface, these requirements may be changed by the local postmaster according to local environment and road conditions.

At one time, nearly 843,000 rural Canadian residents used rural (curbside) mailboxes for private mail delivery, though Canada Post has since required the installation of community mailbox stations for many rural residents.

In the US, wall-mounted or curbside mailboxes that are only designed for receiving incoming mail are known as &quot;limited-service&quot; mailboxes, while mailboxes equipped with a mechanism for notifying the postman to collect outgoing mail from the mailbox are known as &quot;full service&quot; mailboxes.

A number of designs of letterboxes and mailboxes have been patented, particularly in the United States. One design was the visible mailbox (because it was made of transparent glass) with a flip-up aluminium lid produced during the first part of the 20th century by George F. Collins of the Barlet-Collins Glass Company in Sapulpa, Oklahoma.

==Letter box standards and construction==
===Europe===
The European standard for letter boxes, EN 13724:2002 &quot;Postal services – Apertures of private letter boxes and letter plates – Requirements and test methods&quot;, replaces earlier national standards such as BS 2911:1974 &quot;Specification for letter plates&quot; or DIN 32617. It specifies among other things:
* Envelope size C4 (229 mm × 324 mm) must be deliverable without bending or damage
* The internal volume must able to hold at least a 40 mm high bundle of C4 envelopes
* width of either 230–280 mm (&gt; C4 width) or 325–400 mm (&gt; C4 height)
* Aperture height of 30–35 mm
* Mounting height of between 0.7 and 1.7 m for the aperture
* When positioned externally, the post box should not allow more than 1% total capacity water ingress from natural precipitation or moisture causes.
* Various privacy, theft-protection, vandalism resistance and corrosion-resistance test requirements

This Standard is voluntary. It was developed by a German mail boxes manufacturer Burg Wächter and it reflects this manufacturer&#x27;s technical capability and commercial interests with a number of the specifications unfounded, for example, aperture dimensions or internal volume, while the vital issues of security, energy saving, and environmental issues of a property and the occupants are not addressed in the Standard.

Although the Standard was due for a review after 5 years in 2007, this did not happen. In April 2013 the amended Standard BS EN 13724:2013 was finally published, however, again it was drafted by the same company and is nearly word-for-word copy of the old EN 13724:2002 Standard. The essential amendments (especially important for the UK) were not included again and the interests of security, energy saving and wellbeing of the public were not addressed.

===Canada===
For those neighbourhoods where mail delivery is to a mail slot, the mail slot must have an opening not less than 17.5 cm by 4 cm, and must be located in a front door or adjacent panel not more than 125 cm and not less than 60 cm from the finished floor line. Wall-mounted mailboxes equipped with a slot must have a slot opening measurement not less than 13.5 cm by 4 cm and the slot located on or near the top of the box.

Curbside mailboxes, known in Canada as rural mailboxes, must be weatherproof, have space for the name of the mailbox owner, and possess a signal device on the right-hand side (when facing the front of the mailbox) for pickup of outgoing mail. The signal device must rise above the mailbox and be visible at a distance, and must not obscure the mailbox owner&#x27;s name or impede vehicular or pedestrian traffic. Canada Post requires all rural mailboxes to have a minimum interior dimensions of 45 cm in length by 17.5 cm in width by 17.5 cm in height for a rectangular mailbox, and 45 cm in length by 25 cm in diameter in the case of a cylindrical mailbox.

===United States===

The US Post Office has established guidelines for mail recipients, including mail slot or mailbox size, location, and identification requirements. While the Post Office permitted alternative designs for attached mailboxes and mail slots that met basic size and construction requirements, the same was not true for curbside mailboxes, which postal regulations required be in the form of the traditional dome-rectangular or &#x27;tunnel-top&#x27; design first established in 1915. In 1978, seven years after the establishment of the restructured US Postal Service, postal authorities at last approved a &quot;contemporary&quot; mailbox specification for alternative designs.

Currently, US curbside mailboxes are classified as (T) Traditional, (C) Contemporary, or (L) Locking. Traditional or Contemporary non-locking curbside mailboxes are approved in three sizes - No. 1, No. 2, or No. 3, measured by minimum interior dimensions. The largest acceptable curbside mailbox is the No. 3, which measures 22.81 inches long, 11 inches wide, and 15 inches in height (58 cm x 28 cm x 38 cm) at the peak. Locking mailbox designs that provide security for the recipient&#x27;s incoming mail have fewer restrictions on shape and size, though designs with a slot for incoming mail must be at least 1.75 inches high by 10 inches wide. Residential locking mailboxes cannot require the postal carrier to have a key, by USPS Specifications. Therefore, no USPS approved residential locking mailbox has secure outgoing mail. Installation requirements vary from standard unlocked mailboxes: with locking mailboxes, the incoming mail slot must be 41&quot;-45&quot; above the roadside surface, and the front of the mailbox must be 6&quot;-8&quot; back from the curb. USPS specifications for all mailboxes mandate the same, except the placement of the &#x27;incoming mail area&#x27; varies with a locking mailbox.

==Environmental conditions==
External or curbside letter boxes are not temperature-controlled, and this can sometimes be a concern for temperature-sensitive products such as pharmaceuticals, live plants or other organisms, or chocolate candies. Conditions can include high or low temperatures outside of the recommended storage conditions for certain products. For example, the USFDA found that the temperature in a steel mailbox painted black could reach 136 °F (58 °C) in full sun while the ambient air temperature was 101 °F (38 °C).

==Security==
There is a recommendation to have a lock on the letter box, if it is not built into a lockable door. Unlocked letter boxes are often used for identity theft, including the ordering of something valuable which is then stolen from the unlocked box. In the United States for example, by policy, the USPS will not deliver mail to an unlocked or unsecured box which is located at a centralized mailbox installation.

==History==
===Europe===
Private letterboxes or mail slots did not become popular in most of Europe until the mid to late 19th century, although they were used in Paris from the late 18th century.

In 1849, the Royal Mail first encouraged people to install letterboxes to facilitate the delivery of mail. Before then, letterboxes of a similar design had been installed in the doors and walls of post offices for people to drop off outgoing mail. An example of such a wall box (originally installed in the wall of the Wakefield Post Office) is dated 1809 and believed to be the oldest example in Britain. It is now on display at the new Wakefield Museum.

===North America===

In 1863, with the creation of Free City Delivery, the US Post Office Department began delivering mail to home addresses.

Until 1916, mail carriers knocked on the door and waited for someone to answer. Efficiency experts estimated that each mailman lost over 1.5 hours each day just waiting for patrons to come to the door. To correct this problem, the Post Office Department ordered that every household must have a mail box or letter slot in order to receive mail. This requirement was phased in, starting with new delivery locations, around 1912. Slowly, homeowners and businesses began to install mail slots or attached mailboxes to receive mail when they were either not at home or unable to answer the door. The requirement was made mandatory in 1923.

As early as the 1880s, the Post Office had begun to encourage homeowners to attach wall-mounted mailboxes to the outside of their houses in lieu of mail slots. Mounted at the height of a standing man, attached mailboxes did not require the mail carrier to lean over to deposit the mail. They also allowed the homeowner to keep outgoing mail dry while awaiting pickup by the mail carrier.

To reduce the time required for the mail carrier to complete delivery when the front door of a home was located some distance from the street, it was proposed that individual mail boxes for residential or business customers be mounted curbside on fence-posts, lamp-posts, or other supports. While this idea was rejected for city mail delivery, it was adopted for rural areas. Curbside mailboxes located on a rural route or road and sited at the intersection of the road with each recipient&#x27;s carriageway or private drive allowed limited numbers of mail carriers to deliver mail to many widely scattered farms and ranches in a single day using horse-drawn wagons or later on, motor vehicles.

Before the introduction of rural free delivery (RFD) by the Post Office in 1896, and in Canada in 1908, many rural residents had no access to the mail unless they collected it at a post office located many miles from their homes or hired a private express company to deliver it to them. For this reason, mailboxes did not become popular in rural North America until curbside RFD mail delivery by the Post Office was an established service. Even then, farmers and rural homeowners at first resisted the purchase of dedicated mailboxes, preferring to leave empty bushel baskets, tin boxes, or wooden crates at the roadside for the postman to deposit their mail. Not until 1923 did the Post Office finally mandate that every household install a mailbox or mail slot in order to receive home delivery of mail.

Originally designed only for incoming mail delivery, curbside mailboxes were soon fitted with a semaphore or signal flag mounted on an attached arm to signal the postman to pickup outgoing mail. Originally, this flag was raised not only by the resident of the property to signal the postman of outgoing mail, but also by the postman to inform the recipient that incoming mail had been delivered - a convenience to all during periods of freezing or inclement weather.

Since 1923, in order to promote uniformity, as well as the convenient and rapid delivery of the mail, the United States Post Office Department (later the USPS) has continued to retain authority to approve the size and other characteristics of all mail receptacles, whether mailboxes or mail slots, for use in delivery of the mails. The USPS continues to issue specifications for curbside mailbox construction for use by manufacturers. Approved mailboxes from the latter are always stamped &quot;U.S. Mail&quot; and &quot;Approved by the Postmaster General&quot;. These standards have resulted in limitations on product diversity and design, though new materials, shapes, and features have appeared in recent years.

After World War II, postwar suburban home construction expanded dramatically in the United States, along with mail volume. By the 1960s, many new suburban homes were considerably larger and located on larger lots, yet most still used mail slots or attached wall-mounted mailboxes. This development caused a substantial increase in distances walked by the mail carrier, slowing mail delivery while increasing labor costs. In order to reduce delivery times and increase efficiency, the Post Office began requiring all new suburban developments to install curbside mailboxes in place of door-to-door delivery, allowing mail carriers to remain in the vehicle while delivering the mail. In 1978, the USPS (successor to the Post Office) declared that every new development must have either curbside delivery or centralized mail delivery.

====Joroleman mailbox====
In 1915, the Joroleman mailbox, named after its designer, Post Office employee Roy J. Joroleman, was approved by the U.S. Post Office. Joroleman, who held a degree in mechanical engineering, designed his mailbox with an unusual dome-rectangular shape, incorporating a curved, tunnel-shaped roof, latching door, and rotating semaphore flag. The Joroleman mailbox has been praised as a manifestation of American functionalist industrial design.

Constructed of light-gauge painted sheet steel, Joroleman designed his mailbox with an arched, tunnel-shape roof, which prevented excessive accumulation of rainwater or snow while resisting deformation. The tunnel top also simplified the process of mass production by eliminating the need for precise sheet metal bends. Stamped and formed metal straps riveted to the arched opening and the mailbox door served as a door latching mechanism, while a rotating red semaphore flag mounted on a shaft attached to the side of the mailbox served to signal the approaching mailman if there was outgoing mail inside. Fitted with a crimped or braze-on rear steel panel and a false floor to keep its contents dry in inclement or humid weather, the Joroleman mailbox required only two rivets, three axle bolts, and four screws and nuts for completion. Durable and inexpensive, the popularity of the Joroleman mailbox was further enhanced by a decision not to patent the design, but to make its specifications known to all potential manufacturers for competitive sale. Adopted across the United States, it has remained the top-selling mailbox since its introduction, and was also widely used in Canada prior to that country&#x27;s decision to eliminate individual curbside delivery to rural residents.

The Joroleman mailbox was originally approved for manufacture in one size, the No. 1, which could accommodate letter mail, periodicals, newspapers, catalogs, and small parcels. After July 1, 1916, the Joroleman mailbox would be the only design approved by the Post Office for new curbside mailbox installations. In July 1929, the Post Office approved specifications for a larger Joroleman mailbox known as the No. 2. The No. 2 mailbox, soon followed by the still-larger No. 3, could accept larger parcels and packages sent via Parcel Post; these large boxes proved particularly popular with rural mail recipients, who could order manufactured goods by mail for delivery to the farm or ranch.

==Recent developments==
===Europe===

====Sweden====
KopparStaden AB, a housing cooperative in Falun, Sweden, has begun to install centralized mail stations with individual letterboxes using electronically operated doors in its buildings.

==== United Kingdom ====
Many designs of mailboxes have been created during recent years, with products suitable for both multi-occupancy residences (typically tower block private accommodation properties) and individual homes.

Deliveries of mail are typically made into the mailbox through an entry hole in the mailbox, where it drops into a secured compartment. The deposited items can only be retrieved an individual using a coded key (designed to work only with that particular coded lock), or by entering a number sequence via a combination lock. Electronic locks can also be used with mailboxes, but they must be used in an internal location due to their vulnerability to inclement weather.

Mailboxes are commonly manufactured using zintec steel, aluminium, stainless steel or galvanised steel, and then powder-coated to meet the design requirements of the mail recipient. Mailboxes can also be manufactured using materials including cast iron and plastic, but these are less commonly seen in the United Kingdom. 

The reclamation and reuse of original Royal Mail post boxes in private homes, many stocked and sold by salvage yards, led to questions from the public about the legal position regarding their reuse, which is the subject of expert opinion in a SalvoNEWS story from 2012: &quot;Private use of antique Royal Mail pillar boxes or post boxes&quot;.

Mailboxes have slots, leading to possible vandalism or theft of deposited mail, but additional features are available to help reduce this, such as aperture restrictors, which allow the recipient to adjust the opening on their mailboxes. 

In multi-occupancy buildings, especially new buildings, individual mailboxes are commonly grouped together in one location, allowing delivery people to deposit items without having to visit each individual door.

In 2019 the UK government agreed to ban low-level letter boxes after a campaign from the Royal Mail. However, , the UK government has not taken action to ban low-level letter boxes.

===United States===
Numerous designs of mailboxes with improved construction and security have been patented in recent years, particularly in the United States. In 2001, the USPS first approved designs for locking curbside mailboxes to stem a rise in identity and mail theft. With these secure designs, the incoming mail is placed into a slot or hopper by the mail carrier, where it drops into a secure locked compartment for retrieval by only the homeowner (who retains a key or combination to the lock). Locking mailboxes are generally constructed of heavy-gauge steel or aluminum plate, though some models are made of roto-moulded polymer plastic.

Because of the increased risk of vandalism to curbside mailboxes, numerous vandal-resistant boxes made of composite plastic or heavy-gauge steel or aluminum plate have also entered the market. Some composite mailboxes made of resilient polymer plastics and mounted on ground spikes can resist severe impacts from baseball bats or even being run over by a vehicle.

In 1978, steady increases in postal service costs caused the USPS to insist on either curbside or centralized mail delivery for new suburban neighborhoods and developments. A 1995 cost delivery study published in a USPS Operations handbook listed per-address annual delivery costs as: Door-to-door, $243; Curbside, $154; Cluster/flock Box (centralized mail delivery), $106.

Large apartment buildings usually have a cluster/flock of mailboxes for all units, located in the entry lobby or in a nearby dedicated mailroom. There often is a special lock box (also called a &quot;key keeper&quot; or &quot;Knox box&quot;) located at the outside entrance, which either gives access to a front door key or directly activates the front door electric strike, to allow the mail delivery person to enter the building. A similar &quot;Arrow lock&quot; is usually located on the centralized mailbox, to allow the entire unit to be opened for efficient filling of individual mailboxes.
In the US, a property with a single mailing address but with multiple mail recipients may utilize a community mail station designated CBU, or Cluster Box Unit. CBUs are typically stand-alone units that have locked individual compartments for each tenant in an apartment building, a trailer or mobile home park, or an office center.

By policy, the USPS is reluctant to establish direct to door delivery to new addresses, and now requires special approvals to initiate this service (Postal Operations Manual, Section 631.2) Instead, the USPS has insisted upon centralized mail delivery in virtually all newly constructed residential housing developments, condominiums, and gated communities by requiring or incentivizing the builder or developer to install larger NDCBU (Neighborhood Delivery Collection Box Unit) stations. CBUs and NDCBUs are both commonly known as &quot;cluster mailboxes&quot;. The NDCBU is a centralized community mail station with compartments for the centralized delivery of mail to multiple recipients at multiple addresses within a single neighborhood development or community.

In new housing developments, the NDCBU location is fixed by the developer, not the USPS, and may be located hundreds of yards away from the addressee&#x27;s actual residence. A parcel locker for receipt of packages and a separate compartment for outgoing mail are usually built into the station. The mail carrier will have a key to a large door on one side that reaches all the compartments, and the residents or tenants will each have a key to the door into their individual compartment on the other side.

The location of the NDCBU in a community or business center is extremely important, since neighborhood cluster box installations located in remote or poorly lighted areas invite large-scale mail theft or vandalism. Even when located in a high-traffic location or inside a gated community, the NDCBU is a tempting target for thieves attracted by the possibility of recovering checks, cash, identifying information, or other valuables from multiple victims. A 2008 RAND Corporation study, citing USPS statistics collected between 2004 and 2007, found that NDCBU thefts constituted 52.7% of all urban neighborhood mail thefts and 76.6% of all rural neighborhood mail thefts from locations with more than one mailbox, with higher-income ZIP code zones having a substantially higher number of thefts than low-income ZIP code zones.

===Canada===

In Canada, community mailboxes (or &quot;Supermailboxes&quot;) appeared in the late 1980s in newer suburban areas. Newer developments usually are temporarily supplied with green rural community mail boxes and replaced later with permanent supermailboxes.

Since 2004, many rural Canadian residents have been required to use community mail stations (known as a Community Mail Box, or CMB) instead of individual curbside mailboxes in an attempt to reduce health and safety complaints by Canada Post rural mail carriers. This change has been extended to some suburban areas of the country as well. 

In 2014, in an effort to cut costs, Canada Post announced its intent to phase out door-to-door delivery and adopt community mailboxes in 32% of urban centres. The plan faced criticism, especially due to accessibility concerns. The program was suspended immediately after the election of Justin Trudeau&#x27;s Liberal Party government in 2015—which had promised to cease further cutbacks to Canada Post.

===Australia===
Home Parcel boxes are being used in Australia to facilitate the delivery of parcels ordered over the internet as the letter box declines in use due to emails. Special locking mechanisms with dynamic codes are being used to create a new lock code on every delivery, ensuring greater security from petty theft. These lock codes are accessed by the delivery company using their barcode scanner and a standard barcode or QR code.

== Guinness World Record ==
The largest mailbox in the world is located in Casey, Illinois (US) and measures at . It was created by Jim Bolin and was verified on the 20th of October 2015.

<doc id="771924" wikidata="Q5293134" url="?curid=771924" title="Don Mellett">
<text>Donald Ring Mellett (September 26, 1891 – July 16, 1926) was an American newspaper editor who was assassinated after confronting local organized crime in his newspaper.

Mellett was born in Elwood, Indiana, as the child of a newspaper editor. He followed with the family tradition by becoming a journalist, as did several of his siblings. He studied at Indiana University, where he became the editor of the school&#x27;s newspaper, &quot;The Daily Student&quot; (now the &quot;Indiana Daily Student&quot;).

==Early career==
After leaving college due to illness, Mellett took on work with the &quot;Indianapolis News&quot; and the &quot;National Enquirer&quot;. Some time later, he purchased the &quot;Columbus Ledger&quot;, and began working as its editor, before moving on to a position at &quot;The Akron Press&quot;. Then, in January 1925 he accepted an offer to edit the &quot;Canton Daily News&quot; in Canton, Ohio.

At the time, the &quot;Daily News&quot; was struggling, and had only half the circulation of its rival paper, &quot;The Repository&quot;. He began using the paper to fight local corruption, and was soon successful in pressuring the mayor to suspend the police chief. His efforts also led to the conviction of two underworld figures. Under Mellett, the paper successfully supported a Democratic candidate for mayor, in a town that had traditionally supported Republicans.

==Death==
By May 1926, the newspaper had almost caught up to its rival in terms of circulation, and was closing the gap rapidly. In the weeks leading up to his assassination, Mellett began investigating the murder of a local underworld figure and whistleblower, Paul Kitzig. He accused another underworld figure, Ben Rudner, of the crime, and printed what evidence he could obtain. He began to receive death threats, and hired a bodyguard, but decided to let him go, shortly before he was shot to death in his garage on July 16, 1926, at the age of 34.

L. E. Judd, &quot;The Akron-Press&quot; editor, played a major role in the investigation of the murder.

An early investigation by the local police (of which the integrity was later questioned) turned up nothing, but some time later, Ora Slater, a detective from elsewhere, was successful in resolving the murder. As a result, four people, including not only Rudner, but the Canton police chief at the time, were sentenced to life imprisonment. The police chief was later acquitted.

==Pulitzer Prize==
The year after Mellett&#x27;s death, the &quot;Canton Daily News&quot; was rewarded with the Pulitzer Prize for Public Service for their efforts in fighting corruption. The citation acknowledged Mellett&#x27;s own personal sacrifice. However, after Mellett&#x27;s death, the newspaper returned to decline, and only months after winning the Pulitzer Prize, was bought out by &quot;The Repository&quot;.

The plot of the film &quot;Freedom of the Press&quot; (1928) was based on Mellett&#x27;s death. A teleplay about Mellett, titled &quot;The Canton Story&quot;, was made in 1950. It appeared on October 13, 1950 in &quot;Pulitzer Prize Playhouse&quot;. The Don Mellett Memorial Lecture in Journalism is named in his honor, as is New York University&#x27;s Don R. Mellett Prize. Mellett was inducted into the Indiana Journalism Hall of Fame in 1969. In 1976, the Mellett Historic Site in Journalism was created in Canton. Numerous books have also been written about his life, and an auditorium at Indiana University, his alma mater, was named after him. In addition, Mellett Mall (now Canton Centre) in Canton was formerly named for him.

<text>Mariner Mark II was NASA&#x27;s planned family of uncrewed spacecraft for the exploration of the outer Solar System that were to be developed and operated by JPL between 1980 and 2010.

==Summary==
After the &quot;flagship&quot; multibillion-dollar missions of the 1970s, in the 1980s NASA was looking for a new, more affordable direction for the 1990s and beyond. Two projects were conceived by NASA&#x27;s Solar System Exploration Committee in 1983, the Planetary Observer program, and Mariner Mark II.

The Observer program, starting with the Mars Observer, was envisioned as a series of low-cost missions to the inner Solar System, based on commercial Earth satellites, while the Mariner Mark II was to be a series of large spacecraft for the exploration of the outer Solar System.

Mariner Mark II spacecraft were to use common design, hardware and software solutions, much of it derived from previous missions such as Voyager and Galileo as well as select new technologies, such as advanced gyroscopes, all with the aim of cutting costs. It was hoped that this new approach would reduce the mission costs to about $400 million each, about half the price of Galileo.

The first two missions of the project were to be a mission to Saturn and its moon Titan, the Saturn Orbiter/Titan Probe, or SOTP (later &quot;Cassini&quot;) and the Comet Rendezvous Asteroid Flyby (CRAF), both of which were approved by Congress in 1990.

Other planned Mariner Mark II-based spacecraft were an ESA led follow-on to CRAF, the Comet Nucleus Sample Return or CNSR (later &quot;Rosetta&quot;, without the sample return); &quot;Pluto Fast Flyby&quot;, a flyby of Pluto (later &quot;Pluto Kuiper Express&quot;, eventually realized as &quot;New Horizons&quot;); and a &quot;Neptune Orbiter&quot; with an atmospheric probe.

However, congressionally imposed reductions to FY 1992–93 funding requirements forced NASA to terminate the CRAF mission and to delay the &quot;Cassini&quot; launch from April 1996 to October 1997. In order to save it, NASA was forced to significantly redesign &quot;Cassini&quot; to reduce the total program cost, mass and power requirements.

NASA has had to replace the &quot;Mariner Mark II&quot; program with the lower-cost Discovery Program.

<doc id="771960" wikidata="Q65212" url="?curid=771960" title="Volker Strassen">
<text>Volker Strassen (born April 29, 1936) is a German mathematician, a professor emeritus in the department of mathematics and statistics at the University of Konstanz.

For important contributions to the analysis of algorithms he has received many awards, including the Cantor medal, the Konrad Zuse Medal, the Paris Kanellakis Award for work on randomized primality testing, the Knuth Prize for &quot;seminal and influential contributions to the design and analysis of efficient algorithms.&quot;

==Biography==

Strassen was born on April 29, 1936, in Düsseldorf-Gerresheim.
After studying music, philosophy, physics, and mathematics at several German universities, he received his Ph.D. in mathematics in 1962 from the University of Göttingen under the supervision of . He then took a position in the department of statistics at the University of California, Berkeley while performing his habilitation at the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, where Jacobs had since moved. In 1968, Strassen moved to the Institute of Applied Mathematics at the University of Zurich, where he remained for twenty years before moving to the University of Konstanz in 1988. He retired in 1998.

==Research==
Strassen began his researches as a probabilist; his 1964 paper &quot;An Invariance Principle for the Law of the Iterated Logarithm&quot; defined a functional form of the law of the iterated logarithm, showing a form of scale invariance in random walks. This result, now known as &quot;Strassen&#x27;s invariance principle&quot; or as &quot;Strassen&#x27;s law of the iterated logarithm&quot;, has been highly cited and led to a 1966 presentation at the International Congress of Mathematicians.

In 1969, Strassen shifted his research efforts towards the analysis of algorithms with a paper on Gaussian elimination, introducing Strassen&#x27;s algorithm, the first algorithm for performing matrix multiplication faster than the O(&quot;n&quot;3) time bound that would result from a naive algorithm. In the same paper he also presented an asymptotically fast algorithm to perform matrix inversion, based on the fast matrix multiplication algorithm. This result was an important theoretical breakthrough, leading to much additional research on fast matrix multiplication, and despite later theoretical improvements it remains a practical method for multiplication of dense matrices of moderate to large sizes. In 1971 Strassen published another paper together with Arnold Schönhage on asymptotically fast integer multiplication based on the fast Fourier transform; see the Schönhage–Strassen algorithm. Strassen is also known for his 1977 work with Robert M. Solovay on the Solovay–Strassen primality test, the first method to show that testing whether a number is prime can be performed in randomized polynomial time and one of the first results to show the power of randomized algorithms more generally.

==Awards and honors==
In 1999 Strassen was awarded the Cantor medal, and in 2003 he was co-recipient of the Paris Kanellakis Award with Robert Solovay, Gary Miller, and Michael Rabin for their work on randomized primality testing. In 2008 he was awarded the Knuth Prize for &quot;seminal and influential contributions to the design and analysis of efficient algorithms.&quot; In 2011 he won the Konrad Zuse Medal of the Gesellschaft für Informatik. In 2012 he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.

<doc id="771961" wikidata="Q70613" url="?curid=771961" title="Ernst Torgler">
<text>Ernst Torgler (25 April 1893 – 19 January 1963) was the last chairman of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) faction in the German Reichstag before he worked for the Nazis.

==Early life==
Torgler was born the son of an urban resident in Berlin. There, he attended school from 1904 to 1907, when he joined the Association of Apprentices and Juvenile Workers of Berlin. From 1909 to 1925, he held a variety of different jobs, working most notably as a salesman and accountant. Torgler began his political career in 1910, when he joined the Social Democratic Party. While he served in the military during World War I, Torgler became a member of the Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany in 1917.

==Political career==
In 1920, Torgler joined the Communist Party of Germany when the Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany merged with the KPD. A year later, Torgler became a city councillor in Berlin-Lichtenberg, a position he held until 1930, and he was elected to the Reichstag in the December 1924 election as a member of the KPD.

Torgler then became deputy chairman of the KPD Reichstag faction in 1927 and chairman in 1929, which made him one of the most powerful members of the party. From 1932 to 1933, Torgler published the KPD Reichstag news-sheet &quot;The Red Voter&quot; with Wilhelm Pieck. Torgler&#x27;s political career ended in February 1933, however, because of the Reichstag fire.

==Reichstag fire==
Against the wishes of the KPD leadership, Torgler voluntarily handed himself over to the police on February 28, the day after the fire, when Hermann Göring issued a warrant for his arrest. Torgler was kept in custody, and in July 1933, he was charged with arson and treason. Torgler and his fellow defendants were tried from 21 September to 23 December, when Torgler was acquitted because of a lack of evidence against him.

==Work for Nazis==
After his trial, Torgler was placed into &quot;protective custody&quot; by the police until 1935. The KPD leadership, now in Brussels as a result of being banned by the Nazis, then stripped Torgler of his party membership and leadership positions because of his surrender to the police.

Heinz Linge would recount in his memoirs, published under the title &quot;With Hitler To the End&quot;, that Torgler was eventually released as part of an amnesty offered to the former leaders and pre-eminents of banned parties, on the condition that they make signed statements that they would not partake again in political activity that would be to the detriment of the regime (something that Linge suggested Ernst Thälmann refused to do).

After his release, he lived just outside Berlin under a pseudonym and worked for the Gestapo. In 1938, Torgler worked for Electrolux and was carefully watched by the SD.

In June 1940, Torgler began working for the Nazi Propaganda Ministry. In 1941, after Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union, Torgler worked on anti-Bolshevik propaganda at the behest of Joseph Goebbels. According to Adolf Hitler&#x27;s Valet, Heinz Linge, Torgler renounced Communism in a written letter to Hitler. Linge recounted in his memoirs that Torgler had done this having heard from his son, who had served on the Eastern Front, about the horrid conditions that the &quot;Russian worker&quot; had been enduring under Stalin. He was so appalled by his son&#x27;s testimony that he took it upon himself to pen the letter to his former political rival. Hitler supposedly reacted happily, stating in Linge&#x27;s presence: &quot;We should send all German Communists to Russia, to see the paradise for themselves.&quot;

He was then employed as a real estate auditor in the main trust center East in Graudenz, later in Trebbin. In 1944, after the 20 July Plot against Adolf Hitler, an arrest warrant was issued for Torgler. According to his own statements, a personal intervention by Goebbels prevented his imprisonment. With his office he reached Bückeburg in 1945 on the retreat.

==Postwar==

After World War II, he was denazified and landed a job with the administration of Bückeburg, with help of the US Army. Despite the hard times, Torgler managed to keep himself in a well-paid position. Torgler angrily dismissed charges that he had willingly co-operated with the Nazis.

He tried to join the communists but was rejected. In 1949, he became a member of the Social Democratic Party and in 1950, he moved to Bückeburg, where he drifted into obscurity. He died in Hanover in 1963.

==Son==
His son, Kurt Torgler (1919–1943), was a witness on behalf of his father at the 1933 countertrial in London that was organised by the German Communist Party on the Reichstag fire. In 1935, he went to the Soviet Union. There, he was arrested by the NKVD in 1937 and sent to a labour camp. After the Hitler-Stalin Pact, he was, in 1940, handed over to the German government. He became a translator in the army and died on the Eastern Front.

<text>A chapter house or chapterhouse is a building or room that is part of a cathedral, monastery or collegiate church in which meetings are held. When attached to a cathedral, the cathedral chapter meets there. In monasteries, the whole community often met there daily for readings and to hear the abbot or senior monks talk. When attached to a collegiate church, the dean, prebendaries and canons of the college meet there. The rooms may also be used for other meetings of various sorts; in medieval times monarchs on tour in their territory would often take them over for their meetings and audiences. Synods, ecclesiastical courts and similar meetings often took place in chapter houses.

==Design==

When part of a monastery, the chapter house is generally located on the eastern wing of the cloister, which is next to the church. Since many cathedrals in England were originally monastic foundations, this is a common arrangement there also. Elsewhere it may be a separate building. The chapter house comprises a large space, in order to hold all the monks of the monastery, and is often highly ornamented. Typically there is seating around, often built into, all the walls of the room, often in stone, with the central space left open. The seats for the senior members are often larger than the others, and may be raised on a dais. Usually there is only one doorway, and though the room is well-lit where the location allows, the windows are often too high to allow a view in from outside (or eavesdropping). Many larger chapter houses are designed with vestibules for attendants and those waiting to be called, where opening onto a cloister does not provide such a space. There is often a fireplace, and altars are found in some examples, sometimes added later.

Many medieval rooms use stone vaulting supported by columns in the centre of the space, as used for other more utilitarian large rooms in monasteries with a generous budget. Others have much higher roofs. The shape of the room is usually designed to allow good audibility for speakers from all parts of the room. It may be rectangular, tending towards the square, but octagonal and other near-circular plans are an English speciality, with that at Worcester Cathedral probably the earliest. Most, like those at Wells Cathedral, Lichfield Cathedral, Westminster Abbey and Lacock Abbey, have a single central column from which the high roof vaulting spreads. York Minster has a wooden roof and no central column. Many have elaborate benched arcades round the wall, with crocketed frames for the seats. English chapter houses tend to be more elaborate and highly decorated than Continental ones, and the octagonal shape allowed for spectacular displays of stained glass, now mostly lost, though not at York. Except at Westminster Abbey any paintings have been lost, but English designs, with their emphasis on carved arcades and windows, did not leave the large wall spaces found in most Continental chapter houses.

At Westminster the chapter house, opposite the Palace of Westminster, was used from the erection of the present building for royal meetings, including many of the royal council, and was the usual location for meetings of the House of Commons until the reign of Henry VIII. It was converted into the first home of what is now the Public Record Office (the national archives) soon after the English Reformation, and the late Gothic paintings added behind the seats (see gallery) were preserved hidden behind bookshelves until the 19th century.

In some Romanesque or Gothic monasteries, the entrance to the chapter house has an elaborate façade with a door surrounded by highly decorated archivolts, especially when it is a separate building. Many chapterhouses feature elaborate carving or frescos, which include some masterpieces of religious art, but were also sometimes secular. The paintings from Arlanza, now spread across museums in Spain and the United States, originally decorated the monastery of San Pedro de Arlanza, and contain huge bold mythical beasts that are some of the finest survivals of Romanesque palace decoration. In modern settings, the chapterhouse may simply be (or use) an ordinary office boardroom or meeting room. When it is a separate building, this often consists of just the single main room.

==History and uses==
The community of monks would meet in the chapter house with the abbot to &quot;hold chapter&quot;; that is, &quot;for the reading of the &#x27;Martyrology&#x27; and the &#x27;Necrology&#x27;, for the correction of faults, the assigning of the tasks for the day, and for the exhortation of the superior, and again for the evening Collation or reading before Complin&quot;. The first meeting took place in the morning, after the church services of Prime or Terce. The monks might sit along the length of the walls in strict age-order, apart from the office-holders.

The Carolingian Plan of St Gall (c. 820) is the plan for an ideal 9th century monastery, with a great variety of buildings and rooms, but none that really can be assigned the function of chapterhouse; nor is such a room mentioned by Saint Benedict. But the chapter house is mentioned in the proceedings of the Council of Aachen in 816. The church or cloister may have been used for all meetings in earlier monasteries, or there was usually a refectory (hall for eating). But by at least 1000 such a room had become normal in large monastic establishments. The east side of the cloister on which the chapter house was often located was usually the first to be constructed; it would have been begun shortly after the church walls were built.

==Examples==
Important examples of chapter houses from an architectural or artistic point of view can be seen at:
*Monastery of Santa María de Sigena, Spain, whose very important Romanesque frescos are now in the Museu Nacional d&#x27;Art de Catalunya in Barcelona 
*Elgin Cathedral - octagonal, unusually for Scotland 
*Wąchock Abbey, Romanesque in Poland

<doc id="771965" wikidata="Q728507" url="?curid=771965" title="Strassen algorithm">
<text>In linear algebra, the Strassen algorithm, named after Volker Strassen, is an algorithm for matrix multiplication. It is faster than the standard matrix multiplication algorithm for large matrices, with a better asymptotic complexity, although the naive algorithm is often better for smaller matrices. The Strassen algorithm is slower than the fastest known algorithms for extremely large matrices, but such galactic algorithms are not useful in practice, as they are much slower for matrices of practical size. For small matrices even faster algorithms exist.

Strassen&#x27;s algorithm works for any ring, such as plus/multiply, but not all semirings, such as min-plus or boolean algebra, where the naive algorithm still works, and so called combinatorial matrix multiplication.

== History ==
Volker Strassen first published this algorithm in 1969 and thereby proved that the formula_1 general matrix multiplication algorithm was not optimal. The Strassen algorithm&#x27;s publication resulted in more research about matrix multiplication that led to both asymptotically lower bounds and improved computational upper bounds.

== Algorithm ==
Let formula_2, formula_3 be two square matrices over a ring formula_4, for example matrices whose entries are integers or the real numbers. The goal of matrix multiplication is to calculate the matrix product formula_5. The following exposition of the algorithm assumes that all of these matrices have sizes that are powers of two (i.e., formula_6), but this is only conceptually necessary — if the matrices formula_2, formula_3 are not of type formula_9, the &quot;missing&quot; rows and columns can be filled with zeros to obtain matrices with sizes of powers of two — though real implementations of the algorithm do not do this in practice.

The Strassen algorithm partitions formula_2, formula_3 and formula_12 into equally sized block matrices
:formula_13

with formula_14. The naive algorithm would be:

: formula_15

This construction does not reduce the number of multiplications: 8 multiplications of matrix blocks are still needed to calculate the formula_16 matrices, the same number of multiplications needed when using standard matrix multiplication.

The Strassen algorithm defines instead new values:

: formula_17

using only 7 multiplications (one for each formula_18) instead of 8. We may now express the formula_16 in terms of formula_18:

: formula_21

We recursively iterate this division process until the submatrices degenerate into numbers (elements of the ring formula_4). If, as mentioned above, the original matrix had a size that was not a power of 2, then the resulting product will have zero rows and columns just like formula_2 and formula_3, and these will then be stripped at this point to obtain the (smaller) matrix formula_12 we really wanted.

Practical implementations of Strassen&#x27;s algorithm switch to standard methods of matrix multiplication for small enough submatrices, for which those algorithms are more efficient. The particular crossover point for which Strassen&#x27;s algorithm is more efficient depends on the specific implementation and hardware. Earlier authors had estimated that Strassen&#x27;s algorithm is faster for matrices with widths from 32 to 128 for optimized implementations. However, it has been observed that this crossover point has been increasing in recent years, and a 2010 study found that even a single step of Strassen&#x27;s algorithm is often not beneficial on current architectures, compared to a highly optimized traditional multiplication, until matrix sizes exceed 1000 or more, and even for matrix sizes of several thousand the benefit is typically marginal at best (around 10% or less). A more recent study (2016) observed benefits for matrices as small as 512 and a benefit around 20%.

== Improvements to Strassen algorithm ==

It is possible to reduce the number of matrix additions by instead using the following form discovered by Winograd in 1971:

formula_26

where formula_27.

This reduces the number of matrix additions and subtractions from 18 to 15. The number of matrix multiplications is still 7, and the asymptotic complexity is the same.

The algorithm was further optimised in 2017, reducing the number of matrix additions per step to 12 while maintaining the number of matrix multiplications, and again in 2023:

formula_28

formula_29

formula_30
== Asymptotic complexity ==

The outline of the algorithm above showed that one can get away with just 7, instead of the traditional 8, matrix-matrix multiplications for the sub-blocks of the matrix. On the other hand, one has to do additions and subtractions of blocks, though this is of no concern for the overall complexity: Adding matrices of size formula_31 requires only formula_32 operations whereas multiplication is substantially more expensive (traditionally formula_33 addition or multiplication operations).

The question then is how many operations exactly one needs for Strassen&#x27;s algorithms, and how this compares with the standard matrix multiplication that takes approximately formula_34 (where formula_35) arithmetic operations, i.e. an asymptotic complexity formula_36.

The number of additions and multiplications required in the Strassen algorithm can be calculated as follows: let formula_37 be the number of operations for a formula_9 matrix. Then by recursive application of the Strassen algorithm, we see that formula_39, for some constant formula_40 that depends on the number of additions performed at each application of the algorithm. Hence formula_41, i.e., the asymptotic complexity for multiplying matrices of size formula_35 using the Strassen algorithm is formula_43. The reduction in the number of arithmetic operations however comes at the price of a somewhat reduced numerical stability, and the algorithm also requires significantly more memory compared to the naive algorithm. Both initial matrices must have their dimensions expanded to the next power of 2, which results in storing up to four times as many elements, and the seven auxiliary matrices each contain a quarter of the elements in the expanded ones.

Strassen&#x27;s algorithm needs to be compared to the &quot;naive&quot; way of doing the matrix multiplication that would require 8 instead of 7 multiplications of sub-blocks. This would then give rise to the complexity one expects from the standard approach: formula_44. The comparison of these two algorithms shows that &quot;asymptotically&quot;, Strassen&#x27;s algorithm is faster: There exists a size formula_45 so that matrices that are larger are more efficiently multiplied with Strassen&#x27;s algorithm than the &quot;traditional&quot; way. However, the asymptotic statement does not imply that Strassen&#x27;s algorithm is &quot;always&quot; faster even for small matrices, and in practice this is in fact not the case: For small matrices, the cost of the additional additions of matrix blocks outweighs the savings in the number of multiplications. There are also other factors not captured by the analysis above, such as the difference in cost on today&#x27;s hardware between loading data from memory onto processors vs. the cost of actually doing operations on this data. As a consequence of these sorts of considerations, Strassen&#x27;s algorithm is typically only used on &quot;large&quot; matrices. This kind of effect is even more pronounced with alternative algorithms such as the one by Coppersmith and Winograd: While &quot;asymptotically&quot; even faster, the cross-over point formula_45 is so large that the algorithm is not generally used on matrices one encounters in practice.

=== Rank or bilinear complexity ===
The bilinear complexity or rank of a bilinear map is an important concept in the asymptotic complexity of matrix multiplication. The rank of a bilinear map formula_47 over a field F is defined as (somewhat of an abuse of notation)
:formula_48
In other words, the rank of a bilinear map is the length of its shortest bilinear computation. The existence of Strassen&#x27;s algorithm shows that the rank of formula_49 matrix multiplication is no more than seven. To see this, let us express this algorithm (alongside the standard algorithm) as such a bilinear computation. In the case of matrices, the dual spaces A* and B* consist of maps into the field F induced by a scalar double-dot product, (i.e. in this case the sum of all the entries of a Hadamard product.)

It can be shown that the total number of elementary multiplications formula_50 required for matrix multiplication is tightly asymptotically bound to the rank formula_51, i.e. formula_52, or more specifically, since the constants are known, formula_53. One useful property of the rank is that it is submultiplicative for tensor products, and this enables one to show that formula_54 matrix multiplication can be accomplished with no more than formula_55 elementary multiplications for any formula_56. (This formula_56-fold tensor product of the formula_58 matrix multiplication map with itself — an formula_56-th tensor power—is realized by the recursive step in the algorithm shown.)

===Cache behavior===
Strassen&#x27;s algorithm is cache oblivious. Analysis of its cache behavior algorithm has shown it to incur

:formula_60

cache misses during its execution, assuming an idealized cache of size formula_61 (i.e. with formula_62 lines of length formula_63).

== Implementation considerations ==

The description above states that the matrices are square, and the size is a power of two, and that padding should be used if needed. This restriction allows the matrices to be split in half, recursively, until limit of scalar multiplication is reached. The restriction simplifies the explanation, and analysis of complexity, but is not actually necessary;
and in fact, padding the matrix as described will increase the computation time and can easily eliminate the fairly narrow time savings obtained by using the method in the first place.

A good implementation will observe the following:

* It is not necessary or desirable to use the Strassen algorithm down to the limit of scalars. Compared to conventional matrix multiplication, the algorithm adds a considerable formula_64 workload in addition/subtractions; so below a certain size, it will be better to use conventional multiplication. Thus, for instance, a formula_65 does not need to be padded to formula_66, since it could be subdivided down to formula_67 matrices and conventional multiplication can then be used at that level.
* The method can indeed be applied to square matrices of any dimension. If the dimension is even, they are split in half as described. If the dimension is odd, zero padding by one row and one column is applied first. Such padding can be applied on-the-fly and lazily, and the extra rows and columns discarded as the result is formed. For instance, suppose the matrices are formula_68. They can be split so that the upper-left portion is formula_69 and the lower-right is formula_70. Wherever the operations require it, dimensions of formula_71 are zero padded to formula_72 first. Note, for instance, that the product formula_73 is only used in the lower row of the output, so is only required to be formula_71 rows high; and thus the left factor formula_75 used to generate it need only be formula_71 rows high; accordingly, there is no need to pad that sum to formula_72 rows; it is only necessary to pad formula_78 to formula_72 columns to match formula_80.

Furthermore, there is no need for the matrices to be square. Non-square matrices can be split in half using the same methods, yielding smaller non-square matrices. If the matrices are sufficiently non-square it will be worthwhile reducing the initial operation to more square products, using simple methods which are essentially formula_64, for instance:

* A product of size formula_82 can be done as 20 separate formula_83 operations, arranged to form the result;
* A product of size formula_84 can be done as 10 separate formula_83 operations, summed to form the result.

These techniques will make the implementation more complicated, compared to simply padding to a power-of-two square; however, it is a reasonable assumption that anyone undertaking an implementation of Strassen, rather than conventional multiplication, will place a higher priority on computational efficiency than on simplicity of the implementation.

In practice, Strassen&#x27;s algorithm can be implemented to attain better performance than conventional multiplication even for matrices as small as formula_86, for matrices that are not at all square, and without requiring workspace beyond buffers that are already needed for a high-performance conventional multiplication.

<doc id="771967" wikidata="Q311407" url="?curid=771967" title="Tostão">
<text>Eduardo Gonçalves de Andrade (born 25 January 1947), generally known as Tostão, is a Brazilian former professional footballer who played as a forward or attacking midfielder and was a physician.

Tostão was an intelligent, hardworking and prolific left-footed forward, who was known for his creativity and technical skills, and was considered one of the best players in the world in his prime and arguably the best player in the world in the early 70s alongside Cruyff before health problems forced his early retirement. Tostão was widely considered at the time the second best or even the best Brazilian player in the late 60s alongside Pelé, even ahead of other stars that would be part of the legendary 1970 Brazil squad. He played most of his 11-year career with Cruzeiro.

Tostão represented Brazil in two World Cups, winning the tournament in 1970. He formed a lethal offensive partnership with Pelé in the national team.

== Football career ==
Born in Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Eduardo Andrade received, like the vast majority of Brazilian footballers, a nickname early into his football career, being dubbed &#x27;Tostão&#x27; (little coin). Legend has it that as a six-year-old school boy he netted 47 goals in one game for his primary school football team.

Tostão made his professional debut aged only 15, for local América Mineiro, returning after two years to Cruzeiro, where he had started his youth career. Although being a centre midfielder, he was crowned the &quot;Campeonato Mineiro&quot;&#x27;s topscorer on three consecutive occasions, the first in 1966, and left the club as its all-time scorer, with a total of 249 goals.

In the 1970 FIFA World Cup, improvised as a forward, Tostão scored two of his 32 goals for Brazil, and assisted four, as the national team won its third trophy, whilst finding the net on 19 occasions. The previous year, after being hit in the face by a ball during a match against Corinthians, he suffered a detached retina from which he never fully recovered. In April 1972, he signed for Vasco da Gama for a then record fee in the country but, after good overall displays, was forced to retire from the game at only 27, after his sight problems resurfaced, despite attempts at corrective surgery.

Weary of football and fame, Tostão became a medical doctor, but ultimately rejoined the footballing world, working as a journalist and pundit on TV.

== Style of play ==
Tostão was, due to his relatively small stature and slender frame, not particularly skilled in the air; in spite of his lack of pace, strong physical attributes, or long-range shooting abilities, however, he was a mobile, intelligent, and hard-working footballer, who stood out throughout his career due to his anticipation and timing in the penalty area, which made him a prolific goalscorer. A predominantly left-footed player, in his prime, he was considered one of the best players in the world, and was known for his technique, balance, and dribbling skills, while also contributing with many assists thanks to his vision, creativity, precise passing and playmaking abilities, as well as his work-rate, which often saw him drop back into midfield in order to retrieve the ball and start attacking plays. He was also known for his ability to disorient defenders and get onto the end of passes or create space for teammates with his movement and runs off the ball, which saw him act in a role which was essentially functioning as a precursor of the modern false 9 role with Brazil during the 1970 World Cup, despite being deployed as a centre-forward on paper. Due to his versatility and wide range of skills, he was capable of playing in several attacking and midfield positions including as an attacking midfielder, as a second striker, as a left winger, or even as an out-and-out striker.

<doc id="771970" wikidata="Q1419438" url="?curid=771970" title="Great Western Railway (train operating company)">
<text>First Greater Western, trading as Great Western Railway (GWR), is a British train operating company owned by FirstGroup that provides services in the Greater Western franchise area. It manages 197 stations and its trains call at over 270. GWR operates long-distance inter-city services along the Great Western Main Line to and from the West of England and South Wales, inter-city services from London to the West Country via the Reading–Taunton line, and the &quot;Night Riviera&quot; sleeper service between London and Penzance. It provides outer-suburban services in West London; commuter services from its London terminus at to the Thames Valley region, including parts of Berkshire and Buckinghamshire, and Oxfordshire; and regional services throughout the West of England and South Wales to the South coast of England. Great Western Railway also operates the Heathrow Express service.

The company began operating in February 1996 as Great Western Trains, as part of the privatisation of British Rail. In December 1998, it became First Great Western after FirstGroup bought out its partners&#x27; shares in Great Western Holdings. In April 2006, First Great Western, First Great Western Link and Wessex Trains were combined into the new Greater Western franchise and brought under the First Great Western brand. The company adopted its current name and a new livery in September 2015 to coincide with the start of a newly extended contract that was subsequently extended to run until June 2028.

==History==

As part of the privatisation of British Rail, the Great Western InterCity franchise was awarded by the Director of Passenger Rail Franchising to Great Western Holdings in December 1995, and it began operations on 4 February 1996. Great Western Holdings was owned by some former British Rail managers (51%), FirstBus (24.5%) and 3i (24.5%).

In March 1998, FirstGroup bought out its partners&#x27; stakes to give it 100% ownership. In December 1998, the franchise was rebranded First Great Western.

On 1 April 2004, First Great Western Link began operating the Thames Trains franchise. It ran local services from Paddington to , , , , , , , , , and . It also operated services from Reading to (via and ), and from Reading to .
On 1 April 2006, the Great Western, Great Western Link and Wessex Trains franchises were combined into a new Greater Western franchise. FirstGroup, National Express and Stagecoach were shortlisted to bid for it. On 13 December 2005, it was announced that FirstGroup had won the franchise. Originally, First planned to subdivide its services into three categories based on routes. Following feedback from staff and stakeholders, the decision was taken to re-brand and re-livery all services as &#x27;First Great Western&#x27;.

In May 2011, FirstGroup announced that it had decided not to take up the option to extend its franchise beyond the end of March 2013. It stated that, in the light of the £1billion plan to electrify the Great Western route from London via Bristol to Cardiff, it wished to try to negotiate a longer-term deal. CEO Tim O&#x27;Toole said: &quot;We believe we are best placed to manage these projects and capture the benefits through a longer-term franchise.&quot;

By not taking up the option to extend its original franchise contract for a further three years, FirstGroup avoided having to pay £826.6million to the government; it received extra subsidies totalling £133million from the government in 2010.

In March 2012, Arriva, FirstGroup, National Express and Stagecoach were shortlisted to bid for the new franchise. The winner was expected to be announced in December 2012, with the new franchisee taking over in April 2013. But it was announced in July 2012 that the franchise would be extended, due to the late issue of the invitation to tender (ITT). The ITT ran from the end of July until October 2012. The winner would have been announced in March 2013, and taken on the franchise from 21 July 2013 until the end of July 2028. The new franchise would include the introduction of new Intercity Express Trains, capacity enhancements and smart ticketing. The award of the franchise was again delayed in October 2012, while the Department for Transport (DfT) reviewed the way rail franchises were awarded.

In January 2013, the government announced that the current competition for the franchise had been aborted, and that FirstGroup&#x27;s contract had been extended until October 2013. A two-year franchise extension until September 2015 was agreed in October 2013, and subsequently extended until March 2019. A further extension to April 2019 was granted in March 2015.

The refurbishment of first-class carriages in 2014 included interiors that featured a new GWR logo, with no First branding. The whole company was rebranded Great Western Railway (GWR) on 20 September 2015, with the introduction of a green livery in recognition of the former Great Western Railway which existed between 1835 and 1947. The new livery was introduced when HST interiors were refurbished, and on sleeper carriages and Class 57/6 locomotives.

In May 2018, TfL Rail which later became the Elizabeth line took over services from Paddington to , and then some stopping services to Reading in December 2019. becoming part of the Elizabeth line service.

In March 2020, the DfT awarded a further extension to 31 March 2023.

In June 2022, the DfT replaced the franchise agreement with a direct award contract that expires on 25 June 2028, with an option to extend for a further three years.

GWR was one of several train operators impacted by the 2022–2024 United Kingdom railway strikes, which were the first national rail strikes in the UK for three decades.

Great Western Railway operates routes west of London including those towards south west England such as Wiltshire, Bristol, Cornwall, Gloucestershire, as well as Oxfordshire, Berkshire, Hereford and South Wales.

The following is a simplified list of regular off-peak weekday service from the June 2024 timetables.

===Intercity===
===Thames Valley===
===Bristol===
===West of England===

==Named trains==

Great Western Railway&#x27;s named passenger trains include:
==Onboard services==
===Pullman Dining===
GWR operates restaurant cars on certain West Country and Wales trains to or from London Paddington. They are available to first-class and standard-class passengers, though only first-class passengers may make advance reservations, and they have priority over seats in the restaurant. Meals in the restaurant car are not included in the price of rail tickets.

===First class===

GWR has first class on all its long-distance high-speed services. First class on the IETs includes fabric reclining seating with tables at every seat, as well as an at-seat service provided by a customer host on most journeys. Unlike the previous HSTs, the IETs do not have leather first-class seating due to fire regulations. Like the HSTs, there are power sockets and USB charging points at every seat. There is Wi-Fi throughout the first class-carriages, which GWR describes as &#x27;upgraded&#x27;.

===Standard class===

Standard class is provided on all services. Many services on long-distance and regional routes have specific seat reservations.

===Trolley service===
An at-seat trolley service is scheduled to operate on most IET services, with a trolley in each portion of a ten-coach train. This is different from the HSTs, which had buffet counters branded as &#x27;Express Cafes&#x27;.

==Performance==
===Disabled passengers===
In July 2018, a disabled woman was threatened by Great Western Railway staff with police action and removal from the train she was travelling in, for using a disabled space for her mobility scooter. Canadian-born comedian Tanyalee Davis, who has a form of dwarfism, said she was humiliated when a Great Western Railway conductor made an announcement that she was &quot;causing problems&quot; which had delayed the train. The incident occurred after a woman travelling with a young child demanded that Davis make way for her pram. GWR said the incident should not have happened and &quot;No one travelling with us should be left feeling like this&quot;.

===Strike action===
In 2015, the imminent arrival of the new trains provoked a series of strikes by the RMT union over who has the right to control the doors. First Great Western wanted to replace conductors with driver-only operation (DOO); however, following several discussions it was agreed to keep conductors on all IET services. 
Another strike took place in early December 2016 amidst a background of ongoing rail strikes on a national level. The RMT ballotted Servest UK workers employed on an outsourcing contract to GWR as cleaners; the ballot passed in favour of strike action by 98%. A disruptive transfer period in the outsourcing contract, from Mitie to Servest UK, had resulted in what the RMT referred to as the creation of a &quot;two-tier workforce&quot; amongst cleaners at GWR, with an inequality in pay and working conditions between cleaners employed directly by GWR and those outsourced to Servest UK. Two 24-hour strikes were held from 06:00 on 16 and 23 December, followed by a 48-hour strike from 06:00 on 19 January 2017. Further industrial action was suspended by the RMT following the January strike as a result of an improvement in ongoing negotiations between the RMT, GWR and Servest UK. The dispute was formally resolved in July 2017, as RMT members voted in favour of accepting a new pay deal.

===IET issues===

In April 2021, cracks were discovered in the yaw damper brackets (part of the suspension system) of and InterCity Express Trains (IET). Eight trains were withdrawn from service and an investigation started into the cause. On 8 May, all these trains and similar ones operated by other companies were taken out of service. Cracks had now been found in the lifting pads (a component fixed near the bogie) and it was feared that if these were to fall off they may cause injury or derailment.

The only IET units that were permitted to operate were those which had been carefully inspected and found to have no significant cracks. This meant that most of GWR&#x27;s 93 units were unavailable which led to significant disruption to long-distance services. units operated additional services from London Paddington to which were later extended to and after approval was given for them to operate in service on this route. Three additional 387 units were loaned from c2c and were modified to work with GWR&#x27;s fleet, mostly on services to . CrossCountry operated a service on behalf of GWR from Swindon to and the few available 800 and 802, were concentrated on services west of Swindon and to . Plans were agreed on 13 May to increase inspections of the lifting pads and yaw dampers so that more trains could be returned to service. A further six Class 387 units were loaned from Govia Thameslink Railway in July 2021 and used in a common pool with GWR&#x27;s existing 387/1 fleet, being surplus to requirements while the &quot;Gatwick Express&quot; service was suspended.

==Rolling stock==
Great Western Railway inherited a fleet of InterCity 125 sets (Class 43 power cars and Mark 3 Coaches) and locomotives and Mark 3 sleeper coaches from BR. In 2006, it inherited a fleet of and units from First Great Western Link, and a fleet of , and units from Wessex Trains.

===Inter-City services===

====Class 800 Intercity Express Train====

The fleet of 57 Class 800 trains from the Hitachi A-train family is used to operate most of GWR&#x27;s long-distance services between London and destinations such as , , , , , , , , , , and . Introduced between autumn 2017 and spring 2019, these gradually replaced the older InterCity 125 sets.

On 28 April 2021, six Class 800s were withdrawn from service due to cracks being found during maintenance and were sent to Hitachi for inspection.

====Class 802 Intercity Express Train====

Long-distance services between London and destinations in the west of the GWR network (such as , , Plymouth and ) are mostly operated using the fleet of 36 Class 802 trains, the first of which was introduced on 20 August 2018.

These trains are almost identical to the Class 800 trains, except they have a higher engine operating power— per engine as opposed to —and are fitted with larger fuel tanks to cope with the gradients and extended running in diesel mode on the long unelectrified stretches in Devon and Cornwall.

Hitachi planned to test a tri-mode Class 802 in 2022 fitted with batteries in an attempt to reduce emissions when entering and leaving stations.

===Sleeper services===

====Class 57 + Mark 3====

Four Class 57/6 locomotives have hauled the &quot;Night Riviera&quot; sleeper services since 2004 when they replaced Class 47s. Due to poor availability of the 57/6s, Direct Rail Services (DRS) Class 57/3s have been hired from Direct Rail Services. in 2023, former DRS 57312 was placed on permanent lease with GWR.

=== Thames Valley and Bristol services ===
====Class 165/1 Networker Turbo====

The &quot;Networker Turbo&quot; is a two- or three-coach DMU used on shorter-distance services in the Thames Valley area, with the majority based at Reading Traction Maintenance Depot. They are mainly used on branches such as the Greenford branch line, Slough–Windsor &amp; Eton line, Marlow branch line and Henley branch line. They are also used on services between Reading and Basingstoke, Didcot Parkway and Oxford or Banbury and sometimes services between London and Oxford. Some are (and eventually all will be) based at St Philip&#x27;s Marsh depot in Bristol, where they work on most of the lines in the area including the Severn Beach line, Heart of Wessex Line, Golden Valley line and Bristol to Exeter line. From summer 2018, they are due to run on Cardiff Central to Portsmouth Harbour services too.
In response to its Remedial Plan Notice, First Great Western undertook a more thorough refurbishment of the Thames Turbo fleet than originally planned: the trains were to be fitted with improved lighting, carpets, toilets, and a revised seating layout. This refurbishment started in September 2016.

====Class 166 Networker Turbo====

The &quot;Networker Turbo&quot; is a three-coach DMU, similar to the Class 165 units but with an internal layout more suitable for longer-distance services. They are now mostly based at St Philip&#x27;s Marsh depot in Bristol, where they currently work on most of the lines in the area including the Wessex Main Line, Severn Beach line, Heart of Wessex Line, Golden Valley line and Bristol to Taunton line.

====Class 387/1 Electrostar====
The &quot;Electrostar&quot; is a four-coach EMU built by Bombardier, with a 2+2 seating layout, tables, power sockets and free Wi-Fi. It can be operated in four, eight- and twelve-coach formations. The class began to enter service in September 2016 on weekday peak services between London Paddington and Hayes &amp; Harlington, using the overhead electrical equipment used by Heathrow Express. Services using the class were extended to Maidenhead in May 2017 and later to Didcot Parkway, and from Reading to Newbury.

Bombardier Transportation at Ilford Depot had modified twelve of these trains by December 2020, installing new first-class seating, Wi-Fi, luggage racks and on-board entertainment, to be used on Heathrow Express services. Rebranded as &quot;Heathrow Express&quot;, and refurbished with Heathrow Express moquette, they replaced the existing , entering service on 29 December 2020.

In 2023 3 units were cascaded to Great Northern.

===West of England services===

====Class 43 + Mark 3 HST / Class 255 Castle====

Great Western Railway retained 24 power cars and 48 carriages from its former High Speed Train fleet to form 12 &#x27;Castle&#x27; 2+4 sets. They are branded as &quot;Class 255&quot; sets and are for use on multiple services between Plymouth and Penzance. There is a consensus that the sets shall be withdrawn at the end of 2024, ending their services with GWR in Devon and Cornwall and replaced with Class 175s. All power cars being retained will have new nameplates, named after castles from across the area that GWR serve. The sets are progressively being fitted with automatic doors and controlled emission toilets, to allow their operation beyond 2020, at Doncaster Works. Due to a delay in refurbishing the Castle sets, slam door 2+4 sets known as &#x27;Classic&#x27; sets were used until the end of 2019.

Until 2017, GWR operated the vast majority of its long-distance services with a fleet of 58 InterCity 125 High Speed Train sets, each consisting of eight Mark 3 coaches sandwiched between two Class 43 locomotives. GWR operated the largest InterCity 125 fleet, owning five sets outright; the rest were leased from Angel Trains and Porterbrook. From 2009 to 2012 (when Class 180s were reintroduced on the Cotswold line) all the company&#x27;s intercity services were worked by HSTs except the Night Riviera sleeper service between London Paddington and Penzance. From late 2017, following the completion of electrification from to the west of England, intercity services gradually became operated by Class 800 IETs, although a few peak services remained operated by HSTs until early 2019. GWR continued to use HSTs on services to Exeter, Plymouth and Penzance until May 2019, when they were all withdrawn in favour of Class 802 units.

The youngest Class 43 locomotive dated from 1982. After a successful trial by Angel Trains and FGW in 2004, two power cars received new MTU engines while two received new Paxman VP185s, fitted by Brush Traction of Loughborough. The MTU engine proved the better option, both for reliability and for emissions, resulting in FGW, Brush and Angel Trains starting the HST Modernisation programme. The last power cars to be re-engineered were released in April 2008, while several other companies&#x27; HSTs have now all undergone a similar programme.

GWR&#x27;s High Speed Train fleet were refurbished by Bombardier in Derby and Ilford between 2006 and 2008, with leather seats introduced in first class, redesigned toilets, a redesigned buffet, and at-seat power points. The company opted for mainly airline seats, giving more seats per train.

Following the Southall and Ladbroke Grove rail crashes, GWR requires its HSTs to have automatic train protection and Automatic Warning System safety systems in operation. If either is faulty, the train is not used.

====Class 150/2 Sprinter====

The fleet of 17 two-coach Sprinter units was inherited from Wessex Trains as part of the Greater Western franchise shuffle. The fleet had been refurbished by Wessex Trains in 2003, with 2+2 seating arranged in a mixture of &#x27;airline&#x27; (face to back) and table seating. The fleet is widespread throughout the former Wessex area, and carried a maroon livery with advertising vinyls for South West Tourism. Each unit was sponsored by a district, town or attraction and carried a unique livery. Most received names of attractions, places and branch lines. Two units were repainted into the new First &#x27;Local&#x27; livery, but all units are now due to receive the new green GWR livery. As part of a national fleet shuffle, eight units went to Arriva Trains Wales on 10 December 2006, and were replaced with 8 Class 158 units.

First Great Western received five extra Class 150/2 units in May 2007 as part of its Remedial Plan Notice, to enable three-car Class 158 trains to operate on the Portsmouth-Cardiff services. Five Class 150 sets were hired from Arriva Trains Wales from March 2008 until they were returned in November 2010.

====Class 158 Express Sprinter====

The is a two- or three-coach DMU used on regional express services in the former Wessex Trains area. In February 2008, as part of its Remedial Plan Notice, First Great Western announced that it would form some hybrid three-car Class 158 units in March 2008, made possible by the transfer of five Class 150/2 units from Arriva Trains Wales. This allowed for ten hybrid units in operation and, combined with one non-hybrid three-car unit, provided eleven three-car units to operate services between Portsmouth and Cardiff and Great Malvern and Weymouth alongside the two-car units. After the introduction of Class 150/1 trains from London Overground and London Midland, three of the remaining five two-coach Class 158s were reformed to provide two further three-coach Class 158s. However, following their operations largely being taken over by Class 165 and units in the Bristol area, most of these units were reformed to restore them to 2 coach formation.

The fleet was refurbished in a programme begun in 2007, which included fitting of reupholstered seats, new lighting and floor coverings, CCTV within the passenger saloons, and refurbished toilets. At the same time, the exteriors of the vehicles were repainted in the updated FGW livery, including artwork depicting various local places of interest. The refurbishment work took place at the Wabtec plant in Doncaster.

In 2018, the 158s began running alongside the first completed Class 255 &quot;Castle&quot; set on services between , , and . Since then, more of the 158 fleet have gradually started to move more west with more 158 sets working services between and / . The timetable change in December 2019 saw the start of the 158s taking over from the 143s primarily on the Tarka Line to Barnstaple, with some of the units also working on the / Bristol to Penzance route alongside the &quot;Castle&quot; sets.

===Current fleet===


=== Past fleet ===


Locomotive-hauled trains were in use on services between Cardiff, Bristol, Taunton and Paignton from December 2008 until November 2010 using Virgin Trains locomotives with Mark 2 coaching stock. A second set hauled by EWS s was used between December 2009 and October 2010. These were withdrawn when sufficient DMUs were available following the transfer of six Class 150/1 sets from London Overground. First Great Western issued a tender in May 2013 so that locomotive-hauled trains, or other train formations, could be operated on the Taunton-Cardiff route again, proposed to start in December 2013, to cover for DMUs out of service for refurbishment on Monday-to-Friday diagrams. GWR also runs loco-hauled sets composed of seating coaches and a Class 57 locomotive from the Night Riviera service between Penzance and Exeter St Davids as part of the summer timetable to release a DMU for other services.

Twelve &quot;Pacer&quot; DMUs were received by First Great Western in 2007, starting operations that December. These were sub-leased from Northern Rail (where they had been stored), in part to cover for refurbishment of FGW&#x27;s Sprinter fleets but also to allow the Class 158s to be re-formed as three-coach sets. They were based at Exeter TMD, working alongside the similar on services in Devon and Cornwall, including the Avocet Line, Riviera Line and Tarka Line. Five 142s were returned to Northern Rail in late 2008, following the completion of the refresh of Class 150 Sprinter units. The remaining seven units were returned to Northern Rail by November 2011 as they had been replaced by Class 150 units cascaded from London Overground and London Midland following the arrival of new &quot;Turbostar&quot; units.

GWR&#x27;s Night Riviera service also included the UK&#x27;s last Motorail service, until that aspect was withdrawn at the end of the 2005 summer season due to low usage.

First Great Western previously leased 14 &quot;Adelante&quot; units, operating on the Great Western Main Line, but following technical issues they were transferred elsewhere. In 2012, five units were returned to First Great Western to operate weekday services on the Cotswold Line, allowing class 165 and 166 units to be reallocated to increase capacity on Thames Valley services. The Class 180s left GWR in stages between June and December 2017 to join Grand Central.

The 150/1s in the GWR fleet transferred to Arriva Rail North in stages, beginning with the first three in August 2017 when their leases expired, and ending in April 2018. The 153s also transferred elsewhere in stages too, with the first four units going to East Midlands Trains and the next five units going to Arriva Rail North. This left just five 153 units with GWR, which eventually transferred to Transport for Wales in April 2019.

===Future fleet===

In February 2023, GWR purchased a number of assets from the administrators of battery train manufacturer Vivarail, including 67 former London Underground D78 Stock carriages and intellectual property rights to the . GWR have also employed nine Vivarail staff. It intends to trial the Class 230 units on the Greenford branch line between West Ealing and Greenford.

In August 2024, Rail Express reported that GWR were planning to lease the Class 175 fleet. In November 2024, it was announced that GWR had signed a lease for the Class 175 fleet; the fleet is planned to enter service in 2025. On 27 November 2024, 175002 was the first Class 175 unit to transfer to GWR.
===Rejected fleet===

It was planned for Great Western Railway to operate nineteen Class 769/9 units once they were fully rolled out. The operator intended to run the first services in spring 2019, but this was delayed by issues faced by Porterbrook in converting the units. However, the first vehicle has been delivered and all were expected to be delivered by the end of 2021.

Although initially planned for use in London and the Thames Valley, while 12 units were modified for Heathrow Express services, the future plan for these units was to be operating on services between , and , which would have meant operating on non-electrified lines, OHLE and third-rail routes. To enable this, GWR&#x27;s allocation of Class 769 units retained their dual-voltage capability in addition to being fitted with diesel power units. The units also received an internal refurbishment and be fitted with air cooling.

The first Class 769 to be delivered to GWR was unit 769943, which arrived at Reading TMD in August 2020. It was expected to enter service in early 2021. The Class 769 was expected to enter squadron service with GWR between June and December 2021, but this was later delayed to 2022.

In December 2022, GWR announced that the introduction of the Class 769 fleet would be abandoned and the units handed back to Porterbrook in April 2023. This was to comply with DfT mandated cost-cutting and also as a result of dissatisfaction with the reliability of the units on test.

==Livery==

Great Western Trains adopted a livery of dark-green upper body and ivory lower body, with a stylised &#x27;Merlin&#x27; bird logo. Following the rebranding as First Great Western, fader vinyls were added to the lower body, with a gold bar containing the stylised FirstGroup &quot;F&quot; logo and separate Great Western logotype. This livery was sometimes known as the &#x27;fag packet&#x27; livery.

When the Class 180 &quot;Adelante&quot; units were delivered, they were painted in the intercity version of FirstGroup&#x27;s corporate bus livery. This consisted of a purple-blue base, with pink and gold bars and large pink &quot;F&quot;s on the carriage sides and white highlights along the roof and around the driver&#x27;s cab. The doors were painted white to comply with the Disability Discrimination Act 1995. The HST fleet was repainted to match as they went through overhaul; however, the livery on the power cars was progressively altered to a plain blue base with pink and gold stripes, following problems with dirt build-up on the large white areas.

The new Greater Western franchise involved repainting the HST fleet into FirstGroup&#x27;s &#x27;Dynamic Lines&#x27; livery for intercity and commuter services in the former First Great Western and First Great Western Link areas. The livery was initially applied to the HST fleet as they went through refurbishment, although the Class 180 units did not receive the new livery due to the termination of their lease. The commuter units also received the new livery while receiving standard maintenance, as a refurbishment was not originally planned.
The rebranding of the company as Great Western Railway introduced a new GWR logo and a dark green livery with white stripes and grey doors in September 2015.

==Depots==
Great Western Railway trains are based at eight depots. Other depots at Landore (Swansea) and Old Oak Common (London) closed in 2018.
===Past Depots===

==TV documentary==
Channel 5 broadcast two television series looking into day-to-day challenges of the Great Western mainline, including events at Dawlish (as well as the sea wall destruction), Cheltenham race day and rugby at Cardiff. It was broadcast as &quot;The Railway: First Great Western&quot; and the last series aired in 2015. A similar series based on London Paddington started in September 2017 and covered events such as the reaction to the Manchester Arena and London Bridge attacks, and several days of severe disruption.

==Future of the franchise==
The franchise was due to end on 31 March 2020. In November 2017, the DfT announced its intention to negotiate a further extension for the franchise until April 2022 with an option to extend for a further two years. A new contract was agreed on 30 March 2020, running for three years, extendable to four.
