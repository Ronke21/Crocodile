<text>Richard Streit Hamilton (January 10, 1943 – September 29, 2024) was an American mathematician who served as the Davies Professor of Mathematics at Columbia University.

Hamilton is known for contributions to geometric analysis and partial differential equations, and particularly for developing the theory of Ricci flow. Hamilton introduced the Ricci flow in 1982 and, over the next decades, he developed a network of results and ideas for using it to prove the Poincaré conjecture and geometrization conjecture from the field of geometric topology.

Hamilton&#x27;s work on the Ricci flow was recognized with an Oswald Veblen Prize, a Clay Research Award, a Leroy P. Steele Prize for Seminal Contribution to Research and a Shaw Prize. Grigori Perelman built upon Hamilton&#x27;s research program, proving the Poincaré and geometrization conjectures in 2003. Perelman was awarded a Millennium Prize for resolving the Poincaré conjecture but declined it, regarding his contribution as no greater than Hamilton&#x27;s.

==Life==
Hamilton was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, on January 10, 1943. He received his B.A. in 1963 from Yale University and PhD in 1966 from Princeton University. Robert Gunning supervised his thesis.

Hamilton&#x27;s first permanent position was at Cornell University. There, he interacted with James Eells, who with Joseph Sampson had recently published a paper introducing harmonic map heat flow. Hamilton was inspired to formulate a version of Eells and Sampson&#x27;s work dealing with deformation of Riemannian metrics. This developed into the Ricci flow. After publishing his first paper on the topic, Hamilton moved to University of California, San Diego in the mid-1980s, joining Richard Schoen and Shing-Tung Yau in the group working on geometric analysis. In 1998, Hamilton became the Davies Professor of Mathematics at Columbia University, where he remained for the rest of his career. In 2022, Hamilton additionally joined University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa as an adjunct professor.

Hamilton&#x27;s mathematical contributions are primarily in the field of differential geometry and more specifically geometric analysis. He is best known for having discovered the Ricci flow and developing a research program aimed at the proof of William Thurston&#x27;s geometrization conjecture, which contains the well-known Poincaré conjecture as a special case. In 2003, Grigori Perelman introduced new ideas into Hamilton&#x27;s research program and completed a proof of the geometrization conjecture. In March 2010, the Clay Mathematics Institute, having listed the Poincaré conjecture among their Millennium Prize Problems, awarded Perelman with one million USD for his 2003 proof of the conjecture. In July 2010, Perelman turned down the award and prize money, saying that he believed his contribution in proving the Poincaré conjecture was no greater than that of Hamilton.

In 1996, Hamilton was awarded the Oswald Veblen Prize in Geometry &quot;in recognition of his recent and continuing work to uncover the geometric and analytic properties of singularities of the Ricci flow equation and related systems of differential equations.&quot; In 2003 he received the Clay Research Award for &quot;his introduction of the Ricci flow equation and his development of it into one of the most powerful tools in geometry and topology&quot;. He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1999 and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2003. In 2009, he received the Leroy P. Steele Prize for Seminal Contribution to Research of the American Mathematical Society for his &quot;profoundly original&quot; breakthrough article &quot;Three-manifolds with positive Ricci curvature&quot;, in which he first introduced and analyzed the Ricci flow. In 2011, the million-dollar Shaw Prize was split equally between Hamilton and Demetrios Christodoulou &quot;for their highly innovative works on nonlinear partial differential equations in Lorentzian and Riemannian geometry and their applications to general relativity and topology.&quot; In 2024, he and Andrew Wiles received the Basic Science Lifetime Award in Mathematics at the International Congress of Basic Science.

Hamilton died at a hospital in Manhattan, New York City on September 29, 2024, at the age of 81.

==Mathematical work==
Hamilton was the author of forty-six research articles, the majority of which were in the field of geometric flows.

===Harnack inequalities for heat equations===
In 1986, Peter Li and Shing-Tung Yau discovered a new method for applying the maximum principle to control the solutions of the heat equation. Their results take the form of asserting the nonnegativity of certain combinations of partial derivatives of a positive solution of the heat equation. These inequalities, known as &quot;differential Harnack inequalities&quot; or &quot;Li–Yau inequalities&quot;, are useful since they can be integrated along paths to compare the values of the solution at any two spacetime points. In 1993, Hamilton showed that the computations of Li and Yau could be extended, showing that their differential Harnack inequality was a consequence of a stronger inequality which asserts the nonnegativity of a &quot;matrix&quot;-valued function. His result required the stronger assumption that the underlying closed Riemannian manifold has nonnegative sectional curvature and parallel Ricci tensor (such as the flat torus or the Fubini–Study metric on complex projective space). Such matrix inequalities are sometimes known as &quot;Li–Yau–Hamilton inequalities&quot;.

Hamilton also found that Li and Yau&#x27;s calculations were directly transferable to derive Harnack inequalities for the scalar curvature along a positively-curved Ricci flow on a two-dimensional closed manifold. With more effort, he was able to formulate an analogue of his matrix estimate in the case of the Riemann curvature tensor along a Ricci flow in general dimensions, provided that the curvature operator is nonnegative. As an important algebraic corollary, the values of the scalar curvature at two different spacetime points can be compared. This fact is used extensively in Hamilton and Perelman&#x27;s further study of Ricci flow.

Hamilton later adapted his Li–Yau estimate for the Ricci flow to the setting of the mean curvature flow, which is slightly simpler since the geometry is governed by the second fundamental form, which has a simpler structure than the Riemann curvature tensor. Hamilton&#x27;s theorem, which requires strict convexity, is naturally applicable to certain singularities of mean curvature flow due to the convexity estimates of Gerhard Huisken and Carlo Sinestrari.

===Nash–Moser theorem===
In 1956, John Nash resolved the problem of smoothly isometrically embedding Riemannian manifolds in Euclidean space. The core of his proof was a novel &quot;small perturbation&quot; result, showing that if a Riemannian metric could be isometrically embedded in a certain way, then any nearby Riemannian metric could be isometrically embedded as well. Such a result is highly reminiscent of an implicit function theorem, and many authors have attempted to put the logic of the proof into the setting of a general theorem. Such theorems are now known as Nash–Moser theorems.

In 1982, Hamilton published his formulation of Nash&#x27;s reasoning, casting the theorem into the setting of &quot;tame Fréchet spaces&quot;; Nash&#x27;s fundamental use of restricting the Fourier transform to regularize functions was abstracted by Hamilton to the setting of exponentially decreasing sequences in Banach spaces. His formulation has been widely quoted and used in the subsequent time. He used it himself to prove a general existence and uniqueness theorem for geometric evolution equations; the standard implicit function theorem does not often apply in such settings due to the degeneracies introduced by invariance under the action of the diffeomorphism group. In particular, the well-posedness of the Ricci flow follows from Hamilton&#x27;s general result. Although Dennis DeTurck gave a simpler proof in the particular case of the Ricci flow, Hamilton&#x27;s result has been used for some other geometric flows for which DeTurck&#x27;s method is inaccessible.

===Harmonic map heat flow===
In 1964, James Eells and Joseph Sampson initiated the study of harmonic map heat flow, using a convergence theorem for the flow to show that any smooth map from a closed manifold to a closed manifold of nonpositive curvature can be deformed to a harmonic map. In 1975, Hamilton considered the corresponding boundary value problem for this flow, proving an analogous result to Eells and Sampson&#x27;s for the Dirichlet condition and Neumann condition. The analytic nature of the problem is more delicate in this setting, since Eells and Sampson&#x27;s key application of the maximum principle to the parabolic Bochner formula cannot be trivially carried out, due to the fact that size of the gradient at the boundary is not automatically controlled by the boundary conditions.

By a limiting procedure, Richard Schoen and Shing-Tung Yau used Hamilton&#x27;s theorem to prove that any finite-energy map from a complete Riemannian manifold to a closed Riemannian manifold of nonpositive curvature can be deformed into a finite-energy harmonic map. With the use of such maps, they were able to derive a number of purely geometric corollaries, such as restrictions on the topology of precompact open subsets with simply-connected boundary inside complete Riemannian manifolds of nonnegative Ricci curvature.

===Mean curvature flow===
In 1986, Hamilton and Michael Gage applied Hamilton&#x27;s Nash–Moser theorem and well-posedness result for parabolic equations to prove the well-posedness for mean curvature flow; they considered the general case of a one-parameter family of immersions of a closed manifold into a smooth Riemannian manifold. Then, they specialized to the case of immersions of the circle into the Euclidean plane, which is the simplest context for curve shortening flow. Using the maximum principle as applied to the distance between two points on a curve, they proved that if the initial immersion is an embedding, then all future immersions in the mean curvature flow are embeddings as well. Furthermore, convexity of the curves is preserved into the future.

Gage and Hamilton&#x27;s main result is that, given any smoothly embedded circle in the plane which is convex, the corresponding mean curvature flow exists for a finite amount of time, and as the time approaches its maximal value, the curves asymptotically become increasingly small and circular. They made use of previous results of Gage, as well as a few special results for curves, such as Bonnesen&#x27;s inequality.

In 1987, Matthew Grayson proved a complementary result, showing that for any smoothly embedded circle in the plane, the corresponding mean curvature flow eventually becomes convex. In combination with Gage and Hamilton&#x27;s result, one has essentially a complete description of the asymptotic behavior of the mean curvature flow of embedded circles in the plane. This result, sometimes known as the Gage–Hamilton–Grayson theorem, says that the curve shortening flow gives systematic and geometrically defined means of deforming an arbitrary embedded circle in the Euclidean plane into a round circle.

The modern understanding of the results of Gage–Hamilton and of Grayson usually treat both settings at once, without the need for showing that arbitrary curves become convex and separately studying the behavior of convex curves. Their results can also be extended to settings other than the mean curvature flow.

===Ricci flow===
Hamilton extended the maximum principle for parabolic partial differential equations to the setting of symmetric 2-tensors which satisfy a parabolic partial differential equation. He also put this into the general setting of a parameter-dependent section of a vector bundle over a closed manifold which satisfies a heat equation, giving both strong and weak formulations.

Partly due to these foundational technical developments, Hamilton was able to give an essentially complete understanding of how Ricci flow deforms closed Riemannian manifolds which are three-dimensional with positive Ricci curvature or nonnegative Ricci curvature, four-dimensional with positive or nonnegative curvature operator, and two-dimensional of nonpositive Euler characteristic or of positive curvature. In each case, after appropriate normalizations, the Ricci flow deforms the given Riemannian metric to one of constant curvature. This has immediate corollaries of high significance in differential geometry, such as the fact that any closed smooth 3-manifold which admits a Riemannian metric of positive curvature also admits a Riemannian metric of constant positive sectional curvature. Such results are notable in highly restricting the topology of such manifolds; the space forms of positive curvature are largely understood. There are other corollaries, such as the fact that the topological space of Riemannian metrics of positive Ricci curvature on a closed smooth 3-manifold is path-connected. Among other later developments, these &quot;convergence theorems&quot; of Hamilton were extended by Simon Brendle and Richard Schoen in 2009 to give a proof of the differentiable sphere theorem, which had been a major conjecture in Riemannian geometry since the 1960s.

In 1995, Hamilton extended Jeff Cheeger&#x27;s compactness theory for Riemannian manifolds to give a compactness theorem for sequences of Ricci flows. Given a Ricci flow on a closed manifold with a finite-time singularity, Hamilton developed methods of rescaling around the singularity to produce a sequence of Ricci flows; the compactness theory ensures the existence of a limiting Ricci flow, which models the small-scale geometry of a Ricci flow around a singular point. Hamilton used his maximum principles to prove that, for any Ricci flow on a closed three-dimensional manifold, the smallest value of the sectional curvature is small compared to its largest value. This is known as the Hamilton–Ivey estimate; it is extremely significant as a curvature inequality which holds with no conditional assumptions beyond three-dimensionality. An important consequence is that, in three dimensions, a limiting Ricci flow as produced by the compactness theory automatically has nonnegative curvature. As such, Hamilton&#x27;s Harnack inequality is applicable to the limiting Ricci flow. These methods were extended by Grigori Perelman, who due to his &quot;noncollapsing theorem&quot; was able to verify the preconditions of Hamilton&#x27;s compactness theory in a number of new contexts.

In 1997, Hamilton was able to combine his developed methods to define &quot;Ricci flow with surgery&quot; for four-dimensional Riemannian manifolds of positive isotropic curvature. For Ricci flows with initial data in this class, he was able to classify the possibilities for the small-scale geometry around points with large curvature, and hence to systematically modify the geometry so as to continue the Ricci flow past times where curvature accumulates indefinitely. As a consequence, he obtained a result which classifies the smooth four-dimensional manifolds which support Riemannian metrics of positive isotropic curvature. Shing-Tung Yau has described this article as the &quot;most important event&quot; in geometric analysis in the period after 1993, marking it as the point at which it became clear that it could be possible to prove Thurston&#x27;s geometrization conjecture by Ricci flow methods. The essential outstanding issue was to carry out an analogous classification, for the small-scale geometry around high-curvature points on Ricci flows on three-dimensional manifolds, without any curvature restriction; the Hamilton–Ivey curvature estimate is the analogue to the condition of positive isotropic curvature. This was resolved by Grigori Perelman in his renowned &quot;canonical neighborhoods theorem&quot;. Building off of this result, Perelman modified the form of Hamilton&#x27;s surgery procedure to define a &quot;Ricci flow with surgery&quot; given an arbitrary smooth Riemannian metric on a closed three-dimensional manifold. Using this as the core analytical tool, Perelman resolved the geometrization conjecture, which contains the well-known Poincaré conjecture as a special case.

===Other work===
In one of his earliest works, Hamilton proved the Earle–Hamilton fixed point theorem in collaboration with Clifford Earle. In unpublished lecture notes from the 1980s, Hamilton introduced the Yamabe flow and proved its long-time existence. In collaboration with Shiing-Shen Chern, Hamilton studied certain variational problems for Riemannian metrics in contact geometry. He also made contributions to the prescribed Ricci curvature problem.

<text>The Danish resistance movement, with the assistance of many Danish citizens, managed to evacuate 7,220 of Denmark&#x27;s 7,800 Jews, plus 686 non-Jewish spouses, by sea to nearby neutral Sweden during the Second World War. The arrest and deportation of Danish Jews was ordered by the German leader Adolf Hitler, but the efforts to save them started earlier due to the plans being leaked on September 28, 1943, by German diplomat Georg Ferdinand Duckwitz.

The rescue is considered one of the largest actions of collective resistance to aggression in the countries occupied by Germany during the Second World War. As a result of the rescue, and of the following Danish intercession on behalf of the 464 Danish Jews who were captured and deported to the Theresienstadt concentration camp in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, 99% of Denmark&#x27;s Jewish population survived the Holocaust.

== Deportation order ==

Denmark&#x27;s German occupiers began planning the deportation to Nazi concentration camps of the 7,800 or so Jews in Denmark after it became apparent that the Nazis could not expect the Danish government to support this. German diplomat Georg Ferdinand Duckwitz unsuccessfully attempted to assure safe harbor for the Danish Jews in Sweden; the Swedish government told Duckwitz it would accept the Danish Jews only if approved by the Nazis, who ignored the request for approval. 

On September 28, 1943, Duckwitz leaked word of the plans for the operation against Denmark&#x27;s Jews to Hans Hedtoft, chairman of the Danish Social Democratic Party. Hedtoft contacted the Danish Resistance Movement and the head of the Jewish community, C. B. Henriques, who in turn alerted the acting chief rabbi, Marcus Melchior. At the early morning services, on September 29, the day prior to the Rosh Hashanah services, Jews were warned by Rabbi Melchior of the planned German action and urged to go into hiding immediately and to spread the word to all their Jewish friends and relatives. The German action to deport Danish Jews prompted the Danish state church and all political parties except the pro-Nazi National Socialist Workers&#x27; Party of Denmark (NSWPD) immediately to denounce the action and to pledge solidarity with the Jewish fellow citizens. For the first time they openly opposed the occupation. At once the Danish bishops issued a &quot;hyrdebrev&quot;—a pastoral letter to all citizens. The letter was distributed to all Danish ministers, to be read out in every church on the following Sunday.

The early phases of the rescue were improvised. When Danish civil servants at several levels in different ministries learned of the German plan to round up all Danish Jews, they independently pursued various measures to find the Jews and hide them. Some simply contacted friends and asked them to go through telephone books and warn those with Jewish-sounding names to go into hiding. Most Jews hid for several days or weeks, uncertain of their fate.

==Sweden&#x27;s readiness and logistics==
Although most Danish Jews were in hiding, most would likely have been caught eventually if safe passage to Sweden had not been secured. Sweden had earlier been receiving Norwegian Jews with some sort of Swedish connection. But the actions to save the Norwegians were not entirely effective due to the lack of experience dealing with the German authorities. When martial law was introduced in Denmark on August 29, the Swedish Ministry for Foreign Affairs (UD) realized that the Danish Jews were in immediate danger. In a letter dated August 31, the Swedish ambassador in Copenhagen was given clearance by the Chief Legal Officer Gösta Engzell (who had represented Sweden at the 1938 Évian Conference, held to discuss Jewish refugees fleeing the Nazi regime) to issue Swedish passports to &quot;rescue Danish Jews and bring them here.&quot; On October 2, the Swedish government announced in an official statement that Sweden was prepared to accept all Danish Jews in Sweden. It was a message parallel to an earlier unofficial statement made to the German authorities in Norway. 

The Jews were smuggled and transported out of Denmark over the Øresund strait from Zealand to Sweden—a passage of varying time depending on the specific route and the weather, but averaging under an hour on the choppy winter sea. Some were transported in large fishing boats of up to 20 tons, but others were carried to freedom in rowboats or kayaks. The ketch &quot;Albatros&quot; and the lighthouse tender &quot;Gerda III&quot; were two of the ships used to smuggle Jews to Sweden. Some refugees were smuggled inside freight rail cars on the regular ferries between Denmark and Sweden, this route being suited for the very young or old who were too weak to endure a rough sea passage. Danish Resistance Movement operatives had broken into empty freight cars sealed by the Germans after inspection, helped refugees onto the cars, and then resealed the cars with forged or stolen German seals to forestall further inspection.

Fishermen charged on average 1,000 Danish kroner per person for the transport, but some charged up to 50,000 kroner. The average monthly wage at the time was less than 500 kroner, and half of the rescued Jews belonged to the working class. Prices were determined by the market principles of supply and demand, as well as by the fishermen&#x27;s perception of the risk. The Danish Resistance Movement took an active role in organizing the rescue and providing financing, mostly from wealthy Danes who donated large sums of money to the endeavor. In all the rescue is estimated to have cost around 20 million kroner, about half of which were paid by Jewish families and half from donations and collections.

===2 October Swedish radio broadcast===
The Danish physicist Niels Bohr, whose mother was Jewish, made a determined stand for his fellow countrymen in a personal appeal to the Swedish king and government ministers. King Gustav V granted him an audience after a persuasive call from Greta Garbo, who knew Bohr. He was spirited off to Sweden, whose government arranged immediate transport for him to the United States to work on the then top-secret Manhattan Project. When Bohr arrived on Swedish soil, government representatives told him he had to board an aircraft immediately for the United States. Bohr refused. He told the officials—and eventually the king—that until Sweden announced over its airwaves and through its press that its borders would be open to receive the Danish Jews, he was not going anywhere. Bohr wrote of these events himself. As related by the historian Richard Rhodes, on 30 September Bohr persuaded Gustaf to make public Sweden&#x27;s willingness to provide asylum, and on 2 October Swedish radio broadcast that Sweden was ready to receive the Jewish refugees. Rhodes and other historians interpret Bohr&#x27;s actions in Sweden as being a necessary precursor without which mass rescue could not have occurred. According to Paul A. Levine, however—who does not mention the Bohr factor at all—the Swedish Ministry for Foreign Affairs acted on clear instructions given much earlier by Prime Minister Per Albin Hansson and Foreign Minister Christian Günther, following a policy already established in 1942.

==Rescues==
During the first days of the rescue action, Jews moved into the many fishing harbors on the Danish coast to await passage, but officers of the Gestapo became suspicious of activity around harbors (and on the night of October 6, about 80 Jews were caught hiding in the loft of the church at Gilleleje, their hiding place having been betrayed by a Danish girl who was in love with a German soldier). Subsequent rescues had to take place from isolated points along the coast. While waiting their turn, the Jews took refuge in the woods and in cottages away from the coast, out of sight of the Gestapo.

Danish harbor police and civil police often cooperated with the rescue effort. During the early stages, the Gestapo was undermanned and the German army and navy were called in to reinforce the Gestapo in its effort to prevent transportation taking place. The local Germans in command, for their own political calculations and through their own inactivity, may have actually facilitated the escape.

===Partial list of Danish rescuers and resisters===
While only a few Danes, mostly non-resistance members who happened to be known by the Jew he or she helped, made the Yad Vashem list, there were several hundreds, if not a few thousands, of ordinary Danes who took part in the rescue efforts. They most often worked within small spontaneously organized groups and &quot;under cover&quot;. Known only by their fictitious names, they could generally not be identified by those who were helped and thus did not meet the Yad Vashem criteria for the &quot;Righteous Among the Nations&quot; honor. Below is a partial list of some of the more significant rescuers, both within and outside the formal resistance movement, whose names have surfaced over the years:

* Fanny Arnskov of the Danish chapter of the Women&#x27;s International League for Peace and Freedom
* Aage and Gerda Bertelsen, rescuers, Gerda was a leader of the Lyngby Group
* Ellen Christensen, resistance fighter, rescuer, nurse

=== &quot;Righteous among the nations&quot; ===
At their initial insistence, the Danish resistance movement wished to be honored only as a collective effort by Yad Vashem in Israel as being part of the &quot;Righteous Among the Nations&quot;; only a handful are individually named for that honor. Instead, the rescue of the Jews of Denmark is represented at Yad Vashem by a tree planting to the King and the Danish Resistance movement—and by an authentic fishing boat from the Danish village of Gilleleje. Similarly, the US Holocaust Museum in Washington, D.C., has on permanent exhibit an authentic rescue boat used in several crossings in the rescue of some 1400 Jews.

Georg Ferdinand Duckwitz, the German official who leaked word of the round-up, is also on the Yad Vashem list.

== Arrests and deportation to Theresienstadt ==
In Copenhagen, the deportation order was carried out on the Jewish New Year, the night of October 1–2, when the Germans assumed all Jews would be gathered at home. The roundup was organized by the SS who used two police battalions and about 50 Danish volunteer members of the Waffen SS chosen for their familiarity with Copenhagen and northern Zealand. The SS organized themselves in five-man teams, each with a Dane, a vehicle, and a list of addresses to check. Most teams found no one, but one team found four Jews on the fifth address checked. A bribe of 15,000 kroner was rejected, and the cash was destroyed. 

Of 580 Danish Jews who failed to escape to Sweden, 464 were arrested. 

They were allowed to bring two blankets, food for three or four days, and a small suitcase. They were transported to the harbour, Langelinie, where a couple of large ships awaited them. One of the Danish Waffen-SS members believed the Jews were being sent to Danzig.

The Danish Jews were sent ultimately to the Theresienstadt concentration camp in German-occupied Czechoslovakia. After these Jews&#x27; deportation, leading Danish civil servants persuaded the Germans to accept packages of food and medicine for the prisoners; furthermore, Denmark persuaded the Germans not to deport the Danish Jews to extermination camps. This was achieved by Danish political pressure, using the Danish Red Cross to frequently monitor the condition of the Danish Jews at Theresienstadt. A total of 51 Danish Jews—mostly elderly—died of disease at Theresienstadt.

===Rescue by Folke Bernadotte===
In April 1945, as the war drew to a close, 425 surviving Danish Jews (a few having been born in the camp) were among the several thousand Jews rescued by an operation led by Folke Bernadotte of the Swedish Red Cross who organized the transporting of interned Norwegians, Danes and western European inmates from German concentration camps to hospitals in Sweden. Around 15,000 people were taken to safety in the White Buses of the Bernadotte expedition.

==Aftermath==
About 116 Danish Jews remained hidden in Denmark until the war&#x27;s end, a few died of accidents or committed suicide, and a handful had special permission to stay. 

The casualties among Danish Jews during the Holocaust were among the lowest of the occupied countries of Europe. Yad Vashem records only 102 Jews from Denmark who were murdered in the Shoah.

The unsuccessful German deportation attempt and the actions to save the Jews were important steps in linking the resistance movement to broader anti-Nazi sentiments in Denmark. In many ways, October 1943 and the rescuing of the Jews marked a change in most people&#x27;s perception of the war and the occupation, thereby giving a &quot;subjective-psychological&quot; foundation for the legend.

A few days after the roundup, a small news item in the New York &quot;Daily News&quot; reported the story about the wearing of the Star of David . Later, the story gained its popularity in Leon Uris&#x27;s novel &quot;Exodus&quot; and in its movie adaptation. The political theorist Hannah Arendt also mentions it during the discussion of Denmark in her book of reportage, &quot;Eichmann in Jerusalem&quot;. 

== Explanations ==

Different explanations have been advanced to explain the success of efforts to protect the Danish Jewish population in the light of less success at similar operations elsewhere in Nazi-occupied Europe:

* The German Reich plenipotentiary of Denmark, Werner Best, despite instigating the roundup via a telegram he sent to Hitler on October 8, 1943, did not act to enforce it. He was aware of the efforts by Duckwitz to have the roundup cancelled, and knew about the potential escape of the Jews to Sweden, but he turned a blind eye to it, as did the Wehrmacht (which was guarding the Danish coast), in order to preserve Germany&#x27;s relationship with Denmark. According to the account of a survivor, Best himself had warned the survivor to escape.
* Logistically, the operation was relatively simple. Denmark&#x27;s Jewish population was small, both in relative and absolute terms, and most of Denmark&#x27;s Jews lived in or near Copenhagen, only a short sea voyage from neutral Sweden (typically ). Although hazardous, the boat ride was easier to conceal than a comparable land journey.
* Since the mid-19th century, a particular brand of romantic nationalism had evolved in Denmark. The traits of this nationalism included emphasis on the importance of &quot;smallness&quot;, close-knit communities, and traditions—this nationalism being largely a response to Denmark&#x27;s failure to assert itself as a great power and its losses in the Gunboat War and the Second War of Schleswig. Some historians, such as Leni Yahil (&quot;The Rescue of Danish Jewry: Test of a Democracy&quot;, 1969), believe that the Danish form of non-aggressive nationalism, influenced by Danish spiritual leader N. F. S. Grundtvig, encouraged the Danes to identify with the plight of the Jews, even though small-scale anti-Semitism had been present in Denmark long before the German invasion.
* Denmark&#x27;s Jewish population had long been thoroughly integrated into Danish society, and some members of the small Jewish community had risen to prominence. Consequently, most Danes perceived the Nazis&#x27; action against Denmark&#x27;s Jews as an affront to all Danes, and rallied to the protection of their country&#x27;s citizens.
* The deportation of Jews in Denmark came one year after the deportations of Jews in Norway. That created an outrage in all of Scandinavia, alerted the Danish Jews, and pushed the Swedish government to declare that it would receive all Jews who managed to escape the Nazis.

<text>Wanderlust is a strong desire to wander or travel and explore the world. The term has its roots in German Romanticism.

==Etymology==
The first documented use of the term in English occurred in 1902 as a reflection of what was then seen as a characteristically German predilection for wandering that may be traced back to German Romanticism and the German system of apprenticeship (the journeyman), as well as the custom of adolescent wanderings in search of unity with nature.

The term originates from the German words (&#x27;to hike&#x27;) and (&#x27;desire&#x27;), literally translated as &#x27;enjoyment of hiking&#x27;, although it is commonly described as &#x27;enjoyment of strolling, roaming about, or wandering&#x27;.

In recent years, the word is less commonly used in German, having been largely supplanted in the sense of &#x27;desire to travel&#x27; by (&#x27;a longing for far-away places&#x27;), coined as an antonym to , &#x27;homesickness&#x27;.

==Sociology==
Robert E. Park in the early twentieth century saw wanderlust as in opposition to the values of status and organisation, while postmodernism would by contrast see it largely as playfully empowering.

In post-Enlightenment Europe, upper-class bachelors were encouraged to embark upon a (roughly, &#x27;cultural education journey&#x27;), often sightseeing trips to Italy or France.

Among tourists, sociologists distinguish sunlust from wanderlust as motivating forces – the former primarily seeking relaxation, the latter engagement with different cultural experiences.

==Psychology==
Wanderlust may reflect an intense urge for self-development by experiencing the unknown, confronting unforeseen challenges, getting to know unfamiliar cultures, ways of life and behaviours or may be driven by the desire to escape and leave behind depressive feelings of guilt, and has been linked to bipolar disorder in the periodicity of the attacks.

In adolescence, dissatisfaction with the restrictions of home and locality may also fuel the desire to travel.

<text>Charles Duncan O&#x27;Neal (30 November 1879 – 19 November 1936) was a Barbadian physician, politician and workers&#x27; rights activist. He founded the radical Democratic League in 1924 and influenced the shift towards party-focused politics still seen in Barbados to the present day.

==Early life==
O&#x27;Neal was born in Saint Lucy, Barbados, to Joseph O’Neal and Kathleen O’Neal (formerly Pinnie Kathleen Prescod). His father was a blacksmith turned shopkeeper. O’Neal studied at Harrison College, and in 1899 went to study medicine at the University of Edinburgh, graduating with an MBChB on 23 July 1904.

==Political career==
While still at university, O’Neal became an active member of Kier Hardie&#x27;s Independent Labour Party. After his graduation, he served on the County Council of Sunderland, where he was influenced by his surgical work with coal miners and workers in Newcastle.

When O’Neal returned to Barbados, progressive forces had already begun to agitate for greater rights for the labouring underclass against what had continued to be a plantocratic government. He founded the Democratic League in 1924, along with Clennell Wickham.

Prior to 1942, voters were required by the Representation of the People Act to have a minimum income as well as at least an acre of land or land that produced a minimum profit. This restricted democratic participation to the wealthy elite, many of them owners of the plantations that still dominated Barbados’ sugar cane economic landscape. However, in the 1920s, villages began to expand, resulting in the rise of a newly enfranchised electorate, mostly from the working class class and of colour. The League&#x27;s early focus was the increased registration of these new voters, in an effort push through legislation that had been widely opposed by the elite. These included compulsory free education, the abolition of child labour and expanded worker protections. As a part of this and with his background in Labour and democratic socialism, O’Neal also worked towards the organization and unionization of the workers, including representing them during strike action.

O’Neal was elected to the constituency of the city of Bridgetown in 1932, a seat he held until his death on 19 November, 1936.

==Legacy==
The Democratic League shifted Barbadian politics away from a paradigm that focused on voting for individual to where the current system, where support of a party over the individual tends to guide voters. Some of the goals of O’Neal&#x27;s Democratic League were taken up by his opponents in the Barbados Labour Party after his death and some, such as free education, were later to be accomplished by the Democratic Labour Party.

One of the two main bridges over the Careenage in the capital-city Bridgetown is named the Charles Duncan O&#x27;Neal Bridge.

By an act of Parliament in 1998, O&#x27;Neal was named as one of the National Heroes of Barbados. He is on the $10 Barbados banknote.

<text>Francis Xavier Waldron (August 10, 1905 – January 31, 1961), best known by the pseudonym Eugene Dennis and Tim Ryan, was an American communist politician and union organizer, best remembered as the long-time leader of the Communist Party USA and as named party in &quot;Dennis v. United States&quot;, a famous McCarthy Era Supreme Court case.

== Biography ==
=== Early years ===
Francis Xavier Waldron was born on August 10, 1905, in Seattle, Washington. He worked in various jobs and was a member of the Industrial Workers of the World, for which he was active in California as a union organizer.

=== Political career ===
Waldron joined the Workers (Communist) Party in 1926.

In 1929, Waldron fled to the Soviet Union to avoid criminal charges for his political activities under the California Criminal Syndicalism Act.

Waldron returned to the United States in 1935 and assumed the pseudonym Eugene Dennis. Dennis became General Secretary of the party after the expulsion of Earl Browder and was a staunch supporter of the Moscow line.

On July 20, 1948, Dennis and eleven other party leaders, including Party Chairman William Z. Foster were arrested and charged under the Alien Registration Act. Foster was not prosecuted due to ill health.

As Dennis and his co-accused had never openly called for the violent overthrow of the United States government, the prosecution depended on passages from the works of Karl Marx and Vladimir Lenin that advocated revolutionary violence and on the testimony of former members of the party who claimed Dennis and others had privately advocated the use of violence.

After a nine-month-long trial and the imprisonment of the defense lawyers for contempt of court, Dennis and his co-defendants were found guilty and sentenced to five years imprisonment. They appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States, which ruled 6–2 against the defendants on June 4, 1951, in &quot;Dennis v. United States&quot;, . The Court later scaled back its Dennis opinion in &quot;Yates v. United States&quot; and rendered the broad conspiracy provisions of the Smith Act unenforceable. Eugene Dennis was imprisoned in the years 1951–1955, according to the verdict in his case.

Dennis remained General Secretary until 1959 when he succeeded Foster as party chairman and held that position until his death in 1961.

=== Espionage connections ===
Though never charged with any act of espionage, Dennis was identified in the Venona project as being a source for Soviet intelligence in the United States during World War II. In the transcripts, Dennis is referenced as a contact for a group of concealed Communists in the Office of Strategic Services and the Office of War Information.

Dennis is referenced in the following Venona transcripts:
* 708 KGB Moscow to Mexico City, 8 December 1944
* 1714 KGB New York to Moscow, 5 December 1944
* 55 KGB New York to Moscow, 15 January 1945

=== Death ===
Dennis died of cancer on January 31, 1961.

He was buried at the Waldheim Cemetery (now Forest Home Cemetery) in Forest Park, Illinois.

It is the only &quot;true fox&quot; occurring in sub-Saharan Africa, and it retains primitive characteristics of &quot;Vulpes&quot; because it diverged early in the evolutionary history of the group.

==Description==
&quot;Vulpes chama&quot; is a small-built canid, usually measuring long, not including its tail, which is typically . It is tall at the shoulder, and usually weighs from . The skull is very similar to that of &quot;V. bengalensis&quot;, although the cranium of &quot;V. chama&quot; is slightly wider and the maxillary region is slightly shorter.
The ears are relatively large and sharp, the muzzle is small and pointed. Pelage colour is silvery-gray, tawny at the back of the ears, with white hairs appearing around the side of the pinna in the center. The colour of the neck and sides is lighter, and the underparts are pale tawny to pale buff. The head is dull red and the lower jaw is dark brown. There are white marks on the throat. The legs are more tawny than the rest of the body. The tail is dense and bushy, and can be silvery, pale fawn, buff with brown or black tips, or dull yellow. The tail tip is always black, and there&#x27;s a dark spot over the caudal gland.

Pelage is soft and composed of a thick wavy underfur of around in length. Underfur is covered with a dense layer of guard hair &lt; in thickness. Molt occurs in the wet season from October to November. &quot;V. chama&quot; presents little to no sexual dimorphism.

==Distribution and habitat==
Cape fox is the only species in the genus &quot;Vulpes&quot; that exists in Africa south of the equator. It primarily occupies arid and semi-arid areas, but in sections, such as the fynbos biome of the western Cape Province of South Africa, the species reaches areas of higher rainfall and denser vegetation. In the central and western regions of southern Africa, the species is widespread, reaching around 15 ° N in south-western Angola. It is widespread in Zimbabwe, Botswana, and South Africa, occurring in most parts of the Western and Northern Cape provinces, the Eastern Cape (excluding the southeastern side), the Free State, western and northwestern KwaZulu-Natal and the North-West province. It also occurs in Lesotho, a high mountainous region.

==Behavior==
The Cape fox is nocturnal and most active just before dawn or after dusk; it can be spotted during the early mornings and early evenings. During the day, it typically shelters in burrows underground, holes, hollows, or dense thickets. It is an active digger that will excavate its own burrow, although it generally modifies an abandoned burrow of another species, such as the springhare, to its specific requirements.

Cape foxes are mostly solitary, and although they form mated pairs, the males and females are often found foraging alone. Occasionally, however, they can gather in loose groups to feed. Although &quot;V. chama&quot; shows signs of territoriality, such as scent marking, home range overlap does occur.

Although a normally silent fox, the Cape fox is known to communicate with soft calls, whines or chirps. However, it will utter a loud bark when alarmed. A long-range vocalization of yelps or yapping barks has been described, but Cape foxes apparently do not howl. When in an aggressive mood, the Cape fox is known to growl and spit at its attacker. They may use other forms of communication, such as facial expressions and tail posturing; to show its excitement, the fox lifts its tail, the height of the tail often indicating the measure of excitement.

==Ecology==
===Diet===
Cape foxes are completely omnivorous and opportunists, feeding mainly on small mammals (such as rodents) and insects, but also commonly eating birds, small reptiles, carrion and fruits. Other food items include: gerbils; field mice and other small rodents, hares, birds; bird nestlings and eggs, diverse vegetable material, including wild fruit, berries, seeds, roots, and tubers; lizards, insects, such as white ants, beetles and their larvae, and locusts. They may also consume larger mammals like steenbok (&quot;Raphicerus campestris&quot;) and other carnivores such as the yellow mongoose (&quot;Cynictis penicillata&quot;).

While Cape foxes have been reported to kill livestock, the predation level is unknown. Domestic sheep (&quot;Ovis aries&quot;) may comprise as much as 16.6% volume of its stomach content, but it appears to prey only on very young lambs (less than 3 months old), otherwise they can only consume it as carrion. They are known to cache food in holes.

===Parasites and predators===
The Cape fox can be hunted by lions (&quot;Panthera leo&quot;) and its young may be killed by the honey badger (&quot;Mellivora capensis&quot;). It is also sometimes preyed upon by black-backed jackals (&quot;Canis mesomelas&quot;) and other predators, such as African leopards (&quot;Panthera pardus&quot;), caracals (&quot;Caracal caracal&quot;), and birds of prey, such as hawks and owls.

It usually carries &quot;Echinococcus granulosus&quot; as an endoparasite and may be parasitised by fleas.

==Reproduction==

During the breeding season, in southern hemisphere winter the months of July and August, monogamous pairs may occur, but the duration and persistence from year to year is not well known. Paired adults typically only have contact during the mating season, but mouth sniffing or nuzzling (&quot;greeting&quot;) occurs, as does body slamming.

The female Cape fox has a gestation period of 51 to 53 days and gives birth to a litter of one to six cubs (or kits). They typically weigh from at birth. Reared underground in burrows, the cubs stay close to the den until they are about four months old. Several females may also share simultaneously the same den. The cubs are weaned around six to eight weeks of age, but do not begin to forage until they are four months old and often play outside during daylight hours. Both parents care for the young, with the male also providing food to the female for at least 1–2 weeks postpartum. Cubs usually become independent at 5–11.5 months of age, when they disperse (typically in June or July). Juveniles may disperse from natal den and females may remain in their natal range. Some Cape fox subadults steal food brought to the kits at the den by the parents.

A family group usually consists of the parents and their offspring, but different family groups sometimes mix during feeding. Multiple litters are possible and have been observed; however, the female usually chases out the cubs from the last litter when she is expecting another one. Cape foxes are fully grown within about a year, with both the female and the male reaching sexual maturity at 9 months. The Cape fox has a life expectancy of about six years, but can live for up to 10 years.

==Conservation==
Habitat loss does not appear to be a major factor influencing the conservation status of the Cape fox; in some regions, changing agricultural practices have resulted in range extensions for this species. As these foxes are presumed to prey on livestock, in particular lambs, they are commonly target by farmers. They are targeted by various control methods, such as leg-hold traps and the illegal but widespread use of agricultural poisons on commercial farms. These control measures do not seem to have had a major impact on populations of the Cape fox, even though they have resulted in declines in some areas. They also often succumb to diseases such as rabies and canine distemper, and a large number of Cape foxes are killed on the road by vehicles. Many are hunted and persecuted as vermin. About 2,500 individuals are killed yearly; which is approximately 16% of the population. Nonetheless, populations of &quot;V. chama&quot; are currently stable across their entire geographic range thus it is not listed in the IUCN Red List.

<text>Gerard Kitchen O&#x27;Neill (February 6, 1927 – April 27, 1992) was an American physicist and space activist. As a faculty member of Princeton University, he invented a device called the particle storage ring for high-energy physics experiments. Later, he invented a magnetic launcher called the mass driver. In the 1970s, he developed a plan to build human settlements in outer space, including a space habitat design known as the O&#x27;Neill cylinder. He founded the Space Studies Institute, an organization devoted to funding research into space manufacturing and colonization.

O&#x27;Neill began researching high-energy particle physics at Princeton in 1954, after he received his doctorate from Cornell University. Two years later, he published his theory for a particle storage ring. This invention allowed particle accelerators at much higher energies than had previously been possible. In 1965 at Stanford University, he performed the first colliding beam physics experiment.

While teaching physics at Princeton, O&#x27;Neill became interested in the possibility that humans could survive and live in outer space. He researched and proposed a futuristic idea for human settlement in space, the O&#x27;Neill cylinder, in &quot;The Colonization of Space&quot;, his first paper on the subject. He held a conference on space manufacturing at Princeton in 1975. Many who became post-Apollo-era space activists attended. O&#x27;Neill built his first mass driver prototype with professor Henry Kolm in 1976. He considered mass drivers critical for extracting the mineral resources of the Moon and asteroids. His award-winning book &quot;The High Frontier: Human Colonies in Space&quot; inspired a generation of space exploration advocates. He died of leukemia in 1992.

==Birth, education, and family life==
O&#x27;Neill was born in Brooklyn, New York, on February 6, 1927, to Edward Gerard O&#x27;Neill, a lawyer, and Dorothy Lewis O&#x27;Neill (née Kitchen). He had no siblings. His family moved to Speculator, New York when his father temporarily retired for health reasons. For high school, O&#x27;Neill attended Newburgh Free Academy in Newburgh, New York. While he was a student there he edited the school newspaper and took a job as a news broadcaster at a local radio station. He graduated in 1944, during World War II, and enlisted in the United States Navy on his 17th birthday. The Navy trained him as a radar technician, which sparked his interest in science.

After he was honorably discharged in 1946, O&#x27;Neill studied physics and mathematics at Swarthmore College. As a child he had discussed the possibilities of humans in space with his parents, and in college he enjoyed working on rocket equations. However, he did not see space science as an option for a career path in physics, choosing instead to pursue high-energy physics. He graduated with Phi Beta Kappa honors in 1950. O&#x27;Neill pursued graduate studies at Cornell University with the help of an Atomic Energy Commission fellowship, and was awarded a PhD in physics in 1954.

O&#x27;Neill married Sylvia Turlington, also a Swarthmore graduate, in June 1950. They had a son, Roger, and two daughters, Janet and Eleanor, before their marriage ended in divorce in 1966.

One of O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s favorite activities was flying. He held instrument certifications in both powered and sailplane flight and held the FAI Diamond Badge, a gliding award. During his first cross-country glider flight in April 1973, he was assisted on the ground by Renate &quot;Tasha&quot; Steffen. He had met Tasha, who was 21 years younger than him, previously through the YMCA International Club. They were married the day after his flight. They had a son, Edward O&#x27;Neill.

==High-energy physics research==
After graduating from Cornell, O&#x27;Neill accepted a position as an instructor at Princeton University. There he started his research into high-energy particle physics. In 1956, his second year of teaching, he published a two-page article that theorized that the particles produced by a particle accelerator could be stored for a few seconds in a storage ring. The stored particles could then be directed to collide with another particle beam. This would increase the energy of the particle collision over the previous method, which directed the beam at a fixed target. His ideas were not immediately accepted by the physics community.

O&#x27;Neill became an assistant professor at Princeton in 1956, and was promoted to associate professor in 1959. He visited Stanford University in 1957 to meet with Wolfgang K. H. Panofsky. This resulted in a collaboration between Princeton and Stanford to build the Colliding Beam Experiment (CBX). With a US$800,000 grant from the Office of Naval Research, construction on the first particle storage rings began in 1958 at the Stanford High-Energy Physics Laboratory. He figured out how to capture the particles and, by pumping the air out to produce a vacuum, store them long enough to experiment on them. CBX stored its first beam on March 28, 1962. O&#x27;Neill became a full professor of physics in 1965.

In collaboration with Burton Richter, O&#x27;Neill performed the first colliding beam physics experiment in 1965. In this experiment, particle beams from the Stanford Linear Accelerator were collected in his storage rings and then directed to collide at an energy of 600 MeV. At the time, this was the highest energy involved in a particle collision. The results proved that the charge of an electron is contained in a volume less than 100 attometers across. O&#x27;Neill considered his device to be capable of only seconds of storage, but, by creating an even stronger vacuum, others were able to increase this to hours. In 1979, he, with physicist David C. Cheng, wrote the graduate-level textbook &quot;Elementary Particle Physics: An Introduction&quot;. He retired from teaching in 1985, but remained associated with Princeton as &quot;professor emeritus&quot; until his death.

==Space colonization==
===Origin of the idea (1969)===

O&#x27;Neill saw great potential in the United States space program, especially the Apollo missions. He applied to the Astronaut Corps after NASA opened it up to civilian scientists in 1966. Later, when asked why he wanted to go on the Moon missions, he said, &quot;to be alive now and not take part in it seemed terribly myopic&quot;. He was put through NASA&#x27;s rigorous mental and physical examinations. During this time he met Brian O&#x27;Leary, also a scientist-astronaut candidate, who became his good friend. O&#x27;Leary was selected for Astronaut Group 6 but O&#x27;Neill was not.

O&#x27;Neill became interested in the idea of space colonization in 1969 while he was teaching freshman physics at Princeton University. His students were growing cynical about the benefits of science to humanity because of the controversy surrounding the Vietnam War. To give them something relevant to study, he began using examples from the Apollo program as applications of elementary physics. O&#x27;Neill posed the question during an extra seminar he gave to a few of his students: &quot;Is the surface of a planet really the right place for an expanding technological civilization?&quot; His students&#x27; research convinced him that the answer was no.

O&#x27;Neill was inspired by the papers written by his students. He began to work out the details of a program to build self-supporting space habitats in free space. Among the details was how to provide the inhabitants of a space colony with an Earth-like environment. His students had designed giant pressurized structures, spun up to approximate Earth gravity by centrifugal force. With the population of the colony living on the inner surface of a sphere or cylinder, these structures resembled &quot;inside-out planets&quot;. He found that pairing counter-rotating cylinders would eliminate the need to spin them using rockets. This configuration has since been known as the &quot;O&#x27;Neill cylinder&quot;.

===First paper (1970–1974)===
Looking for an outlet for his ideas, O&#x27;Neill wrote a paper titled &quot;The Colonization of Space&quot;, and for four years attempted to have it published. He submitted it to several journals and magazines, including &quot;Scientific American&quot; and &quot;Science&quot;, only to have it rejected by the reviewers. During this time O&#x27;Neill gave lectures on space colonization at Hampshire College, Princeton, and other schools. The Hampshire lecture was facilitated by O&#x27;Leary, by now an assistant professor of astronomy and science policy assessment at the institution; in 1976, he joined O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s research group at Princeton. Many students and staff attending the lectures became enthusiastic about the possibility of living in space. Another outlet for O&#x27;Neill to explore his ideas was with his children; on walks in the forest they speculated about life in a space colony. His paper finally appeared in the September 1974 issue of &quot;Physics Today&quot;. In it, he argued that building space colonies would solve several important problems: 

He explored the possibilities of flying gliders inside a space colony, finding that the enormous volume could support atmospheric thermals. He calculated that humanity could expand on this man-made frontier to 20,000 times its population. The initial colonies would be built at the Earth-Moon and Lagrange points. and are stable points in the Solar System where a spacecraft can maintain its position without expending energy. The paper was well received, but many who would begin work on the project had already been introduced to his ideas before it was even published. The paper received a few critical responses. Some questioned the practicality of lifting tens of thousands of people into orbit and his estimates for the production output of initial colonies.

While he was waiting for his paper to be published, O&#x27;Neill organized a small two-day conference in May 1974 at Princeton to discuss the possibility of colonizing outer space. The conference, titled &quot;First Conference on Space Colonization&quot;, was funded by Stewart Brand&#x27;s Point Foundation and Princeton University. Among those who attended were Eric Drexler (at the time a freshman at MIT), scientist-astronaut Joe Allen (from Astronaut Group 6), Freeman Dyson, and science reporter Walter Sullivan. Representatives from NASA also attended and brought estimates of launch costs expected on the planned Space Shuttle. O&#x27;Neill thought of the attendees as &quot;a band of daring radicals&quot;. Sullivan&#x27;s article on the conference was published on the front page of &quot;The New York Times&quot; on May 13, 1974. As media coverage grew, O&#x27;Neill was inundated with letters from people who were excited about living in space. To stay in touch with them, O&#x27;Neill began keeping a mailing list and started sending out updates on his progress. A few months later he heard Peter Glaser speak about solar power satellites at NASA&#x27;s Goddard Space Flight Center. O&#x27;Neill realized that, by building these satellites, his space colonies could quickly recover the cost of their construction. According to O&#x27;Neill, &quot;the profound difference between this and everything else done in space is the potential of generating large amounts of new wealth&quot;.

===NASA studies (1975–1977)===
O&#x27;Neill held a much larger conference the following May titled &quot;Princeton University Conference on Space Manufacturing&quot;. At this conference more than two dozen speakers presented papers, including Keith and Carolyn Henson from Tucson, Arizona.

After the conference Carolyn Henson arranged a meeting between O&#x27;Neill and Arizona Congressman Mo Udall, then a leading contender for the 1976 Democratic presidential nomination. Udall wrote a letter of support, which he asked the Hensons to publicize, for O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s work. The Hensons included his letter in the first issue of the L-5 Society newsletter, sent to everyone on O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s mailing list and those who had signed up at the conference.

In June 1975, O&#x27;Neill led a ten-week study of permanent space habitats at NASA Ames. During the study he was called away to testify on July 23 to the House Subcommittee on Space Science and Applications. On January 19, 1976, he also appeared before the Senate Subcommittee on Aerospace Technology and National Needs. In a presentation titled &quot;Solar Power from Satellites&quot;, he laid out his case for an Apollo-style program for building power plants in space. He returned to Ames in June 1976 and 1977 to lead studies on space manufacturing. In these studies, NASA developed detailed plans to establish bases on the Moon where space-suited workers would mine the mineral resources needed to build space colonies and solar power satellites.

===Private funding (1977–1978)===
Although NASA was supporting his work with grants of up to $500,000 per year, O&#x27;Neill became frustrated by the bureaucracy and politics inherent in government-funded research. He thought that small privately funded groups could develop space technology faster than government agencies. In 1977, O&#x27;Neill and his wife Tasha founded the Space Studies Institute, a non-profit organization, at Princeton University. SSI received initial funding of almost $100,000 from private donors, and in early 1978 began to support basic research into technologies needed for space manufacturing and settlement.
One of SSI&#x27;s first grants funded the development of the mass driver, a device first proposed by O&#x27;Neill in 1974. Mass drivers are based on the coilgun design, adapted to accelerate a non-magnetic object. One application O&#x27;Neill proposed for mass drivers was to throw baseball-sized chunks of ore mined from the surface of the Moon into space. Once in space, the ore could be used as raw material for building space colonies and solar power satellites. He took a sabbatical from Princeton to work on mass drivers at MIT. There he served as the Hunsaker Visiting Professor of Aerospace during the 1976–77 academic year. At MIT, he, Henry H. Kolm, and a group of student volunteers built their first mass driver prototype. The eight-foot (2.5 m) long prototype could apply 33 &quot;g&quot; (320 m/s2) of acceleration to an object inserted into it. With financial assistance from SSI, later prototypes improved this to 1,800 &quot;g&quot; (18,000 m/s2), enough acceleration that a mass driver only 520 feet (160 m) long could launch material off the surface of the Moon.

===Opposition (1977–1985)===
In 1977, O&#x27;Neill saw the peak of interest in space colonization, along with the publication of his first book, &quot;The High Frontier&quot;. He and his wife were flying between meetings, interviews, and hearings. On October 9, the CBS program &quot;60 Minutes&quot; ran a segment about space colonies. Later they aired responses from the viewers, which included one from Senator William Proxmire, chairman of the Senate Subcommittee responsible for NASA&#x27;s budget and an aggressive critic of government failure. His response was: &quot;It&#x27;s the best argument yet for chopping NASA&#x27;s funding to the bone ... I say not a penny for this nutty fantasy&quot;. He successfully eliminated spending on space colonization research from the budget. In 1978, Paul Werbos wrote for the L-5 newsletter, &quot;no one expects Congress to commit us to O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s concept of large-scale space habitats; people in NASA are almost paranoid about the public relations aspects of the idea&quot;. When it became clear that a government-funded colonization effort was politically impossible, popular support for O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s ideas started to evaporate.

Other pressures on O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s colonization plan were the high cost of access to Earth orbit and the declining cost of energy. Building solar power stations in space was economically attractive when energy prices spiked during the 1979 oil crisis. When prices dropped in the early 1980s, funding for space solar power research dried up. His plan had also been based on NASA&#x27;s estimates for the flight rate and launch cost of the Space Shuttle, numbers that turned out to have been wildly optimistic. His 1977 book quoted a Space Shuttle launch cost of $10 million, but in 1981 the subsidized price given to commercial customers started at $38 million. A 1985 accounting of the full cost of a launch in 1985 raised this as high as $180 million per flight.

O&#x27;Neill was appointed by United States President Ronald Reagan to the National Commission on Space in 1985. The commission, led by former NASA administrator Thomas Paine, proposed that the government commit to opening the inner Solar System for human settlement within 50 years. Their report was released in May 1986, four months after the Space Shuttle Challenger broke up on ascent.

==Writing career==
O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s popular science book &quot;The High Frontier: Human Colonies in Space&quot; (1977) combined fictional accounts of space settlers with an explanation of his plan to build space colonies. Its publication established him as the spokesman for the space colonization movement. It won the Phi Beta Kappa Award in Science that year, and prompted Swarthmore College to grant him an honorary doctorate. &quot;The High Frontier&quot; has been translated into five languages and remained in print as of 2008.

His 1981 book &quot;2081: A Hopeful View of the Human Future&quot; was an exercise in futurology. O&#x27;Neill narrated it as a visitor to Earth from a space colony beyond Pluto. The book explored the effects of technologies he called &quot;drivers of change&quot; on the coming century. Some technologies he described were space colonies, solar power satellites, anti-aging drugs, hydrogen-propelled cars, climate control, and underground magnetic trains. He left the social structure of the 1980s intact, assuming that humanity would remain unchanged even as it expanded into the Solar System. Reviews of &quot;2081&quot; were mixed. &quot;New York Times&quot; reviewer John Noble Wilford found the book &quot;imagination-stirring&quot;, but Charles Nicol thought the technologies described were unacceptably far-fetched.

In his book &quot;The Technology Edge&quot;, published in 1983, O&#x27;Neill wrote about economic competition with Japan. He argued that the United States had to develop six industries to compete: microengineering, robotics, genetic engineering, magnetic flight, family aircraft, and space science. He also thought that industrial development was suffering from short-sighted executives, self-interested unions, high taxes, and poor education of Americans. According to reviewer Henry Weil, O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s detailed explanations of emerging technologies differentiated the book from others on the subject.

==Entrepreneurial efforts==
O&#x27;Neill founded Geostar Corporation to develop a satellite position determination system for which he was granted a patent in 1982. The system, primarily intended to track aircraft, was called Radio Determination Satellite Service (RDSS). In April 1983 Geostar applied to the FCC for a license to broadcast from three satellites, which would cover the entire United States. Geostar launched GSTAR-2 into geosynchronous orbit in 1986. Its transmitter package permanently failed two months later, so Geostar began tests of RDSS by transmitting from other satellites. With his health failing, O&#x27;Neill became less involved with the company at the same time it started to run into trouble. In February 1991 Geostar filed for bankruptcy and its licenses were sold to Motorola for the Iridium satellite constellation project. Although the system was eventually replaced by GPS, O&#x27;Neill made significant advances in the field of position determination.

O&#x27;Neill founded O&#x27;Neill Communications in Princeton in 1986. He introduced his Local Area Wireless Networking, or LAWN, system at the PC Expo in New York in 1989. The LAWN system allowed two computers to exchange messages over a range of a couple hundred feet at a cost of about $500 per node. O&#x27;Neill Communications went out of business in 1993; the LAWN technology was sold to Omnispread Communications. As of 2008, Omnispread continued to sell a variant of O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s LAWN system.

On November 18, 1991, O&#x27;Neill filed a patent application for a vactrain system. He called the company he wanted to form &quot;VSE International&quot;, for velocity, silence, and efficiency. However, the concept itself he called &quot;Magnetic Flight&quot;. The vehicles, instead of running on a pair of tracks, would be elevated using electromagnetic force by a single track within a tube (permanent magnets in the track, with variable magnets on the vehicle), and propelled by electromagnetic forces through tunnels. He estimated the trains could reach speeds of up to 2,500 mph (4,000 km/h)—about five times faster than a jet airliner—if the air was evacuated from the tunnels. To obtain such speeds, the vehicle would accelerate for the first half of the trip, and then decelerate for the second half of the trip. The acceleration was planned to be a maximum of about one-half of the force of gravity. O&#x27;Neill planned to build a network of stations connected by these tunnels, but he died two years before his first patent on it was granted.

==Death and legacy==
O&#x27;Neill was diagnosed with leukemia in 1985. He died on April 27, 1992, from complications of the disease at the Sequoia Hospital in Redwood City, California. He was survived by his wife Tasha, his ex-wife Sylvia, and his four children. A sample of his incinerated remains was buried in space. The Celestis vial containing his ashes was attached with vials of other Celestis participants to a Pegasus XL rocket and launched into Earth orbit on April 21, 1997. It re-entered the atmosphere in May 2002.

O&#x27;Neill directed his Space Studies Institute to continue their efforts &quot;until people are living and working in space&quot;. After his death, management of SSI was passed to his son Roger and colleague Freeman Dyson. SSI continued to hold conferences every other year to bring together scientists studying space colonization until 2001.

O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s work informs the company Blue Origin founded by Jeff Bezos, which wants to build the infrastructure for future space colonization.

Henry Kolm went on to start Magplane Technology in the 1990s to develop the magnetic transportation technology that O&#x27;Neill had written about. In 2007, Magplane demonstrated a working magnetic pipeline system to transport phosphate ore in Florida. The system ran at a speed of 40 mph (65 km/h), far slower than the high-speed trains O&#x27;Neill envisioned.

All three of the founders of the Space Frontier Foundation, an organization dedicated to opening the space frontier to human settlement, were supporters of O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s ideas and had worked with him in various capacities at the Space Studies Institute. One of them, Rick Tumlinson, describes three men as models for space advocacy: Wernher von Braun, Gerard K. O&#x27;Neill, and Carl Sagan. Von Braun pushed for &quot;projects that ordinary people can be proud of but not participate in&quot;. Sagan wanted to explore the universe from a distance. O&#x27;Neill, with his grand scheme for settlement of the Solar System, emphasized moving ordinary people off the Earth &quot;en masse&quot;.

The National Space Society (NSS) gives the Gerard K. O&#x27;Neill Memorial Award for Space Settlement Advocacy to individuals noted for their contributions in the area of space settlement. Their contributions can be scientific, legislative, and educational. The award is a trophy cast in the shape of a Bernal sphere. The NSS first bestowed the award in 2007 on lunar entrepreneur and former astronaut Harrison Schmitt. In 2008, it was given to physicist John Marburger.

As of November, 2013, Gerard O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s papers and work are now located in the archives at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum, Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center.

<text>John Broughton (born 1952) is an Australian amateur astronomer and artist. He is among the most prolific discoverers of minor planets worldwide, credited by the Minor Planet Center with more than a thousand discoveries made between 1997 and 2008. His observations are done at Reedy Creek Observatory , in Queensland, Australia.

In 2002, Broughton was one of five astronomers to be awarded a &quot;Gene Shoemaker NEO Grant&quot; by the Planetary Society to support his work on near-Earth asteroids. The money enabled the purchase of a CCD camera for use initially on a 10&quot; SCT and later on a 20&quot; f/2.7 automated telescope he designed and constructed, with first light occurring 10 April 2004.

Asteroid 24105 Broughton was named in his honour in 2005, and he later won an Australian national award the 2008 Page Medal.

== Discoveries and research ==
He is the discoverer of four near-Earth objects, two of which are potentially hazardous asteroids (PHA). Discovered 11 April 2004 on the first full night of operations with the 20&quot; telescope, Apollo asteroid is one of only 157 known kilometer-size PHAs and the largest such discovery made by a non-professional astronomer. The short-period comet P/2005 T5 (Broughton) was discovered in October, 2005, followed nine months later by the hyperbolic comet C/2006 OF2 (Broughton) at a distant 7.7 AU from the sun and more than two years from reaching perihelion.

In 2003 he began observing asteroid occultations by taking trailed CCD exposures and measuring the resulting dips in brightness. Subsequently, he developed methods and applications to facilitate the observation, timing and analysis. By 2010 he had switched to using sensitive video cameras, and began designing telescopes better suited to multi-station field work than what is commercially available, culminating in collapsible alt-alt telescopes of moderate size, compact enough to take anywhere in the world in standard airline baggage. In 2011 he formulated a method to derive asteroid dimensions by integrating the results of separate occultations. The tables are periodically updated and now include over 500 asteroids.

<text>Roy A. Tucker (1951 – 2021) was an American astronomer best known for the co-discovery of near-Earth asteroid 99942 Apophis (formerly known as ) along with David J. Tholen and Fabrizio Bernardi of the University of Hawaii. He was a prolific discoverer of minor planets, credited by the Minor Planet Center with the discovery of 702 numbered minor planets between 1996 and 2010. He also discovered two comets: 328P/LONEOS–Tucker and C/2004 Q1, a Jupiter-family and near-parabolic comet, respectively.

==Biography==

Tucker was raised in Memphis, Tennessee. In 1966, he became a member of Memphis Astronomical Society and received a master&#x27;s degree in Scientific Instrumentation from the University of California, Santa Barbara. He worked as a senior engineer in the &quot;Imaging Technology Laboratory&quot; of the University of Arizona and as an instrumentalist at Kitt Peak National Observatory. He observed and discovered minor planets at his private Goodricke-Pigott Observatory in southern Arizona.

== Death ==

Tucker passed away on March 5, 2021, due to pancreatic cancer.

==Recognition==

In 2002, he was one of five researchers awarded a &quot;Gene Shoemaker Near Earth Object Grant&quot;, by the Planetary Society.

<text>Lutz Dieter Schmadel (2 July 1942, in Berlin – 21 October 2016) was a German astronomer and a prolific discoverer of asteroids, who worked at the Astronomisches Rechen-Institut (ARI) of the University of Heidelberg.

His special interest was the astrometry of minor planets. Among his numerous discoveries were the three main-belt asteroids 8661 Ratzinger, 10114 Greifswald and 11508 Stolte.

He was the author of the Dictionary of Minor Planet Names, a reference book containing information about the discovery and naming of 12,804 asteroids (March 2006). One asteroid 2234 Schmadel, discovered in 1977, was named in his honor. The asteroid 8811 Waltherschmadel was named for his father, Walther Schmadel (1902–1944), who died at the Eastern Front near Stalingrad during WWII.

== Discoveries ==
Lutz Schmadel is credited by the Minor Planet Center with the discovery of 245 minor planets made between 1960 and 1993.

<text>Alfred Ablett ( 3 August 1830 – 12 March 1897) was a British Army soldier and recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. A soldier with the Grenadier Guards during the Crimean War, he was awarded the VC for his actions on 2 September 1855, during the siege of Sebastopol.

==Early life==
Alfred Ablett was born on 3 August 1830 at Weybread, Suffolk, to Samuel and Elizabeth Ablett. He was baptised just over a month later on 3 September. According to the 1841 census, he had four older brothers, one younger brother and two younger sisters.

==Military service==
Ablett joined the army on 20 February 1850 at the age of 19 years and five months, and was assigned to the 3rd Battalion, Grenadier Guards. He served in the Crimean War, seeing action at the battles of the Alma, Inkerman and Balaclava. In early September 1855, while still a private, he performed the deed which would earn him a Victoria Cross for bravery while in the trenches at the siege of Sebastopol.

His VC citation in the &quot;London Gazette&quot; reads:
He was nominated for the award by his company captain who witnessed the event, and was among 29 men to be presented with the medal in Hyde Park, London, on 26 June 1857 by Queen Victoria. While in the Crimea he also received the Distinguished Conduct Medal and gained the rank of sergeant. 

He was one of two members of the 3rd Battalion, Grenadier Guards who earned the Victoria Cross during the Crimean War, the other being Private Anthony Palmer.

==Later life and legacy==
Ablett was invalided out of Army in October 1862 suffering from rheumatism, the result of frostbite and fever contracted in Crimea. In 1868, he was accused of attempting to kill himself with a rifle, but was found not guilty by a jury at a court in Norwich. From 1871 he served for 26 years in the London Dock Police, leaving as an inspector. He died at his home on East India Road, Poplar, London on 12 March 1897 and was buried in St Andrew&#x27;s churchyard, Weybread.

His Victoria Cross was sold for £62 in 1903, and is now held by the Grenadier Guards Regimental Headquarters, Wellington Barracks, London. His family is in possession of a replica.

<text>Korado Korlević (born 19 September 1958 in Poreč) is a Croatian teacher and prolific amateur astronomer, who ranks among the world&#x27;s top 20 discoverers of minor planets. As of 2016, he is credited by the Minor Planet Center with the discovery of 1162 numbered minor planets he made at Višnjan Observatory during 1996–2001. In addition, he is credited with the co-discovery of another 132 minor planets. His discoveries include the slowly-rotating outer main-belt asteroid 10415 Mali Lošinj, and 10645 Brač, a member of the Eunomia family of asteroids. He has also discovered two comets, namely 183P/Korlević-Jurić and 203P/Korlević.

== Career ==
Korlević became active in astronomy during his college years in Pula, where he became active within a local amateur astronomical society. He spent the next few years honing his art, by making telescopes and teaching others, including teaching posts at the Amateur Astronomical Society of Višnjan. In 1981 Korlević was qualified with a B.Sc. from the pedagogical faculty of Rijeka. Towards the end of the 1980s, after some time teaching at polytechnic schools, he co-founded the Yugoslav School of Astronomy, later known as the Višnjan School of Astronomy.

Within this organisation he was able to study meteors and asteroids more seriously, and played a central role in the forming of the International Meteor Organization as the organization formed. Korlević participated in the first International Tunguska Expedition. Motivated by new lines of research raise by this expedition, Korlević set about replacing the Višnjan Observatory&#x27;s telescope, which had been badly damaged during the Serbian attack to Croatia. In particular, the telescope was sent to Sarajevo to help the defenders during the Siege of Sarajevo. In 1995 this new telescope produced the first astrometric line, and soon Korlević and his colleagues had discovered previously undiscovered asteroids, a big breakthrough for Croatian astronomy.

The Višnjan team have built a new observatory some 4 km away in Tićan to continue their work on Near Earth Objects (NEO). On the Tićan site they have also built the world&#x27;s largest Schumann Antenna. They&#x27;ll use this to prove that meteors penetrating the ionosphere have a significant effect on Schumann resonances.


== Korlević the Educator ==

Korado Korlević was the editor of &quot;Nebeske krijesnice&quot;, an astronomy newsletter, and an often-quoted expert for astronomical articles on the topic of small bodies and impact. The teaching of astronomy, and passing his enthusiasm for it onto younger generations, is still a central priority for Korlević, and he spends much time teaching.

== Affiliations ==
Korlević is a member of the following organisations:
* International Meteor Organization
* The Planetary Society
* Spaceguard Foundation
* Astronomical Society of the Pacific
* European Council for High Ability (ECHA)
* National Geographic Society
* Croatian entomological society
* Lions International

== Awards and honours ==

<text>The Iraq Liberation Act of 1998 is a United States Congressional statement of policy stating that &quot;It should be the policy of the United States to support efforts to remove the regime headed by Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq.&quot; It was signed into law by President Bill Clinton, and states that it is the policy of the United States to support democratic movements within Iraq. The Act was cited in October 2002 to argue for the authorization of military force against Iraq.

The bill was sponsored by Representative Benjamin A. Gilman (Republican, NY-20) and co-sponsored by Representative Christopher Cox (Republican, CA-47). The bill was introduced as on September 29, 1998. The House of Representatives passed the bill 360–38 on October 5, and the Senate passed it with unanimous consent two days later. President Clinton signed the Iraq Liberation Act into law on October 31, 1998.

==Findings and declaration of policy==
The Act found that between 1980 and 1998 Iraq had:
# committed various and significant violations of international law,
# failed to comply with the obligations to which it had agreed following the Gulf War and
#further had ignored resolutions of the United Nations Security Council.
The Act declared that it was the Policy of the United States to support &quot;regime change.&quot; The Act was passed 360–38 in the U.S. House of Representatives and by unanimous consent in the Senate. US President Bill Clinton signed the bill into law on October 31, 1998. The law&#x27;s stated purpose was: &quot;to establish a program to support a transition to democracy in Iraq.&quot; Specifically, Congress made findings of past Iraqi military actions in violation of International Law and that Iraq had denied entry of United Nations Special Commission on Iraq (UNSCOM) inspectors into its country to inspect for weapons of mass destruction. Congress found: &quot;It should be the policy of the United States to support efforts to remove the regime headed by Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq and to promote the emergence of a democratic government to replace that regime.&quot; On December 16, 1998, President Bill Clinton mandated Operation Desert Fox, a major four-day bombing campaign on Iraqi targets.

President Clinton stated in February 1998:

==Support for groups opposed to Hussein==
This act required the President to designate one or more qualified recipients of assistance, with the primary requirement being opposition to the present Saddam Hussein regime. Such groups should, according to the Act, include a broad spectrum of Iraqi individuals, groups, or both, who are opposed to the Saddam Hussein regime, and are committed to democratic values, peaceful relations with Iraq&#x27;s neighbors, respect for human rights, maintaining Iraq&#x27;s territorial integrity, and fostering cooperation among democratic opponents of the Saddam Hussein regime. On February 4, 1999 President Clinton designated seven groups as qualifying for assistance under the Act. (see Note to 22 U.S.C. 2151 and 64 Fed. Reg. 67810). The groups were 
# The Iraqi National Accord,
# The Iraqi National Congress,
#The Islamic Movement of Iraqi Kurdistan,
#The Kurdistan Democratic Party,
# The Movement for Constitutional Monarchy,
# The Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, and
# The Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq.

The Act authorized the President to assist all such groups with: broadcasting assistance (for radio and television broadcasting), military assistance (training and equipment), and humanitarian assistance (for individuals fleeing Saddam Hussein). The Act specifically refused to grant the President authority to use U.S. Military force to achieve its stated goals and purposes, except as authorized under the Act in section 4(a)(2)) in carrying out this Act.

In November 1998 President Clinton stated that &quot;The evidence is overwhelming that such changes will not happen under the current Iraq leadership.&quot;

==Contemplation of post-Hussein Iraq==
The Act contemplated the future need for war crimes tribunals in Iraq stating, &quot;The Congress urges the President to call upon the United Nations to establish an international criminal tribunal for the purpose of indicting, prosecuting, and imprisoning Saddam Hussein and other Iraqi officials who are responsible for crimes against humanity, genocide, and other criminal violations of international law.&quot;

A generalized statement of policy toward the post-Hussein Iraq was also set forth stating,

It is the sense of the Congress that once the Saddam Hussein regime is removed from power in Iraq, the United States should support Iraq&#x27;s transition to democracy by providing immediate and substantial humanitarian assistance to the Iraqi people, by providing democracy transition assistance to Iraqi parties and movements with democratic goals, and by convening Iraq&#x27;s foreign creditors to develop a multilateral response to Iraq&#x27;s foreign debt incurred by Saddam Hussein&#x27;s regime.

==Precursor to war==
President George W. Bush, who followed Clinton, often referred to the Iraq Liberation Act and its findings to argue that the Clinton administration supported regime change in Iraq – and, further, that it believed Iraq was developing weapons of mass destruction. The Act was cited as a basis of support in the Congressional Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq in October 2002.

<text>Stephen O&#x27;Neill (born 19 November 1980) is an Irish former Gaelic footballer who played at senior level for the Tyrone county team. He won three All-Ireland Senior Football Championship medals, two Under 21 medals, and a Minor medal. O&#x27;Neill was the 2005 All Stars Footballer of the Year, and won All Stars Awards in 2001, 2005 and 2009.

His style of play was quite traditional as a full forward, often getting on the end of passes, and scoring with his preferred left foot. It&#x27;s his superior physical strength that set him apart from his peers, coupled with his agility on the ball, making him very difficult to mark.

O&#x27;Neill announced his retirement from the Tyrone Gaelic football team in January 2008, but made himself available for the All-Ireland final of the same year. Tyrone won the competition, but O&#x27;Neill refused to accept the medal, citing the fact that he felt he had not earned it, having not been part of the team on their journey to the final. He is from Strabane in Northern Ireland.

==Playing career==
===Club===
O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s home club is Clan na Gael in Aughabrack. With the side he has won one Tyrone Junior Football Championship and one Tyrone Intermediate Football Championship.

===Inter-county===
====Youth player====
O&#x27;Neill had success with Tyrone youth teams, winning two Ulster and All-Ireland under 21 titles in 2000 and 2001 to add to his Ulster Minor championship medals in 1997 and 1998 and his All-Ireland minor championship in 1998.

====Senior====
O&#x27;Neill burst on to the senior county scene and by 2001 had won an Ulster title and the first of his three All Star Awards. During his time with Tyrone he was first choice penalty taker – scoring three in the run up to Tyrone&#x27;s 2005 All-Ireland victory, and also shared free-taking duty with Owen Mulligan—usually dictated by who is kicking on their stronger side.

O&#x27;Neill won All-Ireland Senior Football Championship medals with Tyrone in 2003 and 2005, and the National Football League in Tyrone&#x27;s break-through year of 2002, and again in 2003. Serious injury ruled him out for much of Tyrone&#x27;s unsuccessful 2006 championship.

He won an All Stars Award in 2001 and 2005. In 2005, he was won a clean sweep of the Texaco award, the Gaelic player&#x27;s award and the Vodafone award for Footballer of the Year, after a monumental year where he scored a total of 64 points (5–49). These performances earned him a place in the Irish team in the international rules series for 2005 against Australia.

=====Retirement and return=====
Following two years where he was blighted by recurring injuries, O&#x27;Neill agreed to undergo surgery before the end of 2007 to resolve a complex knee tendinitis condition. It was hoped that this would make him fully fit for the 2008 Championship, but he announced his retirement from inter-county football at the young age of 27.

However, on 4 September 2008, it was announced that O&#x27;Neill would be available for selection for the All-Ireland final, following the approval of the other panel players who had reached the final without his contributions. This was despite the fact that a mere two days earlier he had gone on record denying a return, suggesting that his long absence would affect his match-sharpness.

O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s return to action came earlier than many expected during the 2008 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final, as a 25th minute sub for the injured Colm McCullagh. Although he failed to register a score he caused the Kerry defence a number of problems and helped Tyrone to their third Senior Football Championship win in six years. Despite being entitled to one, O&#x27;Neill refused to accept his winner&#x27;s medal, saying that he &quot;did not earn&quot; it. He was visibly upset as he was climbing the steps to be presented the trophy, and had to be consoled by teammates, such as Conor Gormley.

O&#x27;Neill helped Tyrone win another Ulster Championship in 2009, beating Antrim in the final, collecting an end of season All Stars Award, his third.

O&#x27;Neill dislocated his elbow in the final of the 2010 Dr McKenna Cup, which Tyrone lost to Donegal.

==Post-playing career==
O&#x27;Neill was brought in as part of the backroom team of his former Tyrone teammate Enda McGinley when McGinley took over as Antrim manager.

==Personal life==
O&#x27;Neill is from Aughabrack, a hamlet near Dunamanagh in the Parish of Donagheady in West Tyrone, Northern Ireland,

O&#x27;Neill is a primary school principal at St Michaels&#x27;s Primary School in Dunamanagh , County Tyrone. He previously taught at St Mary&#x27;s Primary School in Bellaghy, County Londonderry. O&#x27;Neill married Phenah McSorley from Aghyaran, County Tyrone on 9 July 2009.

<text>Joseph Prosser VC (1828 – 10 June 1867) was an Irish soldier and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Military career==
Prosser was born in Moneygall, King&#x27;s County. He was approximately 27 years old, and a private in the 2nd Battalion, 1st Regiment (later The Royal Scots), British Army during the Crimean War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross.

On 16 June 1855 at Sevastopol, Crimea, when on duty in the trenches, Private Prosser pursued and apprehended (while exposed to enemy cross-fire) a soldier in the act of deserting to the enemy. On 11 August he left the most advanced trench and helped to carry to safety a severely wounded soldier of the 95th Regiment who was unable to move. This act was performed under very heavy fire from the enemy.

==Death and legacy==

Prosser died on 10 June 1867 in Liverpool, England. He was buried at Anfield Church of England Cemetery, in section 14, grave 389. His grave was unmarked until 1995, when a headstone was erected.

Prosser&#x27;s Victoria Cross is owned (but not currently displayed) by the Royal Scots Museum in Edinburgh Castle, Scotland.

<doc id="759008" wikidata="Q23786" url="?curid=759008" title="Eye color">
<text>Eye color is a polygenic phenotypic trait determined by two factors: the pigmentation of the eye&#x27;s iris and the frequency-dependence of the scattering of light by the turbid medium in the stroma of the iris.

In humans, the pigmentation of the iris varies from light brown to black, depending on the concentration of melanin in the iris pigment epithelium (located on the back of the iris), the melanin content within the iris stroma (located at the front of the iris), and the cellular density of the stroma. The appearance of blue, green, and hazel eyes results from the Tyndall scattering of light in the stroma, a phenomenon similar to Rayleigh scattering which accounts for the blue sky. Neither blue nor green pigments are present in the human iris or vitreous humour. This is an example of structural color, which depends on the lighting conditions, especially for lighter-colored eyes.

The brightly colored eyes of many bird species result from the presence of other pigments, such as pteridines, purines, and carotenoids. Humans and other animals have many phenotypic variations in eye color.

The genetics and inheritance of eye color in humans is complicated. , as many as 16 genes have been associated with eye color inheritance. Some of the eye-color genes include &quot;OCA2&quot; and &quot;HERC2&quot;. The earlier belief that blue eye color is a recessive trait has been shown to be incorrect, and the genetics of eye color are so complex that almost any parent-child combination of eye colors can occur. 

==Genetic determination==
Eye color is an inherited trait determined by multiple genes. These genes are sought by studying small changes in the genes themselves and in neighboring genes, called single-nucleotide polymorphisms or SNPs. The total number of genes that contribute to eye color is unknown, but there are a few likely candidates. A study in Rotterdam (2009) found that it was possible to predict eye color with more than 90% accuracy for brown and blue using just six SNPs.

In humans, eye color is a highly sexually dimorphic trait. Several studies have shown that men are more likely to have blue eyes than women, while women are more likely to have darker eye colors (green and brown eyes) than men. Sex is therefore a major factor in the expression of eye color genotypes. One study suggested that women&#x27;s higher levels of the sex hormone estrogen may explain why women tend to have darker eyes than men. 

People of European descent show the greatest variety in eye color of any population worldwide. Recent advances in ancient DNA technology have revealed some of the history of eye color in Europe. Through the analysis of ancient DNA, a 2020 study published in &quot;Experimental Dermatology&quot; suggested that the common gene for blue eye color likely originated in the Near East and arrived in Europe around 42,000 years ago, after the exodus out of Africa.

There is evidence that as many as 16 different genes could be responsible for eye color in humans; however, the main two genes associated with eye color variation are &quot;OCA2&quot; and &quot;HERC2&quot;, and both are localized in chromosome 15.

The gene &quot;OCA2&quot; (), when in a variant form, causes the pink eye color and hypopigmentation common in human albinism. (The name of the gene is derived from the disorder it causes, oculocutaneous albinism type II.) Different SNPs within &quot;OCA2&quot; are strongly associated with blue and green eyes as well as variations in freckling, mole counts, hair and skin tone. The polymorphisms may be in an &quot;OCA2&quot; regulatory sequence, where they may influence the expression of the gene product, which in turn affects pigmentation. A specific mutation within the &quot;HERC2&quot; gene, a gene that regulates &quot;OCA2&quot; expression, is partly responsible for blue eyes. Other genes implicated in eye color variation are SLC24A4 and TYR. A 2010 study of eye color variation in hue and saturation values using high-resolution digital full-eye photographs found three new loci for a total of ten genes, allowing the explanation of about 50% of eye color variation.


Blue eyes with a brown spot, green eyes, and gray eyes are caused by an entirely different part of the genome.

==Changes in eye color==

A 1997 study of White Americans found that eye color may be subject to change in infancy, and from adolescence to adulthood. 17% of children experienced a change of eye color by adulthood. Of those children, 50% of developed lighter eyes as they got older. The other 50% developed darker eyes. 

Generally, children with hazel and light brown eyes tended to experience a lightening of their eye color by adulthood. Children with green eyes often experienced a darkening of their eye color. It was also found that 11% of the children&#x27;s mothers experienced an eye color change during the same period, with most developing lighter eyes, relative to their original color at the time of their child&#x27;s birth.

==Eye color range==
===Brown===
Almost all mammals have brown or darkly-pigmented irises. In humans, brown is by far the most common eye color, with approximately 79% of people in the world having it. Brown eyes result from a relatively high concentration of melanin in the stroma of the iris, which causes light of both shorter and longer wavelengths to be absorbed.

In many parts of the world, it is nearly the only iris color present. Brown eyes are common in Europe, East Asia, Southeast Asia, Central Asia, South Asia, West Asia, Oceania, West Africa and the Americas. Light or medium-pigmented brown eyes can also be commonly found in Europe, among the Americas, and parts of Central Asia, West Asia, South Asia, and East Africa. Light brown eyes bordering amber and hazel coloration are more common in Europe, but can also be observed in East Asia, Southeast Asia, North Africa and East Africa.

===Amber===

Amber eyes are a solid color with a strong yellowish/golden or russet/coppery tint, which may be due to a yellow pigment called lipochrome (also found in green eyes). Amber eyes should not be confused with hazel eyes. Although hazel eyes may contain specks of amber or gold, they usually tend to have many other colors, including green, brown, and orange. Also, hazel eyes may appear to shift in color and consist of flecks and ripples, while amber eyes are of a solid gold hue. Even though amber is similar to gold, some people have russet- or copper-colored amber eyes that are mistaken for hazel, though hazel tends to be duller and contains green with red/gold flecks, as mentioned above. Amber eyes may also contain amounts of very light gold-ish gray.

The eyes of some pigeons contain yellow fluorescing pigments known as pteridines. The bright yellow eyes of the great horned owl are thought to be due to the presence of the pteridine pigment xanthopterin within certain chromatophores (called xanthophores) located in the iris stroma. In humans, yellowish specks or patches are thought to be due to the pigment lipofuscin, also known as lipochrome. Many animals such as canines, domestic cats, owls, eagles, pigeons, and fish have amber eyes, whereas in humans this color occurs less frequently. Amber is the third-rarest natural eye color after green and gray, occurring in 5% of the world&#x27;s population. People with amber-colored eyes are found in Europe, and in fewer numbers in the Middle East, North Africa, and South America.

===Hazel===
Hazel eyes are due to a combination of Rayleigh scattering and a moderate amount of melanin in the iris&#x27; anterior border layer. Hazel eyes often appear to shift in color from a brown to a green. Although hazel mostly consists of brown and green, the dominant color in the eye can either be brown/gold or green. This is why hazel eyes can be mistaken as amber, and why amber is often counted as hazel in studies, and vice versa. The combination can sometimes produce a multicolored iris, i.e. an eye that is light brown/amber near the pupil and charcoal or dark green on the outer part of the iris (or vice versa) when observed in sunlight.

Definitions of the eye color &quot;hazel&quot; vary: it is sometimes considered to be synonymous with light brown or gold, as in the color of a hazelnut shell.

Around 18% of the US population and 5% of the world population have hazel eyes. 55.2% of Spanish subjects in a series of 221 photographs were judged to have hazel eyes. Hazel eyes are found in Europe, most commonly in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, and have also been observed to be very common among the Low Saxon-speaking populations of northern Germany.

===Green===
Green eyes probably result from the interaction of multiple allelic variants of &quot;OCA2&quot; and other genes. They may have been present in southern Siberia during the Bronze Age.

Green eyes are most common in Northern, Western, and Central Europe. Around 8–10% of men and 18–21% of women in Iceland and 6% of men and 17% of women in the Netherlands have green eyes. Among European Americans, green eyes are most common among those of recent Celtic and Germanic ancestry, occurring in about 16% of people with those backgrounds.

The green color is caused by the combination of: 1) an amber or light brown pigmentation in the stroma of the iris (which has a low or moderate concentration of melanin), and 2) a blue shade created by the Rayleigh scattering of reflected light. Green eyes contain the yellowish pigment lipochrome.
===Blue===

There is no intrinsically blue pigmentation either in the iris or in the vitreous body. Rather, blue eyes result from structural color in combination with certain concentrations of non-blue pigments. The iris pigment epithelium is brownish black due to the presence of melanin. Unlike brown eyes, blue eyes have low concentrations of melanin in the stroma of the iris, which lies in front of the dark epithelium. Longer wavelengths of light tend to be absorbed by the dark underlying epithelium, while shorter wavelengths are reflected and undergo Rayleigh scattering in the turbid medium of the stroma. This is the same scattering that accounts for the blue appearance of the sky. The result is a &quot;Tyndall blue&quot; structural color that varies with external lighting conditions.
Blue eyes are a highly sexually dimorphic eye color. Studies from various populations in Europe have shown that men are substantially more likely to have blue eyes than women.

The inheritance pattern followed by blue eyes was previously assumed to be a Mendelian recessive trait, though this has been shown to be incorrect. Eye color inheritance is now recognized as a polygenic trait, meaning that it is controlled by the interactions of several genes.

In 2008, a team of researchers from the University of Copenhagen located a single mutation that causes the phenomenon of blue eyes. The research was published in the &quot;Journal of Human Genetics&quot;. The same DNA sequence of the &quot;OCA2&quot; gene among blue-eyed people suggests they may have a single common ancestor. The researchers hypothesized that the &quot;OCA2&quot; mutation responsible for blue eyes arose in an individual who lived in the northwestern part of the Black Sea region in Europe sometime between 6,000 and 10,000 years ago, during the Neolithic period. However, more recent ancient DNA research has identified human remains much older than the Neolithic period which possess the &quot;OCA2&quot; mutation for blue eyes. It is now believed that the &quot;OCA2&quot; allele responsible for blue eyes dates back to the migration of modern humans out of Africa roughly 50,000 years ago, and entered Europe from western Asia.

Eiberg and colleagues suggested in a study published in &quot;Human Genetics&quot; that a mutation in the 86th intron of the &quot;HERC2&quot; gene, which is hypothesized to interact with the &quot;OCA2&quot; gene promoter, reduced expression of &quot;OCA2&quot; with subsequent reduction in melanin production.

It has been proposed that blue eyes may have been adaptive to shorter day lengths at higher latitudes, as blue eyes increase intraocular light scattering, which suppresses melatonin release from the pineal gland, perhaps reducing psychological depression (which is linked to the short day length of higher latitudes).

Blue eyes are predominant in northern and eastern Europe, particularly around the Baltic Sea. Blue eyes are also found in Southern Europe, Central Asia, South Asia, North Africa, and West Asia.

Approximately 8% to 10% of the global population have blue eyes. A 2002 study found the prevalence of blue eye color among the white population in the United States to be 33.8% for those born from 1936 through 1951, compared with 57.4% for those born from 1899 through 1905. , one out of every six Americans, or 16.6% of the total US population, has blue eyes, including 22.3% of whites. The incidence of blue eyes continues to decline among American children. Of Slovenes, 56% have blue/green eyes. In a series of 221 photographs of Spanish subjects, 16.3% of the subjects were determined to have blue-gray eyes.

===Gray===

Like blue eyes, gray eyes have a dark epithelium at the back of the iris and a relatively clear stroma at the front. One possible explanation for the difference in appearance between gray and blue eyes is that gray eyes have larger deposits of collagen in the stroma, so that the light that is reflected from the epithelium undergoes Mie scattering (which is not strongly frequency-dependent) rather than Rayleigh scattering (in which shorter wavelengths of light are scattered more). This would be analogous to the change in the color of the sky, from the blue given by the Rayleigh scattering of sunlight by small gas molecules when the sky is clear, to the gray caused by Mie scattering of large water droplets when the sky is cloudy. Alternatively, it has been suggested that gray and blue eyes might differ in the concentration of melanin at the front of the stroma.

Gray eyes can also be found among the Algerian Shawia people of the Aurès Mountains in Northwest Africa, in the Middle East/West Asia, Central Asia, and South Asia. In the &quot;Iliad&quot;, the Greek goddess Athene is said to have gray eyes (γλαυκῶπις). Under magnification, gray eyes exhibit small amounts of yellow and brown color in the iris.

Gray is the second-rarest natural eye color after green, with 3% of the world&#x27;s population having it.

=== Special cases ===
==== Two different colors ====

As a result of heterochromia iridum, it is also possible to have two different eye colors. This occurs in humans and certain breeds of domesticated animals and affects less than 1 percent of the world&#x27;s population.

====Red and violet====

The eyes of people with severe forms of albinism may appear red under certain lighting conditions owing to the extremely low quantities of melanin, allowing the blood vessels to show through. In addition, flash photography can sometimes cause a &quot;red-eye effect&quot;, in which the very bright light from a flash reflects off the retina, which is abundantly vascular, causing the pupil to appear red in the photograph.

Although the deep blue eyes of some people such as Elizabeth Taylor can appear purple or violet at certain times, &quot;true&quot; violet-colored eyes occur only due to albinism. Eyes that appear red or violet under certain conditions due to albinism occur in less than 1 percent of the world&#x27;s population.

==Medical implications==
The most important role of melanin in the iris is to protect the eyes from the sun&#x27;s harmful rays. People with lighter eye colors, such as blue or green, have lessened protection from the sun, and so need greater protection from the sun&#x27;s rays than those with darker eye colors.

Those with lighter iris color have been found to have a higher prevalence of age-related macular degeneration (ARMD) than those with darker iris color; lighter eye color is also associated with an increased risk of ARMD progression. A gray iris may indicate the presence of a uveitis, and an increased risk of uveal melanoma has been found in those with blue, green or gray eyes. However, a study in 2000 suggests that people with dark brown eyes are at increased risk of developing cataracts and therefore should protect their eyes from direct exposure to sunlight.

===Wilson&#x27;s disease===

Wilson&#x27;s disease involves a mutation of the gene coding for the enzyme ATPase 7B, which prevents copper within the liver from entering the Golgi apparatus in cells. Instead, the copper accumulates in the liver and in other tissues, including the iris of the eye. This results in the formation of Kayser–Fleischer rings, which are dark rings that encircle the periphery of the iris.

===Coloration of the sclera===
Eye color outside of the iris may also be symptomatic of disease. Yellowing of the sclera (the &quot;whites of the eyes&quot;) is associated with jaundice, and may be symptomatic of liver diseases such as cirrhosis or hepatitis. A blue coloration of the sclera may also be symptomatic of disease.

===Aniridia===

Aniridia is a congenital condition characterized by an extremely underdeveloped iris, which appears absent on superficial examination.

===Ocular albinism and eye color===
Normally, there is a thick layer of melanin on the back of the iris. Even people with the lightest blue eyes, with no melanin on the front of the iris at all, have dark brown coloration on the back of it, to prevent light from scattering around inside the eye. In those with milder forms of albinism, the color of the iris is typically blue but can vary from blue to brown. In severe forms of albinism, there is no pigment on the back of the iris, and light from inside the eye can pass through the iris to the front. In these cases, the only color seen is the red from the hemoglobin of the blood in the capillaries of the iris. Such albinos have pink eyes, as do albino rabbits, mice, or any other animal with a total lack of melanin. Transillumination defects can almost always be observed during an eye examination due to lack of iridial pigmentation. The ocular albino also lacks normal amounts of melanin in the retina as well, which allows more light than normal to reflect off the retina and out of the eye. Because of this, the pupillary reflex is much more pronounced in albino individuals, and this can emphasize the red eye effect in photographs.

===Heterochromia===

Heterochromia (&quot;heterochromia iridum&quot; or &quot;heterochromia iridis&quot;) is an eye condition in which one iris is a different color from the other (complete heterochromia), or where a part of one iris is a different color from the remainder (partial heterochromia or sectoral heterochromia). It is a result of the relative excess or lack of pigment within an iris or part of an iris, which may be inherited or acquired by disease or injury. This uncommon condition usually results due to uneven melanin content. A number of causes are responsible, including genetic, such as chimerism, Horner&#x27;s syndrome and Waardenburg syndrome.

A chimera can have two different colored eyes just like any two siblings can—because each cell has different eye color genes. A mosaic can have two different colored eyes if the DNA difference happens to be in an eye-color gene.

There are many other possible reasons for having two different-colored eyes. For example, the film actor Lee Van Cleef was born with one blue eye and one green eye, a trait that reportedly was common in his family, suggesting that it was a genetic trait. This anomaly, which film producers thought would be disturbing to film audiences, was &quot;corrected&quot; by having Van Cleef wear brown contact lenses. David Bowie, on the other hand, had the appearance of different eye colors due to an injury that caused one pupil to be permanently dilated.

Another hypothesis about heterochromia is that it can result from a viral infection &quot;in utero&quot; affecting the development of one eye, possibly through some sort of genetic mutation. Occasionally, heterochromia can be a sign of a serious medical condition.

A common cause in females with heterochromia is X-inactivation, which can result in a number of heterochromatic traits, such as calico cats. Trauma and certain medications, such as some prostaglandin analogues, can also cause increased pigmentation in one eye. On occasion, a difference in eye color is caused by blood staining the iris after injury.

== Limbal ring ==

The limbal ring is also a feature of the iris contributing to eye color, appearing as a darkened, occasionally black region encircling the iris resulting from a manifestation of the optical properties of the corneal limbus. Limbal rings are not present in all individuals, and their thickness and prominence may correlate with health or youthfulness, and contributes to facial attractiveness.

== Impact on vision ==
Although people with lighter eye color are generally more sensitive to light because they have less pigment in the iris to protect them from sunlight, there is little to no evidence that eye color has a direct impact on vision qualities such as visual acuity. However, there is a study that found that dark-eyed people perform better at &quot;reactive-type tasks&quot;, which suggests they may have better reaction times. People with light-colored eyes, however, performed better at so-called &quot;self-paced tasks&quot;, which include activities like hitting a golf ball or throwing baseballs. In another study, people with darker eyes performed better at hitting racquetballs. There are also other studies that challenge these findings, and more study is needed to verify these results.

==Classification of color==
Iris color can provide a large amount of information about a person, and a classification of colors may be useful in documenting pathological changes or determining how a person may respond to ocular pharmaceuticals. Classification systems have ranged from a basic light or dark description to detailed gradings employing photographic standards for comparison. Others have attempted to set objective standards of color comparison.

The Martin–Schultz scale, developed from the Martin scale, is one standard color scale used in physical anthropology to establish the eye color of an individual. It was created by the anthropologists Rudolf Martin and Bruno K Schultz in the first half of the 20th century. The scale consists of 20 colors ranging from light blue to dark brown-black, corresponding to natural eye colors caused by the amount of melanin in the iris:

Normal eye colors range from the darkest shades of brown to the lightest tints of blue. To meet the need for standardized classification, at once simple yet detailed enough for research purposes, Seddon et al. developed a graded system based on the predominant iris color and the amount of brown or yellow pigment present. There are three pigment colors that determine, depending on their proportion, the outward appearance of the iris, along with structural color. Green irises, for example, have some yellow and the blue structural color. Brown irises contain more or less melanin. Some eyes have a dark ring around the iris, called a limbal ring.

Eye color in non-human animals is regulated differently. For example, instead of blue as in humans, autosomal recessive eye color in the skink species &quot;Corucia zebrata&quot; is black, and the autosomal dominant color is yellow-green.

As the perception of color depends on viewing conditions (e.g., the amount and kind of illumination, as well as the hue of the surrounding environment), so does the perception of eye color.

<text>was a Japanese astronomer. He was a prolific discoverer of asteroids, observing at Nihondaira Observatory.

In 1978 he became the first amateur to discover a minor planet (2090 Mizuho) in over fifty years, which he named after his daughter, Mizuho. His pioneering feat led to an upsurge in such discoveries. In the ten years that followed, amateurs from Japan discovered 160 minor planets. Urata shared his observation data with peer astronomers in Japan on a periodical called &quot;Tenkai&quot; (the Heavens), as well as contributed to academic journals such as &quot;Advances in Space Research&quot; and participated in poster presentations at astronomical conferences.

Urata co-discovered the periodic comet 112P/Urata-Niijima in 1986. One of the most active amateur astronomers in Japan, he was also an editor of the Japanese &quot;Ephemerides of Minor Planets&quot;. The 1927-discovered asteroid 3722 Urata is named after him.

<doc id="759021" wikidata="Q450446" url="?curid=759021" title="Oliver Onions">
<text>George Oliver Onions (13 November 1873 – 9 April 1961), who published under the name Oliver Onions, was an English writer of short stories and novels. He wrote in various genres, but is perhaps best remembered for his ghost stories, notably the collection &quot;Widdershins&quot; and the widely anthologized novella &quot;The Beckoning Fair One&quot;. He was married to the novelist Berta Ruck.

==Personal life==
George Oliver Onions was born on 13 November 1873 in Bradford, Yorkshire, England, to George Frederick Onions, a bank cashier (born 1847, London, England) and Emily Alice Fearnley (born 1850, Scholes, Yorkshire, England). He studied art for three years in London at the National Arts Training Schools (now the Royal College of Art). In the book &quot;Twentieth Century Authors&quot;, Onions described his interests as and science; he was also an amateur boxer as a young man.

In 1909, Onions married the writer Berta Ruck (1878–1978) and they had two sons: Arthur (born 1912) and William (born 1913). In 1918, he legally changed his name to George Oliver, but continued to publish under the name Oliver Onions.

He died on 9 April 1961 in Aberystwyth, Wales.

==Writing career==
Originally trained as a commercial artist, he worked as a designer of posters and books and as a magazine illustrator during the Boer War. Encouraged by the American writer Gelett Burgess, Onions began writing fiction. The first editions of his novels were published with dust jackets bearing full-colour illustrations painted by Onions himself.

&quot;Poor Man&#x27;s Tapestry&quot; (1946) and its prequel, &quot;Arras of Youth&quot; (1949) are about the adventures of a juggler, Robert Gandelyn, in the 14th century. &quot;The Story of Ragged Robyn&quot; (1945) focuses on the adventures of the titular stonemason at the end of the 17th century. Onions wrote two detective novels: &quot;A Case in Camera&quot; and &quot;In Accordance with the Evidence&quot;. Two of his works are science fiction novels: &quot;New Moon&quot; (1918) about a utopian Britain, and &quot;The Tower of Oblivion&quot; (1921), featuring a middle-aged man who recedes back to his youth. &quot;A Certain Man&quot; (1931), about a magical suit of clothes, and &quot;A Shilling to Spend&quot; (1965), about a self-perpetuating coin, are fantasy novels.

Onions wrote several collections focusing on ghost stories and other weird fiction. The best known of these collections is &quot;Widdershins&quot; (1911). It includes the novella &quot;The Beckoning Fair One&quot;, widely placed among the best in the genre of horror fiction, especially psychological horror. On the surface, it is a conventional haunted house story: an unsuccessful writer moves into rooms in an otherwise empty house, in the hope that isolation will help his failing creativity. His sensitivity and imagination are enhanced by his seclusion, but his art, his only friend and his sanity are all destroyed in the process. The story can be read as narrating the gradual possession of the protagonist by a mysterious and possessive feminine spirit, or as a realistic description of a psychotic outbreak culminating in catatonia and murder, told from the psychotic subject&#x27;s point of view. The precise description of the slow disintegration of the protagonist&#x27;s mind is terrifying in either case.

A theme that &quot;The Beckoning Fair One&quot; shares with others of Onions&#x27;s stories is a connection between creativity and insanity; here the artist is in danger of withdrawing from the world altogether and losing himself in his creation. Another noted story from &quot;Widdershins&quot; is &quot;Rooum&quot;, about an engineer pursued by a mysterious entity. Other ghost stories such as &quot;The Cigarette Case&quot;, &quot;The Rosewood Door&quot; and &quot;The Rope in the Rafters&quot; involve time and identity shifts.

The title novella of &quot;The Painted Face&quot; (1929) concerns a Greek girl&#x27;s reincarnation of an ancient spirit; Mike Ashley describes it as &quot;one of the finest works in the genre&quot;. The collection also contains &quot;The Master of the House&quot;, a story involving a werewolf and black magic.

A long supernatural horror novel is &quot;The Hand of Kornelius Voyt&quot;, about an isolated boy who falls under the psychic influence of a mysterious man. Onions was awarded the James Tait Black Memorial Prize for his 1946 novel &quot;Poor Man&#x27;s Tapestry&quot;.

==Reception and influence==
Onions&#x27; work has largely been well received. Gahan Wilson ranked him as &quot;one of the best, if not the best, ghost story writers working in the English language. ... Mr. Onions did as much as anyone to move phantoms and other haunts from dark, Gothic dungeons to the very room in which you presently sit.&quot; Discussing ghost stories, Algernon Blackwood described &quot;The Beckoning Fair One&quot; as &quot;the most horrible and beautiful ever written on those lines&quot;. J. B. Priestley described &quot;Widdershins&quot; as a &quot;book of fine creepy stories&quot;. Fellow ghost story writer A. M. Burrage said of Onions&#x27; work, &quot;There is some hair-raising stuff in &quot;Widdershins&quot;&quot;, and added &quot;there is great literary excellence in this book, besides satisfaction for the mere seeker after thrills.&quot; Robert Aickman named &quot;The Beckoning Fair One&quot; as &quot;one of the (possibly) six great masterpieces in the field&quot;. E. F. Bleiler lauded &quot;Widdershins&quot; as &quot;a landmark book in the history of supernatural fiction&quot;. Clemence Dane stated of Onions, &quot;His books have a lasting attraction for a reader who enjoys using his brains and his imagination.&quot; An &quot;Irish Times&quot; review of &quot;Arras of Youth&quot; stated, &quot;Mr. Onions writes limpid and often beautiful prose.&quot; Martin Seymour-Smith described Onions&#x27;s &quot;Whom God Hath Sundered&quot; trilogy as a neglected classic: &quot;&quot;In Accordance with the Evidence&quot; is the masterpiece of the three, but the other sequels in no way disgrace it.&quot; Neil Wilson calls Onions&#x27; supernatural works &quot;notable for their depth of psychological insight, elegant writing and sophisticated plots&quot;. Wilson notes that
&#x27;The Beckoning Fair One&#x27; (1911) is regarded by many as one of the greatest English tales of the supernatural but has overshadowed Onions&#x27; other work in the genre which some consider of equal, if not greater, importance. In fact, the majority of the author&#x27;s supernatural fiction is of an extremely high standard and is notable for its originality, subtlety and careful characterizations which lift it well above the average.

On the other hand, H.P. Lovecraft&#x27;s assessment of Onions&#x27; work was negative; in a 1936 letter to J. Vernon Shea, Lovecraft stated, &quot;I have Onions&#x27; &quot;Ghosts in Daylight&quot;. ... I didn&#x27;t care much for the various tales.&quot;

Karl Edward Wagner&#x27;s short story &quot;In the Pines&quot; (1973) pays homage to Onions&#x27;s &quot;The Beckoning Fair One&quot;. &quot;The Beckoning Fair One&quot; was also the inspiration for a 1968 Italian/French horror film called &quot;A Quiet Place in the Country&quot; by prominent Italian director Elio Petri, starring Vanessa Redgrave and Franco Nero. Russell Hoban alludes to Onions&#x27; work in his books &quot;Her Name Was Lola&quot; and &quot;Amaryllis Night and Day&quot;.

<text>Werner Eduard Fritz von Blomberg (2 September 1878 – 13 March 1946) was a German General Staff officer and the first Minister of War in Adolf Hitler&#x27;s government. After serving on the Western Front in World War I, Blomberg was appointed chief of the &quot;Truppenamt&quot; (&quot;Troop Office&quot;) during the Weimar Republic. Following the Nazis&#x27; rise to power, he was named Minister of War and Commander-in-Chief of the German Armed Forces. In this capacity, Blomberg played a central role in Germany&#x27;s military build-up during the years leading to World War II. However, by 20 January 1938, he was forced to resign after his rivals, Hermann Göring and Heinrich Himmler, presented Hitler with evidence that his wife had posed in the past for pornographic photos.

==Early life and career==
Born in Stargard, Germany (now Stargard, Poland) to a noble Baltic German family, Werner von Blomberg joined the army in 1897 and attended the Prussian Military Academy in 1904. In April 1904, he married Charlotte Hellmich. The couple had five children.

Graduated from the academy in 1907, Blomberg entered the German General Staff in 1908. Serving with distinction on the Western Front during the First World War, Blomberg was awarded the &quot;Pour le Mérite&quot;.

In 1920, Blomberg was appointed chief of staff of the Döberitz Brigade; in 1921, he was appointed chief of staff of the Stuttgart Army Area. In 1925, General Hans von Seeckt appointed him chief of army training. By 1927, Blomberg was a major-general and chief of the Troop Office (&quot;&quot;), the thin disguise for the German General Staff, which had been forbidden by the Treaty of Versailles.

==In the Weimar Republic==
In 1928, Blomberg visited the Soviet Union, where he was much impressed by the high status of the Red Army, and left a convinced believer in the value of totalitarian dictatorship as the prerequisite for military power.

This was part of a broader shift on the part of the German military to the idea of a totalitarian &quot;Wehrstaat&quot; () which, beginning in the mid-1920s, became increasingly popular with military officers. The German historian Eberhard Kolb wrote that:

Blomberg&#x27;s visit to the Soviet Union in 1928 confirmed his view that totalitarian power fosters the greatest military power. Blomberg believed the next world war, as the previous one, would become a total war, requiring full mobilization of German society and economy by the state, and that a totalitarian state would best prepare society in peacetime, militarily and economically, for war. As most of Nazi Germany&#x27;s military elite, Blomberg took for granted that, for Germany to achieve the world power that it had unsuccessfully sought in the First World War would require another war, and that such a war would be total war of a highly mechanized, industrial type.

In 1929, Blomberg came into conflict with General Kurt von Schleicher at the &quot;Truppenamt&quot; and was removed from his post and appointed military commander in East Prussia. Early that year, Schleicher had started a policy of &quot;frontier defense&quot; (&quot;Grenzschutz&quot;) under which the Reichswehr would stockpile arms in secret depots and begin training volunteers beyond the limits imposed by the Treaty of Versailles in the eastern parts of Germany bordering Poland; in order to avoid incidents with France, there was to be no such &quot;Grenzschutz&quot; in western Germany.

The French planned to withdraw from the Rhineland in June 1930 – five years earlier than specified by the Treaty of Versailles – and Schleicher wanted no violations of the Treaty that might seem to threaten France before French troops left the Rhineland. When Blomberg, whom Schleicher personally disliked, insisted on extending &quot;Grenzschutz&quot; to areas bordering France, Schleicher in August 1929 leaked to the press that Blomberg had attended armed maneuvers by volunteers in Westphalia. Defence Minister General Wilhelm Groener called Blomberg to Berlin to explain himself. Blomberg expected Schleicher to stick to the traditional &quot;Reichswehr&quot; policy of denying everything, and was shocked to see Schleicher instead attack him in front of Groener as a man who had recklessly exposed Germany to the risk of providing the French with an excuse to remain in the Rhineland until 1935.

As a result, Blomberg was demoted from command of the &quot;Truppenamt&quot; and sent to command a division in East Prussia. Since East Prussia was cut off from the rest of Germany and had only one infantry division stationed there, Blomberg—to increase the number of fighting men in the event of a war with Poland—started to make lists of all the men fit for military service, which further increased the attraction of a totalitarian state able to mobilize an entire society for war to him, and of an ideologically motivated &quot;levée en masse&quot; as the best way to fight the next war. During his time as commander of Wehrkreis I, the military district which comprised East Prussia, Blomberg fell under the influence of a Nazi-sympathizing Lutheran chaplain, Ludwig Müller, who introduced Blomberg to Nazism. Blomberg cared little for Nazi doctrines &quot;per se&quot;, his support for the Nazis being motivated by his belief that only a dictatorship could make Germany a great military power again, and that the Nazis were the best party to establish a dictatorship in Germany.

Because he had the command of only one infantry division in East Prussia, Blomberg depended very strongly on &quot;Grenzschutz&quot; to increase the number of fighting men available. This led him to co-operate closely with the SA as a source of volunteers for &quot;Grenzschutz&quot; forces. Blomberg had excellent relations with the SA at this time, which led to the SA serving by 1931 as an unofficial militia backing up the &quot;Reichswehr&quot;. Many generals saw East Prussia as a model for future Army-Nazi co-operation all over Germany.

Blomberg&#x27;s interactions with the SA in East Prussia led him to the conclusion that Nazis made for excellent soldiers, which further increased the appeal of Nazism for him. But at the same time, Blomberg saw the SA only as a junior partner to the Army, and utterly opposed the SA&#x27;s ambitions to replace the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; as Germany&#x27;s main military force. Blomberg, like almost all German generals, envisioned a future Nazi-Army relationship where the Nazis would indoctrinate ordinary people with the right sort of ultra-nationalist, militarist values so that when young German men joined the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; they would be already half-converted into soldiers while at the same time making it clear that control of military matters would rest solely with the generals. In 1931, he visited the US, where he openly proclaimed his belief in the certainty and the benefits of a Nazi government for Germany. Blomberg&#x27;s first wife Charlotte died on 11 May 1932, leaving him with two sons and three daughters.

In 1932, Blomberg served as part of the German delegation to the World Disarmament Conference in Geneva where, during his time as the German chief military delegate, he not only continued his pro-Nazi remarks to the press, but used his status as Germany&#x27;s chief military delegate to communicate his views to Paul von Hindenburg, whose position as President of Germany made him German Supreme Commander in Chief.

In his reports to Hindenburg, Blomberg wrote that his arch-rival Schleicher&#x27;s attempts to create the &quot;Wehrstaat&quot; had clearly failed, and that Germany needed a new approach to forming the &quot;Wehrstaat&quot;. By late January 1933, it was clear that the Schleicher government could only stay in power by proclaiming martial law and by authorizing the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; to crush popular opposition. In doing so, the military would have to kill hundreds, if not thousands of German civilians; any régime established in this way could never expect to build the national consensus necessary to create the &quot;Wehrstaat&quot;. The military had decided that Hitler alone was capable of peacefully creating the national consensus that would allow the creation of the &quot;Wehrstaat&quot;, and thus the military successfully brought pressure on Hindenburg to appoint Hitler as Chancellor.

In late January 1933, President Hindenburg—without informing the chancellor, Schleicher, or the army commander, General Kurt von Hammerstein—recalled Blomberg from the World Disarmament Conference to return to Berlin. Upon learning of this, Schleicher guessed correctly that the order to recall Blomberg to Berlin meant his own government was doomed. When Blomberg arrived at the railroad station in Berlin on 28 January 1933, he was met by two officers, Adolf-Friedrich Kuntzen and Oskar von Hindenburg, adjutant and son of President Hindenburg. Kuntzen had orders from Hammerstein for Blomberg to report at once to the Defense Ministry, while Oskar von Hindenburg had orders for Blomberg to report directly to the Palace of the Reich President.

Over and despite Kuntzen&#x27;s protests, Blomberg chose to go with Hindenburg to meet the president, who swore him in as defense minister. This was done in a manner contrary to the Weimar constitution, under which the president could only swear in a minister after receiving the advice of the chancellor. Hindenburg had not consulted Schleicher about his wish to see Blomberg replace him as defense minister because in late January 1933, there were wild (and untrue) rumors circulating in Berlin that Schleicher was planning to stage a &quot;putsch&quot;. To counter alleged plans of a &quot;putsch&quot; by Schleicher, Hindenburg wanted to remove Schleicher as defense minister as soon as possible.

Two days later, on 30 January 1933, Hindenburg swore in Adolf Hitler as Chancellor, after telling him that Blomberg was to be his defense minister regardless of his wishes. Hitler for his part welcomed and accepted Blomberg.

==Minister of Defense==
In 1933, Blomberg rose to national prominence when he was appointed Minister of Defense in Hitler&#x27;s government. Blomberg became one of Hitler&#x27;s most devoted followers and worked feverishly to expand the size and the power of the army. Blomberg was made a colonel general for his services in 1933. Although Blomberg and his predecessor, Kurt von Schleicher, loathed each other, their feud was purely personal, not political, and in all essentials, Blomberg and Schleicher had identical views on foreign and defense policies. Their dispute was simply over who was best qualified to carry out the policies, not the policies themselves.

Blomberg was chosen personally by Hindenburg as a man he trusted to safeguard the interests of the Defense Ministry and could be expected to work well with Hitler. Above all, Hindenburg saw Blomberg as a man who would safeguard the German military&#x27;s traditional &quot;state within the state&quot; status dating back to Prussian times under which the military did not take orders from the civilian government, headed by the chancellor, but co-existed as an equal alongside the civilian government because of its allegiance only to the head of state, not the chancellor, who was the head of government. Until 1918, the head of state had been the emperor, and since 1925, it had been Hindenburg himself. Defending the military &quot;state within the state&quot; and trying to reconcile the military to the Nazis was to be one of Blomberg&#x27;s major concerns as a defense minister.

Blomberg was an ardent supporter of the Nazi regime and cooperated with it in many capacities, including serving on the Academy for German Law. On 20 July 1933, Blomberg had a new Army Law passed, which ended the jurisdiction of civil courts over the military and extinguished the theoretical right for the military to elect councils although that right, despite being guaranteed by the Weimar Constitution in 1919, had never been put into practice.

Blomberg&#x27;s first act as defense minister was to carry out a purge of the officers associated with his hated archenemy, Schleicher. Blomberg sacked Ferdinand von Bredow as chief of the &quot;Ministeramt&quot; and replaced him with General Walter von Reichenau, Eugen Ott was dismissed as chief of the &quot;Wehramt&quot; and sent to Japan as a military attaché and General Wilhelm Adam was sacked as chief of the &quot;Truppenamt&quot; (the disguised General Staff) and replaced with Ludwig Beck. The British historian Sir John Wheeler-Bennett wrote about the &quot;ruthless&quot; way that Blomberg set about isolating and undermining the power of the army commander-in-chief, a close associate of Schleicher, General Kurt von Hammerstein-Equord, to the point that in February 1934 Hammerstein finally resigned in despair, as his powers had become more nominal than real. With Hammerstein&#x27;s resignation, the entire Schleicher faction that had dominated the army since 1926 had been removed from their positions within the High Command. Wheeler-Bennett commented that as a military politician Blomberg was every bit as ruthless, as Schleicher had been. The resignation of Hammerstein caused a crisis in military-civil relations when Hitler attempted to appoint as his successor Reichenau, a man who was not acceptable to the majority of the &quot;Reichswehr&quot;. Blomberg supported the attempt to appoint Reichenau, but reflecting the power of the &quot;state within the state&quot;, certain Army officers appealed to Hindenburg, which led to Werner von Fritsch being appointed instead.

Far more serious than dealing with the followers of Schleicher was Blomberg&#x27;s relations with the SA. He was resolutely opposed to any effort to subject the military to the control of the Nazi Party or that of any of its affiliated organizations such as the SA or the SS, and throughout his time as a minister, he fought fiercely to protect the institutional autonomy of the military.

By the autumn of 1933, Blomberg had come into conflict with Ernst Röhm, who made it clear that he wanted to see the SA absorb the &quot;Reichswehr&quot;, a prospect that Blomberg was determined to prevent at all costs. In December 1933, he made clear to Hitler his displeasure about Röhm being appointed to the Cabinet. In February 1934, when Röhm penned a memo about the SA absorbing the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; to become the new military force, Blomberg informed Hitler that the Army would never accept it under any conditions. On 28 February 1934, Hitler ruled the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; would be the main military force, and the SA was to remain a political organization. Despite the ruling, Röhm continued to press for a greater role for the SA. In March 1934, Blomberg and Röhm began openly fighting each other at cabinet meetings and exchanging insults and threats. As a result of his increasingly-heated feud with Röhm, Blomberg warned Hitler that he must curb the ambitions of the SA, or the Army would do so itself.

To defend the military &quot;state within the state&quot;, Blomberg followed a strategy of Nazifying the military more and more in a paradoxical effort to persuade Hitler that it was not necessary to end the traditional &quot;state within the state&quot; to prevent &quot;Gleichschaltung&quot; being imposed by engaging in what can be called a process of &quot;self-Gleichschaltung&quot;.
In February 1934, Blomberg, on his own initiative, had all of the men considered to be Jews serving in the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; given an automatic and immediate dishonorable discharge. As a result, 74 soldiers lost their jobs for having &quot;Jewish blood&quot;. The Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service, enacted in April 1933, had excluded Jews who were First World War veterans and did not apply to the military. Thereby, Blomberg&#x27;s discharge order was his way of circumventing the law and went beyond what even the Nazis then wanted. The German historian Wolfram Wette called the order &quot;an act of proactive obedience&quot;.

The German historian wrote that Blomberg&#x27;s anti-Semitic purge in early 1934 was part of his increasingly-savage feud with Röhm, who since the summer of 1933 had been drawing unfavorable comparisons between the &quot;racial purity&quot; of his SA, which had no members with &quot;Jewish&quot; blood, and the &quot;Reichswehr&quot;, which had some. Müller wrote that Blomberg wanted to show Hitler that the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; was even more loyal and ideologically sound than was the SA and that purging &quot;Reichswehr&quot; members who could be considered Jewish without being ordered to do so was an excellent way to demonstrate loyalty within the Nazi regime. As both the Army and the Navy had longstanding policies of refusing to accept Jews, there were no Jews to purge within the military. Instead, Blomberg used the Nazi racial definition of a Jew in his purge. None of the men given dishonorable discharges themselves practiced Judaism, but they were the sons or grandsons of Jews who had converted to Christianity and thus were considered to be &quot;racially&quot; Jewish.

Blomberg ordered every member of the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; to submit documents to their officers and that anyone who was a &quot;non-Aryan&quot; or refused to submit documents would be dishonorably discharged. As a result, seven officers, eight officer cadets, 13 NCOs and 28 privates from the Army, and three officers, four officer candidates, three NCOs and four sailors from the Navy were dishonorably discharged, together with four civilian employees of the Defense Ministry. With the exception of Erich von Manstein, who complained that Blomberg had ruined the careers of 70 men for something that was not their fault, there were no objections. Again, on his own initiative as part of &quot;self-Gleichschaltung&quot;, Blomberg had the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; in May 1934 adopt Nazi symbols into their uniforms. In 1935, Blomberg worked hard to ensure that the Wehrmacht complied with the Nuremberg Laws by preventing any so-called &quot;Mischling&quot; from serving.

Blomberg had a reputation as something of a lackey to Hitler. As such, he was nicknamed &quot;Rubber Lion&quot; by some of his critics in the army who were less than enthusiastic about Hitler. One of the few notable exceptions was during the run-up to the Night of the Long Knives from 30 June to 2 July 1934. In early June, Hindenburg decided that unless Hitler did something to end the growing political tension in Germany, he would declare martial law and turn over control of the government to the army. Blomberg, who had been known to oppose the growing power of the SA, was chosen to inform Hitler of that decision on the president&#x27;s behalf. When Hitler arrived at Hindenburg&#x27;s estate at Neudeck on 21 June 1934, he was greeted by Blomberg on the steps leading into the estate. Wheeler-Bennett wrote that Hitler was faced with &quot;a von Blomberg no longer the affable &#x27;Rubber Lion&#x27; or the adoring &#x27;Hitler-Junge Quex&#x27;, but embodying all the stern ruthlessness of the Prussian military caste&quot;.

Blomberg bluntly informed Hitler that Hindenburg was highly displeased with the recent developments and was seriously considering dismissing Hitler as chancellor if he did not rein in the SA at once. When Hitler met Hindenburg, the latter insisted for Blomberg to attend the meeting as a sign of his confidence in the Defense Minister. The meeting lasted half-an-hour, and Hindenburg repeated the threat to dismiss Hitler.

Blomberg was aware of least in general of the purge that Hitler began planning after the Neudeck meeting. The conversations between Blomberg and Hitler in late June 1934 were generally not recorded, which makes it difficult to determine how much Blomberg knew, but he was definitely aware of what Hitler had decided to do. On 25 June 1934, the military was placed in a state of alert, and on 28 June, Röhm was expelled from the League of German Officers. The decision to expel Röhm was part of Blomberg&#x27;s effort to maintain the &quot;honor&quot; of the German military. Röhm being executed as a traitor from the League would besmirch the honor of the reputation of the League in general. The same thinking later led to those officers involved in the &quot;putsch&quot; attempt of 20 July 1944 to be dishonorably discharged before they were tried for treason as a way of upholding military &quot;honor.&quot;

Wheeler-Bennett wrote that the fact that Blomberg instigated the expulsion of Röhm from the League just two days before Röhm was arrested on charges of high treason proved he knew what was coming. Röhm had been quite open about his homosexuality ever since he had been outed in 1925 after the publication in a newspaper of his love letters to a former boyfriend. Wheeler-Bennett found highly implausible Blomberg&#x27;s claim that a homosexual would not be allowed to be a member of the League of German Officers. On 29 June 1934, an article by Blomberg appeared in the official newspaper of the Nazi Party, the &quot;Völkischer Beobachter&quot;, stating that the military was behind Hitler and would support him whatever he did.

In the same year, after Hindenburg&#x27;s death on 2 August, as part of his &quot;self-Gleichschaltung&quot; strategy, Blomberg personally ordered all soldiers in the army and all sailors in the Navy to pledge the &quot;oath of allegiance to Adolf Hitler&quot; not to &quot;People and Fatherland&quot; but to the new &quot;Führer&quot;, which is thought to have limited later opposition to Hitler. The oath was the initiative of Blomberg and the &quot;Ministeramt&quot; chief General Walther von Reichenau. The entire military took the oath to Hitler, who was most surprised at the offer. Thus, the popular view that Hitler imposed the oath on the military is incorrect.

On the other hand, Hitler had long expected Hindenburg&#x27;s death and had planned on taking power anyhow and so could he have very well convinced Von Blomberg to implement such an oath long before the actual implementation took place.

The intention of Blomberg and Reichenau in having the military swear an oath to Hitler was to create a personal special bond between Hitler and the military, which was intended to tie Hitler more tightly towards the military and away from the Nazi Party. Blomberg later admitted that he had not thought the full implications of the oath at the time. As part of his defense of the military &quot;state within the state&quot;, Blomberg fought against the attempts of the SS to create a military wing.

Heinrich Himmler repeatedly insisted that the SS needed a military wing to crush any attempt at a communist revolution before Blomberg conceded in the idea, which eventually become the Waffen-SS. Blomberg&#x27;s relations with the SS were badly strained in late 1934 to early 1935 when it was discovered that the SS had bugged the offices of the &quot;Abwehr&quot; chief, Admiral Wilhelm Canaris. That led Blomberg to warn Hitler the military would not tolerate being spied upon. In response to Blomberg&#x27;s protests, Hitler gave orders that the SS could not spy upon the military, no member of the military could be arrested by the police, and cases of suspected &quot;political unreliability&quot; in the military were to be investigated solely by the military police.

==Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces and Minister of War==
On 21 May 1935, the Ministry of Defense was renamed the Ministry of War (&quot;Reichskriegsministerium&quot;); Blomberg also was given the title of Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces (&quot;Wehrmacht&quot;), a title no other German officer had ever held. Hitler remained the Supreme Commander of the military in his capacity as Head of State, the Führer of Germany. On 20 April 1936, the loyal Blomberg became the first &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; appointed by Hitler. On 30 January 1937 to mark the fourth anniversary of the Nazi regime, Hitler personally presented the Golden Party Badge to the remaining non-Nazi members of the cabinet, including Blomberg, and enrolled him in the Party (membership number 3,805,226).

In December 1936, a crisis was created within the German decision-making machinery when General Wilhelm Faupel, the chief German officer in Spain, started to demand the dispatch of three German divisions to fight in the Spanish Civil War as the only way for victory. That was strongly opposed by the Foreign Minister Baron Konstantin von Neurath, who wanted to limit the German involvement in Spain.

At a conference held at the Reich Chancellery on 21 December 1936 attended by Hitler, Hermann Göring, Blomberg, Neurath, General Werner von Fritsch, General Walter Warlimont and Faupel, Blomberg argued against Faupel that an all-out German drive for victory in Spain would be too likely to cause a general war before Germany had rearmed properly. He stated that even if otherwise, it would consume money better spent on military modernization. Blomberg prevailed against Faupel.

Unfortunately for Blomberg, his position as the ranking officer of Nazi Germany alienated Hermann Göring, Hitler&#x27;s second-in-command and Commander-in-Chief of the Luftwaffe, Germany&#x27;s air force, and Heinrich Himmler, the head of the SS, the security organization of the Nazi Party, and concurrently the chief of all police forces of Germany, who conspired to oust him from power. Göring, in particular, had ambitions of becoming Commander-in-Chief himself of the entire military.
On 5 November 1937, the conference between the Reich&#x27;s top military–foreign policy leadership and Hitler recorded in the so-called Hossbach Memorandum occurred. At the conference, Hitler stated that it was the time for war or, more accurately wars, as what Hitler envisioned would be a series of localized wars in Central and Eastern Europe in the near future. Hitler argued that because the wars were necessary to provide Germany with &quot;Lebensraum&quot;, autarky and the arms race with France and the United Kingdom made it imperative to act before the Western powers developed an insurmountable lead in the arms race.

Of those invited to the conference, objections arose from Foreign Minister Konstantin von Neurath, Blomberg and the Army Commander-in-Chief, General Werner von Fritsch, that any German aggression in Eastern Europe was bound to trigger a war against France because of the French alliance system in Eastern Europe, the so-called &quot;cordon sanitaire&quot;, and if a Franco–German war broke out, Britain was almost certain to intervene rather than risk the prospect of France&#x27;s defeat. Moreover, it was objected that Hitler&#x27;s assumption was flawed that Britain and France would just ignore the projected wars because they had started their rearmament later than Germany had.

Accordingly, Fritsch, Blomberg and Neurath advised Hitler to wait until Germany had more time to rearm before pursuing a high-risk strategy of localized wars that was likely to trigger a general war before Germany was ready. None of those present at the conference had any moral objections to Hitler&#x27;s strategy with which they basically agreed; only the question of timing divided them.

==Scandal and downfall==

Göring and Himmler found an opportunity to strike against Blomberg in January 1938, when the 59-year-old general married his second wife, Erna Gruhn (1913–1978, sometimes referred to as &quot;Eva&quot; or &quot;Margarete&quot;). Blomberg had been a widower since the death of his first wife, Charlotte, in 1932. Gruhn was a 24-year-old typist and secretary, but the Berlin police had a long criminal file on her and her mother, a former prostitute. Among the reports was information that Erna Gruhn had posed for pornographic photos in 1932.

That was reported to the Berlin police chief, Wolf-Heinrich von Helldorf, who went to Wilhelm Keitel with the file on the new Mrs. Blomberg. Helldorff said he was uncertain about what to do. Keitel told Helldorf to take the file to Göring, which he did.

Göring, who had served as best man to Blomberg at the wedding, used the file to argue Blomberg was unfit to serve as a war minister. Göring then informed Hitler, who had been present at the wedding. Hitler ordered Blomberg to annul the marriage to avoid a scandal and to preserve the integrity of the army. The upcoming wedding of one of Blomberg&#x27;s daughters, Dorothea, would have been threatened by scandal. She was engaged to Karl-Heinz Keitel, the eldest son of Wilhelm Keitel. Blomberg refused to end his marriage but when Göring threatened to make public the pasts of Erna Gruhn and her mother, Blomberg was forced to resign his posts to prevent that, which he did on 27 January 1938. His daughter was married in May the same year.

Keitel, who would be promoted to the rank of field marshal in 1940, and Blomberg&#x27;s former right-hand man would be appointed by Hitler as the Chief of the OKW of the Armed Forces.

A few days later, Göring and Himmler accused Werner von Fritsch, the Commander-in-Chief of the Army, of being a homosexual. Hitler used these opportunities for a major reorganization of the Wehrmacht. Fritsch was later acquitted; together, the events became known as the Blomberg–Fritsch Affair.

&quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; von Blomberg and his wife went on a honeymoon for a year to the island of Capri. Admiral Erich Raeder decided that Blomberg needed to commit suicide to atone for his marriage, and dispatched an officer to Italy, who followed the Blombergs around on their honeymoon and persistently and unsuccessfully tried to force Blomberg to commit suicide. The officer at one point even tried to force a gun into Blomberg&#x27;s hands, but he declined to end his life. Spending World War II in obscurity, Blomberg was arrested by the Allies in 1945 and later gave evidence at the Nuremberg trials.

==Imprisonment and death==

Blomberg&#x27;s health declined rapidly while he was in detention at Nuremberg. He faced the contempt of his former colleagues and the intention of his young wife to abandon him. It is possible that he manifested symptoms of cancer as early as 1939. On 12 October 1945, he noted in his diary that he weighed slightly over . He was diagnosed with colorectal cancer on 20 February 1946. Resigned to his fate and gripped by depression, he spent the final weeks of his life refusing to eat.

Blomberg died on 13 March 1946. His body was buried without ceremony in an unmarked grave. His remains were later cremated and interred in his residence in Bad Wiessee.

<text>Earl Russell Browder (May 20, 1891 – June 27, 1973) was an American politician, spy for the Soviet Union, communist activist and leader of the Communist Party USA (CPUSA). Browder was the General Secretary of the CPUSA during the 1930s and first half of the 1940s. During World War I, Browder served time in federal prison as a conscientious objector to conscription and the war. Upon his release, Browder became an active member of the American Communist movement, soon working as an organizer on behalf of the Communist International and its Red International of Labor Unions in China and the Pacific region.

In 1930, following the removal of a rival political faction from leadership, Browder was made General Secretary of the CPUSA. For the next 15 years thereafter Browder was the most recognizable public figure associated with American communism, authoring dozens of pamphlets and books, making numerous public speeches before sometimes vast audiences, and twice running for President of the United States. Browder also took part in activities on behalf of Soviet intelligence in America during his period of party leadership, placing those who sought to convey sensitive information to the party into contact with Soviet intelligence. In the wake of public outrage over the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, Browder was indicted for passport fraud. He was convicted of two counts early in 1940 and sentenced to four years in prison, remaining free for a time on appeal. In the spring of 1942, the US Supreme Court affirmed the sentence and Browder began what proved to be a 14-month stint in federal prison. Browder was subsequently released by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in May 1942 as a gesture to &quot;promote national unity.&quot;

Browder was a staunch adherent of close cooperation between the United States and the Soviet Union during World War II and envisioned continued cooperation between these two military powers in the postwar years. Coming to see the role of American Communists to be that of an organized pressure group within a broad governing coalition, he directed the transformation of the CPUSA into a &quot;Communist Political Association&quot; in 1944; however, following the death of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, a Cold War and internal red scare quickly sprouted up. Browder was expelled from the re-established Communist Party early in 1946, largely due to a refusal to modify these views to accord with changing political realities and their associated ideological demands. Browder lived out the rest of his life in relative obscurity at his home in Yonkers, New York, and later in Princeton, New Jersey, where he died in 1973. He wrote numerous books and pamphlets on political issues.

==Background==
Earl Browder was born on May 20, 1891, in Wichita, Kansas, the eighth child of Martha Jane (Hankins) and William Browder, a teacher and farmer. His father was sympathetic to populism.

==Career==
===Socialist===
In 1907, Browder, age 16, joined the Socialist Party of America in Wichita and remained in that organization until the party split of 1912, when many of the group&#x27;s members who supported the syndicalist ideal exited the party after it added an anti-sabotage clause to the party constitution and the recall of National Executive Committeeman William &quot;Big Bill&quot; Haywood. Historian Theodore Draper notes that Browder &quot;was influenced by an offshoot of the syndicalist movement which believed in working in the American Federation of Labor (AFL).&quot; This ideological orientation brought the young Browder into contact with William Z. Foster, founder of an organization called the Syndicalist League of North America which was based upon similar policies and James P. Cannon, an IWW adherent from Kansas.

Browder moved to Kansas City and was employed as an office worker, entering the union of his trade, the Bookkeepers, Stenographers and Accountants union AFL. In 1916, he took a job as manager of the Johnson County Cooperative Association in Olathe, Kansas. Browder was aggressively opposed to World War I and publicly spoke out against it, characterizing the fighting as an imperialist conflict. After the United States joined the war in 1917, Browder was arrested and charged under the Espionage Act conspiring to defeat the operation of the draft law and nonregistration. Browder was sentenced to two years in prison for conspiracy and a year for nonregistration, sitting in jail from December 1917 to November 1918.

===Communist===
In 1919, Browder, Cannon and their Kansas City associates started a radical newspaper, &quot;The Workers World&quot;, with Browder serving as the first editor. However, in June of that year Browder was jailed again on a conspiracy charge, with Cannon taking over as editor. Browder&#x27;s second prison stint, served at Leavenworth Penitentiary, lasted until November 1920, putting him out of circulation during the critical interval when the Left Wing Section of the Socialist Party quit the SPA to form the Communist Party of America and the Communist Labor Party of America. A series of splits and mergers followed, with the two Communist parties formally merging in 1921. Released from prison at last, Browder lost no time in joining the United Communist Party (UCP), as well as the fledgling Trade Union Educational League (TUEL) being launched by his old associate William Z. Foster. Browder found employment as the managing editor of the monthly magazine of TUEL, &quot;The Labor Herald&quot;.

In 1920, the Communist International (Comintern) headed by Grigory Zinoviev decided to establish an international confederation of Communist trade unions, the Red International of Labor Unions (RILU, or &quot;Profintern&quot;). A founding convention was planned to be held in Moscow in July 1921 and an American delegation was gathered, including members of the American Communist Parties and the Industrial Workers of the World. Earl Browder was named to this delegation, ostensibly representing Kansas miners, with the non-party man Foster attending as a journalist representing the Federated Press. This trip to Soviet Russia incidentally proved decisive in bringing the syndicalist Foster over to the Communist movement.

Throughout the early 1920s, Browder and Foster worked together closely in the TUEL, trying to win over the support of the Chicago Federation of Labor in the establishment of a new mass Farmer-Labor Party that would be able to challenge the electoral hegemony of the Republican and Democratic parties. In 1928, the estranged Browder and his girlfriend Kitty Harris went to China and lived in Shanghai where Browder served as Secretary of the RILU&#x27;s Pan-Pacific Trade Union Secretariat, a clandestine labor organization working to unify the labor movement of Asia and the nations of the Pacific basin. The pair returned to the United States in January 1929.

===Lovestone===
The year 1929 marked a major turn in the Communist Party of the United States of America (CPUSA). Party leader Jay Lovestone, having won a massive factional victory over the Chicago-based rival group headed by William Z. Foster at the 6th National Convention of the organization, ran afoul of the Executive Committee of the Communist International (ECCI) and the ultra-radical program which the member organizations of the Comintern were instructed to pursue. Lovestone headed a 10-member delegation to Moscow to appeal his case to the American Commission of ECCI; things did not go well for him and in the squabble over autonomy Lovestone attempted a factional coup involving the seizure of party assets.

On May 17, 1929, ECCI ordered the removal of Lovestone. He was replaced on a provisional basis by a five-person secretariat which included former Lovestone associate Max Bedacht as &quot;Acting Secretary&quot; as well as opposition factional leader and trade union chief Bill Foster; two relatively independent figures in the persons of cartoonist-turned-functionary Robert Minor and former Executive Secretary of the underground party Will Weinstone; and Comintern Representative Boris Mikhailov (pseudonym &quot;G. Williams&quot;) as the unpublicized power behind the throne.

While the center of gravity in the leadership of the CPUSA was rapidly shifted, Browder remained largely outside of the ongoing machinations of power, continuing to function as an employee of the Comintern. In August 1929 Browder was dispatched to Vladivostok, located in the far eastern reaches of Soviet Siberia on the Pacific coastline, to attend the final formal gathering of RILU&#x27;s Pan Pacific Trade Union Secretariat.

Browder returned to the United States again in October 1929, just in time for a critical plenary session of the Central Committee of the American party. Allies in the Comintern had already begun to promote the trusted Browder as the best figure to head the American Communist Party, with Solomon Lozovsky taking up his banner in Moscow while Mikhailov-Williams lent his support from America. Foster&#x27;s credibility had been badly tarnished in Moscow as a result of his role as a leader of the frequently unprincipled factional war which had paralyzed the American party throughout the decade of the 1920s. Placing Browder — the man responsible for bringing Foster into the communist movement — in authority was seen as a means for shifting power decisively away from the former Lovestone group without opening a new round of factional warfare which would have inevitably resulted had the mantle been given directly to Foster.

Browder deferred from the position of party Secretary, however, not feeling himself sufficiently acclimated to the political situation in the CPUSA. The October plenum therefore returned Bedacht and Minor to a collective leadership, dropping Foster and Weinstone. Weinstone was named as the new American Representative to the Comintern, replacing the recently expelled righthand man of Jay Lovestone, Bertram D. Wolfe, in the position. Browder was added to this new three member Secretariat, named head of the party&#x27;s Agitation and Propaganda department.

===Rise to leadership===
The 4th quarter of 1929 saw the wheels fall off the wagon, marked by the October 24 Wall Street Crash and the beginning of a massive economic contraction remembered to history as the Great Depression. As head of the CPUSA&#x27;s Agitprop, Browder was responsible for generating party literature intended to transform the unemployment crisis into a mass movement for revolutionary change. Browder was instrumental in planning American activities relating to International Unemployment Day, March 6, 1930 — an international day of mass protest, set in motion by the Comintern, against unemployment. A network of Unemployed Councils were established under Communist Party auspices.

Another change of the top level leadership of the CPUSA took place at the party&#x27;s 7th National Convention of June 21–25, 1930. Max Bedacht, formerly a top figure in the hierarchy of the Lovestone faction who had only recanted his views at the 11th hour in front of the American Commission of ECCI in Moscow was removed as Secretary and moved to a less sensitive leadership role as head of the International Workers Order. A new three person Secretariat was appointed, with Browder as Secretary of the political department while Will Weinstone and Bill Foster heading the organizational and trade union departments, respectively. With Weinstone in Moscow as the CPUSA&#x27;s Comintern Rep and Foster in jail for his connection with the March 6 International Unemployment Day demonstration, which had ended in street fighting in New York City, Browder&#x27;s position as chief decision-maker of the party was at least temporarily bolstered.

Browder&#x27;s status as the de facto first among equals among members of the Secretariat of the American CP was further emphasized at the 11th Plenum of the Comintern, held from March 26 to April 11, 1931. There it was Browder who delivered the main report of the CPUSA, indicative of his prime position in the organization. Tension developed between the trio, with Foster seeing his long-desired place as CPUSA chief foiled by a man who had formerly been his lieutenant at the Trade Union Educational League; both the midwesterners distrusted the ambitious, college-educated New Yorker Weinstone. Browder&#x27;s considerable administrative skills, his ability to intelligently defend his ideas, and his willingness to yield to others when necessary scored points for his personal cause in Moscow.

By the end of 1932 Browder&#x27;s primary leadership role was consolidated. When Weinstone returned from Moscow anxious to once again pursue party leadership positions, protracted squabbling over party policy threatened to erupt into a 1920s-style factional war. In August the Comintern Representative, sensing such a danger, advised Moscow of &quot;some strong person&quot; to stop the &quot;squabbling&quot;. The third member of the Secretariat, William Z. Foster, the party&#x27;s candidate for president, suffered an attack of angina pectoris and was ordered by doctors to cease campaigning and to undergo bed rest — with visitation and dictation similarly proscribed. With Foster out of the picture and a big majority of the party leadership backing him over Weinstone, Browder appealed to the Comintern to resolve what he called &quot;impossible relations&quot; with Weinstone by assigning one of them for Comintern work abroad.

On November 13, 1932, after extensive debate, the Comintern ruled in Browder&#x27;s favor, determining that Weinstone would be removed from America to once again serve in Moscow as the CPUSA&#x27;s official representative there. Moscow&#x27;s vision seems to have been for a joint party leadership between Browder and Foster. The unexpected factor proved to be the chronic and incapacitating nature of Foster&#x27;s heart ailment, which left Browder in a position of effective unitary leadership. Although Weinstone had been removed from America to break up an incipient factional war, he continued to campaign for the position of party leader. In the spring of 1933 he obtained the final test of strength he had been looking for, in the form of a dozen meetings of the Comintern&#x27;s Anglo-American Secretariat in Moscow spread out over 29 days. Throughout April, Browder and Weinstone leveled charges and counter-charges against one another, examining the Communist Party&#x27;s activities in the United States in fine detail. Despite significant criticism of certain of his actions, Browder emerged from the Moscow sessions in a firm position of authority. Weinstone, accepting defeat at last, remained in Moscow as the CPUSA&#x27;s CI Rep until 1934.

===Popular front leader===
While Earl Browder was one of the top leaders of American communism during the so-called Third Period of the early 1930s, he came into his own during the interval which followed, the era of the popular front against fascism. With the rise of Adolf Hitler to Chancellor of Germany at the end of January 1933, the balance of power in Europe was shifted. Formerly home to one of the most powerful communist organizations, the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) was quickly suppressed. The failure of the KPD to cooperate with workers adhering to the rival Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) was seen by many Comintern officials as a major contributing factor to the disaster. New tactics building a broad alliance in opposition to fascism seemed to be indicated.

Browder was an enthusiastic supporter of this new party line. By the middle of 1934 the Browder-led Central Committee of the CPUSA was pushing the leaders of its youth section, the Young Communist League, to establish a working alliance with the youth section of the rival Socialist Party, the Young People&#x27;s Socialist League. In the same vein, Browder himself picked up hints from Socialist Party leader Norman Thomas that joint work between Socialists and Communists might be possible on specific issues, in reply to which Browder issued a letter formally proposing a large scale united front of the two organizations.

Still perceiving President Franklin D. Roosevelt as a fascist dictator in the making, Browder and the Communists began to examine their political isolation from the American working class and to envision the establishment of a new labor party which would include both Communists and Socialists within its ranks. In December 1934 Browder won Comintern approval for his scheme, arguing his case in person in Moscow. Browder returned to the United States at the end of the month, revealing his plan to a surprised party membership in a public speech delivered on January 6, 1935. The Socialist Party, for its part, remained skeptical, having been on the receiving end of more than a decade&#x27;s worth of vilification and violence.

In conjunction with its newly found interest in building bridges with non-communist progressives, the CPUSA launched potent new mass organizations such as the American League Against War and Fascism (September 1933), the American Youth Congress (1935), and the League of American Writers (April 1935). Moreover, as the 1930s progressed and the New Deal policies of the Roosevelt administration became established, the Browder-led Communist Party moved from a position of bitter opposition to critical support.

After 1935 the Communist Party maintained only nominal opposition to the Roosevelt administration, with Browder heading the party&#x27;s 1936 ticket as its candidate for president in the election of 1936. He received 80,195 votes. In practice, progressives of both parties were seen as key constituents in a broad &quot;People&#x27;s Front&quot; against fascism and a bulwark of the movement for collective security in Europe against German aggression. The Communist Party attenuated its message of the historical inevitability of revolution, emphasizing progressive trends in American history and attempting to cast itself as an indigenous reform movement under the slogan &quot;Communism is 20th Century Americanism&quot;. The stark phraseology of Marxism, based upon the inevitability of class struggle, was replaced by a fuzzy critique of capitalism using Rooseveltian terms like &quot;economic royalism&quot;.

Browder was not only the leading party decision-maker but also the public face of this effort. He was, one historian later noted, a man who &quot;paid lip service to &#x27;proletarian internationalism and who &quot;knew better than to oppose Soviet-imposed policies, however inappropriate they might be for American conditions&quot;, but who &quot;wanted to be a leader of a national movement with power and influence of its own.&quot; The &quot;Communism is 20th Century Americanism&quot; campaign, during which Communism was portrayed as an integral part of the American democratic tradition, was successful in building the size and scope of the party organization. But with this growth came a correlated expansion of Browder&#x27;s personal ego. A cult of personality began to be nurtured among the party faithful in miniature reflection of the systemic adulation of Joseph Stalin in the USSR. In the words of Maurice Isserman: &quot;The constant praise of his colleagues and the party press, and the adulation in which the membership held him (among his papers Browder saved a letter from a Seattle Communist addressed to the &#x27;Greatest of Living Americans, Earl Browder&#x27;), transformed the once unassuming &quot;apparatchik&quot; of the 1920s into an arrogant and uncompromising party dictator.&quot;

Browder&#x27;s chief rival in the Communist Party leadership in this interval was William Z. Foster. When a new recession struck in 1937, stifling tax revenue, President Roosevelt and Congress responded by cutting funding for its signature Works Progress Administration by 50 percent in an attempt to help bring the budget into balance. Foster sought for the CPUSA to renew a militant stance against capitalism and the government in response to the economic downturn. Browder, on the other hand, pushed the party towards moderate criticism of the administration, urging increased expenditures on public works and unemployment relief and lauding Roosevelt&#x27;s move away from isolationism in foreign policy in the wake of the rising tide of fascism in Europe. A short-lived revival of the Farmer-Labor Party idea was scrapped under Browder&#x27;s direction, and the New Deal coalition endorsed as the practical base upon which a People&#x27;s Front could be constructed. Over question of Foster&#x27;s militance versus Browder&#x27;s accommodation with New Deal realities, the Comintern ruled decisively in favor of Browder.

Browder made his final trip to the USSR in October 1938, where he made arrangements with Comintern chief Georgi Dimitrov to establish shortwave radio communications in the event that international conflict made direct communication impossible. No communications of this sort were made until late in September 1939, when the CPUSA&#x27;s political line on the dramatically changed European situation would be specified.

===Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact===
European geopolitics were fundamentally altered on August 23, 1939, when the Foreign Ministers of the USSR and Nazi Germany formally signed a mutual non-aggression treaty known to history as the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact. The agreement included secret protocols providing for the Nazi invasion and division of Poland. Germany&#x27;s September 1 invasion of Poland brought an immediate response from its treaty partners France and United Kingdom, who declared war on Germany on September 3. World War II had begun.

The Soviet Union invaded Eastern Poland on September 17, occupying land that otherwise would have been taken over by Germany. The Soviet government went further, however, by signing a joint statement with the Germans characterizing the partition of Poland as a &quot;&quot;, calling for an end to hostilities, and placing the onus for any escalation of the European conflict on the governments of Great Britain and France.

Virtually overnight the political lines of the communist parties of the world shifted. Those who were formerly the greatest cheerleaders for collective security against the danger of Germany now became staunch opponents of American intervention in the European military situation—reflective of the newly revised needs of Soviet foreign policy. All anti-fascist propaganda was immediately terminated, overt criticism of German action was minimized, the culpability of the governments of France and Britain was exaggerated. Browder&#x27;s CPUSA claimed that Hitler&#x27;s foes intended to escalate the ongoing European conflict into a counterrevolutionary offensive against the USSR.

The result of the sudden shift of the party line caused shock and confusion among many members of the Communist Party USA, a good number of whom had joined during the period of the Popular Front against fascism. Browder declared at one Philadelphia rally that only &quot;a dozen or so&quot; had left the CPUSA over the change of line; but this was simply untrue. On the contrary, the party&#x27;s ranks fell by 15% between 1939 and 1940, and recruitment of new members in 1940 fell by 75% from 1938 levels. The public image of the USSR as a main bulwark against fascism and claims of the CPUSA as an indigenous radical organization were severely undermined.

Moreover, the CPUSA&#x27;s new propaganda offensive against United States participation in the so-called &quot;Imperialist War&quot; brought it into political conflict with the Roosevelt administration, which had begun to question the wisdom of isolationism. In the summer of 1939, Texas Congressman Martin Dies, Jr. (D), chairman of the House Special Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC), learned that the U.S. Department of Justice had begun to investigate old charges that Earl Browder had traveled abroad under assumed names, making use of false documents, during the 1920s. Dies proceeded to subpoena Browder to appear before the committee to give testimony on the matter. On September 5, 1939, days after the German invasion of Poland, Browder appeared before HUAC, providing exhaustive testimony over the course of two days.

Midway through the first day of testimony, Browder was asked in passing whether he had ever traveled abroad under a false passport. Before party attorney Joseph Brodsky could stop him, Browder answered, &quot;I have.&quot; Although he subsequently refused to answer follow-up questions about the matter, citing the protection against self-incrimination offered by the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, the damage caused by Browder&#x27;s admission under oath had been done. Conservative politicians such as Congressman J. Parnell Thomas (R) of New Jersey attempted to make political capital out of Browder&#x27;s admission, by intimating that the Roosevelt administration had coddled the country&#x27;s leading Communist. Parnell Thomas maintained that Browder was &quot;swaggering [and] apparently untouchable&quot; despite being Stalin&#x27;s &quot;number one stooge in this country.&quot;

With popular feeling against Communism raging in the wake of European events and political heat rising in Washington, the Justice Department moved to action. On October 23 a federal grand jury in Manhattan indicted Browder for passport fraud, a felony. The formal charge against him specified that Browder had made multiple returns to the United States using a passport bearing his own name, but which had been obtained on the basis of a falsely sworn statement. Indictments of CPUSA treasurer William Wiener and Young Communist League leader Harry Gannes on passport charges followed in December, and the Communist Party sent several of its top leaders into hiding in anticipation of a broader crackdown.

On January 17, 1940, Browder&#x27;s trial for passport fraud began at federal court in New York City. Browder faced a two-count indictment, upon which conviction would have carried a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison and a $4,000 fine. Owing to expiration of the statute of limitations on earlier passport offenses, the government was able to prosecute Browder solely for his passport use during the years 1937 and 1938. To aid dramatic effect, recently convicted Soviet spy Nicholas Dozenberg was placed on the stand to identify Browder&#x27;s photograph on papers obtained in Dozenberg&#x27;s name. After the court refused a long series of motions by Browder&#x27;s attorney, G. Gordon Battle, Browder took control of his own defense in the courtroom. He reminded jurors that the trial did not concern false documents from the distant past and proclaimed that the actual charges against him were based upon a &quot;web of technicalities&quot;.

Jury deliberations in the Browder case lasted less than an hour, with a guilty verdict returned. Browder was sentenced to 4 years in prison and a $2,000 fine — a result less than the maximum but in excess of sentences given to others in similar circumstances. The conviction was unanimously affirmed on appeal on June 24, 1940, and the United States Supreme Court concurred on February 17, 1941. On March 25, 1941, Browder surrendered to US Marshals, who transported him by rail to the Atlanta Federal Penitentiary. Two days later, with his face masked behind a pillowcase to hinder photographers, Browder was led into the penitentiary to begin serving his four-year term. He would not emerge again for 14 months.

===World War II===
While Browder was imprisoned, the war continued, with major events in Europe and the Pacific. On June 22, 1941, some 3.9 million Axis troops, led by Nazi Germany, launched Operation Barbarossa, a massive and bloody invasion of the Soviet Union. Immediately the political line of the entire world communist movement shifted from one of anti-intervention in the so-called &quot;imperialist war&quot; to one of intense advocacy for anti-fascist intervention; the slogan was &quot;Defend the Soviet Union&quot;. On July 12 the governments of Great Britain and the USSR exchanged pledges of mutual aid, setting the stage for military cooperation between the capitalist nations of the West and their historic Bolshevik foe.

On December 7, 1941, the air force of Imperial Japan launched a sudden and devastating attack upon the American naval base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. A German declaration of war on the United States followed, and direct American participation in the Second World War was begun. The interests of the American government, the Soviet government, and the American Communist Party became aligned. In the Atlanta prison, treatment of Browder was relaxed, and he began to be allowed regular visits from acting CPUSA leader Robert Minor. The Communist Party had previously conducted a &quot;Free Earl Browder&quot; campaign on behalf of its jailed leader but with little success, owing to bitter public sentiment over the USSR&#x27;s pact with Nazi Germany and the CPUSA&#x27;s kowtowing to Moscow&#x27;s policy shift. By early 1942, however the party&#x27;s pleas on behalf of Browder began to gain traction among government officials.

On May 16, 1942, just prior to a visit to the United States by Vyacheslav Molotov, Foreign Minister of the USSR, President Roosevelt decided to remove a minor impediment to the closest possible wartime relations between the two powers by commuting Browder&#x27;s sentence to time served. In a statement to the press, the Roosevelt administration said that Browder&#x27;s early release would &quot;have a tendency to promote national unity and allay any feeling...that the unusually long sentence in Browder&#x27;s case was by way of penalty upon him because of his political views.&quot;

Browder discreetly returned to New York City, where he resumed his place as General Secretary of the Communist Party, USA. Throughout the early years of the war, the CPUSA agitated for the establishment of a second military front in Europe to alleviate pressure exerted by Axis forces upon the Soviets in the east. The Communists proved to be enthusiastic supporters of the war effort, and the party press worked to mobilize public sentiment by printing accounts of Nazi atrocities in Germany and abroad. Browder directed Communist Party members to concentrate upon &quot;problems of a centralized war economy and production for the war&quot;, using their place in the labor movement to help ameliorate labor discord.

Browder did not personally devise the wartime policies of the CPUSA; the main elements of party policy, such as advocacy of an immediate second front, opposition to strikes, an end to racial discrimination in job hiring, and total support of Roosevelt&#x27;s internal policy initiatives, were already well established by the time of his release in May 1942. Nevertheless, Browder became the public spokesman for these policies, and published a book in the fall of 1942, called &quot;Victory and After&quot;, which was frank in promoting class collaboration as essential to the cause of victory.

Browder postulated that the cooperation between America and the Soviet Union would continue into the postwar period. A victory of the &quot;United Nations&quot; would &quot;make possible the solution of reconstruction problems with a minimum of social disorder and civil violence in the various countries most concerned.&quot; This belief in longterm cooperation between the Allied powers abroad and civil peace at home were the hallmarks of what was later known as &quot;Browderism&quot;.

By the end of 1943 the tide of the war in Europe had shifted, and there was no doubt either about the survival of the USSR or the ultimate outcome of the Second World War. With the Red Army moving inexorably westward, the possibility of a Communist Europe seemed within reach to the party faithful. Cooperation between the United States, Great Britain, and the Soviet Union was at its zenith following the conclusion of the Tehran Conference, held November 28 to December 1, 1943.

On January 7, 1944, the 28 members of the governing National Committee of the CPUSA were called into session in New York City. Although they usually conducted their business in closed executive session, the members of the National Committee were surprised to learn that their session was to be held in a large room in front of about 200 invited guests. In his keynote report to the gathering, General Secretary Browder revisited the close cooperation indicated at the Tehran Conference and declared that &quot;Capitalism and Socialism have begun to find their way to peaceful coexistence and collaboration in the same world.&quot;

The Communist Party was advancing its policy initiatives through political cooperation with New Deal supporters, Browder indicated, and he declared that &quot;Communist organization in the United States should adjust its name to correspond more exactly to the American political tradition and its own practical political role.&quot; Consequently, the name of the Communist Party USA would be changed to the &quot;Communist Political Association&quot;, Browder noted — advising those gathered of a decision which had already been made by the Political Bureau of the party. The speakers following Browder lent individual support to the predetermined change of party name and shift in conception of the organization&#x27;s role in the American political firmament.

The National Committee voted unanimously in support of Browder&#x27;s proposals. They established committees to draft a new constitution for the organization and to prepare for a May 1944 convention to ratify the changes. Factional opposition to Browder&#x27;s change took the form of a letter to the party leadership by Browder&#x27;s nemesis William Z. Foster and Foster&#x27;s friend, Philadelphia District Organizer Sam Darcy, signed only by the former. The pair disagreed with Browder&#x27;s view that the bourgeoisie would continue its wartime coordination with the Roosevelt administration after the war, and predicted a breakdown that would require an aggressive response by American Communists.

Browder allowed the Foster-Darcy letter to be circulated only to a handful of top party leaders, who at a February 1944 meeting of the Politburo voted to reject the letter. Foster&#x27;s objection was muted when Browder emphasized that open criticism would have been regarded as a punishable breach of party discipline. Darcy refused to submit to party discipline on this matter, however, viewing it as a matter of fundamental principle. He was subsequently expelled from the CPA by a committee headed by Foster himself.

===Expulsion===
With the end of the great power alliance at the end of World War II and the beginning of the Cold War, so-called &quot;Browderism&quot; was attacked by the rest of the international Communist movement. They particularly criticized the restructuring of the American party in 1944. In April 1945 the French Communist Party&#x27;s theoretical magazine, &quot;Les Cahiers du communisme&quot;, published an article by French party leader Jacques Duclos that declared that Browder&#x27;s beliefs about a harmonious post-war world were &quot;erroneous conclusions in no wise flowing from a Marxist analysis of the situation.&quot; Duclos held that Browder&#x27;s &quot;liquidation of the independent political party of the working class&quot; constituted a &quot;notorious revision of Marxism&quot;.

American communists realized that the Duclos letter was initiated by Moscow, which had been largely out of contact since it had liquidated the Comintern in 1943 as its own gesture to wartime harmony. Duclos otherwise had no reason to criticize the activity of a fraternal party, American Communists maintained. Moreover, Duclos quoted directly from the Foster-Darcy letter — a document known to only a handful of top American party leaders, with a copy dispatched to Moscow.

An interview with Gil Green by Anders Stephanson was published in the 1993 anthology &quot;New Studies in the Politics and Culture of U.S. Communism&quot;, edited by Michael F. Brown, Randy Martin, Frank Rosengarten, and George Snedeker. This exchange was included:AS: But in 1945 Browder went out as a result of Duclos&#x27; attack on his coalition line. 

GG: I was terribly shocked by the article. But in my naiveté and innocence, I was shocked because I was supposed to have been involved in what was a betrayal of Marxism. This was undoubtedly coming from Moscow, and had greater significance than an article by some leader of the French party who suddenly attacks the line of the American party without even letting us know his views beforehand. According to the Italians, later on, there is evidence that it was not aimed so much at Browder and the party here as at the Italian and French parties. The fear was that, with their underground fighting against the Nazis, they would emerge with tremendous prestige and be able to take an independent course. And while the blow was struck against us here, it wasn&#x27;t necessarily concerned with us alone.After the collapse of the Soviet Union, historians Harvey Klehr, John Earl Haynes and Kyrill Anderson discovered a letter in the Soviet archives showing that the &quot;Duclos Letter&quot; had actually been written in Russian and published in Moscow in early 1945, while the war with Germany was still in progress. The timing of the original showed that the USSR had already decided post-war relations with the US would not be friendly. The Russian-language original was translated into French and given to Duclos after the Japanese surrender, with instructions for him to publish it under his own name.

The American communists quickly reversed Browder&#x27;s political line, stripping him of executive power in June 1945 and reconstituting itself as the Communist Party of the United States of America at a snap convention held in July. Predictably, Bill Foster, elevated in stature by being quoted in the &quot;Duclos letter&quot;, led the opposition to Browder and &quot;Browderism&quot;. He was named to replace &quot;the man from Kansas&quot; as party chairman in 1945. Eugene Dennis, an individual held in high esteem by Moscow, was named Browder&#x27;s successor to the more important position of General Secretary.

In January 1946, Browder began publishing a mimeographed weekly newsletter of economic analysis called &quot;Distributors Guide: Economic Analysis: A Service for Policy Makers&quot;. The subscription price was hefty—$100 per year; he wanted to gain a readership among business executives and political decision-makers. Browder produced a total of 16 issues, each based on his vision of Soviet-American cooperation, as opposed to the unfolding Cold War between the powers. The Communist Party regarded his independent publication as further evidence of a serious breach of party discipline. On February 5, 1946, Earl Browder was expelled from the CPUSA.

===Literary agent===
Browder applied for a visa to travel to Moscow to appeal his expulsion, but he was forced to wait two months for its approval. In the meantime he continued to issue his &quot;Distributors Guide&quot;, which became explicitly more pro-Stalin and pro-Soviet in later issues. With his visa finally approved, Browder ended publication of his newsletter at the end of April 1946. The former American party leader departed for the Soviet Union to determine whether his expulsion could be overturned. Browder arrived in Moscow on May 3 and met with old friends, including Solomon Lozovsky, former head of the Profintern, as well as Stalin&#x27;s right-hand man, Viacheslav Molotov.

Molotov was unable to intercede on Browder&#x27;s behalf to reintegrate him into an American Communist Party. By then its leaders regarded him as an undisciplined opportunist and unreliable leader. However, his past service was rewarded with an appointment as &quot;American Representative of the State Publishing House&quot; for publication of Soviet books in the United States. Upon his return, Browder registered with the United States Department of Justice as a foreign agent, as required by law. He acted as a sort of literary agent for the Soviet government, receiving English translations of various books and articles and attempting to gain placement for them with American publishers. While generally unsuccessful at gaining such publication, Browder met monthly with the second secretary of the Soviet Embassy in Washington, D.C. He provided him with written memoranda on the situation in the United States in general and the Communist Party of the United States of America, in particular — effectively providing analysis on behalf of Soviet intelligence.

In April 1950, Browder was called to testify before a Senate Committee investigating communist activity. Questioned by Joseph McCarthy (R-Wis), Browder openly criticized the American Communist Party but refused to answer questions that would incriminate former comrades. He also claimed under oath that he had never been involved in espionage activities. Browder was charged with contempt of Congress but Judge F. Dickinson Letts ordered his acquittal, ruling that the committee had not acted legally. Browder was never prosecuted for his perjury before the committee nor for his spying on behalf of the Soviet Union.

In March 1950, Browder shared a platform with Max Shachtman, the dissident Trotskyist, in which the pair debated socialism. Browder defended the Soviet Union while Shachtman acted as a prosecutor. Reportedly at one point in the debate, Shachtman listed a series of leaders of various Communist parties and noted that each had died at the hands of Stalin. At the end of this speech, he noted that Browder, too, had been a leader of a Communist Party and, pointing at him, said: &quot;There-there but for an accident of geography, stands a corpse!&quot;

Following the Twentieth Party Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1956, a period in which some within the American Communist Party briefly sought to exert its independence from Moscow, another effort was made to reintegrate Browder into the CPUSA. This effort at liberalization was soon defeated, however. Although remaining committed to the cause of socialism, Browder never belonged to the Communist Party again.

==Espionage==
On June 2, 1957, Browder appeared on the television program &quot;The Mike Wallace Interview&quot;, where he was grilled for 30 minutes about his past in the Communist Party. Host Mike Wallace quoted Browder as having recently said, &quot;Getting thrown out of the Communist Party was the best thing that ever happened to me.&quot; When asked to elaborate, Browder replied: &quot;That&#x27;s right. I meant that the Communist Party and the whole communist movement was changing its character, and in 1945, when I was kicked out, the parting of the ways had come, and if I hadn&#x27;t been kicked out I would have had the difficult task of disengaging myself from a movement that I could no longer agree with and no longer help.&quot;

&quot;I was involved in no conspiracies&quot;, Browder adamantly declared to Wallace and his television audience. Browder repeatedly connected Jacob Golos, a longtime Communist Party activist and Soviet agent, with CPUSA members who had offered to share sensitive information that they thought the party should know. While initially most of these would-be informants were employees of private industry, party members who were employees of the federal government were later also brought into Golos&#x27; circle of contacts. Browder was also periodically given access to important information by Golos before its transmission to his superiors in Moscow.

Browder&#x27;s public protestations against accusations of spying were contradicted by the 1995 release of the Venona documents. This secretly decoded material confirmed that Browder was engaged in recruiting potential espionage agents for Soviet intelligence during the 1940s. In 1938, Rudy Baker (Venona code name: SON) had been appointed to head the CPUSA underground apparatus to replace J. Peters, after the defection of Whittaker Chambers, allegedly at the request of Browder (Venona code name: FATHER). According to self-confessed NKVD recruiter Louis Budenz, he and Browder participated in discussions with Soviet intelligence officials to plan the assassination of Leon Trotsky.

While in federal custody in the US, Browder never revealed his status as an agent recruiter. He was never prosecuted for espionage. Venona decrypt #588 April 29, 1944, from the KGB New York office states, &quot;for more than a year Zubilin (station chief) and I tried to get in touch with Victor Perlo and Charles Flato. For some reason Browder did not come to the meeting and just decided to put Bentley in touch with the whole group. All occupy responsible positions in Washington, D.C.&quot; Soviet intelligence thought highly of Browder&#x27;s recruitment work: in a 1946 OGPU memorandum, Browder was personally credited with hiring eighteen intelligence agents for the Soviet Union.

Members of Browder&#x27;s family were also involved in work for Soviet intelligence. According to a 1938 letter from Browder to Georgi Dimitrov, then General Secretary of the Comintern, Browder&#x27;s younger sister Marguerite was an agent working in various European countries for the NKVD. (The letter was found in the Comintern archives after the fall of the Soviet Union.) Browder expressed concern over the effect on the American public if his sister&#x27;s secret work for Soviet intelligence were to be exposed: &quot;In view of my increasing involvement in national political affairs and growing connections in Washington political circles ... it might become dangerous to this political work if hostile circles in America should obtain knowledge of my sister&#x27;s work.&quot; He requested she be released from her European duties and returned to America to serve &quot;in other fields of activity&quot;. Dimitrov forwarded Browder&#x27;s request to Nikolai Yezhov, then head of the NKVD, requesting Marguerite Browder&#x27;s transfer. Browder&#x27;s half-niece, Helen Lowry (&quot;aka&quot; Elza Akhmerova, also Elsa Akhmerova), worked with Iskhak Akhmerov, a Soviet NKVD espionage controller, from 1936 to 1939 under the code name &quot;ADA&quot;(?) ADA was Kitty Harris (later changed to &quot;ELZA&quot;)). In 1939, Helen Lowry married Akhmerov. Lowry was named by Soviet intelligence agent Elizabeth Bentley as one of her contacts. Lowry, Akhmerov and their actions on behalf of Soviet intelligence are referred to in several Venona project decryptions as well as Soviet KGB archives.

==Personal life and death==
Browder married Raisa Berkman. He died in Princeton, New Jersey on June 27, 1973. His three sons, Felix, William, and Andrew, all distinguished research mathematicians, have been leaders in the American mathematical community.

Grandchild Bill Browder (son of Felix) was co-founder and head of the investment group Hermitage Capital Management, which operated for more than 10 years in Moscow during a wave of privatization after the fall of the Soviet Union. Browder became a British citizen in 1998. Great-grandchild Joshua Browder is a British-American entrepreneur, consumer rights activist, and public figure.

<text>Onomacritus (; c. 530 – c. 480 BC), also spelled Onomacritos and Onomakritos, was a Greek , or compiler of oracles, who lived at the court of the tyrant Pisistratus in Athens and prepared an edition of the Homeric poems. He was a collector and forger of oracles and poems.

==Herodotus==
Herodotus reports that Onomacritus was hired by Pisistratus to compile the oracles of Musaeus, but that Onomacritus inserted forgeries of his own that were detected by Lasus of Hermione. As a result, Onomacritus was banished from Athens by Pisistratus&#x27; son Hipparchus. After the flight of the Pisistratids to Persia, Onomacritus was reconciled with them. According to Herodotus, Onomacritus induced Xerxes I, the King of Persia, by his oracular responses, to decide upon his war with Greece.

==Pausanias and Orphic attributions==
Pausanias attributes to Onomacritus certain poems forged under the name of Musaeus. In explaining the presence of the Titan Anytos at Lycosura, he wrote: &quot;From Homer the name of the Titans was taken by Onomakritos, who in the orgies he composed for Dionysos made the Titans the authors of the god&#x27;s sufferings.&quot; That is, Pausanias attributed to Onomacritus the telling of the myth of Dionysus&#x27;s dismemberment by the Titans.

According to Tatian, the literature attributed to Orpheus was &quot;arranged&quot; by Onomacritus. Onomacritus&#x27;s association with the works of Orpheus can also be found in the writings of Sextus Empiricus and Clement of Alexandria, and in the &quot;Suda&quot;, two works, the Orphic &quot;Chresmoi&quot; and &quot;Teletai&quot;, are said to have been written by him.

Among 17th-century scholars of Orphism who were sceptical of the notion of Orpheus himself having composed the works attributed to him, the idea of Onomacritus having instead been responsible for these writings, fully or in part, was a convenient alternative. The Dutch scholar Daniel Heinsius argued that the poet referred to as &quot;Orpheus&quot; was in fact Onomacritus himself, while the Danish scholar Ole Borch argued that while the &quot;Orphic Argonautica&quot; was &quot;Pisistratean&quot;, other works such as the &quot;Orphic Hymns&quot; and the Orphic &quot;Lithica&quot; were the genuine writings of Orpheus himself. The French philologist , writing in the first half of the 18th century, believed that while the &quot;Orphic Hymns&quot; were composed by Orpheus, Onomacritus converted them into the Ionian dialect.

<text>A standing ovation is a form of applause where members of a seated audience stand up while applauding, often after extraordinary performances of particularly high acclaim. In Ancient Rome returning military commanders (such as Marcus Licinius Crassus after his defeat of Spartacus) whose victories did not quite meet the requirements of a triumph but which were still praiseworthy were celebrated with an ovation instead, from the Latin &quot;ovo&quot;, &quot;I rejoice&quot;. The word&#x27;s use in English to refer to sustained applause dates from at least 1831.

Standing ovations are considered to be a special honor. Often they are used at the entrance or departure of a speaker or performer, where the audience members will continue the ovation until the ovated person leaves or begins their speech. 

Some audience members worldwide have observed that the standing ovation has come to be devalued, such as in the field of politics, in which on some occasions standing ovations may be given to political leaders as a matter of course, rather than as a special honour in unusual circumstances. Examples include party conferences in many countries, where the speech of the party leader is rewarded with a &quot;stage managed&quot; standing ovation as a matter of course, and the State of the Union Address of the President of the United States. It is routine, rather than exceptional, for this address to be introduced, interrupted and followed by standing ovations, from both the president&#x27;s own party and his political opponents. However, by tradition all ovations that occur before the speech begins, as opposed to those that interrupt it, are given in praise of the office itself, rather than the individual office-holder, and the president is never introduced by name.

Standing ovations are also often given in a sporting context to reflect an outstanding individual performance, or to celebrate a beloved sporting hero past or present that has a strong connection with the team&#x27;s fans and home city. This practice is especially notable among sports fans in Montreal, Quebec, Canada throughout the years, where many athletes have received standing ovations lasting several minutes long as a way to show appreciation. Examples include:

In 1996, Montreal Canadiens legend Maurice Richard received a 16-minute long standing ovation from the fans at the Montreal Forum following the conclusion of the Forum&#x27;s final Canadiens home game as he and other Canadiens greats who played at the Forum were presented to the crowd. Richard&#x27;s ovation is said to be the longest in the history of the Forum and of the Canadiens.

In 2002, Montreal Canadiens legend Saku Koivu returned to the Canadiens&#x27; lineup following after suffering from Burkitt&#x27;s lymphoma, a form of cancer. Koivu received an 8–9 minutes standing ovation from the Montreal fans prior to puck drop. It was officially listed as the second longest standing ovation in Canadiens history at the time, until it was surpassed in 2022 by the Canadiens&#x27; pre-game tribute to Guy Lafleur following the announcing of his death.

In 2003, after Montreal Expos star player Vladimir Guerrero Sr. played his last game with the Expos, he saluted the Olympic Stadium crowd alongside his son, then three-year-old Vladimir Guerrero Jr. The two wore matching Expos uniforms and tipped their caps to the Montreal faithful as the crowd cheered.

In 2022, following the announcing of the death of Canadiens great Guy Lafleur, the team held a tribute to him prior to the Canadiens&#x27; game against the Boston Bruins at Bell Centre. The ceremony featured highlights of Lafleur&#x27;s career being played on the JumboTron and many players and coaches paying respects and saying thanks to Lafleur. The fans in attendance then stood to applaud for 10 minutes and 10 seconds to celebrate Lafleur— Lafleur wore the #10 jersey number with the Canadiens—which included cheers, chants of &quot;Guy! Guy! Guy!&quot;, and an &quot;Olé Olé Olé&quot; chant which is commonly heard in Montreal and especially at Canadiens games. The ovation was officially timed as the second longest in Canadiens history, behind Maurice Richard&#x27;s from 1996. As for the game itself later on, the Canadiens fell to the Bruins, 5–3.

<text>Patricia Ann &quot;Patti&quot; Davis (&#x27;Reagan; born October 21, 1952) is an American actress and author. She is the daughter of U.S. president Ronald Reagan and his second wife, Nancy Reagan.

==Early life and education==
Patricia Ann Reagan was born to Ronald and Nancy Reagan on October 21, 1952, at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California. She is the older sister of Ron Reagan, and the younger adoptive sister of Michael Reagan as well as half-sister of the late Maureen Reagan. She went to grade school at The John Thomas Dye School in Bel Air, and graduated from the Orme School of Arizona in 1970. In an op-ed she wrote for the &quot;New York Times&quot;, Davis admitted her addiction to prescription amphetamines from her teenage years into her early 20s, alongside a description of times she had recklessly driven while high on cocaine. 
She matriculated at Northwestern University, where she studied creative writing and drama. She then attended the University of Southern California for two years. She changed her last name to her mother&#x27;s maiden name, Davis, in an effort to have an independent career. She was active in the anti-nuclear movement before her father was elected president, and continued her activism through his term, stirring controversy and creating strife in the family. She has been a critic of the Republican Party, with which she has never been affiliated.

==Career==
In the early 1980s, Davis acted in a few television shows before getting her first publishing deal. In 1986, she published her first novel, &quot;Home Front&quot;. She used elements of her own life to create a fictional story, and because of that the book became controversial and she was widely criticized. Following her second novel &quot;Deadfall&quot;, she wrote an autobiography called &quot;The Way I See It&quot;, in which she revealed many family dramas and secrets. She has since spoken publicly about how she regrets the form, but not the content, of the critique she presented in the book.

In the July 1994 issue of &quot;Playboy&quot;, Davis posed for the magazine with a full frontal pictorial. This issue of the magazine also displayed Davis on its front cover. This issue is considered to be one of the magazine&#x27;s most controversial covers. Davis has posed for other magazines such as &quot;More&quot; in 2011. Playboy also issued a VHS tape as a complement to the 1994 issue.

When her father was diagnosed with Alzheimer&#x27;s, she began writing &quot;The Long Goodbye&quot; which was published in 2004. During that time, she began writing for magazines and newspapers, including &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Newsweek&quot; and &quot;Time&quot;. Her original screenplay, &quot;Spring Thaw&quot;, became the 2007 Hallmark Channel movie &quot;Sacrifices of the Heart&quot; starring Melissa Gilbert and Ken Howard.

==Personal life==

In 1969, Davis applied to Ohio University and Northwestern to study journalism, and enrolled in the latter. In the 1970s, she lived with Eagles guitarist Bernie Leadon. By this time, her mother had disowned her for living with Leadon as an unmarried couple. Together, Davis and Leadon co-wrote the song &quot;I Wish You Peace&quot;, which appeared on Eagles album &quot;One of These Nights&quot;. In the 1980s, she dated Timothy Hutton and later had a two-year relationship with Peter Strauss. In 2014, Davis expressed her frustration about having to date with the Secret Service monitoring her as they had time limits on evening dates and monitoring her and her partners&#x27; actions together, which is in part, why she rushed her relationship with her future husband, Paul Grilley. In 1984, she married Grilley, a yoga instructor and one of the founders of Yin Yoga. They divorced in 1990, without children and Davis never remarried. Davis is a vegetarian and has disagreed with laws that outlaw the use of marijuana. In 2011, she launched &quot;Beyond Alzheimer&#x27;s&quot; at UCLA, which she still runs.

In a September 2018, op-ed for the &quot;Washington Post&quot;, Davis wrote that she had been sexually assaulted nearly 40 years earlier by a studio executive. The op-ed was released the same week Christine Blasey Ford recounted an alleged sexual assault by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. Davis released the piece in support of Blasey Ford when she had been criticized for not remembering details of the alleged assault.

After the synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh in October 2018, Davis accused President Donald Trump of failing to provide solace to the nation in times of tragedy: &quot;Let&#x27;s stop asking him!&quot; In August 2019, Davis wrote an editorial in the &quot;Washington Post&quot; condemning denigrating comments made by her father about black Africans at the United Nations in a 1971 phone conversation with President Richard Nixon which Nixon taped. The tapes were publicly released the day prior. In the editorial, Davis wrote: &quot;There is no defense, no rationalization, no suitable explanation for what my father said on that taped phone conversation.&quot;

In October 2021, she expressed her disdain for John Hinckley Jr. being fully released following the assassination attempt of her father in 1981, a view that contrasted with that of Michael Reagan, the adopted son of President Reagan and his first wife, Jane Wyman, who expressed forgiveness for Hinckley.

After the attempted assassination of Donald Trump, she voiced disdain for political violence and related the event to her own father&#x27;s experience being shot and the emotional toll it took on her family.

<doc id="759048" wikidata="Q2319307" url="?curid=759048" title="Owens River">
<text>The Owens River is a river in eastern California in the United States, approximately long. It drains into and through the Owens Valley, an arid basin between the eastern slope of the Sierra Nevada and the western faces of the Inyo and White Mountains. The river terminates at the endorheic Owens Lake south of Lone Pine, at the bottom of a watershed.

In the early 1900s, the Owens River was the focus of the California Water Wars, fought between the city of Los Angeles and the inhabitants of Owens Valley over the construction of the Los Angeles Aqueduct. Since 1913, the Owens River has been diverted to Los Angeles, causing the ruin of the valley&#x27;s economy and the drying of Owens Lake. In winter 2006, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power restored 5% of the pre-aqueduct flow to the river by court order, allowing the Owens River Gorge, the river bed in the valley, and Owens Lake to contain a small amount of water.

==Course==

The river rises in the Sierra Nevada in southwestern Mono County, approximately south of Mono Lake and east of Yosemite Valley. It flows southeast across the Long Valley Caldera, through Lake Crowley reservoir, then descends through the Owens River Gorge, emerging at the north end of the Owens Valley northwest of Bishop. In the area around Bishop, it is diverted through many ditches to irrigate the surrounding farming region. It flows south-southeast through the Owens Valley between the Sierra Nevada on the west and the White and Inyo Mountains on the east, past Big Pine. Approximately south-southeast of Big Pine, most of the remaining river is diverted into the Los Angeles Aqueduct, completed in 1913 to supply municipal, recreational and agricultural water to Los Angeles. The remaining river flows through the southern valley, flanked by the Los Angeles Aqueduct, past Lone Pine, entering the lake bed of predominantly dry Owens Lake at the southern end of Owens Valley.

==Watershed==
The river flows through two major valleys of the extreme southwestern Great Basin – the Long Valley and Owens Valley. The north to south drainage basin is in portions of Mono and Inyo counties and terminates in the now-dry Owens Lake. To the northwest of the valley is the Long Valley Caldera, which is only a fraction of the size of the Owens Valley. The Owens River enters Owens Valley from the northwest, while the Spring Valley Wash drains the northernmost part of the valley, extending a tiny portion of the basin into Nevada. The river flows mainly on the east side of the valley, because alluvial deposits from Sierra Nevada streams have forced the river channel in that direction.

Vertical relief in the basin is immense – elevations range from at Mount Whitney, the highest peak in the continental United States, to on the bed of Owens Lake. The Owens River itself heads at an elevation of . Few people inhabit the sparse, open grasslands and steep mountainsides of the watershed; the 2009 population of Mono County was about 12,927 while Inyo County had some 17,293 inhabitants. The largest city on the river is Bishop, with a population of just under 4,000. Other significant towns include Lone Pine (population 2,035), Big Pine (population 1,707), and Independence (population 669).

==Geology==
The Owens River flows through part of the Basin and Range Province of North America&#x27;s Great Basin. The Owens Valley is a graben or rift valley, a section of land that has dropped down between two parallel faults, while the land on either side has risen. This has resulted in the flat floor and steep, towering walls of the present-day valley. With the Sierra Nevada on the west side and the Inyo Mountains and White Mountains on the east, with the highest peaks of either range rising to over and the floor of the valley at a comparatively low , the Owens River flows in one of the deepest valleys in the United States.

Further to the north, the Owens River basin encompasses predominantly igneous rocks and vast remnants of past volcanic activity. The upper of the river run through the Long Valley Caldera, an enormous -wide crater formed by a volcanic eruption some 760,000 years ago. The eruption&#x27;s resulting ash cloud covered much of the southwestern United States, including parts of ten U.S. states.
Mammoth Mountain, to the southwest (more popularly known as a major ski area) also formed from eruptions related to the Long Valley Caldera. To the north of the Caldera, extending to the Mono Lake area, lie the chain of Mono-Inyo Craters, which range in age from 400,000 to 500 years old.

During the Pleistocene at the end of the last glacial period, melting glaciers in the Sierra Nevada and Inyo/White Mountains fed prodigious amounts of runoff into the Owens River, causing it to expand to many times its current size. The increased river volume caused Owens Lake to rise as well, eventually spilling out the south side of the valley into the Mojave Desert. Ancient, now-abandoned river channels suggest that the extended Owens River ran south to China Lake, then east into Searles Lake, north into the Panamint Valley (where it formed Panamint Lake), and finally east into Death Valley and the ancient Lake Manly. This great inland sea was also fed by the Mojave River from the south, the Amargosa River from the east, and the Death Valley Wash from the north. During this relatively short time, the Owens River became part of a vast interior drainage system that stretched east to west, covering over . During the runoff peak, water from this massive basin may have escaped to the Colorado River through a valley leading to the southeast.

==History==

For thousands of years the Owens River valley was inhabited by the seminomadic Owens Valley Northern Paiute and the Shoshone tribes of Native Americans. The indigenous name for the river was &quot;Wakopee&quot;, while they called Owens Lake &quot;Pacheta&quot;. In the upper Owens Valley lie traces of some of California&#x27;s first irrigation systems, created by Paiute groups to water small patches of crops. It is believed that native people in the upper portion of the valley once built dams across the Owens River (and possibly one of its major tributaries, Bishop Creek) to divert water into local canals. The switch from a hunter-gatherer to a settled, agricultural lifestyle is probably the result of the climate of the Owens Valley becoming drier some 1,000 years ago.

Typically, the Native Americans built dams across the river or other tributary streams in the spring out of materials including boulders, dirt, reeds, grass, or other elements. The watercourse below the dam would then be desiccated, and the water led by canal to the irrigated plot of land, typically no more than a few square miles. Directly after the dam was closed and the river dried up, fish trapped on the dry riverbed would then be gathered and eaten. Before winter storms caused floods, the dam would be breached, allowing the river to flow naturally again, while fish would be collected in the dried-up river channel. By then, there would be enough food stored to last the winter in which the cropland would lie fallow.

In the nineteenth century, the Owens River was first seen by American explorers. One of the first explorers was John C. Fremont, who led a cartographic expedition to the Owens Valley in 1845. His party included Kit Carson, Edward Kern, and Richard Owens, the latter for whom the river, lake, and valley are named. Other well-known adventurers included Jedediah Smith and Joseph R. Walker, who also came into the area in the 1800s. Gradually, the river&#x27;s surroundings were settled by farmers and ranchers. The valley never accumulated a very large population, but mining activities brought significant income to the new inhabitants of the area. Ore was shipped down the Owens River from the north, and also borax and silver from Death Valley to the east. Until 1924, Owens Lake was still so large that a steamboat ferry operated between its east and west sides, ferrying freight and passengers across in three hours, much less than the three days required to semi-circumnavigate the lake. In 1872, the Lone Pine earthquake killed 27 people in the Owens Valley, mostly in Lone Pine.

==Ecology==
Beaver was re-introduced to the Owens Valley by the California Department of Fish and Game in 1948 in Baker Creek, and has since spread throughout the Owens Valley. Although it is controversial whether beaver were once native to the Owens Valley, there is growing evidence that they were native to the eastern slope of the Sierra Nevada. In particular, the northern Paiute of Walker Lake, Honey Lake and Pyramid Lake have a word for beaver &quot;su-i&#x27;-tu-ti-kut&#x27;-teh&quot;. When Stephen Powers visited the northern Paiute to collect Indian materials for the Smithsonian Institution in preparation for the Centennial Exhibition of 1876, he reported that the northern Paiute wrapped their hair in strips of beaver fur, made medicine from parts of beaver and that their creation legend included beaver. In addition, fur trapper Stephen Hall Meek &quot;set his traps on the Truckee River in 1833&quot;, which strongly suggests that he saw a beaver or beaver sign. Supporting this line of evidence, Tappe records in 1941 an eyewitness who said beaver were plentiful on the upper part of the Carson River and its tributaries in Alpine County until 1892 when they fell victim to heavy trapping.

In 2011, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP) decided to trap beaver (&quot;Castor canadensis&quot;) out of the Owens Valley, claiming that beaver are damming flows into their diversions of water to Los Angeles. This decision runs counter to an independent assessment commissioned by LADWP and the Inyo County Water Department in 1997, where it was recommended that beaver be maintained in reasonable populations and their dams left in place because &quot;Although beaver activity has resulted in the removal of much willow and other shrub and woody vegetation and the dams create favorable tule conditions and reduce fish spawning habitat, they also provide important fish rearing habitat, mesic meadows, and promote the growth of other riparian species. It is most likely that the physical removal of beaver dams will result in more adverse environmental impacts than environmental benefits.&quot;

===Water rights controversy===

The acquisition of water rights for the Los Angeles Aqueduct under the direction of William Mulholland was highly controversial and led to violence and sabotage by local residents in the 1920s. The diversion of water and the subsequent desiccation of Owens Lake remains highly controversial, and the restoration of the lake has been a long-time goal of the California environmentalist community. The lower Owens River and Owens Lake were left dry by the 1913 diversions, until lawsuits forced LADWP to start releasing water into the lower Owens River in December 2006. In less than one year, the lower Owens River was teeming with fish, birds and other wildlife.

<text>John Roberts Opel (January 5, 1925, in Kansas City, Missouri – November 3, 2011, in Fort Myers, Florida) was an American computer businessman. He served eleven years as the president of IBM between 1974 and 1985. He was the chief executive officer (CEO) of IBM from 1981 to 1985, and the chairman of the board of directors from 1983 to 1986.

==Early life and education==

Born in Kansas City, Missouri, Opel grew up in Jefferson City, Missouri, where his father owned a hardware store. He majored in English at Westminster College in Fulton, Missouri. He then fought in the Philippines and Okinawa in World War II and earned an MBA degree from the University of Chicago in 1949.

==Career==
Upon graduation, Opel had two job offers, one to rewrite economics textbooks, and the other to take over his father&#x27;s hardware business. While taking a fishing trip with his father and a family friend who worked for IBM, he was offered a third job as a salesman in central Missouri, and accepted.

In 1959, Opel became executive assistant to IBM CEO Thomas J. Watson Jr., after which he rose rapidly, taking positions in manufacturing and public relations and other departments, and managed the introduction of the IBM System/360 mainframe computer in 1964. In 1974, he was elected president. In 1981, he became the CEO of IBM, then its chairman.

Under his leadership, IBM developed and launched the first IBM personal computer, forever changing the face of computing and IBM.

==Death==

A former longtime resident of Chappaqua, New York, Opel died at the age of 86 at his Fort Myers, Florida, home in 2011.

<text>Edward Phillips Oppenheim (22 October 1866 – 3 February 1946) was an English novelist, a prolific writer of best-selling genre fiction, featuring glamorous characters, international intrigue and fast action. Notably easy to read, they were viewed as popular entertainments. He was featured on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine in 1927.

== Biography ==
Edward Phillips Oppenheim was born 22 October 1866 in Tottenham, London, the son of Henrietta Susannah Temperley Budd and Edward John Oppenheim, a leather merchant. After attending Wyggeston Grammar School until the sixth form in 1883, his family&#x27;s finances forced him to withdraw and he worked in his father&#x27;s business for almost twenty years. His father subsidized the publication of his first novel, which proved just successful enough to break even. He published five of his novels between 1908 and 1912 under the pseudonym &quot;Anthony Partridge&quot;.

Around 1900, Julien Stevens Ulman (1865–1920), a wealthy New York leather merchant who enjoyed Oppenheim&#x27;s books, bought the leather works and made him a salaried director to support his writing career.

He quickly found a successful formula and established his reputation. In 1913, John Buchan, launching his career as a suspense novelist, called Oppenheim &quot;my master in fiction&quot; and &quot;the greatest Jewish writer since Isaiah&quot;. As early as that year, his publishers were bringing out new editions of some of his earlier works to meet, in the words of one trade publication, &quot;the insatiable demand of the public for more stories by him&quot;. It added: &quot;Readers of the author&#x27;s recent books will find these first stories of life sketches full of interest, their very crudeness being positively amusing in light of his present finished craftsmanship.&quot;

In 1892 Oppenheim married an American, Elise Clara Hopkins of Easthampton, Massachusetts. They lived in Evington, Leicestershire in what is now The Cedars pub until the First World War and had one daughter. During that war he worked for the Ministry of Information.

He described his method in 1922: &quot;I create one more or less interesting personality, try to think of some dramatic situation in which he or she might be placed, and use that as the opening of a nebulous chain of events.&quot; He never used an outline: &quot;My characters would resent it.&quot; When he needed villains for his diplomatic and political intrigues he drew on Prussian militarists and anarchists, enough for one reviewer to lament &quot;the baldness of his propaganda&quot;. For example, in &quot;A People&#x27;s Man&quot; (1915), a socialist discovers that his movement is secretly run by German spies.

A 1927 review in &quot;The New York Times&quot; said he &quot;numbers his admirers in the hundreds of thousands and has one or more of his books on a prominent shelf in almost every home one enters&quot;. He appeared on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine on 12 September of that same year.

Reviews for his work treated them as entertainments with only a slight relationship to the mystery genre. In 1933, a review of &quot;Crooks in the Sunshine&quot; explained that &quot;Mr. Oppenheim&#x27;s crooks are so polished that they have no difficulty in moving in the very best society... There is very little mystery in this book, but there is dress-suit crime galore.&quot; In 1936, a review of &quot;A Magnificent Hoax&quot;, his one hundredth novel, said: &quot;The hoax is on the reader, who is led, through nearly 300 pages, only to find that nothing very terrible has happened. The explanation takes a bit of believing, but since it extricates several very nice people from what looks like a nasty mess, one is willing to let that pass.&quot; &quot;The Shy Plutocrat&quot;, published early in World War II, was &quot;a good tale to take your mind off your worries&quot;. Readers came to expect familiar themes, &quot;the peculiar Oppenheim blend of dispatch-box atmosphere, femmes fatales, double traitors, and a tight plot&quot;. In mid-career, &quot;The Great Impersonation&quot; (1920) was called &quot;his best work&quot;.

Along with dozens of novel and short story collections, he produced an autobiography, &quot;The Pool of Memory&quot;, in 1942.

Oppenheim&#x27;s literary success enabled him to buy a villa on the French riviera and a yacht, then a house in Guernsey, though he lost access to this during the Second World War. He regained the house, Le Vauquiedor Manor in St. Martins, after the war and died there on 3 February 1946. His wife died there on 25 November.

An assessment that appeared in &quot;The New York Times&quot; upon his death said: &quot;As he recalls in his pleasant and modest autobiography, all his books were easy to write. They were equally easy to read, especially on a summer vacation, when escapist literature is most welcome.&quot; He composed by dictating to a secretary and once produced seven works in a single year. His social set included the characters that populated his novels, where he created &quot;a glamorous world of international intrigue, romance and plushy society galloping along in swift action and suspense&quot;. One academic study calls him &quot;a talented entertainer&quot;.

=== Short story collections ===
Most of Oppenheim&#x27;s 38 collections of short stories, 27 of which have been published in the United States, are series with sustained interest in which one group of characters appears throughout. In 2004 and 2014, Stark House Press published two collections of previously uncollected Oppenheim stories, edited by Daniel Paul Morrison, perhaps the foremost collector of works by Oppenheim. &quot;Secrets and Sovereigns: The Uncollected Stories of E. Phillips Oppenheim&quot; appeared in 2004, with a biographical introduction and collector&#x27;s bibliography by Morrison. And then in 2014, &quot;Ghosts and Gamblers: The Further Uncollected Stories of E. Phillips Oppeneheim&quot; was published by Stark House Press.

<text>Frederick Burr Opper (January 2, 1857 – August 28, 1937) was one of the pioneers of American newspaper comic strips, best known for his comic strip &quot;Happy Hooligan&quot;. His comic characters were featured in magazine gag cartoons, covers, political cartoons and comic strips for six decades.

Born to Austrian-American German-speaking immigrants Lewis and Aurelia Burr Oppers in Madison, Ohio, Frederick was the eldest of three children. At the age of 14, he dropped out of school to work as a printer&#x27;s apprentice at the local &quot;Madison Gazette&quot;, and at 16, he moved to New York City where he worked in a store and continued to draw. He studied briefly at Cooper Union, followed by a short stint as pupil and assistant to illustrator Frank Beard.

Opper&#x27;s first cartoon was published in &quot;Wild Oats&quot; in 1876, followed by cartoons and illustrations in &quot;Scribner’s Monthly&quot; and &quot;St. Nicholas Magazine&quot;. He worked as illustrator at &quot;Frank Leslie&#x27;s Weekly&quot; from 1877 to 1880. Opper was then hired to draw for &quot;Puck&quot; by publishers Joseph Keppler and Adolph Schwarzmann. He stayed with &quot;Puck&quot; for 18 years, drawing everything from spot illustrations to chromolithograph covers.

Opper married Nellie Barnett on May 18, 1881. They had three children, Lawrence, Anna and Sophia.

==Career==
===&quot;Happy Hooligan&quot;===
In 1899, Opper accepted an offer by William Randolph Hearst for a position with the &quot;New York Journal&quot;. His &quot;Happy Hooligan&quot; strip first appeared in the &quot;New York Journal&quot; in 1900, and it ran until 1932. Hooligan was a tramp with a little tin can hat whose gentle simplicity and bumbling good nature made him a success. On Happy&#x27;s 30th birthday, Opper threw a party attended by President Hoover, former President Coolidge, Charles Schwab, Alfred E. Smith and others.

Opper&#x27;s other popular strips were &quot;Alphonse and Gaston&quot;, &quot;And Her Name Was Maud&quot;, &quot;Howsan Lott&quot; and &quot;Our Antediluvian Ancestors&quot;. Beginning in 1904, Opper drew &quot;And Her Name Was Maud&quot;, about the kicking mule Maud, into comic strips, books and animation. On May 23, 1926, he positioned &quot;And Her Name Was Maud&quot; as the topper to &quot;Happy Hooligan&quot;, where it ran until both strips came to a conclusion on October 14, 1932.

Opper&#x27;s strips were very popular in Italy, where Hooligan was the most loved strip character in Italy before the coming of Mickey Mouse, as declared by the major Italian poet Attilio Bertolucci. Hooligan&#x27;s name in Italy was Fortunello (&quot;small lucky&quot;), and Maud&#x27;s name was Checca (Francy).

===Political cartoons===

Among Opper&#x27;s contributions for Puck was a cartoon that satirized the rise of sensationalism in journalism: this cartoon, from March 7, 1894, shows a newspaper mogul (possibly Joseph Pulitzer) raking in the profits, yet misleading the public. Noteworthy in this political cartoon is an early use of the term &quot;fake news.&quot; In addition, Opper drew influential political cartoons supporting Hearst&#x27;s campaign against the &quot;trusts&quot; with characters &quot;Willie and Teddy&quot;, depicting William McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt, &quot;Willie and his Papa&quot;, satirizing McKinley and &quot;Papa Trusts&quot;, and &quot;Nursie&quot;, a depiction of Cleveland industrialist Mark Hanna. Opper&#x27;s other characters included Mr. Common Man, which is believed to be the origin of John Q. Public. His artwork appeared in Hearst&#x27;s &quot;New York Journal&quot;, &quot;Boston American&quot;, &quot;Chicago Examiner&quot;, &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot; and &quot;Los Angeles Examiner&quot;. In 1902 he published &quot;Nursery Rhymes for Infant Industries: An Alphabet of Joyous Trusts&quot; in which each of the 26 Alphabet letters began an anti-trust rhyme.

Opper also illustrated books for Edgar Wilson Nye, Mark Twain, Marietta Holley (ie: &quot;Samantha at Saratoga, or Racin&#x27; After Fashion&quot;), and Finley Peter Dunne, and, as well, published his own books, including &quot;Puck&#x27;s Opper Book&quot; (1888), &quot;The Folks in Funnyville&quot; (1900) and &quot;Happy Hooligan Home Again&quot; (1907).

Opper was a member of several New York clubs, and he painted as a hobby. He retired in 1934 due to failing eyesight. He died August 28, 1937, at his home in New Rochelle, New York, and was cremated. Cartoonists Russ Westover and Alex Raymond took part in an August 29, 1937, memorial to Opper broadcast on New York&#x27;s WNEW.

<text>Noctilucent clouds (NLCs), or night shining clouds, are tenuous cloud-like phenomena in the upper atmosphere of Earth. When viewed from space, they are called polar mesospheric clouds (PMCs), detectable as a diffuse scattering layer of water ice crystals near the summer polar mesopause. They consist of ice crystals and from the ground are only visible during astronomical twilight. &quot;Noctilucent&quot; roughly means &quot;night shining&quot; in Latin. They are most often observed during the summer months from latitudes between ±50° and ±70°. Too faint to be seen in daylight, they are visible only when the observer and the lower layers of the atmosphere are in Earth&#x27;s shadow, but while these very high clouds are still in sunlight. Recent studies suggest that increased atmospheric methane emissions produce additional water vapor through chemical reactions once the methane molecules reach the mesosphere – creating, or reinforcing existing, noctilucent clouds.

== General ==

No confirmed record of their observation exists before 1885, although they may have been observed a few decades earlier by Thomas Romney Robinson in Armagh.

== Formation ==
Noctilucent clouds are composed of tiny crystals of water ice up to 100 nm in diameter and exist at a height of about , higher than any other clouds in Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. Clouds in the Earth&#x27;s lower atmosphere form when water collects on particles, but mesospheric clouds may form directly from water vapour in addition to forming on dust particles.
Data from the Aeronomy of Ice in the Mesosphere satellite suggests that noctilucent clouds require water vapour, dust, and very cold temperatures to form. The sources of both the dust and the water vapour in the upper atmosphere are not known with certainty. The dust is believed to come from micrometeors, although particulates from volcanoes and dust from the troposphere are also possibilities. The moisture could be lifted through gaps in the tropopause, as well as forming from the reaction of methane with hydroxyl radicals in the stratosphere.

The exhaust from Space Shuttles, in use between 1981 and 2011, which was almost entirely water vapour after the detachment of the Solid Rocket Booster at a height of about , was found to generate minuscule individual clouds. About half of the vapour was released into the thermosphere, usually at altitudes of . In August 2014, a SpaceX Falcon 9 also caused noctilucent clouds over Orlando, Florida after a launch.

The exhaust can be transported to the Arctic region in little over a day, although the exact mechanism of this very high-speed transfer is unknown. As the water migrates northward, it falls from the thermosphere into the colder mesosphere, which occupies the region of the atmosphere just below. Although this mechanism is the cause of individual noctilucent clouds, it is not thought to be a major contributor to the phenomenon as a whole.

As the mesosphere contains very little moisture, approximately one hundred millionth that of air from the Sahara, and is extremely thin, the ice crystals can form only at temperatures below about . This means that noctilucent clouds form predominantly during summer when, counterintuitively, the mesosphere is coldest as a result of seasonally varying vertical winds, leading to cold summertime conditions in the upper mesosphere (upwelling, resulting in adiabatic cooling) and wintertime heating (downwelling, resulting in adiabatic heating). Therefore, they cannot be observed (even if they are present) inside the Polar circles because the Sun is never low enough under the horizon at this season at these latitudes. Noctilucent clouds form mostly near the polar regions, because the mesosphere is coldest there. Clouds in the southern hemisphere are about higher than those in the northern hemisphere.

Ultraviolet radiation from the Sun breaks water molecules apart, reducing the amount of water available to form noctilucent clouds. The radiation is known to vary cyclically with the solar cycle and satellites have been tracking the decrease in brightness of the clouds with the increase of ultraviolet radiation for the last two solar cycles. It has been found that changes in the clouds follow changes in the intensity of ultraviolet rays by about a year, but the reason for this long lag is not yet known.

Noctilucent clouds are known to exhibit high radar reflectivity, in a frequency range of 50 MHz to 1.3 GHz. This behaviour is not well understood but a possible explanation is that the ice grains become coated with a thin metal film composed of sodium and iron, which makes the cloud far more reflective to radar, although this explanation remains controversial. Sodium and iron atoms are stripped from incoming micrometeors and settle into a layer just above the altitude of noctilucent clouds, and measurements have shown that these elements are severely depleted when the clouds are present. Other experiments have demonstrated that, at the extremely low temperatures of a noctilucent cloud, sodium vapour can rapidly be deposited onto an ice surface.

== Discovery and investigation ==

Noctilucent clouds are first known to have been observed in 1885, two years after the 1883 eruption of Krakatoa. It remains unclear whether their appearance had anything to do with the volcanic eruption or whether their discovery was due to more people observing the spectacular sunsets caused by the volcanic debris in the atmosphere. Studies have shown that noctilucent clouds are not caused solely by volcanic activity, although dust and water vapour could be injected into the upper atmosphere by eruptions and contribute to their formation. Scientists at the time assumed the clouds were another manifestation of volcanic ash, but after the ash had settled out of the atmosphere, the noctilucent clouds persisted. Finally, the theory that the clouds were composed of volcanic dust was disproved by Malzev in 1926. In the years following their discovery, the clouds were studied extensively by Otto Jesse of Germany, who was the first to photograph them, in 1887, and seems to have been the one to coin the term &quot;noctilucent cloud&quot;. His notes provide evidence that noctilucent clouds first appeared in 1885. He had been doing detailed observations of the unusual sunsets caused by the Krakatoa eruption the previous year and firmly believed that, if the clouds had been visible then, he would undoubtedly have noticed them. Systematic photographic observations of the clouds were organized in 1887 by Jesse, Foerster, and Stolze and, after that year, continuous observations were carried out at the Berlin Observatory.

In the decades after Otto Jesse&#x27;s death in 1901, there were few new insights into the nature of noctilucent clouds. Wegener&#x27;s conjecture, that they were composed of water ice, was later shown to be correct. Study was limited to ground-based observations and scientists had very little knowledge of the mesosphere until the 1960s, when direct rocket measurements began. These showed for the first time that the clouds&#x27; occurrence coincided with very low temperatures in the mesosphere.

Noctilucent clouds were first detected from space by an instrument on the OGO-6 satellite in 1972. The OGO-6 observations of a bright scattering layer over the polar caps were identified as poleward extensions of these clouds. A later satellite, the Solar Mesosphere Explorer, mapped the distribution of the clouds between 1981 and 1986 with its ultraviolet spectrometer. The clouds were detected with a lidar in 1995 at Utah State University, even when they were not visible to the naked eye. The first physical confirmation that water ice is indeed the primary component of noctilucent clouds came from the HALOE instrument on the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite in 2001.

In 2001, the Swedish Odin satellite performed spectral analyses on the clouds, and produced daily global maps that revealed large patterns in their distribution.

The AIM (Aeronomy of Ice in the Mesosphere) satellite was launched on 25 April 2007. It was the first satellite dedicated to studying noctilucent clouds, and made its first observations a month later (25 May). Images taken by the satellite show shapes in the clouds that are similar to shapes in tropospheric clouds, hinting at similarities in their dynamics.

In the previous year, scientists with the Mars Express mission had announced their discovery of carbon dioxide–crystal clouds on Mars that extended to above the planet&#x27;s surface. These are the highest clouds discovered over the surface of a rocky planet. Like noctilucent clouds on Earth, they can be observed only when the Sun is below the horizon.

Research published in the journal &quot;Geophysical Research Letters&quot; in June 2009 suggests that noctilucent clouds observed following the Tunguska Event of 1908 are evidence that the impact was caused by a comet.

The United States Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) and the United States Department of Defense Space Test Program (STP) conducted the Charged Aerosol Release Experiment (CARE) on September 19, 2009, using exhaust particles from a Black Brant XII suborbital sounding rocket launched from NASA&#x27;s Wallops Flight Facility to create an artificial noctilucent cloud. The cloud was to be observed over a period of weeks or months by ground instruments and the Spatial Heterodyne IMager for MEsospheric Radicals (SHIMMER) instrument on the NRL/STP STPSat-1 spacecraft. The rocket&#x27;s exhaust plume was observed and reported to news organizations in the United States from New Jersey to Massachusetts.

A 2018 experiment briefly created noctilucent clouds over Alaska, allowing ground-based measurements and experiments aimed at verifying computer simulations of the phenomenon. A suborbital NASA rocket was launched on 26 January 2018 by University of Alaska professor Richard Collins. It carried water-filled canisters, which were released at about above the Earth. Since the naturally-occurring clouds only appear in summer, this experiment was conducted in mid-winter to assure that its results would not be mixed with a natural event.

== Description from satellites ==


PMC&#x27;s have four major types based on physical structure and appearance. Type I veils are very tenuous and lack well-defined structure, somewhat like cirrostratus or poorly defined cirrus. Type II bands are long streaks that often occur in groups arranged roughly parallel to each other. They are usually more widely spaced than the bands or elements seen with cirrocumulus clouds. Type III billows are arrangements of closely spaced, roughly parallel short streaks that mostly resemble cirrus. Type IV whirls are partial or, more rarely, complete rings of cloud with dark centres.

Satellite observations allow the very coldest parts of the polar mesosphere to be observed, all the way to the geographic pole. In the early 1970s, visible airglow photometers first scanned the atmospheric horizon throughout the summer polar mesospause region. This experiment, which flew on the OGO-6 satellite, was the first to trace noctilucent-like cloud layers across the polar cap. The very bright scattering layer was seen in full daylight conditions, and was identified as the poleward extension of noctilucent clouds. In the early 1980s, the layer was observed again from a satellite, the Solar Mesospheric Explorer (SME). On board this satellite was an ultraviolet spectrometer, which mapped the distributions of clouds over the time period 1981 to 1986. The experiment measured the altitude profile of scattering from clouds at two spectral channels (primarily) 265 nm and 296 nm. 

Polar mesospheric clouds generally increase in brightness and occurrence frequency with increasing latitude, from about 60° to the highest latitudes observed (85°). So far, no apparent dependence on longitude has been found, nor is there any evidence of a dependence on auroral activity.

On 8 July 2018, NASA launched a giant balloon from Esrange, Sweden which traveled through the stratosphere across the Arctic to Western Nunavut, Canada in five days. The giant balloon was loaded with cameras, which captured six million high-resolution images filling up 120 terabytes of data storage, aiming to study the PMCs which are affected by the atmospheric gravity waves, resulted from air being pushed up by mountain ranges all the way up to the mesosphere. These images would aid in studying turbulence in the atmosphere, and consequently better weather forecasting.

NASA uses AIM satellite to study these noctilucent clouds, which always occur during the summer season near the poles. However, tomographic analyses of AIM satellite indicate that there is a spatial negative correlation between albedo and wave‐induced altitude.

== Observation ==

Noctilucent clouds are generally colourless or pale blue, although occasionally other colours including red and green have been observed. The characteristic blue colour comes from absorption by ozone in the path of the sunlight illuminating the noctilucent cloud. They can appear as featureless bands, but frequently show distinctive patterns such as streaks, wave-like undulations, and whirls. They are considered a &quot;beautiful natural phenomenon&quot;. Noctilucent clouds may be confused with cirrus clouds, but appear sharper under magnification. Those caused by rocket exhausts tend to show colours other than silver or blue, because of iridescence caused by the uniform size of the water droplets produced.

Noctilucent clouds may be seen at latitudes of 50° to 65°. They seldom occur at lower latitudes (although there have been sightings as far south as Paris, Utah, Italy, Turkey and Spain), and closer to the poles it does not get dark enough for the clouds to become visible. They occur during summer, from mid-May to mid-August in the northern hemisphere and between mid-November and mid-February in the southern hemisphere. They are very faint and tenuous, and may be observed only in twilight around sunrise and sunset when the clouds of the lower atmosphere are in shadow, but the noctilucent cloud is illuminated by the Sun. They are best seen when the Sun is between 6° and 16° below the horizon. Although noctilucent clouds occur in both hemispheres, they have been observed thousands of times in the northern hemisphere, but fewer than 100 times in the southern. Southern hemisphere noctilucent clouds are fainter and occur less frequently; additionally the southern hemisphere has a lower population and less land area from which to make observations.

These clouds may be studied from the ground, from space, and directly by sounding rocket. Also, some noctilucent clouds are made of smaller crystals, 30 nm or less, which are invisible to observers on the ground because they do not scatter enough light.

== Forms ==
The clouds may show a large variety of different patterns and forms. An identification scheme was developed by Fogle in 1970 that classified five different forms. These classifications have since been modified and subdivided. 
# Type I veils are very tenuous and lack well-defined structure, somewhat like cirrostratus or poorly defined cirrus. 
# Type II bands are long streaks that often occur in roughly parallel groups, usually more widely spaced than the bands or elements seen with cirrocumulus clouds. 
# Type III billows are arrangements of closely spaced, roughly parallel short streaks that mostly resemble cirrus. 
# Type IV whirls are partial or, more rarely, complete rings of cloud with dark centres.

<text>A Matter of Confidence or Issue of Confidence in the Parliament of the United Kingdom is a matter that is so important that the government of the day must demonstrate that it has the &quot;confidence&quot; of the House of Commons, namely that a majority of the House of Commons votes to support the government of day. If the government of the day is defeated on a confidence matter, by constitutional convention it will need to resign or call a general election.

The concept of a matter of confidence is broader than a formal motion of no confidence, which is a specific example of a matter of confidence. If the government is defeated on a motion of no confidence, that is a clear expression by the House of Commons that it does not support the government. However, other matters can also be matters of confidence. For example, the Speech from the Throne is an outline of the government&#x27;s political agenda for the upcoming session. If the government is defeated on the address to accept the speech, that is generally considered a matter of confidence. A defeat on the yearly budget is also normally considered a confidence matter. Important government bills may also be considered a confidence matter. If the government is defeated on any of these, the Official Opposition may make a formal motion of no confidence, or the government may simply accept that it has lost the confidence of the Commons. The government can then advise the monarch to dissolve Parliament and call a general election.

The concept of confidence matters is also used in other parliaments which follow the Westminster system of government, such as the Parliament of Canada and the Parliament of Australia.

<doc id="759075" wikidata="Q7917939" url="?curid=759075" title="Vedauwoo">
<text>Vedauwoo () is an area of rocky outcrops (Sherman Granite) located in southeastern Wyoming, United States, north of Interstate 80, between Laramie and Cheyenne. Its name, according to some, is a romanized version of the Arapaho word &quot;bito&#x27;o&#x27;wu&quot; meaning &quot;earth-born&quot;.

Vedauwoo is located in the Medicine Bow - Routt National Forest and includes a day-use picnic area and an overnight campground. It is also a popular climbing area.

Interstate 80 passes just south of the main rock outcroppings and well-marked highway signs indicate the exit to use in order to reach Vedauwoo. An alternative is to drive in from the Happy Jack road that runs between Laramie and Cheyenne.

== Overview ==
The 1.4 billion year old Sherman Granite is the rock formation that makes up Vedauwoo&#x27;s characteristic hoodoos and outcrops. The formation represent one of the oldest that outcrops in Wyoming (but it still more than a billion years younger than the rocks of the Tetons). It is exposed at the surface around Vedauwoo due to the uplift of the Laramie Mountains that began around 70 million years ago. Younger layers of rock and sediment have been progressively eroded in process that continues to this day. The hard granite of Vedauwoo is made of large crystals of quartz, orthoclase, plagioclase, and some mica and is more erosion-resistant, resulting in wind and water-sculpted forms. Just east of Vedauwoo, along I-80, sandstone cliffs are formed by the Permian-age Fountain Formation, which is about 300 million years old. The ancient sand dunes of a broad desert met with the salty waters of a shallow, epicontinental sea, producing examples of cross-stratification. Fossils of sea urchins, snails, and sea lilies can be found in some of these rocks.

Wildlife abounds in and around Vedauwoo with Wyoming ground squirrels, mule deer, elk, moose, yellow-bellied marmots, least chipmunks, pronghorn, wild turkeys, badger, prairie dog, coyote, and mountain lions all calling the area home. Beaver are found in some of the creeks, where their dams and lodges form cover for a variety of aquatic insects, frogs, and fish. Golden and bald eagles can be seen soaring on the thermals alongside hawks, crow, ravens, turkey vulture, and numerous songbirds. Anglers find brook trout in the streams and ponds but over the past decade or so the populations of these fish have dropped noticeably.

==Climbing==
TJ Burr, Author and Mountaineer, tells about his experiences at Vedauwoo in his adventure book, Rocky Mountain Adventure Collection. The following is an excerpt from the chapter, Bouldering at Vedauwoo: ″The Vedauwoo rocks are large blocks of weathered Sherman granite primarily composed of crystalline fragments of quartz and feldspar. The higher concentration of feldspar gives the rocks a pinkish tint. They are grouped together in large granite towers formed by stacks of huge rectangular blocks that have been rounded by windblown sand. They provide some of North America&#x27;s best technical climbs. Although they lack cracks and holds, they provide excellent friction and chimney climbs. Living only fifteen miles from Vedauwoo while attending the University of Wyoming, I had the privilege of spending many weekends climbing, rappelling, and hiking around the rocky wonderland. Vedauwoo provides a welcome outlet for many stressed college students. It is also frequented by technical climbers, family picnickers, and campers. On any given day with nice Wyoming weather, there will be numerous climbers testing their skills on the vertical rock faces of the Vedauwoo Recreation Area.″

Vedauwoo is particularly known for its offwidth crack climbing.

<text>Asgard is a fictional realm and its capital city appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by Stan Lee, Larry Lieber and Jack Kirby, the realm first appeared in &quot;Journey into Mystery&quot; #85 (October 1962). Based on the realm of the same name from Germanic mythology (particularly Norse), Asgard is home to the Asgardians and other beings adapted from Norse mythology. It features prominently in stories that follow the Marvel Comics superhero Thor.

Asgard has appeared in comics and various media adaptations, including the Marvel Cinematic Universe films &quot;Thor&quot; (2011), &quot;&quot; (2013), &quot;&quot; (2015), &quot;&quot; (2017), &quot;&quot; (2019), and the Disney+ series &quot;Loki&quot; (2021). Eventually, Asgard was relocated to Earth in Norway and appeared in &quot;Avengers: Endgame&quot; and &quot;&quot; (2022).

==Fictional history==
According to Asgardian legend, in the beginning there was nothing, but in time two worlds came into being on opposite sides of the void. The one to the north was named Niflheim, a world of clouds and shadows in whose center surged the fountain Hvergelmir, from which flowed twelve rivers of ice. The one to the south was named Muspelheim, which teemed with rivers of fire. Eventually the warm air from the south carved out the ice giant Ymir from the ice in the north. Ymir became the father of all the giants, and his cow Auðumbla licked out of the ice the first Asgardian, Buri. Buri had a son named Borr, who married the giantess Bestla. Borr and Bestla had three sons named Odin, Vili, and Ve, who were known as the Æsir. Odin and his brothers grew to hate the giants and slew Ymir, and his blood formed a great sea. Odin and his brothers then raised Ymir&#x27;s body from the sea and created Midgard between Niflheim and Muspelheim. With Ymir&#x27;s bones they created mountains, and with his hair they created trees. They then raised Ymir&#x27;s skull upon four pillars to create the heavens. Within the skull contained sparks from Muspelheim, which became the sun, moon, and stars. When Midgard was complete, Odin and his brothers created a home for themselves above it called Asgard. Between the two worlds they stretched a rainbow bridge and called it Bifröst.

Once a year Odin must undertake the Odinsleep to regain his strength. During this time Asgard is vulnerable to attack from its many enemies, most notably Odin&#x27;s adopted son, Loki. Loki first takes command of Asgard during the Odinsleep, using his right as the &#x27;son&#x27; of Odin before Thor could claim it, but fled when Asgard was invaded by Mangog as he realized that this new foe was too powerful. Loki later usurped the throne of Asgard by taking the Odinring, but fled again when Asgard was invaded by the fire demon, Surtur.

The throne of Asgard later passes to Thor after Odin is killed in battle by Surtur, when the demon invades Earth.

It was prophesied that Loki would lead Asgard&#x27;s enemies in a final conflict known as Ragnarök, which would lead to its destruction. This comes to pass when Loki obtains the forge that created Mjolnir and creates new uru hammers for his army. The entirety of Asgard and its inhabitants are destroyed in the resulting battle.

After Ragnarök, Donald Blake awakens Thor from the &quot;Void of Non-Existence&quot;. Thor returns to Earth and rebuilds Asgard outside of Broxton, Oklahoma, purchasing the land with gold from the treasury. Thor then goes about restoring the Asgardians, who have been reborn in the bodies of mortal men and women.

Asgard&#x27;s location on Earth makes the city a target during the &quot;Secret Invasion&quot; by the Skrulls led by a Super-Skrull named Godkiller, whose powers mimic Thundra, Titania, Volcana and Battleaxe. The aliens are repelled with help from Thor&#x27;s ally, Beta Ray Bill.

When Thor is forced to abdicate the throne and is exiled for killing his grandfather Bor, who was brought from the past and driven mad by Loki, control of Asgard passes to Thor&#x27;s half-brother, Balder.

Asgard is destroyed yet again after Norman Osborn seizes control of S.H.I.E.L.D. following the Secret Invasion as he seeks to expel Asgard from U.S. soil in an effort to consolidate power. Osborn leads the Dark Avengers in the Siege of Asgard. The invading forces are defeated with help from the reunited Avengers, although Asgard itself is toppled by the Sentry. Immediately following the Siege, Thor reerects Heimdall&#x27;s observatory atop Stark Tower as sign of solidarity with Midgard and appreciation for the Avengers&#x27; aid.

Thor restores Odin to the throne when the nine realms are invaded by &quot;the World Eaters&quot;. However, after Thor and Odin&#x27;s long-forgotten brother Cul, kill each other in battle during the &quot;Fear Itself&quot; event, Odin passes control of Asgard to the Vanir, headed by the &quot;All-Mother&quot;, a triumvirate of female deities consisting of Freyja, Gaea and Idunn. Tony Stark&#x27;s company, Stark Resilient then rebuilds Asgard over Broxton, Oklahoma, where it is rechristened as &quot;Asgardia&quot;.

During the &quot;Original Sin&quot; storyline, it is revealed that there is a Tenth Realm in Asgard called Heven that is inhabited by Angels. It was cut off from the rest of the realms following the Angels&#x27; attack on Asgard which led to the apparent death of an infant Angela.

Asgard later established the Congress of Worlds which consists of the representatives of the Nine Realms. After Heven was reintegrated with the other Realms, representatives of Heven started appearing as members of the Congress of Worlds.

==Regions==
The Asgard dimension contains several distinct regions.

===The Nine Realms===
===Other worlds and regions===
==The six races==
The six races of intelligent humanoid beings known to reside within the Asgard dimension.

Not to be confused with the dragon Fafnir.

=== Racial attributes ===
Although they look human, all Asgardians possess certain superhuman physical attributes. They are extremely long-lived (though not immortal like their Olympian counterparts), aging at an extremely slow rate upon reaching adulthood (through the periodic consumption of the golden apples of Idunn). Asgardian flesh and bone is three times denser than similar human tissue, contributing to their superhuman strength and weight. An average Asgardian male can lift 30 tons (27.2 metric tons); an average Asgardian female can lift about 25 tons (22.7 metric tons). Asgardians are immune to all terrestrial diseases and resistant to conventional injury (however this resilience seems relatively incapable of defeating the zombie plague in Earth-2149 that affects even Asgardians). The metabolism of the Asgardians gives them superhuman stamina in all physical activities.

Demons are beings of fire and tend to be about the same stature as the Asgardians.

Dwarves are smaller in stature than the Asgardians, and have short, stocky bodies. Their average height is .

Elves vary greatly in size from four to eight feet (1.2 to 2.4 meters). They tend toward slender bodies and proportionately longer limbs. The dark elves tend to be darker in color than the light elves. Both types have natural proclivity towards magic.

Giants are basically humanoid in appearance and color although they tend toward the neanderthalic in body and bone structure. Their most distinguishing feature is their height. The average giant is tall, although some may reach . On occasion giants will produce stunted offspring who look similar to the Asgardians. Loki and the Executioner are both children of giants despite their diminutive six or seven foot (1.8 or 2.1 meter) stature.

Trolls are the least human-looking of the denizens of Asgard, possessing body characteristics that are almost simian. Trolls are stocky and massive, have thick body hair (almost fur) and tend toward a ruddy orange color. They are on average taller than the Asgardians but shorter than giants, around tall, although some trolls are considerably taller. Trolls tend to be extremely strong, stronger than the average Asgardian, dwarf or elf and on par with giants. Trolls like Ulik rival Thor in strength.

==Flora and fauna==
There are different flora and fauna in Asgard:

===Flora===

Yggdrasil; the world tree is an immense ash tree that is central to the Asgardian dimension. The tree is supported by three roots that extended far into the other worlds; one to the spring of Hvergelmir in Niflheim, one to the well of Mimir in Jotunheim, and another to the well of Wyrd in Asgard. Though Midgard is not physically connected to Yggdrasil, it is said that the Earth&#x27;s axis is in alignment with the tree. In the limited series &quot;&quot;, Thor and the Warriors Three are sent to retrieve golden apples from the branches of the tree. Odin once hung himself from the tree for nine days and nights as a sacrifice to gain knowledge of the runes. Thor repeated this action during Ragnarök. Later Amora the Enchantress attempt to destroy the tree in an effort to free the body of Skurge the Executioner from its roots, an action that nearly tore apart the fabric of reality.

===Fauna===
* Dragons are ancient creatures that are stated to live in Nastrond. These include Fafnir, Hakurel; a dragon Thor slew during one of his earliest adventures, and Níðhöggr; who feeds on the roots of Yggdrasil.
* Eagles are giant sapient versions of their Earthly counterparts. These include Gnori; king of snow eagles whom a young Thor, Sif and Balder sought for one of his feathers as part of a quest, and Lerad; an eagle that guards the magic apples of Yggdrasil. Volstagg was able to steal an apple by first beating Lerad in a drinking contest.
* Fenris Wolf; a giant wolf that is said to be the offspring of Loki and the giantess Angrboda. During Ragnarök Fenris swallowed all that remained of Asgard following the final battle.
* Geri and Freki are Odin&#x27;s pet wolves. Freki stopped an assassination attempt on Thor&#x27;s life during a time known as the Reigning when Thor assumed the throne of Asgard and ruled both Asgard and Midgard with an iron fist.
* Huginn and Muninn are Odin&#x27;s pet ravens. They guided Thor to find the means to end the Ragnarök cycle and again through Hel to find Odin.
* Midgard Serpent; an immense serpent that lives in the Sea of Space circling Midgard, ready to eat unwary sailors.
* Ratatosk; a squirrel that lives on Yggdrasil and carries messages between Lerad and Níðhöggr. As a child Thor would go to Yggdrasil to visit Rattatosk and listen to his stories.
* Sleipnir; Odin&#x27;s eight-legged steed. Thor had eight steeds Firegnaw, Mudbrute, Slaughterbit, Smokemare, Snow Harpy, Stormbringer, Swamptooth and Warhoof. During a famine on earth, some humans ate the horses over Thor&#x27;s request that they not do so. The God of Thunder took the bones back to Asgard. Using magics, he reformed them into Sleipnir.
* Toothgnasher and Toothgrinder; two mystical goats that pull Thor&#x27;s chariot.
* &quot;The War of the Realms&quot; storyline featured a race of Swamp Mammoths that live in a swamp somewhere in Asgard. Due to their appearance, there is no confirmation on if they are either covered in plants or made from plants.

<text>Henry Addison (February 1821 – 18 June 1887) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. A soldier with the 43rd Regiment of Foot, he was awarded the VC for his actions on 2 January 1859, during the Indian Mutiny.

==Details==
Born in Bardwell, Suffolk, Addison was about 37 years old, and a private in the 43rd (Monmouthshire) Regiment of Foot (later The Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry), British Army during the Indian Mutiny when the incident for which he was awarded the VC took place on 2 January 1859 near Kurrereah, India.

On 1 January 1859, 30 men of the 43rd Light Infantry commanded by Gerald Young and contingents from the 1st Madras Regiment and the Royal Artillery left the Brigade at Punneri while the remainder of the Brigade returned to Kotee. The following day after descending a hill the troops saw a village from which smoke was rising and people running from houses into the Jungle. The troops moved into the Jungle and were engaged in action with the enemy for nearly two hours; the enemy was well armed with muskets, bayonets, swords and ammunition. During the action Lieutenant John Osborne attempted to shoot his assailant with a revolver however the attacker was too fast for him. Addison intervened and in an act of great gallantry saved Osborne&#x27;s life and was severely wounded.

Addison was recommended for the VC in a dispatch from Lieutenant-Colonel F. Gottreux, &quot;commanding Field Detachment, to the Assistant Adjutant General Saugor Field Division on January 15, 1859&quot;.
His injuries were recorded later in the dispatch as follows:
His citation was recorded in the London Gazette as follows:
Addison attended Windsor Castle to receive the award of the Victoria Cross and Queen Victoria noticed that he had difficulty in observing the required protocols when retiring from the Monarch&#x27;s presence and told him to retire in his usual manner. Addison subsequently received a letter from Sir Charles Beaumont Phipps, Keeper of the Privy Purse, referring to the problems Addison had with his wooden leg, advising him that the Queen said he should order an artificial one using her name, which he duly did. She also recommended that he stayed in London until the artificial leg had been made and that it was to his satisfaction.

Gerald Young of the 43rd Light Infantry, whilst describing in his diary the 43rd&#x27;s march through Central India, during the Indian Mutiny, referred to Addison having had his leg taken off without chloroform and the splendid manner in which he underwent the operation.

Osborne, in gratitude for Addison&#x27;s selfless act of valour which saved his life, arranged for him to be paid a pension of £20 a year. Addison lived in Bardwell, Suffolk from 1859 and only left there to make his annual visit to Colonel Osborne who died on 8 October 1881.

He was also awarded an Army Long Service and Good Conduct Medal. His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Royal Green Jackets (Rifles) Museum in Winchester, England.

Addison married Charlotte Dixon in India. The only child of the marriage, a son named William, died aged 2 years old, on 8 August 1862. His wife, Charlotte Addison, who remarried after his death, died aged 69, on 30 January 1907.

Henry Addison VC died on 18 June 1887. He is buried in the churchyard of the church of St Peter &amp; St Paul in Bardwell.

In 1849, Archbishop Peter Kenrick of the Archdiocese of St. Louis recruited O&#x27;Regan to head the newly established theological seminary in Cardondelet, then a village near St. Louis, Missouri.

=== Bishop of Chicago ===
On 9 December 1853, O&#x27;Regan was appointed the third bishop of Chicago by Pope Pius IX. Feeling that he lacked the pastoral experience to run a diocese, O&#x27;Regan refused the appointment. However, when Pius IX told him to accept it, O&#x27;Regan acquiesced. He received his episcopal consecration on 25 July 1854, from Kenrick, with Bishops James Oliver Van de Velde and John Henni serving as co-consecrators, at the Cathedral of St. Louis. While still in St. Louis, O&#x27;Regan suffered a nervous illness. 

After recovering from his illness, O&#x27;Regan arrived in Chicago; he was installed as bishop on 3 September 1853. He soon began construction on a new episcopal residence, completed in 1856. O&#x27;Regan purchased property for several churches and Calvary Cemetery. 

An able administrator and strong disciplinarian, O&#x27;Regan alienated many clergy with his management style. The French-Canadian community also came into conflict with him, stating that he stole a plot of land from a parish that was planning to build a church. They also accused him of stealing priestly vestments from a parish. In return, O&#x27;Regan castigated the French-Canadian community several times in the Chicago press. A crash in the Chicago real estate market in 1857 was another stressor for O&#x27;Regan.

Unable to cope with the diocese and in declining health, O&#x27;Regan traveled to Rome in 1857 to submit his resignation as bishop of Chicago; Pius IX accepted on 25 June 1858,and named him titular bishop of Dora.

=== Death and legacy ===
O&#x27;Regan retired to London, England, where he befriended Cardinals Nicholas Wiseman and Henry Edward Manning. O&#x27;Regan died from liver disease on 13 November 1866 at age 57. His funeral mass was celebrated by Archbishop MacHale at Tuam Cathedral, and his remains were buried in Cloonfad, Ireland.

<text>Adelaide Kemble (13 February 18154 August 1879) was an English opera singer of the Victorian era, and a member of the Kemble family of actors. She was the younger sister of Fanny Kemble, the famous actress and anti-slavery activist. Her father was actor Charles Kemble, her mother Maria Theresa Kemble.

==Life==
Adelaide studied in London with John Braham and in Italy under the great soprano Giuditta Pasta. On 2 November 1841, she made her first operatic performance on the London stage in &quot;Norma&quot;.

In 1843 she married Edward John Sartoris and retired after a brief but brilliant career. They were hosts at the Belgravia home to Chopin where, in 1849, he made his London debut. This is now marked by a plaque. She wrote &quot;A Week in a French Country House&quot; (1867), a bright, humorous story, followed by other, more mediocre tales. She recorded one interesting incident at a late London concert by Pasta, whose powers had diminished badly, and she asked of fellow singer Pauline Viardot what she thought of Pasta&#x27;s voice now and got the reply:

&quot;Ah! It is a ruin, but so is Leonardo&#x27;s &quot;Last Supper&quot;.&quot;

Her son, the singer Algernon Charles Frederick Sartoris, married Nellie Grant, the daughter of the famous American general and president Ulysses S. Grant, on 21 May 1874 in the East Room of the White House. Their son, Algernon Edward Sartoris, married the granddaughter of the conductor Sir Charles Hallé.
The young Frederic Leighton (the painter of &quot;Flaming June&quot; and a president of the British Royal Academy of Art from 1878 until his death in 1895) was introduced to her circle in Rome, and was greatly influenced by her in many respects, most evidently, perhaps, in social and musical areas. Her &quot;soirees&quot; surely were an inspiration for his famous, annual &quot;Leighton Musics&quot; later in the great Victorian painter&#x27;s career, held in his home (now Leighton House and open to the public) in Kensington in London. Mrs. Sartoris and the younger artist, who shortly before his death was granted a peerage, becoming Lord Leighton, maintained a close friendship for the rest of her life.

Leighton painted several portraits of her daughter, Mary Theodosia (May) Sartoris, who married
Henry Evans-Gordon. Their daughter Margaret Evans-Gordon married Sir Arthur Stanley, 5th Baron Sheffield; their daughter Pamela Stanley (Adelaide&#x27;s great-granddaughter) was an actress noted for her film and stage portrayals of Queen Victoria.

<doc id="759097" wikidata="Q3776709" url="?curid=759097" title="Gridlock (band)">
<text>Gridlock was a San Francisco based experimental electronic band, consisting of Mike Wells and Mike Cadoo. Conceived by Wells in 1993, as &quot;heaviness through electronics&quot;, the band was initially a part of the electro-industrial scene, but the band&#x27;s sound eventually began incorporating more atmospheric textured elements, as well as elements of glitch and IDM.

==Biography==
Gridlock began as an expression of Mike Wells&#x27; desire to stray from his experience in the San Francisco thrash metal scene, and his interest in experimental music. During the production of his initial recordings under the Gridlock moniker, he met Skinlab guitarist Mike Cadoo through the Oakland heavy metal scene, who eventually joined Gridlock as a vocalist. The duo released their first two demos, &quot;Sickness&quot; and &quot;Frozen&quot;, in 1995 and 1996 respectively. During these early days, the band brought on a former bandmate, Bobby Cochran, for live percussion but his involvement ended after a short time.

American labels had difficulty pinning down the bands dissonant, noise-based sound, making it difficult to secure a contract. Eventually their demos reached Pendragon Records leading to a contract and their first release in 1997.

The band&#x27;s sound on the first demos and their debut album &quot;The Synthetic Form&quot; was originally akin to the sound of Skinny Puppy with fewer vocals and an ambient aspect not normally found in industrial at the time. At this time, Wells was the principal songwriter of the band. Starting with 1998&#x27;s &quot;Further&quot;, they took on more and more ambient and futuristic electronic sounds and slowly lessened their industrial edge whilst removing any trace of vocals; Wells described this period as &quot;the happiest memories&quot; he had with the band.

In 2000, the band released a compilation of their early demos entitled &quot;5.25&quot; which included their cover of Berlin&#x27;s &quot;The Metro (song)&quot; and additional live recordings.

With the 2000 release of &quot;Trace&quot;, the band saw a more balanced collaborative process between Cadoo and Wells, with some of their most experimental work, but the process was hindered by a house fire, that destroyed their studio.

The duo&#x27;s final album, &quot;Formless&quot;, was released on Hymen Records in 2003; in retrospective posts and interviews, both Cadoo and Wells admitted that the album represented a failure of communication between the two, exacerbated by the time and arduous effort the album took to create. Cadoo later suggested that part of the reason for this was Wells&#x27; unhappiness with the direction Cadoo wanted to take Gridlock in. Retrospectively, however, both men expressed satisfaction with the record as their best work.

The band agreed to take a break after &quot;Formless&quot; and focus on other ventures, but on March 24, 2005, Wells announced the band&#x27;s dissolution on its website; according to Cadoo, the announcement was unilateral, and the two had remained estranged since. Their last recorded material to be released was two tracks on the 2006 Hymen Records compilation &quot;Travel Sickness&quot;. 

Mike Wells passed away in January 2022.

<doc id="759102" wikidata="Q3738965" url="?curid=759102" title="Kemble family">
<text>Kemble is the name of a family of English actors, who reigned over the English stage for many decades. The most famous were Sarah Siddons (1755–1831) and her brother John Philip Kemble (1757–1823), the two eldest of the twelve children of Roger Kemble (1721–1802), a strolling player and manager of the Warwickshire Company of Comedians, who in 1753 married an actress, Sarah Ward. Roger Kemble was born in Hereford, and was a grand-nephew of Father John Kemble, a recusant Catholic priest, who was hanged in that city in 1679. Three younger children of Roger, Stephen Kemble (1758–1822), Charles Kemble (1775–1854), and Elizabeth Whitlock (1761–1836), were also actors, while Ann Hatton was a novelist.

==Popular culture==

In George Henry Harlow&#x27;s famous painting &quot;The Court for the Trial of Queen Katharine&quot; he depicted many of the Kemble family members. The subject of the painting comes from Henry VIII, Act II, Scene iv, and the refutation of Cardinal Wolsey, charged with obtaining Henry&#x27;s divorce from his Queen, Katherine. The production was mounted by John Philip Kemble when he took over the management of Covent Garden in 1806. Harlow was a personal friend of the Kemble family and this picture is homage to his friends. John Philip Kemble clothed in scarlet plays Wolsey; his brother Charles Kemble (in black) has the part of Thomas Cromwell and sits behind the table. Immediately behind and above him is Stephen Kemble as Henry. The sister, Sarah Siddons, is Katherine.

==Extended family==

The tradition was continued by two daughters of Charles Kemble and Maria Theresa Kemble: actress and Shakespearean reader Fanny Kemble (1800–1893) and Adelaide Kemble (1815–1879), an opera singer. Both Sarah Siddons&#x27;s son Henry Kemble and Stephen Kemble&#x27;s son, also named Henry Kemble, became actors.

Among later members of the Kemble family, mention may also be made of Charles Kemble&#x27;s grandson, Henry Kemble (1848–1907), a sterling and popular London actor, and of Alice Barnett, a great-granddaughter of Stephen Kemble, who performed leading roles as a comic actress and singer in the works of Gilbert and Sullivan. Two 20th century members were Violet Kemble-Cooper and Lillian Kemble-Cooper. The Scottish socialite Jane Beadon was also a descendant of the Kemble family.

<text>Alejandro José Luis Orfila (9 March 1925 – 9 June 2021) was an Argentine career diplomat, who later became a prominent winemaker in San Diego, California.

==Early career==

Orfila was born in Mendoza, Argentina to Catalan immigrants who had become moderately successful vintners in the province. He received a law degree at the University of Buenos Aires in 1945. The following year, following political science studies at Stanford University, he was assigned to the Argentine Embassy in Moscow; in 1948, however, he was expelled from the Soviet Union on the grounds of espionage. Transferred to the United States, he was appointed Argentine Consul General to San Francisco and later New York, where he remained until his father&#x27;s death in 1952 compelled him to return to the family business in Mendoza.

Offered the prestigious post of Director of Information at the recently established Organization of American States (OAS), Orfila left for Washington, D.C. in 1953. There, he forged close contacts in the U.S. capital and, after becoming Argentine Ambassador to the U.S. in 1958 and to Japan in 1960, he formed an influential K Street lobbying firm in 1962, specializing in the interests of U.S. firms investing in or trading with Latin America. In 1964 he became the political adviser to the Managing Director of the Adela Investment Company, the largest multinational development corporation for growing the Latin American economy. Close to President Juan Perón since his days in the Soviet Union, Orfila was appointed Ambassador to the United States by the populist Argentine leader, back in power in 1973 after an 18-year-long exile.

==Tenure at the OAS==

Upon the retirement of Ecuadorian statesman Galo Plaza from the post of Secretary General of the OAS on 17 May 1975, Orfila was elected to replace him. In this capacity, he moved quickly to repair the OAS&#x27;s relationship with its most important member, the United States. Inheriting an OAS closely identified with the Non-Aligned Movement, he dismissed a number of Plaza&#x27;s appointees looked upon unfavorably by U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. Preferring his own brand of &quot;gala diplomacy&quot; to confrontation, Orfila was fond of enlisting his sumptuous beltway home for diplomatic dinners in the interest of assuaging differences.

Orfila&#x27;s influence in U.S. foreign policy circles, however, remained marginal until the advent of the Administration of U.S. President Jimmy Carter in early 1977. Orfila rallied support in the OAS for Carter&#x27;s campaign pledge to renegotiate U.S. presence in the Panama Canal Zone, a contentious issue across Latin America. The Panama Canal Treaty was signed at OAS headquarters in September of that year. Taking the OAS into a more active role in Latin America&#x27;s economic development than had been the case before, Orfila facilitated the Inter-American Development Bank as a means to provide these governments an alternative to the high-interest credit markets in the world&#x27;s financial capitals, a policy that backfired somewhat after many of these nations entered a debt repayments crisis in 1981.

Supported in many circles for his long-standing anti-communist policies, Orfila nevertheless actively opposed the tide of human rights abuses in Latin America. Working with President Carter and the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights, Patricia Derian, he marshalled the then-dormant Inter-American Commission on Human Rights into investigations inside repressive regimes like his own country&#x27;s, the Argentine military junta; after looking into allegations of widespread political murders and kidnappings in September 1979, the commission&#x27;s 1980 report removed any doubts as to the state of freedoms in the country at the time, and helped lead to an improvement in the climate of civil liberties.

These moves, however, undermined Orfila&#x27;s standing in Washington after Ronald Reagan became U.S. president in early 1981, particularly among President Reagan&#x27;s foreign policy advisers such as Jeane Kirkpatrick, who, as Republican Party campaign adviser in 1980, chided the OAS investigations into atrocities by admonishing them to be more supportive of &quot;moderately repressive regimes.&quot; With violence in the region more concentrated in Central America after 1980, Orfila lost a valuable ally in his efforts to mediate the area&#x27;s civil wars when Panamanian strongman Omar Torrijos&#x27; plane exploded in August 1981.

Orfila lent the OAS&#x27; support to the establishment of the Contadora Group in hopes of alleviating the worsening wars in Nicaragua, Guatemala and El Salvador. This support, as well as that of the United Nations and a number of other international bodies, failed to compensate for President Reagan&#x27;s opposition to the initiative, however. A 1982 resolution he supported, asserting Argentina&#x27;s claims on the Falkland Islands, resulted in a policy embarrassment for the OAS after Falklands War ended in disaster. The severe economic downturn in almost the entire western hemisphere was addressed by Orfila with efforts to renegotiate Latin American debt repayments; this met with opposition in the Reagan Administration on this, as well, and on 26 October 1983, the OAS voted to condemn the U.S. invasion of Grenada, making Orfila&#x27;s policy rift with Reagan final.

Towards the end of the year, accusations of influence peddling arose against Orfila. Increasingly unable to exert credibility despite the lack of evidence for the allegations, on 21 June 1984, Secretary General Orfila resigned his post, expressing frustration over the OAS&#x27; inability to influence U.S. Latin American policy during the 1980s. He was succeeded by Brazilian Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs João Clemente Baena Soares.

==Personal life==
During his diplomatic years, he was married to his first wife, an American, Jean D&#x27;Aprile, daughter of a Rochester, New York, judge. They had four children: Alejandro, Martin, Linda and Michael. Orfila is grandfather to Martin&#x27;s four children and Linda&#x27;s two children.

In 1985, Orfila was sued by a former subordinate, Carr Donald, over allegedly having been dismissed without cause. The lawsuit failed, however, and in 1986, an appellate court upheld the ruling against Mr. Donald.

Following his resignation in 1984, Orfila retired to his estate in Argentina, focusing on building up his Argentine ranch and vineyards. Since 1994, he has owned Orfila Vineyards and Winery, an award-winning vineyard in the San Pasqual Valley, in Escondido, California. The winery claims more than 1,100 awards for its wines. According to Orfila Vineyards literature, he lived in exclusive Rancho Santa Fe, California, with his second wife, German-born Helga.

Orfila died in San Diego, California in June 2021 at the age of 96.

<text>Impressions Games was a British video game developer founded by David Lester. He sold the company to Sierra On-Line in 1995, who was then bought out by Cendant and eventually, Vivendi Universal (now known as Vivendi SA).

Impressions specialized in historical strategy games and is best known for its City Building Series, which include &quot;Caesar&quot;, &quot;Pharaoh&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;&quot;. In 1998, Impressions Games was the most profitable division of Havas Interactive, with $20 million in net profit. This surpassed Blizzard Entertainment for the period, according to CNET Gamecenter.

Mike Ryder, former president of Sierra Entertainment, forced a change in management in October 2001, during development of &quot;Lords of the Realm III&quot;. Rod Nakamoto was installed as the new director. &quot;Lords III&quot; became Impressions&#x27;s final game, and was released to mediocre reviews in March 2004.

The studio was shut down in April 2004 when Vivendi Universal closed most of their game development studios. Many members of the studio moved on to form Tilted Mill Entertainment.

Former notable employees of Impressions include Chris Beatrice and Peter Haffenreffer, co-founders of Tilted Mill Entertainment and Simon Bradbury, founder of Firefly Studios.

<text>Harold Ackroyd (18 July 1877 – 11 August 1917) was a British physician, scientific researcher, army officer and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

An officer with the Royal Army Medical Corps during the First World War, he was awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions in late July–early August 1917, during the Battle of Passchendaele.

==Early life==
Ackroyd was born on 18 July 1877 in Roe Lane, Southport, Lancashire to Ellen and Edward Ackroyd. His father was chairman of the Cheshire Lines &amp; Southport Extension Railway Company.
Ackroyd was educated locally at Mintholme College, Southport, and Shrewsbury School. Following his elder brother Edward, who had matriculated in 1893 he then entered Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge in October 1896. He completed his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1899, before he did some travelling and then spent one year in the research group of Gowland Hopkins before continuing his medical studies at Guy&#x27;s Hospital, London.
He gained his BC in 1903, MB (Bachelor of Medicine) in 1904 and his MD (Doctor of Medicine) in 1910.

== Medical career==
He worked at Guy&#x27;s Hospital in 1904–05, London before serving as the House Surgeon at Queen&#x27;s Hospital in Birmingham. He was then employed at the David Lewis Northern Hospital, Liverpool 1905–06 before in 1908 securing an &quot;Ordinary Research Scholarship&quot; from the British Medical Association, which allowed him to engage in research work at Cambridge, initially at the Strangeways Research Hospital.
By the time he renewed his research scholarship in 1910 Ackroyd was working in the Pharmacological Laboratory with Walter E. Dixon. He then began research work in association with Frederick Gowland Hopkins, with the pair co-authoring a number of research papers.

==Military service==
When the First World War began in 1914 Ackroyd was nearly 37 but, despite his age, occupation and being married with three small children, he joined up and on 15 February 1915 was commissioned a Temporary Lieutenant in the Royal Army Medical Corps (RAMC). In July 1915, Ackroyd was sent to France, where he was attached as a medical officer to the 6th Battalion of the Royal Berkshire Regiment, (Princess Charlotte of Wales&#x27;s), part of the 53rd Brigade, 18th (Eastern) Division.
After his promotion to temporary captain in 1916, he saw action at the Battle of the Somme in July 1916. On 19 July he was presented at the three days of fighting at Delville Wood which became the graveyard of the 53rd Brigade as originally constituted.
Under heavy shelling and braving snipers, Ackroyd remained cool and methodical, saving many lives. No less than 11 officers singled him out for praise in their written reports and he was recommended for the Victoria Cross. At one point, Ackroyd was blown into the air by an exploding shell.

On 19 July 1916 he was awarded the Military Cross:
Ackroyd rescued many of the wounded from the 1st South African Infantry Brigade and there is a memorial to him in the room commemorating Delville Wood at Fort Beaufort Historical Museum, South Africa.
Showing signs of immense strain and nervous exhaustion he was reluctantly, invalided home on 11 August 1916 to commence six weeks of leave.
Of the opinion that he had recovered Ackroyd by September was asking the Army Medical Board to allow him to return to his regiment in France, which he accomplished in December 1916.

===Ypres===
The 6th Battalion of the Royal Berkshire Regiment was fighting in The third battle of Ypres, known as the Battle of Passchendaele, which commenced on 31 July 1917 when the following deed took place for which he received 23 separate recommendations for the Victoria Cross, and which was subsequently awarded:

Ackroyd was subsequently killed on 11 August 1917 in Jargon Trench on the western edge of Glencorse Wood, Ypres, Belgium by a sniper. His second in command Private Albert Scriven wrote to Ackroyd&#x27;s widow describing what happened:
 “I was acting orderly corporal and on hearing the news I took a party of stretcher bearers but on arrival found he was dead. There were six other poor fellows in the same shell hole who met the same fate, it was a perfect death trap. He was visiting each company about 150 yds ahead of us to see if there were any wounded to attend to and was shot in the head by a sniper.” 

Ackroyd&#x27;s body was evacuated and buried. A headstone at Birr Cross Roads Cemetery, Zillebeke near Ypres reads &quot;Believed to be buried in this cemetery.&quot;
His Victoria Cross (number 851) was presented by King George V at Buckingham Palace to his widow Mabel and son Stephen on 26 September 1917.

==Personal life==

Ackroyd met Mabel Robina Smythe (1877–1947) matron of Strangeways Hospital, Cambridge while he was working there. They were married on 1 August 1908 and lived in Great Shelford, Cambridgeshire where their children Ursula (1909–1993) and Stephen (1912–1963) were born. They then moved to Brooklands, 46 Kneesworth Street, Royston, Hertfordshire, where Anthony (1914–1988) was born.

==Memorials==
There is a memorial to Ackroyd on the street-facing wall and inside his former house at 46 Kneesworth Street in Royston.
His name on the Royston war memorial in Melbourn Street, Royston., which was unveiled on 26 March 1922.
Ackroyd Road in Royston has been named after him.

==The medals==
His medals were purchased from his descendants in 2003 by Lord Michael Ashcroft. The proceeds from the sale were used to endow an annual medical scholarship at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, Harold Ackroyd&#x27;s alma mater. In addition, the college agreed to arrange an annual memorial lecture on a scientific subject connected with medicine. Ackroyd&#x27;s medals were subsequently put on public display at the Imperial War Museum, London.

Replicas of Ackroyd&#x27;s Victoria Cross, his Military Cross and other war medals are on display at the RAMC HQ in Millbank, London along with a painting of him winning the Victoria Cross.

<text>Alfredo Oriani (; 22 August 1852 in Faenza – 18 October 1909 in Casola Valsenio) was an Italian author, writer and social critic. He is often considered a precursor of Fascism, and in 1940 his books were placed on the &quot;Index Librorum Prohibitorum&quot; of the Catholic Church.

== Biography ==
Alfredo Oriani was born on 22 August 1852 in Faenza (Ravenna), the youngest of three children. His father Luigi Oriani, belonged to the lower landed gentry. He studied law at the Sapienza University of Rome in Rome and at the University of Naples where he received his law degree in 1872. He never practiced, however, but retired to his family&#x27;s estate to devote most of his life to his writing. Oriani spent most of his adult life writing in seclusion in his family country house. In 1876, he published his first work, &quot;Memorie inutili&quot; (1876), a collection of auto-biographical tales deeply influenced by the Scapigliatura. Oriani never married. In 1881 he fathered an illegitimate child by the family maid. An admirer of Crispi, Oriani disdained bourgeois moderatism, and pleaded for a national revival based on the same spirit of fervent patriotism as had created Italy. In 1892 he unsuccessfully ran for the Italian Parliament. In the last decade of his life he turned to the theatre, enjoying a certain success with the tragedy &quot;L&#x27;invincibile&quot; (1902). He died on 18 October 1909 in his residence in Casola Valsenio, at the age of only 57.

=== Novels ===
Oriani began his career as a novelist in the last two decades of the nineteenth century. He published his first collection of short stories, &quot;Memorie inutili&quot; (Useless Memoirs), under the pen name of Ottone di Banzole, 1876. It was followed in 1877 by &quot;Al di là&quot; (Beyond), in 1879 by &quot;Gramigna&quot; (Couchgrass, or Weed), in 1881 by &quot;No&quot;, in 1883 by &quot;Quartetto&quot;, then &quot;Sullo Scoglio e altri racconti&quot; (On the Reef and Other Tales). They are all dark, gloomy narratives, emotional, shaken by an anarchical drive of revolt against society.

A Romanticist at first, he later adhered to verismo, to which such novels as &quot;Gelosia&quot; (1894), &quot;Vortice&quot; (1899), and &quot;Olocausto&quot; (1902) belong. Many of Oriani&#x27;s dreams and ideals are found in what is usually considered his best novel, &quot;La Disfatta&quot; (1896). It is the drama of Professor De Nittis, who has spent all his life studying and then finally marries Bice, who gives him a son. De Nittis sees his son and his friends die, does not attain glory, and thinks disconsolately of the life that remains to be lived; his defeat consists in the awareness that his life is essentially empty, without echo.

=== Historical works ===
Of Oriani&#x27;s historical and critical works best remembered are &quot;Fino a Dogali&quot; (1889), &quot;La lotta politica in Italia&quot; (1892), and &quot;La rivolta ideale&quot; (1908). The first deals with Italy&#x27;s mission in Africa (Dogali was the scene of an Italian disaster in that continent). The second concerns the history of the struggle for Italian unity from the Middle Ages in relation to the history of Europe. It contains glowing pages, among them the one written for the Italian entry into Rome:

In &quot;La rivolta ideale&quot; (The Ideal Revolt) published in 1908, Oriani tried to resurrect the lost dimension of a heroic and popular Risorgimento. Oriani tended to examine the history of modern Italy by means of heroic figures, which lead Antonio Gramsci to refer to his historiographical &quot;titanism&quot;. He envisioned a new aristocracy to lead the nation and the people to fully realize their historical destiny and endorsed the need of idealism against nineteenth-century positivism. He lashed against &quot;democracy&#x27;s plebeian materialism&quot;, and wished for the arrival of a charismatic leader who could change Italy for good.

== Posthumous fame ==

Oriani only enjoyed a posthumous fame thanks to his late discovery by Benedetto Croce. &quot;La Disfatta&quot; (1896), regarded as the best of his novels, received warm praise from Croce, but the revival of interest in Oriani which came about after his death is due principally to the character of his historical and social works – like his 1892 &quot;La lotta politica in Italia&quot;. Oriani exerted a major influence on Italian politics (as well as an indirect impact on the historiography of the time), which culminated in his being labeled a precursor of Fascism. Oriani&#x27;s political thinking matured under Giuseppe Mazzini&#x27;s influence and is reflected in his political essays that were primarily responsible for his belated status with Fascism. According to Israeli historian Meir Michaelis &quot;Oriani translated Mazzini&#x27;s concept of &#x27;mission&#x27; into the language of imperialism&quot;. In &quot;Fino a Dogali&quot; (As Far as Dogali, 1889), for instance, he offered a justification of Italy&#x27;s expansion into Africa, stressing the civilizing mission of Italy in the world. &quot;La lotta politica in Italia&quot; (The political struggle in Italy, 1892) was a lively account of the causes of Italian political decadence from the fall of the Western Roman Empire to the Risorgimento, which deplored internal discord and called on the Italian nation to resume its civilizing mission in the world by building a modern colonial empire. This work is considered the prototype of modern revisionism of Risorgimento, as opposite to apologetic historiography of Savoy. Oriani put into question the outcome of the events of the Risorgimento. He criticized the &quot;royal conquest&quot; as a unilateral action to create a new state, assuming that without the support of a strong democratic movement, it would prove to be weak in its foundations.

In the cultural climate of the first decades of the twentieth century, &quot;La lotta politica in Italia&quot; seemed to offer to many intellectuals an answer to the restlessness of those times and to the expectations towards a different Italy from the Giolitti&#x27;s one. For over a decade the book was debated by all the sectors of the Italian culture: famous characters like Amendola, Prezzolini, Gentile, appreciated its passionate and polemic structure. According to the futurist writer Giovanni Papini, Oriani&#x27;s work compared favourably with those of Thomas Carlyle, Jules Michelet and Giuseppe Ferrari. Oriani&#x27;s ideas influenced the work of the radical intellectual Piero Gobetti, especially his collection of essays &quot;Risorgimento without heroes&quot; (&quot;Risorgimento senza eroi&quot;, 1926), an harsh criticism of the liberal ruling class of the post-Unitarian period. Oriani was also appreciated by leftist and anti-Fascist Antonio Gramsci, who wrote about him in his &quot;Prison Notebooks&quot;. Gramsci recognised Oriani as the &quot;most honest and impassioned&quot; advocate of &quot;Italian national-popular grandeur&quot; among the older generation of intellectuals.

Oriani&#x27;s fame quickly spread beyond Italy&#x27;s borders. Georges Sorel, who admired Oriani as a romantic novelist and profound social philosopher, dedicated to him an essay entitled &quot;La rivolta ideale&quot; (&quot;L&#x27;Indépendance&quot;, 15 April 1912). Sorel believed that Oriani combined an aesthetic intuition with philosophic insight. His work, Sorel noted, &quot;[a] été assez clairvoyant pour prévoir le désastre des scientistes et [a] contribué à maintenir la noble tradition hégélienne&quot;. (&quot;[has] been rather clairvoyant to predict the disaster of scientists and [has] contributed to maintaining the noble Hegelian tradition.&quot;) Benjamin Crémieux considered Oriani «le seul écrivain politique dont l’influence ait été en Italie vraiment vivificante».

== Influence and legacy ==
Calling for a renewal of the Italian state and a rebirth of ancient Roman imperialism it is no surprise that the nationalists should choose Oriani as their literary hero. &#x27;In Oriani&#x27;, wrote the future fascist leader Dino Grandi, &#x27;my generation found its anxieties, its feelings, its contradictions, its aspirations and its instincts confirmed, and above all explained and clarified.&#x27; Protagonists of nationalism such as Corradini and Federzoni opened the way to the future fascist interpretation of Oriani. Benito Mussolini considered Oriani one of the inspirers of Fascism for his criticism of the late 19th-century bourgeois culture. The posthumous edition of all his works was edited by Mussolini in person (1923–1933). Il Cardello, the old residence of Oriani, who is buried in the surrounding park, became a popular visiting place in Fascist Italy. Mussolini led the &#x27;Marcia al Cardello&#x27; here in 1924 and returned on numerous occasions. The most telling testimony to what the place became is the mausoleum (built in 1923–24 by Giulio Arata), on the top of which stands the writer&#x27;s tomb.

After the fall of Fascism, Oriani was on trial too. A national interest came up only for the centenary of his birth (1952) and the fiftieth anniversary of his death (1959), when the writer and his opera were set free from fascist appropriation. This operation brought a reversed reading: Oriani, especially through &quot;La lotta politica in Italia&quot; (that came out in 1956 in a valid critical edition by Alberto Maria Ghisalberti), ended up to be pointed as a «forerunner» – this time – of the Republic, and his democratic liberal opinions and his liking to Garibaldi and Mazzini were underlined.

Starting from the 1960s Oriani&#x27;s figure and historical work have never been so popular as during the previous decades, because in the meanwhile the historiographical discussion on the Risorgimento simply had been changed. That produced however, since Walter Maturi&#x27;s reassessment of the writer&#x27;s legacy, a more detached analysis of Oriani&#x27;s historical and literary work. In particular the writings published during the 1980s have been studying Oriani&#x27;s production within the cultural and political contest of his time, where he appears as a significant voice of the passage from nationalism inspired by the Risorgimento to a new and more aggressive nationalism that imposed itself at the beginning of the century.

Today, Oriani&#x27;s house – national monument – is used as a writer&#x27;s house-museum; the building is owned by the Fondazione Casa di Oriani.&quot;&quot;

<text>Barnaba Oriani (17 July 1752 – 12 November 1832) was an Italian priest, geodesist, astronomer and scientist.

==Life==

Oriani was born in Garegnano (now part of Milan), the son of a mason, and died in Milan.
After getting his elementary education in Garegnano, he went on to study at the College of San Alessandro in Milan, under the tutelage and with the support of the Order of Barnabites, which he later joined. After completing his studies in the humanities, physical and mathematical sciences, philosophy, and theology, he was ordained a priest in 1775.

When Napoleon I established the Republic of Lombardy, Oriani refused to swear an oath against the monarchy, and the new republican government modified the oath of allegiance on his behalf. He was retained in his position at the observatory and was made president of the commission appointed to regulate the new system of weights and measures.

When the republic became a Napoleonic kingdom, Oriani was awarded the Iron Crown and the Legion of Honour, was made a count and senator, and was appointed to measure the arc of the meridian between the zeniths of Rimini and Rome.

Oriani was a devoted friend of the Theatine monk Giuseppe Piazzi, the discoverer of Ceres. Oriani and Piazzi worked together for thirty-seven years, cooperating on many astronomical observations.

==Astronomy==

Given his strong interest in astronomy, Oriani was appointed on the staff of the Observatory of Brera in Milan in 1776, becoming assistant astronomer in 1778 and director in 1802. In 1778 he began publishing various in-depth dissertations on astronomical objects, the &quot;Effemeridi di Milano&quot; (Ephemerides of Milan).

A very capable astronomer, Oriani&#x27;s work began to attract considerable attention. His research in the areas of astronomic refraction, the obliquity of the ecliptic, and orbital theory were of considerable noteworthiness in themselves; but his greatest achievement was his detailed research of the planet Uranus, which had been discovered by Sir William Herschel in 1781. Oriani devoted significant time to observations of Uranus, calculating its orbital properties which he published as a booklet of tables in 1793.

After others had shown that Uranus was not on a parabolic orbit but rather in a roughly circular orbit, he calculated the orbit in 1783. In 1789, Oriani improved his calculations by accounting for the gravitational effects of Jupiter and Saturn.

In addition to his continual contributions to the &quot;Effemeridi&quot;, he published a series of memoirs on spherical trigonometry: the &quot;Memorie dell&#x27;Istituto Italiano&quot;, 1806–10, and the &quot;Istruzione suelle misure e sui pesi&quot;, 1831.

For his work in astronomy, Oriani was honoured by naming asteroid 4540 &quot;Oriani&quot;. This asteroid had been discovered at the Osservatorio San Vittore in Bologna, Italy on 6 November 1988.

==Oriani&#x27;s theorem==
In &quot;De refractionibus astronomicis&quot;, Oriani showed that astronomical refraction could be expanded as a series of odd powers of (tan Z), where Z is the observed zenith distance. Such a series had previously been derived by J. H. Lambert, who dropped all but the first term. However, Oriani investigated the higher terms, and he found that neither of the first two terms depended on the structure of the atmosphere.

The series expansion he obtained was effective at up to 85 degrees from the zenith. Unlike previous approximations, however, Oriani&#x27;s two-term expression did not depend on a hypothesis regarding atmospheric temperature or air density in relation to altitude. Thus, the effects of atmospheric curvature are only dependent upon the temperature and pressure &quot;at the location of the observer&quot;.

Oriani&#x27;s theorem explains why Cassini&#x27;s uniform-density model works well except near the horizon—the atmospheric refraction from the zenith to a zenith distance of 70° is not dependent on the details of the distribution of the gas.

<text>Manuel Ceferino Oribe y Viana (August 26, 1792 – November 12, 1857) was the 2nd Constitutional president of Uruguay and founder of Uruguay&#x27;s National Party, the oldest Uruguayan political party and considered one of the two Uruguayan &quot;traditional&quot; parties, along with the Colorado Party, which was, until the 20th century, its only political adversary.

==Biography==
Manuel Oribe was the son of Captain Francisco Oribe and María Francisca Viana, a descendant of the first governor of Montevideo, José Joaquín de Viana. At the beginning of the revolution of independence in the Rio de la Plata he enlisted in the patriot ranks as a volunteer.

His baptism of fire took place in the battle of Cerrito, on New Year&#x27;s Eve, 1812, during the Second Siege of Montevideo, a feat of arms that ended in a victory for the Patriots. He took part alongside José Gervasio Artigas&#x27; resistance against the Luso-Brazilian invasion in 1816.

In late 1817, with Montevideo already fallen into the hands of the Luso-Brazilians, Oribe moved to Buenos Aires along with his brother Ignacio and Colonel Rufino Bauza, taking with him the Freedmen Battalion and an artillery battalion.

===Rivalry with Rivera===
The historian Francisco Bauza, son of Rufino Bauza, in his &quot;Historia de la dominación española en el Uruguay&quot; (1880-1882), argued that given the almost obsessive insistence of Artigas to name his favorite, Fructuoso Rivera, as a military commander and the south of Río Negro to face the invasion, Rufino Bauza and Manuel Oribe would have come out against a situation that led to a violent exchange of words with Artigas, whose military situation was going out of hand.

The personal rivalry between Rivera and Oribe, which apparently dates from such events, the young officer decided to abandon his boss. Carlos Federico Lecor, commander of the occupying forces, offered no hindrance to the passage of eastern officials in Buenos Aires, even though he could not attract them to your cause. Rivera and his people were in the service of the invader Lusitanians.

==The first stay in Buenos Aires==
In Buenos Aires, known by the certifying of stationery at the time, since 1819, Oribe, along with other Orientals as Santiago Vazquez and residents who were equally opposed to the Brazilian Portuguese occupation and Artigas, have built a secret Masonic society, called the Society of the Eastern Knights, who waited at least until 1821, Cisplatin Congress to undertake a return to the, since then, called Cisplatina Province and begin work to reverse the situation.

Meanwhile, following the defeat of Artigas (and even before it) another section of the eastern elite had acceded to the occupants, accepting and in fact closely collaborating with the Portuguese. This is the only sector to be represented in Congress Cisplatin, 1821.

The occupation of the Banda Oriental and its transformation into &quot;Cisplatina Province&quot; by the Portuguese and Brazilian troops had resulted in additional fracture of the leading sectors, which has since lined up in two groups separated by the acceptance or rejection of that military presence:

* The group that included Montevideo-Fructuoso Rivera, pro-Portuguese, named Club of the Baron, for its proximity to the invading commander Carlos Federico Lecor (Baron de la Laguna)
* The exiles in Buenos Aires, where Oribe was located, were a proponent of reintegration into the United Provinces of Río de la Plata as soon as possible.

Those groups would eventually become the Colorado and White party.

===President of Uruguay===

He served as President of Uruguay between 1835 and 1838.

Oribe was a big supporter of Juan Manuel de Rosas in Argentina, who in turn supported him.

===A civil war, two simultaneous governments===
In 1838 he was forced to resign by Fructuoso Rivera but started a rebel army and began a long civil war which lasted until 1851.

Oribe besieged the capital Montevideo for 8 long years (period known as Great Siege of Montevideo); he presided over the &quot;Gobierno del Cerrito&quot;. At last Oribe was defeated in 1851 with help from Brazil and Argentine rebels, led by Justo José de Urquiza, who were against Rosas.

===Later life===
In 1857, Oribe and his family narrowly survived a shipwreck. For this reason he presented a golden crown as a gift to the image of the Virgin of the Thirty-Three.

==Historical and political heritage==
Oribe&#x27;s supporters became known as the Nationals or Blancos, while his opponents became the Colorados.

<text>The England men&#x27;s cricket team represents England and Wales in international cricket. Since 1997, it has been governed by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), having been previously governed by Marylebone Cricket Club (the MCC) since 1903. England, as a founding nation, is a Full Member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) with Test, One Day International (ODI) and Twenty20 International (T20I) status. Until the 1990s, Scottish and Irish players also played for England as those countries were not yet ICC members in their own right.

England and Australia were the first teams to play a Test match (15–19 March 1877), and along with South Africa, these nations formed the Imperial Cricket Conference (the predecessor to today&#x27;s International Cricket Council) on 15 June 1909. England and Australia also played the first ODI on 5 January 1971. England&#x27;s first T20I was played on 13 June 2005, once more against Australia.

, England have played 1,082 Test matches, winning 400 and losing 328 (with 355 draws). In the Test series against Australia, England play for The Ashes, one of the most famous trophies in all of sport, and they have won the urn on 32 occasions. England have also played 811 ODIs, winning 403. They have appeared in the final of the Cricket World Cup four times (1979, 1987, 1992), winning their first in 2019; they have also finished as runners-up in two ICC Champions Trophies (2004 and 2013). England have played 204 T20Is, winning 104. They won the ICC T20 World Cup in 2010 and 2022, and were runners-up in 2016.

, England are ranked fourth in Tests, seventh in ODIs and third in T20Is by the ICC.

==History==

The first recorded incidence of a team with a claim to represent England comes from 9 July 1739 when an &quot;All-England&quot; team, which consisted of 11 gentlemen from any part of England exclusive of Kent, played against &quot;the Unconquerable County&quot; of Kent and lost by a margin of &quot;very few notches&quot;. Such matches were repeated on numerous occasions for the best part of a century.

In 1846 William Clarke formed the All-England Eleven. This team eventually competed against a United All-England Eleven with annual matches occurring between 1847 and 1856. These matches were arguably the most important contest of the English season if judged by the quality of the players.

===Early tours===
The first overseas tour occurred in September 1859 with England touring North America. This team had six players from the All-England Eleven, six from the United All-England Eleven and was captained by George Parr.

With the outbreak of the American Civil War, attention turned elsewhere. English tourists visited Australia in 1861–62 with this first tour organised as a commercial venture by Messrs Spiers and Pond, restaurateurs of Melbourne. Most matches played during tours prior to 1877 were &quot;against odds&quot;, with the opposing team fielding more than 11 players to make for a more even contest. This first Australian tour was mostly against odds of at least 18/11.

The tour was so successful that Parr led a second tour in 1863–64. James Lillywhite led a subsequent England team which sailed on the P&amp;O steamship &quot;Poonah&quot; on 21 September 1876. They played a combined Australian XI, for once on even terms of 11-a-side. The match, starting on 15 March 1877 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground came to be regarded as the inaugural Test match. The combined Australian XI won this Test match by 45 runs with Charles Bannerman of Australia scoring the first Test century. At the time, the match was promoted as &quot;James Lillywhite&#x27;s XI v Combined Victoria and New South Wales&quot;. The teams played a return match on the same ground at Easter, 1877, when Lillywhite&#x27;s team avenged their loss with a victory by four wickets. The first Test match on English soil occurred in 1880 with England victorious; this was the first time England fielded a fully representative side with W. G. Grace included in the team.

===1880s===
England lost their first home series 1–0 in 1882, with &quot;The Sporting Times&quot; printing an obituary on English cricket:

As a result of this loss, the tour of 1882–83 was dubbed by England captain Ivo Bligh as &quot;the quest to regain the ashes&quot;. England, with a mixture of amateurs and professionals, won the series 2–1. Bligh was presented with an urn that contained some ashes, which have variously been said to be of a bail, ball or even a woman&#x27;s veil, and so The Ashes was born. A fourth match was then played which Australia won by four wickets. However, the match was not considered part of the Ashes series. England dominated many of these early contests, with England winning the Ashes series 10 times between 1884 and 1898. During this period England also played their first Test match against South Africa in 1889 at Port Elizabeth.

===1890s===
England won the 1890 Ashes series 2–0, with the third match of the series being the first Test match to be abandoned. England lost 2–1 in the 1891–92 series, although England regained the urn the following year. England again won the 1894–95 series, winning 3–2 under the leadership of Andrew Stoddart. In 1895–96, England played South Africa, winning all Tests in the series. The 1899 Ashes series was the first tour where the MCC and the counties appointed a selection committee. There were three active players: Grace, Lord Hawke and Warwickshire captain Herbert Bainbridge. Prior to this, England teams for home Tests had been chosen by the club on whose ground the match was to be played. England lost the 1899 Ashes series 1–0, with Grace making his final Test appearance in the first match of the series.

===1900s===

The start of the 20th century saw mixed results for England as they lost four of the eight Ashes series between 1900 and 1914. During this period, England lost their first series against South Africa in the 1905–06 season 4–1 as their batting faltered.

England lost their first series of the new century to Australia in 1901–02 Ashes. Australia also won the 1902 series, which was memorable for exciting cricket, including Gilbert Jessop scoring a Test century in just 70 minutes. England regained the Ashes in 1904 under the captaincy of Pelham Warner. R. E. Foster scored 287 on his debut and Wilfred Rhodes took 15 wickets in a match. In 1905–06, England lost 4–1 against South Africa. England avenged the defeat in 1907, when they won the series 1–0 under the captaincy of Foster. However, they lost the 1909 Ashes series against Australia, using 25 players in the process. England also lost to South Africa, with Jack Hobbs scoring his first of 15 centuries on the tour.

===1910s===
England toured Australia in 1911–12 and beat their opponents 4–1. The team included the likes of Rhodes, Hobbs, Frank Woolley and Sydney Barnes. England lost the first match of the series but bounced back and won the next four Tests. This proved to be the last Ashes series before the war.

The 1912 season saw England take part in a unique experiment. A nine-Test triangular tournament involving England, South Africa and Australia was set up. The series was hampered by a very wet summer and player disputes however and the tournament was considered a failure with the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; stating:

With Australia sending a weakened team and the South African bowlers being ineffective England dominated the tournament winning four of their six matches. The match between Australia and South Africa at Lord&#x27;s was visited by King George V, the first time a reigning monarch had watched Test cricket. England went on one more tour before the outbreak of the First World War, beating South Africa 4–0, with Barnes taking 49 wickets in the series.

===1920s===
England&#x27;s first match after the war was in the 1920–21 season against Australia. Still feeling the effects of the war England went down to a series of crushing defeats and suffered their first whitewash losing the series 5–0. Six Australians scored hundreds while Mailey spun out 36 English batsmen. Things were no better in the next few Ashes series losing the 1921 Ashes series 3–0 and the 1924–25 Ashes 4–1. England&#x27;s fortunes were to change in 1926 as they regained the Ashes and were a formidable team during this period dispatching Australia 4–1 in the 1928–29 Ashes tour.

In the same year the West Indies became the fourth nation to be granted Test status and played their first game against England. England won each of these three Tests by an innings, and a view was expressed in the press that their elevation had proved a mistake although Learie Constantine did the double on the tour. In the 1929–30 season England went on two concurrent tours with one team going to New Zealand (who were granted Test status earlier that year) and the other to the West Indies. Despite sending two separate teams England won against New Zealand 1–0 and drawn with the West Indies 1–1.

===1930s===
The 1930 Ashes series saw a young Don Bradman dominate the tour, scoring 974 runs in his seven Test innings. He scored 254 at Lord&#x27;s, 334 at Headingley and 232 at The Oval. Australia regained the Ashes winning the series 2–1. As a result of Bradman&#x27;s prolific run-scoring the England captain Douglas Jardine chose to develop the already existing leg theory into fast leg theory, or bodyline, as a tactic to stop Bradman. Fast leg theory involved bowling fast balls directly at the batsman&#x27;s body. The batsman would need to defend himself, and if he touched the ball with the bat, he risked being caught by one of a large number of fielders placed on the leg side.

Using Jardine&#x27;s fast leg theory, England won the next Ashes series 4–1, but complaints about the Bodyline tactic caused crowd disruption on the tour, and threats of diplomatic action from the Australian Cricket Board, which during the tour sent the following cable to the MCC in London:

Later, Jardine was removed from the captaincy and the Laws of Cricket changed so that no more than one fast ball aimed at the body was permitted per over, and having more than two fielders behind square leg was banned.

England&#x27;s following tour of India in the 1933–34 season was the first Test match to be staged in the subcontinent. The series was also notable for Stan Nichols and Nobby Clark bowling so many bouncers that the Indian batsman wore solar toupées instead of caps to protect themselves.

Australia won the 1934 Ashes series 2–1 and kept the urn for the following 19 years. Many of the wickets of the time were friendly to batsmen resulting in a large proportion of matches ending in high scoring draws and many batting records being set.

England drew the 1938 Ashes, meaning Australia retained the urn. England went into the final match of the series at The Oval 1–0 down, but won the final game by an innings and 579 runs. Len Hutton made the highest ever Test score by an Englishman, making 364 in England first innings to help them reach 903, their highest ever score against Australia.

The 1938–39 tour of South Africa saw another experiment with the deciding Test being a timeless Test that was played to a finish. England lead 1–0 going into the final timeless match at Durban. Despite the final Test being &#x27;timeless&#x27;, the game ended in a draw after 10 days as England had to catch the train to catch the boat home. A record 1,981 runs were scored, and the concept of timeless Tests was abandoned. England went on one final tour of the West Indies in 1939 before the Second World War, although a team for an MCC tour of India was selected more in hope than expectation of the matches being played.

===1940s===
Test cricket resumed after the war in 1946, and England won their first match back against India. However, they struggled in the 1946–47 Ashes series, losing 3–0 in Australia under Wally Hammond&#x27;s captaincy. England beat South Africa 3–0 in 1947 with Denis Compton scoring 1,187 runs in the series.

The 1947–48 series against the West Indies was another disappointment for England, with the side losing 2–0 following injuries to several key players. England suffered further humiliation against Bradman&#x27;s invincible side in the 1948 Ashes series. Hutton was controversially dropped for the third Test, and England were bowled out for just 52 at The Oval. The series proved to be Bradman&#x27;s final Ashes series.

In 1948–49, England beat South Africa 2–0 under the captaincy of George Mann. The series included a record breaking stand of 359 between Hutton and Cyril Washbrook. The decade ended with England drawing the Test series against New Zealand, with every match ending in a draw.

===1950s===

Their fortunes changed on the 1953 Ashes tour as they won the series 1–0. England did not lose a series between their 1950–51 and 1958–59 tours of Australia and secured famous victory in 1954–55 under the captaincy of Len Hutton, thanks to Frank Tyson whose 6/85 at Sydney and 7/27 at Melbourne are remembered as the fastest bowling ever seen in Australia. The 1956 series was remembered for the bowling of Jim Laker who took 46 wickets at an average of 9.62, including figures of 19/90 at Old Trafford. After drawing to South Africa, England defeated the West Indies and New Zealand comfortably.

The England team then left for Australia in the 1958–59 season with a team that had been hailed as the strongest ever to leave on an Ashes tour but lost the series 4–0 as Richie Benaud&#x27;s revitalised Australians were too strong, with England struggling with the bat throughout the series.

On 24 August 1959, England inflicted its only 5–0 whitewash over India. All out for 194 at The Oval, India lost the last test by an innings. England&#x27;s batsman Ken Barrington and Colin Cowdrey both had an excellent series with the bat, with Barrington scoring 357 runs across the series and Cowdrey scoring 344.

===1960s===
The early and middle 1960s were poor periods for English cricket. Despite England&#x27;s strength on paper, Australia held the Ashes and the West Indies dominated England in the early part of the decade. May stood down as captain in 1961 following the 1961 Ashes defeat.

Ted Dexter succeeded him as captain but England continued to suffer indifferent results. In 1961–62, they beat Pakistan, but also lost to India. The following year saw England and Australia tie the 1962–63 Ashes series 1–1, meaning Australia retained the urn. Despite beating New Zealand 3–0, England went on to lose to the West Indies, and again failed in the 1964 Ashes, losing the home series 1–0, which marked the end of Dexter&#x27;s captaincy.

However, from 1968 to 1971 they played 27 consecutive Test matches without defeat, winning 9 and drawing 18 (including the abandoned Test at Melbourne in 1970–71). The sequence began when they drew with Australia at Lord&#x27;s in the Second Test of the 1968 Ashes series and ended in 1971 when India won the Third Test at The Oval by four wickets. They played 13 Tests with only one defeat immediately beforehand and so played a total of 40 consecutive Tests with only one defeat, dating from their innings victory over the West Indies at The Oval in 1966. During this period they beat New Zealand, India, the West Indies, and Pakistan, and under Ray Illingworth&#x27;s leadership, regained The Ashes from Australia in 1970–71.

===1970s===

The 1970s, for the England team, can be largely split into three parts. Early in the decade, Illingworth&#x27;s side dominated world cricket, winning the Ashes away in 1971 and then retaining them at home in 1972. The same side beat Pakistan at home in 1971 and played by far the better cricket against India that season. However, England were largely helped by the rain to sneak the Pakistan series 1–0 but the same rain saved India twice and one England collapse saw them lose to India. This was, however, one of (if not the) strongest England team ever with the likes of Illingworth, Geoffrey Boycott, John Edrich, Basil D&#x27;Oliveira, Dennis Amiss, Alan Knott, John Snow and Derek Underwood at its core.

The mid-1970s were more turbulent. Illingworth and several others had refused to tour India in 1972–73 which led to a clamour for Illingworth&#x27;s job by the end of that summer – England had just been beaten 2–0 by a flamboyant West Indies side – with several England players well over 35. Mike Denness was the surprising choice but only lasted 18 months; his results against poor opposition were good, but England were badly exposed as ageing and lacking in good fast bowling against the 1974–75 Australians, losing that series 4–1 to lose the Ashes.

Denness was replaced in 1975 by Tony Greig. While he managed to avoid losing to Australia, his side were largely thrashed the following year by the young and very much upcoming West Indies for whom Greig&#x27;s infamous &quot;grovel&quot; remark acted as motivation. Greig&#x27;s finest hour was probably the 1976–77 win over India in India. When Greig was discovered as being instrumental in World Series Cricket, he was sacked, and replaced by Mike Brearley.

Brearley&#x27;s side showed again the hyperbole that is often spoken when one side dominates in cricket. While his side of 1977–80 contained some young players who went on to become England greats, most notably future captains Ian Botham, David Gower and Graham Gooch, their opponents were often very much weakened by the absence of their World Series players, especially in 1978, when England drew New Zealand 1–1 and Pakistan 2–0 before thrashing what was effectively Australia&#x27;s 2nd XI 5–1 in 1978–79.

===1980s===

The England team, with Brearley&#x27;s exit in 1980, was never truly settled throughout the 1980s, which will probably be remembered as a low point for the team. While some of the great players like Botham, Gooch and Gower had fine careers, the team seldom succeeded in beating good opposition throughout the decade and did not score a home Test victory (except against minnows Sri Lanka) between September 1985 and July 1990.

Botham took over the captaincy in 1980 and they put up a good fight against the West Indies, losing a five match Test series 1–0, although England were humbled in the return series. After scoring a pair in the first Test against Australia, Botham lost the captaincy due to his poor form, and was replaced by Brearley. Botham returned to form and played exceptionally in the remainder of the series, being named man of the match in the third, fourth and fifth Tests. The series became known as Botham&#x27;s Ashes as England recorded a 3–1 victory.

Keith Fletcher took over as captain in 1981, but England lost his first series in charge against India. Bob Willis took over as captain in 1982 and enjoyed victories over India and Pakistan, but lost the Ashes after Australia clinched the series 2–1. England hosted the World Cup in 1983 and reached the semi-finals, but their Test form remained poor, as they suffered defeats against New Zealand, Pakistan and the West Indies.

Gower took over as skipper in 1984 and led the team to a 2–1 victory over India. They went on to win the 1985 Ashes 3–1, although after this came a poor run of form. Defeat to the West Indies dented the team&#x27;s confidence, and they went on to lose to India 2–0. In 1986, Micky Stewart was appointed the first full-time England coach. England beat New Zealand, but there was little hope of them retaining the Ashes in 1986–87. However, despite being described as a team that &#x27;can&#x27;t bat, can&#x27;t bowl and can&#x27;t field&#x27;, they went on to win the series 2–1.

After losing consecutive series against Pakistan, England drew a three match Test series against New Zealand 0–0. They reached the final of the 1987 World Cup, but lost by seven runs against Australia. After losing 4–0 to the West Indies, England lost the Ashes to a resurgent Australia led by Allan Border. With the likes of Gooch banned following a rebel tour to South Africa, a new look England side suffered defeat again against the West Indies, although this time by a margin of 2–1.

===1990s===
If the 1980s were a low point for English Test cricket, then the 1990s were only a slight improvement. The arrival of Gooch as captain in 1990 forced a move toward more professionalism and especially fitness though it took some time for old habits to die. Creditable performances against India and New Zealand in 1990 were followed by a hard-fought draw against the 1991 West Indies and a strong performance in the 1992 Cricket World Cup in which the England team finished as runners-up for the second consecutive World Cup, but landmark losses against Australia in 1990–91 and especially Pakistan in 1992 showed England up badly in terms of bowling. So bad was England&#x27;s bowling in 1993 that Rod Marsh described England&#x27;s pace attack at one point as &quot;pie throwers&quot;. Having lost three of the first four Tests played in England in 1993, Gooch resigned to be replaced by Michael Atherton.

More selectorial problems abounded during Atherton&#x27;s reign as new chairman of selectors and coach Ray Illingworth (then into his 60s) assumed almost sole responsibility for the team off the field. The youth policy which had seen England emerge from the West Indies tour of 1993–94 with some credit (though losing to a seasoned Windies team) was abandoned and players such as Gatting and Gooch were persisted with when well into their 30s and 40s. England continued to do well at home against weaker opponents such as India, New Zealand and a West Indies side beginning to fade but struggled badly against improving sides like Pakistan and South Africa. Atherton had offered his resignation after losing the 1997 Ashes series 3–2 having been 1–0 up after two matches – eventually to resign one series later in early 1998. England, looking for talent, went through a whole raft of new players during this period, such as Ronnie Irani, Adam Hollioake, Craig White, Graeme Hick and Mark Ramprakash.

Alec Stewart took the reins as captain in 1998, but another losing Ashes series and early World Cup exit cost him Test and ODI captaincy in 1999. This should not detract from the 1998 home Test series where England showed great fortitude to beat a powerful South African side 2–1.

Another reason for their poor performances were the demands of County Cricket teams on their players, meaning that England could rarely field a full-strength team on their tours. This eventually led to the ECB taking over from the MCC as the governing body of England and the implementation of central contracts. 1992 also saw Scotland sever ties with the England and Wales team, and begin to compete as the Scotland national team.

By 1999, with coach David Lloyd resigning after the World Cup exit and new captain Nasser Hussain just appointed, England hit rock bottom (literally ranked as the lowest-rated Test nation) after losing 2–1 to New Zealand in shambolic fashion. Hussain was booed on the Oval balcony as the crowd jeered &quot;We&#x27;ve got the worst team in the world&quot; to the tune of &quot;He&#x27;s Got the Whole World in His Hands&quot;.

===2000s===

Central contracts were installed – reducing players workloads – and following the arrival of Zimbabwean coach Duncan Fletcher, England thrashed the fallen West Indies 3–1. England&#x27;s results in Asia improved that winter with series wins against both Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Hussain&#x27;s side had a far harder edge to it, avoiding the anticipated &quot;Greenwash&quot; in the 2001 Ashes series against the all-powerful Australian team. The nucleus the side was slowly coming together as players such as Hussain himself, Graham Thorpe, Darren Gough and Ashley Giles began to be regularly selected. By 2003 though, having endured another Ashes drubbing as well as another first-round exit from the World Cup, Hussain resigned as captain after one Test against South Africa.

Michael Vaughan took over, with players encouraged to express themselves. England won five consecutive Test series prior to facing Australia in the 2005 Ashes series, taking the team to second place in the ICC Test Championship table. During this period England defeated the West Indies home and away, New Zealand, and Bangladesh at home, and South Africa in South Africa. In June 2005, England played its first ever T20 international match, defeating Australia by 100 runs. Later that year, England defeated Australia 2–1 in a thrilling series to regain the Ashes for the first time in 16 years, having lost them in 1989. Following the 2005 Ashes win, the team suffered from a spate of serious injuries to key players such as Vaughan, Giles, Andrew Flintoff and Simon Jones. As a result, the team underwent an enforced period of transition. A 2–0 defeat in Pakistan was followed by two drawn away series with India and Sri Lanka.

In the home Test series victory against Pakistan in July and August 2006, several promising new players emerged. Most notable were the left-arm orthodox spin bowler Monty Panesar, the first Sikh to play Test cricket for England, and left-handed opening batsman Alastair Cook. The 2006–07 Ashes series was keenly anticipated and was expected to provide a level of competition comparable to the 2005 series. In the event, England, captained by Flintoff who was deputising for the injured Vaughan, lost all five Tests to concede the first Ashes whitewash in 86 years.

In the 2007 Cricket World Cup, England lost to most of the Test playing nations they faced, beating only the West Indies and Bangladesh, although they also avoided defeat by any of the non-Test playing nations. Even so, the unimpressive nature of most of their victories in the tournament, combined with heavy defeats by New Zealand, Australia and South Africa, left many commentators criticising the manner in which the England team approached the one-day game. Coach Duncan Fletcher resigned after eight years in the job as a result and was succeeded by former Sussex coach Peter Moores.

In 2007–08, England toured Sri Lanka and New Zealand, losing the first series 1–0 and winning the second 2–1. These series were followed up at home in May 2008 with a 2–0 home series win against New Zealand, with the results easing pressure on Moores – who was not at ease with his team, particularly star batsman Kevin Pietersen. Pietersen succeeded Vaughan as captain in June 2008, after England had been well beaten by South Africa at home. The poor relationship between the two came to a head on the 2008–09 tour to India. England lost the series 1–0 and both men resigned their positions, although Pietersen remained a member of the England team. Moores was replaced as coach by Zimbabwean Andy Flower. Against this background, England toured the West Indies under the captaincy of Andrew Strauss and, in a disappointing performance, lost the Test series 1–0.

The 2009 Ashes series featured the first Test match played in Wales, at Sophia Gardens, Cardiff. England drew the match thanks to a last-wicket stand by bowlers James Anderson and Panesar. A victory for each team followed before the series was decided at The Oval. Thanks to fine bowling by Stuart Broad and Graeme Swann and a debut century by Jonathan Trott, England regained the Ashes.

===2010s===
After a drawn Test series in South Africa, England won their first ever ICC event, the 2010 World Twenty20, with a seven-wicket win over Australia in Barbados. The following winter in the 2010–11 Ashes, they beat Australia 3–1 to retain the urn and record their first series win in Australia for 24 years. Furthermore, all three of their wins were by an innings – the first time a touring side had ever recorded three innings victories in a single Test series, Alastair Cook earning Man of the Series with 766 runs.

England struggled to match their Test form in the 2011 Cricket World Cup. Despite beating South Africa and tying with eventual winners India, England suffered shock losses to Ireland and Bangladesh before losing in the quarter-finals to Sri Lanka. However the team&#x27;s excellent form in the Test match arena continued and on 13 August 2011, they became the world&#x27;s top-ranked Test team after comfortably whitewashing India 4–0, their sixth consecutive series victory and eighth in the past nine series. However, this status only lasted a year – having lost 3–0 to Pakistan over the winter, England were beaten 2–0 by South Africa, who replaced them at the top of the rankings. It was their first home series loss since 2008, against the same opposition. This loss saw the resignation of Strauss as captain and his retirement from cricket.

Cook, who was already in charge of the ODI side, replaced Strauss and led England to a 2–1 victory in India – their first in the country since 1984–85. In doing so, he became the first captain to score centuries in his first five Tests as captain and became England&#x27;s leading century-maker with 23 centuries to his name. After finishing as runners-up in the ICC Champions Trophy, England faced Australia in back-to-back Ashes series. A 3–0 home win secured England the urn for the fourth time in five series. However, in the return series, they found themselves utterly demolished in a 5–0 defeat, their second Ashes whitewash in under a decade. Their misery was compounded by batsman Jonathan Trott leaving the tour early due to a stress-related illness and the mid-series retirement of spinner Graeme Swann. Following the tour, head coach Flower resigned his post while Pietersen was dropped indefinitely from the England team. Flower was replaced by his predecessor, Moores, but he was sacked for a second time after a string of disappointing results including failing to advance from the group stage at the 2015 World Cup.

Moores was replaced by Australian Trevor Bayliss who oversaw an upturn of form in the ODI side, including series victories against New Zealand and Pakistan. In the Test arena, England reclaimed the Ashes 3–2 in the summer of 2015 before regaining the Basil D&#x27;Oliveira Trophy in the 2015–16 winter. However, the upturn in fortune of the ODI and T20I sides coincided with steadily declining form of the Test side, especially with the bat, despite the emergence of key players Joe Root and Ben Stokes. After recording their first ever loss to Bangladesh in a Test, a 4–0 loss to India on the same tour resulted in the resignation of Cook as captain in early 2017, being replaced by Root, who was unable to reverse the decline in the fortunes of the team: in his first year as captain, the team suffered another away Ashes drubbing followed by a loss to New Zealand, embarrassingly dismissed for just 58 in the first test, although the team did recover to beat India 4–1 in 2018.
England entered the 2019 Cricket World Cup as favourites, having been ranked the number one ODI side by the ICC for over a year prior to the tournament. However, shock defeats to Pakistan and Sri Lanka during the group stage left them on the brink of elimination and needing to win their final two games against India and New Zealand to guarantee progression to the semi-finals. This was achieved, putting their campaign back on track, and an eight-wicket victory over Australia in the semi-final at Edgbaston meant England were in their first World Cup final since 1992. The final against New Zealand at Lord&#x27;s has been described as one of the greatest and most dramatic matches in the history of cricket, with some calling it the &quot;greatest ODI in history&quot;, as both the match and subsequent Super Over were tied, after England went into the final over of their innings 14 runs behind New Zealand&#x27;s total. England won by virtue of having scored more boundaries throughout the match, securing their maiden World Cup title in their fourth final appearance.

That summer&#x27;s Ashes was the last series with Bayliss as coach and the series was full of moments including the emergence of Rory Burns and Jofra Archer, but it was Stokes&#x27;s virtuosic effort in the third Test at Headingley which entered cricketing folklore: with only one wicket remaining and 76 more runs still to win, Stokes hit an unbeaten 135 to keep the series alive. England eventually drew the series 2–2.

===2020s===

Under new coach Chris Silverwood, England began the new decade well when they beat South Africa 3–1 away from home in early 2020, the first time that the England cricket team had won three Tests on a tour to South Africa since 1913–14. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was immediately felt when England were withdrawn from their tour of Sri Lanka whilst being on the field, England were able to fulfil all of their fixture obligations during this time, but the summer of 2021 would be marred by COVID interruptions: England were forced to select a second-choice XI for the ODI series against Pakistan due to a COVID-19 outbreak, and the deciding test of the 2021 Pataudi Trophy was postponed for 12 months due to a COVID-19 outbreak in the Indian camp.

After being beaten in the semi finals of the 2021 ICC Men&#x27;s T20 World Cup, the 2021–22 Ashes series could not have started worse for England when Rory Burns was bowled by Mitchell Starc on the first ball of the series. Four heavy defeats led to Silverwood&#x27;s resignation as coach and Ashley Giles&#x27;s resignation as director of cricket. England then toured the West Indies and dropped several senior players, including Burns and Dawid Malan but also their leading fast bowlers, James Anderson and Stuart Broad. That decision backfired when England could not bowl out the West Indies in the first two tests and following a loss in the deciding test, Root resigned as captain after winning just one test in his last 17.

2022 saw a period of transition in both Test and white-ball sides; under a new management structure of Rob Key as director of cricket, England hired Ben Stokes as captain and Brendon McCullum as coach of the Test side and their attacking play became known as Bazball, winning 11 of their first 13 tests, beating New Zealand, India, South Africa, Pakistan, and Ireland. The white-ball side hired Matthew Mott as coach and set the highest total in List A cricket when they scored 498–4 against The Netherlands in June. Jos Buttler succeeded Eoin Morgan as white-ball captain and won the 2022 ICC Men&#x27;s T20 World Cup, becoming the first team to hold both the 50-over and 20-over trophies concurrently. The following year saw England draw the 2023 Ashes series and crash out of the 2023 Cricket World Cup in the group stage.

==Governing body==

The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) is the governing body of English cricket and the England cricket team. The Board has been operating since 1 January 1997 and represents England on the International Cricket Council. The ECB is also responsible for the generation of income from the sale of tickets, sponsorship and broadcasting rights, primarily in relation to the England team. The ECB&#x27;s income in the 2006 calendar year was £77 million.

Prior to 1997, the Test and County Cricket Board (TCCB) was the governing body for the English team. Apart from in Test matches, when touring abroad, the England team officially played as MCC up to and including the 1976–77 tour of Australia, reflecting the time when MCC had been responsible for selecting the touring party. The last time the England touring team wore the bacon-and-egg colours of the MCC was on the 1996–97 tour of New Zealand.

===Status of Wales===

Historically, the England team represented the whole of Great Britain in international cricket, with Scottish or Welsh national teams playing sporadically and players from both countries occasionally representing England. Scotland became an independent member of the ICC in 1994, having severed links with the TCCB two years earlier.

Criticism has been made of the England and Wales Cricket Board using only the England name while utilising Welsh players such as Simon and Geraint Jones. With Welsh players pursuing international careers exclusively with an England team, there have been a number of calls for Wales to become an independent member of the ICC, or for the ECB to provide more fixtures for a Welsh national team. However, both Cricket Wales and Glamorgan County Cricket Club have continually supported the ECB, with Glamorgan arguing for the financial benefits of the Welsh county within the English structure, and Cricket Wales stating they are &quot;committed to continuing to play a major role within the ECB&quot;

The absence of a Welsh cricket team has seen a number of debates within the Welsh Senedd. In 2013 a debate saw both Conservative and Labour members lend their support to the establishment of an independent Welsh team.

In 2015, a report produced by the Welsh National Assembly&#x27;s petitions committee, reflected the passionate debate around the issue. Bethan Jenkins, Plaid Cymru&#x27;s spokesperson on heritage, culture, sport and broadcasting, and a member of the petitions committee, argued that Wales should have its own international team and withdraw from the ECB. Jenkins noted that Ireland (with a population of 6.4 million) was an ICC member with 6,000 club players whereas Wales (with 3 million) had 7,500. Jenkins said: &quot;Cricket Wales and Glamorgan CCC say the idea of a Welsh national cricket team is &#x27;an emotive subject&#x27;, of course having a national team is emotive, you only have to look at the stands during any national game to see that. To suggest this as anything other than natural is a bit of a misleading argument.&quot;

In 2017, the First Minister of Wales, Carwyn Jones called for the reintroduction of the Welsh one-day team stating: &quot;[It] is odd that we see Ireland and Scotland playing in international tournaments and not Wales.&quot;

The ECB offers a number of contracts in October each year to England players which covers both red-ball and white-ball players, considers the likelihood of players featuring in England teams across formats over the next period while recognising performances in the preceding year. Multi-year contracts have been awarded since 2023.

==Team colours==
When playing Test cricket, England&#x27;s cricket whites feature the three lions badge on the left of the shirt and the name of the sponsor Cinch on the centre. English fielders may wear a navy blue cap or white sun hat with the ECB logo in the middle. Helmets are also coloured navy blue. Before 1997 the uniform sported the TCCB lion and stumps logo on the uniforms, while the helmets, jumpers and hats had the three lions emblem. Before 1996, the caps used in test touring squads featured a crest deptcting St. George and a dragon. In April 2017, the ECB brought back the traditional cable-knit sweater for test matches.

In One day internationals the kit is a blue shirt with navy trousers, whilst the Twenty20 kit is a flame-red shirt and navy trousers. In ICC limited-overs tournaments &#x27;ENGLAND&#x27; is printed across the front. Over the years, England&#x27;s ODI kit has cycled between various shades of blue (such as a pale blue used until the mid-1990s, when it was replaced in favour of a bright blue) with the occasional all-red kit.

In limited overs cricket, England&#x27;s ODI and Twenty20 shirts feature the Cinch logo across the centre: in ICC limited-overs tournaments a modified kit design is used with the sponsor&#x27;s logo is on the sleeve. The three lions badge on the left of the shirt and the Castore logo on the right. Cinch, an online used car marketplace, replaced NatWest as England&#x27;s principal partner, in February 2021. Castore replaced New Balance as kit manufacturer in April 2022.

==Fan following==
The Barmy Army is a travel agency that provides tickets and arranges touring parties for some of its members to follow the English cricket team in the UK and overseas. The Barmy Army was at first an informal group but was later turned into a company limited by guarantee, registered in England and Wales.

The name is also applied to followers of the team who join in with match day activities in the crowd, but do not necessarily travel as part of an organised tour. Collins dictionary defines the word barmy as &quot;slightly crazy or very foolish&quot;. Known for their famous song that goes “barmy army shout it out come on england”

The group, then less organised, was given its name by the Australian media during the 1994–95 Test series in Australia, reportedly for the fans&#x27; hopeless audacity in travelling all the way to Australia in the near-certain knowledge that their team would lose, and the fact that they kept on chanting encouragement to the England team even when England were losing quite badly. It was co-founded by Paul Burnham.

==England Men&#x27;s Cricketer of the Year==
At the start of each season the ECB presents the England Men&#x27;s Cricketer of the Year award to &quot;recognise outstanding performances in all formats of international cricket over the past year&quot;, voted on by members of the cricket media.

The previous winners of this award are:
*2006/07: Andrew Flintoff
*2007/08: Ian Bell
*2008/09: Kevin Pietersen
*2009/10: Graeme Swann
*2010/11: Jonathan Trott
*2011/12: James Anderson
*2012/13: Matt Prior
*2013/14: Ian Bell
*2014/15: Joe Root
*2015/16: Joe Root

==Eligibility of players==
The England cricket team represents England and Wales. However, under ICC regulations, players can qualify to play for a country by nationality, place of birth or residence, so (as with any national sports team) some people are eligible to play for more than one team. ECB regulations state that to play for England, a player must be a British citizen, and have either been born in England or Wales, or have lived in England or Wales for three years. This has led to players who also held other nationalities becoming eligible to play for England. The qualification period for those born outside England and Wales has varied in the past, but in November 2018 the ECB announced that the period would be reduced to three years in all circumstances, in line with ICC regulations.

Of the current squad (see above), Brydon Carse was born in South Africa so had to fulfil residency requirements. In addition, Chris Jordan and Ben Stokes have British citizenship, having lived in England since their youth. Jofra Archer, though born in Barbados to a Barbadian mother, qualifies through his English father.

ICC regulations also allow cricketers who represent associate (i.e. non-Test-playing) nations to switch to a Test-playing nation, provided nationality requirements are fulfilled. In recent years, this has seen Irish internationals Ed Joyce, Boyd Rankin and Eoin Morgan switch to represent England (before Ireland were promoted to full member status in 2018), whilst Gavin Hamilton previously played for Scotland – though Joyce, Rankin and Hamilton were later able to re-qualify for and represent the countries of their birth.

<text>Tilted Mill Entertainment is a video game developer located in Winchester, Massachusetts. It was founded in 2002 by former Impressions Games lead designer and general manager Chris Beatrice, business manager Peter Haffenreffer, and designer Jeff Fiske. The studio is known for its city-building games.

The company has employed 20 staff in design, programming, creative, and administrative roles. Tilted Mill is a reference to Don Quixote (&quot;Tilting at windmills&quot;). Tilted Mill developed the fifth game of the &quot;SimCity series&quot;, titled &quot;SimCity Societies&quot; (all previous titles had been developed by Maxis). The game, however, was criticized for its lack of the traditional &quot;SimCity&quot; gaming formula.

On July 11, 2008, Tilted Mill announced the creation of their first independent game titled &quot;Hinterland&quot;. According to Tilted Mill&#x27;s website, &quot;In Hinterland, you build up and lead a small village, populated by simple townsfolk struggling to survive and prosper in the wild back country of a medieval fantasy world.&quot; The game was released on Steam on 30 September 2008. After starting the development on their next game, Medieval Mayor, the team ceased communication and no more games have been released since then, with Medieval Mayor going into hiatus.

<text>Stanislav Gross (; 30 October 1969 – 16 April 2015) was a Czech lawyer and politician who served as the prime minister of the Czech Republic and leader of the Czech Social Democratic Party from 2004 until 2005 when he resigned as a result of his financial irregularities. He previously served as minister of the Interior in cabinets of Miloš Zeman and Vladimír Špidla from 2000 to 2004. Gross was Member of the Chamber of Deputies (MP) from 1992 to 2004.

Gross died on 16 April 2015 at the age of 45 from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).

==Early political career==
Born in Prague, Gross briefly worked for Czechoslovak State Railways (ČSD) as an engine-driver trainee. After the Velvet Revolution in 1989, he became a member of the Social Democratic party and in 1992 member of the parliament. After studies in law from 1993 to 1999 he obtained an academic title, although under less than normal conditions. His thesis had a mere 33 pages.

==Minister of the Interior==
On 5 April 2000 he was named interior minister in the government of Miloš Zeman. After elections in 2002, Gross continued as interior minister and became deputy prime minister in the government of Vladimír Špidla.

During his service, several scandals in the police had leaked out: corruption among the highest officials, irregularities in business tenders and failure to solve serial murders. Gross claimed that this was due to a better ability to discover such behaviour within the police force. Gross was also criticized for installing his friends and allies as executives in state-owned companies and for misuse of secret services for political aims.

In spite of these problems, Gross was able to maintain higher popularity than other politicians (his peak came in at over 70%). His youthful, photogenic appearance, skills in dealing with media and unwillingness to get involved in controversial decisions or discussions helped.

==Prime minister==
In the 2004 European election, ČSSD lost badly and the popularity of the party was low; this led to the resignation of Špidla on 26 July. Gross was appointed prime minister on 4 August 2004 and his government was approved on 24 August.

Gross was seen by his party as the last way to regain popularity and better handle future elections. This was proved wrong; in elections for regional assemblies and Senate elections, the Social Democrats failed again.

Gross claimed he would modernise the party on lines similar to those followed by Tony Blair, but his short time in office and constant involvement with scandals did not give him any time to implement changes. His popularity started to decline, and his involvement in further allegations of nepotism, police corruption, suspicious dealings in state privatisations accelerated the decline.

==Financial irregularities==
In early 2005, Gross faced a scandal related to unclear origins of the loan to buy his flat. It was found that his wife was a business associate of a brothel owner who was later sentenced for insurance fraud to five years in prison. Criticism from the media and record public dissatisfaction grew into a government crisis. For three months, Gross tried to keep himself in power until he was forced to resign on 25 April 2005. His popularity sank to a record low, and trust in politicians among Czech people was shattered.

In September 2005 Gross stepped down from his remaining position of party leader. The reason was growing suspicion about corruption involving Gross during the sale of the chemical conglomerate Unipetrol to the Polish state-owned entreprise PKN Orlen.

Gross denied all accusations as an absurd conspiracy against him.

==Later life and death==
After leaving the world of top level politics Gross started to work for the Law Office of Eduard Bruna. Between April 2006 and January 2007 he served as the chairman of Security Commission of the Social Democrats (&quot;bezpečnostní komise&quot;). The media had occasionally speculated about his influence on decisions made within the Czech police.

In September 2007, the economics weekly Euro published information that Gross and his wife bought up to a 31% stake in the energy company Moravia Energo. The value of the stake was estimated to be worth about 300 million CZK. The journal calculated that the banks would provide at most two-thirds of the sum and the rest was thus paid by Gross. When this information was published Gross refused to provide details to the press on grounds of privacy.
By June 2008 Gross successfully sold his 31% stake for 150 million CZK, his original purchase price was 21 million CZK. The whole deal was very curious and was investigated, but it was quickly found to be a legitimate business deal according to the Czech Police.

On 18 March 2008 he failed the bar exam, but later passed it and opened a private law practice. Gross was student of the Charles University in Prague and later was awarded his law degree by the University of West Bohemia at Plzeň. In 2009 this university has been the centre of investigations into allegations of law degrees being awarded after only a few months study. Gross was mentioned during the investigation.

In early 2008 together with his wife Šárka Grossová, they purchased a $735,000 (or 11 million CZK) Hidden Bay luxury condo in Miami, Florida (review of public online county records show that the property was purchased in his wife&#x27;s name only). Gross and his wife also purchased a small 10 million CZK house in need of major renovations about 1 km from their apartment in Barrandov, Prague, Czech Republic (controversy surrounding the purchase of that apartment was one of the key factors in his stepping down from his post as prime minister and leaving politics).

Gross died on 16 April 2015 at the age of 45 from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

==In popular culture==
Gross was an inspiration for the character of corrupt prime minister Klein in the film Gangster Ka.

<doc id="759141" wikidata="Q7318223" url="?curid=759141" title="Reverse Course">
<text>The  is the name commonly given to a shift in the policies of the U.S. government and the U.S.-led Allied occupation of Japan as they sought to reform and rebuild Japan after World War II. The Reverse Course began in 1947, at a time of rising Cold War tensions. As a result of the Reverse Course, the emphasis of Occupation policy shifted from the demilitarization and democratization of Japan to economic reconstruction and remilitarization of Japan in support of U.S. Cold War objectives in Asia. This involved relaxing and in some cases even partially undoing earlier reforms the Occupation had enacted in 1945 and 1946. As a U.S. Department of State official history puts it, &quot;this &#x27;Reverse Course&#x27;… focused on strengthening, not punishing, what would become a key Cold War ally.&quot;

==Background==
Japan surrendered to the Allied Powers on August 15, 1945, and officially exchanged instruments of surrender in Tokyo Bay on September 2, by which time thousands of Allied Occupation forces had already begun landing on Japanese soil. The Occupation was commanded by American general Douglas MacArthur, whose office was designated the Supreme Command for the Allied Powers (SCAP). In the initial phase of the Occupation, from 1945 to 1946, SCAP had pursued an ambitious program of social and political reform, designed to ensure that Japan would never again be a threat to world peace. Among other reforms, SCAP worked with Japanese leaders to disband the Japanese military, purge wartime leaders from government posts, and break up the powerful zaibatsu industrial conglomerates that had supported Japan&#x27;s drive for empire in Asia. In addition, SCAP instituted a sweeping land reform that made tenant farmers the new owners of the lands they had previously rented, in a blow against a previously powerful landlord class that had supported the wartime regime, and sought to unravel the wartime Japanese police state by breaking up the national police force into small American-style police forces controlled at the local level. SCAP also sought to empower previously marginalized groups that it believed would have a moderating effect on future militarism, legalizing the Communist and Socialist parties, encouraging the formation of labor unions, and extending the right to vote to women. The crowning achievement of the first phase of the Occupation was the promulgation at SCAP&#x27;s behest in 1947 of a new Constitution of Japan. Most famously Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution explicitly disavows war as an instrument of state policy and promises that Japan will never maintain a military.

At the same time, however, Cold War tensions were already ramping up in Europe, where the Soviet occupation of Eastern European countries led Winston Churchill to give his 1946 &quot;Iron Curtain&quot; speech, as well as in Asia, where the tide was turning in favor of the Communists in the Chinese Civil War. These shifts in the geo-political environment led to a profound shift in U.S. government and Allied Occupation thinking about Japan, and rather than focusing on punishing and weakening Japan for its wartime transgressions, the focus shifted to rebuilding and strengthening Japan as a potential ally in the emerging global Cold War. Meanwhile on the Japanese domestic front, rampant inflation, continuing hunger and poverty, and the rapid expansion of leftist parties and labor unions led Occupation authorities to fear that Japan was ripe for communist exploitation or even a communist revolution and to believe that conservative and anti-communist forces in Japan needed to be strengthened.

An early sign of the shift in SCAP&#x27;s thinking came in January 1947 when MacArthur announced that he would not permit a massive, nationwide general strike that labor unions had scheduled for February 1. Thereafter, the broader shift in Occupation policies became more and more apparent.

==Reverse Course policies==

As part of the Reverse Course, thousands of conservative and nationalist wartime leaders were de-purged and allowed to reenter politics and government ministries. In the industrial sector, plans for further antitrust actions against the remains of the old zaibatsu were scrapped, and some earlier antitrust policies were partially undone. MacArthur had originally planned to break up 325 Japanese companies, but in the end only 11 companies were dissolved. In the realm of self defense, the United States began pressuring Japan to eliminate Article 9 and remilitarize. To this end, SCAP established the National Police Reserve (NPR) in 1950 and the Coastal Safety Force (CSF) in 1952. They later became the ground and maritime branches of the Japan Self Defense Forces (JSDF) in 1954, respectively. SCAP also attempted to weaken the labor unions they had recently empowered, most notably issuing an edict stripping public-sector workers of their right to go on strike.

The climax of the Reverse course came in the so-called of 1950. The victory of the communists in China in 1949 and the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950 had heightened conservative fears that communism was on the march in Asia. Against this backdrop Japanese government and business leaders, with the encouragement of SCAP, purged tens of thousands of communists, alleged communists, and other leftists from government posts, private sector jobs, and teaching positions at schools and universities.

In many ways, the Reverse Course resembled the Marshall Plan in Europe, especially in that it prioritized economic reconstruction while attempting to limit the influence of communism.

==End of the Reverse Course==

The Occupation of Japan officially came to an end with the enactment of the San Francisco Peace Treaty on April 28, 1952. This meant that the U.S.-led Occupation could no longer directly dictate policy to Japanese leaders. However, as a pre-condition of ending the Occupation, the United States required the Japanese government to agree to the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty, which allowed the United States to continue to maintain military forces on Japanese soil. This locked Japan into a newly-forged U.S.-Japan Alliance, and ensured that the United States would continue to exercise an outsized influence on Japanese government policies both foreign and domestic.

Historian Nick Kapur has argued that the Reverse Course continued even after 1952 with the covert and overt support of the United States, working in tandem with sympathetic conservative governments in Japan. In 1954, the National Police Reserve was reformulated into the Japan Self-Defense Forces, a formal military in all but name. That same year, with U.S. encouragement, a Police Law was passed which re-centralized police forces under the National Police Agency. Finally in 1955, de-purged conservative politicians, at U.S. urging and with the covert backing of the CIA, united to form the powerful Liberal Democratic Party, which has ruled Japan almost continuously since that time.

==Legacies and consequences==

The Reverse Course had far reaching consequences. In terms of global security, it paved the way for the &quot;de facto&quot; remilitarization of Japan in the form of the Japan Self-Defense Forces and laid the foundations of the U.S.-Japan alliance, ensuring that Japan would remain firmly in the American camp throughout the Cold War. In fact, a remilitarized and strengthened Japan made it the cornerstone of U.S. security policy in East Asia. In the economic realm, the incomplete suppression of the industrial conglomerates allowed them to partially reform as &quot;informal associations&quot; known as . In Japanese domestic politics, the Reverse Course significantly weakened left-wing forces and strengthened conservatives, laying the foundations for decades of conservative rule. At the same time, it did not completely destroy leftist forces that had been deliberately unleashed in the Occupation&#x27;s early stages, setting the stage for extremely contentious political struggles and labor strife in the 1950s, culminating in the massive Anpo protests and Miike Coal Mine Strike, both in 1960.

<text>Bernard van Orley (between 1487 and 1491 – 6 January 1541), also called Barend or Barent van Orley, Bernaert van Orley or Barend van Brussel, was a versatile Flemish artist and representative of Dutch and Flemish Renaissance painting, who was equally active as a designer of tapestries and, at the end of his life, stained glass. Although he never visited Italy, he belongs to the group of Italianizing Flemish painters called the Romanists, who were influenced by Italian Renaissance painting, in his case especially by Raphael.

He was born and died in Brussels and &quot;served as a sort of commissioner of the arts for the Brussels town council&quot;. He was the court artist of the Habsburg rulers. He was extremely productive, concentrating on the design of his works, and leaving their execution largely to others, in the case of painting, and entirely so, in the case of the tapestries and stained glass. This he may have learned from Raphael, whose workshop in Rome was unprecedentedly large.

Due to his reliance on workshop execution, his many surviving works vary considerably in quality. Many drawings, mostly studies for designs for tapestries and stained glass, also survive. He or his workshop would have produced full-scale cartoons for the tapestries, but these were normally lost in the course of weaving, when they were cut into strips. The prevalent subject matter of his paintings are religious scenes and portraits, and he painted only a limited number of mythological and allegorical subjects. His portraits mostly depict members of the Habsburg dynasty and were produced in multiple versions by his workshop. The subject matter of his tapestries was more varied, reflecting the normal range of that medium, from biblical cycles to allegories, battle and hunting scenes.

His father had been a tapestry designer in Brussels, and several of Bernard&#x27;s descendants were artists. A number of them were still active in the 18th century.

==Family==

His family came originally from Luxembourg, descendants from the Seigneurs d&#x27;Ourle or d&#x27;Orley.His branch of the family then moved to the Duchy of Brabant, where his father Valentin van Orley (ca. 1466 - Brussels 1532) was born as an illegitimate child. Bernard and his brother Everard (who would also become a painter) were both born in Brussels.

The painted wing panels of the sculpted Saluzzo retable are attributed to Valentin van Orley, describing the &quot;Life of St. Joseph&quot; (ca. 1510). The retable itself is Gothic in style, but these wing panels already show some characteristic of the Renaissance style (City Museum of Brussels). The panels of the &quot;Life of St. Roch&quot; in the Saint James&#x27; Church, Antwerp have been ascribed to Everard van Orley.

In 1512 Bernard van Orley married Agnes Seghers; in 1539, shortly after Agnes&#x27; death, he married Catherina Hellinckx. He had nine children. His four boys followed in the footsteps of their father and also became painters.

==Apprenticeship==
It is sometimes presumed that Bernard van Orley completed his art education in Rome in the school of Raphael, however there are no reliable sources to prove this. At that time, there were only a few painters with some renown in Brussels, such as Van Laethem and painters from the Coninxloo family. It is therefore much more likely that he was initially taught in the workshop of his father, an obscure painter whose name appears as &quot;master&quot; in the &quot;Liggere&quot; (registers) of the Guild of St. Luke of Antwerp and who had several pupils.

Bernard van Orley received his knowledge of the Renaissance style from engravings and the Raphael Cartoons for tapestries of scenes from the &quot;Acts of the Apostles&quot; that were present in Brussels between 1516 and 1520; they are now in London. They were made to be woven into tapestries for Pope Leo X by Pieter van Aalst.

==Paintings==
One of his earliest signed works dates from 1512: the &quot;Triptych of the Carpenters and Masons Corporation of Brussels&quot;, also called the &quot;Apostle Altar&quot;. The central panel is in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna, and the side panels in the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium, Brussels. It recounts the lives of two apostles Thomas and Matthew. It was originally commissioned for a chapel in the Our Blessed Lady of Zavel Church in Brussels.

In his early works he continued the traditions of Jan van Eyck, Rogier van der Weyden and their followers, but then he gradually began integrating the Italianate motifs of the Renaissance, representing figure types and the spatial relationship such as found in the works of Raphael.
Around 1514–1515, he painted &quot;The Martyrdom of Saint John the Baptist&quot;, part of an altarpiece for the Benedictine abbey church of Marchiennes, likely commissioned by its abbot, Jacques Coëne. The panel painting depicts the beheading of John the Baptist, with Salome dancing at the Feast of Herod in the background. It is now on display at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.

In 1515 he was asked to take over the commission of a triptych for the Brotherhood of the Holy Cross in a chapel in the Sint-Walburga church in Veurne. He finished and delivered it in 1522. The left panel is on display in the Royal Museum of Fine Arts of Belgium. The front shows Saint Helena meeting the pope in an architectural setting of Renaissance buildings and Italianate motifs. The back is a grisaille painting of Christ falling under the Cross. The right panel is on display in the Galleria Sabauda, Turin, showing Charlemagne receiving the relics of the Passion.

From 1515 on, he and his workshop received many orders for portraits, including from the royal family and from people connected to the court. In 1516 he painted seven portraits of Charles, who had just become King of Spain, and portraits of his brother Ferdinand, the later King of Hungary, and his four sisters (destined for the King of Denmark).

The 1516 painted copy of the Shroud of Turin, commonly attributed to Albrecht Dürer, is also sometimes attributed to Bernard van Orley. By 1517 he was recognized as a master in the Antwerp Guild of St. Luke.

On 23 May 1518 he was appointed as the official court painter to the Regent of the Netherlands Margaret of Austria, replacing Jacopo de&#x27; Barbari.
In this position, he became the head of an important workshop, making him one of the first entrepreneurial artists in Northern Europe. With this workshop he produced paintings and, especially after 1525, became a leading designer of tapestry cartoons and stained glass windows. He held this position until 1527 when he, his family and several other artists, fell into disgrace because of their Protestant sympathies. The family fled Brussels and settled in Antwerp. Five years later, he returned to Brussels when he was reinstated by the new Regent of the Netherlands, Maria of Austria. After his death in 1541, he was succeeded as court painter by his pupil Michael Coxcie.
Among his most important paintings is the &quot;Triptych of the Virtue of Patience&quot; (Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium, Brussels), also called the Job altarpiece, commissioned in 1521 by Margaret of Austria to illustrate a poem she wrote about the virtue of patience. The interior panels represent the trials of Job, while the outer panels recount the parable of Lazarus and Dives (instead of the usual grisaille paintings of saints). This triptych is completely by the hand of Bernard van Orley. He must have been especially proud of his work as he signed it twice and added his coat of arms as well as his monogram BVO and the motto &#x27;ELX SYNE TYT&#x27; (&quot;each his own time&quot;). This relates to his artistic opinion that an artist should be a man fully integrated in his time.
The same museum houses another triptych by the same painter: &quot;The Haneton Triptych&quot;. This triptych was commissioned by Philippe Haneton, first secretary in the Secret Counsel of Charles V. The middle panel depicts a poignant pietà against an archaic golden background, painted in a very personal style with influences of the Flemish Primitives and Albrecht Dürer. Bernard van Orley was, together with Jan Gossaert, among the first to introduce strong musculature in Flemish paintings. The left panel shows Philippe Haneton and his sons, and the right panel his wife and her daughters.

The triptych &quot;The Last Judgment&quot; (Koninklijk Museum voor Schone Kunsten Antwerpen), was commissioned by the almoners of the Cathedral of Our Lady, Antwerp in 1525, is one of his best works in its originality and mastery. The paintings in grisaille on the back were executed by Peter de Kempeneer, who was, at that time, an apprentice in the van Orley&#x27;s workshop.

The &quot;Altarpiece of Calvary&quot; in the Onze-Lieve-Vrouwekerk in Bruges, dates from 1534. It was commissioned by Margaret of Austria originally for the funeral monument in the church of Brou in Bourg-en-Bresse in Burgundy. The side panels were finished much later by Marcus Gerards the Elder and brought to Bruges by Margaret of Parma, regent of the Netherlands under king Philip II of Spain. The central part represent the Calvary, the left panel the Crown of Thorns, the Scourging of Christ and Christ carrying the Cross. The right panel depicts the Pietà and the Limbo of the Just.
His portraits were more subdued and thoughtful, such as his portraits of Charles V and Margaret of Austria. He usually represents his subjects in a seated static position, their expressionless faces without much psychological depth or feelings. His workshop produced several copies of these portraits, especially the portraits of Charles V and of Margaret of Austria. They were offered as gift to visitors or courtiers.

He usually represented saints in a full-length portrait, such as his &quot;Mary with Child and John the Baptist&quot; (Museo del Prado, Madrid), with a background of an open colonnade, a baldachin or a set of trees. This type of composition can be found in many 16th-century paintings.

Bernard van Orley often signed his paintings, especially in his early period before 1521, with the coat of arms of the Seigneurs d&#x27;Orley: argent two pallets gules. It had been contended that these are the signature of his father Valentin.

When Albrecht Dürer visited the Netherlands in 1520 to be present at the coronation of the new emperor, Charles V, he called Bernard van Orley &quot;the Raphael of the Netherlands&quot;. Dürer, who stayed as a guest in van Orley&#x27;s house between 27 August and 2 September 1520, also drew a portrait which some scholars identify as van Orley. Dürer had a profound influence on van Orley who in his later works tried to find a synthesis between Dürer and another Renaissance master, Raphael.

Some important pupils of van Orley were Michael Coxcie, Pieter Coecke van Aelst and Pieter de Kempeneer, who continued in the style of Romanism. Other pupils, such as Lancelot Blondeel and Jan Vermeyen continued in the painter-designer tradition of their master.

Together with Jan Gossaert and Quentin Matsys, Bernard van Orley is regarded as one of the leading innovators of the 16th-century Flemish painting, by adopting the style and manner of the Italian Renaissance. His paintings are executed with great care to minute details and stand out by their brilliant colours.

==Tapestries==

During this period, tapestries were held in higher esteem than paintings, and were more expensive, often woven with gold and silver thread. They had additional value as decoration and insulation for the large, bare and cold walls of palaces and church choirs.

Bernard van Orley had already started designing tapestries in his youth, but after 1530 he seemed to have stopped painting altogether, applying himself solely to cartoons for tapestries and designs for stained-glass windows.

One of the first tapestry cartoons ascribed to him were the four cartoons for the &quot;Legend of Our-Lady-on-the-Zavel (Legend of Notre-Dame on the Sablon)&quot; (1516–1518), commissioned by Frans van Taxis. One of them represents the patron and two emperors, Maximilian I and his father Frederick III. This is an allusion to the postal contract obtained by Frans von Taxis, giving him a monopoly for the postal system between Brussels and the rest of the empire. The style of these tapestries is traditional with an overcrowded composition set in a two-dimensional plane.

From the 1520s on, under the influence of the Raphael tapestries woven at Brussels for Pope Leo X, van Orley&#x27;s tapestries began to increasingly resemble paintings, more in line with the aesthetics of the Renaissance, as can be seen in his &quot;Passion&quot; series - one set in the Royal Palace of Madrid and the other set dispersed over several museums - and the &quot;Lamentation&quot; in the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C. These tapestries, some woven by Pieter de Pannemaeker, clearly show the influence of the tapestry cartoons of Raphael and the work of Dürer in the rendering of the figure types. Since Dürer had been a guest in the house of van Orley at the time the contracts for these tapestries were signed, it is possible that the two artists may have discussed the design. For the first time in &quot;Passion&quot; tapestries, the figures received dramatic weight through their large size and their position in the foreground.

==Later life==
Van Orley became a member of the Brotherhood of St. Sebastian in the church of St. Gaugericus. More than half of the members of this brotherhood were weavers by profession.

In his later years (1521–1530) he made the twelve small cartoons (also called by their French name &quot;petits patrons&quot;), perhaps with the help of Jan Geethels, for his best-known tapestry series, &quot;The Hunts of Maximilian&quot; (Louvre, Paris). Each of the twelve tapestries represented a different month of the year. They were commissioned by emperor Charles V or someone at the imperial court. It took two years and sixty weavers to realize them. These hunts took place in the vicinity of Brussels or in the Sonian Forest. In the cartoons the rigidity of the composition makes way to a greater dynamism. He displayed his talent for depicting large-scale scenes of imaginary hunts within a realistic, picturesque, and minutely detailed landscape. For this project, van Orley sought the help of specialists in hunting and consulted the &quot;Livre de Chasse&quot; (&quot;Hunting Manual&quot;) by Gaston Phoebus. With those cartoons he, and also Johannes Stradanus, set an example for their followers by opening up new paths in Italianism with their classic breadth and ease in transforming the rendering of landscapes, successfully integrating it into Netherlandish traditional modes. This dynamism would reach its peak in the Baroque style and the work of Peter Paul Rubens. The iconography of hunting parties would be greatly imitated by the tapestry workshops of the Leyniers family - especially Everaert Leyniers (1597–1680) - the leading dyers and weavers in Brussels for over four hundred years.

Another famous set of tapestries were commissioned by Henry III of Nassau-Breda at about 1528–1530. They were to glorify the ancestors of the House of Nassau. The tapestries were lost in a fire in 1760, but the cartoons still exist and are in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum (New York). These tapestries were among the first to unite equestrian portraiture with more informal group portraiture.

The &quot;Battle of Pavia&quot; is another set of seven tapestries on display in the Museo di Capodimonte (Naples, Italy), while the seven small cartoons are owned by the Louvre, Paris. In these tapestries, Bernard van Orley created a detailed historical authenticity on a grand scale, with life-size figures within imagined surroundings.

The tapestry &quot;Hercules carrying the Heavenly Spheres&quot; was commissioned by king John II of Portugal in 1530 and can be seen in the Royal Palace of Madrid. The armillary was a symbol of the king of Portugal.

==Stained glass==

At the end of his life he also started designing stained-glass windows. The windows in the north transept of the St. Michael and Gudula Cathedral in Brussels depict members of the House of Habsburg (Charles V and his wife Isabella of Portugal), Charlemagne and Elisabeth of Hungary, and scenes from the &quot;Legend of the Miraculous Host&quot;, while the windows in the south transept depict Louis II of Hungary and Bohemia and his wife Maria of Austria, sister of Charles V, kneeling in front of a vertical Trinity with St Louis and the Virgin with Child. These windows mark a change in style. The royal dynasty was still embedded within a religious framework, but the donor was now emphasized and not the venerated saint. It was also no longer deemed necessary to legitimize the position of the sovereign by a genealogical tree, as Philip the Handsome, the father of Charles V, was not represented. These windows can be ascribed with certainty to drawings by Bernard van Orley. They were executed by the master glass-worker Jean Haeck.

He also designed the stained-glass windows for the St Rumbolds Cathedral, Malines depicting Margaret of Austria, her third husband Philibert II, Duke of Savoy, and Christ entering Jerusalem. These windows were destroyed during the religious conflicts between 1566 and 1585. In 2004 an unpublished colored drawing of these windows was discovered in Valenciennes

The Sint-Bavokerk in Haarlem, Holland, also has a set of stained-glass windows designed by van Orley, depicting the donor Joris van Egmont, bishop of Utrecht and his patron saint Martin.

<text>The Eel River (Wiyot: &quot;Wiya&#x27;t&quot;; Cahto: &quot;Taanchow&quot;; Northern Pomo: &quot;ch&#x27;idiyu&quot;) is a major river, about long, in northwestern California. The river and its tributaries form the third-largest watershed entirely in California, draining a rugged area of in five counties. The river flows generally northward through the Coast Ranges west of the Sacramento Valley, emptying into the Pacific Ocean about downstream from Fortuna and just south of Humboldt Bay. The river provides groundwater recharge, recreation, and industrial, agricultural and municipal water supply.

The Eel River system is among the most dynamic in California because of the region&#x27;s unstable geology and the influence of major Pacific storms. The discharge is highly variable; average flows in January and February are over 100 times greater than in August and September. The river also carries the highest suspended sediment load of any river of its size in the United States, in part due to the frequent landslides in the region. However, the river basin also supports abundant forests – including some of the world&#x27;s largest trees in &quot;Sequoia sempervirens&quot; (Coastal redwood) groves–and, historically, one of California&#x27;s major salmon and steelhead trout runs.

The river basin was lightly populated by Native Americans before, and for decades after, the European settlement of California. The region remained little traveled until 1849, when Josiah Gregg and his exploring party arrived in search of land for settlement. The river was named after they traded a frying pan to a group of Wiyot fishermen in exchange for a large number of Pacific lampreys, which the explorers mistook for eels. Explorers&#x27; reports of the fertile and heavily timbered region attracted settlers to Humboldt Bay and the Eel River Valley beginning in 1850. Starting in the late 19th century the Eel River supported a large salmon-canning industry which began to decline by the 1920s due to overfishing. The Eel River basin has also been a significant source of timber since the days of early settlement, and continues to support a major logging sector. The river valley was a major rail transport corridor for the Northwestern Pacific Railroad beginning in 1914 and continuing throughout the 20th century, and also forms part of the route of the Redwood Highway (US Highway 101).

Since the early 20th century, the Eel River has been dammed in its headwaters to provide water, via interbasin transfer, to parts of Mendocino and Sonoma Counties. During the 1950s and 1960s, there was great interest in building much larger dams in the Eel River system, in order to provide water for the State Water Project. Although the damming would have relieved pressure on greater California&#x27;s overburdened water systems, it stirred up decades of controversy, as some of the proposals made little economic sense and would have been detrimental to an ailing salmon run. The Eel was granted federal Wild and Scenic River status in 1981, formally making it off-limits to new dams. Nevertheless, logging, grazing, road-building, a burgeoning cannabis industry, and other human activities continue to significantly affect the watershed&#x27;s ecology.

==Course==
The Eel River originates on the southern flank of Bald Mountain, in the Upper Lake Ranger District of the Mendocino National Forest in Mendocino County. The river flows south through a narrow canyon in Lake County before entering Lake Pillsbury, the reservoir created by Scott Dam. Below the dam the river flows west, re-entering Mendocino County. At the small Cape Horn Dam about east of Willits, water is diverted from the Eel River basin through a tunnel to the East Fork Russian River, in a scheme known as the Potter Valley Project.

Below the dam the river turns north, flowing through a long, isolated valley, receiving Outlet Creek from the west and then the Middle Fork Eel River from the east at Dos Rios. About downstream, the North Fork Eel River–draining one of the most rugged and remote portions of the watershed–joins from the east. Between the North and Middle Forks the Round Valley Indian Reservation lies east of the Eel River. After this confluence the Eel flows briefly through southwestern Trinity County, past Island Mountain, before entering Humboldt County near Alderpoint.

The river cuts in a northwesterly direction across Humboldt County, past a number of small mountain communities including Fort Seward. The South Fork Eel River joins from the west, near Humboldt Redwoods State Park and the town of Weott. Below the South Fork the Eel flows through a wider agricultural valley, past Scotia and Rio Dell, before receiving the Van Duzen River from the east. At Fortuna, the river turns west across the coastal plain and enters the Pacific via a large estuary in central Humboldt County, about south of Eureka.

The Northwestern Pacific Railroad tracks follow the Eel River from Outlet Creek, about above Dos Rios, to Fortuna. The railroad has been out of service since 1998 due to concerns involving historically exorbitant maintenance costs versus the line&#x27;s economic returns. U.S. Route 101 runs along the South Fork Eel River and then the lower Eel River below the South Fork.

===Discharge===
Average flow of the Eel River varies widely due to its location, which places it more or less directly in the path of Pineapple Express-type winter storms. In the Mediterranean climate of its basin, almost all precipitation falls in the winter, and wet-season flows can be enormous, while the summer and early autumn provide only minimal precipitation, if any, causing the sometimes-mighty river to slow to a trickle. At its mouth, the Eel River produces an estimated annual runoff of per year, or about . The Eel&#x27;s maximum recorded flow of on December 23, 1964, was the largest peak discharge of any California river in recorded history, and one of the largest peaks recorded in the world relative to the size of its drainage basin. In contrast, during the dry months of July through September, the river achieves nearly zero flow.

The lowermost United States Geological Survey (USGS) stream gauge on the Eel where flow volume is measured is at Scotia, where an annual mean of , or per year, was recorded between 1910 and 2012. This station measures runoff from an area of , or 85 percent of the basin; however it does not include the flow of the Van Duzen River, which joins several miles downstream. Monthly average flows at Scotia range from in January to in September – a 143:1 difference. The annual means also experience huge variations, with a high of , or , in 1983, and a low of , or , in 1977.

Reduction in flow occurs in part due to deliberate water diversion from the Eel to the Russian River watershed by the Pacific Gas and Electric Company&#x27;s Potter Valley Project, located to the south in Mendocino County. Although the effect on the total annual flow is negligible (only about 3 percent of the total flow of the Eel River) the impact is much larger during the dry season, when the Eel&#x27;s already-low natural flows are further reduced by diversions. Since 2004 the dams used by the project have been required to provide additional flow to the Eel River during the dry season, primarily to mitigate the negative impacts the project has on fish populations.

==Watershed==

The Eel River drains an area of , the third-largest watershed entirely in California, after those of the San Joaquin River and the Salinas River. The Colorado, Sacramento, and Klamath River systems are larger, but their drainage areas extend into neighboring states as well. The Eel River system extends into five California counties: Glenn, Humboldt, Lake, Mendocino, and Trinity. The main stem traverses four counties, excepting Glenn. The majority of the watershed is located within Mendocino and Humboldt Counties.

The Eel&#x27;s major tributaries–the North Fork, Middle Fork, South Fork and Van Duzen Rivers, drain , , , and , respectively. The Middle Fork drains the greatest area of all the tributaries, but the South Fork is longer, and carries the most water because of the higher rainfall in its basin.

The Eel River watershed is located entirely in the California Coast Ranges. The topography creates a general drainage pattern that runs from southeast to northwest, except in the Middle Fork basin and the Eel headwaters, where water flows from east to west. The watershed is bordered on the north by the basin of the Mad River, on the east by that of the Sacramento River, on the west by that of the Mattole River, and on the south by those of the Russian River and Ten Mile River. Major centers of population on the river include Willits, Garberville, Redway, Scotia, Rio Dell, Fortuna, and Ferndale. Minor communities include Laytonville, Branscomb, Cummings, Leggett, Piercey, Benbow, Phillipsville, Myers Flat, Shively, and Pepperwood. The river&#x27;s relatively large estuary and delta, which includes the Salt River tributary and related creeks, is located just one low ridge south from Humboldt Bay and south of Eureka, the main city in the region.

Since the mid-19th century, logging activity in the watershed has loosened soil and destabilized aquifers, reducing the river&#x27;s base flow, although the watershed is slowly recovering. Logging, grazing and other resource exploitation activities and their accompanying environmental changes have also increased the intensity of flood and drought. Prior to 2011, the Eel River basin consisted of 65.1% forest, 12.2% shrubland, and 19.2% grassland, with just 1.9% agricultural and 0.2% developed urban. The human population of the watershed is about 32,000–less than 10 people per square mile (26/km2).

In the 20th century, much of the watershed area was included under state parks and national forest, including Six Rivers National Forest, Yolla Bolly-Middle Eel Wilderness, and Humboldt Redwoods State Park. A total of of the Eel River and its major tributaries are protected under the National Wild and Scenic Rivers system, with classed as wild, as scenic, and as recreational. About of the main stem are designated, from the mouth to a point just below Cape Horn Dam. The Middle Fork is also wild and scenic from its confluence with the Eel to the boundary of the Yolla Bolly–Middle Eel Wilderness. The South Fork is designated from its mouth to the Section Four Creek confluence, the North Fork from its mouth to Old Gilman Ranch, and the Van Duzen River from its mouth to Dinsmore Bridge.

==Geology==
Most of the Eel River watershed is underlain by sedimentary rock of the Franciscan Assemblage (or Complex), whose rocks date to the Late Jurassic (161–146 million years ago). The Franciscan is part of a terrane, or crustal fragment, that originated at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean. Beginning several million years ago, tectonic forces shoved the Franciscan assemblage against the North American Plate, pushing up the Coast Ranges. The Eel River basin is among the most seismically active areas in California, especially in the north (the river empties into the Pacific only several miles north of Cape Mendocino near the Mendocino triple junction, which marks the northern end of the San Andreas Fault and produces frequent earthquakes due to the juncture of three tectonic plates). In the western and northern portions of the Eel River watershed, soils eroded from the Franciscan assemblage are often sticky, clayey and highly unstable, creating a high risk of landslides. This soil is often known as &quot;blue goo&quot; because of its gray-blue color, soft, sticky texture, and its tendency to slip when saturated. Further inland and south, soils are well drained, although landslides are nevertheless common because of the high rainfall and steep slopes.

Because of the mountainous topography, the only flat land in the Eel River watershed is along the larger river valleys, where stream terraces have been formed, and in the estuary region near the mouth of the river. Terraces were formed due to a combination of the high sediment load of the river system, and the rapid regional rate of geologic uplift (up to per 1000 years, as measured at Scotia Bluffs). The Eel&#x27;s behavior of downcutting its own sediments has caused it to flow in a deeply incised channel, which can generally contain all but the largest floods. The younger mountains in the north may be uplifting at a rate ten times faster than the headwater regions further south and east, which consist of much older rock.

The Eel River has the highest per-unit-area sediment yield of any river of comparable watershed size in the continental U.S., excluding those fed by active glacial or volcanic sources. The estimated annual sediment load is 16 million short tons, or an average of 4,458 tons per square mile (1,720 tons/km2). Flooding events have a large effect on the average amount of transported sediment: high water in the years 1969, 1983 and 1998 caused an annual sediment load 27 times greater than that of normal years. Among rivers of the contiguous United States, only the Mississippi River carries more sediment to the sea (the Colorado River historically transported more than the Eel as well, but most of its sediment is now trapped by dams). However, both the Mississippi and Colorado have lesser sediment yields relative to their drainage areas.

==History==

===Native Americans===
The Eel River basin has been inhabited by humans for thousands of years; some of the oldest concrete evidence of human habitation is at a petroglyph site near the upper Eel River discovered in 1913, which may be as old as 2500 years. When the first European colonizers arrived, the area was home to several indigenous peoples of the Eel River Athapaskan group, with at least four groups identified by dialects: Nongatl and Sinkyone in the north, and Lassik and Wailaki in the middle and south parts of the basin. The upper valley was home to the Interior Yuki (the Huchnom), with the river and its tributaries frequented by Northern and Northeastern Pomo fishing groups.

===European arrival===
The first westerner to enter the Eel River was Sebastián Vizcaíno, sailing on behalf of Philip III of Spain, seeking a mythical northwest passage described in secret papers as being at the latitude of Cape Mendocino. Vizcaíno sailed into the mouth of the Eel in January 1603 where instead of the cultured city of Quivera the papers had described, the men encountered native people they described as &quot;uncultured.&quot;

===Settlement in the 19th century===
The Eel River was named in 1849 at the dawn of the California Gold Rush by an exploring party led by Josiah Gregg. Except for Gregg, who was a physician, naturalist and explorer, the remainder of the party were miners from a temporary camp on the Trinity River at Helena. The party took months to travel overland by an extremely arduous route from Helena to the Pacific Ocean between November and December 1849, when they are credited with the rediscovery of Humboldt Bay by land. The bay had been seen by earlier Spanish and Russian explorers but never settled. After camping and restocking at Humboldt Bay, they traveled to San Francisco to report their discovery. They crossed the Eel River on their way south where they traded a broken frying pan to the local fishermen in exchange for a large number of Pacific lamprey, which they mistook for eels. They named the Van Duzen River after James Van Duzen, a member of the expedition. The party split in two and the survivors returned to San Francisco from whence ships left to settle Humboldt Bay in early 1850, bringing lumber and supplies from San Francisco. One ship sailed up the Eel River and became trapped. In the hurry to be first into Humboldt Bay, they dragged a longboat through the sloughs on the north side of the Eel River&#x27;s mouth to the waters of the bay, where they were met by members of the &quot;Laura Virginia&quot; party.

Many of the people who settled in this region were prospectors from the Gold Rush who did not manage to find gold. Although most of the early settlements were made along the coast, some people spread south into the Eel River valley, which offered fertile soils along with other abundant natural resources. However, the settlers also faced conflict as they pushed deeper into Native American lands. American negotiator Colonel Reddick McKee&#x27;s treaty would have given the Indians a large reservation around the mouth of the Eel, but the treaties were never ratified. American settlements were made along the flat terraces of the Eel, near the confluence with the Van Duzen River and toward the mouth of the river where there was more arable land than the steep upper canyons. Most of these areas were appropriated for agriculture and grazing land. Salmon canneries flourished on the lower Eel between the 1870s and the 1920s, and declined thereafter because of decreasing runs caused by overfishing and other manmade environmental changes. Logging companies also took hundreds of millions of board feet of timber from the basin, which were floated down the Eel River to the estuary. Because the Eel River&#x27;s twists and turns made it difficult to float the large redwood logs, the timber was cut into smaller rectangular &quot;cants&quot; to make them more manageable. In 1884 the Eel River and Eureka Railroad began shipping lumber from the Eel River estuary to the port at Humboldt Bay, where the logs were loaded onto ships bound for San Francisco.

As part of the Potter Valley or Eel River Project, a pair of dams were built across the upper reaches of the Eel beginning in 1906 to divert water to the more populous but smaller Russian River drainage area to the south, resulting in a much higher flow in the smaller river and a decreased flow in the upper Eel during certain seasons. Although located near the headwaters, these dams can cause a significant reduction of the flow of the lower Eel River because much of the river&#x27;s summer flow originates from the mountains above Lake Pillsbury.

In 1910 noted American engineer John B. Leonard designed Fernbridge, a all-concrete arched bridge at the site of the earlier Singley&#x27;s Ferry crossing. Completed in 1911, and now listed on the National Historic Register, Fernbridge is the last major crossing before the Eel arrives at the Pacific Ocean. The last crossing before the Pacific Ocean is at Cock Robin Island Road a few miles to the west of Fernbridge. Later, the Pacific Coast Highway would be constructed along the South Fork and along the Eel River downriver of the South Fork.

In 1914, after seven years of construction, the Northwestern Pacific Railroad completed a rail line running along much of the Eel River as an important transportation link connecting Eureka and the many small towns along the Eel River valley to the national rail network. The railroad had the ignominious distinction of being the most expensive (per mile) ever built at the time: it traversed some of the most rugged and unstable topography in California, with 30 tunnels in a stretch. The ceremonial driving of the golden spike at Cain Rock was delayed by flooding and subsequent landslide damage to the rail line in October 1914.

In the 1950s, interest grew in damming the Eel River system to provide water for central and southern California. After a damaging flood in 1955, these dams also received support for potential flood-control benefits. The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers proposed a series of dams on the river and its tributaries, the largest of which was the enormous Dos Rios Dam near the confluence with the Middle Fork, which would provide water for the California State Water Project and control flooding. Water would be diverted through a tunnel to the Sacramento Valley, where it would join the water flowing down the Sacramento River to the California Aqueduct pumps in the Sacramento–San Joaquin River Delta. The proposal was defeated with public initiative by the early 1970s, to protect the remaining relatively wild rivers in the state. Ronald Reagan, governor of California at the time, refused to approve the project. The proposed reservoir would have flooded the Round Valley Indian Reservation.

In 1964, a severe Pineapple Express event known as &quot;The &#x27;64 Flood&quot; brought heavy rains to coastal northern California. The Eel River drainage area was directly in the storm&#x27;s path. With no major dams to control its flow, the main Eel reached a peak of , with from the South Fork alone. Ten towns were obliterated with dozens of others damaged; at least 20 bridges were destroyed, and some were never rebuilt. The heavy damage was due not only to the water, but to the huge amount of sediment and debris swept down the river, including millions of board feet of timber. The deepest flood waters were nearly above the normal river level. Several thousand people were left homeless by the floods and over 4,000 head of livestock died. 

The large storms of the mid-20th century, along with the ecological changes from logging and grazing activities, almost wiped out the river&#x27;s salmon run. Due to huge earth-flows caused by the record rain in 1964, 105 million tons of sediment were carried down the Eel River between December 21–23 as measured at Scotia–more than in the previous eight years combined. This sediment scoured away or buried spawning grounds for salmon and steelhead trout, causing the populations of these fish to drop to dangerous levels by the mid-1970s.

The flooding was also deleterious to rail service through the Eel River canyon. After the 1964 flood, much of the topography in the Eel River drainage has been permanently transfigured, and landslides occur more often, frequently damaging local road and rail infrastructure. In 1998, after another large flood in the winter of 1996–1997 washed out sections of the line, the Northwestern Pacific became the first railroad to be shut down by the federal government for safety reasons. Although the portion south of Willits was reopened in 2006, the section between Willits and Samoa, which includes the entire Eel River portion of the tracks, is unlikely to ever be returned to service.

==Ecology==
===Plants===
The Eel River watershed lies within the Oregon and Northern California Coastal freshwater ecoregion, which is characterized by temperate coniferous forests consisting largely of Douglas fir and western hemlock. The watershed also contains many stands of Redwood that are among the largest such trees in California. In the Eel River basin, redwoods can be found further inland than other parts of the northern California coast because of the wide lower valley of the river, which acts as a funnel conducting moist air eastward from the coast. However, redwood groves are still most common in the drainage area of the South Fork Eel River, which lies closest to the Pacific.

===Animals===
Aquatic mammals include beaver, muskrat, raccoon, river otter and mink. Beavers are confirmed in Outlet Creek (tributary to main stem Eel north of Willits), but may occur in other areas as well. That beaver were once native to the Eel River watershed is supported by the name of a tributary of the Middle Fork Eel River, Beaver Creek. Cyanobacteria grow in the river, and are suspected as the cause of death in fourteen dogs in the Eel River, Van Duzen River, or Big Lagoon between 2004 and 2024.

===Salmon and steelhead===
The Eel River supports runs of multiple anadromous fishes: Chinook, coho salmon, steelhead (rainbow trout) and coastal cutthroat trout among the major species. In its natural state, it was the third-largest salmon- and steelhead-producing river system in California, with over a million fish spawning annually, after the Sacramento and Klamath rivers. The annual chinook salmon run was estimated at 100,000–800,000, coho at 50,000–100,000, and steelhead may have numbered as high as 100,000–150,000.

About 22,000 years ago, a massive landslide off Nefus Peak dammed the Eel River near Alderpoint to a height of . A -long lake formed behind the barrier. Sediment deposits indicate the lake may have persisted for as many as several thousand years, which is highly unusual considering the easily eroded rock of the region and the unstable nature of landslide dams in general. The dam blocked access to steelhead trout spawning grounds in the upper Eel River, causing the summer and winter runs to interbreed. Thus, there is an unusually high genetic similarity between summer-run and winter-run steelhead in the Eel River system, in contrast to other rivers in the Western United States.

Human impacts have led to a dramatic decline of salmon and steelhead populations in the Eel River system. Large-scale commercial fishing began in the 1850s, with multiple canneries on the Eel River operating into the early to mid 1900s. Between 1857 and 1921, canning operations took an estimated 93,000 fish per year, with a peak of 600,000 fish in 1877. By the 1890s, fish populations had already recorded a precipitous decline. Logging and grazing, which expose formerly forested land as bare ground, have had even greater impact on the populations of these fish. Due to the mountainous terrain and heavy precipitation in the Eel River watershed, erosion rates are particularly high. Much of the anadromous fish spawning habitat in the river system was covered by sediment or blocked by debris jams. Record flooding in 1955 and 1964, which destroyed or damaged large amounts of habitat along the Eel and its tributaries, was generally regarded as the final blow. After the 1964 flood, chinook salmon populations plunged to fewer than 10,000 per year.

Anadromous fish populations have continued to decline since the 1960s; in 2010, only 3,500 salmon and steelhead returned to the river to spawn. However, with better land management practices in the watershed, salmon and steelhead runs have shown signs of recovery. In late 2012, high water in the Eel River attracted a run of over 30,000 fish, the largest on record since 1958. Since 2012, runs have fluctuated. While improved from the low point of 3,500 at the beginning of the decade, the runs have yet to again reach the high mark of over 30,000. From 2013 to 2014, 2016 to 2017 were between 15,000 and 25,000 while 2015, and 2018 to 2019 were between 9,000 and 15,000.

===Other fishes===
The river provides wildlife habitat for preservation of rare and endangered species including warm and cold freshwater habitat for fish migration and spawning. The river and its tributaries support at least 15 species of native freshwater fish. Major species include Pacific lamprey, &quot;Entosphenus tridentatus&quot;, formerly &quot;Lampetra tridentata&quot;, Sacramento sucker, threespine stickleback, Pacific staghorn sculpin, Coastrange sculpin and prickly sculpin. At least 16 species of non-native fish have been introduced to the river system. The non-native Sacramento pikeminnow is present; it competes with and preys on young salmonids.

The Eel River has never contained true eels, but is named for the Pacific lamprey, an eel-shaped parasite that attaches itself to other fish during its ocean life-cycle. Like salmon and steelhead, lampreys are anadromous, meaning they live part of their life in the ocean but return to fresh water to spawn. They are Cyclostomes (Circle mouths), a primitive fish-like creature, and are not related to eels.

===Eel River estuary===
The Eel River forms a long estuary west of Fortuna, which has been identified as one of the most important and sensitive estuaries on the West Coast. The estuary consists of some of tidal flats, perennial and seasonal wetlands, connected by of river channels and tidal sloughs. About consist of undeveloped wetlands while have been converted to agriculture. The estuary is the third-largest coastal wetland region in California, after the Sacramento–San Joaquin River Delta and the Salinas River estuaries in central California, forming an important habitat for various species of shorebirds, fish and mammals such as river otters and harbor seals. About of the estuary are protected as the Eel River Estuary Preserve.

The Eel River estuary is recognized for protection by the California Bays and Estuaries Policy.

In 2018 CalTrout, along with other partners, announced they had received a grant of over $5M to revive the degraded estuary. The site of the project is the Eel River Estuary Preserve, formerly known as Connick Ranch. The Wildlands Conservancy acquired the land in 2008 with the goal of restoring the wetland system and provide public access to the scenic area.

==River modifications==
There are two hydroelectric dams on the Eel: Scott Dam, which forms Lake Pillsbury, and Cape Horn Dam, which forms Van Arsdale Reservoir just north of Potter Valley. At Cape Horn Dam, the majority of the water is diverted through a tunnel and hydroelectric plant, and then to the headwaters of the Russian River in Potter Valley and is known as the Potter Valley Project. Originally conceived in the late 1800s and built between 1906 and 1922, the project provides about of additional water for the Russian River system for about 500,000 people in Mendocino and Sonoma Counties.

The Potter Valley Project has been argued by environmental groups to have significant impacts on the salmonid (Chinook and coho salmon and steelhead) populations of the basin. Although dam operators are required to maintain certain flows below the diversion during the dry season, these flows can be cut during exceptionally dry years, preventing salmonids from reaching certain spawning streams in the Eel River basin. Project water is disproportionately important to salmonids in the Eel River system as a whole because the water released from the bottom of Scott Dam is the only cold water available in the basin during the dry season. During July, August and September, temperatures in the lower Eel River occasionally hit or higher, creating fatal conditions for these fish.

In 1983, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission relicensed the project under the condition that more water be provided to the Eel River during the dry season and less be diverted to the Russian River basin. Dam releases are now timed to mimic natural flows in the Eel River system. Occasional large &quot;blocks&quot; of water are also released from Scott Dam to help juvenile salmonids migrate to the sea before temperatures in the lower river become unsuitable for their passage. These conditions were revised in 2004, when stricter minimum release standards were established. In combination with drought in the early 21st century, average diversions through the project have decreased by about for the period 2004 through 2010. In December 2013, due to record low levels of water in the Eel River and the associated dammed lakes, levels of fish and lampreys in the rivers were at lowest recorded levels, and Pacific Gas and Electric Company sought to have FERC change their operating license to permit even lower releases of water to the Eel until the drought eases. Under current agreements, the dams must release at least beginning every year on December 1 to aid salmon migration.

The federal United Western Investigation study in 1951 proposed multiple large dams on the wild North Coast rivers of California, including the Eel River. These dams would have been far bigger than those of the Potter Valley Project, and would create some of the largest reservoirs in California. The Army Corps of Engineers and Bureau of Reclamation both sought to build dams in the Eel River system which, starting in the 1960s was targeted as a potential new source for the California State Water Project. Major dams proposed in the watershed included ones at English Ridge, Bell Springs and Sequoia (Alderpoint) on the main stem, and the infamous Dos Rios on the Middle Fork. Dos Rios Dam would have flooded of Mendocino County, creating a reservoir of –the largest in California, at nearly twice the size of Shasta Lake.
Water would have been diverted from English Ridge north to Dos Rios and through a tunnel to the offstream Glenn-Colusa reservoir in the Sacramento Valley, from which the water would travel by canal to the Sacramento River. An alternate proposal would have sent the water south from Dos Rios, through English Ridge and then a tunnel to Clear Lake, from which the water would flow down Cache Creek to the Sacramento River. From the beginning, these dams were heavily contested by local residents as well as by environmental groups seeking the protection of California&#x27;s remaining wild rivers.

The great floods of 1955 and 1964 brought renewed interest in building large dams on the Eel River, especially in the case of the Army Corps of Engineers, which attempted to justify the construction of Dos Rios for flood control. However, among all the proposed dams on the Eel River, Dos Rios would have the lowest impact on flood control–a fact that the Army Corps took great pains to conceal, by exaggerating its economic justifications for the dam. When exposed, this would end up becoming the &quot;Achilles&#x27; heel of the project&quot;. Meanwhile, the Bureau insisted that its first priority–English Ridge–should receive the first federal funding. As Marc Reisner describes in &quot;Cadillac Desert&quot; (1986), &quot;The feuding agencies were about to lock horns and starve over the first two dams on their priority list.&quot; By 1969, a strong opposition movement had formed, led by a Round Valley rancher named Richard Wilson, who had studied hydrology at Dartmouth College. Wilson calculated that Dos Rios would have reduced the flood crest of the 1964 flood at Fort Seward by less than a foot (0.3 m). Governor Ronald Reagan formally refused to authorize the project.

Despite Reagan&#x27;s veto, the door to Eel River dams technically remained open. In early 1972, California state senator Peter H. Behr introduced a measure to create a state wild and scenic rivers system, which would protect many undeveloped North Coast rivers, including the Eel, from future damming. In the same year, senator Randolph Collier proposed a measure that would block dams in the Klamath and Trinity Rivers but &quot;permitted &#x27;planning&#x27; for dams on the Eel River. Conservationists saw this as a backdoor attempt to resurrect Dos Rios Dam and endorsed the Behr bill.&quot; Collier&#x27;s bill was supported by powerful agricultural interests in the Central Valley on the then-&quot;dubious claim&quot; that they would need the water from these rivers in the future. After the state legislature approved both bills, the final decision fell to Reagan, who signed the Behr bill, again in favor of the conservationists. However, Behr had been forced to compromise in order to get his bill approved from the state; as signed, it would only place a 12-year moratorium on planning for dams in the Eel River system.

Over the next several years, Reagan continued lobbying for increased protection of the Eel River system. In 1979, he requested the North Coast rivers be added to the National Wild and Scenic system. In 1981, well before Behr&#x27;s moratorium expired, Secretary of the Interior Cecil Andrus granted federal protection to the Eel River system and of streams along the North Coast, succeeding state legislation and placing the river permanently off limits to new dams.

In November 2023, PG&amp;E &quot;filed an application to federal regulators&quot; to demolish their two dams on the Eel. Deconstruction could begin as early as 2028, pending approvals. The dam projects have become unviable due to higher maintenance, reduced water flow as allowed by changed regulations, and seismic risks to the dams.

==Recreation==
The four forks of the Eel and their tributaries provide opportunities for whitewater kayaking and rafting on their upper sections. There is a class IV–V run between the Scott and Van Arsdale dams. A popular run is from Dos Rios to Alderpoint with Class II–III rapids, taking three to four days to run, depending on how many side tributaries are explored. From Alderpoint to Eel Rock is a class I–II float during June, with many beaches suitable for camping. Below Eel Rock the ocean winds make boating difficult starting in the early afternoon.

The South Fork is a class III–IV run in its upper section between Branscomb and Cummings, with a waterfall that needs to be portaged. After the South Fork turns due north at Cummings it is mainly a class II–III, changing mostly to a class II run below Piercy. The Middle Eel has a good run from the confluence with the Black Butte River to Coal Miners Falls, which is portaged by all but experts. The Van Duzen River also has some class II–III runs beginning below Goat Rock. The North Fork is the most pristine of the tributaries, but is difficult to enter because of its remote location. There is a Class III run in the reach between Hulls Creek and Mina Road.

There are also many miles of river suitable for flatwater boating in the downstream sections of both the mainstem Eel and the South Fork. Humboldt Redwoods State Park leads paddle trips along that stretch of the river. There is good fishing for Chinook salmon and steelhead in the lower river, and rainbow trout are found above Lake Pillsbury. Introduced pikeminnow, in conjunction with the diminished flows due to the Potter Valley Project water diversion, have taken a significant toll on the native fish population below Van Arsdale Dam. The river can be closed to fishing in some years after October 1 if flows are insufficient for migrating salmon and steelhead.

The Eel River watershed includes Admiral William Standley State Recreation Area, Smithe Redwoods State Recreation Area, Standish-Hickey State Recreation Area, Humboldt Redwoods State Park, Richardson Grove State Park, Six Rivers National Forest, and Mendocino National Forest, which are popular for camping and hiking. There is wilderness camping above Lake Pillsbury on both branches, the Rice Fork and Eel River, (also known as South Eel because it is south of the lake), which have numerous swimming holes and camp sites. The Eel River Canyon Preserve includes the Grand Canyon of the Eel River which is home to dozens of endangered species and rare wildlife. The park will include the proposed Great Redwood Trail.

<doc id="759166" wikidata="Q665207" url="?curid=759166" title="Thoracic outlet syndrome">
<text>Thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) is a condition in which there is compression of the nerves, arteries, or veins in the superior thoracic aperture, the passageway from the lower neck to the armpit, also known as the thoracic outlet. There are three main types: neurogenic, venous, and arterial. The neurogenic type is the most common and presents with pain, weakness, paraesthesia, and occasionally loss of muscle at the base of the thumb. The venous type results in swelling, pain, and possibly a bluish coloration of the arm. The arterial type results in pain, coldness, and pallor of the arm.
TOS may result from trauma, repetitive arm movements, tumors, pregnancy, or anatomical variations such as a cervical rib. The diagnosis may be supported by nerve conduction studies and medical imaging. TOS is difficult to diagnose and there are many potential differential diagnoses as well as other diseases that are often co-occurrent with TOS.
Initial treatment for the neurogenic type is with exercises to strengthen the chest muscles and improve posture. NSAIDs such as naproxen may be used for pain. Surgery is typically done for the arterial and venous types and a decompression for the neurogenic type if it does not improve with other treatments. Blood thinners may be used to treat or prevent blood clots. The condition affects about 1% of the population. It is more common in women than men and it occurs most commonly between 20 and 50 years of age. The condition was first described in 1818 and the current term &quot;thoracic outlet syndrome&quot; first used in 1956.
==Signs and symptoms==
TOS affects mainly the upper limbs, with signs and symptoms manifesting in the shoulders, neck, arms and hands. Pain can be present on an intermittent or permanent basis. It can be sharp/stabbing, burning, or aching. TOS can involve only part of the hand (as in the pinky and adjacent half of the ring finger), all of the hand, or the inner aspect of the forearm and upper arm. Pain can also be in the side of the neck, the pectoral area below the clavicle, the armpit/axillary area, and the upper back (i.e., the trapezius and rhomboid area). Discoloration of the hands, one hand colder than the other hand, weakness of the hand and arm muscles, and tingling are commonly present.

Only 1% of people with carpal tunnel syndrome have concomitant TOS.

Repetitive motions can cause enlargement of muscles which causes compression of veins. Besides, overuse injury of the upper limbs causes swellings, small bleeding, and subsequent fibrosis which would cause the thrombosis of the subclavian vein, leading to Paget–Schroetter disease or effort-induced thrombosis.

TOS can be related to cerebrovascular arterial insufficiency when affecting the subclavian artery. It also can affect the vertebral artery, in which case it could produce vision disturbances, including transient blindness, and embolic cerebral infarction.

TOS can also lead to eye problems and vision loss as a circumstance of vertebral artery compression. Although very rare, if compression of the brain stem is also involved in an individual presentation of TOS, transient blindness may occur while the head is held in certain positions.
If left untreated, TOS can lead to neurological deficits as a result of the hypoperfusion and hypometabolism of certain areas of the brain and cerebellum.

TOS has similar symptoms to pectoralis minor syndrome (PMS), which usually results from compression of the braxial plexus beneath the pectoralis minor muscle (while neurogenic TOS is caused by compression of the same nerves above the clavicle). Unlike TOS there is typically few headaches or neck pain in patients with PMS only, instead with pain in the chest area. Initially, it was believed that 95 percent of patients with TOS had nerve compression in the scalene area, but in the twenty-first century it is now recognized that the majority have nerve compression under the pectoralis minor, either by itself or in addition to the scalene area. One study of 100 patients diagnosed with neurogenic TOS found that 75 percent had neurogenic PMS and 30 percent in fact had PMS without TOS.

==Causes==

TOS can be attributed to one or more of the following factors:
* Congenital abnormalities are frequently found in persons with TOS. Bone abnormalities include the presence of a cervical rib and a prolonged transverse process. Soft tissue abnormalities include scalene muscle hypertrophy, the presence of a fourth scalene muscle (scalenus minimus), or connective tissue abnormalities.
* Trauma (e.g., whiplash injuries) or repetitive strain is frequently implicated.
* Injury, such as first rib fracture or clavicle fracture.
* Rarer acquired causes include tumors (especially pancoast tumor), hyperostosis, and osteomyelitis

==Diagnosis==
TOS is somewhat difficult to diagnose since there is no set diagnostic criteria. Doctors may use medical imaging, nerve conduction studies, or a variety of tests designed to trigger symptoms. In rare cases when doctors find objective findings of nerve compression, it is called &quot;true&quot; neurogenic TOS. However, when there is no specified pathological evidence, it is called &quot;disputed&quot; neurogenic TOS.

Adson&#x27;s sign and the costoclavicular maneuver lack specificity and sensitivity and should make up only a small part of the mandatory comprehensive history and physical examination undertaken with a patient suspected of having TOS.

Additional maneuvers that may be abnormal in TOS include Wright&#x27;s test, which involves hyperabducting the arms over the head with some extension and evaluating for loss of radial pulses or signs of blanching of the skin in the hands indicating a decrease in blood flow with the maneuver. The &quot;compression test&quot; is also used, exerting pressure between the clavicle and medial humeral head causes radiation of pain and/or numbness into the affected arm.

Doppler arteriography, with probes at the fingertips and arms, tests the force and &quot;smoothness&quot; of the blood flow through the radial arteries, with and without having the patient perform various arm maneuvers (which causes compression of the subclavian artery at the thoracic outlet). The movements can elicit symptoms of pain and numbness and produce graphs with diminished arterial blood flow to the fingertips, providing strong evidence of impingement of the subclavian artery at the thoracic outlet. Doppler arteriography does not utilize probes at the fingertips and arms, and in this case is likely being confused with plethysmography, which is a different method that utilizes ultrasound without direct visualization of the affected vessels. Doppler ultrasound (not really &#x27;arteriography&#x27;) would not be used at the radial artery in order to make the diagnosis of TOS. Finally, even if a Doppler study of the appropriate artery were to be positive, it would not diagnose neurogenic TOS, by far the most common subtype of TOS. There is plenty of evidence in the medical literature to show that arterial compression does not equate to brachial plexus compression, although they may occur together, in varying degrees. Additionally, arterial compression by itself does not make the diagnosis of arterial TOS (the rarest form of TOS). Lesser degrees of arterial compression have been shown in normal individuals in various arm positions and are thought to be of little significance without the other criteria for arterial TOS. 

MRI scan can show the anatomy of the thoracic outlet, the soft tissues causing compression, and can show directly the brachial plexus compression.

===Classification===
====By structures affected and symptomatology====
There are three main types of TOS, named according to the cause of the symptoms; however, these three classifications have been coming into disfavor because TOS can involve all three types of compression to various degrees. The compression can occur in three anatomical structures (arteries, veins and nerves), it can be isolated, or, more commonly, two or three of the structures are compressed to greater or lesser degrees. In addition, the compressive forces can be of different magnitude in each affected structure. Therefore, symptoms can be variable.
* Neurogenic TOS includes disorders produced by compression of components of the brachial plexus nerves. The neurogenic form of TOS accounts for 95% of all cases of TOS.
* Venous TOS is due to compression of the subclavian vein. This makes up about 4% of cases.
* Arterial TOS is due to compression of the subclavian artery. This is less than one percent of cases. However, this type maybe mistakenly provided as a diagnosis when the patient may actually have NTOS.

====By event====
There are many causes of TOS. The most frequent cause is trauma, either sudden (as in a clavicle fracture caused by a car accident), or repetitive (as in a legal secretary who works with his/her hands, wrists, and arms at a fast-paced desk station with non-ergonomic posture for many years). TOS is also found in certain occupations involving much lifting of the arms and repetitive use of the wrists and arms .

One cause of arterial compression is trauma, and a recent case involving fracture of the clavicle has been reported.

The two groups of people most likely to develop TOS are those with neck injuries due to traffic accidents and those who use computers in non-ergonomic postures for extended periods of time. TOS is frequently a repetitive stress injury (RSI) caused by certain types of work environments.

====By structure causing constriction====
It is also possible to classify TOS by the location of the obstruction:
* Anterior scalene syndrome (compression on brachial plexus and/or subclavian artery caused by muscle growth).
* Cervical rib syndrome (compression on brachial plexus and/or subclavian artery caused by bone growth).
* Costoclavicular syndrome (narrowing between the clavicle and the first rib) – diagnosed with the costoclavicular maneuver.

Some people are born with an extra incomplete and very small rib above their first rib, which protrudes out into the superior thoracic outlet space. This rudimentary rib causes fibrous changes around the brachial plexus nerves, inducing compression and causing the symptoms and signs of TOS. This is called a &quot;cervical rib&quot; because of its attachment to C-7 (the seventh cervical vertebra), and its surgical removal is almost always recommended. The symptoms of TOS can first appear in the early teen years as a child is becoming more athletic.

==Treatment==
Evidence for the treatment of thoracic outlet syndrome as of 2014 is poor.

===Physical measures===
Stretching, occupational and physical therapy are common non-invasive approaches used in the treatment of TOS. The goal of stretching is to relieve compression in the thoracic cavity, reduce blood vessel and nerve impingement, and realign the bones, muscles, ligaments, or tendons that are causing the problem.
* One commonly prescribed set of stretches includes moving the shoulders anteriorly (forward – called &quot;hunching&quot;), then back to a neutral position, then extending them posteriorly (backward, called &quot;arching&quot;), then back to neutral, followed by lifting the shoulders up as high as possible, and then back down to neutral, repeated in cycles as tolerated.
* Another set of stretches involves tilting and extending the neck opposite to the side of the injury while keeping the injured arm down or wrapped around the back.
* Occupational or Physical therapy can include passive or active range of motion exercises, working up to weighted or restricted sets (as tolerated).

TOS is rapidly aggravated by poor posture. Active breathing exercises and ergonomic desk setup and motion practices can help maintain active posture. Often the muscles in the back become weak due to prolonged (years of) &quot;hunching&quot; and other poor postures.

Ice can be used to decrease inflammation of sore or injured muscles. Heat can also aid in relieving sore muscles by improving blood circulation to them. While the whole arm generally feels painful in TOS, some relief can be seen when ice or heat is intermittently applied to the thoracic region (collar bone, armpit, or shoulder blades).

===Medications===
In a review, botox was compared to a placebo injected into the scalene muscles. No effect in terms of pain relief or improved movement was noted. However, in a six-months follow-up, paresthesia (abnormal sensations such as in &quot;pins and needles&quot;) was seen to be significantly improved.

===Surgery===
Surgical approaches have also been used successfully in TOS. Microsurgery can be used approaching the area from above the collar bone (supraclavicular) followed by neurolysis of the brachial plexus, removal of the scalene muscle (scalenectomy), and the release of the underlying (subclavicular) blood vessels. This approach avoids the use of resection, and has been found to be an effective treatment. In cases where the first rib (or a fibrous band extending from the first rib) is compressing a vein, artery, or the nerve bundle, part of the first rib and any compressive fibrous tissue, can be removed in a first rib resection and thoracic outlet decompression surgical procedure; scalene muscles may also need to be removed (scalenectomy). This allows increased blood flow and the reduction of nerve compression. In some cases there may be a rudimentary rib or a cervical rib that can be causing the compression, which can be removed using the same technique.

Physical therapy is often used before and after the operation to improve recovery time and outcomes. Potential complications include pneumothorax, infection, loss of sensation, motor problems, subclavian vessel damage, and, as in all surgeries, a very small risk of permanent serious injury or death.

==Notable cases==
;Sports
Several Major League Baseball players, especially pitchers, have been diagnosed with thoracic outlet syndrome, including Stephen Strasburg, Chris Archer, Matt Harvey, Chris Carpenter, Jaime Garcia, Shaun Marcum, Matt Harrison, Clayton Richard, Nate Karns, and Noah Lowry. Starting pitcher Chris Young, who previously struggled with shoulder problems, underwent surgery for TOS in 2013 and felt &quot;completely different&quot; post-recovery. Young exceeded expectations on his return to the major leagues at age 35, becoming a valuable member of the 2014 Seattle Mariners&#x27; starting rotation. In July 1980, Houston Astros starting pitcher J.R. Richard collapsed while playing a game of catch, and was found to have experienced a stroke due to severe blockage of his right carotid artery. Given the fact that shortly beforehand, he had been found to have near-total obstruction of the arteries supplying his right arm, he was eventually diagnosed with extensive arterial thoracic outlet syndrome. Although he attempted a comeback, his professional baseball career was effectively ended.

NHL defenseman Adam McQuaid was diagnosed with TOS in September 2012, and as a result was nominated for the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy. Forward Chris Kreider was diagnosed with a malformed rib in 2017. Kreider dealt with multiple symptoms prior to the diagnosis, such as shortness of breath on the ice, swelling/numbness in his right arm, coughing up blood and a blood clot in his right arm. Kreider underwent successful surgery to resect a rib in January 2018 (the same surgery as TOS) and has performed well since returning to the Rangers.

NBA guard Markelle Fultz was diagnosed with TOS in December 2018.

UFC fighter Matt Serra had a rib removed to alleviate TOS.

;Music
Musician Isaac Hanson had a pulmonary embolism as a consequence of thoracic outlet syndrome.

The Japanese band Maria disbanded in 2010 due to drummer Tattsu&#x27;s TOS which made it impossible for her to continue playing.

In 2015, singer Tamar Braxton had to leave &quot;Dancing With The Stars&quot; due to TOS.

<text>Emil Orlik (21 July 1870 – 28 September 1932) was a painter, etcher and lithographer. He was born in Prague, which was at that time part of the 
Lands of the Bohemian Crown, Austro-Hungarian Empire, and lived and worked in Prague, Austria and Germany.

==Biography==
Emil Orlik was the son of a Jewish tailor. He first studied art at the private art school of Heinrich Knirr, where one of his fellow pupils was Paul Klee. From 1891, he studied at the Munich Academy under Wilhelm Lindenschmit. Later he learned engraving from Johann Leonhard Raab and proceeded to experiment with various printmaking processes.

After completing his military service in Prague, he returned to Munich, where he worked for the magazine &quot;Jugend&quot;. He spent most of 1898, travelling through Europe, visiting the Netherlands, Great Britain, Belgium, and Paris. During this time he became aware of Japanese art, and the impact it was having in Europe, and decided to visit Japan to learn woodcut techniques. He left for Asia in March 1900, stopping off in Hong Kong, before reaching Japan, where he stayed until February 1901.

In 1905 Emil Orlik moved to Berlin and took a post at the &quot;School for Graphic and Book Art&quot; of the Museum of Decorative Arts (Kunstgewerbemuseum), now part of the Berlin State Museums. He taught at the Berlin College of Arts and Crafts, where one of his students was George Grosz.

Orlik&#x27;s work is held in the permanent collections of several museums worldwide, including the Princeton University Art Museum, the British Museum, the Museum of Modern Art, the University of Michigan Museum of Art, the Worcester Art Museum, the Harvard Art Museums, the Clark Art Institute, the Chazen Museum of Art, the Brooklyn Museum, the National Museum of Western Art, the Cleveland Museum of Art, the Artizon Museum, the Fine Arts Museum of San Francisco, the Portland Art Museum, the Fairfield University Museum, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

<doc id="759172" wikidata="Q525910" url="?curid=759172" title="Alexander Orlov (Soviet defector)">
<text>Alexander Mikhailovich Orlov (, born Leiba Leyzerovich Feldbin, later Lev Lazarevich Nikolsky, and in the US assuming the name of Igor Konstantinovich Berg; 21 August 1895 – 25 March 1973), was a colonel in the Soviet secret police and NKVD &quot;Rezident&quot; in the Second Spanish Republic. In 1938, Orlov refused to return to the Soviet Union due to fears of execution, and instead fled with his family to the United States. He is mostly known for secretly transporting the entire Spanish gold reserves to the USSR in exchange for military aid for Spanish Republic and for his book, &quot;The Secret History of Stalin&#x27;s Crimes&quot;.

==Aliases==
Throughout his career, Orlov was also known under the names of Lev Lazarevich Nikolsky, Lev Leonidovich Nikolaev, SCHWED (his OGPU/NKVD code name), Leo Feldbiene (as in his Austrian passport), William Goldin (as in his US passport), Koornick (the name of his Jewish relatives living in the US). Travelling in the United States, he often registered under the names of Alexander L. Berg and Igor Berg.

==Early life==

He was born Lev Lazarevich Feldbin in the Belarusian town of Babruysk on August 21, 1895, to an Orthodox Jewish family. He attended the Lazarevsky Institute in Moscow but left it after two semesters to enroll at Moscow University to study law. His study, however, was cut short when he was drafted into the Imperial Russian Army.

When the Russian Civil War erupted in 1918, Orlov joined the Red Army and became a GRU officer assigned to the region around Kyiv, Ukraine. Orlov personally led and directed sabotage missions into territory controlled by the anti-communist White Movement. He later served with the OGPU Border Guards in Arkhangelsk.

In 1921, he retired from the Red Army and returned to Moscow to resume his study of law at the Law School at Moscow University. Orlov worked for several years at the Bolshevik High Tribunal under the tutelage of Nikolai Krylenko. In May 1924, his cousin, Zinoviy Katznelson, who was chief of the OGPU Economic Department (EKU), invited Lev Nikolsky (his official name since 1920) to join the Soviet secret police as an officer of Financial Section 6.

==State Security Service==
When his cousin was moved to supervise the Transcaucasian Border Troops of the OGPU, he offered to Nikolsky and his wife the opportunity to move to Tiflis (now Tbilisi, Georgia) as chief of the Border Guard unit there, which he accepted. There, their daughter contracted a rheumatic fever infection, and Orlov asked his friend and former colleague, Artur Artuzov, to give him an assignment abroad so that Orlov could have European doctors treat his daughter.

===Posted in Paris and Berlin===
Therefore, in 1926, he was transferred to the Inostranny Otdel (&quot;Foreign Department&quot;), the branch of the OGPU responsible for overseas intelligence operations, now headed by Artuzov. He was sent to Paris under a legal cover of a Soviet Trade Delegation official. After one year in France, Nikolsky, who operated on a fraudulent Soviet passport in the name of Léon Nikolaeff, was transferred to a similar position to Berlin. He returned to Moscow in late 1930.

===Posted to US===
Two years later, he was sent to the United States to establish relations with his relatives there and to obtain a genuine American passport that would allow free travel in Europe. &quot;Leon L. Nikolaev&quot; (Nikolsky-Orlov) after arriving in the US aboard the SS &quot;Europa&quot; on 22 September 1932 sailing from Bremen. After being identified as a spy by the US Office of Naval Intelligence, Orlov obtained a passport in the name of William Goldin and departed on 30 November 1932 on the SS &quot;Bremen&quot; back to Weimar Germany.

===Posted to Austria and Czechoslovakia===
In Moscow, he successfully again asked for a foreign assignment, as he wanted his sick daughter to be treated by Dr. Karl Noorden in Vienna. With his wife and daughter, he arrived in Vienna in May 1933 (as Nikolaev) and settled in Hinterbrühl only 30 km from the capital. After three months, he went to Prague, changed his Soviet passport for the American one, and left for Geneva. Nikolsky&#x27;s group, which operated against the French Deuxième Bureau, included Aleksandr Korotkov, a young Illegal Rezident (spy without official cover); Korotkov&#x27;s wife, Maria Korotkova; and a courier, Arnold Finkelberg. 

Their operation, codenamed EXPRESS, was unsuccessful, and in May 1934, he joined his family in Vienna and was ordered to go to Copenhagen to serve as assistant to &quot;rezidents&quot; Theodore Maly (Paris) and Ignace Reiss (Copenhagen).

===Posted to United Kingdom===
In June 1935, under the name William Goldin, he himself became a &quot;rezident&quot; in London. His cover in London, as Goldin, was as a director of an American refrigerator company. Despite Orlov&#x27;s later claims, he had nothing to do with recruitment of Kim Philby or any other member of the Cambridge Five and deserted his post in October 1935, coming back to Moscow. Here he was dismissed from the Foreign Service and put into the lowly position of a deputy chief of the Transport Department (TO) of the NKVD, the successor secret service organization to the OGPU.

===Work during Spanish Civil War===
In early September 1936, Orlov was appointed NKVD liaison to the Spanish Republican Ministry of Interior, arriving in Madrid on September 16. Author Donald Rayfield reports:
Stalin, Yezhov and Beria distrusted Soviet participants in the Spanish war. Military advisors like Vladimir Antonov-Ovseenko, journalists like Mikhail Koltsov were open to infection by the heresies, especially Leon Trotsky&#x27;s, prevalent among the Republic&#x27;s supporters.

NKVD agents sent to Spain were therefore keener on abducting and murdering anti-Stalinists among Republican leaders and International Brigade commanders than on fighting Francisco Franco. The defeat of the Republic, in Stalin&#x27;s eyes, was caused not by the NKVD&#x27;s diversionary efforts but by the treachery of the heretics.

Orlov arrived in Madrid on 15 September 1936. He organized guerrilla warfare behind Nationalist lines, as he had done in Ukraine during the Russian Civil War, but after his defection to the West the work was later credited to his deputy, Grigory Syroezhkin, to avoid mention of the defected general.

In October 1936, Orlov, according to his own disputed testimony, was placed in command of the operation which moved the Spanish gold reserves from Madrid to Moscow. The Republican government had agreed to use this hoard of bullion as an advance payment for Soviet military supplies. Orlov undertook the logistics of this transfer. It took four nights for truck convoys, driven by Soviet tankmen, to bring the 510 tonnes of gold from its hiding place in the mountains to the port of Cartagena. There, under threat of German bombing raids, it was loaded on four different Russian steamers bound for Odessa. For his service, Orlov received the Order of Lenin. According to Boris Volodarsky&#x27;s research, Orlov greatly exaggerated his role in this operation (e.g., by claiming he made it possible by negotiating the matter with the Spanish republican government), his mission being mostly logistical and a security one.

However, Orlov&#x27;s main task in Spain remained arresting and executing Trotskyites, Anarchists, Roman Catholic supporters of Franco&#x27;s Nationalists, and other suspected foes of the Spanish Republic. Documents released from the NKVD archives detail a number of Orlov&#x27;s crimes in Spain. He was responsible for orchestrating the arrest and summary execution of members of the Workers&#x27; Party of Marxist Unification (POUM). He also directed the kidnapping and killing of the POUM leader Andreu Nin.

Orlov was promoted to NKVD chief for Spain around February 1937. Soon, Stalin and the new NKVD head Nikolai Yezhov started the Great Purge, which spread to people operating for NKVD outside the USSR. In Spain, &quot;[a]ll liquidations were planned and executed under Orlov&#x27;s direction. After an apparent failure to mount some sort of intelligence-gathering operations, it seems that Orlov&#x27;s main preoccupation was now witch-hunting. In other words, he became primarily engaged in persecution of those who, for different reasons, were declared enemies by Stalin and Yezhov&quot;.

==Defection==
Meanwhile, the Great Purge continued as Stalin and his inner circle sought to exterminate all suspected &quot;enemies of the people&quot;. Orlov was alerted as close associates and friends were arrested, tortured and shot, one by one. In 1938, Orlov realised that he would soon be next. When he received orders from Moscow to report to a Soviet ship in Antwerp, Orlov was certain that he was about to be arrested. Instead of obeying, Orlov fled with his wife and daughter to Canada.

Before leaving Paris, Orlov left two letters for the Soviet ambassador, one for Stalin and one for the NKVD chief Yezhov. He told them that he would reveal everything he knew about NKVD operations if any action was taken against him or his family. In a two-page attachment, Orlov listed the codenames of numerous illegals and moles operating in the West.

Orlov also sent a letter to Trotsky alerting him to the presence of the NKVD agent Mark Zborowski (codename TULIP) in the entourage of his son, Lev Sedov. Trotsky dismissed this letter as a provocation. Then, Orlov traveled with his family to the United States and went underground. The NKVD, presumably on orders from Stalin, did not try to locate him until 1969.

==&quot;The Secret History&quot;==
After his defection in 1938, he was afraid of being killed like other NKVD defectors such as Ignace Reiss. Therefore, he wrote a letter to Stalin promising to keep all secrets he knew if Stalin spared him and his family. Orlov kept his word and published his memoir &quot;The Secret History of Stalin&#x27;s Crimes&quot; only after the death of Stalin in March 1953, fifteen years after his own flight.

To announce the publication of his memoir, he published four excerpts in &quot;LIFE&quot; magazine in April 1953:
* &quot;Ghastly Secrets of Stalin&#x27;s Power&quot; (April 6, 1953)
* &quot;Inside Story of How Trials Were Rigged&quot; (April 13, 1953)
* &quot;Treachery to His Friends, Cruelty to Their Children&quot; (April 20, 1953)
* &quot;The Man Himself&quot; (April 27, 1953)

==After &quot;The Secret History&quot;==
After the publication of &quot;The Secret History&quot; Orlov was forced to come in from the cold. Both the US Central Intelligence Agency and Federal Bureau of Investigation were embarrassed by the revelation that a high-ranking NKVD officer (Orlov was a Major of State Security, equal to an army brigadier general) had been living underground in the United States for 15 years without their knowledge. Until he resurfaced in the US with his revelations in &quot;Life&quot; magazine Orlov had lived in the US under the name Alexander L. Berg. As the FBI was searching in vain for him and his wife, &quot;two unidentified Russian aliens&quot;, he was studying business administration at Dyke College, Cleveland, Ohio. 

The College and the local FBI division were located in the same Standard Building on 1370 Ontario Street and St Clair Avenue, occupying the third and the ninth floors, respectively. Ironically, the FBI officers &quot;never paid any attention to the mature student who had long figured on the FBI’s most wanted list and who rode the elevators with them every day.&quot;

Orlov was interrogated by the FBI and twice appeared before Senate Sub-Committees, but he always downplayed his role in events and continued to conceal the names of Soviet agents in the West.

In 1956, he wrote an article for &quot;Life&quot; titled &quot;The Sensational Secret Behind the Damnation of Stalin&quot;. This story held that NKVD agents had discovered papers in the tsarist archives which proved Stalin had once been an Okhrana agent, and that based on this knowledge NKVD agents had planned a coup d&#x27;état, together with the leaders of the Red Army. Stalin, Orlov continued, uncovered the plot and this was his motive behind the secret trial and execution of Soviet Marshal Mikhail Tukhachevsky and the purge of the Red Army. The &quot;Life&quot; article cites the Eremin letter as evidence that Stalin was a member of the Okhrana, but most historians today agree it is a forgery. Later research by Simon Sebag Montefiore also contradicts Orlov&#x27;s theory.

Orlov and his wife continued to live secretly and modestly in the United States. In 1963, the CIA helped him publish another book, &quot;The Handbook of Counter-Intelligence and Guerilla Warfare&quot;, and helped him obtain a job as a researcher at the University of Michigan Law School. He moved to Cleveland, Ohio. His wife died there. He died on 25 March 1973. Orlov never wavered in his contempt for Stalin. His last book, &quot;The March of Time&quot;, was published in the US in 2004 by the former FBI Special Agent Ed Gazur.

==False and disputed claims==
Orlov was shown to have produced a number of false claims to support his story and elevate his status in the eyes of his debriefing officials and the wider Western public. For instance, his rank was not general, as he had claimed, but merely a major. He also falsely claimed to play the leading role in recruiting the Cambridge Five spy ring, while in fact Orlov/Nikolsky &quot;had nothing to do with the first three Cambridge University agents when they were successfully recruited. And he certainly knew nothing about those who joined the list after he had left London and was dismissed from the foreign intelligence department.&quot;
Orlov, in discussing the origins of the Moscow Trials, was not aware that Trotsky and his supporters had organized a short-lived oppositional bloc in the Soviet Union, public knowledge of which first emerged in 1980 after Orlov&#x27;s death. Robert W. Thurston argues that, &quot;These discoveries of clandestine activities undoubtedly induced Stalin to pressure the party and police for the arrest of opposition members,&quot; contradicting accounts like Orlov&#x27;s which &quot;argued that Stalin fabricated the show trials from nothing.&quot;

In the words of researcher Boris Volodarsky:... most of what Orlov said, even under oath, or during his debriefing by the US intelligence officials, or in private discussions with his friend Gazur, has by now been established as outright invention.There is a quote from the book &quot;The Mitrokhin Archive&quot; by Christopher Andrew and Vasili Mitrokhin which states:

&quot;...a KGB/SVR – sponsored biography of Orlov published in 1993 claimed that he was &quot;the mastermind&quot; responsible for the recruitment of the Cambridge agents. There are probably two reasons for this exaggeration. The first is hierarchical. Within the Soviet nomenklatura senior bureaucrats commonly claimed, and were accorded, the credit for their subordinates&#x27; successes. The claim that Orlov, the most senior intelligence officer involved in British operations in the 1930s, &quot;recruited&quot; Philby is a characteristic example of this common phenomenon.&quot;

The other reason was that:

&quot;It suits the SVR ..., to seek to demonstrate the foolishness of Western intelligence...by claiming that they failed for over 30 years to notice that the leading recruiter of the Cambridge Five...was living under their noses...&quot;

<text>Count Alexei (Alexey) Grigoryevich Orlov-Chesmensky (;  – ) was a Russian soldier, general-in-chief, general admiral and statesman, who rose to prominence during the reign of Catherine the Great. His joint victory with Grigory Spiridov and Samuel Greig in the Battle of Chesma put him in the ranks of the outstanding Russian military commanders of all time; and although he lacked naval experience, he was the only authority in those circumstances who could ensure proper co-ordination of action.

Orlov served in the Imperial Russian Army, and through his connections with his brother, became one of the key conspirators in the plot to overthrow Tsar Peter III and replace him on the Russian throne with his wife, Catherine. The plot, carried out in 1762, was successful, and Peter was imprisoned under Alexei Orlov&#x27;s guard. He died shortly afterwards under mysterious circumstances, and it was popularly believed Orlov had either ordered, or personally carried out, his murder. Handsomely rewarded by Catherine after her accession, the Orlovs became powerful at court. Alexei was promoted and took part in the Russo-Turkish War of 1768–74, commanding a naval expedition to the Mediterranean in 1770, which destroyed the Ottoman fleet at the battle of Chesma. For his success he was granted the honorific Chesmensky. The Russian victory sparked off the Orlov Revolt in the Greek territories of the Ottoman Empire soon afterwards.

Orlov remained in the Mediterranean, and received the unusual commission of seducing and then capturing Princess Tarakanoff, a pretender to the Russian throne. Orlov was successful in doing so, and tricked her into boarding a Russian ship at Livorno, where she was arrested and transported to Russia. Alexei&#x27;s brother, Grigory, Catherine&#x27;s lover before and after the coup overthrowing Tsar Peter III took place, fell from favour soon afterwards, and the Orlovs&#x27; power at court diminished. Alexei became a renowned breeder of livestock at his estates, developing the horse breed known as the Orlov Trotter and popularising the Orloff breed of chicken. He left Russia after the death of Catherine and the accession of her son, Tsar Paul I, but returned after Paul&#x27;s death and lived in Russia until his death in 1808.

==Family and early life==
Alexei was born into the noble Orlov family, presumably in Lyutkino (Liutkino), which is now in Tver Oblast, on ; the son of Grigory Ivanovich Orlov, governor of Novgorod, and brother of Grigory Grigoryevich Orlov. He entered the Preobrazhensky Regiment and by 1762 had reached the rank of sergeant. He was involved in the Seven Years&#x27; War. He was described as a giant of a man, over two meters tall, and a celebrated duellist, with a scar across his cheek. The scar earned him the nickname &#x27;scarface&#x27;.

==Involvement in the 1762 coup==
Together with his brother Grigory, Alexei Orlov became involved in the palace coup to overthrow Tsar Peter III and place his wife, Catherine, on the Russian throne. In the coup, carried out in July 1762, Alexei went to meet Catherine at the Peterhof Palace, and finding her in bed, announced &#x27;the time has come for you to reign, madame.&#x27; He then drove her to St Petersburg, where the guards regiments there proclaimed their loyalty to her. The Tsar was arrested and imprisoned at Ropsha, under the guard of Alexei Orlov. There Peter died in mysterious circumstances on . Orlov is popularly supposed to have murdered him, either on his own initiative or on Catherine&#x27;s orders. One account has Orlov giving him poisoned wine to drink which caused ... flames [to course] through his veins. This aroused suspicion in the overthrown emperor and he refused the next glass. But they used force, and he defended himself. In that horrible struggle, in order to stifle his cries, they threw him on the ground and grabbed his throat. But he defended himself with the strength that comes from final desperation, and they tried to avoid wounding him. They placed a rifle strap on the emperor&#x27;s neck. Alexei Orlov kneeled with both legs on his chest and blocked his breathing. He passed away in their hands. They thought that Orlov apparently wrote a letter to Catherine after Peter&#x27;s death, confessing that Peter had been killed in a drunken brawl with one of his jailers, Feodor Bariatynsky, and taking the blame. The authenticity of this letter has been questioned nowadays. It was announced that the Tsar had died from an attack of haemorrhoidal colic.

== Service under Catherine II ==

The Orlovs were rewarded after Catherine&#x27;s accession, and Alexei was promoted to the rank of major-general, and given the title of count. He and his brother received 50,000 roubles and 800 serfs. Despite a lack of formal education and his ignorance of foreign languages, he maintained an interest in science, patronizing Mikhail Lomonosov and Denis Fonvizin, and corresponding with Jean Jacques Rousseau. He was one of the founders of the Free Economic Society and its first elected chairman. Rewarded with large estates, he took an interest in horse breeding, developing the Orlov Trotter, and popularising the breed of chicken now known as the Orloff.

He became involved in military operations during the Russo-Turkish War of 1768–1774, organising the First Archipelago Expedition, and commanding of a squadron of the Imperial Russian Navy, having been promoted to the rank of general admiral. He fought and won the Battle of Chesma against an Ottoman fleet on 5 July 1770, with the help of British naval expertise, and received the right to add the honorific &#x27;Chesmensky&#x27; to his name. He was also awarded the Order of St. George First Class. His expedition sparked off the Orlov Revolt in Greece, which despite initial successes, lacked continued Russian support, and was eventually put down by the Ottomans. Orlov was sent as plenipotentiary to the talks at Focşani in 1772, but his impatience caused the breaking off of negotiations, which led to dissatisfaction from the Empress.

Catherine then commissioned Orlov to make contact with Yelizaveta Alekseyevna, a pretender to the throne claiming to be the daughter of Empress Elizabeth of Russia, and deliver her to Russia. Orlov did so by pretending to be a supporter of hers, and successfully seducing her. He then lured her aboard a Russian ship at Livorno in May 1775, where she was arrested by Admiral Samuel Greig and taken to Russia, where she was imprisoned and later died. Shortly after this service, the Orlovs fell from favour at court, and Alexei and Grigory were dismissed from their positions. Orlov retired to the Sans Ennui Palace near Moscow, and gave luxurious balls and dinners, making himself &#x27;the most popular man in Moscow.&#x27;

== Old age and death==

After Catherine&#x27;s death in 1796 the new ruler, Tsar Paul I ordered that his father, Peter III, be reburied in a grand ceremony. Alexei Orlov was ordered to carry the Imperial Crown in front of the coffin. Orlov was briefly suspected of having been one of the assassins of Peter III. Orlov left Russia during the reign of Paul I, but returned to Moscow after his death and the accession of Tsar Alexander I. Orlov commanded the militia of the fifth district during the War of the Fourth Coalition in 1806–07, which was placed on a war footing almost entirely at his own expense.

Alexei Grigoryevich Orlov died in Moscow on . He left an estate worth five million roubles and 30,000 serfs. His marriage with Eudokia Nikolayevna Lopukhina (contracted on 6 May 1782) produced a daughter, Anna Orlova-Tshesmenskaja (1785–1848), and a son, Ivan (1786–1787). Eudokia died while giving birth to Ivan in 1786. Orlov also is believed to have had an illegitimate son named Alexander (1763–1820).

<doc id="759186" wikidata="Q653774" url="?curid=759186" title="Heraclius of Jerusalem">
<text>Heraclius or Eraclius ( 1128 – 1190/91), was archbishop of Caesarea and Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem.

==Origin and early career==

Heraclius was from the Gévaudan in Auvergne, France. Like his later rival William of Tyre he studied law at the University of Bologna: his contemporaries and friends included Stephen of Tournai and Gratian. He arrived in the Kingdom of Jerusalem before 1168, where he first appears as magister Heraclius, witnessing patriarchal deeds. He was appointed archdeacon of Jerusalem in 1169. In this capacity he tried unsuccessfully to persuade Pope Alexander III to reinstate Gilbert d&#x27;Aissailly as Grand Master of the Knights Hospitaller, although the Pope praised him for his presentation of the case. By 1175 he was archbishop of Caesarea (while William served as archbishop of Tyre). As archbishops, Heraclius and William attended the Third Lateran Council in 1179. In 1180, William considered himself the most likely candidate for the patriarchate of Jerusalem, but the king, Baldwin IV, delegated the choice to his mother Agnes of Courtenay, Lady of Sidon, and her ladies, according to the precedent of the previous election in 1157. Agnes and her committee chose Heraclius.

Because most of information about Heraclius comes from his rival William and the 13th-century &quot;Old French Continuation&quot; of his chronicle, sometimes attributed to Ernoul, Heraclius is often seen as a particularly corrupt and worldly choice for patriarch. He was accused of getting the appointment through being Agnes&#x27;s lover, which may reflect nothing more than the ill-will of his defeated opponent&#x27;s party. He lived openly with a draper&#x27;s widow from Nablus, Pasque de Riveri, who was referred to as &quot;Madame la Patriarchesse&quot;, by whom he had at least one daughter. However, clerical concubinage was hardly rare in the 12th century. The claim in the &quot;Old French Continuation&quot; that he excommunicated William in 1183, forcing him to leave the kingdom to seek the Pope&#x27;s help in Rome, and arranged for him to be poisoned there, is demonstrably false. No Western chroniclers noted what would (if true) have been a major ecclesiastical scandal. William did not die until 1185 or 1186, and was carrying out his duties as Archbishop to the end.

==Travel==
In 1184, Heraclius, along with Roger de Moulins, Grand Master of the Knights Hospitaller, and Arnold of Torroja, Grand Master of the Knights Templar, travelled to Europe to seek help in solving the looming succession crisis in the kingdom. They carried with them the keys of the city of Jerusalem, the Holy Sepulchre and the Tower of David, along with other memorabilia. The mission visited Italy (Arnold of Torroja died at Verona), then France and England. Here they had several meetings with Henry II initially at Reading, afterwards at London (consecrating the church at the new Hospitallers&#x27; priory and headquarters at Clerkenwell). The king then accompanied the mission to France, where a further meeting was held in early May 1185 with Philip II and it was agreed to send both men and money to the Holy Land. This did not satisfy Heraclius, who had hoped to take back with him either Henry himself or one of his sons. Henry had promised to go on crusade years before after the murder of Thomas Becket; Heraclius reminded him of the vow and declared him and his children to be of the devil when Henry chose to stay at home.

===England===
While in England, Heraclius consecrated the Temple Church in London, the English headquarters of the Knights Templar; for which act he is perhaps best remembered in England today. The chronicler Ralph Niger reports that on this mission Eraclius offered the kingship of Jerusalem to Philip II of France and Henry II of England (but both turned him down) and to any other prince he came across. Ralph claimed that Heraclius&#x27;s enormous retinue and opulent dress offended the sensibilities of many westerners, who felt they were not befitting a patriarch; surely if the east was so wealthy, no help was needed from the west. It may be, however, that he was unprepared for the Byzantine style of dress favoured by the court of Jerusalem since Amalric I&#x27;s marriage to Maria Comnena. Other chroniclers, Peter of Blois, Gerald of Wales, Herbert of Bosham and Rigord, were more impressed by the Patriarch&#x27;s spiritual qualities, describing him in phrases such as &quot;&quot;vir sanctus et prudens&quot;, &quot;vir sanctus&quot; and &quot;vitae sanctitatae non inferior&quot;&quot;.

==Return==
Heraclius returned to Jerusalem late in 1185. Baldwin IV had meanwhile died and had been succeeded as King by his young nephew, Baldwin V. The boy king died in summer 1186. The heir was his mother Sibylla, but her husband, Guy of Lusignan, a relative newcomer to the kingdom, was widely disliked by the nobility. It was agreed that Sibylla would be crowned only after she had divorced Guy; in return she insisted on choosing her new husband for herself, with the understanding that the husband she chose would become king. Heraclius crowned her. To the astonishment of the assembled nobility she took the crown and placed it on Guy&#x27;s head, with the words (as given by Roger of Howden), &quot;I choose you as king, and my lord, and lord of the land of Jerusalem, because those whom God has joined no man must separate.&quot; No one dared to object, and Heraclius anointed Guy King of Jerusalem.

==Defense of Jerusalem==

In 1187, Saladin invaded the kingdom, and when Guy marched out to meet him, he asked Heraclius to march along with him at the head of the army with the relic of the True Cross. As Heraclius was ill, the bishop of Acre took his place. Despite the relic, Saladin inflicted a crippling defeat on them at the Battle of Hattin on July 4, capturing the king. Heraclius&#x27; report of the battle and its immediate aftermath, addressed to Pope Urban III, survives; according to the &quot;Chronicle of Ernoul&quot; &quot;Pope Urban, who was at Ferrara, died of grief when he heard the news&quot;. In the letter, he said that, without external aid, both Jerusalem and Tyre would fall within six months.

In Jerusalem Heraclius urged Balian of Ibelin to lead the defence of the city against Saladin. He ordered the stripping of the silver from the edicule in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre to strike coins with which to pay the city&#x27;s defenders. But Jerusalem was finally forced to capitulate on October 2. It was Heraclius who advised Balian to come to terms rather than fight to the death, which, he argued, would condemn the city&#x27;s women and children to slavery and forced conversion. Heraclius helped Balian negotiate the surrender with Saladin, who allowed him and most of the other Christians leave the city unharmed.

He and Balian had organised, and contributed to, a collection of 30,000 bezants to ransom the poorer citizens. This paid the ransoms for about 18,000 people, but another 15,000 people still needed to be paid for. Heraclius and Balian offered themselves as hostages in exchange for them, but Saladin refused, and so these remaining citizens were enslaved. The two men led the last party of refugees from the city at the end of the 40-day ransom period (mid-late November).

Saladin&#x27;s secretary Imad al-Din al-Isfahani claimed that Heraclius stripped the gold reliquaries from the churches on the Temple Mount, and carried away cartloads of treasure with him. 

After the capture of Jerusalem, Heraclius sought refuge in Antioch, together with the queen. He then took part in the Siege of Acre, where his arrival heartened the army. Like so many others, he died of disease during the Third Crusade in the winter of 1190–1191.

==Fiction==
To date, the fictional representations of Heraclius are all derived from the negative portrayal in the &quot;Old French Continuation of William of Tyre&quot;: see Gotthold Ephraim Lessing&#x27;s &quot;Nathan der Weise&quot;, Zofia Kossak-Szczucka&#x27;s &quot;Król trędowaty&quot; (&quot;The Leper King&quot;), Manuel Mujica Láinez&#x27;s &quot;El unicornio&quot; (&quot;The Wandering Unicorn&quot;), Graham Shelby&#x27;s &quot;Knights of Dark Renown&quot; and Jan Guillou&#x27;s &quot;The Knight Templar&quot;. As played by Jon Finch in the 2005 movie &quot;Kingdom of Heaven&quot;, he is an entirely cowardly and bigoted figure. In the Director&#x27;s Cut, Baldwin IV is even depicted as refusing the &quot;viaticum&quot; from him.

<doc id="759193" wikidata="Q519874" url="?curid=759193" title="Tempranillo">
<text>Tempranillo (also known as Ull de Llebre, Cencibel, Tinto Fino and Tinta del Pais in Spain, Aragonez or Tinta Roriz in Portugal, and several other synonyms elsewhere) is a black grape variety widely grown to make full-bodied red wines in its native Spain. Its name is the diminutive of the Spanish &quot;temprano&quot; (&quot;early&quot;), a reference to the fact that it ripens several weeks earlier than most Spanish red grapes. Tempranillo has been grown on the Iberian Peninsula since the time of Phoenician settlements. It is the main grape used in Rioja, and is often referred to as Spain&#x27;s noble grape. The grape has been planted throughout the globe&#x27;s wine regions.

In 2015, Tempranillo was the fourth most widely planted wine grape variety worldwide with under vine, of which 87% was in Spain where it is the most planted red grape variety.

Unlike more aromatic red wine varieties like Cabernet Sauvignon, Sangiovese and Pinot noir, Tempranillo has a relatively neutral profile so it is often blended with other varieties, such as Grenache and Carignan (known in Rioja as Mazuelo), or aged for extended periods in oak where the wine easily takes on the flavor of the barrel. Varietal examples of Tempranillo usually exhibit flavors of plum and strawberries.

Tempranillo is an early ripening variety that tends to thrive in chalky vineyard soils such as those of the Ribera del Duero region of Spain. In Portugal, where the grape is known as Tinta Roriz and Aragonez, it is blended with others to produce port wine.

== History and mutation ==
In 2012, Tempranillo was discovered to be a natural cross between Albillo Mayor and a forgotten grape variety called Benedicto. Tempranillo used to be thought to be related to the Pinot noir grape. According to legend, Cistercian monks left Pinot noir cuttings at monasteries along their pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela. However, ampelographic studies have shown no genetic connection between the cultivars.

Spanish cultivation of &quot;Vitis vinifera&quot;, the common ancestor of almost all vines in existence today, began in earnest with Phoenician settlement in the southern provinces. Later, according to the Roman writer Columella, wines were grown all over Spain; yet there are only scattered references to the name &quot;Tempranillo&quot;. Ribera del Duero wine making extends back over 2,000 years, as evidenced by the 66-metre mosaic of Bacchus, the Roman god of wine, that was unearthed in 1972, at Baños de Valdearados.

It is possible that this grape was introduced to the Western Hemisphere by the Spanish Conquistadors in the 17th century, as certain Criolla varieties in Argentina have a closer genetic relationship to Tempranillo than to a small handful of other European varieties against which the Criolla varieties were tested. Despite its apparent fragility, Tempranillo travelled widely during the 20th century and, following much trial and error, has become established throughout the world. In 1905, Frederic Bioletti brought Tempranillo to California where it received a cool reception not only due to the encroaching era of Prohibition, but also because of the grape&#x27;s dislike of hot, dry climates. It was much later, during the 1980s, that Californian Tempranillo wine production began to flourish, following the establishment of suitably mountainous sites. Production in this area has more than doubled since 1993.

During the 1990s, Tempranillo started experiencing a renaissance in wine production worldwide. This surge began partly as a result of the efforts of a &#x27;new wave&#x27; of Spanish growers who showed that it was possible to produce wines of great character and quality in areas outside of the Rioja region. One result of this has been that Tempranillo varietal wines have become more common, especially in the better-suited, cooler Spanish regions like Ribera del Duero, Navarra, and Penedès (DO). During the 1990s, growers in Australia and South Africa started significant Tempranillo plantations.

== Viticulture ==

Tempranillo is a black grape with a thick skin. It grows best at relatively high altitudes, but it also can tolerate a much warmer climate. With regard to Tempranillo&#x27;s production in various climates, wine expert Oz Clarke notes:
In the Ribera del Duero the average July temperature is around 21.4° Celsius (70.5° Fahrenheit), though temperatures in the middle of the day in the lower valley can jump as high as 40 °C (104 °F). At night the region experiences a dramatic diurnal temperature variation, with temperatures dropping by as much as 16 °C (30 °F) from the daytime high. The Tempranillo grape is one of the few grapes that can adapt and thrive in continental Mediterranean climates like this.

Pests and diseases are a serious problem for this grape variety, since it has little resistance to either. The grape forms compact, cylindrical bunches of spherical, deep blue-black fruit with a colourless pulp. The leaves are large with five overlapping lobes.

The Tempranillo root absorbs potassium easily, which facilitates pH levels of 3.6 in the pulp and 4.3 in the skin when it reaches maturity. If it absorbs too much potassium, the must becomes salified (increased levels of salt), which slows the disappearance of malic acid, resulting in a higher pH. The skin does not present any herbaceous characters. The grape is very susceptible to inclement weather, contracting when there is a drought and swelling when there is too much humidity. The swelling has a negative effect on quality since it affects the colour of the wine. The effects of the weather are attenuated in places with limestone because of the effect of the clay and humidity in the roots; the effects are worse in sandy areas, as well as for vines that are less than twelve years old, as the roots are generally too superficial.

== Wines ==

Tempranillo wines are ruby red in colour, while aromas and flavours can include berries, plum, tobacco, vanilla, leather and herb. Often making up as much as 90% of a blend, Tempranillo is less frequently bottled as a single varietal. Being low in both acidity and sugar content, it is most commonly blended with Grenache (known as &quot;Garnacha&quot; in Spain), Carignan (known as &quot;Mazuela&quot; in Spain), Graciano, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon. Blending the grape with Carignan makes a brighter and more acidic wine. Tempranillo is the major component of the typical Rioja blends and constitutes 90-100% of Ribera del Duero wines. In Australia, Tempranillo is blended with Grenache and Shiraz, also known as Syrah. In Portugal, where it is known as &quot;Tinta Roriz&quot;, it is a major grape in the production of some Port wines.

== Regions ==
=== Spain ===
Spain grows 87% of the world&#x27;s Tempranillo, and it is Spain&#x27;s most planted red grape variety with grown in 2015, accounting for 42% of the red grape plantings, surpassed only by the white grape variety Airén. Tempranillo is native to northern Spain and widely cultivated as far south as Andalusia. The two major regions that grow Tempranillo are Rioja, in north central Spain, and Ribera del Duero, which lies a little farther to the south. Substantial quantities are also grown in the Penedès, Navarra and Valdepeñas regions.

Tempranillo is known under a number of local synonyms in different regions of Spain: &quot;Cencibel&quot; and &quot;Tinto Fino&quot; are used in several regions, and it is known as &quot;Tinta del País&quot; in Ribera del Duero and the surrounding area, &quot;Tinta de Toro&quot; in Toro, and &quot;Ull de llebre&quot; in Catalonia.

=== Portugal ===
The grape plays a role in the production of wines in two regions of Portugal, central Alentejo and Douro. In Alentejo Central, it is known as Aragonez and used in red table wine blends of variable quality, while in the Douro, it is known as Tinta Roriz and mainly used in blends to make port wine.

=== New World production ===

Tempranillo arrived in California bearing the name Valdepeñas, and it was grown in the Central Valley at the turn of the 20th century. Since the climate of the Central Valley was not ideal for the grape, it was used as a blending grape for jug wine. California has since started to use it for fine wines, particularly in Napa and Monterey. In Texas, the soils of the High Plains and Hill Country have been compared to those of northern Spain. Tempranillo has been well received in Texas and has grown to be considered the state&#x27;s signature grape.

In Oregon, the grape was introduced by Earl Jones of Abacela Vineyards and Winery, in the Umpqua Valley AVA. Their climate (hot during the summer day, and cool overnight) seems to be perfect for the Tempranillo grape. In Australia Tempranillo is grown in the McLaren Vale region, and also North East Victoria. Tempranillo has also been introduced by some wine producers in Thailand. The varietal is extensively grown in Argentina, Chile, and Mexico.

In Washington state, Tempranillo was one of the varieties pioneered in the state by Red Willow Vineyard in the Yakima Valley AVA with its first commercial planting of the variety in 1993.

<doc id="759199" wikidata="Q1760473" url="?curid=759199" title="Principality of Abkhazia">
<text>The Principality of Abkhazia () emerged as a separate feudal entity in the 15th-16th centuries, amid the civil wars in the Kingdom of Georgia that concluded with the dissolution of the unified Georgian monarchy. The principality retained a degree of autonomy under Ottoman and then Russian rule, but was eventually absorbed into the Russian Empire in 1864.

==Background==
Abkhazia, as a duchy (&quot;saeristavo&quot;) within the Kingdom of Georgia, was previously referred as the Duchy of Tskhumi was ruled by the house of Sharvashidze since the 12th century. The sources are very scarce about the Abkhazian history of that time. The Genoese established their trading factories along the Abkhazian coastline in the 14th century, but they functioned for a short time. When the Georgian kingdom was embroiled in a bitter civil war in the 1450s, the Sharvashidzes joined a major rebellion against King George VIII of Georgia, which saw him defeated at the hands of the rebels at Chikhori in 1463. As a result, Georgia split into three rival kingdoms and five principalities. The Abkhazian princes were the vassals of the Principality of Mingrelia under the dynasty of Dadiani(-Bediani), which, in turn, was subordinated to the Kingdom of Imereti. The vassalage was, however, largely nominal, and both Mingrelian and Abkhazian rulers not only successfully fought for their independence, but contested borders with each other and with Imereti. The independence of Abkhazia was largely symbolic as the region was generally left alone as the kings of Imereti had their hands full governing their designated area. In 1490, the split became official as Georgia was split by treaty into the Kingdom of Kartli, Imereti, of which Abkhazia was a part, Kakheti and Principality of Samtskhe.

==The 16th-18th centuries==
In the 1570s, the Ottoman navy occupied the fort of Tskhumi, turning it into the Turkish fortress of Suhum-Kale. Abkhazia came under the influence of Turkey and Islam, although Christianity was but slowly replaced and it was not until the second half of the 18th century that the ruling Sharvashidze family embraced Islam. Until then, Abkhazia, secured from large-scale invasions by its mountainous location and impassable forests, had retained independence and profited from commerce in traditional Caucasian commodities, that of slaves not excepted.

Throughout the 16th–18th centuries, the Abkhazian lords were involved in the incessant border conflicts with the Mingrelian princes. As a result, the Sharvashidze potentates were able to expand their possessions in the east, first to the river Ghalidzga, and then to the Enguri, which serves as today&#x27;s boundary between Abkhazia and Georgia proper. After the death of the Abkhazian prince Zegnak circa 1700, his principality was divided among his sons. The oldest brother Rostom established himself as a prince of Abkhazia proper, also known as the Bzyb Abkhazia, on the coast from the modern-day Gagra on the Bzyb River to the Ghalidzga river, with the residence in the village of Lykhny; Jikeshia received Abjua between the Ghalidzga and the Kodori; and Kvapu became a lord of a county on the coast extending from the Ghalidzga to the Inguri, subsequently known as the country of Samurzakan’o after Kvapu&#x27;s son Murzakan. The highlands of Dal-Tzabal (Tzebelda, Tsabal) were without any centralized government, but were dominated by the clan of Marshan. Sadzny, formerly known as Zygia (Jiketi of the Georgian sources) extended north to Abkhazia proper between the modern-day cities of Gagra and Sochi, and was run by Gechba, Arydba and Tsanba clans. These polities included also several minor fiefdoms governed by the representatives of the Sharvashidze-Chachba house or other noble families such as Achba (Anchabadze), Emhaa (Emukhvari), Ziapsh-Ipa, Inal-Ipa, Chabalurkhua and Chkhotua. All these princedoms were more or less dependent on the princes of Abkhazia proper.

==Between the Ottoman and Russian empires==

Kelesh Bey remained neutral between the interests of the Russian Empire and the Ottoman Empire. The first attempt to enter into relation with Russia was made by the said Keilash Bey in 1803, shortly after the incorporation of eastern Georgia into the expanding Tsarist empire (1801). When the Ottomans tried to subjugate Abkhazia and sent a naval squadron to its coast in 1806 Kelesh Bey gathered twenty-five thousand soldiers. Seeing that the fortress of Sukhum-Kale was well-defended the Turkish forces ships sailed back. After the assassination of this prince by his son Aslan-Bey on May 2, 1808, the pro-Ottoman orientation prevailed but for a short time. On July 2, 1810, the Russian Marines stormed Suhum-Kale and had Aslan-Bey replaced with his rival brother, Sefer-Bey (1810–1821), who had converted to Christianity and assumed the name of George. Abkhazia joined the Russian empire as an autonomous principality.

However, George&#x27;s rule, as well of his successors, was limited to the neighbourhood of Suhum-Kale and the Bzyb area garrisoned by the Russians while the other parts had remained under the rule of the Muslim nobles. The next Russo-Turkish war strongly enhanced the Russian positions, leading to a further split in the Abkhaz elite, mainly along religious divisions. During the Crimean War (1853–1856), Russian forces had to evacuate Abkhazia and Prince Michael (1822–1864) seemingly switched to the Ottomans. Later on, the Russian presence strengthened and the highlanders of Western Caucasia were finally subjugated by Russia in 1864. The autonomy of Abkhazia, which had functioned as a pro-Russian &quot;buffer zone&quot; in this troublesome region, was no more needed to the Tsarist government and the rule of the Sharvashidze came to an end; in November 1864, Prince Michael was forced to renounce his rights and resettle in Voronezh. Abkhazia was incorporated in the Russian Empire as a special military province of Suhum-Kale which was transformed, in 1883, into an &quot;okrug&quot; as part of the Kutais &quot;Guberniya&quot;.

==Languages==

Principal language of governance in the principality of Abkhazia was Georgian language.

Evliya Çelebi in his work mentions that the Sharvashidze dynasty spoke Mingrelian language &quot;The principal tribe in Abaza are the Chach, who speak Mingrelian, which is spoken on the opposite shore of the Phasus&quot;

Northern Abkhazians who lived in the dol of Sochi and the Sadzen region spoke both their native language, as well as Abaza, Circassian and Ubykh language 

==Lykhny revolt==
In July 1866 an attempt made by the Russian authorities to collect information concerning the economic conditions of the Abkhaz, for the purpose of taxation, led to the Lykhny revolt. The rebels proclaimed Mikheil Sharvashidze&#x27;s son Giorgi as prince and marched on Sukhumi. Only the strong Russian reinforcements led by General Dmitry Ivanovich Svyatopolk-Mirsky were able to suppress the revolt by the same August. The harsh Russian reaction led, subsequently, to a considerable emigration of the Abkhaz &quot;muhajirs&quot; to the Ottoman Empire, especially after the locals took part in the rebellion of the Caucasian mountaineers incited by the landing of Turkish troops in 1877. As a result, many areas became virtually deserted.

<text>Eleanor Anne Ormerod (11 May 182819 July 1901) was a pioneer English entomologist. Based on her studies in agriculture, she became one of the first to define the field of agricultural entomology. She published an influential series of articles on useful insects and pests in the &quot;Gardeners&#x27; Chronicle&quot; and the &quot;Agricultural Gazette&quot; along with annual reports from 1877 to 1900&quot;.&quot; These annual reports were produced by summarizing information provided by her network of correspondents from across Britain. Belonging to the landed gentry, she worked as an honorary consulting entomologist with the Royal Agricultural Society of England and received no pay for any of her work. She also promoted the use of paris green as an insecticide and called for the extermination of the house sparrow.

==Life==

Eleanor was a daughter of Sarah and George Ormerod, FRS, author of &quot;The History of Cheshire&quot;, and was born at Sedbury Park, Gloucestershire. From early childhood insects were her interest and she had great opportunities to study them in the large estate where she grew up. While her brothers went to Rugby School, studying under Thomas Arnold, she was tutored at home by her mother. She took an interest in insects which became more serious on 12 March 1852 when a rare insect led her to Stephen&#x27;s &quot;Manual of British beetles&quot;. She acquired a Pillischer microscope around 1863 and began to make more keen observations. She studied agriculture in general and became a local authority on it. When, in 1868, the Royal Horticultural Society began forming a collection of insect pests of the farm for practical purposes, Ormerod contributed greatly to it, and was awarded the Flora medal of the Society.

In 1877 she published a pamphlet, &quot;Notes for Observations on Injurious Insects&quot;, which was a questionnaire distributed to interested persons, who in turn sent in the results of their researches, resulting in a series of &quot;Annual Series of Reports on Injurious Insects and Farm Pests&quot;. She was elected to the Entomological Society of London in 1878. In 1881, Ormerod published a special report on the turnip-fly, and in 1882 was appointed consulting entomologist to the Royal Agricultural Society, a post she held until 1892. For several years she was lecturer on scientific entomology at the Royal Agricultural College, Cirencester.

Her fame was not confined to England; she received silver and gold medals from the University of Moscow for her models of insects injurious to plants, and her treatise on &quot;The Injurious Insects of South Africa&quot; showed how wide was her range. In 1899, she received a silver medal from the .

Her works on natural history were widely cited and she undertook brave experiments:
Among other works are the &quot;Cobden Journals&quot;, &quot;Manual of Injurious Insects&quot;, and &quot;Handbook of Insects injurious to Orchard and Bush Fruits&quot;. Almost the last honour which fell to her was the honorary degree of LLD of the University of Edinburgh in March 1900—a unique distinction, for she was the first woman upon whom the university had conferred this degree. The Dean of the law faculty summarised Ormerod&#x27;s contributions:
Ormerod was the first woman to be honored with a Fellowship in the Meteorological Society (1878). Her interest in meteorology was possibly inspired by her brother George Wareing Ormerod who was involved in setting up a meteorological observatory at Teignmouth. He became a Fellow in 1874. Eleanor collated and published a private weather journal from a Miss Caroline Molesworth of Cobham, Surrey in 1880 as &quot;The Cobham Journals&quot;. It consisted of more than 75,000 made from 1825 to 1850 including notes on weather and plant life.

Along with W.B. Tegetmeier, she called for the extermination of the house sparrow in 1897. She was opposed, most vocally by Edith Carrington, who was also involved in protectionist and anti-vivisectionist movements. Carrington argued that nature was complex and that any actions would have repercussions, stating that &quot;&#x27;it is impossible to do one thing onl&quot;y.&#x27; A reverend J.E. Walker wrote requesting her not to &quot;&#x27;steel&quot;&#x27; her &#x27;&quot;compassionate, womanly heart&quot;&#x27; with her scientific studies but rather fulfil her duty as a woman through philanthropic works.

She was a strong advocate for introducing Paris Green to Britain from North America. It is an arsenic-derived compound and broad spectrum insecticide that kills most insects, including pollinators and predators, which then gives free rein to pests, creating a vicious cycle of dependence on chemical insecticides. It was later identified as a dangerous product.

On the death of her father she and her sisters moved to Torquay where their uncle Dr Mere Latham lived but relocated after three years to Spring Grove, Isleworth to be near to Kew Gardens where she had close friends in Sir Joseph and Lady Hooker, the garden&#x27;s director. In 1887 she moved to Torrington House, 47 Holywell Hill, St Albans, Hertfordshire with her sister Georgiana Elizabeth Ormerod. She died there on 19 July 1901 following a kidney illness. The building bears a plaque in her honour. She was buried in the same grave as her sister Georgiana (who was a scientific illustrator), at Hatfield Road Cemetery in St Albans.

*Report of observations of attack of turnip fly in 1881 (1882)
*Manual of injurious insects with methods of prevention and remedy for their attacks to food crops, forest trees and fruit: to which is appended a short introduction to entomology (1890)
*Paris-green (or Emerald-green): its uses, and methods for its application, as a means of destruction of orchard moth caterpillars (1891)
*Handbook of insects injurious to orchards and bush fruits with means of prevention and remedy (1898)
*Flies injurious to stock: being life-histories and means of prevention of a few kinds commonly injurious, with special observations on ox warble or bot fly (1900)
*Her autobiography &quot;Eleanor Ormerod, Ll. D., economic entomologist: autobiography and correspondence&quot; (1904) digitised and available online.

==Recognition==

Virginia Woolf wrote a story &quot;Miss Ormerod&quot; in 1924 that was based on her life. Ormerod&#x27;s portrait hangs at the foot of the main south-east stair in Old College, University of Edinburgh, proudly proclaiming her as Edinburgh&#x27;s first woman honorary graduate. In 2017, the University of Edinburgh named their research cloud computing service &quot;&#x27;Eleanor&quot;&#x27; after her.

Ormerod&#x27;s name was also commemorated, along with a series of other biologists, in the name of the RepRap Ormerod 3D printer.
