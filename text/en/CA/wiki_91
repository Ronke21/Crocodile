<text>Alfred Nu Steele (April 24, 1901 – April 19, 1959) was an American soft drink businessman who was the president and later chairman of the board of Pepsi-Cola Company from 1950 until his sudden death in 1959.

==Personal life==
Alfred Nu Steele was born on April 24, 1901, in Nashville, Tennessee. He was the son of Edgar Alfred Steele, a teacher, and his wife Fannie Bartrem. His middle name &quot;Nu&quot; was an homage to his father&#x27;s fraternity &quot;Sigma Nu&quot;. The family would later move to Missouri. Steele graduated from Northwestern University in 1923, where he played football, and became an ad executive after college. He enjoyed jazz music.

Steele’s first marriage was to Marjorie Mabel Garvey on December 17, 1924, in Cook County, Illinois. They had one child named Sally Ostin Steele. Sally Steele married Lieutenant John D. Comer on November 29, 1955, at the MacArthur Chapel in Tokyo, Japan.

Alfred Steele would later marry Lillian Nelson in 1946 and they had a son named Alfred Nelson Steele in 1949. They divorced in 1955. His son would go on to marry a woman named Madeline Spence Haldeman in Montana. 

Steele’s third wife was American film actress Joan Crawford; he was her fourth husband. They married spontaneously on May 10, 1955, at the Flamingo Hotel in Las Vegas. Judge John Mendoza officiated. Steele took on the father role for Crawford&#x27;s four adopted children - Christina, Christopher, and twins Cathy and Cynthia (&quot;Cindy&quot;). The family would be seen at events throughout the marriage and go on vacations together. The twins grew closer to Steele; he was listed as Cathy Crawford&#x27;s father in her 2020 obituary.

Following Steele&#x27;s death, Herbert L. Barnet, Steele&#x27;s handpicked successor as chairman and CEO, appointed Crawford to the board of directors. In her later career, product placement for Pepsi was included in several films including &quot;Strait-Jacket&quot; (1964) and &quot;Berserk!&quot; (1967). Crawford would remain on the Pepsi-Cola board of directors until 1973. “I thought I could be different, that I could have it all,&quot; said Joan Crawford after Steele died. &quot;And I did — for a little while — with Alfred. I’ll always treasure our brief time together.” 

In 1956, the couple moved to New York, purchasing and merging two top-floor apartments at 2 East 70th Street into a spacious eight-room family penthouse with views of Central Park. Broadway columnists dubbed it &quot;Taj Joan.&quot; While work was being completed, they stayed at the Waldorf Astoria. Construction took a year and cost $387,011.65 USD ($4.06 million USD adjusted for inflation in 2023). The apartment was decorated by Crawford’s close friend, interior designer William Haines, totaling an extra $80,000.00 USD ($840,000.00 USD adjusted for inflation in 2023). The apartment was paid for by Pepsi as a loan with 6% interest; the loan was repaid in 1958.

==Career==
Alfred Steele began as a geologist, and went on to work for the Chicago Tribune, Standard Oil of Indiana, and D&#x27;arcy Advertising Company. 

While working for the Union Bed &amp; Spring Company, Steele conceived the &quot;Sono-Meter&quot;, a device that measured the energy lost while people tossed and turned on an uncomfortable mattress. The company&#x27;s sales increased 80% within nine months.

Later, Steele became vice president of marketing for The Coca-Cola Company on June 14, 1945. While at Coca-Cola, he earned the nickname &quot;Pally&quot; as he often remarked, &quot;Let&#x27;s try this out, Pally&quot;.

In 1949, Steele took over as vice president of Pepsi-Cola, and as president later that year. In 1950, he became CEO, appointing Herbert L. Barnet as the new president. In a five-year span, Steele helped steer profits up 112% compared to Coca-Cola which had only climbed 28%. Steele defined his strategy as “Beat Coke”. Under his leadership, the company launched massive advertising campaigns and sales promotions during the &#x27;50s, resulting in an 11-fold increase in net earnings. Sales tripled between 1955 and 1957. As a result, Pepsi-Cola became Coca-Cola&#x27;s primary competitor.

While opening a plant in Atlanta, Steele remarked Coca-Cola was not Pepsi&#x27;s biggest competitor - tea and coffee were. He added, &quot;It&#x27;s a tribute to the Coca-Cola Company that the number of its former employees are on the management team helping Pepsi-Cola move up.&quot; 

Steele is credited with helping push the change of the old Pepsi slogan &quot;twice as much for a nickel, too&quot; stating it was a liability to the company, reducing Pepsi to the &quot;poor man&#x27;s Coca-Cola&quot;. He pushed for a focus on quality, not quantity. Other initiatives for Pepsi were the adaptation of vending machines, global expansion for selling and producing, and for the parent company to help arrange funds with banks for bottlers to buy equipment with no down payment. In 1957, Crawford and Steele toured Europe, the Middle East, and Africa for Pepsi-Cola’s recent expansion.

Steele introduced new cost accounting methods and helped bottlers purchase new trucks and equipment. He further reduced the sugar content and unsweetened the syrup of Pepsi products, and introduced Pepsi to developing countries. Under Steele&#x27;s leadership, Pepsi built a new headquarters at 500 Park Avenue in New York City.

Once during a meeting, a colleague suggested that Steele should use his wife’s star power to increase sales. Steele refused, but Crawford said she was happy to assist if it would benefit her husband. According to Steele, &quot;I hate to use my wife to help me sell, but let&#x27;s face it — she does. On these trips, most of our business is done through top government officials. At those levels, Crawford is fabulous.&quot; Some credit this as one of the first instances of using celebrity power to sell products. To quote a 1956 New York Times article: &quot;Together [Alfred Steele and Joan Crawford] constitute one of the most successful teams in America&#x27;s public and private life.&quot;

In 1957, 11-year-old Chester Arnold Jr. was given five shares of Pepsi, but after watching &quot;The Solid Gold Cadillac&quot;, the boy was compelled to write to Steele. In the letter, Arnold asked Steele if having the shares meant he was “crooked like those people in the movie.” Steele wrote back, inviting Chester and his family to New York to meet him and see the company. Steele supplied accommodations for the family at the Waldorf Astoria. For three days, the family was shown around the city and spent time with Steele and Crawford. They attended board meetings and were escorted by police to one of the most elaborate ribbon-cutting ceremonies Pepsi-Cola hosted at the time.

Alfred Steele was selected as chairman of the 1959 fund campaign of the National Multiple Sclerosis Society on November 6, 1958. He died before the event. Joan Crawford was named chairman in his place. The fund was renamed the &quot;Alfred N. Steele Memorial Campaign for the MS Hope Chest.&quot;

==Death==

On the morning of April 19, 1959, Steele was found on the floor next to his bed by Crawford, who immediately called a doctor. A traumatized Crawford covered Steele in blankets and yelled &quot;Get warm, get warm!&quot; The physician who examined Steele pronounced him dead of a massive heart attack. His death came as a shock to his colleagues, friends, and family, who praised him for his leadership and vision at Pepsi-Cola.

Steele’s funeral was held April 22, 1959, at New York&#x27;s Saint Thomas Episcopal Church. Nearly 1200 people attended. His remains were interred in Ferncliff Cemetery and Mausoleum in Hartsdale, Westchester, New York. Upon Crawford&#x27;s death in 1977, the couple&#x27;s ashes were interred in a crypt together.

Two years after Steele&#x27;s death, on January 8, 1961, Crawford and twins Cathy and Cynthia unveiled a plaque honoring Steele at the Albert Einstein Medical Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

<text>Stefanos Stefanopoulos (; 3 July 1898 – 4 October 1982) was a Greek politician, and served as Prime Minister of Greece from 1965 to 1966.

Stefanopoulos was born in Pyrgos, Elis. He was a moderate conservative and served as foreign minister during Alexandros Papagos&#x27; government. He even served as acting Prime Minister for a day after the latter&#x27;s death on 4 October 1955.

On 17 September 1965, he became Prime Minister of Greece during the period of the &quot;Apostasia&quot;, supported by conservatives and defecting members of the Centre Union party. Unable to gain a parliamentary vote of confidence, his government fell on 22 December 1966. He stayed away from politics while the Greek military junta ruled 1967 until 1974. He tried to make a comeback into politics by forming a right-wing party but did not succeed in being elected in 1977.

He died from heart and respiratory issues, aged 84, in Athens.

<doc id="788950" wikidata="Q712715" url="?curid=788950" title="Vilhjalmur Stefansson">
<text>Vilhjalmur Stefansson (November 3, 1879 – August 26, 1962) was an Arctic explorer and ethnologist. He was born in Manitoba, Canada.

==Early life and education==
Stefansson, born William Stephenson, was born at Arnes, Manitoba, Canada, in 1879. His parents had emigrated from Iceland to Manitoba two years earlier. After losing two children during a period of devastating flooding, the family moved to Dakota Territory in 1880 and homesteaded a mile southwest of the village of Mountain in Thingvalla Township of Pembina County.

He was educated at the universities of North Dakota and of Iowa (A.B., 1903). During his college years, in 1899, he changed his name to Vilhjalmur Stefansson. He studied anthropology at the graduate school of Harvard University, where for two years he was an instructor.

==Early explorations==
In 1904 and 1905, Stefansson did archaeological research in Iceland. Recruited by Ejnar Mikkelsen and Ernest de Koven Leffingwell for their Anglo-American Polar Expedition, he lived with the Inuit of the Mackenzie River Delta during the winter of 1906–1907, returning alone across country via the Porcupine and Yukon rivers. 

Under the auspices of the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, he and Dr. Rudolph Martin Anderson undertook the ethnological survey of the central Arctic coasts of the shores of North America from 1908 to 1912.

In 1908, Stefansson made a decision that would affect the rest of his time in Alaska: he hired Natkusiak, an Inuk guide, who would remain with him as his primary guide for the rest of his Alaska expeditions. At the time he met Natkusiak, the Inuk guide was working for Capt. George B. Leavitt, a Massachusetts whaling ship captain and friend of Stefansson&#x27;s who sometimes brought him replenishments of supplies from the American Museum of Natural History.

Christian Klengenberg is first credited to have introduced the term &quot;Blonde Eskimo&quot; to Stefansson just before Stefansson&#x27;s visit to the Inuit inhabiting southwestern Victoria Island, Canada, in 1910. Stefansson, though, preferred the term “Copper Inuit“ (although there was already a group of people known by that name) . Adolphus Greely in 1912 first compiled the sightings recorded in earlier literature of fair-haired Arctic natives and in 1912 published them in the &quot;National Geographic Magazine&quot; entitled &quot;The Origin of Stefansson&#x27;s Blonde Eskimo&quot;. Newspapers subsequently popularised the term &quot;Blonde Eskimo&quot;, which caught more readers&#x27; attention despite Stefansson&#x27;s preference for “Copper Inuit”. Stefansson later referenced Greely&#x27;s work in his writings and the term &quot;Blonde Eskimo&quot; became applied to sightings of fair-haired Inuit from as early as the 17th century.

==Loss of the &quot;Karluk&quot; and rescue of survivors==

Stefansson organized and directed the Canadian Arctic Expedition, 1913–1916 to explore the regions west of Parry Archipelago for the Government of Canada. Three ships, the &quot;Karluk&quot;, the &quot;Mary Sachs&quot;, and the &quot;Alaska&quot; were employed.

Stefansson left the main ship, the &quot;Karluk&quot;, when it became marooned in the ice in August/September 1913. Stefansson&#x27;s explanation was that he and five other expedition members left to go hunting to provide fresh meat for the crew. However, William Laird McKinley and others who were left on the ship suspected Stefansson left deliberately, anticipating that the ship would be carried off by moving ice, as indeed happened. The ship, with Captain Robert Bartlett of Newfoundland and 24 other expedition members aboard, drifted westward with the ice and was eventually crushed. It sank on January 11, 1914. Four of the survivors made their way to Herald Island but eventually died there, possibly from carbon monoxide poisoning, before they could be rescued. Four others, including Alistair Mackay who had been part of the Nimrod Expedition (British Antarctic Expedition, 1907–09), led by Sir Ernest Shackleton, tried reaching Wrangel Island on their own but perished. The remaining members of the expedition, under command of Captain Bartlett, made their way to Wrangel Island where three of them died. Bartlett and the Inuk hunter Kataktovik made their way across sea ice to Siberia to get help. The remaining survivors were picked up by the &quot;King &amp; Winge&quot;, an American fishing schooner and the USRC &quot;Bear&quot;, a cutter of the United States Revenue Cutter Service in September 1914.

Stefansson resumed his explorations by sledge over the Beaufort Sea, leaving Collinson Point, Alaska in April 1914. A supporting sledge turned back offshore, but he and two men continued onward on one sledge, living largely by his rifle on polar game for 96 days until his party reached the &quot;Mary Sachs&quot; in the autumn. Stefansson continued exploring until 1918.

==Wrangel Island fiasco==
In 1921, he encouraged and planned an expedition for four young men to colonise Wrangel Island north of Siberia, where the eleven survivors of the 22 men on the &quot;Karluk&quot; had lived from March to September 1914. Stefansson had designs for forming an exploration company that would be geared towards individuals interested in touring the Arctic island.

Stefansson originally wanted to claim Wrangel Island for the Canadian government. However, due to the dangerous outcome of his initial trip to the island, the government refused to assist with the expedition. He then wanted to claim the land for Britain but the British government rejected the claim when it was made by the young men of the expedition. The raising of the British flag on Wrangel Island, an acknowledged Russian territory, caused an international incident.

The four young men Stefansson recruited, Americans, Frederick Maurer, E. Lorne Knight, and Milton Galle, and Canadian Allan Crawford, were inadequately experienced and ill-equipped for the expedition. All perished on the island or in an attempt to get help from Siberia across the frozen Chukchi Sea. The only survivors were Ada Blackjack, an Iñupiat woman the men had hired in Nome, Alaska as a seamstress and taken with them as a cook, and the expedition&#x27;s cat, Vic. Ada Blackjack had taught herself survival skills and cared for the last man on the island, E. Lorne Knight, until he died of scurvy. Blackjack was not rescued until 1923, having spent a total of two years on Wrangel Island. Stefansson drew the ire of the public and the families of the men who perished for having sent such ill-equipped young explorers to Wrangel. His reputation was severely tainted by this disaster, along with that of the &quot;Karluk&quot;.

==Discoveries==
Stefansson produced the first written records of several places, such as Brock, Mackenzie King, Borden, Meighen, and Lougheed Islands and the edge of the continental shelf. He extended the works of Francis Leopold McClintock. From April 1914 to June 1915 he lived on the ice pack. Stefansson continued his explorations leaving from Herschel Island on August 23, 1915.

On January 30, 1920, &quot;The Pioche Record&quot; reported that Stefansson discovered a lost cache from the Leopold McClintock 1853 expedition on Melville Island. Clothing and food from the cache was in excellent condition despite the harsh Arctic conditions.

In 1921, he was awarded the Founder&#x27;s Medal of the Royal Geographical Society for his explorations of the Arctic. He was also an elected member of the American Philosophical Society and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

==Later career==

Stefansson remained a well-known explorer for the rest of his life. Late in life, through his affiliation with Dartmouth College (he was Director of Polar Studies), he became a major figure in the establishment of the United States Army&#x27;s Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory (CRREL) in Hanover, New Hampshire. CRREL-supported research, often conducted in winter on the forbidding summit of Mount Washington, was key to developing matériel and doctrine to support alpine conflict.

Stefansson joined the Explorers Club in 1908, four years after its founding. He later served as Club President twice: 1919–1922 and 1937–1939. In the all-male Club, the Board drew attention under Stefansson&#x27;s reign when it put forth an amendment to its by-laws in 1938 that read: &quot;A Woman&#x27;s Roll of Honor shall be instituted to which the Board of Directors may name women of the United States and Canada in recognition of the noteworthy achievements and writings in the field of the Club&#x27;s interests, primarily exploration.&quot; Perhaps to comfort fellow members, the article added, &quot;This Woman&#x27;s Roll of Honor shall be quite outside the Club&#x27;s organisation but shall correspond in dignity to the Honorary Class of (male) members within it.&quot; His continued support of women in anthropology is demonstrated in his 1939–1941 mentorship of Gitel Steed as she undertook research on diet and subsistence for his two-volume &quot;Lives of the Hunters&quot;, from which she began a dissertation on the topic of hunter-gatherer.

While living in New York City, Stefansson was one of the regulars at Romany Marie&#x27;s Greenwich Village cafés During the years when he and novelist Fannie Hurst were having an affair, they met there when he was in town. In 1940, at the age of 62, he met 28-year-old Evelyn Schwartz at Romany Marie&#x27;s; she became his secretary and they married soon after.

In 1941, he became the third honorary member of the American Polar Society. He served as president of the History of Science Society from 1945–46.

==Legacy==
Stefansson&#x27;s personal papers and collection of Arctic artifacts are maintained and available to the public at the Dartmouth College Library.

Stefansson is frequently quoted as saying that &quot;An adventure is a sign of incompetence...&quot;

Roald Amundsen stated he was &quot;the greatest humbug alive&quot; referring to his mismanagement of the Wrangel Island fiascos.

On May 28, 1986, the United States Postal Service issued a 22 cent postage stamp in his honour.

==Political affiliations==
In the 1930s, pro-Soviet movements were created in the US that aimed primarily to provide support for the Soviet project to establish a Jewish socialist republic in the Birobidzhan region in the far east of the Soviet Union. One of the organizations prominent in this campaign was the American Committee for the Settlement of Jews in Birobidjan (or Ambijan) formed in 1934. A tireless proponent of settlement in Birobidzhan, Stefansson appeared at countless Ambijan meetings, dinners, and rallies, and proved an invaluable resource for the group. Ambijan produced a 50-page Year Book at the end of 1936, full of testimonials and letters of support. Among these was one from Stefansson, who was now also listed as a member of Ambijan&#x27;s Board of Directors and Governors: &quot;The Birobidjan project seems to me to offer a most statesmanlike contribution to the problem of the rehabilitation of eastern and central European Jewry,&quot; he wrote.

Ambijan&#x27;s national conference in New York on November 25–26, 1944 pledged to raise $1 million to support refugees in Stalingrad and Birobidzhan. Prominent guests and speakers included New York Representative Emanuel Celler, Senator Elbert D. Thomas of Utah, and Soviet Ambassador Andrei Gromyko. A public dinner, attended by the delegates and their guests, was hosted by Vilhjalmur and his wife, Evelyn Stefansson. Vilhjalmur was selected as one of two vice-presidents of the organization.

However, with the growing anti-Soviet feeling in the country after World War II, &quot;exposés&quot; of Stefansson began to appear in the press. In August 1951, he was denounced as a communist before a Senate Internal Security subcommittee by Louis F. Budenz, a Communist-turned-Catholic. Stefansson himself may have by then had some second thoughts about Ambijan since his posthumously published autobiography conspicuously made no mention of his work on its behalf. The same is true of his otherwise very-complete obituary in &quot;The New York Times&quot; of August 27, 1962.

==Advocacy of meat-based diet==
Stefansson is reported to have eaten an exclusive meat-based diet during his arctic explorations. During these expeditions, Stefansson ate bear liver, seal liver and raw fish. Stefansson commented that he had become fond of consuming raw fish and fermented whale oil. Raw seal liver has a vitamin C value of up to 35mg.

Stefansson argued that it was possible for people of European descent to live on an Eskimo diet for long periods of time and the reason that explorers had developed scurvy was because they were not following the Eskimo&#x27;s dietary habits. Arctic physiologist Kåre Rodahl has written that Stefansson&#x27;s diet on his arctic explorations should not be confused with the Eskimo diet as the Eskimos in addition to meat and fat also &quot;eat considerable quantities of entrails and plant food in the form of land plants and sea algae&quot; and during the summer, marine algae makes up 50% of their vitamin C supply.

In 1926, Clarence W. Lieb who examined Stefansson stated that he &quot;eats anything placed before him, but his tendency is to eat more meat than the average person. Since returning to civilization, he has had a tendency to constipation and has infrequent colds, but is otherwise never ill&quot;.

Stefansson and his fellow explorer Karsten Anderson agreed to undertake an official study to demonstrate that they could eat an exclusive meat diet for a year. They were observed at a laboratory setting during intervals at Bellevue Hospital. The book &quot;The Unseen Power: Public Relations&quot; states that Pendelton Dudley, once considered the &quot;dean of public relations&quot;, convinced the American Meat Institute to fund the study. The results were published in 1929.

In 1935, Stefansson authored an article in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot; titled &quot;Adventures in Diet&quot; outlining his meat-based diet in the arctic. It was re-published as a booklet by the Institute of American Meat Packers.

<text>Forrest Meredith Tucker (February 12, 1919 – October 25, 1986) was an American actor in both movies and television who appeared in nearly a hundred films. Tucker worked as a vaudeville straight man at the age of fifteen. A mentor provided funds and contacts for a trip to California, where party hostess Cobina Wright persuaded guest Wesley Ruggles to give Tucker a screen test because of Tucker&#x27;s photogenic good looks, thick wavy hair and height of six feet, five inches.

Tucker was a sight reader who needed only one take and his film career started well despite a perception in most Hollywood studios that blond men were not photogenic. He enlisted in the Army during World War II. After twenty years spent mainly in Westerns and action roles, he returned to his roots, showing versatility as a comedic and stage musical actor. In the television series &quot;F Troop&quot;, he became identified with the character of Cavalry Sgt. Morgan O&#x27;Rourke (a manipulative character quite similar to Phil Silvers&#x27; role as MSgt. Ernie Bilko). Tucker struggled with a drinking problem that began to affect his performances in the later years of his career.

==Early life and education==
Tucker was born in Plainfield, Indiana, on February 12, 1919, the son of Forrest A. Tucker and his wife, Doris Heringlake. His mother has been described as an alcoholic. A self-avowed &quot;farm boy&quot;, Tucker began his performing career at age 14 at the 1933 Chicago World&#x27;s Fair, pushing the big wicker tourist chairs by day and singing &quot;Throw Money&quot; at night. 

After his family moved to Washington, D.C., Tucker attracted the attention of Jimmy Lake, the owner of the Old Gaiety Burlesque Theater, by winning its Saturday night amateur contest on consecutive weeks. After his second win, Tucker was hired there at full time as Master of Ceremonies, but left when it was soon discovered that he was underage. 

Tucker graduated from Washington-Lee High School, Arlington, Virginia, near Washington, D.C., in 1938, and, after joining the United States Cavalry, was stationed at Fort Myer in Arlington County, Virginia. However, once again, he was discharged for being underage. He returned to work at the Old Gaiety after his 18th birthday.

==Career==

===Hollywood===
When Lake&#x27;s theater closed for the summer in 1939, a wealthy mentor helped Tucker travel to California and try to break into film acting. He made a successful screen test, and began auditioning for movie roles. In his own estimation, Tucker was in the mold of large &quot;ugly guys&quot; such as Wallace Beery, Ward Bond and Victor McLaglen, rather than a matinee idol. His debut was as a powerfully built farmer who clashes with the hero in &quot;The Westerner&quot; (1940), which starred Gary Cooper. Tucker stood out in a fight scene with Cooper. Tucker had a support role in &quot;The Great Awakening&quot; (1941) for United Artists. Overcoming a feeling in Hollywood that fair hair did not photograph well, he quickly attained leading man status, starring in PRC&#x27;s &quot;Emergency Landing&quot; (1941). He signed a contract with Columbia Pictures.

===Columbia Pictures===
At Columbia Tucker had a support role in one of their Lone Wolf pictures, &quot;Counter-Espionage&quot; (1942), followed by a Boston Blackie entry, &quot;Boston Blackie Goes Hollywood&quot; (1942). He was borrowed by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer for &quot;Keeper of the Flame&quot; with Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn.

===World War II===
Like many other movie actors at the time, Tucker enlisted in the United States Army during World War II; he earned a commission as a second lieutenant. He served in the Signal Corps and was discharged in 1945.

===Post War===
Tucker resumed his acting career at war&#x27;s end. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer borrowed him for the classic film &quot;The Yearling&quot; (1946). Warners borrowed him to play Errol Flynn&#x27;s love rival with Eleanor Parker in &quot;Never Say Goodbye&quot; the same year.

Back at Columbia Pictures, he was in &quot;Coroner Creek&quot; (1948) with Randolph Scott.

===Republic Pictures===
In 1948, Tucker left Columbia and signed with Republic Pictures. His first films for them were &quot;Hellfire&quot; (1949) and &quot;The Last Bandit&quot; (1949) with Wild Bill Elliott. He made &quot;Montana Belle&quot; for Republic with Jane Russell; it was sold to RKO.

Tucker had a role in Republic&#x27;s &quot;Sands of Iwo Jima&quot; (1949), as PFC Thomas, a Marine with a score to settle with John Wayne&#x27;s Sergeant Stryker. He went back to Columbia to support Scott again in &quot;The Nevadan&quot; (1950).

Tucker was promoted to star roles with &quot;California Passage&quot; (1950). He followed this with &quot;Rock Island Trail&quot; (1950).

Tucker was back to supporting actor for &quot;Hoodlum Empire&quot; (1952) then over at Paramount he co-starred with Sterling Hayden in &quot;Flaming Feather&quot; (1952) and supported Charlton Heston in &quot;Pony Express&quot; (1953).

Tucker went to England in support of British film star Margaret Lockwood in &quot;Laughing Anne&quot; (1953), a co-production with Republic.

Back in the United States, he returned to Republic: &quot;San Antone&quot; (1953) with Rod Cameron; &quot;Flight Nurse&quot; (1953) and &quot;Jubilee Trail&quot; (1954) with Joan Leslie.

===England and &quot;Crunch and Des&quot;===
He returned to England to make another with Lockwood, &quot;Trouble in the Glen&quot; (1954), and stayed on to make &quot;Break in the Circle&quot; (1955) for Hammer Films.

Tucker made some films for Allied Artists, &quot;Paris Follies of 1956&quot; (1955) and &quot;Finger Man&quot; (1955) in support of Frank Lovejoy, and then supported Randolph Scott once more in &quot;Rage at Dawn&quot; (1956).

Tucker had a two-year stint on television playing the well-received role of a charter-boat captain in Bermuda in the series &quot;Crunch and Des&quot; from 1955 to 1956 with Sandy Kenyon.

He was top billed in Fox&#x27;s &quot;The Quiet Gun&quot; (1957) and supported Charlton Heston in &quot;Three Violent People&quot; (1957). Hammer Films in Britain asked him back to play the lead in &quot;The Abominable Snowman&quot; (1957). He stayed on in England for &quot;The Strange World of Planet X&quot; (1957) and &quot;The Trollenberg Terror&quot; (1958).

===&quot;Auntie Mame&quot;===
The year 1958 brought another turning point in his career, when he won the role of Beauregard Burnside, Mame&#x27;s first husband in &quot;Auntie Mame&quot;, the highest grossing U.S. film of the year. Tucker showed a flair for light comedy under the direction of Morton DaCosta that had largely been unexplored in his roles in Westerns and science fiction films.

He supported Joel McCrea in &quot;Fort Massacre&quot; (1958) and had the lead in &quot;Counterplot&quot; (1959).

===Stage===
Tucker was cast as Professor Harold Hill in the national touring production of &quot;The Music Man&quot; in 1958 and played the role 2,008 times over the next five years, including a 56-week run at the Shubert Theatre in Chicago.

Following his &quot;Music Man&quot; run, Tucker starred in the Broadway production of &quot;Fair Game for Lovers&quot; (1964).

===Television and &quot;F Troop&quot;===
Tucker turned to television for his most famous role, starring as frontier entrepreneur Sgt. Morgan O&#x27;Rourke in &quot;F Troop&quot; (1965–1967). Though &quot;F Troop&quot; lasted only two seasons on ABC, the series has been in constant syndication since, reaching three generations of viewers. (Two of his &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; episodes feature Tucker in his cavalry uniform again, as the unconventional Sergeant Holly (1970), who in one scene &quot;marries&quot; and spends a hectic night with Miss Kitty.)

===Later career===
After the run of &quot;F Troop&quot; ended, Tucker returned to films in character roles like &quot;The Night They Raided Minsky&#x27;s&quot; (1969), &quot;Barquero&quot; (1970), &quot;Chisum&quot; (1970), &quot;Welcome Home, Johnny Bristol&quot; (1972), and &quot;Cancel My Reservation&quot; (1972). He had the lead in &quot;The Wild McCullochs&quot; (1975) and was a supporting actor in the television movie &quot;A Real American Hero&quot; (1978).

On television, Tucker was a frequent guest star, including a total of six appearances on &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; and the recurring role of Jarvis Castleberry, Flo&#x27;s estranged father on the 1976–1985 TV series, &quot;Alice&quot; and its spinoff, &quot;Flo&quot;. He also appeared as a guest star on &quot;The Bionic Woman&quot; as J.T. Conners.

Tucker was a regular on three series after &quot;F Troop&quot;: &quot;Dusty&#x27;s Trail&quot; (1973) with Bob Denver; &quot;The Ghost Busters&quot; (1975) which reunited him with &quot;F Troop&quot; co-star Larry Storch; and &quot;Filthy Rich&quot; playing Big Guy Beck (1982–83). He continued to be active on stage as well, starring in the national productions of &quot;Plaza Suite&quot;, &quot;Show Boat&quot; and &quot;That Championship Season&quot;.

Tucker returned to the big screen, after an absence of several years, in the Cannon Films action film &quot;Thunder Run&quot; (1986), playing the hero, trucker Charlie Morrison. His final film appearance was &quot;Outtakes&quot;, a low-budget imitation of &quot;The Groove Tube&quot;.

==Personal life==
Tucker married four times:
# Sandra Jolley (1919–1986) in 1940. She was the daughter of the character actor I. Stanford Jolley (who died of emphysema) and the sister of the Academy Award-winning art director Stan Jolley. They had a daughter, Pamela &quot;Brooke&quot; Tucker. They divorced in 1950.

He died at the Motion Picture &amp; Television Country House and Hospital on October 25, 1986, a few months after the theatrical release of &quot;Thunder Run&quot; and &quot;Outtakes&quot;.

<text>The Gudenå or Gudenåen (), is Denmark&#x27;s longest river and runs through the central parts of the Jutlandic peninsula. An anglicized version of the name often seen is &#x27;The River Guden&#x27;.

The Gudenåen has its spring in Tinnet Krat, Vejle Municipality (between Nørre Snede and Tørring-Uldum) and flows a total of to Randers Fjord in Randers, on a northward course which takes it through the central parts of Jutland. On its way, the river traverses the relatively high lying region of Søhøjlandet, through the lakes of Naldal Sø, Vestbirk Sø, Mossø, Gudensø, Rye Mølle Sø, Birksø, Julsø, Borre Sø, Brassø, Silkeborg Langsø and Sminge Sø before it empties in Randers Fjord; a long inlet of the Kattegat sea. It is fed by numerous streams and wetlands along the way.

The Gudenåen came into existence some 15,000 years ago, at the end of the last Ice Age, when melting ice and glacial streams carved out its bed. The river shelters many species of animals and parts of its course are to be protected under the regulations of Natura 2000.

<text>The Sanctuary was a stone and timber circle near the village of Avebury in the south-western English county of Wiltshire. Excavation has revealed the location of the 58 stone sockets and 62 post-holes. The ring was part of a tradition of stone circle construction that spread throughout much of Britain, Ireland, and Brittany during the Late Neolithic and Early Bronze Age, over a period between 3300 and 900 BCE. The purpose of such monuments is unknown, although archaeologists speculate that the stones represented supernatural entities for the circle&#x27;s builders.

The Sanctuary was erected on Overton Hill, overlooking older Early Neolithic sites like West Kennet Long Barrow and East Kennet Long Barrow. It was connected to the Late Neolithic henge and stone circle at Avebury via the West Kennet Avenue of stones. It also lies close to the route of the prehistoric Ridgeway and near several Bronze Age barrows.

In the early 18th century, the site was recorded by the antiquarian William Stukeley although the stones were destroyed by local farmers in the 1720s. The Sanctuary underwent archaeological excavation by Maud and Ben Cunnington in 1930, after which the location of the prehistoric posts was marked out by concrete posts. Now a scheduled monument under the guardianship of English Heritage, it is classified as part of the &quot;Stonehenge, Avebury and Associated Sites&quot; UNESCO World Heritage Site and is open without charge to visitors all year round.

==Location==

The Sanctuary is 1 ½ miles southeast of Avebury and 4 ½ miles west of Marlborough. It stands on the southern spur of Overton Hill, a site offering views across the valley of the River Kennet.

Visitors can park on a lay-by on the southern side of the A4 atop Overton Hill, which is adjacent to the circle. In its present state, the posts of the Sanctuary are marked by concrete markers. The archaeologist Aubrey Burl noted that the site is &quot;visually unexciting&quot;, offering only a &quot;dull and stunted concrete reproduction&quot; that does &quot;little for the uninstructed imagination&quot;. The archaeologists Joshua Pollard and Andrew Reynolds noted that although it was &quot;far from the most spectacular or evocative of the Avebury monuments&quot;, the site&#x27;s significance &quot;should not be understated&quot;.

==Context==
While the transition from the Early Neolithic to the Late Neolithic in the fourth and third millennia BCE saw much economic and technological continuity, there was a considerable change in the style of monuments erected, particularly in what is now southern and eastern England. By 3000 BCE, the long barrows, causewayed enclosures, and cursuses which had predominated in the Early Neolithic were no longer built, and had been replaced by circular monuments of various kinds. These include earthen henges, timber circles, and stone circles. Stone circles are found in most areas of Britain where stone is available, with the exception of the island&#x27;s south-eastern corner. They are most densely concentrated in south-western Britain and on the north-eastern horn of Scotland, near Aberdeen. The tradition of their construction may have lasted for 2,400 years, from 3300 to 900 BCE, with the major phase of building taking place between 3000 and 1,300 BCE.

These stone circles typically show very little evidence of human visitation during the period immediately following their creation. This suggests that they were not sites used for rituals that left archaeologically visible evidence, but may have been deliberately left as &quot;silent and empty monuments&quot;. The archaeologist Mike Parker Pearson suggests that in Neolithic Britain, stone was associated with the dead, and wood with the living. Other archaeologists have suggested that the stone might not represent ancestors, but rather other supernatural entities, such as deities.

In the area of modern Wiltshire, various stone circles were erected, the best known of which are Avebury and Stonehenge. All of the other examples are ruined, and in some cases have been destroyed. As noted by the archaeologist Aubrey Burl, these examples have left behind &quot;only frustrating descriptions and vague positions&quot;. Most of the known Wiltshire examples were erected on low-lying positions in the landscape. There are four smaller stone circles known from the area surrounding Avebury: The Sanctuary, Winterbourne Bassett Stone Circle, Clatford Stone Circle, and Falkner&#x27;s Circle. Archaeologists initially suggested that a fifth example could be seen at Langdean Bottom, although further investigation has reinterpreted this as evidence for a late prehistoric hut circle or a medieval feature. Burl suggested that these smaller stone related to Avebury in a manner akin to &quot;village churches within the diocese of a cathedral&quot;.

==Design and construction==

The location on which the Sanctuary was built saw prior human activity. This is reflected by a scatter of Peterborough Ware discovered by archaeologists that possibly extends for several hundred metres to the north of the monument. From its location on Overton Hill, the Sanctuary offers views of various Early Neolithic monuments in the landscape, including the West Kennet Long Barrow, East Kennet Long Barrow, and Windmill Hill.

Excavation revealed that the Sanctuary consisted of two concentric rings with an overall diameter of circa 40 metres. The inner stone circle was encompassed by six concentric rings of post holes, marking where timber posts had once stood.

The first stage of activity at the site, some time around 3000 BCE, consisted of a ring of eight wooden posts across, with a central post, presumed to be a round hut. Within 200 years the first ring was enlarged to 6m and a second ring was added, also of eight posts, but this time , perhaps creating a large hut or an enclosure. Phase three, some time in the later Neolithic, a third ring of 33 posts were added, in a circle across, and at the same time an inner stone circle of 15 or 16 sarsen stones was introduced alongside what was by that point the middle ring, making an almost solid wall of stones and posts.

The final phase was of 42 sarsen stones forming a boundary ring across, which replaced all the timber structures. This may have been built at a similar time to the Avebury stone circle, and had an entrance way that led into the Kennet Avenue, two parallel lines of stones running the from The Sanctuary to Avebury.

===Links to the West Kennet Avenue===

The Sanctuary connects to the West Kennet Avenue, a line of stones stretching for 2.4 kilometres to the Avebury henge. The point where the West Kennet Avenue connects with the Sanctuary may have been seen as the start of the Avenue or as its finish.

==Form and purpose==

When the site was first excavated by Maud and Ben Cunnington in 1930, it was interpreted as a timber equivalent to Stonehenge. 162 postholes were excavated, some with double posts and the remains of postpipes still visible. Later interpretations have made much of The Sanctuary&#x27;s link with Avebury via the Avenue, and suggested that the two sites may have served different but complementary purposes. The timbers may have supported a roof of turf or thatch, to form a high-status dwelling serving the ritual site at Avebury, although this can only be conjectural. Another interpretation is that it served as a mortuary house where corpses were kept either before or after ritual treatment at Avebury. Neolithic pottery and animal bone were recovered by the Cunningtons, indicating that the site saw some degree of occupation activity. Recent excavation by Mike Pitts has given greater credence to the Cunningtons&#x27; original interpretation of freestanding posts.

The site was largely destroyed in around 1723, although not before William Stukeley was able to visit and draw it. The 1930 excavation revealed the body of a young girl buried alongside the eastern stone of the inner stone circle. She had been interred with a beaker and animal bones. Her body would have been aligned with the equinoctial sunrises, and Burl suggested that she may have been a sacrifice.

It remains uncertain what purpose(s) the structures were put to. As a site that was in use for many hundreds of years it is likely that the purpose, like the form of the structures, changed considerably over the years.

==Antiquarian investigation==
The Sanctuary was observed by the antiquarian William Stukeley. He drew it on 8 July 1723, calling it the &quot;Temple of Ertha&quot;. This was Stukeley&#x27;s own variant of &quot;Hertha&quot;, a name that was current among 17th and 18th-century antiquarians, and which was based on a reading of Tacitus&#x27;s &quot;Germania&quot;, a first-century book which claimed that the Suebi of northern Europe worshipped a goddess named Nerthus. When Stukeley returned and did more fieldwork at the Sanctuary on 18 May 1724, he referred to it instead as the &quot;Temple on Overton Hill&quot;. Stukeley noted that local people called it &quot;The Sanctuary&quot;. The archaeologist Stuart Piggott later noted that this was &quot;a rather improbable name for rural folklore, and suggesting some seventeenth-century antiquarianism at work&quot;.

Stukeley&#x27;s drawings of the Sanctuary depicted them as ovals, whereas later excavations revealed them to be almost perfect circles. He later presented the idea that the circles represented the head of a large serpent marked out in megaliths across the landscape. Stukeley also recorded the destruction of the Sanctuary by local farmers.

<text>The 1959–60 NHL season was the 43rd season of the National Hockey League. The Montreal Canadiens were the Stanley Cup winners as they defeated the Toronto Maple Leafs four games to none for their fifth straight Stanley Cup.

== Regular season ==

This regular season, like the two preceding it and the two following it, belonged to the Montreal Canadiens, who were in the midst of five straight first overall finishes and at the tail end of five straight Stanley Cup victories. The Detroit Red Wings, who were dead last and missed the playoffs the previous season, squeaked into the playoffs by riding a Hart Memorial Trophy performance by their ageless star right-winger, Gordie Howe.

The season was marked by important changes in the NHL, as Canadiens goaltender Jacques Plante, like Clint Benedict before him, began to wear a mask in hockey games. Plante, who had asthma-related problems throughout his career, first began wearing a mask in practice shortly after a sinus operation in 1957. On November 1, 1959, Plante&#x27;s nose was broken by a shot from New York Rangers right-winger Andy Bathgate. After being stitched up, Plante insisted on wearing a mask for the remainder of the game. Montreal coach Toe Blake was bitterly opposed to the idea, but did not have a backup goaltender and relented after Plante said he would not return to the ice without a mask. Although many in the NHL disapproved of Plante&#x27;s decision due to NHL tradition at the time, many followed suit after Plante went undefeated in ten games with the mask on.

Phil Watson suffered an ulcer and was quietly dismissed as Ranger coach and replaced by Alf Pike. Gump Worsley was demoted to the Springfield Indians of the AHL and Worsley screamed he was finished with hockey, but reported to Springfield anyway. Indians owner Eddie Shore, known for his criticism of his players, gave Worsley a surprise vote of confidence. Gump played well for the Indians.

There was trouble brewing for Rangers right-winger Andy Bathgate, who had ripped open Plante&#x27;s nose on the night of the goalie mask&#x27;s official NHL debut. In a January 1960 True Magazine article ghosted by Dave Anderson, the defending league MVP listed the names of players whom he considered guilty of the dangerous act of spearing. This was brought to the attention of NHL President Clarence Campbell, who fined Bathgate $500 and Ranger general manager Muzz Patrick $100 on the grounds the article was prejudicial to and against the welfare of the league.

After being demoted to Springfield, Gump Worsley was brought back up as Marcel Paille was even worse in goal for New York. Gump and the Rangers beat the Canadiens 8–3 in his first game back on January 3, but on January 21, Montreal bombed Worsley 11-2. Later against the Chicago Black Hawks, Worsley suffered an injury that finished him for the season; Hawks&#x27; winger Bobby Hull skated over his catching glove and severed two tendons in his fingers. Al Rollins was called up to replace him. Later, Olympic hero Jack McCartan played a few games for the Rangers, acquitting himself very well.

The Boston Bruins narrowly missed the playoffs despite a flurry of offense, sparked by the &quot;Uke Line&quot; of Johnny Bucyk, Vic Stasiuk, and Bronco Horvath. Horvath finished a close second to Chicago&#x27;s Bobby Hull in the scoring race and was named to the Second All-Star Team. Slick centre Don McKenney led the NHL in assists while winning the Lady Byng Trophy and versatile Doug Mohns also contributed. 1959–60 saw two veteran Bruins, centre Fleming MacKell and goaltender Harry Lumley, play their last campaigns before retirement.

This season marked the first season of the Original Six era during which every active player had played for Original Six teams only. Ken Mosdell, the last player to play for another team, retired the previous season.

=== Final standings ===
==Stanley Cup playoffs==

Montreal played the minimum number of games, 8, to win the Stanley Cup and in the process, became the last Cup winners in NHL history to go undefeated in the playoffs to date. After winning the Stanley Cup, Maurice Richard retired from the NHL as a champion.

==Awards==
Gordie Howe won the Hart Trophy to become the first five-time winner of the Hart. In voting, he received 118 votes of a possible 180, twice as many as runner-up Bobby Hull. Howe was the last winner of the original Hart Trophy. The trophy was retired to the Hockey Hall of Fame and the NHL began presenting a new trophy, which was dubbed the &quot;Hart Memorial Trophy&quot; in its place. Hull won the Art Ross Trophy for the scoring championship, his first. Doug Harvey won the Norris Trophy for the fifth time, and the fifth time in the seven times it had been awarded. The Canadiens had the lowest goals against average, for the fifth consecutive time, and Jacques Plante was awarded his fifth Vezina Trophy. The Black Hawks&#x27; Glenn Hall was named to the First All-Star team as goaltender.

==Broadcasting==
&quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot; on CBC Television televised Saturday night regular season games and Stanley Cup playoff games. Games were not broadcast in their entirety until the 1968–69 season, and were typically joined in progress, while the radio version of &quot;HNIC&quot; aired games in their entirety.

In the U.S., this was final season of a four-year deal with CBS to televise Saturday afternoon regular season games. This season, CBS aired games from January to March. CBS decided not the renew its agreement, and the NHL would not be able to attract another American national network until the 1965–66 season.

<doc id="788974" wikidata="Q5532704" url="?curid=788974" title="Genesco">
<text>Genesco Inc. is an American publicly owned specialty retailer of branded footwear and accessories and is a wholesaler of branded and licensed footwear based in Nashville, Tennessee. Founded in 1924 as &quot;Jarman Shoe Company&quot;, a footwear manufacturer, the company changed its name to &quot;General Shoe Company&quot; in 1931, and became a public company in 1939. By 1957, its stock would be included in the first S&amp;P 500 Index. The company took its current name, Genesco—an acronym derived from its earlier name—in 1959. Genesco exited the business of U.S.-based footwear manufacturing in 2002 and now contracts with independent, third parties located offshore to manufacture its branded and licensed footwear. In June 2011, Genesco acquired U.K. retail chain and web business Schuh, which gave them an already well-established grounding in a market outside of the U.S.

==Company history==
James Franklin Jarman, J.H. Lawson and William Hatch Wemyss, all former salesmen for Carter Shoe Co. in Nashville, founded Jarman Shoe Company in 1924 as a footwear manufacturer. The company grew rapidly and took the name General Shoe Company in 1931, and its initial public stock offering took place in 1939.

By the 1950s, General Shoe had factories in many southern towns, especially in Genesco&#x27;s home state of Tennessee. The company assumed its current name, Genesco, in 1959, two years after it was chosen as one of the stocks in the first S&amp;P 500 Index. Earlier strictly a manufacturer of footwear, W. Maxey Jarman, the ambitious son of co-founder J.F. Jarman, led the company to slowly diversify, especially as more of the manufacturing was being conducted overseas; as well, it entered into fields such as sports—at one-time manufacturing and selling football (soccer) balls—and retail ownership, including the New York department store Bonwit Teller and the five-and-dime store S. H. Kress &amp; Co..

In 1973, directors of Genesco, who had oveseen W. Maxey Jarmen&#x27;s subsequent naming of his son (J.F. Jarman&#x27;s grandson), Franklin M. Jarman, as board chairman, then &quot;quelled a dispute within the family at its top management&quot; and elected the younger Jarman, then 42‐years‐old, to the further position of company CEO, essentially replacing his father. By 1977, Genesco would go on to add ownership of Henri Bendel and Flagg Bros. shoe stores, to its &quot;Jarman&#x27;s Shoes&quot; and Bonwit Teller. On January 2, 1977, the ten sitting directors of Genesco voted unanimously to oust the young Franklin M. Jarman from his positions of president and chief executive officer, retaining him as board chairman, but only with duties and authority as allowed him by the interim CEO, William M. Blackie, with a committee of the board tasked with identifying a permanent CEO.&lt;ref name=&quot;wapo/jarman-ousted&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The company suffered from over-diversification at one point, and the ongoing manufacturing operations in the southern United States continued to depress results for a long period of time. The company was probably saved by its decision to reposition itself as a retailer.

In February 2002, Genesco Chief Executive Ben Harris, noting that &quot;[s]ales of welted shoes ha[d] fallen as consumers... adopted more casual attire&quot;&#x27;, said that demand for that product &quot;ha[d] reached a level at which it can be better satisfied from other sources&quot;, and—despite previous year company statements &quot;sternly reject[ing]&quot; closure of the Johnston &amp; Murphy, Nashville, Tennessee plant—and announced a layoff of 40 workers, and closure of the plant. Hence, Genesco exited the business of U.S.-based shoe manufacturing in 2002, and in that year began contracting with independent, third parties located offshore, to manufacture its branded and licensed footwear.

==Brands==
The following is a list of some brands and retailers owned or licensed by Genesco as of 2006:
*Johnston &amp; Murphy – Retailer of better men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s footwear, apparel, luggage and leather goods sold in Genesco-owned Johnston &amp; Murphy retail stores, and wholesaler of footwear to department and specialty stores.
*Dockers Footwear – Casual footwear marketed with the Dockers brand licensed from Levi Strauss &amp; Co. and sold at wholesale to department and specialty stores
*Journeys – Retailer of footwear for teens and young adults. The first Journeys retail store was opened at the Rivergate Mall in Nashville, Tennessee by Genesco in December 1986.
*Journeys Kidz – Retailer of footwear for children, where many of the Journeys brands and styles can be found in smaller sizes in the Journeys Kidz stores.
*Schuh – U.K. retailer of footwear and other branded items, acquired by Genesco in June 2011.
*Little Burgundy – Montreal, Canada-based footwear retailer for trendy teens and young adults, acquired by Genesco in 2015.

<doc id="788988" wikidata="Q891080" url="?curid=788988" title="Boise River">
<text>The Boise River is a tributary of the Snake River in the Northwestern United States. It drains a rugged portion of the Sawtooth Range in southwestern Idaho northeast of Boise, as well as part of the western Snake River Plain. The watershed encompasses approximately of highly diverse habitats, including alpine canyons, forest, rangeland, agricultural lands, and urban areas.

==Description==
The Boise River rises in three separate forks in the Sawtooth Range at elevations exceeding , and is formed by the confluence of its North and Middle forks. The North Fork, long, rises in the Sawtooth Wilderness Area, along the Boise–Elmore county line, northeast of Boise. It flows generally southwest through the remote mountains in the Boise National Forest. The Middle Fork, approximately in length, rises within of the North Fork in the southern Sawtooth Wilderness Area in northeastern Elmore County. It flows west-southwest near the town of Atlanta, joining the North Fork to form the Boise River, approximately southeast of Idaho City. The main stream flows southwest into Arrowrock Reservoir, joining the South Fork from the Anderson Ranch Dam.
The South Fork rises in northern Camas County in the Smoky Mountains and Soldier Mountains of the Sawtooth National Forest north of Fairfield, east of Boise. It flows generally southwest, descending through a basalt canyon to fill the Anderson Ranch Reservoir, then turns northwest in central Elmore County. It joins the main stream as the southern arm of Arrowrock Reservoir, east of Boise.
Downstream from its confluence with the South Fork, the river flows generally west, adds the major tributary of Mores Creek along Highway 21, and passes through Lucky Peak Dam to emerge from the foothills southeast of Boise. It passes over several irrigation diversion dams above the city, the first and largest is the century-old Boise River Diversion Dam for the concrete New York Canal, which terminates at Lake Lowell (a.k.a. Deer Flat Reservoir) southwest of Nampa in Canyon County. The next diversion is for the Ridenbaugh Canal (1878) at Eckert Diversion Dam, immediately above Barber Park, five miles (8 km) from downtown Boise. Wooded through the city, the river is lined by an extensive recreational greenbelt. It flows west across the western end of the Snake River Plain in the Treasure Valley and becomes a braided stream with a wide floodplain as it crosses northern Canyon County to the Snake River. At an approximate elevation of , it enters the Snake River, the Idaho-Oregon border, west of Parma and three miles (5 km) south of Nyssa, Oregon.

==History==
The river was called &quot;Reed&#x27;s River&quot; in the early 19th century, named after Pacific Fur Company employee John Reed, who explored parts of the river throughout 1813 and 1814. The river is diverted to canals for irrigation on the plain west of what is now Boise. The dams that form the mountain reservoirs were constructed as part of the Bureau of Reclamation&#x27;s &quot;Boise Project&quot; to provide agricultural irrigation, hydroelectricity, drinking water, and flood control to Boise and the Treasure Valley.

The major projects&#x27; initial completion dates were:

* 1909 – Boise River Diversion Dam &amp; New York Canal
* 1915 – Arrowrock Dam
* 1950 – Anderson Ranch Dam - (S. Fork)
* 1955 – Lucky Peak Dam - (U.S. Army Corps of Engineers)

The Boise River was proposed for 50 years for a dam at Twin Springs, culminating in a 1966 Project Travois proposal, which would have used nuclear explosives to either create large amounts of rockfill aggregate for dam construction, or to induce a landslide that would have much the same effect. Project Travois was a component of Project Plowshare. The project was abandoned in 1968 after concerns were raised about radiological contamination, and the seismic safety of downstream dams.

==Recreation==
The river is a popular destination for floating, specifically on the Boise greenbelt. Tubers and floaters launch at Barber Park and land at Ann Morrison Park, between major irrigation diversion dams. Several minor diversion weirs are passed as well as several bridges on the trip. Water skiing is popular above the dam at the Lucky Peak Reservoir.

On the lower (warmwater) course of the river, low summer flows and poorer water quality from agricultural runoff limit fishery production. This section of river supports a fair fishery for largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, and channel catfish. Upstream from Star, the river is a coldwater stream and supports a greater variety of fish. The most prevalent species on this section is mountain whitefish, as well as hatchery-reared rainbow trout, wild rainbow trout, and fingerling brown trout. Upstream from Lucky Peak and Arrowrock reservoirs, the river and its tributaries contain excellent populations of wild rainbow trout, mountain whitefish, and bull trout. This is especially true immediately downstream from the outflow of Anderson Ranch reservoir, where the South Fork takes on the characteristics of a classic &quot;tailwater&quot; for over from the put-in below the dam to Cow Creek Bridge.

==Fishing==
The Boise River is also popular for fishing, mostly for rainbow trout and, in the winter, steelhead. Spin-fishermen use roostertail spinners and bait such as worms and Powerbait, while fly fishermen use a variety of flies mimicking the abundant aquatic and terrestrial insects present in the watershed, as well as streamers.

<text>Violet Trefusis (&quot;née&quot; Keppel; 6 June 1894 – 29 February 1972) was an English socialite and author. She is chiefly remembered for her lengthy affair with the writer Vita Sackville-West that both women continued after their respective marriages. It was featured in novels by both parties; in Virginia Woolf&#x27;s novel &quot;&quot;; and in many letters and memoirs of the period roughly from 1912 to 1922. She may have been the inspiration for aspects of the character Lady Montdore in Nancy Mitford&#x27;s &quot;Love in a Cold Climate&quot; and of Muriel in Harold Acton&#x27;s &quot;The Soul&#x27;s Gymnasium&quot; (1982).

Trefusis herself wrote many novels, as well as non-fiction works, both in English and in French. Although some of her books sold well, others went unpublished, and her overall critical heritage remains lukewarm.

==Early life==

Born Violet Keppel, she was the daughter of Alice Keppel, who was married to George Keppel, a son of the 7th Earl of Albemarle. Members of the Keppel family thought her biological father was William Beckett, subsequently 2nd Baron Grimthorpe, a banker and MP for Whitby.

Violet lived her early youth in London, where her family had a house in Portman Square. When she was four years old, her mother became the favourite mistress of Albert Edward (&quot;Bertie&quot;), the Prince of Wales, who succeeded to the throne as King Edward VII on 22 January 1901. He paid visits to the Keppel household in the afternoon around tea-time on a regular basis until the end of his life in 1910. (George Keppel, who was aware of the affair, was conveniently absent at these times.)

In 1900, Violet&#x27;s only sibling, Sonia Rosemary, was born. Sonia was the maternal grandmother (and Violet therefore the great-aunt) of Queen Camilla, consort of King Charles III.

==Personal life==
Trefusis is best remembered for her love affair with the wealthy Vita Sackville-West. Virginia Woolf described this by analogy in her 1928 novel &quot;&quot;. In this romanticized biography of Sackville-West, Trefusis is represented by the Russian princess Sasha.

The two women both wrote fictional accounts that referred to this love affair (&quot;Challenge&quot; by Sackville-West, and &quot;Broderie Anglaise&quot;, a roman à clef in French by Trefusis). Sackville-West&#x27;s son Nigel Nicolson wrote the non-fiction &quot;Portrait of a Marriage&quot; (1973), based on material from his mother&#x27;s letters, and adding extensive &quot;clarifications&quot;, including some of his father&#x27;s point of view. Such works explored other aspects of the affair. Aspects of Trefusis&#x27; character also featured in other novels, including Lady Montdore in Nancy Mitford&#x27;s &quot;Love in a Cold Climate&quot; (1949), and Muriel in Harold Acton&#x27;s &quot;The Soul&#x27;s Gymnasium&quot;.

Each of the participants left extensive written accounts in surviving letters and diaries. Alice Keppel, Victoria Sackville-West, Harold Nicolson, Denys Trefusis and Pat Dansey also left documents that referred to the affair.

Diana Souhami&#x27;s &quot;Mrs Keppel and her Daughter&quot; (1997) provides an overview of the affair and of the main actors in the drama. When Violet was 10, she met Vita (who was two years older) for the first time. After that, they attended the same school for several years and soon recognised a bond between them. When Violet was 14, she confessed her love to Vita and gave her a ring. In 1910, after the death of Edward VII, Mrs Keppel made her family observe a &quot;discretion&quot; leave of about two years before re-establishing themselves in British society. When they returned to London, the Keppels moved to a house in Grosvenor Street. At that time, Violet learned that Vita was soon to be engaged to Harold Nicolson and was involved in an affair with Rosamund Grosvenor. Violet made it clear that she still loved Vita, but became engaged to make Vita jealous. This did not stop Vita from marrying Harold (in October 1913), who was also bisexual. Vita and Harold maintained an open marriage.

In April 1918, Violet and Vita refreshed and intensified their bond. By that time Vita had two sons, but she left them in the care of others while she and Violet took a holiday in Cornwall. Meanwhile, Mrs Keppel was busy arranging a marriage for Violet with Denys Robert Trefusis (1890–1929), son of Colonel Hon. John Schomberg Trefusis (son of the 19th Baron Clinton) and Eva Louisa Bontein. A few days after the Armistice, Violet and Vita went to France for several months. Because of Vita&#x27;s exclusive claim, and her own loathing of marriage, Violet made Denys promise never to have sex with her as a condition for marriage. He apparently agreed, for on 16 June 1919 they married. At the end of that year, Violet and Vita made a new two-month excursion to France: ordered to do so by his mother-in-law, Denys retrieved Violet from the south of France when new gossip about her and Sackville-West&#x27;s loose behaviour began to reach London. The next time they left, in February 1920, was to be the final elopement. Harold and Denys pursued the women, flying to France in a two-seater aeroplane. The couples had heated scenes in Amiens.

The climax came when Harold told Vita that Violet had been unfaithful to her (with Denys). Violet tried to explain, and assured Vita of her innocence. Vita was much too angry and upset to listen, and fled saying she couldn&#x27;t bear to see Violet for at least two months. Six weeks later Vita returned to France to meet Violet. Mrs Keppel desperately tried to keep the scandal away from London, where Violet&#x27;s sister, Sonia, was about to be married (to Roland Cubitt). Violet spent much of 1920 abroad, clinging desperately to Vita via continuous letters. In January 1921, Vita and Violet made a final journey to France, where they spent six weeks together. At this time, Harold threatened to break off the marriage if Vita continued her escapades. When Vita returned to England in March, it was practically the end of the affair. Violet was sent to Italy; and, from there she wrote her last desperate letters to their mutual friend Pat Dansey, having been forbidden from writing directly to Vita. At the end of the year, Violet had to face the facts and start to build her life from scratch.

The two former lovers met again in 1940, after the progress of the Second World War forced Trefusis to return to Britain. The women continued to keep in touch and send each other affectionate letters.

==Career==
During the Second World War in London, Trefusis participated in the broadcasting of &quot;La France Libre&quot;, which earned her a Legion d&#x27;Honneur after the war; she was also made a Commander of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic.

Trefusis received mixed reviews on her books. Some critics credited Trefusis with an &quot;excellent gift of observation&quot; and a &quot;talent for mimicry and flair for decor in most of her books&quot;. These qualities were said to be evident in her novels written in English and in French. Other critics stated that her books were not great literature, although they sold well and her readers enjoyed them.

She made many appearances as a pivotal character in other writers&#x27; fiction. Nancy Mitford based Lady Montdore, a character in her novel &quot;Love in a Cold Climate&quot;, on Trefusis. She featured in Cyril Connolly&#x27;s &quot;The Rock Pool&quot;, in Harold Acton&#x27;s &quot;The Soul&#x27;s Gymnasium&quot; as Muriel, in several novels by Vita Sackville-West, and in Virginia Woolf&#x27;s &quot;&quot; as the ravishing &quot;Princess Sasha&quot;.

Although her writings spanned much of the twentieth century, many were unpublished. Virago, a publishing house devoted to recovering the forgotten work of women writers, set about compensating for this. They brought out two of her novels with introductions by Lorna Sage and Lisa St Aubin de Teran, but were eventually defeated by copyright difficulties. In addition, Lorna Sage, Trefusis&#x27; great champion among British critics, died before she could assist in the publication of further works by Trefusis, as she planned.

==Later life in France==
From 1923 on, Trefusis was one of the many lovers of the Singer sewing machine heiress Winnaretta Singer, daughter of Isaac Singer and wife of the homosexual Prince Edmond de Polignac, who introduced her to the artistic &quot;beau-monde&quot; in Paris. Trefusis conceded more and more to her mother&#x27;s model of being &quot;socially acceptable&quot; but, at the same time, not wavering in her sexuality. Singer, like Sackville-West before her, dominated the relationship, though apparently to mutual satisfaction. The two were together for many years and seem to have been content. Trefusis&#x27;s mother, Alice Keppel, did not object to this affair, most likely because of Singer&#x27;s wealth and power, and the fact that Singer carried on the affair in a much more disciplined way. Trefusis seemed to prefer the role of the submissive and therefore fitted well with Singer, who, whip in hand, was typically dominant and in control in her relationships. Neither was completely faithful during their long affair, but, unlike Trefusis&#x27;s affair with Sackville-West, this seems to have had no negative effect on their understanding.

In 1924, Mrs Keppel bought L&#x27;Ombrellino, a large villa overlooking Florence, where Galileo Galilei had once lived. After her parents&#x27; death in 1947, Trefusis would become the chatelaine of L&#x27;Ombrellino till the end of her life. Denys Trefusis died in 1929, completely estranged from his seemingly unfeeling wife. After his death, Trefusis published several novels, some in English, some in French, that she had written in her medieval &quot;Tour&quot; in Saint-Loup-de-Naud, Seine-et-Marne, France – a gift from Winnaretta.

Joseph Alsop, an American journalist, recounts in his autobiography a meeting with Violet in Florence. &quot;Mrs. Trefusis&#x27;s enthusiasms had long since inspired the rhyme &#x27;Mrs Trefusis never refuses.&#x27; Governor Olson, as it turned out was not refused ... they were much cheered up by one another.&quot;

Nancy Mitford said that Trefusis&#x27;s autobiography should be titled &quot;Here Lies Violet Trefusis&quot;, and partly based the character of Lady Montdore in &quot;Love in a Cold Climate&quot; on her.

François Mitterrand, who later became President of the French Republic in 1981, in his chronicle &quot;La Paille &amp; le Grain&quot;, mentions his friendship with Violet Trefusis under 2 March 1972, when he received &quot;the telegram&quot; informing of her death. He goes on to discuss how, before Christmas 1971, he went to Florence to visit her as he knew she was in her last months of life: he had dinner with her and Frank Ashton-Gwatkin, who was a senior Foreign Office official at the beginning of the Second World War, at her house in Florence.

==Death and legacy==
Trefusis died at L&#x27;Ombrellino on the Bellosguardo on 29 February 1972. She died of starvation, the effect of a malabsorption disease. Her ashes were placed both in Florence at the Cimitero degli Allori (&quot;The Evangelical Cemetery of Laurels&quot;), alongside the remains of her parents; and in Saint-Loup-de-Naud in the monks&#x27; refectory near her tower.

In the 1990 BBC mini-series &quot;Portrait of a Marriage&quot;, Violet Trefusis is portrayed by Cathryn Harrison.

<text>Clarence Samuel Stein (June 19, 1882 – February 7, 1975) was an American urban planner, architect, and writer, a major proponent of the garden city movement in the United States known for the Radburn concept.

==Biography==
Stein was born in Rochester, New York, into an upwardly-mobile Jewish family. While a youth, his family decamped to New York City, where he was immersed in the milieu surrounding the Ethical Culture Society, attending its Workshop School and developing his sensibilities within the context of Progressive thought: the integration of physical and mental labor, the importance of a universal humanistic philosophy, the concept of a nurtured individualistic sensibility. Intense and self-absorbed, the young Stein had a nervous collapse shortly before he was scheduled to leave for college, experiencing a bout of what was then called neurasthenia for which he was sent to Florida to endure a rest cure.

He returned to New York and worked in his family&#x27;s casket business, where the combination of physical and mental labor matched the philosophy in which he had been educated, much in keeping with his contemporary John Dewey. After a year or so, he prepared to attend college, embarking on an American version of the Grand Tour: travel to the artistic and cultural centers of Europe, in this case in the company of his father. Returning to the United States, he immersed himself in work in the Progressive settlement house movement. In concert with his brothers and a small cohort of like-minded young men, many of whom would be influential partners for the rest of his career, Stein started the Young Men&#x27;s Municipal Club, an organization modeled on many other such burgeoning social amelioration movements (Jane Adams&#x27;s, Hull House is an example) and dedicated to studying and then agitating for improvements to the chaotic life of the modern city.

While at work on that mission, Stein began to take classes at Columbia University, but they were not the traditional liberal-arts courses common at an Ivy League academy. Instead, he focused on a progressive curriculum newly installed at Columbia under the influence of Dewey: cabinet making, furniture design, and the useful arts. Having been deeply impressed by the vision of modern Paris while on his European tour, Stein decided to attend the prestigious, École des Beaux-Arts in Paris, where many outstanding American architects were seeking training in design according to classical principles. 

Training at the École as an architect-designer required immersion in what is today known as Beaux-Arts Classicism, a rigorous pedagogy that sought to train architects and artists in the grand tradition that began with the Greeks, passed through Rome and then the Renaissance, and emerged as the modern equivalent of humanistic philosophies.

Upon returning to America, Stein joined the office of the progressive, eclectic architect Bertram Goodhue and his more eccentric partner Ralph Adams Cram in 1911 and contributed to three of Goodhue&#x27;s large-scale projects of that time: the Panama–California Exposition in San Diego, California, the company town of Tyrone, New Mexico, and the master plan and individual buildings for the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. While working on these extraordinary planning schemes he participated in the birth of modern urban design in the United States. While marginally influenced by Ebenezer Howard, the English Garden City advocate, Stein was more attuned to the planning innovations of his American contemporaries: Edward Bennett, John Nolen, and John Charles Olmsted. 

In 1919, Stein started his own practice in New York, and in 1921, he began his long association with fellow architect Henry Wright. The two were influential in the 1930s, designing New Town projects, sponsored by New Deal visionaries: Radburn, New Jersey, Sunnyside Gardens, Queens, and Chatham Village, Pittsburgh. 

In 1923, Stein also cofounded the Regional Planning Association of America (RPAA) to address large-scale planning issues such as affordable housing, the impact of sprawl, and wilderness preservation. Other founding members included Lewis Mumford and Benton MacKaye; the RPAA helped MacKaye develop his vision for what would become the Appalachian Trail. The RPAA has remained a formative and influential organization in regional planning, especially in the New York Metropolitan area. Stein served as a president of the RPAA from 1925 to 1948. 

From 1923 to 1926, Stein served as chairman for the New York State Housing and Regional Planning Commission.

Stein travelled extensively to other countries and established friendships with among others Swedish statesman-planner Yngve Larsson.

==Personal life==
From 1928 to his death in 1975, Stein was married to stage and film actress Aline MacMahon. They had no children.

==Accomplishments==
Beginning in 1923 Stein and Henry Wright collaborated on the plan for Sunnyside Gardens, a neighborhood of the New York City borough of Queens. The low-rise pedestrian-oriented development was constructed between 1924 and 1929. It was funded by fellow RPAA officer Alexander Bing and took the garden city ideas of Sir Ebenezer Howard as a model. This neighborhood has retained its special character and has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Construction for Sunnyside started April 1, 1924, two months after it was purchased from Pennsylvania Railroad. Because of the high costs of urban land, many neighborhoods were congested and run down, making it unhealthy and an unenjoyable place to live in. Sunnyside was different; the land was not being used by the railroad company so it was cheap. Stein had a very important job with Sunnyside. He was responsible not only for developing a more generally affordable neighborhood, but also making it a healthy and enjoyable place to live. He designed more natural green space with much light, resulting in a serene living environment. In between all the apartment buildings there was a central public open space, such as a play ground or mini park. The park was then surrounded by individual private gardens that went to the ground level of the apartments. Gardens were also placed on the front of the apartment buildings between the road and the building. This helped break up the long lines of houses and also created an appealing mood. Stein needed as much space as possible to incorporate gardens and open areas. Because of this, he had to place the garages by themselves separate from the apartment buildings. The ending outcome of Sunnyside was very successful.

In 1929, Stein and Wright collaborated on the plan for the Radburn community in Fair Lawn, New Jersey, roughly double the area of Sunnyside. The vision for Radburn was of an integrated self-sustaining community, surrounded by greenbelts, specialized automotive thoroughfares (main linking roads, serviced lanes for direct access to buildings, and express highways), and a complete separation of auto and pedestrian traffic. These thoroughfares were called superblocks. This was because the block is very large with a very large road surrounding the houses within. Stein knew that the community could not survive without a road system but he also didn&#x27;t want the roads dominating the land. Instead, the superblocks make the main focus on the yards and the gardens surrounding the buildings. This grand vision was informed by the lessons of Sunnyside, and by the comparable city-planning work of Ernst May in Germany (researched by a young Catherine Bauer), but the experiment was never completed because of the economic pressures of the Depression. Due to the Depression and different land issues, Radburn was not able to become a Garden City, but it was still impressionable because the superblock was a very successful idea that has been repeated numerous times.

In the 1930s, Stein and the other members of the RPAA saw their social housing cause adopted by the government, at least for a while. They lobbied for the creation of government-sponsored planned communities, under the short-lived Resettlement Administration, and planned for 22 green-belt resettlement towns across the country. Three were built: Greenbelt, Maryland, Greendale, Wisconsin, and Greenhills, Ohio. The others were halted when the Resettlement Administration was dissolved in 1936.

Among Stein&#x27;s other urban-planning credits are the five-city-block Hillside Homes in Williamsbridge, the Bronx, as a Public Works Administration project in 1935; part of the massive wartime labor-force housing at the Walt Whitman Houses in Fort Greene, Brooklyn; Baldwin Hills Village (now the Village Green) in Los Angeles, California in 1941; and his only postwar commission, the re-planning of Kitimat, British Columbia, in 1951.

Stein wrote &quot;Toward New Towns for America&quot; in 1951, and received the AIA Gold Medal in 1956.

==Death==
Stein died on February 7, 1975, at his home in New York City.

==Christianity==

The Epistle to the Hebrews refers to Jesus as high priest.

In Christianity, a high priest could sometimes be compared to the Pope in the Catholic Church, to a patriarch in the Oriental Orthodox Churches, the Church of the East and the Eastern Orthodox Churches (the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople is a &quot;primus inter pares&quot;) or to a primate in the Anglican Communion (the Archbishop of Canterbury is a &quot;primus inter pares&quot;), but it is traditional to refer to it only to Jesus Christ as the only high priest of Christianity. Throughout the episcopal body, except in the Anglican and Lutheran communions, bishops may also be referred to as high priests, since they share in or are considered earthly instruments of the high priesthood of Jesus Christ.

High priest is an office of the priesthood within the Melchizedek priesthood in most denominations of the Latter Day Saint movement.

==Mandaeism==

A high priest in Mandaeism is known as a ganzibra. The head of all of the high priests within a Mandaean community is known as a rishama.

The goði are collectively known as the &quot;goðar&quot;. Some countries use the term Allsherjargoði for national multi-kindred organizations, most notably Iceland&#x27;s.
* In both the Yoruba religion and a number of its various New World sects, such as Santeria, a high priest is called a Babalawo. The term means &quot;wise man&quot;, and comes from the Yoruba language of West Africa. A female holder of the title is known as an Iyanifa.
* In Wicca, High Priest and High Priestess are the roles of the man and woman who are leading a group ritual. High Priest and High Priestess are also titles sometimes conferred on the members of a Wiccan coven when they have completed their third, or fifth year of study and practice.

<text>Colin Ray Jackson, (born 18 February 1967) is a Welsh former sprint and hurdling athlete who specialised in the 110 metres hurdles. During a career in which he represented Great Britain and Wales, he won an Olympic silver medal, became world champion twice, world indoor champion once, was undefeated at the European Championships for 12 years and was twice Commonwealth champion. His world record of 12.91 seconds for the 110 m hurdles stood for nearly 13 years and his 60 metres hurdles world record stood for nearly 27 years.

==Biography==
Jackson won his first major medal, a silver, in the 110 m hurdles, aged 19 at the 1986 Commonwealth Games. He soon established himself on the global scene, taking bronze at the 1987 World Championships in Athletics and a silver medal at the 1988 Summer Olympics. After winning another silver in the 60 m hurdles at the 1989 IAAF World Indoor Championships, he won European and Commonwealth gold medals in 1990. The 1993 season saw him reach the pinnacle of his sport: after a silver at the 1993 Indoor Worlds, he set a world record of 12.91 seconds to become the 1993 World Champion. This record was unbeaten for almost 13 years and remains the world championship record. Jackson was part of the British 4×100 metres relay team which won the world silver medal.

This period was Jackson&#x27;s most successful: he had a streak of 44 races undefeated between 1993 and 1995. In addition to European and Commonwealth golds outdoors in 1994, he set another world record, running 7.30 seconds in the 60 m hurdles. A double gold at the 1994 European Athletics Indoor Championships in the 60 m hurdles and sprint events saw him set a European record of 6.49 seconds over 60 m. Injury affected his 1995–1996 seasons and he finished only fourth at the 1996 Olympics. He returned to competition in 1997 and took silver twice – at the Indoor World Championships and the World Outdoors. After winning the European Championships for a third consecutive time in 1998 he became indoor and outdoor World champion in 1999. He finished fifth at the 2000 Summer Olympics and his last major medals came in 2002, taking European indoor and outdoor gold and a Commonwealth silver.

After a period of sports management and coaching, he now works as a sports commentator for athletics and as a television presenter (predominantly for the BBC). He is a well-known face on British television, having been on &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot; in 2005, as well as a number of other entertainment and factual TV programmes.

== Early life ==
Jackson, born in Cardiff, South Wales, is of Jamaican and Panamanian descent. A DNA test indicated his ancestry is mostly African and European with some North American Indigenous ancestry, suggesting descent from Jamaican Maroons and Taínos. Genealogical research shows his mixed-race Panamanian-born mother had Scottish ancestry. He is the brother of actress Suzanne Packer who played Tess Bateman in the BBC One hospital drama &quot;Casualty&quot;. Jackson grew up in Birchgrove, attending Springwood Primary School and then Llanedeyrn High School. He played football and cricket for the county and rugby union and basketball for his school and joined the athletics club Birchgrove Harriers, which nurtured his talent. As captain of his school cricket team, he and four team-mates were invited to trials for the Welsh national cricket team: whilst his team-mates were all picked, Jackson was passed over – he attributed this to racism, and has said it resulted in him quitting the sport and focusing on athletics, as &quot;athletics had more people that looked like me&quot;. Jackson has also stated he felt discriminated against by British Athletics for selections and sponsorship. He said: &quot;I felt the discrimination was because I was Welsh more than anything else.&quot;

== Athletics career ==
Under coach and close friend Malcolm Arnold, Jackson started out as a promising decathlete before switching to high hurdles. He won gold at the 1986 World Junior Championships and he soon switched to the senior ranks. Following a silver medal in the 1986 Commonwealth Games, he won the 110m hurdles silver at the 1988 Olympic Games behind Roger Kingdom. Although his career as an active competitor in the event would last a further fifteen years, the last ten of these as world record holder, and see him twice crowned World Champion, twice Commonwealth Champion and four times European Champion, this would remain his only Olympic medal of any colour. In 1992 he eased through his first round heat in 13.10 s (which proved faster than the gold medal-winning time) but was restricted by an injury he picked up during the next round and could only finish seventh in the final, and in 1996 he came fourth and in 2000, fifth.

He set his world record for the 110 metres hurdles on 20 August 1993, winning his first World Championships gold medal in Stuttgart, Germany in 12.91 s. The new mark (also a championship record) shaved 0.01 s off the previous record held by Kingdom and stood for nearly thirteen years, only being equalled by Liu Xiang in the 2004 Summer Olympics and finally beaten by the same man on 11 July 2006 at the Super Grand Prix in Lausanne with a time of 12.88 s. Jackson remained the sole holder of the indoor world record at the 60 metres hurdles with a time of 7.30 seconds set in Sindelfingen, Germany on 6 March 1994 until February 2021. At the 1994 European Indoor Championships he became a double European champion: winning in both the 60 metres hurdles and 60 metres sprint race as well. His 60 m dash time of 6.49 s was a European record, as well as a championship record. These records remained unbeaten for 5 years, when Jason Gardener ran 6.46 s in 1999 in Maebashi, Japan.
The aforementioned achievements coincided with one of the high points of Jackson&#x27;s career: he was unbeaten between 29 August 1993 and 9 February 1995. He won forty-four races consecutively in this period. His winning time at the 1994 Commonwealth Games was a Commonwealth Games record.

Jackson was a master of the &quot;dip&quot; – the skill of leaning forward at the end of a race to advance the position of the shoulders and improve times (and potentially positions). He was also renowned for being a particularly fast starter, which led to a great deal of success in 60m events. Jackson&#x27;s technical hurdling ability distinguished him from his peers whether they were faster than him or not.

He was the subject of controversy in 1998 when he decided to run for cash in Tokyo, Japan, rather than compete in the Commonwealth Games for Wales.

Six years after his first world title, Jackson regained his 110m hurdles crown at the 1999 Seville World Championships. This was to be his last gold medal at the very highest level, but he added a final, fourth successive European Championships gold in the 2002 Munich European Championships, extending an unbroken reign as European Champion stretching back to 1990.

== Post-retirement career ==

Since ending his athletics career at the 2003 World Indoor Championships Jackson has been involved in numerous endeavours, in athletics and other areas. He coached his close friend the swimmer Mark Foster until Foster&#x27;s retirement in April 2016. He has coached two of Wales best Olympic prospects, 400m runner Timothy Benjamin and 400m hurdler Rhys Williams. He was also one of the members of the successful London 2012 Olympic bid team and is a key member of the BBC&#x27;s televisions athletics coverage. However, he started his broadcasting career in 2004 by co-hosting, with Sally Gunnell, the BBC reality TV programme &quot;Born to Win&quot;.

Already the holder of the MBE that he received in 1990 for his services to athletics, in 2000 he was promoted to OBE and then in 2003 to a CBE.

The English reggae band Aswad name-checked him on their 1994 hit song &quot;Shine&quot;: &quot;Him a floating like a butterfly, the hurdling man – Yes, me-a-chat about Colin Jackson&quot;.

Jackson has written three books: the first, &quot;The Young Track and Field Athlete&quot;, was published in March 1996 by Dorling Kindersley; his second, &quot;Colin Jackson: The Autobiography&quot;, was published in April 2004 by BBC Books; and his last, &quot;Life&#x27;s New Hurdles&quot;, was published in March 2008 by Accent Press Ltd as part of the Quick Reads Initiative.

Since 2014 Jackson has been the race director of the Wings for Life World Run.

In December 2018 it was announced that Jackson was to become Chancellor of Wrexham Glyndŵr University.

In July 2022 he participated in the Commonwealth Games Queen&#x27;s Baton Relay, carrying the baton into Basildon Sporting Village.

=== Media career ===
After retiring from athletics, he became the face of &quot;BBC Raise Your Game with Colin Jackson&quot; in which he talked to high-profile international stars about the importance of learning. Participants included Luol Deng, Jenson Button, Davina McCall, and stars from &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot;, to name but a few.

His work as a BBC athletics commentator and pundit began with the 2004 Athens Olympics. Since then he has been a regular member of the BBC team covering athletics events.

He is a Director of multimedia production company Red Shoes, along with fellow Director and former BBC Executive Producer Richard Owen. Their clients include the IAAF and UEFA.

Jackson, who is of Jamaican descent, was the subject of an episode of the BBC TV genealogy series &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot;, broadcast in the UK on 20 September 2006. Genetic tests showed his ancestry to be 55% African, 7% Native American (believed to be from Jamaican Maroon ancestry on his father&#x27;s side), and 38% European. His mother was born in Panama, the daughter of Richard Augustus Packer and Gladys McGowan Campbell. Gladys Campbell was from Jamaica, the daughter of a Scottish man Duncan Campbell and his housemaid Albertina Wallace.

In March 2007 Jackson starred as the &#x27;hidden celebrity&#x27; in an episode of the award-winning CBBC gameshow &quot;Hider in the House&quot;, hosted by JK and Joel.

In 2008, Jackson co-hosted, with Louise Minchin, the Sunday morning show &quot;Sunday Life&quot; on BBC One.

Colin Jackson appeared in the BBC One documentary &quot;The Making of Me&quot; on 31 July 2008, which attempted to find out what had made him such a talented athlete. A sample of his leg muscle showed that he had 25% super-fast twitch fibres, when all previous athletes tested had only 2%. Family support was also thought to have been highly significant. Jamaicans are notable for the high level of support and encouragement they give their children in the area of sports. One clip showed a stadium in Jamaica with 30,000 people cheering on children taking part in an average school sports meet. Supporters included their peers, who seemed happy to cheer on their classmates who were &#x27;good at sports&#x27;. Although Jackson was brought up in the UK, he remembers his parents cheering on Don Quarrie in the 1976 Olympics, inspiring him to want to &#x27;be like that&#x27;.

In 2009 Jackson shared his writing tips on the adult learning website &quot;BBC raw words&quot;. He features in a comedy short with Nina Wadia, Rowland Rivron and Anneka Rice about structuring a story, and also shares his writing tips gained from writing &quot;Life&#x27;s New Hurdles&quot;.

In July 2010, Jackson was a competitor on the BBC television programme &quot;Celebrity MasterChef&quot;.

In 2012 Jackson made a cameo appearance as himself in an episode of the UK TV comedy drama &quot;Stella&quot;. In 2015, he starred in the historical experience &quot;24 Hours in the Past&quot;.

In February 2019 Jackson was inaugurated as a Chancellor of Wrexham Glyndwr University, after being awarded with an Honorary Fellowship in 2016 for his contribution to sport.

=== &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot; ===
In 2005, he appeared as one of the celebrity contestants on the BBC TV series &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot;, where he came second with his dance partner Erin Boag, just losing out to cricketer Darren Gough. In 2006 Jackson became the first competitor who had not won the main series to win the &quot;Strictly Come Dancing Christmas Special&quot;.

=== Go Dad Run ===

In 2013 Jackson created his own charitable fundraising event for men, Go Dad Run. The purpose is to raise awareness of men&#x27;s health issues and funds for male based charities Prostate Cancer UK, Bowel Cancer UK, Orchid and CALM plus local Cancer Care charities and hospices. Ambassadors include Mark Foster, Donovan Bailey, Suzanne Packer, Fernando Montano, Siân Lloyd and Jamie Baulch.

=== Sport 4 Kids ===

Jackson CBE joined Sport4Kids (S4K) as their International Director and Brand Ambassador.

Jackson holds special responsibilities for developing the S4K brand and help the mission to transform children&#x27;s sport across the UK and international markets through the company&#x27;s franchise network.
In 2020 Jackson joined other celebrities in a new S4C television series called (&#x27;Language Road Trip&#x27;) in which they take a crash course in the Welsh language while travelling around Wales. At the end of the series he was interviewed in Welsh. The series was broadcast in April 2020. An extra episode, (&#x27;Language Road Trip: Christmas&#x27;) was broadcast at the end of 2020, interviewing each of the celebrities about whether they were still making use of their Welsh and the opportunities they had had to use Welsh during lockdown.

===&quot;Dancing on Ice&quot;===
In 2021, Jackson participated in the thirteenth series of &quot;Dancing on Ice&quot;. He was partnered with Klabera Komini and finished in 3rd Place.

== Personal life ==
On 26 August 2017 Jackson came out as gay in a clip on Swedish television promoting the series &quot;Rainbow Heroes&quot;. Previously he had denied that he was gay both in his 2004 autobiography and in a 2008 interview with &quot;The Voice&quot; newspaper.

His eldest sister is &quot;Casualty (TV series)&quot; actress Suzanne Packer.

<text>Citizens&#x27; Movement for Change (, , MCC) is a Christian-democratic political party in the French Community of Belgium founded by Gérard Deprez in 1998.

Deprez was the leader of the Francophone Christian Social Party (PSC) from 1982 to 1995. He left the PSC, because he had failed to carry through his idea of forging a confederation of the PSC with the Liberal Reformist Party (PRL). Moreover, he had been discontent with the election of Charles-Ferdinand Nothomb as party leader. The last trigger to form a new party was the popular outrage at the government&#x27;s mishandling of the controversy around the pedophile serial killer Marc Dutroux. The MCC immediately joined the alliance of the PRL and the regionalist Democratic Front of the Francophones (FDF) and ran on a joint PRL-FDF-MCC list for the elections in 1999. Deprez was elected to the European Parliament and sat with the group of the European People&#x27;s Party (EPP-ED). The MCC supported the &quot;purple-green&quot; government coalition of Liberals, Socialists and Greens, while the PSC, for the first time in 50 years, was sent into opposition. PRL, FDF and MCC became components of the Reformist Movement in 2002.

In the 2004 European Parliamentary Election it elected one MEP (G. Deprez) on the MR ticket. This time, he chose to sit with his liberal allies in the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE) Group. The MCC became part of the pan-European European Democratic Party (EDP).

<text>The Mosque–Cathedral of Córdoba ( ), officially known by its ecclesiastical name of Cathedral of Our Lady of the Assumption (), is the cathedral of the Diocese of Córdoba dedicated to the Assumption of Mary and located in the Spanish region of Andalusia. Due to its status as a former mosque, it is also known in Spanish as the and in an historical sense as the Great Mosque of Córdoba.

According to traditional accounts a Visigothic church, the Catholic Christian Basilica of Vincent of Saragossa, originally stood on the site of the current Mosque-Cathedral, although this has been a matter of scholarly debate. The Great Mosque was constructed in 785 on the orders of Abd al-Rahman I, founder of the Islamic Emirate of Córdoba. It was expanded multiple times afterwards under Abd al-Rahman&#x27;s successors up to the late 10th century. Among the most notable additions, Abd al-Rahman III added a minaret (finished in 958) and his son al-Hakam II added a richly-decorated new &quot;mihrab&quot; and &quot;maqsurah&quot; section (finished in 971). The mosque was converted to a cathedral in 1236 when Córdoba was captured by the Christian forces of Castile during the &quot;Reconquista&quot;. The structure itself underwent only minor modifications until a major building project in the 16th century inserted a new Renaissance cathedral nave and transept into the center of the building. The former minaret, which had been converted to a bell tower, was also significantly remodelled around this time. Starting in the 19th century, modern restorations have in turn led to the recovery and study of some of the building&#x27;s Islamic-era elements. Today, the building continues to serve as the city&#x27;s cathedral and Mass is celebrated there daily.

The mosque structure is an important monument in the history of Islamic architecture and was highly influential on the subsequent &quot;Moorish&quot; architecture of the western Mediterranean regions of the Muslim world. It is also one of Spain&#x27;s major historic monuments and tourist attractions, as well as a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1984.

== History ==
=== Claims of earlier Roman temple ===
A claim that the site of the mosque-cathedral was once a Roman temple dedicated to Janus dates as far back as Pablo de Céspedes and is sometimes still repeated today. However, Robert Knapp, in his overview of Roman-era Córdoba, has dismissed this claim as speculation based on a misunderstanding of Roman milestones found in the area.

=== Visigothic church ===
According to traditional accounts, the present-day site of the Cathedral–Mosque of Córdoba was originally a Visigothic Christian church dedicated to Saint Vincent of Saragossa, which was divided and shared by Christians and Muslims after the Umayyad conquest of Hispania. As the Muslim community grew and this existing space became too small for prayer, the basilica was expanded little by little through piecemeal additions to the building. This sharing arrangement of the site lasted until 785, when the Christian half was purchased by Abd al-Rahman I, for a hundred thousand dinars. He then demolished the church structure and built the new mosque on its site. In return, Abd al-Rahman also allowed the Christians to build or rebuild some churches outside the city walls. These included churches dedicated to the Christian martyrs Saints Faustus, Januarius, and Marcellus whom they deeply revered.The historicity of this narrative has been challenged as archaeological evidence is scant and the narrative is not corroborated by contemporary accounts of the events following Abd al-Rahman I&#x27;s initial arrival in al-Andalus. The narrative of the church being transformed into a mosque, which goes back to the tenth-century historian Al-Razi, echoed similar narratives of the Islamic conquest of Syria, in particular the story of building the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus. For medieval Muslim historians, these parallels served to highlight a dynastic Umayyad conquest of Spain and appropriation of Visigothic Córdoba. Another tenth-century source mentions a church that stood at the site of the mosque without giving further details. An archaeological exhibit in the mosque–cathedral of Cordoba today displays fragments of a Late Roman or Visigothic building, emphasizing an originally Christian nature of the complex. The &quot;stratigraphy&quot; of the site is complicated and made more so by the impact of contemporary political debates about cultural identity in Spain.

According to Susana Calvo Capilla, a specialist on the history of the mosque–cathedral, although remains of multiple church-like buildings have been located on the territory of the mosque–cathedral complex, no clear archaeological evidence has been found of where either the church of St. Vincent or the first mosque were located on the site, and the latter may have been a newly constructed building. The evidence suggests that it may have been the grounds of an episcopal complex rather than a particular church which were initially divided between Muslims and Christians. Pedro Marfil, an archeologist at the University of Cordoba, has argued for the existence of such a complex – including a Christian basilica – on this site by interpreting the existing archeological remains. D. Fairchild Ruggles, a scholar of Islamic art, considers previous archeological work to be a confirmation of the former church&#x27;s existence. This theory has been opposed by Fernando Arce-Sainz, another archeologist, who states that none of the numerous archeological investigations in modern times have turned up remains of Christian iconography, a cemetery, or other evidence that would support the existence of a church. Art historian Rose Walker, in an overview of late antique and early medieval art in Spain, has likewise criticized Marfil&#x27;s view as relying on personal interpretation. More recently, archeologists Alberto León and Raimundo Ortiz Urbano have affirmed the hypothesis of a large episcopal complex by analyzing both old and new archeological findings at the site, while María de los Ángeles Utrero Agudo and Alejandro Villa del Castillo argue that evidence so far does not allow for the identification of former ecclesiastical structures on the site.

Regardless of what structures may have existed on the site, however, it is almost certain that the building which housed the city&#x27;s first mosque was destroyed to build Abd ar-Rahman I&#x27;s Great Mosque and that it had little relation to the latter&#x27;s form.

=== Construction of the mosque ===

The Great Mosque was built in the context of the new Umayyad Emirate in Al-Andalus which Abd ar-Rahman I founded in 756. Abd ar-Rahman was a fugitive and one of the last remaining members of the Umayyad royal family which had previously ruled the first hereditary caliphate based in Damascus, Syria. This Umayyad Caliphate was overthrown during the Abbasid Revolution in 750 and the ruling family were nearly all killed or executed in the process. Abd ar-Rahman survived by fleeing to North Africa and, after securing political and military support, took control of the Muslim administration in the Iberian Peninsula from its governor, Yusuf ibn Abd al-Rahman al-Fihri. Cordoba was already the capital of the Muslim province and Abd ar-Rahman continued to use it as the capital of his independent emirate.

Construction of the mosque began in 785–786 (169 AH) and finished a year later in 786–787 (170 AH). This relatively short period of construction was aided by the reuse of existing Roman and Visigothic materials in the area, especially columns and capitals. Syrian (Umayyad), Visigothic, and Roman influences have been noted in the building&#x27;s design, but the architect is not known. The craftsmen working on the project probably included local Iberians as well as people of Syrian origin. According to tradition and historical written sources, Abd ar-Rahman involved himself personally and heavily in the project, but the extent of his personal influence in the mosque&#x27;s design is debated.

==== Original layout ====
The original mosque had a roughly square floor plan measuring 74 or 79 meters per side, equally divided between a hypostyle prayer hall to the south and an open courtyard (&quot;sahn&quot;) to the north. As the mosque was built on a sloping site, a large amount of fill would have been necessary to create a level ground on which to build. The outer walls were reinforced with large buttresses, which are still visible on the exterior today.The original mosque&#x27;s most famous architectural innovation, which was preserved and repeated in all subsequent Muslim-era expansions, was its rows of two-tiered arches in the hypostyle hall.

The mosque&#x27;s original &quot;mihrab&quot; (niche in the far wall symbolizing the direction of prayer) no longer exists today but its probable remains were found during archeological excavations between 1932 and 1936. The remains showed that the mihrab&#x27;s upper part was covered with a shell-shaped hood similar to the later mihrab.
The mosque originally had four entrances: one was in the center of the north wall of the courtyard (aligned with the mihrab to the south), two more were in the west and east walls of the courtyard, and a fourth one was in the middle of the west wall of the prayer hall. The latter was known as &quot;Bab al-Wuzara&quot;&#x27; (the &quot;Viziers&#x27; Gate&quot;, today known as &quot;Puerta de San Esteban&quot;) and was most likely the entrance used by the emir and state officials who worked in the palace directly across the street from here.

The courtyard of the mosque was planted with trees as early as the 9th century, according to written sources cited by the 11th century jurist Ibn Sahl. Although the species of tree is not known, the fact that these were fruit trees is attested in Ibn Sahl, who was consulted as to whether such a garden was forbidden and, if not forbidden, whether it was permitted to eat from it. That the trees remained in the courtyard is demonstrated by two seals of the City of Cordoba, one in 1262 and the other in 1445, both of which show the mosque (which by then had been converted to a cathedral) within whose walls appear tall palm trees. This evidences makes the Cordoba mosque the earliest one where trees are known to have been planted in the courtyard.

==== &quot;Qibla&quot; alignment ====
Mosques were normally aligned with the &quot;qibla&quot; (the direction of prayer), which is theoretically the direction of Mecca. From Cordoba, Mecca is to the east-southeast, but the Great Mosque of Cordoba is instead oriented more towards the south. This orientation, which doesn&#x27;t match that of modern mosques, reflects the pre-existing street alignment of Roman Cordoba.

It is also due to historical differences in opinion about the appropriate direction of the &quot;qibla&quot; in far western Islamic lands like al-Andalus and Morocco. In this early period, many Muslims in the region preferred a tradition that existed in the western Islamic world (the Maghreb and al-Andalus) according to which the qibla should be oriented towards the south instead of pointing towards the shortest distance to Mecca. This was based on a saying (&quot;hadith&quot;) of Muhammad which stated that &quot;What is between the east and west is a qibla&quot;, which thus legitimized southern alignments.

This practice may also have sought to emulate the orientation of the walls of the rectangular &quot;Kaaba&quot; building inside the Great Mosque of Mecca, based on another tradition which considered the different sides of the Kaaba as being associated with different parts of the Muslim world. In this tradition the northwest face of the Kaaba was associated with al-Andalus and, accordingly, the Great Mosque of Cordoba was oriented towards the southeast as if facing the Kaaba&#x27;s northwestern façade, with its main axis parallel to the main axis of the Kaaba structure (which was oriented from southeast to northwest).

Although later mosques in Al-Andalus did have more eastern-facing orientations (e.g. the Mosque of Madinat al-Zahra in the 10th century), later expansions of the Great Mosque did not attempt to modify its original alignment.

=== Expansions of the mosque ===
==== First additions ====
In 793 Abd ar-Rahman I&#x27;s son and successor, Hisham I, added to the mosque a &quot;ṣawma&#x27;a&quot;, a shelter for the muezzin on top of the outer wall, as the mosque did not yet have a minaret (a feature which was not yet standard in early mosques).

The mosque was significantly expanded by Abd ar-Rahman II (r. 822–852) sometime between the years 833 and 848. This expansion preserved and repeated the original design while extending the prayer hall eight bays to the south (i.e. the length of eight arches). This made the prayer hall 64 metres long from front to back. 

During this expansion, the builders began to commission new marble capitals for the columns instead of just re-using ancient ones. These new capitals were imitations of the Corinthian style but still differed slightly from classical models, thus hinting at the future evolution of architectural sculpture in al-Andalus. One probable example of these capitals is now preserved at the National Archaeological Museum in Madrid and features an Arabic inscription in an archaic Kufic script that offers blessings on Abd ar-Rahman II. The expansion work may have been unfinished when Abd ar-Rahman II died in 852 and it appears to have been completed instead by his son and successor, Muhammad I (r. 852–886).

Muhammad I carried out various other works on the mosque and is reported to have created a &quot;maqsura&quot; (a prayer space reserved for the ruler). In 855 he also restored the &quot;Bab al-Wuzara&quot;&#x27; gate (today&#x27;s &quot;Puerta de San Esteban&quot;). The decoration of this gate, which thus likely dates from this time, is often noted as an important prototype of later Moorish gateways. Muhammad&#x27;s son, Al-Mundhir (r. 886–888), in turn added a treasury to the mosque. Al-Mundhir&#x27;s son, Abdallah (r. 888–912), built the mosque&#x27;s first elevated passage, known as a &quot;sabat,&quot; which connected the mosque directly with the Umayyad palace across the street. This passage allowed the ruler thenceforth to enter the mosque privately, where he would remain unseen behind the screen of the &quot;maqsura&quot;, thus separating him from the general public during prayer. New versions of this bridge would later be rebuilt during the mosque&#x27;s subsequent expansions.

==== Expansion of Abd ar-Rahman III ====

In the 10th century Abd ar-Rahman III (r. 912–961) declared a new Caliphate in al-Andalus and inaugurated the height of Andalusi power in the region. As part of his various construction projects, he reworked and enlarged the courtyard of the Great Mosque and built its first true minaret (a tower from which the call to prayer was issued) starting in 951–952. The new works, including the minaret, were completed in 958, as recorded by a surviving inscription on a marble plaque that includes the name of Abd ar-Rahman III as well as the names of the master builder and the supervisor of works.

The minaret was 47 meters high and had a square base measuring 8.5 meters per side. Scholar Jonathan Bloom suggests that Abd ar-Rahman III&#x27;s construction of the minaret – along with his sponsoring of other minarets around the same time in Fez, Morocco – was partly intended as a visual symbol of his growing authority as caliph and may have also been aimed at defying the rival Fatimid Caliphate to the east, which eschewed such structures.

Abd ar-Rahman III also reinforced the northern wall of the courtyard by adding another &quot;façade&quot; in front of the old one on the courtyard side. Historical accounts differ on whether the completed courtyard had a surrounding gallery or portico (as seen today and as was common in the courtyards of other mosques). Many modern scholars affirm that the courtyard was provided with an enveloping gallery at this time and that its design involved an alternation between piers and columns (similar to its current appearance).

==== Expansion of al-Hakam II ====

Abd ar-Rahman III&#x27;s son and successor, Al-Hakam II (r. 961–976), was a cultured man who was involved in his father&#x27;s architectural projects. During his own reign, starting in 961, he further expanded the mosque&#x27;s prayer hall. The hall was extended 45 meters to the south by adding 12 more bays (arches), again repeating the two-tiered arches of the original design. This expansion is responsible for some of the mosque&#x27;s most significant architectural flourishes and innovations.

At the beginning of al-Hakam&#x27;s extension, the central &quot;nave&quot; of the mosque was highlighted with an elaborate ribbed dome (now part of the &quot;Capilla da Villaviciosa&quot;). More famously, a rectangular &quot;maqsura&quot; area around the mosque&#x27;s new mihrab was distinguished by a set of unique interlacing multifoil arches. The rectangular area within this, in front of the mihrab, was covered by three more decorative ribbed domes. The domes and the new mihrab niche were finished in November or December 965. An inscription records the names of four of its craftsmen, who also worked at the Reception Hall (&quot;Salon Rico&quot;) of Madinat al-Zahra.
Soon after this date both the middle dome of the &quot;maqsura&quot; and the wall surfaces around the mihrab were covered in rich Byzantine-influenced gold mosaics. According to traditional accounts like that of Ibn &#x27;Idhari, Al-Hakam II had written to the Byzantine emperor (initially Nikephoros II Phokas) in Constantinople requesting that he send him expert mosaicists for the task. The emperor consented and sent him a master craftsman along with about 1600 kg of mosaic tesserae as a gift. The mosaicist trained some of the caliph&#x27;s own craftsmen, who eventually became skilled enough to do the work on their own. The work was finished by this team in late 970 or early 971.

Al-Hakam II&#x27;s work on the mosque also included the commissioning of a new &quot;minbar&quot; (pulpit) in 965, which took about 5 to 7 years to finish. Unfortunately, the details of its construction and of its chronology are muddled by sometimes contradictory historical sources. Ibn &#x27;Idhari, for example, implies that Al-Hakam had two minbars built in this period, with one of them possibly having been destroyed or replaced. Either way, whichever minbar survived and became associated with the mosque was celebrated by many writers for its craftsmanship. It was made out of precious woods like ebony, boxwood, and &quot;scented&quot; woods, and it was inlaid with ivory and with other coloured woods such as red and yellow sandalwood. Modern scholars believe the minbar had wheels which allowed it to be rolled in and out of its storage chamber.

==== Expansion of al-Mansur ====

The mosque&#x27;s last significant expansion under Muslim rule was ordered by Al-Mansur (Almanzor), the autocratic vizier of Caliph Hisham II, in 987–988. Rather than extending the mosque further south, which would have been impossible due to the proximity of the riverbank, Al-Mansur had the mosque extended laterally towards the east, extending both the courtyard and the prayer hall by 47.76 meters and adding eight naves to the mosque. The new extension covered 8600 square meters and made the mosque the largest in the Muslim world outside of Abbasid Iraq.

Once again, the same design of two-tiered arches was replicated in the new construction. However, the capitals produced for the hundreds of new columns have a simpler and less detailed design that may reflect the hurry in which they were produced.The new eastern wall of the mosque featured ten richly-decorated exterior portals similar to the ones on the mosque&#x27;s western side, although these were heavily restored in the 20th century. Al-Mansur also famously looted the bells of the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela and reportedly ordered them to be melted down and turned into chandeliers for the mosque, although none of these chandeliers have survived.

=== Later Islamic history of the mosque (11th–12th centuries) ===
After the collapse of the Umayyad Caliphate in Cordoba at the beginning of the 11th century, no further expansions to the mosque were carried out. Indeed, the collapse of authority had immediate negative consequences for the mosque, which was looted and damaged during the &quot;fitna&quot; (civil conflict) that followed the caliphate&#x27;s fall (roughly between 1009 and 1030). Cordoba itself also suffered a decline but remained an important cultural center. Under Almoravid rule, the artisan workshops of Cordoba were commissioned to design new richly-crafted minbars for the most important mosques of Morocco – most famously the Minbar of the Kutubiyya Mosque commissioned in 1137 – which were likely inspired by the model of al-Hakam II&#x27;s minbar in the Great Mosque.

In 1146 the Christian army of King Alfonso VII of León and Castile briefly occupied Cordoba. The archbishop of Toledo, Raymond de Sauvetât, accompanied by the king, led a mass inside the mosque to &quot;consecrate&quot; the building. According to Muslim sources, before leaving the city the Christians plundered the mosque, carrying off its chandeliers, the gold and silver finial of the minaret, and parts of the rich minbar. As a result of both this pillage and the earlier pillage during the &quot;fitna&quot;, the mosque had lost almost all of its valuable furnishings.

In 1162, after a general period of decline and recurring sieges, the Almohad caliph Abd al-Mu&#x27;min ordered that Cordoba be prepared to become his capital in al-Andalus. As part of this preparation, his two sons and governors, Abu Yaqub Yusuf and Abu Sa&#x27;id, ordered that the city and its monuments be restored. The architect Ahmad ibn Baso (who was later known for his work on the Great Mosque of Seville) was responsible for carrying out this restoration program. It is not known exactly which buildings he restored, but it is almost certain that he restored the Great Mosque. It is likely that the mosque&#x27;s &quot;minbar&quot; was also restored at this time, since it is known to have survived long afterwards up to the 16th century.

=== &quot;Reconquista&quot; and conversion to cathedral (13th century) ===

In 1236 Córdoba was conquered by King Ferdinand III of Castile as part of the &quot;Reconquista&quot;. Upon the city&#x27;s conquest the mosque was converted into a Catholic cathedral dedicated to the Virgin Mary (&quot;Santa Maria&quot;). The first mass was dedicated here on June 29 of that year. According to Jiménez de Rada, Ferdinand III also carried out the symbolic act of returning the former cathedral bells of Santiago de Compostela that were looted by Al-Mansur (and which had been turned into mosque lamps) back to Santiago de Compostela.

Despite the conversion, the early Christian history of the building saw only minor alterations being done to its structure, mostly limited to the creation of small chapels and the addition of new Christian tombs and furnishings. Even the mosque&#x27;s minbar was apparently preserved in its original storage chamber, though it is unknown if it was used in any way during this time. (The minbar has since disappeared, but it still existed in the 16th century, when it was apparently seen by Ambrosio de Morales.)

The cathedral&#x27;s first altar was installed in 1236 under the large ribbed dome at the edge of Al-Hakam II&#x27;s 10th-century extension of the mosque, becoming part of what is today called the Villaviciosa Chapel (&quot;Capilla de Villaviciosa&quot;) and the cathedral&#x27;s first main chapel (the &quot;Antigua&quot; &quot;Capilla Mayor&quot;). There is no indication that even this space was significantly modified in its structure at this time. The area of the mosque&#x27;s mihrab and &quot;maqsura,&quot; along the south wall, was converted into the Chapel of San Pedro and was reportedly where the host was stored. What is today the 17th-century Chapel of the Conception (&quot;Capilla de Nuestra Señora de la Concepción&quot;), located on the west wall near the courtyard, was initially the baptistery in the 13th century. These three areas appear to have been the most important focal points of Christian activity in the early cathedral. The minaret of the mosque was also converted directly into a bell tower for the cathedral, with only cosmetic alterations such as the placement of a cross at its summit.

Notably, during the early period of the cathedral-mosque, the workers charged with maintaining the building (which had suffered from disrepair in previous years) were local Muslims (Mudéjars). Some of them were kept on payroll by the church but many of them worked as part of their fulfilment of a &quot;labor tax&quot; on Muslim craftsmen (later extended to Muslims of all professions) which required them to work two days a year on the cathedral building. This tax was imposed by the crown and was unique to the city of Cordoba. It was probably instituted not only to make use of Mudéjar expertise but also to make up for the cathedral chapter&#x27;s relative poverty, especially vis-à-vis the monumental task of repairing and maintaining such a large building. At the time, Mudéjar craftsmen and carpenters were especially valued across the region and even held monopolies in some Castilian cities such as Burgos.

Other chapels were progressively created around the interior periphery of the building over the following centuries, many of them funerary chapels built through private patronage. The first precisely-dated chapel known to be built along the west wall is the Chapel of San Felipe and Santiago, in 1258. The Chapel of San Clemente was created in the southeast part of the mosque before 1262. A couple of early Christian features, such as an altar dedicated to San Blas (installed in 1252) and an altar of San Miguel (1255), disappeared in later centuries.

=== Early additions (14th–15th centuries) ===

The first major addition to the building under Christian patrons is the Royal Chapel (&quot;Capilla Real&quot;), located directly behind the west wall of the Villaviciosa Chapel. It was begun at an uncertain date. While it is sometimes believed to have been started by Alfonso X, Heather Ecker has argued that documentary evidence proves it wasn&#x27;t begun before the 14th century when Constance of Portugal, wife of Ferdinand IV, made an endowment for the chapel. It was finished in 1371 by Enrique II, who moved the remains of his father Alfonso XI and grandfather Ferdinand IV here. (Their remains were later moved in 1736 to the Church of San Hipólito.)

The Royal Chapel was constructed in a lavish Mudéjar style with a ribbed dome very similar to the neighbouring dome of the Villaviciosa Chapel and with surfaces covered in carved stucco decoration typical of Nasrid architecture at the time. This prominent use of the Moorish-Mudéjar style for a royal funerary chapel (along with other examples like the Mudéjar Alcázar of Seville) is interpreted by modern scholars as a desire by the Christian kings to appropriate the prestige of Moorish architecture in the Iberian Peninsula, just as the Mosque of Cordoba was itself a powerful symbol of the former Umayyad Caliphate&#x27;s political and cultural power which the Castilians were eager to appropriate.

In the late 15th century a more significant modification was carried out to the Villaviciosa Chapel, where a new nave in Gothic style was created by clearing some of the mosque arches on the east side of the chapel and adding Gothic arches and vaulting. The nave is dated to 1489 and its construction was overseen by Bishop Íñigo Manrique. It originally had a series of Byzantine-Italian style frescoes by Alonso Martinez depicting saints and kings, but only one of these frescoes has been preserved to the present day and is now being kept at the Museum of Fine Arts in Cordoba.

=== Major alterations (16th–18th centuries) ===

The most significant alteration of all, however, was the building of a Renaissance cathedral nave and transept – forming a new – in the middle of the expansive mosque structure, starting in 1523. The project, initiated by Bishop Alonso de Manrique, was vigorously opposed by the city council of Cordoba. The cathedral chapter eventually won its case by petitioning Charles V, king of Castile and Aragon, who gave his permission for the project to proceed. When Charles V later saw the result of the construction he is reputed to have been displeased, however, and is claimed to have commented: &quot;You have built what you or anyone else might have built anywhere; to do so you have destroyed something that was unique in the world.&quot;

The architect Hernan Ruiz I was put in charge of the design of the new nave and transept. Before his death in 1547 he built the choir walls up to the windows and the gothic vaults on the south side. He also worked on the mosque building&#x27;s eastern section (the extension added by Al-Mansur) by adding gothic vaulting to the mosque naves in this area. His son, Hernan Ruiz II &quot;the Younger&quot;, took over the project after his death. He was responsible for building the transept walls to their full height as well as the buttresses upholding the structure. After him, the project was entrusted to architect Juan de Ochoa, who completed the project in a Mannerist style. The final element was the construction of the elliptical central dome of the transept, built between 1599 and 1607.

After the completion of Juan de Ochoa&#x27;s work, Bishop Diego de Mardones initiated the construction of the main altarpiece and provided a significant donation himself for the project. The altarpiece was designed in a Mannerist style by Alonso Matías and construction began in 1618. Other artists who were involved in its execution included Sebastián Vidal, Pedro Freile de Guevara, and Antonio Palomino. 

In 1589 a strong storm (or earthquake) caused damage to the former minaret, which was being used as a bell tower, and it was decided to remodel and reinforce the tower. A design by Hernán Ruiz III (son of Hernán Ruiz II) was chosen, encasing the original minaret structure into a new Renaissance-style bell tower. Some of the upper sections of the minaret were demolished in the process. Construction began in 1593 but eventually stalled due to resources being spent instead on the construction of the new cathedral nave and transept happening at the same time. Hernán Ruiz III died in 1606 and was unable to see its completion. The construction resumed under architect Juan Sequero de Matilla in 1616 and the tower was finished in 1617.

The new tower had imperfections, however, and required repairs only a few decades later in the mid-17th century. The cathedral hired architect Gaspar de la Peña to fix the problems. He reinforced the tower and modified the initial design of the &quot;Puerta del Perdón&quot; (&quot;Door of Forgiveness&quot;) which passed through the tower&#x27;s base. In 1664 Gaspar added a new cupola to the top of the belfry onto which he raised a statue of Saint Raphael made by the sculptors Pedro de la Paz and Bernabé Gómez del Río. In 1727 the tower was damaged by another storm and in 1755 pieces of it (mainly decorative details) were damaged by the 1755 Lisbon Earthquake. A French architect, Baltasar Dreveton, was charged with restoring and repairing the structure over a period of 8 years.

In March 1748 construction on the choir stalls of the &quot;Capilla Mayor&quot; began, with the commission awarded to Pedro Duque Cornejo. It was initially funded with the help of a large bequest by Archdeacon José Díaz de Recalde in 1742. Work on the choir stalls finished in 1757, though Duque Cornejo – who had worked on it continuously for nearly a decade – died just two weeks before the finished choir was officially opened.

=== Modern restorations (19th–21st centuries) ===
In 1816 the original mihrab of the mosque was uncovered from behind the former altar of the old Chapel of San Pedro. Patricio Furriel was responsible for restoring the mihrab&#x27;s Islamic mosaics, including the portions which had been lost. Further restoration works concentrating on the former mosque structure were carried out between 1879 and 1923 under the direction of Velázquez Bosco, who among other things dismantled the baroque elements that had been added to the Villaviciosa Chapel and uncovered the earlier structures there. During this period, in 1882, the cathedral and mosque structure was declared a National Monument. Further research work and archaeological excavations were carried out on the mosque structure and in the Courtyard of the Oranges by Félix Hernández between 1931 and 1936. More recent scholars have noted that modern restorations since the 19th century have partly focused on &quot;re-islamicizing&quot; (in architectural terms) parts of the Mosque-Cathedral. This took place in the context of wider conservation efforts in Spain, starting in the 19th century, towards studying and restoring Islamic-era structures.

The Mosque-Cathedral was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1984, and in 1994 this status was extended to the entire historic centre of Cordoba. A restoration project began on the bell tower in 1991 and finished in 2014, while the transept and choir of the Renaissance cathedral were also restored between 2006 and 2009. Further restorations of features like chapels and some of the outer gates have continued to take place up to the late 2010s.

==Architecture==
The Great Mosque of Córdoba held a place of importance amongst the Islamic community of al-Andalus for centuries. In Córdoba, the Umayyad capital, the Mosque was seen as the heart and central focus of the city. To the people of al-Andalus &quot;the beauty of the mosque was so dazzling that it defied any description.&quot;

After all of its historical expansions, the mosque-cathedral covers an area of . The building&#x27;s original floor plan follows the overall form of some of the earliest mosques built from the very beginning of Islam. Some of its features had precedents in the Umayyad Mosque of Damascus, which was an important model built before it. It had a rectangular prayer hall with aisles arranged perpendicular to the &quot;qibla&quot;, the direction towards which Muslims pray. It has thick outer walls with a somewhat fortress-like appearance. To the north is a spacious courtyard (the former &quot;sahn&quot;), surrounded by an arcaded gallery, with gates on the north, west, and east sides, and fountains that replace the former mosque fountains used for ablutions. A bridge or elevated passage (the &quot;sabat&quot;) once existed on the west side of the mosque which connected the prayer hall directly with the Caliph&#x27;s palace across the street. Al-Razi, an Arab writer, speaks of the valuable wine-coloured marble, obtained from the mountains of the district, which was much used in embellishing the naves of the mosque.

The Christian-era additions (after 1236) included many small chapels throughout the building and various relatively cosmetic changes. The most substantial and visible additions are the cruciform nave and transept of the &quot;Capilla Mayor&quot; (the main chapel where Mass is held today) which were begun in the 16th century and inserted into the middle of the former mosque&#x27;s prayer hall, as well as the remodelling of the former minaret into a Renaissance-style bell tower.

=== The hypostyle hall ===

The mosque-cathedral&#x27;s hypostyle hall dates from the original mosque construction and originally served as its main prayer space for Muslims. The main hall of the mosque was used for a variety of purposes. It served as a central prayer hall for personal devotion, for the five daily Muslim prayers and the special Friday prayers accompanied by a sermon. It also would have served as a hall for teaching and for Sharia law cases during the rule of Abd al-Rahman I and his successors.

The hall was large and flat, with timber ceilings held up by rows of two-tiered arches resting on columns. The two-tiered arches consist of a lower tier of horseshoe arches and an upper tier of semi-circular arches.These rows of arches divided the original building into 11 aisles or &quot;naves&quot; running from north to south, later increased to 19 by Al-Mansur&#x27;s expansion, while in turn forming perpendicular aisles running east–west between the columns. The nave that leads to the &quot;mihrab&quot; – which was originally the central nave of the mosque until Al-Mansur&#x27;s lateral expansion of the building altered its symmetry – is slightly wider than the other naves, demonstrating a subtle hierarchy in the mosque&#x27;s floor plan.

The original mosque had some 120 columns All of the original columns and capitals were reused from earlier Roman and Visigothic buildings, but subsequent expansions (starting with Abd al-Rahman II) saw the incorporation of new Moorish-made capitals that evolved from earlier Roman models. The current building has approximately 850 columns made of jasper, onyx, marble, granite and porphyry.

The mosque&#x27;s architectural system of repeating two-tiered arches, with otherwise little surface decoration, is considered one of its most innovative characteristics and has been the subject of much commentary. The hypostyle hall has been variously described as resembling a &quot;forest of columns&quot; and having an effect similar to a &quot;hall of mirrors&quot;. Scholar Jerrilynn Dodds has further summarized the visual effect of the hypostyle hall with the following:

Interest in the mosque&#x27;s interior is created, then, not by the application of a skin of decoration to a separately conceived building but by the transformation of the morphemes of the architecture itself: the arches and voussoirs. Because we share the belief that architectural components must by definition behave logically, their conversion into agents of chaos fuels a basic subversion of our expectations concerning the nature of architecture. The tensions that grow from these subverted expectations create an intellectual dialogue between building and viewer that will characterize the evolving design of the Great Mosque of Cordoba for over two hundred years.

Much speculation has been offered on the inspiration for the arch design, often focusing on the possible influence of Umayyad architecture in the Levant, the homeland of Abd ar-Rahman I, where two-tiered arches were used in a simpler form. It is sometimes suggested that the design of the arches was meant to evoke a forest of palm trees from Abd ar-Rahman&#x27;s youth in Syria. The motivation for the two-tiered design may have been more technical: unlike the large spolia columns available in Damascus, the columns available for reuse in Córdoba were not tall enough to raise the ceiling to the desired height on their own, so the addition of a second tier of arches above the first tier was an innovative way to resolve this. The precedent of multi-tiered arches was also present in the Iberian Peninsula thanks to remaining Roman aqueducts (e.g. the Milagros Aqueduct at Mérida); therefore, these local influences may have been more significant.

The voussoirs of the arches alternate between red brick and white stone. Colour alternations like this were also common in Umayyad architecture in the Levant and in pre-Islamic architecture on the Iberian Peninsula. According to Anwar G. Chejne, the arches were inspired by those in the Dome of the Rock. Horseshoe arches were known in the Iberian Peninsula in the Visigothic period (e.g. the 7th-century Church of San Juan de Baños) and to a lesser extent in Byzantine and Umayyad regions of the Middle East. The traditional &quot;Moorish&quot; arch in al-Andalus developed into its own distinctive and slightly more sophisticated version.
The mosque&#x27;s original flat wooden ceiling was made of wooden planks and beams with carved and painted decoration. Preserved fragments of the original ceiling – some of which are now on display in the Courtyard of the Oranges – were discovered in the 19th century and have allowed modern restorers to reconstruct the ceilings of some of the western sections of the mosque according to their original style. The eastern naves of the hall (in al-Mansur&#x27;s expansion), by contrast, are now covered by high Gothic vaults which were added in the 16th century by Hernan Ruiz I. On the exterior, the building has gabled roofs covered in tiles.

==== Dome of the Villaviciosa Chapel ====
In the nave or aisle of the hypostyle hall which leads to the mihrab, at the spot which marks the beginning of Al-Hakam&#x27;s 10th-century extension, is a monumental ribbed dome with ornate decoration. The ribs of this dome have a different configuration than those of the domes in front of the mihrab. Their intersection creates a square space in the center with an octagonal scalloped cupola added over this. In total, this intersection of ribs creates 17 vaulted compartments of square or triangular shape, in different sizes, each further decorated with a variety of miniature ribbed domes, star-shaped mini-domes, and scalloped shapes.

The space under this dome was surrounded on three sides by elaborate screens of interlacing polylobed arches, similar to those of the &quot;maqsura&quot; to the south but even more intricate. This architectural ensemble apparently marked the transition from the old mosque to Al-Hakam II&#x27;s expansion, which some scholars see as having a status similar to a &quot;mosque-within-a-mosque&quot;.

The dome is now part of the Villaviciosa Chapel and two of the three intersecting arch screens are still present (the western one has disappeared and been replaced by the 15th-century Gothic nave added to the chapel). Both the ribbed dome and the intersecting arches, along with the domes and arches of the &quot;maqsura&quot;, were influential in subsequent Moorish architecture, re-appearing in simpler but imaginative forms in the small Bab al-Mardum Mosque in Toledo and giving rise to other ornamental derivations like the later stucco domes of the Great Mosque of Tlemcen and the Great Mosque of Taza.
==== The &quot;mihrab&quot; and the &quot;maqsura&quot; ====

At the south end of the prayer hall is a richly-decorated &quot;mihrab&quot; (niche symbolizing the direction of prayer) surrounded by an architecturally-defined &quot;maqsura&quot; (an area reserved for the emir or caliph during prayer), which date from the expansion of Caliph Al-Hakam II after 965. This &quot;maqsura&quot; area covers three bays along the southern qibla wall in front of the mihrab, and was marked off from the rest of the mosque by an elaborate screen of intersecting horseshoe and polylobed arches; a feature which would go on to be highly influential in the subsequent development of Moorish architecture. The mihrab opens in the wall at the middle of this &quot;maqsura&quot;, while two doors flank it on either side. The door on the right, &quot;Bab al-Sabat&quot; (&quot;door of the &quot;sabat&quot;&quot;), gave access to a passage which originally led to the &quot;sabat&quot;, an elevated passage over the street which connected the mosque to the caliph&#x27;s palace. The door on the left, &quot;Bab Bayt al-Mal&quot; (&quot;door of the treasury&quot;), led to a treasury located behind the qibla wall (now partly occupied by the cathedral&#x27;s treasury).

The mihrab consists of a horseshoe arch leading to a small heptagonal chamber covered by a shell-shaped cupola above a ring of polylobed blind arches and carvings. This is the earliest known mihrab that consists of an actual room rather than just a niche in the wall. Under the horseshoe arch are two pairs of short marble columns with capitals – each pair featuring one red column and one dark green column – that are believed to have been reused from the mihrab of Abd al-Rahman II&#x27;s earlier expansion of the mosque. The mihrab is, in turn, surrounded by a typical arrangement of radiating arch decoration and a rectangular framing or &quot;alfiz&quot;, which is also seen in the design of the earlier western mosque gate of &quot;Bab al-Wuzara&quot; (the &quot;Puerta de San Esteban&quot; today) and was likely also present in the design of the mosque&#x27;s first mihrab. Above this &quot;alfiz&quot; is another decorative blind arcade of polylobed arches. The lower walls on either side of the mihrab are panelled with marble carved with intricate arabesque vegetal motifs, while the spandrels above the arch are likewise filled with carved arabesques. The voussoirs of the arch, however, as well as the rectangular &quot;alfiz&quot; frame and the blind arcade above it, are all filled with gold and glass mosaics. Those in the voussoirs and the blind arcade form vegetal and floral motifs, while those in the &quot;alfiz&quot; and in smaller bands at the springs of the arch contain Arabic inscriptions in Kufic script. The two doors on either side of the mihrab section are also framed by similar, but less elaborate, mosaic decoration.

The three bays of the &quot;maqsura&quot; area (the space in front of the mihrab and the spaces in front of the two side doors) are each covered by ornate ribbed domes. The use of intersecting arches in this area also solved the problem of creating additional support to bear the weight and thrust of these domes. The domes themselves are built with eight intersecting stone ribs. Rather than meeting in the center of the dome, the ribs intersect one another off-center, forming an eight-pointed star with an octagonal &quot;scalloped&quot; cupola in the center. The middle dome, in front of the mihrab, is especially elaborate and is also covered by mosaic decoration.

Scholars have affirmed that the style of the mosaics in this part of the mosque is heavily influenced by Byzantine mosaics, which corroborates historical accounts of the Caliph requesting expert mosaicists from the Byzantine emperor at the time, who agreed and sent him a master craftsman. Scholars have argued that this use of Byzantine mosaics is also part of a general desire – whether conscious or not – by the Cordoban Umayyads to evoke connections to the early Umayyad Caliphate in the Middle East, in particular to the Great Umayyad Mosque of Damascus, where Byzantine mosaics were a prominent element of the decoration.

===== Arabic inscriptions =====

The Arabic inscriptions in the decoration around the &quot;mihrab&quot; are the first major example of a program of political-religious inscriptions inserted into Andalusi architecture. They contain selected excerpts from the Qur&#x27;an as well as foundation inscriptions praising the patron (Caliph Al-Hakam II) and the people who assisted in the construction project.

The largest inscription of the &quot;alfiz&quot; (rectangular frame) around the &quot;mihrab&quot;, executed with mosaics in gold Kufic characters on a dark background, begins with two excerpts from the Qur&#x27;an (&quot;Surah&quot; 32:6 and &quot;Surah&quot; 40:65), translated as:

This is followed by a text commemorating al-Hakam&#x27;s expansion:

Immediately inside this rectangular inscription frame is a shorter inscription in a horizontal mosaic band above the &quot;mihrab&quot;, in dark letters against a gold background, which quotes &quot;Surah&quot; 59:23, translated as:

More inscriptions are carved into the stone imposts on either side of the mihrab niche&#x27;s arch, above the small engaged columns. They include a commemoration of al-Hakam II&#x27;s command to &quot;set up these two supports of what he has founded upon purity and with sanction from God&quot;, along with a portion of &quot;Surah&quot; 7:43. The &quot;two supports&quot; may be a reference to the columns of the mihrab, but the wider text likely adds a metaphorical and more religious interpretation.
An inscription is also included in the mosaics of the middle dome of the &quot;maqsura&quot;, in front of the &quot;mihrab&quot;. It runs around the base of the central octagonal cupola and contains verses from the Qur&#x27;an (&quot;Surah&quot; 22: 77–78). The translation reads:

Nuha N. N. Khoury, a scholar of Islamic architecture, has interpreted this collection of inscriptions in al-Hakam II&#x27;s expansion of the building as an attempt to present the mosque as a &quot;universal Islamic shrine&quot;, similar to the mosques of Mecca and Medina, and to portray Caliph al-Hakam II as the instrument through which God built this shrine. This framed the official history of the Umayyad dynasty in prophetic terms, promoting the idea of the new Umayyad caliphs in Cordoba as having a universal prerogative in the Islamic world.

=== The courtyard ===

The courtyard is known today as the &quot;Patio de los Naranjos&quot; or &quot;Courtyard of the Orange Trees&quot;. Until the 11th century, the mosque courtyard (also known as a &quot;sahn&quot;) was unpaved earth with citrus and palm trees irrigated at first by rainwater cisterns and later by aqueduct. Excavation indicates the trees were planted in a pattern, with surface irrigation channels. The stone channels visible today are not original. As in most mosque courtyards, it had fountains or water basins to help Muslims perform ritual ablutions before prayer. The arches that marked the transition from the courtyard to the interior of the prayer hall were originally open and allowed natural light to penetrate the interior, but most of these arches were walled up during the Christian period (after 1236) as chapels were built along the northern edge of the hall. The courtyard of the original mosque of Abd ar-Rahman I had no surrounding gallery or portico, but it is believed that one was added by Abd ar-Rahman III between 951 and 958. The current gallery, however, was rebuilt with a similar design by architect Hernán Ruiz I under Bishop Martín Fernández de Angulo between 1510 and 1516. The current layout of the gardens and trees is the result of work carried out under Bishop Francisco Reinoso between 1597 and 1601. Today the courtyard is planted with rows of orange trees, cypresses, and palm trees.

=== Bell tower and former minaret ===

Abd al-Rahman III added the mosque&#x27;s first minaret (tower used by the muezzin for the call to prayer) in the mid-10th century. The minaret has since disappeared after it was partly demolished and encased in the Renaissance bell tower that is visible today. It was designed by Hernán Ruiz III and built between 1593 and 1617. The minaret&#x27;s original appearance, however, was reconstructed by modern Spanish scholar Félix Hernández Giménez with the help archeological evidence as well as historical texts and representations. (For example, the two coat-of-arms on the present-day cathedral&#x27;s Puerta de Santa Catalina depict the tower as it appeared before its later reconstruction.)
The original minaret was 47 meters high and had a square base measuring 8.5 meters per side. Like other Andalusi and North African minarets after it, it was composed of a main shaft and a smaller secondary tower or &quot;lantern&quot; (also with a square base) which surmounted it. The lantern tower was in turn surmounted by a dome and topped by a finial in the shape of a metal rod with two golden spheres and one silver sphere (often referred to as &quot;apples&quot;) decreasing in size towards the top. The main tower contained two staircases, which were built for the separate ascent and descent of the tower. About half-way up, the stairways were lit by sets of horseshoe-arch windows whose arches were decorated with voussoirs of alternating colours which were in turn surrounded by a rectangular &quot;alfiz&quot; frame (similar to the decoration seen around the arches of the mosque&#x27;s outer gates). On two of the tower&#x27;s façades there were three of these windows side by side, while on the two other façades the windows were arranged in two pairs. These double pairs or triplets of windows were repeated on the level above. Just below the summit of the main shaft on each façade, above the windows, was a row of nine smaller windows of equivalent shape and decoration. The top edge of the main shaft was crowned with a balustrade of sawtooth-shaped merlons (similar to those commonly found in Morocco). The lantern tower was decorated by another horseshoe archway on each of its four façades, again featuring an arch of alternating voussoirs framed within an &quot;alfiz&quot;.

Construction of a new cathedral bell tower to encase the old minaret began in 1593 and, after some delays, was finished in 1617. It was designed by architect Hernan Ruiz III (grandson of Hernan Ruiz I), who built the tower up to the bell&#x27;s level but died before its completion. His plans were followed and completed by Juan Sequero de Matilla. The bell tower is 54 meters tall and is the tallest structure in the city. It consists of a solid square shaft up to the level of the bells, where serliana-style openings feature on all four sides. Above this is a lantern structure which in turn is surmounted by a cupola. The dome at the summit is topped by a sculpture of Saint Raphael which was added in 1664 by architect Gaspar de la Peña, who had been hired to perform other repairs and fix structural problems. The sculpture was made by Pedro de la Paz and Bernabé Gómez del Río. Next to the base of the tower is the &quot;Puerta del Perdón&quot; (&quot;Door of Forgiveness&quot;), one of the two northern gates of the building.

=== The &quot;Capilla Mayor&quot; and cruciform cathedral core ===

The cathedral&#x27;s main chapel (known from Spanish as the &quot;Capilla Mayor&quot;) is located at the cruciform nave and transept at the center of the building. This cruciform section was begun in 1523 and finished in 1607. The design was drafted by Hernan Ruiz I, the first architect in charge of the project, and was continued after his death by Hernan Ruiz II (his son) and then by Juan de Ochoa. As a result of this long period and the succession of architects, this cruciform section presents an interesting blend of styles. The first two architects introduced Gothic elements into the design which are visible in the elaborate tracery design of the stone vaults over the transept arms and above the altar. Juan de Ochoa finished the structure in a more Mannerist style typical at the time, finishing the project with an elliptical dome over the crossing and a barrel vault ceiling – with lunettes along the side – over the choir area.

The design and decoration of the ensemble includes extensive iconography. The Gothic-style vault over the main altar is carved with images of musical angels, saints, apostles, and an image of Emperor Charles V (Carlos V), with an image of Mary at the center. The many writings spread amongst the images in turn form a long litany to Mary. The elliptical dome of the crossing rests on four pendentives which are sculpted with images of the four evangelists. On the dome itself, are the images of the eight Fathers of the Church along the outer edge and an image of the Holy Trinity at its center, which together are part of a Counter-Reformist iconographic program. Over the choir area, the central area of the barrel vault ceiling is occupied by images of the Assumption, Saint Acisclus and Saint Victoria, while the sides feature images of David, Solomon, Daniel and Samuel along with the theological virtues.

==== Main altar ====
The altar of the &quot;Capilla Mayor&quot; was begun in 1618 and designed in a Mannerist style by Alonso Matías. After 1627 the works were taken over by Juan de Aranda Salazar, and the altar was finished in 1653. The sculpting was executed by the artists Sebastián Vidal and Pedro Freile de Guevara. The original paintings of the altar were executed by Cristóbal Vela Cobo but they were replaced in 1715 by the current paintings by Antonio Palomino. The altar consists of three vertical &quot;aisles&quot; flanked by columns with composite capitals. The central aisle houses the tabernacle (executed by Pedro Freile de Guevara) at its base, while its upper half is occupied by a canvas of the &quot;Assumption&quot;. The two aisles on the side contain four more canvases depicting four martyrs: &quot;Saint Acisclus&quot; and &quot;Saint Victoria&quot; on the bottom halves and &quot;Saint Pelagius&quot; and &quot;Saint Flora&quot; in the upper halves. The upper canvases are flanked by sculptures of Saint Peter and Saint Paul, and the central portion is topped by a relief sculpture of &quot;God the Father&quot;.

==== Choir stalls ====
The choir stalls, located across from the altar, were crafted from 1748 to 1757 and were executed by Pedro Duque Cornejo. The ensemble was carved mainly out of mahogany wood and features a row of 30 upper seats and a row of 23 lower seats, all intricately decorated with carvings, including a series of iconographic scenes. At the centre of the ensemble on the west side is a large episcopal throne, commissioned in 1752, that resembles the design of an altarpiece. The lower part of the thrones has three seats, but the most significant element is the upper part which features a life-size representation of the &quot;Ascension of Jesus.&quot; The last figure which stands above the summit of the ensemble is a sculpture of the Archangel Raphael.

===Doors===

==== Doors of the Islamic period ====

The &quot;Puerta de San Esteban&quot; (formerly the &quot;Bab al-Wuzara&quot; in Arabic) is one of the oldest well-preserved and historically significant gateways of Moorish architecture. It was originally the gate by which the Muslim emir and his officials entered the mosque and it presumably existed since the mosque&#x27;s first construction by Abd ar-Rahman I in the 8th century. However, its decoration was completed by Muhammad I in 855. Centuries of slow deterioration and restoration attempts have erased some elements of its decoration, but major original aspects of it remain. Its historical-architectural significance derives from being the earliest surviving example to display the classic ornamental features of Moorish gateways: a door topped by a horseshoe arch with voussoirs of alternating color, which in turn is framed by a rectangular &quot;alfiz&quot;.
Many other gates were added over the course of subsequent expansions of the mosque. These later gates have even more elaborate decoration, particularly from the 10th century during Al-Hakam II&#x27;s expansion (starting in 961), visible today on the western exterior façade of the former prayer hall. Al-Mansur&#x27;s final expansion of the mosque a few decades later (starting in 987–988), which extended the mosque laterally to the east, copied the design of the earlier gates of Al-Hakam II&#x27;s expansion. Al-Mansur&#x27;s doors are visible on the building&#x27;s current eastern façade. Some remains of the original eastern doors of Al-Hakam II&#x27;s expansion, before Al-Mansur&#x27;s displacement of the eastern wall, are still visible inside the mosque-cathedral today. The best-preserved example is the door popularly known as &quot;Puerta del Chocolate&quot; or &quot;Puerta del Punto&quot;, located next to the southern wall and serving today as the visitors&#x27; exit from the cathedral&#x27;s treasury rooms, which was formerly a door to the mosque&#x27;s treasury as well.

Many of the exterior gates have undergone various periods of decay and restoration. The most elaborate gates on the eastern wall today are in large part the work of 20th-century restorations. Many of the original Arabic inscriptions on these doors have nonetheless been preserved. Susana Calvo Capilla has noted that many of the inscriptions on the 10th-century gates have eschatological and proselytizing connotations, possibly reflecting a conscious rebuttal of heterodox religious currents that the authorities deemed threats at the time. Three of the doors, for example, include Qur&#x27;anic verses that deny Christian beliefs on the divinity of Christ.

==== Doors of the Christian period ====
After the mosque&#x27;s conversion to a cathedral in 1236, Spanish Christian designs were increasingly added to new or existing gates. The small &quot;Postigo de la Leche&quot; (&quot;Door of the Milk&quot;) on the west side of the building has Gothic details dating from 1475. Among the most notable monumental Christian-era portals are the &quot;Puerta de las Palmas&quot;, the &quot;Puerta de Santa Catalina&quot;, and the &quot;Puerta del Perdón&quot;.
The &quot;Puerta de las Palmas&quot; (Door of the Palms) is the grand ceremonial gate from the Courtyard of the Oranges to the cathedral&#x27;s interior, built on what was originally a uniform façade of open arches leading to the former mosque&#x27;s prayer hall. Originally called the &quot;Arco de Bendiciones&quot; (Arch of the Blessings), it was the setting for the ceremonial blessing of the royal flag, a ritual which was part of a Spanish monarch&#x27;s coronation ceremony. Its current form dates from the restoration and remodelling done by Hernán Ruiz I in 1533, who created a plateresque façade above the doorway. The facade&#x27;s statues depict the Annunciation while, unusually, the smaller figures in the lower corners depict mythological creatures.
The &quot;Puerta de Santa Catalina&quot; (Door of Saint Catherine) is the main eastern entrance to the Courtyard of the Oranges. Its name referred to the presence of a nearby Convent of Saint Catherine. Its current appearance dates from the work of Hernán Ruiz II, who took over work on the cathedral in 1547 after the passing of his father (Hernán Ruiz I). The gate has a Renaissance façade on its exterior: the doorway is flanked by two columns and is surmounted by a &quot;serliana&quot;-style composition of columns forming three alcoves topped by a curved lintel. Within the three alcoves are the remains of three murals depicting Saint Catherine (&quot;Santa Catalina&quot;), Saint Acisclus (&quot;San Acisclo&quot;) and Saint Victoria (&quot;Santa Victoria&quot;).

The &quot;Puerta del Perdón&quot; (Door of Forgiveness) is one of the most ritually important doors of the cathedral, located at the base of the bell tower and directly opposite the &quot;Puerta de las Palmas&quot;. A gate existed here since the Islamic period; its location is aligned with the mihrab of the mosque and with the central axis of the building before Al-Mansur&#x27;s expansion. Its first reconstruction in the Christian period of the building dates to 1377, but it has been modified several times since, notably by Sebastián Vidal in 1650. The faded mural paintings inside the blind arches above the outer doorway include a depiction of &quot;Our Lady of the Assumption&quot; in the middle, with &quot;Saint Michel&quot; and &quot;Saint Raphael&quot; on the sides.

==2000s Muslim campaigns==

Muslims across Spain have lobbied the Catholic Church to allow them to pray in the complex, with the Islamic Council of Spain lodging a formal request with the Vatican. However, Spanish church authorities and the Vatican have opposed this move. Muslim prayer has not been always banned outright and there are some cases of token concessions in the past, including Saddam Hussein&#x27;s prayer at the Mihrab in December 1974.

== Ownership dispute ==
The building was formally registered for the first time by the Córdoba&#x27;s Cathedral Cabildo in 2006 on the basis of the article 206 of the &quot;Ley Hipotecaria&quot; from 1946 (whose constitutionality has been questioned). The diocese never presented a formal title of ownership nor did provide a judicial sentence sanctioning the usurpation on the basis of a long-lasting occupation, with the sole legal argument being that of the building&#x27;s &quot;consecration&quot; after 1236, as a cross-shaped symbol of ash was reportedly drawn on the floor at the time. Defenders of the ecclesial ownership argue on the basis of continuous and peaceful occupation of the building by the Church whereas defenders of the public ownership argue that the mosque-cathedral never ceased to be a State&#x27;s property, initially belonging to the Crown of Castile (and henceforth the Spanish State).

PSOE&#x27;s Isabel Ambrosio, Mayor of Córdoba from 2015 to 2019, defended a model of public and shared management. In July 2019, the mayor of Córdoba, José María Bellido, closed down a commission investigating ownership rights, saying it should be reserved for Catholic worship. He noted, &quot;There are no administrative tasks arising from this commission and I&#x27;ve no intention of reactivating it.&quot;

== Legacy ==

By leaving the mosque to coexist with the cathedral, the building is a physical repository of power struggles in Spain. Additionally, it is a showcase of architectural hybridity, representing ideological intersections between Christianity and Islam.

=== Architectural influence ===

The Great Mosque of Cordoba is a high point of the architecture of al-Andalus and one of the most important monuments of early Islamic architecture. It had a major influence on the subsequent architecture of Al-Andalus and of the Maghreb – what is known as &quot;Moorish&quot; architecture or western Islamic architecture – due to both its architectural innovations and its symbolic importance as the religious heart of the region&#x27;s historic Cordoban Caliphate. Amira Bennison, for example, goes on to comment:

Jonathan Bloom also comments: 
Among other examples of important precedents, the overall form of the 8th or 9th-century &quot;Bab al-Wuzara&quot; gate (&quot;Puerta de San Esteban&quot; today), with its horseshoe arch, voussoirs of alternating colours, and rectangular &quot;alfiz&quot; frame, became one of the most recurring motifs of Islamic architecture in the region. The minaret commissioned by Abd ar-Rahman III in 951–952 was also highly influential and became the model for later minarets in the Maghreb and al-Andalus. Georges Marçais traces the possible origins of some later architectural motifs to the complex arches of Al-Hakam II&#x27;s expansion, most notably the interlacing arches of the Aljafería in Zaragoza (11th century), the polylobed arches found throughout the region after the 10th century, and the &quot;sebka&quot; motif which became ubiquitous in Marinid, Zayyanid and Nasrid architecture after the Almohad period (12th-13th centuries). One exception to this legacy of influences was the mosaic decoration of the mosque&#x27;s 10th-century mihrab, which, although admired, was not emulated by later architects.

The ribbed domes of al-Hakam II&#x27;s expansion are also a curious innovation whose origins have been debated, but the appearance of similar (though simpler) domes in the small Bab al-Mardum Mosque in Toledo demonstrates that this feature spread into architectural designs beyond Cordoba. The domes also served as inspiration for the intricate ribbed dome made of plaster in the Great Mosque of Tlemcen (present-day Algeria), built by the Almoravids in the early 12th century, which in turn probably inspired similar domes built by the Marinids in the Great Mosque of Fes el-Jdid and the Great Mosque of Taza (present-day Morocco) in the late 13th century.

===In popular culture===
A posthumous poetical illustration by Letitia Elizabeth Landon to an engraving of a painting by David Roberts, was published in Fisher&#x27;s Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1840. Entitled &quot;The Mosque at Cordova&quot;, this harks back to &#x27;the Moslem rule in Spain&#x27;.

The South Asian Muslim philosopher and poet Muhammad Iqbal, who is widely regarded as having inspired the Pakistan Movement, visited the Great Cathedral of Córdoba in 1931–32. He asked the authorities to offer &quot;adhan&quot; at the cathedral and was even allowed to offer his prayers there. The deep emotional responses that the mosque evoked in him found expression in his poem called &quot;The Mosque of Cordoba&quot;. Allama Iqbal saw it as a cultural landmark of Islam and described it as:
Louis L&#x27;Amour&#x27;s &quot;The Walking Drum&quot; features a detailed description of the Court of Oranges in the 12th century.

<text>William Howard Stein (June 25, 1911 – February 2, 1980) was an American biochemist who collaborated in the determination of the ribonuclease sequence, as well as how its structure relates to catalytic activity, earning a Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1972 for his work. Stein was also involved in the invention of the automatic amino acid analyzer, an advancement in chromatography that opened the door to modern methods of chromatography, such as liquid chromatography and gas chromatography.

==Life and education==

=== Early life and education ===
William H. Stein was born on June 25, 1911 in New York City into a Jewish family. His father, Fred M. Stein, was a businessman who retired early to support local New York health organizations. His mother, Beatrice Borg Stein, was a children&#x27;s rights activist who developed afterschool activities. Staunch advocates for the welfare of society, Stein&#x27;s parents fostered his interests in the life sciences from a young age. As a child, Stein attended the recently established &quot;progressive&quot; Lincoln School which was sponsored by the Teachers College of Columbia University; there, he was able to explore the natural sciences through field trips and science projects. At the age of sixteen, Stein was transferred to the Phillips Exeter Academy in New England to prepare for higher education.

In 1936, during his graduate studies at Columbia University, William H. Stein married Phoebe Hockstader. They had three sons together: William H. Stein, Jr., David F. Stein, and Robert J. Stein. Stein lived with his family in New York the rest of his life—mainly in Manhattan and briefly in Scarsdale, New York.

=== Academic career ===
William H. Stein began his higher education as a chemistry major at Harvard University in 1929. He spent one year as a graduate student at Harvard University before transferring to the Department of Biological Chemistry at the College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, in 1934 to focus on biochemistry. Hans Thatcher Clarke, the chairman of the department at the time, was collecting many talented graduate students who would become the distinguished biochemists of the early twentieth century. In 1937, Stein completed his thesis on the amino acid composition of elastin, earning his Ph.D. Stein was introduced to potassium trioxalatochromate and ammonium rhodanilate by Max Bergmann, a Jewish-German biochemist who fled to the United States in 1934 under threat of Nazi occupation and worked in a laboratory at the Rockefeller Institute. He used these two precipitating agents to isolate the amino acids glycine and proline, respectively, for his research on elastin. With the conclusion of his academic career, Stein went on to work under Bergmann.

=== Later life and death ===

William H. Stein and his wife traveled around the world and hosted many prominent scientists in their own home in New York City throughout his scientific career. In addition to Stein&#x27;s long-term professorship at Rockefeller Institute, he served as a visiting professor to the University of Chicago in 1961 and Harvard University in 1964. Stein also lectured at the Washington University in St. Louis and Haverford College.

In 1969, Stein experienced sudden paralysis, diagnosed as Guillain–Barré syndrome, after developing a fever several days prior during a symposium in Copenhagen. Despite remaining quadriplegic the rest of his life, Stein&#x27;s colleagues alleged that his spirit and sense of humor endured. He continued to be a guiding presence at the Rockefeller Institute to his younger colleagues and their work on the study of RNase. At the age of sixty-eight, Stein experienced unexpected heart failure. William H. Stein died February 2, 1980 in New York City.

==Scientific career==

===Early work===
Following the completion of his formal education, Stein became a researcher under Bergmann at Rockefeller Institute, where much of his most important work was done. Stanford Moore joined Bergmann&#x27;s lab in 1939, where he and Stein began research focusing on amino acids. According to Moore, &quot;During the early years of our cooperation, Stein and I worked out a system of collaboration that lasted for a lifetime.&quot; Their work in this area was disrupted with the beginning of World War II, and they temporarily parted ways to aid the war efforts, Stein staying with Bergmann to research the molecular scale effect of blister agents on the human body. They began collaborating again, however, after Bergmann died in 1944 and they were given an opportunity by the Director of the Rockefeller Institute, Herbert S. Gasser, to continue Bergmann&#x27;s work in amino acids.

===Chromatography===
Stein and Moore developed a method to quantify and separate amino acids with column chromatography, using potato starch as the stationary phase. The fractions, originally collected manually, were collected in their newly developed automated fraction collector, and the amount of each amino acid was determined by an adjusted color reaction with ninhydrin. They began testing other methods of separation, such as ion exchange chromatography, to reduce the analysis time, as it took two weeks to analyze one protein using the starch columns. Ion exchange chromatography reduced the time to 5 days during initial experiments, and eventually Stein and Moore whittled the process down even further with the help of Daryl Spackman, which resulted in the first automatic amino acid analyzer. Along with their well-known work in protein sequences, this automatic amino acid analyzer was also utilized in Stein&#x27;s study of amino acids in human urine and blood plasma.

===Determination of protein sequences===
With their success in improving the analysis time for amino acids, Stein and Moore began to determine the structure of an entire protein molecule, specifically bovine ribonuclease, in the early 1950s. They determined the entire sequence of ribonuclease by 1960. This sequence combined with X-ray analysis of the crystallized ribonuclease lead to the determination of the nuclease&#x27;s active site. Stein won a Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1972 with Moore and Christian Boehmer Anfinsen, for their work on ribonuclease and &quot;for their contribution to the understanding of the connection between chemical structure and catalytic activity of the ribonuclease molecule.&quot;

== Awards and honors ==

=== Awards ===
William H. Stein received a number of awards for his contributions to the biochemical field, including:

* American Chemical Society Award in Chromatography and Electrophoresis (1964) with Stanford Moore
* Richards Medal of the American Chemical Society (1972) with Stanford Moore
* Kaj Linderstrøm-Lang Award, Copenhagen (1972) with Stanford Moore
* The Nobel Prize in Chemistry (1972) with Stanford Moore and Christian B. Anfinsen

=== Honors ===
William H. Stein received numerous honors from Columbia University and the Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University, including: D.Sc. &quot;honoris causa,&quot; Columbia University (1973), D.Sc. &quot;honoris causa,&quot; Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University (1973), and the Award of Excellence Medal, Columbia University Graduate Faculty and Alumni Association (1973).

=== Scientific societies ===
William H. Stein was a member of several scientific societies, including the: National Academy of Sciences (elected to membership in 1960), American Academy of Arts and Sciences (elected to membership in 1960), American Society of Biological Chemists, Biochemical Society of London, American Chemical Society, American Association for the Advancement of Science, and Harvey Society of New York.

<text>Henry Andrew Pogorzelski (September 26, 1922 - December 30, 2015) was an American mathematician of Polish descent, a professor of mathematics at the University of Maine. Much of Pogorzelski&#x27;s research concerns the Goldbach conjecture, the still-unsolved problem of whether every even number can be represented as a sum of two prime numbers.

Born in Harrison, New Jersey, Pogorzelski served in the U.S. Army in World War II. He served as editor of &quot;Mathematical Reviews&quot; from 1957 to 1964 and studied at the Institute for Advanced Study under André Weil. He received his Ph.D. from CUNY in 1969 under the advisor Raymond Smullyan; his dissertation was on &quot;Goldbach Sentences in Some Abstract Arithmetics Constructed from a Generalization of Ordinary Recursive Arithmetic&quot;. In 1974, after he had joined the Maine faculty, he was the only American invited by the Polish Academy of Science to visit Poland for the celebration of the 500th anniversary of the birth of Copernicus. In 2002, the University of Maine attempted to suspend Pogorzelski from teaching duties, but backed down after he filed an age discrimination complaint.

As well as holding a faculty position at the University of Maine, Pogorzelski was the director of the Research Institute for Mathematics (formerly known as the Research Institute for Semiological Mathematics), an independent research institute located near the University of Maine in Orono, Maine and modeled after the Institute for Advanced Study. He proposed in 1993 to offer doctorates through the institute; the proposal was rejected at the time, but the Research Institute for Mathematics is now the only institution in Maine that grants doctoral degrees in mathematics.
Henry Pogorzelski died December 30, 2015, in Orono, Maine.

<text>Patrice Ann &quot;Pat&quot; Murphy (born March 9, 1955) is an American science writer and author of science fiction and fantasy novels.

==Early life==
Murphy was born on March 9, 1955, in Washington state.

==Career==
Murphy has used the ideas of the absurdist pseudophilosophy pataphysics in some of her writings. Along with Lisa Goldstein and Michaela Roessner, she has formed The Brazen Hussies to promote their work. Together with Karen Joy Fowler, Murphy co-founded the James Tiptree, Jr. Award in 1991.

With her second novel, &quot;The Falling Woman&quot; (1986), she won the Nebula Award, and another Nebula Award in the same year for her novelette, &quot;Rachel in Love.&quot; Her short story collection, &quot;Points of Departure&quot; (1990) won the Philip K. Dick Award, and her 1990 novella, &quot;Bones&quot;, won the World Fantasy Award in 1991.

From 1998 through 2018, Pat Murphy and Paul Doherty (a scientist and educator) jointly wrote the recurring &#x27;Science&#x27; column in the &quot;Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction&quot; that typically appeared twice each year. Their last column was in the May/June 2018 issue; Doherty died in August 2017.

==Personal life==
She lives in Nevada and, for more than 20 years, when she was not writing science fiction, she worked at the Exploratorium, San Francisco&#x27;s museum of science, art, and human perception. There, she published non-fiction as part of the museum staff.

In 2014, Murphy was hired by Doug Peltz to join Mystery Science (company) as the first employee, creating science curriculum for elementary school teachers.

She has a black belt in the martial art kenpō.

<text>Jack Steinberger (born Hans Jakob Steinberger; May 25, 1921December 12, 2020) was a German-born American physicist noted for his work with neutrinos, the subatomic particles considered to be elementary constituents of matter. He was a recipient of the 1988 Nobel Prize in Physics, along with Leon M. Lederman and Melvin Schwartz, for the discovery of the muon neutrino. Through his career as an experimental particle physicist, he held positions at the University of California, Berkeley, Columbia University (1950–68), and the CERN (1968–86). He was also a recipient of the United States National Medal of Science in 1988, and the Matteucci Medal from the Italian Academy of Sciences in 1990.

==Early life and education==
Steinberger was born in the city of Bad Kissingen in Bavaria, Germany, on May 25, 1921, into a Jewish family. The rise of Nazism in Germany, with its open anti-Semitism, prompted his parents, Ludwig Lazarus (a cantor and religious teacher) and Berta May Steinberger, to send him out of the country.

Steinberger emigrated to the United States at the age of 13, making the trans-Atlantic trip with his brother Herbert. Jewish charities in the U.S. arranged for Barnett Farroll to care for him as a foster child. Steinberger attended New Trier Township High School, in Winnetka, Illinois. He was reunited with his parents and younger brother in 1938.

Steinberger studied chemical engineering at Armour Institute of Technology (now Illinois Institute of Technology) but left after his scholarship ended to help supplement his family&#x27;s income. He obtained a bachelor&#x27;s degree in chemistry from the University of Chicago, in 1942. Shortly thereafter, he joined the Signal Corps at MIT. With the help of the G.I. Bill, he returned to graduate studies at the University of Chicago in 1946, where he studied under Edward Teller and Enrico Fermi. His Ph.D. thesis concerned the energy spectrum of electrons emitted in muon decay; his results showed that this was a three-body decay, and implied the participation of two neutral particles in the decay (later identified as the electron (formula_1) and muon (formula_2) neutrinos) rather than one.

==Career==

=== Early research ===
After receiving his doctorate, Steinberger attended the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton for a year. In 1949 he published a calculation of the lifetime of the neutral pion, which anticipated the study of anomalies in quantum field theory.

Following Princeton, in 1949, Steinberger went to the Radiation Lab at the University of California at Berkeley, where he performed an experiment which demonstrated the production of neutral pions and their decay to photon pairs. This experiment utilized the 330 MeV synchrotron and the newly invented scintillation counters. Despite this and other achievements, he was asked to leave the Radiation Lab at Berkeley in 1950, due to his refusal to sign the so-called non-Communist Oath.

Steinberger accepted a faculty position at Columbia University in 1950. The newly commissioned meson beam at Nevis Labs provided the tool for several important experiments. Measurements of the production cross-section of pions on various nuclear targets showed that the pion has odd parity. A direct measurement of the production of pions on a liquid hydrogen target, then not a common tool, provided the data needed to show that the pion has spin zero. The same target was used to observe the relatively rare decay of neutral pions to a photon, an electron, and a positron. A related experiment measured the mass difference between the charged and neutral pions based on the angular correlation between the neutral pions produced when the negative pion is captured by the proton in the hydrogen nucleus. Other important experiments studied the angular correlation between electron–positron pairs in neutral pion decays, and established the rare decay of a charged pion to an electron and neutrino; the latter required use of a liquid-hydrogen bubble chamber.

===Investigations of strange particles===
During 1954–1955, Steinberger contributed to the development of the bubble chamber with the construction of a 15 cm device for use with the Cosmotron at Brookhaven National Laboratory. The experiment used a pion beam to produce pairs of hadrons with strange quarks to elucidate the puzzling production and decay properties of these particles. In 1956, he used a 30 cm chamber outfitted with three cameras to discover the neutral Sigma hyperon and measure its mass. This observation was important for confirming the existence of the SU(3) flavor symmetry which hypothesizes the existence of the strange quark.

An important characteristic of the weak interaction is its violation of parity symmetry. This characteristic was established through the measurement of the spins and parities of many hyperons. Steinberger and his collaborators contributed several such measurements using large (75 cm) liquid-hydrogen bubble chambers and separated hadron beams at Brookhaven. One example is the measurement of the invariant mass distribution of electron–positron pairs produced in the decay of Sigma-zero hyperons to Lambda-zero hyperons.

===Neutrinos and the weak neutral current===
In the 1960s, the emphasis in the study of the weak interaction shifted from strange particles to neutrinos. Leon Lederman, Steinberger and Schwartz built large spark chambers at Nevis Labs and exposed them in 1961 to neutrinos produced in association with muons in the decays of charged pions and kaons. They used the Alternating Gradient Synchrotron (AGS) at Brookhaven, and obtained a number of convincing events in which muons were produced, but no electrons. This result, for which they received the Nobel Prize in 1988, proved the existence of a type of neutrino associated with the muon, distinct from the neutrino produced in beta decay.

===Study of CP violation===
The CP violation (charge conjugation and parity) was established in the neutral kaon system in 1964. Steinberger recognized that the phenomenological parameter epsilon (&quot;ε&quot;) which quantifies the degree of CP violation could be measured in interference phenomena (See CP violation). In collaboration with Carlo Rubbia, he performed an experiment while on sabbatical at CERN during 1965 which demonstrated robustly the expected interference effect, and also measured precisely the difference in mass of the short-lived and long-lived neutral kaon masses.

Back in the United States, Steinberger conducted an experiment at Brookhaven to observe CP violation in the semi-leptonic decays of neutral kaons. The charge asymmetry relates directly to the epsilon parameter, which was thereby measured precisely. This experiment also allowed the deduction of the phase of epsilon, and confirmed that CPT is a good symmetry of nature.

===CERN===
In 1968, Steinberger left Columbia University and accepted a position as a department director at CERN. He constructed an experiment there utilizing multi-wire proportional chambers (MWPC), recently invented by Georges Charpak. The MWPCs, augmented by micro-electronic amplifiers, allowed much larger samples of events to be recorded. Several results for neutral kaons were obtained and published in the early 1970s, including the observation of the rare decay of the neutral kaon to a muon pair, the time dependence of the asymmetry for semi-leptonic decays, and a more-precise measurement of the neutral kaon mass difference. A new era in experimental technique was opened.

These new techniques proved crucial for the first demonstration of direct CP-violation. The NA31 experiment at CERN was built in the early 1980s using the CERN SPS 400 GeV proton synchrotron. As well as banks of MWPCs and a hadron calorimeter, it featured a liquid argon electromagnetic calorimeter with exceptional spatial and energy resolution. NA31 showed that direct CP violation is real. 

Steinberger worked on the ALEPH experiment at the Large Electron–Positron Collider (LEP), where he served as the experiment&#x27;s spokesperson. Among the ALEPH experiment&#x27;s initial accomplishments was the precise measurement of the number of families of leptons and quarks in the Standard Model through the measurement of the decays of the Z boson.

He retired from CERN in 1986, and went on to become a professor at the Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa in Italy. He continued his association with the CERN laboratory through his visits into his 90s.

===Nobel Prize===
Steinberger was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1988, &quot;for the neutrino beam method and the demonstration of the doublet structure of the leptons through the discovery of the muon neutrino&quot;. He shared the prize with Leon M. Lederman and Melvin Schwartz; at the time of the research, all three experimenters were at Columbia University.

The experiment used charged pion beams generated with the Alternating Gradient Synchrotron at Brookhaven National Laboratory. The pions decayed to muons which were detected in front of a steel wall; the neutrinos were detected in spark chambers installed behind the wall. The coincidence of muons and neutrinos demonstrated that a second kind of neutrino was created in association with muons. Subsequent experiments proved this neutrino to be distinct from the first kind (electron-type). Steinberger, Lederman and Schwartz published their work in &quot;Physical Review Letters&quot; in 1962.

He gave his Nobel medal to New Trier High School in Winnetka, Illinois (USA), of which he was an alumnus.

He was also awarded the National Medal of Science in 1988, by the then US president, Ronald Reagan and was the recipient of the Matteucci Medal in 1990, from the Italian Academy of Sciences.

== Personal life ==
Steinberger&#x27;s first marriage to Joan Beauregard ended in a divorce, after which he married his former student, biologist Cynthia Alff. He had four children, two from each of his marriages. His son Ned Steinberger is the founder of the eponymous company for headless guitars and basses, and his daughter Julia Steinberger is an ecological economist at the University of Lausanne. As an atheist and a humanist, Steinberger was a Humanist Laureate in the International Academy of Humanism. In his own words, he is noted to have enjoyed tennis, mountaineering and sailing.

In the 1980s Steinberger resumed relations with his native town Bad Kissingen. He often visited Bad Kissingen after that. The school he had attended there was named &quot;Jack-Steinberger-Gymnasium&quot; in 2001. In 2006 Steinberger was made honorary citizen of Bad Kissingen. &quot;I feel welcome in Bad Kissingen. This is my hometown and I was raised there. I feel as a German again now&quot; he told the Bavarian broadcasting company &quot;Bayerischer Rundfunk&quot; in 2013.

He died on December 12, 2020, at his home in Geneva. He was aged 99.

<doc id="789055" wikidata="Q7449586" url="?curid=789055" title="Semiotic democracy">
<text>Semiotic democracy is a phrase first coined by John Fiske, a media studies professor, in his seminal media studies book &quot;Television Culture&quot; (1987). Fiske defined the term as the &quot;delegation of the production of meanings and pleasures to [television&#x27;s] viewers.&quot; Fiske discussed how rather than being passive couch potatoes that absorbed information in an unmediated way, viewers actually gave their own meanings to the shows they watched that often differed substantially from the meaning intended by the show&#x27;s producer.

Subsequently, this term was appropriated by the technical and legal community in the context of any re-working of cultural imagery by someone who is not the original author. Examples include fan fiction and slash fiction.

Legal scholars are concerned that just as technology eases the process of cheaply making and distributing derivative works imbued with new cultural meanings available to wide public, copyright and right-to-publicity law is clamping down on and limiting these works, thus reducing their promulgation, and limiting semiotic democracy.

Prof. Terry Fisher of Harvard Law School has written about semiotic democracy in the context of the crisis facing the entertainment industry and in terms of the ability of people to use the Internet in creative new ways.

== Biography ==

Laurence A. Steinhardt was born October 6, 1892, at his family home (23 East 92nd Street) in New York City. As a native New Yorker, he was educated at the Franklin School for Boys and graduated from Columbia University with an A.B in 1913, an M.A. in 1915 and an LL.B. in 1915 from Columbia Law School. He became a member of Pi Lambda Phi fraternity (New York) in 1909, National President in 1915, and Supreme Rex for life from 1939 to 1950. He was permanent treasurer of the class of 1913 and class of 1915 Columbia Law School.

He was the son of Adolph Maximillian Steinhardt (one of the founders and executive heads of National Enameling and Stamping Co.) and Addie Untermyer Steinhardt (a sister to noted lawyer Samuel Untermyer).

He married Dulcie Yates Hofmann, daughter of Henry Hofmann (banker) and Ina Maitland Yates Hofmann, on January 15, 1923. He had one daughter, Dulcie-Ann Steinhardt (1925–2001).

He practiced accountancy with Deloitte, Plender and Griffiths, was admitted to the New York bar in October 1915, enlisted in the U.S Army 60th Field Artillery in 1916 as a private/sharpshooter, was honorably discharged in 1918 as a sergeant Quartermaster Corps after serving as associate counsel on the Provost Marshal General Staff. He served as counsel for the Housing and Health Division of the War Department in 1919, and was a member of the law firm Guggenheimer, Untermyer and Marshall from 1920 to 1933. Other notable jurists and family members of Guggenheimer, Untermyer and Marshall were Samuel Untermyer, Louis Marshall, Charles S. Guggenheimer, Alvin Untermyer and Irwin Untermyer.

In 1932, in active support of Governor Franklin D. Roosevelt’s pre-convention presidential campaign, he joined the inner campaign circle committee, composed of political notables Louis Howe, Jimmy Farley, Frank Walker, and Ed Flynn. Specifically, with his economic background on FDR&#x27;s finance committee, he wrote campaign speeches on the economics of the time for FDR.

In 1941, immediately prior to Germany&#x27;s bombing assault on Moscow and with only six hours notice, Steinhardt sent his wife, daughter and her governess, each carrying only one suitcase, out to Stockholm on one of the last planes departing with families of diplomats to any safer destinations within Europe. Steinhardt then returned his attention to the ongoing preparations to evacuate and accompany the remaining U.S. embassy staff to Kuybyshev (now Samara) and took seven days by train to go some 400 miles east of Moscow to this destination, designated by the Kremlin for remaining diplomats. Once the staff was situated in spartan housing with the entire stock of embassy foodstuffs brought along and sufficient to feed the greater diplomatic corps in addition to the staff, he returned to the U.S. embassy residence in Moscow during the bombings to secure the embassy with a skeleton staff of six. He was known within family circles to say he took great pride in working alongside his amazing staff in his embassy postings. In July of this period, the famed photographer, Margaret Bourke-White, managed to get into Moscow to the embassy residence so as to document the German bombings. On the nights of July 23 and July 26 she and Steinhardt lay on their backs on the roof of Spaso House while she photographed German bombs, Nazi parachute flares, tracer bullets, and anti-aircraft gunshots streaking across the nighttime sky overhead. Her portfolio assignment produced startling visual imagery for the American public in the issue of &quot;Life Magazine&quot;, Vol 11, No 9., pp. 15–21. dated September 1, 1941, Kuybyshev.

On January 12, 1942, Steinhardt was appointed Ambassador to Turkey. His mission directives included buying up all the available sources of chrome the Nazis needed for the manufacture of steel for their war machine. More importantly and much more challenging was the deep rooted presence in Istanbul of the highest flange of German diplomats led by German Ambassador Franz von Papen whose objective was to bring Turkey into the German side of the war. Steinhardt&#x27;s mission directive was to bring Turkey into the Allied side of the war. Each was crafty, intense, and possessed with the access to vast intelligence gathering network sources. Turkey was THE battleground during this critical period of 1942 to 1945 as so much hung in the balance, not the least of which was Turkey&#x27;s important geographic location, then and now. By 1944, Turkey had turned west to the Allies, an historical orientation originally seeded by Kemal Atatürk in 1923 to turn Turkey into a modern secular nation while still keeping its foundational character.

While Ambassador to Turkey, Steinhardt, in part due to his Jewish heritage, played a significant but not openly known role (due to his public diplomatic position) in numerous Jewish- related refugee transit evacuations: the rescue of Hungarian Jews from Bergen Belsen, Jewish children from Romania, and many eminent intellectuals fleeing Europe to find refuge in Turkey, Palestine, and the United States. In personal subterranean concert with the Vatican&#x27;s representative to Turkey, Papal Nuncio Cardinal Angelo Giuseppe Roncalli (1881–1963), they devised false visa schemes to facilitate the documents needed for transit through Turkey for fleeing refugees. Steinhardt and Ira Hirschmann of The War Refugee Board secured leaky boats wherever possible with no assurance of the safety of such vessels but the hope that anything might succeed if tried. While there were successes, sadly there were also tragedies and losses.

Cardinal Roncalli was elected in 1958 by the Vatican conclave to become Pope John XXIII and subsequently was canonized as a saint. The highest note of his papacy was Vatican II, also known as the Second Vatican Council (1962–1965).

On August 1, 1943, Operation Tidal Wave, the air attack by U.S. Army Air Forces based in Libya and Southern Italy, began their daring strategic bombing mission over the Ploiesti refineries and oilfields in Romania in order to deny the German war machine of needed fuel. This was aided by the uses of the Norden bombsight for pinpoint accuracy. This is now considered by many World War II military historians as one of the costliest and bloodiest missions of the war. Of the 53 aircraft and 660 crew members lost, many had little or no fuel to return to their bases, so they were instructed to ditch in neutral Turkey where there was a substantial American presence to assist and on which to fall back. Many a dark unlit night following the bombing raid, Steinhardt and his daughter, in a jeep with a small convoy of his embassy military personnel, sortied out into the wilds and deserts attempting to locate and return wounded American pilots, destroy the bombsights so the Germans would not know of their existence, return with the wounded, secretly patching them up by the embassy medical team and moving them quietly through channels back to their points of origin. Some were slipped out to the coast at Izmir and quietly put on sailboats bound for Lebanon or Palestine. Two flyers were smuggled out when Mrs. Steinhardt and her daughter suddenly announced their &quot;shopping trip&quot; to Beirut. Hidden under the sleeper bunks of Mrs. Steinhardt&#x27;s train compartment, they remained unknown to all until arrival at the border when they escaped.

Steinhardt was buried in Arlington National Cemetery.

==Family==
He married the former Dulcie Yates Hofmann (1895–1974) on January 15, 1923; one daughter, Dulcie-Ann Steinhardt (1925–2001).

<text>In a military context, the term front can have several meanings. According to official US Department of Defense and NATO definitions, a front can be &quot;the line of contact of two opposing forces.&quot; This front line can be a local or tactical front, or it can range to a theater. An example of the latter was the Western Front in France and Belgium in World War I.

Relatedly, front can refer to the direction of the enemy or, in the absence of combat, the direction towards which a military unit is facing. Conversely, the term &quot;home front&quot; has been used to denote conditions in the civilian sector of a country at war, including those involved in the production of matériel.

Front can also refer to the lateral space occupied by a military unit as measured from the extremity of one flank to the other. The amount of front occupied by a unit depends on many factors, including time period and available technology. For example, under the military doctrine of the Soviet Army and those which copied it, the amount front occupied by an attacking unit depended on its size. A division attacking with three regiments in the first echelon would maintain an attack zone of 15 to 25 kilometers wide. A regiment&#x27;s front was typically 4 to 5 kilometers wide, but could vary between 3 and 8 kilometers. This frontage decreased with each smaller unit involved: 2 to 3 kilometers for a battalion, 500 to 800 meters for a company, and 100 to 200 meters for a platoon.

Additionally, the Soviet Army used the term &quot;front&quot; to mean an army group; the Polish Armies used the same terminology during the Polish-Soviet War and World War II.

The term &quot;front line city&quot; was used by the Germans during their long retreat from Moscow/Stalingrad to refer to metropolitan centres that had become disputed by the two combatants. Designation of a city as such resulted in administrative changes (largely the imposition of martial law). In the film &quot;Downfall&quot;, the term was briefly referenced.

<text>James Stephens (9 February 1880 – 26 December 1950) was an Irish novelist and poet.

==Life==
===Early life===
James Stephens&#x27; birth is somewhat shrouded in mystery. Stephens himself claimed to have been born on the same day and same year as James Joyce (2 February 1882), whereas he is in fact probably the same James Stephens who is on record as being born at the Rotunda Hospital, Dublin, on 9 February 1880, the son of Francis Stephens () of 5 Thomas&#x27;s Court, Dublin, a vanman and a messenger for a stationer&#x27;s office, and his wife, Charlotte Collins (born ). His father died when Stephens was two years old, and when he was six years old, his mother remarried, and Stephens was committed to the Meath Protestant Industrial School for Boys in Blackrock for begging on the streets, where he spent much of the rest of his childhood. He attended school with his adoptive brothers Thomas and Richard (Tom and Dick) Collins before graduating as a solicitor&#x27;s clerk. They competed and won several athletic competitions despite James&#x27; tiny stature (he stood in his socks). He was known affectionately as &#x27;Tiny Tim&#x27;. He was much enthralled by the tales of military valour of his adoptive family and would have become a soldier except for his height.

===Career and nationalism===
By the early 1900s Stephens was increasingly inclined to socialism and the Irish language (he spoke and wrote Irish) and by 1912 was a dedicated Irish Republican. He was a close friend of the 1916 leader Thomas MacDonagh, who was then editor of &quot;The Irish Review&quot; and deputy headmaster in St Enda&#x27;s, the radical bilingual Montessori school run by PH Pearse and later manager of the Irish Theatre. Stephens spent much time with MacDonagh in 1911. His growing nationalism brought a schism with his adoptive family, but probably won him his job as registrar in the National Gallery of Ireland, where he worked between 1915 and 1925, having previously had an ill-paid job with the Mecredy firm of solicitors.

===Literary career===
James Stephens produced many retellings of Irish myths. His retellings are marked by a rare combination of humour and lyricism (&quot;Deirdre&quot;, (a legendary figure), and &quot;Irish Fairy Tales&quot; are often especially praised). He also wrote several original novels (&quot;The Crock of Gold&quot;, &quot;Demi-Gods&quot;) based loosely on Irish wonder tales. &quot;The Crock of Gold&quot; in particular has achieved enduring popularity and has often been reprinted.

Stephens began his career as a poet under the tutelage of poet and painter Æ (George William Russell). Stephens&#x27;s first book of poems, &quot;Insurrections&quot;, was published in 1909. His last book, &quot;Kings and the Moon&quot; (1938), was also a volume of verse.

Stephens&#x27;s influential account of the 1916 Easter Rising, &quot;Insurrection in Dublin&quot;, describes the effect of the deaths by execution of his friend Thomas MacDonagh and others as being &quot;like watching blood oozing from under a door&quot;. Of MacDonagh he wrote:

No person living is the worse off for having known Thomas MacDonagh, and I, at least, have never heard MacDonagh speak unkindly or even harshly of anything that lived. It has been said of him that his lyrics were epical; in a measure it is true, and it is true in the same measure that his death was epical. He was the first of the leaders who was tried and shot.

====James Joyce====
Stephens later lived between Paris, London and Dublin. During the 1930s he was a friend of James Joyce, and they wrongly believed that they shared a birthday. Joyce, who was concerned about his ability to finish what later became &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot;, proposed that Stephens assist him, with the authorship credited to JJ &amp; S (for &quot;Jameses Joyce &amp; Stephens&quot;, but also a pun on the popular Jameson Irish whiskey, made by John Jameson &amp; Sons). The plan was never implemented, as Joyce was able to complete the work on his own.

===Late life===
During the last decade of his life Stephens found a new audience through a series of broadcasts on the BBC.

<text>The Hillsborough River is a river located in the state of Florida in the United States. It arises in the Green Swamp near the juncture of Hillsborough, Pasco and Polk counties, and flows through Pasco and Hillsborough Counties to an outlet in the city of Tampa on Hillsborough Bay. It includes 4 nature trails extending for over , making it popular among hikers. The name &quot;Hillsborough River&quot; first appeared on a British map in 1769. At the time, the Earl of Hillsborough was the British Secretary of State for the Colonies, and thus controlled the pensions of the surveyors working in the American colonies, which included East Florida.

==History==
Geological data estimates that the Hillsborough River has been flowing for about 27,000 years. It is estimated humans first made their way to this area 12,000 - 15,000 years ago.

In the late 18th century the watershed of the Hillsborough River was a land covered by a rich, old-growth forest. Bald cypress, longleaf pine, and sand live oak were hundreds of years old (and in the case of cypress, thousands of years old). In the mid to late 19th century to about 1913 the watershed of this old growth forest began to be logged. As a result of this lumbering activity, most of the trees within the Hillsborough River basin are now less than 100 years in age. The harvesting of the old growth trees altered the ecosystems they dominated. Trees such as water ash and water locust were able to quickly grow in the sun-lit spaces created when bigger trees were removed. The riverine swamp forest as it exists today has a much different ecology than the ecosystem that had existed along the Hillsborough for the previous ten to 15,000 years.

When Europeans first reached Florida, the area around Tampa Bay and all of the watershed of the Hillsborough River was occupied by people of the Safety Harbor culture. Two chiefdoms of the Safety Harbor culture, Mocoso and Pohoy, were adjacent to where the Hillsborough River entered Tampa Bay. Hernando de Soto landed on the south side of Tampa Bay in 1539 and passed through Mocoso on his way north. By the early 18th century the people of the Safety Harbor culture, through disease and slavery, are nearly exterminated.

===Timeline===

(1757) A survey of the Hillsborough River is done by Don Francisco Maria Celi, pilot of the
Spanish Royal Fleet. He ventures up to the Temple Terrace area in search of longleaf pine to use as masts for his ships. He names the pine forest of the area &quot;El Pinal de la Cruz de Santa Teresa&quot; or &quot;The Pines of the Cross of Saint Teresa&quot;. There is a plaque commemorating his exploration at Riverhills Park in Temple Terrace.

(1772) A map drawn and sent to the Earl of Hillsborough, English Governor of West Florida, shows the river named as the Hillsborough. During the mid and late 18th century, Native Americans from the north, mostly Creek, begin to migrate to Florida. These immigrants become known as Seminoles.

(1821) Florida becomes a United States territory.

(1824) Construction of Fort Brooke begins at the mouth of the Hillsborough River.


(1828) The Fort King Military Road (now State Road 41) is built to connect Fort King in Ocala with Fort Brooke in what was then the settlement of Tampa. A bridge is built to cross the Hillsborough.

(1830) Congress passes the Indian Removal Act. The American government begins efforts to remove the Seminole from Tampa Bay and relocate them to a reservation west of the Mississippi. Tensions between Seminole and Americans continue.

(1835) Seminoles burn the bridge at the Fort King Road&#x27;s river crossing. Conflict continues.

(1836) Fort Foster is established at the Hillsborough River crossing to protect this
strategically advantageous position.

(1842) The Armed Occupation Act promises one hundred of land to any man who can bear arms, build a house and cultivate for five years.

(1843) The Jean Street Shipyard is founded on the Hillsborough River in what will be the neighborhood of Seminole Heights.

(1846) The first ferry crossing on the Hillsborough River is established. This improves
transportation and widens the growth of Tampa to both sides of the river.

(1861) During the American Civil War, Tampa Bay is blockaded by federal troops to prevent goods from leaving Tampa or from coming into Tampa.

(1863) Federal troops march upriver to a location near the present day site of Lowry Park Zoo. There they discover a blockade-running steamer and sloop loaded with cotton. The ships are burned. The skirmish that follows is the only Civil War action on the Hillsborough River.

(1891) The Tampa Bay Hotel, now the Henry B. Plant Museum, opens with a grand ball.

(1897) At a cost of $150,000 an electrical dam is built on the river by Consumers Electric Light and Street Railway Company. The dam was located halfway between present-day 40th Street and 56th Street on the Hillsborough River (today&#x27;s Temple Crest neighborhood.)

(1898) On December 13, 1898 the dam is dynamited by cattle barons angry at the loss of grazing land. They tried three times. The first on January 8, 1897, shortly after construction was completed. When the water is low, remnants of the dynamited dam can be seen.

(1898–99) TECO buys the Consumers Electric Light and Street Railway Company and builds a new electric generating dam downstream of the current site north of Sulphur Springs.

(1899) Tampa&#x27;s first water plant is built by the private Tampa Waterworks Company. It pumped well water to supply the City of Tampa until March 6, 1923, when the people voted to purchase the Waterworks plant.

(1900) The Sulphur Springs (Sulphur Springs, Tampa, Florida) property is developed and open to the public.

(1910) Hillsborough Bay is channelized to the mouth of the Hillsborough River with the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899. Up to 1913 the Hillsborough River watershed is heavily logged for its valuable cypress, longleaf pine and oak.

(1911–1914) Bertha Potter Palmer (Bertha Palmer) (of Chicago and Sarasota) completes purchases of bordering the Hillsborough River in present-day Temple Terrace, Temple Crest, Terrace Park, Busch Gardens and the University of South Florida area. She calls her property &quot;Riverhills Ranch&quot;, an exclusive hunting preserve where she builds a lodge and guest houses among other structures. She dies in 1918.

(1922) The Temple Terrace Golf and County Club, located on the river in Temple Terrace opens with a Washington Ball.

(1923) The city of Tampa builds a water treatment plant to utilize the water supply from the water above the dam.

(1935) Hillsborough River State Park is opened.

(1933) In a torrential 24-hour rain, floods wash away the Tampa Electric dam. TECO does not rebuild the dam and turns to other locations for electrical generating plants.

(1944) The city of Tampa completes construction on the current dam, to be used for the purpose of containing drinking water for the city, at the site of the old TECO dam. The old Tampa Waterworks Company is abandoned.

(1961) The Southwest Florida Water Management District (SWFWMD) is created.

(1960s-70s) The long Tampa Bypass Canal is constructed by the Southwest Florida Water Management District (SWFWMD). It includes a constructed canal and several concrete flood-control structures. During construction of the Tampa Bypass Canal the aquifer is accidentally breached.

(1979) The Hillsborough River is closed to swimming at Hillsborough River State Park and a swimming pool is built for public use.

(1982) Lettuce Lake Park opens on the river just north of Temple Terrace

(1986) The Hillsborough River Interlocal Planning Board &amp; Technical Advisory Council is established.

(1986) Sulphur Springs pool (Sulphur Springs, Tampa, Florida) is closed.

(1988) The annual Hillsborough River Cleanup begins.

(1991) Canoe Escape is opened and the owners donate canoes and time to bring the Hillsborough River to the public&#x27;s attention.

(1992) The Hillsborough River Greenways Taskforce is established.

(1995) The Hillsborough River is designated as Outstanding Florida Waters.

(1995) The Hillsborough River is designated as a Florida Recreational Canoe Trail.

(1995) The Hillsborough River is named a Florida Sesquicentennial Greenway.

(1999) &quot;Friends of the River&quot; is created by local residents for the purpose of challenging the SWFWMD minimum flow of of Sulphur Springs water alone for the river&#x27;s only freshwater flow.

(2000) On the day after a massive Earth Day celebration at Lowry Park, highlighted by a &quot;Flow-tilla&quot; of dozens of boats from the Rowlett Park dam to Lowry Park, Friends of the River settles its legal challenge with agreement with SWFWMD, City of Tampa and Robert Thomas of Zephyrhills Water to study the river for 5 years to scientifically determine exactly how much freshwater is needed to restore and maintain the river&#x27;s estuarine function. Friends of the River had maintained that the establishment of the minimum flow of of Sulphur Springs water was a politically expedient solution with no basis in scientific data. Findings of the 5-year study to be used by SWFWMD as sole basis for modification of minimum flow.

(2002) Tampa Bay Water places a pipeline to the Morris Bridge Sink (http://www.reedconstructiondata.com/projects/1001008567/)

(2006) &quot;The Hillsborough River Task Force&quot;, Temple Terrace, is created.

(2007) Alan Wright, &quot;Mr River&quot;, dies of cancer, December 21.

(2007) &quot;The Lower Hillsborough River Minimum Flow Recovery Strategy&quot; is adopted, based upon SWFWMD&#x27;s 5-year study that documented a need for freshwater over twice that provided by its original rule as challenged by Friends of the River. A minimum flow of is adopted, combining the original of Sulphur Springs water with added to the river from water stored in Tampa Bypass Canal. Minimum flow adjusted upwards to in spring months (April, May, June) when fish spawning activity occurs in restored estuary. Daily minimum flow begins December 31, 2007.

==The river today==
The Hillsborough River is home to many species, and several large bird rookeries exist. When local students reach sixth grade in Hillsborough County, they take a visit to the river for one to three days to learn about the ecosystem, watershed, and native Florida animals at a place called &#x27;Nature&#x27;s Classroom&#x27;. The Hillsborough River dam (originally built in 1895 and since rebuilt) at Rowlett Park creates a lake covering and containing of water, providing for the supply of water for the City of Tampa. The Hillsborough River was immortalized in 1973 by author Gloria Jahoda in her book &quot;River of the Golden Ibis&quot;.

With the construction of the dam in 1945, the portion of the River above the dam to approximately Fletcher Avenue is where the City of Tampa is permitted to withdraw water to supply to its citizens and those in Hillsborough County. In addition, Tampa Bay Water is permitted to withdraw water from the River during &quot;high flow&quot; times and under specific conditions. The Southwest Florida Water Management District, the agency required by Florida law to protect and manage the waters in the state, authorizes the permits.

With the establishment of the minimum flow of the upper and middle river by the Southwest Florida Water Management District in 2007 and its supporting Recovery Strategy, the City of Tampa and the District in partnership are implementing measures and projects to achieve the required flow in the lower river, while preserving the pristine nature of the middle and upper rivers.

The river above the dam to roughly the 56th Street bridge passes through the neighborhood of Temple Crest. The river above the 56th Street bridge passes through the City of Temple Terrace and it is one of the many scenic portions of the river. The City has a river cleanup of its river portion twice a year.

==Hillsborough River State Park==
Hillsborough River State Park includes along the Hillsborough River in northeastern Hillsborough County. It supports many Floridian environments such as swamps and oak hammocks and many endangered species. The park&#x27;s purpose is to preserve the &quot;real Florida&quot;. Visitors to the park can participate in picnicking, camping, canoeing, hiking, fishing and swimming in a constructed pool. There is also a designated place to observe the river&#x27;s class II rapids. It is one of the only rivers in Florida with rapids. The park opened in 1935 making it one of Florida&#x27;s oldest state parks.

==The middle river==
The middle river is the portion of the river north of the dam at 30th Street and is the primary source of water for the City of Tampa. The middle river is located in the middle portion of the river extending from its dam with the water contained back to Fletcher Avenue. The Hillsborough River has its headwaters begins in the Green Swamp and ultimately flows into Tampa Bay.

Water was supplied in Tampa&#x27;s early days by private wells, cisterns and tanks. Tampa&#x27;s first water plant went into operation on April 20, 1899, operated by the private Tampa Waterworks Company. It pumped well water to supply the City of Tampa until March 6, 1923, when the people voted to purchase the Waterworks plant for the city. The middle river has been Tampa&#x27;s official source of water since 1944.

But the middle river is far more than just the source for some of Tampa&#x27;s drinking water, it is a wonderfully diverse river ecosystem within the larger urban area surrounding it. Orange Lake, in the Temple Crest neighborhood, is an Audubon Society bird nesting and sanctuary, is also a living wetlands.

Upstream along the banks of Temple Terrace&#x27;s Riverhills Park is a scene from old Florida, with cypress trees dotting the watery landscape.

==Recreation==
A canoe trail is designated by the State of Florida, starting at Hillsborough River State Park and ending at Rowlett Park in Tampa. Morris Bridge Park, Trout Creek Wilderness Park, Hillsborough River State Park Lettuce Lake Park, Riverfront Park, Riverhills Park, Angel of Hope Park, Rogers Park, Sulphur Springs Water Tower, and Rivercrest Park are all located along the Hillsborough River.

<text>Ground-Based Midcourse Defense (GMD), previously National Missile Defense (NMD), is an anti-ballistic missile system implemented by the United States of America for defense against ballistic missiles, during the midcourse phase of ballistic trajectory flight. It is a major component of the American missile defense strategy to counter ballistic missiles, including intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) carrying nuclear, chemical, biological or conventional warheads.

As of 2018, the system is composed of two interceptor staging bases in the states of Alaska and California, with 40 staged in the former, 4 staged in the latter, for a total of 44 interceptors, as well as the component early warning and targeting sensors based on land, sea, and in orbit. As of 2019, a Missile Defense Review has requested 20 additional interceptors to be based in Fort Greely, Alaska, though their delivery has not materialized.

GMD is administered by the U.S. Missile Defense Agency (MDA), while operational control is provided by the U.S. Army, with support functions provided by the U.S. Air Force and U.S. Space Force. 

== Background ==

GMD after its renaming in 2002 remains a limited defense system, intended to protect the continental United States from limited launches of ballistic missiles. Examples given in the past have included countries such as North Korea.

GMD has undergone some controversy over its operational lifetime, such as with a study in 2000 by the Union of Concerned Scientists and the Security Studies Program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology concluding that &quot;[a]ny country capable of deploying a long-range missile would also be able to deploy countermeasures that would defeat the planned NMD system.&quot; Countermeasures studied in detail were bomblets containing biological or chemical agents, aluminized balloons to serve as decoys and to disguise warheads, and cooling warheads to reduce the kill vehicle&#x27;s ability to detect them. Currently, the Union of Concerned Scientists maintains that GMD is &quot;unproven, unaccountable, and unhelpful for reducing the nuclear threat.&quot;

More recently, questions have been asked about the Pentagon characterizing the January 28 test in 2016 as a success, when LA Times reported that the EKV suffered a fault in its reaction control system thrusters, which resulted in &quot;a distance 20 times greater than what was expected&quot; according to an anonymous Pentagon scientist.

Under the Missile Defense Agency, GMD has conducted multiple test exercises, with mixed results. Early testing revealed deficiencies in the Ground Based Interceptor missile, as well as the Exoatmospheric Kill Vehicle. However, with time, success rates increased, marred by the occasional technical failure such as in 2010&#x27;s FTG-06 (Flight Test Ground-Based Interceptor) where the Sea-based X Band Radar failed to perform as expected, and the subsequent FTG-06a where despite all elements performing correctly, intercept failed to occur.

==Description==
GMD is tied into existing United States missile warning infrastructure, as well as purpose built radar sites. It also encompasses 44 ground-based missile interceptors housed at two military bases. 

Boeing Defense, Space &amp; Security is the prime contractor of the program, tasked to oversee and integrate systems from other major defense sub-contractors, such as Computer Sciences Corporation and Raytheon.

The key sub-systems of the GMD system are:
* Exoatmospheric Kill Vehicle (EKV) – Raytheon
* Ground-Based Interceptor (GBI) – boost vehicle built by Orbital Sciences; for every interceptor missile there is a missile silo and a silo interface vault (SIV), which is an underground electronics room adjacent to the silo.
* Battle management command, control and communications (BMC3) – Northrop Grumman
* Ground-based radars (GBR) – Raytheon
* AN/FPS-132 Upgraded Early Warning Radar (UEWR) – Raytheon
* Forward-based X band radars (FBXB), such as the sea-based X-band platform and the AN/TPY-2 — Raytheon

Interceptor sites are at Fort Greely, Alaska and Vandenberg Space Force Base, California. A third site was planned for a proposed US missile defense complex in Poland, but was canceled in September 2009.

In late 2013, there were plans for a proposed Eastern United States site to house a battery of these missiles. Four sites were shortlisted in January 2014 for an East Coast site - SERE Remote Training Site in Maine (Rangeley), Fort Drum in New York, Camp James A. Garfield in Ohio, and Fort Custer Training Center in Michigan. Camp Ethan Allen Training Site in Vermont was dropped from consideration in late 2013.

In January 2014 the Pentagon announced they were starting a two-year environmental impact study under the 2013 defense authorization bill, which required two missile-defense sites to be identified on the East Coast. The CBO has estimated that a site would cost US$3.5bn.

In June 2019, Fort Drum in New York was chosen as the location for the potential East Coast missile defense site.

In December 2008, the U.S. Missile Defense Agency awarded Boeing a $397.9 million contract to continue development of the program.

In March 2013, the Obama administration announced plans to add 14 interceptors to the current 26 at Fort Greely in response to North Korean threats. The deployment of a second TPY-2 radar to Japan was announced at the same time. While President Obama said that the additional deployment was a hedge against unexpected capabilities, Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Hong Lei complained that the additional defenses would affect the global strategic balance and strategic trust.

On 30 April 2014, the Government Accountability Office issued a report stating that the system may not be operational any time soon because &quot;its development was flawed&quot;. It said the GBI missile was at that point &quot;capable of intercepting a simple threat in a limited way&quot;. On 12 August 2015, Lt. General David L. Mann (commanding general USASMDC/ARSTRAT) characterized GMD as the nation&#x27;s only ground-based defense against limited ICBM attacks.

Issues with the EKV prompted the MDA to work with Raytheon, Boeing, and Lockheed Martin on a new Redesigned Kill Vehicle (RKV), scheduled to debut in 2025. In 2019, the government issued a stop work order for the RKV after recent test results indicated that the current RKV plan is not viable. The government &quot;initiated an analysis of alternative courses of action&quot;; on 21 August the MDA cancelled the $5.8 billion contract for the RKV. This initiates new work on bids for the successor to the Exo-Atmospheric Kill Vehicle (EKV) to 2025. The current GMD programs continue per plan, with up to 64 GBIs (meaning an additional 20) in the missile fields for 2019.

==Program costs==
Expenditures on the Ground-Based Midcourse Defense program were estimated to be US$30.7 billion by 2007. In 2013, it was estimated that the program would cost $40.926 billion from inception through fiscal year 2017; in 2013–17 spending was to total $4.46 billion, an average of $892 million per year.

==Flight tests==
:BV: Booster Verification Test
:CMCM: Critical Measurements and Countermeasures
:CTV: Control Test Vehicle
:FTG: Flight Test Ground-Based Interceptor
:FTX: Flight Test Other
:IFT: Integrated Flight Test

===Intercept tests===
After the FTG-12 test on 11 December 2023, 12 of the 21 (57%) hit-to-kill intercept tests have succeeded. No flight intercept tests from 2010 to 2013 were successful. In response the Pentagon asked for a budget increase and another test for the fielded program. The successful intercept FTG-15 was accomplished by an operational team of the 100th Missile Defense Brigade using their standard operating procedures (round-the-clock 24/7). Although they knew in advance that there would be a test launch, they did not know exactly when it would occur or its exact nature.

===Non-intercept tests===
===Canceled tests===
Throughout the program&#x27;s history, multiple test flights have been canceled, including BV-4, IFT-11, −12, −13, −13A, −15, FTC-03, and, most recently, FTG-04.

== Estimated effectiveness ==
The system has a &quot;single shot probability of kill&quot; of its interceptors calculated at 56%, with the claimed total probability of intercepting a single target, if four interceptors are launched, at 97%. Each interceptor costs approximately $75 million.

The claim of &quot;97% kill probability&quot; has been dismissed by some experts as a flawed application of basic statistical methods. Said James M. Acton, co-director of the Nuclear Policy Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, &quot;It assumes that the failure modes of the interceptors are independent of one another. But, in practice, if one interceptor fails because of a design flaw, say, it&#x27;s much more likely that others will do so too for the same reason.&quot;

<text>Uriah Smith Stephens (August 3, 1821 – February 13, 1882) was an American labor leader. He was most notable for his leadership of nine Philadelphia garment workers in founding the Knights of Labor in 1869, a successful early American labor union. 

Born in New Jersey, and initially educated for the ministry, Stephens was apprenticed as a tailor when he was a teenager so that he could help support his family. He settled in Philadelphia, where he continued to work at his trade. After extensive travel throughout the western United States, Mexico, and Europe in the late 1840s and early 1850s, he returned to Philadelphia, where he worked as a tailor and became active in fraternal organizations and the labor movement. After an initial effort, the Garment Cutters&#x27; Union, failed to take root, in 1869 Stephens founded the Knights of Labor. He originally conceived of the organization as a fraternal one that included secret rituals and focused on individual personal and professional development. As the organization expanded, debates over the need for secrecy and rituals eventually ended when Stephens resigned, and the organization voted to eliminate these requirements, which enabled it to then begin recruiting as members workers and tradesmen who were Catholic.

Stephens remained active in the labor movement after leaving the Knights of Labor, and died in Philadelphia in 1882. The Knights of Labor continued to expand until backlash against unions following the Haymarket affair and the Panic of 1893 caused workers to depart the K of L, and its membership declined until the organization became defunct in 1949. Stephens&#x27; primary legacy was as the founder and organizer of one of the first successful nationwide labor unions.

==Early life==
Stephens was born in Cape May, New Jersey on August 3, 1821. His parents were devout Baptists, and Stephens was educated for the ministry in the hopes that he would become a member of the clergy. The Stephens family sustained financial reverses during the Panic of 1837; Stephens then ended his formal education with the intent of learning a trade. He was trained as a tailor, and worked to help support his family.

==Start of career==
In 1846, Stephens moved to Philadelphia, where he continued to work as a tailor. From 1853 to 1858, he traveled to California, Mexico, Central America, and several European countries. He returned to Philadelphia, and became active in several reform movements, including the abolition of slavery and utopian socialism.

Throughout his life, Stephens read widely on a variety of topics, including finance and economics. He taught himself several foreign languages including French, German, and Spanish, and practiced them to improve his proficiency, which enabled him to read works by European authors. Stephens also joined several fraternal organizations, including the Masons, Knights of Pythias, and Independent Order of Odd Fellows. He later drew on the symbols and rituals of these organizations when forming the Knights of Labor.

==Labor activist==
===Garment Workers&#x27; Union===
In 1862, Stephens helped to organize the Garment Cutters&#x27; Union; this organization existed for seven years, but did not have success at obtaining improved pay, benefits and working conditions. As a result, the members voted to disband.

===Knights of Labor===
After the demise of the Garment Cutters&#x27; Union, a few former members met with Stephens at his home on November 25, 1869. During this gathering, Stephens revealed plans for a new organization, the &quot;Noble and Holy Order of Knights of Labor.&quot; As he conceived it, Stephens intended for the Knights of Labor to be a &quot;brotherhood of toil&quot; open to every laborer, mechanic, and artisan who desired professional improvement, regardless of country, creed, or color. At its founding, the K of L was open to all working people, and charged no dues.

The Knights of Labor was intended as a voluntary association of producers, who would work cooperatively and fraternally, as opposed to the self-centered materialism of the Gilded Age. In Stephens’ vision, the K of L included elements of a fraternal organization or secular church, including rituals and secrecy. Secrecy was initially regarded as essential, given the number of incidents of violence against workers, including coal worker strikes in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and the Great Railroad Strike of 1877.

At the new order’s second meeting on December 28, 1869, the group adopted Stephens&#x27; ritual work, &quot;Adelphon Kruptos&quot; (Secret Brotherhood). In it, Stephens expressed his conviction that the &quot;Everlasting Truth sealed by the Grand Architect of the Universe&quot; is that &quot;everything of value, or merit, is the result of creative Industry.&quot; Rituals included lectures on the nobility of labor and the evils of wage slavery, monopoly, and over-accumulation of wealth. Stephens created an equilateral triangle within a circle as the new order’s emblem, embellishing it with symbolism from the various lodges to which he belonged.

The Knights of Labor elected Stephens as the first local Master Workman, the first District Master Workman, and the first Grand Master Workman, the highest position in the organization. By 1879, there were 23 district assemblies and 1,300 local assemblies. As the Knights of Labor grew into the most powerful labor organization of its day, Stephens increasingly found himself in disagreement with the rank and file members. The organization&#x27;s secrecy and rituals became a source of controversy, and many more aggressive members took exception to Stephens’ opposition to strikes and other job actions in favor of promoting the personal and professional development and growth of the organization&#x27;s members.

In 1878, Stephens ran unsuccessfully for the United States House of Representatives as the candidate of the Greenback–Labor; he had earlier been the catalyst for adding &quot;Labor&quot; to the Greenback Party&#x27;s name in an attempt to broaden the party&#x27;s appeal.

===Resignation===
Stephens resigned in 1879 over disagreement with a proposed K of L policy shift when the organization&#x27;s General Assembly voted to make its name public, omit scriptural quotations from the ritual, and edit the initiation ceremonies, all of which were designed to attract new members by making the Knights of Labor less offensive to the Catholic Church. The debate over ending secrecy continued until January 1, 1882, when the Knights of Labor became a public organization. After his resignation, Stephens was replaced by Terence V. Powderly.

Under Powderly&#x27;s leadership, the Knights of Labor continued to grow; it had almost 700,000 members by 1886, making it the first successful nationwide labor union. The organization also moved further from Stephens&#x27; initial vision, including support for the Chinese Exclusion Act. The aftermath of the Haymarket affair and the Panic of 1893 caused workers to start leaving the Knights of Labor, and its membership dwindled until its last local affiliate dropped the name in 1949.

==Death and burial==
Stephens died in Philadelphia on February 13, 1882. He was buried at Mount Peace Cemetery in Philadelphia.

At the time of his death, Stephens was still active in the labor movement, but estranged from the Knights of Labor. He was still revered by many members, and as a result, in 1886 the K of L General Assembly voted to grant $10,000 to provide a home for Stevens&#x27; widow and children.

==Family==
In 1846, Stephens married Mary Ann Jackson in Philadelphia. They were the parents of four children -- Mary E., George W., Ellie, and Carrie P.

==Legacy==
Stephens&#x27; unmarked grave features prominently in the 2007 film &quot;Profit Motive and the Whispering Wind&quot;, a narration-less documentary in which filmmaker John Gianvito silently displays grave sites and historical locations of American freethinkers and leaders of American Radical political movements.

<text>Archibald Scott Cleghorn (November 15, 1835 – November 1, 1910) was a Scottish businessman who married into the royal family of the Hawaiian Kingdom.

== Biography ==
He was born on November 15, 1835, in Edinburgh, Scotland, to Thomas Cleghorn and wife, Janet Nisbet, the second of two sons. In 1841 Thomas was Superintendent of the Government Domain (Auckland Domain) in Auckland, New Zealand. Janet Cleghorn died in Auckland in 1845.
In 1851, at the age of 16, Archie Cleghorn travelled with his father to Honolulu, where his father established a dry goods store. His father died within the year, but Archibald remained in Hawaii and continued running the store. His business prospered and he expanded to other islands.

Cleghorn became a citizen of the Hawaiian Kingdom in 1870.
He married Princess Miriam K. Likelike who was 19 years old, sister of David Kalākaua, on September 22, 1870, at Washington Place. In 1874 Kalākaua became King, and Cleghorn&#x27;s daughter Princess Victoria Kaiʻulani was the heir to the throne of the House of Kalākaua.

In 1877, Cleghorn and Princess Likelike arranged to donate the land surrounding the monument to Captain James Cook on Kealakekua Bay marking the site of his death, in trust to the government of the United Kingdom.

Cleghorn served in the House of Nobles from 1873 to 1888, and the Privy Council from 1873 to 1891. He acted as the Royal Governor of Oʻahu in July 1887, and was appointed to succeed Prince Consort John Owen Dominis upon his death in November 1891, until February 28, 1893. He was the president of the Kapiʻolani Park Association since 1888, and first parks commissioner for the City &amp; County of Honolulu in 1900. He served as a trustee of The Queen&#x27;s Medical Center from 1905 to 1909.

=== The Hawaiian Overthrow===
Leading up to the 1893 overthrow, Cleghorn grew increasingly frustrated with Liliʻuokalani who he felt failed to see the seriousness of the political situation. He blamed Liliʻuokalani for not heeding his advice during the days leading up to the coup. In his diary, Cleghorn noted a British sympathizer had asked Liliʻuokalani to abdicate in favor of Kaʻiulani and he later wrote to his daughter that if the queen had abdicated on the night of 16th or the morning of the 17th, the monarchy would have been saved. 

On January 16, the day before the overthrow, he met privately with Thurston and requested his group respect Kaʻiulani&#x27;s claim to throne and suggested installing her as queen with a board of regents as an alternative to overthrowing the monarchy. Thurston replied that the &quot;matters have proceeded too far for your plan to be an adequate answer to this situation. We are going to abrogate the Monarchy entirely, and nothing can be done to stop us, so far as I can see!&quot; Thurston noted that after their conversation Cleghorn looked as though he were about to cry and bowed his head in silence as he left. Historian Ralph Simpson Kuykendall noted that &quot;Governor Cleghorn&#x27;s meager diary for the early part of 1893 suggests the picture of an anguished father frantically trying to save his beloved daughter from the unhappy fate which had befallen her through no fault of her own.&quot;

Cleghorn took an oath of allegiance under protest to the Provisional Government of Hawaii led by Sanford B. Dole in order to retain his position as Collector General of Customs. He was ridiculed in the Hawaiian press for this move by Royalist Clarence W. Ashford. Cleghorn also helped the new government in enforcing the oath of allegiance with existing governmental employees at the custom house and signed his letter to his superior with &quot;Your obedient servant&quot;. He later resigned on April 15 and was replaced by annexationist James Bicknell Castle.

== ʻĀinahau and Stones of Kapaemahu ==
In 1878 Cleghorn sold his residence in Honolulu and moved his family to ʻĀinahau, an estate in Waikiki built on land gifted by Princess Ruth Keʻelikōlani to his daughter Kaʻiulani. There he built a two-story home and planted gardens with flowers and trees from all over the world, including the progenitor of all banyan trees in Hawaiʻi. Cleghorn also purchased an adjacent beachfront lot on which was located a stone to which Likelike and Kaʻiulani offered lei and prayers before bathing in the sea. This was one of the Kapaemahu, large stones devoted to the four legendary māhū who brought the healing arts from Tahiti to Hawaiʻi. Cleghorn&#x27;s will stated that “the historical stones now upon the premises last above mentioned shall not be defaced or removed from said premises.&quot;

==Death==

Cleghorn died of a heart attack on November 1, 1910, at the ʻĀinahau royal estate. He was buried in the Kalākaua Crypt of the Royal Mausoleum of Hawaii.

His downtown Honolulu estate became the home of The Pacific Club in 1926.

Cleghorn willed the estate of ʻĀinahau to the Territory of Hawaii for a park to honor his daughter Ka‘iulani. However, the territorial legislature, reluctant to manage the property, used a specification that the park would have to close each night at 6:00PM as a technicality to refuse the gift. The property was subsequently subdivided and sold with the Victorian mansion at ʻĀinahau becoming a hotel and then a rental property before it burned down on August 2, 1921.

== Children ==
Besides his daughter Kaʻiulani, Cleghorn had a number of children out of wedlock.

With a Hawaiian woman, Elizabeth “Lapeka” Kahalaunani Pauahi Grimes, Cleghorn had three daughters: Cleghorn and Lapeka later separated.

*Rose Hilda Kaipuala Cleghorn (July 15, 1859 – February 27, 1911), on July 20, 1876 married James William Robertson (1852–1919), chamberlain to Kalākaua and Liliuokalani and founder of the &quot;Evening Bulletin&quot; newspaper that later merged with the &quot;Daily Star&quot; to become the &quot;Honolulu Star-Bulletin&quot;
*Helen Caroline Maniʻiailehua (or Maunuilehua or Manuʻailehua) Cleghorn (December 17, 1863 – August 9, 1927), on August 16, 1888 married James Harbottle Boyd (1858–1915)
*Annie Pauahi Cleghorn (July 28, 1868 – March 6, 1897), on December 20, 1890 married James Hay Wodehouse, Jr (1861–1913), son to the British ambassador to Hawaii James Hay Wodehouse, Sr.

With another Hawaiian woman Annie Ana Makanui (died 1904):
*Thomas Alexander Kaulaʻahi Cleghorn (March 11, 1899 – October 22, 1984), who married first Claire Rogers and later Nellie Yarnell Maxwell. He and his second wife adopted Melinda Lee Kaiulani as their adoptive granddaughter.

<doc id="789125" wikidata="Q4362439" url="?curid=789125" title="Stuart Piggott">
<text>Stuart Ernest Piggott, (28 May 1910 – 23 September 1996) was a British archaeologist, best known for his work on prehistoric Wessex.

==Early life==
Piggott was born in Petersfield, Hampshire, the son of G. H. O. Piggott, and was educated there at Churcher&#x27;s College.

==Career==
On leaving school in 1927 Piggott took up a post as assistant at Reading Museum, where he developed an expertise in Neolithic pottery.

In 1928 he joined the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales and spent the next five years producing a revolutionary study of the site of Butser Hill, near Petersfield. He also worked with Eliot Cecil Curwen on their excavations at The Trundle causewayed enclosure in Sussex.

In the 1930s he began working for Alexander Keiller, an amateur archaeologist who funded his work from the profits of his Dundee Marmalade business. The two dug numerous sites in Wessex including Avebury and Kennet Avenue. In 1933, he joined his friend Grahame Clark in writing the highly significant paper, &quot;The age of the British flint mines&quot; (&quot;Antiquity&quot;, 1933): the resultant controversy led to the foundation of the Prehistoric Society. Still without any formal archaeological qualification, Piggott enrolled at Mortimer Wheeler&#x27;s Institute of Archaeology, London, taking his diploma in 1936. It was also here that he met his wife, Peggy (Margaret Guido). In 1937 he published another seminal paper, &quot;The early Bronze Age in Wessex&quot;, and with his wife went on in June 1939 to join the burial chamber excavations at Sutton Hoo at the invitation of Charles Phillips.

During the Second World War Piggott worked as an air photo interpreter. He was posted to India, where he spent time studying the archaeology of the sub-continent, eventually leading him to write the books &quot;Some Ancient Cities of India&quot; (1946) and &quot;Prehistoric India&quot; (1950). These experiences provided him with a valuable external view of European prehistory, which was to prove useful on his return to Britain.

After the war he went to Oxford to study the work of William Stukeley, but in 1946 was offered the Abercromby Chair of Archaeology at Edinburgh University (now part of the School of History, Classics and Archaeology), in succession to Gordon Childe. Piggott succeeded in making Edinburgh an archaeology department of international standing. He continued to publish widely. His book &quot;Neolithic Cultures of the British Isles&quot; (1954) was highly influential, until radiocarbon dating tests exposed flaws in its chronology. Piggott considered that radiocarbon dating was &quot;archaeologically unacceptable&quot;, because every other shred of evidence pointed towards his dates being correct. &quot;Ancient Europe&quot; (1965) remained a popular survey of Old World prehistory for more than twenty years, demonstrating his view of the solidarity and continuity of the past in Europe. In 1956 his childless marriage ended.

In 1958 Piggott published a survey of Scottish prehistory, &quot;Scotland before History&quot;, and in 1959 a popular introductory volume, &quot;Approach to Archaeology&quot;. He was president of the Prehistoric Society from 1960 to 1963, president of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland from 1963 to 1967, president of the Council for British Archaeology from 1967 to 1970, and a trustee of the British Museum between 1968 and 1974). In 1963, he produced a thorough analysis of the Beaker culture in Britain, published as part of a Festschrift dedicated to Cyril Fox. Piggott&#x27;s interest in the early history of the practice of archaeology led to him writing &quot;The Druids&quot; in 1968; other books included &quot;Prehistoric Societies&quot; (with Grahame Clark), &quot;The Earliest Wheeled Transport&quot; (1983), followed by its sequel, &quot;Wagon, Chariot and Carriage&quot; (1992). His final book was &quot;Ancient Britain and the Antiquarian Imagination&quot; (1989).

He died of a heart attack at his home near Wantage in Oxfordshire on 23 September 1996. His remains were cremated on 30 September at Oxford crematorium.

==Family==

On 12 November 1936, he married Celia Margaret Preston, an archaeologist and finds specialist; they had met while students at the Institute of Archaeology in London. By 1954, their relationship was over, and they divorced in 1956. She became better known under her second married name, Margaret Guido.

==Excavations==
Sites he excavated (often with Richard Atkinson) included Cairnpapple Hill in West Lothian; Wayland&#x27;s Smithy in Oxfordshire; and West Kennet Long Barrow and Stonehenge in Wiltshire.

==Honours==
In 1957 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were Robert Schlapp, David Whitteridge, Sidney Newman, and James Ritchie.

He received the CBE in 1972, and was awarded numerous academic awards from scholarly institutions in Britain and abroad. He retired from the Abercromby Chair in 1977 and was awarded the gold medal of the Society of Antiquaries of London in 1983 and the Grahame Clark Medal of the British Academy in 1992.

==Reception and legacy==
Vincent Megaw commented that &quot;as [Piggott] himself has said, although he has done his fair share of field work and excavation, his prime concern has been to produce works of synthesis and interpretation&quot;. Megaw added that Piggott viewed &quot;archaeology as an oyster to be savoured whole and not simply to be subjected to the minutiae of macrofaunal and calorific analyses.&quot; The historian Ronald Hutton stated that it was &quot;one aspect of his greatness that he fostered the study of early modern antiquaries as an integral part of the self-awareness of his profession.&quot;

In 1968 a number of Piggott&#x27;s former pupils and colleagues assembled a collection of essays dedicated to him, titled &quot;Studies in Ancient Europe&quot;. In 1976 Megaw published a second &quot;Festschrift&quot;, which brought in consideration of Piggott&#x27;s work on the archaeology of Asia and the Americas.

In the 2021 film &quot;The Dig&quot;, which told the story of the Sutton Hoo excavations, Piggott was portrayed by Ben Chaplin, although the film takes some creative licence with its presentation of his marriage to his wife Peggy.

==Publications==

Marjorie Robertson compiled a list of Piggott&#x27;s books up to 1975 for his &quot;festschrift&quot;.

<text>In cryptography, an adversary (rarely opponent, enemy) is a malicious entity whose aim is to prevent the users of the cryptosystem from achieving their goal (primarily privacy, integrity, and availability of data). An adversary&#x27;s efforts might take the form of attempting to discover secret data, corrupting some of the data in the system, spoofing the identity of a message sender or receiver, or forcing system downtime.

Actual adversaries, as opposed to idealized ones, are referred to as &quot;attackers&quot;. The former term predominates in the cryptographic and the latter in the computer security literature. Eavesdropper Eve, malicious attacker Mallory, opponent Oscar, and intruder Trudy are all adversarial characters widely used in both types of texts.

This notion of an adversary helps both intuitive and formal reasoning about cryptosystems by casting security analysis of cryptosystems as a &#x27;game&#x27; between the users and a &quot;centrally co-ordinated&quot; enemy. The notion of security of a cryptosystem is meaningful only with respect to particular attacks (usually presumed to be carried out by particular sorts of adversaries).

There are several types of adversaries depending on what capabilities or intentions they are presumed to have. Adversaries may be
*computationally bounded or unbounded (i.e. in terms of time and storage resources),
*eavesdropping or Byzantine (i.e. passively listening on or actively corrupting data in the channel),
*static or adaptive (i.e. having fixed or changing behavior),
*mobile or non-mobile (e.g. in the context of network security)
and so on. In actual security practice, the attacks assigned to such adversaries are often seen, so such notional analysis is not merely theoretical.

How successful an adversary is at breaking a system is measured by its &quot;advantage&quot;. An adversary&#x27;s advantage is the difference between the adversary&#x27;s probability of breaking the system and the probability that the system can be broken by simply guessing. The advantage is specified as a function of the security parameter.

<text>Adam is a common masculine given name in the English language, of Hebrew origin.

The name derives from Adam (Hebrew: אָדָם), the first human according to the Hebrew Bible. When used as noun, אָדָם means &quot;man&quot; or &quot;humanity&quot;. Its Biblical and Quranic uses have ensured that it is a common name in countries which draw on these traditions, and it is particularly common in Christian and Muslim majority countries. In most languages, its spelling is the same, although the pronunciation varies. Adán and Adão are the Spanish and Portuguese forms, respectively.

Adam is also a surname in many countries, although it is not as common in English as its derivative Adams (sometimes spelt Addams). In other languages, there are similar surnames derived from Adam, such as Adamo, Adamov, Adamowicz, Adamski, McAdam, etc.

In Arabic, Adam () means &quot;made from earth&#x27;s mud&quot;.

<text>Charles Stewart Mott (June 2, 1875 – February 18, 1973) was an American industrialist and businessman, philanthropist, a co-owner of General Motors, and the 50th and 55th mayor of Flint, Michigan.

Mott is the figure most responsible for founding the Flint Senior College (now University of Michigan–Flint). Mott initiated the idea of creating the college and pledged $1 million toward the project.

==Career==
Charles Stewart Mott was born on June 2, 1875, in Newark, New Jersey, to John Coon Mott and Isabella Turnbull Stewart. He graduated from Stevens Institute of Technology in 1897 with a degree in mechanical engineering. In 1907 Mott moved his wheel and axle manufacturing firm, Weston Mott, from Utica, New York to Flint, Michigan after an invitation by William C. Durant, then the President of the Buick Motor Company, which was soon to become the General Motors Corporation. Weston-Mott later merged with GM. For many decades Mott would remain the single largest individual shareholder in the firm, and accumulate wealth in excess of $800 million. His closest proteges at the helm of GM were Alfred P. Sloan, Jr. and Charles Kettering. In 1921, Mott became chief of the GM Advisory Staff at the Detroit headquarters. He served on the GM Board of Directors for 60 years, from 1913 until his death in 1973. He was Mayor of the City of Flint in 1912–1913 and was defeated for re-election in 1914, but was again elected in 1918. In 1920, he ran in the Republican primary for governor of Michigan. In 1924 and 1940, he was a Michigan delegate to the Republican National Convention. He was selected as a Republican presidential elector candidate for Michigan in 1964. Mott purchased U.S. Sugar in 1931.

==Philanthropy==
In 1926, Mott established the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation.

In 1965, Mott donated $6.5 million to the University of Michigan to help the university build its first children&#x27;s hospital. Due to his donation, the equivalent of $50 million in 2021, the university named the children&#x27;s hospital in honor of him. The 200 bed hospital would go on to serve about 3,500 children in its first year of operation.

In 1972, Mott received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.

==Personal life==
C.S. Mott married Ethel Culbert Harding in 1900 and they had three children: Aimee, Elsa and C.S. Harding. Ethel Mott died in 1924 at age 43 after falling from the window of her second-story bedroom. In 1927, Mott married his second wife Mitlies Rathburn (1892-1928). She died on February 26, 1928. In March 1929, Mott married his third wife, Dee Furey (1899-1986), and filed for divorce in October of the same year. In 1934 Mott married his fourth wife, Ruth Rawlings, with whom he also had three children: Susan Elizabeth, Stewart Rawlings, and Maryanne.

==Applewood==
C.S. Mott&#x27;s Flint, Michigan estate, Applewood, was built in 1916 as a self-sustaining farm for the Mott family. The main residence and grounds encompass approximately , 18 extensively landscaped. They include perennial, rose, cut flower and demonstration gardens, and an orchard with 29 varieties of heritage apples. The Ruth Mott Foundation currently owns and maintains Applewood, which is seasonally open to the public.

==Death==
Mott entered St. Joseph Hospital in Flint on January 28, 1973, with a cold, and then developed a flu which worsened from there. Mott died on February 18, 1973, in hospital. In response to his death, Flint City Mayor Francis E. Limmer declared a seven-day mourning period in the city. He was laid in state at St. Paul&#x27;s Episcopal Church before being interred at in the Mott family mausoleum in Glenwood Cemetery.

<text>Ybor City ( ) is a historic neighborhood just northeast of downtown Tampa, Florida, United States. It was founded in the 1880s by Vicente Martinez Ybor and other cigar manufacturers and populated by thousands of immigrants, mainly from Cuba, Spain, and Italy. For the next 50 years, workers in Ybor City&#x27;s cigar factories rolled hundreds of millions of cigars annually.

The neighborhood had features unusual among contemporary communities in the south, most notably its multiethnic and multiracial population and their many mutual aid societies. The cigar industry employed thousands of well-paid workers, helping Tampa grow from an economically depressed village to a bustling city in about 20 years and giving it the nickname &quot;Cigar City&quot;.

Ybor City grew and flourished from the 1890s until the Great Depression of the 1930s, when a drop in demand for fine cigars reduced the number of cigar factories and mechanization in the cigar industry greatly reduced employment opportunities in the neighborhood. This process accelerated after World War II, and a steady exodus of residents and businesses continued until large areas of the formerly vibrant neighborhood were virtually abandoned by the late 1970s. Attempts at redevelopment failed until the 1980s, when an influx of artists began a slow process of gentrification. In the 1990s and early 2000s, a portion of the original neighborhood around 7th Avenue developed into a nightclub and entertainment district, and many old buildings were renovated for new uses. Since then, the area&#x27;s economy has diversified with more offices and residences, and the population has shown notable growth for the first time in over half a century.

Ybor City has been designated as a National Historic Landmark District, and several structures in the area are listed in the National Register of Historic Places. In 2008, 7th Avenue, Ybor City&#x27;s main commercial thoroughfare, was recognized as one of the &quot;10 Great Streets in America&quot; by the American Planning Association. In 2010 Columbia Restaurant, which is Florida&#x27;s oldest restaurant, was named a &quot;Top 50 All-American icon&quot; by &quot;Nation&#x27;s Restaurant News&quot; magazine.

==History==



===Establishment===
In the early 1880s, Tampa was an isolated village with a population of less than 1000 and a struggling economy. However, its combination of a good port, Henry Plant&#x27;s new railroad line, and humid climate attracted the attention of Vicente Martinez Ybor, a prominent Spanish cigar manufacturer.

Ybor had moved his cigar-making operation from Cuba to Key West, Florida, in 1869, due to political turmoil in the then-Spanish colony. But, labor unrest and the lack of room for expansion had him looking for another base of operations, preferably in his own company town.

Ybor considered several communities in the southern United States and decided that an area of sandy scrubland just northeast of Tampa would be the best location. In 1885, the Tampa Board of Trade helped broker an initial purchase of of land, and Ybor quickly bought more. However, Ybor City very nearly didn&#x27;t happen at all. Vicente Ybor initially failed to come to an agreement with the owner of the 40 acre parcel. The Tampa Board of Trade was horrified to find that the purchase had failed and hatched a plan to get the buyer and seller back together. Vicente Ybor was sitting in the train station on his way to Jacksonville to look at more property when the Board of Trade (a group of five, one of whom was Frederick Salomonson, future 3-time mayor of Tampa) arrived and persuaded Ybor to reconsider and the deal went forward from there, the birth of Ybor City.

Cigar making was a specialized trade, and Tampa did not possess a workforce able to man the new factories. To attract employees, Ybor built hundreds of small houses for the coming influx of mainly Cuban and Spanish cigar workers, many of whom followed him from Key West and Cuba. Other cigar manufacturers, drawn by incentives provided by Ybor to further increase the labor pool, also moved in, quickly making Tampa a major cigar production center.

Italians were also among the early settlers of Ybor City. Most of them came from a few villages in southwestern Sicily. The villages were Santo Stefano Quisquina, Alessandria della Rocca, Bivona, Cianciana, and Contessa Entellina. Sixty percent of them came from Santo Stefano Quisquina. Before settling in Ybor City, many first worked in the sugar cane plantations in St. Cloud, central Florida. Some came by way of Louisiana. A number of families migrated from New Orleans after the lynching of eleven Italians in 1891 during the &quot;Mafia Riot&quot;. Italians mostly brought their entire families with them, unlike other immigrants. The foreign-born Italian population of Tampa grew from 56 in 1890 to 2,684 in 1940. Once arriving in Ybor City, Italians settled mainly in the eastern and southern fringes of the city. The area was referred to as La Pachata, after a Cuban rent collector in that area. It was also called &quot;Little Italy&quot;.

Unlike Cubans and Spaniards, the Italians arrived in the cigar town without cigar-making skills. When the early Italians entered the factories, it was at the bottom of the ladder, positions which did not involve handling tobacco. Working beside unskilled Cubans, mainly Afro-Cubans, they swept and hauled and were porters and doorkeepers. In time, many did become cigar workers, including Italian women. The majority of the Italian women worked as cigar strippers in 1900, an undesirable position mainly held by women who could find nothing else. However, eventually many of them became skilled cigar makers, earning more than the male Italian cigar makers. Other Italian immigrants started small businesses built around the cigar industry, such as cafés, food stores, restaurants, and boardinghouses.

The least known of the immigrants that came to Ybor City are the Germans, the Romanian Jews, and the Chinese. The Chinese and Jews were employed mainly in service trades and retail businesses. The Germans arrived after the 1890s, and most were businessmen. In the cigar factories, they worked as managers, bookkeepers, and supervisors. Cigar boxes were made by German-owned factories. Several early cigar box labels were made by German lithographers. The Germans formed their own club, the Deutsch Amerikanischer Verein. The club building is still standing on Nebraska and 11th Avenue. It contained a restaurant open to the public that served German food. In 1919, because of anti-German feelings from World War I, they sold the building to the Young Men&#x27;s Hebrew Association. The building is now used as offices for the City of Tampa.

In 1887, Tampa annexed the neighborhood. By 1900, the rough frontier settlement of wooden buildings and sandy streets had been transformed into a bustling town with brick buildings and streets, a streetcar line, and many social and cultural opportunities. Largely due to the growth of Ybor City, Tampa&#x27;s population had jumped to almost 16,000.

===The Golden Age===
Ybor City grew and prospered during the first decades of the 20th century. Thousands of residents built a community that combined Cuban, Spanish, Italian, and Jewish culture. &quot;Ybor City is Tampa&#x27;s Spanish India,&quot; observed a visitor to the area, &quot;What a colorful, screaming, shrill, and turbulent world.&quot; 
An aspect of life were the mutual aid societies built and sustained mainly by ordinary citizens. These clubs were founded in Ybor&#x27;s early days (the first was the Centro Español, established in 1891) and were run on dues collected from their members, usually 5% of a member&#x27;s salary. In exchange, members and their whole family received services including free libraries, educational programs, sports teams, restaurants, numerous social functions like dances and picnics, and free medical services. Beyond the services, these clubs served as extended families and communal gathering places for generations of Ybor&#x27;s citizens.

There were clubs for each ethnic division in the community – the Deutscher-Americaner Club (for German and eastern Europeans), L&#x27;Unione Italiana (for Italians), El Circulo Cubano (for light-skinned Cubans), La Union Marti-Maceo (for Afro-Cubans), El Centro Español (for Spaniards), and the largest, El Centro Asturiano, which accepted members from any ethnic group

Though there was little overt racism inside the diverse neighborhood, Florida&#x27;s Jim Crow laws forbade Afro-Cubans from belonging to the same social organization as their more European-looking countrymen. Sometimes differences in skin color within the same family made joining the same Cuban club impossible. In general, the rivalries between all the clubs were friendly, and families were known to switch affiliations depending on which one offered preferred services and events.

Cigar production reached its peak in 1929, when 500 million cigars were rolled in the factories of Ybor City. Not coincidentally, that was also the year that the Great Depression began.

During the 1920s, organized crime families thrived in both Tampa and Ybor. Aside from bootlegging, the Ybor mafia ran numerous numbers rackets, called bolita. By 1927, there were over 300 bolita houses in Ybor City.

===Decline and rebirth===

The Depression was a major blow to cigar manufacturers. Worldwide demand plummeted as consumers sought to cut costs by switching to less-expensive cigarettes, and factories responded by laying off workers or shutting down. This trend continued throughout the 1930s as the remaining cigar factories gradually switched from traditional hand-rolled manufacturing to cheaper mechanized methods, further reducing the number of jobs and the salaries paid to workers.

After World War II, many returning veterans chose to leave Ybor City due to a lack of well-paying jobs and a US Veterans Administration home loan program that was only applicable to new homes, of which there were few in the neighborhood. In fact, the home stock was aging poorly, as many of the structures built in the early days of Ybor City were still in use.

As the historic neighborhood continued to empty out and deteriorate through the 1950s and 1960s, the federal Urban Renewal program sought to revitalize the area by demolishing older structures and encouraging new residential and commercial development. The demolition took place, but due to a lack of funds, the redevelopment did not happen. The primary legacy of the program was blocks of vacant lots which remained empty for decades. The construction of Interstate 4 through the center of the neighborhood during this period also resulted in the destruction of many buildings and cut most of the north–south routes through the area.

By the early 1970s, very few businesses and residents remained, most notably the Columbia Restaurant and a few other businesses along 7th Avenue.

====Recovery====

In the early 1980s, an influx of artists seeking interesting and inexpensive studio quarters started a slow recovery, followed by a period of commercial
gentrification. By the early 1990s, many of the old long-empty brick buildings on 7th Avenue had been converted into bars, restaurants, nightclubs, and other nightlife attractions. Traffic grew so much that the city built parking garages and closed 7th Ave. to traffic to deal with the visitors.
Since around 2000, the city of Tampa and the Ybor City Chamber of Commerce have encouraged a broader emphasis in development. With financial help from the city, Centro Ybor, a family-oriented shopping complex and movie theater, opened in the former home of the Centro Español social club. The Florida Brewing Company building was restored into a commercial building in 2001. New apartments, condominiums and a hotel have been built on long-vacant lots, and old buildings have been restored and converted into residences and hotels. New residents began moving into Ybor City for the first time in many years. The blocks surrounding 7th Avenue also thrive with restaurants, nightlife and shopping. Reflecting the district&#x27;s status as a party destination, Ybor City is referenced extensively in the lyrics of Brooklyn-based rock band The Hold Steady. The song &quot;Killer Parties&quot;, for instance, contains the line &quot;Ybor City is très speedy, but they throw such killer parties.&quot; In May 2009 Swedish super-retailer IKEA opened its long-awaited Tampa location in the southern edge of Ybor City.

The local museum is the Ybor City Museum State Park in the former Ferlita Bakery building (originally La Joven Francesca) building on 9th Avenue. Tours of the gardens and the &quot;casitas&quot; (small homes of cigar company workers) are provided by a ranger. Exhibits, period photos and a video cover the founding of Ybor City and the cigar making industry.

==Boundaries==
Historically, the boundaries of &quot;Greater Ybor City&quot; stretched from Tampa Bay on the south to Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd. (formerly Buffalo Avenue) on the north, and from Nebraska Avenue on the west to 40th Street on the east. This eventually included all of today&#x27;s neighborhoods of Historic Ybor, East Ybor, VM Ybor, and Ybor Heights plus a portion of East Tampa. The Ybor City Historic District encompasses the central portion of that area, approximately straddling Interstate 4, which bisected the neighborhood in the 1960s.

The official boundaries of the Historic Ybor neighborhood are I-4 to the north, 22nd Street to the east, Adamo Drive to the south, and Nebraska Avenue to the west. The area of this district is about 1 square mile (about 2.6 km2). Though modern Ybor City also includes some of the surrounding area, its exact dimensions are loosely defined and subject to debate.

==Population==
At the height of its life as a thriving immigrant community, Ybor City&#x27;s population was numbered in the tens of thousands. In the lowest point in the late 1970s, perhaps 1000 residents called the neighborhood home.

In recent years, the numbers have begun to climb once more. Ybor City&#x27;s population grew an estimated 42.5% between 2000 and 2003, mainly as a result of new condominium and apartment construction. As of 2003, approximately 2,900 residents lived in the area.

==Economy and land use==
Ybor City is one of the oldest sections of Tampa and is almost entirely an urban, built-up area. Commercial property comprises almost 50% of the land, institutional use (including the Hillsborough County Sheriff&#x27;s Operations Center and a satellite campus of Hillsborough Community College) 16%, residential use about 23%, and industrial use about 7% 

According to a 2003 survey, the top five business types in the area were professional services (22.8%), retail (18.4%), manufacturing (14.0%), wholesale/distribution (13.2%), and restaurants &amp; bars (11.4%).

==Transportation==

For the most part, Ybor City still uses the gridded street system laid out by Gavino Guiterrez in 1885. Many roadways are now paved with modern materials, though a few brick streets remain.

Because 21st and 22nd Streets, which cut north–south through the area, were once the main traffic routes between Interstate 4 and the Port of Tampa Bay, there was a large volume of semi-trailer truck traffic funneling through the historic district for many years. This caused damage to narrow city roads, was a danger to pedestrians, and sometimes resulted in trucks colliding with historic buildings. In 2014, the elevated I-4/Selmon Expressway Connector was built to siphon heavy truck traffic away from the historic district.

The TECO Line Streetcar, which links Ybor City, the Channelside District and Downtown Tampa, began operating in October 2002. The Hillsborough Area Regional Transit Authority (HARTline) operates the streetcars as well as the bus system. Small startups have also begun utilizing NEVs to shuttle passengers between Tampa&#x27;s core neighborhoods including Ybor.

===Literature===
*Ybor City natives Jose Yglesias and Ferdie Pacheco have each written several books and stories set in their hometown. Most notably, Yglesias&#x27; debut novel is entitled &quot;A Wake in Ybor City&quot;, while Pacheco&#x27;s memoir of his early life is called &quot;Ybor City Chronicles&quot;.
*&quot;Anna in the Tropics&quot;, the winner of the 2003 Pulitzer Prize for Drama written by Nilo Cruz, is set in the cigar factories of Ybor City.
*Ybor City and Tampa are prominently featured in the novels &quot;Live by Night&quot; and its sequel &quot;World Gone By&quot; by Dennis Lehane.

===Film===
*The 2016 film &quot;Live by Night&quot; (based on the books of Dennis Lehane) is centered on an Ybor City bootlegger who becomes a notorious gangster during Prohibition. The crime drama was written, directed, and co-produced by Ben Affleck, who also played the starring role. Although the movie is almost entirely set in Tampa during the early 1930s, much of it was shot in and around Brunswick, Georgia due to movie production tax incentives offered by the state of Georgia and the town&#x27;s proximity to Affleck&#x27;s home. Ybor City-inspired signage and decorations were added to buildings in downtown Brunswick, and several new buildings based on locations in Tampa were constructed on empty lots to add to the &quot;fake Ybor City&quot; setting.

===Television===
*In 2016, the Ad Council and the non-profit Love Has No Labels produced a public service announcement promoting diversity and inclusion starring John Cena that used Ybor City as a backdrop for a commercial which premiered on July 4, 2016 to coincide with Pride Month. The PSA promotes the importance of acceptance of all communities, regardless of race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, age and ability.

<text>Miguel Humberto Enríquez Espinosa (; March 27, 1944 – October 5, 1974) was a physician and a founder of the Chilean Marxist-Leninist urban guerrilla Movement of the Revolutionary Left (MIR), founded in 1965. He was General Secretary of the MIR between 1967 and his death in 1974.

After the September 11, 1973 coup Enriquez led the political-military resistance of MIR against the newly established dictatorship.

After a year of Enríquez operating clandestinely, Pinochet&#x27;s secret police, the DINA, discovered his safe-house in the working class district of San Miguel in Santiago. On October 5, 1974, his house was surrounded by DINA agents backed by heavily armed security forces personnel with an armored personnel carrier and a helicopter. He was wounded in the beginning of the assault covering the retreat of his pregnant wife (Carmen Castillo, also wounded) and two other men that fled. He received ten bullet wounds, including one to the head.

His son, Marco Enríquez-Ominami, is a prominent politician in Chile, and was a candidate for the presidential election of 2009, and then again in 2013, 2017 and in 2021, losing all of the elections.

==Biography==
Miguel Enríquez was born in Concepción, Chile, into the upper middle class family of Edgardo Enríquez Frödden and Raquel Espinosa Townsend. His father Enríquez Frödden had been a prominent academic and political figure in Chile. He was a medical doctor and professor of anatomy of the University of Concepción, Chile, where he was principal (1969–1972). He had been a prominent figure in the Partido Radical (Radical Party) - in 1973 and he was appointed by Salvador Allende to the position of Minister of Education in the Popular Unity government. Dr. Edgardo Enríquez Frödden served also during 25 years as medical-surgeon in the Chilean Navy, as commander of the hospital at the Navy Base in Talcahuano and with a one-year-long specialization in the USA. His mother Espinosa Townsend graduated from the School of Law of the University of Concepción, Chile. Miguel had also two uncles which were Senators at the Chilean Parliament, Humberto Enríquez Frödden (Miguel&#x27;s second name) and Inés Enríquez Frödden.

Miguel did his first school years at Saint John&#x27;s, an exclusive English private school in Concepción. He continued his secondary education at &quot;Liceo Enrique Molina&quot; where at the age of 13 and 15, respectively, he met Marcello Ferrada de Noli and Bautista van Schouwen Vasey. With these friends and his elder brothers Marco Antonio and Edgardo Enríquez, Miguel would constitute at the end of the fifties the first core of comrades around his socialist-libertarian project of those early years. The same group would initiate a few years later the political nucleus at the youth section of the Socialist Party which under Miguel&#x27;s university years evolved to the foundation of MIR.

Enríquez entered the University of Concepción, Chile, at the age of 16 to study medicine. At the age of 23 he graduated with a Medical Degree, which he obtained with &quot;greatest distinction&quot; (&quot;distinción máxima&quot;), obtaining the second highest marks in his class (first and third were respectively Jorge Gutiérrez Correa and Bautista van Schouwen, also militants of MIR). This distinction earned Miguel at the same time a specialization scholarship to attend the prestigious Neurological Institute of Santiago de Chile. He specialized and was trained as a Neurologist.

Enríquez was an avid reader of both classical literature and political philosophy. Being also fluent in English he had a wider option of classical texts. Miguel fancied authors from Fyodor Dostoevsky, Hermann Hesse and Ernest Hemingway to utopian socialists and classical anarchists. He was also a great debater, always citing works of world history, well read in the literature of Lenin, Leon Trotsky and Rosa Luxemburg, he studied the Chinese revolution, he knew in great detail the events of the Cuban revolution and had extensive knowledge of Chilean history. He was a Carrerist; an admirer of Manuel Rodríguez; critical of the historical role of Bernardo O&#x27;Higgins and he enjoyed engaging in discussion with people who held views different from his.
In 1962, during his second year at the university in Concepción, Miguel officially entered the youth organization of the Chilean Socialist Party (Federación Juvenil Socialista, FJS) together with his brother M. Antonio and some close peers of the medical school. Enríquez&#x27; first political activities are conducted in the Spartacus cell (&quot;núcleo Espartaco&quot;), a cell organized in advance by his friend Marcello Ferrada de Noli who for that purpose had entered the Socialist Party a year before. The group became integrated by Miguel Enríquez and his brother Marco Antonio, his old-time friends Bautista van Schouwen Vasey and Marcello Ferrada de Noli (cell&#x27;s leader), Martin Hernández, and a new university peers Miguel had met at the University of Concepción (Jorge Gutiérrez Correa). All these young men - except Martin Hernández - left the Socialist Party together with Miguel Enríquez in January 1964 amid a stormy National Convention held in the southern city of Concepción.

Senator Raúl Ampuero - the national chairman of the party - had long been dealing with Enríquez&#x27;s public criticism of a party strategy characterised as &quot;reformist&quot; and alien, according to Enríquez, to the working classes&#x27; interest. Chairman Ampuero, supported by a majority of the convention delegates, proceeded to marginalize Enríquez and his closest colleagues of the Spartacus cell from the Socialist Party, some of them in strategic leading positions inside the &quot;Comité Regional de la Juventud Socialista&quot;. Miguel Enríquez was then 21 years old. In fact, Miguel had already organized (1963) a clandestine fraction called &quot;Movimiento Socialista Revolucionario&quot;, or &quot;MSR&quot;, integrated by a handful of his peers and his two elder brothers Marco Antonio and Edgardo Enríquez. Edgardo had had the task of developing the MSR fraction at the Socialist Party in Santiago.

After the events of February 1964 in Concepción, this entire group, together with other small forces mainly from Santiago de Chile, entered the short-lived political group called &quot;VRM&quot;. During the VRM-period (1964–1965) some few new cadres - each of them with previous experiences in other political organizations - were recruited by Miguel&#x27;s group. Among them Luciano Cruz Aguayo, Sergio Pérez Molina, Jorge Fuentes (nickname Trotsko), Edgardo Condeza, Juan Saavedra Gorriategy, Máximo Jara, and Horacio Vergara Mehrson. All of whom, together with old-timers Marcello Ferrada de Noli, Bautista Van Schowen Vasey, Jorge Gutiérrez Correa, and his brothers Edgardo and Marco A., formed Miguel Enríquez first VRM-group in Concepción, the embryo of MIR.

The foundation of MIR took place in August 1965, in a constituent assembly held at the Chilean Anarchist&#x27;s facilities in Santiago and in which less than a hundred persons participated, mainly from Concepción and Santiago. Here Luciano Cruz participated also for the first time together with Enríquez as militants of the same political organization. The document &quot;La conquista del poder por la vía insureccional&quot; (&quot;the conquest of power through insurrection&quot;) with the first political-military theses of MIR and which was elaborated by Miguel Enríquez (&quot;Viriatto&quot;), his brother Marco Antonio (&quot;Bravo&quot;) and Marcello Ferrada de Noli (&quot;Atacama&quot;) was approved by the foundation congress. Miguel was then elected a member of the new organization&#x27;s Central Committee, however he became officially MIR&#x27;s chairman only in 1967. In this post as political leader MIR Miguel Enríquez remained until his death, when he was murdered by Pinochet&#x27;s forces in October 1974.

==Criticism of the Popular Unity government==

Under his leadership the MIR provided only critical support to the &quot;Unidad Popular&quot; (UP) (Popular Unity) government headed by Salvador Allende between 1970 and 1973. Highly critical of the reformist role being played by the Communist Party of Chile in the Popular Unity government, the MIR became the object of considerable criticism and attacks by both the left and right of the political establishment. The MIR vehemently attacked the reluctance of the Popular Unity government to openly utilize force to seize private property and establish a socialist regime.

As the &quot;U.P.&quot; coalition headed by Salvador Allende leaned more to a gradual transition to socialism, abiding by the Laws and current Constitution and trusting that the &quot;neutral political tradition&quot; of the Chilean armed forces would avoid a military intervention, the MIR called for an armed revolution. The MIR, organized, recruited and trained people in para-military camps, preparing them to lead the revolution.

Miguel Enriquez&#x27;s plans for a revolution were interrupted by the September 11 Military Coup.

==September 11, 1973 Military Coup==

After the September 11, 1973 coup Miguel Enríquez and other members of the MIR refused to accept political asylum in foreign embassies and rejected a condition of exile outside their country – considering the act of fleeing for personal security a form of betrayal to their socialist cause. Instead, they insisted on leading their communist revolution.

One of the first and major undertakings of Army Intelligence DINA was to exterminate by all means the leadership of the MIR. The MIR became of particular concern to Pinochet because it had had no formal organization framework and relied on cells; much of its activities were unpredictable and irregular in nature; they had also managed to infiltrate the Chilean Armed Forces. The MIR became the object of Pinochet’s paranoia. As a result, between 1973 and 1976 most of its young leaders like Miguel Enriquez and Bautista van Schouwen Vasey were killed. The Rettig report (Report of the Chilean National Commission on Truth and Reconciliation) emphasized the repression against the MIR.

After the coup d&#x27;état by the armed forces against Allende&#x27;s government on Tuesday 11 September 1973, Miguel was one of the main guerrilla leaders that remained after many fled the country. This proved to be a precarious existence and Miguel was killed in a gun fight with agents of the Dirección de Inteligencia Nacional (DINA) (National Intelligence Directorate) in the slum home where he was carrying out his clandestine operations. He is buried in the Cementerio General de Chile in Santiago and the medicine faculty of the Superior Institute of Medicine of La Habana, Cuba, has been named in his honor.

<text>John I ( 1268 - 20 May 1285) sometimes called Jean II (in the Kingdom of Jerusalem) was King of Cyprus and, in contention with Charles I of Anjou, of Jerusalem from 1284 to 1285.

John was the eldest surviving son of Hugh III, king of Cyprus and Jerusalem, and Isabella of Ibelin. Hugh died on 3 March 1284 and John was crowned the next king of Cyprus in Nicosia on 11 May. He was then aged about 17, and was handsome and delicate. Immediately afterwards, he sailed to Tyre, where he was crowned king of Jerusalem. On the mainland, he was recognized as king only in Tyre and Beirut, which were ruled by his aunt Margaret and brother Guy, respectively. Acre, political centre of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, recognized Charles. John died on 20 May 1285, almost exactly a year after his coronation, leaving the crown to his younger brother Henry II.

<text>Cephamycins are a group of β-lactam antibiotics. They are very similar to cephalosporins, and the cephamycins are sometimes classified as cephalosporins.

Like cephalosporins, cephamycins are based upon the cephem nucleus. Unlike most cephalosporins, cephamycins are a very efficient antibiotic against anaerobic microbes.

Cephamycins were originally produced by &quot;Streptomyces&quot;, but synthetic ones have been produced as well.

Cephamycins possess a methoxy group at the 7-alpha position.

In addition, cephamycins have been shown to be stable against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing organisms, although their use in clinical practice is lacking for this indication.

==Examples==
Cephamycins include:
* Cefoxitin
* Cefotetan
* Cefmetazole

<text>Boris Aleksandrovich Vorontsov-Velyaminov (; February 14, 1904 – January 27, 1994) was a Russian astrophysicist. His name is sometimes given as Vorontsov-Vel&#x27;yaminov.

He independently discovered the absorption of light by interstellar dust, which was also discovered by Robert Julius Trumpler. He compiled a catalogue of what are now known as Vorontsov-Velyaminov galaxies (the &quot;Atlas of Interacting Galaxies&quot;), as well as a larger and more general catalogue of galaxies (the &quot;Morphological Catalogue of Galaxies&quot;). He also studied and classified planetary nebulae. He is also the author of the standard Russian astronomy textbook for high schools as well as astronomy textbook for secondary school. The inner main belt asteroid (2916) Voronveliya is named after him.

<text>Nancy Anna Francina Coolen, known as Nance (born 10 September 1973 in Asten, North Brabant, Netherlands) is a Dutch singer and television presenter, and the former lead vocalist of Eurodance act Twenty 4 Seven.

At the age of 15, Nance was discovered in a club by dance producer Ruud van Rijen, who created the dance-act Twenty 4 Seven around her and rapper Captain Hollywood, who was later replaced by Stay C. The act scored several hits, most notably &quot;Slave to the Music&quot;.

In 1996, Nance left Twenty 4 Seven to embark on a solo career. Around the same time she began working as a presenter for Dutch television by occasionally hosting the Dutch Top 40 for TMF Nederland. Nance moved on to various game shows, such as &quot;Liefde is...&quot; for RTL 5 and &quot;Rappatongo&quot; for TROS, before taking over as the host of Lingo, which she presented until 2005.

<text>Choplifter (stylized as Choplifter!) is a military-themed scrolling shooter developed by Dan Gorlin for the Apple II and published by Broderbund in 1982. It was ported to the Atari 8-bit computers the same year, and also to the VIC-20, Commodore 64, Atari 5200 (released in February 1984), ColecoVision, MSX, and Thomson computers.

In 1985, Sega released a remake as an arcade video game, with ports published for the Master System and Famicom in 1986. Graphically enhanced versions for the Atari 8-bit computers and Atari 7800 were also released in 1988 by Atari Corporation.

==Gameplay==
In &quot;Choplifter&quot;, the player assumes the role of a combat helicopter pilot. The objective is to rescue hostages held in barracks within the territory controlled by the evil Bungeling Empire. The player must collect the hostages (described in the backstory as &quot;delegates to the United Nations Conference on Peace and Child Rearing&quot;) and safely transport them to the nearby U.S. Postal Service building, all while fending off hostile tanks and other enemy combatants. According to the backstory, the helicopter&#x27;s parts were smuggled into the country, disguised as a &quot;mail-sorting machine&quot;.

The helicopter can face three directions: left, right, or forward (facing the player). It can shoot at enemies in any of these directions and need not fly in the same direction it is facing. The forward-facing mode is primarily used to shoot at tanks. The player must be cautious to protect the hostages from enemy fire and avoid hitting them with friendly fire.

To rescue the prisoners, the player must first shoot at one of the hostage buildings to release the hostages, then land to allow them to board the sortie, and finally return them to the player&#x27;s starting point. Each of the four buildings holds 16 hostages, and the helicopter can only carry up to 16 passengers at a time, meaning several trips are necessary. Once the chopper is full, no more hostages will attempt to board; they will wave the helicopter off and wait for its return. Each successive trip is typically more perilous than the last, as the enemy becomes aware of the player&#x27;s actions and mounts a counterattack.

If the player lands directly on top of a hostage or completely blocks the building exit, the hostages will be killed. In the Apple II and Atari 7800 versions, hostages will also die if the helicopter is not landed correctly (i.e., if it is slightly tilted), being crushed as they attempt to board. While grounded, the helicopter can be attacked by enemy tanks, which it can only shoot at by returning to the air. Additionally, enemy jet fighters are deployed, which can attack the helicopter in the air with air-to-air missiles or on the ground with bombs.

==Development==
Coming off a stint working for the Rand Corporation, Dan Gorlin initially developed &quot;Choplifter&quot; using an Apple II loaned to him by his grandfather. Initially, Gorlin envisioned &quot;Choplifter&quot; as a 3D game, but he switched to a traditional 2D game environment due to technical limitations.

The game was developed in six months. After Gorlin began experimenting with animating a helicopter on the Apple II, he added scenery, tanks, and planes, with the hostages being added last. He noted that, as a story developed, the film camera techniques seemed appropriate, including the final message &quot;The End&quot; instead of &quot;Game Over&quot;. Gorlin&#x27;s first demonstration to Broderbund was &quot;too realistic&quot; for a helicopter simulation, and the company helped him make it easier to fly. The concept of rescuing hostages was inspired by Gorlin&#x27;s experience with the game &quot;Defender&quot;, in which the player must protect people on the ground. Although the Iran hostage crisis ended the year before the game was released, Gorlin said that the game was not intended to be a &quot;tie-in&quot; to this event during the game&#x27;s development.

In the 1990s, Gorlin revisited the 3D concept in a failed attempt to remake the game.

==Reception==
Debuting in May 1982, the game sold 9,000 copies by June, appearing on &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;″s list of top sellers. &quot;II Computing&quot; listed &quot;Choplifter&quot; seventh on the magazine&#x27;s list of top Apple II games as of late 1985, based on sales and market-share data.

In Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed Sega&#x27;s arcade version of &quot;Choplifter&quot; in the November 1, 1985, issue as the most successful table arcade unit on the bi-weekly chart. After being dethroned by Taito&#x27;s &quot;The Legend of Kage&quot; on November 15, &quot;Choplifter&quot; returned to the top of the chart on December 1, 1985.

===Reviews===
&quot;Softline&quot; in 1982 called the game &quot;the first Interactive Computer-Assisted Animated Movie&quot;, describing it as a fusion of arcade gaming, simulation, and filmic visual aesthetics. The magazine praised the animation and the helicopter&#x27;s &quot;subtle flight control&quot; and concluded that seeing the hostages&#x27; &quot;hope and excitement, their faith in you&quot; made the game &quot;hard to play&quot;. In 1983, its readers named &quot;Choplifter&quot; fourth on the magazine&#x27;s Top Thirty list of Atari 8-bit programs by popularity. &quot;BYTE&quot; called &quot;Choplifter&quot; &quot;great fun&quot;. &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;, &quot;Creative Computing Video &amp; Arcade Games&quot;, and &quot;The Commodore 64 Home Companion&quot; praised the graphics and animation, the latter stating that the hostages running across the desert made the game &quot;alive&quot; and realistic.

The Apple II version of the game received a Certificate of Merit in the category of &quot;Best Computer Audiovisual Effects&quot; at the 4th annual Arkie Awards, and shortly afterward, &quot;Billboard&quot; named it Computer Game of the Year. &quot;The Addison-Wesley Book of Atari Software 1984&quot; gave the game an overall A+ rating, calling it &quot;a masterpiece&quot;. The book concluded that the concept, graphics, and animation make this &quot;a delightful game&quot;. &quot;InfoWorld&#x27;s Essential Guide to Atari Computers&quot; cited it as &quot;innovative&quot; and a &quot;winner&quot;.

&quot;Console XS&quot; magazine reviewed the Sega Master System version, giving it a score of 85%. &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; magazine reviewed the Master System version in 1989, giving it a score of 87%. They also reviewed the ColecoVision and Atari 7800 versions, giving them scores of 81% and 84%, respectively.

==Legacy==
&quot;Choplifter II&quot;, subtitled &quot;Rescue Survive&quot;, was released for the Game Boy in 1991, then remade for both the Game Boy and Game Gear as &quot;Choplifter III&quot; in 1994. An unrelated &quot;Choplifter III&quot; was released for Super NES.

In late 1997, Gorlin and his development team, Ariok Entertainment, were working on a &quot;Choplifter&quot; game for IBM PC compatibles that would be in 3D and feature multiplayer functionality. The game was never released.

Sega released a pair of spiritual successors without the &quot;Choplifter&quot; brand:
* &quot;Air Rescue&quot; (1991) for the Sega System 32 arcade hardware is a first-person, pseudo-3D take on the concept.
* &quot;Air Rescue&quot; (1992) for the Master System more closely resembles the 2D &quot;Choplifter,&quot; but features stages that scroll in all directions.

Programmer Will Botti cited &quot;Choplifter&quot; as a major inspiration for his 1996 game &quot;Black Dawn&quot;.

In 2004, Xicat Interactive published &quot;ChopLifter: Crisis Shield&quot; exclusively in Europe.

inXile Entertainment released &quot;Choplifter HD&quot; for Xbox Live Arcade, PlayStation Network, and Microsoft Windows in January 2012, and for Ouya in August 2013.

<text>Kennet Avenue or West Kennet Avenue is a prehistoric site in the English county of Wiltshire. It was an avenue of two parallel lines of stones 25m wide and 2.5 km in length, which ran between the Neolithic sites of Avebury and The Sanctuary.

Excavations by Stuart Piggott and Alexander Keiller in the 1930s indicated that around 100 pairs of standing stones had lined the avenue, dated to around 2200 BC from finds of Beaker burials beneath some of them. Many stones have fallen or are missing, however. A second avenue, called Beckhampton Avenue, led west from Avebury towards Beckhampton Long Barrow.

Maud Cunnington righted some of the stones during her work there in the early 20th century. Keiller restored the northern third of the avenue in 1934–1935. There are currently 27 upright stones and 37 concrete pillars marking original stone locations.

The avenue is within the Avebury section of the Stonehenge and Avebury World Heritage Site. It is in the freehold ownership of the National Trust, and a scheduled monument in English Heritage guardianship. It is managed by the National Trust on behalf of English Heritage, and the two organisations share the cost of managing and maintaining the property.

== Occupation site ==
The West Kennet Avenue occupation site, discovered by Keiller in 1934 and re-excavated by Joshua Pollard and Mark Gillings from 2013–15, are the remains of Neolithic settlement activity. The more recent excavations recovered 16,399 pieces of worked flint with dating ranging from the Mesolithic to the Early Bronze Age.

<text>John Tebbutt (25 May 1834 – 29 November 1916) was an Australian astronomer and meteorologist, famous for discovering the Great Comets of [[C/1861 J1|1861]] and [[C/1881 K1|1881]].
==Early life==
Tebbutt was born at Windsor, New South Wales, the only son of John Tebbutt, then a prosperous store keeper. His grandfather, John Tebbutt, was one of the early settlers in Australia; he arrived at Sydney about the end of 1801.
Tebbutt was educated first at the Church of England parish school, then at a private school kept by the Rev. Mathew Adam of the local Presbyterian church, and finally at a small but excellent school under the Rev. Henry Tarlton Stiles, where he had a sound training in Latin.

==Career==
In 1845 Tebbutt&#x27;s father purchased a tract of land at the eastern end of the town of Windsor known as the peninsula, and built a residence there. In 1853 John Tebutt purchased a sextant and using this along with an ordinary marine telescope and a watch began his observations of the heavens.

About nine years later, on 13 May 1861, Tebbutt discovered the 1861 comet, one of the most brilliant comets known. There was no means then of telegraphing the intelligence to England where it became visible on 29 June. Tebbutt was acknowledged as the first discoverer of this comet, and the first to compute its approximate orbit. In November 1861 he purchased an excellent refracting telescope of aperture and focal length. In 1862, on the resignation of the Rev. W. Scott, he was offered the position of government astronomer for New South Wales but refused it.

Tebbutt also discovered Nova Scorpii 1862, a nova visible to the unaided eye.

==Observatory==

In 1863 he built, with his own hands, a small observatory close to his father&#x27;s residence, and installed his instruments consisting of his 3¼-inch telescope, a two-inch transit instrument, and an eight-day, one-half-second box-chronometer. Shortly before this period Tebbutt had begun to record meteorological observations, and in 1868 published these for the years 1863 to 1866 under the title &quot;Meteorological Observations made at the Private Observatory of John Tebbutt, Jnr&quot;.

He continued the publication of these records at intervals for more than 30 years. He had also begun a long series of papers which were published in the &quot;Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society of London&quot;, in the &quot;Astronomical Register&quot;, London, and in the &quot;Journal and Proceedings of the Royal Society of New South Wales&quot;. He contributed to other scientific journals, and made an immense number of contributions to the Australian press.
Tebbutt received a Paris Exposition Silver Medal in 1867 in recognition of his paper &quot;On the Progress and Present State of Astronomical Science in New South Wales&quot;.

In 1872 a equatorial refracting telescope was purchased for the observatory. In 1881 Tebbutt discovered another great comet, now designated C/1881 K1. In 1886 a new telescope of aperture and focal length was purchased, which enabled him to considerably extend his operations. In 1887 he published &quot;History and description of Mr. Tebbutt&#x27;s observatory, Windsor, New South Wales&quot;, and followed this with a yearly report for about 15 years.

Between 1868 and 1902 he made 396 lunar occultation observations.

A branch of the British Astronomical Association was established at Sydney in 1895 and Tebbutt was elected its first president. In 1904, in his seventieth year, he discontinued systematic work, though he retained his interest in astronomy and continued to do some observing. The following year the Royal Astronomical Society of London recognised his work by awarding him the Jackson-Gwilt Medal of the society.

In 1908, Tebbutt published his &quot;Astronomical Memoirs&quot;, giving an account of his 54 years of work. He was much gratified in 1914, during the visit of the British association, by a visit to his observatory of a small party of astronomers. He died at Windsor on 29 November 1916.

The year after his death, his son delivered John Tebbutt&#x27;s working library and manuscripts to the State Library of New South Wales. The &quot;John Tebbutt Memorial Collection&quot; is made up of 3,676 printed volumes, 117 volumes of manuscripts and 235 pamphlets.

He was commemorated on the reverse side of the Australian one hundred-dollar note, in circulation 1984 until 1996 when it was replaced by a portrait of Sir John Monash.

<text>A Journey in Other Worlds: A Romance of the Future is a science fiction novel by John Jacob Astor IV, published in 1894.

==Overview==

The book offers a fictional account of life in the year 2000. It contains abundant speculation about technological invention, including descriptions of a worldwide telephone network, solar power, air travel, space travel to the planets Saturn and Jupiter, and terraforming engineering projects — damming the Arctic Ocean, and an adjustment of the axial tilt of the Earth (Terra) by the Terrestrial Axis Straightening Company.

The future United States is a multi-continental superpower. European nations have been taken over by socialist governments, which have sold most of their African colonies to the U.S., while Canada, Mexico, and the countries of South America have requested annexation. Space travel is achieved through apergy, an anti-gravitational energy force. 
Jupiter proves to be a jungle world, with flesh-eating plants, vampire bats, giant snakes and mastodons, and flying lizards. The Americans discover a wealth of exploitable resources: iron, silver, gold, lead, copper, coal, and oil.

Saturn, in contrast, is an ancient world of silent spirits. These beings provide the explorers with foresight of their own deaths. One of the spirits, a deceased bishop, tells the voyagers about the icy world Cassandra, which orbits the Sun beyond Neptune and is home to the souls of unworthy Earthlings.
