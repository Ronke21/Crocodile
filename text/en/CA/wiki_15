<text>The Rijke tube is a cylindrical tube with both ends open, inside of which a heat source is placed that turns heat into sound, by creating a self-amplifying standing wave, due to thermo-acoustic instability. It is an entertaining phenomenon in acoustics and is an excellent example of resonance.

==Discovery==
P. L. Rijke was a professor of physics at the Leiden University in the Netherlands when, in 1859, he discovered a way of using heat to sustain a sound in a cylindrical tube open at both ends. He used a glass tube, about 0.8 m long and 3.5 cm in diameter. Inside it, about 20 cm from one end, he placed a disc of wire gauze as shown in the figure on right. Friction with the walls of the tube is sufficient to keep the gauze in position. With the tube vertical and the gauze in the lower half, he heated the gauze with a flame until it was glowing red hot. Upon removing the flame, he obtained a loud sound from the tube which lasted until the gauze cooled down (about 10s). It is safer in modern reproductions of this experiment to use a borosilicate glass tube or, better still, one made of metal.

Instead of heating the gauze with a flame, Rijke also tried electrical heating. Making the gauze with electrical resistance wire causes it to glow red when a sufficiently large current is passed. With the heat being continuously supplied, the sound is also continuous and rather loud. Rijke seems to have received complaints from his university colleagues because he reports that the sound could be easily heard three rooms away from his laboratory. The electrical power required to achieve this is about 1 kW.

Lord Rayleigh, who wrote the definitive textbook on sound in 1877, recommends this as a very effective lecture demonstration. He used a cast iron pipe 1.5 m long and 12 cm diameter with two layers of gauze made from iron wire inserted about quarter of the way up the tube. The extra gauze is to retain more heat, which makes the sound longer lasting. He reports in his book that the sound rises to such intensity as to shake the room!

A &quot;reverse&quot; Rijke effect — namely, that a Rijke tube will also produce audio oscillations if &quot;hot&quot; air flows through a &quot;cold&quot; screen — was first observed by Rijke&#x27;s assistant Johannes Bosscha and subsequently investigated by German physicist Peter Theophil Rieß.

==Mechanism==


The sound comes from a standing wave whose wavelength is about twice the length of the tube, giving the fundamental frequency. Lord Rayleigh, in his book, gave the correct explanation of how the sound is stimulated. The flow of air past the gauze is a combination of two motions. There is a uniform upwards motion of the air due to a convection current resulting from the gauze heating up the air. Superimposed on this is the motion due to the sound wave.

For half the vibration cycle, the air flows into the tube from both ends until the pressure reaches a maximum. During the other half cycle, the flow of air is outwards until the minimum pressure is reached. All air flowing past the gauze is heated to the temperature of the gauze and any transfer of heat to the air will increase its pressure according to the ideal gas law. As the air flows upwards past the gauze most of it will already be hot because it has just come downwards past the gauze during the previous half cycle. However, just before the pressure maximum, a small quantity of cool air comes into contact with the gauze and its pressure is suddenly increased. This increases the pressure maximum, so reinforcing the vibration. During the other half cycle, when the pressure is decreasing, the air above the gauze is forced downwards past the gauze again. Since it is already hot, no pressure change due to the gauze takes place, since there is no transfer of heat. The sound wave is therefore reinforced once every vibration cycle, and it quickly builds up to a very large amplitude.

This explains why there is no sound when the flame is heating the gauze: all air flowing through the tube is heated by the flame, so when it reaches the gauze, it is already hot and no pressure increase takes place.

When the gauze is in the upper half of the tube, there is no sound. In this case, the cool air brought in from the bottom by the convection current reaches the gauze towards the end of the outward vibration movement. This is immediately before the pressure minimum, so a sudden increase in pressure due to the heat transfer tends to cancel out the sound wave instead of reinforcing it.

The position of the gauze in the tube is not critical as long as it is in the lower half. To work out its best position, there are two things to consider. Most heat will be transferred to the air where the displacement of the wave is a maximum, i.e. at the end of the tube. However, the effect of increasing the pressure is greatest where there is the greatest pressure variation, i.e. in the middle of the tube. Placing the gauze midway between these two positions (one quarter of the way in from the bottom end) is a simple way to come close to the optimal placement.

The Rijke tube is considered to be a standing wave form of thermoacoustic devices known as &quot;heat engines&quot; or &quot;&quot;.

== Sondhauss tube ==

The Rijke tube operates with both ends open. However, a tube with one end closed will also generate sound from heat, if the closed end is very hot. Such a device is called a &quot;Sondhauss tube&quot;. The phenomenon was first observed by glassblowers and was first described in 1850 by the German physicist Karl Friedrich Julius Sondhauss (1815–1886). Lord Rayleigh first explained the operation of the Sondhauss tube.

The Sondhauss tube operates in a way that is basically similar to the Rijke tube: Initially, air moves towards the hot, closed end of the tube, where it&#x27;s heated, so that the pressure at that end increases. The hot, higher-pressure air then flows from the closed end towards the cooler, open end of the tube. The air transfers its heat to the tube and cools. The air surges slightly beyond the open end of the tube, briefly compressing the atmosphere; the compression propagates through the atmosphere as a sound wave. The atmosphere then pushes the air back into the tube, and the cycle repeats. Unlike the Rijke tube, the Sondhauss tube does not require a steady flow of air through it, and whereas the Rijke tube acts as a half-wave resonator, the Sondhauss tube acts as a quarter-wave resonator.

Like the Rijke tube, it was discovered that placing a porous heater — as well as a &quot;stack&quot; (a &quot;plug&quot; that is porous) — in the tube greatly increased the power and efficiency of the Sondhauss tube. (In demonstration models, the tube can be heated externally and steel wool can serve as a stack.)

<text>Ottavio Piccolomini, 1st Duke of Amalfi (11 November 1599 – 11 August 1656) was an Italian nobleman whose military career included service as a Spanish general and then as a field marshal of the Holy Roman Empire.

==Early life==

Piccolomini was born in Florence as youngest son of Silvio Piccolomini and Violante Gerini. The house of Piccolomini was a Sienese family that had seen two of its members elected to the papal throne (Popes Pius II and Pius III). Piccolomini received a military education as a young boy and became a tercio pikeman for the Crown of Spain at the age of almost seventeen.

1618 saw the outbreak of the Thirty Years&#x27; War. Piccolomini was appointed captain of a cavalry regiment in Bohemia, sent by the Grand Duke of Tuscany to the emperor&#x27;s army. He fought with distinction under Count Charles Bucquoy at the Battle of White Mountain in 1620 and later in Hungary.
In 1624 he served for a short time again in the Spanish army besieging Breda and then as a lieutenant-colonel of Gottfried Heinrich Graf zu Pappenheim&#x27;s cuirassier regiment in Northern Italy. In 1627 he returned to the Imperial service as colonel and captain of the personal guard of Albrecht von Wallenstein, Duke of Friedland. In this capacity, Piccolomini fell into disgrace for attempting to extort money from people of Stargard in Pomerania. But his dedication and contrition saw him return to the rank of &quot;colonel of horse and foot&quot;, commanding both a cavalry and an infantry regiment.

In 1628 his brother, Ascanio Piccolomini, was appointed Archbishop of Siena which secured Ottavio a position in the diplomatic world. Wallenstein made use of his subordinate&#x27;s capacity for negotiation and intrigue. During the Mantuan War, Piccolomini took a prominent part in the dual role of subtle diplomat and plundering soldier of fortune.

In 1630 came the invasion of Germany by Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden. Piccolomini could not directly return to Germany because he was held hostage at Ferrara until September 1631 to guarantee the Peace of Cherasco that ended the Mantuan War. Despite his support for Wallenstein, he was not included in the list of promotions when the Duke resumed action against Saxony, Brandenburg and Sweden. Thereafter, Piccolomini served as a colonel under Feldmarschallleutnant Heinrich Holk, a Danish officer, in the battle of Lützen and other operations.

Nineteenth-century authors were so impressed by Piccolomini&#x27;s role in the battle of Lützen that they falsely ascribed to him the command of the entire Imperial left wing. He did, though, play a pivotal role at the head of his cavalry regiment, leading numerous cavalry charges against the Swedish army, having five horses shot under him, and receiving six painful bruises from musket balls that deflected off his armour.

==As a commanding officer==

After reading the official report of the battle, the emperor made Piccolomini &quot;General-Feldwachtmeister&quot;. At the same time, Holk, who had played an even more crucial role in holding the Imperial army together at Lützen, was promoted to field marshal at Wallenstein&#x27;s insistence, much to Piccolomini&#x27;s chagrin.

In the campaign of 1633, Piccolomini was appointed commander of a detachment posted at Königgratz assigned to bar the enemy&#x27;s advance from Silesia into Bohemia. In May, Piccolomini accompanied Wallenstein and the main army on their way to Silesia in an attempt to compel the electors of Brandenburg and Saxony to join the emperor against the Swedes. Because Piccolomini disapproved of Wallenstein&#x27;s policy and its results, he joined in the military conspiracy to oust the duke. On 24 January 1634 Ferdinand II signed a decree dismissing Wallenstein and instructed Count Gallas and Piccolomini to determine a course of action for removing the duke, but did not specifically demand his death. Nevertheless, the conspiracy developed into a plot to assassinate the Duke; Wallenstein was killed on 25 February 1634 at Cheb Castle. Piccolomini&#x27;s reward was his marshal&#x27;s baton, 100,000 gulden and the estate of Náchod in the Orlické mountains in East Bohemia. Piccolomini&#x27;s part in the assassination was set out in fictionalised form in Friedrich Schiller&#x27;s play, &quot;Wallenstein&quot;.

On 5 and 6 September of that same year, Piccolomini distinguished himself at the Battle of Nördlingen. In his first independent command following the battle, he expelled the opposing troops of Sweden and the Heilbronn League from Franconia. From 1635 to 1639, Piccolomini commanded an Imperial auxiliary corps supporting Spain in the Southern Netherlands and Northern France. In this position, he achieved a number of military successes but often complained about a lack of support from the Spanish authorities. In 1636, his corps supported the Spanish offensive in France that crossed the Somme and captured the important fortress of Corbie. After his own troops took Roye and approached Paris as far as Compiègne, Piccolomini urged Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand of Austria, the leader of the Spanish operations, to advance further, but the Cardinal-Infante deemed the offensive to be too high risk with little reward.

Piccolomini&#x27;s achievements included relieving French sieges of Saint-Omer in 1638 together with Thomas Francis, Prince of Carignano and especially of Thionville on 7 July 1639 in a crushing victory over the Marquis de Feuquieres. He was rewarded with the status of Count of the Empire in 1638 and the elevation to the office of privy councillor and the dukedom of Amalfi from King Philip IV of Spain in 1639.

Still in 1639, Piccolomini and his corps were recalled from the Southern Netherlands by the emperor to end the Swedish invasion of Bohemia. Despite own hopes to replace Matthias Gallas as main commander of the Imperials, Piccolomini was ordered to assist the emperor&#x27;s brother, Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria. Together they repelled the Swedes under Johan Banér and secured Bohemia and Saxony in 1640. However, they failed in their main goal to beat the Swedish army in battle. After Banér&#x27;s failed attempt to attack the Regensburg Reichstag in January 1641, Piccolomini and Gottfried Huyn von Geleen chased him with the united Imperial and Bavarian force. Nonetheless, Piccolomini could only catch and defeat the rear of Banér&#x27;s army in Neunburg vorm Wald and Preßnitz while the rest escaped. In November 1642, the Imperials finally faced the entire Swedish army but lost the second battle of Breitenfeld against Lennart Torstensson.

Thereafter he spent several years in the Spanish service and received the title of grandee and induction into the Order of the Golden Fleece. After being recalled to Spain in 1647, he resigned as Spanish commander with the intention to return to the Imperial army.

==Promotion to Generalissimo==

When the Imperial commander Peter Melander, Graf von Holzappel, fell in battle at Zusmarshausen in May 1648, Piccolomini was at last appointed lieutenant-general of the emperor. He conducted the final campaign of the Thirty Years&#x27; War in which he and the Bavarians under Hunolstein stopped the Swedish and French advance at the rivers Inn and Danube and forced them to retreat out of Bavaria across the Lech.

After the Peace of Westphalia, Piccolomini served as Imperial plenipotentiary at the executive congress of Nuremberg that discussed and oversaw the execution of the peace regulations. Three days after the congress had finished its labours in October 1650, Ferdinand III addressed a letter of thanks to the &quot;Prince Piccolomini&quot;, declaring him Prince of the Empire and awarding him a gift of 114,566 gulden.

==Marriage, death, and legacy==
On 4 June 1651 Piccolomini married Maria Benigna Francisca of Saxe-Lauenburg, daughter of Duke Julius Henry of Saxe-Lauenburg with no legitimate children. Piccolomini had adopted his distant nephew Josef Silvio, most likely Schiller&#x27;s inspiration for the fictional son Max Piccolomini in &quot;Wallenstein&quot;. Josef Silvio was murdered by the Swedes after the Battle of Jankov (near Votice in the district of Tábor) in southern Bohemia in 1645.

Piccolomini&#x27;s titles and estates passed to his brother&#x27;s grandson. With the death of the latter&#x27;s nephew Octavio Aeneas Josef in 1757, the line became extinct. Piccolomini had two known illegitimate sons – Ascanio and Diego, who left descendants, one in Bohemia and the other in Italy. His elder son Ascanio died as a captain of infantry in the battle near Mírov in September 1643, while the younger son Diego died in Italy after gaining the title &quot;don&quot; and becoming a &quot;noble&quot; married to Nobile Donna Maria Anna Tarragona Ruxoto. Ascanio himself had an illegitimate son with Liduska Nyvlt.

Piccolomini died after falling from a horse on 11 August 1656.

<text>Waisale Tikoisolomoni Serevi (born 20 May 1968) is a Fijian former rugby union football player and coach, and is a member of the World Rugby Hall of Fame. Serevi is renowned for his achievements in rugby sevens, while also enjoying a long career in fifteen-a-side rugby at both club and national team levels. Nicknamed &quot;The Wizard&quot; by commentators, he is widely considered to be the greatest rugby sevens player in the history of the game. A biography of Serevi titled &quot;Waisale Serevi: King of Sevens&quot; by Nick Darvenzi was published in 2018.

In the 15-man game, he played for Fiji 39 times between 1989 and 2003, and scored 376 points. This included representing Fiji in the 1991, 1999, and 2003 Rugby World Cups. He also played professionally for the Mitsubishi, Leicester, Stade Montois, Stade Bordelais and Staines rugby teams.

His representative sevens career started in 1989 when he played for Fiji at the Hong Kong tournament. Serevi also played in the 1993, 1997, 2001, and 2005 Rugby World Cup Sevens, winning the World Cup with Fiji in 1997 and 2005. He won silver at the Commonwealth Games in 1998 and 2002, and captured bronze in 2006. Serevi played in the International Rugby Board Sevens Series since its creation in 1999. In 2005 after winning the 2005 Rugby World Cup Sevens Serevi was appointed player-coach of the Fiji Sevens national team. He led Fiji to the 2005–06 World Sevens Series victory – the first time the series was won by a team other than New Zealand.

== Early life ==
The third of five children, Serevi was born in Suva, on the island of Viti Levu, on 20 May 1968. He was raised by staunch Christian parents who were both heavily involved in the Church. Serevi&#x27;s inspiration to play rugby stemmed from his childhood, when Fiji defeated the British Lions in 1977. He missed watching the match, but decided to take up rugby after seeing how happy the victory made the people of Fiji.

His family moved twice when he was a child, the second time settling in Suva where Serevi started secondary school. There he attended Lelean Memorial School. His schooling was unsuccessful however, and he failed his Fiji Junior Certificate Examination (tenth year) in 1984. Serevi blamed his love for rugby, saying he &quot;played too much and didn&#x27;t spend enough time studying.&quot;

After failing his examinations, Serevi quit school and continued to play for his local club Rewa. Although he trained with the team, he was omitted from playing as the coach, Jo Rauto, thought he was too small and would get hurt. He was eventually selected to play for the senior provincial side when he was 17. Several months later he was asked to join the Nabua Rugby Club – under the guidance of coach Ratu Kitione Tuibua – by his uncle Vesito Rauluni. Serevi&#x27;s Nabua team were highly successful in Fiji&#x27;s sevens tournaments.

== Fifteens career ==

=== Club ===
Prior to 1993 he played for the Nasinu Rugby Club in the Suva Club Rugby Competition, and represented Suva on numerous occasions. In 1993 Serevi signed for the Mitsubishi team from Kyoto, Japan. His initial salary was A$70,000 a year before this increased to A$90,000 a year. While with Mitsubishi in 1994, Serevi was approached by Australian Rugby League clubs the Canberra Raiders, and later the Brisbane Crushers to play for them. After being set to join the Crushers, Serevi decided to stay with Mitsubishi due to a pay rise, and pressure from Fiji&#x27;s Methodist Church to continue playing rugby union.

Serevi continued to play for Mitsubishi until 1997 when he joined English club Leicester on a two-year contract. He was first approached by Leicester after he played against them for a World XV at Twickenham in 1996. He stayed at Leicester for only one season before moving to the French club Stade Montois in Mont-de-Marsan.

After joining Stade Montois, Serevi moved to the coaching staff due to the second level sides only being allowed to play two non-European Union players. After getting clearance from the French Rugby Federation, Serevi was cleared to play for the club in 2001. He continued there until joining Stade Bordelais in January 2004. In late 2004 Serevi joined London club Staines; making his debut in a victory against Thurrock in December that year. Serevi stopped playing professional club rugby in 2005.

=== International ===
In 1987 Serevi was selected for the Fiji B team, and the following year he was selected for Fiji, playing against Wellington in New Zealand. The Wellington game was his first in front of a large crowd, and he had mixed feelings about making his debut in front of a huge crowd. The next year he made his Test debut against Belgium in Liege.

After being a regular selection for Fiji in 1989, and playing three games in 1990, Serevi was selected in the 1991 Rugby World Cup squad. He played against France and Canada, losing both games. He only played four fifteen-aside games for Fiji in 1992 and 1993 – with Fiji losing all four. These results led to Fiji failing to qualify for the 1995 Rugby World Cup in South Africa. In 1996 Serevi was selected for his first Fiji game since 1993. The match was against Northland in Whangārei, and resulted in a 49–18 win; Serevi&#x27;s first win with the national team since 1991. He was selected for seven games in 1996, including matches against South Africa and the New Zealand Māori.

Serevi did not play for Fiji in the 1997 season, but did come on against Scotland in Fiji&#x27;s 51–26 win at Suva in 1998. He was continually selected throughout 1998, and played Tests against France, US, Australia, Tonga and Samoa. The following year he again played for Fiji; including consecutive wins over Spain, Uruguay, and Italy. Fiji qualified for the 1999 Rugby World Cup in France, with Serevi playing in three of Fiji&#x27;s matches – including wins over Namibia and Canada.

Following the 1999 Rugby World Cup, Serevi did not play for Fiji again until 2001. In that year he came on against an Italian regional XV after 57 minutes and scored two tries, two conversions and two penalties to help his team to a 33–23 victory. This was followed by a match against Italy where he scored all of Fiji&#x27;s points (Fiji lost 10–66). He played two more matches for Fiji that season, including a win over the French Barbarians, in which Serevi was captain.

In 2002 Serevi played four matches for Fiji – all were losses; first against Wales, then Ireland, Scotland A, and Scotland. Serevi&#x27;s last season for Fiji was in 2003, where he played several matches in build-up to the Rugby World Cup in Australia. These matches included wins over the Queensland Reds, Marlborough, and Chile. His last match for Fiji was a 41–13 win over Japan in the 2003 Rugby World Cup; his third Rugby World Cup tournament.

== Sevens career ==

=== 1989–93 ===
After playing domestics sevens in Fiji, Serevi was selected for Fiji for the Sydney Sevens tournament in 1989. Later that year he made his début at the Hong Kong Sevens. Although New Zealand won the tournament, beating Fiji in their semi-final, Serevi was named player of the tournament. Serevi returned in 1990 when Fiji won their first of three consecutive Hong Kong Sevens titles, and he again picked up player of the tournament after Fiji defeated New Zealand in the final. In 1992 Serevi was again named the player of the tournament.

At the 1993 Hong Kong Sevens, Serevi scored three tries to help Fiji to a 17–14 win over Australia in the semi-final, but was unable to prevent his team being defeated 14–12 in the final by Samoa. Fiji&#x27;s next major tournament was the inaugural 1993 Rugby Sevens World Cup held in Edinburgh, Scotland. Serevi said that the team was working &quot;sometimes nine hours a day&quot; in preparation for the Sevens World Cup. Fiji were defeated by eventual champions England 21–7 in their semi-final. Serevi was the equal top point scorer for the tournament.

=== 1994–99 ===
After playing in sevens tournaments in Fiji and Canberra, Serevi returned to the Hong Kong Sevens. After defeating South Africa in their quarter-final, Fiji lost to eventual winners New Zealand in their semi-final. In 1995, Serevi captained Fiji to the Hong Kong Sevens final. He scored three tries in their semi-final victory over Australia. They then faced New Zealand in the final, and although leading 17–14 at one point, eventually lost the game 35–17. In the 1996 tournament, Fiji again met New Zealand in the final; New Zealand led after Serevi tripped Christian Cullen close to Fiji&#x27;s try line. This was followed by a break from Serevi to give Setareki Naivaluwaqa a try. New Zealand scored twice more however, to give them a 19–17 victory. Serevi finished the year by leading Fiji to victory in the Dubai Sevens.

The following year the Hong Kong Sevens doubled as the 1997 Rugby Sevens World Cup. Serevi was Fiji&#x27;s captain for the tournament. Before the tournament Serevi made a promise to Fiji to &quot;bring back the Melrose Cup.&quot; In his first three games of the tournament Serevi scored 59 points to help confirm Fiji as favourites for the title. Fiji did not concede a point until their semi-final, their sixth game of the tournament, and eventually faced South Africa in the final. South Africa scored two tries, before Fiji responded with four tries of their own; the final score was 24–21 to Fiji. Serevi was the tournament&#x27;s top scorer with 117 points – including nine tries. He also played for Fiji in the Japan and France sevens; the latter won by Fiji.

After winning the Fiji Sevens Tournament with Fiji in March 1998, Serevi led his country at Hong Kong. Despite a 21–21 draw against Argentina in pool play – where Serevi scored one try and set up two – Fiji qualified for the tournament&#x27;s quarter-finals. Fiji beat Australia in the quarter-finals, and faced New Zealand in their semi-final. They defeated New Zealand 24–7 after Serevi scored one try and set up another two. Fiji faced Samoa in the final, defeating them 28–19. Serevi was named player of the tournament. Later that year he led Fiji in the Rugby Sevens at the 1998 Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur. The team faced New Zealand in the final, losing 21–12, to earn them the silver medal.

=== 1999–04 ===
Serevi started 1999 by winning the Air Pacific Sevens in Fiji; they defeated Australian Fijians 35–7. Following this Serevi captained Fiji to the Hong Kong Sevens, his eleventh tournament. Fiji defeated Tonga – whose defeat included a try set up by a 40-metre one handed pass from Serevi – and then Scotland. Fiji and Serevi again faced New Zealand in the final; Fiji scored three tries, all converted by Serevi, to win 21–12. Serevi dedicated the win to his two daughters.

In 1999 the inaugural International Rugby Board Sevens series was held starting with the Dubai tournament. Serevi missed this leg, but finished the year by leading Fiji to victory in the South Africa Sevens in Stellenbosch. Serevi then returned for the leg in Mar Del Plata where he scored a try to lead Fiji to victory over New Zealand in the final. He then led Fiji in their first sevens tournament in New Zealand, at Wellington. Fiji again defeated New Zealand in a tournament final, this time 24–14. Serevi was the tournaments top points scorer (84 points). Serevi also played in the Fiji Sevens tournament, where Fiji lost to New Zealand 31–5 in the final. He then led Fiji to victory in the Brisbane leg of the series. Fiji made the final after defeating South Africa in their semi-final; the final was against Australia, who were leading until the last minute of the match. With less than a minute to go Serevi broke several Australian tackles and sprinted 80 metres to score a try and win the match for Fiji. The try was described at the time by Australian rugby union writer Spiro Zavos as &quot;the greatest individual try in sevens series history&quot;, and was voted try of the year at the 2000 Fiji Rugby Awards. At the Hong Kong Sevens, Serevi was the tournament&#x27;s top scorer with 75 points, but this was not enough for a Fiji win however, as they lost 31–5 to New Zealand in the final. Serevi&#x27;s last tournament of the series was in Japan where he led Fiji to victory.

Serevi started 2001 by leading Fiji in the 2001 Rugby World Cup Sevens in Argentina. Fiji were defeated by Australia in their semi-final; the Australians went on to lose to New Zealand in the final. In the 2000–01 IRB Sevens World Series, he played in only the London and Wales legs. He also missed the 2001 Hong Kong Sevens, the first time he had missed the tournament in 12 years. Serevi was omitted from the team due to form, and the desire to develop new players for the 2004 Rugby World Cup Sevens. Fiji&#x27;s coach at the time, Tomasi Cama, suggested Serevi had lost some pace and age was catching up with him. Serevi&#x27;s last sevens tournament for the year was the World Games in Akita, Japan. As captain, he led Fiji to the Gold medal after defeating Australia 35–19 in the final.

The first tournament of 2002 for Serevi was in Chile. Fiji advanced to the semi-finals where they faced New Zealand. During the match, Serevi was tackled late by New Zealander Amasio Valence. Fijian player Marika Vunibaka ran 50 metres to punch Valence and a brawl then erupted – Fiji ended up losing the game. Serevi and Fiji rebounded the following week to win the tournament at Mar del Plata, Buenos Aires. Serevi played in the Brisbane, Wellington, and then Beijing Sevens before returning to Hong Kong. In Fiji&#x27;s defeat of Australia in their quarter-final, Serevi scored 13 points to take his Hong Kong points tally over 1000. Fiji defeated New Zealand in their semi-final and faced England in the final. England defeated Fiji 33–20 in the final. Later that year Serevi captained Fiji to the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester. He helped get the team to the games&#x27; final with a try-saving tackle during Fiji&#x27;s 17–7 defeat of South Africa in their semi-final. The final was against New Zealand, and despite Serevi landing a penalty to give Fiji a 15–14 lead with two minutes left, New Zealand won 33–17. This gave Serevi his second Commonwealth Games silver medal.

Serevi did not represent Fiji in sevens in 2003, being controversially omitted from Fiji&#x27;s Hong Kong Sevens squad. Serevi had been unable to return to Fiji for a fitness test and national tournament due to commitments with his club Stade Montois in France. Because of this, he was omitted from the team, despite being available to play in the tournament.

After recovering from his injury, Serevi was named in the Fiji sevens squad in January 2004. This was despite a rule enforced by coach Senivalati Laulau that to be eligible to play, one must attend the team&#x27;s trials. After being named in the training squad, Serevi was not selected for the squad for the Wellington or Los Angeles legs of the IRB World Sevens Series. He then missed selection for the team to play in Hong Kong for the second year in a row. Pauliasi Tabulutu replaced Laulau as Fiji&#x27;s coach and recalled Serevi to play in the Bordeaux Sevens. Serevi then played in the London leg of the Sevens Series – his last leg of the year.

=== 2005–07: player-coach ===
Serevi started the year by leading the Lomaiviti Barbarians in the Pacific 7s in Auckland, New Zealand. He returned to Fiji, from his club Staines in England, in February that year in an attempt to play for Fiji in the 2005 Rugby World Cup Sevens. On returning to Fiji, Serevi said &quot;My goal is to go to the World Cup&quot;. After being selected by coach Wayne Pivac for the Fiji squad, Serevi was named as captain.

Led by Serevi, Fiji qualified for the quarter-finals of the Sevens World Cup at Hong Kong, with pool victories over Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, Japan and Portugal. After the pool matches, Pivac said of Serevi; &quot;Waisale is the eyes for the other guys&quot; and &quot;he brings the others into the game and puts players into gaps.&quot; After scoring the match-winning try in sudden death against England in their semi-final, Serevi led Fiji to World Cup victory over New Zealand in the final. He finished the tournament as the World Cup&#x27;s all-time leading points scorer and goal scorer, and the second highest all-time try scorer.

A national holiday – 24 March 2005 – was declared in Fiji for the teams return, and the country&#x27;s Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase declared:

Serevi was appointed Pivac&#x27;s successor as Fiji coach on 30 March, and soon after he returned to his village in Qarani to show its people the Melrose Cup.

Serevi&#x27;s first tournament as coach was the Singapore leg of the IRB Sevens Series; Fiji was defeated by England in their semi-final. The last two legs of the 2004–05 IRB Sevens Series were played in London and Paris. There he coached Fiji to the Plate victory, and a final loss respectively. His first major trophy as coach came when Fiji won gold in the 2005 World Games in Germany.

For the entire 2005–06 IRB Sevens Series Serevi was Fiji&#x27;s player-coach (his assistant coach was Jo Savou). Fiji won the George leg in South Africa, the Wellington leg in New Zealand, the Singapore leg, and the London leg in England. The team also made the final of the Dubai, Los Angeles, and Hong Kong legs of the series. Fiji won the Series – becoming the first team other than New Zealand to do so. Following the series win Prime Minister Qarase said of Serevi:

In Fiji, celebrations of the win even included a specially composed song dedicated to Serevi named &quot;Na Noda Laione&quot;.

As well as coaching Fiji to the IRB Series win in 2006, Serevi also coached them to bronze at the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne. There Fiji faced England in their semi-final, but Serevi was unable to take the field due to &quot;a technical hitch with the fourth official.&quot; After losing to England, Fiji recovered to defeat Australia 24–17 in the play-off for bronze.

In December 2006 Serevi was offered a coaching position with the Falcons, a South African side. The offer was several times more than he received from the Fiji Rugby Union. The contract required him to be a backline coach and player for two years, and then a coach for the next three years. In the end he decided to instead renew his contract with the Fiji Rugby Union. In early 2007 the interim Sports Minister Lekh Ram Vayeshnoi appointed Serevi to the board of the interim Fiji Sports Council.

Serevi coached Fiji to the final of the first Sevens Series leg of 2007 in Wellington, where they lost to Samoa 17–14 in the final. The team then rebounded when they defeated Samoa to win the San Diego leg. Fiji&#x27;s next tournament was Hong Kong where Serevi made a world record 18th appearance. He scored the final try as Fiji defeated New Zealand in Hong Kong. They then faced Samoa in the final; Samoa led 27–0 at half time. Although Fiji then scored 22 points in the second half, Samoa won the final 27–22. Fiji won the following tournament at Adelaide, but only after a converted try by Serevi forcing extra time in their quarter final with South Africa.

Serevi then coached Fiji to the final of the London leg, where they were defeated by New Zealand. The final leg of the 2006–07 Series was in Edinburgh. Fiji needed to qualify for the semi-finals to guarantee they would win the series. They qualified top of pool A and faced Wales in their quarter-final. Wales defeated Fiji in 21–14 in a major upset. &quot;Wales kept the ball well against us, and they scored tries. They deserved to win,&quot; Serevi said of the loss. New Zealand then won the tournament, making them the series champions after accumulating 130 points to Fiji&#x27;s 128. On 6 July 2007, Serevi announced his resignation as coach of the national sevens team.

=== 2007–09: Coach ===
On 23 July 2008, the Fiji Rugby Union announced the return of Serevi as Fiji&#x27;s coach for the 2008–09 IRB World Sevens Series and the Rugby Sevens World Cup in Dubai. At the time of the announcement, Serevi was in England receiving an honorary sports degree from Leeds Metropolitan University. Fiji Rugby Union chairman Keni Dakuidreketi denied that Serevi&#x27;s selection was a result of the public clamour after the team&#x27;s performance in the 2007–08 World Sevens Series under coach Jo Savou.

Despite his return, Serevi&#x27;s team did not do well in the first two legs of the 2008–09 World Sevens Series, losing their semi-finals in both to South Africa. He also clashed with the Fiji Rugby Union over being left out of player selection duties. As a result, he was dismissed on 29 January 2009. Iliesa Tanivula took over the post for the rest of the series.

In August 2009, the Papua New Guinea Rugby Football Union (PNGRFU) hired Serevi to become their sevens development officer on a five-year contract. He was later appointed the national sevens coach. However, on 27 March 2010, the PNGRFU confirmed that the working relationship with Serevi was finished. Union president Richard Sapias said off-field decisions prompted the severing of relations, especially after Papua New Guinea performed poorly at the Adelaide sevens.

===2010–present===
Seeking a fresh start a few months after his departure from the Papua New Guinea team, Serevi moved his family to the United States and settled in Seattle, Washington, to run a business with Fijian expatriates. He used his experience in rugby to open a new brand, the Serevi Rugby Nation, to help pool funds for Pacific Islander players and also run rugby training workshops for the youth. He also worked with the Old Puget Sound Rugby club, and helped Central Washington University qualify for the Collegiate Rugby Championships. He returned in May 2013 to Fiji as a trainer at the London sevens and became assistant coach under Alivereti Dere for the 2013 Rugby World Cup Sevens in Russia.

During his sevens career, Serevi made numerous guest appearances around the world including the 3 Rifles (army) sevens tournament at Dreghorn military barracks, Edinburgh. During this tournament, Serevi was famously red carded and sent to the bench due to violent conduct after clothes lining Edinburgh Northern RFC player Rory &quot;Pain Train&quot; Legge, who attempted an audacious chip and run.

== Personal life ==
Serevi married his wife, Karalaini, in 1993. They have three children; daughters Unaisi Serevi (born 1994) and Asinate Serevi (Naruma) (born 1995), and son Waisale Serevi Junior (born 2000). His wife previously worked for the Fijian Defence Forces but retired in 1998 to fully devote herself to her family and her husband&#x27;s rugby career. Serevi spent large parts of his career away from his family. He was apart from them when in Japan between 1992 and 1997, although his family joined him in France between 1999 and 2004. He is a committed Christian, and along with his family attends Church regularly. On his boots, strapping, and jersey for every match Serevi has the words &quot;Philippians 4:13&quot; written. It is a reference to the biblical quote &quot;I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me&quot;.

Serevi learned Japanese while in Japan, and also taught English whilst there. Despite living in France for several years he did not learn French, and required an interpreter for interviews. Serevi&#x27;s interests include listening to music, and watching movies. Apart from rugby, he also likes to play touch rugby and volleyball. Other interests include meeting people, and travelling the world.

On 18 May 2007, Serevi was appointed a Special Inspector with the Fiji Police Force by the acting Commissioner of Police Romanu Tikotikoca. The appointment is in youth and community policing. Serevi will not be a regular officer, but will be paid for the hours he works.

== Achievements ==
Serevi has been inducted into the Fiji Association of Sports and National Olympic Committee&#x27;s Hall of Fame in 2005, and was named the &quot;Fiji Times&quot; 2005 Personality of the Year. In 2013, he was inducted into the IRB Hall of Fame – the first Fijian to receive the honour. His presentation took place at the Hong Kong Sevens tournament that year. At the time of Serevi&#x27;s induction, Chairman Bernard Lapasset said:
=== XVs ===

<text>Parc Omega is a safari park in Notre-Dame-de-Bonsecours, Quebec, Canada (just north of Montebello). Along a nature route are lakes, meadows, small valleys, forests, and rocky hills. It is home to many wildlife species including beaver, elk, raccoon, timber wolf, coyote, muskox, whitetail deer, mule deer, yellow bellied marmot, turtle, boar, red fox, Alpine ibex, caribou, black bear, wolverine, moose, wild turkey, cougar, canadian lynx, bobcat, eastern mole, american badger, american antelope and bison. During the summer there are shows featuring birds of prey especially bald eagles. The site also has a restaurant with a panoramic view, a gift shop with Indigenous crafts, a woodstove-heated yurt, and a small outdoor stage for performances. The park is open daily, year round. 

The park is a drive-through experience, meaning visitors stay in their cars and drive at a slow speed through the park on a winding trail. They also offer three walking trails, playgrounds and picnic areas. The park runs two low-power FM radios stations that provide guidance and direction, in English and French. The complete experience takes about two to three hours.

Bags of carrots can be purchased at the visitors center at the start of the tour; these are fed to &quot;safe&quot; animals (elk, deer, etc.) throughout the tour, which come up to a visitor&#x27;s car for treats.

<text>Terne plate is a form of tinplate: a thin steel sheet coated with an alloy of lead and tin. The terne alloy was in the ratio of 10-20% tin and the remainder lead. The low tin content made it cheaper than other tinplates.

Terne plate was used for tinsmithed sheet metal goods, such as storage vessels, jugs and funnels, particularly for industrial use with flammable liquids. Unlike tinplate, it was not used for long-term storage or around food items, owing to the high lead content. Terne plate has also been used for roofing, as a cheaper alternative to zinc or lead.

Until 2012 lead had been replaced with the metal zinc and was used in the ratio of 50% tin and 50% zinc. This alloy had a low melting point of approximately but is no longer available. Today terne-coated metal is coated with 99.9% tin, instead of hot-dipping, a more consistent galvanic deposition process is applied. Additionally the substrate has been changed from steel to stainless steel, benefitting from the corrosion resistance of stainless steel alloys. The pure tin alloy makes soldering easier, as the melting point is homogenised and doesn&#x27;t need to match the melting point of two metals with different melting temperatures.

==Use==

Terne was historically used to coat sheet steel to inhibit corrosion. It was one of the cheapest alloys suitable for this, and the tin content was kept at a minimum while still adhering to a hot-dipped iron sheet, to minimize the cost.

Historical terne metal must be painted. Terne metal can last 90 years or more if the paint is maintained. Terne-coated stainless steel (TCS II or Roofinox), or copper is commonly used to replace terne metal roofs as either material will outlast terne metal. Terne-coated stainless steel roofing can last 100 years or more unpainted; copper roofing can last 50 years or more unpainted.

Terne II used zinc in place of lead for environmental reasons. Today&#x27;s aesthetic behavior is the main reason and benefit of the tin coating. Tin develops a natural matte grey patina when exposed to the elements. The result of the weathering process depends on the environment and climate conditions present. Depending on the environment and atmospheric conditions different substrate alloys are used. The stainless steel alloy 439 is ferritic and is used for normal environments; for coastal applications, the austenitic stainless steel alloy 316L is used providing an increased corrosion resistance to chlorides.

==Terminology==
The term &quot;terne&quot; is derived from the French word for &quot;dull&quot; and was probably in reference to its dull appearance in comparison to the shiny surface of tinplate.

Terne-coated steel is also known as terne-metal and often referred to as &quot;tin&quot; (see the &quot;Slate Roof Bible&quot;). Traditional terne-coated steel cannot be purchased anymore; it has been replaced by a terne-coated stainless steel product (Roofinox tin-plated (Terne)), available at most roofing supply stores.

<doc id="761349" wikidata="Q1004222" url="?curid=761349" title="Bulldog Drummond">
<text>Hugh &quot;Bulldog&quot; Drummond is a fictional character, created by H. C. McNeile and published under his pen name &quot;Sapper&quot;. Following McNeile&#x27;s death in 1937, the novels were continued by Gerard Fairlie. Drummond is a First World War veteran who, fed up with his sedate lifestyle, advertises looking for excitement, and becomes a gentleman adventurer. The character has appeared in novels, short stories, on the stage, in films, on radio and television, and in graphic novels.

After an unsuccessful one-off appearance as a policeman in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot;, the character was reworked by McNeile into a gentleman adventurer for his 1920 novel &quot;Bulldog Drummond&quot;. McNeile went on to write ten Drummond novels, four short stories, four stage plays and a screenplay before his death in 1937. The stories were continued by his friend Gerard Fairlie between 1938 and 1954.

Drummond is a First World War veteran, brutalised by his experiences in the trenches and bored with his post-war lifestyle. He publishes an advertisement looking for adventure, and soon finds himself embroiled in a series of exploits, many of which involve Carl Peterson—who becomes his nemesis—and Peterson&#x27;s mistress, the &quot;femme fatale&quot; Irma. After his first adventure, Drummond marries his client, Phyllis Benton. In later episodes, Benton becomes involved in Drummond&#x27;s exploits, often as the victim of kidnapping by Drummond&#x27;s enemies.

In 1921 an adaptation of the first novel was staged in London, with Gerald du Maurier playing the role of Drummond; the play was further adapted for the 1922 silent film &quot;Bulldog Drummond&quot;, with Carlyle Blackwell in the lead role. Several other Drummond films followed, either based on McNeile&#x27;s stories or with unique storylines.

==Fictional biography==

The Bulldog Drummond stories of H. C. McNeile follow Captain Hugh &quot;Bulldog&quot; Drummond, DSO, MC. Drummond is a member of &quot;the Breed&quot;, a class of Englishman who were patriotic, loyal and &quot;physically and morally intrepid&quot;. Drummond is a wealthy gentleman, formerly an officer in the fictional &quot;Royal Loamshire Regiment&quot;, who, after the First World War, spends his new-found leisure time looking for adventure. McNeile first wrote the Drummond character as a detective for a short story in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot;, but the portrayal was not successful and was changed for the novel &quot;Bull-dog Drummond&quot;, which was a thriller. The character was an amalgam of McNeile&#x27;s friend Gerard Fairlie, and his idea of an English gentleman, although writer J.D. Bourn disputes Fairlie&#x27;s claim to be a model for the character, noting that &quot;he was still at school when Sapper created his ... hero&quot;. Drummond also had roots in the literary characters Sherlock Holmes, Sexton Blake, Richard Hannay and The Scarlet Pimpernel.
Drummond&#x27;s wartime experience had given him a series of abilities akin to that of a hunter: stealth—&quot;he could move over ground without a single blade of grass rustling&quot;—and the ability to incapacitate others—&quot;he could kill a man with his bare hands in a second&quot;. During his time on the Western Front he would take himself on solitary raids through no man&#x27;s land. Drummond was also proficient in jujutsu and boxing, was a crack shot, played cricket for the Free Foresters, and was an excellent poker player. In addition to Drummond&#x27;s physical attributes is his common sense, which allows him to equal and beat his opponents, even if they have a superior intellect.

Drummond is characterised as large, very strong, physically unattractive and an &quot;apparently brainless hunk of a man&quot;, He is six feet tall, weighs around 14 stone, and has a &quot;cheerful type of ugliness which inspires immediate confidence in its owner&quot;. Throughout his exploits, Drummond is joined by several of his ex-army friends and colleagues, including Algy Longworth (who would appear in many of the films, as Drummond&#x27;s sidekick), MC; Toby Sinclair, VC; Peter Darrell and Ted Jerningham. Drummond&#x27;s ex-batman from his military days, James Denny, runs Drummond&#x27;s flat on Half-Moon Street in Mayfair, London, along with Mrs Denny. (Denny appeared as Drummond&#x27;s sidekick in the radio series, a version of the character named &quot;Tenny&quot; appeared in the films) Drummond is a gentleman with a private income; he is also construed as &quot;a brutalized ex-officer whose thirst for excitement is also an attempt to reenact the war&quot;, although the character was later described by Cecil Day-Lewis, author of gentleman detective Nigel Strangeways, as an &quot;unspeakable public school bully&quot;.

The novel &quot;Bulldog Drummond&quot; begins when Drummond places an advertisement in a newspaper looking for adventure to lift the ennui of his life in post-war London. The response comes from Phyllis Benton, who is concerned for the health and well-being of her father, over whom Henry Lakington and Carl Peterson have a hold. At the end of the novel Drummond and Phyllis marry, and remain married throughout the course of the McNeile and Fairlie series of books, in contrast to the films, which generally portray Drummond as unmarried. Phyllis becomes integral to the plot of some of the novels: she is kidnapped by Irma Peterson in several stories, including &quot;The Black Gang&quot; and &quot;The Female of the Species&quot;.

In the matter of his personal tastes, Drummond is a member of the fictional Junior Sports Club, a gentleman&#x27;s club on St. James&#x27;s Square, London. His preferred drink is beer although he also enjoys drinking martinis and is knowledgeable about wines. Drummond owns both a Rolls-Royce and a Bentley.

Although Drummond&#x27;s actions are intended to maintain the conservative status quo of Britain, academic Hans Bertens considers that instead, he comes across as &quot;a murderous exponent of a fierce competitive individualism&quot;.

===Carl and Irma Peterson===
The first four books deal with Drummond against Carl Peterson, who becomes Drummond&#x27;s arch-enemy. Peterson is also a master of disguise and uses several aliases. Peterson is killed in the fourth book, &quot;The Final Count&quot;, although Fairlie brings him back for his final novel, &quot;The Return of the Black Gang&quot;. Drummond forms a grudging respect for Peterson, and offers an honourable duel to the death at the end of &quot;The Third Round&quot;, instead of the usual summary justice that normally befalls members of Peterson&#x27;s gang. The writer Richard Usborne sees the mass-murdering terrorist Peterson as &quot;quite a sympathetic character. Almost, in fact, a hero&quot;, and wrote that &quot;authors ... fall in love with their big villains ... Sapper came to love Carl Peterson dearly, and so did Drummond&quot;.

The title of the fifth Drummond book, &quot;The Female of the Species&quot; refers to Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s line &quot;the female of the species is more deadly than the male&quot;. Irma is described by Jonathon Green as &quot;the slinky epitome of a twenties &#x27;vamp, and by Lawrence Treadwell as dark, sexy and from an oriental background, &quot;a true &quot;femme fatale&quot;&quot;. After Carl Peterson&#x27;s death in &quot;The Final Count&quot;, Irma swears revenge on Drummond and kidnaps his wife—whom he had met in &quot;Bulldog Drummond&quot;—with the intent of killing him in the ensuing chase. Irma Peterson appears in six of McNeile&#x27;s books, and in a further five by Fairlie.

==Works==
===Novels===

All were published through Hodder &amp; Stoughton.

Drummond has also appeared in other works. In 1983 Jack Smithers wrote the spoof &quot;Combined Forces&quot;, and in 1990 Kim Newman—under the name Jack Yeovil—wrote the short story &quot;Pitbull Brittan&quot;, which features Drummond.

===Short stories===
These short stories are all by McNeile, and are collected in the 1984 publication &quot; &#x27;Sapper&#x27; The Best Short Stories&quot; edited by Jack Adrian. 

===Stage===

McNeile and Gerald du Maurier adapted the first novel, for the stage; &quot;Bulldog Drummond&quot; was shown at Wyndham&#x27;s Theatre during the 1921–22 season. Du Maurier played the title role in a run of 428 performances. Du Maurier again played the role on 8 November 1932 in a special charity performance at the Royal Adelphi Theatre attended by King George V. The play also ran in New York during the same season, with A. E. Matthews as Drummond. McNeile also wrote &quot;The Way Out&quot;, which was staged at the Comedy Theatre, London in January 1930 with Ian Hunter as Drummond. A third Drummond play, &quot;Bulldog Drummond Hits Out&quot;, was co-written by McNeile and Fairlie. It went on a tour of the UK in 1937 with Henry Edwards as Drummond, and opened on 21 December 1937 at the Savoy Theatre, London, where it had a short run. Fairlie later turned the storyline into the novel &quot;Bulldog Drummond on Dartmoor&quot;, published in 1938.

In 1974 the play &quot;Bullshot Crummond&quot;, by Ron House, was staged with Alan Shearman as Crummond. The play was subsequently made into the 1983 film &quot;Bullshot&quot;.

===Film===


In 1933 Alfred Hitchcock was set to direct a Bulldog Drummond film with a screenplay by Charles Bennett entitled &quot;Bulldog Drummond&#x27;s Baby&quot;. The rights to the character of Drummond were then held by British International Pictures, who would not sell the rights to use the characters for Bennett&#x27;s screenplay. Bennett and Hitchcock turned the film into &quot;The Man Who Knew Too Much&quot; without Drummond.

=== Radio ===

A &quot;Bulldog Drummond&quot; radio series ran on the Mutual Broadcasting System from 13 April 1941 to 12 January 1949. An attempt was made at a revival between 3 January and 28 March 1954. Drummond was initially portrayed by George Coulouris, before being taken over by Santos Ortega and Ned Wever after 1942; Cedric Hardwicke took over in 1954.

=== Television ===
A 30-minute episode of &quot;Douglas Fairbanks Presents&quot; featured Drummond in &quot;The Ludlow Affair&quot;, first broadcast on UK television on 16 December 1956. Drummond was played by Robert Beatty; he was aided by Kelly, played by Michael Ripper. A 1973 BBC documentary &quot;Omnibus&quot;, &quot;The British Hero&quot;, featured Christopher Cazenove playing Drummond, as well as a number of other such heroic characters, including Richard Hannay, Beau Geste and James Bond.

===Graphic novels===
Adaptations of the first and fourth novels appeared in Super Detective Library #3 and #13 respectively. In 2004 Moonstone Books released a &quot;Bulldog Drummond&quot; comic book written by William Messner-Loebs and illustrated by Brett Barkley, while in &quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen: Black Dossier&quot;, written by Alan Moore and illustrated by Kevin O&#x27;Neill, a thinly disguised, elderly version of Drummond, called &quot;Hugo Drummond&quot;, is one of the three Secret Service agents tasked to hunt down the heroes of the piece.

==Reception==
The Drummond series proved popular with contemporary audiences, with &quot;Bulldog Drummond&quot; selling 396,302 copies between 1920 and 1939, exceeding the 100,000-copy benchmark for &quot;best-sellers&quot;. At his peak in the 1920s, McNeile was the highest-paid short-story writer in the world, and it was estimated that in the last five years of his life he was earning around £10,000 a year (approximately ); the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; estimated that during his writing career he had earned £85,000.

When reviewing &quot;Bulldog Drummond Strikes Back&quot; for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the critic observed that &quot;if you like a good knock-down-and-drag-out yarn with excitement and violence on nearly every page, you can&#x27;t go wrong on Bulldog Drummond&quot;; for the novel &quot;Bulldog Drummond at Bay&quot;, the reviewer considered that &quot;as a piece of fictional melodrama, the book is first rate&quot;. In the British market, &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot; also characterised McNeile as a mass-market thriller writer, which contrasted with its consideration of his earlier works.

Throughout the Drummond stories, much of the language used by McNeile&#x27;s characters relating to ethnic minorities or Jews is considered by the academic Joan DelFattore to be &quot;intensely conservative by modern standards&quot;; Green observes that while the characters of other contemporary writers, such as Agatha Christie, &quot;exhibit the inevitable xenophobia and anti-semitism of the period, McNeile&#x27;s go far beyond the &#x27;polite&#x27; norms&quot;. J.D. Bourn considers his language to be &quot;rather distasteful&quot;, while the academic Michael Denning observed that &quot;Drummond is a bundle of chauvinisms, hating Jews, Germans, and most other foreigners&quot;. The author and publisher Ion Trewin comments that for the readers of the 1920s and &#x27;30s, McNeile was seen at the time as &quot;simply an upstanding Tory who spoke for many of his countrymen&quot;.

==Influence==
Drummond later became a model for other literary characters created in the 1940s and 1950s: W. E. Johns used McNeile&#x27;s work as a model for his character Biggles, while Ian Fleming stated that James Bond was &quot;Sapper from the waist up and Mickey Spillane below&quot;.

<text>Dog Park is a 1998 romantic comedy film written and directed by Bruce McCulloch. It is an American and Canadian co-production.

==Plot==
Andy writes the local newspaper classified advertisements and has been going from relationship to relationship since eighth grade. He loses custody of his dog when his girlfriend, Cheryl, breaks up with him for another man—a punk rocker named Trevor.

Andy then meets Lorna, a children&#x27;s TV show host, but she is too obsessed with her own dog. She&#x27;s also still emotionally fragile because her boyfriend was Trevor, who left her for Andy&#x27;s ex, Cheryl. Andy meets her in a bar and takes her home as she seems interested. They begin making out, but it stops there as she throws up.

Knowing Lorna works for the TV station, Andy sends her roses and a note requesting a relationship and even calls, but she decides not to pursue. He moves on by putting himself in a dating auction. Lorna spends some time alone and finally goes out on a date with the clerk from the video store, Callum. It&#x27;s not much of date, but he helps her out in a big way with the message he leaves on her machine.

Andy gets involved with the woman who won him in the auction, Kieran, a vegan nutritionist, who believes a lot of sex is beneficial. Meanwhile, Cheryl and Andy take their dog to a psychiatrist, who tells them that her having rough sex near the dog is traumatizing it.

While both Andy and Cheryl do their best to share custody, problems arise as Cheryl and Trevor break up and she unsuccessfully tries to win Andy back. On a double date, Keiran figures out Jeri&#x27;s boyfriend Jeff is having an affair observing his body language on the phone.

When Rachel goes to the obedience school graduation to see Jeff&#x27;s dogs get their diplomas, one of the dogs runs to Rachel and Jeri deduces the affair. They break up. Andy goes to her side to console her.

Both Andy and Lorna have feelings for each other, but aren&#x27;t sure how to follow through with it. Andy dating Kieran and Lorna having a date with Callum help them come to a very important conclusion. They meet up at the bar where they first met 100 days later... and start a relationship.

==Cast==
==Reception==
On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 36% based on 25 reviews. On Metacritic it has a score of 46% score, based on 14 reviews. 
Mick LaSalle from San Francisco Chronicle wrote: &quot;Dog Park is clever and pleasant and holds interest. Janeane Garofalo is restrained as a cynical and sensitive magazine editor, and Bruce McCulloch, who wrote the script and directed the picture, plays her boyfriend. McCulloch has mostly written himself out of the movie. He gives himself a couple of strong moments but otherwise keeps his focus where it belongs, on Wilson.&quot; Ken Fox from TV Guide gave the movie three out of five stars. Lisa Schwarzbaum from Entertainment Weekly gave it a B− grade and wrote: &quot;No disrespect is meant by saying that this shambling romantic comedy, written and directed by &quot;Kids in the Hall&quot; alum Bruce McCulloch, clings to a sensibility that’s imperviously, uncompromisingly Canadian. The pace, the punchlines, and the characters of Dog Park all land just a little north of target, even though the notion that canine playgrounds make good pickup grounds for humans would appear to be an imperviously, uncompromisingly L.A. idea.&quot; Leonard Maltin called the film &quot;Howling bad... with unlikeable leads and meandering sub-plots&quot;. Like most viewers, he did enjoy Mark McKinney as the dog therapist.

<text>The Canadian Museum of Contemporary Photography (CMCP) ( (MCPC)) was a gallery of Canadian contemporary art and documentary photography. Founded in 1985 and affiliated to the National Gallery of Canada (NGC), it was housed at the National Gallery of Canada, located at 380 Sussex Drive, Ottawa.

The CMCP did not have a permanent home until it moved to its purpose-built site at 1 Rideau Canal in 1992. The Pavilion entrance building, which was opened on May 7, 1992, was originally proposed by architect Michael Lundhom, who adapted an old railway tunnel running alongside the Chateau Laurier. The museum ultimately was designed and executed by architects Rysavy Rysavy. The glass and concrete entrance from the street, reminiscent of the colonnade leading into the National Gallery, lead patrons down to the main part of the museum which was located below street level.

Its founding director and chief curator was Martha Langford, who held those positions from 1985 until 1994.

In 2009 it was announced that the CMCP, which had been closed temporarily in 2006, would be permanently closed. Its collections and program of exhibitions were absorbed by the National Gallery of Canada. In 2016, the CMCP&#x27;s photographic collection was folded into the newly created Canadian Photography Institute (CPI).

== Collection ==

The foundation of the CMCP&#x27;s collection were a selection of photographs from the Still Photography Division of the National Film Board of Canada. By 2005, it held about 160,000 photographic works including works by Canadian artists such as Kelly Wood.

== Closure ==

On March 29, 2009 it was announced that the CMCP, which had been closed temporarily in 2006 due to a leak, would be permanently closed for conversion to committee rooms. Its collections and program of exhibitions have since been absorbed by the National Gallery of Canada. A campaign to maintain the CMCP at its purpose-built site was unsuccessful. The exhibitions are now showcased at the National Gallery of Canada. As of 2016, the CMCP&#x27;s photographic collection has been folded into the newly created Canadian Photography Institute (CPI).

==Affiliations==
The Museum was affiliated with: National Gallery of Canada, CMA, CHIN, and Virtual Museum of Canada.

<text>The Centre for Geography and Exploration, located at 50 Sussex Drive in Ottawa, is headquarters to the Royal Canadian Geographical Society (RCGS) and home to &quot;Canadian Geographic&quot; magazine, as well as Can Geo Education and special project departments. 

The Canada and the World Pavilion was a small museum in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. Exhibits were devoted to Canada&#x27;s contribution to sport, arts and culture, development, peacekeeping, and science. Interactive exhibits, activities, and special events were held at the facility and in the surrounding parkland.

With views to the north, the building overlooks the Rideau Falls and Ottawa River. It is the next-door neighbour to the Embassy of France at 42 Sussex Drive.

== The history ==
Less than 1.5 kilometres southwest of the Rideau Falls on the Ottawa River, 50 Sussex Drive was the home to historic gatherings of Algonquin people. Indigenous families came to the delta where the Riviere Gatineau meets the Ottawa River to hunt game, pick berries, fish and trade. 

In 2000, the Canada and the World Pavilion was built as part of the National Film Board of Canada&#x27;s exhibition. After several years of mediocre attendance, the facility closed in the fall of 2005. 

In October 2016, the RCGS and the National Capital Commission announced the vacant building would be transformed into Canada&#x27;s Centre for Geography and Exploration.

50 Sussex was identified by the National Capital Commission as one of ten &quot;Confederation Pavilions&quot; in the National Capital Region as part of events celebrating Canada&#x27;s sesquicentennial in 2017. 

The refurbished facility opened in two stages - for exhibits in 2017 and then fully in 2018.

In May 2018, The RGCS and Canadian Geographic magazine moved in to the new permanent home at 50 Sussex Drive. One year after move-in, RCGS officially unveiled a plaque declaring Canada&#x27;s Centre for Geography and Exploration the official home of the Society.

== Famous visitors ==
Jeopardy&#x27;s Alex Trebek, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Jane Goodall, Michael Palin, Wade Davis and Roberta Bondar are famous people who have spent time in the facility. 

== In the building now ==
Two galleries fill the main and upper floors. Exhibits have included one on the NCC&#x27;s 50-year plan for Ottawa, the debut of &quot;Thirteen Moons&quot; by Alex Janvier and exploration exhibits relating to the Inuit of the Canadian Arctic. The main gallery contains the first Google Earth Wall in Canada - a three metre high screen that allows users to view and engage with geographical and social issues. Exhibit spaces are also used for private events including meetings, symposiums and weddings, operating under the &#x27;50 Sussex Drive&#x27; brand for bookings.

Another feature of 50 Sussex Drive is the Alex Trebek Theatre. The space has 280 seats and hosts lectures by geographers, explorers, photographers and educators, as well as the Can Geo Talks events. Film screenings and Can Geo Education events are also held in the theatre.

<text>The Canadian Dance Festival is an annual Ottawa, Ontario event founded in 1987. Held in June, it sets the stage for Canada&#x27;s most contemporary, innovative and leading edge dance choreographers and dance companies. The festival includes events at the National Arts Centre, as well as featured performances at other locations including the National Gallery of Canada and outdoor dance in Ottawa city parks and other Urban settings. It attracts international dance promoters and international media who attend the festival to follow the developments of Canadian dance and to select artists for their respective festivals and dance series.

The signature activity of the Canada Dance Festival Society, it brings together over 250 artists from across the country to participate in a 9-day event, promoting contemporary Canadian Dance. The festival is a non-profit national organization that presents live dance performances by professional artists. Since 1997, the CDF has also produced a smaller event every other year to promote its ongoing presence and to further invest in the Ottawa community. Dance Advance started as a series of free performances featuring professional and pre-professional artists from the region.

<text>Abbey Wood is a National Rail station in Abbey Wood in southeast London, England. It is between and stations on the North Kent Line. It is measured from , with services to central London routed via Greenwich or Lewisham, and Elizabeth line services to and via and . The station is managed by Transport for London with passenger services provided by Southeastern, Thameslink and the Elizabeth line. It is the closest railway station to the suburb of Thamesmead, which is connected to the station by local buses. The station platforms are located in the Royal Borough of Greenwich with the station entrance in the London Borough of Bexley.

==History==

It was opened on 30 July 1849 by the South Eastern Railway, whose operations were handed over to the South Eastern and Chatham Railway in 1899. It became part of the Southern Railway under the grouping of 1923. The line then passed on to the Southern Region of British Railways on nationalisation in 1948. When BR was divided into sectors in the 1980s the station was served by Network SouthEast until the privatisation of British Railways.

During the 1860s William Morris famously used a decorated wagon to commute between this station and his new home at Red House, Bexleyheath, occasionally with his eccentric and artistic house guests.

The ticket office at Abbey Wood was APTIS-equipped by November 1986, making it one of the first stations with the ticketing system which was eventually found across the UK at all staffed British Rail stations by the end of the 1980s.

The station was to be served by the proposed Greenwich Waterfront Transit, however the project was cancelled by Mayor of London Boris Johnson owing to lack of funds.

=== Elizabeth line ===

Abbey Wood is the terminus of one of two eastern branches of the Elizabeth line and offers interchange between terminating Elizabeth line services (at 12 trains per hour on new line) and existing Southeastern and Thameslink services.

The Elizabeth line provides a link north west to ExCeL London and Canary Wharf, then onwards to the city centre, Heathrow Airport and Reading.

==Station buildings==

The first station opened with the line in 1849 and was a typical South Eastern Railway brick building with metal platform shelters.

The station has been rebuilt twice over the past 50 years to cater for the changing nature of the area. In 1987 a new station was constructed which, in 2014, was replaced by Network Rail with an interim station whilst the new Crossrail station was constructed. The new station opened on 23 October 2017. It was designed by architects Fereday Pollard and includes step free interchange between platforms and bus connections with the Harrow Manorway, a dual carriageway which runs next to the ticket hall.

==Connections==
Various London Buses routes, including night route N1, serve the station.

==Future==

=== London Overground ===
An extension of the London Overground Gospel Oak to Barking line from Barking across the river to Thamesmead and Abbey Wood was proposed in August 2015. The section from Barking to Barking Riverside opened in summer 2022, but there are no current plans to extend the line further towards Abbey Wood. Rather than this, in 2019 Transport for London and City Hall proposed an extension of the Docklands Light Railway (DLR) to serve Thamesmead as part of the proposed Thamesmead and Abbey Wood OAPF (Opportunity Area Planning Framework). A DLR extension was chosen due to lower connectivity benefits of an Overground extension, the low frequency (4 trains an hour) of the Gospel Oak to Barking line, and — most significantly — a construction cost twice as much as the DLR, as the gradients required to cross the River Thames would require large scale tunnelling works when compared to the DLR. Despite making this recommendation, the consultation also noted that an extension of the Gospel Oak to Barking line could provide good orbital transport links in the long term.

=== Elizabeth line ===
As of 2021, there were proposals to extend some Elizabeth Line services further east to Gravesend and Hoo Junction; the route is safeguarded and would use one of the two terminating tracks at Abbey Wood and onto either existing National Rail tracks (upgraded for 25 kV AC overhead line electrification) or a separate 4-track line. Another proposal is continuing Elizabeth line services to along existing tracks, although those lines are congested and may delay the Elizabeth line services.

<doc id="761370" wikidata="Q61869" url="?curid=761370" title="Gottfried Heinrich Graf zu Pappenheim">
<text>Gottfried Heinrich [[Graf]] zu Pappenheim (29 May 1594 – 17 November 1632) was a German field marshal of the Holy Roman Empire in the Thirty Years&#x27; War. A supporter of the Catholic League, he was mortally wounded during the Battle of Lützen fighting the Protestant forces under Swedish king Gustavus Adolphus.

==Biography==
Pappenheim was born in the little town of Treuchtlingen, a secondary seat of his family, the ruling Lords of Pappenheim on the Altmühl in Bavaria, a free lordship of the empire &quot;(see: Pappenheim (state))&quot;, from which the ancient family to which he belonged derived its name. He was the second son of Veit zu Pappenheim, Lord of Treuchtlingen and Schwindegg, and his second wife Maria Salome von Preysing-Kopfsburg. He was educated at Altdorf and Tübingen, and subsequently traveled in southern and central Europe, mastering the various languages, and seeking knightly adventures. His stay in these countries led him eventually to adopt the Roman Catholic faith in 1614, to which he devoted the rest of his life. At the outbreak of the great war he abandoned the legal and diplomatic career on which he had embarked, and in his zeal for the faith took service in Poland. The experience gained serving in the Polish army (especially in the way of fighting cavalry) was to his advantage in fighting on the side of the Catholic League.

He soon became a lieutenant-colonel, and displayed great courage and ability at the battle of the White Mountain near Prague (8 November 1620), where he was left for dead on the field. In the following year he fought against Ernst, Graf von Mansfeld in western Germany, and, in 1622, became colonel of a regiment of cuirassiers. In 1623, as an ardent friend of Spain, the ally of his sovereign and the champion of his faith, he raised troops for the Italian war and served with the Spaniards in Lombardy and the Grisons. It was his long and heroic defence of the post of Riva on the Lake Mezzola which first brought him conspicuously to the front. In 1626, Maximilian I of Bavaria, the head of the League, recalled him to Germany and entrusted him with the suppression of a peasant rebellion which had broken out in Upper Austria. Pappenheim swiftly carried out his task, encountering a most desperate resistance, but always successful; and in a few weeks he had crushed the rebellion with ruthless severity (i.e. Gmunden, Vöcklabruck and Wolfsegg, 15–30 November 1626).

After this he served with Tilly against Christian IV of Denmark, and besieged and took Wolfenbüttel. His hopes of obtaining the sovereignty and possessions of the evicted prince of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel were, after a long intrigue, definitively disappointed. In 1628 he was made a count of the empire. The siege and storm of Magdeburg followed, and Pappenheim, like Tilly, has been accused of the most savage cruelty in this massacre. So much could not be said of his tactics at the battle of Breitenfeld, the loss of which was not a little due to the impetuous cavalry general, who was never so happy as when leading a great charge of horse. The retreat of the imperialists from the lost field he covered, however, with care and skill, and subsequently he won great glory by his operations on the lower Rhine and the Weser in rear of the victorious army of Gustavus Adolphus. Much-needed reinforcements for the king of Sweden were constantly detained by Pappenheim&#x27;s small and newly raised force in the northwest.

His operations were far-ranging and his restless activity dominated the country from Stade to Kassel, and from Hildesheim to Maastricht. Being now a field marshal in the imperial service, he was recalled to join Wallenstein, and assisted the generalissimo in Saxony against the Swedes; but, was again despatched towards Cologne and the lower Rhine. In his absence a great battle became imminent, and Pappenheim was hurriedly recalled. He appeared with his horsemen in the midst of the battle of Lützen (16 November 1632, 6 November 1632 on Swedish reckoning). His furious attack was for the moment successful. As Rupert at Marston Moor sought Cromwell as his worthiest opponent, so now Pappenheim sought Gustavus. At about the same time as the king was killed, Pappenheim received a mortal wound in another part of the field. He died later the same day or early the next morning en route to Leipzig, where his body was embalmed at the Pleissenburg fortress.

==Legacy==
* The form of rapier called the Pappenheimer, is reportedly named after him.
* In Polish military terminology, &quot;pappenheimer&quot; refers to a type of helmet worn by heavy cavalry during the Thirty Years&#x27; War.
* In German the phrase &quot;I know my Pappenheimer&quot; (Ich kenne meine Pappenheimer) referring to a person acting as expected in a negative sense. Originating from Schillers Wallenstein plays, though there meant in positive way. In Dutch the expression retains its positive meaning, though it can also be used ironically.
* A drinking song honouring &quot;General Pappenheimer&quot; is sung by student associations around Europe.

After the 1995 world cup, Tuilagi turned professional for the Halifax Rugby League team, making 57 Super League appearances for them in two years, scoring an impressive 26 tries. In 1999, he joined St Helens. Tuilagi played for St. Helens at in their 1999 Super League Grand Final victory over Bradford Bulls. Having won the 1999 Championship, St. Helens contested in the 2000 World Club Challenge against National Rugby League Premiers the Melbourne Storm, with Tuilagi playing from the interchange bench in the loss. He also played for St Helens from the interchange bench, scoring a try in their 2000 Super League Grand Final victory over Wigan Warriors. He&#x27;d made 35 appearances, scoring eleven tries.

He left St. Helens in June 2000 and signed for Leicester Tigers, also making his return to the Samoa national side. He toured with them in the summer of 2002. He was also selected to tour New Zealand, but was prevented from doing so by an injury, which also denied him a place in national side&#x27;s world cup squad. Tuilagi started the victorious 2002 Heineken Cup Final for Leicester. In the 2003–4 season his younger brother Henry also signed for Leicester, and his younger brother Alesana joined the following season. In 2004–5 season Tuilagi signed for Cardiff Blues. Unfortunately injury limited the number of times he was able to play for Cardiff and was released early. In 2005–6 season Tuilagi played for Castres Olympique in the French Top 14.

<text>Johannes Abezier ( 1375 – 1424), most usually known as Johann Abezier, was a Roman Catholic religious and political leader of the Teutonic Knights. Abezier was provost of Frauenburg in Warmia (1411), and afterward the Prince-Bishop of Warmia (1418).

==Life==
Abezier was born in Thorn, (now Toruń) within the monastic state of the Teutonic Knights. Abezier studied Canon Law in the University of Prague since 1394. In the University of Bologna he attained his magister, becoming &quot;Doctor Decretorum&quot; (1405). He then continued his studies at the University of Vienna. In 1408 he participated in the preparations of the Council of Pisa. Ever, Johannes Abezier was consulted for legal advice, by the successive Grand Masters of the Teutonic Knights.

In 1411, Grand Master Heinrich von Plauen appointed Johannes Abezier as their &quot;Procurator General&quot;. In that same year, Abezier became provost in the cathedral of Frauenburg (Frombork). In 1414, he participated in a mission to Ofen (now Buda) where King Sigismund was trying to settle the disputes between the state of the Teutonic Knights, and the kingdom of Poland and the grand duchy of Lithuania, after the decisive Battle of Grunwald (1410). By then, Abezier occasionally acted as &quot;Auditor Rotae&quot; of the Teutonic Knights too. Also in 1414, Johannes Abezier was appointed by the new Grand Master Michael Küchmeister, to travel to the Council of Constance beside the archbishop of Riga, Johann von Wallenrodt, who also was superordinate over Warmia (Ermland). On 13 October 1415, Abezier participated once more in a mission to settle conflicts between the order and Poland, this time in Wileny. He also participated in other diplomatic negotiations, even from Heilsberg years later.

After finishing his duties at Constance, in the summer of 1418 Abezier was formally enthroned as the see of the Prince-Bishopric of Warmia—whose seat was at Heilsberg—, as Prince-Bishop over this territory. His election of 1415 had been unanimous. By then, the territory had been left much destroyed, by the war between both nations. Abezier remained at Heilsberg as the bishop of Ermland, until his death, on February 11, 1424.

<text>The Canada Agriculture and Food Museum () is a national agricultural museum in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. Occupying several buildings within the Central Experimental Farm, the museum operates as a &quot;working farm&quot;, and provides public programs and exhibitions on agriculture sciences, and on the history of agriculture in Canada. In addition to the exhibitions held on the grounds, the museum also organizes travelling exhibitions for other museums across the country.

The museum&#x27;s collection originated from a museum established at the Central Experimental Farm in 1920, although a national agriculture museum was not opened by the federal government until October 1983, as the Agriculture Museum. Initially occupying only a dairy barn, the museum later expanded to include several other buildings on the Central Experimental Farm. The museum was renamed the Canada Agriculture Museum in May 2000, before it adopted its current name in May 2013.

==History==
The collection of the Canada Agriculture and Food Museum originated from the museum operated at the Central Experimental Farm in 1920. Maintenance of the collection was later taken up by the National Museums of Canada (NMC), although some items from the collection were transferred to the Canadian Museum of Civilization, or the National Museum of Science and Technology. 

In 1978, exploratory discussions took place regarding the feasibility of creating an agricultural museum within one of the heritage buildings of the Central Experimental Farm. In 1980, the upper floor of the dairy barn was selected to host an exhibition gallery for the collection. A memorandum was signed between Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada and NMC, where the former agreed to provide the facility, and renovate its upper levels to the requirements expected by the NMC; while the NMC agreed to operate the museum. The agricultural collection maintained by the NMC formed the nucleus for the agriculture museum&#x27;s collection. Public Works Canada completed their renovations of the site in August 1983, with the NMC installing the museum&#x27;s first two exhibitions, &quot;Haying in Canada,&quot; and &quot;A Barn of the Twenties;&quot; the former an exhibition of farm equipment from 1840 to 1960, and the latter an immersive exhibit of a barn in the 1920s. The museum was formally opened on 12 October 1983 as the Agriculture Museum. Since opening the museum&#x27;s operations has expanded beyond the dairy barn; with the museum operating seven buildings for public and administrative purposes.

The museum was initially operated by the NMC until it was dissolved in 1988. Management of the museum was later assumed by Ingenium, a crown corporation. The museum has since changed its name twice in the 21st century, first to the Canada Agriculture Museum in May 2000, and the Canada Agriculture and Food Museum in May 2013.

==Grounds==

The museum property is situated within the Central Experimental Farm, a research centre for Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, a department of the government of Canada. The museum occupies a number of buildings on the Central Experimental Farm, although all the buildings operated by the museum remain under the ownership of Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada.

The main building for the museum, the &quot;Dairy Barn&quot;, or &quot;Building 88,&quot; is a three-storey barn with a gable roof and two side wings. The building is made out of stone, wood shingles, and batten. Originally built in 1887–88, the building was later rebuilt in 1913, after a fire destroyed the original structure. Because of the buildings historical association with dairy farm research, the footprint of the building was designated as a Federal Heritage Building in 1987. The building houses the museum&#x27;s exhibition spaces, as well as its dairy herd.

Other buildings operated by the museum includes the &quot;Swine Showcase Building&quot; or &quot;Building 91&quot;. Built in 1911 and renovated during the 1930s, Building 91 was used to test swine until it was repurposed for museum use. Several other buildings on the property are also used by the museum as event spaces, including the &quot;Meadowview Barn/Building 95&quot; and the &quot;Cereal Barn/Building 76&quot;. The Meadowview Barn was erected in 1912 to support dairy research, and is used by the museum to host special events and summer camps. The Cereal Barn is also used by the museum as an event space.

==Operations==

The museum is operated by Ingenium, a crown corporation responsible for preserving and protecting Canada&#x27;s scientific and technical heritage. In addition to the Canada Agriculture and Food Museum, Ingenium also manages two other national museums of Canada, the Canada Aviation and Space Museum, and the Canada Science and Technology Museum. 

Canada Agriculture and Food Museum provides programs and exhibitions on the history of agriculture in Canada, as well as the benefits and relationship with agricultural sciences. Situated within the Central Experimental Farm, the Canada Agriculture and Food Museum operates as a &quot;working farm&quot;, with 150 farm animals available at the demonstration farm, including a herd of 50-head dairy herd, as well as horses, beef cattle, pigs, goats, poultry and sheep. In addition to exhibitions on the history of agriculture, the museum also holds a historical collection of tractors. The museum is affiliated with the Canadian Museums Association, the Canadian Heritage Information Network, and the Virtual Museum of Canada.

The museum also creates traveling exhibits which are brought to smaller museums throughout Canada. It has an outdoor &quot;energy park&quot; which showcases renewable energy sources. In addition to museum exhibits and other public programs, the museum also provides facility rentals for special events, and live demonstrations.

<text>The Ottawa Dragon Boat Festival is an annual festival of dragon boat races in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. Begun in 1994, the festival attracts 5,500 paddlers, 200 teams and over 75,000 spectators from all around the world. It is one of the largest dragon boat festivals in North America. The event is held in Mooney&#x27;s Bay, where the Rideau River and Rideau Canal split. Mooney&#x27;s Bay is where many of the Ottawa-based teams train, using the Rideau Canoe Club facilities. The festival was most recently held in 2019. The 2020 and 2021 festivals were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 2022 saw the return of the festival but the number of participants was less than pre pandemic years.

In 1998, the Charity Cup Challenge was added as a fundraising component for the Ottawa Dragon Boat Foundation. Founded in 2004 as a way to raise funds for local charities. The challenge has raised over in support of 41 charities. The festival has also initiated a number of eco-friendly projects, making it both the first carbon-neutral festival in North America and the first Ecologo-certified festival in the world.

==Races==
Races take place over the Saturday and Sunday with teams divided into three categories, Mixed, Women and Open. They may involve 16-20 paddlers, one drummer, one steersperson and up to six spares. Teams race a minimum of two 500m races on Saturday and the top 75 mixed, 32 women&#x27;s and eight open teams will advance to Sunday where they will compete in three additional - 100m, 200m and 500m races.

==Festival events==
The Ottawa Dragon Boat Festival is part of a larger Chinese cultural tradition that goes back 2,400 years. It began on the life-sustaining riverbanks in the valleys of southern China as a fertility rite performed to ensure bountiful crops. The first participants held their celebration on the fifth day of the lunar month of the Chinese calendar. The race was held to avert misfortune and encourage the rains needed for prosperity. The object of their worship was the dragon.

Cultural and heritage performers are featured at the festival and are included prominently during the opening and closing festivities. Select performances are designed to honour the traditions and cultural roots of dragon boating as well as the cultural diversity that makes up the National Capital Region. 

=== Opening Ceremony ===
The Opening Ceremony is presented on the Friday of each Festival weekend with cultural tourist attractions like the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Pipe and Drum band. The Parade of Champions is similar in concept to the Olympics&#x27; Parade of Nations. Numerous dignitaries attend including the Mayor of Ottawa. Other special guests include CTV Ottawa media personalities and other prominent members of the Ottawa community. Past performers include The Success Lion Dance Troupe, which celebrates a 3000-year-old tradition that symbolizes prosperity, luck and happiness, and The Oto-Wa Taiko Japanese drummers.

=== Eye Dotting ===
An essential dragon boat tradition, the eye dotting ceremony consists of painting the eyes onto a dragon head to awaken it from sleep and symbolizes the start of the festival.

=== Entertainment ===
Each year, the festival provides a series of free concerts with a focus on showcasing talent local to the Ottawa region and Canada. Notable acts have included Sam Roberts, Broken Social Scene, Matt Mays and The Sheepdogs. The festival also has strolling performers, food vendors, artisans, exhibitors and cultural performances.

<text>The Peel Art Gallery, Museum and Archives (PAMA) is a museum, art gallery, and archives for the Regional Municipality of Peel and are located in Brampton, Ontario, Canada. Previously, it was the Peel Heritage Complex. Its facilities were originally the Peel County Courthouse, Brampton Jail (also known as the Peel County Gaol), a land registry office, and a county administration building. It is opposite Gage Park and Brampton City Hall.

In March 2010, the Peel Heritage Complex closed for extensive renovations and expansion. The spaces reopened in 2012, with significantly larger and include more public space. It was originally scheduled to reopen in fall 2011. The facility rebranded as Peel Art Gallery, Museums and Archives.

==History==

The first attempts to create a historical society were apparently in the early 20th century; the issue went nowhere. For many years, the William Perkins Bull collection of art and artifacts was housed in the Brampton High School. In the 1950s, the Board of the school decided to renovate and redecorate, and asked the collection be removed. Bull Collection publisher C. V. Charters, Everett Briggs, Alex McKinney and other citizens moved to create a historical society, focused on life in Peel County from the late 18th century to the 1930s. There was an apparent disinterest in heritage, during the immediate post-War era, and the Peel County Historical Society Association became inactive in 1957.

In February 1961, interested citizens met in the basement of the Carnegie Library to discuss reorganization; Mrs. Carroll was elected president. Association chairman Don Featherstone and a committee (which included Russell Cooper) met in March 1961, to establish a constitution. The County Council of Peel allowed the organization use of the basement of the old Registry Office on Wellington, for its meetings. Regular meetings began in 1962, and included an address by &quot;Mr. Colucci&quot;, designer of the Black Creek Pioneer Village in north Toronto.

With aid of the Women&#x27;s Institutes of Snelgrove and Cheltenham, an art exhibition was held in an old school house, on the 3rd Line, in the west half of Chinguacousy. Meant to raise funds for the creation of a museum and art gallery, it featured artworks by prominent local artists, and items from the Bull Collection. A temporary home for the collection was found in 1963, at the Credit Valley Conservation Authority offices. Thousands attended the weekend exhibits, but the structure wasn&#x27;t winterproof. Thomas H. B. Symons, &quot;custodian&quot; of the Bull Collection, was enlisted later on that year.

In 1963, the organization became an affiliate of the Ontario Historical Society oncemore, and displayed during the fall at the International Ploughing Match, held in Caledon by Colonel Conn Smythe. The society tried to gain access to Hawthorne Lodge, the original home of the Bull family, on what is now Kennedy Road. Enlisted to help was the founding President of Trent University, Thomas H. B. Symons, who is the &quot;custodian&quot; of the Bull Collection. Funds were not then available, but Symons provided various rural artifacts from Peel, some of which have been restored and displayed.

Peel County Council passed a 1966 resolution, stating that the Registry Office be vacated by county employees, and be available for the society to set up a museum.

The official opening took place November 17, 1968, featuring professional designed exhibits and displays, &quot;a very fine variation from the more frequently encountered county museums&quot;, according to a 1973 text on the Society. Museum displays focused on the rural past and technical present of the area. The gallery&#x27;s initial exhibit was of a Brampton watercolourist and an Alton sculptor.

In 1984, the Region of Peel took over the facility. Architect Carlos Ventin of The Ventin Group was hired to design a renovation of the Peel County Jail and Peel County Registry Office, including a connecting building.

The architecture won awards for The Ventin Group at the 1986 City of Brampton Award of Excellence, Development Design Awards and at 1987 Ontario Renews Award from the Ministry of Housing for Non-residential Renovation (Public Sector).

Noting the abundance of pioneer-era exhibits at Ontario museums, curator Bill Barber aimed to feature historical topics like the Great Depression. The approach drew criticism from some patrons, who lived through the era. A show themed to Christmas around the world eventually was reformatted to include other festivals at that time of the year, and another exhibit looked at Ukrainian Christianity around the world.

Attendance grew from 6000 in 1985, to 18000 in 1987, and 24000 in 1989.

==Buildings==

Toronto-based Goldsmith Borgal and Company Ltd. Architects designed PAMA&#x27;s 2010-2012 renovations.

===Tunnel===

The two sets of buildings are connected by an 82-metre-long tunnel, with two skylights. One enters within the art gallery building (1958), the tunnel passes partially under the 1867 Peel County Courthouse, and into a 1986 link structure, joining the 1867 Peel County Jail and the 1890s registry office. A late addition to development plans, it required significant underpinning of the buildings, including the jail courtyard walls. To construct the tunnel, items such as a geothermal ground source system were forced to reschedule.

The tunnel was built by the project&#x27;s general contractor, Dixon Construction, and designed by Ojdrovic Engineering.

==Sections==

===Museum===
The museum collection of the Peel Heritage Complex comprises approximately 12,000 artefacts representing the history of Peel from 4000 BCE to the 21st century. Highlights of the collection include objects associated with the Avro Canada CF-105 Arrow aircraft and its design, a collection of over 360 pieces of 19th century stoneware, and a large textile collection that includes locally made quilts and over 18,000 pieces of clothing.

The Peel Heritage Complex presents a variety of exhibitions with historical and cultural significance to the Peel community. In the Region of Peel Museum, visitors can travel from early Aboriginal settlements through the Jet Age, all within the walls of an historic Jail building. Artifacts, archival documents, interactive elements and hands-on activities tell “The Peel Story”. Upon their 2011 reopening, the museum will have increased exhibition space.

The Brain Cell allowed for hands-on learning exhibits; this room will be renamed in the new museum.

Recent exhibitions of the permanent collection include &quot;All Dressed Up With Somewhere To Go&quot; (clothing, 2009–2010), &quot;Arctic Zoo&quot; (Inuit art, 2007–2009), and &quot;Connections&quot;, two exhibits held in coordination with Canadians and Their Pasts CURA (Community University Research Alliance), featuring items the community is keeping for future generations of their family.

===Archives===

Primarily, the Region of Peel Archives collection includes municipal documents for the Region of Peel, City of Brampton, City of Mississauga, and Town of Caledon, and the former County of Peel. Also includes records from the former townships: Albion, Caledon, Chinguacousy, Toronto Gore and Toronto. Included are by-laws, minutes, planning documents, land records, assessment and collectors rolls, committee records, etc.

Beyond these municipal documents, the archives collects documentary material related to the history of Peel, and the individuals and groups that have helped in developing the community. Major photography collections include newspaper photographer Russell K. Cooper, commercial photographers Cecil Chinn and Cecil Henry, the Luker family collection, and glass negative collections from Robertson Matthews, the Brampton portrait studio, and the McLeod family.

The Region of Peel Archives also houses the records of various organizations, including the Bruce Trail Conservancy.

The reading room offers microfilm of family history files from the William Perkins Bull collection, select area newspapers, land records, census records from 1851/52-1911, Peel County Wills and Surrogate Court records, the &quot;Tweedsmuir histories&quot; of the local Women&#x27;s Institutes, et cetera. Various genealogical publications, such as family histories, newspaper indexes, cemetery transcriptions as well as a selection of local history books are available.

===Art Gallery===

The permanent collection, including over 4000 contemporary and historic works, is the largest such public collection in the region. Since opening in 1968, the art gallery has exhibited local, national, and international artists, both contemporary and historical from their permanent collection.

====Permanent collection====
The gallery&#x27;s collection originally was focused on artists of local residence and art of local subject matter. The earliest exhibits were of watercolourist George Chauvignaud, a painter from Peel in the 1920s and 1930s, as well as a show of Brampton-born printmaker Caroline Armington, based on a donation by Caroline Crawford.

In more recent decades, the collection has expanded to include several hundred works, from throughout the development of 20th century abstraction in Canada. The selection includes works by early movements, such as Les Automatistes and Painters Eleven, and contemporary figures in non-objective painting, such as David Urban and Ric Evans. Other artists noted in gallery materials include Harold Town, Jack Bush, Claude Tousignant, Guido Molinari, Ron Martin, Chris Cran, William Ronald, John Meredith, and Ronald Bloore; the final three in the list were once Brampton residents.

The collection includes various major works by national-level artists, designated with the Canadian Cultural Property status.

Artists mentioned in publicity for the gallery include John Anderson, Caroline Armington, Frank Armington, John Armstrong, Carl Beam, George Broomfield, Alex Cameron, Chuck Close, Tom Dean, Mary Dignam, Leonard J. Hutchinson, Tom LaPierre, Doris McCarthy, David Milne, Robert Motherwell, Will Ogilvie, Stephanie Rayner, Jim Reid, Jack Shadbolt, Michael Snow, Stanley Spencer, Tom Stone, Andy Warhol, and Joyce Weiland. A Tom Thomson sketchbook is included in the collection.

====Exhibitions====

Recent exhibitions include:
* &quot;Painted In Peel: The Peel Landscape by the Group of Seven and Their Contemporaries&quot;, featuring works from the permanent collection, and those of the McMichael Canadian Art Collection, the Art Gallery of Ontario (2004)
* Site-specific exterior projection work &quot;Wyn Geleynse: The Peel Projection&quot;, by installation artist Wyn Geleynse (November and December 2009);

In the 1970s, the gallery created a juried art show, attracting entries from across Ontario, there is no word whether or not the show will return. The gallery also has the &quot;Peel Artists Series&quot;, featuring local and regional artists.

===Education and outreach===
School programming is available at the museum and gallery, and at the schools themselves. Seniors programs, which go out to old-age facilities, feature broader history and art-related topics, not necessarily focused around Peel. In 2009, the education program had almost eleven thousand students, and almost six thousand seniors.

==Etc.==

===Collections===
The Peel Heritage Complex collects a wide variety of objects including: 19th and early 20th century artifacts from everyday tools and gadgets to wedding dresses, archaeological artifacts, historic and contemporary works of art, including paintings, drawings and sculpture, and archival documents such as photographs, government records, and maps. Staff is assisted by volunteers who perform inventory and cataloguing tasks.

Most of the artifacts in the collections were donated by Peel residents. These collections are used for exhibitions, programs and research by staff, volunteers and visitors. Each potential donation to the Complex is approved by a committee of experts drawn from various heritage backgrounds.

===Exhibitions===
In the Art Gallery of Peel approximately eight exhibitions are featured annually, showcasing artists of Regional, provincial and national stature. Each spring, the Gallery&#x27;s Annual Juried Show, the longest running adjudicated exhibition in the area, attracts artists from throughout Peel and Southern Ontario.

===Education===
Visitors to the Heritage Complex will also be treated to interactive displays, hands-on activities, and learning opportunities throughout the building.

Numerous special events during the year also provide a great opportunity for the community to learn more about the Complex and the history of Peel through the artifacts, documents and artwork in the Complex&#x27;s collections. Join us for Heritage Day in February, Museum Day in May, Kidsummer in July, and Family Day in November.

<text>The Canadian Ski Marathon is a ski tour. It is held annually just north of the Ottawa River between the regions of Montreal and Ottawa, capital of Canada, in February and usually covers a distance of . However, it is a ski tour, not a race: participants challenge not each other, but themselves by choosing a level of difficulty and trying to accomplish that goal.

==Ski marathon==
The Marathon, which has been running since Canada&#x27;s Centennial year of 1967, is the longest in the world. It consists of 10 sections of varying lengths and difficulties which can either be skied together over the two days (five stages per day), or individually on subsequent days.

The earliest iterations of the marathon started in Lachute with the second day ending in Gatineau. After about 25 years the pattern was changed such that, in even-numbered years participants skied eastward toward from the a start in Buckingham (a district of Gatineau); odd numbered years saw participants travel in the opposite direction. For the 2018, 2019 and 2020 editions, the Marathon starts in Arundel, Quebec, just south of Mont-Tremblant and ends in Lachute. In 2021 and 2022 the Canadian ski marathon (CSM) was held virtually, with anyone recording two consecutive cross country gps trails of 50 and 60 km earning an award. In 2023, the CSM started in Arundel, Quebec and ended in Buckingham.

In all cases, the end of the first day of the Marathon has participants ending in (or near as is the case of certain skier classes) the scenic town of Montebello, Quebec, where they resume their proper course the following day.

The new trail, called the &quot;Northern Trail&quot;, offers better snow cover and less road skiing, according to the organizing committee. The &quot;Western Trail&quot; (Buckingham-Montebello) may be reused in future editions.

The two-day event is open to anyone of any age or ability, but the course is extremely challenging in places, which skiers of lesser ability tend to avoid by choosing easier sections to tackle. Of note is the section west of the Lac Carling resort, which is known throughout the Marathon as the most difficult section.

There are two broad categories of skier: &quot;Coureur des Bois&quot; (who start out before dawn to ski the entire distance; named after the coureur des bois) and Tourer (who start out at 8 a.m. to ski any number of the 10 sections). The Coureur des Bois category, in turn, is broken down into Bronze (ski the whole trail), Silver (ski the whole trail with a pack), and Gold (ski the whole trail with a pack and camp out overnight). Tourers are able to ski as individuals, or as teams. A new feature of the marathon is the &quot;mini-CSM&quot; or &quot;Taster&quot; which allows participants to ski two sections of the trail over the weekend, one per day.

Traditionally, the hardest goal is the Gold &quot;Coureur des Bois&quot; category. Also, one may register for skiing at the Gold level only after completing the Silver and Bronze levels in previous years. Doing the Gold five times—over any number of years—results in that person earning a permanent bib, meaning that they are given a number that is then retired from the list of bib numbers. As of 2012, 300 Coureur des Bois skiers—primarily men, and a much smaller number of women—have earned permanent bibs by earning 5 Golds: 1 Gold Award and 4 Gold Bars.

The marathon has hundreds of volunteers who brave the cold to help skiers the entire weekend at checkpoints, providing safety + sweeps, waxing services, trail work, awards, and administration. These volunteers include members of local service organizations such as Scouting and Guiding, community groups, and cadets. Major logistical support is provided by 33 Signals Regiment of the Canadian forces, who provide vital safety and water points along the trail, and if needed provide traffic control.

Plumstead is on the North Kent Line and was opened 10 years after the line opened on 16 July 1859. The platforms are below road level: the gabled station buildings stand on an overbridge at the country end. At this point, there are sidings: the station used to be where the railway system operating within the Royal Arsenal joined the main line.

There were plans for the Docklands Light Railway to be extended to Plumstead Railway Station. However, Woolwich Arsenal station was chosen instead.

The station is served by local bus routes 53, 96, 99, 122, 177, 180, 244, 301, 380, 422, 469, 472, 672 &amp; N1.

The station is located at the western end of the Ridgeway pedestrian and cycle path.

Plans are currently being drawn up for the installation of lifts and other accessibility improvements to the station as part of the UK Department of Transport&#x27;s Access for All Programme.

<doc id="761387" wikidata="Q3357759" url="?curid=761387" title="Ottawa Bluesfest">
<text>The Ottawa Bluesfest (currently known as [[Royal Bank of Canada|RBC]] Bluesfest under a naming rights sponsorship) is an annual outdoor music festival that takes place each July in downtown Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. While the festival&#x27;s lineup historically focused on blues music at its inception, it has increasingly showcased mainstream pop, hip hop, reggae, rock and EDM in recent years. Bluesfest has become the third largest music festival in Canada and the fourth largest music festival in North America.

There was a hiatus in 2020–21.

==Organization==
Since its inception, the festival has been managed by executive and artistic director Mark Monahan. The organization also manages CityFolk Festival (2011-) and the Ontario Festival of Small Halls.

In 2002, Cisco Ottawa Bluesfest won the Best Event Award from the Ottawa Tourism and Convention Authority and in 2003 the organization received the Keeping the Blues Alive (KBA) award for arts education from the Memphis Blues Foundation. Mark Monahan is a past recipient of the Toronto Blues Society&#x27;s Blues with a Feeling award. In December 2011, Bluesfest reached a five-year sponsorship deal with RBC Royal Bank to ensure its financial stability. Henceforth, the event will be known as RBC Bluesfest.

==History==

The festival was first held in 1994 at Majors Hill Park with the performance of Clarence Clemons, attracting a 15,000 spectators. The following year the festival attracted larger crowds with entertainers like John Hiatt and Buddy Guy. In 1996, 250,000 fans attended the 10-day Bluesfest to see Robert Cray, Los Lobos and others. It was then that the Mitel corporation became the first major sponsor of the event. In 1997, the festival was moved to Confederation Park to provide more space for the increasing number of fans to see musicians such as Dr. John and Little Feat. In 1998, over 800,000 people showed up for the festival in 10 days, which coincided with Canada Day. Bell Mobility and CIBC Wood Gundy joined the list of sponsors. In 1999, the festival was moved to LeBreton Flats. Bluesfest became a registered charitable organization while attracting over 950,000 fans in 10 days. The Royal Canadian Mint became a sponsor. Cisco Systems became the Bluesfest Title Sponsor in 2001, while the &quot;Ottawa Citizen&quot; and the &quot;National Post&quot; became Presenting Sponsors. In 2002, Cisco Ottawa Bluesfest moved to Festival Plaza in downtown Ottawa and 1,200,000 fans in 10 days.

In 2003, the festival expanded to eight stages to celebrate its tenth anniversary with 1,220,000 people in attendance. 2005 saw the festival further diversify its offerings, reaching out to a younger audience as well as those interested in more than just blues. The 2006 edition saw continued growth with increased crowds and the move of the MBNA stage to Lisgar Collegiate Institute to provide more capacity. In 2007, Cisco Ottawa Bluesfest relocated to LeBreton Flats Park, a move from the site at Festival Plaza the previous year. The new site offered five stages in and around the Canadian War Museum. The stage set-up featured twin main stages akin to the Austin City Limits Music Festival, which allowed audiences to transfer between headlining acts.

The festival continues to be held in July annually for 10 days. Headliners such as B. B. King and the Dixie Chicks (2013), Blake Shelton and Lady Gaga (2014), Kanye West (2015), Red Hot Chili Peppers (2016), and Foo Fighters (2018) attracting approximately 1,500,000 attendees each year.

Along with showcasing international musical talent, Bluesfest is a non-profit charitable organization with year-round music education initiatives such as Blues in the Schools, Be in the Band, and the Bluesfest School of Music and Art, augmenting a focus on developing local artists in the Ottawa region.

=== Accident ===
On July 17, 2011, just 20 minutes into Cheap Trick’s set, a thunderstorm blew through the festival area. The band and crew narrowly escaped the collapse of the stage&#x27;s 50-ton roof. It fell away from the audience and landed on the band&#x27;s truck which was parked alongside the back of the stage, breaking the fall and allowing everyone about 30 seconds to escape. Sandy Sanderson, Cheap Trick&#x27;s truck driver, was treated for a laceration to the abdomen and released from hospital the same day. An investigation by the Ministry of Labour concluded the stage was poorly constructed, and though the report recommended criminal charges, none were filed due to building codes for temporary structures not covering staging that lasted less than 30 days.

=== Nesting Killdeer ===
During preparations for the 2018 festival, a pair of killdeer was found nesting on some cobblestones, which help camouflage the eggs. It was right where the main stage was about to be constructed. Killdeer and their nesting grounds are protected under the Migratory Birds Convention Act. With permission from Environment and Climate Change Canada, and help from the Woodlands Wildlife Sanctuary, the nest was successfully moved 25 meters, one meter at a time, to a protected area behind the stage site, and stage construction was allowed to continue after a 12-hour delay. It marked a first for successful killdeer nest relocation.

== Setting ==

* The main RBC Stage on LeBreton Flats (Capacity of 90,000)

<doc id="761388" wikidata="Q7109177" url="?curid=761388" title="Ottawa Fringe Festival">
<text>The Ottawa Fringe Festival is an annual fringe theatre festival in Ottawa. The festival was inaugurated in 1997. The festival takes place for ten days each June. Performances are held indoors and out.

==Performance spaces==

Performances all take place in downtown Ottawa. Two of the regular stages are located at the University of Ottawa, including Studio Léonard-Beaulne and Academic Hall. Three others are located at Arts Court: Arts Court Theatre, Arts Court Library and Ottawa Dance Directive (ODD Box). The venues are all within walking distance of one another.

==Shows and attractions==
Throughout the festival, a courtyard is set up just outside Arts Court to provide refreshment and a location for mingling with the artists.

Most Fringe performances are plays, and most last an hour or less. Since 2009, a limited number of 90-minute spots have been available. The content of the plays varies since acceptance to the festival is by lottery, and the shows are not juried. Because Ottawa is a bilingual city, both English and French productions are presented at the Fringe, though a small number of productions in past years have been bilingual.

==Cost==
Each patron must purchase a $3 Fringe Pin, which grants entry for the duration of the festival. Most performances are ticketed events, and require the purchase of a ticket on top of the Fringe Pin. Visitors aren&#x27;t permitted entrance to ticketed performance unless they are wearing a Fringe Pin.

Tickets generally cost $12. For those attending multiple shows, discounted admission is available in the form of five- and ten-show passes, for $45 and $99 respectively. In keeping with the core mandate of the Canadian Association of Fringe Festivals, one hundred percent of the proceeds from ticket sales go to the performers.

==Performing at the Ottawa Fringe==
The Fringe seeks to minimize its impact on the artistic decisions of its performers. Thus the festival allocates its limited stage time by lottery, with a certain percentage put aside for local, Canadian, and international troupes. Each winning troupe will get to perform its show in the same venue at different times, from a little after noon to midnight, over several days. The rotation of time slots helps to even out the audience-dampening effects of performing late at night or when most people are at work.

Since anyone able to meet an application fee can apply to perform at the Fringe, and berths are awarded by lottery, the quality of the shows can vary widely.

The Ottawa Fringe has spawned at least one international success. Ottawa playwright and actor Pierre Brault&#x27;s one person show, &quot;Blood on the Moon,&quot; tells of the trial, (perhaps wrongful) conviction, and execution of Patrick J. Whelan for D&#x27;Arcy McGee&#x27;s murder. After its successful Fringe run, Brault performed &quot;Blood on the Moon&quot; at the National Arts Centre, toured the show across Canada, and even brought it to Ireland.

<text>The Canada Aviation and Space Museum () (formerly the Canada Aviation Museum (&quot;Musée de l&#x27;aviation du Canada&quot;) and National Aeronautical Collection (&quot;Collection aéronautique nationale&quot;)) is Canada&#x27;s national aviation history museum. The museum is located in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, at Ottawa/Rockcliffe Airport.

==History==






The museum was first formed in 1964 at RCAF Station Rockcliffe as the National Aeronautical Collection from the amalgamation of three separate existing collections. These included the National Aviation Museum at Uplands, which concentrated on early aviation and bush flying; the Canadian War Museum collection, which concentrated on military aircraft, and which included many war trophies, some dating back to World War One, and the RCAF Museum which focused on those aircraft operated by the Royal Canadian Air Force.
In 1982 the collection was renamed the National Aviation Museum and in 1988 the collection was moved to a new experimental type triangular hangar from the Second World War-era wooden hangars it had been residing in. In 2006 an additional hangar was opened, which allows all of the collection&#x27;s aircraft to be stored indoors.

The museum closed 2 September 2008 for remodeling and rearrangement of the aircraft on display. This project was completed and the museum reopened 19 November 2008. The changes made include making space for a new exhibition entitled &quot;Canadian Wings: A Remarkable Century of Flight&quot; that was unveiled on 23 February 2009, the centennial of the first heavier than air aircraft flight in Canada.

In December 2008, the museum announced that approval had been granted for a C$7M expansion to begin in May 2009 and to be completed by the fall of 2010. The improvements carried out included an addition of 2600 m2 (28,000 ft²) giving 18% more space and providing room for a new foyer, auditorium, cafeteria, retail space, a landscaped entrance and classrooms.

In April 2010, the parent Canada Science and Technology Museum Corporation announced that the museum would be expanded and that its name would be changed to the &quot;Canada Aviation and Space Museum&quot; in May 2010. The Canadian Press expressed concern that the name change would cause confusion with the existing Toronto-based Canadian Air and Space Museum.

==Organization==
The Canada Aviation and Space Museum is under the control of Ingenium, previously known as the Canadian Science and Technology Museums Corporation. Ingenium is an autonomous Crown corporation which works to preserve and protect Canada&#x27;s scientific and technical heritage. The corporation is responsible for three museums: the Canada Aviation and Space Museum, the Canada Agriculture Museum and the Canada Science and Technology Museum.

The museum is also home to 51 Canada Aviation Museum Squadron, Royal Canadian Air Cadets.

==Collection==
The museum&#x27;s collection contains a wide variety of civilian and military aircraft, representing the history of Canadian aviation from the pioneer era before the First World War up to the present day. Particularly noteworthy is the collection of vintage bushplanes from the 1920s to the 1940s. The military aircraft represent aircraft flown by Canadians in the First World War, Second World War, and the Cold War. The museum&#x27;s best known exhibit is the surviving components of the Avro Arrow interceptor from the late 1950s.

Also at the museum is Space Shuttle &quot;Endeavour&quot;″s Canadarm, the Space Shuttles&#x27; Canadian-built robotic arm. It was unveiled on 2 May 2013 with Chris Hadfield on hand from the International Space Station via video screen to aid with the unveiling. While &quot;Endeavour&quot;″s Canadarm, officially known as Canadarm 201, was moved back to Canada, &quot;Atlantis&#x27;s&quot; and &quot;Discovery&#x27;s&quot; Canadarms went to the museums of their respective Shuttles.

Also on site are interactive activities on the science of flight, films, demonstrations, a boutique, and guided tours.

A few of the tours take the visitors &quot;behind the scenes&quot; to see conservation and restoration work in progress, and components which are in storage.

<doc id="761390" wikidata="Q2346534" url="?curid=761390" title="Assault of Abner Louima">
<text>Abner Louima (born November 24, 1966) is a Haitian American man who, in 1997, was physically attacked, brutalized, and raped by officers of the New York City Police Department (NYPD) after he was arrested outside a Brooklyn nightclub. His injuries were so severe that he required three major surgeries. 

Officers responsible for the attack were charged and convicted in federal court; Justin Volpe was sentenced to 30 years in prison with no possibility of parole, although he was released from his sentence early in 2023. In 2001, Louima received a settlement (equivalent to about $ million in ) in his civil suit against the city for police brutality, the largest civil settlement at that time for such abuse. He has set up the Abner Louima Foundation to establish a hospital and community centers in Haiti, Florida, and New York for Haitian residents, immigrants, and others in need.

==Background==
Abner Louima was born and raised in the small community of Thomassin, Haiti. In 1991, at the age of 24, Abner immigrated to the United States of America, married, and soon fathered one child. By 1997, Abner and family were living in Brooklyn, New York. He had been trained as an electrical engineer in Haiti, but in New York, he was unable to get a position related to his education. He found a job as a security guard for a water and sewage plant in the Flatlands area of Brooklyn, New York. Before the end of 1997, Abner was a naturalized citizen of the United States of America.

==Incident==
On the night of August 9, 1997, the police were called and several officers from the 70th Precinct were dispatched to the scene where Abner Louima and other men had been involved in a fight between two women in Club Rendez-Vous, a popular nightclub in East Flatbush, Brooklyn. Police, supporters, and various people all became involved in the fight outside the club. Police officers Justin Volpe, Charles Schwarz, Thomas Bruder, and Thomas Wiese, and others responded to the scene. In the ongoing altercation, Volpe said that Louima had attacked him. Louima was charged with disorderly conduct, obstructing government administration, and resisting arrest. Later, Volpe admitted his accusation about Louima being his assailant was a lie.

On the ride to the station, the arresting officers beat Louima with their fists, nightsticks, and hand-held police radios. On arriving at the station house, they had Louima strip-searched and put in a holding cell. The beating continued later, culminating with Louima being sexually assaulted in a bathroom at the 70th Precinct station house in Brooklyn. Volpe kicked Louima in the testicles, and while Louima&#x27;s hands were cuffed behind his back, he first grabbed onto and squeezed his testicles and then forced a broken broomstick up his rectum. According to trial testimony, Volpe walked through the precinct holding the bloody, excrement-stained instrument in his hand, bragging to a police sergeant that he &quot;took a man down tonight.&quot;
Louima&#x27;s teeth were also badly damaged in the attack when the broom handle was jammed into his mouth. He testified that a second officer in the bathroom helped Volpe in the assault but could not positively identify him. The identity of the second attacker became a point of serious contention during the trial and appeals. Louima also initially claimed that the officers involved in the attack called him a racial slur and shouted, &quot;This is Giuliani-time&quot; during the beating. Louima later recanted that claim. The reversal was used by police defense lawyers to cast doubt on the entirety of his testimony.

The day after the incident, police took Louima to the emergency department at Coney Island Hospital. Escorting officers explained away his serious injuries, saying they were the result of &quot;abnormal homosexual activities.&quot; An Emergency Department (ED) nurse, Magalie Laurent, suspecting that Louima&#x27;s extreme injuries were not the result of consensual sex, notified Louima&#x27;s family and the Police Department&#x27;s Internal Affairs Bureau of the likelihood that he had been raped and beaten in custody. Louima suffered severe internal damage to his colon and bladder in the attack, which required three major operations to repair. He was hospitalized for two months after the incident.

==Public reaction==
Reports of the incident and the severity of Louima&#x27;s injuries provoked national outrage. On August 29, 1997, an estimated 7,000 demonstrators marched to the New York City Hall and the 70th Precinct station house at 154 Lawrence Avenue where the attack took place. The march was dubbed &quot;Day of Outrage Against Police Brutality and Harassment.&quot;

The case was mentioned in the 1998 Amnesty International report on the United States, among several other cases of police brutality, torture, and abuse. Amnesty International also uses the incident as a case study on a treatise in the campaign against torture.

Mike McAlary, a &quot;New York Daily News&quot; journalist, investigated and reported an exposé of the brutalization of Louima by NYPD officers. He won the 1998 Pulitzer Prize for distinguished commentary for this reporting.

==Criminal trials==
Volpe was charged with several counts in federal court of violating Louima&#x27;s civil rights, obstruction of justice, and making false statements to police; he pled &quot;not guilty&quot;. Midway through the trial, Volpe changed his plea to guilty, confessing to having sodomized Louima. Although Louima had suffered several broken teeth, Volpe denied that he ever struck Louima in the mouth with the stick and claimed that he only put it very close to Louima&#x27;s mouth. Volpe also admitted that he had threatened Louima&#x27;s life. Volpe was convicted of the charges. On December 13, 1999, he was sentenced to 30 years in prison, without the possibility of parole, as well as a $525 fine and restitution in the amount of $277,495.

Charles Schwarz was convicted on June 27, 2000 for helping Volpe assault Louima in the bathroom, and he was sentenced to 15 years in prison. At the time of his conviction, numerous questions were raised about whether he could receive a fair trial in the highly charged atmosphere. Volpe identified Wiese, not Schwarz, as the second man in the bathroom, in a recorded interview on news show &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, a fact not brought up in the trial. The conviction was overturned by the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which found that Schwarz was denied a fair trial. However, in 2002, Schwarz pleaded guilty to a perjury charge for testifying that he did not lead Louima to the bathroom, and he was sentenced to five years in prison. His request for leniency was rejected on March 30, 2006. He was released to a halfway house in February 2007, and as of 2019 works in New York City as a carpenter.

Three other NYPD officers (Bruder, Wiese, and Sergeant Michael Bellomo) were indicted for trying to cover up the assault. On March 9, 2000, Wiese and Bruder, along with Schwarz, were convicted on the charge of conspiracy to obstruct a federal investigation into the assault on Louima, but their convictions were reversed by a federal appeals court in February 2002 for insufficient evidence. Bellomo was found not guilty of trying to cover up the beating of Louima and that of another Haitian immigrant by Volpe earlier that evening.

In February 2021, Volpe&#x27;s request for a COVID-related compassionate release was denied. Nevertheless, he was released from prison early on April 13, 2023. 

Jack Smith, then a young assistant United States Attorney, was one of the prosecutors who worked on these cases.

==Aftermath==
Louima was represented by attorney Sanford Rubenstein in a subsequent civil suit against the City of New York; this was settled for $8.75 million on July 30, 2001, the largest police brutality settlement in New York City history. After legal fees, Louima collected approximately $5.8 million.

In February 2003, Louima visited his family still living in Haiti. There, he discussed setting up the Abner Louima Foundation, a nonprofit organization to raise additional money to build a community center and hospital in Haiti. Louima indicated he had plans to use his own money and donations to open community centers in Haiti, New York, and Florida for Haitians and others seeking legal, financial or other aid. Louima paid the school tuition for 14 poor children in Thomassin, the small community where he grew up. During his visit to Haiti, he met with the President of Haiti, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, a former priest whom Louima knew from his school days. In a rare interview, Louima said he is convinced that he can make a difference in his impoverished homeland: &quot;Maybe God saved my life for a reason, I believe in doing the right thing.&quot;

In 2007, Louima was residing in Miami Lakes, Florida. He owns homes in suburban Miami and Port-au-Prince, and several investment properties in Florida.

Louima has since participated in anti-police brutality protests with Al Sharpton, notably over the shooting of Sean Bell in November 2006, and on August 9, 2007, exactly 10 years after his attack. On the latter date, Louima was honored in New York City by the National Action Network (an organization founded by Sharpton), at the House of Justice, for his resolve and for helping others who have suffered from police brutality.

<text>The Baybridge Canal was a short canal built entirely within the parish of West Grinstead in the English county of Sussex. It opened in 1826, and closed in 1875.

==History==
The River Adur is formed when the Western Adur and the Eastern Adur join near Henfield. The Western branch starts near Slinfold, and flows through Shipley and West Grinstead. The Eastern branch rises on Ditchling Common, and flows through Haywards Heath and Burgess Hill. Below the junction, the combined stream flows for to reach the English Channel at the port of Shoreham-by-Sea. Under the River Adur Navigation and Drainage Act 1807 (47 Geo. 3 Sess. 2. c. cxvii), the river was improved, to aid both navigation and drainage, and barges could reach Bines Bridge on the Western Adur.
In 1824, the civil engineer May Upton produced a plan for extending the navigation northwards to West Grinstead, at a cost of just under £6,000. This formed the basis for another act of Parliament, the (6 Geo. 4. c. clxiv), and created the Baybridge Canal Company. Seven men were named as proprietors, including Lord Selsey and Sir Charles Merrick Burrell, and they were empowered to raise £6,000 by issuing shares, and an additional £3,000 by mortgages if required. Although called a canal, it was essentially a river navigation, as it followed the course of the river to West Grinstead, to terminate at a wharf near the Worthing to Horsham turnpike road, now the A24.

The canal ran for from Bines Bridge to the wharf at Baybridge. There were two locks, designed for boats which were , each with a 7-foot rise. All of the route was within the parish of West Grinstead, and the construction work was completed in 1826. The main trade was manure, coal and chalk. The canal closed on 1 September 1875 due to competition from the railways, having been little used after the opening of the railway from Shoreham to West Grinstead in 1861.

==Course==
The waterway was crossed by a swing bridge just above the lower lock, and a lift bridge at Hatterell Farm. Both have been replaced by fixed bridges, and the Environment Agency maintain a gauging station at the Hatterell Farm bridge, which measures flows in the river. The average flow up to 2005 was 22.43 million gallons (101.9 Megalitres) per day.

<doc id="761404" wikidata="Q38516" url="?curid=761404" title="Dog park">
<text>A dog park is a park for dogs to exercise and play off-leash in a controlled environment under the supervision of their owners.

==Description==
Dog parks have varying features, although they typically offer a fence, separate double-gated entry and exit points, adequate drainage, benches for humans, shade for hot days, parking close to the site, water, pooper-scooper to pick up and dispose of animal waste in covered trash cans, and regular maintenance and cleaning of the grounds. However, it is a norm to pick up after one&#x27;s own dog. Dog parks may also offer wheel-chair access, a pond for swimming and a separate enclosure for small dogs.

Some dog parks have separate play spaces for large and small dogs. Others have one large area for dogs of all sizes. There is debate about this issue, as some argue that dogs should be segregated by size, while others feel that dogs of all sizes can and should socialize together.

==History==
In 1979, Ohlone Dog Park, part of Ohlone Park in Berkeley, California opened. It is widely recognized as the world&#x27;s first dog park. Similar to other parks in Berkeley at the time (such as People&#x27;s Park), it was a community project on public land that was not officially sanctioned. However, it was officially sanctioned by the City of Berkeley government in 1983.

Dog parks began as a reaction to decreased public space, urban development, and leash laws. 

New establishment of dog parks in urban and suburban areas has seen significant increase since the 2000s.

==Instant dog parks==

Communities re-purpose pools, ice rinks, hockey rinks and tennis courts in the off season as makeshift dog parks as an inexpensive, practical, and quick way to solve a problem. Municipalities allow zoning variance and/or tax incentive, and liability waiver for these.

==Dog park growth==
Dog parks are the fastest-growing segment of city parks. There were 569 off-leash dog parks in the 100 largest U.S. cities in 2010, a 34 percent jump in 5 years, while overall parks increased only 3 percent. Portland, Oregon has the highest per capita in the US with 5.7 dog parks for every 100,000 residents. Calgary, AB has the highest per capita in North America, with 15.9 dog parks for every 100,000 residents. There are now more American households with dogs than with kids of 43 million and 38 million respectively. &quot;It&#x27;s a playground for people without kids.&quot;

==Children in dog parks==
In Houston, Texas, some dog parks allow children inside if they are properly chaperoned by an adult, while others exclude children. The Houston Dog Park Association, a non-governmental club, said that adults should be cautious about bringing children inside a dog park and be aware that it is hard to keep a careful eye on both the dog and a child.

==Public dog parks==

A public dog park is typically a fenced outdoor area where people and their dogs can play together. Similarly, a dog run is a smaller fenced area, created for the same use, that is often located within an existing park. Public dog parks are most commonly operated by your city or county&#x27;s parks department and are frequently part of a park. As the names imply, these places offer dogs off-leash play areas where their owners can enjoy a park-like setting and the chance to socialize with other canines and their owners. Public dog parks are being established all over the country and offer a wealth of benefits to dogs, dog owners and the community as a whole. Unless they are well-lit, most public dog parks are open to the public from dawn until dusk. Some public dog parks have vaccination requirements but are not typically staffed or enforced unless there is some kind of incident which is reported to animal control.

Some municipalities designate portions of public beaches, or entire coastal areas, for the use of dogs off-leash.

==Private dog parks==
A private dog park is an indoor or fenced outdoor area where people and their dogs can play together. Private dog parks are most commonly membership based and run as a for-profit business. Private dog parks can also be run as part of an apartment complex or community center. Some private dog parks combine other businesses such as retail areas, boarding, dog training, daycare and grooming services. When private dog parks are staffed, they commonly inspect dogs for lice and oral papillomas upon entry and supervise play. Toys and common play areas of private dog parks are commonly sanitized on a daily basis to ensure cleanliness and to prevent the spread of bacteria and diseases.

==Benefits of off-leash dog parks==

Off-leash dog areas, or dog parks, provide a community setting in which people can gather and socialize and where they can observe the interaction of groups of dogs at play. Dog parks allow owners and their dogs to spend time together and offer dogs a space for play and companionship with others. Leashes can cause dogs (which are territorial animals) to become territorial. Roaming free is beneficial for dogs.

Organizations like the ASPCA regard dog parks as beneficial to dogs and to dog owners. According to Dan Emerson of DogChannel.com, proponents of dog parks cite the following benefits: &quot;They promote responsible pet ownership and the enforcement of dog-control laws; give dogs a place to exercise safely, thus reducing barking and other problem behaviors; provide seniors and disabled owners with an accessible place to exercise their companions; and provide an area for community-building socializing.&quot; Dog-park regulations vary from park to park; some are quite extensive and comprehensive.

Studies have shown that people find it easier to talk to each other with dogs as the initial focus, breaking down the usual social barriers that make people perceive others as strangers. Some dog-owners are unable to properly exercise their dogs and could benefit from taking their dogs to a dog park.

Additional benefits of a dog park to the community include promoting responsible dog-ownership as well as accommodating dogs and their owners in a public open space, which has been shown to lead dog owners to higher levels of compliance with relevant laws.
The benefits of exercise for dogs are well documented, although dogs can learn and reinforce bad behaviors if owners are not vigilant or careful.

==Limitations of off-leash dog parks==
According to advice from experts such as Cesar Millan, dog parks are not able to substitute the act of walking dogs daily. It has also been recommended that dog owners walk dogs for 35 minutes, before placing them inside a dog enclosure, in order to adjust dogs to the urban environment. Dogs that are highly socialized and exercised are healthier, happier, and less aggressive in behavior. They are less likely to bark or be destructive or aggressive if they are able to expend pent-up energy during regular play or exercise.

It has also been noted that establishing a dog park may create contention within a community when residents worry about noise, smell, and traffic.

<text>Akera is a marine genus of sea hare in the family Akeridae, known from the late Callovian (Jurassic) to the recent periods.

&quot;Akera&quot; is the sole genus within the family Akeridae.

==Description==

&quot;Akera&quot; is a primitive genus. Their soft and elongated body does not fit completely in their external shell; it just covers their visceral hump which is positioned at the posterior end of their bodies. Their streamlined bodies are adapted for burrowing.

The shell is large and glossy, globosely cylindrical with a paper-thin, translucent, and flexible texture that provides minimal protection. The spire is truncated, and the whorls are deeply channeled. The protoconch is partially embedded. The upper whorls are blunt. The aperture spans the length of the body whorl or is slightly shorter. It is expanded and deeply sinuated in front, with the outer margin disunited at the suture. The columella is exposed, revealing the inner whorls. The color of the shell is muted, ranging from pale brown to greenish hues.

The head-disc is greatly elongated, wide, and bifid anteriorly, tapering towards the rear. The mantle&#x27;s hind edge is fimbriated and extends through the fissured shell suture. The foot is expanded and narrow with a rounded anterior end, becoming broad and truncated posteriorly. Using its extended lateral parapodia, the animal swims with considerable agility. 

==Distribution==
Species of this marine genus have a global distribution including temperate and tropical seas, inhabiting soft muddy bottoms, sea grass beds and coral sand. They are herbivorous, feeding on algae and detritus.

== Species ==
* &quot;Akera bayeri&quot; - It can be found along the coast of Colombia and Brazil. 
* &quot;Akera bullata&quot; - type species
* &quot;Akera constricta&quot; 
*&quot; Akera julieae&quot; 
* &quot;Akera silbo&quot; 
* &quot;Akera soluta&quot; - Also called the &quot;Solute akera&quot;, this species can be found in the Indo-West Pacific. Little is known about this species. Its shell can grow as large as 45 mm in length.

<text>Suzan-Lori Parks (born May 10, 1963) is an American playwright, screenwriter, and novelist. Her play &quot;Topdog/Underdog&quot; won the Pulitzer Prize for Drama in 2002; Parks was the first African-American woman to receive the award for drama. She was named one of the 100 most influential people in the world by &quot;Time&quot; magazine in 2023.

==Early life and education==

Parks was born in Fort Knox, Kentucky. She grew up with two siblings in a military family. Parks enjoyed writing poems and songs and created a newspaper with her brother, called the &quot;Daily Daily.&quot; Parks was raised Catholic and attended high school in West Germany, where her father, a career officer in the United States Army, was stationed. The experience showed her &quot;what it feels like to be neither white nor black, but simply foreign&quot;. After returning to the U.S., her family relocated frequently and Parks went to school in Kentucky, Texas, California, North Carolina, Maryland, and Vermont. She graduated high school from The John Carroll School in 1981, while her father was stationed in Aberdeen Proving Ground.

In high school, Parks was discouraged from studying literature by at least one teacher, but upon reading Virginia Woolf&#x27;s &quot;To the Lighthouse&quot;, Parks found herself veering away from her interest in chemistry, gravitating towards writing. Parks attended Mount Holyoke College and became a member of Phi Beta Kappa. She graduated in 1985 with a B.A. degree in English and German literature. She studied under James Baldwin, who encouraged her to become a playwright; Parks was initially resistant to writing for theater, believing it was elitist and cliquey. Parks, at his behest, began to write plays. Baldwin considered her talent as amazing. Parks then studied acting for a year at Drama Studio London.

Parks was inspired by Wendy Wasserstein, who won the Pulitzer in 1989 for her play &quot;The Heidi Chronicles&quot;, and by her Mount Holyoke professor, Leah Blatt Glasser.

==Career==
Parks has written three screenplays and numerous stage plays. Her first screenplay was for Spike Lee&#x27;s 1996 film &quot;Girl 6&quot;. She later worked with Oprah Winfrey&#x27;s Harpo Productions on screenplays for &quot;Their Eyes Were Watching God&quot; (2005) and &quot;The Great Debaters&quot; (2007).

Parks became the first female African American to receive the Pulitzer Prize for Drama, which was awarded in 2002 for her play &quot;Topdog/Underdog&quot;. She has also received a number of grants including the MacArthur Foundation &quot;Genius&quot; Grant in 2001. She is a winner of the 2017 Poets, Essayists and Novelists (PEN) America Literary Awards in the category Master American Dramatist. She received the 2018 Steinberg Distinguished Playwright Award. This biennial award is given to &quot;established playwrights whose body of work has made significant contributions to the American theatre.&quot;

=== &quot;Betting on the Dust Commander&quot; ===
Although &quot;Betting on the Dust Commander&quot; was not the first play Parks wrote, it was the first of her plays to be produced. Her first play &quot;The Sinner&#x27;s Place&quot;, which she wrote for her senior project at Mount Holyoke, was rejected for production by her college&#x27;s drama department as they considered it too experimental since she wanted to have dirt on the stage during the performance. When her second play, &quot;Betting on the Dust Commander,&quot; first premiered, it ran for three nights in a bar in Manhattan&#x27;s Lower East Side called &quot;Gas Station.&quot; It is a short, one-act play set in Kentucky, centering around the lives of a couple, Mare and Lucius, who have been married for 110 years. The play&#x27;s title comes from the horse that won the Kentucky Derby in 1970, Dust Commander. As the play goes on, we discover that Dust Commander&#x27;s Derby is responsible for bringing Mare and Lucius together, and through the couple&#x27;s discussion of him they think back over their many years of memories together. Poet Philip Kolin argues that Parks&#x27;s incorporation of non-linear time and a repetitive style is reminiscent of African rituals and the way that their retelling of stories often incorporate the past in a literal manner.

===&quot;Topdog/Underdog&quot;===
One of her best-known works is &quot;Topdog/Underdog&quot;. This play marked a departure from the heightened language she usually wrote. Parks is an admirer of Abraham Lincoln and believed he left a legacy for descendants of slaves. It tells the story of two African-American brothers: Lincoln and Booth. Lincoln works at a boardwalk arcade, dressing up like Abraham Lincoln and letting the tourists shoot him with plastic guns. He got this job because he could be paid less than the white man who had the job before. Author Joshua Wolf Shenk argues that Parks does not judge Lincoln in this play, but rather enjoys bringing him into the other characters&#x27; lives and seeing how they are affected. In an interview, Parks said, &quot;Lincoln is the closest thing we have to a mythic figure. In days of Greek drama, they had Apollo and Medea and Oedipus – these larger than life figures that walked the earth and spoke – and they turned them into plays. Shakespeare had kings and queens that he fashioned into his stories. Lincoln, to me, is one of those.&quot;

===365 Plays/365 Days===
After her book &quot;Getting Mother&#x27;s Body&quot; was published, Parks gave herself the task of writing 365 plays in 365 days, ultimately produced as &quot;365 Plays/365 Days&quot;.

The plays were presented by 725 performing arts groups, taking turns until the entire cycle was performed. The performances started in 2006 at The Public Theater in New York City, and included venues such as the Denver Center Theatre Company, colleges in England and Australia and the Steel City Theatre Company in Pueblo, Colorado. Other venues were the Steppenwolf Theatre Company and the Goodman Theatre in Chicago, and the Center Theater Group in Los Angeles.

===&quot;Father Comes Home From the Wars, Parts 1, 2 &amp; 3&quot;===
&quot;Father Comes Home From the Wars, Parts 1, 2 &amp; 3&quot; premiered off-Broadway at the Public Theater in a developmental production in March 2014 and a full production that fall. Directed by Jo Bonney, the cast featured Sterling K. Brown, Louis Cancelmi, Peter Jay Fernandez, Russell G. Jones, and Jacob Ming-Trent. Jacob Ming-Trent won the 2015 Lucille Lortel Award for Outstanding Featured Actor in a Play and Parks won the 2015 Obie Award for playwriting presented by the American Theater Wing. The play, which takes place during the American Civil War, is presented in three parts: Part 1, A Measure of a Man; Part 2, The Battle in the Wilderness; and Part 3, The Union of My Confederate Parts. From September 15 to October 22, 2016, the play had its London premiere at the Royal Court in a transfer of the Public Theatre production directed by Jo Bonney. The cast featured Steve Toussaint, Nadine Marshall, Leo Wringer, Sibusiso Mamba, Tom Bateman, and Jimmy Akingbola.

The play was a finalist for the 2015 Pulitzer Prize for Drama. The Pulitzer committee wrote: &quot;A distinctive and lyrical epic about a slave during the Civil War that deftly takes on questions of identity, power and freedom with a blend of humor and dignity.&quot;

=== The Red Letter Plays ===
The Red Letter Plays refers to &quot;Fucking A&quot; and &quot;In the Blood&quot;, two plays incorporating themes from &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot;. Both plays have a mother named Hester struggling in a society where they put her in the role of outcast. The first play, &quot;In the Blood&quot;, premiered in 1999 and follows the story of Hester, a penniless mother of five who is condemned by the men who once loved her. &quot;In the Blood&quot; was a finalist for the 2000 Pulitzer Prize for Drama. &quot;Fucking A&quot; premiered in 2000 and tells the story of Hester, an &quot;abortionist&quot; trying to free her son from prison.

In 2017, Signature Theatre Company produced these two plays in the same season. Parks said: &quot;They were conceived from the same idea but until now have lived very separate lives. I can&#x27;t wait to participate in the dialogue that will come from witnessing these two works in concert.&quot;

=== &quot;Sally &amp; Tom&quot; ===
In October 2022, &quot;Sally &amp; Tom&quot;, a play about Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings, began performances at the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis.

=== &quot;Plays for the Plague Year&quot; ===
&quot;Plays for the Plague Year&quot;, an anthology of plays and songs, described by &quot;The New York Times&quot; as &quot;Parks&#x27;s diaristic musings on the first year of the Covid-19 pandemic and a coincident string of deaths, including those of Black Americans killed by police officers&quot;, was scheduled for a November 2022 premiere at Joe&#x27;s Pub, with Parks onstage singing and starring.

=== &quot;The Harder They Come&quot; ===
&quot;The Harder They Come&quot;, Parks&#x27;s musical adaptation of the 1972 Jamaican reggae film was staged at the Public Theater in 2023.

==Personal life==
In 2001, Parks married blues musician Paul Oscher; they divorced in 2010. By 2017, she married Christian Konopka, with whom she has a child.

Parks noted in an interview that her name is spelled with a &quot;Z&quot; as the result of a misprint early in her career:

:When I was doing one of my first plays in the East Village, we had fliers printed up and they spelled my name wrong. I was devastated. But the director said, &#x27;Just keep it, honey, and it will be fine.&#x27; And it was.

She teaches playwriting at Tisch School of the Arts in the Rita &amp; Burton Goldberg Department of Dramatic Writing.

<text>Antonio Pastor (May 28, 1837 – August 26, 1908) was an American impresario, variety performer and theatre owner who became one of the founding forces behind American vaudeville in the mid-to-late-nineteenth century. He was sometimes referred to as the &quot;Dean of Vaudeville&quot;. The strongest elements of his entertainments were an almost-jingoistic brand of United States patriotism and a strong commitment to attracting a &quot;mixed-gender&quot; audience, the latter being something revolutionary in the male-oriented variety halls of the mid-century. Although he was a performer and producer, Pastor is best known for &quot;cleaning up&quot; bawdy variety acts and presenting a clean and family-friendly genre called vaudeville.

A collection of his papers is maintained at the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center at the University of Texas in Austin, and in the archives of the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts.

==Life and career==

=== Family ===
Antonio Pastor, father of Tony, was a fruit-seller, barber, and violinist from Spain. His family was reputed by contemporaries to be &quot;of gypsy blood&quot;. He met his future wife, Cornelia Buckley, who was from New Haven, Connecticut, after he came to New York. They then lived in Manhattan. Their third child, and first son, also named Antonio Pastor, was born in Manhattan in 1837 at his parents&#x27; residence at 400 Greenwich Street, in what is now the financial district of lower Manhattan. He had a taste for entertaining when he was young, producing his own plays in the basement of his family&#x27;s home.

===Early career===
In 1846, Pastor embarked on a career in show business. He obtained a job singing at P.T. Barnum&#x27;s Scudder&#x27;s American Museum where he brought his riding, tumbling, and mimicry skills to performances. 

During the next few years he worked in minstrel shows, where he often performed scenes in blackface. Pastor became a celebrated singing clown at a time when circus performances typically concluded with a variety revue. He established himself as a popular singer and songwriter during a four-year run at Robert Butler&#x27;s American Music Hall, a variety theater located at 444 Broadway in what is now called Soho, but was then the heart of the lower Manhattan theater district. Pastor published &quot;songsters&quot;, books of his lyrics which were sung to popular tunes. The music had no notation, as it was assumed that the audience had a collective knowledge of popular song. The subject matter of his music was intended to be bawdy and humorous.

Pastor sang for the Union cause throughout the Civil War, then started his own variety show which went on tour for around five months before settling in New York City. In 1865, Pastor opened his own theatre, Tony Pastor&#x27;s Opera House. The theater was located on the Bowery in partnership with minstrel show performer, Sam Sharpley, whom he later bought out. The same year he organized traveling minstrel troupes who toured the country annually between April and October. Although Pastor was referred to as the &quot;Dean of Vaudeville&quot;, as mentioned before, he is best known for cleaning up variety acts. Pastor was popular with the nearly all-male variety theater audiences; however, he knew that his ticket sales would double if he attracted a female audience. Soon he began to produce variety shows, presenting an evening of clean fun that was a distinct alternative to the bawdy shows of the time and more appropriate for middle-class families. With shows that appealed to women and children as well as the traditional male audience, his theater and touring companies quickly became popular with the middle classes and were soon being imitated.

=== Later career ===

In 1874, Pastor moved his company a few blocks to take over Michael Bennett Leavitt&#x27;s former theater at 585 Broadway. The theater district was moving uptown to Union Square, however, and in 1881 Pastor took a lease on the former Germania Theatre on 14th Street in the same building that housed Tammany Hall. He alternated his theater&#x27;s presentations between operettas and family-oriented variety shows, creating what became known as vaudeville. Vaudeville was popular with the masses from the 1880s to the 1910s. Pastor wanted to capture a mass audience by bringing family entertainment to the middle class. In order to do this, Pastor sought out to make vaudeville &quot;respectable&quot;. He did not sell liquor in his theatre and required a level of decency to his performances which encouraged women and families to attend.

His theater featured performers such as Ben Harney presenting a new style called &quot;ragtime&quot; as well as other up-and-coming talents such as Weber and Fields, George M. Cohan, Sophie Tucker, Lillian Russell, Buster Keaton, Gus Edwards, Eva Tanguay, Blossom Seeley, Benny Fields, May Irwin and Eddie Leonard. Harry S. Sanderson was his business manager from 1878 until 1908. The business records from this period are available to researchers. 

In the musical &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot;, the song &quot;Put On Your Sunday Clothes&quot; includes the line, &quot;We&#x27;ll join the Astors at Tony Pastor&#x27;s&quot;. It also references seeing &quot;the shows at Delmonico&#x27;s&quot;, which suggests that the character does not really know about upper-class social life in New York.

=== Death ===
Tony Pastor died in Elmhurst, Queens County, New York, on August 26, 1908, and was interred in the Cemetery of the Evergreens in Brooklyn. He was 71, and though greatly mourned at his death as one of the last gentlemen of the early vaudeville halls, the medium had passed him by with the advent of the vaudeville circuit in the 1880s. Pastor had remained a local showman in an epoch that increasingly came to be dominated by regional and national chains. Fighting against the monopolies for the rights of individual local showmen was an undertaking that marked the last years of his life, earning him the nickname of &quot;Little Man Tony&quot;.

== Afterpieces ==
Throughout the 1880s, Pastor&#x27;s performances often had an afterpiece following it. They played a major role in his shows, often written in the final act of the program. The afterpieces were written by a group of regular writers, and sometimes Pastor himself. They lasted anywhere from fifteen minutes to an hour. There were three categories; pantomime, melodrama, and parodies. Pastor&#x27;s afterpieces became popular from 1865 to 1875, and because of its popularity, the afterpieces became a staple in Pastor&#x27;s shows. Although the afterpieces were all different, they all dealt with what is meant to be a working-class citizen in New York. Not only did the afterpieces discuss issues such as crime and poverty, but they also discussed leisure activities the working class couldn&#x27;t afford. This made Pastor&#x27;s audiences respond well to the afterpieces, since the working class was his target audience. 

==Music==
According to the humor of the time, Pastor wrote several songs that negatively portrayed ethnic stereotypes, such as &quot;The Contraband&#x27;s Adventures&quot;, the story of a freed slave. After the slave is set free by Union soldiers, he attends an anti-slavery meeting where the abolitionists try to scrub off his dark pigment. The slave concludes by singing...

 ...De nigger will be nigger till de day of jubilee&lt;br&gt;
For he never was intended for a white man.&lt;br&gt;
Den just skedaddle home-leave de colored man alone;&lt;BR&gt;
For you&#x27;re only making trouble for de nation;&lt;BR&gt;
You may fight and you may fuss&lt;BR&gt;
But you never will make tings right&lt;BR&gt;
Until you all agree for to let de nigger be&lt;BR&gt;
For you&#x27;ll neber, neber, neber wash him white! 

Though he separated some ethnic groups in his music, he also intended to unite the lower and middle classes. In songs like &quot;The Upper and Lower Ten Thousand&quot;, he defended the common man of the Bowery:

 If an Upper-Ten fellow a swindler should be&lt;BR&gt;
And with thousands of dollars of others make free&lt;BR&gt;
Should he get into court, why, without any doubt,&lt;BR&gt;
The matter&#x27;s hushed up and they&#x27;ll let him step out.&lt;BR&gt;
If a Lower-Ten Thousand chap happens to steal,&lt;BR&gt;
For to keep him from starving, the price of a meal,&lt;BR&gt;
Why the law will declare it&#x27;s a different thing-&lt;BR&gt;
For they call him a thief, and he&#x27;s sent to Sing-Sing!

<text>The following is a list of test cards used by the BBC at various points in broadcasting.

==Tuning Signals==
The first &quot;Tuning Signals&quot; test card was broadcast by the BBC in 1934. It was a simple line and circle broadcast using Baird&#x27;s 30-line system, and was used to synchronise the mechanical scanning system.

==Test Card A==
Test Card A was introduced in 1936–37. However, it was only broadcast as engineering tests from January to (approx.) October 1947, when it was replaced by the first version of Test Card C. An electronically generated &quot;cruciform&quot; test card (or &quot;art bars&quot;) was often shown instead of Test Card A until well into the 1960s.

The test card was designed to test for focus, frequency response and scan geometry. High frequency response is indicated by gratings corresponding to 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5 and 3 MHz; while low frequency response is indicated by a solid black bar below the central circle.

==Test Card B==

Test Card B was an early BBC television test card. It was very similar to Test Card A and also only broadcast as engineering tests. The original card has since gone missing. The only differences were that the frequency bars were juxtaposed, the values were deleted, and an Ilford Panchromatic Response Chart placed below the circle where the letter box had been, the letter box in Test Card A was moved to the top of the card replacing the vertical resolution test.

==Test Card C==

Test Card C was a BBC television test card first broadcast in 1947. It was the first test card to resemble the famous Test Card F. 

Test Card C allowed adjustment and verification of parameters such as:

* Aspect Ratio: central circles

* Resolution: five gratings corresponding to frequencies of 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5 and 3.0 MHz
* Contrast: five steps with the top square corresponding to 100% and the bottom square to 30% luminance
* Linearity: white squares 
* Low Frequency Response: letterbox above the circle
* Reflections: black and white areas to the sides of the circle
* Focus: diagonal black and white stripes
* Picture into sync: triggered by the castellations 

The card was available as individual rolls of test film in the UK and many Commonwealth countries up until the end of the black-and-white television era.

Test Card C continued in use on 405-lines until 1964 being replaced by Test Card D.

625-line variants of Test Card C were later used in Jamaica, Mauritius, Singapore and Trinidad and Tobago. Heavy modifications of Test Card C were used by ABC Television in Australia and NIRT in Iran.

=== Pye Test Card G ===

Pye developed a monochrome variant of Test Card C called Test Card G. It was used in several countries that use 625-line PAL and SECAM, such as People&#x27;s Republic of Bulgaria, Denmark, Luxembourg, Thailand, Barbados, Malaysia, and Hungarian People&#x27;s Republic, but not in Britain. A slightly modified version was used by YLE in Finland until it switched to the colour Telefunken FuBK test card in the 1970s, as well as in Norway where NRK and Telenor used it in conjunction with the EIA 1956 resolution chart until it switched to the Philips PM5544, Test Card F and the Telefunken FuBK test cards in the 1970s.

==Test Card D==
Test Card D was a television test card first broadcast on 5 May 1964 by both the BBC and the ITA. This Test Card was a joint effort between the BBC, BREMA and the ITA.

This was the first test card to be based on a specification. Test Card D was amended, and the amendment introduced on 1 December 1965 as the radio and television trade objected to the original. Both versions had Reduced Power variants from the start.

==Test Card E (later Test Card C)==

Test Card E was a television test card designed in 1964 and made to accommodate the 625-line system on BBC2, as opposed to the 405-line system of Test Card D. However, Test Card E lasted for only four and a half days before being withdrawn. Test Card E was thereafter replaced by a modified version of Test Card C, which lasted on BBC2 until December 1964, the illustrated version of Test Card C shown here replaced the first version, and was discontinued in September 1969, and when the colour Test Card F was introduced in July 1967, Test Card C was only shown between 9.00 and 9.58 a.m. 

A version of the modified Test Card C also aired on BBC1 and BBC 2 from November 1969 (with the BBC1 and BBC 2 logos replacing the &quot;BBC2 625 LINES&quot; caption). This modified Test Card C also had versions where Reduced Power also appeared in the ident box. This version of Test Card C was last used in February 1975, and was only ever generated locally at the transmitter. Test Card E did however see later usage by RTÉ in Ireland and RTP in Portugal alongside Test Card D.

==Test Card F==
Test Card F was the BBC&#x27;s longest-running and most famous test card, featuring Carole Hersee and Bubbles the Clown. There have been many different Test Card F variations. It was first broadcast on 2 July 1967 (the day after the first colour pictures appeared to the public on television) on BBC2.

==Test Card G==
Test Card G was a television test card broadcast occasionally by the BBC. It was a variant of the famous Philips PM5544 test card and was introduced around 1971 as their first electronically generated colour test card. Test Card G was generally used by local transmitters for opt outs or during times when a particular region was not showing a programme broadcast from London. It was also used in place of Test Card F nationally from time to time when the projector showing F&#x27;s photographic slide was not available or undergoing maintenance. This ended some time after Test Card F was converted to electronic form in 1984. Test Card G was also occasionally used by ITV and its regulator the IBA alongside Test Card F and EBU colour bars before switching over to the ETP-1 test card in 1979, though London Weekend Television (LWT) and ITV Channel Television, two constituent franchisee companies in the ITV network structure, continued to broadcast Test Card G after closedown well into the 1980s.

==Test Card H==

Test Card H was designed as a line up chart for cameras in-studio, possibly to test chroma specifications as well as resolution and bandwidth. The &quot;H&quot; designation was solely used for this chart, and was therefore never allocated to a Test Card used for broadcasting; following this, the letter &quot;I&quot; was also passed over as a Test Card letter, having been considered too similar to the number &quot;1&quot;, therefore leading to Test Card J being the next in the series.

==Test Card J==
Test Card J is an enhanced revision of Test Card F, first broadcast in November 1999.

==Test Card W==
Test Card W is an updated 16:9 (1.78:1) widescreen version of Test Card F. A predecessor card, without an identifying letter, first appeared in March 1998 as part of digital tests on the Astra 1D satellite, and was notably broadcast to the public on 6 November 1998 as part of a joke on &quot;Have I Got News For You&quot; to censor then-host Angus Deayton about discussing Peter Mandelson&#x27;s life. Test Card W first appeared in November 1999 alongside Test Card J, with which it bears some similarities. Both aforementioned test cards were designed for the 16:9 (widescreen) ratio.

==Test Card X==
The high-definition version of Test Card W is visually similar but officially lacks a designation letter. This version is often referred to as Test Card X, but this is not a designation which the BBC recognises. It is designed for use on high-definition TV services, &amp; had been included a part of BBC HD&#x27;s preview loop since November 2008 (though it had been in use internally at the BBC for several years prior) until the channel&#x27;s closure in March 2013.

==Unidentified test card==

An electronically generated image was first broadcast on 21 June 1997 on BBC2 between 3am and 4am. It was also broadcast in October 1997 from 3:29am until 3:44am, when, at the same time, BBC1 showed Test Card G. Both channels reverted over to these at the same time, and reverted to TCF at the same time, as part of a switching test with BBC Birmingham, whereby in the event of a need to evacuate BBC TV to Pebble Mill Studios in Birmingham, such as a power failure as happened in June 2000, a switch would be thrown, putting Birmingham in control of the network, until BBC Television Centre could regain control. Both TCG and this image were transmitted from Birmingham to prove the switching facility worked.

This test card was then seen again on 17 April 2007 between 4am and 5am during the BBC Learning Zone. Both transmissions were accompanied by a four-tone test tone, ranging from extremely low frequency to a very high shrill. It is unknown if this Test Card has a name, though this test card has also been known to be used on point-to-point satellite links originating from the Fucino Space Centre and other places in Italy (Telefisco, Lapet, etc), and by Marconi Portugal. Another version, modified for NTSC, was used by Televisión Nacional de Chile (TVN) in the 1990s.

==Untransmitted test cards==
There have been a number of untransmitted test cards. They would most likely be for internal use inside the BBC. Most of them are adapted from Test Card F.

==Comic Relief test card==
A Comic Relief test card was broadcast on BBC1 on 18 March 1993 as part of Comic Relief. This test card featured ten-year-old competition winner Hannah Marriott, wearing a red nose.

<text>Russell D. Owen (January 8, 1889 – April 3, 1952) was an American journalist employed by &quot;The New York Times&quot;. He covered Arctic and Antarctic exploration both as a reporter and in books. Owen Peak, originally named &quot;Mount Russell Owen,&quot; was named in his honor after having traveled as a &quot;Times&quot; correspondent with the first Byrd Antarctic Expedition (1928-30).

==Life==

Born 1889 in Chicago, Owen worked for &quot;The Sun&quot; of New York City from 1906 to 1920. He and Ethel J. McGregor married in 1913. She died in 1948. They had one daughter.

After short stints elsewhere, Owen moved to &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1921 and returned in 1926 after two years running the General Electric news bureau.

That year he covered the air race to the North Pole, flying with Roald Amundsen (airship &quot;Norge&quot;) as far as Ny-Ålesund, Svalbard and meeting Richard Evelyn Byrd there. (Ny-Ålesund was the northernmost point of departure for both.)

Owen joined the First Byrd Antarctic Expedition of 1928–1930. He submitted graphic radio dispatches that were printed in many newspapers and won the annual Pulitzer Prize for Reporting in 1930 citing the 1929 portion of that work. He also appeared in the documentary film &quot;With Byrd at the South Pole&quot; (Paramount, 1930). His book about the expedition was published in 1934, entitled &quot;South of the Sun&quot;, and he wrote two more polar books later.

<text>The New American Poetry 1945–1960 is a poetry anthology edited by Donald Allen and published in 1960. It aimed to pick out the &quot;third generation&quot; of American modernist poets, and included quite a number of poems fresh from the little magazines of the late 1950s. In the longer term it attained a classic status, with critical approval and continuing sales. It was reprinted in 1999. As of the anthology&#x27;s 65th anniversary in 2025, Edward Field and Gary Snyder are the only contributors still living.

==Overview==
In 1958, Allen began work on &quot;The New American Poetry&quot; anthology. Following the Pound/Williams tradition, Allen hoped to present the range of experimental writing produced in the United States since the Second World War. The project took two years to complete and required extensive correspondence with poets, editors, and literary agents. The book was finally published in 1960, and, in addition to the poems, included a brief &quot;Preface&quot; by Allen, position-statements by some of the contributors, biographical notes, and an &quot;Index&quot;. Other considerations were taken into account in the organization of this anthology, as the following quotation illustrates:

At the time of its publication, it increased the recognition for the Black Mountain poets - especially Robert Duncan, Robert Creeley, Denise Levertov, Paul Blackburn, and Charles Olson - by identifying their contributions to a distinct literary movement, making them recognized figures in what was then an emerging &quot;countertradition&quot;. Allen originally planned to publish revised anthologies every two or three years. However, he produced only two such books over the next twenty years: &quot;New American Writing&quot; (Penguin, 1965), and &quot;The Postmoderns&quot; (Grove, 1965).

The anthology was also influential in Canada. &quot;It affected the writing of at least one generation of Canadian poets&quot;, according to &quot;The Canadian Encyclopedia&quot;. The anthology influenced many Canadian poets to turn away from British influences and toward American models.

<text>Paedoclione doliiformis is a species of sea angel, a small floating sea slug, a pelagic marine gastropod mollusk in the family Clionidae.

&quot;Paedoclione doliiformis&quot; is the only species in the genus Paedoclione.

The generic name is a reference to the paedomorphic habit of this genus, which retains many larval features throughout its life.

&quot;Paedoclione doliiformis&quot; was originally described by Charles Haskell Danforth in 1907. It was not collected by zoologists for the next 61 years. It was rediscovered in 1968 by Lalli (1972).

== Distribution ==
The type locality of &quot;Paedoclione doliiformis&quot; is Casco Bay, Portland, Maine.

The distribution includes St. Margarets Bay, Nova Scotia, the Gulf of Maine and possibly elsewhere.
== Description ==

&quot;Paedoclione doliiformis&quot; retains juvenile (larval) physical characteristics for the whole of its life. This is called neoteny (a kind of pedomorphosis).

The body length is up to 1.5 mm. &quot;Paedoclione doliiformis&quot; has no shell.

It is a gelatinous, mostly transparent pteropod, and it only has a shell in its embryonic stage.

The orange visceral sac is confined to the anterior part.

== Life cycle ==
Mating is carried out ventrally for mutual fertilization. The following spring, this results in a free-floating, gelatinous egg mass.

Eggs hatch after three days, and the shell is retained until the 11th day.

== Feeding habits ==
&quot;Paedoclione doliiformis&quot; feeds exclusively on &quot;Limacina helicina&quot; and on &quot;Limacina retroversa&quot;, but solely on juveniles with shells smaller than 1 mm. Its abundance is closely linked to that of its prey.

<text>Raptor Red is a 1995 American novel by paleontologist Robert T. Bakker. The book is a third-person account of dinosaurs during the Cretaceous Period, told from the point of view of Raptor Red, a female &quot;Utahraptor&quot;. &quot;Raptor Red&quot; features many of Bakker&#x27;s theories regarding dinosaurs&#x27; social habits, intelligence, and the world in which they lived.

The book follows a year in Raptor Red&#x27;s life as she loses her mate, finds her family, and struggles to survive in a hostile environment. Bakker drew inspiration from Ernest Thompson Seton&#x27;s works that look at life through the eyes of predators, and said that he found it enjoyable to write from a top predator&#x27;s perspective. Bakker based his portrayals of dinosaurs and other prehistoric wildlife on fossil evidence, as well as studies of modern animals. The book was released in hardcover, paperback, and audiobook formats.

When released, &quot;Raptor Red&quot; was generally praised: Bakker&#x27;s anthropomorphism was seen as a unique and positive aspect of the book. Criticisms of the novel included a perceived lack of characterization and average writing. Some scientists, such as paleontologist David B. Norman, took issue with the scientific theories portrayed in the novel, fearing that the public would accept them as fact, while Discovery Channel host Jay Ingram and others defended Bakker&#x27;s creative decisions as provoking debate and bringing science to a wider audience.

==Background==

Paleontologist Robert T. Bakker was motivated to write &quot;Raptor Red&quot; by his interest in dinosaur behavior and his desire to marry science and entertainment. &quot;Nature is a drama,&quot; he said. &quot;It is the most ripping yarn ever written. You&#x27;ve got life and death and sex and betrayal and the best way to approach it is through individual animals.&quot; Bakker found it &quot;fun&quot; to put himself into the shoes of an apex predator, considering the role much tougher than being a herbivore. He credited the turn-of-the-century naturalist Ernest Thompson Seton&#x27;s works that focused on life from the perspectives of grizzly bears and wolves as having inspired him to write the novel from the dinosaur&#x27;s point of view.
&quot;Raptor Red&quot; was an attempt to introduce &quot;Utahraptor&quot; to the public, as well as explain some of Bakker&#x27;s theories regarding dinosaur behavior. Bakker originally suggested the genus name &quot;Utahraptor&quot; for a new dinosaur specimen that had been found by an amateur bone-hunter in Utah. Bakker was at the time consulting with the designers of the &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; film, whose largest portrayed &quot;Velociraptor&quot;—called the &quot;big female&quot; in the script—was coincidentally the same size as the newly discovered specimen. One of the novel&#x27;s other goals was to dispel the common perception of predators as evil and portray them as creatures to be admired and empathized with. Bakker&#x27;s raptors are shown as monogamous, relatively intelligent and social creatures, an assertion he defended. &quot;The life of dinosaurian hunters was hard. Most skeletons we excavate have clear marks of old wounds,&quot; he said. &quot;To survive and raise their young, the predators needed more than sharp teeth and strong claws. They needed social bonds.&quot; The behavior of the raptors and other animals featured in the novel was based on a combination of fossil evidence and observations of modern animals, such as chimpanzees and alligators. Bakker also advanced his theory that an asteroid impact did not kill the dinosaurs in the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, but rather diseases spread through migration.

Bakker received a large advance for the novel from Bantam Books, rumored to be in the six-figure range. The book was prominently featured at the American Booksellers&#x27; Convention in Chicago, alongside Michael Crichton&#x27;s &quot;The Lost World&quot;. Coverage of the event noted that both novels were on the trailing end of the dinosaur fad fueled by &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;, as the new trend in American books was shifting toward politics in the aftermath of the 1994 US elections.

&quot;Raptor Red&quot; was initially published as a mass-market paperback and hardcover book, and was later released as an audiobook by Simon &amp; Schuster Audio, read by Megan Gallagher. Bakker&#x27;s audiobook royalties—at least $34,000 by November 1995—were donated to the Tate Museum in Casper, Wyoming, where he was curator.

==Synopsis==
===Setting and characters===
&quot;Raptor Red&quot; takes place approximately 120 million years ago, in the Early Cretaceous period of the Mesozoic. At the time, a land bridge had formed between Asia and the Americas. This allowed groups of foreign dinosaurs to invade present-day Utah, one being &quot;Utahraptor&quot;. Raptor Red&#x27;s name comes from the symbols the dinosaur learns as a hatchling to self-identify with. Bakker gives an individual view of each species of dinosaur or ancient creature in the same style as Red&#x27;s experiences; these include a baby &quot;Gastonia&quot; who instinctively attacks what it does not understand with its clubbed tail, and a whip-tailed diplodocid who enjoys beating up predators. Bakker prominently features the adventures of a &quot;fur-ball&quot; (mammal), &quot;Aegialodon&quot;; according to the author, the emphasis was added because the &quot;Aegialodon&quot; is on the direct ancestral line to humans. &quot;Aegialodon&quot;, however, did not live in the same time and place as &quot;Utahraptor&quot;, hailing from England about 136 million years ago. Some of the other animals featured in the novel were closer in time and place to &quot;Utahraptor&quot; but not strictly contemporary. For example, fossils attributable to &quot;Acrocanthosaurus&quot; and &quot;Deinonychus&quot; are known from the same rock formation as &quot;Utahraptor&quot; (the Cedar Mountain Formation), but from sediments about five million years younger.

===Plot===
In the book&#x27;s opening, the title character and her mate ambush a herd of &quot;Astrodon&quot;, large herbivorous sauropods. The &quot;Astrodon&quot; are surprised, thinking that their bulk deters smaller predators. &quot;Utahraptor&quot;, however, are much larger than any resident raptor, and proceed to take down an &quot;Astrodon&quot; with teamwork. When Red&#x27;s mate climbs onto the dead &quot;Astrodon&quot;, the corpse rolls in the mud, trapping the male under the bulk of the animal. Despite Red&#x27;s best efforts, her mate suffocates. Despondent, Red wanders around the floodplain, nearly starving since a &quot;Utahraptor&quot; cannot successfully hunt big game on its own.

Red follows a familiar scent and is reunited with her sister, a single mother with three chicks. The two hunt together and bring food back to the nest for the young. A white pterosaur, one Red has seen since she hatched, helps the two by finding carrion and prey in exchange for a helping of meat. On one hunting expedition, when the two adult &quot;Utahraptor&quot; are stalking a herd of &quot;Iguanodon&quot;, Red spies a young male &quot;Utahraptor&quot; that is watching their prey. He begins a courtship dance for Red, but Red&#x27;s sister chases him off, hissing. Her growls agitate the &quot;Iguanodon&quot;, who stampede; the male hastily leaves. After climbing into a tree to escape a flash flood, Red encounters the male raptor again, who performs a courtship dance while hanging onto the tree branches. Red&#x27;s sister begrudgingly allows the male to stay with them, provided he steers clear of her chicks.

For a while, Red and her pack are happy, feeding off the plentiful carrion left by receding flood waters, but the pack&#x27;s way of life is upset by an invasion of large &quot;Acrocanthosaurus&quot;, huge meat-eating dinosaurs. The added competition for food puts strain on the pack, as does the unexpected death of one of the chicks. A fight erupts between the male raptor and Red&#x27;s sister. Red, torn between a prospective mate and her kin, tries to defuse the situation. Two &quot;Acrocanthosaurus&quot; watch the commotion and take the opportunity to attack the raptors. Meanwhile, a &quot;Kronosaurus&quot; ambushes one of the chicks on the beach. Seeing the danger, Red lures one &quot;Acrocanthosaurus&quot; into deep water where it is dragged under by the &quot;Kronosaurus&quot;. Red saves her family, but her consort is forced away by Red&#x27;s sister.

Facing continued threats from the &quot;Acrocanthosaurus&quot;, Red, her sister and the chicks are forced up into the mountains. They encounter ice and snow for the first time, and kill a segnosaur in a cave, turning the den into their nest. The older chick accompanies the two adults on hunting expeditions. One day the raptors encounter a strange creature they have never seen—a whip-tailed diplodocid who inflicts wounds on Red and her sister; the older chick is forced to set off alone and find the pack&#x27;s food. This calamity coincides with the arrival of a large pack of smaller raptors known as &quot;Deinonychus&quot;. They surround the nest and wait for the wounded raptors to become weak enough to attack.

Red&#x27;s sister dies, and Red is crippled and defenseless against the smaller dinosaurs. The &quot;Deinonychus&quot; close in but are driven back by the sudden arrival of the older &quot;Utahraptor&quot; chick and Red&#x27;s consort, who defend the nest. Some time later, the old white pterosaur circles over Red&#x27;s mountain stronghold, and finds the pack has grown considerably. Red and her niece have chicks of their own, who are having fun rolling down a hill. The satisfied pterosaur leaves, having found a mate as well.

==Analysis==
Bakker anthropomorphizes the dinosaurs in &quot;Raptor Red&quot;; the raptors and other wildlife are depicted as demonstrating intellect and emotion. Doctor Patricia E. Chu classified &quot;Raptor Red&quot; as a cinematic and modern &quot;animal story&quot; in the vein of previous works such as Jack London&#x27;s &quot;White Fang&quot;. While the animals in &quot;Raptor Red&quot; are heavily anthropomorphized—Bakker has one dinosaur aware of its own mortality—they are also described in highly technical or technologic terms, such as describing a raptor&#x27;s brain like a computer, or its imprinting through descriptions of biochemistry.

==Reception==
&quot;Raptor Red&quot; was favorably received by critics and the mainstream press. Praise was given to Bakker&#x27;s anthropomorphizing of the dinosaurs; a reviewer for the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; said that &quot;&quot;Raptor Red&quot; does for dinosaurs what some nature writing does for creatures alive today: it turns data into stories. And stories are what all of us need to make these animals—even dinosaurs—come alive.&quot; Mark Nichols of &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; said that Bakker&#x27;s success lay in making the reader hope that the dinosaurs were indeed creatures as Bakker portrayed. James Gorman, writing for &quot;Natural History&quot;, compared Bakker&#x27;s heroine to a &quot;bloody-minded Jane Austen character—bound by family ties, thoroughly responsible, yet longing for independence and love.&quot; A review in &quot;The Psychological Record&quot; recommended the book as a &quot;conceptually-rich and controversial&quot; explanation for dinosaur behavior.

While the &quot;Library Journal&quot;″s review praised Bakker&#x27;s sympathetic characterization for never becoming cartoonish, other critics felt that the anthropomorphizing of the dinosaurs veered too far into exaggeration. Other criticisms included a lack of character needed for truly engrossing fiction. Reviewers described Bakker&#x27;s work as genuine, despite flaws such as inconsistent writing. &quot;Billboard&quot; praised Megan Gallagher&#x27;s narration of the audiobook, with its continuous sound effects and dramatic music to creating an &quot;aural picture&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave &quot;Raptor Red&quot; its &quot;Best of Breed Award&quot; for a &quot;captivating novel about animal life&quot;. 

Many critical reviews of the work came from scientists who objected to Bakker&#x27;s dramatic license and departure from established facts. The paleontologist Thomas Holtz noted that Bakker combined fauna in ways not directly supported by the fossil record; for example, several of the dinosaurs featured in the books lived millions of years after &quot;Utahraptor&quot; died out. Michael Taylor, curator of vertebrate paleontology at the National Museums of Scotland, panned the book, saying that &quot;&quot;Raptor Red&quot; is an accurate portrayal only within the context of uncertainties over the reconstruction of fossil animals as living forms ... Bakker&#x27;s postscript never really admits these uncertainties.&quot; David B. Norman criticized the book as &quot;no more than a children&#x27;s adventure story—and a rather poorly written one at that ... The merging of science and fantasy is at its worst in books like &quot;Raptor Red&quot; because none but the experts can disentangle fact from fiction; this type of nonsense turns an uninformed reader into a misinformed one.&quot; Jay Ingram, from the Discovery Channel, published a rebuttal, saying, &quot;The most important point is that Bakker&#x27;s portrayal of the dinosaurs in &quot;Raptor Red&quot; is vivid—vivid in a way few museum displays or factual accounts can be. And if it turns out in the long run that some of the speculation is unwarranted, who cares? Bob Bakker has given us a unique window onto the era of dinosaurs.&quot;

According to Bakker, the novel&#x27;s success led to interest in a movie deal from Hollywood. Producer Robert Halmi Sr. made deals with Jim Henson&#x27;s Creature Shop for film adaptations of &quot;Animal Farm&quot; and &quot;Raptor Red&quot; in 1996. No official project was announced.

<text>Jackdaws is a World War II spy thriller written by British novelist Ken Follett. It was published in hardcover format in 2001 by Dutton Books, then reissued as a paperback book by Signet Books in 2002. An audiobook narrated by Kate Reading was released in August 2002.

== Plot ==
A week or so before D-Day, a group of French resistance fighters tries to take out a critical telephone exchange in Sainte-Cécile. Felicity, who goes by Flick, is the group leader. The attack is a disaster, with many of the fighters killed or captured. Flick escapes with her wounded husband Michel, who is a resistance leader and is having an affair with a younger lady. Dieter Franck is a German Army officer working for Field Marshall Erwin Rommel. Rommel is on the coast, preparing for an invasion attempt by the Allies, and sent Dieter into France to gauge the strength of the French resistance. Dieter, an expert interrogator, witnessed the attack, seeing trained, brave fighters with plenty of weapons. Under interrogation, he forces one of the captured prisoners to tell him about Michel and Mademoiselle Lemas, who is the contact for Allied agents entering France. Flick heads back to London, where she develops a new plan, using a team of women dressed as cleaning women to enter the building in Sainte-Cécile and destroy the exchange. She recruits a six-woman team: Denise, a Lady; Maude, a driver for FANY who exaggerates the truth; Diana, daughter of the Baron where Flick’s mom is a servant and Flick grew up, who is a crack shoot; Ruby, who is in prison and killed another prisoner; Jelly, an explosives expert; and Greta, a friend of Flick’s brother and a female impersonator who is a telephone exchange expert. Training follows. Diana and Maude develop a lesbian relationship. Denise is kicked off the team, because she talks too much. Paul is an American on the staff of General Montgomery and falls for Flick. 

In France, Dieter tries to infiltrate the resistance groups. He gets Mademoiselle Lemas to reveal how she is contacted by resistance fighters. Dieter’s French girlfriend Stephanie assumes the role of Mademoiselle Lemas and is able to convince Helicopter, a new radio operator, that she and Dieter are part of the resistance. 

Flick senses something wrong at their original drop site, so she and her team parachute into France at an alternate location. This thwarts Dieter’s first attempt to capture Flick. It becomes a cat and mouse, with Dieter making it more and more personal to capture Flick. Flick, on the other hand, doesn’t know how much Dieter has been able to deduce about her team. Flick and her team travel from their drop to Paris and then on to Reims. Photos of Flick are on posters everywhere. Diana and Maude are captured in a fancy restaurant. Back in London, Paul has deduced that Helicopter was captured and that Flick may be in trouble, so he flies into France and makes his way to Mademoiselle Lemas place, where he is captured. Flick leads her team to Mademoiselle Lemas’s house, looking for a place to hide. She finds Paul’s toothbrush outside (he purposely dropped it there) and senses a problem. Flick and her team kill the two Gestapo officers inside the house, kill Stephanie and find Paul alive in the basement.

Flick and her team (minus Ruby, who was captured) manage to destroy the telephone exchange, but Greta is killed in the explosion. Dieter has managed to capture Michel and his young girlfriend, and has Michel reveal the pickup location for Flick’s team. While Dieter waits for the plane, Michel is able to sound a car horn, alerting Flick of the danger. Dieter kills Michel and his girlfriend, but Flick stabs Dieter in the eye. Her team returns to London as the D-Day invasion begins.

One year later, we learn that Diana and Maude died in a German prison. Ruby married one of her training instructors. Mademoiselle Lemas survived the German prison. Flick and Paul are married and plan to live in Boston. Dieter is back in Germany with his wife, one eye missing and having mental issues.

<doc id="761450" wikidata="Q5866603" url="?curid=761450" title="History of South India">
<text>The history of southern India covers a span of over four thousand years during which the region saw the rise and fall of a number of dynasties and empires.

The period of known history of southern India begins with the Iron Age (c. 1200 BCE–200 BCE), Sangam period (c. 600 BCE–300 CE) and Medieval southern India until the 15th century CE. Dynasties of Chera, Chola, Pandyan, Travancore, Cochin, Zamorin, Kolathunadu, Chalukya, Pallava, Satavahana, Rashtrakuta, Western Ganga, Kakatiya, Hoysala, Reddy dynasty, Seunas, Vijayanagara Empire and the Bahmani Sultanate were at their peak during various periods of history. 

The Vijayanagara Empire rose in response to the Islamic intervention and covered most of southern India. It acted as a bulwark against Deccan Sultanate and Mughal expansion into the south. When the European powers arrived during the 16th and 18th century CE, the southern kingdoms, most notably Tipu Sultan&#x27;s Kingdom of Mysore, resisted the new threats, and many parts eventually succumbed to British conquest. The British created the Madras Presidency which acted as an administrative centre for the rest of southern India, with them being princely states. After Indian independence, southern India was linguistically divided into the states of Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Telangana and Kerala.

==Prehistoric period to Iron age==

South India remained in the Mesolithic until 2500 BCE. Microlith production is attested for the period 6000 to 3000 BCE. The Neolithic period lasted from 2500 BCE to 1000 BCE, followed by the Iron Age, characterized by megalithic burials. Comparative excavations carried out in Adichanallur in Tirunelveli district and in Northern India have provided evidence of a southward migration of the Megalithic culture. The Krishna Tungabhadra valley was also a place for Megalithic culture in South India.

=== Beginning of Iron Age ===
The earliest Iron Age sites in southern India date from c. 1200 to 200 BCE and some of sites are contemporary to Sangam period.

Hallur in Karnataka and Adichanallur in Tamil Nadu are notable iron Age sites of ancient southern India.

==Ancient period==

Evidence in the forms of documents and inscriptions do not appear often in the history of ancient southern India. Although there are signs that the history dates back to several centuries BCE, we only have an authentic archaeological evidence from the early centuries of the common era. Until about 600 BC, literature composed to the north of the Vindhyas do not display any cognizance of the region to the south. During the reign of Ashoka (c. 268–232 BCE) the three Tamil dynasties of Chola, Chera and Pandya were ruling the south.

===Pandyan Dynasty===
The Pandyas were one of the three ancient Tamil dynasties (Chola and Chera being the other two) who ruled the Tamil country from pre-historic times until the end of the 15th century. They ruled initially from Korkai, a seaport on the southernmost tip of the Indian peninsula, and in later times moved to Madurai. Pandyas are mentioned in Sangam Literature (c. 400 BCE – 300 CE) as well as by Greek and Roman sources during this period.
The early Pandya dynasty of the Sangam literature went into obscurity during the invasion of the Kalabhras. The dynasty revived under Kadungon in the early 6th century CE, pushed the Kalabhras out of the Tamil country and ruled from Madurai. They again went into decline with the rise of the Cholas in the 9th century CE and were in constant conflict with them. Pandyas allied themselves with the Sinhalese and the Cheras in harassing the Chola empire until they found an opportunity for reviving their fortunes during the late 13th century. Jatavarman Sundara Pandyan (c. 1251) expanded their empire into the Telugu country and invaded Sri Lanka to conquer the northern half of the island. They also had extensive trade links with the Southeast Asian maritime empires of Srivijaya and their successors. During their history Pandyas were repeatedly in conflict with the Pallavas, Cholas, Hoysalas and finally the Muslim invaders from the Delhi Sultanate. The Pandyan Kingdom finally became extinct after the establishment of the Madurai Sultanate in the 14th century CE. The Pandyas excelled in both trade and literature. They controlled the pearl fisheries along the south Indian coast, between Sri Lanka and India, which produced one of the finest pearls known in the ancient world.

===Chola Empire===


The Cholas were one of the three main dynasties to rule southern India from ancient times. Karikala Chola (late 1st century CE) was the most famous king during the early years of the dynasty and managed to gain ascendency over the Pandyas and Cheras. The Chola dynasty, however, went into a period of decline from the 4th century CE. This period coincided with the ascendency of the Kalabhras who moved down from the northern Tamil country, displacing the established kingdoms and ruled over most of southern India for almost 300 years.

Vijayalaya Chola revived the Chola dynasty in 850 CE by conquering Thanjavur by defeating Ilango Mutharaiyar and making it his capital. His son Aditya defeated the Pallava king Aparajita and extended the Chola territories to Tondaimandalam. The centres of the Chola realm were at Kanchi (Kanchipuram) and Thanjavur. One of the most powerful Chola monarchs was Raja Raja Chola, who reigned from 985 to 1014 CE. His army conquered the Navy of the Cheras at Thiruvananthapuram, and annexed Anuradhapura and the northern province of Ceylon. Rajendra Chola I completed the conquest of Sri Lanka, invaded Bengal, and undertook a great naval campaign that occupied parts of Malaya, Burma, and Sumatra. The Chola dynasty began declining by the 13th century and ended in 1279. Cholas were great builders and have left some of the most beautiful examples of early Tamil temple architecture. Brihadisvara Temple in Thanjavur is a fine example and has been listed as one of the UNESCO World Heritage Sites.
===Chera Dynasty===

The Chera kingdom was one of the Tamil dynasties who ruled southern India from ancient times until around the 12th century CE. The Early Cheras ruled over the Malabar Coast, Coimbatore, Erode, Namakkal, Karur and Salem Districts in South India, which now form part of the modern day Indian states of Kerala and Tamil Nadu. Throughout the reign of the Early Cheras, trade continued to bring prosperity to their territories, with spices, ivory, timber, pearls and gems being exported to the Middle East and to southern Europe. Evidence of extensive foreign trade from ancient times can be seen throughout the Malabar coast (Muziris), Karur and Coimbatore districts.

==== Trade relations ====
The region of Kerala (Cheras) was possibly engaged in trading activities from the 3rd millennium BCE with Arabs, Sumerians and Babylonians. Phoenicians, Greeks, Egyptians, Romans, and Chinese were attracted by a variety of commodities, especially spices and cotton fabrics. Arabs and Phoenicians were the first to enter Malabar Coast to trade Spices. The Arabs on the coasts of Yemen, Oman, and the Persian Gulf, must have made the first long voyage to Kerala and other eastern countries. They must have brought the Cinnamon of Kerala to the Middle East. The Greek historian Herodotus (5th century BCE) records that in his time the cinnamon spice industry was monopolized by the Egyptians and the Phoenicians.

Muziris, Tyndis, Naura, Berkarai, and Nelcynda were among the principal trading port centres of the Chera kingdom. Megasthanes, the Greek ambassador to the court of Magadhan king Chandragupta Maurya (4th century BCE) mentions Muziris and a Pandyan trade centre. Pliny mentions Muziris as India&#x27;s first port of importance. According to him, Muziris could be reached in 40 days from the Red Sea ports of Egypt purely depending on the South west monsoon winds. Later, the unknown author of the &quot;Periplus of the Erythraean Sea&quot; notes that &quot;both Muziris and Nelcynda are now busy places&quot;. There were harbours of Naura near Kannur, Tyndis near Kozhikode, and Barace near Alappuzha, which were also trading with Rome and Palakkad pass (churam) facilitated migration and trade. Tyndis was a major center of trade, next only to Muziris, between the Cheras and the Roman Empire. 

Roman establishments in the port cities of the region, such as a temple of &quot;Augustus&quot; and barracks for garrisoned Roman soldiers, are marked in the Tabula Peutingeriana; the only surviving map of the Roman &quot;cursus publicus&quot;. Pliny the Elder (1st century CE) states that the port of &quot;Tyndis&quot; was located at the northwestern border of &quot;Keprobotos&quot; (Chera dynasty). The North Malabar region, which lies north of the port at &quot;Tyndis&quot;, was ruled by the kingdom of Ezhimala during Sangam period. The port of Tyndis which was on the northern side of Muziris, as mentioned in Greco-Roman writings, was somewhere near Kozhikode. Its exact location is a matter of dispute. The suggested locations are Ponnani, Tanur, Beypore-Chaliyam-Kadalundi-Vallikkunnu, and Koyilandy.

According to the &quot;Periplus of the Erythraean Sea&quot;, a region known as &quot;Limyrike&quot; began at &quot;Naura&quot; and &quot;Tyndis&quot;. However the Ptolemy mentions only &quot;Tyndis&quot; as the &quot;Limyrike&quot;s starting point. The region probably ended at Kanyakumari; it thus roughly corresponds to the present-day Malabar Coast. The value of Rome&#x27;s annual trade with the region was estimated at around 50,000,000 sesterces. Pliny the Elder mentioned that &quot;Limyrike&quot; was prone by pirates. The Cosmas Indicopleustes mentioned that the &quot;Limyrike&quot; was a source of Malabar peppers. Contemporary Tamil literature, &quot;Puṟanāṉūṟu&quot; and &quot;Akanaṉūṟu,&quot; speak of the Roman vessels and the Roman gold that used to come to the Kerala ports in search of Malabar pepper and other spices, which had enormous demand in the West. The contact with Middle East and Romans might have given rise to small colonies of Cochin Jews, Mappila Muslims, and Syrian Christians in the chief harbour towns of Kerala.

===Satavahana Empire===

The Śātavāhana Empire was a royal Indian dynasty based at present-day Amaravati in Andhra Pradesh as well as Junnar (Pune) and Pratisthana (Paithan) in present-day Maharashtra. The territory of the empire covered much of India from 300 BCE onward. Although there is some controversy about when the dynasty came to an end, the most liberal estimates suggest that it lasted about 450 years, until around 220 CE. The Satavahanas are credited for establishing peace in the country, resisting the onslaught of foreigners after the decline of Mauryan Empire.

Sātavāhanas started out as feudatories to the Mauryans, but declared independence with its decline. They are known for their patronage of Hinduism. The Sātavāhanas were one of the first Indian states to issue coins struck with their rulers embossed. They formed a cultural bridge and played a vital role in trade as well as the transfer of ideas and culture to and from the Indo-Gangetic Plain to the southern tip of India.

They had to compete with the Shungas and then the Kanvas of Magadha to establish their rule. Later, they played a crucial role to protect a huge swathes of India against foreign invaders like the Sakas, Yavanas and Pahlavas. In particular their struggles with the Western Kshatrapas
went on for a long time. The great Satavahana emperors Gautamiputra Satakarni and Sri Yajna Sātakarni repulsed foreign invasions from the likes of the Western Kshatrapas and stopped their expansion. In the 3rd century CE, the empire was split into smaller states.

===Pallava Dynasty===
The Pallavas were a great Indian dynasty who ruled in southern India between the 3rd century CE until their final decline in the 9th century CE. Their capital was Kanchipuram in present-day Tamil Nadu. Their origins are not clearly known. However, it is surmised that they were Yadavas and they probably were feudatories of Satavahanas. Pallavas started their rule from Krishna River valley, known today as Palnadu, and subsequently spread to present-day southern Andhra Pradesh and northern Tamil Nadu. Mahendravarman I was a prominent Pallava monarch who began work on the rock-cut temples of Mahabalipuram. His son Narasimhavarman I ascended to the throne in 630 CE. He defeated the Chalukya emperor Pulakeshin II in 632 CE and burned the Chalukyan capital Vatapi. Pallavas and Pandyas dominated the southern regions of southern India between the 6th and the 9th centuries CE.

===Kadambas of Banavasi===
Kadambas were one of the greatest kingdoms which ruled south India. Kadambas ruled during 345–525 CE. Their kingdom spanned the present day Karnataka state. Banavasi was their capital. They expanded their territories to cover Goa, Hanagal. The dynasty was founded by Mayura Sharma c. 345 CE. They built fine temples in Banavasi, Belgavi, Halsi and Goa. Kadambas were the first rulers to use Kannada as an administrative language as proven by the Halmidi inscription (450 CE) and Banavasi copper coin. With the rise of the Chalukya dynasty of Badami, the Kadambas ruled as their feudatory from 525 CE for another five hundred years.

===Gangas of Talkad===

The Western Ganga Dynasty ruled southern Karnataka region during 350–550 CE. They continued to rule until the 10th century as feudatories of Rashtrakutas and Chalukyas. They rose from the region after the fall of the Satavahana empire and created a kingdom for themselves in Gangavadi (south Karnataka) while the Kadambas, their contemporaries, did the same in north Karnataka. The area they controlled was called Gangavadi which included the present-day districts of Mysore, Chamrajanagar, Tumkur, Kolar, Mandya and Bangalore. They continued to rule until the 10th century as feudatories of Rashtrakutas and Chalukyas. Gangas initially had their capital at Kolar, before moving it to Talakad near Mysore. They made a significant contribution to Kannada literature with such noted writers as King Durvinita, King Shivamara II and Chavundaraya. The famous Jain monuments at Shravanabelagola were built by them.

==Early Middle Ages==
===Chalukya Empire===

The Chalukyas ruled large parts of southern and central India between the 6th and the 12th centuries. During this period, they ruled as three related yet individual dynasties: Badami Chalukyas, Eastern Chalukyas, Western Chalukyas. The Badami Chalukyas were the earliest dynasty which ruled from Vatapi (modern Badami) from the middle of the 6th century. The Badami Chalukyas began to assert their independence at the decline of the Kadamba dynasty of Banavasi and rapidly rose to prominence during the reign of Pulakeshin II. After the death of Pulakeshin II, the Eastern Chalukyas became an independent kingdom in the eastern Deccan region. They ruled from Vengi until about the 11th century. In the western Deccan, the rise of the Rashtrakutas in the middle of the 8th century eclipsed the Badami Chalukyas before being revived by their descendants, the Western Chalukyas, in the late 10th century. The Western Chalukyas ruled from Kalyani (modern Basavakalyan) until the end of the 12th century.

One of the first kings of the Chalukyan dynasty was Pulakeshin I. He ruled from Badami in Karnataka. His son Pulakeshin II became the monarch of the Chalukyan empire in 610 CE and ruled until 642 CE. Pulakeshin II is most remembered for the battle he fought and won against Emperor Harshavardhana in 637 CE. He also defeated the Pallava king Mahendravarman I. The Chalukya empire existed from 543–757 CE and an area stretching from Kaveri to Narmada rivers. The Chalukyas created the Chalukyan style of architecture. Great monuments were built in Pattadakal, Aihole and Badami. These temples exhibit the evolution of the Vesara style of architecture.

The Eastern Chalukyas ruled along the eastern coast of southern India around the present-day Vijayawada. The Eastern Chalukya dynasty was created by Kubja Vishnuvardhana, a brother of emperor Pulakeshin II. The Eastern Chalukyas continued to rule for over five hundred years and were in close alliance with the Cholas.

===Rashtrakuta Empire===
The Rashtrakuta Empire ruled from Manyaketha in Kalaburagi from 735 CE until 982 CE and reached its peak under Amoghavarsha I (reign. 814 – 878 CE), considered &quot;Ashoka of South India&quot;. The Rashtrakutas came to power at the decline of the Badami Chalukyas and were involved in a three-way power struggle for control of the Gangetic plains with the Prathihara of Gujarat and Palas of Bengal. The Rashtrakutas commissioned some of the beautiful rock-cut temples of Ellora including the Kailasa temple. Kannada language literature flourished during this period of Adikavi Pampa, Sri Ponna and Shivakotiacharya. Emperor Amoghavarsha I wrote the earliest extant Kannada classic Kavirajamarga.

=== Second Cheras of Mahodayapuram ===
Much of history of the region of Kerala from the 6th to the 8th century is obscure. From the Kodungallur line of the Cheras rose the Kulasekhara dynasty, which was established by Kulasekhara Varman. At its zenith these Later Cheras ruled over a territory comprising the whole of modern Kerala and a smaller part of modern Tamil Nadu. During the early part of Kulasekhara period, the southern region from Nagercoil to Thiruvananthapuram was ruled by Ay kings, who lost their power in the 10th century and thus the region became a part of the Cheras. Kerala witnessed a flourishing period of art, literature, trade and the Bhakti movement of Hinduism. A Keralite identity, distinct from the Tamils, became linguistically separate during this period. The origin of Malayalam calendar dates back to year 825 CE. For the local administration, the empire was divided into provinces under the rule of Nair Chieftains known as Naduvazhis, with each province comprising a number of &quot;Desams&quot; under the control of chieftains, called as &quot;Desavazhis&quot;. The era witnessed also a shift in political power, evidenced by a gradual increase of Namboothiri Brahmin settlements, who established the caste hierarchy in Kerala by assigning different groups separate positions. As a result, many temples were constructed across Kerala, which according to M. T. Narayanan &quot;became cornerstones of the socio-economic society&quot;. Mamankam festival, which was the largest native festival, was held at Tirunavaya near Kuttippuram, on the bank of river Bharathappuzha. Athavanad, the headquarters of &quot;Azhvanchery Thamprakkal&quot;, who were also considered as the supreme religious chief of the Nambudiri Brahmins of Kerala, is also located near Tirunavaya.

Sulaiman al-Tajir, a Persian merchant who visited Kerala during the reign of Sthanu Ravi Varma (9th century CE), records that there was extensive trade between Kerala and China at that time, based at the port of Kollam. A number of foreign accounts have mentioned about the presence of considerable Muslim population in the coastal towns. Arab writers such as Al-Masudi of Baghdad (896–956 CE), Muhammad al-Idrisi (1100–1165 CE), Abulfeda (1273–1331 CE), and Al-Dimashqi (1256–1327 CE) mention the Muslim communities in Kerala. Some historians assume that the Mappilas can be considered as the first native, settled Muslim community in South Asia.

The inhibitions, caused by a series of Chera-Chola wars in the 11th century, resulted in the decline of foreign trade in Kerala ports. In addition, Portuguese invasions in the 15th century caused two major religions, Buddhism and Jainism, to disappear from the land. It is known that the Menons in the Malabar region of Kerala were originally strong believers of Jainism. The social system became fractured with divisions on caste lines. The Kulasekhara dynasty was finally subjugated in 1102 by the combined attack of the Pandyas and Cholas. However, in the 14th century, Ravi Varma Kulashekhara (1299–1314) of the southern Venad kingdom was able to establish a short-lived supremacy over southern India. After his death, in the absence of strong central power, the state was fractured into about thirty small warring principalities under Nair Chieftains; the most powerful of them were the kingdom of Samuthiri in the north, Venad in the south and Kochi in the middle. The port at Kozhikode held the superior economic and political position in Kerala, while Kollam (Quilon), Kochi, and Kannur (Cannanore) were commercially confined to secondary roles.

===Western Chalukya Empire===

The Western Chalukya Empire was created by the descendants of the Badami Chalukya clan and ruled from 973–1195 CE. Their capital was Kalyani, present day Basava Kalyana in Karnataka. They came to power at the decline of the Rashtrakutas. They ruled from the Kaveri in the South to Gujarat in the north. The empire reached its peak under Vikramaditya VI. The Kalyani Chalukyas promoted the &quot;Gadag&quot; style of architecture, excellent examples of which are present in Gadag, Dharwad, Koppal and Haveri districts of Karnataka. They patronised great Kannada poets such as Ranna and Nagavarma II and is considered as a golden age of Kannada literature. The Vachana &quot;Sahitya&quot; style of native Kannada poetry flourished during these times.

===Hoysala Dynasty===

Hoysalas began their rule as subordinates of the Chalukyas of Kalyani and gradually established their own empire. Nripa Kama Hoysala who ruled in the western region of Gangavadi, founded the Hoysala dynasty. His later successor Ballala I reigned from his capital at Belur. Vishnuvardhana Hoysala (1106–1152 CE) conquered the Nolamba region earning the title &quot;Nolambavadi Gonda&quot;. Some of the most magnificent specimens of South Indian temples are those attributed to the Hoysala dynasty of Karnataka. Vesara style reached its peak in their period. Hoysalas period is remembered today as one of the brightest periods in the history of Karnataka. They ruled Karnataka for over three centuries from c. 1000 to 1342 CE. The most famous kings among the Hoysalas were Vishnuvardhana, Veera Ballala II and Veera Ballala III. Jainism flourished during the Hoysala period. Ramanuja, the founder of Shri Vaishnavism or Vishishtadvaita Vedanta, came to Hoysala kingdom to spread his school of qualified-monism Hindu thought. Hoysalas encouraged both Kannada and Sanskrit literature and earned a great name as builders of temples at Belur, Halebidu, Somanathapura, Belavadi and Amrithapura. Such famous poets as Rudrabhatta, Janna, Raghavanka and Harihara wrote many classics in Kannada during this time.

===The Kakatiyas===
The Kakatiya dynasty rose to prominence in the 11th century with the decline of the Chalukyas. By the early 12th century, the Kakatiya Durjaya clan declared independence and began expanding their kingdom. By the end of the century, their kingdom had reached the Bay of Bengal and it stretched between the Godavari and the Krishna rivers. The empire reached its zenith under Ganapatideva who was its greatest ruler, responsible for uniting the upper and lower regions of eastern Deccan that spoke the Telugu language, for the first time. At its largest, the empire included most of modern-day Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and parts of Odisha, Tamil Nadu, Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra and Karnataka. Ganapatideva was succeeded by his daughter Rudramba who became the famous warrior-queen Rudrama Devi. The Kakatiya dynasty lasted for three centuries, but their existence can be dated back to the 7th century as per inscriptions although they only served as local chieftains to Chalukyas and Rashtrakutas. Warangal was their capital which was founded in the 12th century. Marco Polo visited Warangal in 1289 and wrote extensively on the kingdom, the city, the queen Rudrama Devi, the prosperity and wealth of the kingdom and the way people live. By the early 14th century, the Kakatiya dynasty attracted the attention of the Delhi Sultanate under Alauddin Khalji. Despite defeating the first attempt in 1303, it paid tribute to the Khaljis for a few years from 1310 after a successful siege by Malik Kafur and was besieged again in 1318 by Khusrau Khan. But they refused to pay tribute to the new Tughluq regime in 1320, which prompted annexation of the Telugu country by the Sultan Ghiyath al-Din Tughluq. The Kakatiyas were eventually conquered by the forces of his successor Muhammad bin Tughluq in 1323. The Kakatiyas were well-versed in administrative duties, military affairs, social policy and diplomatic affairs, developing a unique social structure which differed from other medieval Hindu kingdoms of the subcontinent. Their encouragement of cultural influences from the neighbouring Andhra region in Telangana and vice versa ushered in an era of prosperity and standard of living in both regions. It was made possible due to extensive building of irrigation tanks, artificial lakes and other kinds of small and large reservoirs, interconnected through linking techniques, which helped in converting the dry, arid and rugged areas of Kakatiya territory into a strong, wealthy and stable abode for people who migrated and settled in Telangana. The system of employing capable military officers (nayakas) from any background as part of earning new loyalists for the kings was pursued by them first and then implemented by the Vijayanagara Empire. They were egalitarian rulers who despite adhering to the varna system rewarded those who served the kingdom with loyalty. Their encouragement of inland and maritime trade with safety incentives and exemptions for merchants who faced loss in their sea-borne journey greatly developed commerce with other nations and faraway kingdoms, bringing vast amounts of riches. The Kakatiya legacy is preserved in the form of arts, literature and architecture as well as reservoirs which survive in Telangana. Their patronage of artisans, poets and musicians, also followed by subordinate kings, led to an extensive growth of Telugu language, customs and the overall culture associated with it. Their architectural legacy, borrowed from Western Chalukyas and later developing it into a distinctive style identified with the kingdom, is preserved in the form of forts, temples and gateways. Notable among these are the Warangal Fort, Kakatiya Kala Thoranam, Thousand Pillar Temple, Ramappa Temple, Kota Gullu, Elgandal Fort, Medak Fort and the temples at Pillalamarri in Suryapet. They built large reservoirs like the Pakhal Lake, Ramappa Lake, Bhadrakali Lake and Laknavaram Lake along with other bigger and smaller yet significant ones. They were also very likely to be the original holders of the Koh-i-Noor diamond which was mined in Kollur, Andhra Pradesh and the existence of diamond trade and markets were also mentioned in the writings of Marco Polo.

===Kolathunadu===

The ancient kingdom of Ezhimala in Northern Kerala had jurisdiction over the North Malabar which consisted of two &quot;Nadu&quot;s (regions)- The coastal &quot;Poozhinadu&quot; and the hilly eastern &quot;Karkanadu&quot;. According to the works of Sangam literature, &quot;Poozhinadu&quot; consisted much of the coastal belt between Mangalore and Kozhikode. &quot;Karkanadu&quot; consisted of Wayanad-Gudalur hilly region with parts of Kodagu (Coorg). It is said that Nannan, the most renowned ruler of Ezhimala dynasty, took refuge at Wayanad hills in the 5th century CE when he was lost to Cheras, just before his execution in a battle, according to the Sangam works. Ezhimala kingdom was succeeded by Mushika dynasty in the early medieval period, most possibly due to the migration of Tuluva Brahmins from Tulu Nadu. The &quot;Mushika-vamsha Mahakavya&quot;, written by Athula in the 11th century, throws light on the recorded past of the Mushika Royal Family up until that point. The Indian anthropologist Ayinapalli Aiyappan states that a powerful and warlike clan of the Bunt community of Tulu Nadu was called &quot;Kola Bari&quot; and the Kolathiri Raja of Kolathunadu was a descendant of this clan.

The kingdom of Kolathunadu, who were the descendants of Mushika dynasty, at the peak of its power reportedly extended from Netravati River (Mangalore) in the north to Korapuzha (Kozhikode) in the south with Arabian Sea on the
west and Kodagu hills on the eastern boundary, also including the isolated islands of Lakshadweep in Arabian Sea. An Old Malayalam inscription (Ramanthali inscriptions), dated to 1075 CE, mentioning king Kunda Alupa, the ruler of Alupa dynasty of Mangalore, can be found at Ezhimala near Kannur. The Arabic inscription on a copper slab within the Madayi Mosque in Kannur records its foundation year as 1124 CE. In his book on travels (&quot;Il Milione&quot;), Marco Polo recounts his visit to the area in the mid 1290s. Other visitors included Faxian, the Buddhist pilgrim and Ibn Batuta, writer and historian of Tangiers. The Kolathunadu in the late medieval period emerged into independent 10 principalities i.e., Kadathanadu (Vadakara), Randathara or Poyanad (Dharmadom), Kottayam (Thalassery), Nileshwaram, Iruvazhinadu (Panoor), Kurumbranad etc., under separate royal chieftains due to the outcome of internal dissensions. The Nileshwaram dynasty on the northernmost part of Kolathiri dominion, were relatives to both Kolathunadu as well as the Zamorin of Calicut, in the early medieval period. The kingdom of Kumbla in the northernmost region of the modern state of Kerala, who had jurisdiction over the Taluks of Manjeshwar and Kasaragod, and parts of Mangalore in Southern Tulu Nadu, were also vassals to the kingdom of Kolathunadu until the Carnatic conquests of the 15th century CE.

According to Kerala Muslim tradition, the North Malabar region was also home to several oldest mosques in the Indian subcontinent. According to the Legend of Cheraman Perumals, the first Indian mosque was built in 624 CE at Kodungallur with the mandate of the last the ruler (the Cheraman Perumal) of Chera dynasty, who left from Dharmadom near Kannur to Mecca and converted to Islam during the lifetime of Muhammad (c. 570–632). According to &quot;Qissat Shakarwati Farmad&quot;, the &quot;Masjids&quot; at Kodungallur, Kollam, Madayi, Barkur, Mangalore, Kasaragod, Kannur, Dharmadam, Panthalayani, and Chaliyam, were built during the era of Malik Dinar, and they are among the oldest &quot;Masjid&quot;s in the Indian subcontinent. It is believed that Malik Dinar died at Thalangara in Kasaragod town. The Koyilandy Jumu&#x27;ah Mosque in the erstwhile Kolathunadu contains an Old Malayalam inscription written in a mixture of &quot;Vatteluttu&quot; and Grantha scripts which dates back to the 10th century CE. It is a rare surviving document recording patronage by a Hindu king (Bhaskara Ravi) to the Muslims of Kerala.

===Musunuri===

After the downfall of Kakatiya empire, two cousins known as Musunuri Nayaks rebelled against the Delhi Sultanate and recaptured Warangal and brought the whole of Telugu-speaking areas under their control. Although short lived (50 years), the Nayak rule is considered a watershed in the history of southern India. Their rule inspired the establishment of Vijayanagara empire.

===Reddy Dynasty===
The Reddy Dynasty was established by Prolaya Vema Reddy. The region that was ruled by the Reddy dynasty is now in Andhra Pradesh except some areas of Chitoor, Anantapur and Kurnool districts. Prolaya Vema Reddy was part of the confederation that started a movement against the invading Turkic Muslim armies of the Delhi Sultanate in 1323 CE and succeeded in repulsing them from Warangal. Reddys ruled coastal and central Andhra for over a hundred years from 1325 to 1448 CE. At its maximum extent, the Reddy kingdom stretched from Cuttak, Odisha to the north, Kanchi to the south and Srisailam to the west. The initial capital of the kingdom was Addanki. Later, it was moved to Kondavidu and subsequently to Rajahmundry. The Reddis were known for their fortifications. Two major hill forts, one at Kondapalli, 20 km north west of Vijayawada and another at Kondaveedu about 30 km west of Guntur stand testimony to the fort building skill of the Reddi kings. The forts of Bellamkonda, Vinukonda and Nagarjunakonda in the Palnadu region were also part of the Reddi kingdom.

The dynasty remained in power until the middle of the 15th century and was supplanted by the Gajapatis of Odisha, who gained control of coastal Andhra. The Gajapatis eventually lost control of coastal Andhra after Gajapati Prataprudra Deva was defeated by Emperor Krishna Deva Raya of Vijayanagara. The territories of the Reddi kingdom eventually came under the control of the Vijayanagara Empire.

==Late Middle Ages==
===Rise of Islamic dynasties===

The early medieval period saw the rise of Muslim dynasties in peninsular India. The defeat of the Kakatiyas of Warangal by the forces of the Delhi Sultanate in 1323 CE and the defeat of the Hoysalas in 1333 CE heralded a new chapter in southern Indian history. The grand struggle of the period was between the Vijayanagara Empire with its imperial capital in Vijayanagara and the Bahmani Sultanate based in Gulbarga in present-day Karnataka. By the early 16th century, the Bahmani sultanate fragmented into five different sultanates based in Ahmednagar, Berar, Bidar, Bijapur and Golconda, together called the Deccan Sultanates.

On the southwestern coast of India, a new local economic and political power arose into the vacuum created by the disintegration of Chera power. The Zamorins of Calicut, in collaboration with Arab-Muslim merchants, dominated the maritime trade on Malabar Coast for the next few centuries.

===Vijayanagara Empire===

Differing theories have been proposed regarding the Vijayanagara empire&#x27;s origins. Many historians propose Harihara I and Bukka Raya I, the founders of the empire, were Kannadigas and commanders in the army of the Hoysala Empire stationed in the Tungabhadra region to ward off Muslim invasions from the Northern India. Others claim that they were Telugu people first associated with the Kakatiya kingdom who took control of the northern parts of the Hoysala Empire during its decline. Irrespective of their origin, historians agree the founders were supported and inspired by Vidyaranya, a saint at the Sringeri monastery to fight the Muslim invasions of southern India. Writings by foreign travelers during the late medieval era combined with recent excavations in the Vijayanagara principality have uncovered much-needed information about the empire&#x27;s history, fortifications, scientific developments and architectural innovations.

Before the early 14th-century rise of the Vijayanagara Empire, the Indian-Hindu states of the Deccan, the Yadava Empire of Devagiri, the Kakatiya Kingdom of Warangal, the Pandyan Empire of Madurai, and the tiny kingdom of Kampili had been repeatedly invaded by Muslims from the north, and by 1336 they had all been defeated by Alauddin Khalji and Muhammad bin Tughluq, the Sultans of Delhi. The Hoysala Empire was the sole remaining Hindu state in the path of the Islamic invasion. After the death of Hoysala monarch Veera Ballala III during a battle against the Sultan of Madurai in 1343, the Hoysala Empire merged with the growing Vijayanagara empire.
In the first two decades after the founding of the empire, Harihara I gained control over most of the area south of the Tungabhadra river and earned the title of &quot;Purvapaschima Samudradhishavara&quot; (&quot;master of the eastern and western seas&quot;). By 1374 Bukka Raya I, successor to Harihara I, had defeated the chiefdom of Arcot, the Reddys of Kondavidu, the Sultan of Madurai and gained control over Goa in the west and the Tungabhadra-Krishna River doab in the north. The original capital was in the principality of Anegondi on the northern banks of the Tungabhadra River in today&#x27;s Karnataka. It was later moved to nearby Vijayanagara on the river&#x27;s southern banks during the reign of Bukka Raya I.

With the Vijayanagara Kingdom now imperial in stature, Harihara II, the second son of Bukka Raya I, further consolidated the empire beyond the Krishna River and brought the whole of southern India under the Vijayanagara umbrella. The next emperor, Deva Raya I, emerged successful against the Gajapatis of Odisha and undertook important works of fortification and irrigation. Deva Raya II (called &quot;Gajabetekara&quot;) succeeded to the throne in 1424 and was possibly the most capable of the Sangama emperors. He quelled rebelling feudal lords as well as the Zamorin of Calicut and Quilon in the south. He conquered the island of Lanka and became overlord of the kings of Burma at Pegu and Tanasserim. The empire was in decline in the late 15th century until the serious attempts by general Saluva Narasimha Deva Raya in 1485 and by general Tuluva Narasa Nayaka in 1491 to reconsolidate the empire.
After nearly two decades of conflict with rebellious chieftains, the empire eventually came under the rule of Krishna Deva Raya, the son of Tuluva Narasa Nayaka.
In the following decades the Vijayanagara empire dominated all of southern India and fought off invasions from the five established Deccan Sultanates. The empire reached its peak during the reign of Krishna Deva Raya when Vijayanagara armies were consistently victorious. The empire annexed areas formerly under the Sultanates in the northern Deccan and the territories in the eastern Deccan, including Kalinga, while simultaneously maintaining control over all its subordinates in the south. Many important monuments were either completed or commissioned during the reign of Krishna Deva Raya.

Krishna Deva Raya was succeeded by his younger brother Achyuta Deva Raya in 1529 and in 1542 by Sadashiva Raya while the real power lay with Aliya Rama Raya, the son-in-law of Krishna Deva Raya, whose relationship with the Deccan Sultans who allied against him has been debated.

The sudden capture and beheading of Aliya Rama Raya in 1565 at the Battle of Talikota by his own Muslim generals, against an alliance of the Deccan sultanates, after a seemingly easy victory for the Vijayanagara armies, created havoc and confusion in the Vijayanagara ranks, which were then completely routed. The Sultanates&#x27; army later plundered Hampi, razed and reduced the imperial capital to the ruinous state in which it remains; it was never re-occupied. Tirumala Deva Raya, Rama Raya&#x27;s younger brother who was the sole surviving commander, left Vijayanagara for Penukonda with vast amounts of treasure on the back of 1500 elephants.

The empire went into a slow decline regionally, although trade with the Portuguese continued, and the British were given a land grant for the establishment of Madras. Tirumala Deva Raya was succeeded by his son Sriranga I later followed by Venkata II who was the last monarch of Vijayanagara empire, made his capital Chandragiri and Vellore, repulsed more invasions from the Deccan Sultanates and saved Penukonda from being captured.

His successor Rama Deva Raya took power and ruled until 1632, after whose death Venkata III became monarch and ruled for about ten years. The empire was finally conquered by the Sultanates of Bijapur and Golkonda. The largest feudatories of the Vijayanagara empire – the Nayaks of Gandikota, the Mysore Kingdom, Keladi Nayaka, Nayaks of Madurai, Nayaks of Tanjore, Nayakas of Chitradurga and Nayak Kingdom of Gingee palegars of gummanayakanapalya – declared independence and went on to have a significant impact on the history of southern India in the coming centuries. These Nayaka kingdoms lasted into the 18th century while the Mysore Kingdom remained a princely state until Indian Independence in 1947 although they came under the British Raj in 1799 after the death of Tipu Sultan.

=== Kingdom of Kozhikode ===

Historical records regarding the origin of the Samoothiri of Kozhikode is obscure. However, its generally agreed that the Samoothiri were originally the Nair chieftains of Eralnadu region of the Later Chera Kingdom and were known as the Eradis. Eralnadu (Eranad) province was situated in the northern parts of present-day Malappuram district and was landlocked by the Valluvanad and Polanadu in the west. Legends such as &quot;Keralolpathi&quot; tell the establishment of a local ruling family at Nediyiruppu, near present-day Kondotty by two young brothers belonging to the Eradi clan. The brothers, Manikkan and Vikraman were the most trusted generals in the army of the Cheras. M.G.S. Narayanan, a Kerala-based historian, in his book, &quot;Calicut: The City of Truth&quot; states that the Eradi was a favourite of the last Later Chera king and granted him, as a mark of favor, a small tract of land on the sea-coast in addition to his hereditary possessions (Eralnadu province). Eradis subsequently moved their capital to the coastal marshy lands and established the kingdom of Kozhikode They later assumed the title of &quot;Samudrāthiri&quot; (&quot;one who has the sea for his border&quot;) and continued to rule from Kozhikode.

Samoothiri allied with Muslim Arab and Chinese merchants and used most of the wealth from Kozhikode to develop his military power. They became the most powerful king in the Malayalam speaking regions during the Middle Ages. In the 14th century, Kozhikode conquered large parts of central Kerala following the seize of Tirunavaya from Valluvanad, which was under the control of the king of &quot;Perumbadappu Swaroopam&quot;. He was forced to shift his capital (c. CE 1405) further south from Kodungallur to Kochi. In the 15th century, Cochin was reduced in to a vassal state of Kozhikode. The ruler of Kolathunadu (Kannur) had also came under the influence of Zamorin by the end of the 15th century.

At the peak of their reign, the Zamorins of Kozhikode ruled over a region from Kollam (Quilon) in the south to Panthalayini Kollam (Koyilandy) in the north. Ibn Battuta (1342–1347), who visited the city of Kozhikode six times, gives the earliest glimpses of life in the city. He describes Kozhikode as &quot;one of the great ports of the district of Malabar&quot; where &quot;merchants of all parts of the world are found&quot;. The king of this place, he says, &quot;shaves his chin just as the Haidari Fakeers of Rome do... The greater part of the Muslim merchants of this place are so wealthy that one of them can purchase the whole freightage of such vessels put here and fit-out others like them&quot;. Ma Huan (1403 AD), the Chinese sailor part of the Imperial Chinese fleet under Cheng Ho (Zheng He) states the city as a great emporium of trade frequented by merchants from around the world. He makes note of the 20 or 30 mosques built to cater to the religious needs of the Muslims, the unique system of calculation by the merchants using their fingers and toes (followed to this day), and the matrilineal system of succession. Abdur Razzak (1442–43), Niccolò de&#x27; Conti (1445), Afanasy Nikitin (1468–74), Ludovico di Varthema (1503–1508), and Duarte Barbosa witnessed the city as one of the major trading centres in the Indian subcontinent where traders from different parts of the world could be seen.

The emperor Deva Raya II (r. 1424 – 1446) of the Vijayanagara Empire conquered about the whole of present-day state of Kerala in the 15th century. He defeated the Zamorin of Kozhikode, as well as the ruler of Kollam around 1443. Fernão Nunes says that the Zamorin had to pay tribute to the king of Vijayanagara Empire. Later Kozhikode and Venad seem to have rebelled against their Vijayanagara overlords, but Deva Raya II quelled the rebellion. As the Vijayanagara power diminished over the next fifty years, the Zamorin of Kozhikode again rose to prominence in Kerala. He built a fort at Ponnani in 1498.

=== Kingdom of Venad ===
Venad was a kingdom in the south west tip of Kerala, which acted as a buffer between Cheras and Pandyas. Until the end of the 11th century, it was a small principality in the Ay Kingdom. The &quot;Ays&quot; were the earliest ruling dynasty in southern Kerala, who, at their zenith, ruled over a region from Nagercoil in the south to Thiruvananthapuram in the north. Their capital was at Kollam. A series of attacks by the Pandyas between the 7th and 8th centuries caused the decline of Ays although the dynasty remained powerful until the beginning of the 10th century. When Ay power diminished, Venad became the southernmost principality of the Second Chera Kingdom Invasion of Cholas into Venad caused the destruction of Kollam in 1096. However, the Chera capital, Mahodayapuram, fell in the subsequent attack, which compelled the Chera king, Rama varma Kulasekara, to shift his capital to Kollam. Thus, Rama Varma Kulasekara, the last king of Chera dynasty, is probably the founder of the Venad royal house, and the title of Chera kings, &quot;Kulasekara&quot;, was thenceforth adopted by the rulers of Venad. The end of Second Chera dynasty in the 12th century marks the independence of the Venad. The Venadu King then also was known as Venadu Mooppil Nayar.

In the second half of the 12th century, two branches of the Ay Dynasty: Thrippappur and Chirava, merged into the Venad family and established the tradition of designating the ruler of Venad as Chirava Moopan and the heir-apparent as &quot;Thrippappur Moopan&quot;. While Chrirava Moopan had his residence at Kollam, the Thrippappur Moopan resided at his palace in Thrippappur, north of Thiruvananthapuram, and was vested with the authority over the temples of Venad kingdom, especially the Sri Padmanabhaswamy temple. The most powerful kingdom of Kerala during the colonial period, Travancore, was developed through the expansion of Venad by Mahahrajah Marthanda Varma, a member of the Thrippappur branch of the Ay Dynasty who ascended to the throne in the 18th century.

===Portuguese discovery of the sea route to India===
The maritime spice trade monopoly in the Indian Ocean stayed with the Arabs during the High and Late Middle Ages. However, the dominance of Middle East traders was challenged in the European Age of Discovery. After Vasco Da Gama&#x27;s arrival in Kappad Kozhikode in 1498, the Portuguese began to dominate eastern shipping, and the spice-trade in particular. Following the discovery of sea route from Europe to Malabar in 1498, the Portuguese began to expand their territories and ruled the seas between Ormus and the Malabar Coast and south to Ceylon.

Vasco da Gama was sent by the King of Portugal Dom Manuel I and landed at Kozhikode in 1497–1499. The Samoothiri Maharaja of Kozhikode permitted the Portuguese to trade with his subjects. Their trade in Kozhikode prospered with the establishment of a factory and fort in his territory. However, Portuguese attacks on Arab properties in his jurisdiction provoked the Samoothiri and finally led to conflict.

The Portuguese took advantage of the rivalry between the Samoothiri and Rajah of Kochithey allied with Kochi and when Francisco de Almeida was appointed Viceroy of Portuguese India in 1505, he established his headquarters at Kochi. During his reign, the Portuguese managed to dominate relations with Kochi and established a number of fortresses along the Malabar Coast. Nonetheless, the Portuguese suffered severe setbacks due to attacks by Samoothiri Maharaja&#x27;s forces, especially naval attacks under the leadership of admirals of Kozhikode known as Kunjali Marakkars, which compelled them to seek a treaty. The Kunjali Marakkars are credited with organizing the first naval defense of the Indian coast. 

The Portuguese influence got weakened in Kerala when the Zamorin defeated them with the help of Dutch East India Company in the early 17th century. In 1664, the municipality of Fort Kochi was established by Dutch Malabar, making it the first municipality in the Indian subcontinent, which got dissolved when the Dutch authority got weaker in the 18th century. The Dutch Malabar (1661–1795) in turn were weakened by their constant battles with Marthanda Varma of the Travancore Royal Family, and were defeated at the Battle of Colachel in 1741, resulting in the complete eclipse of Dutch power in Malabar. The Treaty of Mavelikkara was signed by the Dutch and Travancore in 1753, according to which the Dutch were compelled to detach from all political involvements in the region.

In the meantime, Marthanda Varma annexed many smaller northern kingdoms through military conquests, resulting in the rise of Travancore to a position of preeminence in Kerala. Travancore became the most dominant state in Kerala by defeating the powerful Zamorin of Kozhikode in the Battle of Purakkad in 1763. The region of Mahé came under French control by the 18th century CE.

===Nayak kingdoms===
Vijayangara empire had established military and administrative governors called Nayakas to rule in the various territories of the empire. After the demise of the Vijayanagara empire, the local governors declared their independence and started their rule. The Nayak of Madurai, Nayaks of Tanjore, Keladi Nayakas of Shimoga, Nayakas of Chitradurga and Kingdom of Mysore were the most prominent of them. Raghunatha Nayak (1600–1645) was the greatest of the Tanjavur Nayaks. Raghunatha Nayak encouraged trade and permitted a Danish settlement in 1620 at Danesborg at Tarangambadi. This laid the foundation of future European involvement in the affairs of the country. The success of the Dutch inspired the English to seek trade with Thanjavur, which was to lead to far-reaching repercussions. Vijaya Raghava (1631–1675 CE) was the last of the Thanjavur Nayaks. Nayaks reconstructed some of the oldest temples in the country and their contributions can be seen even today. Nayaks expanded the existing temples with large pillared halls, and tall gateway towers was a striking feature in the religious architecture of this period. Kantheerava Narasaraja Wodeyar and Tipu Sultan from the Kingdom of Mysore, Madhakari Nayaka of Chitradurga Nayaka clan and Venkatappa Nayaka of Keladi dynasty are the most famous among the post Vijayanagara rulers from Kannada country.

In Madurai, Thirumalai Nayak was the most famous Nayak ruler. He patronised art and architecture creating new structures and expanding the existing landmarks in and around Madurai. His landmark buildings are the Meenakshi Temple Gopurams and Thirumalai Nayak Palace in Madurai. On Thirumalai Nayak&#x27;s death in 1659 CE, other notable ruler was Rani Mangammal. Shivaji Bhonsle, the great Maratha Ruler, invaded the south, as did Chikka Deva Raya of Mysore and other Muslim Rulers, resulting in chaos and instability and the Madurai Nayak Kingdom collapsed in 1736 following internal strife.

The Tanjavur Nayaks ruled till the late 17th century until their dynasty was put to an end by Madurai Rulers, and the Marathas grabbing the opportunity to install their ruler. The Tanjavur Nayak kings were notable for their contribution to Arts and Telugu literature.

===Maratha Empire===
The Maratha Empire or the Maratha Confederacy was an Indian imperial power that existed from 1674 to 1818. At its peak, the empire covered much of the subcontinent, encompassing a territory of over 2.8 million km².

The Marathas were a yeoman Hindu warrior group from the western Deccan (present day Maharashtra) that rose to prominence by establishing &#x27;Hindawi Swarajya&#x27;. According to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;: The Maratha group of castes is a largely rural class of peasant cultivators, landowners, and soldiers. The Marathas became prominent in the 17th century under the leadership of Shivaji Bhosale who revolted against the Bijapur Sultanate, and carved out a rebel territory with Raigad as his stronghold. Known for their mobility, the Marathas were able to consolidate their territory during the Deccan Wars against the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb and, later in time, controlled a large part of India.

Shahu, a grandson of Chhatrapati Shivaji, was released by the Mughals after the death of Aurangzeb. Following a brief struggle with his aunt Tarabai, Shahu became ruler. During this period, he appointed Balaji Vishwanath Bhat and later his descendants as the Deshasth Peshwas (Warriors) or the prime ministers of the Maratha Empire. After the death of the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb, the empire expanded greatly under the rule of the Peshwas. The empire at its peak stretched from Tamil Nadu in the south Tanjavur of Tamil Nadu, to Peshawar(modern-day Khyber Pakhtunkhwa) in the north, and Bengal and Andaman Islands in east. The rise of Maratha military power under Chatrapathi Shivaji and his heirs in the immediate north of what is today considered South India had a profound influence on the political situation of South India, with Maratha control quickly extending as far east as Ganjam and as far south as Thanjavur. Following the death of Aurangzeb, Mughal power withered, and South Indian rulers gained autonomy from Delhi. The Wodeyar kingdom of Mysore, which was originally in tribute to Vijayanagara and gained in strength over the next few decades, subsequently emerging as the dominant power in the southern part of South India. The Asaf Jahis of Hyderabad controlled the territory north and east of Mysore, while the Marathas controlled portions of Karnataka. By the close of the &quot;medieval&quot; period, most of South India was either autonomy under Maratha ruled directly from, or under tribute to the Nayak dynasty or Wodeyars.

=== Kingdom of Mysore (Mysuru) ===
The Kingdom of Mysore was a realm in southern India, traditionally believed to have been founded in 1399 in the vicinity of the modern city of Mysore. From 1799 until 1950, it was a princely state, until 1947 in a subsidiary alliance with British India. It then became Mysore State (later enlarged and renamed to Karnataka) with its ruler remaining as Rajapramukh until 1956, when he became the first Governor of the reformed state.

The kingdom, which was founded and ruled for most part by the Hindu Wodeyar family, initially served as a vassal state of the Vijayanagara Empire. The 17th century saw a steady expansion of its territory and during the rule of Narasaraja Wodeyar I and Chikka Devaraja Wodeyar, the kingdom annexed large expanses of what is now southern Karnataka and parts of Tamil Nadu to become a powerful state in the southern Deccan. During a brief Muslim rule, the kingdom shifted to a Sultanate style of administration.

During this time, it came into conflict with the Marathas, the Nizam of Hyderabad, the Kingdom of Travancore and the British, which culminated in the four Anglo-Mysore Wars. Success in the first Anglo-Mysore war and a stalemate in the second was followed by defeat in the third and the fourth. Following Tipu&#x27;s death in the fourth war in the siege of Seringapatam (1799), large parts of his kingdom were annexed by the British, which signalled the end of a period of Mysorean hegemony over South India. The British restored the Wodeyars to their throne by way of a subsidiary alliance and the diminished Mysore was transformed into a princely state. The Wodeyars continued to rule the state until Indian independence in 1947, when Mysore acceded to the Union of India.

Even as a princely state, Mysore came to be counted among the more developed and urbanised regions of India. This period (1799–1947) also saw Mysore emerge as one of the important centres of art and culture in India. The Mysore kings were not only accomplished exponents of the fine arts and men of letters, they were enthusiastic patrons as well, and their legacies continue to influence rocket science, music, and art even today.

==Modern history==
===Colonial period===

In the middle of the 18th century, the French and the British East India company initiated a protracted struggle for military control of South India. The period was marked by shifting alliances between the two East India companies and the local powers, mercenary armies employed by all sides, and general anarchy in South India. Cities and forts changed hands many times, and soldiers were primarily remunerated through loot. The four Anglo-Mysore Wars and the three Anglo-Maratha Wars saw Mysore, the Marathas and Hyderabad aligning themselves in turns with either the British or the French. Eventually, British power in alliance with Hyderabad prevailed and Mysore was absorbed as a princely state within British India. The Nizam of Hyderabad sought to retain his autonomy through diplomacy rather than open war with the British. The Maratha Empire that stretched across large swathes of central and northern India was broken up, with most of it annexed by the British.

===British South India===
South India during the British colonial rule was divided into the Madras Presidency and Hyderabad, Mysore, Thiruvithamcoore (also known as Travancore), Cochin, Vizianagaram and a number of other minor princely states. The Madras Presidency was ruled directly by the British, while the rulers of the princely states enjoyed considerable internal autonomy. British Residents were stationed in the capitals of the important states to supervise and report on the activities of the rulers. British troops were stationed in cantonments near the capitals to prevent rebellion. The rulers of these states accepted the principle of paramountcy of the British Crown. The larger princely states issued their own currency and built their own railroads—with non-standard gauges which would be incompatible with their neighbors. The cultivation of coffee and tea was introduced to the mountainous regions of South India during the British period, and both remain important cash crops.

===After independence===
On 15 August 1947, the former British India achieved independence as the new dominions of India and Pakistan. The rulers of India&#x27;s princely states acceded to the government of India between 1947 and 1950, and South India was organized into a number of new states. Most of South India was included in Madras state, which included the territory of the former Madras Presidency together with the princely states of Banganapalle, Pudukkottai, and Sandur. The other states in South India were Coorg (the erstwhile Coorg province of British India), Mysore State (the former princely state of Mysore) and Travancore-Cochin, formed from the merger of the princely states of Travancore and Cochin. The former princely state of Hyderabad became Hyderabad State, and erstwhile Bombay Presidency became Bombay State.

In 1953, the Jawaharlal Nehru government yielded to intense pressure from the northern Telugu-speaking districts of Madras State, and allowed them to vote to create India&#x27;s first linguistic state. Andhra State was created on 1 November 1953 from the northern districts of Madras State, with its capital in Kurnool. Increasing demands for reorganisation of the patchwork of India&#x27;s states resulted in the formation of a national States Reorganisation Commission. Based on the commission&#x27;s recommendations, the Parliament of India enacted the States Reorganisation Act of 1956, which reorganized the boundaries of India&#x27;s states along linguistic lines. Andhra State was renamed Andhra Pradesh, and enlarged by the addition of Telugu-speaking region of Telangana, formerly part of Hyderabad State. Mysore State was enlarged by the addition of Coorg and the Kannada-speaking districts of southwestern Hyderabad State and southern Bombay State. The new Malayalam-speaking state of Kerala was created by the merger of Travancore-Cochin with Malabar and Kasargod districts of Madras State. Madras State, which after 1956 included the Tamil-majority regions of South India, changed its name to Tamil Nadu in 1968, and Mysore State was renamed Karnataka in 1972. Portuguese India, which included Goa, was annexed by India in 1961, and Goa became a state in 1987. The enclaves of French India were ceded to India in the 1950s, and the southern four were organised into the union territory of Puducherry.

<doc id="761455" wikidata="Q5527471" url="?curid=761455" title="Gator Bowl Stadium">
<text>The Gator Bowl was an American football stadium located in Jacksonville, Florida. Originally built in 1927, all but a small portion of the facility was razed in 1994 in preparation for the inaugural season of the Jacksonville Jaguars, an NFL expansion team that began play in 1995. The reconstructed stadium became Jacksonville Municipal Stadium, now known as EverBank Stadium. The old stadium and its replacement have hosted the Gator Bowl, a post-season college football bowl game, since its inception in 1946. It also hosted the Florida–Georgia game, an annual college football rivalry game between the University of Florida and the University of Georgia, and was home to several professional sports teams, including the Jacksonville Sharks and Jacksonville Express of the World Football League (WFL), the Jacksonville Tea Men soccer team, and the Jacksonville Bulls of the United States Football League.

==Origins==
Jacksonville&#x27;s first football venue was built in 1927 and 1928 with a seating capacity of 7,600. Known as Fairfield Stadium, its primary purpose was to serve as home field for Jacksonville&#x27;s three new high schools – Lee, Jackson and Landon. At the opening of the stadium, Florida Governor John W. Martin called the stadium &quot;the best place in Florida to watch a football game!&quot;

On January 1, 1946, the stadium received national attention when it hosted the first Gator Bowl game. The stadium was expanded to 16,000 seats in 1948, and the structure was renamed the Gator Bowl. Prior to the 1949 game, the seating capacity was expanded to 36,058, at which it remained until 1957.

==College and professional sports tenants==
The stadium was home to the World Football League&#x27;s Jacksonville Sharks in 1974 and the Jacksonville Express in 1975. It was the home of a North American Soccer League team, the Jacksonville Tea Men from 1981 to 1984 and then a United States Football League team, the Jacksonville Bulls from 1984 to 1985.

The stadium was the site of the Gator Bowl from 1949 to 1993. It also hosted the annual Florida–Georgia game between the University of Georgia and the University of Florida college football teams from 1933 to 1993. The 1950 Senior Bowl, the first game in that bowl&#x27;s history, was also played at the stadium.

The Gator Bowl hosted the 1968 and 1969 AFL All-Star Games.

==The Beatles at the Gator Bowl==
The Beatles played a concert at the Gator Bowl on their first American Tour on September 11, 1964. When the Beatles found out that the concert was going to be racially segregated and the Black audience degraded, they refused to play there unless they allowed the audience to be desegregated, as Black folk had the freedom to sit where they liked in Europe.

Paul McCartney went on record about their disapproval of the situation, and their lack of understanding of segregation in the first place, while John Lennon said, &quot;We never play to segregated audiences and we aren&#x27;t going to start now. I&#x27;d sooner lose our appearance money.&quot; After city officials relented, the band played to an integrated audience.

The concert was held the day after Hurricane Dora struck St. Augustine and Jacksonville; most of Jacksonville was without electricity and power was not restored for several days. Despite the hurricane, 23,000 fans attended, paying $4 and $5 for tickets. During the concert, Ringo Starr&#x27;s drumkit was nailed to the stage because of the 45 mph winds.

==Near-total demolition==
The historic structure was almost entirely razed in 1994, as part of a massive remodeling effort which essentially built a new stadium. The new stadium was renamed Jacksonville Municipal Stadium (currently named EverBank Stadium). Almost none of the original infrastructure remains, except for the west upper deck (which had been added in 1982) and the ramping system. While Jacksonville Municipal Stadium was being constructed, the Florida–Georgia game alternated between the two schools&#x27; home stadiums, with Florida&#x27;s Ben Hill Griffin Stadium in Gainesville hosting in 1994 and Georgia&#x27;s Sanford Stadium hosting in 1995. The 1994 Gator Bowl was also held in Gainesville. Both games returned to Jacksonville the following season.

<text>Sir Hugh Owen (14 January 1804 – 20 November 1881) was a pioneer of higher education in Wales. He was the main founder of the University College of Wales at Aberystwyth.

==Life==
He was born in Llangeinwen, on Anglesey, and moved to London at the age of 21 to work as a solicitor&#x27;s clerk. He went to work for the Poor Law Commission in 1836, eventually becoming its Chief Clerk in 1853.

Owen became involved in the British and Foreign School Society in London and in 1843 published an open letter to the people of Wales, advocating the need to establish British and Foreign schools in Wales. As a non-conformist he supported the idea of non-denominational day schools. In 1843 he was instrumental in the appointing of an agent for the British and Foreign schools Society in North Wales, and then in South Wales at a later date.

In 1846 Owen became honorary secretary of the Cambrian Educational Society and published another letter advocating the establishment of schools in Wales. His campaign led to the establishment of a number of schools, but highlighted another problem: a shortage of trained teachers. In 1856 he was one of the founder member of a movement to establish the Normal College at Bangor for teacher training. His vision included another teacher training college in South Wales, one specifically for women in Swansea and a university for Wales. In 1863 a committee was formed to raise the funds to establish a University for Wales in Aberystwyth. In 1867 the Committee were able to buy the old Castle Hotel cheaply and by 1872 the University opened. It was not financially stable and Hugh Owen retired in order to raise funds, to clear the debt, and secure the future of the University.

Owen was briefly a member of the London School Board, elected to fill a casual vacancy in April 1872, he stood down at the November 1873 school board elections.

Owen saw the need to improve the education in intermediate schools, so that there were suitably qualified entrants for the new University. At the National Eisteddfod in Caernarfon in 1880, he read a paper to members of the Society of Cymmrodorion on &quot;Intermediate Education in Ireland and Secondary Education in Wales&quot;. This eventually led to the passing of the Welsh Intermediate Education Act of 1889.

Owen was knighted in August 1881 but died 3 months later.

==Legacy==

The main library at Aberystwyth University is named after Hugh Owen, as is Ysgol Syr Hugh Owen, a secondary school in Caernarfon (&#x27;ysgol&#x27; is the Welsh word for school).

The Learned Society of Wales awards the Hugh Owen Medal annually to celebrate outstanding educational research in Wales. The medal is supported by Welsh Government and is awarded in recognition of significant contributions to educational research, or the application of research to produce significant innovations in education policy or professional educational practice in Wales.

<text>Johannes &quot;Hans&quot; Friedrich Leopold von Seeckt (22 April 1866 – 27 December 1936) was a German military officer who served as Chief of Staff to August von Mackensen and was a central figure in planning the victories Mackensen achieved for Germany in the east during the First World War.

During the years of the Weimar Republic he was chief of staff for the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; from 1919 to 1920 and commander in chief of the German Army from 1920 until he resigned in October 1926. During this period he engaged in the reorganization of the army and laid the foundation for the doctrine, tactics, organization, and training of the German army. By the time Seeckt left the German Army in 1926 the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; had a clear, standardized operational doctrine, as well as a precise theory on the future methods of combat which greatly influenced the military campaigns fought by the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; during the first half of the Second World War. While Seeckt undertook multiple programs to get around the military limitations imposed by the Treaty of Versailles which formally ended the state of war between Germany and the Allied Powers after World War I, he has been criticized for failing to expand the reserves of officers and trained men available to the army, the main obstacle to rearmament during the Republic.

Seeckt served as a member of parliament from 1930 to 1932. From 1933 to 1935 he was repeatedly in China as a military consultant to Chiang Kai-shek in his war against the Chinese Communists and was directly responsible for devising the encirclement campaigns, that resulted in a string of victories against the Chinese Red Army and forced Mao Zedong into a 9,000 km retreat, also known as the Long March.

A large military barracks in Celle was built in 1935 and named after von Seeckt. After the Second World War it was renamed Trenchard Barracks by BAOR as part of the Bergen-Hohne Garrison.

==Early life==
Seeckt was born in Schleswig on 22 April 1866 into an old Pomeranian family, that had been ennobled in the eighteenth century. Though the family had lost its estates, Seeckt was &quot;a thorough-going aristocrat&quot;, and his father was an important general within the German Army, finishing his career as military governor of Posen. Seeckt followed his father into military service, joining the Army in 1885 at the age of 18. He served in the elite Kaiser Alexander Guard Grenadiers, then joined the Prussian General Staff in 1897. In 1913, Seeckt became the Chief of Staff of the III Corps, based in Berlin.

==First World War==

At the outbreak of the First World War, Seeckt held the rank of lieutenant colonel and served as chief of staff for Ewald von Lochow in the German III Corps. On mobilisation, the III Corps was assigned to the 1st Army on the right wing of the forces for the Schlieffen Plan offensive in August 1914 on the Western Front. Early in 1915, after they were attacked by the French near Soissons, Seeckt devised a counterattack that took thousands of prisoners and dozens of guns. He was promoted to colonel on 27 January 1915. In March 1915, he was transferred to the Eastern front to serve as chief of staff to General August von Mackensen of the German 11th Army. He played a major role in the planning and executing of Mackensen&#x27;s highly successful campaigns.

With the 11th Army, Seeckt helped direct the Gorlice–Tarnów Offensive of 2 May – 27 June 1915, where he was credited with engineering Mackensen&#x27;s breakthrough which split the two Russian armies opposing them. The Russians never fully recovered. Here Seeckt implemented a change in handling the thrust of the offensive, pushing reserve formations through breaks in the Russian defenses. This was a break from the established method of securing flanks by advancing along a uniform front, using reserve formations to assist in overcoming strong points. By pressing the reserves forward into the Russian rear areas the Russian positions were destabilized, resulting in a collapse of the Russian defensive line. For his contributions he received the Pour le Mérite, Prussia&#x27;s highest military honor. In June 1915, Seeckt was promoted to the rank of &quot;Generalmajor&quot;. He remained chief of staff to Mackensen, who in the fall of 1915 was controlling Army Group Mackensen or &quot;Heeresgruppe Mackensen&quot;, which included the German 11th Army, the Austro-Hungarian 3rd Army, and the Bulgarian 1st Army, in a renewed campaign in Serbia. As was the case in the Gorlice offensive, Seeckt played a major role in the planning and execution of the operations in Serbia between 6 October and 24 November 1915. The saying spread through the German army &quot;Where Mackensen is, Seeckt is; where Seeckt is, victory is.&quot; For his achievements he was awarded the Oak Leaves to the Pour le Mérite. In June 1916 he became chief of staff for the Austro-Hungarian 7th Army in Galicia, which was fighting desperately to stem the Russian general Brusilov&#x27;s offensive. Next he became chief of staff of the Austro-Hungarian Army Group commanded by Archduke Karl, who later became Emperor, at which point his cousin Archduke Joseph was given command of the Army Group.

In 1917, Seeckt was sent to the Ottoman Empire, a Central Powers ally, to replace Colonel von Schellendorff as Chief of Staff of the Ottoman Army. In choosing Seeckt, Germany was sending a first rate staff officer, but this made little impression on the Turks. The alliance between the Ottoman Empire and Germany was weak. The crumbling Ottoman Empire was enticed to join in the conflict with the promise that a victory would yield them the return of recently lost territories, while Germany hoped the involvement of the Turks would tie down forces of the Entente far from Western Europe. Since the start of the conflict German efforts to influence Ottoman strategy met with limited success. Neither Bronsart nor Seeckt were able to get much consideration for a grand strategy in the Ottoman Empire. Though Enver Pasha would take counsel from the German officers, he would disregard their opinion if it differed from his own. Seeckt wrote that &quot;I... meditate, telegraph, speak, write and calculate in the Turkish service and in Germany&#x27;s interest&quot;.

A common view in the German high command was that internal division in a nation undermines a nation&#x27;s ability to successfully conduct a military campaign. Seeckt held this view, even to the point of supporting the leadership of the Ottoman Empire as it conducted the genocide of Armenians along its eastern border in 1915. The brutal slaughter met with an outcry from German civilians, churchmen and statesmen. When Seeckt arrived in Turkey two years later he argued such actions were a necessary measure to save Turkey from &quot;internal decay&quot;. In a July 1918 message Seeckt replied to inquiries from Berlin by stating &quot;It is an impossible state of affairs to be allied with the Turks and to stand up for the Armenians. In my view, any consideration, Christian, sentimental or political, must be eclipsed by its clear necessity for the war effort.&quot; Seeckt also supported the Committee of Union and Progress, a group of army officers who had taken power in Turkey and were attempting to modernize the Ottoman state and society to better support the Ottoman army&#x27;s effort to win the war.

Following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire in October 1918, Seeckt helped to organize the escape of the Three Pashas and returned to Germany in November 1918. Though the Armistice took effect in November 1918, the British continued to blockade German ports, leading to widespread starvation. Seeckt was initially sent to the east to organize the orderly withdrawal of German troops there. In the spring of 1919 he was sent to represent the German General Staff at the peace conference in Paris. He tried unsuccessfully to persuade the Allies to limit their demands for the disarmament of Germany. Seeckt sought to keep a force of 200,000 men, which was denied. In June 1919 the Germans submitted to the terms of the Treaty of Versailles.

== Development of the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; ==
The Treaty of Versailles greatly restricted the size of the German military and disbanded the General Staff of the Imperial German Army. It also prohibited the German army from using or procuring modern weapons. Seeckt was appointed Chairman of the new Military Committee charged with reorganizing the German army in accordance with the provisions laid down in the Treaty. It fell to Seeckt to build the new &quot;Reichswehr&quot; within the strict restrictions imposed on the armed forces. He was the last man to serve as Chief of the General Staff and on 11 October 1919, he became the effective chief of the &quot;Reichswehr&quot;.

In a memo written during 1919, Seeckt expressed anger which was widely held by other German officers over the terms of the Treaty of Versailles. He also remarked that he was against the idea of Germany joining the League of Nations, as the notion of peace being maintained by such an organization was, in his opinion, unlikely. Though in favor of peace in general, he reasoned that war was a recurring state in human history and that the duty of a German officer was to be prepared to fight the next war, if and when that came to pass. Seeckt argued:My own training in history prevents me from seeing in the idea of permanent peace anything more than a dream whereby it remains an open question whether one can consider it, in Moltke&#x27;s phrase, a &#x27;good dream&#x27; or not.

Seeckt believed that war was inevitable, and that a future Germany would either defend itself or be at the mercy of its neighbors. He worked to ensure the German army maintained the defiant, offensive spirit that was its tradition. Though clear in stating that the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; was not looking for conflict, he did not believe that men could be stopped from &quot;thinking like men&quot;, and argued that one of the primary duties of a German officer was to keep his men and the population at large prepared to defend Germany, saying:German officers, and especially members of the general staff, have never sought a fight for its own sake or been war-mongers. And they should not do so now. But they should never forget the great deeds achieved by German warriors. Keeping the memory of them alive in ourselves and our people is a sacred duty. For then neither officers nor the people will lapse into enfeebling illusions of peace, but will remain aware that in the moment of truth only personal and national stature counts. If fate once again calls the German people to arms, and who can doubt that day will come, then officers should not have to call on a nation of weaklings, but of strong men ready to take up familiar and trusted weapons. The form these weapons take is not important as long as they are wielded by hands of steel and hearts of iron. So let us do our utmost to ensure that on that future day there is no lack of such hearts and hands. Let us strive tirelessly to strengthen our own bodies and minds and those of our fellow Germans ... It is the duty of every member of the general staff to make the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; not only a reliable pillar of the state, but also a school for the leaders of the nation. Beyond the army itself, every officer will sow the seed of manly attitudes throughout the population.

The Treaty of Versailles limited the Army to 100,000 men, only 4,000 of whom could be officers. As the commander in chief of the new &quot;Reichswehr&quot;, Seeckt wanted to ensure that the best officers were retained. The &quot;Reichswehr&quot; was designed as a cadre force that could be expanded if need be. Officers and NCOs were trained to be able to command at least at the next higher unit level. At the beginning of World War Two suitable NCOs were commissioned, as the NCOs trained by Seeckt were seen as easily suitable to command much larger units. Almost all of the leaders of the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; in World War II were men that Seeckt had retained in 1919–20.
Seeckt held conservative political views. He was a monarchist who encouraged the retention of traditional links with the old Imperial Army. To this purpose he designated individual companies and squadrons of the new &quot;Reichswehr&quot; as the direct successors of particular regiments of Emperor Wilhelm II&#x27;s army.

Seeckt held stereotypical, derogatory views of most Jewish people. In a letter to his wife, herself partially Jewish, on 19 May 1919, Seeckt wrote about the new Prussian Prime Minister, Paul Hirsch: He is not so bad and is an old parliamentarian. For this post he seems quite unsuitable, especially as a Jew; not only because this is in itself provocative, but because the Jewish talent is purely critical, hence negative and can never help in the construction of a state. This is no good.

Seeckt ignored the Constitution of 1919 which prohibited religious discrimination. He ordered that Jews were not to be accepted into the &quot;Reichswehr&quot;, no matter how qualified they might be.

Seeckt saw the Second Polish Republic as the core of the problems in the east, and believed its existence was incompatible with Germany&#x27;s vital interests. He was in favor of an alliance with the Soviet Union, which along with Germany had also lost territory to Poland. After seeing encouraging signs from the newly established War Commissar&#x27;s Office of Leon Trotsky, Seeckt sent out his close friend Enver Pasha on a secret mission to Moscow to make contacts with the Soviets. In the summer of 1920, Pasha sent Seeckt a letter from Moscow asking for German arms deliveries to the Soviet Union in exchange for which Trotsky promised to partition Poland with Germany. Seeckt did not hesitate to use military force against attempts by German communists to take power, but his concern over communism did not affect his attitude toward relations with the Soviet Union. Seeckt regarded his informal alliance with the Soviet Union in practical rather than ideological terms. Both nations were weak at the end of the war, and had external threats. In working together, he believed the hand of both nations were strengthened. Seeckt regarded the efforts of General Rüdiger von der Goltz and his &quot;Freikorps&quot; to create an anti-communist, German-dominated state in the Baltic as a ludicrous attempt to turn back the clock. Seeckt was all for seeing Goltz conquer the Baltic states if that was possible, but he was very antagonistic towards Goltz&#x27;s efforts to use his proposed state as a basis for overthrowing the Bolsheviks. Seeckt saw Poland as the main enemy and the Soviet Union as a very useful ally against Poland, so he viewed Goltz&#x27;s anti-Communist schemes with some hostility.

After the Allies sent the German government a list of war criminals to be tried, Seeckt called a conference of Staff Officers and departmental heads on 9 February 1920 and said to them that if the German government either outright refused or couldn&#x27;t successfully reject Allied demands, the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; would oppose this by all means even if this meant the reopening of hostilities. He further said that if the Allies invaded Germany—which he believed they would not—then the German army in the West should retire behind the Weser and the Elbe, as this was where defensive positions had already been built. In the East, German troops would invade Poland and attempt to establish contacts with the Soviet Union, after which they would both march against France and Britain. He added that German war material would now no longer be sold or destroyed and that the army should be reduced on paper only. An Interior Minister of Prussia, Albert Grzesinski, wrote that members of Seeckt&#x27;s staff said that Seeckt desired a military dictatorship, perhaps headed by Gustav Noske.

Many in the military refused to accept the democratic Weimar Republic as legitimate due to its agreement with the terms of the Treaty of Versailles. Under the leadership of Seeckt, an effort was made to insulate the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; from the politics of Germany. Some refer to the Reichswehr as operating as a “state within the state”, meaning it was operating largely outside of the control of the politicians. The heart of Seeckt’s policy was to maintain the power and prestige of the army by avoiding internal dissension. This was most clearly illustrated by Seeckt&#x27;s role during the Kapp Putsch of March 1920. During the &quot;Putsch&quot;, Seeckt disobeyed orders from the Defence Minister Gustav Noske, the Chancellor Gustav Bauer and the &quot;Reich&quot; President Friedrich Ebert to suppress the &quot;putsch&quot;, claiming &quot;There can be no question of sending the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; to fight these people&quot;. Seeckt&#x27;s actions were entirely illegal as under the Weimar constitution, the President was the Supreme Commander in Chief, and moreover Seeckt had violated the &quot;Reichswehreid&quot; oath, which committed the military to defending the republic. Seeckt ordered the military to disregard Ebert&#x27;s orders to defend the republic, and instead assumed a stance of apparent neutrality, which in effect meant siding with the Kapp &quot;putsch&quot; by depriving the government of the means of defending itself. Seeckt had no loyalty to the Weimar republic, and his sympathies were entirely with the Kapp &quot;putsch&quot;, but at the same time, Seeckt regarded the &quot;putsch&quot; as premature, and chose to sit on the fence to see how things developed rather than committing himself to the &quot;putsch&quot;. As a result of Seeckt&#x27;s refusal to defend the government that he had taken a solemn oath to defend, the government was forced to flee Berlin, which was taken by the Marinebrigade Ehrhardt on the morning of 13 March 1920 without a shot being fired.

The &quot;putsch&quot; failed only after the government called for a general strike, which shut down the German economy. Once it had become clear that the regime established in Berlin under the nominal leadership of Wolfgang Kapp could not function on the account of the general strike, Seeckt sent Colonel Wilhelm Heye to meet with General Walther von Lüttwitz, the real leader of the Kapp &quot;putsch&quot;, to inform him that it was time to end the &quot;putsch&quot;. Ludendorf&#x27;s right-hand man, Colonel Max Bauer asked Seeckt to become dictator; he refused contemptuously. At the same time, Seeckt showed his sympathy for the &quot;putsch&quot; by arranging with Captain Hermann Ehrhardt that the &quot;Marinebrigade Ehrhardt&quot; should march out of Berlin with all the honors of war, during the course of which march the men of the &quot;Marinebrigade Ehrhardt&quot; fired on jeering Berliners, killing a number of them. Only those few officers and soldiers who had attempted to defend the republic were dismissed. The officers led by Seeckt who had done nothing to defend the republic were allowed to continue with their jobs. Seeckt&#x27;s remark to the leaders of the republic, that &quot;Reichswehr&quot; do not fire on &quot;Reichswehr&quot;&quot;, was controversial. His reserved attitude towards the Weimar Republic is illustrated by a brief conversation held with President Ebert. When asked by Ebert where the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; stood, Seeckt answered &quot;The Reichswehr stands behind me&quot;, and on being asked whether the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; was reliable, Seeckt answered: &quot;I don&#x27;t know if it is reliable, but it obeys my orders!&quot;

From 1920 to 1926 Seeckt held the position of &quot;Chef der Heeresleitung&quot;—in fact if not in name commander of the army of the new Weimar Republic, the &quot;Reichswehr&quot;. In working to build a professional army within and without the confines of the Treaty of Versailles, Seeckt advanced the concept of the army as a &quot;state-within-a-state&quot;. This matched the conditions of the Versailles Treaty which were aimed at creating a long-term professional army with a ceiling of 100,000 volunteers and without significant reserves - a force which would not be able to challenge the much larger French Army.

In 1921 Seeckt founded the &quot;Arbeitskommandos&quot; (Work Commandos) commanded by Major Bruno Ernst Buchrucker, which was a command of soldiers thinly disguised as a labour group intended to assist with civilian projects, whereas its actual purpose was to provide a way for the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; to circumvent the restriction in the Treaty of Versailles which limited Germany&#x27;s army to 100,000 men. The control of the &quot;Arbeirakommandos&quot; was exercised through a group comprising Fedor von Bock, Kurt von Schleicher, Eugen Ott and Kurt von Hammerstein-Equord. What came to be known as the Black &quot;Reichswehr&quot;&quot; became infamous for its practice of using &quot;Feme&quot; murders to punish &quot;traitors&quot; who, for example, revealed the locations of weapons&#x27; stockpiles or names of members. During the trials of some of those charged with the murders, prosecutors alleged that the killings were ordered by the officers from Bock&#x27;s group. The journalist Carl von Ossietzky wrote: &quot;... [the accused] did nothing but carry out the orders given him, and that certainly Colonel von Bock, and probably Colonel von Schleicher and General Seeckt, should be sitting in the dock beside him.&quot;

Several times Bock and his officers denied in court that the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; ministry had had any knowledge the &quot;Black &quot;Reichswehr&quot;&quot; or the murders they had committed. In a secret letter sent to the President of the German Supreme Court, which was trying a member of the Black &quot;Reichswehr&quot; for murder, Seeckt admitted that the Black &quot;Reichswehr&quot; was controlled by the &quot;Reichswehr&quot;, and argued that the murders were justified by the struggle against Versailles, so the court should acquit the defendant. 

In 1921, Seeckt had Kurt von Schleicher of &quot;Sondergruppe R&quot; negotiate the arrangements with Leonid Krasin for German aid to the Soviet arms industry. In September 1921, at a secret meeting in Schleicher&#x27;s apartment, the details of an arrangement for German financial and technological aid for building up the Soviet arms industry in exchange for Soviet support in helping Germany evade the disarmament clauses of the Treaty of Versailles were agreed to. Schleicher created a shell corporation known as the GEFU (&quot;Gesellschaft zur Förderung gewerblicher Unternehmungen&quot;-Company for the promotion of industrial enterprise) that funneled 75 million &quot;Reichsmark&quot; into the Soviet arms industry. The GEFU founded factories in the Soviet Union for the production of aircraft, tanks, artillery shells and poison gas. The arms contracts of GEFU in the Soviet Union ensured that Germany did not fall behind in military technology in the 1920s despite being disarmed by Versailles, and laid the covert foundations in the 1920s for the overt rearmament of the 1930s.
Seeckt saw France, with its large continental army, as the main threat to Germany, and the opponent in a future war. He saw Poland as a vassal state of France. He advocated strengthening Germany by whatever means were available, including reaching out to the Soviet Union. He believed England would eventually be compelled to fight a war against its historic enemy, France, and that when such an event occurred England would be looking for an ally on the continent to carry the burden of a land war. He felt a strong Germany would be a more attractive ally than a weak one. The support between Germany and the Soviets was seen in this light, as an agreement that would add to the strength of both nations. He did not believe such an agreement would alienate England. Though Seeckt was strongly anti-communist and was committed to keeping communism from Germany, that did not mean he would not make deals with the Soviet Union that would help Germany&#x27;s position in the world.

Seeckt&#x27;s policies caused tension with the former Foreign Minister Count Ulrich von Brockdorff-Rantzau, who was to be sent out as the Ambassador to Moscow. Brockdorff-Rantzau was just as committed as Seeckt to the destruction of Versailles, but rather preferred to accomplish that goal through an alliance with Britain. Moreover, Brockdorff-Rantzau feared that a too close rapprochement with the Soviet Union would alienate Britain and drive her into the arms of France. In response, on 11 September 1922, Seeckt sent a memo to Brockdorff-Rantzau entitled &quot;Germany&#x27;s Attitude to the Russian Problem&quot;. Some of Seeckt&#x27;s salient points were:Germany must pursue a policy of action. Every State must do that. The moment it stops pursuing a forward policy it ceases to be a State. An active policy must have a goal and a driving force. For carrying it out it is essential to assess one&#x27;s own strength correctly and at the same time understand the methods and aims of the other powers.The man who bases his political ideas on the weakness of his own country, who sees only dangers, or whose only desire is to remain stationary, is not pursuing a policy at all, and should be kept far away from the scene of activity.The years 1814/15 saw France in complete military and political collapse, yet no one at the Congress of Vienna followed a more active policy than Talleyrand — to France&#x27;s advantage. Has the world ever seen a greater catastrophe than that suffered by Russia in the last war? Yet with what vigor the Soviet Government recovered, both at home and abroad! Did not the Sick Man of Europe seem to be dead once more and for all, and buried by the Treaty of Sèvres? Yet today, after the victory over Greece, he stands up to England with confidence. He followed an active Turkish policy.Have not Germany&#x27;s first stirrings in active politics, the Treaty of Rapallo, clearly brought her at last nearer to being more respected?This treaty splits opinion into different camps when the Russian problem is considered. The main point about it is &quot;not&quot; its economic value, though that is by no means inconsiderable, but its political achievement. This association between Germany and Russia is the first and almost the only increase in power which we have so far obtained since peace was made. That this association should begin in the field of economics is a natural consequence of the general situation, but its strength lies in the fact that this economic &quot;rapprochement&quot; is preparing the way for the &quot;possibility&quot; of a political and, thus also, a military association. It is beyond a doubt that such a double association would strengthen Germany-and also Russia … The whole policy of reconciliation and appeasement towards France — no matter whether it is pursued by a Stinnes or by General Ludendorff — is hopeless as it aims at political success. The question of orientation towards the West, as far as France is concerned is ruled out … England is drifting towards another historic conflict with France, even through she does not face imminent war. That lurks in the background. A glance at the East is surely sufficient even for those who before Genoa did not wish to use their eyes and ears. The British interests in the Dardanelles, Egypt and India are certainly infinitely more important at the moment than those on the Rhine, and an understanding between Britain and France at Germany&#x27;s expense, that is, a concession by Britain in return for an immediate advantage, is by no means improbable. Yet even such an understanding would be only temporary. The moment is coming, and must come, when Britain will be looking for allies on the Continent. When that moment arrives she will prefer the mercenary who is growing in strength, and will even have to make him stronger.A &quot;rapprochement&quot; between Germany and Russia would not have a decisive influence on Britain&#x27;s attitude either in making a concession to France or in searching for an ally. British policy is ruled by other more compelling motives than anxiety about some far-distant threat from a Russia made strong with the help of Germany...With Poland we come now to the core of the Eastern problem. The existence of Poland is intolerable and incompatible with Germany&#x27;s vital interests. She must disappear and will do so through her own inner weakness and through Russia — with our help. Poland is more intolerable for Russia than for ourselves; Russia can never tolerate Poland. With Poland collapses one of the strongest pillars of the Peace of Versailles, France&#x27;s advance post of power [is lost]. The attainment of this objective must be one of the firmest guiding principles of German policy, as it is capable of achievement — but only through Russia or with her help.Poland can never offer Germany any advantage, either economically, because she is incapable of development, or politically, because she is a vassal state of France. The restoration of the frontier between Russia and Germany is a necessary condition before both sides can become strong. The 1914 frontier between Russia and Germany should be the basis of any understanding between the two countries ...I will touch one or two more objections to the policy demanded towards Russia. Germany today is certainly not in a position to resist France. Our policy should be to prepare the means of doing so in the future. A French advance through Germany to go to the help of Poland would make nonsense from the military point of view, so long as Germany does not voluntarily co-operate. The idea springs from the notions of our 1919 diplomats, and there have been three years of work since then. War on the Rhine between France and Russia is a political bogy. Germany will not be Bolshevized, even by an understanding with Russia on external matters.The German nation, with its Socialist majority, would be averse to a policy of action, which has to reckon with the possibility of war. It must be admitted that the spirit surrounding the Peace Delegation at Versailles has not yet disappeared, and that stupid cry of &#x27;No more war!&#x27; is widely echoed. It is echoed by many bourgeois-pacifist elements, but among the workers, and also among the members of the official Social Democratic Party there are many who are not prepared to eat out of the hands of France and Poland. It is true that there is a widespread and understandable need for peace among the German people. The clearest heads, when considering the pros and cons of war, will be those of the military, but to pursue a policy means to take a lead. In spite of everything, the German people will follow the leader in the struggle for their existence. Our task is to prepare for this struggle, for we shall not be spared it. Seeckt&#x27;s memo won Brockdorff-Rantzau over to his policy.

Seeckt was concerned with strengthening Germany, and after meeting Adolf Hitler for the first time on 11 March 1923 he wrote: &quot;We were one in our aim; only our paths were different&quot;. Of course, Seeckt was not fully aware of what Hitler&#x27;s aims might be. He soon found he had to oppose a number of insurgencies, including the Hitler-Ludendorff-Putsch. Seeckt was aware that the purpose of the insurgencies was to overthrow the government that had accepted the terms of the Treaty and to start a war against France, but he reasoned the result would have led to the destruction of Germany&#x27;s small forces and a French occupation of German territory. On the night of 29–30 September 1923, the Black &quot;Reichswehr&quot; under the leadership of Major Buchrucker attempted a &quot;putsch&quot;. Seeckt was prompt in his response, ordering the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; to crush Buschrucker&#x27;s &quot;putsch&quot; by laying siege to the forts he had seized outside of Berlin. After two days, Buchrucker surrendered. Two months later Seeckt put down Hitler&#x27;s &quot;Putsch&quot; on 8–9 November 1923, insisting that the Bavarian Division of the Reichswehr remain loyal to the state. The British historian John Wheeler-Bennett wrote that Seeckt was loyal to the &quot;Reich&quot;, not the Republic and that ideologically Seeckt sympathized with Erich Ludendorff, Buchrucker and Hitler. Seeckt was only opposed to the Munich Beer Hall &quot;putsch&quot; and Buckrucker&#x27;s &quot;putsch&quot; because the stated aim of the Nazis and the Black &quot;Reichswehr&quot; putschists was to reject the peaceful settlement of the &quot;Ruhrkampf&quot; that had been agreed to in September and instead go to war with France in 1923. Seeckt, knowing the most probable outcome of such war, preferred that the Weimar Republic stay in existence, at least for the moment when painful compromises were necessary. Seeckt strongly opposed the Locarno Treaties which he viewed as appeasement of France and was skeptical of German membership of the League of Nations because he believed it was compromising Germany&#x27;s connections with the Soviet Union. In particular, Seeckt objected to joining the League as one of the conditions for League membership was the commitment not to engage in aggression against other League members, something that put something of a damper on Seeckt&#x27;s plans for aggression against Poland. In a 1925 memo, Seeckt stated: &quot;We must become powerful, and as soon as we have power, we will naturally take back everything we have lost&quot; 

Seeckt made the training standards of the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; the toughest in the world. He trained them in anti-air and anti-tank fighting by creating wooden weapons and staging mock battles under the guise of training the soldiers for reintroduction into civilian life. Seeckt&#x27;s discipline of this small army was quite different from that of past German armies. For instance, rather than the harsh punishments of the Imperial Army, minor offenders were forced to spend off-hour duties lying under a bed and singing old Lutheran hymns. To make the training appear less military, photographs were published of recruits being taught topics like horse anatomy and beekeeping. 

While Seeckt ran multiple schemes to increase the number of reserves these proved largely ineffective. Officers were encouraged to leave regular units and join the reserve. Apart from the labour corps there also were the border guard units from the &quot;Grenzschutz&quot;, which was created in 1921, mostly guarding Germany&#x27;s eastern border, these were equipped with small arms as well as machine guns and received military training. The security units of the &quot;Schutzpolizei&quot; turned out to be the most effective at procuring trained manpower. They were led by former NCOs and officers and were equipped with small arms and armoured cars and given basic military training. During the 1920 the &quot;Grenzschutz&quot; possessed 40,000 and the &quot;Schutzpolizei&quot; at most 70,000 men. The at most 110,000 strong reserves were much smaller than those the German empire had possessed. As a result when the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; went to war in WWII, it had only four classes of officer compared to the 40 of the German imperial army. This was partially because the German officers, including Seeckt, had had a disdain for a levee en masse style organisation, originally stemming from Von Roon&#x27;s ideas on war. 

He was forced to resign on 9 October 1926 because he had invited Prince Wilhelm, the grandson of the former emperor to attend army manoeuvres in the uniform of the old imperial First Foot Guards without first seeking government approval. It created a storm when the republican press publicized the transgression. &quot;Reichswehr&quot; Minister Otto Gessler told President von Hindenburg that Seeckt must resign or he would have to resign himself. He was supported by the cabinet, so Hindenburg asked for Seeckt&#x27;s resignation. In a painful final interview with Seeckt, Hindenburg emphasized that he had to go to keep the government from resigning, not because of his invitation to the prince.

=== Roots of the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; ===
The army that Germany went to war with in 1939 was largely Seeckt&#x27;s creation. The tactics and operational concepts of the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; were the work of Seeckt in the 1920s. In addition, the majority of the senior officers and many of the middle-ranking officers were men that Seeckt had chosen to retain in the &quot;Reichswehr&quot;. Seeckt created 57 different committees to study the last war to provide lessons learned for the next war. Seeckt stated: &quot;It is absolutely necessary to put the experience of the war in a broad light and collect this experience while the impressions won on the battlefield are still fresh and a major portion of the experienced officers are still in leading positions&quot;. The result was the 1921 book &quot;Leadership and Battle with Combined Arms&quot; that outlined the combined arms tactics and operational ideas that went on to serve as the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot;″s doctrine in the Second World War. Seeckt envisioned Germany winning the next war by a series of highly mobile operations featuring combined arms operations of artillery, infantry, armor, and air power working together to concentrate superior firepower to crush the enemy at crucial points. Seeing a significant role for air power in the next war, Seeckt kept a large number of officers in the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; who had experience in air combat. These officers formed the future officers corps of the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; in the 1930s.

==In China==

After failing to gain a seat as a candidate for the Centre Party, Seeckt was elected to the Reichstag as a member of the DVP, serving from 1930 through 1932. In October 1931, Seeckt was a featured speaker at a rally at Bad Harzburg which led to the founding of the Harzburg Front. In the presidential election of 1932 he wrote to his sister, urging her to vote for Hitler. From 1933–1935 he served as an adviser to Chiang Kai-shek and helped to establish a new basis for Sino-German cooperation until 1941. In October 1933, Seeckt arrived in China to head the German military mission. At the time of his arrival, Sino-German relations were in a bad state owing to the racial arrogance of the Germans, and Chiang was considering firing the Germans and bringing in a French military mission. In order to save the military mission, Seeckt ordered the German officers to behave with more tact towards the Chinese and to start showing some respect for Chinese sensibilities. In this way, Seeckt saved Germany&#x27;s position in China.
Seeckt advised Chiang that China would need 60 divisions to form an army, which he proposed to arm with modern weapons and train in the combined arms operations which he had previously used in training the German Army in the 1920s. Seeckt stressed he would need the best Chinese officers to train in modern warfare. His goal was to make the National Revolutionary Army like the army in Germany after the war, a force which could make up for what it lacked in quantity with its high quality of professional soldiers. In addition, Seeckt stressed he wanted an end to regionalism in the Chinese military. The army was to be led by officers who were loyal to Chiang alone, with no regional loyalties. In addition, Seeckt urged Chiang to fortify the lower Yangtze valley, and to adopt policies to industrialize China to gain independence from Western manufacturing. To this end, Seeckt suggested a trade agreement between China and Germany, where Germany would receive minerals needed for weapon manufacture, especially tungsten, and China would be provided with weapons and the industrial machinery needed to make China self-sufficient in producing such weapons. In March 1934, Chiang not only appointed Seeckt as his Chief Military Advisor, but also appointed him as the Deputy Chairman of the Military Affairs Council. In that capacity Seeckt chaired the twice weekly meetings at Nanjing between Chiang and his most senior generals. At a meeting at Mount Lu in 1934, Seeckt&#x27;s plan for 60 divisions was adopted. To create that army, a 10-year plan was adopted. The officers trained by Seeckt were important later in the Chinese resistance to the Japanese invasion of China.

In early 1934, Seeckt advised Chiang that to defeat the Chinese Communists he needed to employ a scorched earth policy, which required building a series of lines and forts around areas controlled by the Communists in the Jiangxi Soviet in order to force the Communist guerrillas to fight in the open, where the superior firepower of the Nationalists would give them an advantage. Following Seeckt&#x27;s advice, in the spring and summer of 1934 the Kuomintang built three thousand &quot;turtle shell&quot; forts linked by a series of roads while at the same time pursuing a scorched earth policy around the forts as part of the Fifth Bandit Extermination Campaign in Jiangxi. It was Seeckt&#x27;s tactics that led to a series of defeats suffered by the Chinese Communists that in October 1934 led to the infamous Long March.

Seeckt died in Berlin on 27 December 1936, and was buried at Invalidenfriedhof.

<doc id="761463" wikidata="Q7249578" url="?curid=761463" title="Proletarian Military Policy">
<text>The Proletarian Military Policy was a policy adopted by the Fourth International in response to World War II. It was an attempt to apply transitional demands such as trade union control of military training and the election of officers to transform what it characterised as an imperialist war into a revolutionary struggle against Nazism.

Alongside his call for an unconditional defence of the Soviet Union, Trotsky outlined the approach to be adopted by Marxists who were conscripted into the military,&quot;We are absolutely in favor of compulsory military training and in the same way for conscription. Conscription? Yes. By the bourgeois state? No. We cannot entrust this work, as any other, to the state of the exploiters. In our propaganda and agitation we must very strongly differentiate these two questions. That is, not to fight against the necessity of the workers being good soldiers and of building up an army based on discipline, science, strong bodies and so on, including conscription, but against the capitalist state which abuses the army for the advantage of the exploiting class.&quot;The policy provoked controversy within the Trotskyist movement with some seeing it as a concession to social patriotism. In the American SWP, Max Shachtman and James Burnham characterised the Soviet Union as &#x27;state capitalist&#x27; and disagreed with the policy.

== Britain ==
In Britain, the Workers&#x27; International League (WIL) adopted the PMP into their programme. The majority of workers supported the war because they had a genuine fear of an invasion by Nazi Germany and a desire to defeat Nazism. At the same time, the British ruling class could not be trusted to fight a war that would decisively defeat Hitler since they had supported and helped Hitler before the war. Only the working class could successfully carry out such a struggle.

Therefore, the WIL conducted revolutionary work in the armed forces upon conscription and agitated for a revolutionary war against fascism and for socialism. It was reflected in the slogan &#x27;First Hitler, then Churchill&#x27;.

The military establishment organised the Army Bureau of Current Affairs, which was intended to educate soldiers about current events. Where WIL members were based, they took control of the classes and used them to promote revolutionary ideas. In the case of WIL member Frank Ward, his revolutionary work was so successful that the military was compelled to give him an &quot;honourable discharge&quot; from the air force and sent him home in order to prevent him from conducting revolutionary activity.

In a similar incident, the Cairo Forces Parliament was shut down because of the growing support for the revolutionary ideas promoted by WIL members. They were elected to the positions of Prime Minister and Home Secretary. Their revolutionary work was successful in winning the support of many soldiers, as described by Ted Grant,&quot;From the reports of our soldier comrades, the Eighth Army soldiers were saying that after the war they would refuse to disarm, and return to Britain with their guns to ensure that things would change. This was the mutinous mood that was developing amongst these troops. At the 1943 conference of our tendency, I made the point, to illustrate the thing graphically, that the military establishment though it their army, but in fact, the soldiers of the Eighth Army were in rebellion. This reflected the revolutionary developments in the army. It was our Eighth Army in that it was being transformed. It was becoming revolutionary and in the process of moving over to the side of the working class.&quot;

<text>The Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) is the independent statutory authority and agency of the Australian Government responsible for the management of federal Australian elections, by-elections and referendums.

==History==
The &quot;Commonwealth Electoral Act 1902&quot; set up the framework for the Commonwealth electoral system, which was administered until 1916 as a branch of the Department of Home Affairs, by the Department of Home and Territories until 1928, back to Department of Home Affairs to 1932, and then Department of the Interior until 1972. The Australian Electoral Office was created in 1973 by the &quot;Australian Electoral Office Act 1973&quot;.

In 1984 the Australian Electoral Office was reformed through amendments to the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 and is currently known as the Australian Electoral Commission.

After the loss of 1,400 ballots during the recount for the 2013 Western Australia Senate election and the subsequent 2014 special election, the AEC came under significant scrutiny, leading to the resignation of Commissioner Ed Killesteyn.

During the 2023 Australian Indigenous Voice referendum, Opposition Leader Peter Dutton claimed that the Commission&#x27;s counting process was “rigged”, on the basis that the AEC would count ticks as &quot;yes&quot; votes but would not count crosses as &quot;no&quot; votes. Dutton&#x27;s comments were criticised as undermining faith in Australia&#x27;s electoral system and of echoing Trumpian misinformation regarding election integrity.

Later in 2023, the Commission topped an annual Commonwealth government trust survey, with 87 per cent of respondents indicating some level of trust in the AEC&#x27;s running of the Commission&#x27;s work, the highest trust rating of any government authority.

==Structure==
The AEC is accountable to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters of the Parliament of Australia, and must report on how elections were carried out and the success of elections in general.

As specified under the &quot;Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918&quot;, the AEC consists of a chairperson (a judge or a retired judge of the Federal Court of Australia), the Electoral Commissioner, and a non-judicial member (usually the Australian Statistician). The Electoral Commissioner has the powers of a secretary of a department under the &quot;Public Service Act 1999&quot; and &quot;Financial Management and Accountability Act 1998&quot;. The chairperson and the third, non-judicial member both hold their offices on a part-time basis.

Each House of Representatives electorate has a Divisional Returning Officer responsible for administration of elections within the division. Each state also has an Australian Electoral Officer responsible for the administration of Senate elections. The AEC has a National Office in Canberra and an office in each state and territory: Adelaide, Brisbane, Darwin, Hobart, Melbourne, Perth, and Sydney.

==Responsibilities==
The AEC&#x27;s main role is to conduct federal elections, by-elections and referendums, maintain up-to-date electoral rolls, and administer redistributions undertaken by the separate Redistribution Committee (the Australian Electoral Commission is not directly involved in electoral boundary changes). Under a joint roll arrangement with the states and territories, the AEC maintains enrolment for the whole of Australia, for rolls used in state and local government elections, other than Western Australia, The AEC publishes detailed federal election results and investigates electors who appear to fail to vote, or may have voted multiple times in an election.

The AEC is also responsible for registering political parties intending to field candidates at federal elections, monitoring the activities of those political parties, including receiving returns from parties of donations and expenditures, and the publication of the information. The AEC also plays an electoral education role, aiming to educate citizens about the electoral process by which representatives are elected, and by which the Australian Constitution is changed (referendums). It also plays a role in industrial voting and protected action ballots (e.g., votes on industrial action).

The rules for federal elections are contained in the &quot;Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918&quot;, while the rules for referendums are contained in the &quot;Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act 1984&quot;.

==Registration of political parties==
The AEC is required to maintain a register of political parties. Such registration is required before a party can field candidates, receive public funding, have party identification on ballot papers and use above-the-line voting in Senate elections. 

In all jurisdictions, conditions relating to a party name require party names to have a maximum of six words, not be obscene and not to resemble the name of another, unrelated party, be likely to cause confusion with another party nor contain the word &quot;independent&quot; or &quot;independent party&quot;.

All Australian jurisdictions also have a minimum membership requirement, which differs widely, especially when compared with the total number of people enrolled in the jurisdiction. These range from 100 in the Australian Capital Territory and Tasmania, 200 in South Australia, 500 in Victoria and Western Australia, 1,500 for the Commonwealth and 750 in New South Wales. Four jurisdictions require a fee for registration: $500 for the Commonwealth, Victoria and the Northern Territory; and $2,000 for New South Wales.

== Public funding of political parties ==
Since 1984, Australian political parties have been publicly funded by the AEC. The objective of public funding is to reduce the influence of private money upon elections, and consequently, the influence of private money upon the shaping of public policy. After each election, the AEC distributes a set amount of money to each political party, per vote received. A candidate or Senate group needs 4% of the primary vote to be eligible for public funding.

After the 2013 election, political parties and candidates received $58.1 million in election funding, with the funding rate being 248.800 cents per vote. The Liberal Party received $23.9 million, as part of the Coalition total of $27.2 million, while the Labor Party received $20.8 million. Other significant recipients were Australian Greens with $5.5 million, Palmer United Party with $2.3 million, and Liberal Democratic Party with $1.0 million.

In 2016, $62.7 million was distributed, with the funding rate being 262.784 cents per vote.

==Electoral roll ==
One of the functions of the AEC is the maintenance of the electoral roll, which in some other countries are called electoral registers. In Australia the process of getting onto the electoral roll is called &quot;enrolment&quot;. The AEC maintains Australia&#x27;s federal electoral roll, which is used for federal elections, by-elections and referendums. Australia has maintained a permanent federal electoral roll since 1908 and, by amendment to the Commonwealth Electoral Act, enrolment has been compulsory for federal elections since 1924.

Though each state and territory also has its own electoral commission or office, voters need to register only with the AEC, which shares the registration details with the relevant state electoral bodies. The federal roll also forms the basis of state (except in Victoria and Western Australia, which maintain their own roll) and local electoral rolls.

AEC registration covers federal, state and local election voter enrolment. In Australia and in each state or territory, it is an offence to fail to vote without valid or sufficient reason, at any federal or state election, and may be punishable by a nominal monetary penalty. The amount varies between federal and state jurisdictions. Usually, people are issued with warnings when it is found they have not voted, and are given an opportunity to show cause. Acceptable reasons for not voting may include being illness, being overseas on election day, religious belief, being incarcerated, etc. &quot;I forgot&quot; is not considered acceptable. Section 245 of the &quot;Commonwealth Electoral Act&quot; provides that if an elector has been asked the reason for failing to vote and declares a religious belief, this statement shall be regarded as conclusive with no further action being taken.

Traditionally, voters could not register after the Close of Roll for an election. In 2004, the Howard government passed legislation that prevented registration after 8 pm on the day the writs were issued. This can be up to 10 days after the election has been announced. The legislation was considered controversial by some Australians, who contended it disenfranchised first-time voters, or those who forgot to update their enrolment. The law was repealed prior to the 2010 federal election, when advocacy group GetUp! obtained a High Court ruling the changes unconstitutional. 16 and 17 year olds can provisionally enrol and able to vote when they turn 18.

== List of Australian Electoral Commissioners and predecessors==
Prior to the creation of the AEC in 1984, the senior electoral officer was designed the Chief Electoral Officer of the Commonwealth.

<text>Anthony Frederick Wilding (31 October 1883 – 9 May 1915), also known as Tony Wilding, was a New Zealand world No. 1 tennis player and soldier who was killed in action during World War I. Considered the world&#x27;s first tennis superstar, Wilding was the son of wealthy English immigrants to Christchurch, Canterbury, New Zealand and enjoyed the use of private tennis courts at their home. Wilding obtained a legal education at Trinity College, Cambridge and briefly joined his father&#x27;s law firm. Wilding was a first-class cricketer and a keen motorcycle enthusiast. His tennis career started with him winning the Canterbury Championships aged 17.

Wilding developed into a leading tennis player in the world during 1909–1914 and is considered to be a former world No. 1. He won 11 Grand Slam tournament titles, six in singles and five in doubles, and is the first and to date the only player from New Zealand to have won a Grand Slam singles title. In addition to Wimbledon, he also won three other ILTF World Championships (period 1912–1923): In singles, two World Hard Court Championships (WHCC) (1913–14) and one World Covered Court Championships (WCCC) (1913). With his eleven Grand Slam tournaments, two WHCC and one WCCC titles, he has a total of fourteen Major tournament titles (nine singles, five doubles). His sweep of the three ILTF World Championships in 1913 was accomplished on three different surfaces (grass, clay and wood) being the first time this has been achieved in Major tournaments.

Wilding won the Davis Cup four times playing for Australasia, and won a bronze medal at the indoor singles tennis event of the 1912 Olympics, which made him the first and to date only singles player from New Zealand to win a medal in a tennis event in the Summer Olympics and the only New Zealand player to win a medal in any Olympic tennis event until Marcus Daniell and Michael Venus won the bronze medal in the men&#x27;s doubles competition at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo in July, 2021. He still holds several all time singles tennis records, namely 23 titles won in a single season (1906) and 114 career outdoor titles (shared with Rod Laver). In his ranking list of greatest tennis players compiled in 1950, Norman Brookes, winner of three Majors and president of the Lawn Tennis Association of Australia, put Wilding in fourth place. Shortly after the outbreak of World War I he enlisted and was killed on 9 May 1915 during the Battle of Aubers Ridge at Neuve-Chapelle, France. In 1978 Wilding was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame.

==Early life==
Wilding was the second of five children of Frederick Wilding and Julia Anthony and was named after both parents. Cora Wilding was a younger sister. Wilding&#x27;s parents emigrated from Herefordshire, England to Christchurch, New Zealand, after their marriage in 1879. His father was a well-to-do lawyer in Christchurch who also played tennis and won several doubles championships of New Zealand. His mother was the daughter of Alderman Charles Anthony, mayor of Hereford. Wilding was born in the suburb of Opawa on 31 October 1883.

At their farmlet, situated on the banks of the Ōpāwaho / Heathcote River to the south of the town in Opawa, they had two tennis courts; one asphalt court for use in the winter and one grass court for summer play. Wilding started playing tennis in 1889, at age six, after receiving a racquet from manufacturer Ralph Slazenger. He was first educated at William Wilson&#x27;s private school for boys in Cranmer Square, where he was captain of the school football team at age 12. Wilding passed his matriculation in 1901 after failing at his first attempt in 1900. He attended a term at the Canterbury University College for six months prior to departing on his seven-week sea voyage to England in July 1902 where he first stayed at a cramming school at Hunstanton before passing his entrance examination for Trinity College, Cambridge, to study law. There he developed his tennis game as a member of the Cambridge University Lawn Tennis Club. In March 1904, during his second year, he became honorary secretary of the club and managed to popularize the game. He visited the 1903 Wimbledon Championships to see former champion Harold Mahony play. Although Wilding did not excel academically he passed the law examination and graduated B.A. in June 1905 after which he returned to New Zealand to join his father&#x27;s law practice. Finishing his education, he was called to the English Bar at the Inner Temple in June 1906.

==Tennis career==

===British tournaments and Wimbledon debut===
In October 1901 at the age of 17 Wilding won his first singles title at the Canterbury Championships. In July 1903, during his first summer vacation at Trinity College, Wilding entered his first English public tournament at Sheffield and Hallamshire. He reached the semifinal of the singles event, defeating English top-10 player F.W. Payn in the second round, before losing to G.C. Allen. At the 1903 Brighton tournament he won the mixed doubles partnering Dorothea Douglass, the reigning Wimbledon ladies champion. Wilding worked diligently on improving his backhand during the winter of 1903–04.

He made his first appearance at the Wimbledon Championships in June 1904, defeating Albert Prebble in the first round of the singles event before losing to Harold Mahony in four sets. He was pleased to take a set from the 1896 champion: &quot;To my great delight I captured a set and made Mahony talk to himself a great deal&quot;. Shortly afterwards, at the Welsh Championships, he reached his first singles final which he lost in straight sets to S.H. Smith. He won his first title in England at the Championships of Shropshire followed by a win at the Thompson Challenge Cup in Redhill; both relatively new and minor events on the tennis circuit. In August 1904 Wilding won the Scottish Championships in Moffat, defeating C.J. Glenny in the final. At his second Wimbledon appearance he came back from two-sets down to defeat William Clothier in the fourth round but lost in the quarterfinal against the experienced Arthur Gore.

===Davis Cup debut and first European tour===
In July 1905 he made his first Davis Cup appearance as part of the Australasia team in the semifinal against Austria, played at the Queen&#x27;s Club, London. Australasia won 5–0 and Wilding won both his singles matches but in the final they were defeated 5–0 by the United States and Wilding admitted to have been outclassed in his straight-sets defeats by William Larned and Beals Wright. After two tournament victories at minor events in New Barnet and Redhill Wilding went on his first tour of the European circuit which brought him into contact with the European upper class and aristocracy who frequented these tournaments. In August he won the Pöseldorf Cup in Hamburg followed by a title win at the Championship of Europe in Homburg which were both, as almost all tournaments on the European mainland, played on clay.

===Riviera circuit and Wimbledon semifinal===
Starting in February 1906 Wilding toured during almost the entire year across continental Europe and England, sometimes travelling by train but most often on his beloved motorcycle. For the first time he played the French Riviera circuit and won tournaments in cities throughout Europe including Cannes, Paris, Lyon, Barcelona, Wiesbaden, Reading, Prague, Bad Homburg and Vienna. At some of the tournaments in England and Europe he was accompanied by his father with whom he played in various doubles competitions. Together they won the doubles title at the Sheffield and Hallamshire tournament in June 1906. Wilding&#x27;s run at the 1906 Wimbledon Championships ended, as it had done the previous year, with a straight-sets defeat against the veteran Arthur Gore, this time in the semifinal. After winning the singles title at the London Covered Courts Championships in October, beating George Caridia in the final, he travelled by boat to New Zealand and in late December in his native Christchurch won the singles title at the Australasian Championships, defeating Francis Fisher in the final, and doubles title, partnering compatriot Rodney Heath. A week later he also won the New Zealand Championship against Harry Parker in the final. At the 1907 Wimbledon Championships Wilding had the misfortune to be drawn in the same section as tournament favourite and eventual champion Norman Brookes who defeated him in their second-round match in five sets. Reluctant to return to New Zealand to practise law, as he originally intended, Wilding instead decided to play a circuit of European tournaments. During the 1907–08 winter, when tennis activity was at a low, he generated income as an English teacher and tennis trainer for aristocratic families in Bohemia and Hungary. In March 1908 he partnered Major Ritchie to win the doubles title at the South of France tournament against multiple Wimbledon champions Lawrence and Reginald Doherty. Wilding won the 1908 Victorian Championships singles title after defeating Fred Alexander. 

Between 1907 and 1909 he helped the Australasian team win three consecutive Davis Cups, the first against the British Isles at Wimbledon and the last two against the United States. He won his second Australasian Championships in 1909, with his remorseless drives proving too much for Ernie Parker to handle in the final. The same year he qualified as a Barrister and Solicitor at the Supreme Court of New Zealand. Focusing on his tennis game, he won the Wimbledon singles title for four straight years between 1910 and 1913. He was the last player to win four successive championships until 1979; when Bjorn Borg won his fourth successive championship. He attained the first of three No. 1 rankings in 1911. In 1910 and 1912 he defeated Arthur Gore in the final, both times in four sets. In 1911 his opponent Herbert Roper Barrett retired in the final at two sets all. In 1913 at Wimbledon tennis player and author A. Wallis Myers says that he played &quot;the best game of his life&quot;, beating American Maurice McLoughlin, the 1912 U.S. National Championships winner, in three straight sets. In 1914 he narrowly missed winning his fifth title in a row, losing in the final to Norman Brookes. In addition, he won four men&#x27;s doubles titles at Wimbledon, in 1907 and 1914 with Norman Brookes and in 1908 and 1910 partnering with Major Ritchie.

He missed the 1908 Olympics in London because of an administrative error in which the Australasia Olympic committee forgot to officially nominate any tennis players, but at the 1912 Olympics in Stockholm won a bronze medal in the men&#x27;s indoor singles for Australasia.

During the 1911 Riviera season Wilding defeated Max Decugis in the final of three tournaments in Monte Carlo, Menton and Nice.

===Triple World Champion===
Wilding won a unique World Championships triple in 1913:
*The World Hard Court Championship (Paris, clay)
*World Grass Court Championships (Wimbledon, London, grass)
*The World Covered Court Championship (Stockholm, indoor wood)
Tony Wilding won all three events in 1913. In a sense, this was the equivalent of achieving what would later become known as the Grand Slam of Tennis because all three of the major tournaments sanctioned by the world governing body were won by one player and all in one calendar year. In 1914 Wilding retained his World Hard Court Championship title in Paris without losing a single set, defeating Ludwig von Salm-Hoogstraeten in the final.

In 1914, after a five-year absence, he returned to Davis Cup play, and with Norman Brookes, lead the Australasian team to another championship, defeating the United States team in the Challenge round before a home crowd at the West Side Tennis Club in Forest Hills, New York. This turned out to be his final tournament. Wilding had entered the 1914 U.S. Championships which followed later in August but withdrew due to the outbreak of World War I and returned to England.

Wilding was a leading tennis player in the world during 1909–1914 and is considered a former world No. 1. Norman Brookes in 1950 compiled a ranking list of greatest tennis players and put Wilding fourth behind Bill Tilden and the Dohertys, and ahead of Budge, Kramer, Lacoste and Perry. Over his career, he was popular among fans and players alike, being honest and professional, advising players to &quot;[b]e moderate in all things, especially in eating, smoking and drinking.&quot; His style was to play powershots from the baseline.

==Other sports==

He also played for the Canterbury cricket team in the early 1900s where he participated in two first-class matches as a lower middle-order batsman and medium-pace change bowler. During his first summer at Cambridge in 1903 he focused almost exclusively on cricket before switching to tennis. Wilding also played rugby at Trinity College, mainly to keep fit during the winter months, and was part of the Trinity team that competed against Racing Club de France. He considered that &quot;play must be combined with various other exercises. The prizefighter does not limit his training to sparring&quot; and in doing so advanced the physical requirements for competitive tennis. He was a keen motorcycle (with sidecar) rider with many long trips in Europe, New Zealand and America. In July 1908 he won a gold medal in a reliability trial from Land&#x27;s End to John o&#x27; Groats on his BAT-JAP motorcycle. Several &quot;mighty rides&quot; (Myers) in Europe in 1910 included London to Lake Geneva and back, some , including from Évian-les-Bains to Paris in one day. He ventured into places with poor roads like Hungary and Serbia. Wilding frequently used a motorcycle to travel between tennis tournaments on the European continent.

==Performance timeline==


==Military service and death==

Shortly after the outbreak of World War I, Wilding joined the Royal Marines on advice of Winston Churchill who was then First Lord of the Admiralty. He was gazetted a second lieutenant in early October 1914. Wilding remained in the Marines for just a few days and was then attached to the Intelligence Corps due to his intimate knowledge of the continent and his skills as a motorist. At the end of October he joined the Royal Naval Armoured Car Division in the battlefields of northern France where he had thirty men, three guns and armoured cars under his command. After a week&#x27;s leave in London in February 1915 he returned to France on 16 March 1915 and was posted to a new squadron made up of armoured Rolls-Royce cars under the command of the Duke of Westminster. He was ranked a lieutenant. Before long the squadron was moved near the front and on 2 May Wilding received notice of his promotion to captain. In his last letter dated 8 May he wrote &quot;For really the first time in seven and a half months I have a job on hand which is likely to end in gun, I, and the whole outfit being blown to hell. However if we succeed we will help our infantry no end.&quot;. The next day, 9 May, he was killed in action at 4:45 in the afternoon during the Battle of Aubers Ridge at Neuve-Chapelle, France when a shell exploded on the roof of the dug-out he was sheltering in.

Wilding was buried the next day at the front but was later re-interred at the Rue-des-Berceaux Military Cemetery in Richebourg-l&#x27;Avoué, Pas-de-Calais, France. He had been dating, and was rumored to be about to marry, Broadway star Maxine Elliott, 15 years his senior.

==Legacy and honours==
In 1978, he was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame. Wilding Park, the principal venue for tennis in Christchurch, New Zealand, was named after his father, Frederick, but in the public perception became associated with him. He was inducted into the New Zealand Sports Hall of Fame in 1990. The New Zealand Post issued a stamp of Anthony Wilding in 1992 as part of the Health Stamps series to support children with emotional and behavioural problems. Shortly after Wilding&#x27;s death the sculptor Paolo Troubetzkoy made a bronze statuette based on him titled &quot;Physical Energy&quot;.

<doc id="761487" wikidata="Q7567543" url="?curid=761487" title="South Indian culture">
<text>South Indian culture refers to the cultural region typically covering the South Indian states of Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, and Telangana. The idea of South India is closely linked to the Dravidian ethnic and linguistic identity and therefore it can also refer to groups in central India such as the Gondi and the Kui. Similar to India it is difficult to define a common essence of South Indian culture. That being some common threads include the eternal universe through the celebration of the beauty of the body and femininity. It is exemplified through its dance, clothing, and sculptures.

== Traditional clothing ==
The clothing of South India is highly diverse, but is connected by a common cultural ancestry. South Indian women are known to traditionally wear the sari while the men wear a type of sarong, which could be either a white &quot;dhoti or&quot; a colourful &quot;lungi&quot; with typical batik patterns. However, these are but a few of an expansive tradition of fashion. The saree, being an unstitched drape, enhances the shape of the wearer while only partially covering the midriff. In Indian philosophy, the navel of the Supreme Being is considered as the source of life and creativity. Hence by tradition, the stomach and the navel is to be left unconcealed, though the philosophy behind the costume has largely been forgotten. This makes the realization of &quot;sharira-mandala&quot;, where in &quot;Angikam bhuvanam yasya&quot; (the body is your world) unites with the &quot;shaarira-mandala&quot; (the whole universe), as expressed in the Natyashastra. These principles of the sari, also hold for other forms of drapes, like the lungi or mundu or panchey (a white lungi with colourful silk borders in kannada), worn by men. The lungi is draped over clockwise or counterclockwise and is tied at the back or fixed just along the waistline. It&#x27;s sometimes lifted to the knee and tied at the waist leisurely or just held in hand to speed up walking.

Traditionally, South Indian men do not cover their upper body. Sometimes, in a formal situation, a piece of cloth may cover the upper body. Certain temples in South India even ban men from wearing upper-body garments when inside the temple. In Andhra and parts of north Karnataka, men wear kachche panchey where it is tied at back by taking it between legs. A similar pattern is seen in women. All over the peninsular coastal region, men wear coloured lungis and women wear saris in a manner of tying them at the back.

Calico, a plain-woven textile made from unbleached, and often not fully processed, cotton, was originated at Calicut (Kozhikode), from which the name of the textile came, in South India, now Kerala, during the 11th century, where the cloth was known as &quot;Chaliyan&quot;. The raw fabric was dyed and printed in bright hues, and calico prints later became popular in the Europe.

== Cuisine ==

Food habits are diverse even regionally and are largely based on the traditions. Rice is the staple diet. Coconut is an important ingredient in Kerala and coastal part of Karnataka of South India, Hyderabadi biryani is also very special in Telangana and other neighbouring states whereas the cuisine in Andhra Pradesh is characterized by the pickles, spicy aromatic curries and the generous use of chili powder. Dosa, Idli, Uttapam etc. are popular throughout the region. Coastal areas like the state of Kerala and the city of Mangalore are known for their seafood. South Indian coffee is generally quite robust, and coffee is a preferred drink throughout the Malabar region. Tamil Nadu is well known for its Idli, Dosa, Pongal, Sambhar, Vada, Puri, which are the common breakfast in Tamil families. Among the Malayalees, Appam, Puttu, Upamav, Malabar biriyani are some of the common dishes. In Karnataka, Bisibele bath, Kara bath, Kesari bath, Raggi mudda, Udin Vada, Bene Masala Dosa, Paper Dosa are some of the common dishes.

Coconut is native to Southern India and spread to Europe, Arabia, and Persia through the southwestern Malabar Coast of South India over the centuries. Coconut of Indian origin was brought to the Americas by Portuguese merchants. Black pepper is also native to the Malabar Coast of India, and the Malabar pepper is extensively cultivated there. During classical era, Phoenicians, Greeks, Egyptians, Romans, and Chinese were attracted by the spices including Cinnamon and Black pepper from the ancient port of Muziris in the southwestern coast of India. 

During Middle Ages prior to the Age of Discovery which began with the end of the 15th century CE, the kingdom of Calicut (Kozhikode) on Malabar Coast was the centre of Indian pepper exports to the Red Sea and Europe at this time with Egyptian and Arab traders being particularly active. The Thalassery cuisine, a style of cuisine originated in the Northern Kerala over centuries, makes use of such spices

== Music ==


There is a variety of music. It ranges from rural folk music to the sophisticated Indian Classical Music of South India is known as Carnatic music (after &quot;Carnatic&quot;, the name by which south India was known in the earlier colonial days. Sarang Dev coined south Indian classical music as &quot;Karnatic&quot; Music). It includes melodious, mostly devotional, rhythmic and structured music by composers such as Purandara Dasa, Kanaka Dasaru, Tyagaraja, Dikshathar, Shyama Sasthri, and Swati Tirunal. It is difficult to discuss the culture and music of the four states of South India in a single breath. In Tamil Nadu, there is Tamil Pann, which is sung by Oduvars in Temples. They sing the works of famous Tamil Poets like Sambandar, etc. in various panns (another word for raagas).

===Hindu Temple Music===
The main instrument that is used in south Indian Hindu temples is the (nadaswaram) It is said to have been created when the very first temple was established in South India. The nadaswaram and the (thavil) were played together in South Indian temples to create a periya melam ensemble. Because of its harsh tone, periya melam is not favored by many Europeans, but to South India, it is a sound of pride and majesty. For many temple traditions, periya melam is necessary for worshippers to feel a spiritual presence. Periya melam is used to play for daily rituals inside the temples and annual rituals outside and around temples. Terada, Yoshitaka. &quot;Temple Music Traditions in Hindu South India: &quot;Periya Melam&quot; and its Performance Practice.&quot; Asian Music 39.2 (2009): 108-51. ProQuest. Web. 24 Sep. 2013.

==Dance==
The South Indian culture is celebrated in the elaborate dance forms of South India: Koodiyattam, Bharatanatyam, Oyilattam, Karakattam, Kuchipudi, Kathakali, Thirayattam, Theyyam, Bhuta Kola, Ottamthullal, Oppana, Kerala Natanam, Mohiniaattam and Yakshagana. Thirayattam is a Ritualistic Performing art of South Malabar region in Kerala state. The Bharatanatyam is the celebration of the eternal universe through the celebration of the beauty of the body. This is done through its tenets of having a perfectly erect posture, a straight and pout curving stomach, a well rounded and proportionate body mass to the body structure, very long hair and curvaceous hips. These tenets bring to life the philosophy of Natyashastra, &#x27;Angikam bhuvanam yasya&#x27; (The body is your world). This is elaborated in the &quot;araimandi&quot; posture, wherein the performer assumes a half sitting position with the knees turned sideways, with a very erect posture. In this fundamental posture of the Bharatanatyam dance, the distance between the head and the navel becomes equal to that between the earth and the navel. In a similar way the distance between the outstretched right arm to the outstretched left arm becomes equal to the distance between the head and the feet, thus representing the &quot;Natyapurusha&quot;, the embodiment of life and creation.

== Architecture and paintings ==

South India boasts of having two enchanting styles of rock architecture, the &quot;pure Dravida&quot; style of Tamil Nadu and the &quot;Vesara&quot; style (also called &quot;Karnata Dravida&quot; style) present in Karnataka. Other style of non-rock architecture include the Kerala Architecture. It has been performed/followed according to Indian Vedic architectural science (&quot;Vastu Shastra&quot;). The inspirational temple sculptures of Mahabalipuram, Tanjore, Hampi, Badami, Pattadakal, Aihole, Belur, Halebidu, Lakkundi, Shravanabelagola, Madurai and the mural paintings of Travancore and Lepakshi temples, also stand as a testament to South Indian culture. The paintings of Raja Ravi Varma are considered classic renditions of many themes of South Indian life and mythology. There are several examples of Kerala Mural paintings in the Mattancherry Palace and the Shiva kshetram at Ettamanoor. South India is home, as of April 2006, to 5 of the 26 World Heritage-listed sites in India.

== Sculptures and figurine ==

Sculptures became one of the finest medium of South Indian expression after the human form of dance. In this medium it was possible to etch the three-dimensional form in time. The traditional South Indian sculptor starts his sculpture of the divinities from the navel which is always represented unclothed by the sari. A koshta or grid of the sculpture would show the navel to be right at the centre of the sculpture, representing the source of the union of the finite body and the infinite universe.
Sculptures adorn many of the temples around the complexes and also inside them. They are also depiction of dance steps of various stylizations and have served to preserve dance forms and revive it.
== Literature and philosophy ==
South India has one of the oldest literary traditions in the world reaching back over two thousand years. The first known literature of South India are the poetic Sangams, which were written in Tamil around two to one and a half thousand years ago. The Kannada classic &quot;Kavirajamarga&quot;, written in 850 CE by King Amoghavarsha I, makes references to Kannada literature of King Durvinita in early sixth century CE. Tamil Buddhist commentators of the tenth century CE, &quot;Nemrinatham&quot; makes references to Kannada literature of fourth century CE. Distinct Malayalam and Telugu literary traditions developed in the following centuries. The artistic expressions of the South Indian people show their admiration of the magnificence of nature and its rhythms. Some of the works include &quot;Silappadhikaram&quot; by Ilango Adigal, &quot;Tholkappiam&quot; written by Tholkappiar, Thiruvalluvar&#x27;s &quot;Thirukural&quot;, Kumaravyasa&#x27;s &quot;Karnata Bharata Katamanjari&quot;, Pampa&#x27;s &quot;Vikramarjuna Vijaya&quot;, &quot;Andhra Maha Bharatamu&quot; by the three poets namely Nannaya, Tikkana and Errana, &quot;Shiva Sharana&quot; by Basavanna and Akka Mahadevi&#x27;s &quot;Vachanas&quot;. In South Indian literature and philosophy, women are considered very powerful. A married woman is regarded as auspicious, her shakti or feminine power, protects and empowers her husband and their children. Contemporary Kannada writers have received eight Jnanapith awards which is the highest for any Indian language and Malayalam literature has been presented with 6 Jnanpith awards, which lies second only to Kannada literature.

==Communities and traditions==
The main spiritual traditions of South India include both Shaivite and Vaishnavite branches of Hinduism, although Buddhist and Jain philosophies had been influential several centuries earlier (recent studies suggest at least the Shaivite branch of Hinduism was present in Southern India before the arrival of Buddhism and Jainism as Ellalan a Tamil King who invaded Sri Lanka in the year 205 BCE is identified by Sinhalese Buddhists as a Shaivite). South Indian Spiritual traditions have also been informed by Pre-Aryan Indigenous nature and polytheistic worship that distinguishes it from other regions in India. Shravanabelagola in Karnataka is a popular pilgrimage center for Jains. Christianity has flourished in coastal South India from the times of St. Thomas the Apostle who came to Kerala in 52 AD and established the Syrian Christian tradition today called Saint Thomas Christians or Nasranis. There is a large Muslim community in South India, particularly in the Malabar Coast, which can trace its roots to the ancient maritime trade between Kerala and Omanis and other Arabs, mainly from Hadhramaut and adjoining South Arabian regions. They are known as Mappila Muslims and are scattered mainly around the regions of North Malabar and South Malabar in Kerala, along with the inhabited islands of Lakshadweep in the Arabian Sea. According to some scholars, the Mappilas are the oldest settled native Muslim community in South Asia. Madras and Cochin are homes to one of the oldest Cochin Jews and Paradesi Jews in the world who are supposed to have arrived in the Malabar coast during the time of King Solomon. The oldest surviving Jewish synagogue in the Commonwealth of Nations is the Kadavumbhagam Synagogue and the Paradesi Synagogue in Kochi, Kerala.

<text>Callias () was an Ancient Greek statesman, soldier and diplomat active in 5th century BC. He is commonly known as Callias II to distinguish him from his grandfather, Callias I, and from his grandson, Callias III, who apparently squandered the family&#x27;s fortune.

==Life==
Born to the wealthy Athenian family that provided slaves to the state-owned silver mine of Laurion, Callias was one of the richest men in Athens. He fought at the Battle of Marathon (490) in priestly attire. Plutarch relates that after the battle, an enemy soldier confused Callias for a king and showed him where a large quantity of gold had been hidden in a ditch. Callias is said to have killed the man and secretly taken the treasure, but rumour later spread of the incident, and comic poets gave his family the name &quot;Laccopluti&quot;, or &quot;enriched by the ditch&quot;.

Around the time of the death of Miltiades, Callias offered to pay the debt that Cimon had inherited from his father in exchange for Cimon&#x27;s sister Elpinice&#x27;s hand in marriage, and Cimon agreed.

A supporter of Pericles, who was the effective leader of Athens during this period, Callias took on the role of diplomat and ambassador of Athens and of the Delian League. In about 461 BC, he made at least one journey as ambassador to Persian King Artaxerxes I.

Sometime after the death of Cimon, probably about 449 BC he went to Susa to conclude with Artaxerxes a peace treaty, which became known as the Peace of Callias. The treaty ended the Greco-Persian War and safeguarded the Greek city-states in Asia Minor from Persian attacks. Callias may also been responsible for peace treaties with Rhegion and Leontinoi, as well as the later peace treaty with Sparta that is known as the Thirty Years&#x27; Peace.

Callias&#x27; fate upon his return to Athens remains a mystery, and information about his later years remain only fragmentary. According to Demosthenes, he was fined fifty talents on his return to Athens. Other sources claim that the Athenians dedicated an altar of peace and voted special honours to Callias.

Callias&#x27; son Hipponicus was also a notable military leader was known as the &quot;richest man in Greece&quot;.

<text>Churcher&#x27;s College is a private co-educational fee-charging day school, founded in 1722. Churcher’s College is regarded as a leading private school in the south of England. The Senior School (ages 11–18) is in the market town of Petersfield, Hampshire with the Junior School and Nursery (ages 3–11) in nearby Liphook. It is a member of the Headmasters&#x27; and Headmistresses&#x27; Conference (HMC).

The College was founded in Petersfield in the 1720s by the will of Richard Churcher to educate local boys in the skills needed for service in the East India Company.

The headmaster is Simon Williams who replaced Geoffrey Buttle in September 2004. Alumni are known as Old Churcherians or OCs.

==History==
The school was founded under the will of Richard Churcher in 1722. Churcher was a wealthy local philanthropist who had made his fortune through interests in the British East India Company. His will, dated 1722, decreed that the College was to educate: Under the terms of the will, Churcher&#x27;s College was created from a £3000 gift as a non-denominational foundation, a status it has kept to this day. The original school, built in 1729, is in College Street. The school became increasingly popular due to its successes, and in 1881 moved to its present location in Ramshill, accommodating 150 boys, on land donated by the J&amp;W Nicholson &amp; Co family of gin makers.
From 1946 to 1964 Broadlands, opposite the college grounds in Ramshill, was the preparatory school for Churcher&#x27;s. It was Grade II listed in 1949.

For much of the 20th century Churcher&#x27;s College operated as a voluntary aided grammar school. In 1979, Hampshire County Council decided to cease to maintain the college, which became an independent fee-paying school. The school&#x27;s expanding population (by the mid-20th century the school educated some 400 boys, of whom about a quarter boarded in three separate houses: Mount House, Ramshill House and School house) has necessitated the addition of a number of modern buildings alongside the original 1881 buildings.

Girls were first admitted to the Sixth Form in 1980, and the school became fully co-educational in 1988. Reflecting its naval history, the college&#x27;s houses are named after the naval heroes Drake, Grenville, Nelson and Rodney, with the later addition of Collingwood.

In 1993 the school purchased Moreton House School in Petersfield, which became Churcher&#x27;s College Junior School. Like the senior school before it, the junior school is very successful, and soon outgrew its premises. Following an unsuccessful attempt to relocate in Petersfield, the school eventually purchased an existing school campus in Liphook (Littlefield&#x27;s School), which from 2003 became the junior school&#x27;s new site.

Simon Williams has been headmaster since 2004.

==Sport and outdoor pursuits==

Pupils at the school play rugby, hockey, netball and cricket. The College was the first school to affiliate to the Hampshire RFU in 1924. OC Frank Guy was responsible for the founding of local rugby union club Petersfield R.F.C. in 1927. In 2015, Churcher&#x27;s won the NatWest Schools Cup under-18 Vase with 13-5 victory over SEEVIC College, the first Hampshire school to do so.

The school has equestrianism, tennis, hockey, rugby, swimming, athletics and recently football teams and events and competes in contests such as the Ten Tors, and Ten peaks (a churcher’s college made event, due to unselection in 2023) Churcher’s College won Ten Tors in both 2014 and 2015, the Devizes to Westminster International Canoe Marathon, and the Charlton Chase and annually sponsor/host the Butser Hill Challenge events.

There are Combined Cadet Force and Duke of Edinburgh Award programmes, as well as the World Challenge and First Challenge expeditions for the 4th and 5th and 6th form students.

<text>Mary Margaret Truman Daniel (February 17, 1924 – January 29, 2008) was an American classical soprano, actress, journalist, radio and television personality, writer, and New York socialite. She was the only child of President Harry S. Truman and First Lady Bess Truman. While her father was president during the years 1945 to 1953, Margaret regularly accompanied him on campaign trips, such as the 1948 countrywide whistle-stop campaign lasting several weeks. She also appeared at important White House and political events during those years, being a favorite with the media.

After graduating from George Washington University in 1946, she embarked on a career as a coloratura soprano, beginning with a concert appearance with the Detroit Symphony Orchestra in 1947. She appeared in concerts with orchestras throughout the United States and in recitals throughout the U.S. through 1956. She made recordings for RCA Victor, and made television appearances on programs like &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; and &quot;The Bell Telephone Hour&quot;.

In 1957, one year after her marriage, Truman abandoned her singing career to pursue a career as a journalist and radio personality, when she became the co-host of the program &quot;Weekday&quot; with Mike Wallace. She also wrote articles as an independent journalist, for a variety of publications in the 1960s and 1970s. She later became the successful author of a series of murder mysteries, and a number of works on U.S. First Ladies and First Families, including well-received biographies of her father, President Harry S. Truman and mother Bess Truman.

She was married to journalist Clifton Daniel, managing editor of &quot;The New York Times&quot;. The couple had four sons, and were prominent New York socialites who often hosted events for the New York elite.

==Early life==
Mary Margaret was born at 219 North Delaware Street in Independence, Missouri, on February 17, 1924, and was christened Mary Margaret Truman (for her aunt Mary Jane Truman and maternal grandmother Margaret Gates Wallace), but was called Margaret from early childhood. She took voice and piano lessons as a child (at the encouragement of her father, who famously played piano) and attended public school in Independence until her father&#x27;s 1934 election to the United States Senate, after which her education was split between public schools in Independence and Gunston Hall School, a private school for girls in Washington, D.C.

In 1942, she matriculated at George Washington University, where she was a member of Pi Beta Phi, and earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in history and international relations in 1946. In June 1944, she christened the battleship at Brooklyn Navy Yard, and spoke again in 1986 at the ship&#x27;s recommissioning. She studied singing with Estelle Liebling, the voice teacher of Beverly Sills, in New York City.

On April 12, 1945, President Franklin D. Roosevelt died and his Vice President Harry Truman assumed the presidency. Margaret was 21.

==Career==
===Singing===

 When Truman was 16 years old, she began taking voice lessons in Independence from Mrs. Thomas J. Strickler, a family friend. After classical vocal training, Truman&#x27;s singing career began with a debut radio recital in March 1947, followed shortly thereafter with her professional concert debut with the Detroit Symphony Orchestra. She sang professionally for the next decade, appearing with major American orchestras and giving several national concert tours. Some of her credits include concert appearances with the Los Angeles Philharmonic at the Hollywood Bowl, the National Symphony Orchestra, the NBC Symphony Orchestra, the Pittsburgh Symphony, the Philadelphia Orchestra, and the Saint Louis Symphony among others. While she never performed in staged operas, she did perform opera arias in concert. Her performances were mainly of both sacred and secular art songs, lieder, and works from the concert soprano repertoire. In 1951 and 1952, RCA Victor issued two albums by Truman, one of classical selections, the other of American art songs. She also made recordings of German lieder for NBC. A 1951 &quot;Time Magazine&quot; cover featured Truman with a single musical note floating by her head. She performed on stage, radio, and television through 1956.

At the beginning of her career, critical reviews of Truman&#x27;s singing were positive, polite or diplomatic in tone, with some later reviewers speculating that negative opinions were held back out of deference for her father as a current sitting United States President. This practice was broken in 1950 when &quot;Washington Post&quot; music critic Paul Hume wrote that Truman was &quot;extremely attractive on the stage... [but] cannot sing very well. She is flat a good deal of the time. And still cannot sing with anything approaching professional finish.&quot; The review angered President Truman (who was dealing that same day with the sudden death of his childhood friend and White House Press Secretary Charlie Ross), who wrote to Hume, &quot;Some day I hope to meet you. When that happens you&#x27;ll need a new nose, a lot of beefsteak for black eyes, and perhaps a supporter below!&quot; Hume wanted to publish the letter, but &quot;Washington Post&quot; publisher Philip Graham vetoed the idea. However, Hume showed the letter to a number of his colleagues, including Milton Berliner, music critic of the rival &quot;Washington Times Herald&quot;, which published a story. The &quot;Post&quot; was then forced to acknowledge the letter, which drew international headlines, becoming a minor scandal for the Truman administration. Reviewers after that felt more free to be honest in their reviews of her performances, with mixed criticism for her singing thereafter.

===Acting, radio, and journalism===
Truman&#x27;s professional acting debut occurred April 26, 1951. She co-starred with James Stewart in the &quot;Jackpot&quot; episode of &quot;Screen Directors Playhouse&quot; on NBC radio. On March 17, 1952, Truman was guest soloist on &quot;The Railroad Hour&quot; in a presentation of the operetta &quot;Sari&quot;.

Truman also performed on the NBC Radio program &quot;The Big Show&quot;. There she met writer Goodman Ace, who gave her advice and pointers; Ace became a lifelong friend, advising Truman even after &quot;The Big Show&quot;.
She became part of the team of NBC Radio&#x27;s &quot;Weekday&quot; show that premiered in 1955, shortly after its &quot;Monitor&quot; program made its debut. Paired with Mike Wallace, she presented news and interviews aimed at a female listening audience.

She appeared several times as a panelist (and twice as a mystery guest) on the game show &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; and guest-starred more than once on NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Martha Raye Show&quot;.

In 1957, she sang and played piano on &quot;The Gisele MacKenzie Show.&quot;

===Writing===
Truman&#x27;s full-length biography of her father, published shortly before his 1972 death, was critically acclaimed. She also wrote a personal biography of her mother and histories of the White House and its inhabitants (including first ladies and pets). Truman published regularly into her eighties.

====Novels====
From 1980 to 2011, 25 books in the Capital Crimes series of murder mysteries, most set in and around Washington, D.C., were published under Margaret Truman&#x27;s name.

Professional ghostwriter Donald Bain (1935–2017) acknowledged in the March 14, 2014, issue of &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; that he had written &quot;27 novels in the Margaret Truman Capital Crimes series (mostly bylined by Truman, my close collaboratormy name is on only the most recent entries, released after her death).&quot;

In 2000, another ghostwriter, William Harrington, had claimed in a self-written obituary before his apparent suicide that Margaret Truman and others were his clients.

===Institutions===
She served on the board of directors for the Harry S. Truman Presidential Library and Museum and the Board of Governors of the Roosevelt Institute, and served as a Trustee for her alma mater.

==Personal life==
On April 21, 1956, Truman married Clifton Daniel, a reporter for &quot;The New York Times&quot; and later its managing editor, at Trinity Episcopal Church in Independence; he died in 2000. They had four sons:
* Clifton Truman Daniel (born June 5, 1957), Director of Public Relations for Harry S Truman College.
* William Wallace Daniel (May 19, 1959 – September 4, 2000), a psychiatric social worker and researcher at Columbia University. He died after being struck by a taxicab in New York City.
* Harrison Gates Daniel (born 1963)
* Thomas Washington Daniel (born 1966)

==Popular culture==
Italian dress designer Micol Fontana, who designed Truman’s wedding gown, was invited to be a surprise guest on the TV show What&#x27;s My Line? in New York City, just six days before the Truman/Daniel wedding on April 21, 1956, in Independence, Missouri.

==Later years and death==
In later life, Truman lived in her Park Avenue home. She died on January 29, 2008, in Chicago (to which she was relocating to be closer to her son Clifton). She was said to have been suffering from &quot;a simple infection&quot; and had been breathing with the assistance of a respirator. Her ashes and those of her husband were interred in Independence in her parents&#x27; burial plot on the grounds of the Truman Library.

==Bibliography==

<text>Hipponicus III (; ; 485 BC – 422/1 BC) was an Athenian military commander. He was the son of Callias II of the deme Alopece and Elpinice of Laciadae (sister of Cimon). He was known as the &quot;richest man in Greece&quot;.

Shortly after 455 BC, Hipponicus married the former wife of Pericles, whose name is unknown. By her, he had two children: Callias III and a daughter, Hipparete who later married Alcibiades. A second son, Hermogenes was probably illegitimate since he received none of his father&#x27;s estate.

Hipponicus&#x27; wealth came from, among other things, his owning six hundred slaves working at the silver mines at Laurion in southern Attica.

In 445/4 BC he was secretary of the Athenian Council (&quot;boule&quot;) and was still active as late as 426 BC when he, Nicias and Eurymedon commanded Athenian regiments in an incursion into Boeotian territory where they successfully engaged Tanagran and Theban forces at Tanagra. 

Hipponicus was reported by Andocides to have been slain at the Battle of Delium in 424 BC, but this appears to have been an error, either on Andocides&#x27; part or a later transcriber, for Thucydides reported that the general at Delium was Hippocrates. According to Athenaeus, Hipponicus died shortly before Eupolis exhibited his comedy &quot;Flatterers&quot; during the archonship of Alcaeus ( 422/1).

Aelian, in his Varieties of History, reports this anecdote about Hipponicus:
&quot;Hipponicus&quot; son of &quot;Callias&quot; would erect a Statue as a Gift to his Country. One advised him that the Statue should be made by &quot;Polycletus&quot;. He answered, &quot;I will not have such a Statue, the glory whereof will redound not to the Giver, but to the Carver. For it is certain that all who see the Art, will admire &quot;Polycletus&quot; and not me.&quot;

<doc id="761500" wikidata="Q600226" url="?curid=761500" title="Colisée de Québec">
<text>Colisée de Québec (later known as Colisée Pepsi, meaning &quot;Pepsi Coliseum&quot;) is a defunct multi-purpose arena located in Quebec City, Quebec. It was the home of the Quebec Nordiques from 1972 to 1995, during their time in the World Hockey Association and National Hockey League. It was also the home of the Quebec Remparts of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League from 1999 until its closing in 2015. The Colisée hosted the Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament each February until its closure in 2015, with almost 2,300 young hockey players from 16 countries participating annually.

==History==
The barrel vault arena was originally built in 1949, seating 10,034, to replace a building on the same site that had burned down a year earlier. Built by architects Rinfret and Bouchard with designs drawn up by Robert Blatter and F. Caron, the arena was a mix of International Style exterior and Art Deco interior. It was known as &quot;The House that Béliveau Built&quot;, as it was often filled to capacity in its early years to watch Jean Béliveau star for the Quebec Aces before he moved up to the NHL and the Montreal Canadiens. Two decades later, sellout crowds came to see Guy Lafleur as a member of the Quebec Remparts, before he too would join the Canadiens.

The Colisée served as the host facility of the Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament from 1960 to 2015, after the tournament originated at the Quebec Arena in Parc Victoria. It was promoted by Gérard Bolduc and Paul Dumont, who also had connections to the Quebec Remparts.

Le Colisée underwent major renovations in 1980. The old entrance was taken down and replaced with a massive glass facade, and the seating capacity was increased to 15,750 to meet NHL standards of that era after the Nordiques made the jump from the WHA to the NHL. PepsiCo bought the naming rights on November 18, 1999, and its final capacity was 15,176. Coincidentally, the former Quebec Nordiques, now known as the Colorado Avalanche, currently play at what was formerly known as Pepsi Center (now Ball Arena) in Denver.

The Philadelphia Flyers played the final five &quot;home&quot; games of the 1967-68 season at the Colisée, after the roof blew off their home arena, the Spectrum.

The arena hosted the 1971 Memorial Cup championship series, in which the Remparts defeated the Edmonton Oil Kings two games to none. Since the championship switched to a tournament format, the Coliseum has hosted it in 1991 and 2003 &amp; 2015. Internationally, the first game of the 1974 Summit Series between Canadian WHA all-stars and the Soviet national team was played at the Coliseum, as were one game in each of the 1976 and 1991 Canada Cups. The arena co-hosted the 1978 World Junior Championships with Montreal and also co-hosted, along with Halifax, the 2008 IIHF World Championships. Rendez-vous &#x27;87, a two-game series between the NHL All-Stars and the Soviet national team, was another highlight in the building&#x27;s history. Colisée Pepsi has also hosted many big concerts, as well as professional wrestling events presented by Canadian Athletic Promotions, All-Star Wrestling, Grand Prix Wrestling, Lutte Internationale and the WWF/WWE.

Quebec City has entertained several proposals in recent years to return NHL ice hockey to the city; prior to the completion of Centre Vidéotron, most of these proposals envisioned using the Colisée as a temporary home while the new arena was built next to the existing facility. On October 10, 2009, Quebec City newspapers such as &quot;Le Soleil&quot; reported that negotiations were held between the city and the NHL concerning the possibility and pertinence of relocating or creating an NHL franchise into the city.

Skatemania 2014 is held on October 25, 2014. The show handling the arts and figure skating produced by Alain Goldberg featuring Sylvain Cossette, Andrée Watters, Marc Hervieux, Jeanick Fournier and also Éléonore Lagacé, Andréanne Martin and Liana Bureau from &quot;La Voix&quot;. Participating athletes among others: Joannie Rochette, Patrick Chan, Shawn Sawyer.

Former Nordiques owner and Canadian Olympic Committee president Marcel Aubut originally said that there were no plans to demolish the Colisée Pepsi even if a new arena was built. Aubut mentioned a prospective future Winter Olympics bid among other justifications for maintaining the existing arena. As part of the agreement constructing the new arena, an additional $7 million was set aside for renovating the Colisée, should the city have landed a potential National Hockey League expansion franchise before the new arena was completed in 2015.

Videotron Centre opened on September 8, 2015. The Colisée&#x27;s final event was a Metallica concert on September 14, 2015 for the Lords of Summer Tour; two days later, the band would also play the first concert at Videotron Centre. The Colisée was then closed to the public, with minimal operations and maintenance since.

In September 2019, the Colisée&#x27;s neon sign was removed pending an expected demolition. ExpoCité announced plans to sell 4,000 of the arena&#x27;s wooden seats to the public on the weekend of October 19 and 20, 2019, while the remaining 11,000 plastic seats would be given to municipalities, schools and other institutions. The city planned to start demolition by summer 2020 and finish by December 18, 2020. It was announced in 2021 that demolition would not proceed, as the building had been leased to be used as storage space. The lease runs until September 2023. In 2024, Quebec City mayor Bruno Marchand stated that he supports demolishing the Colisée.

<doc id="761503" wikidata="Q13479486" url="?curid=761503" title="Kerala mural painting">
<text>Kerala mural paintings are the frescos depicting Hindu mythology in Kerala. Ancient temples and palaces in Kerala, India, display an abounding tradition of mural paintings mostly dating back between the 9th to 12th centuries CE when this form of art enjoyed royal patronage.

The scriptural basis of these paintings can be found in the Sanskrit texts, &quot;Chithrasoothram&quot; - (Chitrasutra is a part of the Vishnu Dharmottara Purana, a book written in Sanskrit about 1500 years ago. It contains 287 short verses in nine chapters and a few prose in the second chapter. There is no other book on painting as detailed as the Chitrasutra. This book answers hundreds of questions about what a painting is, why, its purpose, role, relationship with the painter, connoisseurs, and other arts. Chitrasutra will be useful to understand the true Indian painting.)&quot;Tantrasamuchaya,&quot; the fifteenth century text authored by Narayanan, &quot;Abhilashitartha Chintamani&quot; of the twelfth century and &quot;Silparatna&quot; by Sreekumaran of the sixteenth century. Iconography of the mythological character in murals are based on the Dhyanaslokas.
The murals of Thirunadhikkara Cave Temple (now ceded to Tamil Nadu) and Tiruvanchikulam are considered the oldest relics of Kerala&#x27;s own style of murals. The masterpieces of Kerala mural art include: the Shiva Temple in Ettumanoor, the Ramayana murals of Mattancherry Palace and Vadakkumnatha kshetram.
Other fine mural paintings are depicted in temples at Trikodithanam, Vaikom Temple, Pundarikapuram, Udayanapuram, Triprangode, Guruvayoor, Kumaranalloor, Aymanam, the Vadakkunathan temple in Trichur, the Thodeekkalam temple in Kannur and the Sri Padmanabhaswamy temple at Thiruvananthapuram. Other mural sites are in the churches at Ollur, Chalakkudy, Kanjoor, Edappally, Vechur, and Mulanthuruthy, and at palaces such as the Krishnapuram Palace near Kayamkulam and the Padmanabhapuram Palace.

== Revival ==
Although the traditional mural artisans were under the patronage of various rulers in Kerala, under British administration the art form suffered enormously, even at the danger of extinction. After India&#x27;s independence in 1947, a revival of mural tradition in Kerala took place as major temples in Kerala. The Centre for Study of Mural Paintings, a school established by Guruvayur Dewaswom Board in the Thrissur district of Kerala under the chief instructorship of Mammiyoor Krishnan Kutty Nair, represents this revival phase, as does the Sree Sankaracharya University of Sanskrit in Kalady under the instructorship of Dr.Saju Thuruthil.

== Technique ==
Traditionally the painting involves four different processes,

# Preparation of the ground (granite and laterite walls)
# Sketching of the outline
# Application of colours and 
# Addition of decorative details

Sanskrit texts discuss in detail the style, effectiveness of different colours, desirable combinations that could be brought out by mixing various pigments and methodology of preparing the base for application of colors and for preparation of colors from different natural sources in general terms.

=== Wall preparation ===
Preparing a wall involves three stages of plastering the wall with different substances.

# Plaster of a mixture of lime and clean sand in the ratio 1:2.
# Plaster of a mixture of lime and sand in the ratio 1:2, and cotton (&quot;Gossypium herbaceum&quot;). Cotton is used to give a gleaming white texture to the wall.
# 25-30 washes of a mixture of quick lime and the juice of very tender coconut.

=== Colour preparation ===
Traditional murals used &quot;panchavarana&quot; () exclusively i.e. red, yellow, green, black and white, white being the colour of the wall itself. Colours are prepared from vegetable and mineral pigments. Red is derived from red laterite, yellow is derived from yellow laterite, white from lime, and black from oil-lamp soot. Leaves of &quot;Neelamari&quot; (Indian Indigo; &quot;Indigofera tinctoria&quot; ) plant are squeezed and the extract is used after drying up to be mixed with &quot;Eravikkara (Garcinia morella)&quot; for obtaining the green pigment. Wooden utensils are used for mixing the colours and the binding media used is derived from tender coconut water and extracts from the Neem tree (&quot;Azadirachta indica&quot;).

The characters in the murals are coloured according to their characteristics as illustrated in the relevant Hindu mythological scriptures. Spiritual, divine and dharmic characters (satwika) are depicted in shades of green. Those influenced towards power &amp; materialistic wealth (rajasic) are painted in shades of red to golden yellow. Evil, wicked and mean characters (tamasic) are generally painted in white or black.

<text>Eurymedon (; ; died 413 BC) was one of the Athenian generals (strategoi) during the Peloponnesian War.

==Biography==
In 428 BC, he was sent by the Athenians to intercept the Peloponnesian fleet, which was on its way to attack Corcyra. On his arrival, finding that Nicostratus, with a small squadron from Naupactus, had already secured the island on behalf of Athens, he took command of the combined fleet. Owing to the absence of the Peloponnesians, Eurymedon had no chance to distinguish himself.

In the following summer, in joint command of the Athenian land forces, he ravaged the district of Tanagra. In 425 BC, he was appointed, with Sophocles, the son of Sostratides, to the command of an expedition destined for Sicily. He stopped at Corcyra on the way, in order to assist the democratic party against the oligarchical exiles. However, Eurymedon took no steps to prevent the massacre of the oligarchical exiles. Afterwards, Eurymedon proceeded to Sicily.

Immediately after his arrival in Sicily a pact was proposed by the Syracusan general, Hermocrates, to which Eurymedon and Sophocles were induced to agree. The terms of the pact did not, however, satisfy the Athenians, who blamed its conclusion on bribery. As a result, two of the chief agents in the negotiations were banished, while Eurymedon was sentenced to pay a heavy fine.

In 413 BC Eurymedon, who had been sent with Demosthenes to reinforce the Athenians at the siege of Syracuse, was defeated and slain before reaching land (Thucydides iii., iv., vii.; Diodorus Siculus xiii. 8, 11, 13).

<doc id="761512" wikidata="Q3575947" url="?curid=761512" title="New Madrid seismic zone">
<text>The New Madrid seismic zone (NMSZ), sometimes called the New Madrid fault line (or fault zone or fault system), is a major seismic zone and a prolific source of intraplate earthquakes (earthquakes within a tectonic plate) in the Southern and Midwestern United States, stretching to the southwest from New Madrid, Missouri.

The New Madrid fault system was responsible for the 1811–1812 New Madrid earthquakes and has the potential to produce large earthquakes in the future. Since 1812, frequent smaller earthquakes have been recorded in the area.

Earthquakes that occur in the New Madrid seismic zone potentially threaten parts of seven American states: Illinois, Missouri, Arkansas, Kentucky, Tennessee, and to a lesser extent Mississippi and Indiana.

==Location==
The -long seismic zone, which extends into five states, stretches southward from Cairo, Illinois; through Hayti, Caruthersville, and New Madrid in Missouri; through Blytheville into Marked Tree in Arkansas. It also covers a part of West Tennessee near Reelfoot Lake, extending southeast into Dyersburg. It is southwest of the Wabash Valley seismic zone.

==Geology==
The faults responsible for the NMSZ are embedded in a subsurface geological feature known as the Reelfoot Rift, which likely formed during the Cambrian Period. The Reelfoot Rift was first described by Ervin and McGinnis (1975) and believed to be of late Precambrian age. The rift failed to split the North American continent, but it has remained as an aulacogen (a scar or zone of weakness) deep underground.

This relative weakness is important, as it would allow the relatively small east–west compressive forces associated with the continuing westward continental drift of the North American plate to reactivate old faults around New Madrid, making the area unusually prone to earthquakes in spite of it being far from the nearest tectonic plate boundary.

Since other ancient rifts are known to occur in North America, but not all are associated with modern earthquakes, other processes could be at work to locally increase mechanical stress on the New Madrid faults. Some form of heating in the lithosphere below the area has been suggested to be making deep rocks more plastic, which would concentrate compressive stress in the shallower subsurface area where the faulting occurs.

==History==

The zone had four of the largest earthquakes in recorded North American history, with moment magnitudes estimated to be as large as 7 or greater, all occurring within a 3-month period between December 1811 and February 1812. Many of the published accounts describe the cumulative effects of all the earthquakes, known as the New Madrid Sequence, so finding the individual effects of each quake can be difficult. Magnitude estimates and epicenters are based on interpretations of historical accounts and may vary.

===Prehistoric earthquakes===
As uplift rates associated with large New Madrid earthquakes could not have occurred continuously over geological timescales without dramatically altering the local topography, studies have concluded that the seismic activity there cannot have gone on for longer than 64,000 years, making the New Madrid seismic zone a young feature, or that earthquakes and the associated uplift migrate around the area over time, or that the NMSZ has short periods of activity interspersed with long periods of dormancy.

Archaeological studies have found from studies of sand blows and soil horizons that previous series of very large earthquakes have occurred in the NMSZ in recent prehistory. Based on artifacts found buried by sand blow deposits and from carbon-14 studies, previous large earthquakes like those of 1811–12 appear to have happened around AD 1450 and 900, as well as around AD 300. Evidence has also been found for an apparent series of large earthquakes around 2350 BC. 

About southwest of the presently defined NMSZ, but close enough to be associated with the Reelfoot Rift, near Marianna, Arkansas, two sets of liquefaction features indicative of large earthquakes have been tentatively identified and dated to 3500 and 4800 BC. These features were interpreted to have been caused by groups of large earthquakes timed closely together.

Dendrochronology (tree ring) studies conducted on the oldest bald cypress trees growing in Reelfoot Lake found evidence of the 1811–12 series in the form of fractures followed by rapid growth after their inundation, whereas cores taken from old bald cypress trees in the St. Francis sunklands showed slowed growth in the half century that followed 1812. These were interpreted as clear signals of the 1811–12 earthquake series in tree rings. As the tree ring record in Reelfoot Lake and the St. Francis sunk lands extend back to 1682 and 1321, respectively, Van Arsdale et al. interpret the lack of similar signals elsewhere in the chronology as evidence against large New Madrid earthquakes between those years and 1811.

===December 25, 1699===
The first known written record of an earthquake felt in the NMSZ was from a French missionary traveling up the Mississippi with a party of explorers. At 1 pm on Christmas Day 1699, at a site near the present-day location of Memphis, the party was startled by a short period of ground shaking.

===1811–12 earthquake series===

* December 16, 1811, 0815 UTC (2:15 am); (M about 7.5) epicenter in northeast Arkansas, probably on the Cottonwood Grove fault; it caused only slight damage to man-made structures, mainly due to the sparse population in the epicentral area. The future location of Memphis, Tennessee, was shaken at Mercalli level IX intensity. A seismic seiche propagated upriver, and Little Prairie was destroyed by liquefaction. Local uplifts of the ground and the sight of water waves moving upstream gave observers the impression that the Mississippi River was flowing backwards.
:At New Madrid, trees were knocked down and riverbanks collapsed. This event shook windows and furniture in Washington, DC, rang bells in Richmond, Virginia, sloshed well water and shook houses in Charleston, South Carolina, and knocked plaster off of houses in Columbia, South Carolina. In Jefferson, Indiana, furniture moved, and in Lebanon, Ohio, residents fled their homes. Observers in Herculaneum, Missouri, called it &quot;severe&quot; and said it had a duration of 10–12 minutes.
:Aftershocks were felt every 6-10 minutes, a total of 27, in New Madrid until what was called the Daylight Shock, which was of the same intensity as the first. Many of these were also felt throughout the eastern US, though with less intensity than the initial earthquake.
* December 16, 1811, sometimes termed the &quot;Dawn Shock&quot; or &quot;Daylight Shock&quot;, occurred at 1315 UTC (7:15 am); (M about 7) with the epicenter in northeast Arkansas.
* January 23, 1812, 1515 UTC (9:15 am); (M about 7.3) epicenter around New Madrid, although this is disputed. This was probably the smallest of the three main shocks but resulted in widespread ground deformation, landslides, fissuring, and stream-bank caving in the meizoseismal area. Johnston and Schweig attribute this earthquake to a rupture on the New Madrid North Fault. A minority viewpoint holds that this earthquake&#x27;s epicenter was in southern Illinois. A 2011 expert panel urged further research to clarify this point, stating that the Illinois hypothesis would mean that an extended section of fault exists, perhaps still loaded and capable of hosting a great earthquake in the future.
* February 7, 1812, 0945 UTC (3:45 am); (M about 7.5) epicenter near New Madrid, Missouri. This was the largest event in the series, and it destroyed the town of New Madrid. At St. Louis, Missouri, many houses were severely damaged, and their chimneys were toppled. It appears to have occurred on Reelfoot fault, a reverse fault segment that crosses under the Mississippi River just south of Kentucky Bend and continues to the east as the Lake County Uplift. In this event, uplift along the fault created temporary waterfalls on the Mississippi River, created a wave that propagated upstream, and caused the formation of Reelfoot Lake by damming streams.

===1812–1900===
Hundreds of aftershocks of the 1811–12 series followed over a period of several years. Aftershocks strong enough to be felt occurred until 1817. The largest earthquakes to have occurred since then were on January 4, 1843, and October 31, 1895, with magnitude estimates of 6.0 and 6.6, respectively. The 1895 event had its epicenter near Charleston, Missouri. The quake damaged virtually all the buildings in Charleston, created sand volcanoes by the city, cracked a pier on the Cairo Rail Bridge, and toppled chimneys in St. Louis, Missouri; Memphis, Tennessee; Gadsden, Alabama; and Evansville, Indiana.

===Modern activity===
The largest NMSZ earthquake of the 20th century was a 5.4-magnitude quake on November 9, 1968, near Dale, Illinois. The quake damaged the civic building at Henderson, Kentucky, and was felt in 23 states. People in Boston said their buildings swayed. At the time of the quake, it was the biggest recorded quake with an epicenter in Illinois in that state&#x27;s recorded history. In 2008 in the nearby Wabash Valley seismic zone, a similar magnitude 5.4 earthquake occurred with its epicenter in Illinois near West Salem and Mount Carmel.

Instruments were installed in and around the area in 1974 to closely monitor seismic activity. Since then, more than 4,000 earthquakes have been recorded, most of which were too small to be felt. On average, one earthquake per year is large enough to be felt in the area.

===Potential for future earthquakes===
In a report filed in November 2008, the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency warns that a serious earthquake in the NMSZ could result in &quot;the highest economic losses due to a natural disaster in the United States,&quot; further predicting &quot;widespread and catastrophic&quot; damage across Alabama, Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma, Texas, and particularly Tennessee, where a 7.7 magnitude quake would cause damage to tens of thousands of structures affecting water distribution, transportation systems, and other vital infrastructure. The earthquake is expected to result in many thousands of fatalities, with more than 4,000 of the fatalities expected in Memphis alone.

The potential for the recurrence of large earthquakes and their effects today on densely populated cities in and around the seismic zone has generated much research devoted to understanding the NMSZ. By studying evidence of past quakes and closely monitoring ground motion and current earthquake activity, scientists attempt to understand their causes and recurrence intervals.

In October 2009, a team composed of University of Illinois and Virginia Tech researchers headed by Amr S. Elnashai, funded by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, considered a scenario where all three segments of the New Madrid fault ruptured simultaneously with a total earthquake magnitude of 7.7. The report found that there would be significant damage in the eight states studied – Alabama, Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, and Tennessee – with the probability of additional damage in states farther from the NMSZ. Tennessee, Arkansas, and Missouri would be most severely impacted, and Memphis and St. Louis would be severely damaged. The report estimated 86,000 casualties, including 3,500 fatalities, 715,000 damaged buildings, and 7.2 million people displaced, with two million of those seeking shelter, primarily due to the lack of utility services. Direct economic losses, according to the report, would be at least $300 billion.

===Iben Browning&#x27;s 1990 prediction===

Beginning in February 1989, self-proclaimed climatologist Iben Browning, who claimed to have predicted the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens and the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake – predicted a 50% probability of a magnitude 6.5 to 7.5 earthquake in the New Madrid area sometime between December 1 and December 5, 1990. Browning appears to have based this prediction on particularly strong tidal forces being expected during that time, and his opinion that a New Madrid earthquake was &quot;overdue;&quot; however, seismologists generally agree that no correlation exists between tides and earthquakes. 

The United States Geological Survey (USGS) requested an evaluation of the prediction by an advisory board of earth scientists, who concluded, &quot;the prediction does not have scientific validity.&quot; Despite the lack of scientific support, Browning&#x27;s prediction was widely reported in international media, causing public alarm. The period passed with no major earthquake activity in New Madrid or along the fault line.

===Uncertainty over recurrence potential===
The lack of apparent land movement along the New Madrid fault system has long puzzled scientists. In 2009, two studies based on eight years of GPS measurements indicated that the faults were moving at no more than 0.2 mm (0.008 in.) per year. This contrasts to the rate of slip on the San Andreas Fault, which averages up to per year across California.

On March 13, 2009, a research group based out of Northwestern University and Purdue University, funded by the USGS, reported in &quot;Science&quot; and other journals that the New Madrid system may be &quot;shutting down&quot; and that tectonic stress may now be accumulating elsewhere. Seth Stein, the leader of the research group, published these views in a book, &quot;Disaster Deferred&quot;, in 2008. Although some of these ideas have gained some acceptance among researchers, they have not been accepted by the National Earthquake Prediction Evaluation Council, which advises the USGS. In the November 5, 2009, issue of &quot;Nature&quot;, researchers from Northwestern University and the University of Missouri said that due to the lack of fault movement, the quakes along the faults may only be aftershocks of the 1811–12 earthquakes.

According to the USGS, a broad consensus exists that the possibility of major earthquakes in the NMSZ remains a concern, and that the GPS data do not provide a compelling case for lessening perceived earthquake hazards in the region. One concern is that the small earthquakes that still happen are not diminishing over time, as would be if they were aftershocks of the 1811–12 events; another is that the 4,500-year archaeological record of large earthquakes in the region is more significant than 10 years of direct strain measurement. The USGS issued a fact sheet in 2009 stating the estimate of a 7–10% chance of a New Madrid earthquake of magnitude comparable to one of the 1811–12 quakes within the next 50 years, and a 25–40% chance of a magnitude 6 earthquake in the same time frame. In July 2014, the USGS increased the risk assessment for the New Madrid area.

<text>Naomi Wallace (born 1960) is an American playwright, screenwriter and poet from Kentucky. She is widely known for her plays, and has received several distinguished awards for her work.

==Biography==

Naomi Wallace was born in Prospect, Kentucky, to Henry F. Wallace, a photojournalist and correspondent for &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;Life&quot; magazines, and Sonja de Vries, a Dutch justice and human rights worker.

Wallace obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree from Hampshire College. She then received two master&#x27;s degrees from the University of Iowa. Currently, she divides her time between Kentucky and the Yorkshire Dales in Northern England (UK), where she lives with her partner, Bruce McLeod.

Wallace has taught English literature, poetry and play writing at Yale University, UCLA, Illinois State University, Merrimack College, American University of Cairo, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam and other institutions. In 2024 Wallace lectured at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens and the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki.

She has also worked with women in the criminal justice system, and is a member of Showing up for Racial Justice. She has been called &quot;a dedicated advocate for justice and human rights in the U.S. and abroad, and Palestinian rights in the Middle East,&quot; and her writing described as &quot;muscular, devastating, and unwavering.&quot;

== Activism ==
In the mid-2000s, Wallace was briefly detained by the United States Department of Homeland Security after defying the ban on travel to Cuba.

In August 2016, Wallace was one of the Freedom Riders with the Women&#x27;s Boat to Gaza.

==Publications==

Wallace&#x27;s plays are published in the U.S. by Broadway Play Publishing Inc., Theatre Communications Group, Faber and Faber in the UK, and éditions Théâtrales in France. Wallace&#x27;s work has been produced in the United States, the United Kingdom, Europe, and the Middle East.

==Awards==
Wallace&#x27;s work has received the Susan Smith Blackburn Prize twice, the Joseph Kesselring Prize, the Fellowship of Southern Writers Drama Award, and an Obie Award. She is also a recipient of the MacArthur Fellowship, and a National Endowment for the Arts development grant.

In 2009, &quot;One Flea Spare&quot; was incorporated into the permanent répertoire of the French National Theatre, the Comédie-Française, and produced there in 2012. Only two American playwrights have ever been added to La Comédie&#x27;s repertoire in 300 years: the other being Tennessee Williams. The play was translated into French by Dominique Hollier.

In 2012, Wallace was a recipient of the Horton Foote Prize for most promising new American play.

In 2013, she was awarded the inaugural Windham–Campbell Literature Prize established at Yale University.

In 2015, Wallace received an Arts and Letters Award in Literature from the American Academy of Arts and Letters.

<doc id="761530" wikidata="Q1903609" url="?curid=761530" title="Martin Chuzzlewit">
<text>The Life and Adventures of Martin Chuzzlewit (commonly known as Martin Chuzzlewit) is a novel by English author Charles Dickens, considered the last of his picaresque novels. It was originally serialised between January 1843 and July 1844. While he was writing it Dickens told a friend that he thought it was his best work thus far, but it was one of his least popular novels, judged by sales of the monthly instalments. Characters in this novel gained fame, including Pecksniff and Mrs Gamp.

Like nearly all of Dickens&#x27;s novels, &quot;Martin Chuzzlewit&quot; was first published in monthly instalments. Early sales of the monthly parts were lower than those of previous works, so Dickens changed the plot to send the title character to the United States. Dickens had visited America in 1842 in part as a failed attempt to get the US publishers to honour international copyright laws. He satirized the country as a place filled with self-promoting hucksters, eager to sell land sight unseen. He also unfavourably highlighted slavery and featured characters with racist attitudes and a propensity to violence. In later editions, and in his second visit 24 years later to a much-changed US, he made clear in a speech that it was satire and not a balanced image of the nation and then included that speech in all future editions.

The main theme of the novel, according to Dickens&#x27;s preface, is selfishness, portrayed in a satirical fashion using all the members of the Chuzzlewit family. The novel is also notable for two of Dickens&#x27;s great villains, Seth Pecksniff and Jonas Chuzzlewit. Dickens introduced one of the first literary private detective characters, Mr Nadgett, in this novel. It is dedicated to Angela Georgina Burdett-Coutts, a friend of Dickens.

==Plot summary==
Martin Chuzzlewit has been raised by his grandfather and namesake. Years before, Old Martin took the precaution of raising an orphaned girl, Mary Graham, to be his companion and nursemaid, with the understanding that she would receive income from him only as long as Old Martin lives. Old Martin considers that this gives her a motive to keep him alive, in contrast to his relatives, who want to inherit his money. Young Martin falls in love with Mary and wishes to marry her, conflicting with Old Martin&#x27;s plans. Young Martin and his grandfather argue, each too proud to yield to a resolution. Young Martin leaves home to live on his own, and Old Martin disinherits him.

Young Martin becomes an apprentice, at the late age of 21, to Seth Pecksniff, a relative and greedy architect. Instead of teaching his students, Pecksniff lives off their tuition fees and has them do draughting work that he passes off as his own. He has two spoiled daughters, Charity and Mercy, nicknamed Cherry and Merry. Pecksniff takes Young Martin on to establish closer ties with his wealthy grandfather.

Young Martin befriends Tom Pinch, a kind-hearted soul whose late grandmother gave Pecksniff all she had in the belief that Pecksniff would make an architect and a gentleman of him. Pinch is incapable of believing any of the bad things others tell him of Pecksniff and always defends him vociferously. He works for exploitatively low wages while believing that he is the unworthy recipient of Pecksniff&#x27;s charity, rather than a man of many talents.

Young Martin spends one week at the house of Pecksniff, alone with Tom, as the family spends the week in London. Young Martin draws the designs for a school during that week. When Old Martin learns of his grandson&#x27;s new life, he asks that Pecksniff kick him out. When Pecksniff returns, they argue and Young Martin leaves, once again to make his way alone. Soon, Old Martin and Mary arrive in the area; the former seems to fall under Pecksniff&#x27;s control. During this time Pinch falls in love with Mary, who loves to hear him play the organ, but does not declare his feelings, both because of his shyness and because he knows she is attached to Young Martin. Pecksniff decides that Mary should be his next wife and rudely courts her.

Old Martin&#x27;s brother, Anthony Chuzzlewit, is in business with his son, Jonas. Despite their considerable wealth, they are miserly and cruel. Jonas, eager for the old man to die so that he can inherit, constantly berates his father. Anthony dies abruptly and under suspicious circumstances, leaving his wealth to Jonas. Jonas then woos Cherry, while arguing constantly with Merry. He then abruptly declares to Pecksniff that he wants to marry Merry and jilts Cherry, not without demanding an additional £1,000 on top of the £4,000 that Pecksniff has promised him as Cherry&#x27;s dowry, with the argument that Cherry has better chances for matchmaking.

Jonas becomes entangled with the unscrupulous Montague Tigg, formerly a petty thief and hanger-on of a Chuzzlewit relative, Chevy Slyme, and joins in Tigg&#x27;s crooked insurance business. As Young Martin raises funds in London, Tigg cheats him at the pawn shop of the full value of his valuable pocket watch. Tigg uses the funds to transform himself into a con man with a new personal appearance, calls himself &quot;Tigg Montague&quot; and rents a fine office. This new image convinces investors that he is an important businessman from whom they may greatly profit.

At this time, Pecksniff, in front of Old Martin, orders Pinch out of his house. He does this after eavesdropping on a conversation between Tom and Mary, when Mary tells of Pecksniff&#x27;s villainous designs on her. Pinch suddenly sees the true character of his employer and goes to London to seek new employment. He meets John Westlock, a good friend. Pinch rescues his sister Ruth from mistreatment by the family that employs her as a governess, and the two rent rooms in Islington. Pinch quickly receives an ideal job from a mysterious employer with the help of an equally mysterious Mr Fips.

Meanwhile, Young Martin has encountered cheerful innkeeper Mark Tapley. Deciding his occupation does not reflect well on him because it shows no strength of character to be happy when one has good fortune, Mark heads to London to find a situation to test his cheerfulness by maintaining it in worse circumstances. To this end he accompanies Young Martin to the United States to seek their fortunes. 

Young Martin believes the words of men in New York selling land unseen, along a major American river, thinking that place will need an architect for new buildings. Instead, he and Mark find a swampy, disease-filled, nearly empty settlement. Mark aids a couple who watch their children die in Eden. Young Martin, soon followed by Mark, falls ill of malaria. This grim experience changes Young Martin&#x27;s selfish character, and he takes Mark&#x27;s suggestion to apologize to his grandfather. The men return to England, where Young Martin seeks reconciliation with Old Martin, who is still with Pecksniff. In London, Young Martin reunites with Pinch and meets Westlock. Old Martin shows himself at Pinch&#x27;s office, revealing himself as the mysterious employer. He has been pretending to be in thrall to Pecksniff, while keeping up with other, more important members of his extended family.

While Young Martin was in America, a witness came forward to Westlock who believed Jonas had killed Anthony, using drugs the witness gave him in trade for erasing a gambling debt. Chuffey, who survives his master Anthony, had seen the drugs and prevented Jonas from using them on his father, who died a natural death. The police, including Slyme, have discovered the body of Tigg Montague and have the benefit of the information gathered by Montague&#x27;s investigator, Nadgett, to know the murderer. At the home shared by Jonas, Merry and Mr Chuffey, the police and Old Martin confront Jonas. Jonas is saved of the charge of murdering his father by Chuffey&#x27;s story. He is taken for the murder of Montague, who had fooled him and taken his money. Old Martin takes Merry under his protection, as she was an abused wife, with none of her happy ways left.

Old Martin, with his grandson, Mary and Pinch, confront Pecksniff with their knowledge of his true character. Pecksniff has lost all his funds, as he was taken in by Jonas and Montague. Only his eldest daughter, a shrew who had been jilted on her wedding day, is left to him. Old Martin reveals that he was angry at Young Martin for becoming engaged to Mary because he had planned to arrange that particular match himself, and felt that his glory had been thwarted by their action. Young Martin and his grandfather are reconciled, and Young Martin and Mary are married, as are Ruth Pinch and John Westlock, another former student of Pecksniff. Pinch remains in unrequited love with Mary for the rest of his life, never marrying, and always being a warm companion to Mary, Martin, Ruth and John, who now knows his value and his skills.

==Characters==

===Extended Chuzzlewit family===
Seth Pecksniff is a widower with two daughters, who is a self-styled teacher of architecture. He believes that he is a highly moral individual who loves his fellow man, but he mistreats his students and passes off their designs as his own for profit. He is said to be a cousin of old Martin Chuzzlewit. Pecksniff&#x27;s rise and fall follows the novel&#x27;s plot arc.

Charity and Mercy Pecksniff are the two daughters of Mr Pecksniff. They are also known as Cherry and Merry, or as the two Miss Pecksniffs. Charity is portrayed throughout the book as having none of that virtue after which she is named, while Mercy, the younger sister, is at first laughing and girlish, though later events drastically change her outlook on life.

Old Martin Chuzzlewit, the wealthy patriarch of the Chuzzlewit family, lives in constant suspicion of the financial designs of his extended family. At the beginning of the novel he travels with Mary, an orphan he raised, who is his companion and caretaker. She receives an income while he is alive and is not named in his will; he feels this motivates her to keep him alive. Later in the story, with Mary still his companion, he makes an apparent alliance with Pecksniff, who, he believes, is at least consistent in character. His own true character is revealed by the end of the story.

Young Martin Chuzzlewit is the grandson of old Martin Chuzzlewit. He is the closest relative of old Martin, and has inherited much of the stubbornness and selfishness of the old man. Young Martin is the protagonist of the story. He is 21 years old at the start, and older than the usual apprentice to an architect. His engagement to Mary is the cause of estrangement between himself and his grandfather. By the end of the story he is a reformed character, having realised and repented of the selfishness of his previous actions.

Anthony Chuzzlewit is the brother of old Martin. He and his son, Jonas, run a business called Chuzzlewit and Son. They are both self-serving, hardened individuals who view the accumulation of money as the most important thing in life.

Jonas Chuzzlewit is the mean-spirited, sinisterly jovial son of Anthony Chuzzlewit. He views his father with contempt and wishes for his death, so that he can have the business and the money for himself. He tried to hasten the old man&#x27;s death, but his father&#x27;s friend intervened. He is a suitor of the two Miss Pecksniffs, wins one, then is driven to commit murder by his unscrupulous business associations.

Mr and Mrs Spottletoe are the nephew-in-law and niece of old Martin Chuzzlewit, Mrs Spottletoe being the daughter of old Martin&#x27;s brother. She was also once the favourite of old Martin, but they have since fallen out.

George Chuzzlewit is a bachelor cousin of old Martin.

===Characters in England===
Thomas (Tom) Pinch is a former student of Pecksniff&#x27;s who has become his personal assistant. He is kind, simple and honest in everything he does, serving as a foil to Pecksniff. He carries in his heart an extreme loyalty and admiration for Pecksniff until he discovers Pecksniff&#x27;s true nature through his treatment of Mary, whom Pinch has come to love. Because Tom Pinch plays such a large role in the story he is sometimes considered the novel&#x27;s true protagonist. He started as an apprentice long ago, and is 35 years old when he leaves to start a new life in London.

Ruth Pinch is Tom Pinch&#x27;s sister. She is sweet and good like her brother, and she is beautiful. At first she works as a governess to a wealthy family, but later she and Tom set up home together. She falls in love with, and marries, Tom&#x27;s friend John Westlock.

Mark Tapley, the good-humoured employee of the Blue Dragon Inn and suitor of Mrs Lupin, the landlady of the inn, leaves to find work that might be more of a credit to his character: that is, work sufficiently miserable that his cheerfulness will be more of a credit to him. He eventually joins young Martin Chuzzlewit on his trip to the United States, where he finds at last a situation that requires the full extent of his innate cheerfulness. Martin buys a piece of land in a settlement called Eden, which is in the midst of a malarial swamp. Mark nurses Martin through illness and they eventually return to England. Mark is a few years older than Martin.
Montague Tigg / Tigg Montague is a down-on-his-luck rogue at the beginning of the story, and a hanger-on to a Chuzzlewit cousin named Chevy Slyme. Later Tigg starts the Anglo-Bengalee Disinterested Loan and Life Assurance Company, which pays off early policyholders&#x27; claims with premiums from more recent policyholders. Tigg lures Jonas into the business.

John Westlock ends his 5 years training under Pecksniff as the story opens. His comments about Pecksniff reveal that architect&#x27;s real character to the reader. He is great friends with Tom Pinch. Soon after he leaves Pecksniff, Westlock comes into his inheritance, and he lives in London. After Tom Pinch moves to London, John serves as a mentor and companion to Tom and his sister. He falls in love with and eventually marries Ruth Pinch.

Mr Nadgett is a soft-spoken, mysterious individual who is Tom Pinch&#x27;s landlord and serves as Montague&#x27;s private investigator. He is hired to investigate the private lives of potential clients whom Montague hopes to defraud. It has been claimed that he is the first private investigator in fiction.

Sarah Gamp (also known as Sairey or Mrs Gamp) is an alcoholic who works as a midwife, a monthly nurse and a layer-out of the dead. Even in a house of mourning Mrs Gamp manages to enjoy all the hospitality the house can afford, with little regard for the person she is there to minister to, and she is often much the worse for drink. She constantly refers to a Mrs Harris, who is &quot;a phantom of Mrs Gamp&#x27;s brain ... created for the express purpose of holding visionary dialogues with her on all manner of subjects, and invariably winding up with a compliment to the excellence of her nature&quot;. Mrs Gamp habitually carries with her a battered black umbrella: so popular with the Victorian public was the character that &quot;Gamp&quot; became a slang word for an umbrella in general. It is believed that the character was based on a real nurse described to Dickens by his friend Angela Burdett-Coutts.

Mary Graham is the companion of old Martin Chuzzlewit, who has told her that she will receive nothing from him in his will. She is a beautiful young woman who is loving and loyal. Mary and young Martin Chuzzlewit fall in love. The two lovers are separated by the argument between grandfather and grandson. They are eventually reunited.

Mr Chuffey is Anthony Chuzzlewit&#x27;s old clerk and lifelong companion. Chuffey protects Anthony from his son Jonas.

Bailey is a boy employed first by Mrs Todgers, then by the fraudster Montague Tigg. He is reported to have suffered a fatal head injury in falling out of a cabriolet, though he eventually recovers.

Mrs. Todgers owns the inn or boarding house where the Pecksniffs stay when in London. As it is for male guests only, she houses Charity and Mercy in her own suite of rooms.

===Characters in America===
Jefferson Brick is a war correspondent in &quot;The New York Rowdy Journal&quot;. He typifies the bluster written in American newspapers, which publish every speech made by a local, and have poor knowledge of the world beyond America.

Mr. Bevan is the kind and level-headed American man who meets Martin on his arrival in New York. He aids Martin in returning to England.

==Themes==

The main theme of the novel, according to Dickens&#x27;s preface, is selfishness, portrayed in a satirical fashion using all the members of the Chuzzlewit family.

The novel is also notable for two of Dickens&#x27;s great villains, Seth Pecksniff and Jonas Chuzzlewit.

In keeping with the theme of greed and selfishness in this novel, the Christmas story Dickens published in December 1843, as this novel was being serialized, was &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;.

==Dedication==
This novel is dedicated to Angela Georgina Burdett-Coutts, a friend of Dickens.

==Publication==
&quot;Martin Chuzzlewit&quot; was published in 19 monthly instalments, each comprising 32 pages of text and two illustrations by Phiz and costing one shilling. The last part was double-length.

*I – January 1843 (chapters 1–3)
*II – February 1843 (chapters 4–5)
*III – March 1843 (chapters 6–8)
*IV – April 1843 (chapters 9–10)
*V – May 1843 (chapters 11–12)
*VI – June 1843 (chapters 13–15)
*VII – July 1843 (chapters 16–17)
*VIII – August 1843 (chapters 18–20)
*IX – September 1843 (chapters 21–23)
*X – October 1843 (chapters 24–26)
*XI – November 1843 (chapters 27–29)
*XII – December 1843 (chapters 30–32)
*XIII – January 1844 (chapters 33–35)
*XIV – February 1844 (chapters 36–38)
*XV – March 1844 (chapters 39–41)
*XVI – April 1844 (chapters 42–44)
*XVII – May 1844 (chapters 45–47)
*XVIII – June 1844 (chapters 48–50)
*XIX-XX – July 1844 (chapters 51–54)

The early monthly numbers were not as successful as Dickens&#x27;s previous work and sold about 20,000 copies each, as compared to 40,000 to 50,000 for the monthly numbers of the &quot;Pickwick Papers&quot; and &quot;Nicholas Nickleby&quot;, and 60,000 to 70,000 for the weekly issues of &quot;Barnaby Rudge&quot; and &quot;The Old Curiosity Shop&quot;. The lack of success of the novel caused a rift between Dickens and his publishers Chapman and Hall when they invoked a penalty clause in his contract requiring him to pay back money they had lent him to cover their costs.

Dickens responded to the disappointing early sales of the monthly parts compared to sales of previous works as monthly instalments; he changed the plot to send the title character to the United States. This allowed the author to portray the United States, which he had visited in 1842, satirically, as a near-wilderness with pockets of civilisation filled with deceitful and self-promoting hucksters.

Dickens&#x27;s satire of American modes and manners in the novel won him no friends on the other side of the Atlantic, where the instalments containing the offending chapters were greeted with a &quot;frenzy of wrath&quot;. As a consequence Dickens received abusive mail and newspaper clippings from the United States.

==Satire of 1840s America==
The novel has been seen by some Americans as unfairly critical of the United States, although Dickens himself wrote it as satire similar in spirit to his &quot;attacks&quot; on certain people and particular institutions back home in England, in novels such as &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;. Dickens was serious about reforms in his home country and is credited with achieving changes, notably in the workhouse system and child labour. Such satirical depictions by him and other authors contributed to the call for legislative reform.

Fraud in selling land sight unseen was shown as a common event in the United States of the 1840s. Most Americans were satirically portrayed: they proclaim their equality and their love of freedom and egalitarianism at every opportunity. Those who have travelled to England claim to have been received only by aristocrats. One character, Mr Bevan, is the voice of reason with a balanced view of his nation and a useful friend to Martin and Mark. Another American character, Mrs Hominy, described The United States as &quot;so maimed and lame, so full of sores and ulcers, foul to the eye and almost hopeless to the sense, that her best friends turn from the loathsome creature with disgust&quot;.

Dickens attacks the institution of slavery in the United States in the following words: &quot;Thus the stars wink upon the bloody stripes; and Liberty pulls down her cap upon her eyes, and owns oppression in its vilest aspect for her sister. The institution of slavery had not been practised in England since the 12th century and Britain outlawed the slave trade in the British Empire in 1807 and provided for the gradual abolition of slavery in most parts of the British Empire in 1833 so the sight of slaves and the still lively debates on keeping or abolishing the practice in the US were an easy stimulant for satire by an English writer.

George L. Rives wrote that &quot;It is perhaps not too much to say that the publication of &quot;Martin Chuzzlewit&quot; did more than almost any other one thing to drive the United States and England in the direction of war&quot; over the Oregon boundary dispute, which was eventually resolved via diplomacy rather than war.

In 1868, Dickens returned to the US and at a banquet in his honour hosted by the press in New York City, delivered an after-dinner speech in which he acknowledged the positive transformation which the United States had undergone and apologized for his previous negative reaction on his visit decades before. Furthermore, he announced that he would have the speech appended to each future edition of &quot;American Notes&quot; and &quot;Martin Chuzzlewit&quot;, and the volumes have been emended as such in all successive publications.

==Adaptations and references==

<doc id="761536" wikidata="Q1848810" url="?curid=761536" title="Manchester Velodrome">
<text>Manchester Velodrome is an indoor Olympic-standard cycle-racing track in Manchester, England, which opened in 1994. Part of the National Cycling Centre, the facility has been home to British Cycling since 1994, coinciding with the nation&#x27;s rise to track cycling dominance at World and Olympic level. The velodrome was also home to UCI ProTeam Ineos Grenadiers, formerly known as Team Sky between 2010 and 2019, a period when the team won 6 Tour de France, 2 Vuelta a España and 1 Giro d&#x27;Italia with Great Britain riders.

The Manchester Velodrome has been cited as the major catalyst for Britain&#x27;s successes in track and road cycling and has been described by &quot;Cycling Weekly&quot; as the &quot;beating heart of British Cycling’s ascension to the top of world cycling&quot;.

For 18 years from opening, it was the only indoor Olympic-standard track in the United Kingdom before the completion of the Lee Valley VeloPark for the 2012 Summer Olympics. It is one of the busiest velodromes in the world used by both professional cyclists and members of the public from 8am to 10pm.

The venue hosted track cycling for the 2002 Commonwealth Games and forms part of the Sportcity complex, located adjacent to the City of Manchester Stadium, host stadium for the 2002 Games and home of Manchester City F.C. It has also hosted the UCI Track Cycling World Championships in 1996, 2000 and 2008, hosts regular meets of the Revolution track cycling series and now hosts Six-day racing. The National Indoor BMX Arena adjacent opened in 2011 and the Velodrome can be accessed from the Metrolink Velopark tram stop on the East Manchester Line.

==Velodrome==
The Manchester Velodrome was developed as a joint venture between Sport England, Manchester City Council and British Cycling, who recognised the need for an Olympic-standard facility in the United Kingdom to improve British track cycling. Funding was provided by the government, through the Department of the Environment (£6.5m), the Sports Council (£2m) and the Foundation for Sport and the Arts (£1m). Manchester City Council is the freehold owner and the centre is managed by the Eastlands Trust (formerly named the Velodrome Trust). The Velodrome was dismissed by some as a potential white elephant prior to opening – concerns that were later unfounded with the facility well used by the public and a key part of Britain&#x27;s ascension to the top of track cycling.

The velodrome was designed by FaulknerBrowns Architects and has garnered a reputation for speed since its opening. The centre&#x27;s roof structure is based around a 122-metre, 200 tonne arch allowing for an unrestricted viewing area for spectators. Covered by an aluminium roof, the total structure weighs around 600 tonnes. The track is 250 metres long and its bankings reach 42 degrees in the middle. The track is as steep at the top as it is on the black (racing) line. On 21 May 2007 the velodrome closed for resurfacing in Siberian pine at a cost of £400,000. It reopened on 16 July 2007, and is considered a smoother ride.

By 30 March 2008, more than 15 world records had been set, including Chris Boardman&#x27;s 1996 and 2000 hour records and the 4000 metre team pursuit record set by the Great Britain men&#x27;s team at the 2008 World Championships.

The UCI hour record set by Boardman in the Best Human Effort category in 1996, was rescinded by UCI in 2000 and subsequent attempts at breaking Eddy Merckx&#x27;s 1972 record stopped as UCI believed advanced bicycle technology gave cyclists too much help. Boardman set out to break the record on a bike comparable to Eddy Merckx&#x27;s 1972 machine. He surpassed the record at the velodrome in 2000, achieving a distance of 49.444km as against the 1972 record of 49.431 km, and then retired.

The velodrome has become a popular venue for cyclists with taster and practice sessions frequently booked up several weeks in advance. In 2011, the National Indoor BMX Arena was opened next to the velodrome. Plans proposed in 2012 included a mountain bike trail on Clayton Vale, which would be the first facility of its kind in the United Kingdom and would aim to replicate Britain&#x27;s performance on the track in mountain biking.

==Events==

===Revolution===
The Revolution Series opened in 2003 to build on events such as the world championships and World Cup meetings and provide more regular events. There were four Revolution events over the winter of 2003–04. They built good crowds. The seventh, in 2005, sold all the seats with further fans standing. The first official sell-out was Revolution 14. The series of sprint and endurance events runs on Saturday nights. Internationals compete with British stars and up-and-coming talent. Some riders have retired at Revolution events, rewarded with a retirement presentation. A Future Stars competition has races for young riders aged 15 or 16 to test their sprint and endurance. Olympic riders Jason Kenny and Steven Burke came up through this series. In 2012 it was announced that Revolution events would take place at the recently opened London Velodrome and Glasgow Velodrome from 2013.

===Other events===
On 2 July 2009 Kraftwerk performed at the velodrome as part of the 2009 Manchester International Festival. As they performed &quot;Tour de France&quot;, four members of the British Olympic cycling team entered and rode laps of the track.

<text>Earle Lewis Ovington (December 20, 1879 – July 21, 1936) was an American aeronautical engineer, aviator and inventor, and served as a lab assistant to Thomas Edison. Ovington piloted the first official airmail flight in the United States in a Blériot XI on September 23, 1911. He carried a sack of mail from Nassau Boulevard aerodrome, Garden City, New York, to Mineola, New York. He circled at 500 feet and tossed the bag over the side of the cockpit and the sack burst on impact, scattering letters and postcards. He delivered 640 letters and 1,280 postcards, including a letter to himself from the United States Post Office Department designating him as &quot;Official Air Mail Pilot #1.&quot;

==Biography==
He was born on December 20, 1879, in Chicago, Illinois. He married Adelaide in 1911 and they had two children: Earle Kester Ovington (1912–2006) and Audrey Ovington (1914-2005) He built a house in the Samarkand area of Santa Barbara, California, which included an airstrip. While this airstrip wasn&#x27;t the ultimate site of the Santa Barbara Municipal Airfield, it did serve in that capacity until Ovington&#x27;s death. He died on July 21, 1936. He was cremated and his ashes were scattered at sea.

<doc id="761542" wikidata="Q2720529" url="?curid=761542" title="Gareth Evans (philosopher)">
<text>Michael Gareth Justin Evans (12 May 1946 – 10 August 1980) was a British philosopher who made substantial contributions to logic, philosophy of language and philosophy of mind. He is best known for his posthumous work &quot;The Varieties of Reference&quot; (1982), edited by John McDowell. The book considers different kinds of reference to objects, and argues for a number of conditions that must obtain for reference to occur.

==Life==
Gareth Evans was born in London on 12 May 1946. He was educated at Dulwich College and University College, Oxford (1964–67) where he read Philosophy, Politics and Economics (PPE). His philosophy tutor was Peter Strawson, one of the most eminent Oxford philosophers of the time. Evans became close friends with philosopher Derek Parfit and other prominent members of his academic field such as Christopher Peacocke and Crispin Wright. He was a senior scholar at Christ Church, Oxford (1967–68) and a Kennedy Scholar at Harvard University and University of California, Berkeley (1968–69).

Evans then returned to Oxford, where he was a fellow (1969–1979) and then, from 1979, the Wilde Reader in Mental Philosophy. During this time he also held visiting positions at the University of Minnesota (1971) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (1977–8).

He died in London in 1980 of cancer at the age of 34. His collected papers (1985) and his major work, &quot;The Varieties of Reference&quot; (1982), edited by John McDowell, were published posthumously.

Gregory McCulloch, in &quot;The&quot; &quot;Oxford Companion to Philosophy&quot;, writes of Evans that his &quot;very early death was, like Ramsey&#x27;s, a serious loss for British philosophy.&quot; In the acknowledgements of his &quot;Reasons and Persons&quot; Derek Parfit writes &quot;I owe much to the intensity of his love of truth, and his extraordinary vitality.&quot;

==Work==
In his brief career Evans made substantial contributions to logic, metaphysics, philosophy of language, and philosophy of mind. Important influences on his work included Strawson and Michael Dummett amongst others. His research, according to Rick Grush, &quot;aimed at understanding semantics, and he produced seminal work on proper names, pronouns, indexicals, demonstratives, and vagueness.&quot;

Evans was one of many in the UK who took up the project of developing formal semantics for natural languages, initiated by Donald Davidson in the 1960s and 1970s. He co-edited &quot;Truth and Meaning&quot; (1976) with John McDowell on this subject. He also wrote a paper, &quot;The Causal Theory of Names&quot; (1973), which heavily criticised certain lines of the theory of reference that derived from Saul Kripke&#x27;s &quot;Naming and Necessity&quot; (1972/1980) and work by Keith Donnellan.

A one-page paper on metaphysical vagueness in &quot;Analysis&quot;, &quot;Can There Be Vague Objects?&quot; (1978), drew dozens of papers in response and is now considered a key work in metaphysics.

===&quot;The Varieties of Reference&quot;===
Evans&#x27; book &quot;The Varieties of Reference&quot; (1982) was unfinished at the time of his death. The introduction and first two chapters being rewritten by him in the last months of his life. It was edited for publication, and supplemented with appendices drawn from his notes, by McDowell. It has subsequently been influential in both philosophy of mind and philosophy of language. Its central chapters have, according to Martin Davies, had &quot;a profound influence on subsequent work in philosophy of psychology, particularly concerning the perception and representation of space, and more generally the conditions for an objective conception of a spatial world.&quot;

====Background====
The theory of reference prior to the 1970s was dominated by the view that the meaning of an ordinary name is a description of its object: so, for example, &quot;Aristotle&quot; means &quot;the author of &quot;De Caelo&quot;.&quot; This was Russell&#x27;s view, and was and is taken by many to be equivalent to Frege&#x27;s view (where the &quot;description&quot; is what Frege calls a term&#x27;s &quot;sense&quot;). Following Kripke&#x27;s &quot;Naming and Necessity&quot; (1972/1980) lectures, the view came to prevail that names had no descriptive content, or sense: that the referent of a name was not what &quot;fit&quot; its meaning, but whichever object had been the initial cause of the name&#x27;s being used.

====Evans&#x27;s project====
Evans concedes that names do not in general have descriptive meanings (although he contends that they could, in some cases), but argues that the proponents of the new theory had much too simplistic a view. He argues for what he calls &quot;Russell&#x27;s principle&quot;: that a person cannot be thinking about an object unless he knows, in some non-trivial way, which object he is thinking about. In particular, Evans argues that a person must have a &quot;discriminating conception&quot; of the object (1982, p. 65).

From Russell&#x27;s work, Evans also draws the point that some of the thoughts one has (thoughts about objects one is perceiving, for example) are such that if their object did not exist it would not be possible to think that thought at all. These he calls &quot;Russellian thoughts&quot;.

He then claims that a certain version of the new theory, which he calls the &quot;photograph model&quot; of mental representation (1982, p. 78), violates Russell&#x27;s principle. According to the photograph model, &quot;the causal antecedents of the information involved in a mental state... are claimed to be sufficient to determine which object the state concerns&quot; (1982, p. 78). (The view is so named because it is similar to the view many people take on how a photograph comes to be about something.) Thus, on the photograph model, contrary to Russell&#x27;s principle, one may have a thought about some object without discriminating knowledge of that object, just so long as the mental state is caused in the appropriate way (for example, perhaps by some sort of causal chain that originates with the object).

Evans argues that any causal theory of reference, like that of the photograph model, must be restricted in certain ways: it is necessary to consider, one by one, the various kinds of Russellian thoughts people can have about objects, and to specify in each case what conditions must be met for them to meet Russell&#x27;s principle—only under those conditions can one have a thought about a specific object or objects (a &quot;singular thought&quot;).

In particular, Evans discusses at length what he calls the &quot;generality constraint&quot;. Evans states it thus:

The generality constraint, according to Evans, is intended to capture the structure that there is in thought. As Evans puts it, &quot;The thought that John is happy has something in common with the thought that Harry is happy, and the thought that John is happy has something in common with the thought that John is sad&quot; (1982, p. 100). The generality constraint requires that if one is to have a thought (that John is happy, for example) about an object (John), then one must be able to conceive of the object (John) as having different properties (such as being sad).

He also defends a reading of Frege, derived in part from Michael Dummett&#x27;s work, according to which Frege&#x27;s notion of sense is not equivalent to a description, and indeed remains essential to a theory of reference that abandoned descriptivism (1982, §1.3).

====Kinds of reference====
The bulk of the text considers three kinds of reference to objects, and argues for a number of conditions that must obtain for reference to occur.

He considers first demonstrative reference, where one speaks or thinks about an object visible in one&#x27;s vicinity. He argues that these presuppose, among other things: having a correct conception of the kind of object that it is; the ability to conceive of it and oneself as located in an objective space, and to orient oneself within that space; that one must move smoothly through time and space and be able to track the object&#x27;s movements continuously in perception.

He next considers reference to oneself and then reference by way of a capacity for recognition: one&#x27;s ability to (re-)identify an object when presented with it, even if it is not available at present. Evans famously considers the phenomenon of &quot;immunity to error through misidentification&quot;—a phenomenon of certain types of judgment in which one cannot be wrong about which object the judgment is about by misidentifying it (see his 1982, especially §6.6 &amp; §7.2). This phenomenon may be exemplified by the incoherence of the following judgment (upon feeling pain): &quot;Someone seems to be feeling pain, but is it &quot;I&quot; who is feeling the pain?&quot;. While this phenomenon has been noticed by philosophers before, Evans argues that they have tended to think that it only applies to judgments concerning oneself and one&#x27;s conscious experiences, and so they have failed to recognise that it is a more general phenomenon that can occur in any sort of demonstrative judgment. Furthermore, he would charge philosophers such as Ludwig Wittgenstein (in his &quot;Blue and Brown Books&quot; [1958]) and Elizabeth Anscombe (in her &quot;The First Person&quot; [1975]) for having wrongly concluded that such cases show that the first-person pronoun &quot;I&quot; does not refer to anything.

====Language issues====
In the last third of the book Evans turns to problems with reference to objects that actively depend on the use of language. Here he treats the use of proper names, which do not seem to presuppose as much knowledge on the part of the speaker as demonstrative or recognition-based identification. One can refer to an object one has never encountered using a name if the name was received in the right sort of linguistic (social) practice—even, apparently, if one has no true beliefs about the object. He also considers problems of reference to objects in fictions and hallucinations, and to the meaning of saying that something exists which does not (here he draws explicitly on Kripke&#x27;s John Locke Lectures titled &quot;Reference and Existence&quot;).

<doc id="761546" wikidata="Q381902" url="?curid=761546" title="Gareth Evans (politician)">
<text>Gareth John Evans (born 5 September 1944), is an Australian politician, international policymaker, academic, and barrister. He represented the Labor Party in the Senate and House of Representatives from 1978 to 1999, serving as a Cabinet Minister in the Hawke and Keating governments from 1983 to 1996 as Attorney-General, Minister for Resources and Energy, Minister for Transport and Communications and most prominently, from 1988 to 1996, as Minister for Foreign Affairs. He was Leader of the Government in the Senate from 1993 to 1996, Deputy Leader of the Opposition from 1996 to 1998, and remains one of the two longest-serving federal Cabinet Ministers in Labor Party history.

After leaving politics, he was president and chief executive officer of the Brussels-based International Crisis Group from 2000 to 2009. On returning to Australia he was appointed in 2009 honorary professorial fellow at the University of Melbourne. He has served on a number of major international commissions and panels, including as co-chair of the International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty (2000–01) and the International Commission on Nuclear Non-proliferation and Disarmament (2008–10). Evans has written extensively on international relations and legal, constitutional and political affairs, and has been internationally recognised for his contributions to the theory and practice of mass atrocity and conflict prevention, arms control and disarmament.

From 2010 to 2020, Evans was the Chancellor of the Australian National University (ANU). He was appointed an Honorary Professorial Fellow at the ANU in 2012.

==Early life and education==
Evans was born in Melbourne, Victoria. His father was a tram driver, and his mother, who had been a wartime Woolworths store manager, ran a small baby-wear business from home. He was educated at Hawthorn West Central School (1950–57); Melbourne High School, where he was school captain (1958–61); the University of Melbourne (1962–67) where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Laws with First-Class Honours, sharing the Supreme Court Prize, was a Member of the Melbourne University Law Review and was President of the Students Representative Council from 1964 to 1966; and Magdalen College, Oxford (1968–70), where he attended on a Shell scholarship and graduated with a Master of Arts with First-Class Honours in Philosophy, Politics and Economics (PPE).

==Career==
In 2004, he was elected an Honorary Fellow of Magdalen College, his alma mater at Oxford.

From 1971 to 1976, he was law academic at the University of Melbourne, teaching crime, torts, civil liberties law and federal constitutional law, and becoming a prominent commentator on legal issues, especially at the time of the dismissal of the Whitlam Government in 1975. In 1977 he edited &quot;Labor and the Constitution&quot; 1972–75, a collection of essays on constitutional issues arising during the life of the Whitlam government, and later co-authored &quot;Australia&#x27;s Constitution&quot;, arguing for major constitutional reforms. From 1976 to his entry into the Parliament he practised full-time as a barrister, specialising in industrial law, and appellate argument, and became a Queen&#x27;s Counsel (in Victoria and the ACT) in 1983.

Evans was active in civil liberties issues from his student days on, campaigning on issues such as censorship, capital punishment, the White Australia policy, apartheid and abortion law reform. He was a long-serving vice-president of the Victorian Council for Civil Liberties (now Liberty Victoria), and an active executive member of the Victorian Aboriginal Legal Service.

During the Whitlam Labor government, he acted as a consultant to Aboriginal Affairs Minister Gordon Bryant, advising on Indigenous land rights and legal services issues, and Attorney-General Lionel Murphy, where he was closely involved in drafting the &quot;Racial Discrimination Act 1975&quot; and the (unsuccessful) Human Rights Bill 1973. He was appointed by Murphy as a foundation member of the Australian Law Reform Commission, chaired by Justice Michael Kirby, and was primarily responsible for the commission&#x27;s 1975 report on &quot;Criminal Investigation&quot;.

Evans joined the Australian Labor Party while at University of Melbourne and became actively involved after his return from Oxford in 1975, joining the centrist Labor Unity faction and working closely with its leaders including Clyde Holding, Peter Redlich and Ian Turner – and Bob Hawke, whose ambition to lead the party he strongly supported. He was an unsuccessful Labor candidate for the Senate in 1975, but was elected in 1977 and took his seat in 1978.

==Parliamentary and ministerial career==
===Opposition, 1978–1983===

As a young backbencher, Evans was one of the two parliamentarians chosen to sit – along with international architects I. M. Pei and John Andrews – on the Parliament House Competition Assessment Panel which in 1979 chose the winning design for the new Australian Parliament House.

In his first years in the Senate, Evans focused strongly on legal and constitutional reform issues, attracting early attention with his series of attacks on Sir Garfield Barwick, for potential conflict of interest between his role as the Chief Justice of the High Court and his involvement in his family company Mundroola. After the October 1980 election he was promoted to the Opposition front bench in 1980, becoming Shadow Attorney-General.

Evans played an active part in ALP National Conferences during this period seeking to modernize the party&#x27;s platform, in particular the language of the &quot;socialist objective&quot;, and within the Parliamentary Party in developing a detailed &quot;transition to government&quot; strategy. He supported Bob Hawke&#x27;s leadership challenge against Bill Hayden in 1982 which led ultimately to Hayden resigning just hours before Malcolm Fraser announced the March 1983 election and Hawke leading Labor to victory.

===Attorney-General, 1983–1984===

As Attorney-General, Evans undertook a large agenda for law reform on a range of issues. He immediately ran into controversy, arranging for the Royal Australian Air Force to take surveillance photos of the Franklin Dam project in Tasmania. The Hawke government was pledged to (and ultimately did) stop the project, over the objections of the Tasmanian Liberal government, on the ground that it endangered a World Heritage listed area. The Hawke government was accused of misusing the RAAF for domestic political purposes, and Evans&#x27;s use of RAAF planes led to his earning the nickname &quot;Biggles&quot;, after Captain W. E. Johns&#x27;s fictional aviation hero – a self-inflicted wound, following his remark to journalists at the time &quot;whatever you do, don&#x27;t call me Biggles&quot;. This incident also led to Evans coining the expression &quot;streaker&#x27;s defence&quot; (i.e. &quot;it seemed like a good idea at the time&quot;), which has entered the Australian vocabulary. More serious controversy surrounded the Government&#x27;s handling of national security issues including the Combe-Ivanov affair and the attempted suppression of publication of leaked documents by journalist Brian Toohey, and the allegations of impropriety made against High Court Justice Lionel Murphy, all of which created stress for Evans as an avowed civil libertarian. He achieved a number of reforms, including the establishment of the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions and the National Crime Authority, the strengthening of the Family Law and &quot;Freedom of Information Act&quot;, and some business regulation changes, but failed in his attempts to achieve uniform national defamation law, a legislative bill of rights, and constitutional reform. In a demotion following this mixed record, Hawke moved him to the less sensitive portfolio of Resources and Energy after the 1984 election.

===Resources, energy, transport and communications, 1984–1988===

In the two major industry portfolios he held over the next five years, Evans was generally perceived as playing himself back into the government mainstream. As Minister for Resources and Energy from 1984 to 1987 he won industry support for his role in rescuing from possible collapse of the huge North West Shelf gas project, managing the Australian fallout from the crash in world oil prices in 1986, and seeking to strike a workable balance, between resource sector and competing interests, on uranium mining, the environment and Aboriginal land rights.

In February 1987, shortly after his appointment as Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Evans caused controversy by making comments comparing a Senate debate to rape, stating &quot;that if rape is inevitable, one might as well if not enjoy it, at least succumb with such grace as one can muster in the circumstances&quot;. His ALP colleague Susan Ryan asked him to withdraw the comment, but he refused to do so. The Canberra Rape Crisis Centre requested that Evans apologise and staged a protest in the public gallery of the Senate two days later. On the same day, Evans caused further controversy by comparing three female Liberal senators to a half-back line and stated that they were among &quot;things [that] frighten me&quot;. In a personal explanation to the Senate he said his remarks were a throwaway line and that he &quot;did not say, nor would I ever say, in jest or otherwise, that rape could ever be enjoyed&quot;.

As Transport and Communications minister in 1987–88, he was involved in some controversy with the Australian Broadcasting Commission over funding guarantees and charter reform, but primarily concerned with issues at the heart of the government&#x27;s micro-economic strategy: major airline deregulation, and the reform of government business enterprises in the telecommunications and other sectors, designed to corporatize their commercial practices, as a necessary prelude to the privatisation that later followed.

===Minister for Foreign Affairs, 1988–1996===

Evans was appointed Foreign Minister in September 1988, after his predecessor Bill Hayden retired to become Governor-General. He held the position for seven years and six months, the longest-serving Labor minister in that portfolio, since Evatt. He became a well-known Foreign Minister and highly regarded internationally, and continues to be regarded as one of Australia&#x27;s most successful. The Hawke and Keating governments were committed to shifting emphasis from Australia&#x27;s traditional relationships with the United States and the United Kingdom to increased involvement with Asian neighbours, particularly Indonesia and China, and were strongly committed to multilateral diplomacy both globally and regionally.

Evans brought a strongly structured and analytical approach to foreign policymaking and is credited with significant innovative thinking in his articulation, in particular, of the concepts of middle power and niche diplomacy, &quot;good international citizenship&quot; as a national interest, and cooperative security (see &quot;Contributions to international relations thinking&quot;, below).

His most widely acknowledged successes as foreign minister were his initiation of the UN peace plan for Cambodia, and the roles that he and Australia played in bringing to fruition the International Chemical Weapons Convention and establishing both the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum and the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF). Major contributions to international agenda setting, though not bearing much immediate fruit, were his book on UN reform launched in New York City in 1993, and his initiation with Paul Keating of the Canberra Commission on the Elimination of Nuclear Weapons.

In 1990, Evans famously became the first person to drop the f-bomb in the Australian Parliament, interjecting &quot;for fuck&#x27;s sake&quot; during a speech by Senator Robert Hill. Despite his reputation as a negotiator he was widely reputed to be in possession of a short-temper with a particular intolerance for elected representatives of the Australian Greens.

Evans ran into significant controversy on two major issues: relations with Indonesia over East Timor and French Nuclear Tests in the Pacific. Evans continues to be strongly criticised by many commentators – most prominently Noam Chomsky and John Pilger – for supporting Australia&#x27;s recognition of Indonesian sovereignty over East Timor following its military invasion in 1975, negotiating (and celebrating &quot;replete with champagne&quot;) with then Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas the Timor Gap Treaty, and describing the 1991 Dili massacre as &quot;an aberration, not an act of state policy&quot;. Evans has replied at length to these charges in various forums, acknowledging that the Indonesian military&#x27;s behaviour had been appalling and conceding that Australia had been too optimistic about its capacity for redemption, but arguing, that de jure recognition by Australian (and other) governments had never denied the continuing right of the East Timorese to self-determination; that he personally had worked hard (as subsequently acknowledged by José Ramos-Horta) to achieve real autonomy for East Timor as the only realistic option before the events of 1997; and that independent East Timor had fully inherited the benefits of the Timor Gap Treaty. The Timor Gap Treaty was replaced by the Timor Sea Treaty after East Timor&#x27;s independence in 2002. However, after the Australia-East Timor spying scandal came to light, East Timor terminated the treaties, which were favorable to Australia. In 2018, the treaty in force today was concluded, which is far more favorable to East Timor.

When in June 1995 the resumption of French underground nuclear tests at Moruroa Atoll was announced, Evans generated a storm of press and public criticism for remarking that while Australia deplored the decision &quot;it could have been worse&quot;. This was strictly accurate as the test series was limited in number, and France promised to then permanently close the test facility and join the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty negotiations, but it politically damaged Evans and his party.

===Leader of the government in the Senate, 1993–1996===

In 1993, as a member of the Keating government, Senator Evans became Leader of the Government in the Senate, replacing the retiring John Button, whose Deputy he had been since 1987. In this position he led the government&#x27;s domestic legislative agenda in the upper house, where the government did not have a majority, and every bill had to be negotiated with the minor parties. In what was described at the time as &quot;perhaps the finest moment in his political career&quot;, he played the leading role in getting the government&#x27;s Native Title Act 1993 through the Senate in one of the Parliament&#x27;s longest-ever debates following the High Court of Australia&#x27;s decision in &quot;Mabo v Queensland&quot;.

===Return to opposition, 1996–1999===

Evans had long desired to move from the Senate to the House of Representatives, where he hoped to pursue leadership ambitions. His first attempt to do so, in 1984, had been thwarted by the Socialist Left faction, but in 1996 he gained endorsement for the seat of Holt, in Melbourne&#x27;s eastern suburbs, and was elected at the 1996 election. He was elected Deputy Leader of the Labor Party, defeating Simon Crean, and appointed Shadow Treasurer by Leader Kim Beazley. As Deputy Leader Evans led a major policy review in every shadow portfolio area, and during 1997 orchestrated in secret the defection to the Labor Party of the popular leader of the Australian Democrats, Senator Cheryl Kernot, who resigned from the Senate in October and became a Labor House of Representatives candidate at the 1998 election. The political triumph of the defection was, however, soured by the later revelation – by Laurie Oakes in his column in &quot;The Bulletin&quot; in 2002 – that Evans and Kernot had been having an affair at the time.

Evans, after eighteen years in the Senate, found the transition to the much rowdier and fast-paced lower house environment not easy to manage, and – with Australia sailing comfortably through the 1997 Asian financial crisis – also found it difficult to get traction with his own economic policy brief. He also did not enjoy the move to opposition after thirteen years in government, coining the expression &quot;relevance deprivation syndrome&quot;, which – while he was criticised more than applauded for his honesty at the time – is now entrenched in the national vocabulary. His biographer, Keith Scott, commented that &quot;Overwhelmingly, Evans&#x27;s period as deputy leader and shadow treasurer – from March 1996 to October 1998 – was his least successful in federal parliament&quot;. Labor&#x27;s defeat at the 1998 election led to Evans&#x27;s resignation from the opposition front bench, and in September 1999 he resigned from Parliament causing a by-election, which was later won by Labor candidate Anthony Byrne.

Throughout his time as a member of both houses of Parliament, Evans served in three of the four leadership positions, deputy Senate leader, Senate leader and deputy leader in the House of Representatives.

==International activity after politics==
===International Crisis Group===
In 1994, while Foreign Minister of Australia, Evans committed his government to donate $500,000 as initial funding for Brussels-based conflict prevention and resolution organisation, the International Crisis Group (ICG).

From 2000 to 2009 Evans was president and CEO of the ICG, which during his tenure grew in staff from 25 to over 130, in budget from $US2 million to over $15 million, and in operating area from a handful of countries in the Balkans and Central Africa to over 60 across four continents, and published 784 worldwide-distributed reports.

The ICG made important contributions during this period in early-warning bellringing in cases like Darfur and Ethiopia-Eritrea, supporting conflict mediation in situations like Southern Sudan, Kosovo and Aceh, making path-breaking recommendations on Israel-Palestine, Iran and Burma/Myanmar, analysing the different strands of Islamism, and generally providing timely and detailed field-based analysis and recommendations to policymakers on hundreds of separate conflict-related issues.

Although subject to occasional attack for the positions it has taken, the ICG was firmly established by the time of Evans&#x27;s departure, and has remained, the preeminent international NGO working on the prevention and resolution of deadly conflict, praised by leaders across the spectrum from Condoleezza Rice to Hillary Clinton, and regularly being identified as one of the world&#x27;s most influential think tanks.

===The responsibility to protect===

In 2000–2001 Evans co-chaired, with Mohamed Sahnoun, the International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty (ICISS), appointed by the government of Canada to address the issue of genocide and other mass atrocity crimes, which published its report, &quot;The Responsibility to Protect&quot;, in December 2001.

The co-chairs then wrote an article on this matter: a state&#x27;s sovereignty is also under question in times of mass murder, in terms of legitimacy. Sovereignty is dependent upon the state&#x27;s responsibility to its people; if not fulfilled, then the contract between the government and its citizen is void, thus the sovereignty is not legitimate. In that crucible lies the genesis of the Responsibility to protect (R2P) doctrine.

The core idea of the R2P doctrine, as endorsed by the United Nations General Assembly at the 2005 World Summit, is that every state has the responsibility to protect its population from genocide and other mass atrocity crimes; the international community has a responsibility to assist the state if it is unable to protect its population on its own; and that if the state fails to protect its citizens from mass atrocities and peaceful measures have failed, the international community has the responsibility to intervene with appropriate measures, with coercive military intervention, approved by the UN Security Council, available as a last resort. The concept was expressly designed to supersede the idea of &quot;humanitarian intervention&quot;, which had failed to generate any international consensus about how to respond to the 1990s catastrophes of Rwanda, Bosnia and Kosovo.

Evans has been widely acknowledged as playing a crucial role in initiating, and advocating the international acceptance of, the concept, first as co-chair of the International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty which introduced the expression in its 2001 report of that name, and subsequently as a member of the UN Secretary-General&#x27;s High Level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change, Co-chair of the advisory board of the Global Centre on the Responsibility to Protect, and as the author of the Brookings Institution-published &quot;The Responsibility to Protect: Ending Mass Atrocity Crimes Once and For All&quot; and many other published works. He has made innumerable speeches and presentations on the issue, including in July 2009 participating at the UNGA in an interactive dialogue with Noam Chomsky.

===Other international panels and commissions===
He was a member of the UN Secretary General&#x27;s High Level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change, whose report &quot;A More Secure World: Our Shared Responsibility&quot;, addressing mass atrocity crimes and many other UN reform issues, was published in December 2004.

Evans also served on the UN Secretary-General&#x27;s Advisory Committee on Genocide Prevention.

Evans had previously served as a member of the Carnegie Commission on Preventing Deadly Conflict (1994–97), co-chaired by Cyrus Vance and David Hamburg. He was also a member of the International Task Force on Global Public Goods, sponsored by Sweden and France and chaired by Ernesto Zedillo, which reported in September 2006.

He is a member of the Crimes Against Humanity Initiative Advisory Council, a project of the Whitney R. Harris World Law Institute at Washington University School of Law in St. Louis to establish the world&#x27;s first treaty on the prevention and punishment of crimes against humanity.

===Nuclear issues===
On nuclear issues, he was a member of the Commission on Weapons of Mass Destruction sponsored by Sweden and chaired by Hans Blix which reported in June 2006; and the Commission of Eminent Persons on The Role of the IAEA to 2020 and Beyond, chaired by Ernesto Zedillo, whose report &quot;Reinforcing the Global Nuclear Order for Peace and Prosperity&quot; was launched in June 2008. From 2008 to 2010 he co-chaired (with former Japanese Foreign Minister Yoriko Kawaguchi) the Australia and Japan sponsored International Commission on Nuclear Non-proliferation and Disarmament: its report &quot;Eliminating Nuclear Threats: A Practical Agenda for Global Policymakers&quot; was published in December 2009.

===Academic career and published writing===
Before entering Australian politics Evans was a lecturer, then senior lecturer, in law at the University of Melbourne, teaching constitutional and civil liberties law, crime and torts, from 1971 to 1976. In 2009, after his retirement from politics and his subsequent career as head of the International Crisis Group, he returned to academic life as an honorary professorial fellow (later professorial fellow) in the School of Social and Political Sciences at the University of Melbourne, teaching a graduate course on international policymaking in practice in 2011 and 2012.

He was elected as chancellor of the Australian National University from 1 January 2010, replacing Kim Beazley following Beazley&#x27;s appointment as Australian Ambassador to the United States. Evans was installed by Governor-General Quentin Bryce at a ceremony in Canberra on 18 February 2010.

He is also an Honorary Fellow of Magdalen College, Oxford; a Distinguished Fellow of the Australia India Institute; Chair of the International Advisory Board of the Centre for Nuclear Non-Proliferation and Disarmament; and Member of the Advisory Boards of the ANU Crawford School of Public Policy, Asia-Pacific College of Diplomacy and Centre for Arab and Islamic Studies, and the Cambridge Review of International Affairs.

Evans has written or edited 13 books, most recently &quot;Incorrigible Optimist: A Political Memoir&quot; (Melbourne University Press, 2017). His other major works include &quot;The Responsibility to Protect: Ending Mass Atrocity Crimes Once and for All&quot; (Brookings Institution Press, September 2008, paperback edition 2009), which was awarded an Honorable Mention in the US Council on Foreign Relations Arthur Ross Book Award 2009 as one of the best three books on international relations published in the previous year, as well as &quot;Australia&#x27;s Foreign Relations&quot; (with Bruce Grant, Melbourne University Press 1991, 2nd ed 1995), &quot;Cooperating for Peace: The Global Agenda for the 1990s&quot; (Allen &amp; Unwin, 1993), &quot;Australia&#x27;s Constitution&quot; (with John McMillan and Haddon Storey, Allen &amp; Unwin, 1983) and the edited collection, &quot;Labor and the Constitution&quot;, 1972–1975 (Heinemann, 1977). He co-edited the annual &quot;Labor Essays&quot; series from 1980 to 1982.

Evans has also published nearly 150 chapters in books, monographs and articles in refereed and other journals – and many more newspaper and magazine articles – on foreign relations, politics, human rights and legal reform.

==Contributions to international relations thinking==
===Good international citizenship===

Evans introduced the idea of &quot;good international citizenship&quot; in his first major speeches as Australian foreign minister, and repeated and refined it in subsequent writing. The core notion was that &quot;being, and being seen to be, a good international citizen&quot; should be seen not as the &quot;foreign policy equivalent of boy-scout good deeds&quot;, but as a distinct component of any country&#x27;s national interest, &quot;quite distinct from the familiar duo of security and economic interests&quot;:

The interest in question here is more than just the pleasure of basking in approbation. There are many direct reciprocal benefits to be gained in a world where no country can solve all its own problems: my assistance for you today in solving your drugs and terrorism problem might reasonably lead you to be more willing to help solve my environmental problem tomorrow. But the reputational benefit does also count. The perception of being a country willing to take principled stands for other than immediately self-interested reasons does no harm at all – as the Scandinavians in particular seem to have well understood – when it comes to advancing one&#x27;s own commercial or political agendas.

The concept of &quot;good international citizenship&quot; has been specifically attributed to Evans in academic writing; its &quot;idealistic pragmatism&quot; has been seen as a way of bridging or transcending rival doctrines of realism and idealism in international relations theory; and the idea has been advanced as mapping a possible &quot;third way for British foreign policy&quot;.

===Niche diplomacy===

&quot;Niche diplomacy&quot; was identified by Evans as one of the characteristic methods of the larger and more familiar concept of middle power diplomacy which has traditionally characterized the approach to international relations of Canada (especially during the Pearson years) and Australia (especially under the Labor governments of Hawke, Keating and Rudd). He defined it as &quot;concentrating resources in specific areas best able to generate returns worth having, rather than trying to cover the field. By definition, middle powers are not powerful enough in most circumstances to impose their will, but they may be persuasive enough to have likeminded others see their point of view, and to act accordingly&quot;. The concept is now familiar in academic discourse, and has been specifically attributed to Evans.

===Cooperative security===

Evans won the 1995 Grawemeyer Award for Ideas Improving World Order (following Mikhail Gorbachev the year before) for his fall 1994 &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; article, &quot;Cooperative Security and Intra-State Conflict&quot;, which was cited as presenting ideas that, following the end of the Cold War &quot;could quicken the process ... to help maintain a new world order&quot;. He described &quot;cooperative security&quot; as being a single conceptual theme that effectively captured the essence of three more familiar concepts in international security discourse, viz. comprehensive security, common security and collective security. Its defining – and attractive – characteristics were that &quot;the term tends to connote consultation rather than confrontation, reassurance rather than deterrence, transparency rather than secrecy, prevention rather than correction, and interdependence rather than unilateralism&quot;.

==Honours and awards==
On 11 June 2012, Evans was named a Companion of the Order of Australia for &quot;eminent service to international relations, particularly in the Asia Pacific Region as an adviser to governments on a range of global policy matters, to conflict prevention and resolution, and to arms control and disarmament.&quot; He had previously been made an Officer of the Order of Australia (AO) in 2001 for &quot;service to the Australian Parliament, particularly through advancing Australia&#x27;s foreign policy and trade interests, especially in Asia and through the United Nations&quot;, and has been awarded Honorary Doctorates of Laws by the University of Melbourne in 2002, Carleton University in 2005, the University of Sydney in 2008 and Queen&#x27;s University Ontario in 2010. In October 2005 he and the International Crisis Group were named European and Asian &quot;Heroes of 2005&quot;. In July 2008, he was selected as an inaugural fellow of the Australian Institute of International Affairs in recognition of his &quot;outstanding contribution to Australian international relations&quot;. In May 2010 he was awarded the 2010 Roosevelt Institute Four Freedoms Award for Freedom from Fear for his pioneering work on the responsibility to protect concept and his contributions to conflict prevention and resolution, arms control and disarmament. In October 2011, he was presented by the Nuclear Threat Initiative, led by Sam Nunn and Ted Turner, the Amartya Sen Award &quot;for intrepid and creative leadership in creating momentum toward a world free of nuclear weapons&quot;. In December 2011 &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; magazine cited him, along with Francis Deng, as one of the Top 100 Global Thinkers for 2011 &quot;for making &#x27;the responsibility to protect&#x27; more than academic&quot;.

Earlier in his career he was designated Australian Humanist of the Year in 1990 by the Council of Australian Humanist Societies, won the ANZAC Peace Prize in 1994 for his &quot;leadership role in the Cambodian Peace Process&quot;, was awarded in 1995 the prestigious University of Louisville $150 000 Grawemeyer Prize for Ideas Improving World Order for his 1994 &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; article &quot;Cooperative Security and Intrastate Conflict&quot;, and in 1999 received the Chilean Order of Merit (Grand Officer) for his work in initiating APEC.

In April 2007, Evans gave a lecture entitled &quot;Preventing Mass Atrocities: Making &#x27;Never Again&#x27; a Reality&quot; at the University of San Diego&#x27;s Joan B. Kroc Institute for Peace &amp; Justice Distinguished Lecture Series.

In 2012 Evans was elected an honorary fellow of the Academy of the Social Sciences in Australia.

==Personal life==

Evans has been married since 1969 to Professor Merran Evans, of Monash University, with whom he has two adult children. They have four grandchildren.

In 2002, Evans admitted to having an extramarital relationship with Cheryl Kernot.

He has been a lifelong supporter, and was during his time in Australian government a special patron, of the Hawthorn Football Club. His other stated leisure interests are reading and writing, travel, architecture, opera and golf.

<text>Karen Louise Rolton (born 21 November 1974) is an Australian former cricketer and captain of the national women&#x27;s team. A left-handed batter, she has scored the most runs for her country in women&#x27;s Test cricket.

==International cricket==
After making her international debut in 1995, Rolton went on to become a member of two successful world championship campaigns. In the final of the 2005 Women&#x27;s Cricket World Cup, she scored 107 not out and was adjudged Player of the Match. Her numerous individual honours include being named ICC Women&#x27;s Cricketer of the Year in 2006 and winning the Belinda Clark Award four times. New Zealand coach Steve Jenkin once remarked that the best tactic against her was to avoid dismissing the Australian team&#x27;s openers so she could not bat.

In 2006, Rolton became the captain of the national team, taking over from Belinda Clark. She led Australia in the 2009 Women&#x27;s Cricket World Cup on home soil, although the team performed below expectations and finished in fourth place.

===Records and statistics===
Across 14 Test matches, Rolton scored 1,002 runs at an average of 55.66 which included two centuries and five half-centuries. She made her top score of 209 not out against England at Headingley in 2001, a world record at the time. She also scored 4,814 runs at 48.14 in Women&#x27;s One Day Internationals. Rolton became the first player to score a century in the knockout stage of a Women&#x27;s Cricket World Cup and set a record for the highest individual score on debut in Women&#x27;s Twenty20 Internationals with 96 not out. In addition to her batting prowess, she enjoyed success as a left-arm medium-pace bowler, taking 102 international wickets across all three formats.

== International centuries ==


==Retirement and post-career==
In January 2010, Rolton announced her retirement from international cricket after a 14-year career. She continued to play domestic cricket for South Australia until the end of the 2010–11 Women&#x27;s National Cricket League season.

In 2016, Rolton was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame. In January 2018, she was inducted into the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame. A few months later, the South Australian Cricket Association unveiled a new community sporting facility in Adelaide, announcing the name of the main ground as Karen Rolton Oval.

Rolton currently lives in Victoria and remains involved with cricket through her coaching roles at the Melbourne Renegades and also at local level.

<doc id="761554" wikidata="Q223272" url="?curid=761554" title="Online dispute resolution">
<text>Online dispute resolution (ODR) is a form of dispute resolution which uses technology to facilitate the resolution of disputes between parties. It primarily involves negotiation, mediation or arbitration, or a combination of all three. In this respect it is often seen as being the online equivalent of alternative dispute resolution (ADR). However, ODR can also augment these traditional means of resolving disputes by applying innovative techniques and online technologies to the process.

ODR is a wide field, which may be applied to a range of disputes; from interpersonal disputes including consumer to consumer disputes (C2C) or marital separation; to court disputes and interstate conflicts. It is believed that efficient mechanisms to resolve online disputes will impact in the development of e-commerce. While the application of ODR is not limited to disputes arising out of business to consumer (B2C) online transactions, it seems to be particularly apt for these disputes, since it is logical to use the same medium (the internet) for the resolution of e-commerce disputes when parties are frequently located far from one another. Designing an appropriate ODR system requires attention to the interests of both consumers and companies as well as a deep understanding of the requirements of procedural justice.

== Definition ==
Dispute resolution techniques range from methods where parties have full control of the procedure, to methods where a third party is in control of both the process and the outcome. These primary methods of resolving disputes may be complemented with Information and Communication Technology (ICT). When the process is conducted mainly online it is referred to as ODR, i.e. to carry out most of the dispute resolution procedure online, including the initial filing, the neutral appointment, evidentiary processes, oral hearings if needed, online discussions, and even the rendering of binding settlements. Thus, ODR is a different medium to resolve disputes, from beginning to end, respecting due process principles.

ODR was born from the synergy between ADR and ICT, as a method for resolving disputes that were arising online, and for which traditional means of dispute resolution were inefficient or unavailable. The introduction of ICT in dispute resolution is currently growing to the extent that the difference between off-line dispute resolution and ODR is blurry. It has been observed that it is only possible to distinguish between proceedings that rely heavily on online technology and proceedings that do not. Some commentators have defined ODR exclusively as the use of ADR assisted principally with ICT tools. Although part of the doctrine incorporates a broader approach including online litigation and other sui generis forms of dispute resolution when they are assisted largely by ICT tools designed ad hoc. The latter definition seems more appropriate since it incorporates all methods used to resolve disputes that are conducted mainly through the use of ICT. Moreover, this concept is more consistent with the fact that ODR was born from the distinction with off-line dispute resolution processes.

In ODR, the information management is not only carried out by physical persons but also by computers and software. The assistance of ICT has been named by Katsh and Rifkin as the &#x27;fourth party&#x27; because ODR is seen as an independent input to the management of the dispute. In addition to the two (or more) disputants and the third neutral party, the labelling of technology as the fourth party is a clear metaphor which stresses how technology can be as powerful as to change the traditional three side model. The fourth party embodies a range of capabilities in the same manner that the third party does. While the fourth party may at times take the place of the third party, i.e. automated negotiation, it will frequently be used by the third party as a tool for assisting the process.

The fourth party may do many things such as organize information, send automatic responses, shape writing communications in a more polite and constructive manner e.g. blocking foul language. In addition, it can monitor performance, schedule meetings, clarify interests and priorities, and so on. The assistance of the fourth party will increase the more technology advances, thus reducing the role of the third neutral party. It has been predicted that virtual &quot;fourth party&quot; avatars will be created to judge disputes and could become more skilled and intelligent over time. Katsh and Wing argue that ICT advance is occurring exponentially since ICT advance speeds up over the time. As a result, ODR processes are increasing in efficiency providing their disputants with greater advantages in terms of time saving and cost reductions.

=== Alternative definitions ===
In practice it is difficult to provide a self-contained definition of ODR, and given the pace of change it may not even be possible to do so. The use of technology usually involves the use of Internet-based communications technology at some stage, but ODR does not necessarily involve purely online processes – further, many could be replicated offline using pen and paper, or could be achieved using computers without Internet connections.

The range of terms and s used to describe the field augments the confusion often felt by those unfamiliar with the new field of ODR. These terms include:

*Internet Dispute Resolution (iDR)
*Electronic Dispute Resolution (eDR)
*Electronic ADR (eADR)
*Online ADR (oADR)
*Technology Assisted Dispute Resolution (tADR)

ODR has emerged as the most used term in recent years.

It is uncertain whether these processes form a new &quot;discipline&quot; of ADR or a &quot;tool&quot; to aid existing methods of dispute resolution. The most appropriate view would be to view ODR as an field of dispute resolution.

== Methods ==

=== Consensual ===

====Automated negotiation====

Automated negotiation relates to those methods in which the technology takes over (aspects of) a negotiation. Most of the ODR services in this area are so-called &#x27;blind-bidding&#x27; services. This is a negotiation process designed to determine economic settlements for claims in which liability is not challenged. The blind bidding service may be thought of as a type of auction mechanism where some or all information about the players&#x27; bids is hidden. 

A resolution is declared by the system at the end of a negotiating session if all parties have accepted one or more packages (of one or more proposed decision values) at the end of that session. Which of those packages becomes the agreement may be determined by an algorithm that rewards the party that moves soonest into the Zone of Agreement. This algorithm is thought to encourage concessions and quickly indicate that they are willing to accept a fair outcome. This is in contrast to the chilling effect that occurs with the more common split-the-difference algorithm.

Automated negotiation has proven to be particularly successful with insurance compensations and commercial activities. It is also a valuable tool for lawyers because they too can use it without revealing what they&#x27;re willing to accept (unless an agreement is reached) and more importantly, without waiving their right to access the court, in the case that the negotiation is unsuccessful.

Thus, ODR is useful for resolving brick and mortar disputes that arise in businesses, insurance companies and municipalities, who are finding that ODR saves them money and time when dealing with B2C disputes.

====Assisted negotiation====

In assisted negotiation the technology assists the negotiation process between the parties. The technology has a similar role as the mediator in a mediation. The role of the technology may be to provide a certain process and/or to provide the parties with specific (evaluative) advice.

Mediators use information management skills encouraging parties to reach an amicable agreement by enabling them to communicate more effectively through the rephrasing of their arguments. Conciliation is similar to mediation, but the conciliator can propose solutions for the parties to consider before an agreement is reached. Also, assisted negotiation procedures are designed to improve parties&#x27; communications through the assistance of a third party or software. In fact, it has been argued that assisted negotiation, conciliation, and even facilitation, are just different words for mediation. The major advantages of these processes, when used online, are their informality, simplicity and user friendliness.

* &quot;SquareTrade&quot;

The leading ODR provider for consumer mediation was until recently SquareTrade. It was contracted by a number of market places, the largest of which was eBay. However, due to changes in the eBay feedback system in May 2008, SquareTrade decided to stop resolving eBay feedback disputes from June 2008. SquareTrade continues providing services to eBay users, such as warranty services and the trustmark program. It appears that in the last year these services have been taken over by eBay and PayPal dispute resolution services, but results on these services are still scarce.

SquareTrade did not handle disputes between users and eBay, only between sellers and buyers on eBay. SquareTrade offered two levels of dispute resolution: assisted negotiation and mediation. SquareTrade was only used after eBay&#x27;s own consumer satisfaction process. In the last few years, SquareTrade has resolved millions of disputes across 120 countries in 5 different languages.

The advantage of dealing with large number of disputes is that the same issues arise many times, thus it is possible to divide the disputes into different sections. The SquareTrade process started when a buyer or a seller filed a complaint. To do so, the claimant was asked to fill out a web-based standard claim form that identified the type of dispute and presented a list of common solutions, from which the claimant selected the ones that he agreed to. The other party was contacted by email where he was informed about the SquareTrade process, and asked whether he wished to participate. The parties were often keen on participating because this was the only manner by which the buyer could get redress and the seller positive feedback. The other party filed the response, selecting the resolutions. If both parties agreed on the same resolution, the dispute was resolved. When an agreement could not be reached, parties were put into a negotiation environment. A web interface was used to shape communications into a constructive and polite negotiation. This was achieved with software tools that limited the free text space, encouraged the proposition of agreements, set deadlines and even shaped the tone of exchanges.

This software was the key element of the process because it took over some of the expertise of the third party. This process could be defined as &#x27;mediated negotiation&#x27;. According to Rabinovich-Einy, SquareTrade technology,

&quot;intervenes in the negotiations between the parties and, by allowing parties to formulate and reformulate the problem and the solution, performs some of what would be associated with a mediator&#x27;s role, moving the parties from a problem mode to a solution stance.&quot;

Most disputes (over 80 percent) were resolved during the first two stages, which was an impressive success rate given that in the majority of cases, the parties had already been involved in some type of failed direct negotiation before engaging with SquareTrade. In the rest of the cases a mediator could be requested for a nominal fee, acting as an expert evaluator or conciliator that made settlement proposals to the parties. This second stage involved the payment of a US$29.95 fee. According to SquareTrade, &quot;[a] sophisticated case management technology enables mediators to handle lower to medium-value consumer disputes in an efficient cost effective manner.&quot; The appointed mediator proposed solutions, if required by the parties to do so. Agreements were always kept confidential by SquareTrade, and became binding as contracts.

SquareTrade has proven that processes such as online negotiation and online mediation can be efficient tools to resolve e-commerce disputes. One of the key issues for the success of SquareTrade was the simplicity and convenience of this service. In addition, SquareTrade services to eBay were concentrated on a reduced number of issues, such as delays, bad descriptions and negative feedback. This made possible the development of an efficient automatic process that enhanced online negotiation. The success of consensual and automated processes depends on the nature of the dispute, the accuracy of information provided, and the capability of the software or the third neutral party in assessing and evaluating the facts and evidence. SquareTrade was particularly effective because it introduced incentives that encourage parties&#x27; participation; i.e. both parties wished to resolve their dispute: sellers want to obtain positive feedback and buyers want redress. In general terms, widening the scope of clients&#x27; claims to the global market invites extra variables to play: cultural differences, such as high and low culture perceptions and the cross-cultural variations of what constitutes the customer satisfaction experience.

====Expedient Non-Adjudicative Online Resolution====

Another form of alternative dispute resolution prioritizes expedience and dispenses with adjudication all together, in recognition of the litigants&#x27; desire to simply dispose of the matter as quickly as possible. By removing any hint of adjudication, services (e.g., One Day Decisions) &quot;fast track&quot; a version similar to blind bidding which is restricted privately to the two parties and an algorithm determines a fair value to be accepted by each party. Unlike other services, once accepted by both parties, the settlement amount is applied to the issuance of a Certificate of Final Resolution which both parties accept as irrevocable proof of resolution and final settlement. By avoiding adjudication, expedient non-adjudicative online resolution saves litigants time in court, time away from work and other fees and expenses, while protecting each from ancillary damage: The winning party generally collects more of his disputed amount and the losing party suffers no credit damage from having a judgment entered against him. Expedient Non-Adjudicative Online Resolution is generally utilized in cases that might otherwise be heard in small claims or limited civil matters.

====Crowdjustice====
As an alternative to private, professional settlement, the concept of crowdjustice has recently taken shape as a means to leverage social norms and the wisdom of crowds to determine the outcome of a dispute. 

=== Adjudicative ===

====Online arbitration====

Arbitration is a process where a neutral third party (arbitrator) delivers a decision which is final, and binding on both parties. It can be defined as a quasi-judicial procedure because the award replaces a judicial decision. Arbitrators can be current or former trial judges, but that is not a requirement. However, in an arbitration procedure parties usually can choose the arbitrator and the basis on which the arbitrator makes the decision. Furthermore, it is less formal than litigation, though more than any other consensual process. It is often used to resolve businesses&#x27; disputes because this procedure is noted for being private and faster than litigation. Once the procedure is initiated parties cannot abandon it, unless they both agree to discontinuing it (e.g. when they reached a settlement - although usually the settlement will be communicated to the arbitral tribunal and an award rendered on this basis). Another feature of arbitration is that the award is enforceable almost everywhere due to the wide adoption of the 1958 New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards. Moreover, arbitral awards prove frequently easier to enforce than court decisions from overseas.

The majority of legal studies on online arbitration agree that, neither law, nor arbitral principles, prevent arbitration from taking place online. However, there may be several aspects in online arbitration that need to be regulated. Although online arbitration seems admissible under the New York Convention and the E-Commerce Directive, this is arguably an assumption by most commentators, rather than a legal statement. Since arbitration is based on a contractual agreement between the parties, an online process without a regulatory framework may generate a significant number of challenges from consumers and other weaker parties if due process cannot be assured. Currently, most arbitration providers allow parties to carry out online only part of the arbitration process, e.g. parties may download claim forms, the submission of documents through standard email or secure web interface, the use of telephone hearings, etc. A key element of arbitration is the right for a party to question the witnesses of the other parties and that can now be done at low cost with an online audio and video hearing process using newer technologies such as Skype Premium or Google Hangouts. Cross examination of remote witnesses regulated by the arbitrator can ensure the fairness and maintain a judicial quality for the online arbitration process.

The main challenge for online arbitration is that if judicial enforcement is required then it partly defeats the purpose of having an online process. Alternatively, some processes have developed self-enforcement mechanisms such as technical enforcements, black lists and trustmarks.

====The Uniform Domain Names Dispute Resolution Policy (UDRP)====

Traditionally arbitration resolves disputes by delivering a decision that will be legally binding, i.e. enforceable by the courts in the same manner as a judgment. Non binding arbitration processes may also be effective when using ODR tools because they often encourage settlements by imparting a dose of reality and objectivity. In addition, self-enforcement measures may reinforce the efficacy of non binding processes. The most significant example is the Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy (UDRP) created by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). Some commentators have referred to the UDRP as an administrative process. In any case, the UDRP has developed a transparent global ODR process that allows trade mark owners to fight efficiently cybersquatting. The UDRP is used to resolve disputes between trade mark owners and those who have registered a domain name in bad faith for the purpose of reselling it for a profit, or taking advantage of the reputation of a trademark.

Trademark owners accessing the UDRP must prove to the panel three circumstances: 
#similarity of the domain name to the trade or service mark;
#lack of rights or legitimate interest in the registered domain name;
#bad faith in the registration and use of the domain name.

However, the UDRP presents its own problems that show the challenges that an online adversarial system applied to mainstream e-commerce disputes would have. The main worry is that the evaluation of the panel decisions often shows a lack of unanimous consensus in the interpretation of the UDRP. This may be due to a number of reasons, such as the lack of an appellative review and panels composed by members from a multitude of jurisdictions and informed by different legal traditions.

On the other side, it is undeniable what ICANN with the UDRP has achieved in developing an effective ODR procedure based on contractual adherence that allows trade mark owners to transfer or cancel a domain that blatantly violates IP rights. The UDRP providers have dealt efficiently with over 30,000 domain name disputes. Their success derives from two aspects: First, the UDRP deals only with blatant disputes, which are abusive registrations made in bad faith in order to take advantage of the reputation of existing trademarks. Secondly, it has incorporated a self-enforcement mechanism, which transfers and cancels domain names without the need for judicial involvement. This is a positive accomplishment for the development of e-commerce because it favours consumers&#x27; confidence in the Internet by reducing the number of fraudulent registered domain names.

====Chargebacks====

One of the main focuses of e-commerce up until recently has been related to secure payments. Chargebacks is a remedy used to reverse transactions made with credit or debit cards when a fraudulent use has occurred, or when there is a violation of the contract terms. This method is very popular among online consumers since this is the main mechanism to transfer money online. In addition, consumers are not required to give evidence to cancel a payment. The vendor has the burden of proving that the merchandise or service was given according to the contract terms. Once this is proved the bank makes effective the payment to the vendor.

Chargebacks are largely used around the world by banks and the main credit card suppliers i.e. Visa, MasterCard and American Express. Yet, the coverage of debit and credit cards varies considerably amongst different countries. Commonly, debit cardholders have fewer protections than credit card holders, but it also varies depending on the jurisdiction.

It is then not surprising why credit cards are the major source of payments for consumers in e-commerce. They provide a remedy that reverses all transactions when a fraudulent use has occurred, or when there is a violation of the contract terms. However this method has limitations; it offers one single remedy (the return of the payment), and not all disputes imply a breach of contract or fraud.

Similarly, online payment providers, like PayPal.com, retain temporarily the money paid by a buyer when the latter makes a complaint within 45 days after the payment was made. PayPal.com holds the money until the dispute is settled, but only in those cases where the merchandise did not arrive, or the description of the product was significantly different from the product itself. In these circumstances PayPal.com acts akin to an online arbitrator. However, in those circumstances where the seller takes away the money from his account before the buyer makes the claim, PayPal.com will not be responsible for the buyer&#x27;s loss. Despite this, PayPal is in a very strong position since in most cases it is able to freeze the amount of money and resolve the dispute providing an instant and effective enforcement.

Overall, chargebacks intends to balance the inequality of power between consumers and businesses. It is regarded as a very efficient tool for consumers because the speed, accessibility and lack of charge for their clients, who would just have to notify their banks or card issuers to cancel a transaction. Thus, Edwards and Wilson suggested that it would be advisable to focus on developing chargebacks and other soft ODR methods because they are very effective amongst mainstream consumers. By contrast, the existing processes are considered largely inefficient and not transparent among businesses because puts businesses in bad light since the onus of the proof rests on them.

== In the Courts ==

Many courts throughout the world are now incorporating ODR into their judicial procedures. The idea is to add a &quot;virtual door&quot; to the multi-door courthouse and promote access to justice.

== In the European Union ==
===European Small Claims Procedure ===
Small claims procedures provide a middle ground between formal litigation and ADR, where disputes involving small value claims can be resolved in courts faster, cheaply, and less formally. The main limitation of small claims procedures is that they are restricted to particular jurisdictions. In order to overcome this limitation the European Commission has adopted a regulation for a European Small Claims Procedure (ESCP) in 2007. Implementation of the ESCP was expected in all EU Member States by January 2009. The ESCP is predominantly a written procedure that deals with claims under €2,000 arising in cross-border disputes. Its main advantage is that it provides for the enforcement of decisions in any of the member states without the need to go through the formal mutual recognition of judgements (exequatur).

Great expectations are put on the ESCP, which in order to deliver a cost-effective process will have to rely on ICT. This will be a significant challenge, because unlike the UDRP, which is becoming a fully online process for dealing with specific complaints, the ESCP will deal with a variety of civil and commercial disputes. The objective of the ESCP was the creation of a cost efficient procedure applicable to small value claims in cross-border disputes. This objective could only be achieved by using a written procedure, assisted by electronic forms such as emails and videoconferencing as foreseen by the ESCP.

The Regulation allows the use of new technologies in transferring information and evidence between the courts of the different member states. But, it will be the EC Member States who will decide, through their own regulations, which specific means of communication are acceptable in their courts. Given that the ESCP is a regulation and not a directive, it is arguable whether it has left too many aspects to the discretion of member states, which could call into question the legal certainty expected from a European regulation. Nevertheless, it can be expected that, in due time, electronic communications will reach every possible and reasonable aspect of the judicial procedure to assist in the resolution of online as well as off-line B2C disputes.

With the implementation of the ESCP an institutionalized ODR may emerge in Europe in 2009. Many disputes will be resolved by judges communicating with parties through the Internet. It is expected that the ESCP will contribute to mitigate the legitimacy problem which also hampers the emergence of ODR. Perhaps, within the EU, where we have concern for the fairness of private procedures (i.e. restrictions in consumer arbitration) the ESCP may contribute to increase trust in ODR processes.

===ODR Platform===
The European Commission established an Online Dispute Resolution Platform (ODR Platform) on 15 February 2016. This platform or portal is available for use by consumers located in the European Union, or in Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein, to assist in settling disputes with traders out of court. The platform is accessible at https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/main/index.cfm. In addition, the Platform may be used by traders to resolve a dispute with a consumer who resides in Belgium, Germany, Luxemburg or Poland.

== In China ==
China&#x27;s 2018 E-Commerce Law establishes the principle that &quot;the state regulates the platforms, and the platforms regulate online businesses&quot;. Among other provisions, the law states in Articles 58-63 that platforms should establish online dispute resolution systems among other online institutions.

== In India ==
Online dispute resolution (ODR) in India is in its infancy stage and it is gaining prominence day by day. With the enactment of &quot;Information Technology Act, 2000&quot; in India, e-commerce and e-governance have been given a formal and legal recognition in India. Even the traditional arbitration law of India has been reformulated and now India has &quot;Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996&quot; in place that is satisfying the harmonised standards of UNCITRAL Model. The amendment made in the&quot;Code of Civil Procedure, 1908&quot; by introducing section 89 was made to provide methods of alternative dispute resolution (ADR) in India.

With a rapid growth of e-commerce in India, the number of disputes related to online transactions is on the rise. The existing dispute redressal mechanisms are falling short of the business growth and customer expectations. Conventional redressal systems require presence of the parties, and are not in synch with modern online platforms. The Department of Consumer Affairs, Government of India has taken note of this and has planned to roll out an Online Consumer Dispute Resolution platform that follows the best practices emerging in the global eCommerce arena.

<text>Charles Louis Mee Jr. (born September 15, 1938) is an American playwright, historian and author known for his collage-like style of playwriting, which makes use of radical reconstructions of found texts. He is also a Special Lecturer of theater at Columbia University.

==Early life and career==
Charles L. Mee was born in Evanston, Illinois, the son of Charles Louis Mee Sr. and his wife Sarah Elizabeth (Lowe) Mee. He grew up in Barrington, Illinois, after the family moved there from Evanston. Mee contracted polio at the age of fourteen. His memoir &quot;A Nearly Normal Life&quot; (1999) tells how that event informed the rest of his life.

After graduating from Harvard University in 1960, Mee moved to Greenwich Village and became a part of the Off-Off-Broadway scene. Between 1962 and 1964, his plays were presented at venues that included La MaMa E.T.C., Caffe Cino, Theatre Genesis, and the Ontological-Hysteric Theater.

In 1961 Mee began work at American Heritage publishing company and eventually became the editor of the hardback bi-monthly &quot;Horizon: A Magazine of the Arts&quot;. He was also the Advising Editor and then Contributing Editor of &quot;Tulane Drama Review&quot; – now called &quot;TDR&quot; and published from New York University – until 1964 and its Associate Editor from 1964 to 1965.

==Literary career==
To support himself and his family, Mee turned from writing plays to writing books in 1965. &quot;Lorenzo De&#x27;Medici and the Renaissance&quot;, the first of his many nonfiction books, was published in 1969 by HarperCollins Juvenile Books. At the same time, he increasingly became caught up in anti-Vietnam War politics, campaigning for anti-war congressional candidates and writing anti-war polemics. He did not return to writing for the theater for 20 years.

In the 1970s, he became the co-founder and chairman of The National Committee on the Presidency, a grassroots organization which called for the impeachment of Richard Nixon. His political activism led to his writing of political histories for the general public.

His &quot;Meeting at Potsdam&quot; (1975), about the 1945 Potsdam Conference, was chosen as a main selection of the Literary Guild, and was adapted for both film and television by David Susskind. He wrote other books on summit diplomacy, international power sharing, and American history, including &quot;The End of Order: Versailles 1919&quot; (1980); &quot;The Marshall Plan: The Launching of Pax Americana&quot; (1987), and &quot;The Genius of the People&quot; (1987), about the 1787 Constitutional Convention. &quot;Playing God: Seven Fateful Moments When Great Men Met to Change the World&quot; (1993) was Mee&#x27;s final published work of history.

&quot;A Visit to Haldeman and Other States of Mind&quot; (1976) was described as &quot;part autobiographical meditation, part elegiac crank letter to the American Republic, part confession and part essay on democratic politics&quot; in a review by &quot;Time&quot;. Greil Marcus, in 2002, said that it was one of the best books he had read about American patriotism. In 2017, Dwight Garner in his &quot;New York Times&quot; &quot;American Beauties&quot; column, about &quot;undersung American books of the past 75 years,&quot; described the work as &quot;[o]ne of the finest and least-known books about Richard M. Nixon&#x27;s presidency and the shrinking American soul&quot;.

==Playwriting career==

Mee returned to playwriting in 1985. His libretto for choreographer Martha Clarke&#x27;s &quot;Vienna: Lusthaus&quot; was his first produced script since his Off-Off Broadway days. In 2002 Mee revised about a third of his &quot;Vienna: Lusthaus&quot; script. It was reprised as &quot;Vienna: Lusthaus (Revisited)&quot;. Clarke and Mee collaborated again in &quot;Belle Époque&quot; (2004). For years he continued working his day job as the editor-in-chief at consumer health publisher Rebus, Inc. and writing books.

Mee&#x27;s daughter, Erin B. Mee, also became involved in theater. In 1988 she was invited to direct a production at HOME for Contemporary Theatre and Art in SoHo. She chose to premiere her father&#x27;s play, &quot;The Imperialists at the Club Cave Canem&quot; (1988), which received positive reviews from &quot;The Village Voice&quot; and &quot;The New York Times&quot;. The play was picked up by Joseph Papp for a run at The Public Theater. In 2000 Erin B. Mee staged another production of &quot;The Imperialists at the Club Cave Canem&quot; at The Market Theatre in Cambridge, Massachusetts, which she updated with the dramaturg for this production.

&quot;Another Person is a Foreign Country&quot; (1991) was the first of Mee&#x27;s many collaborations with the director Anne Bogart. The En Garde Arts site-specific performance took place in the courtyard of the decrepit Towers Nursing Home in New York City.

In 1992 his &quot;Orestes&quot; was directed by Robert Woodruff at the University of California, San Diego and by Anne Bogart at the Saratoga International Theatre Institute (SITI). In the summer of 1992, Tina Landau directed an En Garde Arts production as &quot;Orestes 2.0&quot; on an abandoned pier on the Hudson River in Manhattan.

This play was the first of ten plays for which Mee used the Greek texts as a base and added new fragments of text; he then would &quot;throw the scaffolding away and call whatever remained the script.&quot; In 1996, his &quot;The Constitutional Convention: A Sequel,&quot; was produced by Clubbed Thumb.

In 2001 Erin B. Mee staged the premiere of her father&#x27;s &quot;First Love&quot; at New York Theatre Workshop. He had written it specifically for her to direct, and it starred Ruth Maleczech and Fred Neumann of Mabou Mines. Erin Mee staged a second production in 2002 at the Magic Theatre in San Francisco with Joan Mankin and Robert Parnell.

In other plays, Mee explores twentieth-century American history and culture through the points-of-view of contemporary visual artists in: &quot;bobrauschenbergamerica&quot; (Robert Rauschenberg), &quot;Hotel Cassiopeia&quot; (Joseph Cornell), &quot;soot and spit (the musical)&quot; (James Castle), and &quot;Under Construction&quot; (Jason Rhoades and Norman Rockwell).

His comedies and romances include &quot;Summertime&quot;, &quot;First Love&quot;, &quot;True Love&quot;, &quot;Big Love&quot;, &quot;Wintertime&quot;, &quot;Fetes de la Nuit&quot;, &quot;A Perfect Wedding&quot;, and &quot;Fire Island&quot;. As source material, Mee would use Greek tragedy, Shakespeare, Molière, Anton Chekhov, René Magritte paintings, Bollywood musicals, and his own writing.

He is the only resident playwright of the theatre ensemble SITI Company, for whom he wrote &quot;Orestes&quot;, &quot;bobrauschenbergamerica&quot;, &quot;Hotel Cassiopeia&quot;, &quot;Under Construction&quot;, and &quot;soot and spit (the musical)&quot;. Mee was the Signature Theatre Playwright-in-Residence for the 2007–2008 season.

In 2008, Shakespeare and Renaissance scholar Stephen Greenblatt collaborated with Mee to write &quot;Cardenio&quot;. It premiered at American Repertory Theater (A.R.T.) in 2008.

In 2014 Mee co-wrote This Is Not A Theatre Company&#x27;s &quot;Pool Play&quot;. Audiences sat at the edge of the pool with their feet in the water for an exploration of America&#x27;s long, joyful, and complicated relationship with the swimming pool. The production included synchronized swimming, an existential boatman, musical numbers, and a snarky fish, along with stories about segregated pools, and a meditation on pollution.

Sarah Lucie of &quot;Show Business Weekly&quot; said: 
The entirety of the play is well executed, featuring a strong ensemble that has absolutely no fear of diving into whatever quirky material is presented to them. Their playfulness is contagious, ultimately creating an uplifting theatrical experience that leaves the audience joyous and refreshed—and maybe a little wet. Pool Play, while undeniably light-hearted, manages to communicate some profound and political themes to those who choose to pay attention.

&quot;Theatre is Easy&quot; wrote: 
Pool Play ... is definitely worth the trip ... The entire ensemble showed moments of skill, wit, and brevity far beyond their years. Erin B. Mee does a superb job directing this young group of artists to create a cohesive look at our fascination with the water, entertaining and engaging the audience along the way.

In fall 2015 Mee co-wrote &quot;Versailles 2015&quot;, a site-specific play for a New York City apartment, conceived and directed by Erin B. Mee. &quot;New York Theatre Review&quot; noted that &quot;Versailles 2015 is over far too quickly. It is an hors d&#x27;oeuvre plate of scenes that collectively ... have a message about elitism and the vanity of apathy ... Brief and poignant, Versailles 2015 will linger in your mind long after you see it.&quot; Courtney Escoyne of &quot;Thoughts from a Ballet Nerd&quot; wrote: &quot;Versailles 2015 is a meditation upon privilege…It blurred the lines between audience and performer, ignored entirely the idea of a fourth wall, and managed to fit in some wonderfully crafted dialogue.&quot; Finally, Stephen Kaplan of &quot;Theatre Is Easy&quot; said: &quot;Delightful and provocative ... Amidst the countless atrocities that confront us every day, at our core we are all struggling to find the naked honesty in our own lives ... Versailles 2015 allows us the time to contemplate this in its characters and in ourselves.&quot;

Mee&#x27;s play &quot;The Glory of The World&quot; (2015), about Thomas Merton, a noted Trappist monk and activist, was directed by Les Waters. It opened at The Actor&#x27;s Theatre of Louisville in the spring of that year. It transferred to the Brooklyn Academy of Music in February 2016.

Mee teaches playwriting at the Columbia University School of the Arts.

==Style and method of writing==

On Mee&#x27;s website, &quot;the (re)making project&quot;, he says &quot;There is no such thing as an original play.&quot; and that his plays are &quot;composed in the way that Max Ernst made his Fatagaga pieces toward the end of World War I: texts have often been taken from, or inspired by, other texts.&quot; An interview with Mee about his work by Erin B. Mee, along with a manifesto and other material, was published in TDR 46:3 (T175).
==Use of the Internet==

Mee began using the internet as a textual source for composing his pieces in the early 1990s. He first began making his own work freely available by posting three of his plays on Carnegie Mellon&#x27;s humanities gopher/ftp/telnet English Server in the mid-1990s. By 1996, with the help of his friend Tom Damrauer, &quot;the (re)making project&quot;, a web site with his full scripts was launched. It contained an invitation for people to &quot;do freely whatever they want with them.&quot; He is the first and only playwright to make such a large body of theatre work available on the internet.

This was not viewed by Mee as a challenge to the current copyright law or a vehicle to raise issues of intellectual property. It was done as a populist gesture towards his utopian vision of a free and democratic internet. In 1996 he said &quot;I&#x27;m attracted to the idea of things being owned in common.&quot; It also represented &quot;Mee&#x27;s Golden Rule: of do unto my writing as I have done unto the writing of others.&quot;

National Public Radio called Mee the &quot;Public-Domain Playwright&quot; in 2000 and credited him with touching &quot;a raw cultural nerve&quot; by making his work freely available.

Writer Jonathan Lethem credited Mee as one of the inspirations for his &quot;Promiscuous Project&quot; in which he made a selection of his stories available for filmmakers or dramatists to adapt at a dollar apiece.

In an explanation about &quot;the (re)making project&quot; on his current website, Mee says that his plays are protected by copyright if they are &quot;essentially or substantially performed&quot; as he has composed them. He continues, however, to invite others to freely pillage his texts to make their own work, without any attribution to him.

==Patronage==

In 1998, Mee&#x27;s friend, former chairman of Morgan Stanley and philanthropist Richard B. Fisher and his wife, Jeanne Donovan Fisher, offered to provide Mee with enough money to support himself. The rare arrangement imposed no stipulations or conditions upon Mee or his writing nor did it specify how long the relationship would last. Although Richard B. Fisher died in 2004, Jeanne Donovan Fisher continues to support Mee and his work. The Fishers patronage has been hailed as one &quot;without parallel or precedent in American theatrical philanthropy.&quot;

Sometime in 2013, concurrent with the launch of a redesigned website, the language regarding patronage changed to the past tense: &quot;Charles Mee&#x27;s work has been made possible by the support of Richard B. Fisher and Jeanne Donovan Fisher.&quot; It is now possible to directly support the project.

==Awards==
Among other awards, Charles Mee is the recipient of a lifetime achievement award in drama from the American Academy of Arts and Letters, two Obie Awards, for &quot;Vienna: Lusthaus&quot; (1986) and &quot;Big Love&quot; (2002), PEN/Laura Pels Theater Award for a playwright in mid-career, and the Fisher Award given by the Brooklyn Academy of Music.

<text>The South American foxes (Lycalopex), commonly called &quot;raposa&quot; in Portuguese, or &quot;zorro&quot; in Spanish, are a genus from South America of the subfamily Caninae. Despite their name, they are not true foxes, but are a unique canid genus more closely related to wolves and jackals than to true foxes; some of them resemble foxes due to convergent evolution. The South American gray fox, &quot;Lycalopex griseus&quot;, is the most common species, and is known for its large ears and a highly marketable, russet-fringed pelt.

The second-oldest known fossils belonging to the genus were discovered in Chile, and date from 2.0 to 2.5 million years ago, in the mid- to late Pliocene. The Vorohué Formation of Argentina has provided older fossils, dating to the Uquian to Ensenadan (Late Pliocene).

== Names ==
The common English word &quot;zorro&quot; is a loan word from Spanish, with the word originally meaning &quot;fox&quot;. Current usage lists &quot;Pseudalopex&quot; (literally: &quot;false fox&quot;) as synonymous with &quot;Lycalopex&quot; (&quot;wolf fox&quot;), with the latter taking precedence. In 1895, Allen classified &quot;Pseudalopex&quot; as a subgenus of &quot;Canis&quot;, establishing the combination &quot;Canis (Pseudalopex)&quot;, a name still used in the fossil record.

== Species ==
Species currently included in this genus include:

In 1914, Oldfield Thomas established the genus &quot;Dusicyon&quot;, in which he included these zorros. They were later reclassified to &quot;Lycalopex&quot; (via &quot;Pseudalopex&quot;) by Langguth in 1975.

== Phylogeny ==
The following phylogenetic tree shows the evolutionary relationships between the &quot;Lycalopex&quot; species, based on molecular analysis of mitochondrial DNA control region sequences.
== Relationship with humans ==
The zorros are hunted in Argentina for their durable, soft pelts. They are also often labelled &#x27;lamb-killers&#x27;.
In his diary of his well-known 1952 traveling with the young Che Guevara, Alberto Granado mentions talking with seasonal workers employed on vast sheep farms, who told him of a successful campaign by the ranch owners to exterminate the foxes who were preying on lambs. The ranchers offered a reward of one Argentinian peso for the body of a dead male fox and as much as five pesos for a female fox; to impoverished workers in the early 1950s, five pesos were a significant sum. Within a few years, foxes became virtually extinct in a large part of Argentina.

The &quot;Fuegian dog&quot; (), also known as the Yaghan dog, was a domesticated form of the culpeo (&quot;Lycalopex culpaeus&quot;), unlike other domesticated canids which were dogs and silver foxes. This means different canid species have been domesticated multiple times by humans independently.

<doc id="761557" wikidata="Q1780127" url="?curid=761557" title="Alfredo Ovando">
<text>Alfredo Ovando Candia (6 April 1918 – 24 January 1982) was a Bolivian military officer and political leader who served as the 48th president of Bolivia from 1965 to 1966 and 1969 to 1970. During his first term, he shared power with René Barrientos as co-president of a military junta.

== Early years ==
Ovando was born in Cobija from an upper-middle-class family of immigrants parents from Extremadura, Spain and Piedmont, Italy. He started his long military career in the early 1930s, when he served in the Chaco War against Paraguay. Originally rather apolitical, he was chosen (among others) to lead the reconstituted Armed Forces of Bolivia in the aftermath of the 1952 Revolution that installed in power the reformist Revolutionary Nationalist Movement party, better known as the MNR. Ovando lived through the relative deprivation, reduced budgets, and loss of prestige of the defeated Bolivian army during the early years of MNR rule. By the early 1960s, President Víctor Paz Estenssoro came to rely more heavily on the military in the face of growing political divisions among the governing elites. Equally as important in this rebirth was the considerable pressure exerted by the United States to modernize and equip the troops for a decidedly more political role: that of fighting possible Cuba-styled Communist insurgencies.

== The 1964 coup d&#x27;état and the co-presidency ==

When Paz Estenssoro amended the Constitution in 1964 in order to allow himself to run for re-election (a largely frowned-upon move in the largely personalistic world of Bolivian politics), General Ovando, along with the vice-president and former head of the Air Force René Barrientos, toppled Paz from power. They ruled together in a Junta (sometimes called &quot;The Co-Presidency) until January 1966, when Barrientos resigned in order to register himself as a candidate. At that point Ovando became sole President, leading the country to the elections from which the popular Barrientos emerged victorious. With the new president having taken the oath of office in August 1966, Ovando returned to his post as Commander of the Bolivian Air Forces.

== Armed forces commander and president-in-waiting, 1966-69 ==
Uncharismatic but tenacious, Ovando was biding his time, counting on the fact that he would be the logical choice to run for elections once Barrientos&#x27; term ended in 1970, perhaps with some electoral &quot;help&quot; from the outgoing administration. Soon, major differences emerged between Ovando and the president, however, especially in regard to the massacre of miners at Siglo XX in June 1967, and the so-called Arguedas Affair of 1968. In early 1967, a guerrilla force had been discovered to be operating in the rural Bolivian southwest under the leadership of the Argentine-Cuban revolutionary Ernesto &quot;Che&quot; Guevara. While the popular insurgency was eventually crushed by the US-trained Bolivian military troops under American CIA command, Guevara was captured and executed in October 1967. This event fostered a major spin-off scandal that surfaced in 1968. That year, Barrientos&#x27; trusted friend and Minister of Interior, Antonio Arguedas, disappeared with the captured diary of Che Guevara, which soon surfaced in Havana. From abroad, Arguedas confessed himself to have been all along a clandestine Marxist supporter, and denounced Barrientos and many of his aides as being on the CIA&#x27;s payroll. This event embarrassed US military School of the Americas (SOA) graduate Barrientos as a US-controlled puppet, and prompted Ovando to distance himself from the president with an eye to the projected 1970 elections. (The US SOA notoriously trained many Latin American dictators and death squads in counterinsurgency tactics and torture and disappearance techniques). 

The worries proved unnecessary, for Barrientos perished in a tragic helicopter crash on 27 April 1969. His vice-president, a little-known Christian-Democrat politician named Luis Adolfo Siles, was sworn as president soon thereafter, in accordance to the Constitution. Siles&#x27; poor relations with Ovando led Siles to support the candidacy of the popular Mayor of La Paz, Armando Escobar, as the true successor of the now-constantly eulogized Barrientos, threatening to spoil the carefully laid plans of Ovando. Furthermore, Ovando had been undergoing a political metamorphosis, and had come to conclude that he had to move to the Left in order to be acceptable as president in the ideologically super-charged atmosphere of the late 1960s. The changes he planned to institute could be difficult to enact in the presence of a potentially hostile Congress. For these reasons, Ovando decided not to wait for the elections (which no one could guarantee he could win, with the popular Escobar as candidate) and on 26 September 1969, he executed a coup d&#x27;état that overthrew Siles.

== The 1969-70 Ovando dictatorship ==
Ovando&#x27;s short (13 month) dictatorship was difficult and marked by political violence. Upon taking office, he declared himself in favor of fundamental changes aimed at enhancing the deplorable living conditions of the vast majority of Bolivians. To this end, he nationalized the Bolivian operations of the U.S.-based Gulf Oil Corporation and called on known leftist intellectuals to become part of his cabinet. Ovando also announced his political adherence to the principles espoused by other so-called &quot;leftist military&quot; regimes then in vogue in Latin America, foremost of which were the regimes of Peru&#x27;s Juan Velasco and Panama&#x27;s Omar Torrijos.

Ovando&#x27;s populist stance surprised many conservative members of the Bolivian military and failed to fully satisfy the increasingly more belligerent forces of the Left, especially the workers and students. Worse, the military (in whose name he served) had become polarized, with some sectors supporting the President and even calling for a further leftward turn (General Juan José Torres) and others criticizing Ovando and urging a more conservative, anti-Communist, and pro U.S. stance (General Rogelio Miranda). In June 1970, a new Marxist guerrilla movement emerged in the lowlands near La Paz, this time constituted mostly by Bolivian university students aligned with the outlawed Ejército de Liberación Nacional (National Liberation Army, or ELN). The new guerrilla outbreak was easily controlled, but Ovando&#x27;s response had been rather vacillating and timid. He offered a generous safe haven to guerrillas who gave up the fight, for example, in contrast to Barrientos&#x27; call for &quot;heads on spikes&quot; in 1967. The forces of the right had had enough.

==The October 1970 coup and retirement==
On 6 October 1970, an anti-government coup d&#x27;état took place via a junta of commanders of the Bolivian Military. However, the polarized forces of the military were evenly split. Much blood was shed on the streets of various major cities, with garrisons fighting each other on behalf of one camp or the other. Eventually, President Ovando sought asylum in a foreign embassy, believing all hope was lost. But the leftist military forces re-asserted themselves under the combative leadership of General Juan José Torres, and eventually triumphed. Embarrassed by his quick abandonment of the fight, and worn out by 13 grueling months in office, Ovando agreed to leave the presidency in the hands of his friend, General Torres. The latter was sworn in and rewarded Ovando with the Bolivian ambassadorship to Spain. Ovando remained in Madrid until 1978, when he returned to Bolivia. In his latter years, he supported the progressive UDP alliance of former President Hernán Siles, but otherwise never participated in active politics again. He died in La Paz on 4 January 1982, at the age of 63. His wife died in 2014.

<text>Darton railway station is a railway station in a large village of Darton, in the Metropolitan Borough of Barnsley, South Yorkshire, England. Train services are provided by Northern Trains.

The station was opened by the Manchester and Leeds Railway on 1 January 1850.

The railway station is in South Yorkshire but West Yorkshire Metro tickets are also valid to and from this station. The reason for this is that the West-South Yorkshire boundary historically ran between the village and its main source of employment, Woolley Colliery.

The car park at the station was recently reported by the local police force as having the highest incidence of vehicle break-ins in the Barnsley area, but the installation of CCTV is hoped to address this problem.

==Facilities==
The station is unstaffed and no longer has any permanent buildings aside from standard waiting shelters on each side (the old buildings were demolished after the station lost its staffing in 1970). Timetable posters and digital display screens provide train running information and there is step-free access to both platforms.

==Services==

There is an hourly service to via and northbound and to via Barnsley southbound (though the last northbound train each day terminates at Wakefield Kirkgate). The service is two-hourly in each direction on Sundays.

<doc id="761567" wikidata="Q4965109" url="?curid=761567" title="Brian Redhead">
<text>Brian Leonard Redhead (28 December 1929 – 23 January 1994) was a British author, journalist and broadcaster. He was a co-presenter of the &quot;Today&quot; programme on BBC Radio 4 from 1975 until 1993, shortly before his death. He was a great lover and promoter of the city of Manchester and the North West in general, where he lived for most of his career.

==Education and early life==
Redhead was born in Newcastle upon Tyne. He was the only child of Ernest Leonard Redhead, a silk screen printer and advertising agent, and his wife, Janet Crossley (née Fairley). He was educated at the Royal Grammar School, Newcastle. After national service, he read history at the University of Cambridge as an undergraduate student of Downing College, Cambridge.

==Career==
Redhead&#x27;s career in journalism started in 1954 as a journalist for the &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot; newspaper. He married Jean Salmon (known as Jenni) on 19 June 1954. They had four children: two sons, Stephen and James, and twins, Annabel (known as Abby) and William.

He became northern editor of &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 1965, and editor of the &quot;Manchester Evening News&quot; in 1969. After being passed over for the editorship of &quot;The Guardian&quot; in favour of Peter Preston in 1975, he left to join the &quot;Today&quot; programme on BBC Radio 4, replacing Robert Robinson. He was already an experienced broadcaster, having been &#x27;discovered&#x27; around 1960 by a BBC Manchester producer, Olive Shapley, who was looking for a presenter of a television programme called &quot;Something to Read&quot;:I held auditions over two days and there were some promising people. However, on the second day a young man turned up who was clearly highly intelligent and knowledgable[sic], oozed confidence, communicated effortlessly through the camera, was very funny and never stopped talking. I knew instantly that this was the one.Later, Redhead presented &quot;Points North&quot; on television, and chaired the Saturday night Radio 4 topical conversation programme &quot;A Word in Edgeways&quot; for many years.

In the 1970s Redhead appeared twice on BBC Two&#x27;s music panel quiz &quot;Face the Music&quot;: on 10 June 1974 and on 24 September 1975.

He formed a partnership with fellow &quot;Today&quot; presenter John Timpson which lasted for over 10 years. Redhead and Timpson had a series of running jokes on the programme, including the mythical organisations &quot;The Friends of the M6&quot; (long-suffering motorists trapped in its frequent traffic jams) and &quot;The League of Pear-Shaped Men&quot; (of which he and Timpson were the principal members). 

His sense of humour often appeared in asides in the &quot;Today&quot; programme. Talking of a convoy moving at 3 mph, Redhead observed that was probably 3 mph faster than they were moving on the M25 motorway that morning. When working the same slot as John Humphrys, he gleefully reported that Humphrys had turned up for work on his day off (probably before 6.00am) and was livid. On another occasion, he reported that the weather would be &quot;brighter in the north than the south, like the people&quot;. Sue MacGregor and Peter Hobday were also co-presenters, and the team was celebrated in 1987. 

During his time on the &quot;Today&quot; programme, Redhead was accused of political bias by Conservative Chancellor Nigel Lawson, and in reply enquired &quot;Do you think we should have a one-minute silence now in this interview, one for you to apologise for daring to suggest that you know how I vote and secondly perhaps in memory of monetarism which you have now discarded?&quot; He later had a similar set-to with Trade and Industry Secretary Peter Lilley.

The feeling was that Redhead was to the left of his co-presenter John Timpson. Many years later Libby Purves, who also presented &quot;Today&quot; at the time, characterised them as classic opposites – Redhead the self-made Northerner, with social democratic leanings and aspirations to better himself, Timpson the gentle (and, perhaps, gently declining in terms of social prestige) old-school conservative middle class Southerner. In her words, Timpson &quot;wanted it to be 1950&quot;, while Redhead &quot;was more than ready for the New Britain of the 21st century, although he died before seeing its birth&quot;. However, Redhead claimed to be more of a Tory wet, not a socialist, and stated that he had cast a personal vote for Macclesfield&#x27;s Conservative MP, Nicholas Winterton.

The death of Redhead&#x27;s youngest son, William, in a car crash in France in 1982, aged 18, led him to rediscover religious faith, and he became a confirmed member of the Church of England a few months later. In the Radio 4 series &quot;The Good Book&quot;, he charted the history of the Bible. 

In the last years of his life, there was some speculation that after his retirement from &quot;Today&quot; he would train for ordination as an Anglican priest. He was also a strong supporter of the hospice movement, ambiguously calling it &quot;the best thing that has happened in this country since the Second World War&quot;. He served as Chancellor of the University of Manchester.

During the First Gulf War in 1991, he was a volunteer presenter on the BBC Radio 4 News FM service.

==Personal life==
Redhead married Jean (Jenni) Salmon in 1954 and had four children.

In 1993, his health started to fail and he was in pain on his left side and leg. He was thought to need hip surgery, but in fact had a ruptured appendix which was leaking toxins, causing liver and kidney failure and other problems. He took leave from &quot;Today&quot; in early December, expecting to return after Christmas, but died in January 1994.
