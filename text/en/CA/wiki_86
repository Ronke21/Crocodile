<text>Dianne Elizabeth Reeves (born October 23, 1956) is an American jazz singer, who has won five Grammy Awards for her albums.

== Early life and education ==
Dianne Reeves was born in Detroit, Michigan, into a musical family. Her father sang, her mother played trumpet, her uncle is bassist Charles Burrell, and her cousin is George Duke. Her father died when she was two years old, and she was raised in Denver, Colorado, by her mother, Vada Swanson, and maternal family. Reeves was raised Catholic and attended Cure D&#x27;Ars Catholic School in Denver for much of her early schooling.

== Career ==
In 1971, she started singing and playing piano. She was a member of her high-school band, and while performing at a convention in Chicago was noticed by trumpeter Clark Terry, who invited her to sing with him. &quot;He had these amazing all-star bands, but I had no idea who they all were! The thing I loved about it was the way they interacted with each other – the kind of intimate exchange that I wasn&#x27;t part of. For a young singer, it was fertile soil.&quot; She studied classical voice at the University of Colorado.

Reeves moved to Los Angeles, where she sang and recorded with Stanley Turrentine, Lenny White, and Billy Childs. She recorded with the band Caldera, then founded the band Night Flight with Billy Childs, with whom she would collaborate again in the 1990s. She moved to New York City and from 1983 to 1986 toured with Harry Belafonte.

She signed with Blue Note in 1987 and that year her eponymous album, featuring Herbie Hancock, Freddie Hubbard, and Tony Williams, was nominated for a Grammy Award. She went on to win five Grammy Awards.

Music critic Scott Yanow has said of her: &quot;A logical successor to Dinah Washington and Carmen McRae, Reeves is a superior interpreter of lyrics and a skilled scat singer.&quot; Her sound has been compared to that of Patti Austin, Vanessa Rubin, Anita Baker, and Regina Belle.

Reeves performed at the closing ceremony of the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City. In 2005, she appeared in the film &quot;Good Night, and Good Luck&quot; singing 1950s standards (including &quot;How High the Moon&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ve Got My Eyes on You&quot;, &quot;Too Close for Comfort&quot;, &quot;Straighten Up and Fly Right&quot; and &quot;One for My Baby&quot;). In 2006, the soundtrack won the Grammy Award for Best Jazz Vocal Album. 

Reeves appeared in the 2021 documentary film &quot;JazzTown&quot;.

<text>The middle latitudes, also called the mid-latitudes (sometimes spelled midlatitudes) or moderate latitudes, are spatial regions on either hemisphere of Earth, located between the Tropic of Cancer (latitude ) and the Arctic Circle () in the northern hemisphere and between the Tropic of Capricorn (-) and the Antarctic Circle (-) in the southern hemisphere. They include Earth&#x27;s subtropical and temperate zones, which lie between the two tropics and the polar circles. Weather fronts and extratropical cyclones are usually found in this area, as well as occasional tropical cyclones or subtropical cyclones, which have traveled from their areas of formation closer to the Equator.

The prevailing winds in the middle latitudes are often very strong. These parts of the world also see a wide variety of fast-changing weather as cold air masses from the poles and warm air masses from the tropics constantly push up and down over them against each other, sometimes alternating within hours of each other, especially in the roaring forties (latitudes between 40° and 50° in both hemispheres), even though the winds on the northern hemisphere are not as strong as in the southern hemisphere, due to the large landmasses of North America, Europe and Asia.

There are six types of mid-latitude climates consisting of: mediterranean, desert, humid subtropical, oceanic, humid continental and subarctic.

<text>Ofagbe (&quot;Ofa kugbe&quot;) is a town about southeast of Ozoro, the headquarters of the Isoko North Local Government Area of Delta State, Nigeria. Legend has it that the town was established by three families who migrated from various points in the then Benin Kingdom to settle and call the town &quot;home.&quot;

Bordered to the west by Ibrede, to the east by the Ase River, and to the south by Ovrede, the town has an estimated population of approximately 10,000.

On entering the town from the south, Oketa Grammar School sits in a parcel of land across the road. Ofagbe is home to Ofagbe Technical College (Ofatech), one of the premier technical schools in the then Midwestern State, and also home to the proposed Premiumreal University.

<doc id="786372" wikidata="Q265400" url="?curid=786372" title="2000 NBA draft">
<text>The [[2000–01 NBA season|2000]] [[NBA draft]] was held on June 28, 2000, at the Target Center in Minneapolis. It was the last draft held at the home arena of an NBA team until 2011; the following and subsequent drafts (through 2010) all took place at The Theater at Madison Square Garden in New York City (though Madison Square Garden itself is the home of the New York Knicks, they do not play in the theater). As of 2024, it is also the last NBA draft where a college senior was the number-one overall selection.

The 2000 draft class is considered the worst in NBA history. Few of its draftees would enjoy extended careers in the league. Just three of them—top pick Kenyon Martin, first-round selection Jamaal Magloire (19th overall) and second-round pick Michael Redd (43rd overall) -- ever played in an NBA All-Star Game. Each of the three made their one and only All-Star appearance in 2004. The three cumulative All-Star appearances marks the lowest cumulative appearances since the 1952 NBA Draft. Redd was the lone player from this draft to ever be chosen for an All-NBA Team (his sole appearance was on the third team in 2004). Only three players in this draft class won a major end-of-season award in their careers: Hedo Türkoğlu was named Most Improved Player in 2008, Mike Miller won the NBA Rookie of the Year and NBA Sixth Man of the Year awards in 2001 and 2006 respectively, and Jamal Crawford was awarded the NBA Sixth Man of the Year three times in 2010, 2014 and 2016.

&quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; named this entire draft class (as opposed to individual players) the sixth biggest bust of the modern era – making it the only draft class among the site&#x27;s top 20 list. Just before the 2009 draft, &quot;ESPN.com&quot; columnist David Schoenfield graded all of the drafts since the institution of the draft lottery in 1985, and the only draft to which he gave the lowest possible grade of &#x27;F&#x27; was the 2000 draft. Using the WARP (wins above replacement player) metric, the 2000 NBA draft class collectively produced at a rate of 17.3 wins worse than a group of &quot;average replacement players&quot;, effectively making this draft class the only one in NBA history to leave the league&#x27;s talent pool worse than it had been before.

Eight of the players selected in this draft never played in an NBA game in their professional basketball careers. Both of the players drafted by the San Antonio Spurs (Chris Carrawell and Cory Hightower) are among this group.

==Draft selections==



==Notable undrafted players==

These players were not selected in the 2000 NBA draft but have played at least one game in the NBA.
==Early entrants==
===College underclassmen===
Following last year&#x27;s slight dip of underclassmen, entering the new millennium, this draft saw a total of 55 underclassmen declare for the NBA draft initially. However, for collegiate players, seven of the nineteen total players that ultimately withdrew their names would be collegiate players (with Joshua Cross from Southern Illinois University, Jason Kapono from UCLA, Brian Merriweather from the University of Texas Pan-American, Jeryl Sasser from Southern Methodist University, Kenny Satterfield from the University of Cincinnati, Karim Shabazz from Providence College, and Joe White from Texas A&amp;M University being the collegiate players that withdrew their names). Overall, including the high schools and international players with the 26 college underclassmen, there were 36 total players that would be considered underclassmen. That being said, the following college basketball players successfully applied for early draft entrance.
* Erick Barkley – G, St. John&#x27;s (sophomore)
* Ernest Brown – C/F, Indian Hills CC (sophomore)
* Schea Cotton – G, Alabama (sophomore)

<text>Indian Coast Guard (ICG) is a maritime law enforcement and search and rescue agency of India with jurisdiction over its territorial waters including its contiguous zone and exclusive economic zone. It was started on 1 February 1977 and formally established on 18 August 1978 by the &quot;Coast Guard Act, 1978&quot; of the Parliament of India. It operates under the Ministry of Defence.

The ICG works in close cooperation with the Indian Navy, the Department of Fisheries, the Department of Revenue (Customs), and the Coastal Police of the State Police Forces, and the Central Armed Police Forces.

==History==
The establishment of the Indian Coast Guard was first proposed by the Indian Navy to provide non-military maritime services to the nation. In the 1960s, sea-borne smuggling of goods was threatening India&#x27;s domestic economy. The Indian Customs Department frequently called upon the Indian Navy for assistance with patrol and interception in the anti-smuggling effort.

The Nagchaudhuri Committee was constituted with participation from the Indian Navy and the Indian Air Force to study the problem. In August 1971, the committee identified the requirement to patrol India&#x27;s vast coastline, set up a registry of offshore fishing vessels to identify illegal activity, and establish a capable and well-equipped force to intercept vessels engaged in illegal activities. The committee also looked at the number and nature of the equipment, infrastructure and personnel required to provide those services.

By 1973, India had started a programme to acquire the equipment and started deputing personnel from the Indian Navy for these anti-smuggling and law enforcement tasks, under the provisions of the Maintenance of Internal Security Act. The Indian Navy sensed that the law enforcement nature of these duties diverged from its core mission as a military service. Admiral Sourendra Nath Kohli, then Chief of Naval Staff, hence made a recommendation to the Defence Secretary outlining the need for a separate maritime service to undertake those duties and offering the Navy&#x27;s assistance in its establishment. On 31 August 1974, the Defence Secretary submitted a note to the Cabinet Secretary proposing cabinet action on Admiral Kohli&#x27;s recommendation.

As a result, in September 1974, the Indian cabinet set up the &quot;Rustamji Committee&quot;, under the chairmanship of Khusro Faramurz Rustamji, with participation from the Navy, the Air Force and the Department of Revenue to examine gaps in security and law enforcement between the roles of the Indian Navy and the central and state police forces. The discovery of oil off Bombay High further emphasised the need for a maritime law enforcement and protection service. The committee submitted its recommendation for the establishment of the Indian Coast Guard under the Ministry of Defence on 31 July 1975. Bureaucratic wrangling followed, with the Cabinet Secretary making a recommendation to place the service under the Ministry of Home Affairs. Then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi overruled the Cabinet Secretary and decided to accept the original recommendation of the Rustamji Committee to place the service under the Ministry of Defence.

An interim Indian Coast Guard came into being on 1 February 1977, equipped with two small corvettes and five patrol boats transferred from the Navy. The duties and functions of the service were formally defined in the &quot;Coast Guard Act&quot;, which was passed by India&#x27;s parliament on 18 August 1978 and came into immediate effect.

Vice Admiral V. A. Kamath of the Indian Navy was appointed the founding Director-General. Prime Minister Morarji Desai inspected the Guard of Honour at the service&#x27;s inauguration. Vice Admiral Kamath proposed a five-year plan to develop the ICG into a potent force by 1984, but the full potential of this plan was not immediately realised due to an economic resource crunch.

One of the historic operational successes of the ICG occurred in October 1999, with the recapture at high seas of a Panamanian-registered Japanese cargo ship, &quot;MV Alondra Rainbow&quot;, hijacked off Indonesia. Her crew were rescued off Phuket, Thailand. The ship had been repainted as MV &quot;Mega Rama&quot;, and was spotted off Kochi, heading towards Pakistan. She was chased by &quot;ICGS Tarabai&quot; and of the Indian Navy and apprehended. It was the first successful prosecution of armed pirates in over a century.
The Indian Coast Guard conducts exercises with the other coast guards of the world. In May 2005, the ICG agreed to establish liaison links with the Pakistan Maritime Security Agency (PMSA). In 2006, the Indian Coast Guard conducted exercises with its Japanese and Korean counterparts.

After the 2008 Mumbai attacks in which the terrorists entered India from Pakistan via the sea-route, the Indian government initiated a program to expand the ICG force, assets and infrastructure for enhanced protection and surveillance of Indian waters.

The force aims to have 200 ships and 100 twin-engined aircraft by 2030 in its fleet. Currently, ICG deploys 55 to 60 ships and 10 to 12 aircraft daily.

==Present scenario ==

===Current role===

The Indian Coast Guard&#x27;s motto is &quot;वयम रक्षामः&quot; (&quot;Vayam Rakshamah&quot;), which translates from Sanskrit as &quot;We Protect&quot;.

Missions of Indian Coast Guard:
* Safety and protection of artificial islands, offshore terminals and other installations
* Protection and assistance to fishermen and mariners at sea
* Preservation and protection of marine ecology and environment including pollution control
* Assistance to the Department of Customs and other authorities in anti-smuggling operations
* Law enforcement in territorial as well as international waters
* Scientific data collection and support
* National defence during hostilities (under the operational control of the Indian Navy)

Additional responsibilities of the Indian Coast Guard:
* Offshore Security Coordination Committee (OSCC) – The Director-General of the Indian Coast Guard is the Chairman of OSCC constituted by the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas (MoPNG), of which the Flag Officer Defence Advisory Group is a member.
* National Maritime Search and Rescue Coordinating Authority (NMSARCA) – The Director-General of the Indian Coast Guard is the NMSARCA for executing / coordinating search and rescue (SAR) missions
* Lead Intelligence Agency (LIA) – For coastal and sea borders
* Coastal Security – The Director-General of the Indian Coast Guard is the commander of coastal command and is responsible for overall coordination between central and state agencies in all matters relating to coastal security

===Leadership and organisation===


The Indian Coast Guard organisation is headed by the Director-General (DG ICG) who is located at Coast Guard Headquarters (CGHQ), New Delhi. At CGHQ, he is assisted by the Additional Director General Coast Guard (ADGCG) of the rank of ADG, four Deputy Director-Generals of the rank of Inspector-General, and other senior officers heading various staff divisions. Director General Paramesh Sivamani is the 26th Director General of Indian Coast Guard.The rank of Director General is equivalent to a Vice Admiral of Indian Navy.

The Indian Coast Guard has the Western and Eastern Seaboard, both commanded by three-star officers designated Coast Guard Commander Western Seaboard and Coast Guard Commander Eastern Seaboard. The seaboards are in turn divided into four regions. A fifth region, Andaman &amp; Nicobar Region reports directly to the DGICG. Each region is headed by an officer of the rank of Inspector-General. Each of the regions is further divided into multiple districts, typically covering a coastal state or a union territory.

As of 2023, the Indian Coast Guard operates:
* 42 Coast Guard Stations
* 5 Coast Guard Air Stations
* 10 Coast Guard Air Enclaves

== Organisation ==
As of 2016, there are 42 Coast Guard stations which have been established along the coastline of the country.

Indian Coast Guard is responsible for the execution of Search and Rescue (SAR) operations in Indian Search and Rescue Region (ISRR). To serve this purpose, ICG operates 3 Maritime Rescue Coordination Centres (MRCC) in Mumbai, Chennai and Port Blair and 36 Maritime Rescue Sub Centres (MRSC/MRCSC), which operates under their respective MRCCs.

On 5 November 2024, the Indian Coast Guard and the Telecommunications Consultants India (TICL) laid foundation of a full-fledged &quot;Tier-3&quot; Data Centre at Mahipalpur, Delhi. The construction will take 2 years. The project worth (including 5-year operational expenditure (opex) and a 2-year hardware warranty) will be carried out by TCIL, Yotta Infrastructure and Attero, a software solution company. This will help ICG for Command and Control over their 109 offices and 88 ships at once.
==Personnel==
===Officer rank structure===
&quot;A table showing the rank structure of Coast Guard officers with those of the other Indian armed services.&quot;

===Coast Guard officers===

The naming of ranks of officers in the Coast Guard is as same as rank of Central Armed Police Forces. Officers are appointed in the Coast Guard in one of four branches, as either General-Duty officer, Pilot officer, Technical officer or Law officers. Lady Officers have two branches i.e. General-Duty Officer or Pilot Officer and serve on shore establishments/Air Stations/Headquarters. They are not deployed on board Indian Coast Guard ships.

Currently, officers of Indian Coast Guard undergo Basic Military Training at the Indian Naval Academy, Ezhimala along with their counterparts of Indian Navy. This helps in the mutual interchange of Officers among these two sister services. While the Indian Coast Guard Academy is under construction in Mangaluru, Dakshina Kannada district, Karnataka. 

;General-Duty Officers
The command of ships at sea can only be exercised by officers of the General-Duty (GD) branch. The key functions of a General-Duty Officer would be to operate weapons, sensors and different kinds of equipment on board a ship. The safety of the ship and the men would be GD officers responsibility. All the District Commanders (COMDIS) and Commander of Coast Guard Region (COMCG) appointments are exercised by a GD Officer of the Indian Coast Guard.

;Pilot Officers
Pilot Officers are also part of GD branch. A Pilot Officer gets an opportunity to work at shore Air Stations along the Indian coasts and also embark ships. ICG operates fixed wing aircraft for surveillance of the Exclusive Economic Zone. In addition, helicopters are embarked on Coast Guard Offshore Patrol Vessels (OPV) to provide local surveillance and perform search and rescue mission at sea.

;Technical Officers
Technical Officers are responsible for operation of advanced technology and sensor systems on board Coast Guard vessels and aircraft, as well as on shore installations. They also command the maintenance wings of the force.

;Law Officers
Law Officers act as legal advisers to their respective commanders. They represent the Indian Coast Guard in legal actions filed by or against the organisation. They also perform the duties of trial law officers in Coast Guard courts, convened to try delinquent Coast Guard personnel. The Directorate of Law at Coast Guard Headquarters is headed by a Deputy Inspector-General and is designated as the Chief Law Officer. Section 115 of the Coast Guard Act, 1978 deals with the qualifications necessary to be appointed as the Chief Law Officer of Indian Coast Guard. Section 116 of the Coast Guard Act, 1978 defines the functions of the Chief Law Officer.

=== Enrolled personnel ===
Enrolled personnel in the Coast Guard serve as either a &quot;yantrik&quot; (technician) or &quot;navik&quot; (sailor).
*&quot;Yantrik&quot;s are responsible for operating and maintaining mechanical, electrical or aeronautical equipment and systems on board the Coast Guard vessels and aircraft.
*&quot;Navik&quot;s may further serve in the General-Duty or Domestic branches. The General-Duty &quot;navik&quot;s serve as sailors, weapons systems operators, communication specialists, divers, etc. or in specific maritime or aviation support roles. Domestic branch &quot;navik&quot;s serve in roles such as stewards, cooks, etc. on board Coast Guard vessels.

Enrolled personnel of Indian Coast Guard are trained along with Indian Naval sailors at the naval training establishment INS Chilka. All training undertaken by Coast Guard personnel is the same as those undertaken by sailors in the Indian Navy. All personnel are trained in operation of weapons systems in cases of emergency.

<doc id="786408" wikidata="Q252126" url="?curid=786408" title="Louie Bellson">
<text>Louie Bellson (born Luigi Paolino Alfredo Francesco Antonio Balassoni, July 6, 1924 – February 14, 2009), often seen in sources as Louis Bellson, although he himself preferred the spelling Louie, was an American jazz drummer. He was a composer, arranger, bandleader, and jazz educator, and is credited with pioneering the use of two bass drums.

Bellson and his wife, actress and singer Pearl Bailey (married from 1952 until Bailey&#x27;s death in 1990), had the second highest number of appearances at the White House (only Bob Hope had more).

Bellson was a vice president at Remo, a drum company. He was inducted into the &quot;Modern Drummer&quot; Hall of Fame in 1985.

==Biography==

Bellson was born in Rock Falls, Illinois, in 1924, where his father owned a music store. He started playing drums at three years of age. While still a young child, Bellson&#x27;s father moved the family and music store to Moline, Illinois. At 15, he pioneered using two bass drums at the same time, a technique he invented in his high school art class. At age 17, he triumphed over 40,000 drummers to win the Slingerland National Gene Krupa contest.

After graduating from Moline High School in 1942, he worked with big bands throughout the 1940s, with Benny Goodman, Tommy Dorsey, Harry James, and Duke Ellington. In 1952, he married jazz singer Pearl Bailey. During the 1950s, he played with the Dorsey Brothers, Jazz at the Philharmonic, acted as Bailey&#x27;s music director, and recorded as a leader for Norgran Records and Verve Records.

Over the years, his sidemen included Ray Brown, Pete and Conte Candoli, Chuck Findley, John Heard, Roger Ingram, Don Menza, Blue Mitchell, Larry Novak, Nat Pierce, Frank Rosolino, Bobby Shew, Clark Terry, and Snooky Young.

In an interview in 2005 with &quot;Jazz Connection&quot; magazine, he cited as influences Jo Jones, Sid Catlett, and Chick Webb. &quot;I have to give just dues to two guys who really got me off on the drums – Big Sid Catlett and Jo Jones. They were my influences. All three of us realized what Jo Jones did and it influenced a lot of us. We all three looked to Jo as the &#x27;Papa&#x27; who really did it. Gene helped bring the drums to the foreground as a solo instrument. Buddy was a great natural player. But we also have to look back at Chick Webb&#x27;s contributions, too.&quot;

During the 1960s, he returned to Ellington&#x27;s orchestra for Emancipation Proclamation Centennial stage production, &quot;My People&quot; in and for A Concert of Sacred Music, which is sometimes called The First Sacred Concert. Ellington called these concerts &quot;the most important thing I have ever done.&quot;

Bellson&#x27;s album &quot;The Sacred Music of Louie Bellson and the Jazz Ballet&quot; appeared in 2006. In May 2009, Francine Bellson told &quot;The Jazz Joy and Roy&quot; syndicated radio show, &quot;I like to call (Sacred) &#x27;how the Master used two maestros,&#x27;&quot; adding, &quot;When (Ellington) did his sacred concert back in 1965 with Louie on drums, he told Louie that the sacred concerts were based on &#x27;in-the-beginning,&#x27; the first three words of the Bible.&quot; She recalled how Ellington explained to Louie that &quot;in the beginning there was lightning and thunder and that&#x27;s you!&quot; Ellington exclaimed, pointing out that Louie&#x27;s drums were the thunder. Both Ellington and Louie, says Mrs. Bellson, were deeply religious. &quot;Ellington told Louie, &#x27;You ought to do a sacred concert of your own&#x27; and so it was,&quot; said Bellson, adding, &quot;&#x27;The Sacred Music of Louie Bellson&#x27; combines symphony, big band and choir, while &#x27;The Jazz Ballet&#x27; is based on the vows of Holy Matrimony...&quot;

On December 5, 1971, he took part in a memorial concert at London&#x27;s Queen Elizabeth Hall for drummer Frank King. This tribute show also featured Buddy Rich and British drummer Kenny Clare. The orchestra was led by Irish trombonist Bobby Lamb and American trombonist Raymond Premru. A few years later, Rich (often called the world&#x27;s greatest drummer) paid Bellson a compliment by asking him to lead his band on tour while he (Rich) was temporarily disabled by a back injury. Bellson accepted.

On February 14, 2009, Bellson died at age 84 from complications of a broken hip suffered in December 2008 and Parkinson&#x27;s disease. He was remembered by &quot;The Mercury News&quot; as, &quot;the legendary San Jose drummer and band leader who played with jazz greats for more than six decades.&quot; He is buried next to his father in Riverside Cemetery, Moline, Illinois.

==Compositions and arrangements==

As a prolific creator of music, both written and improvised, his compositions and arrangements (in the hundreds) embrace jazz, jazz/rock/fusion, romantic orchestral suites, symphonic works and a ballet. Bellson was also a poet and a lyricist. His only Broadway venture, &quot;Portofino&quot; (1958), was a resounding flop that closed after three performances.

As an author, he published more than a dozen books on drums and percussion. He was at work with his biographer on a book chronicling his career and bearing the same name as one of his compositions, &quot;Skin Deep&quot;. In addition, &quot;The London Suite&quot; (recorded on his album &quot;Louie in London&quot;) was performed at the Hollywood Pilgrimage Bowl before a record-breaking audience. The three-part work includes a choral section in which a 12-voice choir sings lyrics penned by Bellson. Part One is the band&#x27;s rousing &quot;Carnaby Street&quot;, a collaboration with Jack Hayes.

In 1987, at the Percussive Arts Society convention in Washington, D.C., Bellson and Harold Farberman performed a major orchestral work titled &quot;Concerto for Jazz Drummer and Full Orchestra&quot;, the first piece ever written specifically for jazz drummer and full symphony orchestra. This work was recorded by the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra in England, and was released by the Swedish label BIS.

==Drum tutoring==
Bellson was known throughout his career to conduct drum and band clinics at high schools, colleges and music stores.

Bellson maintained a tight schedule of clinics and performances of both big bands and small bands in colleges, clubs and concert halls. In between, he continued to record and compose, resulting in more than 100 albums and more than 300 compositions. Bellson&#x27;s Telarc debut recording, &quot;Louie Bellson And His Big Band: Live From New York&quot;, was released in June 1994. He also created new drum technology for Remo, of which he was vice-president.

Bellson received an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters in 1985 at Northern Illinois University. As of 2005, among other performing activities, Bellson had visited his home town of Rock Falls, Illinois, every July for Louie Bellson Heritage Days, a weekend in his honor close to his July 6 birthday, with receptions, music clinics and other performances by Bellson. At the 2004 event celebrating his 80th birthday, Bellson said, &quot;I&#x27;m not that old; I&#x27;m 40 in this leg, and 40 in the other leg.&quot; He celebrated his birthday every year at the River Music Experience in Davenport, Iowa.

==Awards and honors==
Bellson was voted into the Halls of Fame for &quot;Modern Drummer&quot; magazine, in 1985, and the Percussive Arts Society, in 1978. Yale University named him a Duke Ellington Fellow in 1977. He received an honorary doctorate from Northern Illinois University in 1985. He performed his original concert – Tomus I, II, III – with the Washington Civic Symphony in historic Constitution Hall in 1993. A combination of full symphony orchestra, big-band ensemble and 80-voice choir, &quot;Tomus&quot; was a collaboration of music by Bellson and lyrics by his late wife, Pearl Bailey. Bellson was a nine-time Grammy Award nominee.

In January 1994, Bellson received the NEA Jazz Masters Award from the National Endowment for the Arts. As one of three recipients, he was lauded by NEA chair Jane Alexander, who said, &quot;These colossal talents have helped write the history of jazz in America.&quot;

==Personal life==
On November 19, 1952, Bellson married American actress and singer Pearl Bailey, in London. Bellson and Bailey adopted a son, Tony, in the mid-1950s, and a daughter, Dee Dee (born April 20, 1960). After Bailey&#x27;s death in 1990, Bellson married Francine Wright in September 1992. Wright, who had trained as a physicist and engineer at MIT, became his manager. The union lasted until his death. Dee Dee Bellson died on July 4, 2009, at age 49, within five months of her father.

<text>William Patton Black Jr. (September 17, 1926 – October 21, 1965) was an American musician and bandleader who is noted as one of the pioneers of rock and roll. He played in Elvis Presley&#x27;s early trio, The Blue Moon Boys. Black later formed Bill Black&#x27;s Combo.

==Early life and career==
William Patton Black Jr. was born on September 17, 1926, in Memphis, Tennessee, to a motorman for the Memphis Street Railway Company. He was the oldest of nine children. His father played popular songs on the banjo and fiddle to entertain the family. Black learned to play music at the age of 14 on an instrument made by his father—a cigar box with a board nailed to it and strings attached. At the age of sixteen, Black was performing &quot;honky-tonk&quot; music on acoustic guitar in local bars.

During World War II, Black was stationed with the U.S. Army at Fort Lee in Virginia. While in the Army, he met Evelyn, who played guitar as a member of a musical family. They married in 1946 and returned to Memphis. Black worked at the Firestone plant.

He began playing the upright double bass, modeling his &quot;slap bass&quot; technique after one of his idols, Fred Maddox, of Maddox Brothers and Rose. Black also developed a &quot;stage clown&quot; persona in the same way that Maddox entertained audiences. Black performed as an exaggerated hillbilly with blacked-out teeth, straw hat and overalls. According to his son, Black said his goal was always to give his audience &quot;a few moments of entertainment and maybe a little bit of humor that&#x27;ll tickle &#x27;em for a while.&quot;

In 1952, Black began playing in clubs and on radio shows with the guitarist Scotty Moore. Along with two other guitarists and a fiddler, they performed country music tunes by Hank Williams and Red Foley in Doug Poindexter&#x27;s band, the Starlight Wranglers. Black and Moore also played in a band with Paul Burlison, Johnny Burnette, Dorsey Burnette on steel guitar, and a drummer.

==The Blue Moon Boys==
In July 1954, Sam Phillips, of Sun Records, asked Black and Moore to play backup for the as-yet-unknown Elvis Presley. Black slap played the double bass with Moore on lead guitar, while Presley played rhythm guitar and sang lead. Neither musician was overly impressed with Presley, but they agreed a studio session would be useful to explore his potential.

On July 5, 1954, the trio met at Sun studios to rehearse and record a handful of songs. According to Moore, the first song they recorded was &quot;I Love You Because&quot;, but after a few country music songs that weren&#x27;t impressive they decided to take a break. During the break, Presley began &quot;acting the fool&quot; with Arthur Crudup&#x27;s &quot;That&#x27;s All Right (Mama)&quot;, a blues song. When the other two musicians joined in, Phillips taped the song. The upbeat sound was original. Black remarked, &quot;Damn. Get that on the radio and they&#x27;ll run us out of town.&quot;

The next day, the group recorded four more songs, including &quot;Blue Moon of Kentucky&quot;, by the bluegrass musician Bill Monroe, which he had written and recorded as a slow waltz. Sources credit Black with initiating the song, with Presley and Moore joining in. Moore said, &quot;Bill is the one who came up with &quot;Blue Moon of Kentucky.&quot; ... We&#x27;re taking a little break and he starts beating on the bass and singing &quot;Blue Moon of Kentucky,&quot; mocking Bill Monroe, singing the high falsetto voice. Elvis joins in with him, starts playing and singing along with him ...&quot; They ended up with a fast version of the song in 4/4 time. After an early take, Phillips can be heard on tape saying, &quot;Fine, man. Hell, that&#x27;s different—that&#x27;s a pop song now, nearly ʼbout.&quot;

Phillips took several acetates of the session to DJ Dewey Phillips (no relation) of Memphis radio station WHBQ&#x27;s &quot;Red, Hot and Blue&quot; show. From August 18 through December 8, &quot;Blue Moon of Kentucky&quot; was consistently higher on the charts, and then both sides began to chart across the South.

Black and Moore became Presley&#x27;s backup group and were paid 25% of his earnings. Moore and Black left the Starlite Wranglers after the success of &quot;That&#x27;s All Right&quot;, jealousy within the group forcing them to split. Their recordings at Sun were released with the credits as &quot;Elvis Presley, Scotty and Bill.&quot; The group was later billed as &quot;Elvis Presley and the Blue Moon Boys.&quot;

Over the next 15 months, the trio released five singles, toured across the South, and appeared regularly on the &quot;Louisiana Hayride&quot;. They had auditioned for the &quot;Grand Ole Opry&quot; in October 1954, but they failed to impress the people in charge, or the audience, and were not invited back.

In 1955, Black went to RCA Victor along with Presley and Moore when Presley&#x27;s contract was sold to that company. Except for the RCA reissue of &quot;Mystery Train&quot; and &quot;I Forgot to Remember to Forget&quot; (&quot;with Scotty and Bill&quot;), they were no longer credited on record labels.

Black played on early Presley recordings including &quot;Good Rockin&#x27; Tonight&quot;, &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot;, &quot;Baby Let&#x27;s Play House&quot;, &quot;Mystery Train&quot;, &quot;That&#x27;s All Right&quot;, and &quot;Hound Dog&quot;, and eventually became one of the first bass players to use the Fender Precision Bass (bass guitar) in popular music, on &quot;Jailhouse Rock&quot;, in the late 1950s.

Black, Moore and the drummer D. J. Fontana toured extensively during Presley&#x27;s early career. Black continued his onstage &quot;clown&quot; persona and developed comedy routines with Presley. Black&#x27;s onstage personality was a sharp contrast to the introverted stage presence of Moore. The balance fit the group&#x27;s performances.

According to Black&#x27;s son Louis, Moore said, &quot;Elvis used to just stand up there and not move, and Bill would jump around on the bass. Your daddy would come down through there and get everybody to laughing and loosen them up.&quot; Fontana called Black the mainstay of the band in the early days. &quot;He was a comedian who could warm up a crowd. That was necessary for us because we played for a lot of country crowds that weren&#x27;t used to people jumping up and down on stage.&quot;

==Bill Black&#x27;s Combo==
In 1959, Black joined a group of musicians which became Bill Black&#x27;s Combo. The lineup was Black (bass), Joe Lewis Hall (piano), Reggie Young (guitar), Martin Willis (saxophone), and Jerry Arnold (drums). There were several personnel changes. While Young was in the army, his position was filled by Hank Hankins, Chips Moman and Tommy Cogbill. On sax, Ace Cannon took over touring duties from Willis who remained in Memphis for the studio work and movie appearances. Carl McVoy replaced Hall in the studio, while Bobby Emmons replaced him on tour.

The band released blues instrumental &quot;Smokie&quot; for Hi Records (Hi 2018) in December 1959. &quot;Smokie, Part 2&quot; became a No. 17 U.S. pop hit, and made number one on the &quot;black&quot; music charts. It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc by the RIAA. A follow-up release, &quot;White Silver Sands&quot; (Hi 2021), was a Top 10 hit (#9) and, like its predecessor, topped the R&amp;B charts for four weeks.

Eight of the recordings by Bill Black&#x27;s Combo placed in the Top 40 between 1959 and 1962.

The Combo appeared in the 1961 film &quot;Teenage Millionaire&quot; and on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, where they performed a medley of &quot;Don&#x27;t Be Cruel&quot;, &quot;Cherry Pink&quot;, and &quot;Hearts of Stone&quot;, and were voted Billboard&#x27;s number one instrumental group of 1961.

Albums with themes included &quot;Bill Black&#x27;s Combo Plays Tunes by Chuck Berry&quot;, &quot;Bill Black&#x27;s Combo Goes Big Band&quot;, &quot;Bill Black&#x27;s Combo Goes West&quot;, and &quot;Bill Black&#x27;s Combo Plays the Blues&quot;. The Combo&#x27;s sound of danceable blues became a popular accompaniment for striptease dancers. Another characteristic of the Combo was Reggie Young thwacking on the guitar with a pencil.

==Lyn-Lou Studios==
In 1962, Bill Black opened a recording studio called &quot;Lyn-Lou Studios&quot; (a shortened nickname &quot;Linda-Lou&quot; he had for his daughter Nancy), and a record label named &quot;Louis&quot; after his son, on Chelsea Street in Memphis, Tennessee, with Larry Rogers (Studio 19, Nashville) as his engineer and producer. Johnny Black, Bill&#x27;s brother and also upright bass player, who knew Elvis at Lauderdale Courts before Bill, recalls visiting Bill at the studio and reported that Bill would be totally absorbed mixing and playing back tracks.

Bob Tucker and Larry Rogers purchased Lyn-Lou Studios after Bill Black&#x27;s death in 1965. The studio recorded many Bill Black Combo albums (with billings such as &quot;The Best Honky Tonk Band in America&quot; and &quot;The band who opened for the Beatles&quot;) and produced number-one country hits for Charly McClain, T.G. Shepard, Billy Swan and others. The house band for these sessions was the Shylo Band, featuring guitarist/songwriter Ronnie Scaife, nephew of Cecil Scaife, famed Sun Studio engineer.

Early in 1963, Black sent from two to five different versions of the Combo to different regions of the country at the same time, while staying off the road himself, wanting to concentrate on his business, family and his health.

==Illness and death==
In 1963, Bob Tucker joined Bill Black&#x27;s Combo as a road manager and guitar/bass player.

Black himself had been ill for the past year and a half and unable to travel. Nonetheless, he insisted that the band continue without him. Bill Black&#x27;s Combo created musical history in 1964 when they became the opening act for the Beatles (at their request) on their historic 13-city tour of America after their appearance on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;. Black himself was not well enough to make the tour.

After two surgeries and lengthy hospital stays, Black died of a brain tumor on October 21, 1965, at age 39. His death occurred during his third operation that doctors had hoped would eradicate the tumor permanently. Black&#x27;s body was buried next to his father, William Patton Black Sr., at Forest Hill Cemetery in Memphis, Tennessee. Presley was criticized for not attending the funeral, but he believed that his presence would turn it into a media frenzy. He decided instead to visit the family privately after the service to express his condolences. According to Louis Black, Presley said, &quot;If there&#x27;s anything that y&#x27;all need, you just let me know and it&#x27;s yours.&quot;

Black&#x27;s widow sold Bob Tucker and Larry Rogers the rights to use the name Bill Black&#x27;s Combo. The band changed to country music when it joined Columbia Records, and won Billboard&#x27;s Country Instrumental Group of the Year award in 1976.

==Legacy==
Bill Black&#x27;s Combo cut more than 20 albums, toured the United States and Europe and won awards as the best instrumental group in America in 1966 and 1967. Bob Tucker worked for the University of Memphis as Professor of Music Business while leading the combo.

Black&#x27;s main stand-up bass is today owned by ex-Beatle Paul McCartney, who received the instrument as a birthday present from his wife Linda in the late 1970s. The bass can be seen in the video clip to McCartney&#x27;s song &quot;Baby&#x27;s Request&quot;. In the documentary film &quot;In the World Tonight&quot;, McCartney can be seen playing it and singing his version of &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot;. In 1995, he played it on &quot;Real Love&quot;, the last &quot;new&quot; Beatles record (one of two in which McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr overdubbed a full arrangement onto a John Lennon home recording from the late 1970s).

Actor Elliott Street portrayed Black in the TV movie &quot;Elvis&quot;, starring Kurt Russell.

Actor Blake Gibbons portrayed Black in the short-lived 1990 TV series &quot;Elvis&quot;, starring Michael St. Gerard.

In 2005, Clay Steakley portrayed Black in the 2005 CBS miniseries &quot;Elvis&quot;, starring Jonathan Rhys Meyers.

In 2007, Black was inducted into the Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum.

On April 4, 2009, Bill Black was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

In 2020, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Black as 40th greatest bass player of all time.

In 2022, Adam Dunn portrayed Black in the movie &quot;Elvis&quot;, starring Austin Butler.

<text>Multisensory worship or multi-sensory worship is a form of alternative worship, often associated with the emerging church. Multisensory worship is usually corporate worship that is designed to engage the senses.

Proponents of multisensory worship often contend that in the postmodern world people don&#x27;t simply want to hear about God or sing about God, but instead want to feel and experience the presence of God. It frequently involves the use of video and onscreen graphics which are designed to speak to people through the power of the image. Audio-visual elements are often added to supplement sermons and teaching. Thus multisensory worship involves a great deal of experimentation and variety in crafting a more holistic worship experience. Spaces designed for multisensory worship often feature floral arrangements, paintings, and creative lighting to enhance the experience of participants. Multisensory worship is part prayer, part worship, sometimes using prayer stations to evoke the physical senses. As opposed to just reading a book or hearing a sermon, a room is set up for participants to have an experience that involves the physical body in the act of worship.

An early pioneer of multisensory worship, Leonard Sweet, has a theory that worship should be EPIC in nature: experiential, participatory, image-rich and connective.

Another early proponent, Bob Rognlien, wrote in his book &quot;Experiential Worship&quot; that worship should engage the heart, soul, mind and strength. 

See also the books &quot;Handbook for MultiSensory Worship Volumes I and II&quot; and &quot;Redesigning Worship&quot;, all by Kim Miller of Ginghamsburg Church in Tipp City, Ohio, and the works of Greg Atkinson who also speaks and writes on multisensory worship, leadership, and hospitality.

<text>William II Jordan (; ) (died 1109) was the count of Berga beginning in 1094, the count of Cerdanya beginning in 1095, and regent of the County of Tripoli beginning in 1105.

He was the son of Count William I of Cerdanya and Sança, daughter of Count Ramon Berenguer I of Barcelona. William accompanied the army of Raymond IV of Toulouse, one of the leaders of the First Crusade, to the Holy Land. Raymond died in the east in 1105, leaving his young son Alfonso-Jordan as lord of Mons Peregrinus and Tortosa (of Syria) and nominal Count of Tripoli (which had not yet been captured by the crusaders). Since Alfonso-Jordan was still a child, Raymond&#x27;s soldiers chose William-Jordan as regent.

Meanwhile, in Toulouse, Raymond&#x27;s elder son Bertrand was ruling in his absence. After Raymond&#x27;s death the barons of Toulouse chose Alfonso to replace Bertrand, who, now overthrown, travelled to the east, arriving at Mons Peregrinus in 1108 to claim it for himself. There, he quarrelled with William over the inheritance of the Raymond&#x27;s lordship, and over the regency of still-unconquered Tripoli. William allied himself with Prince Tancred of Galilee, at the time regent of the Principality of Antioch, while Bertrand asked King Baldwin I of Jerusalem to intervene. Baldwin I, Baldwin of Bourcq, and Joscelin of Courtenay allied with Bertrand and William and Tancred were forced to compromise. Tancred was forced to give up his claim to the County of Edessa (but was allowed to keep Antioch); William and Bertrand divided Tripoli between them, recognizing Tancred and Baldwin I as their respective overlords.

With the dispute settled, the crusader armies marched on Tripoli and besieged it, with assistance from the Genoese fleet. On July 12, 1109, they captured the city. A short time later William died of an arrow wound sustained during the siege, and the county passed to Bertrand alone.

<text>or is a village in Loppa Municipality in Finnmark county, Norway. The village is located on the mainland part of Loppa, along the Sandlandsfjorden, across from the uninhabited island of Silda. The nearby village of Sør-Tverrfjord lies about to the southeast. Sandland Chapel is located in the village.

Sandland is connected to Sør-Tverrfjord and a few other small villages by a road along the shore of the Sandlandsfjorden; however, this road is not connected to anything else. The only connection to the rest of Norway is a ferry that travels between the three villages of Øksfjord to Bergsfjord to Sør-Tverrfjord.

<text>The Anahulu River (also called Anahulu Stream) is a watercourse on the island of Oahu in the U.S. state of Hawaii. It is long. The Hawaiian meaning of the name is &quot;ten days&quot;.

==Description==
It is formed on the western side of the northern Koolau Range approximately northeast of Wahiawā by the confluence of Kawainui and Kawaiiki streams, both perennial. It flows west-northwest descending through Kawailoa Gulch, then empties into the eastern end of Waialua Bay at Haleiwa. It has a watershed of approximately and a 100-year peak discharge of 16,200 ft3/s (459 m³/s.

Archaeological evidence indicates that the valley of the river near its mouth was the site of ancient Hawaiian villages. The river valley was abandoned but was later repopulated in the early 19th century, partly as the result of a policy by a King Kamehameha I to grow food to support his military expeditions. The policy included the development of irrigated terraces. In 1832 U.S. Protestant missionaries John Emerson and his wife Ursula Sophia circumnavigated Oahu and put in at the mouth of the river, located at . At the village of Haleiwa (from &quot;hale&quot; (home) of the &quot;iwa&quot; (frigate bird)), they were welcomed by Chief Laanui and established the Liliuokalani Church in the village.

In the later 19th century the village of Haleiwa and the surrounding river valley became a popular summer vacation destination for the Hawaiian monarchs. The first hotel was built along the river by businessman Benjamin Dillingham, who also built Oahu railroad from Honolulu to the north shore in 1898. The railroad and hotel made the river valley a popular vacation spot.

<doc id="786501" wikidata="Q12343832" url="?curid=786501" title="Westerlies">
<text>The westerlies, anti-trades, or prevailing westerlies, are prevailing winds from the west toward the east in the middle latitudes between 30 and 60 degrees latitude. They originate from the high-pressure areas in the horse latitudes (about 30 degrees) and trend towards the poles and steer extratropical cyclones in this general manner. Tropical cyclones which cross the subtropical ridge axis into the westerlies recurve due to the increased westerly flow. The winds are predominantly from the southwest in the Northern Hemisphere and from the northwest in the Southern Hemisphere.

The westerlies are strongest in the winter hemisphere and times when the pressure is lower over the poles, while they are weakest in the summer hemisphere and when pressures are higher over the poles. The westerlies are particularly strong, especially in the Southern Hemisphere (called also &#x27;Brave West winds&#x27; at striking Chile, Argentina, Tasmania and New Zealand), in areas where land is absent, because land amplifies the flow pattern, making the current more north–south oriented, slowing the westerlies. The strongest westerly winds in the middle latitudes can come in the roaring forties, between 40 and 50 degrees south latitude. The westerlies play an important role in carrying the warm, equatorial waters and winds to the western coasts of continents, especially in the southern hemisphere because of its vast oceanic expanse.

==Behaviour==

If the Earth were tidally locked to the Sun, solar heating would cause winds across the mid-latitudes to blow in a poleward direction, away from the subtropical ridge. However, the Coriolis effect caused by the rotation of Earth tends to deflect poleward winds eastward from north (to the right) in the Northern Hemisphere and eastward from south (to the left) in the Southern Hemisphere. This is why winds across the Northern Hemisphere tend to blow from the southwest, but they tend to be from the northwest in the Southern Hemisphere. When pressures are lower over the poles, the strength of the westerlies increases, which has the effect of warming the mid-latitudes. This occurs when the Arctic oscillation is positive, and during winter low pressure near the poles is stronger than it would be during the summer. When it is negative and pressures are higher over the poles, the flow is more meridional, blowing from the direction of the pole towards the Equator, which brings cold air into the mid-latitudes.

Throughout the year, the westerlies vary in strength with the polar cyclone. As the cyclone reaches its maximum intensity in winter, the westerlies increase in strength. As the cyclone reaches its weakest intensity in summer, the Westerlies weaken. An example of the impact of the westerlies is when dust plumes, originating in the Gobi Desert combine with pollutants and spread large distances downwind, or eastward, into North America. The westerlies can be particularly strong, especially in the Southern Hemisphere, where there is less land in the middle to cause the progression of west to east winds to slow down. In the Southern hemisphere, because of the stormy and cloudy conditions, it is usual to refer to the westerlies as the roaring forties, furious fifties, or shrieking sixties according to the varying degrees of latitude.

==Impact on ocean currents==

Due to persistent winds from west to east on the poleward sides of the subtropical ridges located in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, ocean currents are driven in a similar manner in both hemispheres. The currents in the Northern Hemisphere are weaker than those in the Southern Hemisphere due to the differences in strength between the westerlies of each hemisphere. The process of western intensification causes currents on the western boundary of an ocean basin to be stronger than those on the eastern boundary of an ocean. These western ocean currents transport warm, tropical water polewards toward the polar regions. Ships crossing both oceans have taken advantage of the ocean currents for centuries.

The Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC), or the West Wind Drift, is an ocean current that flows from west to east around Antarctica. The ACC is the dominant circulation feature of the Southern Ocean and, at approximately 125 Sverdrups, the largest ocean current. In the northern hemisphere, the Gulf Stream, part of the North Atlantic Subtropical Gyre, has led to the development of strong cyclones of all types at the base of the Westerlies, both within the atmosphere and within the ocean. The Kuroshio (Japanese for &quot;Black Tide&quot;) is a strong western boundary current in the western north Pacific Ocean, similar to the Gulf Stream, which has also contributed to the depth of ocean storms in that region.

==Extratropical cyclones==
An extratropical cyclone is a synoptic scale low-pressure weather system that has neither tropical nor polar characteristics, being connected with fronts and horizontal gradients in temperature and dew point otherwise known as &quot;baroclinic zones&quot;.

The descriptor &quot;extratropical&quot; refers to the fact that this type of cyclone generally occurs outside of the tropics, in the middle latitudes of the planet, where the Westerlies steer the system generally from west to east. These systems may also be described as &quot;mid-latitude cyclones&quot; due to their area of formation, or &quot;post-tropical cyclones&quot; where extratropical transition has occurred, and are often described as &quot;depressions&quot; or &quot;lows&quot; by weather forecasters and the general public. These are the everyday phenomena which along with anticyclones, drive the weather over much of the Earth.

Although extratropical cyclones are almost always classified as baroclinic since they form along zones of temperature and dewpoint gradient, they can sometimes become barotropic late in their life cycle when the temperature distribution around the cyclone becomes fairly uniform along the radius from the center of low pressure. An extratropical cyclone can transform into a subtropical storm, and from there into a tropical cyclone, if it dwells over warm waters and develops central convection, which warms its core and causes temperature and dewpoint gradients near their centers to fade.

==Interaction with tropical cyclones==
When a tropical cyclone crosses the subtropical ridge axis, normally through a break in the high-pressure area caused by a system traversing the Westerlies, its general track around the high-pressure area is deflected significantly by winds moving towards the general low-pressure area to its north. When the cyclone track becomes strongly poleward with an easterly component, the cyclone has begun &quot;recurvature,&quot; entering the Westerlies. A typhoon moving through the Pacific Ocean towards Asia, for example, will recurve offshore of Japan to the north, and then to the northeast, if the typhoon encounters southwesterly winds (blowing northeastward) around a low-pressure system passing over China or Siberia. Many tropical cyclones are eventually forced toward the northeast by extratropical cyclones in this manner, which move from west to east to the north of the subtropical ridge. An example of a tropical cyclone in recurvature was Typhoon Ioke in 2006, which took a similar trajectory.

<text>The history of Pomerania starts shortly before 1000 AD, with ongoing conquests by newly arrived Polan rulers. Before that, the area was recorded nearly 2000 years ago as Germania, and in modern times Pomerania has been split between Germany and Poland. Its name comes from the Old Polish &quot;po more&quot;, which means &quot;(land) at the sea&quot;.

Settlement in the area started by the end of the Vistula Glacial Stage, about 13,000 years ago. Archeological traces have been found of various cultures during the Stone and Bronze Age, of Veneti and Germanic peoples during the Iron Age and, in the Middle Ages, Slavic tribes and Vikings. Starting in the 10th century, Piast Poland on several occasions acquired parts of the region from the south-east, while the Holy Roman Empire and Denmark reached the region in augmenting their territory to the west and north.

In the High Middle Ages, the area became Christian and was ruled by local dukes of the House of Pomerania and the Samborides, at various times vassals of Denmark, the Holy Roman Empire and Poland. From the late 12th century, the Griffin Duchy of Pomerania stayed with the Holy Roman Empire and the Principality of Rügen with Denmark, while Denmark, Brandenburg, Poland and the Teutonic Knights struggled for control in Samboride Pomerelia. The Teutonic Knights succeeded in annexing Pomerelia to their monastic state in the early 14th century. Meanwhile, the Ostsiedlung started to turn Pomerania into a German-settled area; the remaining Wends, who became known as Slovincians and Kashubians, continued to settle within the rural East. In 1325, the line of the princes of Rügen died out, and the principality was inherited by the House of Pomerania, themselves involved in the Brandenburg-Pomeranian conflict about superiority in their often internally divided duchy. In 1466, with the Teutonic Order&#x27;s defeat, Pomerelia became subject to the Polish Crown as a part of Royal Prussia. While the Duchy of Pomerania adopted the Protestant Reformation in 1534, as part of the Empire by then termed the &quot;Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation&quot;, Kashubia remained with the Roman Catholic Church. The Thirty Years&#x27; and subsequent wars severely ravaged and depopulated most of Pomerania. With the extinction of the Griffin house during the same period, the Duchy of Pomerania was divided between the Swedish Empire and Brandenburg-Prussia in 1648.

Prussia gained the southern parts of Swedish Pomerania in 1720. It gained the remainder of Swedish Pomerania in 1815, when French occupation during the Napoleonic Wars was lifted. The former Brandenburg-Prussian Pomerania and the former Swedish parts were reorganized into the Prussian Province of Pomerania, while Pomerelia in the partitions of Poland was made part of the Province of West Prussia. With Prussia, both provinces joined the newly constituted German Empire in 1871. Following the empire&#x27;s defeat in World War I, Pomerelia became part of the Second Polish Republic (Polish Corridor) and the Free City of Danzig was created. Germany&#x27;s Province of Pomerania was expanded in 1938 to include northern parts of the former Province of Posen–West Prussia, and in 1939 the annexed Polish territories became the part of Nazi Germany known as Reichsgau Danzig-West Prussia. The Nazis deported the Pomeranian Jews to a reservation near Lublin and mass-murdered Jews, Poles and Kashubians in Pomerania, planning to eventually exterminate Jews and Poles and Germanise the Kashubians.

After Nazi Germany&#x27;s defeat in World War II, the German–Polish border was shifted west to the Oder–Neisse line and all of Pomerania was placed under Soviet military control. The area west of the line became part of East Germany, the other areas part of the People&#x27;s Republic of Poland even though it did not have a sizeable Polish population. The German population of the areas east of the line was expelled, and the area was resettled primarily with Poles (some of whom were themselves expellees from former eastern Poland), and some Ukrainians (who were resettled under Operation Vistula) and Jews. Most of Western Pomerania (&quot;Vorpommern&quot;) today forms the eastern part of the state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania in Federal Republic of Germany, while the Polish part of the region is divided between West Pomeranian Voivodeship and Pomeranian Voivodeship, with their capitals in Szczecin and Gdańsk, respectively. During the late 1980s, the Solidarność and Die Wende movements overthrew the Communist regimes implemented during the post-war era. Since then, Pomerania has been democratically governed.

== Prehistory and antiquity ==

After the glaciers of the Vistula Glacial Stage retreated from Pomerania during the Allerød oscillation, a warming period that falls within the Early Stone Age, they left a tundra. First humans appeared hunting reindeer in the summer. A climate change in 8000 BC allowed hunters and foragers of the Maglemosian culture, and from 6000 BC of the Ertebølle-Ellerbek culture, to continuously inhabit the area. These people became influenced by farmers of the Linear Pottery culture who settled in southern Pomerania. The hunters of the Ertebølle-Ellerbek culture became farmers of the Funnelbeaker culture in 3000 BC. The Havelland culture dominated in the Uckermark from 2500 to 2000 BC. In 2400 BC, the Corded Ware culture reached Pomerania and introduced the domestic horse. Both Linear Pottery and Corded Ware culture have been associated with Indo-Europeans. Except for Western Pomerania, the Funnelbeaker culture was replaced by the Globular Amphora culture a thousand years later.

During the Bronze Age, Western Pomerania was part of the Nordic Bronze Age cultures, while east of the Oder the Lusatian culture dominated. Throughout the Iron Age, the people of the western Pomeranian areas belonged to the Jastorf culture, while the Lusatian culture of the East was succeeded by the Pomeranian culture, then in 150 BC by the Oxhöft (Oksywie) culture, and at the beginning of the first millennium by the Willenberg (Wielbark) Culture.

While the Jastorf culture is usually associated with Germanic peoples, the ethnic category of the Lusatian culture and its successors is debated. Veneti, Germanic peoples (Goths, Rugians, and Gepids) and possibly Slavs are assumed to have been the bearers of these cultures or parts thereof.

Beginning in the 3rd century, many settlements were abandoned, marking the beginning of the Migration Period in Pomerania. It is assumed that Burgundians, Goths and Gepids with parts of the Rugians left Pomerania during that stage, while some Veneti, Vidivarii and other, Germanic groups remained, and formed the Gustow, Debczyn and late Willenberg cultures, which existed in Pomerania until the 6th century.

=== Timeline 10,000 BC–600 AD ===

*~10,000 BC (Early Stone Age): first humans hunt in Pomerania after the Ice Age glaciers left (Hamburg culture, a subgroup of the Ahrensburg culture)
*8000–3000 BC (Middle Stone Age): Maglemosian culture, Ertebølle-Ellerbek culture (Lietzow subgroup)
*3000–1900 BC (Late Stone Age): Linear Pottery culture, Funnelbeaker culture, Havelland culture, Corded Ware culture, Globular Amphora culture
*1900–~550 BC (Bronze Age): Nordic Bronze Age (Western Pomerania), Lusatian Culture (Eastern Pomerania)
*~550 BC–~250 AD (Iron Age): Jastorf culture (Western Pomerania, 550–50 BC), Pomeranian culture (Pomerelia, 650–150 BC), Oxhöft (Oksywie) culture (Pomerelia, 150 BC–1 AD), Willenberg (Wielbark) culture (Pomerelia, 1–250 AD). In part associated with Veneti and Germanic peoples like Suebi, Goths, and Rugians.
*since 200: Migration Period: great parts of the population move south, associated with Burgundians, Goths, Gepids, and parts of the Rugians
*3rd–6th centuries: Gustow group in Western Pomerania, Dębczyn (Denzin) culture in most of Farther Pomerania, late stage of the Willenberg (Wielbark) culture in Pomerelia and some areas west of it. Associated with Rugian remains and other Germanic tribes, Vistula Veneti, and Vidivarii.

== Early Middle Ages ==


The southward movement of Germanic tribes and Veneti during the Migration Period had left Pomerania largely depopulated by the 7th century. Between 650 and 850 AD, West Slavic tribes settled in Pomerania. These tribes were collectively known as &quot;Pomeranians&quot; between the Oder and Vistula rivers, or as &quot;Veleti&quot; (later &quot;Liuticians&quot;) west of the Oder. A distinct tribe, the Rani, was based on the island of Rügen and the adjacent mainland. In the 8th and 9th centuries, Slavic-Scandinavian emporia were set up along the coastline as powerful centres of craft and trade.

In 936, the Holy Roman Empire set up the Billung and Northern marches in Western Pomerania, divided by the Peene. The Liutician federation, in an uprising of 983, managed to regain independence, but broke apart in the course of the 11th century because of internal conflicts. Meanwhile, Polish Piasts managed to acquire parts of eastern Pomerania during the late 960s, where the Diocese of Kołobrzeg was installed in 1000 AD. The Pomeranians regained independence during the Pomeranian uprising of 1005.

During the first half of the 11th century, the Liuticians participated in the Holy Roman Empire&#x27;s wars against Piast Poland. The alliance broke off when Poland was defeated, and the Liutician federation broke apart in 1057 during a civil war. The Liutician capital was destroyed by the Germans in 1068/69, making way for the subsequent eastward expansion of their western neighbour, the Obodrite state. In 1093, the Luticians, Pomeranians and Rani had to pay tribute to Obodrite prince Henry.

=== Timeline 600–1100 ===
*~650–~850: Slavic peoples appear and differentiate into several tribes grouped as Polabian Veleti (later &quot;Liuticians&quot;, &quot;Lutizians&quot;) in the West and Pomeranians in the East, resettling the regions left by the Germanic tribes
*since 800: various Scandinavian settlements and tradeposts, including Ralswiek, Altes Lager Menzlin, and Wollin (then &quot;Vineta&quot; or &quot;Jomsborg&quot; of the Jomsvikings).
*918: western parts incorporated into Northern March and March of the Billungs (Duchy of Saxony, Holy Roman Empire)
*955: Battle of Recknitz (&quot;Raxa&quot;): Germans and Rani suppress an Obodrite revolt in the Billung march
*In the 980s, a stronghold in Gdańsk was built, probably by the Polish ruler Mieszko I, who thereby connected the future Polish state ruled by the Piast dynasty with the trade routes of the Baltic Sea.
*983: uprising in the marches, Lutici regain independence after forming the Lutici federation
*Mieszko I of Poland launches several campaigns since the 960s, acquiring Kołobrzeg
*1000: Congress of Gniezno constitutes Reinbern&#x27;s Bishopric of Kołobrzeg
*1005: Pomerania regains independence, bishopric dissolved
*1046: A Siemomysł, called to Merseburg by king Henry III to conclude a peace settlement, is the first documented duke of Pomerania, though the extent and location of his realm is unknown.
*1056/57: The Lutici alliance breaks apart in a civil war, subsequent Obodrite eastward expansion.
*1067/68 and 1069: Saxon expeditions raid and destroy Rethra, the main Liutician stronghold and temple.
*1093: Lutici, Pomeranians and Rani have to pay tribute to Obodrite prince Henry.

== High Middle Ages ==

In the early 12th century, Obodrite, Polish, Saxon, and Danish conquests resulted in vassalage and Christianization of the formerly pagan and independent Pomeranian tribes. Local dynasties ruled the Principality of Rügen (House of Wizlaw), the Duchy of Pomerania (House of Pomerania), the Lands of Schlawe and Stolp (Ratiboride branch of the House of Pomerania), and the duchies in Pomerelia (Samborides). Monasteries were founded at Grobe, Kolbatz, Gramzow, and Belbuck which supported Pomerania&#x27;s Christianization and advanced German settlements.

The dukes of Pomerania expanded their realm into Circipania and Uckermark to the Southwest, and competed with the Margraviate of Brandenburg for territory and formal overlordship over their duchies. Pomerania-Demmin lost most of her territory and was integrated into Pomerania-Stettin in the mid-13th century. When the Ratiborides died out in 1223, competition arose for the Lands of Schlawe and Stolp, which changed hands numerous times.

Throughout the High Middle Ages, a large influx of German settlers and the introduction of German law, custom, and Low German language turned the area west of the Oder into a German one (Ostsiedlung). The Wends, who during the Early Middle Ages had belonged to the Slavic Rani, Lutician and Pomeranian tribes, were assimilated by the German Pomeranians. To the east of the Oder this development occurred later; in the area from Stettin eastward, the number of German settlers in the 12th century was still insignificant. The Kashubians descendants of Slavic Pomeranians, dominated many rural areas in Pomerelia.

The conversion of Pomerania to Christianity was achieved primarily by the missionary efforts of Absalon and Otto von Bamberg, by the foundation of numerous monasteries, and by the assimilatory power of the Christian settlers. A Pomeranian diocese was set up in Wolin, the see was later moved to Cammin.

The towns of the Hanseatic League were acting as quasi autonomous political and military entities. The Duchy of Pomerania gained the Principality of Rügen after two wars with Mecklenburg, the Lands of Schlawe and Stolp and the Lauenburg and Bütow Land. Pomerelia was integrated into the Monastic state of the Teutonic Knights after the Teutonic takeover of Danzig in 1308, and became a part of Royal Prussia in 1466.

The Duchy of Pomerania was internally fragmented into Pomerania-Wolgast, -Stettin, -Barth, and -Stolp. The dukes were in continuous warfare with the Margraviate of Brandenburg due to Uckermark and Neumark border disputes and disputes over formal overlordship of Pomerania.

In 1478, the duchy was reunited under the rule of Bogislaw X, when most of the other dukes had died of the plague.

== Early Modern Age ==


Throughout this time, Pomerelia was within Royal Prussia, a part of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth with considerable autonomy. In the late 18th century, it became a part of Prussia.

The Duchy of Pomerania was fragmented into Pomerania-Stettin (Farther Pomerania) and Pomerania-Wolgast (Western Pomerania) in 1532, underwent Protestant Reformation in 1534, and was even further fragmented in 1569, while all parts stayed part of the Empire&#x27;s Upper Saxon Circle. In 1627, the Thirty Years&#x27; War reached the duchy. Since the Treaty of Stettin (1630), it was under Swedish control. In the midst of the war, the last duke Bogislaw XIV died without an issue. Garrison, plunder, numerous battles, famine and diseases left two thirds of the population dead and most of the country ravaged. In the Peace of Westphalia of 1648, the Swedish Empire and Brandenburg-Prussia agreed on a partition of the duchy, which came into effect after the Treaty of Stettin (1653). Western Pomerania became Swedish Pomerania, a Swedish dominion, while Farther Pomerania became a Brandenburg-Prussian province.

A series of wars affected Pomerania in the following centuries. As a consequence, most of the formerly free peasants became serfs of the nobles. Brandenburg-Prussia was able to integrate southern Swedish Pomerania into her Pomeranian province during the Great Northern War, which was confirmed in the Treaty of Stockholm in 1720. In the 18th century, Prussia rebuild and colonised her war-torn Pomeranian province.

== Modern Age ==


From the Napoleonic Wars to World War I, Pomerania was administered by the Kingdom of Prussia as the Province of Pomerania (Western and Farther Pomerania) and West Prussia (Pomerelia).

The Province of Pomerania was created from the Province of Pomerania (1653–1815) (Farther Pomerania and southern Vorpommern) and Swedish Pomerania (northern Vorpommern), and the districts of Schivelbein and Dramburg, formerly belonging to the Neumark. While in the Kingdom of Prussia, the province was heavily influenced by the reforms of Karl August von Hardenberg and Otto von Bismarck. The Industrial Revolution had an impact primarily on the Stettin area and the infrastructure, while most of the province retained a rural and agricultural character. Since 1850, the net migration rate was negative, Pomeranians emigrated primarily to Berlin, the West German industrial regions and overseas. Also, more than 100,000 Kashubian Poles emigrated from Pomerania between 1855 and 1900, for economic and social reasons, in what is called the Kashubian diaspora. In areas where ethnically Polish population lived along with ethnic Germans a virtual apartheid existed (in Prussian Pomerania this was mostly the Lauenburg and Bütow Land), with bans on Kashubian or Polish language and religious discrimination, besides attempts to colonize areas of prevailingly ethnically Polish population with ethnic Germans the Prussian Settlement Commission, established in 1886 and restricted to act in Posen and West Prussia provinces only, parcelled acquired noble latifundia into 21,727 homesteads of an average of 13 to 15 hectares, introducing 154,000 ethnic German colonists before World War I, which were all outside of Prussian Pomerania, but are also located in areas today denominated as Pomerania in Polish geography. This was surpassed after 1892 by efforts of new private initiatives by minority of ethnically Polish Germans, but a majority in wide parts of Posen and West Prussia province, who founded the Prussian banks &quot;Bank Ziemski&quot;, &quot;Bank Społek Zarobkowych&quot; (cooperative central clearing bank) and land acquisition cooperatives (spółki ziemskie) which collected private funds and succeeded to buy more latifundia from defaulted owners and settle more ethnically Polish Germans as farmers on the parcelled land than their governmentally funded counter-party. A big success of the Prussian activists for the Polish nation.

After the First World War, under the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, the Pomeranian Voivodeship of the Second Polish Republic was established from the bulk of West Prussia. Poland became a democracy and introduced the women&#x27;s right to vote in 1918.

The German minority in the newly created Polish Republic moved to Germany in large numbers, mostly of their own free will and due to their economic situation. For use as a harbor within the Polish Corridor, Poland built a large Baltic port at the site of the former village Gdynia. Also under the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, the Danzig (Gdańsk) area became the Free City of Danzig, a city-state under League of Nations protection.

After the Kaiser&#x27;s abdication, democracy and the women&#x27;s right to vote were introduced to the Weimar Republic and through it to the Free State of Prussia and the Province of Pomerania of which it was a part. The economic situation worsened due to the consequences of World War I and the worldwide recession. As in the Kingdom of Prussia before, Pomerania was a stronghold of the nationalistic and anti-Semitic German National People&#x27;s Party. Between 1920 and 1932, the government of the state of Prussia was led by the Social Democrats, with Otto Braun Prussian minister-president almost continuously during this time.

== Nazi era ==


In 1933, the Province of Pomerania, like all of Germany, came under control of the Nazi regime. During the following years, the Nazis led by Gauleiter Franz Schwede-Coburg manifested their power by Gleichschaltung and repression of their opponents. Pomerelia then formed the Polish Corridor of the Second Polish Republic. Concerning Pomerania, Nazi diplomacy aimed at incorporation of the Free City of Danzig and a transit route through the corridor, which was rejected by the Polish government.

In 1939, the German Wehrmacht invaded Poland. Inhabitants of the region from all ethnic backgrounds were subject to numerous atrocities by Nazi Germany forces, of which the most affected were Polish and Jewish civilians. Pomerelia was made part of Reichsgau Danzig-West Prussia. The Nazis set up concentration camps, ethnically cleansed Poles and Jews, and systematically exterminated Poles, Roma and the Jews. In Pomerania Albert Forster was directly responsible for extermination of non-Germans in Danzig-West Prussia. He personally believed in the need to engage in genocide of Poles and stated that &quot;We have to exterminate this nation, starting from the cradle&quot;, and declared that Poles and Jews were not human.

Around 70 camps were set up for Polish populations in Pomerania where they were subjected to murder, torture and in case of women and girls, rape before executions. Between 10 and 15 September Forster organised a meeting of top Nazi officials in his region and ordered the immediate removal of all &quot;dangerous&quot; Poles, all Jews and Polish clergy In some cases Forster ordered executions himself. On 19 October he reprimanded Nazi officials in the city of Grudziadz for not &quot;spilling enough Polish blood&quot;.

*1945: Soviet capture following the Red Army&#x27;s East Pomeranian Offensive and the northern theater of the Battle of Berlin, all of Pomerania under Soviet military control. Mass suicides, evacuations, flight, expulsion.

== Communist era and recent history ==


In 1945, Pomerania was taken by the Red Army and Polish Armed Forces in the East during the East Pomeranian Offensive and the Battle of Berlin. After the post-war border changes, the German population that had not yet fled was expelled from what in Poland was propagated to be recovered territory. The area east of the Oder and the Szczecin (former Stettin) area was resettled primarily with Poles, who themselves were expelled from Eastern Poland that was re-attached to the USSR. Most of the German cultural heritage of the region was destroyed. Most of Western Pomerania stayed with Germany and was merged into Mecklenburg.

With the consolidation of Communism in East Germany and Poland, Pomerania was part of the Eastern Bloc. In the 1980s, the Solidarność movement in Gdańsk (Danzig) and the Wende movement in East Germany forced the Communists out of power and led to the establishment of democracy in both the Polish and German part of Pomerania.

<text>Capital punishment in traditional Jewish law has been defined in Codes of Jewish law dating back to medieval times, based on a system of oral laws contained in the Babylonian and Jerusalem Talmud, the primary source being the Hebrew Bible. In traditional Jewish law there are four types of capital punishment: a) stoning, b) burning by ingesting molten lead, c) strangling, and d) beheading, each being the punishment for specific offenses. Except in special cases where a king can issue the death penalty, capital punishment in Jewish law cannot be decreed upon a person unless there were a minimum of twenty-three judges (Sanhedrin) adjudicating in that person&#x27;s trial who, by a majority vote, gave the death sentence, and where there had been at least two competent witnesses who testified before the court that they had seen the litigant commit the offense. Even so, capital punishment does not begin in Jewish law until the court adjudicating in this case had issued the death sentence from a specific place (formerly, the Chamber of Hewn Stone) on the Temple Mount in the city of Jerusalem.

==History==
Capital and corporal punishment in Judaism have a complex history which has been a subject of extensive debate. The Bible and the Talmud specify capital punishment by the &quot;Four Executions of the Court,&quot; — stoning, burning, decapitation, and strangulation — for the most severe transgressions, and the corporal punishment of flagellation for intentional transgressions of negative commandments that do not incur one of the Four Executions. According to Talmudic law, the authority to apply capital punishment ceased with the destruction of the Second Temple. The Mishnah states that a Sanhedrin that executes one person in seven years — or seventy years, according to Eleazar ben Azariah — is considered bloodthirsty. During the Late Antiquity, the tendency of not applying the death penalty at all became predominant in Jewish courts. In practice, where medieval Jewish courts had the power to pass and execute death sentences, they continued to do so for particularly grave offenses, although not necessarily the ones defined by the law. While it was recognized that the use of capital punishment in the post-Second Temple era went beyond the biblical warrant, the rabbis who supported it believed that it could be justified by other considerations of Jewish law. Whether Jewish communities ever practiced capital punishment according to rabbinical law, and whether the rabbis of the Talmudic era ever supported its use even in theory, has been a subject of historical and ideological debate.

The 12th-century Jewish legal scholar Maimonides stated that &quot;It is better and more satisfactory to acquit a thousand guilty persons than to put a single innocent one to death.&quot; Maimonides argued that executing a defendant on anything less than absolute certainty would lead to a slippery slope of decreasing burdens of proof, until convictions would be mere &quot;according to the judge&#x27;s caprice&quot;. Maimonides was concerned about the need for the law to guard itself in public perception, to preserve its majesty, and to retain the people&#x27;s respect.

The position of Jewish Law on capital punishment often formed the basis of deliberations by Israel&#x27;s Supreme Court. It has been carried out by Israel&#x27;s judicial system only twice, in the cases of Adolf Eichmann and Meir Tobianski.

==Capital punishment in classical sources==
===In the Pentateuch===

The institution of capital punishment in Jewish law is defined in the Law of Moses (Torah) in multiple places. The Mosaic Law provides for the death penalty to be inflicted upon those persons convicted of the following offenses: 
* adultery (for a married woman and her lover)
* bestiality
* blasphemy
*child sacrifice
* false testimony in capital cases
* false prophecy
* proselytizing and promoting other religions
* male homosexual relations
* idolatry, actual or virtual
* incestuous relations
* insubordination to supreme authority
*lying about one&#x27;s virginity upon marrying a spouse () 
* kidnapping
* licentiousness of a priest&#x27;s daughter
* murder
* rape committed against a betrothed woman
* striking, cursing, or otherwise rebelling against parental authority
* Sabbath-breaking
* touching Mount Sinai while God was giving Moses the Ten Commandments
* witchcraft, divination, necromancy, sorcery, etc.

===In Rabbinic Judaism===

The principal tractate in the Talmud that deals with such cases is Tractate Sanhedrin.

Cases concerning offenses punishable by death are decided by 23 judges. The reason for this odd number is that the early rabbis had learnt that it takes at least 10 judges to convict a man, and another 10 judges to acquit a man, and the court being unequal will result in a verdict rendered by majority vote. Strict regulations were in place as to how these judges were to be selected, based on their sex, age and family standing. For example, they could not appoint a judge who did not have children of his own, for he was thought to be less merciful towards other men&#x27;s children. Neither could they select a judge who was not a male, by way of an edict, and which others say was because of the levity and temerity of the other sex. Nor could they admit the testimony of women in a court of Jewish law where the death-penalty hinged over the accused.

The harshness of the death penalty indicated the seriousness of the crime. Jewish philosophers argue that the whole point of corporal punishment was to serve as a reminder to the community of the severe nature of certain acts. This is why, in Jewish law, the death penalty is more of a principle than a practice. The numerous references to the death penalty in the Torah underscore the severity of the sin, rather than the expectation of death. This is bolstered by the standards of proof required for application of the death penalty, which were extremely stringent. The &quot;Mishnah&quot; outlines the views of several prominent first-century CE rabbis on the subject:
&quot;A Sanhedrin that puts a man to death once in seven years is called a murderous one. Rabbi Eliezer ben Azariah said, &#x27;Or even once in 70 years.&#x27; Rabbi Tarfon and Rabbi Akiba said, &#x27;If we had been in the Sanhedrin, no death sentence would ever have been passed&#x27;; Rabban Simeon ben Gamaliel said, &#x27;If so, they would have multiplied murderers in Israel.&#x27;&quot;
The Talmud notes that &quot;forty years before the destruction of the [Second] Temple, capital punishment ceased in Israel.&quot; This date is traditionally put at 28 CE, a time that corresponds with the 18th year of Tiberius&#x27; reign. At this time, the Sanhedrin required the approbation of the Roman procurator of Judea before they could punish any malefactor by death. Other sources, such as Josephus, disagree. The issue is highly debated because of its relevance to the New Testament trial of Jesus. Ancient rabbis did not like the idea of capital punishment, and interpreted the texts in a way that made the death penalty virtually non-existent.

Legal proceedings involving capital punishment were to be handled with extreme caution. In all cases of capital punishment in Jewish law, the judges are required to open their deliberations by pointing out the good qualities of the litigant and to bring up arguments about why he should be acquitted. Only later did they hear the incriminating evidence. It was almost impossible to inflict the death penalty because the standards of proof were so high. As a result, convictions for capital offenses were rare, but did happen in Judaism. The standards of evidence in capital cases include:
* Two witnesses were required. Acceptability was limited to:
** Adult Jewish men who were known to keep the commandments knew the written and oral law, and had legitimate professions;
** The witnesses had to see each other at the time of the sin;
** The witnesses had to be able to speak clearly, without any speech impediment or hearing deficit (to ensure that the warning and the response were done);
** The witnesses could not be related to each other, or to the accused.
* The witnesses had to see each other, and both of them had to give a warning (&quot;hatra&#x27;ah&quot;) to the person that the sin they were about to commit was a capital offense;
* This warning had to be delivered within seconds of the performance of the sin (in the time it took to say, &quot;Peace unto you, my Rabbi and my Master&quot;);
* In the same amount of time, the person about to sin had to both respond that s/he was familiar with the punishment, but they were going to sin anyway; &quot;and&quot; begin to commit the sin/crime;
*However, if the accused has already committed the crime, the accused would have been given a chance to repent (i.e. Ezekiel 18:27), and if they repeated the same crime, or any other, it would lead to a death sentence. If witnesses were caught lying about the crime, they would be executed.
* The Beth Din (rabbinical court) had to examine each witness separately; and if even one minor point of their evidence, such as eye color, was contradictory the evidence was considered contradictory, and the evidence was not heeded;
* The Beth Din had to consist of a minimum of 23 judges;
* The majority could not be a simple majority - the split verdict that would allow conviction had to be at least 13 to 10 in favor of conviction;
* If Beth Din arrived at a unanimous verdict of guilty, the person was let go - the idea being that if no judge could find anything exculpatory about the accused, there was something wrong with the court.
* The witnesses were appointed by the court to be the executioners.
Where the death sentence was warranted but the court did not the jurisdiction to mete out the death sentence, such as when there were not two or more witnesses, the court had the authority to lock up the convicted individual within a cupola, or similar confined structure, and to feed them meager portions of bread and water until they died.

===Megillat Taanit===
According to an oral teaching appearing in &quot;Megillat Taanit&quot;, the four modes of execution formerly used in Jewish law were mostly orally transmitted practices not explicitly stated in the Written Law of Moses, although some modes of punishment are explicitly stated. &quot;Megillat Taanit&quot; records that &quot;On the fourth [day] of [the lunar month] Tammuz, the book of decrees had been purged ()&quot;. The Hebrew commentary (scholion) on this line brings two different explanations of this event; according to one of the explanations, the &quot;book of decrees&quot; was composed by the Sadducees and used by them as proof concerning the four modes of capital punishment; the Pharisees and rabbis preferred to determine the punishments via orally transmitted interpretation of scripture.

==Modes of punishment==
The court had the power to inflict four kinds of death penalty: stoning, burning, beheading, and strangling.
For some crimes, the Bible specifies which form of execution is to be used. Blasphemy, idolatry, Sabbath-breaking, witchcraft, prostitution by a betrothed virgin, or deceiving her husband at marriage as to her chastity (Deut. 22:21), and the rebellious son are punished with death by stoning; bigamous marriage with a wife&#x27;s mother and the prostitution of a priest&#x27;s daughter is punished by burning; communal apostasy is punished by the sword.

With reference to all other capital offenses, the law ordains that the perpetrator shall die a violent death, occasionally adding the expression, &quot;His (their) blood shall be upon him (them).&quot; This expression applies to death by stoning.

The Bible speaks also of hanging (Deut. 21:22), but (according to the rabbinical interpretation) not as a mode of execution, but rather of exposure after death.

The following is a list by Maimonides of the crimes punished by each form of capital punishment:

===Punishment by stoning===

Death by stoning (סקילה, &quot;skila&quot;) was issued for the transgression of one of eighteen crimes, among which being those who wantonly transgressed the Sabbath day by breaking its laws (excluding those who may have broken the Sabbath laws unintentionally), as well as a male who had a licentious connection with another male. Stoning was administered by throwing the condemned person off a height, typically twice the height of an average person, so that they would fall to the ground. If the fall did not result in death, a large stone would be dropped on the person&#x27;s chest. If this still did not cause death, bystanders would then continue to hurl stones until the person was dead. 

* Intercourse between a man and his mother.
* Intercourse between a man and his father&#x27;s wife (not necessarily his mother).
* Intercourse between a man and his daughter-in-law.
* Intercourse with another man&#x27;s wife from the first stage of marriage.
* Intercourse between two men.
* Bestiality.
* Cursing the name of God in God&#x27;s name.
* Idol worship.
* Giving one&#x27;s progeny to Molech (child sacrifice).
* Necromancy sorcery.
* Pythonic sorcery.
* Attempting to convince another to worship idols.
* Instigating a community to worship idols.
* Witchcraft.
* Violating the Sabbath.
* Cursing one&#x27;s own parent.
* Ben sorer umoreh, a stubborn and rebellious son.
===Punishment by burning===

Death by burning (שריפה, &quot;serefah&quot;) was issued for ten offenses, including prostitution and bigamous relations with one&#x27;s wife and their mother. Perpetrators were not burnt at the stake, but rather molten lead was poured down the perpetrator&#x27;s esophagus. Alternatively, the burning was inflicted after the perpetrator had been stoned, a precedent that was established in Achan&#x27;s stoning.
* The daughter of a priest who completed the second stage of marriage commits adultery.
* Intercourse between a man and his daughter.
* Intercourse between a man and his daughter&#x27;s daughter.
* Intercourse between a man and his son&#x27;s daughter.
* Intercourse between a man and his wife&#x27;s daughter (not necessarily his own daughter).
* Intercourse between a man and his wife&#x27;s daughter&#x27;s daughter.
* Intercourse between a man and his wife&#x27;s son&#x27;s daughter.
* Intercourse between a man and his mother-in-law.
* Intercourse between a man and his mother-in-law&#x27;s mother.
* Intercourse between a man and his father-in-law&#x27;s mother.
===Punishment by the sword===
Death by the sword (הרג, &quot;hereg&quot;) was issued in two cases: for wanton murder and for communal apostasy (idolatry). The perpetrators of these crimes were beheaded.

* Unlawful premeditated murder.
* Being a citizen of an Ir nidachat, a &quot;city that has gone astray&quot;.

===Punishment by strangulation===
Death by strangulation (חנק, &quot;chenek&quot;) was issued for six crimes, among which being a man who had a forbidden connection with another man&#x27;s wife (adultery), and a person who willfully caused injury (bruise) to one of his/her parents.
* Committing adultery with another man&#x27;s wife, when it does not fall under the above criteria.
* Wounding one&#x27;s own parent.
* Kidnapping another Israelite.
* Prophesying falsely.
* Prophesying in the name of other deities.
* A sage who is guilty of insubordination in front of the grand court in the Chamber of the Hewn Stone.
==Contemporary attitudes towards capital punishment==

Rabbinical courts have given up the ability to inflict any kind of physical punishment, and such punishments are left to the civil court system to administer. The modern institution of the death penalty, at least as practiced in the United States, is opposed by the major rabbinical organizations of Orthodox, Conservative, and Reform Judaism. In a 2014 poll, 57 percent of Jews surveyed said they supported life in prison without the chance of parole over the death penalty for people convicted of murder.

===Orthodox Judaism===

Orthodox Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan wrote: &quot;In practice, ... these punishments were almost never invoked, and existed mainly as a deterrent and to indicate the seriousness of the sins for which they were prescribed. The rules of evidence and other safeguards that the Torah provides to protect the accused made it all but impossible to actually invoke these penalties ... the system of judicial punishments could become brutal and barbaric unless administered in an atmosphere of the highest morality and piety. When these standards declined among the Jewish people, the Sanhedrin ... voluntarily abolished this system of penalties.

On the other hand, Rabbi Moshe Feinstein, in a letter to then-New York Governor Hugh Carey, states:
&quot;One who murders because the prohibition to kill is meaningless to him, and he is especially cruel, and so too when murderers and evil people proliferate, they [the courts] would [should?] judge [capital punishment] to repair the issue [and] to prevent murder – for this [action of the court] saves the state.&quot;

According to Yaakov Elman, imprisonment of criminals was impractically expensive under the material conditions of ancient society, which meant that the death penalty and other corporal punishments were the only available options for severe crimes. Thus, use of the death penalty in ancient society would not necessarily imply that the Jewish tradition prefers it in wealthy modern society.

===Conservative Judaism===

In Conservative Judaism, the death penalty was the subject of a responsum by its Committee on Jewish Law and Standards, which has gone on record as opposing the modern institution of the death penalty: &quot;The Talmud ruled out the admissibility of circumstantial evidence in cases which involved a capital crime. Two witnesses were required to testify that they saw the action with their own eyes. A man could not be found guilty of a capital crime through his own confession or through the testimony of immediate members of his family. The rabbis demanded a condition of cool premeditation in the act of crime before they would sanction the death penalty; the specific test on which they insisted was that the criminal be warned prior to the crime, and that the criminal indicate by responding to the warning, that he is fully aware of his deed, but that he is determined to go through with it. In effect, this did away with the application of the death penalty. The rabbis were aware of this, and they declared openly that they found capital punishment repugnant to them… There is another reason which argues for the abolition of capital punishment. It is the fact of human fallibility. Too often, we learn of people who were convicted of crimes, and only later are new facts uncovered by which their innocence is established. The doors of the jail can be opened; in such cases, we can partially undo the injustice. But the dead cannot be brought back to life again. We regard all forms of capital punishment as barbaric and obsolete.&quot;

===Reform Judaism===

Since 1959, the Central Conference of American Rabbis and the Union for Reform Judaism have formally opposed the death penalty. The Central Conference also resolved in 1979 that &quot;both in concept and in practice, Jewish tradition found capital punishment repugnant&quot;, and there is no persuasive evidence &quot;that capital punishment serves as a deterrent to crime&quot;.

===Humanistic Judaism===

Humanistic Judaism has no policy on the use of the death penalty.

<text>In the study of Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, polar easterlies are the dry, cold prevailing winds that blow around the high-pressure areas of the polar highs at the North and South Poles. Cold air subsides at the poles creating high pressure zones, forcing an equatorward outflow of air; that outflow is then deflected westward by the Coriolis effect. Unlike the westerlies in the middle latitudes and trade winds in tropics, the polar easterlies are often weak and irregular. Note, winds are named based on where they came from. The polar easterlies are one of the five primary wind zones, known as wind belts, that make up our atmosphere&#x27;s circulatory system. This particular belt of wind begins at approximately 60 degrees north and south latitude and reaches to the poles.

While all townships in Michigan are organized governments, a charter township has been granted a charter, which allows it certain rights and responsibilities of home rule that are generally intermediate between those of a city (a semi-autonomous jurisdiction in Michigan) and a village. Unless it is a home-rule village, a village is subject to the authority of any township in which it is located.

Of Michigan&#x27;s 1,240 townships, 139 are charter townships. A number of charter townships are among the most populous municipalities in Michigan. For example, Clinton Township and Canton Township, both in Metro Detroit, were respectively the 8th and 9th most populous municipalities in Michigan at the 2020 census. The most recent township to become a charter township is Long Lake Township, in Grand Traverse County, which was granted a charter in 2022.

==History==
Following World War II, suburbanization increased the population in many formerly outlying communities. In 1947, the state legislature created a special charter township status, which grants additional powers and streamlined administration in order to provide greater protection for townships against annexation of land by cities and villages. , there were 139 charter townships in Michigan. A township with a population of 2,000 or more may incorporate as a charter township and become a municipal corporation. It possesses all the powers of a non-charter township, in addition to those specified by the Charter Township Act of 1947.

==Government==
Legislative authority is exercised by an elected township board of seven members, consisting of the supervisor, township clerk, township treasurer, and four trustees. They must be residents of the township and eligible to vote in elections. All members of the board serve four-year terms. Unlike the boards for general law townships, which may have either five or seven members, a charter township must have seven members. If a general law township with a five-member board elects to become a charter township, two additional members are to be elected in the next general election.

Charter townships may appoint either a township superintendent or township manager, who can be assigned responsibilities for managing township functions. (This is comparable to cities that hire a city manager to oversee the day-to-day operations of the city). Otherwise, executive authority lies with the supervisor and various committees.

==Privileges==
A charter township may establish a variety of municipal services, such as a police force, fire department, and assessors, and may also acquire property. It may borrow money and issue bonds, with the approval of a majority of township voters in an election. Similarly, a charter township cannot levy taxes without the approval of a majority of the township population voting in an election. This is one significant difference from home-rule municipalities, in which the municipal authority can levy taxes without specific approval from voters.

==Requirements==
A charter township is mostly exempt from annexation from contiguous cities or villages, providing that the township meets certain requirements:
*Has state equalized valuation of at least $25,000,000
*Has a minimum population density of 150 people per square mile (58/km2)
*Provides fire protection service by contract or otherwise
*Is governed by a comprehensive zoning ordinance or master plan
*Provides solid waste disposal services to township residents, within or without the township, by contract, license, or municipal ownership
*Provides water or sewer services, or both, by contract or otherwise
*Provides police protection through contract with the sheriff in addition to normal sheriff patrol, through an intergovernmental contract, or through its own police department

==Annexation and 425 Agreements==

A charter township may still be subject to annexation under certain conditions, such as for the purpose of eliminating isolated islands of township or by vote of a majority of the residents of a portion of township. Temporary land transfers, which can involve charter townships, have provision under Public Act 425 of 1984. Under this statute, a charter township, for example, can have land transferred to a city in exchange for revenue sharing of the transferred parcels. These agreements, known as 425 Agreements, can last up to 50 years, and the land can either be completely transferred to the city or returned to the township upon fulfillment of the agreement.

<text>The Agracetus Campus of Monsanto Company was a soybean transformation laboratory. It had over 21,700 employees worldwide, and an annual revenue of US$11.365 billion reported for 2008.

The first successful genetically engineered crop ever produced for the commercial market was the &quot;Roundup Ready soybean&quot;, produced at Agracetus in 1991, and was one of fourteen successful transformation events. Scientists there used gold bead gene transfer technology coupled with the β-Glucuronidase reporter gene to produce the plant. The actual gun that shot the gold beads and produced the genetic modifications is now owned by the Smithsonian museum in Washington, DC. 

Every &quot;Roundup Ready soybean&quot; in the world has a relative which was genetically transformed at Agracetus. 80% of the world&#x27;s soybeans are &quot;Roundup Ready&quot;.

Agracetus was founded in 1981 as Cetus Corporation. Acquired by Monsanto in 1996, the research and development facility was located 8 miles (13 km) west of Madison in the city of Middleton, Wisconsin, on . The site had of research space, of greenhouse space, about 75 employees, and ten laboratories. Output of genetically modified soy plants is many thousands of transformation events per year.

Genetically modified cotton and genetically modified rice is also an important effort at Agracetus.

Monsanto closed the facility in 2016 when it centralized research to its headquarters in St Louis. They then donated the lab buildings to the University of Wisconsin–Madison.

<text>Uncle Meat is the sixth album by the Mothers of Invention, and seventh overall by Frank Zappa, released as a double album in 1969. &quot;Uncle Meat&quot; was originally developed as a part of &quot;No Commercial Potential&quot;, a project which spawned three other albums sharing a conceptual connection: &quot;We&#x27;re Only in It for the Money&quot;, &quot;Lumpy Gravy&quot; and &quot;Cruising with Ruben &amp; the Jets&quot;.

The album also served as a soundtrack album to the film of the same name, which Zappa eventually finished and released direct-to-video in 1987.

The music is diverse in style, drawing from orchestral, jazz, blues and rock music. The &quot;Uncle Meat&quot; album was a commercial success upon release, and has been highly acclaimed for its innovative recording and editing techniques, including experiments in manipulation of tape speed and overdubbing, and its diverse sound.

== Background ==

Frank Zappa, who had been interested in film since high school, decided to develop a film vehicle for the Mothers of Invention, titled &quot;Uncle Meat&quot;. The film would combine elements of science fiction and road stories inspired by the band&#x27;s sexual escapades. Subsequently, Zappa began working on a project called &quot;No Commercial Potential&quot;, which eventually became the albums &quot;We&#x27;re Only in It for the Money&quot;, &quot;Lumpy Gravy&quot;, &quot;Cruising with Ruben &amp; the Jets&quot; and &quot;Uncle Meat&quot;. Zappa stated, &quot;It&#x27;s all one album. All the material in the albums is organically related and if I had all the master tapes and I could take a razor blade and cut them apart and put it together again in a different order it still would make one piece of music you can listen to. Then I could take that razor blade and cut it apart and reassemble it a different way, and it still would make sense. I could do this twenty ways. The material is definitely related.&quot;

According to artist Cal Schenkel, who worked extensively with Zappa, &quot;I started working on the story of Ruben and the Jets that is connected with the Uncle Meat story, which is this old guy turns this teenage band into these dog snout people ... We started that before it actually became Ruben and the Jets. That came out of my love for comics and that style, the anthropomorphic animals, but also it was part of a running story line.&quot;

== Recording ==

For the recording sessions, Zappa worked at Apostolic Studios in Manhattan employing an unusual and innovative 12-track machine built by Scully. Zappa included a large number of overdubs, playing unconventional instruments through studio effects, and speeding up or slowing down recordings for artistic effect. Zappa wanted to make an album that would challenge the complacency of contemporary music fans, as he felt that his fanbase was &quot;accustomed to accepting everything that was handed to them ... politically, musically, sociallyeverything. Somebody would just hand it to them and they wouldn&#x27;t question it. It was my campaign in those days to do things that would shake people out of that complacency, or that ignorance and make them question things.&quot;

By the time the album was released, Lowell George and Buzz Gardner had joined the band, and both have their names listed in the inside cover despite joining after the album was recorded. George and bassist Roy Estrada would go on to form the band Little Feat in late 1969.

=== Music and lyrics ===

&quot;Uncle Meat&quot; featured a variety of music styles, including orchestral symphonies, free jazz, blues, doo wop and rock and roll. The album also contains spoken word segments featuring Suzy Creamcheese, and features a stronger focus on percussion instrumentation than previous works by Zappa, as well as emphasizing his strengths as a composer and arranger.

&quot;Nine Types of Industrial Pollution&quot; is melodically formless, rooted in percussion instrumentation, and features a guitar solo that was sped up in post production. &quot;Dog Breath, in the Year of the Plague&quot; is delivered as a rock and roll song, with the same theme being repeated as an instrumental later in the album, performed by keyboards, percussion and acoustic guitar. The rock and roll version features three verses with the first chorus being delivered by opera singer Nelcy Walker, and the second chorus featuring sped up vocals. After the third verse, the song becomes an avant-garde orchestral piece performed by percussion, keyboards and instruments; the album liner notes &quot;The weird middle section of DOG BREATH (after the line &quot;Ready to attack&quot;) has forty tracks built into it. Things that sound like trumpets are actually clarinets played through an electric device made by Maestro with a setting labeled Oboe D&#x27;Amore and sped up a minor third with a V.S.O. (variable speed oscillator). Other peculiar sounds were make[sic] on a Kalamazoo electric organ. The only equipment at our disposal for the modification of these primary sounds was a pair of Pultec Filters, two [Lang Equalizers], and three Melchor Compressors built into the mixing console. The board itself is exceptionally quiet and efficient (the only thing that allowed us to pile up so many tracks) and is the product of Mr. Lou Lindauer&#x27;s imagination &amp; workmanship.&quot;

In addition to the studio recordings, &quot;Uncle Meat&quot; featured live recordings made at the Royal Albert Hall, including a recording of Don Preston playing &quot;Louie Louie&quot; on the Albert Hall pipe organ, at the end of which Zappa announces it as having been performed by the &quot;London Philharmonic Orchestra&quot;. The doo wop-influenced &quot;Electric Aunt Jemima&quot; refers to Zappa&#x27;s guitar amplifier, equating it with the advertising character Aunt Jemima. Zappa explained, &quot;I get kind of a laugh out of the fact that other people are going to try to interpret that stuff and come up with some grotesque interpretations of it. It gives me a certain amount of satisfaction.&quot;

The album concludes with &quot;King Kong&quot;, a piece in 3/8, although the instrumental&#x27;s prelude, a free jazz improvisation over a rhythm section playing in a 5/8 time signature, occurs much earlier in the album. Six variations of the melody appear as the album&#x27;s finale, with the first establishing its simple melody, the second being a Fender Rhodes Electric Piano solo by Preston, the third showcasing a saxophone solo by Motorhead Sherwood, and the fourth featuring Bunk Gardner playing a soprano saxophone through various electronic effects that emulate the sound of a contrabassoon doubling his solo lines. Two more variations conclude the piece, which include a live recorded performance featuring a saxophone solo by Ian Underwood and then finally ending with a version with sped up gongs, overblown saxophones and other instruments.

== Release and reception ==

&quot;Uncle Meat&quot; was released as a double album by Bizarre and Reprise Records, subtitled, &quot;Most of the music from the Mothers&#x27; movie of the same name which we haven&#x27;t got enough money to finish yet.&quot; Despite the album&#x27;s experimental nature, it peaked at on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts.

=== Critical reception ===

Contemporary reviews of the album were highly favorable, recognizing it as an important album in Zappa&#x27;s discography. &quot;The New Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; described the album as an &quot;inspired monstrosity ... [an] assault of glorious noise&quot;. AllMusic writer Steve Huey wrote, &quot;despite the absence of a conceptual framework, the unfocused sprawl of &quot;Uncle Meat&quot; is actually a big part of its appeal. It&#x27;s exciting to hear one of the most creatively fertile minds in rock pushing restlessly into new territory, even if he isn&#x27;t always quite sure where he&#x27;s going.&quot;

=== Legacy ===

The &quot;Uncle Meat&quot; film was finally completed and released on home video in 1987. The &quot;Uncle Meat&quot; album was reissued as a double CD on Rykodisc that year. This release included a song recorded in 1982, &quot;Tengo na minchia tanta&quot;, sung in Sicilian and Italian by Massimo Bassoli, who identifies the song as being translated as &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Big Bunch of Dick&quot;. Also added to the 1987 CD is over 40 minutes of sounds and dialogue from the film. The track listing programs the new tracks at the beginning of the second disc, placing the material between the album&#x27;s original third and fourth sides. The original 1969 vinyl mix was reissued in 2016 as the first disc of &quot;Meat Light: The Uncle Meat Project/Object Audio Documentary&quot;.

<doc id="786596" wikidata="Q1077062" url="?curid=786596" title="1922–23 NHL season">
<text>The 1922–23 NHL season was the sixth season of the National Hockey League (NHL). Four teams played 24 games each. The Ottawa Senators defeated the Montreal Canadiens for the NHL championship, and then defeated Vancouver and Edmonton to win the Stanley Cup.

==Regular season==
At the start of the season, Newsy Lalonde found himself moving west as the Montreal Canadiens traded him to the Saskatoon Sheiks of the Western Canada Hockey League for a rising young star named Aurel Joliat. Joliat would help the Canadiens win the second playoff spot over the St. Patricks. Joliat scored two goals in his first game with the Canadiens, but Babe Dye had five goals in the Toronto St. Patricks&#x27; 7–2 win. Joliat finished with 12 goals and 21 points in 24 games.

The Canadiens sent Bert Corbeau and Edmond Bouchard to Hamilton
in exchange for Joe Malone, now in the twilight of his great career.

On January 31, 1923, the Montreal Canadiens and Hamilton Tigers played the first penalty-free game in NHL history, a 5–4 Montreal victory.

On February 14, 1923, CFCA, the radio station of the Toronto Daily Star, broadcast the third period of the Senators-St. Patricks game in Toronto. This was the first radio broadcast of an NHL game. The broadcaster has not been identified, but it may have been Norman Albert who broadcast the Midland-North Toronto game February 8 from the Toronto Arena.

On February 17, 1923, Cy Denneny of Ottawa scored his 143rd goal, surpassing Joe Malone as the all-time goal-scoring leader as the Ottawa Senators shut out the Montreal Canadiens 2–0.

===Standings===
==Playoffs==
This was the second year in which the Stanley Cup playoffs involved three leagues. The previous year saw all three second place teams win their respective leagues. This year, it was all the first place teams. The NHL &quot;total goals&quot; playoffs for the O&#x27;Brien Cup were won by the Ottawa Senators 3 goals to 2. The Pacific Coast Hockey Association abandoned its seven-man hockey in favour of the six-man rules used in the NHL and the Western Canada Hockey League. This allowed the PCHA and the WCHL to play interleague games. Despite playing interleague games, the two separate leagues kept their own standings. The newly renamed Vancouver Maroons won the PCHA championship and the Edmonton Eskimos won the WCHL championship.

===Stanley Cup playoffs===

The Stanley Cup playoffs were played in Vancouver. There, the WCHL champions received the privilege of battling the winner between Ottawa and Vancouver. In the end, Ottawa prevailed over both Western opponents to win their eighth Stanley Cup (third as a member of the NHL). Injuries had thinned the Senators line-up, and after seeing the gritty show put on by the undermanned Senators, Vancouver head coach Frank Patrick called them the greatest team he had ever seen.

<text>Pensacola High School is a secondary school located near downtown Pensacola, Florida, United States.

The school celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2001 and graduated its 100th class of seniors in 2005; however, the school has not always been at its current location. It was moved to Maxwell Street in 1952. In 1969, a fire gutted the previous school building on Lee Square, prompting its demolition. Currently, it is the oldest secondary school in Pensacola.

The school is part of the Escambia County School District. A former principal, Norm Ross, is the deputy superintendent of schools for the county. Currently, the principal is Amy Gordon who previously served as Assistant Principal at Booker T. Washington High School for eight years.

After Hurricane Ivan, which struck the Pensacola area on September 16, 2004, Pensacola High School was damaged. While large renovations were needed, the school remained open and in operation. The gymnasium, which had only recently been remodeled, was demolished in June 2005. The auditorium was rebuilt in the spring of 2007, and the gymnasium was rebuilt in time for the 2008–2009 school year.

==Origins==
The first public school for boys in Pensacola was organized in 1870. A two-story building on Wright Street was erected by the School Board in 1875. It was known as the &quot;Pensacola Academy&quot; and its principal was John Wilmer. In 1886, a new building was erected on Lee Square, known as &quot;Public School No. 1&quot;. Its first graduating class consisted of Albert Reed and J. Whiting Hyer.

In 1905, Pensacola Senior High School was organized in the Public School No. 1 building. The school was a four-year high school, and its first principal was J. B. Lockey. PHS&#x27;s first graduating class consisted of Dudley Barrow and Nell Richards.

Pensacola High School is also recognized as having Florida&#x27;s oldest high school football program, girls basketball program, and school yearbook.

==International Baccalaureate==
Pensacola High School is the only school in Escambia County to have an International Baccalaureate program. It is an application-based program, typically accepting applications in the fall of a student&#x27;s 8th, 9th, or 10th grade year.

The International Baccalaureate program was introduced in 1986 and has been a well recognized program since. IB is a university-preparatory program and is designed to prepare students for admission to and success at prestigious universities.

IB program students must complete rigorous, college-level curriculum in addition to a Community Action Service project, an extended essay, and various other academic and social requirements in order to receive their IB diploma.

PHS IB is the only school in Northwest Florida with National Merit Commended Scholars, Semi-Finalists, and Finalists every year for the past 21 years. In addition, 15 students have been accepted into MIT in the last 16 years. At least one student every year has been accepted into a top Ivy League School

PHS IB is the only school in the county that offers:

* 3 years of Chemistry, Biology, and Physics.

* AP BC Calculus &amp; IB Math HL -instrumental in some college acceptance.

PHS is consistently ranked one of the top most challenging schools
==Communities served==
Most of Pensacola&#x27;s historic North Hill community, sections of East Hill community, downtown Pensacola and towards Naval Air Station Pensacola, and Pensacola Beach are zoned for Pensacola High School.

Pensacola High School also serves students throughout Northwest Florida through magnet programs and career academies:
International Baccaleaurate Program,
Scholar&#x27;s Program,
English Language Learner Program,
Academy for Health Professions,
Advanced Manufacturing Academy,
Early Childhood Education Academy,
Law and Public Service Academy, 
Sports Medicine Academy, and Culinary Arts Academy
Even though Pensacola Beach is zoned to Pensacola High School, most high-school students in Pensacola Beach attend Gulf Breeze High School, operated by Santa Rosa County School District.

==National recognition and prominence==
In the news magazine &quot;Newsweek&quot;&#x27;s published list of America&#x27;s Top Public High Schools, Pensacola High School ranked as follows:

2003 - #188
2005 - #8
2006 - #38
2007 - #38
2008 - #42
2009 - #54

2010 - #22

2016 - The &quot;Washington Post&quot; named Pensacola High School in the top 10% of the hardest schools in America, ranking it number 35 out of several thousand.

==Extracurricular programs==

PHS currently features several extracurricular activities that compete in Escambia County, and across the state:

* PHS is home to FL–12 AFJROTC, a large Air Force JROTC unit founded in 1969. FL–12 is one of the first JROTC units in the United States. The FL–12 drill team was founded in 1972, winning titles at the local, region, and national level.
* The Academic Team (quiz bowl) has had the longest win streak in the Cox Academic Tournament. The team has been champions for the previous ten years. The team has competed on the state and national level, with both the team and individual team members placing highly.
* Mu Alpha Theta (Math Team) which attends three regional competitions and the Milton math competition. The Pensacola High School math team consistently has individuals placing in the top ten and teams placing in the top five. It usually also places in the sweepstakes division.
* The PHS drama troupe has been a successful program for many years, competing and winning competitions at the state level.
*The Future Business Leaders of America chapter at PHS is one of the largest organizations on campus and is successful at state competitions, with the current state president being a PHS student.
*The PHS Health Occupations Students of America student group is competitive at the state level.
* PHS football team has the distinction of being the oldest football program in the state: pro, college or high school. The first game was played in 1905. In 2009 the PHS Football team won the Class 3A State Championship.
* PHS also features a variety of athletic programs: boys&#x27; football, baseball, soccer, weightlifting, lacrosse, tennis, swim and dive, track and field, cross country, and golf; and girls&#x27; volleyball, basketball, soccer, softball, cross country, track and field, weightlifting, swimming and diving, tennis, golf, lacrosse, and flag football.
* In addition to many athletic programs, PHS also has a student band and cheerleading team, as well as a Student Government Association

<doc id="786716" wikidata="Q627924" url="?curid=786716" title="The Dickson Experimental Sound Film">
<text>The Dickson Experimental Sound Film is a film made by William Dickson in late 1894 or early 1895. It is the first known film with live-recorded sound and appears to be the first motion picture made for the Kinetophone, the proto-sound-film system developed by Dickson and Thomas Edison. (The Kinetophone, consisting of a Kinetoscope accompanied by a cylinder-playing phonograph, was not a true sound-film system, for there was no attempt to synchronize picture and sound throughout playback.) The film was produced at the &quot;Black Maria&quot;, Edison&#x27;s New Jersey film studio. There is no evidence that it was ever exhibited in its original format.

In 2003, The &quot;Dickson Experimental Sound Film&quot; was included in the annual selection of 25 motion pictures added to the National Film Registry of the Library of Congress, being deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; and recommended for preservation.

== Synopsis ==
The film features Dickson playing a violin into a recording horn for an off-camera wax cylinder. The melody is from a barcarolle, &quot;Song of the Cabin Boy&quot;, from &quot;Les Cloches de Corneville&quot; (literally &quot;The Bells of Corneville&quot;; presented in English-speaking countries as &quot;The Chimes of Normandy&quot;), a light opera composed by Robert Planquette in 1877. In front of Dickson, two men dance to the music. In the final seconds, a fourth man briefly crosses from left to right behind the horn. The running time of the restored film is seventeen seconds; the accompanying cylinder contains approximately two minutes of sound, including twenty-three seconds of violin music, encompassing the film&#x27;s soundtrack.

==Rediscovery==
A soundless 35mm nitrate print of the movie, described as precisely forty feet long, was acquired by the Museum of Modern Art and transferred to safety film in 1942. Thomas A. Edison, Incorporated donated the Edison Laboratory to the U.S. National Park Service in 1956. The soundtrack was inventoried at the Edison National Historic Site in the early 1960s when a wax cylinder in a metal canister labeled &quot;Dickson—Violin by W.K.L. Dixon with Kineto&quot; was found in the music room of the Edison laboratory. In 1964, researchers opened the canister only to find that the cylinder was broken in two; that year, as well, all nitrate film materials remaining at the facility were removed to the Library of Congress for conservation. Among the filmstrips was a print that the Library of Congress catalogued as &quot;Dickson Violin&quot;. According to Patrick Loughney, the library&#x27;s film and TV curator, this print is &quot;thirty-nine feet and fourteen frames [two frames short of 40 feet].&quot;

The connection between the film and the cylinder was not made until 1998 when Loughney and Edison NHS sound recordings curator Jerry Fabris arranged for the cylinder to be repaired and its contents recovered at the Rodgers and Hammerstein Archive of Recorded Sound in New York. A new reel-to-reel master was created, allowing for fidelity reproduction onto digital audio tape. As the library was not equipped to synchronize the recovered soundtrack with the film element, producer and restoration specialist Rick Schmidlin suggested that award-winning film editor Walter Murch be enlisted on the project (the two had worked together on the 1998 restoration of Orson Welles&#x27;s &quot;Touch of Evil&quot;). Murch was given the short piece of film and the two minutes of sound recovered from the cylinder to work with. By digitally converting the film and editing the media together, Murch synchronized the visual and audio elements. Industrial Light &amp; Magic also had an unspecified role in the film&#x27;s restoration. This version was projected on a 20&#x27; screen at the Edison National Historic Site on June 1, 2002, as part of the Black Maria Film Festival.

On the cylinder, before the camera starts rolling, a man&#x27;s voice can be heard to say, &quot;I asked if it&#x27;s working. Is it working already? Go ahead.&quot; This extra sound is included on the version of the film that was distributed in the early 2000s. However, since filming had not yet begun when the words were uttered, this cannot be claimed as the first incidence of the spoken word on film.

One question that remains unanswered is how the eventual running time of just over 17 seconds was arrived at. Per the curatorial reports, the 35-mm prints have a standard 16 frames per foot of film— plus 14 frames thus equals a total of 638 frames. Murch describes the film as having been shot at 40 frames per second (fps); Loughney describes it as 46 fps. At 40 fps, 638 frames would run 15.95 seconds, which should be the maximum length of the restored film if all other reports are correct; as Loughney notes, at 46 fps, the film would last 13.86 seconds. If the latter figure is correct, as many as 9 seconds of film are missing from both extant prints if the entire violin performance was filmed. On the basis of his own tests of eighteen Kinetoscope films, scholar Gordon Hendricks argued that no Kinetoscope films were shot at 46 fps, making the speed of 40 fps reported by Murch more likely. Yet there is still a difference of more than a second between the maximum potential running time at that speed and the actual duration of the film as digitized by Murch. That 17-second running time works out to an average camera speed of approximately 37.5 fps, a significant difference from Murch&#x27;s report.

==Interpretations==

In his book &quot;The Celluloid Closet&quot; (1981), film historian Vito Russo discusses the film, claiming, without attribution, that it was titled &quot;The Gay Brothers&quot;. Russo&#x27;s unsupported naming of the film has been adopted widely online and in at least three books, and his unsubstantiated assertions that the film&#x27;s content is homosexual are frequently echoed. In addition to there being no evidence for the title Russo gives the film, in fact, the word &quot;gay&quot; was not generally used as a synonym for &quot;homosexual&quot; at the time the film was made. There is also no evidence that Dickson intended to present the men—presumably employees of the Edison studio—as a romantic couple. Given the lyrics of the song Dickson plays, which describes life at sea without women, it is more plausible that he intended a joke about the virtually all-male environment of the Black Maria. Also, in some areas of life it was acceptable in the 19th century for men to dance with men without homosexual overtones being perceived; all-male &quot;stag dances,&quot; for instance, were a standard part of life in the 19th century U.S. Army and were even part of the curriculum at West Point.

<text>Robert Bentley (25 March 1821 – 24 December 1893) was an English botanist. He is perhaps best remembered today for the four-volume &quot;Medicinal Plants&quot;, published in 1880 with Henry Trimen and containing over three hundred hand-colored plates by botanist David Blair.

==Life==
Robert Bentley was born in Hitchin, Hertfordshire in 1821. While apprenticed to a pharmacist in Tunbridge Wells, he developed an interest in botany. He subsequently studied medicine at King&#x27;s College London, and became a Member of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1847 and a Fellow of the Linnean Society of London in 1849. 

Bentley served as botany lecturer at the Medical School of the London Hospital, and in 1859 became Professor of Botany at King&#x27;s College London. 

In 1874, Bentley was elected a Fellow of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain, and he served as joint editor of the &quot;British Pharmacopeia&quot; of 1885.

Bentley died at his home in Warwick Road, Kensington, on 24 December 1893, and was buried at Kensal Green cemetery.

==Books by Bentley==

* &quot;A Manual of Botany: including the structure, functions, classification, properties, and uses of plants, etc.&quot; (1861), at Google Books

<text>South Korean web culture indicates distinct activities that South Korean Internet users enjoy on the web. Synonyms include cyberculture, technoculture, virtual community culture, post-human culture, and high tech culture. Cyberculture in South Korea is more like a virtual community culture than anything else. Most of the Internet users are in the 13–50 age range. People often access the Internet through cyber cafes (Korean: PC방; PC bang).

Most of the activities are targeted to teenagers and college students. Youngsters who feel more comfortable texting than talking are known as the &quot;thumb tribe&quot;. The LG Mobile World Cup, an international competition held on January 14, 2010, in which participants competed using their texting speed and accuracy was won by a pair of South Koreans.

Highly urbanized at 92%, South Koreans lead a distinctive urban lifestyle; half of them live in high-rises concentrated in the Seoul Capital Area with 25 million residents. The rise of online social activities closely mirrors the wider cultural trend towards shared spaces, such as the habitual use of coffee houses.

South Korea enjoys the world&#x27;s swiftest Internet speeds and the highest rate of Internet penetration but also suffers from very high censorship of content. Internet culture is particularly prominent in South Korea with its influence of video games, video content, and streaming services.

== Major activities ==
=== Video games as spectator sports ===
Video games and the watching of video games is very popular. South Korea leads the world in video games as spectator sports.

Blizzard entered into a co-marketing agreement with Korean Air that lasted for six months, in which two of the airline&#x27;s airplanes on both domestic and international routes prominently displayed &quot;StarCraft II&quot; advertising featuring Jim Raynor on the fuselage.

This popularity has led to a natural rise in popular commentators on web games as part of the wider blogging community. 

It is noted that South Korea served as a significant influence in the development of esports internationally. The creation of the Korea e-Sports Association (KeSPA) in October 2003 was the first esports association in the world. This organization put into practice various regulations and foundations as well as promoted competitive esports leagues. In further expansion of esports across Korea, the Korean Air Force established a military affiliate esports team called Air Force Challenges e-Sports (ACE). This allowed those serving their required military time to explore esports as a career.

=== Blog (블로그) ===
Just like other countries, blogging is also popular in South Korea. Post topics range from personal reflections on philosophical conjectures to simple everyday life stories. Some of the popular Korean blog hosting websites include Naver Blog, Egloos, Blogin (defunct), Daum Blog, Yahoo! Korea Blog, Tistory, and Textcube.com (defunct). Two major portals for online communities in South Korea are Daum and Naver. Both operate as open public forums, or cafés, hosting a wide range of discussion topics—from entertainment, idols, and popular culture to more serious subjects like family, education, politics, and religion.

=== Instant messaging (메신저) ===
In Korea, the most popular online messengers include NateOn, KakaoTalk, MSN Messenger, BuddyBuddy, Sayclub Tachy and more. NateOn is known to have surpassed the usage share of MSN, now claiming the most number of users among messengers used in Korea.

=== Q&amp;A ===

Some search engine websites also provide &quot;knowledge searches&quot;, which is an answer to a question that has been asked by another search engine user. For example, in Naver Knowledge iN registered users can post a question on any topic of their choice. Some users ask very personal questions pertaining to relationships and the like, since the user&#x27;s real identity is not exposed.

When various users answer a question they are awarded a certain number of points, the person who asked the question can then select the best answer and will be awarded points. This user can then ask questions on the website using the points that he/she was awarded. The users with most points are ranked daily with the option to display their real identities, if they choose to do so.

Unlike Wikipedia, Q&amp;A promotes a very active community based atmosphere for questions and answers.

===Webtoons===

&quot;Webtoon&quot; (Hangul: 웹툰, RR: &quot;wep-tun&quot;) is a South Korean webcomic, or manhwa that is published online. The Korean web portal Daum created a webtoon service in 2003, as did Naver in 2004. These services regularly release webtoons that are available for free. According to David Welsh of Bloomberg, comics account for a quarter of all book sales in South Korea, while more than 3 million Korean users paid to access online manhwa and 10 million users read free webcomics.

, Naver had published 520 webtoons while Daum had published 434. Since the early 2010s, services such as Tapastic and Line Webtoon have begun to officially translate webtoons into English. Examples of popular webtoons that have been translated into English are &quot;The Breaker&quot;, &quot;Girls of the Wild&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;The Gamer&quot;, &quot;Noblesse&quot;, &quot;The God of High School&quot;, and &quot;Tower of God&quot;. In recent years, these webtoons have been gaining popularity in Western markets, rivalling Japanese manga.

As digital comics have emerged as a popular medium, print publication of manhwa has decreased. The amount of material published in webtoon form has now reached an equal amount as that published offline.

===Bitcoin trading===
As bitcoin trading and virtual money trading are gaining popularity in South Korea, buzzwords related with these trading are getting popular on SNS and other communities. 
* GAZUA (가즈아) - is kind of a magic word. People say it when they want express their hope that bitcoin&#x27;s price goes up to their expectation. literally it means &#x27;Go&#x27;. People started using this word in real world.
* Jonber (존버) - word represent &#x27;Do not sell the coin till price goes high&#x27;
* Yeongcha Yeongcha (영차영차) - The sound that many people put together to strengthen their energy. People use this word as a hope to increase price of virtual cash.

=== Online video ===
South Koreans appear to be avid users of online video with thousands watching online stars doing everyday things like eating. This phenomenon known as Mukbang became widely popular across the internet. This form of entertainment served as a channel of connectedness, fulfillment of multi-sensory experiences, or simply performative display for viewers to enjoy.

South Korea has become something of a cultural giant exporting music (K-pop) through web-based viral success. A notable worldwide success from this approach is Gangnam Style and by September 2012 entered the Guinness World Records as the most &quot;liked&quot; video on YouTube.

=== Internet Communities ===
Internet communities can be referred as the nests of cyberculture in South Korea. Hit-cyberculture on internet communities often permeate even offline. A field of language is the most remarkable field. Internet communities lead this language trend in South Korea. Even though there are countless internet communities, there are some communities to see thoroughly. Each internet community has different interests and different people gather at different community sites. So, their atmosphere and the cyberculture that they produce and consume are different from each other.
# DC inside - DC inside has an internet community has many forums (a.k.a. gallery) for different interests. This community was organized as community of interest for cameras and sharing photographs for amateur photographers at first, but its purpose was changed to Internet community. There are forums about almost everything. People who have same interest can discuss it on DC inside. In this process, many cybercultures are produced and consumed. 
# Todayhumor - Todayhumor is a popular Korean internet forum. Originally dedicated just to humor, it has since grown to encapsulate various different topics and interests. It is widely used, ranking as the most popular Korean internet community in 2014. Its users tend to be left-leaning politically, which generates some controversy for the website during election seasons.
# Diesel Mania - Diesel Mania is an online community catering to those interested in substitution for purchasing Diesel Jean and True religion. The biggest male-fashion community in South Korea. This community has real-name policy. Because of it, this community&#x27;s issues are less rather than other communities. 
These differences between communities makes cyberculture in South Korea diverse.

==== NAMU Wiki ====

The Angel Halo wiki, the predecessor of the NAMU Wiki, was founded on March 1, 2007. It specialized in animation, comics, and Internet neologism. It was popular because of its unique narrative method of mixing jokes such as puns, and various people continued to write for it making it bigger. It changed its name to the Liga Vedic wiki in 2012. However, it became one of the alternative wikis forking this wiki when it became impossible to operate due to the debacle of the League Vedic wiki operator privatizing wikis, and it was made up as a separate site that backed up about 90% of the League Vedic wiki documents. After the privatization of the League Vedai Wiki, most of the League Vedic Wiki users have become NAMU Wiki and Libre Wiki users. 
As of March 13, 2017, NAMU Wiki outperformed the Korean Wikipedia in that NAMU Wiki ranked 11th on the list of popular websites in Korea while Korean Wiki ranked 33rd, and Google Search, which reflects user preferences. As causative factors of the wiki&#x27;s popular, the B-list language used in the NAMU wiki was filled with jokes, such as puns, and people responded to the preference of the users who liked the flimsy stories rather than the hard explanations. Also, it is analyzed that the size of the Korean version of Wikipedia is smaller than other language versions and the lack of content makes the NAMU wiki more popular.

=== Social media ===

Social media has been instrumental in the global reach of K-pop, particularly video-sharing site YouTube. Of the 2.28 billion worldwide K-pop YouTube views in 2011, 240 million came from the United States, more than double the figure from 2010 (94 million).

=== Streaming Platforms ===
Many cyberculture are produced on internet streams. There are many contents such as Mukbang, gaming, and visible radio in streaming platforms. stream Jockey(BJ) try to make their own streams&#x27; atmosphere and sometimes it would be a new cyberculture. Communication between the streamer and real-time viewer is one of the most important things in a stream. In this process, culture can be created and this immediately surfaces and quickly transmitted in Internet communities.

Live streaming has been integrated in South Korea’s as a form of public communication and as a rising full-time career. It became widely accepted for its convenient participatory aspect between the hosts and user. The most popular live-streaming platforms include YouTube, Twitch, and Afreeca TV. Live streaming has been used as one of the first lines of communication for political news and popular culture influence. Due to its real time nature, live streaming content is less likely to be edited or manipulated allowing the audience to feel more connected. In 2017, former President Park Geun Hye live streamed her first interview on YouTube regarding her scandal.

=== Virtual community ===
In Korea, there&#x27;s many virtual communities like Daum Cafe, Naver Cafe, etc..

=== Cyworld (싸이월드) ===
&quot;Cyworld&quot; is a hybrid between a blog and personal homepage. Although its primary prevalence is found in Korea, its influence has spread over China in recent years. &quot;Cyworld&quot; users range anywhere from elementary students to middle-aged adults.

&quot;Cyworld&quot; requires a person&#x27;s real identity (Koreans: verified by Korean national identification number (주민등록번호); Foreigners: scanned school/state ID, driver&#x27;s license, or passport) to become a member. Since all identity is usually truthful and non-anonymous, users often use this to seek lost friends from childhood or former classmates on the website, or make and progress their friendship by system that called by &#x27;mini-homepage (minihompy, 미니홈피)&#x27;.

Similar to blogs, many people share their thoughts and photos that other friends (called 일촌, il-chon) can comment on. A typical &#x27;mini-homepage&#x27; features a main page, a photographic album, a guest book, and a personal diary. Users are given many choices for personalizing their pages with music, backgrounds, and even fonts. One of the major differences between &quot;Cyworld&quot; and blogs is that &quot;Cyworld&quot; is optimized for the users who prefer to write very short and succinct diaries. One popular personalized feature is the &#x27;mini-room (미니룸)&#x27;, where a user is given a single rectangular room to decorate with different objects. These objects (as well as personalized features) are bought with online dollars called &quot;dotori&quot; (acorn, in English). Every user is given a &#x27;mini-me (미니미)&#x27;, a caricature. Although each user is given a prototype, gender-appropriate figure, they liberally personalize these figures with a variety of dress and hairstyle options.

Because the website contains mostly truthful information, social issues have been raised such as Cyber-bullying.

==Web page usability==

Most Korean webpages (such as weather, search engine Naver and news) incorporate Flash and images, preferably animated. Often text is substituted with images in such a way that in order to copy and/or translate it visitor has to type it manually or, in the best case, take it from alternate text of the image. The impression is that widespread broadband created a stimulus for web developers to write overly complex and rich web-pages, which can even make the browser work slowly (when about twenty pages are opened at once). At the same time, the webpages can sometimes in one aspect or the other deviate from standard: Naver is too narrow on some screens, some pages throw several pop-ups at the user, introduction on Korean website because it&#x27;s all in images, etc..

== Criticism ==
Many of the online security breaches in South Korea seem to stem from a common use of comparatively outdated browsers and security software.

There is occasional criticism claiming that foreign websites are significantly slower than South-Korean websites, for example websites for video streaming. This is a common problem in any country trying to communicate over foreign waters, since the latency in transcontinental communication is higher due to the physical distance that the signal has to travel.

<doc id="786732" wikidata="Q362902" url="?curid=786732" title="Arnaldo Tamayo Méndez">
<text>Arnaldo Tamayo Méndez (born 29 January 1942) is a Cuban military officer, legislator, and former cosmonaut and the first person of African heritage in space. In 1980, as a member of the crew of Soyuz 38, he became the first Cuban citizen, the first Latin American, the first person of African descent, and the first person from a country in the Western Hemisphere other than the United States to travel into Earth orbit.

==Early life and military service==
Tamayo was born on 29 January 1942, in Baracoa, Guantánamo province, into a family of Afro-Cuban descent. Orphaned as an infant, he was adopted at age 1 by Rafael Tamayo and Esperanza Méndez. He began working at age 13 as a shoeshine and vegetable vendor and later worked as a carpenter&#x27;s assistant.

During the Cuban Revolution he joined the Association of Young Rebels, a group protesting the Batista regime, and later the Revolutionary Work Youth Brigades. After the Cuban Revolution, he entered the Technical Institute &quot;Rebel Army&quot;, completing a course for aviation technicians in December 1960. Wishing to become a fighter pilot, he went on to join the Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces. Between April 1961 and May 1962, Tamayo completed a course in aerial combat with MiG-15s at the Yeysk Higher Air Force School in the Soviet Union, after which he was certified a combat pilot at the age of 19. Later that year, during the Cuban Missile Crisis, he flew 20 reconnaissance missions as part of the Playa Girón Brigade of the Cuban Revolutionary Air and Air Defense Force.

In 1967, Tamayo joined the Communist Party of Cuba and spent the next two years serving with Cuban forces in the Vietnam War, returning in 1969 to study at the Maximo Gomez Basic College of the Revolutionary Forces until 1971.

In 1975, he was made Chief of Staff of the Santa Clara Aviation Brigade and was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel the following year. In 1978 he was selected to join the Intercosmos program and moved to Star City, Russia for his training as a cosmonaut.

==Intercosmos program==
Tamayo was selected as part of the Soviet Union&#x27;s seventh Intercosmos program on 1 March 1978. His backup in the Intercosmos program was fellow Cuban José López Falcón. Tamayo would spend the next two and a half years in training for the mission.

Tamayo, along with Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Romanenko, was launched into space aboard Soyuz 38 from Baikonur Cosmodrome on 18 September 1980, at 19:11 UTC. After docking with Salyut 6, Tamayo and Romanenko conducted experiments in an attempt to find what caused space adaptation syndrome (SAS), and perhaps even find a cure, and on the crystallisation of sucrose in microgravity, for the benefit of Cuba&#x27;s sugar industry. The SAS experiment involved wearing special adjustable shoes that placed a load on the arch of the foot for six hours a day. After 124 orbits of the Earth (lasting 7 days, 20 hours and 43 minutes), Tamayo and Romanenko landed from Dzhezkazgan. The landing was risky, as it was at night. 

Upon his return to Earth he was decorated with the Hero of the Republic of Cuba medal, the first person to be so honored. In Moscow he received the Order of Lenin and was also named a Hero of the Soviet Union.

==Personal life==
Following his time in the Intercosmos program, Tamayo was made Director of the Military Patriotic Educational Society known as &quot;Sociedad de Educación Patriótico-Militar&quot; &quot;SEPMI&quot;. After his promotion to brigadier general, he became Director of International Affairs in the Cuban armed forces.

Since 1980, he has been a Deputy in the Cuban National Assembly, representing his home region of Guantánamo Province.

He has been honored by the Cuban Government for being the first Cuban, the first Caribbean, and the first Latin American to go into orbit. He was awarded the titles of Hero of the Republic of Cuba and the Order of Playa Girón. He also is a recipient of the Hero of the Soviet Union award.

Tamayo is married and has two daughters and a son. 

His space suit is preserved at the Museum of the Revolution in Havana.

<text>Rodger Morris Ward (January 10, 1921 – July 5, 2004) was an American racing driver best known for his open-wheel career. He is generally regarded as one of the finest drivers of his generation, and is best known for winning two National Championships, and two Indianapolis 500s, both in 1959 and 1962. He also won the AAA National Stock Car Championship in 1951.

== Early life ==

Ward was born in Beloit, Kansas, the son of Ralph and Geneva (née Banta) Ward. By 1930, the family had moved to California. He died in Anaheim, California.

Ward&#x27;s father owned an auto wrecking business in Los Angeles. Rodger was 14 years old when he built a Ford hot rod. He was a P-38 Lightning fighter pilot in World War II. He enjoyed flying so much he thought of making it his career. He began to fly B-17 Flying Fortress and was so good he was retained as an instructor. After the war he was stationed in Wichita Falls, Texas when a quarter mile dirt track was built.

== Driving career ==

=== Midget car career ===

Ward began racing midget cars in 1946 after he was discharged from the Army. He finished poorly. His skills improved in 1947 and by 1948 he won the San Diego Grand Prix. He raced in an Offenhauser in 1949 and won several races.

Ward shocked the midget car racing world when he broke Offenhauser motor&#x27;s long winning streak by using Vic Edelbrock&#x27;s Ford 60 &quot;shaker&quot; motor at Gilmore Stadium on August 10, 1950. The motor was one of the first to feature nitromethane for fuel. Ward and Edelbrock went to the Orange Show Stadium the following night and won again.

Ward drove Ken Brenn&#x27;s Offy midget July 25, 1959 to beat the top expensive and exotic sports cars in a Formula Libre race at Lime Rock Park. Midget cars were normally considered competitive for oval tracks only before that time. Later that year, Ward entered the United States Grand Prix for Formula One cars with the midget car, under the false belief that it was much quicker through the turns, a fact he found not true at the beginning of practice. He eventually retired from the race after twenty laps with a mechanical failure.

=== Stock Car career ===

Ward participated in the AAA and later USAC Stock Car divisions. He started no less than 66 races, winning seven, and finishing in the top-five no less than 29 times. He won the AAA National Stock Car title in 1951.

=== Championship car career ===

Ward&#x27;s AAA Stock Car championship gave him an opportunity for a rookie test at the 1951 Indianapolis 500. He passed the test and qualified for the race. He finished 34 laps before his car suffered a broken oil line. He finished 130 laps in the 1952 Indianapolis 500 before the oil pressure failed. His 1953 Indianapolis 500 ended after 170 laps, and his 1954 Indianapolis 500 ended after his car stalled on the backstretch. He completed all of the laps for the first time in 1956, finishing eighth.

In 1959 he joined the Leader Card Racers team with owner Bob Wilke and mechanic A. J. Watson; forming what was known as the &quot;3 W&#x27;s&quot;. Ward won his first Indianapolis 500. He won the USAC National Championship with victories at Milwaukee, DuQuoin and the Indy Fairgrounds. His 1959 season ended by competing in the only United States Grand Prix held at Sebring Raceway.

Ward battled Jim Rathmann for the lead in the 1960 Indianapolis 500. In one of the epic duels in Indy 500 history, Ward and Rathmann exchanged the lead 14 times before Ward slowed on lap 197 to nurse his frayed right front tire to the finish. Rathmann, also struggling with worn-out tires after such a furious pace, took the lead on lap 197 and the two drivers limped home in what is still regarded as one of the greatest duels for the win in Indianapolis 500 history.

Ward took the lead at the 1962 Indianapolis 500 at lap 126 and led the rest of the race. He also won the season championship that year.

In the midst of the Lotus-Ford rear-engine invasion in 1964, car owner/chief mechanic A.J. Watson built the first rear-engined Watson, mated to the four-cam Ford. But the night before the 1964 Indianapolis 500, Ward and Watson made a highly uncharacteristic strategic error. Going against the strong recommendation (read: orders) from Ford to use gasoline fuel instead of the cooler-burning but more powerful methanol/gasoline. The car was fast, but the jetting mistake left Ward having to pit every 20 laps for fuel. Later Ward calculated that he had spent two minutes less on the track than winner A.J. Foyt, yet only lost the race by approximately 1 minute.

In addition, the horrific second-lap accident, in which his friends Dave MacDonald and Eddie Sachs both perished in a fiery, gasoline-fueled wreck, left an indelible impression on Ward. After a difficult month of May, 1965, Ward suffered the embarrassment of failing to qualify. Ward left the Leader Card team mid-season and joined Mecom Racing team owned by John W. Mecom Jr. In 1966 Ward won the second race of the season at Trenton driving a supercharged Offy powered Lola.

For his Indianapolis 500 effort Ward drove the same car but retired while running 15th with handling problems listed as the cause. The fact that late race attrition reduced the race to only five cars would have provided him a good finish as long as he was running and in fact he had been faster than the winner. Ward had parked a running car 74 laps into the race and was considering his future. At the banquet, Ward stood at the podium and made a painful announcement to the crowd: &quot;I always said I&#x27;d quit racing when it stopped being fun,&quot; he said. He paused as he wiped away tears. &quot;Today it wasn&#x27;t fun anymore.&quot; He had 26 victories in his 150 starts between 1950 and 1966, and he finished in the top ten in more than half of his starts.

=== World Drivers&#x27; Championship career ===

The AAA/USAC-sanctioned Indianapolis 500 was included in the FIA World Drivers&#x27; Championship from 1950 through 1960. Drivers competing at Indianapolis during those years were credited with World Drivers&#x27; Championship points and participation in addition to those which they received towards the AAA/USAC National Championship.

Ward participated in ten World Drivers&#x27; Championship races at Indianapolis. He was also among a small number of USAC/Indianapolis drivers to start an FIA-sanctioned World Drivers&#x27; Championship event during the 1950-1960 period - competing for Leader Card Racers in the 1959 United States Grand Prix.

Ward also participated in the 1963 United States Grand Prix. During his World Drivers&#x27; Championship career, Ward won once, finished in the top three twice, and accumulated 14 World Drivers&#x27; Championship points.

== Post-racing career ==

Ward retired to be a commentator for ABC&#x27;s &quot;Wide World of Sports&quot; for NASCAR and Indycars from 1965 to 1970. From 1980-1985, he served as a driver expert for the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Radio Network, before retiring in Tustin, California. With the help of the Mattioli Family, Ward helped design the Pocono Raceway in Long Pond, Pennsylvania. A unique course that resulted in a triangle shape, he designed the track after five corners of tracks he liked to race at, Trenton, Indianapolis, and Milwaukee. The track is still popular today.

In later years, he served as public relations director for the new Ontario Motor Speedway, and later managed the Circus Circus unlimited hydroplane team. He died on July 5, 2004, aged 83.

Ward also appeared on the TV show &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot; in 1962.

== Awards and honors ==

Ward has been inducted into the following halls of fame:
* Auto Racing Hall of Fame (1981)
* International Motorsports Hall of Fame (1992)
* Motorsports Hall of Fame of America (1995)
* National Midget Auto Racing Hall of Fame (1995)

<doc id="786751" wikidata="Q1751305" url="?curid=786751" title="Accrued interest">
<text>In finance, accrued interest is the interest on a bond or loan that has accumulated since the principal investment, or since the previous coupon payment if there has been one already.

For a type of obligation such as a bond, interest is calculated and paid at set intervals (for instance annually or semi-annually). However ownership of bonds/loans can be transferred between different investors at any time, not just on an interest payment date. After such a transfer, the new owner will usually receive the next interest payment, but the previous owner must be compensated for the period of time for which he or she owned the bond. In other words, the previous owner must be paid the interest that accrued before the sale. This is generally done in one of two ways, depending on market convention:

# In addition to the quoted price, the buyer pays the seller an additional amount equal to the interest accrued up to the date of sale, &quot;or&quot;
# That adjustment is not made, but the value of the accrued interest is simply reflected in a higher quoted sale price.

On the other hand, if the sale is made during a short set period immediately before the next interest payment, then the seller, not the buyer, will receive the interest payment from the issuer of the loan (the borrower), and

# The buyer pays the seller &quot;less than&quot; the quoted price, the difference reflecting the interest accruing between the sale date and the next interest payment date, &quot;or&quot;
# That adjustment is not made, but the value of the interest to be accrued is simply reflected in a lower quoted sale price.
== Accounting ==
In accounting, accrual-based accounting generally requires (in order to present a true and fair view) that accrued interest is computed and recorded at the end of each accounting period, perhaps by means of adjusting journal entries. This enables the accrued interest to be included in the lender&#x27;s balance sheet as an asset (and in the borrower&#x27;s balance sheet as a provision or liability). However if the accounts use the market price as derived by method 2 above, then such an adjustment for accrued interest is not necessary, as it has already been included in the market price.

== Formula ==

The primary formula for calculating the interest accrued in a given period is:

formula_1

where formula_2 is the accrued interest, formula_3 is the fraction of the year, formula_4 is the principal, and formula_5 is the annualized interest rate.

formula_3 is usually calculated as follows:

formula_7

where formula_8 is the number of days in the period, and formula_9 is the number of days in the year.

The main variables that affect the calculation are the period between interest payments and the day count convention used to determine the fraction of year, and the date rolling convention in use.

<text>Rudolf Beran (28 December 1887 – 23 April 1954) was a Czechoslovak politician who served as prime minister of the country before its occupation by Nazi Germany and shortly thereafter, before it was declared a protectorate. A leader of the Agrarian Party from 1933, he was appointed prime minister by President Emil Hácha on 1 December 1938.

Beran was somewhat ambivalent toward democracy. In the hope of appeasing the Germans after the Munich Agreement, he gathered most of the nonsocialist parties in the Czech lands into the Party of National Unity, with himself as its leader. He also subjected the press to tough censorship, but he presided over granting the Slovaks and Ruthenians&#x27; longstanding demands for autonomy. None of the measures was enough to prevent Slovakia from seceding on 14 March, or Germany from occupying the remainder of the country a day later. He then served as the first prime minister of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia until his retirement on 27 April 1939. After he retired, he settled on his farm. During World War II, he had contacts with members of the Czech resistance.

He was arrested in May 1941 by the Germans and spent years in various concentration camps. While he was in custody of the Gestapo in Prague, he had to answer several written questions submitted to him by K.H. Frank, Hitler&#x27;s &quot;Staatsminister&quot; of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. 

After the war, Beran was arrested as a collaborator by the Communist authorities, and in a manipulated political trial was sentenced to twenty years in prison. He died in Leopoldov Prison in 1954.

<doc id="786840" wikidata="Q3304336" url="?curid=786840" title="1975 Atlantic hurricane season">
<text>The 1975 Atlantic hurricane season was a near average hurricane season with nine named storms forming, of which six became hurricanes. Three of those six became major hurricanes, which are Category 3 ( sustained winds) or higher systems on the Saffir–Simpson scale. The season officially began on June 1 and lasted until November 30. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic Ocean.

The first system, Tropical Depression One, developed on June 24. Tropical Storm Amy in July caused minor beach erosion and coastal flooding from North Carolina to New Jersey, and killed one person when a ship capsized offshore North Carolina. Hurricane Blanche brought strong winds to portions of Atlantic Canada, leaving about $6.2 million (1975 USD) in damage. Hurricane Caroline brought high tides and flooding to northeastern Mexico and Texas, with two drownings in the latter.

The most significant storm of the season was Hurricane Eloise, a Category 3 hurricane that struck the Florida Panhandle at peak intensity, after bringing severe flooding to the Caribbean. Eloise caused 80 fatalities, including 34 in Puerto Rico, 7 in Dominican Republic, 18 in Haiti, and 21 in the United States, with 4 in Florida. The hurricane left about $560 million in damage in the United States. Hurricane Gladys, a Category 4 hurricane, was the most intense tropical cyclone of the season, but left little impact on land. Also, it was the first tropical storm to be upgraded to a hurricane based solely on satellite imagery. Two tropical depressions also caused damage and fatalities. Collectively, the tropical cyclones of this season resulted in 87 deaths and about $564.7 million in damage. 
== Season summary ==
The Atlantic hurricane season officially began on June 1, with the first tropical cyclone developing on June 24. Although 23 tropical depressions developed, only nine of them reached tropical storm intensity; this was near normal compared to the 1950–2000 average of 9.6 named storms. Six of these reached hurricane status, slightly above the 1950–2000 average of 5.9. Furthermore, three storms reached major hurricane status; above the 1950–2000 average of 2.3. Collectively, the cyclones of this season caused at least 84 deaths and over $564.7 million in damage. The Atlantic hurricane season officially ended on November 30, though the final cyclone became extratropical on December 13.

Tropical cyclogenesis began in June, with the development of a tropical depression on June 24, followed by Tropical Storm Amy on June 27. Four systems originated in July, including Hurricane Blanche. After Tropical Depression Six dissipated on July 30, tropical activity went dormant for over three weeks, ending with the development of Hurricane Caroline on August 24. Another cyclone, Hurricane Doris, also formed in August. September was the most active month of the season, featuring eight tropical cyclones, including hurricanes Eloise, Faye, and Gladys. In October, four systems formed, one of which intensified into Tropical Storm Hallie. Two tropical depressions developed in November. The last system, a subtropical storm, formed on December 6 and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on December 13.

The season&#x27;s activity was reflected with an accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 76. Broadly speaking, ACE is a measure of the power of a tropical storm multiplied by the length of time it existed. Therefore, a storm with a longer duration will have high values of ACE. It is only calculated for full advisories on specific tropical and subtropical systems reaching or exceeding wind speeds of . Accordingly, tropical depressions are not included here. After the storm has dissipated, typically after the end of the season, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) reexamines the data. These revisions can lead to a revised ACE total either upward or downward compared to the operational value.

== Systems ==

=== Tropical Storm Amy ===
A trough of low pressure developed into a tropical depression while just north of Grand Bahama on June 27. The depression headed generally northward and remained weak. Upon nearing the coast of the Carolinas, the depression turned sharply eastward ahead of a rapidly approaching trough. Early on June 29, the system intensified into Tropical Storm Amy offshore North Carolina. Further intensification occurred and the storm reached its peak intensity with winds of and a barometric pressure of by July 2. During most of the storm&#x27;s existence, Amy featured many subtropical characteristics – both tropical and extratropical characteristics – but was not classified as such due to the proximity to land. By July 4, the system moved southeast of Newfoundland before becoming extratropical. The remnants continued rapidly northeastward and soon dissipated.

The main effects from Amy were rough seas, reaching up to in height, that were felt from North Carolina to New Jersey, inflicting minor coastal flooding and beach erosion. The storm also brought generally light rainfall to land, peaking at in Belhaven, North Carolina. Offshore North Carolina, a schooner carrying four people capsized on June 30, resulting in the death of the father of the other three crew members. They remained at sea for roughly 15 days before being rescued by a Greek merchant ship.
=== Hurricane Blanche ===

A tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic Ocean from the west coast of Africa on July 14. The system remained weak for about a week, before convection began increasing significantly on July 21. After wind shear decreased, the wave managed to develop into a tropical depression on July 24 about northeast of the Turks and Caicos Islands. It moved northwestward until early on July 26, when an approaching cold front and associated trough caused the depression to turn northeastward. Around that time, the cyclone intensified into Tropical Storm Blanche. A weakening cold front and baroclinic forces created an environment favorable for intensifying, allowing Blanche to become a Category 1 hurricane on July 27. Slightly further deepening occurred, with the storm peaking with winds of and a minimum barometric pressure of . Before 12:00 UTC on July 28, Blanche made landfall in Barrington, Nova Scotia, with winds of . The system quickly transitioned into an extratropical cyclone, which soon dissipated.

In Atlantic Canada, the remnants of Blanche produced high winds gusts up to , along with moderate rainfall, peaking at in Chatham, New Brunswick. The strong winds knocked over two mobile homes and destroyed a slaughterhouse, which was under construction. Additionally, trees and power lines were downed, leaving between 500 and 1,000 customers without electricity. The electrical corporation in Nova Scotia suffered about $196,600 in damage. Telephone services were also interrupted. The A. Murray MacKay Bridge was closed after an oil rig broke loose and threatened to strike the bridge. In Prince Edward Island, flights to and from the Charlottetown Airport were canceled, as was ferry service to Nova Scotia. In the province, many homes and businesses lost telephone service. Overall, damage in Canada reached about $6.2 million.
=== Tropical Depression Six ===
Tropical Depression Six developed from a trough of low pressure in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico about southwest of Cape San Blas, Florida, on July 27. The depression moved west-northwestward and strengthened slightly to reach winds of , but remained below tropical storm intensity and made landfall in eastern Louisiana. Once inland, the depression slowly weakened and re-curved northwestward on July 30 into Mississippi. Around that time, the depression dissipated. The remnants persisted at least until August 3, at which time it was situated over Arkansas.

The tropical depression dropped heavy rainfall, with some areas of the Florida Panhandle experiencing more than of precipitation, with a maximum total of observed in DeFuniak Springs. Bay, Gulf, Holmes, Okaloosa, Santa Rosa, Wakulla, and Walton were hardest hit. Numerous roads were flooded and closed, with $3.2 million in damage to that infrastructure. About 500 homes suffered flood damage, 22 of which were destroyed. Damage is estimated to have reached $8.5 million in the state of Florida alone. In southern Alabama, overflowing rivers flooded several businesses and homes in Brewton and East Brewton. Damage in Alabama totaled approximately $300,000. In Mississippi, about 50 families in the vicinity of the Biloxi River were evacuated as the river threatened to exceed its banks, while at least 70 families fled their homes in Moss Point. Water entered about a dozen homes there. Further north, about 100 residences were evacuated in Canton, where some businesses suffered water damage. A total of 12 homes in Vicksburg were flooded. The storm left three fatalities, with two in Florida and one in Alabama.
=== Hurricane Caroline ===
A tropical wave that emerged into the Atlantic from the west coast of Africa on August 15 developed into a tropical depression about north of Hispaniola on August 24. The depression moved west-southwestward and failed to intensify before crossing the Turks and Caicos Islands and making landfall along the northern coast in eastern Cuba on August 25. After emerging into the Caribbean Sea, the cyclone headed west-northwestward beginning on August 27. By the following day, the depression entered into the Gulf of Mexico after passing just offshore the Yucatán Peninsula. The system then intensified into Tropical Storm Caroline early on August 29 and hurricane by 00:00 UTC the following day. Further strengthening occurred, with the storm peaking as a Category 3 hurricane with winds of and a minimum pressure of early on August 31. Around that time, Caroline made landfall in a rural area of Tamaulipas, located in northeastern Mexico. The system rapidly weakened and dissipated on September 1.

In Mexico, the storm produced storm tides along the coast, while of rain fell inland. Flooding rains forced 1,000 people to evacuate and left moderate damage to homes and businesses. The precipitation ended an eight-month drought that was affecting inland portions of northern Mexico and decreasing the area&#x27;s corn production. Along the coast, several small villages sustained significant damage from the hurricane&#x27;s storm surge. Portions of south Texas also experienced heavy rainfall, with at Port Isabel. Brownsville broke a record for the highest amount of precipitation observed on a day in August. Two deaths occurred from drowning in Galveston.
=== Hurricane Doris ===

A low pressure area developed within a frontal band over the central Atlantic on August 27. At 12:00 UTC on the following day, the system developed into a subtropical storm while situated southwest of the Azores. The subtropical classification was due to the lack of a central dense overcast (CDO), with the showers and thunderstorms mainly consisting of a strong band of convention located southeast of the center, as well as its association to the frontal band. Because the system was out of the authorized range of reconnaissance aircraft flights, satellites and ships were used to monitor the storm&#x27;s intensity and tropical status. After satellite imagery indicated that the system became more symmetrical, developed CDO, and detached from the frontal system, the cyclone was reclassified as Tropical Storm Doris on August 29.

Doris made meteorological history when, on August 31, it became the first Atlantic hurricane ever to be upgraded to hurricane intensity solely on the basis of satellite pictures, via the Dvorak technique. The cyclone then curved northward and intensified further during the next few days, becoming a Category 2 hurricane early on September 2. Based on the Dvorak technique, it is estimated that Doris peaked with maximum sustained winds of and a minimum barometric pressure of shortly thereafter. By September 3, the hurricane began interacting with a non-tropical low pressure area. On the following day, Doris quickly weakened to a tropical storm and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone about south-southeast of Cape Race, Newfoundland, around 06:00 UTC. The extratropical remnants weakened and then dissipated late on September 4.
=== Hurricane Eloise ===
A tropical wave developed into a tropical depression on September 13 to the east of the Virgin Islands. The system tracked westward and strengthened into Tropical Storm Eloise while passing to the north of Puerto Rico. Eloise briefly reached hurricane intensity soon thereafter, but weakened back to a tropical storm around landfall over Hispaniola. The cyclone emerged into open waters of the northern Caribbean Sea. After striking the northern Yucatán Peninsula, Eloise turned northward and re-intensified. In the Gulf of Mexico, the cyclone quickly deepened, becoming a Category 3 hurricane on September 23. The hurricane made landfall west of Panama City, Florida, before moving inland across Alabama and dissipating on September 24.

The storm produced heavy rainfall throughout Puerto Rico and Hispaniola, causing extensive flooding that left severe damage 59 fatalities. Thousands of people in these areas became homeless as flood waters submerged numerous communities. As Eloise progressed westward, it affected Cuba to a lesser extent. In advance of the storm, about 100,000 residents evacuated from the Gulf Coast region. Upon making landfall in Florida, Eloise generated wind gusts of , which demolished hundreds of buildings in the area. The storm&#x27;s severe winds, waves, and storm surge left numerous beaches, piers, and other coastal structures heavily impaired.

Wind-related damage extended into inland Alabama and Georgia. Further north, torrential rains along the entire East Coast of the United States created an unprecedented and far-reaching flooding event, especially into the Mid-Atlantic States. In that region, an additional 17 people died as a result of freshwater flooding from the post-tropical storm; infrastructural and geological effects were comparable to those from Hurricane Agnes three years prior. Across the United States, damage amounted to approximately $560 million. The storm killed 80 people along its entire track.
=== Hurricane Faye ===

A tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic from the west coast of Africa on September 14. After detaching from the Intertropical Convergence Zone on September 18, the wave quickly developed into a tropical depression about west of the Cabo Verde Islands. Moving northwestward, the depression intensified, according to ships and satellite imagery, becoming Tropical Storm Faye on September 19. The cyclone then moved westward and was unable to intensify further due to increasing wind shear, before weakening to a tropical depression on September 23. Shortly thereafter, Faye turned to the north, crossing an upper trough axis over the central Atlantic. Southwesterly flow aloft allowed the system to re-strengthen, with Faye becoming a tropical storm again on September 25. Faye accelerated to the northwest and deepened into a Category 1 hurricane early on September 26, several hours before reaching Category 2 intensity.

Around 23:00 UTC on September 26, the cyclone passed about east of Bermuda. Winds up to and heavy rains were recorded on the island. Up to of rain fell in Bermuda from the hurricane. Already severely impacted by flooding from Eloise days earlier, New England prepared for additional flooding from Faye. The National Weather Service issued flash flood watches, resulting in more evacuations. At 00:00 UTC on September 27, the hurricane reached its maximum sustained wind speed of . Later that day, Faye curved northeast under strong westerly flow. Although the system weakened to a Category 1 hurricane late on September 28, the storm reached its minimum barometric pressure of , observed by a reconnaissance aircraft. Faye then curved eastward and lost tropical characteristics, becoming extratropical at 12:00 UTC on September 29, while situated northwest of Corvo Island in the Azores.
=== Hurricane Gladys ===
A tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic from the west coast of Africa on September 17. The system developed into a tropical depression while located about southwest of the Cabo Verde Islands on September 22. Initially, the depression remained weak, but after encountering warm sea surface temperatures and low wind shear, it strengthened into Tropical Storm Gladys on September 24. Moving west-northwestward, the storm then entered a more unfavorable environment, mainly increased wind shear. Despite this, Gladys intensified into a Category 1 hurricane on September 28. Shortly thereafter, the storm reentered an area favorable for strengthening. A well-defined eye became visible on satellite imagery by September 30.

As the storm tracked to the east of the Bahamas, a curve to the north began, at which time an anticyclone developed atop the cyclone. This subsequently allowed Gladys to rapidly intensify into a Category 4 hurricane, reaching maximum sustained winds of and a minimum barometric pressure of on October 2. Thereafter, Gladys began to weaken and passed very close to Cape Race, Newfoundland, before losing tropical characteristics on October 3 while situated about northeast of St. John&#x27;s. Subsequently, the remnants merged with a large extratropical cyclone on October 3. Effects from the system along the East Coast of the United States were minimal, although heavy rainfall and rough seas were reported. In Newfoundland, strong winds and light precipitation were observed.
=== Tropical Depression Eighteen ===

A tropical depression developed in the southern Gulf of Mexico about northwest of Campeche City in Mexico on October 14. Moving around the western periphery of a subtropical ridge, the depression intensified while moving northeast towards the central Gulf Coast of the United States due to an advancing cold front. However, the depression remained below tropical storm status, peaking with maximum sustained winds of . Early on October 17, the depression made landfall near Cocodrie, Louisiana. Shortly thereafter, the depression became an extratropical cyclone as it through the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic states, before moving offshore New England.

Heavy rains fell along the frontal boundary ahead of the system, with a peak total of of precipitation observed in Aimwell, Louisiana. Flooding occurred across eastern Louisiana, central Mississippi, the western Florida Panhandle, central Tennessee, western Virginia, and eastern New York. In Jackson, Mississippi, the heavy precipitation established a new daily rainfall record for October 16 and a new 24-hour rainfall record for the month of October. Eight bridges were damaged in Jackson County, Tennessee, due to the floods. Heavy rains left heavy damage to the soybean and corn crops in Hickman and Marion counties in Tennessee. Six tornadoes were reported in association with this tropical depression, including two in Alabama, two in northwest Florida, and two in North Carolina. One person died due to flooding in Mississippi.
=== Tropical Storm Hallie ===

A frontal trough exited the East Coast of the United States on October 18. The southern portion of the system became stationary near the Bahamas; simultaneously, a cut-off upper-level low formed in the same region. The disturbance produced scattered convection, until a tropical wave merged with it on October 23. The system developed into a subtropical depression by October 24, while located about east of Florida. The depression drifted northward on October 25 and eventually acquired tropical characteristics by October 26. Due to tropical storm force winds, the system was reclassified as Tropical Storm Hallie, while situated about east of Charleston, South Carolina. Hallie accelerated to the northeast starting on October 26. By the following day, Hallie peaked with winds of . Later that day, Hallie merged with a frontal zone and became extratropical offshore Virginia.

The precursor to Hallie produced extensive cloudiness precipitation in the Bahamas.
On October 27, gale warnings were issued for portions of the Outer Banks of North Carolina, and small craft advisories were posted for coastal areas from Georgia to Virginia. Tides along the North Carolina and Virginia coasts were generally between above normal. Generally light precipitation fell, peaking at in Manteo, North Carolina. Additionally, the pressure gradient between Hallie and a high pressure area increased winds across much of the East Coast of the United States.
=== Unnamed subtropical storm ===
An extratropical low pressure system developed into a subtropical storm about east-southeast of Newfoundland, at 12:00 UTC on December 9. The storm moved rapidly southward and intensified, reaching maximum sustained winds of about 24 hours later, based on observations from an unidentified ship. Shortly thereafter, sustained winds began decreasing. However, late on December 11, the storm attained its minimum barometric pressure of . The system began moving southeastward and then eastward. By 12:00 UTC on December 12, the cyclone weakened to a subtropical depression. Moving northward, it dissipated 24 hours later, while situated about south-southwest of the Azores.
=== Other systems ===

Tropical Depression One formed on June 24, over the central Atlantic. It tracked westward for two days, before executing a counter-clockwise loop. By June 28, the system had completed the loop and was tracking north. The depression dissipated on June 29 about southeast of Sable Island, an island located southeast of Nova Scotia.

Tropical Depression Three formed northeast of the Bahamas on July 4. Tracking northeastward, the system did not intensify and was last noted over open waters midday on July 5. 

Tropical Depression Five formed on July 24 over the southwestern Gulf of Mexico. Deep convection associated with the system persisted around the center of circulation. Forecasters anticipated the depression would intensify into a tropical storm before landfall. A reconnaissance mission into the cyclone found winds; however, due to the interaction with land, the NHC did not upgrade the depression. Not long after forming, the depression struck Tampico, Tamaulipas. A barometric pressure of was recorded in the city, along with sustained winds of . The system was no longer monitored by the NHC after landfall and quickly dissipated on July 26.

On September 3, two tropical depressions developed near Cabo Verde. The westernmost, designated Tropical Depression Nine, tracked generally westward and eventually dissipated near the Lesser Antilles on September 9. The easternmost, Tropical Depression Ten, also moved westward and dissipated on September 6. Short-lived Tropical Depression Eleven developed that same day, then degenerated the next.

Tropical Depression Twelve developed near Bermuda on September 11. Initially, the depression drifted northeastward but later accelerated and dissipated by September 14.

Tropical Depression Sixteen developed near the Gulf of Honduras on September 25 and tracked slowly westward. By September 28, the depression made landfall in northern Belize before dissipating two days later. 

Tropical Depression Seventeen developed to the west of the Canary Islands on October 3, moving northwestward and then northeastward before dissipating southwest of the Azores on October 5.

Tropical Depression Twenty formed on October 27 over the southwestern Caribbean Sea and tracked northwest. After turning nearly due west, the depression briefly made landfall near the Nicaragua–Honduras border and made another landfall in southern Belize shortly before dissipating on October 29.

On November 8, Tropical Depression Twenty-One developed off the coast of Honduras. Moving north-northwestward, the system gradually intensified. Between November 9 and 10, reconnaissance missions into the depression found winds of ; however, the NHC did not upgrade it to a tropical storm, because weaken occurred shortly thereafter. Over the following few days, the system gradually turned southward and made landfall in the southwestern edge of the Yucatán Peninsula on November 12, shortly before dissipating. 

In late November, Tropical Depression Twenty-Two formed over the central Atlantic. A short-lived system, it formed on November 29 and dissipated on December 1.

== Storm names ==

The following list of names was used for named storms that formed in the North Atlantic in 1975. Storms were named &quot;Amy&quot;, &quot;Caroline&quot;, &quot;Doris&quot;, &quot;Eloise&quot;, and &quot;Faye&quot; for the first (and in the case of &quot;Eloise&quot;, only) time in 1975.

=== Retirement ===

On account of severe damage associated with the storm, the name &quot;Eloise&quot; was later retired. Due to the naming lists changing in 1979, no replacement name was selected.

== Season effects ==
This is a table of all of the storms that formed in the 1975 Atlantic hurricane season. It includes their name, duration, peak classification and intensities, areas affected, damage, and death totals. Deaths in parentheses are additional and indirect (an example of an indirect death would be a traffic accident), but were still related to that storm. Damage and deaths include totals while the storm was extratropical, a wave, or a low, and all of the damage figures are in 1975 USD.

<text>John Cullen Murphy (May 3, 1919 – July 2, 2004) was an American illustrator best known for his three decades of work on the &quot;Prince Valiant&quot; comic strip.

==Early life and education==
Born in New York City, Murphy spent his childhood in Chicago and in New Rochelle, New York, where his family moved in 1930.

He started art classes at the age of 9, but aspired to be a baseball player. He received supervision from artists like George Bridgman, Norman Rockwell, Charles Chapman and Franklin Booth. He was playing baseball one afternoon when he got attention of Norman Rockwell, his New Rochelle neighbor, who asked the 15-year-old if he would like to pose for some magazine ads. Rockwell&#x27;s &quot;Starstruck&quot;, showing a forlorn Murphy gazing at pictures of movie starlets, was the September 22, 1934 cover of &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot;. The experience inspired the young Murphy to become an illustrator. Rockwell became one of his good friends and mentors. Murphy started his career early, selling his first illustrations while he was still in high school. After high school, he studied in New York City at the Phoenix Art Institute and the Art Students League, where he was taught by the anatomist George Bridgman.

==Army service==
Murphy entered the U.S. Army in 1940, joining the 7th Regiment. He became an anti-aircraft officer during World War II, rising to the rank of major. He spent several years in the Pacific, beginning in Australia and ending in Tokyo. He was an aide to General William F. Marquat, who was on General Douglas MacArthur&#x27;s staff. During the war, Murphy continued to illustrate, sending work to the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; and painting numerous portraits of military figures, including MacArthur.

== Work ==

===Magazine illustration===
Murphy&#x27;s first professional work at the age of seventeen was for Madison Square Garden&#x27;s publicity department, drawing boxing cartoons. On average two of his cartoons a week were published by sports magazines in Chicago. He resumed his art career upon his return from military service. During the 1940s, he was a popular magazine illustrator, regularly seen in &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;Look&quot;, &quot;Esquire&quot;, &quot;Liberty&quot;, &quot;Sport&quot;, &quot;Holiday&quot; and &quot;Columbia&quot;, published by the Knights of Columbus.

===&quot;Big Ben Bolt&quot;===
Murphy&#x27;s art often depicted sports subjects. His boxing material unexpectedly led him into the comic strip field, something he had never previously considered. In 1950, writer Elliot Caplin (brother of cartoonist Al Capp) of King Features Syndicate asked Murphy to illustrate a boxing comic strip he was planning to write. Murphy accepted his invitation. The resulting daily comic strip, &quot;Big Ben Bolt&quot;, was launched in 1950 and ran until 1978.

===&quot;Prince Valiant&quot;===
Murphy began his collaboration on &quot;Prince Valiant&quot; (the saga of a young Norse prince who becomes a knight of King Arthur&#x27;s round table at Camelot) with creator Hal Foster in 1970 when Foster decided to lessen his workload at age 78. From the fall of 1970 until early 1980 Foster sent Murphy pencilled layouts, notes, and initially scripts. With Foster&#x27;s retirement in 1979, Murphy&#x27;s son Cullen took over the writing. Cullen Murphy began contributing stories to Foster while studying at Amherst College. Bill Crouch also contributed six story lines over the next four years. Murphy continued to draw &quot;Prince Valiant&quot; with his son scripting and his daughter doing the lettering and coloring until his retirement in March 2004, when he turned the strip over to his chosen successor, illustrator Gary Gianni. Murphy died four months later in Cos Cob, Connecticut.

==Personal life==
In 1951, Murphy married Joan Byrne, also from New Rochelle. They had eight children. His son, Cullen Murphy (John Cullen Murphy, Jr.), is a writer and magazine editor.

== Skills ==
Murphy never copied Foster&#x27;s style, preferring a harder pen line instead of the softer brush look, giving the strip a more angular feel. Frank Bolle helped Murphy in layouts and research but Murphy&#x27;s detailed pen work could still be seen in all the finished pages.

==Awards==
For his work on &quot;Big Ben Bolt&quot; and &quot;Prince Valiant&quot;, Murphy was honored with the National Cartoonists Society&#x27;s Story Comic Strip Award in 1971 and again for &quot;Prince Valiant&quot; in 1974, 1976, 1978, 1984 and 1987. He received the Elzie Segar Award in 1983.

<text>Major general Georgi Ivanov Kakalov (; born July 2, 1940) is a Bulgarian former military officer who was the first Bulgarian cosmonaut. He was a member of the National Assembly of Bulgaria in 1990.

==Early life and military career==
Born in Lovech, Georgi Kakalov attended the Military Air-force School in Dolna Mitropolia. After completing the five-year program, he served in the Bulgarian People&#x27;s Army as a military pilot. A few years later he became an instructor and head of a division.

He was selected to participate in the Soviet International Space Programme Interkosmos in 1978 and to follow the Soyuz spaceship training programme.

Meanwhile, he changed his family name to Ivanov, because his original surname Kakalov sounded very similar to &quot;Кака&quot; (excrements). 

After intensive training, Georgi Ivanov was selected for the fourth mission under the Interkosmos programme, bringing Bulgaria to the 6th place among the countries that had their national space explorers.

==Intercosmos program==
Ivanov, along with Soviet cosmonaut Nikolai Rukavishnikov, was launched into space as part of the Soyuz 33 mission from Baikonur Cosmodrome on April 10, 1979, at 17:34 (GMT). The scientific program for the flight was prepared entirely by Bulgarian scientists, along with some of the equipment.

Though take-off was smooth, the mission was a disaster, with severe damage of the engine preventing docking in orbit to Salyut 6 orbital station as it was initially planned. A premature return to Earth became the only possible decision for Ivanov and Rukavishnikov. Due to some additional technical problems landing was difficult to endure-more than 9Gs. When Soyuz 33 finally landed, it was southeast of Dzhezkazgan. It completed 31 orbits, and was in space for 1 day, 23 hours, and 1 minute. The flight remains the only example for manual landing and is thus quoted in every astronautic textbook.

Ivanov was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union on April 13, 1979. He earned a Ph.D. in space engineering. He was selected to the National Assembly and took part in the creation of the new democratic Constitution of the Republic of Bulgaria.

==Personal life==
Since 1993, Ivanov has been the executive director of Air Sofia.

Ivanov was married to Natalya Rousanova; they have one daughter, Ani (born 1967), and divorced in 1982. He is currently married to Lidia and they have one son, Ivan (born 1984). His hobbies include skiing, fishing, and golf. Ivanov is a member of the ASE — Association of the Space Explorers. He founded the &quot;Future in Space Foundation&quot;.

==Honours and awards==
* Hero of the People&#x27;s Republic of Bulgaria (1979)
* Hero of the Soviet Union (1979)
* Honorary citizen of Lovech (29 April 1979)
* Order of Georgi Dimitrov (1979)

<doc id="786882" wikidata="Q120467" url="?curid=786882" title="1926–27 NHL season">
<text>The 1926–27 NHL season was the tenth season of the National Hockey League. The success of the Boston Bruins and the Pittsburgh Pirates led the NHL to expand further within the United States. The league added three new teams: the Chicago Black Hawks, Detroit Cougars, and New York Rangers, to make a total of ten, split in two divisions. This resulted in teams based in Canada being in the minority for the first time. To stock the teams with players the new teams brought in players from the Western Hockey League, which folded in May 1926. This left the NHL in sole possession of hockey&#x27;s top players, as well as sole control of hockey&#x27;s top trophy, the Stanley Cup, which was won by the Ottawa Senators. This was the original Senators&#x27; eleventh and final Stanley Cup win. The Senators&#x27; first was in 1903.

==League business==
NHL expansion was the main topic of discussion between the NHL owners at the April 1926 and May 1, 1926 league meetings. The new New York Rangers franchise was approved in principle after the Madison Square Gardens president Hammond agreed to revenue sharing. President Calder, plus owners Strachan and Dandurand formed a committee to study franchise candidates in Chicago, Detroit, Jersey City and Philadelphia, while further applications from Cleveland, New York, Chicago, Philadelphia and Detroit were received. The owners were split on which new franchises to accept. Part of the disagreement was over the Chicago franchise. Sports promoter Paddy Harmon had announced a new Chicago Stadium and backed a team in partnership with Thomas Duggan, while Madison Square Garden&#x27;s Tex Rickard wanted to build a Chicago Madison Square Garden with the participation of Huntington Hardwick.

At the 1926 Stanley Cup Finals, WHL president Frank Patrick had begun shopping the WHL&#x27;s players to the NHL, hoping to raise $300,000 to distribute to the WHL owners. Patrick approached Art Ross of the Bruins, who agreed to purchase the contracts of Frank Fredrickson, Eddie Shore, and Duke Keats. After the series, Patrick approached the new New York Rangers owner Charles Hammond and their general manager Conn Smythe, but they were turned down. Patrick and Ross approached the Bruins&#x27; owner who agreed to purchase the entire lot of players for $250,000, and gave Patrick a $50,000 check as a deposit. He planned to keep some of the players for the Bruins, sell twelve players each to the new Chicago and Detroit franchises and distribute the rest to the rest of the league.

At a May 14 meeting, the NHL awarded the Detroit franchise to the syndicate of Wesson Seybourn and John Townsend, formed by Charles A. Hughes. The split over the new Chicago franchise prevented its immediate acceptance as a new franchise required unanimity. However, the NHL governors could amend their constitution with a two-thirds vote, and they amended the constitution at the May 14 meeting to lower the bar for a new franchise to a simple majority vote. The governors agreed that Huntwick would get the Chicago franchise. Huntwick proceeded to buy the Portland Rosebuds and the Hughes group purchased the Victoria Cougars, each for $100,000. The Bruins took Fredrickson, Shore, Keats and others, while the Rangers took Frank Boucher. In total, the player&#x27;s contracts purchased that day totalled $267,000 for Patrick to take back to the WHL. On May 15, the NHL awarded the franchises to the Hardwick and Hughes consortiums, with provisos that each team would have an NHL-ready team for September 1, and new arenas by November 10.

At the September 25, 1926, NHL meeting, the Chicago Black Hawks, Detroit Cougars and New York Rangers were added to the league. The Hughes consortium proceeded with the purchase of the Cougars and the franchise, while the Chicago franchise instead went to Frederic McLaughlin, who took over the deal from Huntwick on June 1. The NHL&#x27;s second franchise in New York City went to the Madison Square Garden syndicate of John S. Hammond. Both Detroit and Chicago had not begun construction on arenas. Detroit would play in Windsor, Ontario at the Border Cities Arena, while the Black Hawks played at the Chicago Coliseum.

Toronto bought the players of the Saskatoon franchise separately, and Montreal claimed George Hainsworth. The rest of the WHL players would be distributed by a committee of Frank Calder, Leo Dandurand and James Strachan. The former WHL players made an impact in the NHL. The top scorer was Bill Cook, the top goalie was George Hainsworth, and defenceman Herb Gardiner was the league MVP.

A special meeting was held on October 26 at which the NHL was split into the Canadian and American divisions. It was the first divisional format to be implemented in a major professional North American sports league. To balance the divisions, the New York Americans were placed in the Canadian Division. With the new divisional alignment came an altered playoff format: the top team from each division would meet the winner of a total-goals series between the second and third place teams from their divisions. The winners of those total-goals series would meet in a best-of-five Stanley Cup Finals.

The Central Hockey League changed its name to the American Hockey Association. The new AHA signed an agreement of co-operation with the NHL, wanting to place itself on an equal footing with the NHL, but non-competitive. However, the new AHA placed franchises in Chicago and Detroit, competing with NHL teams. The Chicago Cardinals were backed by old nemesis Eddie Livingstone and became a source of friction with the NHL. Calder declared that several of the Cardinals&#x27; players were illegally signed and broke off the agreement with the AHA. The AHA could not compete with the NHL and the Detroit franchise folded in December, and the Chicago franchise folded in March. The AHA then signed another cooperation agreement with the NHL and forced Livingstone out.

Majority ownership of the Toronto St. Patricks was sold on February 14, 1927 to a syndicate headed by Conn Smythe for . Nathan Nathanson sold his interest entirely, while J. P. Bickell retained his share of the company. The club was officially renamed the Toronto Maple Leafs and Bickell became its president, but the league ruled that the team must remain using the St. Patricks name until season&#x27;s end.

===Rules changes===
The blue lines moved to sixty feet from the goal line from twenty feet from the center red line to increase the size of the neutral zone.

Two innovations attributed to Art Ross are adopted by the NHL. The league adopts a modified puck, which has rounded edges. The net is modified to keep the puck in the webbing.

==Arena changes==
* The expansion Chicago Black Hawks moved into Chicago Coliseum.
* The expansion Detroit Cougars played this season at Border Cities Arena in Windsor, Ontario, while Olympia Stadium remained under construction.
* The Montreal Canadiens moved from Mount Royal Arena to the Montreal Forum, sharing it with the Maroons.
* The expansion New York Rangers moved into the third building named Madison Square Garden, sharing it with the Americans.

==Regular season==
The Montreal Canadiens, last place finishers in 1925–26, solved their goaltending woes by signing George Hainsworth. They further strengthened their team by signing Herb Gardiner of the Western League&#x27;s Calgary Tigers for defence. The Canadiens finished second in the Canadian Division to powerful Ottawa, who was the league&#x27;s best team.

Dave Gill, secretary-treasurer (general manager), decided to take over as coach of the Ottawa Senators. He would be assisted by Frank Shaughnessy, a former manager of the Senators in the NHA days, to assist him with the strategy used in games. Ottawa finished first atop the Canadian Division.

The arena is not ready in Detroit for the start of the regular season. The expansion Cougars play their first 22 home games just across the Canada–United States border in Windsor, Ontario, at the Border Cities Arena.

On December 4, 1926, Cy Denneny and Frank Finnigan were seriously injured in a car accident.
Finnigan suffered a slightly fractured skull and Denneny was badly gashed.

New York Americans right winger Shorty Green&#x27;s career was ended after an injury in a game on February 27, 1927. New York Rangers defenceman Taffy Abel bodychecked Green, caused a kidney injury that requires an emergency operation to remove the kidney; Abel retired for health reasons.

===Final standings===
&quot;Note: W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties, Pts = Points, GF= Goals For, GA = Goals Against&quot;

==Playoffs==
With the collapse of the Western Hockey League, the Stanley Cup became the championship trophy of the NHL. The NHL teams now battled out amongst themselves for the coveted Cup. The new division alignment and the new playoff format also meant that an American team was guaranteed to be the first American NHL team to make the Cup Finals.

The division winners received a bye to the second round. The second-place and third-place finishers played a two-game, total-goals series to advance to the second round. The second-place Montreal Canadiens and Boston Bruins both advanced to the second round. The Canadiens lost to the first-place Ottawa Senators, while the Bruins upset the first-place New York Rangers to set up the Finals. Ties were not broken using overtime. After two ties in the Finals, Ottawa won two to Boston&#x27;s none and the series ended on April 13 with Ottawa the winner.

==Playoff bracket==
==Quarterfinals==

==Awards==
A new trophy in memory of Georges Vezina, the Vezina Trophy, was donated this year by Montreal Canadiens owners Leo Dandurand, Louis Letourneau and Joseph Cattarinich. It is to be presented to the league&#x27;s &quot;most valuable goaltender.&quot; It is won by his successor with the Canadiens, George Hainsworth.

<text>Nikolai Semyonovich Leskov (; – ) was a Russian novelist, short-story writer, playwright, and journalist, who also wrote under the pseudonym M. Stebnitsky. Praised for his unique writing style and innovative experiments in form, and held in high esteem by Leo Tolstoy, Anton Chekhov and Maxim Gorky among others, Leskov is credited with creating a comprehensive picture of contemporary Russian society using mostly short literary forms. His major works include &quot;Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk&quot; (1865) (which was later made into an opera by Shostakovich), &quot;The Cathedral Folk&quot; (1872), &quot;The Enchanted Wanderer&quot; (1873), and &quot;The Tale of Cross-eyed Lefty from Tula and the Steel Flea&quot; (1881).

Leskov received his formal education at the Oryol Lyceum. In 1847 Leskov joined the Oryol criminal court office, later transferring to Kiev, where he worked as a clerk, attended university lectures, mixed with local people, and took part in various student circles. In 1857 Leskov quit his job as a clerk and went to work for the private trading company Scott &amp; Wilkins owned by Alexander Scott, his aunt&#x27;s Scottish husband.

His literary career began in the early 1860s with the publication of his short story &quot;The Extinguished Flame&quot; (1862), and his novellas &quot;Musk-Ox&quot; (May 1863) and &quot;The Life of a Peasant Woman&quot; (September, 1863). His first novel &quot;No Way Out&quot; was published under the pseudonym M. Stebnitsky in 1864. From the mid-1860s to the mid-1880s Leskov published a wide range of works, including journalism, sketches, short stories, and novels. Leskov&#x27;s major works, many of which continue to be published in modern versions, were written during this time. A number of his later works were banned because of their satirical treatment of the Russian Orthodox Church and its functionaries. Leskov died on 5 March 1895, aged 64, and was interred in the Volkovo Cemetery in Saint Petersburg, in the section reserved for literary figures.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Nikolai Semyonovich Leskov was born on 4 February 1831, in Gorokhovo, Oryol Gubernia, to Semyon Dmitrievich Leskov (1789–1848), a respected criminal investigator and local court official, and Maria Petrovna Leskova (née Alferyeva; 1813–1886), the daughter of an impoverished Moscow nobleman, who first met her future husband at a very young age, when he worked as a tutor in their house. Leskov&#x27;s ancestors on his father&#x27;s side were all clergymen in the village of Leska in Oryol Gubernia, hence the name Leskov. Semyon Dmitrievich was a well-educated man; friends referred to him as a &quot;homegrown intellectual&quot;. One of Nikolai&#x27;s aunts on his mother&#x27;s side was married to a rich Oryol landlord named Strakhov who owned the village of Gorokhovo (&quot;a beautiful, wealthy and well-groomed estate... where the hosts lived in luxury,&quot; according to Leskov) another was the wife of an Englishman, the chief steward for several local estates and a large trade company owner. Leskov spent his first eight years in Gorokhovo, where his grandmother lived and where his mother was only an occasional guest. He acquired his early education in the house of Strakhov, who employed tutors from Germany and France for his own children. As the German teacher started to praise Leskov for his gifts, his life became difficult, due to the jealousy of his hosts. At his grandmother&#x27;s request, his father took Nikolai back to Oryol where he settled in the family house at 3 Dvoryanskaya Street.

In 1839 Semyon Leskov lost his job through a row and intrigue, having brought upon himself the wrath of the governor himself. &quot;So we left our house in Oryol, sold what we had in the city and bought a village with 50 peasants in the Kromy region from general A. I. Krivtsov. The purchase was made mostly on credit, for mother was still hoping to get her five thousand off of Strakhov which never came. The tiny village father had bought was eventually sold for debts,&quot; Leskov later remembered. What the Leskovs, with their three sons and two daughters, were left with was a small Panin khutor, one very poor house, a watermill, a garden, two peasants&#x27; houses and 40 dessiatins of land. This is where Nikolai had his first experiences with oral folklore and the &#x27;earthy&#x27; Russian dialecticisms he would later become famous for reviving in his literary work.

In August 1841 Leskov began his formal education at the Oryol Lyceum. After five years of poor progress all he could manage was a two-year graduation certificate. Later, scholar B. Bukhstab, comparing Leskov&#x27;s school failures with those of Nikolay Nekrasov who had had similar problems, argued that, &quot;...apparently, in both cases the reasons were – on the one hand, the lack of a guiding hand, on the other – [both young men&#x27;s] loathing for the tiresome cramming routine and the deadly dumbness of state education, both having lively temperaments and an eagerness to learn more of real life&quot;. 
In June 1847 Leskov joined the Oryol criminal court office, where Semyon Dmitrievich had once worked. In May 1848 Leskov&#x27;s family&#x27;s property was destroyed by a fire. In July of the same year Leskov&#x27;s father died from cholera. In December 1849 Leskov asked his superiors for a transfer to Kiev, where he joined the local government treasury chamber as an assistant clerk and settled with his maternal uncle, S. P. Alferyev, a professor of medicine.

In Kiev he attended lectures at the university as an auditor student, studied the Polish and Ukrainian languages and the art of icon-painting, took part in the religious and philosophical circles of the students, and met pilgrims, sectarians and religious dissenters. Dmitry Zhuravsky, an economist and critic of serfdom in Russia, was said to be one of his major influences. In 1853 Leskov married Olga Smirnova; they had one son, Dmitry (who died after only a year), and a daughter, Vera.

In 1857 Leskov quit his job in the office and joined the private trading company &quot;Scott &amp; Wilkins&quot; (Шкотт и Вилькенс) owned by Alexander Scott, his aunt Polly&#x27;s Scottish husband. Later he wrote of this in one of his short autobiographical sketches: &quot;Soon after the Crimean War I was infected with a then popular heresy, something I&#x27;ve been reproaching myself for since. I abandoned the state official career which seemed to be starting promisingly and joined one of the newly-born trade companies.&quot;

In May 1857 Leskov moved with his family to Raiskoye village in Penza Governorate where the Scotts were based, and later that month embarked upon his first business trip, involving the transportation of the Oryol-based serfs of Count Perovsky to the Southern Russian steppes, not entirely successfully, as he later described in his autobiographical short story &quot;The Product of Nature&quot;. While working for this company, which, in Leskov&#x27;s words, &quot;was eager to exploit whatever the region could provide,&quot; he derived valuable experience, making him an expert in numerous branches of industry and agriculture. The firm employed him as an agent envoy; while travelling through the remote regions of Russia, the young man learned local dialects and became keenly interested in the customs and ways of the different ethnic and regional groups of Russian peoples. Years later, when asked what the source of the endless stream of stories that seemed to pour out of him ceaselessly was, Leskov said, pointing at his forehead: &quot;From this trunk. Here pictures from the six or seven years of my commercial career are being kept, from the times when I travelled across Russia on business trips. Those were the best years of my life. I saw a lot and life was easy for me.&quot;

In &quot;Russian Society in Paris&quot; he wrote: &quot;I think I know the Russian man down to the very bottom of his nature but I give myself no credit for that. It&#x27;s just that I&#x27;ve never tried to investigate the &#x27;people&#x27;s ways&#x27; by having conversations with Petersburg&#x27;s cabmen. I just grew up among common people.&quot; Up until 1860 Leskov resided with members of his family (and that of Alexander Scott) in Raisky, Penza Governorate. In the summer of 1860, when &quot;Scott &amp; Wilkins&quot; closed, he returned to Kiev to work there as a journalist for a while, then in the end of the year moved to Saint Petersburg.

===Journalism===
Leskov began writing in the late 1850s, making detailed reports to the directors of &quot;Scott &amp; Wilkins&quot;, and recounting his meetings and contracts in personal letters to Scott. The latter, marveling at his business partner&#x27;s obvious literary gift, showed them to writer Ilya Selivanov who found these pieces &quot;worthy of publication&quot;. Leskov considered his long essay &quot;Sketches on Wine Industry Issues&quot;, written in 1860 about the 1859 anti-alcohol riots and first published in a local Odessa newspaper, then in &quot;Otechestvennye Zapiski&quot; (April 1861), to be his proper literary debut.
 In May 1860 he returned with his family to Kiev, and in the summer started to write for both the &quot;Sankt-Peterburgskye Vedomosty&quot; newspaper and the Kiev-based &quot;Sovremennaya Meditsina&quot; (where he published his article &quot;On the Working Class&quot;, and several essays on medical issues) and the &quot;Ukazatel Ekonomitchesky&quot; (Economic Guide). His series of October 1860 articles on corruption in the sphere of police medicine (&quot;Some Words on the Police Medics in Russia&quot;) led to confrontations with colleagues and his being fired from &quot;Sovremennaya Meditsina&quot;. In 1860 his articles started to appear regularly in the Saint Petersburg-based paper &quot;Otechestvennye Zapiski&quot; where he found a friend and mentor in the Oryol-born publicist S. S. Gromeko.

In January 1861 Leskov moved to Saint Peterburg where he stayed at Professor Ivan Vernadsky&#x27;s along with Zemlya i volya member Andrey Nechiporenko and met Taras Shevchenko. For a short while he moved to Moscow and started to work for the &quot;Russkaya Retch&quot; newspaper, all the while contributing to &quot;Otechestvennye Zapiski&quot;. In December he left &quot;Russkaya Retch&quot; (for personal, rather than ideological reasons) and moved back to Saint Peterburg where in January 1862 he joined the staff of the &quot;Northern Bee&quot; (&quot;Severnaya ptchela&quot;), a liberal newspaper edited by Pavel Usov. There Leskov met journalist Arthur Benni, a Polish-born British citizen, with whom he forged a great friendship and later came to defend, as leftist radicals in Petersburg started to spread rumours about his being &quot;an English spy&quot; and having links with the 3rd Department. For &quot;Severnaya ptchela&quot; Leskov (now writing as M. Stebnitsky, a pseudonym he used in 1862–1869) became the head of the domestic affairs department, writing sketches and articles on every possible aspect of everyday life, and also critical pieces, targeting what was termed nihilism and &quot;vulgar materialism&quot;. He had some support at the time, from several prominent journalists, among them Grigory Eliseev, who wrote in the April 1862, &quot;Sovremennik&quot; issue: &quot;Those lead columns in &quot;Ptchela&quot; make one pity the potential that is being spent there, still unrealised elsewhere.&quot; At a time of intense public excitement, as D. S. Mirsky pointed out, Leskov was &quot;absorbed by the public interest as much as anyone, but his eminently practical mind and training made it impossible for him to join unreservedly any of the very impractical and hot-headed parties of the day. Hence his isolation when, in the spring of 1862, an incident occurred that had a lasting effect on his career.&quot;

On 30 May 1862, &quot;Severnaya Ptchela&quot; published an article by &quot;Nikolaj Leskov&quot; on the issue of the fires that started on 24 May, lasting for six days and destroying a large part of the Apraksin and Schukin quarters of the Russian capital, which popular rumour imputed to a group of &quot;revolutionary students and Poles&quot; that stood behind the &quot;Young Russia&quot; proclamation. Without supporting the rumour, the author demanded that the authorities should come up with a definitive statement which would either confirm or confute those allegations. The radical press construed this as being aimed at inciting the common people against the students and instigating police repressions. On the other hand, the authorities were unhappy too, for the article implied that they were doing little to prevent the atrocities. The author&#x27;s suggestion that &quot;firemen sent to the sites would do anything rather than idly stand by&quot; angered Alexander II himself, who reportedly said: &quot;This shouldn&#x27;t have been allowed, this is a lie.&quot;

Frightened, &quot;Severnaya Ptchela&quot; sent its controversial author on a trip to Paris as a correspondent, making sure the mission was a long onе. After visiting Wilno, Grodno and Belostok, in November 1862 Leskov arrived in Prague where he met a group of Czech writers, notably Martin Brodsky, whose arabesque &quot;You Don&#x27;t Cause Pain&quot; he translated. In December Leskov was in Paris, where he translated Božena Němcová&#x27;s &quot;Twelve Months (A Slavic Fairytale)&quot;, both translations were published by &quot;Severnaya ptchela&quot; in 1863. On his return to Russia in 1863 Leskov published several essays and letters, documenting his trip.

==Literary career==
===Debut===

1862 saw the launch of Leskov&#x27;s literary career, with the publication of &quot;The Extinguished Flame&quot; (later re-issued as &quot;The Drought&quot;) in the March issue of &quot;Vek&quot; magazine, edited by Grigory Eliseev, followed by the short novels &quot;Musk-Ox&quot; (May 1863) and &quot;The Life of a Peasant Woman&quot; (September, 1863). In August the compilation &quot;Three stories by M. Stebnitsky&quot; came out. Another trip, to Riga in summer, resulted in a report on the Old Believers community there, which was published as a brochure at the end of the year.

In February 1864 &quot;Biblioteka Dlya Chteniya&quot; magazine began serially publishing his debut novel &quot;No Way Out&quot; (the April and May issues of the magazine, stopped by the censors, came out in June). The novel bore &quot;every sign of haste and literary incompetence,&quot; as its author later admitted, but proved to be a powerful debut in its own way. &quot;No Way Out&quot;, which satirized nihilist communes on the one hand and praised the virtues of the common people and the powers of Christian values on the other, scandalized critics of the radical left who discovered that for most of the characters real life prototypes could be found, and its central figure, Beloyartsev, was obviously a caricature of author and social activist Vasily Sleptsov. All this seemed to confirm the view, now firmly rooted in the Russian literary community, that Leskov was a right-wing, &#x27;reactionary&#x27; author. In April Dmitry Pisarev wrote in his review &quot;A Walk In the Garden of Russian Literature&quot; (&quot;Russkoye Slovo&quot;, 1865, No.3): &quot;Can any other magazine be found anywhere in Russia, besides &quot;The Russian Messenger&quot;, that would venture to publish anything written by and signed as, Stebnitsky? Could one single honest writer be found in Russia who would be so careless, so indifferent regarding his reputation, as to contribute to a magazine that adorns itself with novels and novellas by Stebnitsky?&quot; The social democrat-controlled press started spreading rumours that &quot;No Way Out&quot; had been &#x27;commissioned&#x27; by the Interior Ministry&#x27;s 3rd Department. What Leskov condemned as &quot;a vicious libel&quot; caused great harm to his career: popular journals boycotted him, while Mikhail Katkov of the conservative &quot;The Russian Messenger&quot; greeted him as a political ally.

===Major works===
Leskov&#x27;s novel, &quot;Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District&quot; (written in Kiev in November 1864 and published in Dostoevsky&#x27;s &quot;Epoch&quot; magazine in January 1865) and his novella &quot;The Amazon&quot; (&quot;Otechestvennye zapiski&quot;, No.7, 1866), both &quot;pictures of almost unrelieved wickedness and passion&quot;, were ignored by contemporary critics but were praised decades later as masterpieces, containing powerful depictions of highly expressive female characters from different classes and walks of life. Both, marked by a peculiar &quot;Leskovian&quot; sense of humour, were written in the skaz manner, a unique folk-ish style of writing, of which Leskov, along with Gogol, was later declared an originator. Two more novellas came out at this time: &quot;Neglected People&quot; (Oboydyonnye; &quot;Otechestvennye Zapiski&quot;, 1865) which targeted Chernyshevsky&#x27;s novel &quot;What&#x27;s to Be Done?&quot;, and &quot;The Islanders&quot; (1866), about the everyday life of Vasilyevsky Island&#x27;s German community. It was in these years that Leskov debuted as a dramatist. &quot;The Spendthrift&quot; (Rastratchik), published by &quot;Literaturnaya biblioteka&quot; in May 1867, was staged first at the Alexandrinsky Theatre (as a benefit for actress E. Levkeeva), then in December at Moscow&#x27;s Maly Theater (with E. Chumakovskaya in the lead). The play was poorly received for &quot;conveying pessimism and asocial tendencies.&quot; All the while Leskov was working as a critic: his six-part series of essays on the St. Petersburg Drama Theater was completed in December 1867. In February 1868 &quot;Stories by M.Stebnitsky&quot; (Volume 1) came out in Saint Petersburg to be followed by Volume 2 in April; both were criticized by the leftist press, Mikhail Saltykov-Shchedrin in particular.

In 1870 Leskov published the novel &quot;At Daggers Drawn&quot;, another attack aimed at the nihilist movement which, as the author saw it, was quickly merging with the Russian criminal community. Leskov&#x27;s &quot;political&quot; novels (according to Mirsky) were not among his masterpieces, but they were enough to turn him into &quot;a bogey figure for all the radicals in literature and made it impossible for any of the influential critics to treat him with even a modicum of objectivity.&quot; Leskov would later refer to the novel as a failure and blamed Katkov&#x27;s incessant interference for it. &quot;His was the publication in which literary qualities were being methodically repressed, destroyed, or applied to serve specific interests which had nothing to do with literature,&quot; he later insisted. Some of his colleagues (Dostoevsky among them) criticized the novel from the technical point of view, speaking of the stiltedness of the &quot;adventure&quot; plot and the improbability of some of its characters.

The short novel &quot;Laughter and Grief&quot; (&quot;Sovremennaya letopis&quot;, March–May, 1871), a strong social critique focusing on the fantastic disorganization and incivility of Russian life and commenting on the sufferings of individuals in a repressive society proved to be his last; from then on Leskov avoided the genre of the orthodox novel. In November 1872, though, he adapted Victor Hugo&#x27;s &quot;Toilers of the Sea&quot; for children. Five years later Józef Ignacy Kraszewski&#x27;s &quot;The Favourites of King August&quot; came out, translated from the Polish and edited by Leskov.
&quot;The Cathedral Folk&quot; (&quot;Soboryane&quot;), published in 1872, is a compilation of stories and sketches which form an intricate tapestry of thinly drawn plotlines. It was seen as a turning point in the author&#x27;s career; a departure from political negativism. According to Maxim Gorky, after &quot;Daggers&quot;, his &quot;evil novel&quot;, Leskov&#x27;s &quot;craft became more of a literary icon-painting: he began to create a gallery of saints for the Russian iconostases.&quot; Leskov&#x27;s miscellaneous sketches on the lives and tribulations of the Russian small-scale priesthood and rural nobility gradually gravitated (according to critic V. Korovin) into a cohesive, albeit frameless tapestry of a battlefield where &quot;good men&quot; (Tuberozov, Desnitsyn, Benefaktov, all of them priests) were fighting off a bunch of crooks and scoundrels; nihilists and officials. &quot;Soboryane&quot;, published by &quot;The Russian Messenger&quot; in 1872, had for its major theme the intrinsic, unbridgeable gap between the &quot;down to earth&quot;, Christianity of the people and the official, state-sponsored corrupt version; it riled both the state and church authorities, was widely debated and had great resonance. In the summer of 1872 Leskov travelled to Karelia and visited the Valaam monastery in Lake Ladoga; the result of this trip was his &quot;Monastic Isles&quot; cycle of essays published in &quot;Russky mir&quot; in 1873. In October 1872 another collection, &quot;Small Belle-lettres Works by Leskov-Stebnitsky&quot; came out. These were the months of his short-lived friendship with Aleksey Pisemsky; Leskov greatly praised his novel &quot;In the Vortex&quot; and in August 1872 visited Pisemsky in Moscow.

At the same time, Leskov was working on two of his &quot;Stargorod Chronicles&quot;, later regarded as part of a trilogy, along with &quot;The Cathedral Folk&quot;, &quot;Old Years in Plodomasovo&quot; (1869) and &quot;A Decayed Family&quot; (1873), each featuring a strong female character: virtuous, courageous, noble and &quot;reasonably humane&quot;. Both works bore signs of being unfinished. It later transpired that the second work was ill-received by Mikhail Katkov, and that Leskov, having lost all interest, simply refused to complete what otherwise might have been developed into a full-blown novel. Both chronicles were thinly veiled satires on certain aspects of the Orthodox church, especially those incongruities it had with intrinsic Christian values which had made it impossible (according to the author) for the latter to take root firmly in the Russian soil. On 16 November 1874, Leskov wrote to Ivan Aksakov: &quot;The second part of &quot;A Decayed Family&quot; which appeared in god-awful shape, became the last straw for me.&quot; It was in the course of the publication of this second part that Katkov told one of his associates, Voskoboynikov: &quot;We&#x27;ve made a mistake: this man is not one of us.&quot;

In 1873 &quot;The Sealed Angel&quot; came out, about a miracle which caused an Old Believer community to return to the Orthodox fold. Influenced by traditional folk tales, it is regarded in retrospect one of Leskov&#x27;s finest works, employing his skaz technique to the fullest effect. &quot;The Sealed Angel&quot; turned out to be the only story that avoided being heavily cut by &quot;The Russian Messenger&quot; because, as Leskov later wrote, &quot;it slipped through, in the shadows, what with them being so busy.&quot; The story, rather critical of the authorities, resonated in high places and was read, reportedly, at the Court.

Inspired by his 1872 journey to Lake Ladoga, &quot;The Enchanted Wanderer&quot; (1873) was an amorphous, loosely structured piece of work, with several plotlines intertwined – the form Leskov thought the traditional novel was destined to be superseded by. Decades later scholars praised the story, comparing the character of Ivan Flyagin to that of Ilya Muromets, as symbolizing &quot;the physical and moral duress of the Russian man in times of trouble,&quot; but the response of contemporary critics was lukewarm, Nikolay Mikhaylovsky complaining of its general formlessness: &quot;details stringed together like beads, totally interchangeable.&quot; While all of Leskov&#x27;s previous works were severely cut, this was the first one to be rejected outright; it had to be published in the odd October and November issues of the &quot;Russky mir&quot; newspaper . In December 1873 Leskov took part in &quot;Skladchina&quot;, the charity anthology aimed at helping victims of famine in Russia.

Having severed ties with &quot;The Russian Messenger&quot;, Leskov found himself in serious financial trouble. This was relieved to an extent by his invitation in January 1874 to join the Scholarly Committee of the Ministry of Education (for this he owed much to the Empress consort Maria Alexandrovna who was known to have read &quot;The Cathedral Folk&quot; and spoke warmly to it), where his duty was to choose literature for Russian libraries and atheneums for a meager wage of one thousand rubles per year. In 1874 Leskov began writing &quot;Wandering Lights: A Biography of Praotsev&quot; which was soon halted and later printed as &quot;Early Years: From Merkula Praotsev’s Memoirs&quot;. It was during the publication of this work that the author made a comment which was later seen as his artistic manifesto: &quot;Things pass by us and I&#x27;m not going to diminish or boost their respective significance; I won&#x27;t be forced into doing so by the unnatural, man-made format of the novel which demands the rounding up of fabulas and the drawing together of plotlines to one central course. That&#x27;s not how life is. Human life runs on in its own way and that&#x27;s how I&#x27;m going to treat the roll of events in my works.&quot;

In the spring of 1875 Leskov went abroad, first to Paris, then to Prague and Dresden in August. In December his novella &quot;At the Edge of the World&quot; was published in &quot;Grazhdanin&quot; (1875, No. 52). All the while he continued to work on a set of stories which would later form his cycle &quot;Virtuous Ones&quot;. Some critics found Leskov&#x27;s heroes virtuous beyond belief, but he insisted they were not fantasies, but more like reminiscences of his earlier encounters. &quot;I credit myself with having some ability for analyzing characters and their motives, but I&#x27;m hopless at fantasizing. Making up things is hard labour for me, so I&#x27;ve always felt the need for having before me real faces which could intrigue me with their spirituality; then they get hold of me and I infuse them with new life, using some real-life stories as a basis,&quot; he wrote later in the &quot;Varshavsky Dnevnik&quot; newspaper. Years of confrontation with critics and many of his colleagues have taken their toll. &quot;Men of letters seem to recognize my writing as a force, but find great pleasure in killing it; in fact they have all but succeeded in killing it off altogether. I write nothing – I just can&#x27;t!&quot;, he wrote to Pyotr Schebalsky in January 1876.

In October 1881 &quot;Rus&quot; magazine started publishing &quot;The Tale of Cross-eyed Lefty from Tula and the Steel Flea&quot;, which is seen in retrospect as Leskov&#x27;s finest piece of work, bringing out the best in him as an ingenious storyteller and stylistic virtuoso whose skaz style is rich in word play and full of original neologisms, each carrying not only humorous but satirical messages. In &quot;Lefty&quot; the author&#x27;s point of view is engaged in lively interplay with that of the main (grotesquely naive, simple-minded) character. &quot;Some people argued that I had done little to distinguish between the good and the bad, and that it was difficult to make out who was a helper and who put wrenches in the works. This can be explained by the intrinsic deceitfulness of my own character,&quot; Leskov later wrote. Most deceitful (according to critic B. Bukhstab) was the author&#x27;s treatment of the character ataman Platov, whose actions, even as they are described in a grotesquely heroic manner by the simple-minded protagonist, are openly ridiculed by the author. What would later come to be seen as one of the gems of Russian literature was fiercely attacked both from the left (who accused Leskov of propagating jingoistic ideas) and the right, who found the general picture of the common people&#x27;s existence as depicted in the story a bit too gloomy for their taste.

&quot;Leftie&quot; premiered publicly in March 1882 at the literary and musical evening of The Pushkin Circle; on 16 April it came out in book form. The collection of sketches called &quot;Pechersky Antics&quot; was written in December, and published by &quot;Kievskaya Starina&quot;, in its February and April issues. By this time a large &quot;Russian Antics&quot; cycle began to take shape, in which Leskov implemented, as he saw it, Nikolai Gogol&#x27;s idea (formulated in the &quot;Selected Passages from Correspondence with Friends&quot;) of &quot;extoling modest working men.&quot; &quot;It is wrong and unworthy to pick out the worst in the soul of the Russian man, so I embarked on my own journey looking for virtuous ones. Whoever I asked would reply to the effect that they knew no such saints, and that all of us were sinful, but they had met some decent men... and I just started writing about them,&quot; he wrote in the preface to one such story (&quot;Singlethought&quot;, Odnodum, 1879). A similar cycle of short stories involved legends of early Christianity, with plot lines taken from the &quot;prologues&quot; and Byzantine stories of the 10th and 11th centuries. The fact that some of these pieces (&quot;Pamphalone&quot;, &quot;Beautiful Azu&quot;) were translated into German and praised by publishers, made Leskov immensely proud. What was new to the Russian reader in them was, as Mirsky noted, &quot;a boldly outspoken treatment of sensual episodes&quot;; some critics accused the author of &quot;treating his moral subjects as nothing but pretexts for the display of voluptuous and sensual scenes.&quot;

===Later years===

In February 1883 the essay &quot;Leap-frog in Church and Local Parish Whimsies&quot; (based on an officially documented episode concerning the outrageous behaviour of a drunken pastor and deacon at a church in a provincial town) was published by &quot;Istorichesky vestnik&quot;. It caused a scandal and cost its author his job at the Ministry of Education. Minister Delyanov suggested that Leskov should sign a retirement paper, but the latter refused. &quot;What do you need such a firing for?&quot; the Minister reportedly asked. &quot;For a decent obituary,&quot; Leskov retorted. In April he informed the director of the Oryol lyceum that he was sending him a gold medal he had received from the Ministry &quot;to be given to the poorest of that year&#x27;s graduates.&quot;

By this time the Russian Orthodox Church had become the major target of Leskov&#x27;s satire. In an 1883 letter, remembering &quot;The Cathedral Folk&quot;, he

confessed: &quot;These days I wouldn&#x27;t do them, I&#x27;d rather have written &quot;Notes of a Defrocked Priest&quot;... to show how all of the Crucified One&#x27;s commandments are being corrupted and falsified... [My position] would be defined as Tolstoyan these days, while things that have nothing to do with Christ&#x27;s teaching would be termed Orthodoxy. I wouldn&#x27;t oppose the term, I&#x27;d just say, Christianity this is not.&quot; Leskov&#x27;s religious essays of the early 1880s continued the same line of sympathetically supporting poor clergymen and ridiculing the hypocrisy of the Russian Orthodoxy&#x27;s higher ranks. In &quot;Count Tolstoy and F. M. Dostoyevsky as Heresiarchs&quot; and &quot;The Golden Age&quot;, both 1883) he defended both from the criticism of Konstantin Leontiev. Leskov never became a Tolstoyan, but his later works were impregnated with the idea of &quot;new Christianity&quot; which he himself identified with Leo Tolstoy, whom he became close with in the mid-1880s and was inevitably influenced by. On 18 April 1887, Leskov wrote a letter to Tolstoy asking for permission to visit him in Moscow so as to fulfill a &quot;long-standing desire.&quot; On 25 April the two authors met. &quot;What a bright and original man,&quot; Tolstoy later wrote in a letter to Chertkov. Leskov spent January 1890 with Chertkov and Tolstoy at Yasnaya Polyana, where Tolstoy read to them his own play &quot;The Fruits of Enlightenment&quot;.

In July 1883 the first four chapters of the novel &quot;As the Falcon Flies&quot; were published by &quot;Gazeta Gatsuka&quot;, followed by chapters five through eight, then chapters nine and ten; at this point the publication ceased due to interference by the censors. In January 1884 the publication of &quot;Notes of a Stranger&quot; began in &quot;Gazeta Gatsuka&quot; (No. 2) to be stopped in April, again by the censors. In the summer of 1884, while Leskov was on a trip through Warsaw, Dresden, Marienbad, Prague and Vienna, a special censorship order came out, demanding withdrawal of 125 books from Russian libraries, Leskov&#x27;s collection &quot;Trifles from the Life of Archbishops&quot; (1878–79) included. In November 1884, &quot;Nov&quot; magazine began publishing the novel &quot;The Unseen Trail&quot;: it was banned after chapter 26 and has never been completed. In November 1888 the novella &quot;Zenon the Goldsmith&quot; was written for &quot;Russkaya mysl&quot; and promptly banned. By this time, according to Bukhstab, Leskov found himself in isolation again. The right treated him as a dangerous radical, while the left, under pressure from the Russian government, were too scared to publish radical prose. Leskov himself referred to the stories of his later years as &quot;cruel&quot;. &quot;The public doesn&#x27;t like them because they&#x27;re cynical and in your face. But I don&#x27;t want to please the public, I want to torture it and flog it,&quot; he wrote.

In August, November and December 1887 respectively, the first three volumes of the collection &quot;Novellas and Short Stories by N. S. Leskov&quot; were published. At the 1888 New Year party at Alexei Suvorin&#x27;s, Leskov met Anton Chekhov for the first time. Soon Ilya Repin became Leskov&#x27;s friend and illustrator. Several months later in a letter, asking Leskov to sit for him, Repin explained his motives: &quot;Not only me but the whole of enlightened Russia loves you as an outstanding, distinguished writer and as a thinking man.&quot; The sittings early the next year were aborted: Leskov was unwilling to have his portrait seen at a forthcoming exhibition of Repin&#x27;s works.

In September 1888 Pyotr Bykov published a full bibliography of Leskov&#x27;s works (1860–1887) which intrigued publishers. In 1889 Alexei Suvorin&#x27;s publishing house began publishing the &quot;Complete Leskov&quot; in 12 volumes (which contained mostly fiction). By June 1889, the fourth and fifth volumes had been issued, but in August volume six, containing some anti-Eastern Orthodox satires was stopped. On 16 August, Leskov suffered his first major heart attack on the stairs of Suvorin&#x27;s house, upon learning the news. The publication of his works continued with volume seven, generating considerable royalties and greatly improving the author&#x27;s financial situation. A different version of volume six came out in 1890.

In January 1890 the publication of the novel &quot;The Devil Dolls&quot; (with Tsar Nikolai I and Karl Bryullov as the prototypes for the two main characters) started in &quot;Russkaya Mysl&quot;, but was stopped by censors. In 1891 &quot;Polunochniki&quot; (Night Owls), a thinly veiled satire on the Orthodox Church in general and Ioann Kronshtadsky in particular, was published in &quot;Severny vestnik&quot; and caused an uproar. The 1894 novella &quot;The Rabbit Warren&quot; about a clergyman who&#x27;d been honoured for reporting people to the authorities and driving a police official into madness by his zealousness (one of &quot;his most remarkable works and his greatest achievement in concentrated satire,&quot; according to Mirsky) was also banned and came out only in 1917 (in &quot;Niva&quot; magazine). The process of having his works published, which had always been difficult for Leskov, at this late stage became, in his own words, &quot;quite unbearable&quot;.

In his last years Leskov suffered from angina pectoris and asthma. There were also rumours, whose accuracy and substantiation have been questioned, that he had been diagnosed with male breast cancer. In early 1894 he caught a severe cold; by the end of the year his general condition had deteriorated. Responding to Pavel Tretyakov&#x27;s special request, Leskov (still very ill) agreed to pose for Valentin Serov, but in February 1895, when the portrait was exhibited in the Tretyakovskaya Gallery, he felt utterly upset both by the portrait and the black frame.

On 5 March 1895, Leskov died, aged 64. The funeral service was held in silence, in accordance with the writer&#x27;s December 1892 will, forbidding any speeches to be held over his dead body. &quot;I know I have many bad things in me and do not deserve to be praised or pitied,&quot; he explained. Leskov was interred in the Literatorskiye Mostki necropolis at the Volkovo Cemetery in Saint Petersburg (the section reserved for literary figures). Due to Leskov&#x27;s purportedly difficult nature (he has been described as despotic, vindictive, quick-tempered and prone to didacticism), he spent the last years of his life alone, his biological daughter Vera (from his first marriage) living far away and never visiting; his son Andrey residing in the capital but avoiding his father.

==Marriages and children==
On 6 April 1853 Leskov married Olga Vasilyevna Smirnova (1831–1909), the daughter of an affluent Kiev trader. Their son Dmitry was born on 23 December 1854 but died in 1855. On 8 March 1856, their daughter Vera Leskova was born. She married Dmitry Noga in 1879 and died in 1918. Leskov&#x27;s marriage was an unhappy one; his wife suffered from severe psychological problems and in 1878 had to be taken to the St. Nicholas Mental Hospital in Saint Petersburg. She died in 1909.

In 1865 Ekaterina Bubnova (née Savitskaya), whom he met for the first time in July 1864, became Leskov&#x27;s common-law wife. Bubnova had four children from her first marriage; one of whom, Vera (coincidentally the same name as Leskov&#x27;s daughter by his own marriage) Bubnova, was officially adopted by Leskov, who took care that his stepdaughter got a good education; she embarked upon a career in music. In 1866 Bubnova gave birth to their son, Andrey (1866–1953).
In August 1878 Leskov and Bubnova parted, and, with Andrey, Nikolai moved into the Semyonov house at the corner of Kolomenskaya St. and Kuznechny Lane, in Saint Petersburg. Bubnova suffered greatly at having her son taken away from her, as her letters, published many years later, attested.

In November 1883 Varya Dolina (daughter of E.A. Cook, Leskov&#x27;s maidservant and ethnic Finn) joined Leskov and his son, first as a pupil and protege, soon becoming another of Leskov&#x27;s adopted daughters.

Andrey Leskov made a career in the military. From 1919 to 1931 he served as a staff officer on the Soviet Army&#x27;s North-Western frontier and retired with the rank of Lieutenant-General. By this time he had become an authority on his father&#x27;s legacy, praised by Maxim Gorky among many others and regularly consulted by specialists. Andrey Leskov&#x27;s &quot;The Life of Nikolai Leskov&quot;, a comprehensive book of memoirs (which had its own dramatic story: destroyed in the 1942 Siege of Leningrad by a bomb, it was reconstructed from scratch by the 80-plus year old author after the War, and finished in 1948). It was first published by Goslitizdat in Moscow (1954); in 1981 it was re-issued in two volumes by Prioksky publishers in Tula.

==Legacy==

Nikolai Leskov, now widely regarded as a classic of Russian literature, had an extremely difficult literary career, marred by scandals which resulted in boycotts and ostracism. Describing the Russian literary scene at the time Leskov entered it, D. S. Mirsky wrote: 
After his 1862 article on the &quot;great fires&quot; and the 1864 novel &quot;No Way Out&quot;, Leskov found himself in total isolation which in the 1870s and 1880s was only partially relieved. Apollon Grigoriev, the only critic who valued him and approved of his work, died in 1864 and, according to Mirsky, &quot;Leskov owed his latter popularity to the good taste of that segment of the reading public who were beyond the scope of the &#x27;directing&#x27; influences&quot;. In the 1870s things improved but, according to Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary, &quot;Leskov&#x27;s position in his last 12 to 15 years was ambivalent, old friends distrusting him, new ones being still wary. For all his big name, he wasn&#x27;t a centerpiece literary figure and critics all but ignored him. This didn&#x27;t prevent the huge success of the &quot;Complete Leskov&quot;.&quot; After the 10th volume of this collection was published, critic Mikhail Protopopov came up with an essay called &quot;The Sick Talent&quot;. Crediting Leskov as a superb psychologist and a master of &quot;reproducing domestic scenes,&quot; he rated him equal to Melnikov-Pechersky and Mikhail Avdeev. What prevented Leskov from getting any higher, the critic argued, were &quot;his love of hyperbole&quot; and what he termed &quot;an overload of spices.&quot; At the time of his death in 1895 Leskov &quot;had few friends in literary circles but a great many readers all over Russia,&quot; according to Mirsky.

In 1897 The Adolf Marks publishing house re-issued the 1889–1893 12-volume series and in 1902–1903 released the 36-volume version of it, expanded with essays, articles and letters. This, along with Anatoly Faresov&#x27;s memoirs, &quot;Against the Grain&quot; (1904), caused a new wave of interest in Leskov&#x27;s legacy. In 1923 three volumes of Nikolai Leskov&#x27;s selected works came out in Berlin, featuring an often-quoted rapturous preface by Maxim Gorky (who called Leskov &quot;the wizard of wording&quot;), and was re-issued in the USSR in early 1941.

For decades after his death the attitude of critics toward Leskov and his legacy varied. Despite the fact that some of his sharpest satires could be published only after the 1917 Revolution, Soviet literary propaganda found little of use in Leskov&#x27;s legacy, often labeling the author a &quot;reactionary&quot; who had &quot;denied the possibility of social revolution,&quot; placing too much attention on saintly religious types. For highlighting the author&#x27;s &#x27;progressive&#x27; inclinations &quot;Leftie&quot; (a &quot;glorification of Russian inventiveness and talent&quot;) and &quot;The Toupee Artist&quot; (a &quot;denunciation of the repressive nature of Tsarist Russia&quot;) were invariably chosen. &quot;He is a brilliant author, an insightful scholar of our ways of life, and still he&#x27;s not being given enough credit&quot;, Maxim Gorky wrote in 1928, deploring the fact that after the 1917 Revolution Leskov was still failing to gain ground in his homeland as a major classic.

The inability of the new literary ideologists to counterbalance demands of propaganda with attempts at objectivity was evidenced in the 1932 Soviet Literary Encyclopedia entry, which said: &quot;In our times when the problem-highlighting type of novel has gained prominence, opening up new horizons for socialism and construction, Leskov&#x27;s relevancy as a writer, totally foreign to the major tendencies of our Soviet literature, naturally wanes. The author of &quot;Lefty&quot;, though, retains some significance as a chronicler of his social environment and one of the best masters of Russian prose.&quot; Nevertheless, by 1934 Dmitry Shostakovich had finished his opera, &quot;Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District&quot;, which caused a furore at home and abroad (to be eventually denounced in 1936 by &quot;Pravda&quot;). Before that, in 1929, Ivan Shyshov&#x27;s opera &quot;The Toupee Artist&quot; (after Leskov&#x27;s story of the same name) had been published and successfully staged.

In the post-World War II USSR the interest in Leskov&#x27;s legacy was continually on the rise, never going, though, beyond certain censorship-set limits. Several scholarly essays came out and then an extensive biography by the writer&#x27;s son Andrey Leskov was published in 1954. In 1953 the &quot;Complete Gorky&quot; series featured his 1923 N. S. Leskov essay which became the object of lively academic discussion. The 11-volume 1956–1958 (and then 6 volume 1973–1974) &quot;Complete Leskov&quot; editions were obviously incomplete: one of his political &quot;anti-nihilistic&quot; novels &quot;At Daggers Drawn&quot;, was missing, included essays and letters carefully selected. Yet, in fifty years&#x27; time things changed radically. While in 1931, on Leskov&#x27;s 100th Anniversary, critics wrote of the &quot;scandalous reputation which followed Leskov&#x27;s literary life from beginning to the end,&quot; by 1981 Leskov, according to the critic Lev Anninsky, was regarded as a first rank Russian classic and academic essays on him had found their place in the Moscow University&#x27;s new course between those on Dostoevsky and Leo Tolstoy. In 1989 &quot;Ogonyok&quot; re-issued the 12-volume Leskov collection in which &quot;At Daggers Drawn&quot; appeared for the first time in the USSR.

In 1996 the Terra publishing house in Russia started a 30 volume Leskov series, declaring the intention to include every single work or letter by the author, but by 2007 only 10 volumes of it had come out. The &quot;Literaturnoye nasledstvo&quot; publishers started the &quot;Unpublished Leskov&quot; series: book one (fiction) came out in 1991, book two (letters and articles) – in 2000; both were incomplete, and the volume six material, which had been banned a century ago and proved to be too tough for the Soviet censors, was again neglected. All 36 volumes of the 1902 Marks &quot;Complete Leskov&quot; were re-issued in 2002 and Moshkov&#x27;s On-line Library gathered a significant part of Leskov&#x27;s legacy, including his most controversial novels and essays.

===Social and religious stance===

In retrospect, the majority of Leskov&#x27;s legacy, documentary in essence, could be seen as part of the 19th century raznochintsy literature which relied upon the &#x27;real life sketch&#x27; as a founding genre. But, while Gleb Uspensky, Vasily Sleptsov and Fyodor Reshetnikov were preaching &quot;the urgent need to study the real life of the common people,&quot; Leskov was caustic in his scorn: &quot;Never could I understand this popular idea among our publicists of &#x27;studying&#x27; the life of the common people, for I felt it would be more natural for a writer to &#x27;live&#x27; this kind of life, rather than &#x27;study&#x27; it,&quot; he remarked. With his thorough knowledge of the Russian provinces, competence in every nuance of the industrial, agricultural and religious spheres, including obscure regional, sectarian or ethnic nuances, Leskov regarded his colleagues on the radical left as cabinet theoreticians, totally rootless in their &quot;studies&quot;. Leskov was not indifferent to social injustice, according to Bukhstab. &quot;It was just that he viewed social problems as a strict practitioner for whom only personal experience was worthy of trust while none of the theories based on philosophical doctrines held water. Unlike the Social Democrats, Leskov neither believed in the possibility of an agrarian revolution in Russia, nor wanted it to happen, seeing education and enlightenment, often of religious nature, as the factors for social improvement,&quot; wrote the biographer.

On the other hand, he had very little in common with Russian literary aristocrats. According to D. S. Mirsky, Leskov was &quot;one of those Russian writers whose knowledge of life was not founded on the possession of serfs, to be later modified by university theories of French or German origin, like Turgenev&#x27;s and Tolstoy&#x27;s, but on practical and independent experience. This is why his view of Russian life is so unconventional and so free from that attitude of condescending and sentimental pity for the peasant which is typical of the liberal and educated serf-owner.&quot; Mirsky expressed bewilderment at how Leskov, after his first novel &quot;No Way Out&quot;, could have been seriously regarded as a &#x27;vile and libelous reactionary&#x27;, when in reality (according to the critic) &quot;the principal socialist characters in the book were represented as little short of saints.&quot;

Some modern scholars argue that, contrary to what his contemporary detractors said, Leskov had not held &quot;reactionary&quot; or even &quot;conservative&quot; sensibilities and his outlook was basically that of a democratic enlightener, who placed great hopes upon the 1861 social reform and became deeply disillusioned soon afterwards. The post-serfdom anachronisms that permeated Russian life in every aspect, became one of his basic themes. Unlike Dostoevsky, who saw the greatest danger in the development of capitalism in Russia, Leskov regarded the &quot;immovability of Russia&#x27;s &#x27;old ways&#x27; as its main liability,&quot; critic Viduetskaya insisted. Leskov&#x27;s attitude towards &#x27;revolutionaries&#x27; was never entirely negative, this critic argued; it&#x27;s just that he saw them as totally unprepared for the mission they were trying to take upon themselves, this tragic incongruity being the leitmotif of many of his best known works; (&quot;The Musk-Ox&quot;, &quot;Mystery Man&quot;, &quot;The Passed By&quot;, &quot;At Daggers Drawn&quot;).

In 1891, after Mikhail Protopopov&#x27;s article &quot;The Sick Talent&quot; was published, Leskov responded with a letter of gratitude, pointing out: &quot;You&#x27;ve judged me better than those who wrote of me in the past. Yet historical context should be taken into account too. Class prejudices and false piety, religious stereotypes, nationalistic narrow-mindedness, what with having to defend the state with its glory... I grew up amidst all of this, and I was sometimes abhorred by it all... still I couldn&#x27;t see the [true Christianity&#x27;s guiding] light.&quot;

Like Tolstoy and Dostoevsky, Leskov saw the Gospel as the moral codex for humanity, the guiding light of its development and an ideological basis for any progress. His &quot;saintly&quot; gallery of characters propagated the same idea of &quot;multiplying what was good all over the land.&quot; On the other hand, the author often used religious plots to highlight contemporary problems, often in the most frivolous manner. Some of his stories, Christian on the face of it, were, according to Viduetskaya, &quot;pagan in spirit, especially next to the ascetic Tolstoy&#x27;s prose of the similar kind.&quot; Intrigued by the Raskol movement with its history and current trends, Leskov never agreed with those of his collaugues (Afanasy Shchapov among them) who saw Raskol communities as a potentially revolutionary force and shared the views of Melnikov-Pechersky concerning Old Believers.

In his latter years Leskov came under the influence of Leo Tolstoy, developing the concept of &quot;new Christianity&quot; he himself identified with the latter. &quot;I am in total harmony with him, and there&#x27;s not a single person in the whole world who&#x27;s more dear to me. Things I don&#x27;t share with him never bother me; what I cherish is the general state of his soul, as it were, and his mind&#x27;s frightful insightfulness,&quot; Leskov wrote in another letter, to Vladimir Chertkov.

As D.S. Mirsky pointed out, Leskov&#x27;s Christianity, like that of Tolstoy, was &quot;anti-clerical, undenominational and purely ethical.&quot; But there, the critic argued, the similarities ended. &quot;The dominant ethical note is different. It is the cult not of moral purity and of reason, but of humility and charity. &quot;Spiritual pride&quot;, self-conscious righteousness is for Leskov the greatest of crimes. Active charity is for him the principal virtue, and he attaches very little value to moral purity, still less to physical purity... [The] feeling of sin as the necessary soil for sanctity and the condemnation of self-righteous pride as a sin against the Holy Ghost is intimately akin to the moral sense of the Russian people and of the Eastern church, and very different from Tolstoy&#x27;s proud Protestant and Luciferian ideas of perfection&quot;, Mirsky wrote.

===Style and form===

Not long before his death, Leskov reportedly said: &quot;Now they read me just for the intricacies of my stories, but in fifty years&#x27; time the beauty of it all will fade and only the ideas my books contain will retain value.&quot; That, according to Mirsky, was an exceptionally ill-judged forecast. &quot;Now more than ever Leskov is being read and praised for his inimitable form, style and manner of speech,&quot; the critic wrote in 1926. Many critics and colleagues of Leskov wrote about his innovative style and experiments in form. Anton Chekhov called him and Turgenev his two &quot;tutors in literature.&quot;

According to Bukhstab, it was Leskov whose works Chekhov used as a template for mastering his technique of constructing short stories, marveling at their density and concentration, but also at their author&#x27;s ability to make a reader share his views without imposing them, using subtle irony as an instrument. Tellingly, Leskov was the first of the major Russian authors to notice Chekhov&#x27;s debut and predict his future rise. Leo Tolstoy (while still expressing reservations as to the &quot;overabundance of colours&quot;) called Leskov &quot;a writer for the future.&quot;

Maxim Gorky was another great admirer of Leskov&#x27;s prose, seeing him as one of the few figures in 19th century Russian literature who had both ideas of their own and the courage to speak them out loud. Gorky linked Leskov to the elite of Russian literary thinkers (Dostoyevsky, Pisemsky, Goncharov and Turgenev) who &quot;formed more or less firm and distinct views on the history of Russia and developed their own way of working within its culture.&quot; 20th century critics credited Leskov with being an innovator who used the art of wording in a totally new and different manner, increasing the functional scope of phrasing, making it a precision instrument for drawing the nuances of human character. According to Gorky, unlike Tolstoy, Gogol, Turgenev or Goncharov who created &quot;portraits set in landscapes,&quot; Leskov painted his backgrounds unobtrusively by &quot;simply telling his stories,&quot; being a true master of &quot;weaving a nervous fabric of lively Russian common talk,&quot; and &quot;in this art had no equals.&quot;

Gorky saw Leskov as a true artist whose place &quot;beside masters like L. Tolstoy, Gogol, Turgenev and Goncharov is well-deserved&quot;. He was greatly intrigued by the way Leskov managed to secure himself total independence in the community where no such thing seemed possible (&quot;he was neither Narodnik nor Slavophile, neither Westernizer, nor liberal or conservative&quot;) and, at the same time, developed &quot;deep insight into the life of the existing classes and social groups of Russia... something none of his greater contemporaries like Tolstoy or Turgenev, could ever do&quot;. &quot;... It was Leskov who dissected Rus thoroughly,&quot; Gorky said (through his character Klim Samgin), later explaining: &quot;Leskov was... the only Russian author to have succeeded in separating the whole generation of his countrymen into a new set of sub-classes, each belonging to a different epoch.&quot; Gorky mentioned Leskov among authors that had helped him form his own style and outlook. &quot;It was partly under Leskov&#x27;s influence that I decided to go out and see how real people lived,&quot; he wrote. &quot;Leskov influenced me enormously, with his knowledge of the Russian language and its richness,&quot; Gorky remarked in another letter.

Leskov was continuously experimenting with forms, his most favourable being &quot;the chronicle&quot; which he saw as a healthy alternative to orthodox novel. &quot;Things pass by us and I&#x27;m not going to diminish or boost their respective significance; I won&#x27;t be forced into doing so by the unnatural, man-made format of the novel which demands the rounding up of fabulas and the drawing together of plotlines to one central course. That&#x27;s not how life is. Human life runs on in its own way and that&#x27;s how I&#x27;m going to treat the roll of events in my works,&quot; he once wrote. Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary&#x27;s biographer Semyon Vengerov found in Leskov traits common to Alexander Ostrovsky, Aleksey Pisemsky and Fyodor Dostoevsky. &quot;But the most astounding feature in him is what Turgenev called his &#x27;inventiveness&#x27;. Some of Leskov&#x27;s 5–6 page stories are packed with plotlines that could have filled volumes. This is especially true for &quot;The Enchanted Wanderer&quot; where each new turn brings out another fascinating scene, with its own new set of colours. Apart from his large anti-nihilistic novels (&quot;No Way Out&quot;, &quot;At Daggers Drawn&quot;), less successful artistically, Leskov&#x27;s prose is remarkably concise and totally devoid of filler and ballast,&quot; Vengerov added.

The major issue contemporary critics had with Leskov&#x27;s prose was what they perceived to be an &quot;overabundance of colours&quot;; the grotesque expressiveness of the language he used. This view was shared by some of his colleagues. Leo Tolstoy who rated Leskov very high still thought he was &quot;too over the top&quot; in his linguistic experiments. In a December 3, 1890, letter, writing of the short story &quot;The Hour of God&#x27;s Will&quot;, he remarked: &quot;This fairytale is excellent, but it would have been much better if not for this overabundance of talent.&quot; Leskov was unrepentant. &quot;To write in a simple manner as Lev Nikolayevich does, is beyond me. Such a gift is not mine... take me as I am, for I&#x27;ve gotten used to polishing my stuff and simply cannot work in any other way,&quot; he wrote to Chertkov in one of his 1888 letters. &quot;My clergymen talk like clergymen do, and my muzhiks talk like muzhiks talk in real life... this folkish, vulgar and intricate language is not of my invention, I&#x27;ve listened for years to Russian people talking... and I can say that in my books they talk like they do in real life, not in literary fashion,&quot; he insisted later, speaking to biographer Anatoly Faresov.

Contemporary critics often dismissed Leskov as a mere &quot;anecdote collector&quot;. Years later scholars found a uniqueness in Leskov&#x27;s prose mostly in that it was almost entirely based on anecdotes; bizarre or absurd real life events. Some of his collections, like &quot;Notes of a Stranger&quot; (1884) and &quot;Trifles from the Life of Archbishops&quot; (1878–79) &quot;were nothing but collections of anecdotes, a fact which made them no less powerful, expressive pieces of prose,&quot; critic E. Viduetskaya argued. Leskov, who liked to unite his stories and sketches into cycles (&quot;The Voice of Nature&quot; (1883), &quot;The Uniters&quot; (1884), &quot;Aleksandrit&quot; (1885), a series of Christmas stories (1881–1885), etc.) has been credited with creating a comprehensive picture of contemporary Russian society using mostly short literary forms.

Enchanted by the ways of life, customs and habits of different, often obscure, ethnic and social groups in Russia, but (unlike Chekhov and Pisemsky who were interested in tendencies) focusing on the bizarre and strange elements of it, Leskov was helped by the unique linguistic memory he&#x27;d been endowed with. A profound analysis of Russia through its language was for him a major aim. &quot;The author develops his own voice by learning how to make the voices of his characters his own&quot;, he remarked, adding: &quot;A man shows his character best in the smallest things.&quot; 

&quot;I prefer to build a story upon a real fact, not fiction,&quot; he once remarked. This had to do more with his own concept of literature as a branch of history, in other words, being an intrinsically documentary art form. He attributed great social importance to history, seeing it as a major factor in healthy social development. Most of Leskov&#x27;s characters had real life prototypes, while some of them bore the names of real persons (&quot;Cadet Monastery&quot;, &quot;A Man at the Guard&quot;, &quot;Vladyka&#x27;s Judgment&quot;, &quot;Penniless Engineers&quot;, etc.) &quot;Truth can indeed be made to be more thrilling than fiction, and you surely are the master of this art,&quot; Leo Tolstoy wrote Leskov in a letter. &quot;The Russian people acknowledge Leskov as the Most Russian of all Russian writers; a man who knew the Russian people better and more deeply than anybody else,&quot; Mirsky maintained.

Explaining why Leskov had not yet come into his own with English-speaking readers, in spite of the admiration for him of some English critics, like Maurice Baring, Mirsky wrote in 1926: &quot;The Anglo-Saxon public have made up their minds as to what they want from a Russian writer, and Leskov does not fit into that idea. But those who really want to know more about Russians sooner or later recognize that Russia is not all contained in Dostoyevsky and Chekhov, and that if you want to know anything, you must first be free of prejudice and on your guard against hasty generalizations.&quot;

<text>The Tamiya Blackfoot was a 1/10-scale, electric radio controlled model monster truck produced by the Tamiya Corporation of Japan. It was released October 8, 1986 and produced through 1993.

== Importance ==

Available only in kit form less the necessary radio equipment, battery pack and charger, the Blackfoot was one of the most notable contributions to the growing radio controlled model car hobby due to its relatively inexpensive purchase cost, ease of assembly, an excellent instruction manual, and wide availability of both factory and aftermarket parts to improve performance and durability as well as to simplify and expedite inevitable repairs.

== Basis and variations ==

The model&#x27;s space frame chassis was molded from ABS engineering resin and was identical other than color to the Tamiya R/C dune buggy on which the Blackfoot was based, &quot;The Frog.&quot; The Frog&#x27;s main chassis parts are grey while the Blackfoot&#x27;s are bright red, presumably since the chassis was far more visible on the Blackfoot. The highly detailed styrene body was that of a Ford F-150 Flareside pickup, itself a carryover from an earlier Tamiya Ford F-150 model based on the SRB-chassis (Special Racing Buggy). Two other similar early releases were given the &quot;monster treatment&quot; as well. The &quot;Monster Beetle&quot; was topped with a replica of a Volkswagen &quot;Baja Bug&quot; while the &quot;Mud Blaster&quot; was a Subaru BRAT sport truck. Mechanically identical to the Blackfoot, the only other differences in these two models besides the bodies and body mounts were plastic wheels vacuum-plated in a golden finish, the inclusion of rubber-spiked tires for slightly improved off-road traction, a metal bracket to support the servo saver and oil-filled, coilover shock absorbers. Also, the Monster Beetle included a combined gearbox skid plate and rear bumper, as well as 2 ball bearings at the differential output points. The retail price of the Monster Beetle and Mud Blaster was about twenty percent higher than that of the Blackfoot, mostly due to the improved shocks. The Blackfoot&#x27;s inclusion of simple coilover &quot;shocks&quot; less the benefit of oil dampening kept the initial cost of the kit down. Since the oil-filled units were available separately in kit form, Blackfoot owners could easily upgrade once their budget allowed.

== Problems and solutions == 

As rugged as the Blackfoot and its variants were, the design suffered from a number of problems with its drivetrain. Its hexagonal-shaped &quot;dogbone&quot; axles, while allowing for an independent rear suspension, were extremely prone to wear because of the oversized wheels and tires as was the nylon and pot metal-geared differential. The Re=release versions of the newer ORV chassis cars received updated axles and area a huge improvement. The re-release Frog got dogbone style axles, and the Monster Beetle, and Blackfoot re-releases got a CVD style axle. The pot metal parts generally wore out before the nylon parts did. This was attributed to the soft aluminum side plates of the transmission, allowing the differentials bevel gears to flex outwards under load, minimizing gear tooth contact with the differentials spider gears, resulting in the dreaded differential &quot;Clicking&quot; as the gears would skip teeth under load. This was commonly patched by installing 5mm I.D. shims between the bevel gears and differential output bearings (The Monster Beetle had differential bearings stock, The Blackfoot had to be upgraded to ball bearings to do this modification, as side loaded bushings would just get destroyed in a short period). The best known to date upgrade to fix the differential problems is solved by using the &quot;MIP Ball Differential Kit&quot; (MIP Part# 16210), note that is must be used with the re-release axles, and not the original hex drive axles. Miniature ball bearings were an extra cost option to replace the nylon bushings packed with the model for both the transmission and wheels, but were a necessity since rapid wear of the bushings meant a complete overhaul of the transmission and partial disassembly of the rear suspension unless the kit was assembled with bearings from the outset. The expensive, heavy plastic bodies (with a replacement cost roughly half the price of an entire kit) made the model prone to rollover, eventually resulting in a badly scratched, unattractive replica. The tires themselves, even the spiked ones, were basically unsuitable for the off-road situations that the kit was intended for. Several R/C companies rose to the challenge, especially four Southern California companies: MRP, Pro-Line, Thorp Corporation and Robinson Racing. MRP specialized in heavy-duty modified parts, Pro-Line was (and is) a highly regarded manufacturer of R/C wheels, tires and bodies while Thorp and Robinson engineered expensive but rugged differentials and axles, allowing the use of much more powerful, R/C-specific motors than the Mabuchi RS-540 shipped with the kit; this motor was originally designed for use in heavy-duty computer printers. A North Royalton, Ohio-based company, Parma Corporation, made a series of replacement bodies vacuum-formed in lightweight, clear polycarbonate plastic including a direct replacement whose tooling was made from an original styrene body.

== The Blackfoot today ==

Tamiya has marketed several updated version of the Blackfoot. The Super Blackfoot was based on the same basic space frame chassis, with the most important improvements being a better gearbox and double wishbone rear suspension with dogbone driveshafts instead of the original&#x27;s vulnerable and quickly wearing ORV-type gearbox, trailing arm suspension and hex type drive shafts and sockets. The body was basically the same as that of the Blackfoot, but with a different grill design and new decals. Later, the Super Blackfoot was replaced by the King Blackfoot, this time with an improved front suspension with longer suspension arms. The styrene body for the King Blackfoot was still clearly derived from a Ford design, but no longer identified as being a Ford by Tamiya and a totally new development. Tamiya currently (2005) markets a completely updated model called the &quot;Blackfoot Xtreme.&quot; The &quot;Xtreme&quot; has a totally different chassis design than previous versions, but retains the body of the King Blackfoot, just mildly modified with a hood scoop, a modernized grill and new decals. The BX is the final incarnation of the Blackfoot name. The &quot;Xtreme&quot; can even be modified for 4WD with the addition of a front gearbox and a second motor. As a matter of fact, Tamiya markets the 4WD &quot;Wild Dagger&quot;, 4WD &quot;Twin Detonator&quot;, and the 4WD &quot;Double Blaze&quot; all based on the same basic chassis as the &quot;Xtreme&quot;.

The original Blackfoot is out of production, but its parts and aftermarket accessories remain popular with collectors. As for the aftermarket manufacturers, Robinson, Parma and Pro-Line are still in business producing R/C parts; MRP is focused on the production of R/C powerboats and Thorp, who had changed their focus to the production of emergency medical equipment, appear to be out of business.

In 1987 Tamiya released a WILD Mini 4WD version of the Blackfoot, called &quot;Blackfoot Jr.&quot; It was the second model in the WILD Mini 4WD series. It has long since been discontinued.

In 2012 Tamiya Released a new version of the Blackfoot called the Blackfoot III, it shares no parts with the older &quot;ORV&quot; chassis but the body is an original reproduction with some updates.

In May 2016 Tamiya announced they will Re-Release the original 1986 Blackfoot with some minor changes to the body and drivetrain.

<text>Eleanor Irene Clift (&quot;née&quot; Roeloffs; born July 7, 1940) is an American political journalist, television pundit, and author. She is a contributor to MSNBC and blogger for &quot;The Daily Beast&quot;. She is best known as a regular panelist on &quot;The McLaughlin Group&quot;. Clift is a board member at the IWMF (International Women&#x27;s Media Foundation).

==Early years==
Eleanor Roeloffs was born in the New York City borough of Brooklyn, the daughter of German immigrants from the island of Föhr in the North Sea. She grew up in the Jackson Heights neighborhood of Queens, where her parents ran a delicatessen in Sunnyside. Clift was raised a Lutheran. She attended both Hofstra University and Hunter College, but left both schools without a degree.

==Journalism career==
Clift began her career in 1963 as a secretary at &quot;Newsweek&quot;, and was one of the first female reporters to earn an internship from the secretary pool. Working out of Atlanta, Clift became the reporter assigned to cover the then-unlikely candidate, Jimmy Carter. Clift traveled with the campaign and reported from the road. After Carter&#x27;s win, Clift became White House correspondent for &quot;Newsweek&quot; and has covered every presidential campaign for the magazine since 1976. When Newsweek merged with &quot;The Daily Beast&quot; in 2010, Clift stayed on to cover politics for the online publication.

==Broadcasting career==
She began a broadcast career on &quot;The Diane Rehm Show&quot; on WAMU-FM, Washington, D.C., as a Friday week-in-review panelist. She became known to listeners for her good-natured acceptance of ribbing from other panelists and callers to the program.

She became a regular panelist on the nationally syndicated show &quot;The McLaughlin Group&quot;, which she has compared to &quot;a televised food fight&quot;.

Her role as a talk show panelist has led to appearances in movies. Clift played a panelist in &quot;Rising Sun&quot; (1993) and appeared as herself in &quot;Dave&quot; (1993), &quot;Independence Day&quot; (1996) and &quot;Getting Away with Murder&quot; (1996). She was portrayed by Jan Hooks on Saturday Night Live. She was also portrayed by actress Mary Ann Burger in the 2009 film &quot;Watchmen&quot;.

In 2008, she wrote &quot;Two Weeks of Life: A Memoir of Love, Death, and Politics&quot;, which intertwines the events of her own life and those of the nation concerning the Terri Schiavo case during a two-week period in March 2005. In it she examines the way people in the United States deal with death, publicity and personality.

She was a keynote speaker at the 2012 Washington &amp; Jefferson College Energy Summit, where the Washington &amp; Jefferson College Energy Index was unveiled.

Contributing to the anthology &quot;Our American Story&quot; (2019), Clift addressed the possibility of a shared American narrative and focused on America as a social movement, writing, &quot;[S]ocial movements are America&#x27;s story, and they&#x27;re my story as a woman born in the middle of the last century whose life was made measurably better amid these broad strokes of history.&quot;

===Honors===
*Hoover Institution William and Barbara Edwards Media Fellow September 16–22, 2002

==Personal life==
Clift married William Brooks Clift Jr. (1919–1986), the older brother of actor Montgomery Clift, in 1964; they had three sons before divorcing in 1981. In 1989, Clift married Tom Brazaitis, a Washington columnist for &quot;The Plain Dealer&quot; in Cleveland, Ohio. They remained together until his death from kidney cancer in 2005.

<text>The Terminator, also known as a Cyberdyne Systems Model 101 or T-800, is the name of several film characters from the &quot;Terminator&quot; franchise portrayed by Arnold Schwarzenegger. The Terminator himself is part of a series of machines created by Skynet, an artificial intelligence, for infiltration-based surveillance and assassination missions. While an android for his appearance, he is usually described as a cyborg consisting of living tissue over a robotic endoskeleton.

The first appearance of the Terminator was as the eponymous main antagonist in &quot;The Terminator&quot;, a 1984 film directed and co-written by James Cameron. While the original Terminator was destroyed, other machines with the same appearance are featured in the sequels. In &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot; (1991) and &quot;Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines&quot; (2003), Schwarzenegger&#x27;s Terminator serves as the main protagonist, while in &quot;Terminator Genisys&quot; (2015) and &quot;&quot; (2019), he serves as a supporting protagonist, and is pitted against other Terminators sent by Skynet and its successor Legion. 

In &quot;Terminator Salvation&quot; (2009) and &quot;Dark Fate&quot;, the character also appears briefly as an antagonist. In the context of the stories, the plot device of having various robots looking the same provides a certain continuity for the human characters by exploiting their emotional familiarity with a particular &quot;human&quot; visage associated with each &quot;model&quot;. The &quot;Terminator&quot; title is also used as a generic name for other human-simulating characters in the &quot;Terminator&quot; franchise, such as the liquid-metal T-1000 antagonist in &quot;Judgment Day&quot;.

The Terminator is Schwarzenegger&#x27;s best-known role, and resulted in two catchphrases, &quot;I&#x27;ll be back&quot; and &quot;Hasta la vista, baby&quot;, used in the first and second film respectively.

==Fictional background==
A Terminator is an infiltration-based assassin, described in the films as a cybernetic organism. They are built in the future by Skynet, an artificial intelligence engaged in a war against humans. Often known as a T-800, the T-800 series is preceded by an earlier model known as the T-600 series, which used artificial rubber skin and was easily spotted by members of the human resistance.

T-800 models are all identical in appearance: a muscular, male human exterior made up of living tissue, covering a metal endoskeleton actuated by a powerful network of hydraulic servomechanisms, which provide superhuman strength. In the &quot;Terminator&quot; sequels, armies of skinless T-800 endoskeletons are shown to be used by Skynet during future war sequences, serving as soldiers rather than infiltrators. With the exterior appearance applied, they are the first Terminator model capable of blending in with humans; as a result, the resistance began using dogs to detect them.

In the first film, a Terminator time travels from 2029 to 1984 to alter the past by killing Sarah Connor, retroactively ensuring victory for Skynet. Kyle Reese, a future soldier sent back to stop the Terminator, describes the latter as such:

:&quot;The Terminator is an infiltration unit, part man – part machine. Underneath it&#x27;s a hyperalloy combat chassis, microprocessor-controlled, fully armored, very tough. But outside it&#x27;s living human tissue. Flesh, skin, hair, blood, grown for the cyborgs.&quot;

The skin is prone to aging and injury related deterioration, but can heal itself with enough time. According to early drafts for the original film, a Terminator must consume small amounts of food to maintain the human skin, a detail that is absent in the finished film.

A Terminator can withstand normal 20th century firearms, crash through walls with little to no damage, and survive explosions to some degree. Repeated shotgun blasts have enough force to knock down and temporarily disable the cyborg, while heavy amounts of automatic fire are able to compromise the organic disguise layer. Terminators can continue functioning even after losing one or more limbs. Reese describes the Terminator&#x27;s relentlessness to Sarah in the first film:

:&quot;It can&#x27;t be bargained with. It can&#x27;t be reasoned with. It doesn&#x27;t feel pity, or remorse, or fear! And it absolutely will not stop, ever, until you are dead!

The Terminator&#x27;s CPU is an artificial neural network with the ability to learn and adapt. For instance, in the original film, he learns how to swear from a group of punks it encounters. In &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot;, the character states, &quot;The more contact I have with humans, the more I learn.&quot; A deleted scene from the second film, restored in the Special Edition, provides more backstory on the Terminator&#x27;s learning ability; the character says that Terminators are set to read-only, a measure taken by Skynet to prevent them from &quot;thinking too much&quot;. Sarah and John then activate his learning ability, after which he becomes more curious and begins trying to understand and imitate human behavior. He ultimately learns &quot;the value of human life&quot; as mused by Sarah in the closing narration of the theatrical cut. Later films in the series further humanize the character.
Throughout the series, the Terminator is typically depicted wearing sunglasses and a leather jacket. Another trait persistent throughout the series is the faint red glow of the &quot;eyes&quot; when the cyborg is online; the lack of the glow has been used to show when one is out of action. The Terminator has an Austrian accent but can also copy the voice of others.

In the second film, the Terminator states that he can operate for 120 years on his power cell. In the third film, the Terminator is slightly modified, operating on two hydrogen fuel cells; when damaged, these explode with enough force to produce a small mushroom cloud. This iteration of the character also has an understanding of basic psychology.

===Nomenclature===
Commonly known as the Terminator, the character is also given more specific designations, which help distinguish from other mass-produced Terminators seen in each of the sequels.

In the first two films and &quot;&quot;, the character is referred to as a &quot;Cyberdyne Systems Model 101&quot;, referencing the Cyberdyne Systems company which created Skynet. In &quot;Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines&quot; (&quot;T3&quot;), he is referred to as a &quot;T-101&quot;. This name also occurs throughout the &quot;T2&quot; novels. A slight variation, &quot;T101&quot;, was used as early as 1991, in the Amstrad CPC and ZX Spectrum versions of the &quot;Terminator 2&quot; computer game.

The name &quot;T-800&quot; had been used off-screen in news articles and reviews for &quot;Terminator 2&quot;, differentiating from the film&#x27;s other Terminator character, the T-1000. The T-800&#x27;s heads-up display in the film specifically identifies him as a &quot;Cyberdyne Systems Series 800 Model 101 Version 2.4&quot;. The novelization of the third film refers to the character by a different designation: a T-850 rather than a T-101, described as a newer, upgraded version of the T-800. Both T-800 and T-850 were used in merchandising for the film series. &quot;Terminator Salvation&quot; has the first on-screen usage of the term T-800, which is also used in &quot;Terminator Genisys&quot;.

Because the Terminator is portrayed by Arnold Schwarzenegger, the character is sometimes referred to as the Arnold Terminator, distinguishing from other Terminators played by different actors. Some of the Terminators portrayed by Schwarzenegger are also given on-screen nicknames. In &quot;Terminator 2&quot;, John Connor introduces the Model 101 to his mother&#x27;s friends as his &quot;Uncle Bob&quot;. In &quot;Terminator Genisys&quot;, Sarah Connor refers to the T-800 as &quot;Pops&quot;, while the end credits list him as &quot;Guardian&quot;. In &quot;Terminator: Dark Fate&quot;, the character goes by the name &quot;Carl&quot;.

In the &quot;Terminator 2&quot; DVD commentary, director and franchise creator James Cameron states that all Model 101s look like Schwarzenegger, with a 102 resembling someone else, leading to fan speculation that the 101 refers to the physical appearance while the 800 refers to the endoskeleton common to many models.

===Character origin===
The origin of the Terminator&#x27;s physical and vocal templates is provided in the 2001 novel &quot;T2: Infiltrator&quot;, in the form of former counter-terrorist Dieter von Rossbach, who meets and joins forces with the Connors in the present. The novel reveals that he was never questioned about the Terminators&#x27; actions, as his superiors always knew that he was somewhere else during the rampages. The reason stated for copying Dieter was that Skynet was looking in the old military files for someone whose body could effectively conceal the Terminator&#x27;s massive endoskeleton. The voice was provided through Kurt Viemeister, the scientist that taught Skynet its sentience.

A different origin is provided in a humorous deleted scene for &quot;Terminator 3&quot;, removed by director Jonathan Mostow who found it too comedic. In the scene, the Terminator&#x27;s human appearance is said to be based on that of Chief Master Sergeant William Candy, also portrayed by Schwarzenegger but with a dubbed-over Southern accent, which would be replaced in-universe by the more menacing Austrian-accented voice of one of the developers.

When asked in 2017 why all T-800s look the same, Cameron suggested that Skynet had harvested the DNA from a human who had the same appearance, stating &quot;it has flashed through my mind that there has to have been a prototype. [...] Now, the question is, did that person have some sort of meaning to Skynet on &quot;why&quot; they chose that one? Or was it like a whole rack of Terminators and the one that happened to be the Arnold model just happened to be closest to the door going out to the time displacement center and all the others looked different? I&#x27;ve asked myself these questions but it&#x27;s never been resolved&quot;.

==Appearances==
The Terminator appears in all six films of the franchise, each one featuring a different individual with the same likeness. The Terminator is an antagonist in the original film, and generally portrayed as a protagonist in the sequels. Every iteration of the character is destroyed at the end of each film, with the exception of &quot;Terminator Genisys&quot;.

=== &quot;The Terminator&quot; (1984) ===

The Model 101 is sent back in time from 2029 to 1984 to terminate Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), thereby preventing the birth of her son, John Connor, the future leader of the Human Resistance. Lack of surviving records in the future meant that he was limited to only knowing Sarah&#x27;s name and that she lived in Los Angeles at the time, with the result that he killed two other Sarah Connors in the city before finding his target. This allows Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn), a soldier sent from 2029 to protect Sarah, to find her before the Terminator does. 

During several skirmishes, the Terminator withstands contemporary gunfire with only superficial damage to his exterior tissue. He is later caught in a fuel tanker explosion, burning away his flesh covering to expose his mechanical nature and causing minor damage to one of his legs, slowing him down. Kyle sacrifices himself to damage the Terminator with a pipe bomb that destroys his legs, and Sarah crushes the remaining endoskeleton in a hydraulic press to shut him down permanently.

=== &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot; (1991) ===

A Model 101 is reprogrammed by the future John Connor (Michael Edwards), and sent back to 1995 to protect young John (Edward Furlong) from a T-1000 (Robert Patrick), an advanced shapeshifting Terminator made of liquid metal that has been dispatched to kill him. The Model 101 is programmed to follow John&#x27;s orders and works with the Connors to prevent Judgment Day; John also prohibits him from killing innocent humans who stand in their way, so the cyborg instead uses non-lethal force. During his time with the Connors, this Model 101 is taught how to speak in slang-like terms, such as &quot;Hasta la vista, baby&quot;, and encouraged to act more human, to the point that he develops into an almost fatherly role for John. Sarah reflects that the Model 101 is the first male figure John has ever had in his life who can be guaranteed to always be there for him.

The T-1000 chases the trio into a steel mill and overpowers the Model 101 in hand-to-hand combat, impaling him through the chest and destroying his main power supply. However, the Model 101 activates a backup power source, frees himself, and blasts the T-1000 into a vat of molten steel with a grenade launcher to destroy him.

Prior to the film&#x27;s events, Cyberdyne Systems had recovered a forearm and the damaged CPU chip from the Terminator in 1984 and used those components to radically advance its research and technology, which will eventually lead to the creation of Skynet in 1997. In &quot;Terminator 2&quot;, John steals the items from Cyberdyne&#x27;s research lab and later throws them into the vat to destroy them. Because he cannot self-terminate, the Model 101 has Sarah lower him into the steel in order to destroy his CPU as well and thus prevent the technology from being used to create Skynet.

=== &quot;Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines&quot; (2003) ===
Despite the events of the second film, Judgment Day was merely delayed. A T-101 Terminator is eventually reprogrammed by the human resistance and sent to the 2000s, this time to protect John Connor (Nick Stahl) and his future wife Kate Brewster (Claire Danes) from Skynet&#x27;s T-X (Kristanna Loken), which is also designed to destroy other Terminators. The T-101 is powered by two hydrogen fuel cells, one of which he discards after being damaged by the T-X. 

Eventually, the T-X uses her nanites to take control of the T-101&#x27;s autonomous functions, sending him to kill John and Kate. Since the T-101&#x27;s core consciousness is still intact and he just lacks physical control of his body, John is able to incite him to shut down by noting the conflict between his current actions and his programmed mission. The T-101 later reboots himself free from the T-X&#x27;s control. As John and Kate retreat to a bunker to wait out the now-inevitable nuclear war, the T-101 battles the T-X, using his remaining fuel cell to destroy them both in a massive detonation.

This T-101 is revealed to have killed John in 2032, having been chosen due to John&#x27;s emotional attachment to the prior, identical-looking model in &quot;Terminator 2&quot;. After being captured by the resistance, the T-101 was reprogrammed to follow Kate&#x27;s orders, as she was the second-in-command prior to John&#x27;s death.

=== &quot;Terminator Salvation&quot; (2009) ===
The T-800 (Roland Kickinger) has a small role, though once again as an antagonist. Near the end of the film, the T-800 engages John Connor (Christian Bale) in battle during John&#x27;s attempt to rescue Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin) from the Skynet base in San Francisco. John holds his own with his advanced weaponry, but is unable to stop the Terminator until the latter is drenched in molten metal and then liquid nitrogen, freezing him temporarily. As John begins planting hydrogen fuel cells, cyborg prototype Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington) arrives to stall the T-800. The Terminator is able to incapacitate Marcus long enough to stab John through the abdomen. Marcus awakens and soon destroys the T-800. The fuel cells are set off as John and Marcus escape, destroying the base and a number of unfinished T-800s.

===&quot;Terminator Genisys&quot; (2015)===
&quot;Terminator Genisys&quot; follows the early events of the first film before diverging into an alternate timeline, ignoring all previous sequels. In the film, a T-800 was reprogrammed by an unknown party some time in the future and sent to 1973, to protect nine-year-old Sarah Connor (Emilia Clarke) from a T-1000. After her parents are killed, the T-800 becomes her surrogate father and raises her to prepare for her future destiny, similar to the relationship between the Terminator and the young John Connor in &quot;Terminator 2&quot;. The T-800, which Sarah refers to as &quot;Pops&quot;, has experienced an unprecedented level of emotional development, to the extent that he keeps her childhood drawings and photographs. 

In the film, it is speculated that the knowledge of who sent Pops back was deliberately erased from his memory so that Skynet (Matt Smith) could not track them down later. Pops integrates into human society, and at one point obtains a job as a construction worker to build the headquarters for Cyberdyne Systems. Throughout the film, he struggles with physical limitations due to increasing age, but states several times that he is, &quot;Old, not obsolete.&quot; Like the Terminator in the second film, Pops has been prohibited from killing humans.

After Kyle Reese&#x27;s (Jai Courtney) arrival in 1984, the trio defeat the T-1000 (Lee Byung-hun). Later, in 2017, they battle John Connor (Jason Clarke), who has been transformed into a T-3000 tasked to ensure Skynet&#x27;s rise. After multiple confrontations, Pops attempts to sacrifice himself to destroy the T-3000, telling Kyle Reese, &quot;Protect my Sarah&quot;. During the battle, Pops is thrown into a vat of liquid metal before the T-3000&#x27;s defeat, and as a result gains shapeshifting abilities like the T-1000. Pops then gives his approval of Sarah and Kyle&#x27;s relationship.

A youthful T-800 (Brett Azar), looking like the one in the first film, is also intercepted by the aging T-800 and Sarah after arriving in the alternate 1984. Before the T-1000 is destroyed, he reactivates and reprograms the younger cyborg to pursue Kyle, who blows its head off. The young T-800&#x27;s endoskeleton is dissolved in hydrochloric acid, and its CPU is used to operate Sarah and the older Terminator&#x27;s time machine. The CPU is destroyed after the machine&#x27;s usage, and with the older Terminator&#x27;s existence concealed, Cyberdyne&#x27;s plan for an A.I. (eventually named Genisys) is delayed until 2017.

=== &quot;Terminator: Dark Fate&quot; (2019) ===

In &quot;Terminator: Dark Fate&quot;, a direct sequel to &quot;Judgment Day&quot;, Schwarzenegger plays a T-800 called &quot;Carl&quot;. Originally one of a series of Terminators sent back by Skynet to kill John Connor prior to its erasure, the Terminator that would become Carl successfully tracked down and killed John in Livingston, Guatemala in 1998. With his sole mission complete and with Skynet no longer existing, the T-800 is left purposeless. In time, he became self-aware, realized he is free from Skynet, assumed the name Carl, and began exhibiting behavior much like humans. 

Months after killing John, Carl experienced compassion towards an abused woman, Alicia, and made a choice of rescuing her and her child, Mateo, from her uncaring husband. Carl becomes a father figure to Mateo, although his relationship with Alicia is non-sexual. Carl&#x27;s role as a family man gave him some idea of what had taken from Sarah when he murdered her son, and the memory of John&#x27;s death torments Carl to the point of being repentant. At some point, Carl established a drapery business in Laredo, Texas, where the family lives in a cabin. Over twenty years, Carl has aged significantly and his human social skills have improved.

Since John&#x27;s death, Carl used his awareness of &quot;chrono displacements&quot; and sent Sarah text messages with the GPS coordinates of where and when other time-traveling Terminators would arrive. Carl&#x27;s intention was to give Sarah a purpose by allowing her the chance to destroy the other Terminators, which Carl felt would give John&#x27;s death some form of meaning. He keeps track of Sarah&#x27;s whereabouts to make sure she survives her hunts. In 2020, Sarah decides to help Dani Ramos escape the Rev-9, a new class of Terminator sent from 2042 by a Skynet-analogous A.I. called Legion. The women also meet Grace, a cybernetically augmented future soldier who was sent to protect Dani, who will later lead the human resistance against Legion.

They later meet Carl and learn he had been sending Sarah the coordinates. Although Sarah hates Carl for the murder of her son, Dani convinces her that they need his help to destroy the Rev-9. Sarah concedes, but vows to destroy Carl after they stop the Rev-9, and Carl says he understands her intention. They confront the Rev-9 in a hydro-electric dam, where Grace and Carl sacrifice themselves to stop him. Carl&#x27;s last words are &quot;For John&quot;, a message he always included in his text messages to Sarah.

=== Other appearances ===

Schwarzenegger reprised the role in the music video for &quot;You Could Be Mine&quot;, a 1991 song by Guns N&#x27; Roses that is featured in &quot;Terminator 2&quot;. He also reprised the role for a theme park attraction known as &quot;T2-3D: Battle Across Time&quot;, which opened in 1996.

The character has also made appearances in numerous video games outside of the &quot;Terminator&quot; franchise. He is parodied in the side-scrolling shooter game &quot;Broforce&quot; (2015) as a playable character called the Brominator, with his appearance referencing Schwarzenegger.

The T-800 is also a guest playable character in the 2019 fighting game &quot;Mortal Kombat 11&quot;, available through the game&#x27;s Kombat Pack bundle of downloadable content. Schwarzenegger&#x27;s likeness is used for the character, but his voice is not. He is instead voiced by Chris Cox at the suggestion of Schwarzenegger. According to its biography, the Terminator in this game hails from the &quot;Dark Fate&quot; timeline.

In 2021, the T-800 became a character outfit in the online game &quot;Fortnite&quot;. In 2023, a second T-800 skin was released, this time featuring Schwarzenegger&#x27;s likeness.

The T-800 and T-1000 are featured in &quot;Call of Duty: Vanguard&quot; (2021) and the initial version of &quot;Call of Duty: Warzone&quot; (2020) as playable operators. Both characters also make a parody appearance in the 2015 comedy film &quot;Hollywood Adventures&quot;.

==Production background==
The Terminator concept was conceived by James Cameron, who directed and co-wrote the first film. It was produced by Gale Anne Hurd and released by Orion Pictures in 1984. The character was inspired by a fever dream that Cameron had two years earlier, involving a metallic entity holding kitchen knives.
Orion executive Mike Medavoy, in a phone call with Cameron, suggested that O. J. Simpson play the role of the Terminator, with Arnold Schwarzenegger as Kyle Reese. Cameron later recalled: &quot;Gale Hurd and I looked at each other like that was the stupidest thing we&#x27;d ever heard in our lives. And I told him on that phone call, &#x27;It&#x27;s not O.J. Simpson. We&#x27;re not doing that.&#x27;&quot; Cameron also felt that Schwarzenegger was wrong for the role of Reese and quickly found him to be ideal as the Terminator instead.

According to Cameron, &quot;Casting Arnold Schwarzenegger as our Terminator [...] shouldn&#x27;t have worked. The guy is supposed to be an infiltration unit, and there&#x27;s no way you wouldn&#x27;t spot a Terminator in a crowd instantly if they all looked like Arnold. It made no sense whatsoever. But the beauty of movies is that they don&#x27;t have to be logical. They just have to have plausibility.&quot;

Schwarzenegger prepared for the role with three months of weapons training. Cameron believed that Schwarzenegger&#x27;s Austrian accent and deadpan delivery worked well in the film: &quot;It had a strange synthesized quality, like they hadn&#x27;t gotten the voice thing quite worked out.&quot; One of the Terminator&#x27;s lines in the film, &quot;I&#x27;ll be back&quot;, became a popular catchphrase, although Schwarzenegger had difficulty saying it due to his accent.
After finishing the first film, Schwarzenegger suggested to Cameron that they make a sequel. An early idea for the next installment would have Schwarzenegger portraying two different T-800s from the future, one sent by Skynet to kill John Connor and the other sent by the resistance to protect him. However, co-writer William Wisher disliked the idea of identical Terminators fighting, which he found &quot;boring&quot;. The antagonistic T-800 was eventually replaced by the T-1000. Schwarzenegger was initially hesitant about his role being switched to a protagonist for the sequel, an idea which Cameron devised in order to surprise audiences. Schwarzenegger later said, &quot;I was very pleased with the twist and the idea of making the Terminator not kill anybody and become more of a human being. It added a great touch of sensitivity and sweetness to the whole movie.&quot;

&quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot; was released in 1991, and produced another catchphrase for Schwarzenegger&#x27;s character: &quot;Hasta la vista, baby&quot;. Cameron had no involvement in the next two films. Schwarzenegger initially refused to star in a third film without the involvement of Cameron, who later advised Schwarzenegger to reconsider. He eventually agreed to reprise the role for &quot;Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines&quot;, which was released in 2003. In the film, his character is depicted as an obsolete Terminator design compared with the T-X. Director Jonathan Mostow said, &quot;It&#x27;s always great if you can have your protagonist or hero be completely outmatched.&quot;

The films depict time travelers, including Terminators, as arriving from the future naked; the time machine is only capable of transporting organic material, preventing weapons and clothes from going through. Schwarzenegger, a bodybuilder, worked out daily to regain the same physique that he had during the previous films. He felt this was important: &quot;Otherwise, people would say, &#x27;He&#x27;s lost it; he&#x27;s all saggy and flabby,&#x27; and that would be all anyone would talk about it. I didn&#x27;t want to be digitized, because someone would blab, and it would be in all the columns. So I just worked harder.&quot; After filming started, Schwarzenegger continued to work out during lunch breaks. He enjoyed performing his own stunts, including for a vehicular chase sequence early in the film.

In 2003, Schwarzenegger was elected as governor of California, which prevented his return in 2009&#x27;s &quot;Terminator Salvation&quot;. However, the T-800 is featured briefly, with Schwarzenegger&#x27;s likeness recreated through CGI. Cameron was consulted for 2015&#x27;s &quot;Terminator Genisys&quot;, which featured the return of Schwarzenegger. His age is reflected in the film, with Cameron explaining to the filmmakers &quot;that the outer covering (of the Terminator) was actually not synthetic, that it was organic and therefore could age.&quot;

Cameron returned to the franchise for &quot;Terminator: Dark Fate&quot;, released in 2019. He agreed to produce the film on the condition that Schwarzenegger return; other people involved in the project had suggested making the film without the actor. Schwarzenegger said, &quot;I trained my ass off for the film. When you get to my age, you have to train twice as much to get the same result as you did 20 years ago.&quot;
For &quot;Dark Fate&quot;, Cameron conceived the idea of a T-800 that is &quot;just out there in this kind of limbo&quot; for more than 20 years after carrying out an order, becoming more human &quot;in the sense that he&#x27;s evaluating the moral consequences of things that he did, that he was ordered to do back in his early days, and really kind of developing a consciousness and a conscience&quot;. Cameron found this iteration of the character more interesting than those featured in his first two films: &quot;We&#x27;ve seen the Terminator that was programmed to be bad; you&#x27;ve seen the one that was programmed to be good, to be a protector. But in both cases, neither one of them have free will.&quot; Another idea from Cameron was for the film&#x27;s T-800 to run a drapery business, referencing Schwarzenegger&#x27;s real-life passion for interior decorating.

===Effects===
Aside from Schwarzenegger, the Terminator has also been depicted through the use of various effects. Cameron worked with effects artist Stan Winston to design the Terminator&#x27;s metal endoskeleton. Winston created a full-scale model of the endoskeleton for the first film, while effects artist Gene Warren Jr. built a stop motion version for a sequence near the film&#x27;s ending, in which it pursues Sarah and Kyle.

Winston returned to do endoskeleton work for the next two films. Molds of the original endoskeleton were used to create four new ones for &quot;Terminator 2&quot;, including two non-articulate versions and two others capable of movement. As in previous films, the character is again badly injured near the end of &quot;Terminator 3&quot;, this time revealing more of his metal interior than before. Winston achieved this look through the use of prosthetics and CGI. Full-scale endoskeleton models were made for the film, but only as a reference for digital artists.

For the T-800&#x27;s appearance in &quot;Terminator Salvation&quot;, the character is depicted by bodybuilder Roland Kickinger, with Schwarzenegger&#x27;s face superimposed on his during post-production. Another bodybuilder, Brett Azar, served as Schwarzenegger&#x27;s body double in &quot;Terminator Genisys&quot;, portraying the younger Terminator who battles with Pops. Moving Picture Company looked through archive footage of young Schwarzenegger and digitally placed his face onto Azar&#x27;s body. Azar returned as body double for the opening scene in &quot;Terminator: Dark Fate&quot;, with de-aging techniques used by Industrial Light &amp; Magic to add a younger version of Schwarzenegger&#x27;s face.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
The first &quot;Terminator&quot; film was an unexpected success, and Schwarzenegger&#x27;s eponymous character would go on to become his best-known role. According to Clark Collis of &quot;Empire&quot;, mainstream audiences had previously viewed Schwarzenegger as &quot;little more than a joke, a mumbling behemoth whose grasp of both acting and the English language, appeared minimal at best.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; found the character to be &quot;perfectly cast&quot;, while Colin Greenland of &quot;Imagine&quot; called Schwarzenegger &quot;eerily wonderful as the unstoppable cyborg.&quot; Marc Weinberg of &quot;Orange Coast&quot; wrote that it was &quot;great to see such a pure, unstoppable villain [...]. The filmmakers make no attempt to humanize him with weaknesses or emotions.&quot;

David Ansen of &quot;Newsweek&quot; felt that Schwarzenegger was &quot;born to play a machine,&quot; writing about &quot;Terminator 2&quot;, &quot;Here, as an emotionless cyborg acting out the part of a foster father, he&#x27;s impressive, hilarious, almost touching.&quot; Likewise, Hal Hinson of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; found his &quot;wooden&quot; performance ideal for the role: &quot;It&#x27;s comical, perhaps, but Schwarzenegger expresses more of his own humanity when playing a machine than he does when playing real people. [...] For once, he&#x27;s ideally cast, and he brings the kind of delicacy of feeling that Boris Karloff showed as the Frankenstein monster. As a machine, he has soul.&quot;

In his review of &quot;Terminator 3&quot;, Mike Clark of &quot;USA Today&quot; wrote that Schwarzenegger &quot;still looks spectacular, but the script is short on deadpan zingers, and his heart doesn&#x27;t seem in it.&quot; Nathan Rabin of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; wrote: &quot;Like Anthony Hopkins&#x27; Hannibal Lecter, Arnold Schwarzenegger&#x27;s Terminator has been spoofed, ripped off, and paid homage far too often to retain much of its original menace. Refreshingly, Mostow and company seem to understand that, and smartly use him as a comic figure&quot;. Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; felt that this Terminator&#x27;s &quot;physical inferiority to his opponent [the T-X] invests Schwarzenegger with an unaccustomed underdog status that brings him closer to the viewer.&quot;

Some critics considered &quot;Terminator Salvation&quot; to be disappointing, citing Schwarzenegger&#x27;s absence. Critic James Berardinelli found that it lacks a strong antagonist until the T-800&#x27;s brief appearance near the end, calling it the film&#x27;s high point. &quot;Terminator Genisys&quot; received generally negative reviews, although Schwarzenegger&#x27;s return was praised.

Reviewing &quot;Terminator: Dark Fate&quot;, Angie Han of &quot;Mashable&quot; found Schwarzenegger to be the film&#x27;s best aspect: &quot;His deadpan delivery makes him distinctive, while the performance beneath it suggests an interiority deeper and more complicated than even the character himself seems able to comprehend.&quot; David Ehrlich of &quot;IndieWire&quot; wrote that the character &quot;is smartly written, funny in a way &#x27;Dark Fate&#x27; struggles to be without him, and perhaps the most fundamentally human character the franchise has ever seen.&quot; Richard Roeper, writing for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, stated, &quot;It&#x27;s impossible not to laugh at some of the Terminator&#x27;s one-liners, but now it&#x27;s as if he&#x27;s in on the joke.&quot; Peter Bradshaw of &quot;The Guardian&quot; felt that Schwarzenegger was reprising &quot;a character I always thought was fundamentally wrong: the nice Terminator, the Terminator on the side of the angels&quot;. Likewise, Cathal Gunning of &quot;Screen Rant&quot; believed that the character, once a threatening antagonist, had been &quot;ruined&quot; by repeated humanization attempts throughout the film series.

===Accolades===
Schwarzenegger was nominated twice for the Saturn Award for Best Actor, for his characters in &quot;The Terminator&quot; and &quot;Terminator 2&quot;. For the latter film, he also won Best Male Performance at the 1992 MTV Movie Awards.

In a 2003 list of 100 Heroes &amp; Villains by the American Film Institute, the Terminator took two positions — number 48 as the hero and number 22 as the villain. Schwarzenegger himself presented the list on television, and said about his rankings, &quot;I am absolutely ecstatic about it. To say you are one of the 50 favorite villains and one of the 50 favorite heroes in the history of American motion pictures, that is unbelievable, and I felt very honored.&quot;

In 2015, the Terminator ranked 28th in &quot;Empire&quot;&#x27;s rating of 100 Greatest Film Characters.

<doc id="786920" wikidata="Q1138646" url="?curid=786920" title="National Liberation Front of Corsica">
<text>The National Liberation Front of Corsica ( or ; , abbreviated FLNC) is a name used by various guerrilla and paramilitary organizations that advocate an independent or autonomous state on the island of Corsica, separated from France. The original FLNC was founded on 5 May 1976 from a merger between two smaller armed groups: the Corsican Peasant Front for Liberation (Fronte Paesanu Corsu per Liberazione, FPCL), and Ghjustizia Paolina (Corsican for Paoline Justice). This organization persisted until 1990, when a 1988 ceasefire agreement caused the unstable organization to split into two organizations based around separate ideas. In 1999, various factions merged to form the FLNC-Union of Combatants (FLNC-Unione di i Cumbattenti, FLNC-UC), a larger organization and one of the FLNCs which still exist today. In the present day, there are four organizations still active with the FLNC name: The FLNC-UC, The FLNC-22 October (FLNC-22 Uttrovi, FLNC-22U), the FLNC-1976, and the FLNC-21 May (FLNC-21 Maghju, FLNC-21M). The FLNC-UC and FLNC-22U, the two largest and most active groups, often sign press releases and communiqués together, and have been allied since at least 2022. The political party Nazione was founded in 2024 from the political party Corsica Libera, the modern political wing of the FLNC-UC. is led by Petr&#x27;Antu Tomasi, Ghjuvan-Guidu Talamoni and Josepha Giacometti-Piredda, with the participation of the former FLNC political prisoner Carlu Santoni. The FLNCs are all mostly local to Corsica but also commit attacks on the French mainland.

Typical militant acts by various FLNC organizations were bombings aimed at public buildings, banks, tourist infrastructure, military buildings and other perceived French symbols, in addition to armed bank robbery and extortion against private enterprises through so-called &quot;revolutionary taxes&quot;. The attacks were usually performed against buildings and the island&#x27;s infrastructures, but it was also not uncommon for FLNC organizations to have individual people as targets. This was especially common during the tumultuous period of the “years of lead”, in which a large number of assassinations occurred between various warring factions, many successors of the original FLNC.


== Ideology ==

Ideology differs throughout the various FLNC groups, however there are some ideas that are common throughout all of them, such as defense and officialisation of the Corsican language, the release of political prisoners, the environmental protection of the island, the economic development of the island, and the end of the mass immigration of French mainlanders to Corsica (described as “settler-colonialism by some FLNC organizations, noteably the FLNC-CS and FLNC-UC).

The original FLNC was notable for achieving a number of political objectives through peace agreements, notably the Defferre Agreements, a set of agreements between the FLNC and the French government named for French interior minister Gaston Defferre that created the modern Corsican political system, including the creation of the Corsican Assembly and the establishment of autonomous Corsican institutions, such as circuit courts and an executive council. The agreements also reopened the University of Corsica, closed by the French army in 1769, and outlined the removal of French Foreign Legion members from their posts across the island. The agreement also released many political prisoners and FLNC members through amnesty policies. When the promises of lowering military presence was not honored, the FLNC resumed its political campaign.

Environmentalism and defense of the land (incorporating a form of agrarianism or peasant socialism and the protection of grazing lands, mountains, forests, and marshes) have always been very important in the ideology of the FLNC groups, particularly in connection with the popular struggles of the 1970s against the pollution of red mud and the allocation of remediated lands of the Aléria plain (originally subject to malaria and now the only land on the island suitable for intensive agriculture) to pied-noir farmers rather than Corsicans.

Corsican nationalism is often the ideology of the FLNC groups, but some, most notably Alain Orsoni’s FLNC-Canal Habituel (FLNC-Canale Abituale, FLNC-CA), advocate greater autonomy instead. The embrace of autonomy rather than independence was a source of contention between the FLNC-CA and the rival FLNC-Canal Historique (FLNC-Canale Storicu, FLNC-CS), one of the most radical FLNC organizations.

The various FLNC organizations almost all hold a far-left political position. The original FLNC, as with the FLNC-CS, followed a Communist ideology based on Marxist ideas. Nowadays, the current FLNCs all retain similar ideas but reject the Marxist label. 

With the dissolution of the Canal Habituel and the formation of the FLNC-UC, led by Charles Pieri, the FLNC returned to a hardline independence line of protest against French colonialism as well as the monopoly economy, launching for example a campaign against supermarkets in the late 2000s (without adopting an explicitly Marxist discourse, but declaring itself to be &quot;in line with the social and union struggles of our people in the face of the multiple relays of French colonialism in Corsica&quot;). The FLNC of 22 October, which announced in a press release of 21 March 2023 that it would now operate in concert with the Union of Combatants, claimed in the 2000s to embody an even more radical independence line than the FLNC-UC.

At the international level, the FLNC supports the causes of Irish and Basque nationalists and supports the Palestinian national movement.

== History ==

=== Foundation and objectives ===
The first FLNC was created from a merger of &quot;Ghjustizia Paolina&quot; and the &quot;Fronte Paesanu Corsu per Liberazione&quot;, the two largest Corsican armed organizations.

The FLNC carried out its first attacks on the night of 4 May 1976 with 21 bombs exploding in Ajaccio, Bastia, Sartène, Porto-Vecchio and other Corsican towns. The majority of the targets were public buildings and offices of civil servants. On 5 May the FLNC formally announced its existence when it issued a bilingual manifesto which also claimed responsibility for the previous night&#x27;s attacks.

The manifesto contained six demands:

* The recognition of the national rights of the Corsican people.
* The removal of all instruments of French colonialism – including the French Army and colonists.
* The setting up of a popular democratic government which would express the will and the needs of the Corsican people.
* The confiscation of &quot;colonial&quot; estates.
* Agrarian reform to fulfill the aspirations of farmers, workers and intellectuals and rid the country of all forms of exploitation.
* The right to self-determination of the Corsican people.

=== 2014 to present ===
In 2014, the FLNC-Union of Combattants (FLNC-Unione di i Cumbattenti, FLNC-UC), the largest successor to the original FLNC at that time, announced the cessation of its armed struggle. This was followed by the FLNC of 22 October (FLNC 22 Uttrovi, FLNC-22U) in 2016. Nevertheless, a number of minor splinter groups have so far emerged and are still active. The FLNC-22U warned in 2016 that any attacks on Corsica by ISIL will be met with swift retaliation.

On 2 March 2022, Yvan Colonna, a member of the FLNC that was arrested for his alleged role in the 1998 assassination of Claude Érignac, was put in a coma in prison after being assaulted by an Islamic Cameroonian-born inmate for &quot;disrespecting Muhammad.&quot; Colonna would die of his wounds on March 21, 2022, resulting in rioting and unrest across the island. The French interior ministry then floated the idea of political autonomy to Corsica to defuse the situation, with the FLNC-22U and FLNC-UC announcing they would jointly resume their armed campaign if said autonomy is not granted. On 21 March 2023, exactly one year after the death of Colonna, the FLNC-UC and FLNC-22U signed a joint press release where they declared a return to armed conflict and claimed 17 attacks.

In October 2023 explosions rocked secondary residences and under-construction villas across Corsica, with pro-FLNC slogans being spray-painted nearby.

In January 2024, anti-Semitic and anti-French graffiti appeared in Corsica, it is alleged that supporters of the FLNC may had sprayed the graffiti, although it is likely this is not a representation of any FLNC organization.

<text>The Army Service Ribbon (ASR) is a military award of the United States Army that was established by the Secretary of the Army on 10 April 1981 as announced in Department of the Army General Order 15, dated 10 October 1990. The Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard have no equivalent to the Army Service Ribbon.

==History==
Effective 1 August 1981, the Army Service Ribbon is awarded to all members of the regular (active) Army, and Army National Guard and United States Army Reserve in an active reserve status, for successful completion of initial-entry training, which for officers is considered to be successful completion of their basic/orientation or higher-level course. Enlisted Soldiers are awarded the ribbon upon successful completion of their initial military occupational specialty (MOS)–producing course. If a Soldier is assigned an MOS based on skills acquired as a civilian or member of a sister-service (e.g., USAF), the ribbon is awarded after completion of 4 months of honorable active service.

The ribbon may be awarded retroactively to those personnel who completed the required training before 1 August 1981, provided they had an Active Army status as defined above on or after 1 August 1981.

For those service-members who completed initial entry training prior to 1981, the Army Service Ribbon is retroactively awarded, provided the service-member was still on active duty after 1981. For those service-members who are appointed or enlist in the Army after serving with a sister-service (and who may not be required to complete Army initial entry training) the Army Service Ribbon is awarded after four months of active service.

The Army Service Ribbon is presented as a one-time award only, i.e., no subsequent awards are authorized. The United States Air Force equivalent of the Army Service Ribbon is the Air Force Training Ribbon. Neither the U.S. Navy nor the U.S. Marine Corps has a direct equivalent, though the Navy awards the Basic Training Honor Graduate Ribbon to the top 3% of each Navy recruit graduating class.

The Army Service Ribbon is a multi-colored (red, orange, yellow, green, and blue) ribbon to represent the entire spectrum of military specialties in which officers and enlisted Soldiers may enter upon completion of their initial training.

<text>The working poor are working people whose incomes fall below a given poverty line due to low-income jobs and low familial household income. These are people who spend at least 27 weeks in a year working or looking for employment, but remain under the poverty threshold.

In the United States, the official measurement of the working poor is controversial. Many social scientists argue that the official measurements used do not provide a comprehensive overview of the number of working poor. One recent study proposed over 100 ways to measure this and came up with a figure that ranged between 2% and 19% of the total United States population.

There is also controversy surrounding ways that the working poor can be helped. Arguments range from increasing welfare to the poor on one end of the spectrum to encouraging the poor to achieve greater self-sufficiency on the other end, with most arguing varying degrees of both.

==Measurement==
===Absolute===
According to the US Department of Labor, the working poor &quot;are persons who spent at least 27 weeks [in the past year] in the labor force (that is, working or looking for work), but whose incomes fell below the official poverty level.&quot; In other words, if someone spent more than half of the past year in the labor force without earning more than the official poverty threshold, the US Department of Labor would classify them as &quot;working poor&quot;. (Note: The official poverty threshold, which is set by the US Census Bureau, varies depending on the size of a family and the age of the family members.) , the poverty threshold for a family of four people is $27,479 and for a single person $13,788.

The official poverty threshold is calculated by using the Consumer Price Index for goods, multiplying the cost of a minimum food diet in 1963 by three, a family&#x27;s gross income (before tax), and the number of family members. In 2017, there were 6.9 million individuals defined as working poor. Because there has been, and still is, debate on how accurate using this metric is, the US Census Bureau began publishing a Supplemental Poverty Measure in 2011. The main difference using this metric is that a person&#x27;s poverty status is determined after subtracting taxes, food, clothing, shelter, utilities, childcare and work-related expenses, and including government benefits and people living in the home that do not fit the &quot;family&quot; definition (such as an unmarried couple, or dependent foster children). Using the SPM, the poverty rate overall increases, particularly the rate of the working poor. In 2018, the official rate was 5.1% vs the SPM&#x27;s measure of 7.2%.

===Relative===
In Europe and other non-US, high-income countries, poverty and working poverty are defined in relative terms. A relative measure of poverty is based on a country&#x27;s income distribution rather than an absolute amount of money. Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union, classifies a household as poor if its income is less than 60 percent of the country&#x27;s median household income. According to Eurostat, a relative measure of poverty is appropriate because &quot;minimal acceptable standards usually differ between societies according to their general level of prosperity: someone regarded as poor in a rich developed country might be regarded as rich in a poor developing country.&quot;

According to the latest data the UK&#x27;s working poor rate is 10%, with the median income being £507 per week in 2018.

==A profile of the working poor in the US==
According to a 2017 report from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics 4.5% of all people working or looking for work for at least 27 weeks in the previous year had incomes below the poverty level. 10.9% of those were employed part-time, and 2.9% were employed full-time. The occupations that have the highest poverty rate are agricultural jobs, such as farming, service sector jobs, such as fast food or retail, and the construction industry, at 9.7%, 9.0% and 7.1% respectively. The largest ethnicity groups of the working poor are African-American and Hispanics or Latinos, both at 7.9%, with whites at 3.9% and Asian at 2.9%. Women are far more likely than men to be working and in poverty, 10% vs 5.6%. While the majority of the working poor have a high school diploma or less, 5% have some college education, 3.2% have an associate degree, and 1.5% have a bachelor&#x27;s degree or higher. Families with children are four times as likely as a single person to live in poverty, with families headed by single women making up 16% of all working poor families.

==Prevalence and trends==
In 2018, according to the US Census Bureau&#x27;s official definition of poverty, 38.1 million US citizens were below the poverty line (11.8% of the population). However this number includes children under 18 years of age, elders over 65, and people with disabilities who cannot work. The poverty rate of people between the ages of 18 and 64 was 10.7%, or 21.1 million people. Of these, nearly half, 5.1%, were working at least part-time.

Using the US Census Bureau&#x27;s definition of poverty, the working poverty rate seems to have remained relatively stable since 1978. There is some controversy around this measurement, namely how the dollar amounts that make up the poverty threshold are calculated. In 1961, the Department of Agriculture came out with an &quot;economy food plan&quot; to be used as a temporarily during an emergency or when a family is in need. This plan did not account for any food consumption outside of the home, and while it was considered nutritious, it was limited in variety and monotonous, thus the temporary designation. The US government took this number and—because the average family at the time spent one-third of their income on food—multiplied it by three. This has remained the standard way to set the poverty thresholds. The food plan has not changed, it has only been adjusted for inflation. One argument is that this is no longer an accurate way to measure poverty because the average lifestyle has changed dramatically since the 1960s.

===US compared to Europe===
Other high-income countries have also experienced declining manufacturing sectors over the past four decades, but most of them have not experienced as much labor market polarization as the United States. Labor market polarization has been the most severe in liberal market economies like the US. Countries like Denmark and France have been subject to the same economic pressures, but due to their more &quot;inclusive&quot; (or &quot;egalitarian&quot;) labor market institutions, such as centralized and solidaristic collective bargaining and strong minimum wage laws, they have experienced less polarization.

Cross-national studies have found that European countries&#x27; working poverty rates are much lower than the US&#x27;s.

The following graph uses data from Brady, Fullerton, and Cross (2010) to show the working poverty rates for a small sample of countries. Brady, Fullerton, and Cross (2010) accessed this data through the Luxembourg Income Study. This graph measures household, rather than person-level, poverty rates. A household is coded as &quot;poor&quot; if its income is less than 50% of its country&#x27;s median income. This is a relative, rather than absolute, measure of poverty. A household is classified as &quot;working&quot; if at least one member of the household was employed at the time of the survey. The most important insight contained in this graph is that the US has strikingly higher working poverty rates than European countries.

==Risk factors==
===Race===
Minorities in the US are disproportionately affected by poverty. Blacks and Hispanics are twice as likely to be part of the working poor than Whites. In 2017, the rate for Blacks and Hispanics was 7.9%, and 3.9% for Whites, 2.9% for Asians.

===Education===
Higher levels of education generally leads to lower levels of poverty. However, higher education is not a guarantee of escaping poverty. 5.0% of the working poor have some college experience, 3.2% have an associate degree, and 1.5% have a bachelor&#x27;s degree or higher. Using the Supplemental Poverty Report and looking at everyone in poverty, not just those working, these percentages actually rise to 14.9% with a high school diploma, 9.7% with some college, and 6.2% with a bachelor&#x27;s degree of higher. Blacks and Hispanics have higher rates of poverty than Whites and Asians at every education level. Student loan debt in the US can also contribute to poverty due to capitalized interest if the borrower does not earn enough wages keep up with the loan payments.

===Families===
Married and cohabiting partners are less likely to experience poverty than individuals and single parents. The percentage of married and cohabiting partners living in poverty in 2018 was 7.7% and 13.9% respectively versus 21.9% for individuals. Single mothers are more likely than single fathers to experience poverty, 25% and 15.1% respectively.

===Age===
Older workers are less likely to be working and poor than their younger counterparts. The age group with the highest rate of poverty at 8.5% is 20 to 24 year olds, and 16 to 19 year olds at 8.4%. As workers age, the rate of poverty decreases to 5.7% for 25 to 34 year olds and 5% for 35 to 44 year olds. Workers ages 45 to 50, 55 to 64 and 65+ had much lower working poor rates, 3.1%, 2.6% and 1.5%, respectively.

===Gender===
Women of all races are more likely than men to be classified as working poor, especially if they are single mothers. The overall rate for women in 2017 was 5.3%, compared to 3.8% for men. The rate for Black women and Hispanic women was significantly higher than their male counterparts, at 10% and 9.1%, compared to Black men at 5.6% and Hispanic men at 7.0%. The rate for White women was closer to White males, at 4.5% and 3.5%, respectively. Only Asian women had a lower rate of working poverty than Asian males, at 2.5% and 3.2%, respectively.

Transgender persons are more likely than cisgender men or women to be classified as working poor. In the United States, transgender people are three times more likely than the average population have a household income between $1 and $9,999, and nearly twice as likely to have a household income between $10,000 and $24,999.

===Disability===
Workers with disabilities significantly earn less than their non-disabled counterparts.

==Obstacles to uplift==
The working poor face many of the same daily life struggles as the nonworking poor, but they also face some unique obstacles. Some studies, many of them qualitative, provide detailed insights into the obstacles that hinder workers&#x27; ability to find jobs, keep jobs, and make ends meet. Some of the most common struggles faced by the working poor are finding affordable housing, arranging transportation to and from work, buying basic necessities, arranging childcare, having unpredictable work schedules, juggling two or more jobs, and coping with low-status work.

Housing
Working poor people who do not have friends or relatives with whom they can live often find themselves unable to rent an apartment of their own. Although the working poor are employed at least some of the time, they often find it difficult to save enough money for a deposit on a rental property. As a result, many working poor people end up in living situations that are actually more costly than a month-to-month rental. For instance, many working poor people, especially those who are in some kind of transitional phase, rent rooms in week-to-week motels. These motel rooms tend to cost much more than a traditional rental, but they are accessible to the working poor because they do not require a large deposit. If someone is unable or unwilling to pay for a room in a motel, they might live in their car, in a homeless shelter, or on the street. This is not a marginal phenomenon; in fact, according to the 2008 US Conference of Mayors, one in five homeless people are currently employed.

Some working poor people are able to access housing subsidies (such as a Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher) to help cover their housing expenses. However, these housing subsidies are not available to everyone who meets the Section 8 income specifications. In fact, less than 25% of people who qualify for a housing subsidy receive one.

Education
The issue with education starts many times with the working poor from childhood and follows them into their struggle for a substantial income. Children growing up in families of the working poor are not provided the same educational opportunities as their middle-class counterpart. In many cases the low income community is filled with schools that are lacking necessities and support needed to form a solid education. This follows students as they continue in education. In many cases this hinders the possibility for America&#x27;s youth to continue on to higher education. 

The grades and credits are not attained in many cases, and the lack of guidance in the schools leaves the children of the working poor with no degree. Also, the lack of funds for continuing education causes these children to fall behind. In many cases, their parents did not continue on into higher education and because of this have a difficult time finding jobs with salaries that can support a family. Today a college degree is a requirement for many jobs, and it is the low skill jobs that usually only require a high school degree or GED. The inequality in available education continues the vicious cycle of families entering into the working poor.

Transportation
Given the fact that many working poor people do not own a car or cannot afford to drive their car, where they live can significantly limit where they are able to work, and vice versa. Given the fact that public transportation in many US cities is sparse, expensive, or non-existent, this is a particularly salient obstacle. Some working poor people are able to use their social networks—if they have them—to meet their transportation needs. In a study on low-income single mothers, Edin and Lein found that single mothers who had someone to drive them to and from work were much more likely to be able to support themselves without relying on government aid.

Basic necessities
Like the unemployed poor, the working poor struggle to pay for basic necessities like food, clothing, housing, and transportation. In some cases, however, the working poor&#x27;s basic expenses can be higher than the unemployed poor&#x27;s. For instance, the working poor&#x27;s clothing expenses may be higher than the unemployed poor&#x27;s because they must purchase specific clothes or uniforms for their jobs. Also, because the working poor are spending much of their time at work, they may not have the time to prepare their own food. In this case, they may frequently resort to eating fast food, which is less healthful and more expensive than home-prepared food.

Childcare
Working poor parents with young children, especially single parents, face significantly more childcare-related obstacles than other people. Often, childcare costs can exceed a low-wage earners&#x27; income, making work, especially in a job with no potential for advancement, an economically illogical activity. However, some single parents are able to rely on their social networks to provide free or below-market-cost childcare. 

There are also some free childcare options provided by the government, such as the Head Start Program. However, these free options are only available during certain hours, which may limit parents&#x27; ability to take jobs that require late-night shifts. The U.S. &quot;average&quot; seems to suggest that for one toddler, in full-time day care, on weekdays, the cost is approximately $600.00 per month. But, that figure can rise to well over $1000.00 per month in major metro areas, and fall to less than $350 in rural areas. The average cost of center-based daycare in the United States is $11,666 per year ($972 a month), but prices range from $3,582 to $18,773 a year ($300 to $1,564 monthly), according to the National Association of Child Care Resource &amp; Referral Agencies.

Work schedules
Many low-wage jobs force workers to accept irregular schedules. In fact, some employers will not hire someone unless they have &quot;open availability,&quot; which means being available to work any time, any day. This makes it difficult for workers to arrange for childcare and to take on a second job. In addition, working poor people&#x27;s working hours can fluctuate wildly from one week to the next, making it difficult for them to budget effectively and save up money.

Multiple jobs
Many low-wage workers have to work multiple jobs in order to make ends meet. In 1996, 6.2 percent of the workforce held two or more full- or part-time jobs. Most of these people held two part-time jobs or one part-time job and one full-time job, but 4% of men and 2% of women held two full-time jobs at the same time. This can be physically exhausting and can often lead to short-term as well as long-term health problems.

Low-status work
Many low-wage service sector jobs require a great deal of customer service work. Although not all customer service jobs are low-wage or low-status, many of them are. Some argue that the low status nature of some jobs can have negative psychological effects on workers, but others argue that low status workers come up with coping mechanisms that allow them to maintain a strong sense of self-worth. 

One coping mechanism is called boundary work, which happens when one group of people valorize their own social position by comparing themselves to another group, who they perceive to be inferior in some way. For example, Newman (1999) found that fast food workers in New York City cope with the low-status nature of their job by comparing themselves to the unemployed, who they perceive to be even lower-status than themselves.

==Anti-poverty policies==
Scholars, policymakers, and others have come up with a variety of proposals for how to reduce or eliminate working poverty. Most of these proposals are directed toward the United States, but they might also be relevant to other countries. The remainder of the section outlines the pros and cons of some of the most commonly proposed solutions.

===Welfare state generosity===
Cross-national studies like Lohmann (2009) and Brady, Fullerton, and Cross (2010) clearly show that countries with generous welfare states have lower levels of working poverty than countries with less-generous welfare states, even when factors like demography, economic performance, and labor market institutions are taken into account. Having a generous welfare state does two key things to reduce working poverty: it raises the minimum level of wages that people are willing to accept, and it pulls a large portion of low-wage workers out of poverty by providing them with an array of cash and non-cash government benefits. 

Many think that increasing the United States&#x27; welfare state generosity would lower the working poverty rate. A critique of this proposal by Charles Murray is that a generous welfare state would not work because it would stagnate the economy, raise unemployment, and degrade people&#x27;s work ethic. However, , most European countries have a lower unemployment rate than the US. Furthermore, although Western European economies&#x27; growth rates can be lower than the US&#x27;s from time to time, their growth rates tend to be more stable, whereas the US&#x27;s tends to fluctuate relatively severely. Individual states offer financial assistance for child care, but the aid varies widely. Most assistance is administered through the Child Care and Development Block Grants. Many subsidies have strict income guidelines and are generally for families with children under 13 (the age limit is often extended if the child has a disability). Many subsidies permit home-based care, but some only accept a day care center, so check the requirements. However, in an academic research, half of the respondents linked aspirations to their tax refunds for financial support, even though they did not ask for specific governmental aid.

Some states distribute funds through social or health departments or agencies (like this one in Washington State). For example, the Children&#x27;s Cabinet in Nevada can refer families to providers, help them apply for subsidies and can even help families who want to pay a relative for care. North Carolina&#x27;s Smart Start is a public/private partnership that offers funding for child care. Check the National Women&#x27;s Law Center for each state&#x27;s child care assistance policy.

===Wages and benefits===
In the conclusion of her book, &quot;Nickel and Dimed&quot; (2001), Barbara Ehrenreich argues that Americans need to pressure employers to improve worker compensation. Generally speaking, this implies a need to strengthen the labor movement. Cross-national statistical studies on working poverty suggest that generous welfare states have a larger impact on working poverty than strong labor movements. The labor movements in various countries have accomplished this through political parties of their own (labor parties) or strategic alliances with non-labor parties, for instance, when striving to put a meaningful minimum wage in place. The federal government offers a Flexible Spending Account (FSA) that&#x27;s administered through workplaces.

If a job offers an FSA (also known as a Dependent Care Account), one can put aside up to $5,000 in pre-tax dollars to pay for child care expenses. If both you and your spouse have an FSA, the family limit is $5,000—but you could get as much as $2,000 in tax savings if your combined contributions reach the maximum.

===Marriage===
Households with two wage-earners have a significantly lower rate of working poverty than households with only one wage-earner. Also, households with two adults, but only one wage-earner, have lower working poverty rates than households with only one adult. Therefore, it seems clear that having two adults in a household, especially if there are children present, is more likely to keep a household out of poverty than having just one adult in a household. Many scholars and policymakers have used this fact to argue that encouraging people to get married and stay married is an effective way to reduce working poverty (and poverty in general). However, this is easier said than done. Research has shown that low-income people marry less often than higher-income people because they have a more difficult time finding a partner who is employed, which is often seen as a prerequisite for marriage. Therefore, unless the employment opportunity structure is improved, simply increasing the number of marriages among low-income people would be unlikely to lower working poverty rates.

<text>In United States law, a finance charge is any fee representing the cost of credit, or the cost of borrowing. It is interest accrued on, and fees charged for, some forms of credit. It includes not only interest but other charges as well, such as financial transaction fees. Details regarding the federal definition of finance charge are found in the Truth-in-Lending Act and Regulation Z, promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board.

In personal finance, a finance charge may be considered simply the dollar amount paid to borrow money, while interest is a percentage amount paid such as annual percentage rate (APR). These definitions are narrower than the typical dictionary definitions or accounting definitions.

Creditors and lenders use different methods to calculate finance charges. The most common formula is based on the average daily balance, in which daily outstanding balances are added together and then divided by the number of days in the month.

In financial accounting, interest is defined as any charge or cost of borrowing money. Interest is a synonym for finance charge. In effect, the accountant looks at the entire cost of settlement on a Housing and Urban Development (HUD) form 1 (the HUD-1 Settlement Statement) document as interest unless that charge can be identified as an escrow amount or an amount that is charged to current expenses or expenditures other than interest, such as payment of current or prorated real estate taxes.

<text>is a 2004 Japanese &quot;tokusatsu&quot; superhero film adaptation of the anime series of the same name, written, directed, shot and edited by Kazuaki Kiriya. It is one of the few films released in the mid-2000s to be shot entirely on a &quot;digital backlot&quot;.

==Plot==
A fifty-year war between the Eastern Federation and Europa ends, with the Federation taking control of the continent of Eurasia. A resistance movement rises in Zone 7 and the Federation mobilizes its military. However, the war and heavy industry have exhausted the Federation and polluted the environment.

Dr. Azuma presents his discovery of Neo Cells, human cells that, in theory, can be converted to regenerate human tissue. The Neo Cells are only found in the genome of &quot;a primitive ethnic group.&quot; He states that he can develop the Neo Cells for human use, but is quickly denounced. But Kaoru Naito, from Nikko Hairal Inc., offers Dr. Azuma sponsorship. Azuma is persuaded when Naito insinuates that accepting will also help Dr. Azuma cure his wife, Midori.

A photo shoot at the Azuma Residence follows, commemorating Tetsuya&#x27;s (Azuma&#x27;s son) engagement to his girlfriend, Luna. They argue about Tetsuya joining the military. One year later, Tetsuya is deployed to Eurasia Zone 7. He kills civilians, and is killed by a booby trap.

Azuma invites Luna&#x27;s father, Dr. Kozuki, to his lab. They are rivals, since Azuma&#x27;s cell research makes Kozuki&#x27;s armor research redundant. However, although organs have been grown from the Neo Cells, they are not usable. Meanwhile, Midori, now almost blind, is visited by Tetsuya&#x27;s ghost. Shortly after she is told of his death. His body is sent to Azuma&#x27;s lab.

Tetsuya&#x27;s ghost sees the body. A lightning bolt strikes the facility and stimulates the Neo Cells, causing the limbs and organs to restructure into humans. Naito calls for the military to kill them. But a few escape and encounter Midori in her car, which they hijack.

Azuma carries Tetsuya&#x27;s body into his lab. Tetsuya is resurrected, but his condition is unstable, and he is brought to Kozuki&#x27;s residence. Kozuki puts him in prototype battle armor.

The Neo humans travel to Zone 7, sheltering in a derelict castle, where they discover a robot army. Calling themselves &quot;Neo-Sapiens,&quot; they vow revenge and reactivate the robots to wage war upon humanity.

Kozuki&#x27;s residence is attacked and Tetsuya is awakened. He kills a female Neo-Sapien, Saguree, but cannot save Kozuki. He escapes with Luna but is confronted by a robot battalion. After eliminating them, Tetsuya battles the leader, Burai, only to lose consciousness. When he comes to, he and Luna go to Zone Seven, but the route is contaminated, and Luna falls ill.

Tetsuya is found in the forest by a doctor and led to a nearby village in Zone Seven, where the doctor treats Luna. It is revealed the people of Zone Seven aren&#x27;t terrorists at all, but have been slaughtered for decades because of the government&#x27;s discriminatory policies. The doctor, in conversation, informs Tetsuya of a local legend of a protective deity named &quot;Casshern&quot;-a deity whose statue makes numerous appearances in the movie. Tetsuya fights Barashin as the village comes under attack by the military and Neo-sapiens, and it is here that he first refers to himself as Casshern. While both suffer injuries in the fight, Casshern is the victor and Barashin is killed. Fighting Barashin has caused Tetsuya to lose Luna, who escaped with a non-verbal Neo-sapien and eventually found her way to a train full of captured villagers from Zone Seven. Here, Luna and the Neo-sapien are confronted by a bereaved scientist who blames the Neo-Sapiens for the loss of his daughter. Luna is rescued by Dr. Azuma, but the Neo-Sapien is injured.

A coup d&#x27;état takes place and General Kamijo&#x27;s son takes over, while in the laboratory Naito reveals that Neo Cells are not what they seem. The Neo Cells were acquired from the slaughtered &quot;original humans&quot; of Zone Seven for the purposes of prolonging General Kamijo and his cohorts&#x27; lives, and the Neo Cell culture did not in fact create the Neo-Sapiens. It simply rejoined the body parts that were harvested from the victims of Zone Seven after being struck by the stone lightning bolt. Even though Dr. Azuma had been spearheading the macabre experiments, he is unable to explain what has happened. As they talk, the stone lightning bolt crumbles and Casshern appears to fall from the sky into the laboratory, which is now in ruins.

Burai arrives with an airship and abducts Luna, Casshern and the dying Neo-Sapien, leaving a now fatally wounded Naito, Dr. Azuma and General Kamijo&#x27;s son alone. Burai gives his reasons for hating humanity, and Casshern finds his mother, but she&#x27;s apparently dead. Burai launches a giant machine that appears to be set to self-destruct, which slaughters countless soldiers. Casshern uses all his strength to stop the machine, although it still detonates, albeit away from any urban or heavily populated area.

In the finale, the General&#x27;s son kills Burai with a grenade after revealing he was human all along, and it is learned that Tetsuya, during his military service, slaughtered Burai&#x27;s family. Casshern stops his father from resurrecting his mother, so Dr. Azuma retaliates by shooting Luna in the head. Luna is revived by the blood of Burai, only after Casshern kills his father.

The souls of the dead come onto Casshern as he and Luna embrace each other. Luna rips out Tetsuya&#x27;s containment suit and a pillar of light fires through space and crashing down onto another planet. The film ends with a montage of the characters in happier times.

== Production ==
The film is loosely based on a 1973 anime television series, &quot;Shinzō Ningen Kyashān&quot; (translated as &quot;Neo-Human Casshern&quot; and known as just &quot;Casshan&quot; in the United States) from animation studio Tatsunoko Productions. Along with contemporary films &quot;Able Edwards&quot;, &quot;Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow&quot;, &quot;Immortal&quot;, and &quot;Sin City&quot;, it was among the first feature-length live action films to be shot on a digital backlot, with the actors performing in front of a greenscreen and all but the simplest stage elements added digitally after the fact.

As well as being influenced by Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot;, director Kazuaki Kiriya states that he drew upon Russian Avant-Garde for visual inspiration.

According to Kiriya, in an interview with Joblo, it took two months to shoot the film and a further six months of post-production work. The film&#x27;s look was achieved through a combination of means, from CGI (supervised by Haruhiko Shono), matte paintings to even Kiriya&#x27;s heavy involvement with the cinematography.

The Japanese release contains a 6.1 channel soundtrack (Dolby Digital 5.1 on the PAL Region 2 release) and English subtitles.

The theme song, &quot;Dareka no Negai ga Kanau Koro&quot;, was written and sung by the director&#x27;s then-wife, pop singer Hikaru Utada.

The film served as Tatsuya Mihashi&#x27;s last role before his death.

== Soundtrack ==
A 2-disc soundtrack titled OUR LAST DAY -CASSHERN OFFICIAL ALBUM- was released on April 23, 2004.


Another album titled CASSHERN ORIGINAL SOUNDTRACK: Complete Edition was released. This album is Composed and Arranged by Shiro Sagisu with several tracks composed by Tomohiko Gondo and arranged by Yuichiro Honda.

== Reception ==

&quot;Casshern&quot; debuted on April 24, 2004, premiering in fifth place with a total gross of US$1,530,216 in 181 theaters. Staying within the top ten for five weeks, the film went on to make under US$ 13 million. The production cost was estimated at US$ 6.6 million.

On Rotten Tomatoes &quot;Casshern&quot; has acquired an overall approval rating of 70% from 10 reviews by critics. &quot;Empire&quot; gave it 3 out of possible 5 stars and described it as &quot;flawed and messy, but a hell of a looker&quot; while IGN reviewer, Hock Teh, gave the American DVD release 8 out of 10 stating that &quot;without any doubt, Casshern is a compelling piece of filmmaking&quot;. Variety reviewer Derek Elley notes that while not entirely original in its content, its execution and inventiveness are impressive.

The film was given a region one DVD release from DreamWorks on October 16, 2007. The US release is a full 24 minutes shorter than the original. It features both a Dolby Digital 5.1 and Dolby Digital stereo Japanese soundtrack, as well as English subtitles. The subtitles are almost universally criticized by fans for being enormously incomplete. On several occasions they are lacking entirely; when they do appear they often completely differ from the dialogue or oversimplify it to such a degree that key plot elements and the overall force of the story are diminished.

<doc id="786974" wikidata="Q468939" url="?curid=786974" title="Sacristy">
<text>A sacristy, also known as a vestry or preparation room, is a room in Christian churches for the keeping of vestments (such as the alb and chasuble) and other church furnishings, sacred vessels, and parish records.

The sacristy is usually located inside the church, but in some cases it is an annex or separate building (as in some monasteries). In most older churches, a sacristy is near a side altar, or more usually behind or on a side of the main altar.

In newer churches the sacristy is often in another location, such as near the entrances to the church. Some churches have more than one sacristy, each of which will have a specific function. Often additional sacristies are used for maintaining the church and its items, such as candles and other materials.

==Description==
The sacristy is also where the priest and attendants vest and prepare before the service. They will return there at the end of the service to remove their vestments and put away any of the vessels used during the service. The hangings and altar linens are stored there as well. The parish registers may be kept in the sacristy and are administered by the parish clerk.

Sacristies usually contain a special wash basin, called a piscina, the drain of which is properly called a &quot;sacrarium&quot; in which the drain flows directly into the ground to prevent sacred items such as used baptismal water from being washed into the sewers or septic tanks. The piscina is used to wash linens used during the celebration of the Mass and purificators used during Holy Communion. The cruets, chalice, ciborium, paten, altar linens and sometimes the Holy Oils are kept inside the sacristy. Sacristies are usually off limits to the general public. The word &quot;sacristy&quot; derives from the Latin &quot;sacristia&quot;, sometimes spelled &quot;sacrastia&quot;, which is in turn derived from &quot;sacrista&quot; (&quot;sexton, sacristan&quot;), from &quot;sacra&quot; (&quot;holy&quot;).

A person in charge of the sacristy and its contents is called a sacrist or a sacristan. The latter name was formerly given to the sexton of a parish church, where he would have cared for these things, the fabric of the building and the grounds.

In the Moravian Church, in addition to storing vestments and other vessels, the preparation room is where the Lovefeast is made ready for distribution to the congregation.

In Eastern Christianity, the functions of the sacristy are fulfilled by the Diaconicon and the Prothesis, two rooms or areas adjacent to the Holy Table (altar).

Work on finding the so-called &quot;lost medieval sacristy of Henry III&quot; at Westminster Abbey during an episode of the archaeological television programme &quot;Time Team&quot; revealed that the abbey originally had two separate sacristies. As well as a conventional sacristy for storage of ceremonial vessels such as the chalice and paten, the second, described in a 15th-century document as the &quot;galilee of the sacristy&quot; was determined to have been used for the robing and formation of the procession. Work is planned to rebuild the demolished processional sacristy as an entry route for tourists and visitors to Westminster Abbey.

<text>The Connecticut Lakes are a group of lakes in Coos County, northern New Hampshire, United States, situated along the headwaters of the Connecticut River. They are accessed via the northernmost segment of U.S. Route 3, between the village of Pittsburg and the Canada port of entry south of Chartierville, Quebec. The lakes are located within the boundaries of Pittsburg, but are far from the town center. Connecticut Lakes State Forest adjoins them.

There are four lakes: First, Second, Third and Fourth Connecticut Lake, numerically running south to north. The lakes decrease in size and increase in elevation, sequentially from first to fourth. The fourth lake is the source of the Connecticut River. The first three lakes can be viewed and accessed from U.S. Route 3, while the only access to the fourth lake is via the Fourth Connecticut Lake Trail, which goes in and out of Canada. All lakes are north of the 45th parallel.

Lake Francis lies to the south of the four Connecticut Lakes. It is a man-made reservoir and the last of the major lakes along the Connecticut River in northern New Hampshire.

==The lakes==
===First Connecticut Lake===

First Connecticut Lake is located in the town of Pittsburg, northeast of the village center. At , it is the eighth-largest lake located entirely in New Hampshire. It is the lowest in elevation and largest in surface area of the four Connecticut Lakes.

Fish species include landlocked salmon and lake trout. The lake has average and maximum depths of and , respectively. There are three public boat launch locations, and ice fishing is permitted from January through March. Outflow of the lake into the Connecticut River is controlled via the First Lake Dam, located near U.S. Route 3 at the southwestern shore.

A marker along the southwestern shore of the lake commemorates Luther Parker, a historical figure of the Republic of Indian Stream in the 1830s.

===Second Connecticut Lake===

Second Connecticut Lake, known in the past as Lake Carmel, is a water body in the town of Pittsburg, northeast of the village center. The second lake is higher in elevation than the first lake, and shallower.

Fish species include brook trout, landlocked salmon, and lake trout. There is one public boat launch location, and ice fishing is permitted from January through March. Outflow of the lake into the Connecticut River is controlled via the Second Lake Dam, located near U.S. Route 3 at the southwestern shore.

===Third Connecticut Lake===

Third Connecticut Lake, at one time known as Lake St. Sophia, is a water body in the town of Pittsburg, situated northeast of the village center, and less than south of the Canadian border. It reaches a maximum depth of approximately , and sits higher in elevation than the second lake.

Fish species include rainbow trout and lake trout. There is one public boat launch location, off of U.S. Route 3 along the eastern shore of the lake. Ice fishing is permitted from January through March.


===Fourth Connecticut Lake===

Fourth Connecticut Lake is the northernmost and most remote of the Connecticut Lakes; it is also the smallest, at . It is the source of the Connecticut River, and is situated in the town of Pittsburg, upstream from and higher than Third Connecticut Lake. The fourth lake is immediately to the northwest of the third lake. The Fourth Connecticut Lake Trail leads hikers to the lake.

====Fourth Connecticut Lake Trail====
The Fourth Connecticut Lake Trail is a public trail maintained by The Nature Conservancy that criss-crosses the international border between New Hampshire and Quebec for ending with a loop around the Fourth Connecticut Lake. It is one of the few international trails in North America. The land surrounding the lake is owned by The Nature Conservancy.
The parking area for hikers is at the American facility of the Pittsburg–Chartierville Border Crossing, located north of the Pittsburg town center via U.S. Route 3. The trail begins about to the right of the American building, with a small kiosk at the trailhead.

The trail has no cell phone coverage, requires some non-technical climbing, and starts at a good elevation—hikers should be prepared, even in summer. Pets are not allowed on the trail, and no camping, hunting, or fishing is allowed.

For persons starting in the United States, passports are not needed to hike the trail as, even though parts of the trail are in Canada, the trail starts and ends on the American side of the international border. For persons starting in Canada, a passport or other border crossing document would be required in order to enter the United States at the border facility before hiking the trail.
==Climate==

According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, First Connecticut Lake has a warm-summer humid continental climate, abbreviated &quot;Dfb&quot; on climate maps. The hottest temperature recorded at First Connecticut Lake was on July 8, 1921 and July 19, 1953, while the coldest temperature recorded was on February 1, 1920.

==Connecticut Lakes Natural Area==

The surrounding the lakes was set aside as a land conservation project in 2002 by the New Hampshire Fish and Game Department. The protected area is within the towns of Clarksville and Pittsburg, up to the border with Canada.

<doc id="787001" wikidata="Q5429777" url="?curid=787001" title="Fair Debt Collection Practices Act">
<text>The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA), Pub. L. 95-109; 91 Stat. 874, codified as –1692p, approved on September 20, 1977 (and as subsequently amended), is a consumer protection amendment, establishing legal protection from abusive debt collection practices, to the Consumer Credit Protection Act, as Title VIII of that Act. The statute&#x27;s stated purposes are: to eliminate abusive practices in the collection of consumer debts, to promote fair debt collection, and to provide consumers with an avenue for disputing and obtaining validation of debt information in order to ensure the information&#x27;s accuracy. The Act creates guidelines under which debt collectors may conduct business, defines rights of consumers involved with debt collectors, and prescribes penalties and remedies for violations of the Act. It is sometimes used in conjunction with the Fair Credit Reporting Act.

==People and entities covered by the FDCPA==
The FDCPA broadly defines a debt collector as &quot;any person who uses any instrumentality of interstate commerce or the mails in any business the principal purpose of which is the collection of any debts, or who regularly collects or attempts to collect, directly or indirectly, debts owed or due or asserted to be owed or due another.&quot; While the FDCPA generally applies only to third party debt collectors—not internal collectors for an &quot;original creditor&quot;—some states, such as California, have similar state consumer protection laws which mirror the FDCPA, and regulate original creditors. In addition, some federal courts have ruled that a collector of debt is not a &quot;creditor&quot; but is rather a &quot;debt collector&quot; under the FDCPA where the collector of debt buys defaulted debt from an original creditor for the purpose of debt collection. The definitions and coverage have changed over time. The FDCPA itself contains numerous exceptions to the definition of a &quot;debt collector&quot;, particularly after the October 13, 2006, passage of the Financial Services Regulatory Relief Act of 2006. Attorneys, originally explicitly exempted from the definition of a debt collector, have been included (to the extent that they otherwise meet the definition) since 1986.

The FDCPA&#x27;s definitions of &quot;consumers&quot; and &quot;debt&quot; specifically restricts the coverage of the act to personal, family or household transactions. Thus, debts owed by businesses (or by individuals for business purposes) are not subject to the FDCPA.

In the federal tax case of &quot;Smith v. United States&quot;, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit stated that the taxpayer&#x27;s &quot;invocation of the Fair Debt Collection Act is entirely without merit, as the statute expressly excludes &#x27;any officer or employee of the United States ... to the extent that collecting or attempting to collect any debt is in the performance of his official duties&#x27; from the definition of &#x27;debt collector&#x27;. 15 U.S.C. section 1692a(6)(C).&quot; In 1998, however, Congress amended the Internal Revenue Code by adding a new section 6304, &quot;Fair Tax Collection Practices&quot;, which refers to and includes certain rules that are similar to some provisions of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act.

In &quot;Henson v. Santander Consumer USA Inc.&quot;, the Supreme Court excluded collection companies that purchase consumer debt from the FDCPA when it unanimously held that a company may collect debts that it purchased for its own account without triggering the statutory definition of a &quot;debt collector&quot; under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. Nonetheless, at least one subsequent Circuit Court opinion has cabined the impact of &quot;Henson&quot; by subsequently finding that companies that purchase consumer debt could still be subject to the FDCPA under the alternative definition of debt collector as a business whose &quot;principal purpose&quot; is the collection of debts.

==Prohibited conduct==
The Act prohibits certain types of &quot;abusive and deceptive&quot; conduct when attempting to collect debts, including the following:

* Hours for phone contact: contacting consumers by telephone outside of the hours of 8:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. local time. Additionally, if certain hours are inconvenient for consumers during the allowable time (those who work at night and sleep during the day) they may not be contacted during those times.
* Failure to cease communication upon request: communicating with consumers in any way (other than litigation) after receiving &quot;written&quot; notice that said consumer wishes no further communication or refuses to pay the alleged debt, with certain exceptions, including advising that collection efforts are being terminated or that the collector intends to file a lawsuit or pursue other remedies where permitted.
* Causing a telephone to ring or engaging any person in telephone conversation repeatedly or continuously: with intent to annoy, abuse, or harass any person at the called number.
* Communicating with consumers at their place of employment after having been advised that this is unacceptable or prohibited by the employer.
* Contacting a consumer known to be represented by an attorney. The collector must contact the attorney instead, unless the attorney is unresponsive or consents to the client&#x27;s being contacted directly.
* Communicating with a consumer after a request for validation has been made: communicating with the consumer or pursuing collection efforts by the debt collector &quot;after&quot; receipt of a consumer&#x27;s written request for verification of a debt made within the 30-day validation period (or for the name and address of the original creditor on a debt) and &quot;before&quot; the debt collector mails the consumer the requested verification or the original creditor&#x27;s name and address.
* Misrepresentation or deceit: misrepresenting the debt or using deception to collect the debt, including a debt collector&#x27;s misrepresentation that he or she is an attorney or law enforcement officer.
* Publishing the consumer&#x27;s name or address on a &quot;bad debt&quot; list.
* Seeking unjustified amounts, which would include demanding any amounts not permitted under an applicable contract or as provided under applicable law.
* Threatening arrest or legal action that is either not permitted or not actually contemplated.
* Abusive or profane language used in the course of communication related to the debt.
* Communication with third parties: revealing or discussing the nature of debts with third parties (other than the consumer&#x27;s spouse or attorney). (Debt collectors are allowed to contact neighbors or co-workers but only to obtain location information; disreputable agencies often harass debtors with a &quot;block party&quot; or &quot;office party&quot; where they contact multiple neighbors or co-workers telling them they need to reach the debtor on an urgent matter.)
* Contact by embarrassing media, such as communicating with a consumer regarding a debt by post card, or using any language or symbol, other than the debt collector’s address, on any envelope when communicating with a consumer by use of mail or by telegram, except that a debt collector may use his business name if such name does not indicate that he is in the debt collection business.
* Reporting false information on a consumer&#x27;s credit report or threatening to do so in the process of collection.

==Required conduct==
The Act requires debt collectors to do the following (among other requirements):

* Identify themselves and notify the consumer, in every communication, that the communication is from a debt collector, and in the initial communication that any information obtained will be used to effect collection of the debt.
* Give the name and address of the original creditor (company to which the debt was originally payable) upon the consumer&#x27;s written request made within 30 days of receipt of the §1692g notice.
* Notify the consumer of their right to dispute the debt (Section 809), in part or in full, with the debt collector. The 30-day &quot;§1692g&quot; notice is required to be sent by debt collectors within five days of the initial communication with the consumer, though in 2006 the definition of &quot;initial communication&quot; was amended to exclude &quot;a formal pleading in a civil action&quot; for purposes of triggering the §1692g notice, complicating the matter where the debt collector is an attorney or law firm. The consumer&#x27;s receipt of this notice starts the clock running on the 30-day right to demand verification of the debt from the debt collector.
* Provide verification of the debt. If a consumer sends a written dispute or request for verification within 30 days of receiving the §1692g notice, then the debt collector must either mail the consumer the requested verification information or cease collection efforts altogether. Such asserted disputes must also be reported by the creditor to any credit bureau that reports the debt. Verification should include at a minimum the amount owed and the name and address of the original creditor.
* File a lawsuit in a proper venue. If a debt collector chooses to file a lawsuit, it may only be in a place where the consumer lives or signed the contract. Note, however, that this does not prevent the debt collector from &quot;being&quot; sued in other venues for violating the Act, such as when the consumer moves outside the venue and a letter demanding payment is forwarded to the new address, even if the debt collector is unaware of such a change in residence.

==Enforcement of the FDCPA==
The Federal Trade Commission originally had the authority to administratively enforce the FDCPA using its powers under the Federal Trade Commission Act. However, under the sweeping reforms of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, the FDCPA is enforced primarily by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

Aggrieved consumers may also file a private lawsuit in a state or federal court to collect damages (actual, statutory, attorney&#x27;s fees, and court costs) from third-party debt collectors. The FDCPA is a strict liability law, which means that a consumer need not prove actual damages in order to claim statutory damages of up to $1,000 plus reasonable attorney fees if a debt collector is proven to have violated the FDCPA. The collector may, however, escape penalty if it shows that the violation (or violations) was unintentional and the result of a &quot;bona fide error&quot; that occurred despite procedures designed to avoid the error at issue.

Alternatively, if the consumer loses the lawsuit and the court determines that the consumer filed the case in bad faith and for the purposes of harassment, the court may then award attorney&#x27;s fees to the debt collector. Another limitation is the one year statute of limitations, which the Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Rotkiske v. Klemm&quot; (2019) starts tolling from the date of the alleged violation, not from the date the incident was discovered.

==Criticisms of the FDCPA==

===By consumer groups===
Some consumer groups argue that the FDCPA does not go far enough, and does not provide sufficient deterrence against unscrupulous collection agencies. Consumer groups have complained that the maximum statutory damages contained in the original 1977 version of the law has not kept up with inflation; $1,000 in 1977 dollars is worth $ as of .

===By the credit industry===
Conversely, many in the credit industry and some courts have taken the stance that the FDCPA has often been used to file frivolous lawsuits and seek damages for minor technical violations and has, at times, seriously impeded their ability to collect valid debts. Given the strict liability nature of the FDCPA, the collections industry and the insurance companies that provide liability coverage for them have repeatedly lobbied Congress to relax provisions of the law to reduce their civil exposure for these &quot;hyper-technical&quot; violations.

The accounts receivable management industry has also raised concerns that the FDCPA contains contradictions that often lead to liability on the part of collection agencies in civil cases, especially when dealing with technology that did not exist when the law was written. For example, the FDCPA requires a collection agency to identify itself as such in any communication with a consumer. At the same time, a collection agency cannot disclose the debt of a consumer to anyone else. These two requirements are at odds when a collector leaves a message on an answering machine or voicemail system. If the collector identifies himself and his company, a third party could hear the message, thus resulting in a third party disclosure violation. Case law has tackled this issue but has not yet resolved it.

==Regulatory agencies and the FDCPA==
For its part, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) produces an annual report to Congress of its findings with respect to its FDCPA enforcement activities. This report details consumer complaints to the FTC about alleged debt collector violations of the FDCPA. The 2013 report indicated that the FTC received 125,136 consumer complaints about third party debt collectors in 2012, which is a decrease from the 144,451 received in 2011. The FTC receives more complaints about debt collectors than about any other specific industry, though the number of complaints represents a small percentage of the overall number of contacts by debt collectors with consumers.

The FTC has authority to issue formal opinions regarding debt collectors&#x27; conduct under the FDCPA, but the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act transfers authority for rule making to the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) effective between January 21, 2011 and July 21, 2011. The FTC will retain FDCPA enforcement authority, but the CFPB will take over the FTC&#x27;s advisory opinion function. Good faith conformity with a formal opinion of the FTC constitutes a second statutory defense under the FDCPA. The FTC has only rarely exercised its authority to issue advisory opinions, however. Prior to 2000, the FTC had not issued any advisory opinions regarding the FDCPA, it has issued only four such opinions through 2009.

In March 2021, the CFPB issued its annual report to Congress on its implementation of the FDCPA. The bureau had participated in four actions against alleged FDCPA violations. Two of the cases were resolved with over $15 million in redress. The bureau also offered information to assist consumers through the COVID-19 pandemic, data on debt collection activity for student loans, and conducted an 8,000-respondent survey to test disclosures explaining time-barred debt and its rules on debt collection.

<doc id="787003" wikidata="Q2415700" url="?curid=787003" title="Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter">
<text>is a 1997 crossover fighting video game developed and published by Capcom. It is the sequel to &quot;X-Men vs. Street Fighter&quot; (1996) and the second installment in the &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom&quot; series. After its release on arcades, it received ports to the Sega Saturn in 1998 and the PlayStation in 1999.

The gameplay and aesthetics of &quot;Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter&quot; remain similar to &quot;X-Men vs. Street Fighter&quot;. Each player selects two characters to compete in a one-on-one tag team fight, attempting to defeat the opposing team. The game replaces most of the &quot;X-Men&quot; cast from the previous installment with characters from other Marvel properties. In addition, it introduces a new gameplay mechanic known as the &quot;Variable Assist&quot;, which would be used in future &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom&quot; titles.

Much like its predecessor, the game received generally positive reviews for its gameplay, sprite animations, and character roster. The Sega Saturn version, utilizing the 4 MB RAM expansion cartridge, was praised for being an arcade-perfect conversion. Due to the memory limitations of the PlayStation, tag team battles were once again removed from its port, resulting in more mixed critical reception. A sequel, &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes&quot;, was released in 1998.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter&quot; is the second installment in the &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom&quot; series of 2D fighting games. It utilizes the same one-on-one tag team format previously employed in &quot;X-Men vs. Street Fighter&quot;. The player chooses a team of two fighters, each sporting their own life gauge; at the start of the match, the first selected character is controlled by the player, while the second character remains off-screen and acts as support. Using a combination of joystick movements and button presses, the player must execute various moves to deplete the opposing team&#x27;s life gauges. The first player to completely drain the opponent&#x27;s health is declared the winner. If the timer reaches zero, the player that possesses the most health wins.

The most notable gameplay change in &quot;Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter&quot; is the addition of the &quot;Variable Assist&quot;. With the Variable Assist, the player can summon their off-screen character to perform a special move without changing their currently-controlled character, opening new possibilities for combos during battle and greatly expanding the role of the secondary character. The ability to use assists would later become a signature gameplay element used in several future installments of the &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom&quot; series.

===Modes===
The arcade, Sega Saturn, and PlayStation versions of &quot;Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter&quot; share Arcade Mode and Versus Mode. In Arcade Mode, the player fights waves of artificial intelligence-controlled teams, culminating in a penultimate battle against the boss character, Apocalypse, who previously appeared in &quot;X-Men vs. Street Fighter&quot;. Upon defeating Apocalypse, the player must win against the final boss character, Cyber-Akuma. The PlayStation version includes three exclusive game modes: Training, Hero Battle, and Cross Over. Hero Battle is an endurance mode which pits the player against the characters that they did not select. In Cross Over, the player and the computer opponent fight with the same team of characters; if the player is victorious, then the computer swaps one character from both teams. The PlayStation port also features a Gallery Mode containing promotional and character artwork, which are unlocked by completing various goals.

===Playable characters===

&quot;Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter&quot; features a roster of 17 playable fighters, with nine characters from the &quot;Street Fighter&quot; universe and eight heroes from the Marvel Universe. All of the &quot;X-Men&quot; characters featured in &quot;X-Men vs. Street Fighter&quot;, with the exception of Cyclops and Wolverine, are replaced with characters from other Marvel Comics properties, such as Captain America, Spider-Man, and the Hulk. Most of the &quot;Street Fighter&quot; characters from the previous game return, with the exception of Cammy and Charlie (although Charlie is actually still in the game as a palette swapped secret character named &quot;Shadow&quot;), who are replaced by Dan and Sakura. In addition to the 17 immediately playable characters, the roster also contains six secret characters, all of which are palette swaps of existing fighters with different moveset properties.

The Japanese arcade and console versions of &quot;Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter&quot; include an exclusive character named Norimaro (). Norimaro is an original character created and owned by Japanese comedian Noritake Kinashi, who represents neither Marvel nor Capcom. Due to licensing issues from Marvel as they were against the character fighting their heroes, Norimaro is not available in the international releases or most later ports of the game. Norimaro was restored for the &quot;Fighting Collection&quot; re-release of the game, making him playable outside of Japan for the first time.

==Development and release==
As with &quot;X-Men vs. Street Fighter&quot;, &quot;Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter&quot; was initially developed for the CP System II arcade system board. The game debuted in Japanese and North American arcades in 1997. The game received a port to the Sega Saturn, exclusive to Japan, on October 22, 1998. The Sega Saturn port supported the 4MB RAM expansion peripheral, allowing the developers to create a conversion which retained the original frame rates and tag team system. The game was then ported to the PlayStation in February 1999. Due to the console&#x27;s limited RAM capacity, the tag team format was switched to the more traditional round format used in other fighting game series, such as &quot;Street Fighter&quot;. To compensate for the removal of tag team gameplay, several new game modes, such as Hero Battle and Cross Over, were implemented.

According to former Capcom USA community manager and fighting game advisor Seth Killian, one of the primary goals for &quot;Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter&quot; was to &quot;tone down the insanity&quot; that occurred onscreen when compared to &quot;X-Men vs. Street Fighter&quot;. The developers also sought to achieve balance within the character roster; the previous title had gained a reputation for being &quot;broken&quot;, with characters having access to one or more . These changes, however, were met with negative reception from fans, who criticized the game for offering less freedom. This ultimately led to Capcom recognizing the theme of insanity as the hallmark of the series and using it as a focus for future &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom&quot; installments.

In June 2020, &quot;Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter&quot; was included in a home arcade cabinet from Arcade1Up alongside other games like &quot;X-Men vs. Street Fighter&quot; and &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes&quot;. In June 2024, Capcom announced that &quot;Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter&quot; would be among the games included in the &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics&quot; compilation, which was released the following September. The &quot;Fighting Collection&quot; version includes the ability for players to control Cyber-Akuma and Norimaro.

==Reception==
In Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed &quot;Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter&quot; on their September 1, 1997 issue as being the third most-successful arcade game of the month.

The Sega Saturn version of &quot;Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter&quot; received &quot;favorable&quot; reviews, while the PlayStation version received &quot;average&quot; reviews, according to the review aggregation website GameRankings. Jeff Gerstmann of &quot;GameSpot&quot; praised the Sega Saturn port for its gameplay, character roster, graphics, sprite animations, and additional RAM support, labeling it an &quot;arcade-perfect conversion&quot;. However, Gerstmann faulted the game for being a &quot;near-carbon copy&quot; of &quot;X-Men vs. Street Fighter&quot;. While the PlayStation port also received praise for its gameplay and character roster, it attracted numerous criticisms, many of which stemmed from issues related to the console&#x27;s memory restrictions. &quot;GameSpot&quot;, &quot;IGN&quot;, and &quot;GameRevolution&quot; all reprimanded the game for removing the original version&#x27;s tag team-based gameplay. Randy Nelson of &quot;IGN&quot; stated that the lack of tag team fights negated one of the major elements that made Capcom&#x27;s &quot;Vs.&quot; series stand apart, resulting in a game that was &quot;nothing truly special or different&quot;. Ryan MacDonald of &quot;GameSpot&quot; expressed disappointment over the port&#x27;s lower graphical quality and cut animation frames. &quot;Game Informer&quot; also complained about experiencing instances of slowdown. However, despite the criticisms, reviewers claimed the game as an improvement over the critically panned PlayStation port of &quot;X-Men vs. Street Fighter&quot;.

==Sequel==

A sequel to &quot;Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter&quot;, titled &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes&quot;, was released for arcades in Japan and North America in 1998. The game expands its character roster beyond the &quot;Street Fighter&quot; series to include other Capcom video game franchises, such as &quot;Darkstalkers&quot; and &quot;Mega Man&quot;. While its gameplay remains similar, &quot;Clash of Super Heroes&quot; removes the &quot;Variable Assist&quot; feature in favor of a new system. It was ported to the Dreamcast and PlayStation in 1999 and 2000 respectively. A high-definition version of the game was also released in 2012 for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 as part of the &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom Origins&quot; compilation.

<doc id="787012" wikidata="Q5429774" url="?curid=787012" title="Fair Credit Reporting Act">
<text>The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), 15 U.S.C. § 1681 &quot;et seq.&quot;, is federal legislation enacted to promote the accuracy, fairness, and privacy of consumer information contained in the files of consumer reporting agencies. It was intended to shield consumers from the willful and/or negligent inclusion of erroneous data in their credit reports. To that end, the FCRA regulates the collection, dissemination, and use of consumer information, including consumer credit information. Together with the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA), the FCRA forms the foundation of consumer rights law in the United States. It was originally passed in 1970, and is enforced by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and private litigants.

==History==
Before standardization of credit scoring, statements of character were integral to credit reports well into the 1960s. With credit reports containing probing details about personality, habits, and health, in the hearings on the Fair Credit Reporting Act lawmakers were troubled that individuals were helpless to clear up errors. 

The Fair Credit Reporting Act, as originally enacted, was title VI of , entitled &quot;An Act to amend the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to require insured banks to maintain certain records, to require that certain transactions in United States currency be reported to the Department of the Treasury, and for other purposes&quot;. It was written as an amendment to add a title VI to the Consumer Credit Protection Act, .

The Fair Credit Reporting Act was one of the first data privacy laws passed in the Information Age. The findings of the U.S. Congress that led to the Act and the Act&#x27;s regulatory goals set the direction of information privacy in the U.S. and the world for the next sixty years. Among these innovations were the determination that there should be no secret databases to make decisions about a person&#x27;s life, individuals should have a right to see and challenge the information held in such databases, and that information in such a database should expire after a reasonable amount of time.

== Consumer reports ==
Commonly referred to as credit reports, a consumer report &quot;contains information about your credit—and some bill repayment history—and the status of your credit accounts. This information includes how often you make your payments on time, how much credit you have, how much credit you have available, how much credit you are using, and whether a debt or bill collector is collecting on money you owe. Credit reports also can contain rental repayment information if you are a property renter. It also can contain public records such as liens, judgments, and bankruptcies that provide insight into your financial status and obligations.&quot;

== Inaccuracies in consumer reports ==
A 2015 study released by the Federal Trade Commission found that 23% of consumers identified inaccurate information in their credit reports. Under the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act (FACTA), an amendment to the FCRA passed in 2003, consumers are able to receive a free copy of their consumer report from each credit reporting agency once a year. The free report can be requested by telephone, mail, or through the government-authorized website: AnnualCreditReport.com.

== Civil liability ==
The FCRA regulates: 
# Consumer reporting agencies; 
# Users of consumer reports; and, 
# Furnishers of consumer information.

If a consumer&#x27;s rights under the FCRA are violated, they can recover: 
# Actual or statutory damages; 
# Attorney&#x27;s fees; 
# Court costs; and, 
# Punitive damages if the violation was willful. &quot;The threat of punitive damages under 1681n of the FCRA is the primary factor deterring erroneous reporting by the reporting industry.&quot;

The statute of limitations requires consumers to file suit prior to the earlier of: two years after the violation is discovered; or,
five years after the violation occurred.

Consumer attorneys often take these cases on a contingency fee basis because the statute allows a consumer to recover attorney&#x27;s fees from the offending party.

==Users of consumer reports==
Users of the information for credit, insurance, or employment purposes (including background checks) have the following responsibilities under the FCRA:

# Users can only obtain consumer reports for permissible purposes under the FCRA;
# Users must notify the consumer when an adverse action is taken on the basis of such reports; and,
# Users must identify the company that provided the report, so that the accuracy and completeness of the report may be verified or contested by the consumer.

==Employment background checks==
Employers using consumer reports to screen job applicants or employees must follow specific procedures: 
# Get your written permission; 
# Tell you how they want to use your credit report; 
# Not misuse your information;
# Give you a copy of your credit report if the employer decides not to hire or fires you; and,
# Give you an opportunity to dispute the information contained within your credit report before making a final adverse decision.

== Furnishers of information ==
A creditor, as defined by the FCRA, is a company that furnishes information to consumer reporting agencies. Typically, these are creditors, with which a consumer has some sort of credit agreement (such as credit card companies, auto finance companies and mortgage banking institutions).

Other examples of information furnishers are collection agencies (third-party collectors), state or municipal courts reporting a judgment of some kind, past and present employers and bonders. Lenders have an important role to play in ensuring credit reports are accurate. Under the FCRA, creditors who furnish information about consumers to consumer reporting agencies must:

# Provide complete and accurate information to the credit reporting agencies;
# Investigate consumer disputes received from credit reporting agencies;
# Correct, delete, or verify information within 30 days of receipt of a dispute; and,
# Inform consumers about negative information which is in the process of or has already been placed on a consumer&#x27;s credit report within one month.

&quot;(This notice doesn&#x27;t have to be sent as a separate notice, but may be placed on a consumer&#x27;s monthly statement. If sent as part as the monthly statement, it needs to be conspicuous, but need not be in bold type. Required wording developed by the US Federal Treasury Department):&quot;

Notice before negative information is reported: &quot;We may report information about your account to credit bureaus. Late payments, missed payments, or other defaults on your account may be reflected in your credit report.&quot;

Notice after negative information is reported: &quot;We have told a credit bureau about a late payment, missed payment or other default on your account. This information may be reflected in your credit report.&quot;

== Consumer reporting agencies (CRAs) ==
Consumer reporting agencies (CRAs) are entities that collect and disseminate information about consumers to be used for credit evaluation and certain other purposes, including employment. Credit bureaus, a type of consumer reporting agency, hold a consumer&#x27;s credit report in their databases. CRAs have a number of responsibilities under FCRA, including the following:

# CRAs must maintain reasonable procedures to ensure the maximum possible accuracy of the information contained within a consumer&#x27;s report;
# Provide a consumer with information about him or her in the agency&#x27;s files and take steps to verify the accuracy of information disputed by a consumer;
# If negative information is removed as a result of a consumer&#x27;s dispute, it may not be reinserted without notifying the consumer in writing within five days; and,
# Remove negative information seven years after the date of first delinquency (except for bankruptcies (10 years) and tax liens (seven years from the time they are paid).

The three big CRAs—Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax—do not interact with information furnishers directly as a result of consumer disputes. They use a system called E-Oscar. In some areas of the country, however, there are other credit bureaus.

===Nationwide specialty consumer reporting agencies===
In addition to the three big CRAs, the FCRA also classifies dozens of other information technology companies as &quot;nationwide specialty consumer reporting agencies&quot; that produce individual consumer reports used to make credit determinations. Under Section 603 of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the term &quot;nationwide specialty consumer reporting agency&quot; means a consumer reporting agency that compiles and maintains files on consumers on a nationwide basis relating to:
# Medical records or payments;
# Residential or tenant history;
# Check writing history;

Because these nationwide specialty consumer reporting agencies sell consumer credit report files, they are required to provide annual disclosures of their report files to any consumer who requests disclosure. A partial list of companies classified as nationwide specialty consumer reporting agencies under FCRA includes: Telecheck, ChoicePoint, Acxiom, Integrated Screening Partners, Innovis, the Insurance Services Office, Tenant Data Services, LexisNexis, Retail Equation, Central Credit, Teletrack, the MIB Group, United Health Group (Ingenix Division), and Milliman.

Although the major CRAs Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion are required by law to provide a central source website for consumers to request their reports, the nationwide specialty consumer reporting agencies are not required to provide a centralized online source for disclosure. The FCRA Section 612 merely requires nationwide specialty consumer reporting agencies to establish a streamlined process for consumers to request consumer reports, which shall include, at a minimum, the establishment by each such agency of a toll-free telephone number for such consumer disclosure requests.

<doc id="787058" wikidata="Q945883" url="?curid=787058" title="El Cid (film)">
<text>El Cid is a 1961 epic historical drama film directed by Anthony Mann and produced by Samuel Bronston. The film is loosely based on the life of the 11th-century Castilian knight and warlord Rodrigo Díaz de Vivar, called &quot;El Cid&quot; (from the Arabic al-sidi, meaning &quot;The Lord&quot;). The film stars Charlton Heston in the title role and Sophia Loren as El Cid&#x27;s wife Doña Jimena, spelled &quot;Chimene&quot; in the script and pronounced that way (shim-ain) in the film. The screenplay is credited to Fredric M. Frank, Philip Yordan and Ben Barzman, with uncredited contributions by Bernard Gordon.

During the late 1950s, Samuel Bronston had established his own production studio in Madrid, Spain. To strengthen cordial ties to the Spanish government ruled by Francisco Franco, Bronston began developing a biographical film of El Cid. During his reign, Franco had admired and compared himself to El Cid. In 1960, Bronston purchased Frederic M. Frank&#x27;s script, and hired Anthony Mann to direct the film. Philip Yordan was later hired to rewrite the script, although Mann later recruited Ben Barzman to write the final screenplay. Before principal photography began, Bronston purchased the rights to a rival biographical film developed by Cesáreo González&#x27;s Aspa Films, making the film an Italian co-production. On a $7 million budget, filming of &quot;El Cid&quot; began in September 1960 and concluded in April 1961.

&quot;El Cid&quot; premiered on December 6, 1961 at the Metropole Theatre in London, and was released on December 14 in the United States. The film received largely positive reviews praising the performances of Heston and Loren, the cinematography, and the musical score. It went on to gross $26.6 million during its initial theatrical run. It was nominated for three Academy Awards for Best Art Direction, Best Music Score of a Dramatic or Comedy Picture, and Best Original Song.

==Plot==

General Ben Yusuf of the Almoravid dynasty has summoned all the emirs of Al-Andalus to North Africa. He chastises them for co-existing peacefully with their Christian neighbours, which goes against his dream of Islamic world domination. The emirs return to Spain with orders to resume hostilities with the Christians, while Ben Yusuf readies his army for a full-scale invasion.

Don Rodrigo Díaz de Vivar, on the way to his wedding with Doña Chimene, rescues a Spanish town from an invading Moorish army. Two of the emirs, al-Mu&#x27;tamin of Zaragoza and al-Kadir of Valencia, are captured. More interested in peace than in wreaking vengeance, Rodrigo escorts his prisoners to Vivar and releases them on the condition that they never again attack lands belonging to King Ferdinand of Castile. The emirs proclaim him &quot;El Cid&quot; (Castilian Spanish for the Arabic for milord: &quot;al-Sidi&quot;) and swear allegiance to him.

For his act of mercy, Don Rodrigo is accused of treason by Count Ordóñez. In court, the charge is supported by Chimene&#x27;s father, Count Gormaz, the king&#x27;s champion. Rodrigo&#x27;s aged father, Don Diego, angrily calls Gormaz a liar. Gormaz strikes Don Diego, challenging him to a duel. At a private meeting, Rodrigo begs Gormaz to ask the aged but proud Diego for forgiveness (for accusing Rodrigo of treason). Gormaz refuses, so Rodrigo fights the duel on Diego’s behalf and kills his opponent. Chimene witnesses the death of Gormaz and swears to avenge him, renouncing her affection for Rodrigo.

When the King of Aragon demands the city of Calahorra from Castile, Rodrigo asks Ferdinand to choose him as his champion. He wins the city in single combat to the death. In his new capacity he is sent on a mission to collect tribute from Moorish vassals to the Castilian crown. He asks that Chimene be given to him as his wife upon his return, so that he can provide for her. Chimene promises Count Ordóñez she will marry him instead if he kills Rodrigo. Ordóñez lays an ambush for Rodrigo and his men but is captured by al-Mu&#x27;tamin, to whom Rodrigo had earlier showed mercy. Rodrigo forgives the count and returns home to marry Chimene. The marriage is not consummated: Rodrigo will not touch her if she does not give herself to him out of love. Chimene instead goes to a convent.

King Ferdinand dies. His younger son, Prince Alfonso, tells the elder son, Prince Sancho, that their father wanted his kingdom divided among his heirs: Castile to Sancho, Asturias and León to Alfonso, and Calahorra to their sister, Princess Urraca. Sancho refuses to accept anything but an undivided kingdom as his birthright. After Alfonso instigates a knife fight, Sancho overpowers his brother and sends him to be imprisoned in Zamora. Rodrigo, who swore to protect all the king’s children, single-handedly defeats Alfonso&#x27;s guards and brings the prince to Calahorra. Sancho arrives to demand Alfonso, but Urraca refuses to hand him over. Rodrigo cannot take a side in the conflict because his oath was to serve them all equally.

Ben Yusuf arrives at Valencia, the fortified city guarding the beach where he plans to land his armada. To weaken his Spanish opponents he hires Dolfos, a warrior formerly trusted by Ferdinand, to assassinate Sancho and throw suspicion for the crime on Alfonso, who becomes the sole king. At Alfonso&#x27;s coronation, El Cid has him swear upon the Bible that he had no part in the death of his brother. Alfonso, genuinely innocent (although his ally Urraca was aware of the plot), is offended by the demand and banishes Rodrigo from Spain. Chimene discovers she still loves Rodrigo and voluntarily joins him in exile. Rodrigo makes his career as a soldier elsewhere in Spain, and he and Chimene have twin girls.

Years later, Rodrigo, now known widely as &quot;El Cid&quot;, is called back into the service of the king to protect Castile from Yusuf&#x27;s North African army. However, Alfonso rejects an alliance with El Cid&#x27;s Muslim friends, and rather than work directly with the king, El Cid allies himself with the emirs to besiege Valencia, where the cowardly al-Kadir has violated his oath of allegiance to Rodrigo and come out in support of Ben Yusuf.

After being defeated by the Moors at the Battle of Sagrajas, Alfonso seizes Chimene and her children and puts them in prison. Count Ordóñez rescues the three and brings them to Rodrigo, wanting to end his rivalry with El Cid and join him in the defense of Spain. Knowing that the citizens of Valencia are starving after the long siege, Rodrigo wins them over by throwing bread into the city with his catapults. Al-Kadir tries to intercede, but the Valencians kill him and open the gates to the besiegers. Emir al-Mu&#x27;tamin, Rodrigo&#x27;s army, and the Valencians offer the city&#x27;s crown to El Cid, but he refuses and instead sends the crown to King Alfonso.

Ben Yusuf arrives with his immense invasion army, and Valencia is the only barrier between him and Spain. Ordóñez is tortured and killed after being captured on a reconnaissance mission. The ensuing battle goes well for the defenders until El Cid is struck in the chest by an arrow and has to return to the city in plain sight of the Moorish army. Doctors inform him that they can probably remove the arrow and save his life, but he will be incapacitated for a long time after the surgery. Unwilling to abandon his army at this critical moment, Rodrigo obtains a promise from Chimene to leave the arrow and let him ride back into battle, dying or dead. A guilt-ridden King Alfonso comes to his bedside and asks for his forgiveness. Rodrigo grants it, and Alfonso promises to look after Rodrigo&#x27;s children.

Rodrigo dies, and a rumor of his death spreads. His allies honor Rodrigo&#x27;s final wish. With help of an iron frame they prop up his body, its eyes staring straight ahead. Dressed in full armor and holding an unfurled banner, he is strapped to the back of his horse, Babieca. Guided by King Alfonso and Emir al-Mu&#x27;tamin riding on either side, the horse leads a mounted charge against Ben Yusuf&#x27;s now terrified soldiers, who believe that El Cid has risen from the dead. In the panic that ensues, Ben Yusuf is thrown from his horse and is crushed beneath Babieca&#x27;s hooves, leaving his scattered army to be annihilated. King Alfonso leads Christians and Moors alike in a prayer for God to receive the soul &quot;of the purest knight of all&quot;. The film ends with El Cid&#x27;s horse riding along the coast.

==Production==
===Development===
In 1955, producer Samuel Bronston entered into cooperation with the United States Navy to film the biopic &quot;John Paul Jones&quot; (1959). The country of Spain was recommended to him as a filming location by Jose Maria Areilza, then-Spanish Ambassador to the United States when they were seated together at a dinner party in Washington, D.C. Bronston agreed and established his namesake production studio near Las Rozas in Madrid. During filming, the production was allowed by the Francoist Spanish government to film sequences inside the Royal Palace of Madrid. After &quot;John Paul Jones&quot; (1959) was completed, Bronston and director John Farrow began developing their next project &quot;King of Kings&quot; (1961). While the project was in development, in 1958, Bronston began considering &quot;El Cid&quot; as a potential project, but it would be set aside until &quot;King of Kings&quot; reached completion. At the time, Francisco Franco had compared himself to Rodrigo Díaz de Vivar, the Cid, and Bronston readily agreed to assist the Franco government. The Spanish Ministry of Information and Tourism had initiated &#x27;Operación Propaganda Exterior&#x27; to increase Spanish trade and tourism, to which Bronston attended frequent meetings to discuss issues of common interest.

In April 1960, &quot;Variety&quot; announced that Bronston was independently producing three films in Spain, one of which included &quot;El Cid&quot;. It was also reported that Bronston had purchased the rights to Fredric M. Frank&#x27;s 140-page treatment for the film. In July 1960, Anthony Mann had signed on to direct the film. In an interview, Mann called the film &quot;a Spanish Western&quot;. However, principal photography was nearly delayed when Cesáreo González&#x27;s Aspa Films filed an infringement claim against Bronston over the project&#x27;s thematic similarities. Previously, in July 1956, it was reported that two biopics of El Cid were in development: an American-Spanish co-production with Anthony Quinn set to star, and a collaboration between RKO, Milton Sperling, and Marvin Gosch. By August 1960, Bronston reached a deal to have Aspa Films and Robert Haggiag&#x27;s Dear Film involved in the production making the project an American-Italian-Spanish co-production.

===Writing===
The first writer assigned was Fredric M. Frank. He was flown into Spain to begin finalizing the screenplay for the initial start of shooting by July 1960. In the same month, Philip Yordan had been hired to co-write the screenplay. Yordan remarked that he had found Frank&#x27;s treatment to be a &quot;terrible script&quot; and rewrote it. By their mid-November start date, the script had been rewritten, with Heston describing it as an improvement over the first draft.

Two days prior to filming, Sophia Loren had read the latest draft and was displeased with her dialogue. She then recommended hiring blacklisted screenwriter Ben Barzman to revise it. Mann subsequently got Barzman onto a plane to Rome, after which he gave him the current screenplay draft. Barzman read the draft and found it to be unusable. With filming set to begin, Barzman received a copy of the seventeenth-century play &quot;Le Cid&quot; by Pierre Corneille from the library of the French embassy in Madrid and used it as the basis for a new screenplay. Years later, in 1967, Mann told Bertrand Tavernier that &quot;not one line&quot; in the shooting script was written by Yordan. However, Barzman&#x27;s screen credit would not be added to the film until 1999.

However, Barzman&#x27;s script lacked powerful romantic scenes, which again displeased Loren. Screenwriter Bernard Gordon, who was also blacklisted, was hired to rewrite these scenes. He stated: &quot;So [Philip] Yordan yanked me from what I was doing in Paris and said, &#x27;Write me three or four love scenes for Loren and Heston.&#x27; Well, what the hellhe was paying me $1500 a week, which was a lot more than I made any other way, and I just took orders and I sat down and I wrote four scenes, about three or four pages each. Whatever love scenes there are in the picture I wrote. And they sent them to Loren and said, OK, she&#x27;ll do the picture, so I was a little bit of a hero at that point&quot;. Loren had also hired screenwriter Basilio Franchina to translate the dialogue into Italian and then back into simpler English, with which she felt comfortable.

For script advice and historical truth, Spanish historian Ramón Menéndez Pidal served as the historical consultant to the screenwriters and the director of the film. The naturalist Felix Rodriguez de la Fuente also helped to use raptors and other birds.

===Casting===

Charlton Heston and Sophia Loren were Bronston&#x27;s first choices for the two leads. Writing in his autobiography, in the summer of 1960, Heston had received Frank&#x27;s draft which he described as not &quot;good, ranging from minimally OK to crappy&quot;, but he was intrigued with the role. He then flew out to Madrid to meet with Bronston, Yordan, and Mann who all discussed the role with him. On July 26, 1960, his casting was announced. As he conducted research into his role, Heston read &quot;El Cantar de mio Cid&quot; and arranged a meeting with historian Ramón Menéndez Pidal.

Initially, Loren was unavailable to portray Ximena, and Jeanne Moreau was briefly considered as a replacement. Another account states that Ava Gardner was approached for the role, but backed out feeling that Heston&#x27;s part was bigger than hers. Mann then suggested his wife Sara Montiel, but Heston and Bronston refused. Ultimately, Loren became available but only for ten to twelve weeks, for which she was paid $1 million. This made Loren the second actress, after Elizabeth Taylor, to earn $1 million for a film. Bronston also agreed to pay $200 a week for her hairdresser.

Orson Welles was initially approached to play Ben Yusuf, but he insisted that a double do his on-set performance while he would dub in his lines during post-production. Bronston refused. British actors were primarily sought for the other male roles, for which most of the principal casting was completed by early November 1960. That same month, on November 30, Hurd Hatfield had joined the cast. At least four actresses screen-tested for the role of Doña Urraca. Geneviève Page won the part, and her casting was announced on December 16, 1960.

===Filming===

Principal photography began November 14, 1960 at Sevilla Studios in Madrid, Spain. Filming was reported to spend at least four months of exterior shooting in Spain which would be followed by a final month of interior shooting at the Cinecittà Studios in Rome.

Loren&#x27;s scenes were shot first, as her availability was initially for twelve weeks. Shooting lasted for eight hours a day, as the production employed French hours. By January 1961, her part was considerably expanded in response to the early dailies. Simultaneously, second-unit filming for the battle sequences was directed by Yakima Canutt. As filming had progressed, by December 1960, location shooting for action sequences was shot along the Guadarrama Pass. Specifically for the film&#x27;s second half, Heston suggested growing a gray-flecked beard and wearing a facial scar to showcase Don Rodrigo&#x27;s battle scarring within the ten-year gap.

With the film&#x27;s first half nearly complete, shooting for the battle of Valencia was filmed on location in Peñíscola as the actual city had become modernized. For three months, hundreds of production design personnel constructed city walls to block off modern buildings. 1,700 trained infantrymen were leased from the Spanish Army as well as 500 mounted riders from Madrid&#x27;s Municipal Honor Guard. 15 war machines and siege towers were constructed from historical artwork, and 35 boats were decorated with battlements to serve as the Moorish fleet. Tensions between Mann and Canutt rose as Mann sought to shoot the sequence himself. With the sequence nearly finished, Canutt spent three days filming pick-up shots, which would be edited within the longer, master shots that Mann had shot earlier. In his autobiography, Heston expressed his dissatisfaction with Mann&#x27;s insistence on shooting the battle scenes himself, feeling Canutt was more competent and efficient.

In April 1961, the last sequence to be shot for the film—the duel for Calahorra—was filmed near the Belmonte Castle. The scene was directed by Canutt. Prior to filming, Heston and British actor Christopher Rhodes trained for a month in the use in weaponry under stunt coordinator Enzo Musumeci Greco. The fight took five days to shoot, totaling 31 hours of combat before editing. of film was shot for the sequence, which was ultimately edited down to remaining in the film.

===Music===
The instrumental score was written by Miklós Rózsa, who had scored Bronston&#x27;s previous film &quot;King of Kings&quot; (1961). Rózsa had been assigned by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) to score &quot;Mutiny on the Bounty&quot; (1962) but was appalled after reading the script and backed out. Because &quot;El Cid&quot; was an Italian co-production, Mario Nascimbene, a native Italian composer, had been hired but he refused Bronston&#x27;s demand to adapt Jules Massenet&#x27;s opera &quot;Le Cid&quot; into the score. Bronston turned to Rózsa instead. Regardless, Italian financiers insisted Nascimbene be credited, to which Bronston asked Rózsa for his permission to have him credited on the Italian film prints. Rózsa agreed, as long as Nascimbene make no claim for royalties and his credit appeared only on the Italian prints.

After meeting with Ramón Menéndez Pidal, Rózsa began an extensive one-month study into medieval Spanish music. He took inspiration from the 12th-century musical piece titled the &quot;Cantigas de Santa Maria&quot;, compiled by Alfonso X of Castile; the &quot;Llibre Vermell&quot;, a 14th-century manuscript collection from the monastery of Montserrat, and a collection of Spanish folk songs from Felipe Pedrell. Additionally, Rózsa composed a love theme for Rodrigo and Chimene&#x27;s relationship. However, Paul Francis Webster was hired to write lyrics for the theme, much to Rózsa&#x27;s dislike.

Rózsa recorded a score totaling two hours and 16 minutes in Rome throughout ten days. However, more than 23 minutes of the score was removed during post-production, as the music would have superseded the film&#x27;s sound effects. Rózsa appealed to have the music restored, without success. After the film&#x27;s premiere, he canceled a publicity tour promoting the score.

===Costume design===
Costume designers Veniero Colasanti and John Moore oversaw a staff of 400 wardrobe seamstresses which spent roughly $500,000 on manufacturing medieval-style clothing at a local supply company, Casa Cornejo, near Madrid. The most expensive costume piece was a black-and-gold velvet robe worn by King Alfonso VI during the film, which was tailored in Florence, Italy from materials specially woven in Venice. In total, over 2,000 costumes were used for the film. For the weaponry, Samuel Bronston Productions sought several local Spanish companies. Casa Cornejo provided 3,000 war helmets and hundreds of iron-studded leather jerkins. The Garrido Brothers factory, located in Toledo, Spain, worked under an exclusive contract for eight months producing 7,000 swords, scimitars, and lances. Anthony Luna, a Madrid prop manufacturer, crafted 40,000 arrows, 5,780 shields, 1,253 medieval harnesses, 800 maces and daggers, 650 suits of mail (woven from hemp and coated with a metal varnish), and 500 saddles.

==Release==
&quot;El Cid&quot; had its world premiere at the Metropole Theatre in Victoria, London on December 6, 1961. On December 14, 1961, the film premiered at the Warner Theatre in New York City and premiered at the Carthay Circle Theatre in Los Angeles on December 18. For the film&#x27;s international release, distributors included the Rank Organization releasing the film in Britain, Dear Film in Italy, Astoria Filmes in Portugal, Filmayer in Spain, and Melior in Belgium.

In August 1993, the film was re-released in theaters by Miramax Films having undergone a digital and color restoration supervised by Martin Scorsese. The re-release added 16 minutes of restored footage back to the film&#x27;s initial 172-minute running time for a total of 188 minutes.

===Home media===
The film was released on January 29, 2008 as a deluxe edition and a collector&#x27;s edition DVD. Both DVDs included bonus materials including archival cast interviews, as well as 1961 promotional radio interviews with Loren and Heston; an audio commentary from Bill Bronston (son of Samuel Bronston) and historian-author Neal M. Rosendorf; a documentary on the importance of film preservation and restoration; biographical featurettes on Samuel Bronston, Anthony Mann, and Miklos Rozsa; and a &quot;making of&quot; documentary, &quot;Hollywood Conquers Spain.&quot; The collector&#x27;s edition DVD also included a reproduction of the premiere&#x27;s souvenir program and a comic book, as well as six color production stills.

==Reception==

Overall, it returned $12 million in box office rentals (the distributor&#x27;s share of the box office gross).

===Critical response===
====Contemporary reviews====
Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote &quot;it is hard to remember a picture--not excluding &quot;Henry V&quot;, &quot;Ivanhoe&quot;, &quot;Helen of Troy&quot; and, naturally, &quot;Ben-Hur&quot;--in which scenery and regal rites and warfare have been so magnificently assembled and photographed as they are in this dazzler ... The pure graphic structure of the pictures, the imposing arrangement of the scenes, the dynamic flow of the action against strong backgrounds, all photographed with the 70mm color camera and projected on the Super-Technirama screen, give a grandeur and eloquence to this production that are worth seeing for themselves&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; praised the film as &quot;a fast-action color-rich, corpse-strewn, battle picture...The Spanish scenery is magnificent, the costumes are vivid, the chain mail and Toledo steel gear impressive.&quot; A review in &quot;Time&quot; magazine felt that &quot;Surprisingly, the picture is good—maybe not as good as &quot;Ben-Hur&quot;, but anyway better than any spectacle since &quot;Spartacus&quot;.&quot; They also noted that &quot;Bronston&#x27;s epic has its embarrassments. El Cid himself, too, crudely contemporarized seems less the scourge of the heathen than a champion of civil rights. And there are moments when Hero Heston looks as though he needs a derrick to help him with that broadsword. Nevertheless, Anthony Mann has managed his immense material with firmness, elegance, and a sure sense of burly epic rhythm.&quot;

&quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot; praised the performances from Heston and Loren and summarized the film as &quot;raw and strong, brooding and challenging, romantic and powerfully dramatic. It is motion picture entertainment ascending new heights of pomp, pageantry, panoply.&quot; Philip K. Scheuer of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; opened his review writing, &quot;&quot;El Cid&quot; brings back the excitement of movie-making; it may even bring back the excitement of movie-going. It&#x27;s as big as &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; if not bigger. If it had put a few more connectives in the narrative, if it had not thrown in an excess of everything else in three hours running time, it might have been great.&quot; A review in &quot;Newsweek&quot; described the film as being &quot;crammed with jousts and battles, and its sound track is reminiscent of Idlewild airport on a busy day, but the dramatics in it explode with all the force of a panful of popcorn.&quot; It also derided Mann&#x27;s direction as &quot;slow, stately, and confused, while Miss Loren and Heston spend most of the picture simply glaring at each other.&quot;

====Retrospective reviews====
During its 1993 re-release, Martin Scorsese praised &quot;El Cid&quot; as &quot;one of the greatest epic films ever made&quot;. James Berardinelli of &quot;Reel Views&quot; gave the film three stars out of four. In his review, he felt that &quot;&quot;El Cid&quot; turns more often to the ridiculous than the sublime. Perhaps if the movie didn&#x27;t take itself so seriously, there wouldn&#x27;t be opportunities for unintentional laughter, but, from the bombastic dialogue to the stentorian score, &quot;El Cid&quot; is about as self-important as a motion picture can be. Regardless, there are still moments of breathtaking, almost transcendant splendor, when the film makers attain the grand aspirations they strive for.&quot; Richard Christiansen for the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four. He wrote &quot;watching the movie today is something of a chore. Much of its celebration of heroic romanticism seems either silly, inflated or crudely flat in this non-heroic age.&quot; He also felt Heston and Loren lacked romantic chemistry.

Richard Corliss, reviewing for &quot;Time&quot;, wrote that &quot;Like the best action films, &quot;El Cid&quot; is both turbulent and intelligent, with characters who analyze their passions as they eloquently articulate them. The Court scenes, in particular, have the complex intrigue, if not quite the poetry, of a Shakespearean history play. This richness is especially evident in the film&#x27;s love story.&quot; At the film review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 93% based on 14 reviews, with an average rating of 6.9/10. On Metacritic, the film has a score of 79 based on 19 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

<doc id="787086" wikidata="Q3153585" url="?curid=787086" title="Abortion in France">
<text>Abortion in France is legal upon request until 14 weeks after conception (16 weeks after the pregnant woman&#x27;s last menstrual period). Abortions at later stages of pregnancy up until birth are allowed if two physicians certify that the abortion will be done to prevent injury to the physical or mental health of the pregnant woman; a risk to the life of the pregnant woman; or that the child will suffer from a particularly severe illness recognized as incurable. The abortion law was liberalized by the Veil Act in 1975.

==History==

The First French Republic saw the act of abortion being changed from an act punishable by death to a felony with a sentence of up to 20 years in prison. When the 1810 Napoleonic Code was introduced as a revision of the French Penal Code of 1791, as well as the Code of Offences and Penalties of 1795, abortion retained its felony status. Alongside this, the new penal code made it more difficult for women to divorce their husbands.

In 1920, new abortion laws prohibited the act of abortion, as well as the use of contraception, on the grounds of needing new babies to make up for the loss of population caused by World War I and to boost the birth rate of France that had been considerably lower than other European countries for over a century. The introduction of the Law of 27 March 1923 stated that whoever induced a miscarriage was punished with up to 5 years imprisonment, as well as a fine of up to 10,000 FF, while the woman having the abortion could be imprisoned for up to 3 years.

Just a month before the invasion of Poland, the Penal Code was altered to permit abortions, but only in the instance where the mother&#x27;s life was in danger. However, with the German Occupation and the implementation of the Vichy Government, abortion was made a capital crime, punishable by death, in the Law of 15 February 1942. The last person to be executed for abortion was Marie-Louise Giraud, a &quot;faiseuse d&#x27;anges&quot; (French slang; literally, &quot;maker of angels&quot;) who performed abortions in the region of Cherbourg. For her assisted abortions, she was sentenced to death by guillotine on 30 July 1943.

Following the Liberation of Paris in 1944, the death penalty for abortion was abolished, but abortion continued to be prosecuted vigorously. Illegal abortion rates remained fairly high during the post-war period, and increasing numbers of women began to travel to the United Kingdom to procure abortions after the UK legalized abortion in 1967.

During the period of civil unrest during and after the events of May 1968, a new civil rights movement was becoming prominent throughout the media, campaigning for more equal rights and opportunities for women. The &quot;Mouvement de Libération des Femmes&#x27;s&quot; (&quot;The Women&#x27;s Liberation Front&quot;) main goal was to advocate for women&#x27;s right of autonomy from their husbands, as well as rights that pertained to the use of contraception and legalization of abortion.

In 1971, the &quot;Manifesto of the 343&quot;, an open letter and petition, was written by Simone de Beauvoir and published in . It included the signatures of 343 women who admitted to having had an illegal abortion (punishable by up to 10 years in prison at the time). The petition included the names of many famous female personalities, including Jeanne Moreau and Catherine Deneuve. The manifesto aimed to highlight the prevalence of abortion in French society, despite its clandestine nature, as well as to call for abortion to be made legal, to provide more safe and hygienic spaces for women who want to have an abortion. Later the same year, lawyer Gisèle Halimi, herself one of the 343 women, formed her own group, &quot;&quot; (&quot;To Choose&quot;), which worked to protect those who had signed the petition.

In 1975, La Loi Veil (&quot;The Veil Act&quot;) was passed, decriminalizing abortion in France. The law was introduced by the presiding Health Minister Simone Veil, under Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing. D&#x27;Estaing had promised to decriminalize abortion during his campaign; however, Jean Lecanuet, then Minister of Justice, refused to defend the law on personal and ethical grounds, and so, it was up to Veil to prepare the law for vote. The debate that preceded the eventual passing of the vote was accompanied by violent attacks and demonstrations comparing Veil, a concentration camp survivor, with Hitler. In her speech before the National Assembly on 26 November 1974, Veil declared the need for the legalization of abortion, to bring equality in France, as well as explaining to the majority-male assembly that current French law did not protect women who were suffering from the social exclusion and shame as a result of illegal abortions, as well as the after-effects that led to illnesses (such as sepsis) and even death, calling for the law to offer them protection with a change of law to legalize abortions.

The Veil Act (Law 75–17 of 15 January 1975), permitted a woman to receive an abortion on request until the tenth week of pregnancy. This was a temporary law with a sunset clause after 5 years. The law was renewed permanently in December 1979.

Since 1982, much of the costs of abortions have been taken into charge by the French social security system, which allows women in France to access abortion free of charge. France was the first country to legalize the use of Mifepristone as an abortifacient in 1988, allowing its use up to seven weeks of pregnancy under the supervision of a physician, while vacuum aspiration is used for up to 12 weeks.

==21st century liberalization==

Several reforms took place in the 21st century, further liberalizing access to abortion. The ten-week limit was extended to the twelfth week in 2001, and it was extended to fourteen weeks in 2022. Also since 2001, minors no longer need mandatory parental consent. A pregnant girl under the age of 18 may ask for an abortion without consulting her parents first if she is accompanied to the clinic by an adult of her choice, who must not tell her parents or any third party about the abortion. Until 2015, the law imposed a seven-day &quot;cool-off&quot; period between the patient&#x27;s first request for an abortion and a written statement confirming her decision (the delay could be reduced to two days if the patient was getting close to 12 weeks). That mandatory waiting period was abolished on 9 April 2015.

In reaction to the Supreme Court of the United States&#x27;s &quot;Dobbs v. Jackson Women&#x27;s Health Organization&quot; ruling, Mathilde Panot, the leader of the La France insoumise group in the National Assembly, introduced a bill for an amendment adding the right to a safe abortion to the Constitution. It passed on a 337–32 vote on 24 November 2023. However, a private member&#x27;s bill for a constitutional amendment needs to be approved by referendum; in order to avoid one, the government introduced a similar bill in December. It was passed 433–30 by the lower house in January and by the Senate 267–50 in February.

The amendment, which takes the form of a one-line addition to article 34 (the list of matters on which Parliament may legislate), was given final approval in a congress (joint session) of Parliament on 4 March 2024, in a 780 to 72 vote. It was signed into law by President Emmanuel Macron on 8 March (International Women&#x27;s Day). This amendment made France, as of passage, the only nation to guarantee the right to an abortion in their constitution. The amendment describes abortion as a &quot;guaranteed freedom&quot;; while Yugoslavia included similar measures in 1974 guaranteeing the right to &quot;decide on having children&quot;, the French amendment is the first to explicitly guarantee abortion.

<text>A marksmanship ribbon is a United States Navy, Air Force, Space Force, and Coast Guard award that is issued to its members who pass a weapons qualification course and achieve an above-average score. Additionally, there are select state National Guard organizations that award marksmanship ribbons for high placement in state-level marksmanship competitions.

==U.S. Navy==
The U.S. Navy has issued these two marksmanship awards since 1920: the &quot;Navy Pistol Marksmanship Ribbon&quot; which is currently awarded for qualification on the Beretta M9 9mm pistol, and the &quot;Navy Rifle Marksmanship Ribbon&quot; which is currently awarded for qualification on the M4 variant.

The Navy issues the marksmanship ribbon in three levels of precedence: Expert, Sharpshooter, and Marksman. The basic ribbon is awarded for the Marksman level while the specific ribbon device is awarded for qualification as a Sharpshooter or Expert. Those receiving an Expert qualification receive the Marksmanship Medal and Marksmanship Ribbon.
===Retired ribbons===

The Navy issued the &quot;Distinguished Marksman and Pistol Ribbon&quot; between 1942 and 1951 to recognize those who had earned a Distinguished Marksman or Pistol Shot Badge.

In 1952 the Secretary of the Navy ordered that the ribbon be divided into two new awards: the &quot;Distinguished Marksman Ribbon&quot;, to denote distinguished marksmanship with a rifle, and the &quot;Distinguished Pistol Shot Ribbon&quot;, to denote distinguished marksmanship with a pistol.
==U.S. Air Force and U.S. Space Force==

The U.S. Air Force and U.S. Space Force awards a single ribbon, known as the &quot;Small Arms Expert Marksmanship Ribbon&quot;, for an expert qualification on either the M16 rifle, M4 carbine or the M9 or M17/18 pistol. The ribbon is issued in only one degree; however, a inch bronze star may be worn on the ribbon for those who have qualified expert on both the service rifle and pistol. The ribbon was authorized by the Secretary of the Air Force on Aug. 28, 1962, and was awarded to all Air Force and Space Force members who qualified after Jan. 1, 1963. Prior to the conception of a ribbon, Air Force members were awarded with the United States Air Force Small Arms Marksmanship Certificate of Achievement (AF Form 1193 Jan 1961).

==U.S. Coast Guard==

The U.S. Coast Guard Marksmanship Ribbons are issued under the same criteria as the U.S. Navy, but Coast Guardsmen use a .40 cal SIG Sauer P229R DAK pistol instead of the Navy&#x27;s M9 pistol. The Coast Guard issues two ribbons, known as the &quot;Coast Guard Pistol Marksmanship Ribbon&quot; and the &quot;Coast Guard Rifle Marksmanship Ribbon&quot;. The ribbon device is awarded for qualification at the higher levels of sharpshooter and expert. Like the Navy, for those who receive an expert qualification, the Marksmanship Medal is awarded instead of the Marksmanship Ribbon.

==U.S. National Guard==

Once a year, thousands of U.S. Army and Air National Guard shooters (champion marksmanship teams from each state) compete against each other at the Winston P. Wilson Rifle and Pistol Championships. In the Missouri National Guard, the top twelve guardsmen selected to represent their state at the Winston P. Wilson matches are awarded the Governor&#x27;s Twelve Ribbon which is worn on dress uniforms; any guardsman who earns the award more than once wear Hawthorn Cluster device(s) on top of the ribbon. In addition, these guardsman are awarded the Governor&#x27;s Twelve Tab for wear on the combat uniform.
Similarly, the Adjutant General of Missouri awards the Adjutant General&#x27;s Twenty Ribbon to soldiers and airmen who qualify among the top twenty competitors at the Missouri State Combat Matches conducted each year; specifically the top eight combat rifle shooters, the top eight pistol shooters, the top two light machine gun teams, and the top two scout/sniper teams. In addition to this ribbon, these guardsman are also awarded the Adjutant General&#x27;s Twenty Combat Badge for wear on the combat uniform.

Guardsmen are authorized to wear these ribbons as a permanent decoration on service dress uniforms, to the left of federal awards, when operating under Title 32 (state control) status. When federalized (Title 10), guardsman cannot wear these ribbons until they return to Title 32 status.

==Additional Information==
The U.S. Army and U.S. Marine Corps provide weapons qualification badges instead of a marksmanship ribbon. For the services that award the marksmanship ribbon, re-qualification is not necessary once a service member has obtained the award, and the ribbon may be worn throughout an individual&#x27;s career. In the Navy and Coast Guard, the marksmanship ribbon may be upgraded with a specific ribbon device if a higher qualification is achieved.

<doc id="787129" wikidata="Q3494933" url="?curid=787129" title="Abortion in Germany">
<text>Abortion in Germany is illegal except to save the life of the mother but is nonpunishable during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy upon condition of mandatory counseling. The same goes later in pregnancy in cases that the pregnancy poses an important danger to the physical or mental health of the pregnant woman. In the case that the abortion is because of a rape, counseling is not mandatory. The woman needs to receive counseling, called &#x27; (&quot;pregnancy-conflict counseling&quot;), at least three days prior to the abortion and must take place at a state-approved centre, which afterwards gives the applicant a&#x27; (&quot;certificate of counseling&quot;).

Doctors provide medication to cause the abortion, and observe to ensure there are no negative reactions to the medication.

==Law==
Abortion is illegal under Section 218 of the German criminal code, and punishable by up to three years in prison (or up to five years for &quot;reckless&quot; abortions or those against the pregnant woman&#x27;s will). Section 218a of the German criminal code, called &quot;Exception to liability for abortion&quot;, makes an exception for abortions with counseling in the first trimester, and for medically necessary abortions and abortions due to unlawful sexual acts (such as sexual abuse of a minor or rape) thereafter.

All abortions in Germany must be performed by a medical doctor.

==Statistics==
Abortion-numbers had been falling over the last 25 years, there were 130,000-135,000 per year between 1996 and 2002, but this had fallen to a low of fewer than 99,000 abortions in 2016 and since then stabilized at around 100,000 abortions yearly.

, the abortion rate was 129 abortions per 1,000 live births.

==History==
===Early===
Abortion legislation was codified in item 133 of the Constitutio Criminalis Carolina (1532). Later were particular laws in Germany, e.g. in Prussia part 2 title 20 section 986-990 of General State Laws for the Prussian States (1794). 
1851 it was codified in sections 181 and 182 of the Penal Code for Prussia, which formed the basis for the Penal Code of the North German Federation (1870). On 15 May 1871, following the Proclamation of the German Empire, the latter code was incorporated into sections 218–220 of the Penal Code for the German Reich (Strafgesetzbuch), taking effect on 1 January 1872. Section 218 outlawed abortion, requiring a penal term for the woman and any involved person. Legalization of abortion was first widely discussed in Germany during the early 20th century. During the Weimar Republic, such discussion led 1926 to a reduction in the penalty for abortion, and in 1927 a court&#x27;s decision – similar to the United Kingdom decision &quot;R v Bourne&quot; – decriminalized abortion in cases of grave danger to the life of the mother. 

===Nazi era===
Nazi Germany&#x27;s eugenics laws severely punished abortion for women belonging to the &quot;Aryan race&quot;, but permitted abortion on wider and more explicit grounds than before if the fetus was believed to be deformed or disabled or if termination otherwise was deemed desirable on eugenic grounds, such as the child or either parent suspected of being carrier of a genetic disease. Sterilization of the parents also took place in some such cases. In cases where the parents were Jewish, abortion was also not punished.

The severest abortion prohibitions were incorporated into law on 9 March 1943. Section 218 stated that &quot;a woman who kills her fetus or permits such a killing by another will be punished by a prison sentence and, in especially serious cases, by penitentiary. An attempt is punishable. Whoever else kills the fetus of a pregnant woman will be punished by a penitentiary sentence, in milder cases by prison. If the perpetrator through such deeds continuously impairs the vitality of the German nation, the death penalty is imposed. Whoever procures for the pregnant woman a means or objects for killing the fetus will be punished by prison sentence, and in especially serious cases, by penitentiary&quot;.
During World War II, abortion policy in Nazi Germany varied depending on the people group and territory the policy was directed at. The commonality between policies was its purpose in promoting the birth rate and population of the &quot;Aryan race&quot; and minimizing the population of others (such as Slavs), and those deemed a burden on German society such as the children of disabled and mentally ill persons. Forced abortions of &quot;Ostarbeiter&quot; for instance was referenced in documents from the Trials of War Criminals Before the Nuremberg Military Tribunals. It has been categorized as a part of Nazi Germany&#x27;s &quot;systematic program of genocide, aimed at the destruction of foreign nations and ethnic groups&quot;.

While abortion had been punished by the law in Poland previously, under Nazi occupation these prohibitions were removed and abortion was instead encouraged subject to whether the child had a German father or could be racially &quot;Germanized.&quot; Similarly, the policy for Eastern female workers, was that pregnancy may be &quot;interrupted&quot; if the pregnant woman so &quot;desired&quot; which gave the appearance of consent on behalf of the mother. For pregnancies of non-German woman, whether an abortion would be permitted also depended on the mother&#x27;s nationality, but primarily turned on whether the father was German or if the mother was of a race that could be &quot;Germanized.&quot; If the child was deemed to be of a race that could contribute to the German race and the father was German then an abortion, or as described in Nazi documents an &quot;interruption of pregnancy,&quot; would likely not be permitted. Such determinations were made by the Race and Settlement Main Office (RuSHA)– who would determine the fate of the child.

===Post-war===
After World War II, abortion remained broadly illegal throughout both German states: West Germany retained the legal situation of 1927, while East Germany passed a slightly more encompassing set of exceptions in 1950. The legal requirements in the West were extremely strict, and often led women to seek abortions elsewhere, particularly in the Netherlands. It has been estimated that about 2 million women had abortions each year between 1945 and 1948, mostly in the Soviet zone. An abortion cost around 1,000 marks and was performed without anaesthesia. 6000 Berlin women died each year in the Soviet zone from resulting complications.

On 6 June 1971, the cover of the West German magazine &quot;Stern&quot; ran with the headline &quot;We&#x27;ve had abortions!&quot; (German: &quot;Wir haben abgetrieben!&quot;), and featured the pictures of 30 women who had done so. 374 women, some, but not all, of whom had a high public profile, publicly confessed that they had had pregnancies terminated, which at that time was illegal. They challenged §218 and asserted their right to abortion. However, since 2010 a small number of those 374 women publicly confessed that they had either never aborted or not before 1971 and had actually lied for the Stern cover in 1971 because of their political beliefs.

East Germany legalized elective abortion until 12 weeks of pregnancy in 1972, in the Volkskammer&#x27;s only non-unanimous vote ever in the first 40 years of its existence. After West Germany followed suit in 1974, its new law was struck down in 1975 by the Constitutional Court as inconsistent with the human rights guarantee of the constitution. It held that the unborn has a right to life, that abortion is an act of killing, and that the fetus deserves legal protection throughout its development. Nevertheless, the legal opinion strongly hinted that increasing the number of situations in which abortion was legal might be constitutional.

In East Germany, Female Vertragsarbeiter foreign workers were not allowed to become pregnant during their stay. If they did, they were forced to have an abortion or faced deportation.

In 1976, West Germany revised abortion law. According to the new modifications to §218, penalties for abortions are not enforced on doctors and patients when several conditions are met: terminations must be no later than twelve weeks of pregnancy – or must be performed for reasons of medical necessity, sexual crimes, or serious social or emotional distress – if approved by two doctors, and subject to counseling and a three-day waiting period. In 1989, a Bavarian doctor was sentenced to two and a half years in prison, and 137 of his patients were fined for failing to meet the certification requirements.

The two laws had to be reconciled after reunification. A new law was passed by the Bundestag in 1992, permitting first-trimester elective abortion, subject to counseling and a three-day waiting period, and permitting late-term abortions when the physical or psychological health of the woman is seriously threatened. The law was quickly challenged in court by a number of individuals – including Chancellor Helmut Kohl – and by the State of Bavaria. The Constitutional Court decided a year later to maintain its earlier decision that the constitution protected the fetus from the moment of conception, but stated that it is within the discretion of parliament not to punish abortion in the first trimester, provided that the woman had submitted to state-regulated counseling intended to discourage termination and protect fetal life. Parliament passed such a law in 1995. Abortions are covered by public health insurance if the pregnancy was caused by sexual abuse, such as rape, or if the mother&#x27;s health is seriously endangered by the pregnancy. For women with low income, the state governments pay for an abortion.

In 2022, the Olaf Scholz coalition of social democrats, greens, and liberals, repealed paragraph 219a, together with votes from The Left. This allowed medical professionals to state on their websites what kinds of abortion procedures they offer.

<doc id="787165" wikidata="Q2867557" url="?curid=787165" title="Major League Baseball Players Association">
<text>The Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA) is the labor union representing all current Major League Baseball (MLB) and Minor League Baseball (MiLB) players. All players, managers, coaches, and athletic trainers who hold or have held a signed contract with a Major League club are eligible for membership in the Association. The MLBPA has three major divisions: a labor union, a business (Players Choice Group Licensing Program), and a charitable foundation (Major League Baseball Players Trust).

On August 28, 2022, the MLBPA publicly launched a campaign to help MiLB players unionize. On September 9, 2022, MLB voluntarily recognized the MLBPA as the union for over 5,500 MiLB players playing rookie level to Triple-A.

==Players Choice group licensing==
The MLBPA&#x27;s Players Choice group licensing program utilizes collective marketing to assist licensees and sponsors who want to associate their brands and products with that of Major League players, teams, and coaches. Through an individual agreement with each player, the MLBPA holds exclusive right to use, license and sublicense the names, numbers, nicknames, likenesses, signatures and other personal indicia (known as &quot;publicity rights&quot;) of active Major League Baseball players who are its members for use in connection with any product, brand, service or product line when more than two players are involved.

Among its other functions, the Players Choice licensing program also protects the rights of players from exploitation by unauthorized parties.

==Major League Baseball Players Trust==
Major League Baseball players also formed the Players Trust, a charitable foundation that is the first of its kind in professional sports. Through the Players Trust, Major Leaguers contribute their time, money and fame to call attention to important issues affecting those in need and to help encourage others to get involved in their own communities.

Many programs including Buses for Baseball, City Clinics, Medicines for Humanity, the Players Choice Awards, Volunteers of America, and MLB Players STEM League are funded through the foundation.

===Action Team===
In 2003, the Major League Baseball Players Trust and Volunteers of America created the Action Team National Youth Volunteer Program to recruit and train high school students to become volunteers in their communities.

===Players Choice Awards===

The Players Choice Awards is an award ceremony held to recognize each season&#x27;s best performers, as chosen by the players themselves. Each Players Choice Awards winner designates the charity of his choice to receive a grant from the Player&#x27;s Trust.

==History==
The MLBPA was not the first attempt to unionize baseball players. Earlier attempts had included:
*Brotherhood of Professional Baseball Players - 1885 (founded by John Montgomery Ward)

In 1898, Baltimore Orioles players John McGraw, Hughie Jennings, Joe Kelley, and Willie Keeler discussed the formation of &quot;mutual defense organization&quot; analogous to a trade union and meant to protect the interests of the players.

*Players&#x27; Protective Association - 1900
*Fraternity of Professional Baseball Players of America - 1912
*National Baseball Players Association of the United States - 1922 (founded by Raymond Joseph Cannon)
*The American Baseball Guild – 1946 (founded by labor lawyer Robert Murphy)

===Leadership===
====Pre-unionized====
President
*Bob Feller: 1956–1959
Executive Director
*Frank Scott: May 1, 1959 – 1966

====Unionized====
Executive Director

====Marvin Miller era (1966–1983)====
The organization that would eventually become the MLBPA was conceived in , but it was not officially recognized as a union until . That year the newly recognized union hired Marvin Miller from the United Steel Workers of America to head the organization, serving as executive director until . During Miller&#x27;s tenure, base salaries, pension funds, licensing rights, and revenues increased.

In , Miller negotiated the first collective bargaining agreement (CBA) with the team owners, which raised the minimum salary from $6,000 to $10,000 per year. The CBA included arbitration to resolve disputes. The major leagues saw their first player strike in , in opposition to the owners&#x27; refusal to increase player pension funds.

In , when Oakland owner Charlie Finley failed to make a $50,000 payment into an insurance annuity as called for in Catfish Hunter&#x27;s contract, the MLBPA took the case to arbitration. The arbitrator ruled that Hunter could be a free agent.

When pitchers Andy Messersmith and Dave McNally had their 1974 contracts automatically renewed by their teams, the MLBPA supported them by challenging the reserve clause which was used by team owners to bind players to one team. On December 23, 1975, arbitrator Peter Seitz ruled in favor of the players. Following the Seitz decision, the modern free agent system was created, and the strength of the union was immeasurably increased.

Players and owners failed to come to terms over free agent compensation, which led to another strike in . In the late 1980s and early 1990s the MLBPA filed collusion charges, arguing that team owners had violated the collective bargaining agreement in the 1985–1987 seasons. The MLBPA won each case, resulting in &quot;second look&quot; free agents, and over $269 million in owner fines.

====Donald Fehr era (1985–2009)====

After Miller retired, Ken Moffett became the new executive director in December 1982, but in November 1983 he was dismissed, and Marvin Miller was named interim director. Donald Fehr, who joined the MLBPA as general counsel in 1977, was named acting director in December 1983.

The MLBPA under Fehr filed several grievances against MLB owners. In the late 1980s, MLB owners were accused of collusion to prevent player salaries from rising. The MLBPA filed grievances against the owners in 1986 and 1987. In 1987, arbitrator Tom Roberts found that owners had violated the terms of the Basic Agreement, with players later being awarded $10.5 million. In 1989, arbitrator George Nicolau found that owners had violated the Basic Agreement on the second grievance, with players awarded $38 million.

In 1988, the MLBPA filed another grievance against the owners for colluding to control player salaries. The MLBPA claims that the owners created an information bank to share information on players and restrain salaries. The MLBPA won this grievance in 1990, with a settlement being reached to award players a total of $280 million in damages for the collusion.

Under Fehr, the MLBPA dealt with a 32-day lockout by MLB owners in 1990. The MLBPA participated in a 232-day players strike in 1994 and 1995. While Fehr led the MLBPA, player salaries rose from an average of $413,000 to almost $3 million. The Collective Bargaining Agreements in 2002 and 2006 were reached without a strike by the players or a lockout by the owners. This was a period of 16 years without a work stoppage by either side.

Fehr was also a contributor in the creation of the World Baseball Classic international baseball tournament. 

====Michael Weiner &amp; Tony Clark era (2009–present)====
In 2009, Donald Fehr resigned from the position. The players selected Michael Weiner, who had worked for the union since 1988, as his replacement. On November 21, 2013, Weiner died after a 15-month battle with a non-operable brain tumor. Former All-Star Tony Clark, the deputy executive director, was named executive director on December 2, 2013, becoming the first former major league player to lead the union.

In 2016, the MLBPA celebrated its 50th anniversary as a union, commemorating the event at the 2016 All-Star Game with a golden anniversary logo.

Between December 2021 and March 2022, MLB owners enacted a lockout as the 2016 collective bargaining agreement expired, resulting in thefirst MLB work stoppage since the 1994–95 strike and the first lockout of the players since 1990. The lockout ended with a signing of a new CBA and resulted in no cancelled games for the 2022 season, although Opening Day was delayed one week.

In Fall 2022, the MLBPA became the union for all Minor League Baseball players.

In April 2024, the MLBPA put pressure on MLB following a controversy concerning the quality of uniforms following a switch in manufacturing from Majestic to Fanatics.

===Basic agreements===
In 1968, the Major League Baseball Players Association negotiated the first-ever Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) in professional sports. Several agreements have been negotiated since the original agreement, the latest of which, effective March 2022, will expire in 2026. The first ever CBA for Minor League Baseball players has been effective since March 2023 and will expire in 2027.

==MLBPA/MLB joint initiatives==
===Joint Drug Agreement===
The Joint Drug Agreement went into effect in December 2011 and is scheduled to terminate Dec. 1, 2016, the same date as the Basic Agreement. The prohibited substances section of the Joint Drug Agreement is updated annually.

===Domestic violence policy===
In August 2015, Major League Baseball and the MLBPA reached agreement on the Joint Domestic Violence, Sexual Assault and Child Abuse Policy, and is intended to provide a comprehensive policy addressing issues such as protecting the legal rights of players, treating violations seriously, holding players accountable through appropriate disciplinary measures and providing resources for the intervention and care of victims, families and the players themselves.

The terms of this joint policy cover four primary areas: Treatment &amp; Intervention; Investigations; Discipline; and Training, Education &amp; Resources.

===Youth baseball initiative===
In June 2016, executive director Tony Clark and MLB commissioner Rob Manfred, along with Curtis Granderson, Andrew McCutchen, Marquis Grissom, and Ken Griffey Jr., announced major initiatives within youth baseball in a press conference held at Citi Field.

On top of jointly donating over $2 million several youth-focused initiatives supported by current and former Major League player, other major initiatives included financial contributions to youth baseball projects and the creation of a partnership with Positive Coaching Alliance for the training of coaches and administrators from the Reviving Baseball in Inner Cities program.

==Miscellaneous==
===Salary cap===
As of 2023, Major League Baseball is the only major professional sports league in North America that does not have a salary cap; the MLS, NBA, NFL, and NHL all implement some sort of salary cap. MLB does have a luxury tax that penalizes clubs that exceed the designated amount for that season.

===Steroids===

The MLBPA was initially opposed to random steroid testing, claiming it to be a violation of the privacy of players. After the BALCO steroid scandal surrounding the alleged or actual involvement of several star players, the players dropped their opposition to a steroid testing program and developed a consensus that favored testing. Under pressure from US Congress which threatened to pass a law if the MLB&#x27;s drug policy was not strengthened, the MLBPA agreed in 2005 to a stricter policy that would include 50-game, 100-game, and lifetime suspensions.

<text>PizzaExpress (Restaurants) Limited, trading as PizzaExpress and or Pizza Marzano and Milano in Ireland, is a British multinational pizza restaurant chain. It has over 500 restaurants across the United Kingdom and 100 overseas in Europe, Hong Kong, Canada, China, India, Indonesia, Kuwait, the Philippines, the United Arab Emirates, Singapore and Saudi Arabia. Pizza Express was founded in London in 1965 by Peter Boizot. In July 2020, it was taken over by its bondholders under a debt-for-equity swap with the previous owner, Hony Capital. In November, Hony Capital left the business and the group restructure was completed, helping to cut the chain&#x27;s debt by more than £400 million.

==History==

Peter Boizot opened the first Pizza Express restaurant in Wardour Street, London, in 1965. Inspired by a trip to Italy, Boizot brought back to London a pizza oven from Naples and a chef from Sicily. In 1969, jazz performances began at its Dean Street restaurant, London.

PizzaExpress expanded into Ireland in 1995 and currently operates 14 restaurants there under the brand name &quot;Milano&quot;. Additionally, the company owns the brand name &quot;Marzano&quot;. Originally, &quot;Marzano&quot; or &quot;Pizza Marzano&quot; was used in countries where the brand name Pizza Express was not available, as with the use of the name &quot;Milano&quot; in Ireland, but it also exists in some territories, such as Cyprus, to differentiate between the restaurants selling primarily pizza and those offering a wider range of non-pizza meals inspired by Italian cuisine. It is also used for a cafe-bar run as an adjunct to the branch of Pizza Express in The Forum in Norwich, &quot;Cafe Bar Marzano&quot;.

In 2011, PizzaExpress launched a major rebrand of its UK restaurants, with menu changes, a black and white logo and the widespread use of stripes, both for staff uniforms and for restaurant decor.

In July 2014, the group was sold to the China-based private equity firm Hony Capital in a deal worth £900 million. In 2017, PizzaExpress launched &#x27;PizzaExpress Live&#x27;.

In October 2019, PizzaExpress hired financial advisors in preparation for its talks with creditors. The chain had been experiencing financial difficulties arising from a downturn in consumer demand for eating out.

In March 2020, all UK restaurants were forced to close indefinitely due to nationwide lockdown rules introduced by the government to limit the spread of COVID-19. On 28 May 2020, select London restaurants reopened for delivery services as the government began to lift lockdown restrictions. In July, it was announced that &quot;dozens&quot; of the closed restaurants would not be reopening. The restaurant group was reported to have a debt pile of £1.1 billion. The next month, it was announced that the company was set to close around 67 restaurants throughout the UK and also cut 1,100 jobs.

In July 2020, the business was taken over by its bondholders under a debt-for-equity swap with previous owner Hony Capital. It was confirmed in September that 73 of its restaurants would close permanently, including the first ever branch in Wardour Street. In November 2020, the group restructure completed and helped cut the casual dining chain&#x27;s debt by more than £400 million. A further 23 branches were earmarked for closure in January 2021.

==Ownership==

Privately owned since its foundation in 1965 for 28 years, PizzaExpress was acquired from Peter Boizot and Ronald Simson by Luke Johnson, David Page and Hugh Osmond in 1993, with Johnson and Osmond becoming non-executive directors. The company was floated on the London Stock Exchange at the same time in 1993. The two major individual shareholders were Peter Boizot and David Page. Wholly owned restaurants then opened rapidly across the UK. The company owned restaurants grew from 23 in number at flotation to over 300 in 2003. Peter Boizot remained as chairman for the first 3 years of the public company. 

The 32 UK franchisees were then bought back en masse in 1996. 

TDR Capital and Capricorn Associates then bought the company in 2003 turning it private again. In 2005, PizzaExpress re-floated on the London Stock Exchange, as part of Gondola Holdings. It was then bought by private equity group Cinven as the Gondola Group in 2007. On 12 July 2014 it was announced that Chinese group Hony Capital had bought PizzaExpress for £900 million.

In July 2020, the business was taken over by its bondholders under a debt-for-equity swap with previous owner Hony Capital. In November 2020, Hony Capital left the business and the group restructure completed, help cutting the casual dining chain&#x27;s debt by more than £400 million.

==Fare==
Since its foundation, PizzaExpress has specialised primarily in handmade pizza in the traditional Italian style.

PizzaExpress introduced the lighter pizza Leggera, the first pizza range on the high street that contains around 500 calories.

In 2008, PizzaExpress started a Guest Chef Series with chef Theo Randall, of Theo Randall at InterContinental London, creating exclusive dishes for its menu. Francesco Mazzei, of L&#x27;Anima, came on board in 2010 to develop a menu inspired by the cuisine of Calabria.

The celebrity chef series continued in 2012 with the introduction of two pizzas made by television cook Valentine Warner. Warner introduced the fennel and salami pizza and the puttanesca pizza.

==Music==

PizzaExpress has supported the jazz community from its early days when it opened its first jazz club in 1969 in Dean Street, London. Since then, artists performing there have included Ella Fitzgerald and Amy Winehouse, to supporting early performances by Norah Jones and Jamie Cullum.

==Za==
Za is a brand of PizzaExpress offering a more casual version of the pizzeria in the United Kingdom.
The first restaurant was launched at the Fenchurch Street site in February 2019. The opening of Za is part of a five-year plan to refresh and improve the brand, called Future Express. 
The menu is centered on PizzaExpress pizzas, sold by the slice, but also with the same toppings available in a wrap made from PizzaExpress dough. The brand focuses on breakfast, with flat breads, bacon, eggs or spinach. Piadina and salads form part of the lunch menu and the site is fully licensed.
The Fenchurch Street test location closed in December 2019, but PizzaExpress have committed to bringing Za back in a different location as of 2022.

Za no longer operates as a brand as of 2023.

==Design and art==
Peter Boizot commissioned Italian restaurant designer and cartoonist Enzo Apicella in the 1960s to design the PizzaExpress identity and over 80 restaurants.

In 2002, PizzaExpress launched PizzaExpress Prospects Contemporary Art Prize with pop artist Peter Blake. Peter Blake&#x27;s connection with PizzaExpress was extended when he donated 26 original pieces to the Chiswick restaurant where he had been a regular customer since 1981.

PizzaExpress created a &#x27;Living Lab&#x27; in October 2010, in Richmond, trialling new ideas from design to sound, collaborating with designer Ab Rogers.

==Philanthropy==
PizzaExpress introduced the Pizza Veneziana in 1977 to help save Venice from sinking by donating 5p of every pizza sold to the Venice in Peril Fund. Over the years the amount donated from each pizza has increased to 25p. From 2008, donations from the Veneziana pizza go to the Veneziana Fund, where 50% is donated to the Venice in Peril Fund and 50% is given to the restoration, repair and maintenance of buildings, fixtures and fittings of buildings and works of art created before 1750.

In 1999, PizzaExpress introduced its Schools Programme, a programme where the company turns its restaurants into classrooms, educating children about fresh ingredients, how to run a local business and how to cook for themselves.

In 2016, PizzaExpress launched its partnership with Macmillan Cancer Support, with a discretionary 25p donation from every Padana pizza sold to help Macmillan provide essential financial, emotional, medical and practical support for people affected by cancer. As of May 2017, the partnership has raised over £500,000.

==Controversy==

In 2008, the company was reported as taking an 8% cut of tips paid via credit card.

<text>True Colors is a 1991 American political drama film directed by Herbert Ross, written by Kevin Wade, and starring John Cusack, James Spader, Imogen Stubbs, Mandy Patinkin, and (in one of his final film roles) Richard Widmark.

==Plot==
In 1990, Peter Burton and best friend Tim Garrity nervously await the results of Peter&#x27;s congressional election, with Tim narrating about how this came to be. The two had met seven years earlier following an argument in the parking lot at University of Virginia School of Law. After discovering that they are to be roommates, the men become close friends. Tim, who comes from an affluent family, plans a career with the Department of Justice, a fact that doesn&#x27;t sit well with his girlfriend, Diana, the daughter of Senator Stiles. Diana effectively ends the relationship before Tim has a chance to propose. Peter, who is embarrassed by his lower-class roots, plans a career in politics, eventually manipulating his way into a job on a congressman&#x27;s campaign staff.

The friendship between them is severely tested when Peter confesses to Tim during a ski vacation that he and Diana have been carrying on an affair. He adds that he plans to ask Diana to marry him. Tim, angry at the betrayal, speeds off down a hazardous ski trail. The less experienced Peter follows him down with far less grace than Tim. There&#x27;s a steep cliff at the end. Tim hesitates to warn Peter, but finally does so. Unfortunately, Peter doesn&#x27;t hear Tim&#x27;s belated warnings in time, hurtles down to the bottom breaking his leg and cracking two ribs. Tim forgives Peter and even agrees to be the best man at Peter and Diana&#x27;s wedding.

Shortly after marrying Diana, Peter falls under the influence of John Palmieri, who has ties to organized crime and political corruption. He finances Peter&#x27;s campaign to gain corrupt influence. Meanwhile, things have begun to spiral out of control in Peter&#x27;s extended family. Earlier in the film, Stiles is diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, something that will end his political career. Peter seizes the opportunity to manipulate his father-in-law into supporting his run for Congress. When the older man refuses, Peter threatens to leak news of the illness to the press. The senator reluctantly acquiesces, but promises Peter that he will eventually get caught.

Tim, who by this time has risen through the ranks of the Department of Justice, launches an investigation into political corruption that will eventually lead back to Palmieri. When Palmieri discovers Peter&#x27;s ties to Tim, he bullies Peter into setting Tim up by putting him in touch with a bogus tipster. Tim reveals the investigation to a reporter, creating public embarrassment for the DOJ and enabling Palmieri&#x27;s corrupt plan. Tim is suspended, and Peter hires him to work for him on his upcoming campaign, believing he left the DOJ. Stiles reveals the conversation that he had with Peter to Diana and she decides to divorce Peter. Shortly thereafter, Tim discovers Peter&#x27;s role in getting him suspended from his job but he denies it to keep Peter&#x27;s trust. Diana reveals she has filed for divorce. Tim volunteers to help the DOJ work to bring Peter down.

Tim works diligently to gather evidence of Peter&#x27;s dealings with Palmieri. He convinces his DOJ superiors to set up surveillance in a hotel room. After Peter wins the election, he and Tim adjourn to the hotel room. Tim tries to get Peter to admit details of his shady dealings with Palmieri. Peter becomes suspicious and Tim comes clean about his role. He also tells Peter that Palmieri is being arraigned at that very moment. Peter viciously attacks Tim. When the fighting subsides and the two calm down, Tim tells Peter he has brought ruin upon himself but Peter says it was all necessary to achieve his goals.

After Peter gives his victory speech, he is arrested and charged with political corruption. The movie ends a few months later when Peter drops by Tim&#x27;s apartment to drop off a case of champagne, fulfilling the bet made at the New Year&#x27;s Eve party years before. Peter reveals that he will not be sworn into office, and that he has been offered immunity in exchange for testimony against Palmieri. Tim then tells Peter that he will be forced to testify against him if he does not accept the plea deal. The two have a reconciliation of sorts and go their separate ways, with Peter maintaining that his political career may not be completely ruined.

Itosu was born in 1831 and died in 1915. A low-rank Ryūkyūan Pechin, Itosu was small in stature, shy, and introverted as a child. He was raised in a strict home of the &quot;keimochi&quot; (a family of position), and was educated in the Chinese classics and calligraphy. Itosu began his tode (karate) study under Nagahama Chikudun Pechin. His study of the art led him to Sokon Matsumura. Part of Itosu&#x27;s training was makiwara practice. He once tied a leather sandal to a stone wall in an effort to build a better makiwara. After several strikes, the stone fell from the wall. After relocating the sandal several times, Itosu had destroyed the wall.

Itosu served as a secretary to the last king of the Ryūkyū Kingdom until Japan abolished the Okinawa-based native monarchy in 1879. In 1901, he was instrumental in getting karate introduced into Okinawa&#x27;s schools. In 1905, Itosu was a part-time teacher of To-te at Okinawa&#x27;s First Junior Prefectural High School. It was here that he developed the systematic method of teaching karate techniques that are still in practice today. He created and introduced the Pinan forms (&quot;Heian&quot; in Japanese) as learning steps for students, because he felt the older forms (&quot;kata&quot; in Japanese) were too difficult for schoolchildren to learn. The five Pinan forms were (allegedly) created by drawing from two older forms: kusanku and chiang nan. In Okinawa, it is said Itosu always walked in the Naihanchi stance. According to Chibana Chosin, Itosu may also have expanded on the existing Naihanchi forms (&quot;Tekki&quot; in Japan) to create the third form, which would become Naihanchi Sandan. In 1908, Itosu wrote the influential &quot;Ten Precepts (&quot;Tode Jukun&quot;) of Karate,&quot; reaching beyond Okinawa to Japan. Itosu&#x27;s style of karate, Shorin-ryu, came to be known as Itosu-ryu in recognition of his skill, mastery, and role as teacher to many.

While Itosu did not invent karate himself, he modified the &quot;kata&quot; (forms) he learned from his master, Matsumura Sōkon, and taught many karate masters. Itosu&#x27;s students included Choyu Motobu (1857–1927), Choki Motobu (1870–1944), Kentsu Yabu (1866–1937), Chomo Hanashiro (1869–1945), Gichin Funakoshi (1868–1957), Moden Yabiku (1880–1941), Kanken Toyama (1888–1966), Shinpan Shiroma (Gusukuma) (1890–1954), Anbun Tokuda (1886–1945), Kenwa Mabuni (1889–1952), and Chōshin Chibana (1885–1969).

== Ten Precepts (&quot;Tode Jukun&quot;) of Karate ==
In October 1908, Itosu wrote a letter, &quot;Ten Precepts (&quot;Tode Jukun&quot;) of Karate,&quot; to draw the attention of the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of War in Japan. A translation of that letter reads:

:Ten Precepts of Karate
:Karate did not develop from Buddhism or Confucianism. In the past the Shorin-ryu school and the Shorei-ryu school were brought to Okinawa from China. Both of these schools have strong points, which I will now mention before there are too many changes:
# Karate is not merely practiced for your own benefit; it can be used to protect one&#x27;s family or master. It is not intended to be used against a single assailant but instead as a way of avoiding a fight should one be confronted by a villain or ruffian.
# The purpose of karate is to make the muscles and bones hard as rock and to use the hands and legs as spears. If children were to begin training in Tang Te while in elementary school, then they will be well suited for military service. Remember the words attributed to the Duke of Wellington after he defeated Napoleon: &quot;The Battle of Waterloo was won on the playing fields of Eton.&quot;
# Karate cannot be quickly learned. Like a slow moving bull, it eventually travels a thousand miles. If one trains diligently every day, then in three or four years one will come to understand karate. Those who train in this fashion will discover karate.
# In karate, training of the hands and feet is important, so one must be thoroughly trained on the makiwara. In order to do this, drop your shoulders, open your lungs, take hold of your strength, grip the floor with your feet, and sink your energy into your lower abdomen. Practice using each arm one to two hundred times each day.
# When one practices the stances of Tang Te, be sure to keep your back straight, lower your shoulders, put strength in your legs, stand firmly, and drop your energy into your lower abdomen.
# Practice each of the techniques of karate repeatedly, the use of which is passed by word of mouth. Learn the explanations well, and decide when and in what manner to apply them when needed. In karate, there are techniques for striking an opponent, as well as for receiving and deflecting an opponent&#x27;s attack. In addition, there is a secret technique called &quot;torite&quot; (&quot;tuitī&quot; in Okinawan dialect), which is a rule passed down orally.
# You must decide if karate is for your health or to aid your duty.
# When you train, do so as if on the battlefield. Your eyes should glare, shoulders drop, and body harden. You should always train with intensity and spirit, and in this way you will naturally be ready.
# One must not overtrain; this will cause you to lose the energy in your lower abdomen and will be harmful to your body. Your face and eyes will turn red. Train wisely.
# In the past, masters of karate have enjoyed long lives. Karate aids in developing the bones and muscles. It helps the digestion as well as the circulation. If karate should be introduced beginning in the elementary schools, then we will produce many men each capable of defeating ten assailants. I further believe this can be done by having all students at the Okinawa Teachers&#x27; College practice karate. In this way, after graduation, they can teach at the elementary schools at which they have been taught. I believe this will be a great benefit to our nation and our military. It is my hope you will seriously consider my suggestion.
:Anko Itosu, October 1908

<doc id="787288" wikidata="Q2329613" url="?curid=787288" title="Shiv (weapon)">
<text>A shiv, also chiv, schiv, shivvie or shank, is a handcrafted bladed weapon resembling a knife that is commonly associated with prison inmates. 

Since weapons are prohibited in prisons, the intended mode of concealment is central to a shiv&#x27;s construction. An especially thin handle, for instance, makes it easier to conceal in available cracks or crevices in the prison&#x27;s construction, or in stacks of objects, such as books, permitted to the prisoners; however, this can also render the shiv difficult to grip and wield. Routine body searches in prison make it difficult to conceal a shiv on one&#x27;s person on a continuous basis. As well as the prison authorities, it is also desirable to conceal possession of a shiv from members of rival prison populations. 

The word is recorded from the 1670s in the spelling &quot;chive&quot; as cant for &quot;knife&quot;, whose pronunciation is reflected in the spelling &quot;shiv&quot; recorded in underworld slang from 1915 and possibly used since the 1890s or earlier. The cant word probably came from the Romani word &quot;chiv&quot; for &quot;blade&quot; (compare Romani &quot;chivomengro&quot; &quot;knifeman&quot;). The derived verb shiv means &quot;to stab someone&quot;, and a shivver is an archaic term for a criminal who attacks victims with a knife.

==Usage==
The word is prison slang for an improvised knife. The word generally applies to both stabbing and edged weapons. A shiv can be anything from a glass shard with fabric wrapped around one end to form a handle, to a razor blade stuck in the end of a toothbrush, to a simple toothbrush handle, filed to a sharp point.

In the 1950s, British criminal Billy Hill described his use of the shiv: 

In the Federal Bureau of Prisons, weapons, sharpened instruments, and knives are considered contraband and their possession is punishable as a highest severity-level prohibited act.

<text>Lauren Helen Graham (born March 16, 1967) is an American actress and author. She is best known for portraying Lorelai Gilmore on The WB series &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot;, for which she was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Television Series Drama, and for playing Sarah Braverman on the NBC drama series &quot;Parenthood&quot; (2010–2015). She also appeared in the films &quot;Sweet November&quot; (2001), &quot;Bad Santa&quot; (2003), &quot;The Pacifier&quot; (2005), &quot;Because I Said So&quot; (2007), &quot;Evan Almighty&quot; (2007), and &quot;Max&quot; (2015). In 2013, Graham published her debut novel with Ballantine Books, &quot;Someday, Someday, Maybe&quot;. In 2016, Graham reprised her role on a &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; Netflix revival miniseries &quot;A Year in the Life&quot; and published a memoir, &quot;Talking as Fast as I Can&quot;.

==Early life==
Graham was born in Honolulu, Hawaii. Her mother, Donna Grant, was a fashion buyer, and her father, Lawrence Graham, a candy industry lobbyist who was president of the National Confectioners Association. Graham was raised in her father&#x27;s Catholic faith (her maternal grandfather was a Baptist minister); she is of Irish descent. When Graham&#x27;s father worked for the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) in Vietnam, Graham lived for a few years in Japan (her mother also grew up there, as the daughter of a missionary).

Graham was five years old when her parents divorced, and she moved to the Virginia suburbs of the Washington, DC metropolitan area with her father, who became a congressional staffer. Her mother left to pursue a music career and lived in London until her death in 2005, at the age of 61. Graham was raised by her father, and they had a close relationship. She said, &quot;I thought I kind of had it best. My dad has a very mellow way about him and I was a self-starter as a kid. I liked a certain amount of being on my own. It just worked great for me.&quot; Graham also spent a few of her childhood years in Southampton, New York. Graham has a half-sister and a half-brother from her father&#x27;s second marriage. Her British half-sister from her mother&#x27;s second marriage, Shade Grant, works at a talent agency.

As a girl, Graham rode horses competitively, but soon switched to acting, honing her talent at Langley High School, where she took part in the drill team and graduated in 1984. She earned her actor&#x27;s Equity Card in 1988 after two years in summer stock at the Barn Theatre in Augusta, Michigan. Graham went to New York University, then transferred to Barnard College. She graduated from Barnard in 1988 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in English literature. After moving to Texas in 1992, Graham earned a Master of Fine Arts degree in Acting Performance from Southern Methodist University.

==Acting career==

===1994–99: Beginnings===
After completing her education, Graham moved back to New York City where she worked as a waitress and as a tutor teaching SAT test prep for The Princeton Review. While she aspired to become an actress, she made publicity appearances wearing the costume of Striker, the dog mascot of the US-based 1994 FIFA World Cup. In 1995, she relocated to Hollywood. She appeared in various commercials for products such as Cascade dishwasher detergent, Dimetapp, AT&amp;T and Lean Cuisine and hosted free preview weekends on The Movie Channel.

Between 1996 and 1997, Graham became a regular guest star on several NBC shows. She played a graduate student who caught the eye of Dick on &quot;3rd Rock from the Sun&quot;; Richard&#x27;s overly optimistic girlfriend on &quot;Caroline in the City&quot;; and Jerry&#x27;s speed-dial ranking girlfriend on &quot;Seinfeld&quot;. She played a Hollywood producer who had a love interest in Detective Rey Curtis in a three-part episode of &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;, where she acted opposite Scott Cohen, who later played one of Graham&#x27;s love interests (Max Medina) on &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot;. She also portrayed an antagonizing but friendship-starved efficiency expert on &quot;NewsRadio&quot;.

In addition to her many guest starring and co-starring roles on prime-time television, Graham starred in four failed sitcoms, &quot;Townies&quot; (with Molly Ringwald and Jenna Elfman); &quot;Good Company&quot;; &quot;Conrad Bloom&quot;; and &quot;M.Y.O.B.&quot;, which was burned off by NBC in the summer before the premiere of &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot;.

===2000–08: &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; and film roles===

In 2000, Graham landed her breakthrough role on &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; as Lorelai Gilmore—a witty &quot;thirty-something&quot; raising her teenage daughter in small-town Connecticut. Graham said she felt &quot;really connected to the material&quot; and the script for the series resonated with her due to its complexities: &quot;To me, this was one of the first times that I looked at something and I was like, &#x27;It&#x27;s serious and it&#x27;s funny! It&#x27;s deep and it&#x27;s light,&#x27; especially then, I had never seen before.&quot; For her work she received a nomination for Best Actress in a Television Series (Drama) at the 2002 Golden Globe Awards and nominations at the 2001 and 2002 SAG Awards. 

Beginning with Season 7 episode &quot;To Whom It May Concern&quot; and continuing throughout the rest of the season, Graham served as a producer on &quot;Gilmore Girls.&quot; &quot;TV Guide&quot; reported that she received the position in an attempt to persuade her to sign for an eighth season. By the series&#x27; end, Graham wanted to move on. &quot;I didn&#x27;t feel we had anything without our creators,&quot; she said.

Graham returned to her guest-starring roots when she portrayed herself in two episodes of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip&quot;. She also appeared in the second season of Bravo&#x27;s &quot;Celebrity Poker Showdown,&quot; co-hosted by Dave Foley of &quot;Newsradio&quot;. After winning her preliminary match, she came in second to another former &quot;Newsradio&quot; star, Maura Tierney, in the championship game.

Graham&#x27;s film roles encompass several NYU student films and multiple major studio releases, including &quot;Sweet November&quot;, &quot;Bad Santa&quot;, &quot;The Pacifier&quot;, &quot;Because I Said So&quot;, and &quot;Evan Almighty&quot;.

Graham has said that she enjoys playing in short films, and acting in the Williamstown Theatre Festival. She has performed in numerous short films, including the 15-minute-long &quot;Gnome&quot;. In 2007, Graham signed a seven-figure development deal with NBC in one of the year&#x27;s richest TV talent pacts. Graham also worked as the voice-over announcer in national advertising for Kellogg&#x27;s various Special K products in 2007, and for American Express ads in 2008 introducing the Plum Card, which targets small and growing businesses.

===2009–2016: Broadway debut, &quot;Parenthood&quot; and &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; reunion===
Graham made her Broadway debut as Miss Adelaide in the revival of &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot;, which began preview performances at the Nederlander Theatre on February 5, 2009, and opened on March 1, 2009. Reviews of the production were mixed. The production closed June 14, playing 121 shows and 28 previews.

It was announced in January 2009 that Graham would star in the comedy pilot &quot;The Bridget Show&quot; (previously &quot;Let It Go&quot;) for ABC playing a talk show host and self-help guru who fails to follow her own advice during a breakup. The pilot was not given a series order. In September 2009, Graham voiced the character Fran Lockwood, Flint&#x27;s late mother, in the Sony Pictures Animation film &quot;Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs&quot;. In October 2009, it was announced that Graham would replace Maura Tierney in the television series &quot;Parenthood&quot; as single mother Sarah Braverman. Tierney left the show to seek treatment for cancer. The series debuted on NBC the following year, and ran for a total of six seasons.

In June 2010, it was confirmed that Graham would star in &quot;Scream 4&quot;, but she left the project on June 30, 2010. In July 2012, Graham was a guest judge in the first episode of Season 10 of the reality television series &quot;Project Runway&quot;.

In 2015, Graham appeared in the adventure drama film &quot;Max&quot;, playing the mother of an American marine killed in Afghanistan who subsequently adopts his Malinois dog. She said she based her character on her grandparents who had different types of strength, and that she felt connected to the film due to many in the film&#x27;s choir having come from a church her grandfather attended. Ignatiy Vishnevetsky and Joe Neumaier felt her role was too limited. The year also saw Graham beginning to appear recurrently in &quot;The Odd Couple&quot;, playing Gaby, the former wife of the series&#x27; main protagonist Oscar, and appear in an episode of the hidden camera comedy &quot;Repeat After Me&quot;.

Graham&#x27;s first film in 2016 was the comedy drama &quot;Joshy&quot;. Jesse Hassenger and Michael Arbeiter noted her small role in the film. In October 2016, Graham appeared in &quot;Middle School: The Worst Years of My Life&quot;, playing the mother of Griffin Gluck&#x27;s character. As a result of her own distaste for parts of her youth, Graham related to the title, sparking her initial interest in participating. That year she also reprised her role as Lorelai Gilmore on Netflix&#x27;s reunion series, &quot;Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life&quot;. Graham said she first realized &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; was still the subject of active interest when girls too young to have watched the series when it initially aired approached her during her Broadway debut &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot;, and admitted to crying while reading the script as she believed &quot;it was just beautiful and fitting and what I wanted it to be and hoped for.&quot; She said the project had more support from the beginning than any other she had been involved with, and she continuously teared up out of appreciation for those working on the series and being able to reprise her role.

=== 2017–present: Later career ===
In October 2017, Graham appeared in three episodes of HBO&#x27;s acclaimed comedy &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot;, which returned after a six-year hiatus. She also voices the character Oxana Hauntley in the Disney Junior animated series &quot;Vampirina&quot;.

From 2020 to 2021, Graham was a featured actress on the NBC show &quot;Zoey&#x27;s Extraordinary Playlist&quot;. She played Zoey&#x27;s (Jane Levy) boss, Joan. From 2021 to 2022, Graham starred as Alex Morrow in &quot;The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers&quot;, a Disney+ television series based on the 1992 film.

In 2024, Graham and Aisling Franciosi were cast opposite Dylan O&#x27;Brien and James Sweeney in David Permut&#x27;s movie &quot;Twinless&quot;.

==In the media==
Graham has appeared on the cover of numerous magazines, including &quot;Health&quot;, &quot;More&quot;, &quot;Self&quot;, &quot;Seventeen&quot;, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, &quot;Redbook&quot;, &quot;Good Housekeeping&quot;, &quot;Ladies&#x27; Home Journal&quot;, and &quot;Parade.&quot;

== Writing ==
Graham&#x27;s debut novel, &quot;Someday, Someday, Maybe&quot; was released by Ballantine Books (of Random House) on April 30, 2013. The comedic novel is a fictionalization of her experiences trying to become an actress in 1990s New York. In May 2013, the book entered the New York Times best seller list. Graham signed a deal with Warner Bros. Television and Ellen DeGeneres&#x27;s production company A Very Good Production to adapt it into a TV series. Graham wrote the screenplay for a pilot episode but it was not picked up for filming.

In November 2016, Graham&#x27;s second book was published: a collection of personal essays titled &quot;Talking as Fast as I Can: from Gilmore Girls to Gilmore Girls (and Everything in Between)&quot;. It was also a &quot;New York Times&quot; best seller. In November 2022, Graham published a second book of personal essays, &quot;Have I Told You This Already?: Stories I Don&#x27;t Want to Forget to Remember&quot;.

Graham has adapted the novel &quot;The Royal We&quot; into a screenplay for CBS Films; she finished the script in mid-2017. She has optioned the movie rights for the novel, &quot;Windfall,&quot; by Jennifer E. Smith. Graham&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Worry About It&quot; focuses on &quot;advice for graduates and reflections on staying true to yourself&quot; and was her third &quot;New York Times&quot; best seller.

== Personal life ==
Graham was in a relationship with actor Peter Krause from 2010 to 2021. They first met in 1995 when they both appeared in the sitcom &quot;Caroline in the City&quot;, then became a couple while co-starring on &quot;Parenthood&quot;. In June 2022, it was reported that the couple had ended their relationship after 11 years together.

In the mid-1990s, Graham was roommates with actress Connie Britton.

Graham owns a house in Los Angeles.

Graham told &quot;More&quot; that she identified with Catholicism and attends church occasionally.

<doc id="787308" wikidata="Q3099573" url="?curid=787308" title="Thomas Schlamme">
<text>Thomas David Schlamme (; born ) is an American television director, known particularly for his collaborations with Aaron Sorkin. He is known for his work as executive producer on &quot;The West Wing&quot; and &quot;Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip,&quot; as well as his work as director on &quot;Sports Night&quot; and &quot;The Americans&quot;.

==Early life==
Schlamme was born in Houston, Texas. He is Jewish, and his family escaped Nazi Germany the week before the &quot;Kristallnacht&quot;. He attended Bellaire High School in Bellaire, Texas.

==Production==
Schlamme moved from his native Houston to New York City in 1973. After serving in several low level positions for production companies, he founded his own company, Schlamme Productions, in 1980. From there, he produced campaigns for a number of musicals, including &quot;Cats&quot;. He directed the first &quot;I Want My MTV!&quot; advertising campaign in 1981 for producer Buzz Potamkin, and singer/songwriter Amy Grant&#x27;s 1985 music video &quot;Find a Way&quot; for producers Fred Seibert and Alan Goodman. Throughout the 1980s, he produced a number of specials on various entertainers including Whoopi Goldberg and Rowan Atkinson.

Starting in the late 1990s, Schlamme served as producer for shows such as &quot;Tracey Takes On...&quot; and has directed shows such as &quot;Ally McBeal&quot;, &quot;Boston Public&quot;, &quot;Friends&quot;, &quot;ER&quot; and, &quot;Invasion&quot;. He is an executive producer of the American crime drama television series &quot;Snowfall&quot; which premiered on FX in July 2017. His production company is Shoe Money Productions.

==Director==

Schlamme made his feature film directing debut with &quot;Miss Firecracker&quot; in 1989, and later directed the 1993 comedy film &quot;So I Married an Axe Murderer&quot;, starring Mike Myers. He had previously directed the filming of Spalding Gray&#x27;s monologue Terrors of Pleasure in 1987. In 1991, Schlamme directed all six episodes of Billy Crystal&#x27;s HBO comedy miniseries &quot;Sessions&quot;, starring Michael McKean and Elliott Gould. Schlamme also directed the pilot episodes of &quot;Spin City&quot; and &quot;What&#x27;s Alan Watching?&quot;

He worked on the TV series &quot;Parenthood&quot; for NBC and &quot;Pan Am&quot; for ABC. Schlamme has also directed multiple episodes of the 2014 series &quot;Manhattan&quot;.

In 2017, he was elected president of the Directors Guild of America.

===Work with Aaron Sorkin===
Schlamme&#x27;s nearly decade-long collaboration in television with writer-producer Aaron Sorkin began in early 1998 when they found they shared common creative ground on the soon to be produced &quot;Sports Night&quot;. Their successful partnership in television was one in which Sorkin focused on writing the scripts while Schlamme executive produced and occasionally directed; they worked together on &quot;Sports Night&quot;, &quot;The West Wing&quot;, and &quot;Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip&quot;. Schlamme would create the look of the shows, work with the other directors, discuss the scripts with Sorkin as soon as they were turned in, make design and casting decisions, and attend the budget meetings; Sorkin tended to stick strictly to writing.

Schlamme first worked with Aaron Sorkin on his short-lived ABC comedy/drama &quot;Sports Night&quot;, for which he directed 16 of its 45 episodes. Their biggest break was in 1999, teaming up again on their hit political drama &quot;The West Wing&quot;. He directed the pilot episode and from then on served as the executive producer until 2003. In addition to serving as executive producer, he directed 14 episodes of &quot;The West Wing&quot;, including the second season finale, &quot;Two Cathedrals&quot;, now widely considered one of the greatest tv episodes ever made. In 2003, at the end of the fourth season, Schlamme and Sorkin left the show due to internal conflicts at Warner Bros. TV not involving the NBC network, thrusting producer John Wells into an expanded role as showrunner.

In early October 2005, a pilot script dubbed &quot;Studio 7 on the Sunset Strip&quot; for a new TV series, written by Sorkin and with Schlamme attached as producer, started circulating around Hollywood and generating interest on the web. A week later, NBC bought from Warner Bros. TV the right to show the TV series on their network for a near-record license fee in a bidding war with CBS. The show&#x27;s name was later changed to &quot;Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip&quot;.

In September 2006, the pilot for &quot;Studio 60&quot; aired on NBC, directed by Schlamme. The pilot was critically acclaimed and had high ratings, but &quot;Studio 60&quot; experienced a significant drop in audience by mid-season. The show was cancelled after one season.

===&quot;Walk and talk&quot;===
Schlamme&#x27;s direction is characterized by use of a technique called the &quot;walk and talk&quot;: sequences consisting of single lengthy tracking shots involving multiple characters engaging in conversation as they move through the set. Characters enter and exit the conversation as the shot continues without any cuts.

==Personal life==

Schlamme resides in Los Angeles with his wife of 40 years, actress and filmmaker Christine Lahti. They have three children. He is the step-brother of attorney Solomon Wisenberg, who was Ken Starr&#x27;s deputy during the impeachment of Bill Clinton and he questioned the President during the grand jury interview. He is the uncle of producer Dylan K. Massin, who produced 43 episodes of &quot;The West Wing&quot;, as well as &quot;Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life&quot; and other television series.

<doc id="787320" wikidata="Q3774237" url="?curid=787320" title="Antiquities Act">
<text>The Antiquities Act of 1906 (, , ) is an act that was passed by the United States Congress and signed into law by Theodore Roosevelt on June 8, 1906. This law gives the president of the United States the authority to, by presidential proclamation, create national monuments from federal lands to protect significant natural, historic, or scientific features. The Act has been used more than a hundred times since its enactment to create a wide variety of protected areas.

==History==
The Antiquities Act was signed into law by President Theodore Roosevelt during his second term in office. The act resulted from concerns about protecting mostly prehistoric Native American ruins and artifacts—collectively termed &quot;antiquities&quot;—on federal lands in the West, such as at Chaco Canyon, New Mexico. Removal of artifacts from these lands by private collectors, &quot;pot hunters,&quot; had become a serious problem by the end of the 19th century. In 1902, Iowa Congressman John F. Lacey, who chaired the House Committee on the Public Lands, traveled to the Southwest with the rising anthropologist Edgar Lee Hewett, to see for himself the extent of the pot hunters&#x27; impact. His findings, supported by an exhaustive report by Hewett to Congress detailing the archaeological resources of the region, provided the necessary impetus for the passage of the legislation.

The Act failed to deter purposeful, criminal looting at these protected sites and was deemed too vague, eventually resulting in passage of the Archaeological Resources Protection Act of 1979. The Antiquities Act has been praised by several groups for its ability to protect important sites, including The Wilderness Society, the National Parks Conservation Association, The Pew Charitable Trusts, and the National Trust for Historic Preservation.

Since the Antiquities Act became law, all but three presidents, Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, and George H.W. Bush, have chosen to enlarge or dedicate new national monuments. President Obama established more monuments than any president, with 29 in total. The previous record was held by President Clinton with 19 monuments. President Carter dedicated the most acreage to national monuments, mostly in areas in Alaska.

On April 26, 2017, President Donald Trump signed Executive Order 13792 directing a review of the law and its uses.

==Uses==
The Act was intended to allow the president to set aside certain valuable public natural areas as park and conservation land. The 1906 act stated that it was intended for: &quot;... the protection of objects of historic and scientific interest.&quot; These areas are given the title of &quot;national monuments.&quot; It also allows the president to reserve or accept private lands for that purpose. The aim is to protect all historic and prehistoric sites on United States federal lands and to prohibit excavation or destruction of these antiquities. With this act, this can be done much more quickly than going through the Congressional process of creating a national park. The Act states that areas of the monuments are to be confined to the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management of the objects to be protected.

Protection of sites can include restrictions on mining, logging, grazing, commercial fishing, and hunting; known as land withdrawals, these are typically described in the presidential proclamation establishing the monument.

Some areas designated as national monuments have later been converted to or incorporated into national parks or national historical parks. 28 of the 63 national parks include areas originally designated as national monuments.

The first use of the Act protected a large geographic feature: President Theodore Roosevelt proclaimed Devils Tower National Monument on September 24, 1906. President Roosevelt also used it to create the Grand Canyon National Monument (now Grand Canyon National Park) and sixteen other sites.

At , Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument is the largest protected area proclaimed. George W. Bush signed proclamation Proclamation 8031 to establish the monument in 2006, and President Barack Obama expanded its size in 2016.

The smallest, Father Millet Cross National Monument (now part of a state park), was a mere .

For any excavation, the Act requires that a permit (Antiquities Permit) be obtained from the Secretary of the department which has jurisdiction over those lands.

Presidents have historically tended to create more monuments during their second terms or lame duck periods.

==Reduction of powers==
Presidential powers under the Act have been reduced twice. The first time followed the controversial proclamation of Jackson Hole National Monument in 1943. The 1950 law that incorporated Jackson Hole into an enlarged Grand Teton National Park also amended the Antiquities Act, requiring Congressional consent for any future creation or enlargement of national monuments in Wyoming.

The second time followed Jimmy Carter&#x27;s use of the Act to create 17 national monuments in Alaska covering . The Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act rescinded Carter&#x27;s withdrawals while establishing those areas as national parks or other site types and requires Congressional ratification of the use of the Antiquities Act in Alaska for withdrawals of greater than .

The Trump administration conducted a review of 27 major designations to consider changes and Trump subsequently significantly reduced the size of Grand Staircase–Escalante National Monument and Bears Ears National Monument in Utah in 2017. Trump also lifted restrictions on commercial fishing at Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument. The legality of these actions was challenged in federal court, and President Biden restored the original areas and protections in 2021; that restoration was legally challenged. Although some presidents have chosen to ignore the tradition of preservation of notable environmental or historic areas, no president has entirely undone a predecessor&#x27;s monument.

The United States Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld presidential proclamations under the Antiquities Act, ruling each time that the Act gives the president wide discretion as to the nature of the object to be protected and the size of the area reserved. The first such case was a unanimous decision in 1920 that upheld the creation of Grand Canyon National Monument.

<doc id="787323" wikidata="Q315370" url="?curid=787323" title="Celsus">
<text>Celsus (; , &quot;Kélsos&quot;; ) was a 2nd-century Greek Philosopher and opponent of early Christianity. His literary work, &quot;The True Word&quot; (also &quot;Account&quot;, &quot;Doctrine&quot; or &quot;Discourse&quot;; Greek: ), survives exclusively in quotations from it in &quot;Contra Celsum&quot;, a refutation written in 248 by Origen of Alexandria. &quot;The True Word&quot; is the earliest known comprehensive criticism of Christianity and Judaism.

Hanegraaff has argued that &quot;The True Word&quot; was written shortly after the death of Justin Martyr (who was possibly the first Christian apologist), and was probably a response to his work. Origen stated that Celsus was from the first half of the 2nd century AD, although the majority of modern scholars have come to a general consensus that Celsus probably wrote around AD 170 to 180.

== Philosophy ==
All that is known about Celsus himself comes from the surviving text of his book and from what Origen says about him. Although Origen initially refers to Celsus as an Epicurean, his arguments reflect ideas of the Platonic tradition, rather than Epicureanism. Origen attributes this to Celsus&#x27;s inconsistency, but modern historians see it instead as evidence that Celsus was not an Epicurean at all. Joseph Wilson Trigg states that Origen probably confused Celsus, the author of &quot;The True Word&quot;, with a different Celsus, who was an Epicurean philosopher and a friend of the Syrian satirist Lucian. Celsus the Epicurean must have lived around the same time as the author of &quot;The True Word&quot; and he is mentioned by Lucian in his treatise &quot;On Magic&quot;. Both Celsus the friend of Lucian and Celsus the author of &quot;The True Word&quot; evidently shared a passionate zeal against &quot;superstitio&quot;, making it easy to see how Origen could have concluded that they were the same person.

Stephen Thomas states that Celsus may not have been a Platonist &quot;per se&quot;, but that he was clearly familiar with Plato. Celsus&#x27;s actual philosophy appears to be a blend of elements derived from Platonism, Aristotelianism, Pythagoreanism, and Stoicism. Wilken likewise concludes that Celsus was a philosophical eclectic, whose views reflect a variety of ideas popular to a number of different schools. Wilken classifies Celsus as &quot;a conservative intellectual&quot;, noting that &quot;he supports traditional values and defends accepted beliefs&quot;. Theologian Robert M. Grant notes that Origen and Celsus actually agree on many points: &quot;Both are opposed to anthropomorphism, to idolatry, and to any crudely literal theology.&quot; Celsus also writes as a loyal citizen of the Roman Empire and a devoted believer in the ancient Greek religion and the religion in ancient Rome, distrustful of Christianity as new and foreign.

Thomas remarks that Celsus &quot;is no genius as a philosopher&quot;. Nonetheless, most scholars, including Thomas, agree that Origen&#x27;s quotations from &quot;The True Word&quot; reveal that the work was well-researched. Celsus demonstrates extensive knowledge of both the Old and New Testaments and of both Jewish and Christian history. Celsus was also closely familiar with the literary features of ancient polemics. Celsus seems to have read at least one work by one of the second-century Christian apologists, possibly Justin Martyr or Aristides of Athens. From this reading, Celsus seems to have known which kinds of arguments Christians would be most vulnerable to. He also mentions the Ophites and Simonians, two Gnostic sects that had almost completely vanished by Origen&#x27;s time. One of Celsus&#x27;s main sources for Books I–II of &quot;The True Word&quot; was an earlier anti-Christian polemic written by an unknown Jewish author, whom Origen refers to as the &quot;Jew of Celsus&quot;. This Jewish source also provides well-researched criticism of Christianity and, although Celsus was also hostile to Judaism, he occasionally relies on this Jewish author&#x27;s arguments, to demonstrate the inconsistency of the Christian position, and he also uses Christian arguments among others to deconstruct the Jewish religion.

==Work==

Celsus was the author of a work titled &quot;The True Word&quot; (&quot;Logos Alēthēs&quot;). The argument was contested by the contemporary Christian community and the book was eventually banned in 448 AD by order of Valentinian III and Theodosius II, along with Porphyry&#x27;s 15 books attacking the Christians, &quot;The Philosophy from Oracles&quot;. No complete copies are extant, but it can be reconstructed from Origen&#x27;s detailed account of it in his eight volume refutation, which quotes Celsus extensively. Origen&#x27;s work has survived and has thereby preserved Celsus&#x27;s work.

Celsus seems to have been interested in Ancient Egyptian religion, and he seemed to know of Hellenistic Jewish logos-theology, both of which suggest &quot;The True Doctrine&quot; was composed in Alexandria. Origen indicates that Celsus was an Epicurean living under the Emperor Hadrian.

Celsus writes that &quot;there is an ancient doctrine [&quot;archaios logos&quot;] which has existed from the beginning, which has always been maintained by the wisest nations and cities and wise men&quot;. He leaves Jews and Moses out of those he cites (Egyptians, Syrians,
Indians, Persians, Odrysians, Samothracians, Eleusinians, Hyperboreans, Galactophagoi, Druids, and Getae), and instead blames Moses for the corruption of the ancient religion. &quot;The goatherds and shepherds who followed Moses as their leader were deluded by clumsy deceits into thinking that there was only one God, [and] without any rational cause ... these goatherds and shepherds abandoned the worship of many gods&quot;. However, Celsus&#x27;s harshest criticism was reserved for Christians, who &quot;wall themselves off and break away from the rest of mankind&quot;.

Celsus initiated a critical attack on Christianity, ridiculing many of its dogmas. He wrote that some Jews said Jesus&#x27;s father was actually a Roman soldier named Pantera. Origen considered this a fabricated story. In addition, Celsus addressed the miracles of Jesus, holding that &quot;Jesus performed his miracles by sorcery ()&quot;:

Origen wrote his refutation in 248. Sometimes quoting, sometimes paraphrasing, sometimes merely referring, Origen reproduces and replies to Celsus&#x27;s arguments. Since accuracy was essential to his refutation of &quot;The True Doctrine&quot;, most scholars agree that Origen is a reliable source for what Celsus wrote.

Biblical scholar Arthur J. Droge has written that it is incorrect to refer to Celsus&#x27;s perspective as polytheism. Instead, he was a henotheist, as opposed to the Jewish strict monotheism; historian Wouter Hanegraaff explains that &quot;the former has room for a hierarchy of lower deities which do not detract from the ultimate unity of the One.&quot; Celsus shows himself familiar with the story of Jewish origins. Conceding that Christians are not without success in business (&quot;infructuosi in negotiis&quot;), Celsus wants them to be good citizens, to retain their own belief but worship the emperors and join their fellow citizens in defending the empire. This appeal on behalf of unity and mutual toleration nevertheless centers on submission to the state and military service. One of Celsus&#x27;s bitterest complaints is that Christians refused to cooperate with civil society and held local customs and the ancient religions in contempt. The Christians viewed these as idolatrous and inspired by evil spirits, whereas polytheists like Celsus thought of them as the works of the Daemons, or the god&#x27;s ministers, who ruled mankind in his place to keep him from the &quot;pollution of mortality&quot;. Celsus attacks the Christians as feeding off faction and disunity, and accuses them of converting the vulgar and ignorant, while refusing to debate wise men. As for their opinions regarding their sacred mission and exclusive holiness, Celsus responds by deriding their insignificance, comparing them to &quot;a swarm of bats, or ants creeping out of their nest, or frogs holding a symposium round a swamp, or worms in conventicle in a corner of the mud&quot;. It is not known how many were Christians at the time of Celsus (the Jewish population of the empire may have been about 6.6–10% in a population of 60 million to quote one reference).

<text>Amalia Dolores García Medina (born October 6, 1951) is a Mexican politician and a former governor of Zacatecas.

== Early life ==
García was born into a political family. When she was five, her father Francisco Garcia Estrada was elected governor of their home state of Zacatecas, representing the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). He held office from 1956 to 1962. Rather than following in his footsteps, García instead enrolled in the outlawed Mexican Communist Party (PCM) after witnessing the student revolts of 1968 and the Tlatelolco massacre. 

== Political career ==
García&#x27;s political stance became more moderate over time, and she played a key role in turning the PCM into a &quot;neo-Communist&quot; party. She followed the PCM into the Unified Socialist Party of Mexico (PSUM) in 1981. After briefly being a member of the Mexican Socialist Party, she became a founding member of the Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD) when it was created in 1989.

From 1999 to 2002, she served as president of the PRD. In 1996, she ran (unsuccessfully) for party president; she ran again, and won, in 2000.

On June 24, 2018, she renounced to PRD, after 29 years of advocacy, arguing &quot;the great debate of ideas that constituted one of its strengths, has been totally replaced by agreements for the distribution of quotas&quot;.

==Governor of Zacatecas==
In 2003, Garcia was selected as the PRD&#x27;s candidate in the 2004 Zacatecas gubernatorial election. On July 4, 2004, she won a convincing victory and was sworn in as the first female governor of Zacatecas on September 12, 2004. She had been endorsed by a former Governor of Zacatecas, José Guadalupe Cervantes Corona, who renounced his membership in PRI to support Garcia.

She was the fifth woman to serve as governor of a Mexican state. Earlier women governors were Griselda Álvarez (Colima, 1979–1985), Beatriz Paredes (Tlaxcala, 1987–1992), Dulce María Sauri (Yucatán, 1991–1994), Rosario Robles Berlanga (Distrito Federal, 1999–2000).
