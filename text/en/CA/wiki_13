<text>Kilinochchi (; ) is the main town of Kilinochchi District, Northern Province of Sri Lanka. Kilinochchi is situated at the A9 road some south-east of Jaffna. It was the administrative center and de facto capital of the LTTE (Tamil Tigers) until 2 January 2009, when troops of the Sri Lankan Army recaptured the city.

==History==

===Creation (1936)===
The Kilinochchi town was established in 1936 as part of a colonization project that sought to ease overpopulation and unemployment in Jaffna.

Kilinochchi is still part of the Jaffna electoral division and it was separated from the Jaffna District in the 1980s as a new district. Most of the people living in this district are farmers and related to agricultural work. Most of the people migrated from Jaffna in the 1930s to acquire government grants for land in the region and to engage in paddy (rice) cultivation. During the 1970s, a large number of immigrants from the hill country, predominantly Indian Tamils, settled in the town. Much of the population immigrated overseas (Europe, US, Canada, Australia, etc.) during the Civil War (1990 onward). The population has begun to rise after the end of the war.

===Sri Lankan Civil War===

The LTTE first took hold of the town in 1990 when the Army withdrew its garrisons from Kilinochchi. Then the area was retaken by the Army during Operation Sathjaya in September 1996. The town again fell into the LTTE&#x27;s hand in September 1998 who held their administrative hub there until retreating during the Battle of Kilinochchi on 2 January 2009.

Several institutions of the LTTE were forced to relocate from Kilinochchi to Tharmapuram, a town about 13 km in the east, by early October, 2008 in fear of death by advancing government troops. Security Forces Headquarters – Kilinochchi was established on June 29, 2009, in the town.

==Demography==
Most people living in Kilinochchi are Sri Lankan Tamils and Indian Tamils.

==Economy==
Kilinochchi is one of the major agrarian cultivation destinations in the island from the pre-historic times. Iranamadu Tank, Kanakampikai Kulam (Pond), and Kilinochchi Kulam are the major irrigation source for paddy and various other cultivations. However, the economy of the town has suffered in recent times due to the economic crisis, which has resulted in a lack of fertilizer and fuel, reducing crop yields.

==Transport==
Kilinochchi is connected to the Sri Lanka Railways Northern Line via its railway station. The A-9 Highway passes through the town, giving it direct connection with the major cities of Jaffna and Kandy.

==Media==
Kilinochchi is served with all Jaffna- and Colombo-based newspapers. The Jaffna-based Uthayan has a regional office in Kilinochchi.

There have been discussions of not distributing Jaffna-based newspapers in the Vanni area, especially Uthayan. Uthayan is highly critical of inappropriate land acquisition in the Jaffna peninsula and the Vanni region by the Sri Lankan Military and Government.

==Education==
This district has one university faculty and several Government Colleges such as Faculty of Agriculture of University of Jaffna, Kilinochchi Central College, Hindu College, Uruthirapuram Maha Vidyalayam school, Vaddakkachchi Maha Vidyalayam school, institution etc.

<doc id="760646" wikidata="Q250452" url="?curid=760646" title="Refusal of work">
<text>Refusal of work is behavior in which a person refuses regular employment.

As actual behavior, with or without a political or philosophical program, it has been practiced by various subcultures and individuals. It is frequently engaged in by those who critique the concept of work, and it has a long history. Radical political positions have openly advocated refusal of work. From within Marxism it has been advocated by Paul Lafargue and the Italian workerist/autonomists (e.g. Antonio Negri, Mario Tronti), the French ultra-left (e.g. Échanges et Mouvement); and within anarchism (especially Bob Black and the post-left anarchy tendency).

== Abolition of unfree labour ==
International human rights law does not recognize the refusal of work or right not to work by itself except the right to strike. However the Abolition of Forced Labour Convention adopted by International Labour Organization in 1957 prohibits all forms of forced labour.

== Concerns over wage slavery ==

Wage slavery refers to a situation where a person&#x27;s livelihood depends on wages, especially when the dependence is total and immediate. It is a negatively connoted term used to draw an analogy between slavery and wage labor, and to highlight similarities between owning and employing a person. The term &#x27;wage slavery&#x27; has been used to criticize economic exploitation and social stratification, with the former seen primarily as unequal bargaining power between labor and capital (particularly when workers are paid comparatively low wages, e.g. in sweatshops), and the latter as a lack of workers&#x27; self-management. The criticism of social stratification covers a wider range of employment choices bound by the pressures of a hierarchical social environment (i.e. working for a wage not only under threat of starvation or poverty, but also of social stigma or status diminution).

Similarities between wage labor and slavery were noted at least as early as Cicero. Before the American Civil War, Southern defenders of African American slavery invoked the concept to favorably compare the condition of their slaves to workers in the North. With the advent of the Industrial Revolution, thinkers such as Proudhon and Marx elaborated the comparison between wage labor and slavery in the context of a critique of property not intended for active personal use.

The introduction of wage labor in 18th century Britain was met with resistance—giving rise to the principles of syndicalism. Historically, some labor organizations and individual social activists, have espoused workers&#x27; self-management or worker cooperatives as possible alternatives to wage labor.

== Political views ==

&quot;The Right to be Lazy&quot;, an essay by Cuban-born French revolutionary Marxist Paul Lafargue, manifests that &quot;When, in our civilized Europe, we would find a trace of the native beauty of man, we must go seek it in the nations where economic prejudices have not yet uprooted the hatred of work ... The Greeks in their era of greatness had only contempt for work: their slaves alone were permitted to labor: the free man knew only exercises for the body and mind ... The philosophers of antiquity taught contempt for work, that degradation of the free man, the poets sang of idleness, that gift from the Gods.&quot; And so he says &quot;Proletarians, brutalized by the dogma of work, listen to the voice of these philosophers, which has been concealed from you with jealous care: A citizen who gives his labor for money degrades himself to the rank of slaves.&quot; (The last sentence paraphrasing Cicero.)

Raoul Vaneigem, theorist of the post-surrealist Situationist International which was influential in the May 68 events in France, wrote &quot;The Book of Pleasures&quot;. In it he says that &quot;You reverse the perspective of power by returning to pleasure the energies stolen by work and constraint ... As sure as work kills pleasure, pleasure kills work. If you are not resigned to dying of disgust, then you will be happy enough to rid your life of the odious need to work, to give orders (and obey them), to lose and to win, to keep up appearances, and to judge and be judged.&quot;

Autonomist philosopher Bifo defines refusal of work as not &quot;so much the obvious fact that workers do not like to be exploited, but something more. It means that the capitalist restructuring, the technological change, and the general transformation of social institutions are produced by the daily action of withdrawal from exploitation, of rejection of the obligation to produce surplus value, and to increase the value of capital, reducing the value of life.&quot; More simply he states &quot;Refusal of work means ... I don&#x27;t want to go to work because I prefer to sleep. But this laziness is the source of intelligence, of technology, of progress. Autonomy is the self-regulation of the social body in its independence and in its interaction with the disciplinary norm.&quot;

As a social development Bifo remembers,that one of the strong ideas of the movement of autonomy proletarians during the 70s was the idea &quot;precariousness is good&quot;. Job precariousness is a form of autonomy from steady regular work, lasting an entire life. In the 1970s many people used to work for a few months, then to go away for a journey, then back to work for a while. This was possible in times of almost full employment and in times of egalitarian culture. This situation allowed people to work in their own interest and not in the interest of capitalists, but quite obviously this could not last forever, and the neoliberal offensive of the 1980s was aimed to reverse the rapport de force.&quot;As a response to these developments his view is that &quot;the dissemination of self-organized knowledge can create a social framework containing infinite autonomous and self-reliant worlds.&quot;

From this possibility of self-determination even the notion of workers&#x27; self-management is seen as problematic since &quot;Far from the emergence of proletarian power, ... this self-management as a moment of the self-harnessing of the workers to capitalist production in the period of real subsumption ... Mistaking the individual capitalist (who, in real subsumption disappears into the collective body of share ownership on one side, and hired management on the other) rather than the enterprise as the problem, ... the workers themselves became a collective capitalist, taking on responsibility for the exploitation of their own labor. Thus, far from breaking with &#x27;work&#x27;, ... the workers maintained the practice of clocking-in, continued to organize themselves and the community around the needs of the factory, paid themselves from profits arising from the sale of watches, maintained determined relations between individual work done and wage, and continued to wear their work shirts throughout the process.&quot;

André Gorz was an Austrian and French social philosopher. Also a journalist, he co-founded &quot;Le Nouvel Observateur&quot; weekly in 1964. A supporter of Jean-Paul Sartre&#x27;s existentialist version of Marxism after World War Two, in the aftermath of the May &#x27;68 student riots, he became more concerned with political ecology. His central theme was wage labour issues such as liberation from work, the just distribution of work, social alienation, and a guaranteed basic income.

=== Anarchism ===

Bob Black&#x27;s 1986 essay &quot;The Abolition of Work&quot; proposes a &quot;life based on play&quot; to replace work. He argues that work degrades workers through discipline and habituation, and equates work to social control and mass murder.

In 2022, &quot;Green Theory &amp; Praxis Journal&quot; published a Total Liberation Pathway which involved &quot;an abolition of compulsory work for all beings.&quot; Building on scholar Jason Hribal&#x27;s description of animals as part of the working class and industries&#x27; labels of &quot;working ecosystems&quot; and &quot;energy slaves,&quot; the proposal sought to free all animals, ecosystems, plants, minerals, and the planet Earth from exploitation. As part of this transformation, humans would drastically reduce their workweek and transform it into voluntary and self-managed hobbies.

== Stigmatization of people who do not work ==
Those who engage in refusal of work break one of the most powerful social norms of contemporary society. Hence they frequently receive harassment from people, sometimes irrespective of whether they made the choice to leave work behind or not. In Nazi Germany the so-called, &quot;work-shy&quot; individuals were rounded up and imprisoned in Nazi concentration camps as black triangle prisoners in the so-called &quot;Aktion Arbeitsscheu Reich&quot;.

=== Other derogatory terms and their history ===
==== Cynic philosophical school ====
Cynicism (), in its original form, refers to the beliefs of an ancient school of Greek philosophers known as the Cynics (, ). Their philosophy was that the purpose of life was to live a life of Virtue in agreement with Nature. This meant rejecting all conventional desires for wealth, power, health, and fame, and by living a simple life free from all possessions. They believed that the world belonged equally to everyone, and that suffering was caused by false judgments of what was valuable and by the worthless customs and conventions which surrounded society.
The first philosopher to outline these themes was Antisthenes, who had been a pupil of Socrates in the late 5th century BCE. He was followed by Diogenes of Sinope, who lived in a tub on the streets of Athens. Diogenes took Cynicism to its logical extremes, and came to be seen as the archetypal Cynic philosopher. He was followed by Crates of Thebes who gave away a large fortune so he could live a life of Cynic poverty in Athens. Cynicism spread with the rise of Imperial Rome in the 1st century, and Cynics could be found begging and preaching throughout the cities of the Empire. It finally disappeared in the late 5th century, although many of its ascetic and rhetorical ideas were adopted by early Christianity. The name Cynic derives from the Greek word κυνικός, &quot;kynikos&quot;, &quot;dog-like&quot; and that from κύων, &quot;kyôn&quot;, &quot;dog&quot; (genitive: &quot;kynos&quot;).

It seems certain that the word &quot;dog&quot; was also thrown at the first Cynics as an insult for their shameless rejection of conventional manners, and their decision to live on the streets. Diogenes, in particular, was referred to as &quot;the Dog&quot;.

==== &quot;Slackers&quot; ====
The term slacker is commonly used to refer to a person who avoids work (especially British English), or (primarily in North American English) an educated person who is viewed as an underachiever.

While use of the term &quot;slacker&quot; dates back to about 1790 or 1898 depending on the source, it gained some recognition during the British Gezira Scheme, when Sudanese labourers protested their relative powerlessness by working lethargically, a form of protest known as &#x27;slacking&#x27;. The term achieved a boost in popularity after its use in the films &quot;Back to the Future&quot; and &quot;Slacker&quot;.

==== NEET ====
NEET is an acronym for the government classification for people currently &quot;Not in Employment, Education or Training&quot;. It was first used in the United Kingdom but its use has spread to other countries, including the United States, Japan, China, and South Korea.

In the United Kingdom, the classification comprises people aged between 16 and 24 (some 16-year-olds are still of compulsory education age). In Japan, the classification comprises people aged between 15 and 34 who are unemployed, unmarried, not enrolled in school or engaged in housework, and not seeking work or the technical training needed for work. The &quot;NEET group&quot; is not a uniform set of individuals but consists of those who will be NEET for a short time while essentially testing out a variety of opportunities and those who have major and often multiple issues and are at long term risk of remaining disengaged.

In Brazil, &quot;nem-nem&quot; (short of &quot;nem estudam nem trabalham&quot; (neither study nor work) is a term with similar meaning.

In Spanish-speaking countries, &quot;ni-ni&quot; (short of &quot;ni estudia ni trabaja&quot;) is also applied.

==== &quot;Freeters&quot; and parasite singles ====
 (other spellings below) is a Japanese expression for people between the age of 15 and 34 who lack full-time employment or are unemployed, excluding homemakers and students. They may also be described as &quot;underemployed&quot; or freelance workers. These people do not start a career after high school or university but instead usually live as so-called parasite singles with their parents and earn some money with low-skilled and low-paid jobs.

The word &quot;freeter&quot; or &quot;freeta&quot; was first used around 1987 or 1988 and is thought to be an amalgamation of the English word &quot;free&quot; (or perhaps &quot;freelance&quot;) and the German word &quot;Arbeiter&quot; (&quot;worker&quot;).

 is a Japanese term for a single person who lives with their parents until their late twenties or early thirties in order to enjoy a carefree and comfortable life. In English, the expression &quot;sponge&quot; or &quot;basement dweller&quot; may sometimes be used.

The expression is mainly used in reference to Japanese society, but similar phenomena can also be found in other countries worldwide. In Italy, 30-something singles still relying on their mothers are joked about, being called &quot;Bamboccioni&quot; (literally: grown-up babies) and in Germany they are known as &quot;Nesthocker&quot; (German for an &quot;altricial&quot; bird), who are still living at &quot;&quot;.

Such behaviour is considered normal in Greece, both because of the traditional strong family ties and because of the low wages.

==== Welfare queens ====
A Welfare queen is a derogatory term for a person, almost exclusively female and usually a single mother, who lives primarily from welfare and other public assistance funds. The term implies that the person collects welfare, charity, or other handouts either fraudulently or excessively and that the person intentionally chooses to live &quot;on the dole&quot; as opposed to seeking gainful employment, ostensibly due to laziness.

==== Vagrancy ====
A vagrant is derogatory term for a person in a situation of poverty, who wanders from place to place without a home or regular employment or income. Many towns in the developed world have shelters for vagrants. Common terminology is a tramp or a &#x27;gentleman of the road&#x27;.

Laws against vagrancy in the United States have partly been invalidated as violative of the due process clauses of the U.S. Constitution. However, the FBI report on crime in the United States for 2005 lists 24,359 vagrancy violations.

====&quot;Hobos&quot;, &quot;tramps&quot;, and &quot;bums&quot;====
A hobo is a migratory worker or homeless vagabond, often penniless. The term originated in the western—probably northwestern—United States during the last decade of the 19th century. Unlike tramps, who worked only when they were forced to, and bums, who did not work at all, hobos were workers who wandered.

In British English and traditional American English usage, a tramp is a long term homeless person who travels from place to place as an itinerant vagrant, traditionally walking or hiking all year round.

While some tramps may do odd jobs from time to time, unlike other temporarily homeless people they do not seek out regular work and support themselves by other means such as begging or scavenging. This is in contrast to:
* bum, a stationary homeless person who does not work, and who begs or steals for a living in one place.
* hobo, a homeless person who travels from place to place looking for work, often by &quot;freighthopping&quot;, illegally catching rides on freight trains
* Schnorrer, a Yiddish term for a person who travels from city to city begging.

Both terms, &quot;tramp&quot; and &quot;hobo&quot; (and the distinction between them), were in common use between the 1880s and the 1940s. Their populations and the usage of the terms increased during the Great Depression.

Like &quot;hobo&quot; and &quot;bum&quot;, the word &quot;tramp&quot; is considered vulgar in American English usage, having been subsumed in more polite contexts by words such as &quot;homeless person.&quot; In colloquial American English, the word &quot;tramp&quot; can also mean a sexually promiscuous female or even prostitute. Tramps used to be known euphemistically in England and Wales as &quot;gentlemen of the road&quot;.

Tramp is derived from the Middle English as a verb meaning to &quot;walk with heavy footsteps&quot;, and to go hiking. Bart Kennedy, a self-described tramp of 1900 US, once said &quot;I listen to the tramp, tramp of my feet, and wonder where I was going, and why I was going.&quot;

He is best known as the main leader of the Black Hand, a paramilitary secret society devoted to South Slav irredentism that organised the 1903 overthrow of the Serbian government and assassination of King Alexander I of Serbia and Queen Draga. Many scholars believe that he also sanctioned and helped organize the conspiracy behind the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand on 28 June 1914. This led directly to the July Crisis and the outbreak of World War I.

In 1916, the government in exile of Serbian Prime Minister Nikola Pašić, who considered Dimitrijević&#x27;s refusal to compromise on South Slav irredentism to represent a serious threat to the secret peace negotiations taking place with Vienna during the Sixtus Affair, filed charges of high treason against the leadership of Unification or Death. Dimitrijević was tried in Thessaloniki before a Serbian Army court martial arraigned by his opponents within the Serbian government. He was found guilty of conspiring to assassinate both the Archduke and Prince Regent Alexander Karađorđević and executed by firing squad, along with two senior associates on 26 June 1917.

==Early life==
Dragutin Dimitrijević was born in Belgrade, Principality of Serbia, on 19 August 1876. His father and two brothers were often away working as tinsmiths and he grew up with his two older sisters in Niš. At the age of nine, his father died. After Dimitrijević&#x27;s oldest sister married, the family moved back to Belgrade where, at the age of 16, Dimitrijević attended the Lyceum of the Principality of Serbia followed the Belgrade Military Academy as a cadet in 1892. Dimitrijević finished the academy&#x27;s lower school as sixth in his class in 1896. Two years later, he enrolled in the higher school. A brilliant student, upon graduation, he was assigned to the General staff of the Serbian Army, an indication that his superiors held him in high regard.

==May Coup==
In 1901, Dimitrijević participated in the organisation of the first failed attempt to murder the unpopular and pro-detente with Austria-Hungary King Alexander. On 11 June 1903 the plotters succeeded when Dimitrijević and a group of junior officers stormed the royal palace and killed King Alexander, his wife, Queen Draga and three others. During the attack, Dimitrijević was shot three times, and the bullets were never removed from his body.

Following the regicide, the Serbian Parliament described Dimitrijević as &quot;the saviour of the fatherland&quot;. In his memoirs, former Imperial Russian Foreign Office official Dmitri Abrikosov traced the inception of the Russo-Serbian military alliance that helped cause the First World War to the immediate aftermath of the 1903 palace coup and regicide. The new anti-Habsburg government of Serbia, as had been desired by Dimitrijević, dispatched a very clever diplomat to St Petersburg, where he successfully &quot;wooed the Slavophiles&quot; within the last Tsar&#x27;s government.

After various commands and staff positions he taught tactics at the Belgrade Military Academy. Around 1906 Dimitrijević visited Russia and Germany, where he learned the language and studied the latest military programs. In 1911 he helped founding (Unification or Death), commonly known as the Black Hand, a conspiratorial network supporting the formation of a Greater Serbia state. Dimitrijević, who used the code name &quot;Apis&quot;, became the leader of the Black Hand.

Dimitrijević&#x27;s main objective was the liberation and unification of all Serb populated regions under Ottoman or Austro-Hungarian rule, this became more urgent after the monarchy annexed Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1908 provoking the Bosnian Crisis. Austrian officials regarded the aspirations of Pan-Serbs as a significant threat to the Hapsburg Empire. During the Balkan Wars in 1912 and 1913, Dimitrijević took no part in the fighting. Dimitrijević had his men disguise as Albanians and commit political murders. In 1913 Dimitrijević was appointed chief of general staff intelligence in the Serbian army.

==Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand==
In 1911, Dimitrijević had organised an attempt to assassinate the Austrian Emperor Franz Josef. In early 1914 after finding out that three young Bosnian Serb students, led by nineteen year old Gavrilo Princip, were plotting to assassinate the heir to the Austro-Hungarian Empire, during his upcoming visit to Sarajevo, the Black Hand provided the conspirators with weapons and training in Belgrade. The support came from railways employee Milan Ciganović, a member of the Black Hand, with the presumed approval of Dimitrijević.

According to historian Christopher Clark, it is possible that Ciganović had been informing Serbian Prime Minister Nikola Pašić about the plot, but this speculation rests on indirect evidence. It is however believed that, after being warned of the presence of Bosnian terrorists, Pašić gave instructions for the arrest of young Bosnians who attempted to cross back into Bosnia. However, his orders were not implemented, and the three men arrived in what was then known as the Condominium of Bosnia and Herzegovina, where they joined forces with fellow conspirators recruited by Princip&#x27;s former roommate Danilo Ilić, Veljko and Vaso Čubrilović, Muhamed Mehmedbašić, Cvjetko Popović and Miško Jovanović. On 28 June 1914 Princip mortally wounded Franz Ferdinand and his wife Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg.

Surviving conspirator Vaso Čubrilović stated that the pistols and bombs used in the assassination were supplied to fellow Black Hand member Gavrilo Princip by Dimitrijević in Belgrade and then smuggled across the border, along with cyanide capsules for the conspirators to use to commit suicide in the event of capture. The failure of these cyanide capsules to work properly allowed the conspirators, who had received absolutely no training in how to withstand interrogation, to be easily tricked by Austrian police detectives and investigative magistrates into confessing and revealing the Colonel&#x27;s involvement.

On 23 July 1914, the Austro-Hungarian government sent its July Ultimatum to the Serbian government with a list of ten demands. In his response on 25 July 1914, Pašić accepted all the points of the ultimatum except the sixth, which demanded that Serbia allow an Austrian delegation to participate in a criminal investigation against those participants in the conspiracy that were in Serbia. Three days later, Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia. In 1916, Dimitrijević was promoted to colonel shortly before his arrest on the charge of high treason.

==Execution==
While engaged in secret peace negotiations with Emperor Charles I of Austria-Hungary during the Sixtus Affair that hinged upon showing that he was committed to preventing post-war outbreaks of state terrorism in the name of Yugoslavism or creating a Greater Serbia, Pašić decided that Col. Apis represented far too serious of a threat to Serbia&#x27;s chances of regaining its independence. The Prince Regent and the Prime Minister both set out to get rid of him and the most prominent leaders, even though the Black Hand had officially disbanded. Dimitrijević and several of his military colleagues were arrested in December 1916 and court-martialed for both the murder of the Archduke and the attempted assassination of Prince Regent Alexander I of Yugoslavia in September 1916. On 23 May 1917, during the &quot;Salonika Trial&quot;, Dimitrijević and three of his fellow defendants, Ljuba Vulović, Rade Malobabić, and Muhamed Mehmedbašić, confessed their roles in the assassination of the Archduke. Col. Dimitrijević was accordingly found guilty of high treason and sentenced to death.

In justifying the use of the death penalty, Prime Minister Pašić wrote to his envoy in London: &quot;...Dimitrijević (Apis) besides everything else admitted he had ordered Franz Ferdinand to be killed. And now who could reprieve them?&quot;

A month later, on 26 June 1917, Dimitrijević was executed by Royal Serbian Army firing squad. His last words were, &quot;Long live Yugoslavia!&quot;

In 1953, Dimitrijević and his codefendants were all posthumously retried by the Supreme Court of Serbia and found not guilty because there was no proof of their alleged participation in an assassination plot against the Prince Regent.

<text>James W. Kirchner is professor of Earth and Planetary Science at University of California, Berkeley. His current research spans the fields of geomorphology, hydrology, environmental geochemistry, evolutionary ecology, and paleobiology. He currently serves as the director of Berkeley&#x27;s Central Sierra Field Research Stations.

A study by Kirchner and Anne Weil showed that the time taken for life on earth to recover from extinction episodes such as that which destroyed the dinosaurs is not, as previously thought, proportional to the damage done. Instead, Kirchner and Wiel, analyzing fossil record data compiled by Jack Sepkoski, found that recovery time for catastrophic die-offs was about 10 million years regardless of the number of species lost. Kirchner has also been an active critic of the Gaia hypothesis.

<text>The following is a list of engagements that took place in 1861 during the American Civil War.
==History==
The war started on April 12 when Confederate forces commanded by General P. G. T. Beauregard opened fire on the Union garrison of Fort Sumter in the harbor of Charleston, South Carolina; after a thirty-four-hour bombardment, the Union garrison surrendered. There had been no casualties during the bombardment; but the following day while the Union garrison commander, Major Robert Anderson, was firing a fifty-gun salute, there was an explosion that resulted in one man being killed and five wounded. United States president Abraham Lincoln issued a proclamation calling for the states to raise 75,000 volunteers for ninety days to suppress the South; in response to the proclamation, an additional four states (Virginia, Arkansas, Tennessee, and North Carolina) seceded and joined the Confederacy, pledging troops to the volunteer forces it was raising.

In the Eastern Theater, there were two major campaigns in Virginia. The first, the Western Virginia Campaign, started in May. Union forces commanded by Major General George B. McClellan invaded western Virginia and drove the Confederate forces from the area following a series of small skirmishes. Although these fights involved only a few hundred men on either side, the newspaper coverage of the campaign turned McClellan into a national hero. After McClellan was transferred to command the Army of the Potomac, Confederate General Robert E. Lee was assigned to drive the Union forces out of the state but failed to do so at Cheat Mountain and in the Kanawha Valley; Lee was subsequently transferred to other duties in November. The other major campaign ended with the First Battle of Bull Run on July 17, when Union forces commanded by Major General Irvin McDowell attacked the Confederate Army of the Potomac, commanded by Brigadier General P.G.T. Beauregard; although initially successful, Confederate reinforcements from the Shenandoah Valley routed McDowell and forced him back to Washington, D.C. McDowell was replaced by McClellan, who renamed his force the Army of the Potomac and spent the rest of the year training his men and stockpiling supplies, despite pressure from the Union government to launch an offensive as soon as possible. There were several minor skirmishes in Virginia during the remainder of the year, the most significant being the Battle of Ball&#x27;s Bluff, due to the death of Colonel Edward Baker, a senator from Oregon. Outrage in Congress over his death led to the creation of the Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War, which was used by the Radical Republicans in Congress in an attempt to prosecute the war according to their views.
In the Western Theater, there were several skirmishes in the border southern state of Kentucky but no major battles. Kentucky, with divided sympathies, attempted to declare itself neutral; however, Confederate Major General Leonidas Polk sent a force to occupy Columbus, Kentucky, saying it was necessary for the defense of the Mississippi River. The Kentucky legislature then requested Union help in driving the Confederates out of the state, at which point both armies set up defensive positions all through the state. Most of the legislature were Unionists, but a pro-Confederate state government, with some members of the legislature and delegates sent by 68 Kentucky Counties was organized in the Russellville Convention forming the Confederate government of Kentucky and bringing more than half of Kentucky under Confederate control; both armies then began recruiting efforts. Along the Atlantic seacoast and Gulf coast, Union forces captured several coastal areas for use as naval ports for the Union blockade, including Port Royal, South Carolina and the Outer Banks of North Carolina. Lincoln declared on April 19 a blockade of the Confederate coastline and ports; this required the Union navy to build hundreds of ships to enforce the blockade, growing from forty-two ships in April to a total of 264 ships at the end of the year.

In the Trans-Mississippi Theater, most of the fighting took place in Missouri between the pro-secessionist Missouri State Guard, commanded by Major General Sterling Price, and the Union Department of the West. Union forces under the command of Brigadier General Nathaniel Lyon drove the Missouri State Guard and the pro-secessionist portion of the state government into the southwestern part of the state, where it united with the Confederate Western Army commanded by Brigadier General Benjamin McCulloch. There, on August 10 in the Battle of Wilson&#x27;s Creek, Lyon attacked the combined forces of Price and McCulloch and was defeated, with Lyon being killed during the battle. McCulloch returned to Arkansas, while Price moved north, attempting to recapture the state from Union forces. Another Confederate offensive took place in the New Mexico Territory, where a Confederate cavalry battalion moved into the southwestern part of the territory and captured Fort Filmore, forcing the surrender of the Union garrison. A secessionist convention in Mesilla declared the southern portion of the territory to be the Confederate Territory of Arizona and raised several militia companies, which fought several skirmishes with both the Union forces remaining in the territory and the Apache tribes.

<text>David Sullivan Lovering (born December 6, 1961) is an American musician and magician. He is best known as the drummer for the alternative rock band Pixies, which he joined in 1986. After the band&#x27;s breakup in 1993, Lovering drummed with several other acts, including The Martinis, Cracker, Nitzer Ebb and Tanya Donelly. He also pursued a magic career as the Scientific Phenomenalist, performing scientific and physics-based experiments on stage. When the Pixies reunited in 2004, Lovering returned as the band&#x27;s drummer.

As a drummer Lovering was inspired by bands from a variety of genres, including Rush and Steely Dan.

==Biography==
===Youth and college===
David Lovering was born in Winchester, Massachusetts and grew up in Burlington, Massachusetts. He learned to play drums during his teenage years and joined his high school&#x27;s marching band. According to his friend John Murphy, Lovering was always very &quot;drum oriented&quot; in his musical taste. In his high school yearbook entry, Lovering stated his three main ambitions: to be in a rock band, to be an electrical engineer, and to tour with Rush, his favorite band.

After graduating from high school, Lovering studied electronic engineering at the Wentworth Institute of Technology in Boston. He got a job at a Radio Shack store with Murphy, and the pair often played practical jokes while at work. One such incident involved Lovering wiring the store toilet to a fire alarm. After graduating from Wentworth with an associate degree in 1985, he took a job building lasers, and continued to drum in local bands such as Iz Wizard and Riff Raff. A number of different genres of music have influenced him, including bands Steely Dan, Led Zeppelin, and Devo.

===Pixies===

On Memorial Day 1985, Lovering attended Murphy and Kim Deal&#x27;s wedding service. In January 1986 Deal was hired to play bass in the newly formed Pixies, an alternative rock band formed by Charles &quot;Black Francis&quot; Thompson and Joey Santiago. Murphy suggested that Lovering audition for the band – who were still without a drummer. Lovering had stopped drumming by this point and was at first unimpressed by the trio&#x27;s performance of the band&#x27;s songs. However, after playing along he agreed to join. Lovering and the band wrote and rehearsed material throughout 1985 and 1986 and performed at small venues in Boston. The band decided to record 18 songs for a demo tape in 1987. Lovering co-wrote one of the tape&#x27;s songs, &quot;Levitate Me&quot; (his only major writing contribution to any Pixies song) and appeared on the cassette&#x27;s front cover, jogging naked with his back turned to the camera. &quot;Levitate Me&quot; later appeared on the band&#x27;s first release &quot;Come on Pilgrim&quot;, which included seven other songs taken from the demo tape.

The Pixies entered the studio again in 1988 to record their second album &quot;Surfer Rosa&quot;. Lovering&#x27;s contribution on songs such as &quot;Bone Machine&quot; – which begins with a 10-second drum solo – &quot;Break My Body&quot; and &quot;River Euphrates&quot; established his steady, accurate style. &quot;Doolittle&quot;, the band&#x27;s major label debut, followed in 1989. During the album&#x27;s recording sessions, Thompson convinced Lovering to sing on &quot;La La Love You&quot;, which had been written as a &quot;dig at the very idea of a love song&quot;. The album&#x27;s producer Gil Norton later said that during the sessions Lovering &quot;went from not wanting to sing a note to &#x27;I can&#x27;t get him away from the microphone&#x27;. He was such a showman&quot;. In addition to drums and vocals, Lovering played bass guitar on the album&#x27;s penultimate track, &quot;Silver&quot;.

After the release of &quot;Doolittle&quot;, the relationship between the band members became strained because of constant touring and the pressure of releasing three albums in two years. After the final date of the &quot;Doolittle&quot; &quot;Fuck or Fight&quot; tour in November 1989, the band was too exhausted to attend their end-of-tour party the following night and shortly afterwards announced a hiatus. After the band reconvened in mid-1990, Lovering moved to Los Angeles along with the rest of the band. The Pixies released two more albums, &quot;Bossanova&quot; (1990) and &quot;Trompe le Monde&quot; (1991). Lovering sang lead vocals on the &quot;Velouria&quot; B-side &quot;Make Believe&quot;; a song about his admitted &quot;obsession&quot; with US singer-songwriter Debbie Gibson. The Pixies toured sporadically throughout 1991 and 1992. They eventually broke up in 1992, mostly due to tensions between Thompson and Deal, although it was not publicly announced until 1993.

===The Scientific Phenomenalist and other projects===
Following the Pixies&#x27; breakup, Lovering drummed with several artists, including Nitzer Ebb, but turned down an invitation to join the Foo Fighters. Lovering then joined Santiago&#x27;s band The Martinis, appearing on their song &quot;Free&quot; on the soundtrack of &quot;Empire Records&quot;. However, he soon left the band to become a touring drummer for Cracker. Lovering moved from band to band, drumming with Tanya Donelly&#x27;s group on 1997&#x27;s &quot;Lovesongs for Underdogs&quot; and with Boston band Eeenie Meenie. After facing difficulty finding new work, Lovering gave up the drums and moved into a rented house that banned drumming.

Towards the end of the 1990s, Lovering&#x27;s friend Grant-Lee Phillips took him to a magic convention. Lovering was very impressed by some of the illusions, and later said &quot;I had to learn how to do it&quot;. Mutual friend Carl Grasso invited them to a show at the Magic Castle, a magic-oriented nightclub in Los Angeles. There Lovering met Possum Dixon frontman Rob Zabrecky, and the pair soon became friends. Zabrecky convinced Lovering to apply for a performers&#x27; membership to the Magic Castle. After gaining his membership, Lovering reinvented himself as &quot;The Scientific Phenomenalist&quot;. His act combined his electrical engineering knowledge with his stage performance experience. His decision to pursue a career in magic was influenced by the fact that as a musician, he &quot;couldn&#x27;t top the Pixies&quot;. Lovering elaborated: &quot;When [Pixies] broke up [in 1993], it was traumatic because it was something I loved doing and it was suddenly gone. I didn’t know what I was going to do in that time off, so I picked magic. You’ve heard of the starving musician? Well, I was the dying magician, so it’s not the wisest career choice! But magic gave me confidence, because with the Pixies, I was behind three people and a drumkit, whereas when I did my first magic show in front of an audience of just six people, I could have wrung my shirt out with sweat!&quot;

As the Scientific Phenomentalist, Lovering performs science and physics experiments in a lab coat while on stage. He shuns traditional magic tricks, and prefers &quot;things that are more mental, using mental powers&quot;. He later explained: &quot;It&#x27;s all kind of upbeat, really weird physics experiments that you&#x27;ll never see. [...] I&#x27;d rather have them [the audience] going &#x27;Is it [magic] or isn&#x27;t it?&#x27; rather than &#x27;It&#x27;s all science&#x27; or &#x27;It&#x27;s all magic&#x27;. So I do kinda weird things that other magicians don&#x27;t do&quot;. Lovering cites sleight-of-hand artist Ricky Jay, mind reader Max Maven and Eugene Burger as influences on his technique. His performances often involve intricate self-built machines.

Lovering became part of The Unholy Three, a trio of magicians that resides at the Magic Castle, and performs &quot;a new wave, alternative, avant-garde kind of magic&quot;. He toured his act across the United States as the opener for Frank Black (the new stage name of former Pixies bandmate Thompson), Grant-Lee Phillips, the Breeders and Camper Van Beethoven. He performed his act at the Shellac-curated All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties music festival in 2002. He later commented that his performance at the festival was &quot;perhaps my greatest achievement&quot;. Lovering resumed drumming, appearing at some Frank Black and the Catholics shows. He also appeared on one track of The Martinis&#x27; 2004 album &quot;The Smitten Sessions&quot;.

===Pixies reunion===

By the summer of 2003, Lovering was feeling depressed. In a 2004 interview, he commented: &quot;I remember I was on the way to the bank, and I was just bummed out—everything, financially, was really a mess for me. I was involved in this relationship that was absolutely terrible. I was bottoming out. And I&#x27;m on the way to the bank and my cellphone rings. It&#x27;s Joe [Santiago]; he says, &#x27;Guess what?&#x27;&quot; Santiago had just received a call from Thompson stating his desire to reunite the Pixies. Lovering was overjoyed at the news. He added that &quot;the saddest thing is that when I sat down to rehearse for the Pixies, I couldn&#x27;t believe that I had given up something that I loved&quot;. In 2004 Lovering and the band recorded their reunion single, &quot;Bam Thwok&quot;.

Lovering appeared in the 2006 documentary &quot;loudQUIETloud&quot;, which covered the Pixies&#x27; 2004 reunion tour. His father died midway during the tour, and Lovering began drinking heavily as a result. According to Thompson, Lovering &quot;messed up a couple of songs&quot; during a number of live shows. &quot;It was all caught on film&quot;, said Thompson, &quot;but they re-edited this to look like it happened in the middle of our tour and it looked like this whole tour careened into this drunken stupor with David. It really wasn&#x27;t like that at all&quot;. He toured with the Pixies throughout 2005 and 2006, while performing at the Magic Castle on Friday nights with The Unholy Three. In 2007, Lovering played a benefit concert for Wally Ingram as part of The Martinis. Later that year, he formed a new band called The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, with Los Angeles musicians Amit Itelman and Oscar Rey.

==Personal life==

Lovering is a practicing magician; when the Pixies were unable to perform during the COVID-19 lockdown, he began posting videos of his magic tricks on the Pixies’ Instagram account. The first video was posted on April 1, 2021, and became a weekly occurrence called “Magic Mondays”. That September, Lovering announced that he was switching the videos to once a month instead of weekly, rebranding them “Magic Monthly”.

Lovering has been metal detecting since the age of 11, when he purchased his first metal detector, a Bounty Hunter VLF 840. He began metal detecting in his backyard in Burlington, Massachusetts, finding many colonial era coins. Lovering often metal detects in the hills near his home in Southern California.

<doc id="760682" wikidata="Q908602" url="?curid=760682" title="Donald Broadbent">
<text>Donald Eric (D. E.) Broadbent CBE, FRS (Birmingham, 6 May 1926 – 10 April 1993) was an influential experimental psychologist from the United Kingdom. His career and research bridged the gap between the pre-World War II approach of Sir Frederic Bartlett and what became known as cognitive psychology in the late 1960s. A &quot;Review of General Psychology&quot; survey, published in 2002, ranked Broadbent as the 54th most cited psychologist of the 20th century.

==Biography==
Although born in Birmingham, Broadbent considered himself Welsh and spent considerable time in Wales during his youth. Despite family and financial circumstances, Broadbent&#x27;s mother managed to send him to Winchester; she didn&#x27;t ever want him to be disadvantaged compared to others with a superior education. He said of her aims to do this that &quot;instead of getting me to the best schooling she could afford, she made up her mind with sublime arrogance as to which she thought was the best school in the country, and that was where I went: Winchester.&quot; His father was by then gone, though earlier he had been part of their lives, and even at times successful in the business he helped run. He lived after his father left in Llandyman and later Mold.

Before his military service, he struggled to find his niche in the realm of education after experimenting in the classics, history, and the physical sciences, of which his favorite was the sciences. During his time training in the United States however, he was exposed to a more widely accepted and studied field of psychology that piqued his interest. When he returned and attended Cambridge, he made this his field of study despite attempts to dissuade him by the admission committee. He studied experimental psychology under the guidance of Frederic Bartlett who was a pragmatic teacher focused on evidence before theory. Another, less direct influence on his education was Kenneth Craik, who—though recently passed away—had been and was extremely influential on the department. Upon graduating in 1949 he became a member of the Applied Psychology Unit at Cambridge. 

Educated at the University of Cambridge, in 1958 he became director of the Applied Psychology Research Unit, set up by the UK Medical Research Council in 1944 to focus on Frederic Bartlett&#x27;s work. Although most of the work at the APRU was directed at practical issues of the military or private industry, Broadbent became well known for his theoretical work. His theories of selective attention and short-term memory were developed as digital computers were becoming available to the academic community, and were among the first to use computer analogies to make serious contributions to the analysis of human cognition. These theories were combined to form what became known as the &quot;single channel hypothesis.&quot; Broadbent&#x27;s filter model of attention proposed that the physical characteristics (e.g., pitch, loudness) of an auditory message were used to focus attention to only a single message. Broadbent&#x27;s filter model is referred to as an Early Selection Model because irrelevant messages are filtered out BEFORE the stimulus information is processed for meaning. These and other theories were brought together in his 1958 book &quot;Perception and Communication,&quot; which remains one of the classic texts of cognitive psychology. In 1974 Broadbent became a fellow of Wolfson College, Oxford and returned to applied science; along with his colleague Dianne Berry, he developed new ideas about implicit learning from consideration of human performance in complex industrial processes.

The Applied Psychology Unit was responsible for advising the government and he worked in studies with noise and technology. His work on attention stemmed out of his desire to develop better communication between squadron planes and control centers. He had begun this work previous to working at the Applied Psychology Unit while working for the Royal Navy, and eventually this focus led to the filter model of attention he is most famous for. He continued to visit the United States on occasion as part of his work.

In 1958 he published his most-cited work, the book &quot;Perception and Communication&quot;, and that same year he became the director of the Applied Psychology Unit and led it to become a world authority in applied psychology. His book changed the face of psychology and is attributed as a significant factor in the development of the field of cognitive psychology. In order to better pursue his personal research, he transferred to the Department of Experimental Psychology in Oxford in 1974. This is where he developed the CFQ—the Cognitive Failures Questionnaire—which examined effects of occupation on health, and continued his work on attention and memory.

He went on to publish &quot;Behaviour&quot;, &quot;Decision and Stress&quot;, and &quot;In Defence of Empirical Psychology&quot; as well as nearly 250 miscellaneous articles or commentaries. He died only two years after his retirement on 10 April 1993.

==Filter model of attention==

Broadbent&#x27;s filter model of attention proposes the existence of a theoretical filter device, located between the incoming sensory register, and the short-term memory storage. His theory is based on the multi-storage paradigm of William James (1890) and the more recent &#x27;multi-store&#x27; memory model by Atkinson &amp; Shiffrin in 1968. This filter functions together with a buffer, and enables the subject to handle two kinds of stimuli presented at the same time. One of the inputs is allowed through the filter, while the other waits in the buffer for later processing. The filter prevents the overloading of the limited-capacity mechanism located beyond the filter, which is the short-term memory. Broadbent came up with this theory based on data from an experiment: three pairs of different digits are presented simultaneously, one set of three digits in one ear, and another set of three digits in the other. Most participants recalled the digits ear by ear, rather than pair by pair. Therefore, if 496 were presented to one ear and 852 to the other, the recall would be 496852 rather than 489562.

The theory has difficulties explaining the famous cocktail party effect, proposed by British scientist Colin Cherry, which tries to explain how we are able to focus our attention toward the stimuli we find most interesting.

==Personal life==
In 1949 he married Margaret E. Wright, also from Mold, in the district of Holywel. Together they had two daughters before going separate ways; the marriage was dissolved in 1972 when Broadbent married Margaret Gregory, who had worked as his research assistant and became a lifelong collaborator.

==Honours==
A lecture in Broadbent&#x27;s honour is given at the annual conference of the British Psychological Society.

<text>John Stein (5 October 1922 – 10 September 1985) was a Scottish football player and manager. He was the first manager of a club from a Northern European country to win the European Cup, with Celtic in 1967. Stein also guided Celtic to nine successive Scottish League championships between 1966 and 1974.

Stein worked as a coalminer while playing football part-time for Blantyre Victoria and then Albion Rovers. He became a full-time professional football player with Welsh club Llanelli Town, but returned to Scotland with Celtic in 1951. He enjoyed some success with Celtic, winning the Coronation Cup in 1953 and a Scottish league and Scottish Cup double in 1954. Ankle injuries forced Stein to retire from playing football in 1957.

Celtic appointed Stein to coach their reserve team after he retired as a player. Stein started his managerial career in 1960 with Dunfermline, where he won the Scottish Cup in 1961 and achieved some notable results in European football. After a brief but successful spell at Hibernian, Stein returned to Celtic as manager in March 1965. In thirteen years at Celtic, Stein won the European Cup, ten Scottish league championships, eight Scottish Cups and six Scottish League Cups. After a brief stint with Leeds United, Stein managed Scotland from 1978 until his death in 1985.

==Early life and playing career==
John Stein was born on 5 October 1922 at 339 Glasgow Road in Hamilton, Lanarkshire, the only son of four children to George Stein, a coal miner, and Jane Armstrong. Stein saw football as his escape from the Lanarkshire coal mines. In 1937, he left Greenfield school in Hamilton and after a short time working in a carpet factory went down the pits to become a miner. In 1940, Stein agreed to sign for Burnbank Athletic, but his father vehemently objected. Soon afterward, he instead joined Blantyre Victoria, another local junior club.

Stein first played for senior club Albion Rovers as a trialist in a 4–4 draw against Celtic on 14 November 1942. On 3 December 1942, manager Webber Lees signed Stein for the Coatbridge club. He continued to work as a miner during the week, which was a reserved occupation during the Second World War. This allowed Stein to play regularly, as many of their other players were serving in the Armed Forces. He had a brief loan spell with Dundee United in 1943. Rovers won promotion to the First Division in 1947–48, for only the fourth time in the club&#x27;s history.

During the 1948–49 season, Rovers conceded 105 goals, won only three league games out of 30 and were relegated back to the Second Division.

According to Rovers&#x27; historian Robin Marwick, Stein played 236 matches for Rovers, who were his longest serving senior club as a player. He scored nine goals, six of which were penalties (he also missed two penalties). His last Rovers appearance was against Alloa in a B Division match on 14 January 1950.

In 1950, having been approached by former Albion Rovers teammate Dougie Wallace, Stein signed for non-league Welsh club Llanelli. For the first time in his career, he became a full-time professional footballer, earning £12 per week. Llanelli had gained promotion to the Southern League in 1950 and signed several Scottish professionals. In 1951, the club&#x27;s application to join the Football League was rejected and there were rumours of financial problems. All but two of the Scottish professionals left.

Stein initially left his wife, Jean, and young daughter, Ray, in Scotland when he moved to Llanelli. His family moved down soon afterwards, but his council house in Hamilton was burgled about eight weeks after they moved. Jean wanted to return to Scotland, and Stein accepted her desire in light of his own disillusionment with the problems at the club. When asked what he would do by the Llanelli manager, Stein said he would probably quit football and become a miner again.

In December 1951, on the recommendation of reserve team trainer Jimmy Gribben, Celtic bought him for £1,200. He was signed as a reserve but injuries incurred by first team players resulted in him being elevated to the first team. In 1952, he was appointed vice-captain; when captain Sean Fallon suffered a broken arm, the captaincy was passed to Stein.

Celtic finished eighth in the Scottish League during 1952–53 and were only invited to the pan-British Coronation Cup tournament due to their large support base. Celtic beat Arsenal, Manchester United and Hibernian to win the trophy. This success was built upon in 1953–54, as Stein captained the side that won a League and Scottish Cup double. It was their first League championship since 1938 and first League and Scottish Cup double since 1914. As a reward for their achievement, the club paid for all of the players to attend the 1954 FIFA World Cup in Switzerland. Celtic had also sent their players to watch the England v Hungary match in 1953. Stein was influenced by Scotland&#x27;s poor preparation and the impressive performance of Hungary.

Stein received his only international recognition in 1954, when he was selected for the Scottish Football League XI. It was not a happy experience for Stein, as his direct opponent, Bedford Jezzard, scored two goals as The Football League XI won 4–0 at Stamford Bridge.

In 1954–55, Celtic finished second in the league and lost the 1955 Scottish Cup final to Clyde. Stein was forced to retire from football after suffering persistent ankle injuries during the 1955–56 season. While playing in a friendly in Coleraine in May 1956, he landed awkwardly and rolled over on the ankle. Two weeks later he had an operation to remove a bone nodule, after which he was ordered to rest until fully recuperated. While on a holiday in Blackpool, the ankle irritated Stein, who found that it had become septic. He was no longer able to flex the joint and had to stop playing, officially retiring on 29 January 1957.

==Managerial career==

===Celtic reserves===
In July 1957, Stein was given the job of coaching the Celtic reserve team. His squad included a number of young players who would later play under him in the first team, including Billy McNeill, Bobby Murdoch and John Clark. In his first season as a coach, Stein won the Reserve Cup with an 8–2 aggregate triumph over Rangers.

Despite this success, according to football journalist Archie MacPherson, Stein was told by club chairman Robert Kelly he would not progress further at Celtic due to his Protestant faith; Celtic had only previously appointed Catholics as managers, though one of these, Willie Maley had spent 50 years at the club and Stein was only the fourth person to be appointed Celtic manager, after Maley, Jimmy McStay and Jimmy McGrory, who was manager for 20 years. It was later suggested that Stein was allowed to leave Celtic temporarily with the intention of later appointing him manager, but MacPherson found no evidence for this.

===Dunfermline===
On 14 March 1960, Stein was appointed manager of Dunfermline. When Stein was appointed, the team were only two points above last place and mired in a battle against relegation. The team had not won in four months, but then won their first six matches managed by Stein. To build upon this initial success, Stein signed Willie Cunningham and Tommy McDonald from Leicester City. Dunfermline became a powerful force and Stein guided them to their first Scottish Cup victory in 1961, winning 2–0 in a replayed final against Celtic. This success prompted job offers from Newcastle United and Hibernian, both of which were rejected by Stein.

In the 1961–62 season, Dunfermline progressed to the quarter-final of the 1961–62 European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup and finished in fourth place in the league. Their league position earned a place in the Fairs Cup after a Greek club withdrew. Dunfermline defeated Everton in the 1962–63 Fairs Cup and retrieved a four-goal deficit against Valencia, but then lost in a play-off game. Towards the end of the 1963–64 season, it became apparent that Hibs wanted to replace their manager, Walter Galbraith. It was reported in the media on 27 February that Stein would leave Dunfermline at the end of the season. A fortnight later, amid speculation that Stein would move to Hibernian, Galbraith left the Edinburgh club. On 28 March, Dunfermline lost in a Scottish Cup semi-final against Rangers. It was announced two days later that Stein would leave Dunfermline with immediate effect, allowing him to take charge at Hibernian.

===Hibernian===
Stein was appointed manager of Hibernian in March 1964. Although Hibs had a bigger support base than Dunfermline and had enjoyed success in the 1950s, the club was struggling. Hibs had narrowly avoided relegation in 1963 and were sitting in 12th place when Stein was appointed. The players noticed an immediate difference from previous managers as Stein took an active part in practice sessions. Stein built his defence around John McNamee, who had been discarded by Celtic, and Pat Stanton. In midfield he had Pat Quinn and Willie Hamilton, who were talented players but had under-achieved. Hamilton had problems with drinking and gambling, but he produced his best performances under Stein&#x27;s guidance. Stein led Hibs to victory in the Summer Cup, their first trophy in ten years. Neil Martin scored regularly and was capped for Scotland under Stein.

The 1964–65 league season started with an Edinburgh derby defeat by Hearts, but Hibs managed to recover from this setback. Stein invited Real Madrid for a friendly game in Edinburgh, which Hibernian won 2–0 in front of a crowd of 32,000, further boosting his prestige. Wolves asked Stein if he wanted to replace Stan Cullis as their manager. Stein then approached Celtic chairman Bob Kelly, ostensibly to ask his advice about the offer from Wolves, but in the hope that he would be offered the Celtic job instead. Kelly first offered Stein the position of assistant manager (to Sean Fallon), which Stein rejected. Kelly then offered Stein the chance to be joint manager with Fallon, but this was also rejected by Stein, who suggested he would rather go to Wolves if Celtic would not offer full control. Billy McNeill believed that Kelly&#x27;s initial reluctance was due to Stein&#x27;s religion. Kelly eventually agreed to offer Stein full powers over team selection. Hibs tried to convince Stein to stay, even attempting to persuade his wife Jean, but becoming Celtic manager had been his long-held ambition. While Stein was still Hibs manager, he arranged for Celtic to sign Bertie Auld from Birmingham City and allowed Hibs goalkeeper Ronnie Simpson to join Celtic. Some people claimed with hindsight that he had deliberately allowed Simpson to join Celtic before moving himself, but in fact it was due to a wage dispute.

It was announced on 31 January that Stein would leave Hibs for Celtic at the end of the 1964–65 season. Stein left Hibs in early March, after he had arranged for Dundee manager Bob Shankly to take the Hibs job. When Stein left, Hibs were near the top of the league and had reached the semi-finals of the 1964–65 Scottish Cup. Hibs had defeated Rangers in the quarter-final, in his last game as Hibs manager. They failed to win either competition, however, and Stein later admitted that &quot;leaving Hibs at that time was probably my most embarrassing experience in football&quot;. Stein was statistically the best ever manager of Hibs, with a win rate of 62%.

===Celtic===
He returned to Celtic in March 1965, becoming the club&#x27;s first Protestant manager and the fourth manager in club history. Celtic were struggling in the league and continued to have mixed results, winning his first game 6–0 at Airdrie, but then losing 4–2 to Hibs and 6–2 to Falkirk. In the period between the announcement of Stein&#x27;s move to Celtic and his arrival, Celtic had progressed to the semi-finals of the 1964–65 Scottish Cup. Celtic were drawn against Motherwell, who had dangerous forwards such as Joe McBride and Willie Hunter. Stein prepared the Celtic players with tactical advice, which they had never received before. Celtic came from behind twice against Motherwell to force a replay, which they won 3–0. This set up a final against Dunfermline, who had beaten Hibs in the other semi-final. Celtic again came from behind twice before Billy McNeill scored the winning goal, giving Celtic their first Scottish Cup since 1954.

For the 1965–66 season, Stein made one major signing, Joe McBride from Motherwell. McBride rewarded Stein with 43 goals that season. Celtic lost the first Old Firm derby that season, but gained revenge by winning the League Cup final against Rangers. Celtic reached the semi-finals of the UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, but were beaten 2–1 on aggregate by Liverpool. Five minutes before the end of the second leg at Anfield, Bobby Lennox appeared to score a goal that would have put Celtic through on the away goals rule, but it was controversially disallowed for offside. Celtic were involved in a tight Scottish league championship race with Rangers, who they also played in the 1966 Scottish Cup final. The final was lost after a replay, to a goal by Kai Johansen. Stein blamed John Hughes for failing to mark Johansen. Celtic won the league championship, however, for the first time in 12 years.

Stein was very confident entering the 1966–67 season, saying to his players that he believed &quot;we could win everything&quot;. Celtic won the first Old Firm game of the season 2–0, scoring both goals in the first five minutes. The team went on a long unbeaten run that was finally ended by a 3–2 defeat by Dundee United on 31 December. Stein surprised some observers by signing forward Willie Wallace from Hearts in December, when the team was already scoring freely and had strikers Stevie Chalmers and Joe McBride at his disposal. As it happened, McBride soon afterwards suffered a knee injury that required surgery.

In the 1966–67 European Cup, Celtic progressed through the first two rounds with relatively comfortable wins against Zurich and Nantes. Celtic then faced Yugoslav side Vojvodina, who Chalmers later described as &quot;the best team we played in the whole tournament&quot;. A miss-kick by Tommy Gemmell allowed Vojvodina to score the only goal of the first leg, played in Yugoslavia. In the return game, Celtic drew the aggregate score level with a goal by Chalmers in the 58th minute. Stein was agitated during the game, frequently glancing at his watch. Near the end, he remarked to Sean Fallon that &quot;it looks like bloody Rotterdam!&quot;, citing where a play-off match would have been held if the tie had finished level. Instead, McNeill headed in a tie-winning goal from a corner kick during injury time. Celtic then defeated Dukla Prague 3–1 in the first (home) leg of the semi-final, with Wallace scoring twice. In the return game, Celtic sustained heavy pressure but held out for a goalless draw. It became a common belief that Stein had abandoned his attacking principles for that game, but Bobby Lennox, McNeill and Chalmers all later said that Stein had not set out defensive tactics beforehand.

Four days after the second leg against Dukla, Celtic defeated Aberdeen 2–0 in the 1967 Scottish Cup final. Celtic were involved in a close race with Rangers for the Scottish league championship, decided by an Old Firm game at Ibrox on the last day of the league season. Celtic needed a point to clinch the championship. Archie Macpherson wrote in his biography of Stein that it was one of the best Old Firm games he had seen, as both sides played without a fear of losing: Rangers needed the victory to win the championship, while Stein believed Celtic&#x27;s best chances lay in attacking their opponents. Rangers took the lead in the 40th minute, but Celtic equalised within a minute thanks to a &quot;scrambled effort&quot; by Jimmy Johnstone. Celtic went 2–1 ahead with 15 minutes remaining, when Johnstone beat some opponents then fired a left-footed shot high into the net. Roger Hynd scored an equalising goal for Rangers, but the match finished in a 2–2 draw and Celtic won the championship.

With the 3–1 aggregate victory against Dukla, Celtic progressed to the 1967 European Cup final. The other finalists were Italian giants Inter Milan, prior winners of the competition. Despite initially falling behind to an Inter penalty, his team triumphed 2–1, winning much admiration for the positive attacking quality of their football. In winning club football&#x27;s most prestigious trophy, Stein became the first man not only to guide a Scottish club to champions of Europe, but also the first to achieve this honour with a British club. Furthermore, he became the first manager to win the European Treble, and remains the only manager to win the fabled Quadruple, thanks to his side&#x27;s earlier League Cup triumph over Rangers. All of this was achieved with a team all born within 30 miles of Glasgow. Shortly after winning the European Cup, Bill Shankly told Stein &quot;John, you&#x27;re immortal now&quot;.

The following season, Celtic won the League and League Cup for the third season in a row. In 1969 they won another domestic treble, their second in three years. In 1970, Stein led Celtic to a League and League Cup double; they also finished runners-up in the Scottish Cup. He also guided them to a second European Cup final in 1970, knocking out Benfica and Leeds United en route, but they lost to Dutch side Feyenoord in Milan. Around this time, Manchester United made efforts to persuade Stein to join them as manager. Stein declined their advances, a decision he later told Alex Ferguson that he regretted.

He was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1970. Stein would have been knighted instead if not for an infamous Intercontinental Cup final match against Racing Club where four Celtic players were sent off.

The 1970s brought continued success on the domestic front. During this time Stein&#x27;s Celtic completed a record of nine consecutive Scottish league championships, equalling a world record held at the time by MTK Budapest and CSKA Sofia This sustained success became routine to the extent that attendance figures fell during the later part of the run, with the decline at Celtic being above the league average. This prompted the Scottish Football League to consider league reconstruction, which was enacted in 1975.

Stein was badly injured in a car crash in 1975; he nearly died but eventually recovered. Sean Fallon assumed control as manager for most of the 1975–76 season. Stein returned to his position at the start of the 1976–77 season. Davie McParland joined Celtic at this time, replacing Sean Fallon as assistant manager and working under Stein. McParland took charge of the &#x27;tracksuit&#x27; aspects of coaching at Celtic while Stein watched from the touchline, still not fully recovered from the serious car smash he was involved in the year before. Stein signed Hibernian&#x27;s long-serving captain, defender Pat Stanton. Later on in the season, Stein signed attacking midfielder Alfie Conn from Tottenham Hotspur. It was a transfer that surprised many, given Conn had played for Rangers in the early 70s, winning the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup for them in 1972 and scoring in a 3–2 win over Celtic in the 1973 Scottish Cup final. Conn became the first footballer post-World War II to play for both Rangers and Celtic. Celtic, helped considerably by Stanton&#x27;s organisation of the defence, went on to win their tenth league and cup double; Celtic finished nine points ahead of Rangers in the league and beat them 1–0 in the 1977 Scottish Cup final courtesy of an Andy Lynch penalty.

Celtic struggled in the 1977–78 season and Stein was persuaded to stand down. He was allowed to nominate his successor, Billy McNeill, and Stein thought an agreement was in place for him to join the Celtic board of directors. Celtic instead offered a management position in their pools company, which Stein rejected as he believed he still had something to offer football. A testimonial match for Stein was played against Liverpool at Celtic Park on 14 August 1978. After the game, the Liverpool manager Bob Paisley encouraged Stein, who was three years younger than Paisley, to stay in football. There was also the example of Bill Shankly, who had experienced an unhappy retirement since leaving Liverpool in 1974.

===Leeds United===
In August 1978, Stein was appointed manager of Leeds United. The players at Leeds received the news well, but were concerned that Stein had never shown any previous interest in managing in England. Early results were mixed, although the Leeds chairman Manny Cussins detected some improvement from the previous few seasons, when Leeds had slipped from their dominant position in English football. Attendances at Elland Road were low and Stein apparently missed the pressure of big games against foreign opposition.

Ally MacLeod had just resigned as Scotland manager, having clung to office for only one match after their failure at the 1978 World Cup. 
The day after MacLeod&#x27;s departure journalist Jim Reynolds had written in &quot;The Glasgow Herald&quot; in relation to Scotland&#x27;s search for a new manager that &quot;The ideal choice would, of course, have been Jock Stein, but the SFA are five weeks too late&quot; adding that it was &quot;most unlikely&quot; that he could be tempted to take the Scotland job &quot;until he has given it a real go at Elland Road.&quot; However the next day Reynolds wrote in the same newspaper that Stein was a front runner for the job and reported that former Scotland boss Willie Ormond considered him to be &quot;the obvious choice&quot; if he would be prepared to take the job. Stein was quoted as saying &quot;There is little I can say about the situation. If Scotland want me they must approach the club first.&quot; However the report ended by quoting Manny Cussins as stating he was &quot;certain Jock Stein is happy at Leeds and will not leave to take the Scottish job&quot;. He also indicated that if players could be &quot;worth £400,000, Jock Stein must be worth four million pounds.&quot;

Stein advised commentator Archie Macpherson to make it publicly known that he would be interested in taking the job. Cussins, who had sacked Brian Clough after just 44 days in charge of Leeds in 1974, refused permission for the Scottish Football Association to speak to Stein. Cussins could not convince Stein to stay, however, and he resigned to accept the position of Scotland manager. Stein had been manager of Leeds for just 44 days, like Clough, although his tenure and departure had no bitterness or rancour.

===Scotland===
Stein was first appointed manager of Scotland on a part-time basis in the spring of 1965, taking charge of their attempt to qualify for the 1966 World Cup. Scotland achieved good results in their first two qualifiers, a draw against Poland and a win against Finland. Stein was criticised by the Scottish press after the team conceded two late goals and lost 2–1 at home to Poland, but they managed to beat Italy 1–0 at Hampden Park through a last minute goal by John Greig to raise some hope of qualification. Scotland suffered from several players withdrawing from the return match against Italy due to injury. Stein, by instinct an attacking coach, set his team up defensively. A 3–0 defeat meant that they failed to qualify from UEFA Group 8. Stein relinquished the Scotland job after this defeat to concentrate on his full-time role with Celtic.

After Willie Ormond resigned as manager of Scotland in May 1977, Stein was approached about replacing him, but confirmed that he intended to remain at Celtic. Amid overwhelming optimism incited by incumbent manager Ally MacLeod that Scotland would achieve great success at the 1978 FIFA World Cup, Stein was one of the few to caution against this: something he would be proven right in, as Scotland subsequently failed to qualify from the group stage.

Stein was appointed Scotland manager on a full-time basis on 5 October 1978, which was his 56th birthday. 65,872 attended his first game in charge, a 3–2 win against Norway at Hampden, despite the bus services in Glasgow being on strike. Stein had picked a team with only players based in England, but he felt that he could bring through more home-based players. He also believed that Scotland had tended to play with too much emotion and naivety, which he wanted to replace with an emphasis on retaining possession of the football. Two defeats to Belgium meant that Scotland failed to qualify for the 1980 European Championship. This was followed by losses to Northern Ireland and England in the 1980 British Home Championship, which led to some criticism in the media.

The Scots&#x27; form improved in their successful qualifying campaign for the 1982 FIFA World Cup, finishing top of their group and only losing once. Scotland travelled to Spain in the summer of 1982 in what would be the only occasion Stein would manage a side at the finals of major international tournament. Scotland swept into a 3–0 lead in their first group game against New Zealand, but then careless defending saw the Kiwis stage a comeback, scoring twice. Scotland added a further two goals near the end to restore their three-goal advantage, but concern was raised at the potential repercussions of the two New Zealand goals should goal difference become a factor.

Brazil were the next opponents, and Stein make a number of changes to his side. Danny McGrain and Kenny Dalglish were surprise omissions, while David Narey, Willie Miller and Steve Archibald came into the side. Graeme Souness took over the captaincy in McGrain&#x27;s absence. Narey gave Scotland a shock lead when he opened the scoring with a powerful right-foot strike. Zico equalised just before half-time from a free kick, and then Brazil took control in the second half, scoring three times to send Scotland crashing to a 4–1 defeat. The final group game paired Scotland against the Soviet Union. The teams were level on two points each, but the Soviets had a better goal difference and this meant Scotland had to win. Joe Jordan came into the team for his first appearance at the 1982 World Cup, and he gave Scotland the lead in the first half, but the Soviets rallied and scored twice in the second half. The second goal was particularly galling for the Scots, and came as a result of defenders Alan Hansen and Willie Miller colliding with one another, allowing Ramaz Shengelia a clear run in at goal to score. Souness netted a late equaliser for Scotland, but the game finished 2–2 and Scotland went out on goal difference. Stein commented after the final match: &quot;I am very disappointed we have not qualified. If we had played the way we did in any other section we would have gone through&quot;, adding &quot;We have proved we can compete at this level, if not win... Tonight I think we have done Scotland proud, both on and off the field.&quot;

Under Stein, Scotland began their qualifying campaign for the 1986 World Cup with a 3–0 win over Iceland at Hampden Park in October 1984. Paul McStay scored twice in the first half, and came close to getting a hat-trick when he struck the crossbar in the second half. Charlie Nicholas scored Scotland&#x27;s third goal. Stein observed that Scotland &quot;won with style&quot; and singled out winger Davie Cooper along with McStay for the flair they both displayed. The Scots turned in an even better showing in their next tie, a 3–1 home win over Spain. Two first half headed goals from Mo Johnston gave Scotland a 2–0 lead at half-time. Spain pulled a goal back in the second half, but with 18 minutes remaining Kenny Dalglish dribbled past three Spanish defenders before striking a powerful shot high into the net for Scotland&#x27;s third. It was Dalglish&#x27;s 30th international goal, equalling the national team record held by Denis Law, and it would also be Dalglish&#x27;s last. Stein described the win over Spain as &quot;the most satisfying since I became [Scotland] manager&quot;, adding that &quot;we scored three goals against a quality team that came to defend&quot;. Spanish manager Miguel Muñoz praised the Scots&#x27; performance, describing them as &quot;tremendous&quot;. Performances and results were more mixed in the later qualifying ties, losing the return match in Spain, going down to a 1–0 defeat against Wales in Glasgow and scraping a narrow 1–0 win over Iceland in Reykjavík. Scotland went into their last qualifying tie, away to Wales, needing at least a draw to secure a play-off spot.

==== Assistant and Colts manager ====

The Scottish International Committee made the surprise announcement of Stein in a dual role as Scotland under-23 team manager, also known as the &quot;Colts&quot;, and assistant to the Scotland national team on 17 February 1975. Both roles were assigned on a temporary basis. His appointment was made to take the strain off manager Willie Ormond. Stein accompanied Ormond for the Wales under-23s match on 25 February, but only to observe. Aberdeen manager Jimmy Bonthrone and Rangers assistant Willie Thornton were also in attendance. Stein did not officially inherit the &quot;Colts&quot; job from Ormond until April. Stein started as &quot;Colts&quot; manager with wins over Sweden under-23s in a friendly, and Leeds United in a challenge match. He then took charge of his only competitive match in charge. It was a UEFA under-23 Championship qualifier away at the Romania under-23s. Goals from Willie Pettigrew and Willie Young meant the team opened the campaign with a 2–1 win. Despite a three match winning streak, Stein relinquished both roles soon after, as he was hospitalised as the result of a car crash.

As national team boss, Stein was also responsible for the Scottish League XI side. He took charge on four occasions, which included one during his first spell in 1965, and a further three matches between 1978 and 1980, This included the last inter-league match involving the Scottish League XI, a 2–4 defeat by the Irish League XI at Windsor Park.

==Death==
On 10 September 1985, Scotland played Wales at Ninian Park, Cardiff, in a 1986 World Cup qualification match. Wales had been leading 1–0 by a Mark Hughes goal, before Scotland were awarded a penalty with 9 minutes left. Davie Cooper scored to make the score 1–1; the resulting draw secured a qualification play-off against Australia. Stein, who had been in poor health and under intense pressure, suffered a fatal pulmonary edema (fluid build-up in the lungs) at the end of the game – he had stopped taking prescribed medication for heart disease so his match preparations would not be disrupted by the side effects – and died shortly afterwards in the stadium&#x27;s medical room; he was 62 years old. Due to the circumstances, the cause of death has frequently been reported as a heart attack. Stein was cremated at Linn Crematorium in Glasgow, at a private ceremony at which many past and present football figures were in attendance.

His death had a profound effect on his assistant, and Aberdeen manager, Alex Ferguson, who regarded Stein as a mentor and was horrified by his sudden death. Ferguson was appointed interim manager and led the Scotland team to the 1986 World Cup, but they failed to progress beyond the group stage and Andy Roxburgh was appointed as Stein&#x27;s permanent successor.

==Tributes and legacy==
Jock Stein is widely acknowledged as one of the most influential managers in the history of British football. In contrast to his predecessors, he was actively involved in his players training – a &quot;tracksuit manager&quot;. And whereas training had previously consisted of mainly running around the track, he introduced practising with the ball into training. He is considered a football visionary; in particular for his time at Celtic where he transformed a side lacking direction and having gone almost eight years without a trophy into the best team in Europe, all whilst playing entertaining adventurous football. Prior to that, he had led Dunfermline Athletic to their first ever Scottish Cup final win. Furthermore, his man-management style and grasp of the psychological side of the game was years ahead of its time.

Stein was hugely respected by his peers and a massive influence on the next generation of managers who would follow in his footsteps; such as those who played under him like Billy McNeill, Kenny Dalglish, Graeme Souness, Alex McLeish, Gordon Strachan; and those who worked under him as coaches like Jim McLean, Walter Smith, Craig Brown and in particular Alex Ferguson.

Stein&#x27;s use of a free–flowing 4–4–2 formation and his relentless, highly offensive strategy with Celtic in the 1967 European Cup final victory over Inter Milan in Lisbon, which saw him overcome Helenio Herrera&#x27;s highly successful but more defensive–minded &quot;catenaccio&quot; tactical system, has also retroactively been compared by pundits to the similarly attacking–minded &quot;total football&quot; philosophy pioneered by Dutch manager Rinus Michels at Ajax during the 1970s. Due to their triumph, which saw them become the first Scottish and British side to win the European Cup title, the 1967 Celtic side were dubbed the &quot;Lisbon Lions&quot; in the press.

Since his death, Stein has been inducted into the Scottish Sports Hall of Fame and the Scottish Football Hall of Fame. When Celtic Park was rebuilt in the 1990s, the traditional Celtic fans&#x27; end of the stadium was named the Jock Stein Stand.

In 2002 Stein was voted the greatest ever Celtic manager by the club&#x27;s fans, and he was voted the greatest Scottish football manager in a 2003 poll by the &quot;Sunday Herald&quot; newspaper. A bust of Stein was presented to Celtic by a supporters&#x27; group and now sits in the foyer of the stadium.

On 5 March 2011, a greater than lifesize bronze statue of Stein, by the sculptor John McKenna, was unveiled outside Celtic Park. The statue depicts Stein holding the European Cup.
Celtic chairman John Reid said;

==Personal life==
He married Jeanie McAuley in 1946 and they were together until his death 39 years later. They had a son George and daughter Ray. Ray died of cancer on 9 September 2006 aged 59, and was outlived by her mother, who died on 2 August 2007 at the age of 80. George was living in Switzerland by the time of his father&#x27;s death.

<doc id="760694" wikidata="Q60121" url="?curid=760694" title="Polymer clay">
<text>Polymer clay is a type of hardenable modeling clay based on the polymer polyvinyl chloride (PVC). It typically contains no clay minerals, but like mineral clay a liquid is added to dry particles until it achieves gel-like working properties. Similarly, the part is put into an oven to harden, hence its colloquial designation as clay. Polymer clay is generally used for making arts and craft items, and is also used in commercial applications to make decorative parts. Art made from polymer clay can now be found in major museums.

==History==

Bakelite, an early plastic, was popular with designers and was an early form of polymer clay, but the phenol base of uncured Bakelite was flammable and was eventually discontinued. Polymer clays were first formulated as a possible replacement for Bakelite. One of these formulations was brought to the attention of German doll maker Käthe Kruse in 1939. While it was not suitable for use in her factory, Kruse gave some to her daughter Sophie, who was known in the family as &quot;Fifi&quot;, who successfully used it as modeling clay. The formulation was later sold to Eberhard Faber and marketed under the name &quot;FIMO&quot; (FIfi&#x27;s MOdeling compound).

==Composition==

Polymer clays contain a basis of PVC resin and a liquid plasticizer, making it a plastisol. Polymer clay plastisol is also categorized as a plastigel because of its rheological properties. It is a high yield thixotropic material: when a sufficient force is applied, the material yields, flowing like a viscous liquid until that force is removed, whereupon it returns to being a solid. This plasticity is what makes it useful as modeling clay as opposed to putty or paste. Plastigels retain their shape even when heat is applied, which is why polymer clay does not melt or droop when oven cured. Various gelling agents are added to give it this property, such as aminated bentonite, metallic soaps, or fumed silica.
The base resin can be modified in various ways. Mineral oil, lecithin, and odorless mineral spirits can be added to reduce its viscosity or alter its working properties. Small amounts of zinc oxide, kaolin, or other fillers are sometimes added to increase opacity, elastic modulus, or compression strength. Polymer clay is available in many colors, which can be mixed to create a wide range of colors or gradient blends. Special-effect colors and composites include translucent, fluorescent, phosphorescent, and faux &quot;pearls&quot;, &quot;metallics&quot;, and &quot;stone.&quot;

==Use==

Polymer clay remains workable until cured. Curing occurs at temperatures from to sustained for 15 minutes per of thickness. This temperature is significantly less than for mineral clays and can be achieved using a home oven. Professional polymer clay brands shrink very little when cured Brands of polymer clay include Cernit, Oytra, Fimo, Kato Polyclay, Sculpey, PVClay Brasil, Crafty Argentina and Cosclay.

A home pasta-making machine is a popular multi-purpose tool for polymer clay artists. It is used to create sheets of uniform thickness, to mix colors or create variegated sheets, and to condition (soften) the clay. Polymer clay generally needs to be conditioned before use. This involves kneading the clay by hand, passing it between two rollers, or using a low-shear mixer to break up any resin particle adhesions. Once conditioned, the clay will remain pliable until the particles eventually re-adhere.

Oven-hardenable PVC plastisol, &quot;liquid polymer clay,&quot; is a complement to polymer clay that can be used as an adhesive to combine pieces, or to create various effects. Pigments, chalk pastel, and regular polymer clay can be added to make colored liquid clay. The liquid can also be poured into molds to produce cast parts. 

==Health and safety==
Polymer clay safety is the subject of concern specifically regarding the long-term effects of exposure to certain phthalate plasticizers that have been classified as endocrine disruptors. When used as a toy or child care item, in the United States, it should not contain more than 0.1% of any of the six phthalates restricted or banned by the safety regulatory board according to the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act (CPSIA). These six phthalates are: DEHP (Di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate), DBP (Dibutyl phthalate), BBP (Benzyl butyl phthalate), DINP (Di-isononyl phthalate), DIDP (Di-isodecyl phthalate), and DnOP (Di-n-octyl phthalate). If the instructions on the package are followed (i.e. low temperatures and brief baking times) one will not burn the clay. If the clay does burn because of a mistake or if the oven malfunctions, a small amount of hydrogen chloride gas could be released, which may cause odor and some eye or nose irritation. The amount of hydrogen chloride gas released from the clay could cause a health problem.

Due to the testing requirements and regulations, clay products that would be used to hold or serve food or beverages are not recommended or intended for these applications. Plasticizers remain in the cured product and can leach out, making it a potential health hazard for both the modeler and end user. Restrictions on use of certain phthalates took effect in 2009 in both the European Union and United States. Not all phthalates pose a health hazard and some are approved for medical applications.

<text>The Daily Mirror was an afternoon paper established by Ezra Norton in Sydney, Australia in 1941, gaining a licence from the Minister for Trade and Customs, Eric Harrison, despite wartime paper rationing.

In October 1958, Norton and his partners sold his newspapers to the Fairfax Group, which immediately sold it to News Limited. It was merged with its morning sister paper &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; on 8 October 1990 to form &quot;The Daily Telegraph-Mirror&quot;, which in 1996 reverted to &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, in the process removing the last vestige of the old &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;.

Frank McGuinness, father of journalist P. P. McGuinness, also played a role in launching the newspaper. In 1941, McGuinness was controversially accused of conveying betting odds before the start of a race at Ascot.

Charles Buttrose, father of Ita Buttrose (launch editor of &quot;Cleo&quot;, editor of &quot;The Australian Women&#x27;s Weekly&quot; and current chair of the &quot;ABC&quot;), was a journalist on, and then the editor of, &quot;The Daily Mirror&quot;.

<text>Off theory is a bowling tactic in the sport of cricket. The term &quot;off theory&quot; is somewhat archaic and seldom used any more, but the basic tactic still plays a part in modern cricket.

Off theory involves concentrating the line of the bowling attack just outside the off stump. This area is often referred to as the &quot;corridor of uncertainty&quot;, as unless a batsman knows exactly where his off-stump is, he will have to play a shot at any ball bowled there. (Not to do so runs the risk that the ball will hit off-stump, which would not only get the batsman out but leave him looking extremely foolish.) The attack is supported with several fielders in a cordon of catching positions called slip fielders behind the wicket on the off side. The aim is to entice the batsman to play at the ball with the bat away from the body (&#x27;fishing outside off-stump&#x27;). This provides several ways in which the batsman can get out:
* Edging the ball off the outside edge of the bat to the waiting catchers.
* Edging the ball off the inside edge of the bat into the wicket.
* Missing the ball and having it pass between the bat and the leg pads on to the wicket (being bowled &quot;through the gate&quot;).

Originally developed in the late 19th century as an alternative to bowling directly at the wicket in an attempt to get batsmen out bowled or leg before wicket, off theory led to the rise in importance of slips and gully fielders as dedicated catching positions. The tactic has evolved until the modern day, in which the usual line of attack by fast bowlers is somewhat further outside off stump than it was typically in the 19th century.

Off theory - although not commonly known by that name now - has become the most common attacking bowling tactic used in cricket. It has thus developed many nuances and can be a ball-by-ball tactical struggle for supremacy between the bowler and batsman that many cricket fans find gripping when executed by a skilled bowler.

<text>Alan Charles Gilmore (born 1944 in Greymouth, New Zealand) is a New Zealand astronomer and a discoverer of minor planets and other astronomical objects.

He is credited by the Minor Planet Center with the discovery of 41 minor planets, all but one in collaboration with his wife Pamela M. Kilmartin. Both astronomers are also active nova- and comet-hunters.

Until their retirement in 2014, Gilmore and Kilmartin worked at Mount John University Observatory (Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Canterbury, Christchurch, New Zealand), where they continue to receive observing time. He is also a member of the Organizing Committee of IAU Commission 6, which oversees the dissemination of information and the assignment of credit for astronomical discoveries. The Commission still bears the name &quot;Astronomical Telegrams&quot;, even though telegrams are no longer used.

On 2007 August 30, Gilmore discovered his first periodic comet, P/2007 Q2.

The Eunomia asteroid 2537 Gilmore was named in his honor, while his wife is honored with the outer main-belt asteroid 3907 Kilmartin.

Gilmore talks on astronomy on the Radio New Zealand program &quot;Nights&#x27; Science&quot;. In May 2019 he and his wife were honored by New Zealand post with a stamp in its &quot;New Zealand Space Pioneers&quot; series.

<text>Camille Claudel is a 1988 French biographical drama film about the life of 19th-century sculptor Camille Claudel. The film was based on the book by Reine-Marie Paris, granddaughter of Camille&#x27;s brother, the poet and diplomat Paul Claudel. It was directed by Bruno Nuytten, co-produced by Isabelle Adjani, and starred her and Gérard Depardieu. The film had a total of 2,717,136 admissions in France. Adjani was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress for her role, the second in her career.

==Plot==
The film recounts the troubled life of French child prodigy sculptor Camille Claudel and her long relationship with the married sculptor Auguste Rodin. Claudel was the daughter of a devoutly Catholic, socialite mother and a wealthy French businessman. While the latter was sympathetic to her highly iconoclastic, secular art, her mother found it odious.

Beginning in the 1880s, with the young Claudel&#x27;s first meeting with Rodin, the film traces the development of their intense romantic bond. The growth of this relationship coincides with the rise of Claudel&#x27;s career as she overcomes prejudices against female artists.

However, their romance soon sours due to the increasing pressures of Rodin&#x27;s fame and his love for another woman. After Claudel&#x27;s father dies, she&#x27;s at the mercy of her mother&#x27;s ire. These difficulties combine with her increasing doubts about the value of her work, driving Claudel into emotional tumult.

While her zealot mother wants her institutionalized, her sympathetic brother tries to comfort her and promote her artwork. The film contributes to a broader exploration of mental illness in films, depicting Camille Claudel&#x27;s emotional tumult and the societal challenges she faced.

<doc id="760741" wikidata="Q5354975" url="?curid=760741" title="Electoral College (Pakistan)">
<text>The President of Pakistan is chosen by an electoral college (), in Pakistan. According to Article 41(3) of the Constitution of Pakistan, this electoral college consists of the Senate, the National Assembly of Pakistan, and the Provincial Assemblies of the four provinces. Members of the National Assembly and Provincial Assemblies are directly elected by the people in competitive multi-party elections. Members of the Senate are indirectly elected by the provincial assemblies, for a term of six years.

==Electoral system==
The President of Pakistan is indirectly elected by the Electoral College of Pakistan – a joint sitting of the Senate, National Assembly and Provincial Assemblies.

The votes of the members of the Senate and National Assembly are counted as single votes. Meanwhile, the votes given by the provincial assembly legislators are adjusted so as to give each province an equal share in the election. This is so because, each provincial assembly has a varying number of members, depending upon population size. The largest province by population size, Punjab, has a total of 371 members in its assembly, whereas the smallest province of Balochistan has a mere 65 members in its legislature. Therefore, the provincial votes are weighted against the Balochistan assembly in the following manner:

Regarding timing, the constitution states that election to the office of President must be held no earlier than sixty days and no later than thirty days before the expiration of the term of the incumbent president. If assemblies are not present, the constitution allows the election of president to be delayed thirty days after the general election.

The electoral process itself is done via a secret ballot due to the post of the president being constitutionally non-partisan. Therefore, unlike during the election of the Prime Minister, cross-party voting is not liable to be considered defection.

<text>Profane Existence is a Minneapolis-based anarcho-punk collective. Established in 1989, the collective publishes a nationally known zine (also called &quot;Profane Existence&quot;), as well as releasing and distributing anarcho-punk, crust, and grindcore music, and printing and publishing pamphlets and literature. Stacy Thompson describes the collective as &quot;the largest, longest-lasting, and most influential collective in Anarcho-Punk so far.&quot; The collective folded in 1998, although its distribution arm, then called Blackened Distribution, continued operating. It restarted in 2000. &quot;Making punk a threat again&quot; is the group&#x27;s slogan.

==History==

Launched in 1989, the &quot;Profane Existence&quot; magazine has been described as &quot;the largest of the anarchist Punk fanzines in North America.&quot; The magazine deals with a very broad range of topics, including veganism, animal, women&#x27;s and minority rights, anti-fascist action and the punk lifestyle. It published feature articles, interviews, reports on local scenes around the world, editorials, letters, &quot;how-to&quot; articles, and so on. Thompson writes that the zine &quot;functions as [a newspaper] for many Anarcho-Punks, especially those in the Twin Cities area.&quot; Until it ceased publication in 1998 &quot;Profane Existence&quot; was free in the Twin Cities and cost $1–3 elsewhere; then as now customers who order the zine through the mail are only charged for shipping. The zine was initially published in a black and white tabloid format. It switched to an 8½ x 11&quot; magazine format with issue #23 (Autumn 1994) but returned to a tabloid format (now with color front and back covers) with issue #38 (Spring 2000).

In 1992 the group co-published (with &quot;Maximum Rock n Roll&quot;) the first edition of &quot;Book Your Own Fuckin&#x27; Life&quot;, a directory (organized by region) of bands, distributors, venues, houses where &quot;touring bands or traveling punks could sleep and sometimes eat for free,&quot; etc.--what Thompson describes as a &quot;Yellow Pages of sorts&quot; for &quot;touring punk bands and punks in general.&quot;

Profane Existence Records, the collective&#x27;s record label, was also founded in 1989. One of the label&#x27;s first releases was &quot;Extinction,&quot; the seminal New York City crust punk band Nausea&#x27;s only full-length album, which John Griffin describes as &quot;as important to the punks of the &#x27;90s as The Sex Pistols&#x27; &quot;Never Mind the Bollocks&quot; was to the punks of the late &#x27;70s.&quot; Another notable early release was Asbestosdeath&#x27;s second 7&quot;, &quot;Dejection&quot;; Asbestosdeath&#x27;s members went on to form the metal bands Sleep, High on Fire, and Om. Throughout the early and mid-1990s, Profane Existence released or distributed records by many other crust bands, including Doom, Misery, Fleas and Lice, Anarcrust, Counterblast, Dirt, and Hellbastard. Thompson writes that the label &quot;became ground zero for [the crust] movement&quot; and that the aesthetic of second-wave (i.e., beginning in the late 1980s) anarcho-punk &quot;is currently exemplified by the bands released&quot; on the label. More recently, the label has released music by bands like Behind Enemy Lines, MURDER DISCO X, Iskra, and The Cooters. In 2009 they hosted independent crust radio shows, Scairt Radio, Doomed Society, Organize and Arise and others. This finished in 2012, where the magazine became an online magazine.

<text>A horse show is a judged exhibition of horses and ponies. Many different horse breeds and equestrian disciplines hold competitions worldwide, from local to the international levels. Most horse shows run from one to three days, sometimes longer for major, all-breed events or national and international championships. Most shows consist of a series of different performances, called &quot;classes&quot;, wherein a group of horses with similar training or characteristics compete against one another for awards and, often, prize money.

==International organizations and competitions==

There are several international disciplines run under rules established by the &quot;Fédération équestre internationale&quot; (FEI):
*Combined driving
*Dressage
*Endurance riding
*Eventing
*Para-equestrian
*Reining
*Show jumping
*Showmanship
*Tent pegging
*Vaulting
*Western Pleasure
The rules of the FEI govern competitions open to riders from all nations, including the Olympic games and the World Equestrian Games.

At the other end of the competition spectrum, Pony Club is an international movement that teaches young people riding skills suitable for English riding competitions. To help develop positive experience and good sportsmanship, Pony Clubs also sponsor horse shows open only to young people under the age of 18 and their horses. Various nations have similar programs for developing young equestrians, such as the 4-H program in the United States.

==Horse shows within various nations==

===Australia===

Horse shows in Australia are governed by Equestrian Australia (EA), Show Horse Council of Australia and different breed societies. Much of the development of the show horse discipline (also referred to as saddle horse) was developed over the last 40 years by Fran Cleland through her involvement with the Equestrian Federation of Australia&#x27;s (EFA) Victorian branch (now known as EV). Fran Cleland is the wife of Reg Cleland who was the longest serving Chairman of the Victorian branch of the EFA which was in turn responsible for running The Barastoc Horse of The Year Show the premier horse Show in Australia for over 40 years and under the direction of Fran Cleland introduced Newcomer, Show-hunter, leading rein, first ridden, owner rider and working Hunter classes into the Australian Show Horse scene.

===Canada===

The governing body for Equestrian activities in Canada is Equine Canada (EC).

===United Kingdom===

In the United Kingdom there is a distinct difference between &quot;horse competitions&quot; such as dressage or eventing and horse shows. Horse shows provide an opportunity for riders and owners to exhibit their animals without taking part in any of the Olympic disciplines. Classes are divided into ridden and in-hand sections and there are many different classes for different horses and ponies. For example, there are classes for mountain and moorland pony breeds, show hunters, show hacks, equitation, and show pony classes. Many clubs hold riding club classes, where a horse or pony must perform a short &quot;show&quot; (solo performance) and jump a single fence between 2 feet and 3 feet 3 inches. Most shows also include show jumping and working hunter sections.

The British Horse Society oversees many shows at national, regional and local level as does the Pony Club, the British Show Pony Society and the British Show Horse Association. Breed societies, particularly those related to the Welsh pony and Arabian horse, also organise their own shows. At local, unaffiliated level, riding clubs across Britain organise regular shows, which are often staffed by volunteers. The newly formed Showing Council is working towards officially overseeing all horse shows (non-FEI disciplines).

The Olympic equestrian disciplines are overseen by the British Equestrian Federation. There are several subdivisions. Dressage competitions are held separately from regular horse shows and are overseen by British Dressage, show jumping competitions are overseen by the British Showjumping Association (BSJA), and eventing is overseen by British Eventing.

===United States===

The United States Equestrian Federation is the American national body for equestrian sport and is also the recognized entity overseeing the Olympic-level United States Equestrian Team. It also organizes and sponsors horse shows for many horse breeds who wish to use the drug testing, judge certification and standardized rulemaking process of USEF. In addition, USEF sanctions events in disciplines and lower-level competitive areas that are not internationally recognized, such as show hunter and equitation. Other US organizations such as the National Cutting Horse Association, United States Eventing Association (USEA) and United States Dressage Federation (USDF) organize competitions for specific disciplines, such as cutting, and some breed organizations such as the American Quarter Horse Association sanction their own breed-specific shows.

Horse shows in the United States take several forms: Some are restricted to a particular breed, others are &quot;open&quot; or &quot;all-breed&quot; horse shows, which offer classes to all breeds as well as breed-specific classes for many different breeds. In the last few decades, American open horse shows have tended to become specialized by discipline into hunter-jumper or &quot;sport horse&quot; shows, dressage shows, and shows featuring English or Western riding events. However, there are still some multi-day, all-breed events that feature multiple breeds and disciplines.

== Types of competitions ==
There are a range of competitive equestrian events available and specific offerings range widely by nation and even by region within a given country. However, in North America, most horse shows provide the following range of classes:

English riding classes fall into two primary styles, hunt seat and saddle seat. &quot;Hunt type&quot; or sport horse classes include dressage, show jumping and show hunters, eventing (also called horse trials), and English pleasure or Hunter Under Saddle, also known as a &quot;flat&quot; class, where the event is judged on presentation, manners and rideability of the horse. &quot;Saddle seat&quot; or &quot;saddle type&quot; classes are all on the flat and are variations on English Pleasure, though the high action &quot;Park&quot; style classes differ because they emphasize brilliant trotting action. Equitation classes judge the form and ability of the rider.

Show jumping, eventing and dressage are sometimes called &quot;Olympic&quot; events, because they are the equestrian sports included in the Olympic Games.

Western or stock horse competition includes working cattle events, such as cutting, team penning and working cow horse in the United States, and campdrafting in Australia. They also include &quot;dry&quot; classes (without cattle) that include western pleasure, reining and equitation.

There are also specialized classes for draft horse showing, and a number of events for horses and ponies driven in harness, including Fine harness classes for saddle seat-type horses, Roadster classes that use equipment similar to that of harness racing, and the FEI-sanctioned sport of combined driving. Miniature horses also have their own shows with a number of specialized classes.

Most horse shows offer Halter classes, also called &quot;breeding&quot;, &quot;conformation&quot;, or &quot;in-hand&quot; classes. In these classes horses are led without saddles, not ridden, judging conformation and gaits. To train young equestrians in halter showing techniques, horse showmanship classes are offered. They are the halter equivalent of equitation because the handler, not the horse, is judged.

Classes may be broken down by the age of horse or rider, by the number of first place ribbons earned by horse or rider, and by size or breed of horse or pony. In addition, there are numerous other regional or specialty classes that may be offered. Various types of costume classes are frequently offered; sidesaddle classes are common; a &quot;leadline&quot; or &quot;walk-trot&quot; division may be offered for small children or very inexperienced riders; and assorted &quot;freestyle&quot; classes, where a horse and rider perform a routine set to music, are also popular.

Rodeos and horse pulling competitions are not technically horse shows, but they are competitive equestrian events, often with a great deal of prize money. Equestrian vaulting is not usually seen at ordinary horse shows, even though it is an FEI-recognized equestrian sport. Games, such as Gymkhana or O-Mok-See competition are usually held separately from ordinary horse shows, though a few of these &quot;speed&quot; events may be thrown in as &quot;fun classes&quot;, particularly at 4-H, Pony Club, and other small shows.

==Awards==
Prize money is sometimes awarded, particularly at larger competitions. The sum varies by the placing of the rider, the prestige of the show, and the difficulty of the class. Horse shows do not offer cash purses as large as in the Thoroughbred racing industry, though a few of the biggest show jumping, cutting and reining competitions may offer purse money into the low five figures. However, most show horses in the United States, especially those at the amateur levels, rarely win significant cash prizes during their show career. At best, a solid competitor might break even on entry fees and, if they are quite lucky, cover some travel expenses. Most money made from showing horses is indirectly earned by breeding fees paid for top horses, the sale of their offspring, or from the training fees paid to top trainers.

Trophies are usually awarded to the first place horse in a class, depending on the size of the show. In a championship event, trophies may be awarded to both the champion and the reserve champion, and at a national or international show trophies are sometimes given to the top five to ten competitors.

Other types of objects, such as dishes, trays, or plates, are sometimes given out as alternates to trophies.

Medals are given at international events such as the World Equestrian Games and the Olympics. Usually only three medals—gold, silver, and bronze—are awarded to the top three individuals or teams.

Rosettes or ribbons are often given for the top placings in a class. Often ribbons are given through the top six place entries, although some of the larger shows may award ribbons to the top ten. Ribbon color varies from country to country, as shown in the following chart.

Champion &amp; Reserve Champion ribbons are commonly called &quot;Tri-colors&quot;. They are usually a combination of the 1st, 2nd, &amp; 3rd place colors for Champion and 2nd, 3rd, &amp; 4th for Reserve Champion.

<text>HMS &quot;Lee&quot; was a 20-gun &quot;Cyrus&quot;-class sixth-rate post ship of the Royal Navy built in 1814 by Josiah and Thomas Brindley, nephews to Lord Nelson, at one of their three yards in Frindsbury in Kent.

The &quot;Lee&quot; was first commissioned in January 1815 under Captain James Bremer. Following the end of the Napoleonic Wars, in August 1815 Captain John Pasco was given command of HMS &quot;Lee&quot; and was employed in the English Channel for the suppression of smuggling. He remained her captain until &quot;Lee&quot; was paid off in September 1818. &quot;Lee&quot; was retained in ordinary for another four years before she was sold for breaking up in May 1822.

<doc id="760757" wikidata="Q39254" url="?curid=760757" title="Phalène">
<text>The Phalène (, &quot;moth-eared&quot;) is a toy dog breed, the drop eared variety of the Papillon (&quot;butterfly-eared&quot;) dog. Both varieties can occur in the same litter. 
== Appearance and behavior ==
The Phalène is an intelligent dog. They learn new tricks easily. They are sociable with the family but reserved around new people. They need to be socialized to get along well with other pets or they can be distrustful and exhibit aggressive tendencies toward other dogs and people. Phalènes are playful and affectionate. They are lap dogs and companion dogs. They have enough energy to keep up with active families, but can also be calm enough to live in an apartment. Due to their rather high energy level, they demand regular exercise routine, as other companion breeds. Papillons are known as good watchdogs and they will alert their owner to changes in their environment. They can be noisy like many other toy dogs. The Papillon can withstand heat but is more sensitive to cold temperatures because of their single-coated fur, and should not be left outside unattended in cold weather.

==History==


The Phalène is the earliest form of the Papillon; the appearance of the erect-eared variety was not documented until the 16th century. Belgium, France, Spain, and Italy have all been credited with the creation or development of Butterfly Dogs. The Papillon gained popularity after the turn of the nineteenth century. By the middle of the 20th century, the Papillon&#x27;s popularity had far outstripped that of the Phalène, which sank low enough into obscurity to become endangered. The breed had fanciers and did not slip into extinction. At some point the variety was named &quot;phalène&quot;, or ‘night moth’.

The 21st century has seen a revival of interest in the Phalène, with its fanciers pointing out that in countries where it is judged together with the Papillon, judges must be familiar enough with the breed standard to appreciate the qualities of a well-bred Phalène, and not confuse its dropped ears with those of a semi-erect eared Papillon, which would suggest a conformation fault.

==American Kennel Club==
The Phalène is considered a variant of the Papillon in the AKC, where they are registered as Papillons and shown and judged in the same classes. The breed standard is the same with the exception of the dropped ear, which does not sit as low on the head as that of other spaniel types. In nations where clubs follow the guidelines of the FCI, the Phalène is considered a separate breed.

<doc id="760771" wikidata="Q273394" url="?curid=760771" title="Béatrice Dalle">
<text>Béatrice Dalle (born 19 December 1964) is a French actress and model. She has appeared in over fifty films and is best known internationally for her debut role in the 1986 film &quot;37°2 le matin&quot; (also released as &quot;Betty Blue&quot;). Béatrice Dalle is renowned for her intense and unconventional roles, often portraying characters that are both provocative and transgressive.

==Biography==
Dalle was born in Brest, Finistère, France, as Béatrice Cabarrou. She grew up in Le Mans with her mother, father, and an older sister. At age 15, Dalle ran away from home to live in Paris. In 1985, she married the painter Jean-François Dalle, whom she divorced in 1988. In 2005, Dalle married an inmate she met while acting in a short film that was being shot in a prison. They divorced in 2015.

== Career ==
Dalle was working as a model when she met filmmaker Jean-Jacques Beineix. Beineix cast her in the lead role of the 1986 film &quot;37°2 le matin&quot; (released in the UK and USA as &quot;Betty Blue&quot;) which received BAFTA and Oscar nominations for Best Foreign Language Film, and made a star of Dalle.

She went on to appear in a series of major roles in French films, including the 1989 film &quot;Chimère&quot;, which was entered into the 1989 Cannes Film Festival.

She featured in the 1987 music video for Buster Poindexter&#x27;s version of &quot;Oh Me Oh My (I&#x27;m fool for you Baby)&quot; and in the 1991 music video for &quot;Move to Memphis&quot; by Norwegian band a-ha.

She starred in Jim Jarmusch&#x27;s &quot;Night on Earth&quot; in 1991. In 1997, she was cast in &quot;The Blackout&quot;, her first film made in the United States.

In 2001, Dalle appeared in the controversial film &quot;Trouble Every Day&quot;, in which she played a vampire. She starred in the 2007 film &quot;À l&#x27;intérieur&quot;, in which she played a cruel psychopath stalking a pregnant woman.

In 1988, Dalle was interviewed by Clive James in &quot;Postcard from Paris&quot; where she said she was tired of Paris and wanted to move to New York.

===Controversies===
Dalle has been arrested on several occasions for shoplifting, drug possession and assault. In January 2005, while making a film about prison life in Brest, Dalle met Guenaël Meziani, serving a 12-year prison sentence for assaulting and raping his ex-girlfriend. She married him after 24 one-hour visits, and spoke on his behalf at hearings for his early release. According to a 2015 profile of Dalle, she said the marriage was &quot;a complete disaster&quot; once Meziani was released from prison, and their divorce was apparently finalised in July 2014.

Interviewed on the French TV programme &quot;Divan&quot; in 2016, Dalle stated that when she used to work in a morgue with her friends, they sold body parts of corpses, and while on acid, they ate a dead man&#x27;s ear.

<doc id="760776" wikidata="Q1379246" url="?curid=760776" title="History of the British Isles">
<text>The history of the British Isles began with its sporadic human habitation during the Palaeolithic from around 900,000 years ago. The British Isles has been continually occupied since the early Holocene, the current geological epoch, which started around 11,700 years ago. Mesolithic hunter-gatherers migrated from the Continent soon afterwards at a time when there was no sea barrier between Britain and Europe, but there was between Britain and Ireland. There were almost complete population replacements by migrations from the Continent at the start of the Neolithic around 4,100 BC and the Bronze Age around 2,500 BC. Later migrations contributed to the political and cultural fabric of the islands and the transition from tribal societies to feudal ones at different times in different regions.

England and Scotland were sovereign kingdoms until 1603, and then legally separate under one monarch until 1707, when they united as one kingdom. Wales and Ireland were composed of several independent kingdoms with shifting boundaries until the medieval period.

The British monarch was head of state of all of the countries of the British Isles from the Union of the Crowns in 1603 until the enactment of the Republic of Ireland Act in 1949.

==Prehistoric==
===Palaeolithic and Mesolithic periods===
The Palaeolithic and Mesolithic, also known as the Old and Middle Stone Ages, were characterised by a hunter-gatherer society and a reliance on stone tool technologies.

====Palaeolithic====
The Lower Palaeolithic period in the British Isles saw the region&#x27;s first known habitation by early hominids, specifically the extinct Homo heidelbergensis. This period saw many changes in the environment, encompassing several glacial and interglacial episodes greatly affecting human settlement in the region. Providing dating for this distant period is difficult and contentious. The inhabitants of the region at this time were bands of hunter-gatherers who roamed Northern Europe following herds of animals, or who supported themselves by fishing. One of the most prominent archaeological sites dating to this period is that of Boxgrove Quarry in West Sussex, southern England.

====Mesolithic (10,000 to 4,500 BC)====
By the Mesolithic, &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;, or modern humans, were the only hominid species to still survive in the British Isles. There was then limited occupation by Ahrensburgian hunter gatherers, but this came to an end when there was a final downturn in temperature which lasted from around 9,400 to 9,200 BC. Mesolithic people occupied Britain by around 9,000 BC, and it has been occupied ever since. By 8000 BC temperatures were higher than today, and birch woodlands spread rapidly, but there was a cold spell around 6,200 BC which lasted about 150 years. The British Isles were linked to continental Europe by a territory named Doggerland. The plains of Doggerland were thought to have finally been submerged around 6500 to 6000 BC, but recent evidence suggests that the bridge may have lasted until between 5800 and 5400 BC, and possibly as late as 3800 BC.

===Neolithic (4500 to 2500 BC)===
Around 4000 BC migrants began arriving from central Europe. Although the earliest indisputably acknowledged languages spoken in the British Isles belonged to the Celtic branch of the Indo-European family it is not known what language these early farming people spoke. These migrants brought new ideas, leading to a radical transformation of society and landscape that has been called the Neolithic Revolution. The Neolithic period in the British Isles was characterised by the adoption of agriculture and sedentary living. To make room for the new farmland, these early agricultural communities undertook mass deforestation across the islands, dramatically and permanently transforming the landscape. At the same time, new types of stone tools requiring more skill began to be produced; new technologies included polishing.

The Neolithic also saw the construction of a wide variety of monuments in the landscape, many of which were megalithic in nature. The earliest of these are the chambered tombs of the Early Neolithic, although in the Late Neolithic this form of monumentalisation was replaced by the construction of stone circles, a trend that would continue into the following Bronze Age. These constructions are taken to reflect ideological changes, with new ideas about religion, ritual and social hierarchy.

===Bronze Age (2500 to 600 BC)===
In the British Isles, the Bronze Age saw the transformation of British and Irish society and landscape. It saw the adoption of agriculture, as communities gave up their hunter-gatherer modes of existence to begin farming. During the British Bronze Age, large megalithic monuments similar to those from the Late Neolithic continued to be constructed or modified, including such sites as Avebury, Stonehenge, Silbury Hill and Must Farm. This has been described as a time &quot;when elaborate ceremonial practices emerged among some communities of subsistence agriculturalists of western Europe&quot;.

===Iron Age (1200 BC to 600 AD)===

As its name suggests, the British Iron Age is also characterised by the adoption of iron, a metal which was used to produce a variety of different tools, ornaments and weapons.

In the course of the first millennium BC, and possibly earlier, some combination of trans-cultural diffusion and immigration from continental Europe resulted in the establishment of Celtic languages in the islands, eventually giving rise to the Insular Celtic group. What languages were spoken in the islands before is unknown, though they are assumed to have been Pre-Indo-European.

==Classical period==
In 55 and 54 BC, the Roman general Gaius Julius Caesar launched two separate invasions of the British Isles, though neither resulted in a full Roman occupation of the island. In 43 AD, southern Britain became part of the Roman Empire. On Nero&#x27;s accession Roman Britain extended as far north as Lindum (Lincoln). Gaius Suetonius Paulinus, the conqueror of Mauretania (modern-day Algeria and Morocco), then became governor of Britain, where he spent most of his governorship campaigning in Wales. Eventually in 60 AD he penned up the last resistance and the last of the druids in the island of Mona (Anglesey). Paulinus led his army across the Menai Strait and massacred the druids and burnt their sacred groves. At the moment of triumph, news came of the Boudican revolt in East Anglia.

The suppression of the Boudican revolt was followed by a period of expansion of the Roman province, including the subjugation of south Wales. Between 77 and 83 AD the new governor Gnaeus Julius Agricola led a series of campaigns which enlarged the province significantly, taking in north Wales, northern Britain, and most of Caledonia (Scotland). The Celts fought with determination and resilience, but faced a superior, professional army, and it is likely that between 100,000 and 250,000 may have perished in the conquest period.

==Medieval period==
===Early medieval===

The early medieval period saw a series of invasions of Britain by the Germanic-speaking Saxons, beginning in the 5th century. Anglo-Saxon kingdoms were formed and, through wars with British states, gradually came to cover the territory of present-day England. Scotland was divided between the Picts, Dál Riata, the Kingdom of Strathclyde and the Angles. Around 600, seven principal kingdoms had emerged, beginning the so-called period of the Heptarchy. During that period, the Anglo-Saxon states were Christianised (the conversion of the British ones had begun much earlier).

In the 9th century, Vikings from Scandinavia conquered most of England and the Scots and Picts were combined to form the Kingdom of Alba. Only the Kingdom of Wessex under Alfred the Great survived and even managed to re-conquer and unify England for much of the 10th century, before a new series of Danish raids in the late 10th century and early 11th century culminated in the wholesale subjugation of England to Denmark under Sweyn Forkbeard and Canute the Great. Danish rule was overthrown and the local House of Wessex was restored to power under Edward the Confessor for about two decades until his death in 1066.

===Late Medieval===

In 1066, William, Duke of Normandy claimed the English throne and invaded England. He defeated King Harold Godwinson at the Battle of Hastings. Proclaiming himself to be King William I, he strengthened his regime by appointing loyal members of the Norman elite to many positions of authority, building a system of castles across the country and ordering a census of his new kingdom, the Domesday Book. The Late Medieval period was characterized by many battles between England and France, coming to a head in the Hundred Years&#x27; War from which France emerged victorious. The English monarchs throughout the Late Medieval period belonged to the houses of Plantagenet, Lancaster, and York.

Under John Balliol, in 1295, Scotland entered into the Auld Alliance with France. In 1296, England invaded Scotland, but in the following year William Wallace defeated the English army at the Battle of Stirling Bridge. However, King Edward I of England came north to defeat Wallace himself at the Battle of Falkirk. In 1320, the Declaration of Arbroath, seen as an important document in the development of Scottish national identity, led to the recognition of Scottish independence by major European dynasties. In 1328, the Treaty of Edinburgh-Northampton with England recognised Scottish independence under Robert the Bruce.

==Early modern period==
Major historical events in the early modern period include the English Renaissance, the English Reformation and Scottish Reformation, the English Civil War, the Restoration of Charles II, the Glorious Revolution, the Treaty of Union, the Scottish Enlightenment and the formation of the First British Empire.

==19th century==
===1801 to 1837===
====Union of Great Britain and Ireland====
The Kingdom of Ireland was a settler state; the monarch was the incumbent monarch of England and later of Great Britain. The Lord Lieutenant of Ireland headed the government on behalf of the monarch. He was assisted by the Chief Secretary of Ireland. Both were responsible to the government in London rather than to the Parliament of Ireland. Before the Constitution of 1782, the Irish parliament was also severely fettered, and decisions in Irish courts could be overturned on appeal to the British House of Lords in London.

The Anglo-Irish ruling class gained a degree of independence in the 1780s thanks to Henry Grattan. During this time the effects of the penal laws on the primarily Roman Catholic population were reduced, and some property-owning Catholics were granted the franchise in 1794; however, they were still excluded from becoming members of the Irish House of Commons. This brief period of limited independence came to an end following the Irish Rebellion of 1798, which occurred during the British war with revolutionary France. The British government&#x27;s fear of an independent Ireland siding against them with the French resulted in the decision to unite the two countries. This was brought about by legislation in the parliaments of both kingdoms and came into effect on 1 January 1801. The Irish had been led to believe by the British that their loss of legislative independence would be compensated for with Catholic Emancipation, i.e. by the removal of civil disabilities placed upon Roman Catholics in both Great Britain and Ireland. However, King George III was bitterly opposed to any such Emancipation and succeeded in defeating his government&#x27;s attempts to introduce it.

====Napoleonic Wars====

During the War of the Second Coalition (1799–1801), William Pitt the Younger (1759–1806) provided strong leadership in London. Britain occupied most of the French and Dutch overseas possessions, the Netherlands having become a satellite state of France in 1796. After a short peace, in May 1803, war was declared again. Napoleon&#x27;s plans to invade Britain failed, chiefly due to the inferiority of his navy. In 1805 Lord Nelson&#x27;s fleet decisively defeated the French and Spanish at Trafalgar, ending any hopes Napoleon had to wrest control of the oceans away from the British.
The British Army remained a minimal threat to France; it maintained a standing strength of just 220,000 men at the height of the Napoleonic Wars, whereas France&#x27;s armies exceeded a million men—in addition to the armies of numerous allies and several hundred thousand national guardsmen that Napoleon could draft into the French armies when they were needed. Although the Royal Navy effectively disrupted France&#x27;s extra-continental trade—both by seizing and threatening French shipping and by seizing French colonial possessions—it could do nothing about France&#x27;s trade with the major continental economies and posed little threat to French territory in Europe. France&#x27;s population and agricultural capacity far outstripped that of Britain.

In 1806, Napoleon set up the Continental System to end British trade with French-controlled territories. However Britain had great industrial capacity and mastery of the seas. It built up economic strength through trade and the Continental System was largely ineffective. As Napoleon realized that extensive trade was going through Spain and Russia, he invaded those two countries. He tied down his forces in Spain, and lost very badly in Russia in 1812. The Spanish uprising in 1808 at last permitted Britain to gain a foothold on the Continent. The Duke of Wellington and his army of British and Portuguese gradually pushed the French out of Spain, and in early 1814, as Napoleon was being driven back in the east by the Prussians, Austrians, and Russians, Wellington invaded southern France. After Napoleon&#x27;s surrender and exile to the island of Elba, peace appeared to have returned, but when he escaped back into France in 1815, the British and their allies had to fight him again. The armies of Wellington and Blucher defeated Napoleon once and for all at Waterloo.
Simultaneous with the Napoleonic Wars, trade disputes and British impressment of American sailors led to the War of 1812 with the United States. A central event in American history, it was little noticed in Britain, where all attention was focused on the struggle with France. The British could devote few resources to the conflict until the fall of Napoleon in 1814. American frigates also inflicted a series of embarrassing defeats on the British navy, which was short on manpower due to the conflict in Europe. The Duke of Wellington argued that an outright victory over the U.S. was impossible because the Americans controlled the western Great Lakes and had destroyed the power of Britain&#x27;s Indian allies. A full-scale British invasion was defeated in upstate New York. Peace was agreed to at the end of 1814, but unaware of this, Andrew Jackson won a great victory over the British at the Battle of New Orleans in January 1815 (news took several weeks to cross the Atlantic before the advent of steam ships). The Treaty of Ghent subsequently ended the war with no territorial changes. It was the last war between Britain and the United States.

====George IV and William IV====
Britain emerged from the Napoleonic Wars a very different country than it had been in 1793. As industrialisation progressed, society changed, becoming more urban and less rural. The postwar period saw an economic slump, and poor harvests and inflation caused widespread social unrest. Europe after 1815 was on guard against a return of Jacobinism, and even liberal Britain saw the passage of the Six Acts in 1819, which proscribed radical activities. By the end of the 1820s, along with a general economic recovery, many of these repressive laws were repealed and in 1828 new legislation guaranteed the civil rights of religious dissenters.

A weak ruler as regent (1811–1820) and king (1820–1830), George IV let his ministers take full charge of government affairs, playing a far lesser role than his father, George III. His governments, with little help from the king, presided over victory in the Napoleonic Wars, negotiated the peace settlement, and attempted to deal with the social and economic malaise that followed. His brother William IV ruled (1830–37), but was little involved in politics. His reign saw several reforms: the poor law was updated, child labour was restricted, slavery was abolished in nearly all the British Empire, and, most important, the Reform Act 1832 refashioned the British electoral system.

There were no major wars until the Crimean War (1853–1856). While Prussia, Austria, and Russia, as absolute monarchies, tried to suppress liberalism wherever it might occur, the British came to terms with new ideas. Britain intervened in Portugal in 1826 to defend a constitutional government there and recognising the independence of Spain&#x27;s American colonies in 1824. British merchants and financiers, and later railway builders, played major roles in the economies of most Latin American nations.

====Whig reforms of the 1830s====
The Whig Party recovered its strength and unity by supporting moral reforms, especially the reform of the electoral system, the abolition of slavery and emancipation of the Catholics. Catholic emancipation was secured in the Catholic Relief Act 1829, which removed the most substantial restrictions on Roman Catholics in Great Britain and Ireland.

The Whigs became champions of Parliamentary reform. They made Lord Grey prime minister 1830–1834, and the Reform Act 1832 became their signature measure. It broadened the franchise and ended the system of &quot;rotten borough&quot; and &quot;pocket boroughs&quot; (where elections were controlled by powerful families), and instead redistributed power on the basis of population. It added 217,000 voters to an electorate of 435,000 in England and Wales. The main effect of the act was to weaken the power of the landed gentry, and enlarge the power of the professional and business middle-class, which now for the first time had a significant voice in Parliament. However, the great majority of manual workers, clerks, and farmers did not have enough property to qualify to vote. The aristocracy continued to dominate the government, the Army and Royal Navy, and high society. After parliamentary investigations demonstrated the horrors of child labour, limited reforms were passed in 1833.

Chartism emerged after the 1832 Reform Bill failed to give the vote to the working class. Activists denounced the &quot;betrayal&quot; of the working classes and the &quot;sacrificing&quot; of their &quot;interests&quot; by the &quot;misconduct&quot; of the government. In 1838, Chartists issued the People&#x27;s Charter demanding manhood suffrage, equal sized election districts, voting by ballots, payment of Members of Parliament (so that poor men could serve), annual Parliaments, and abolition of property requirements. The ruling class saw the movement as dangerous, so the Chartists were unable to force serious constitutional debate. Historians see Chartism as both a continuation of the 18th century fight against corruption and as a new stage in demands for democracy in an industrial society. In 1832 Parliament abolished slavery in the Empire with the Slavery Abolition Act 1833. The government purchased the slaves for £20,000,000 (the money went to rich plantation owners who mostly lived in England), and freed the slaves, especially those in the Caribbean sugar islands.

====Leadership====
Prime Ministers of the period included: William Pitt the Younger, Lord Grenville, Duke of Portland, Spencer Perceval, Lord Liverpool, George Canning, Lord Goderich, Duke of Wellington, Lord Grey, Lord Melbourne, and Sir Robert Peel.

===Victorian era===
The Victorian era was the period of Queen Victoria&#x27;s rule between 1837 and 1901 which signified the height of the British Industrial Revolution and the apex of the British Empire. Scholars debate whether the Victorian period—as defined by a variety of sensibilities and political concerns that have come to be associated with the Victorians—actually begins with the passage of the Reform Act 1832. The era was preceded by the Regency era and succeeded by the Edwardian period. Victoria became queen in 1837 at age 18. Her long reign saw Britain reach the zenith of its economic and political power, with the introduction of steam ships, railroads, photography, and the telegraph. Britain again remained mostly inactive in Continental politics.

====Free trade imperialism====
The Great London Exhibition of 1851 clearly demonstrated Britain&#x27;s dominance in engineering and industry; that lasted until the rise of the United States and Germany in the 1890s. Using the imperial tools of free trade and financial investment, it exerted major influence on many countries outside Europe, especially in Latin America and Asia. Thus Britain had both a formal Empire based on British rule as well as an informal one based on the British pound.

====Russia, France and the Ottoman Empire====
One nagging fear was the possible collapse of the Ottoman Empire. It was well understood that a collapse of that country would set off a scramble for its territory and possibly plunge Britain into war. To head that off Britain sought to keep the Russians from occupying Constantinople and taking over the Bosporous Strait, as well as from threatening India via Afghanistan. In 1853, Britain and France intervened in the Crimean War against Russia. Despite mediocre generalship, they managed to capture the Russian port of Sevastopol, compelling Tsar Nicholas I to ask for peace. It was a frustrating war with very high casualty rates—the iconic hero was Florence Nightingale.

The next Russo-Ottoman war in 1877 led to another European intervention, although this time at the negotiating table. The Congress of Berlin blocked Russia from imposing the harsh Treaty of San Stefano on the Ottoman Empire. Despite its alliance with the French in the Crimean War, Britain viewed the Second Empire of Napoleon III with some distrust, especially as the emperor constructed ironclad warships and began returning France to a more active foreign policy.

====American Civil War====
During the American Civil War (1861–1865), British leaders favoured the Confederacy, a major source of cotton for textile mills. Prince Albert was effective in defusing a war scare in late 1861. The British people, however, who depended heavily on American food imports, generally favoured the Union. What little cotton was available came from New York, as the blockade by the US Navy shut down 95% of Southern exports to Britain. In September 1862, Abraham Lincoln announced the Emancipation Proclamation. Since support of the Confederacy now meant supporting the institution of slavery, there was no possibility of European intervention. The British sold arms to both sides, built blockade runners for a lucrative trade with the Confederacy, and surreptitiously allowed warships to be built for the Confederacy. The warships caused a major diplomatic row that was resolved in the Alabama Claims in 1872, in the Americans&#x27; favour.

====Empire expands====
In 1867, Britain united most of its North American colonies as Canada, giving it self-government and responsibility for its own defence, but Canada did not have an independent foreign policy until 1931. Several of the colonies temporarily refused to join the Dominion despite pressure from both Canada and Britain; the last one, Newfoundland, held out until 1949. The second half of the 19th century saw a huge expansion of Britain&#x27;s colonial empire, mostly in Africa. A talk of the Union Jack flying &quot;from Cairo to Cape Town&quot; only became a reality at the end of the Great War. Having possessions on six continents, Britain had to defend all of its empire and did so with a volunteer army, the only great power in Europe to have no conscription. Some questioned whether the country was overstretched.

The rise of the German Empire since its creation in 1871 posed a new challenge, for it (along with the United States), threatened to usurp Britain&#x27;s place as the world&#x27;s foremost industrial power. Germany acquired a number of colonies in Africa and the Pacific, but Chancellor Otto von Bismarck succeeded in achieving general peace through his balance of power strategy. When William II became emperor in 1888, he discarded Bismarck, began using bellicose language, and planned to build a navy to rival Britain&#x27;s.

Ever since Britain had wrested control of the Cape Colony from the Netherlands during the Napoleonic Wars, it had co-existed with Dutch settlers who had migrated further away from the Cape and created two republics of their own. The British imperial vision called for control over these new countries, and the Dutch-speaking &quot;Boers&quot; (or &quot;Afrikaners&quot;) fought back in the War in 1899–1902. Outgunned by a mighty empire, the Boers waged a guerrilla war (which certain other British territories would later employ to attain independence). This gave the British regulars a difficult fight, but their weight of numbers, superior equipment, and often brutal tactics, eventually brought about a British victory. The war had been costly in human rights and was widely criticised by Liberals in Britain and worldwide. However, the United States gave its support. The Boer republics were merged into the Union of South Africa in 1910; this had internal self-government, but its foreign policy was controlled by London and it was an integral part of the British Empire.

====Ireland and the move to Home Rule====

Part of the agreement which led to the 1800 Act of Union stipulated that the Penal Laws in Ireland were to be repealed and Catholic emancipation granted. However King George III blocked emancipation, arguing that to grant it would break his coronation oath to defend the Anglican Church. A campaign by the lawyer Daniel O&#x27;Connell, and the death of George III, led to the concession of Catholic Emancipation in 1829, allowing Roman Catholics to sit in the Parliament of the United Kingdom. But Catholic Emancipation was not O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s ultimate goal, which was Repeal of the Act of Union with Great Britain. On 1 January 1843 O&#x27;Connell confidently, but wrongly, declared that Repeal would be achieved that year. When potato blight hit the island in 1846, much of the rural population was left without food, because cash crops were being exported to pay rents.

British politicians such as the Prime Minister Robert Peel were at this time wedded to the economic policy of laissez-faire, which argued against state intervention. While funds were raised by private individuals and charities, lack of adequate action let the problem become a catastrophe. Cottiers (or farm labourers) were largely wiped out during what is known in Ireland as the &quot;Great Hunger&quot;. A significant minority elected Unionists, who championed the Union. A Church of Ireland former Tory barrister turned nationalist campaigner, Isaac Butt, established a new moderate nationalist movement, the Home Rule League, in the 1870s. After Butt&#x27;s death the Home Rule Movement, or the Irish Parliamentary Party as it had become known, was turned into a major political force under the guidance of William Shaw and a radical young Protestant landowner, Charles Stewart Parnell.

Parnell&#x27;s movement campaigned for &quot;Home Rule&quot;, by which they meant that Ireland would govern itself as a region within Great Britain. Two Home Rule Bills (1886 and 1893) were introduced by Liberal Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone, but neither became law, mainly due to opposition from the Conservative Party and the House of Lords. The issue was a source of contention throughout Ireland, as a significant majority of Unionists (largely based in Ulster), opposed Home Rule, fearing that a Catholic Nationalist (&quot;Rome Rule&quot;) Parliament in Dublin would discriminate against them, impose Roman Catholic doctrine, and impose tariffs on industry. While most of Ireland was primarily agricultural, six of the counties in Ulster were the location of heavy industry and would be affected by any tariff barriers imposed.

==20th century to present==
===1900–1945===
Queen Victoria, who had reigned since 1837, died in 1901 and was succeeded by her son, Edward VII, who, in turn, was succeeded by his son, George V, when he died in 1910. The British Empire flourished but there was a bitterly fought Second Boer War in South Africa. In 1914, Britain entered the First World War by declaring war on Germany. Nearly a million Britons were killed in the war, which lasted until Germany&#x27;s surrender on 11 November 1918.

Home Rule in Ireland, which had been a major political issue since the late 19th century but put on hold by the war, was somewhat resolved after the Irish War of Independence brought the British Government to a stalemate in 1922. Negotiations led to the formation of the Irish Free State. However, in order to appease Unionists in the north, the north-eastern six counties remained as part of the U.K., forming Northern Ireland with its own Parliament at Stormont in Belfast.

Liberals were in power for much of the early 20th century under Prime Ministers Campbell-Bannerman, Asquith and Lloyd George. After 1914, the Liberal party suffered a sharp decline. The new Labour party, whose leader Ramsay MacDonald led two minority governments, swiftly became the Conservatives&#x27; main opposition, and Britain&#x27;s largest party of the left.

King Edward VIII succeeded his father George V in January 1936, but was not allowed by the government to marry Wallis Simpson, a divorcee. In December, he abdicated in order to marry Simpson. His brother George VI was crowned king.

In order to avoid another European conflict, Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain attempted to appease German Chancellor Adolf Hitler, who was expanding his country&#x27;s territory across Central Europe. Despite proclaiming that he has achieved &quot;peace for our time&quot;, Britain declared war on Germany on 3 September 1939, following Hitler&#x27;s invasion of Poland two days earlier. The U.K. thus joined the Allied forces in opposition to the Axis forces of Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy. For the first time, civilians were not exempt from the war, as London suffered nightly bombings during the Blitz. Much of London was destroyed, with 1,400,245 buildings destroyed or damaged. The only part of the British Isles to be occupied by enemy forces were the Channel Islands. At the war&#x27;s end in 1945, however, the U.K. emerged as one of the victorious nations.

===1945–1997===
Winston Churchill, who had been leader of the wartime coalition government, suffered a surprising landslide defeat to Clement Attlee&#x27;s Labour party in 1945 elections. Attlee created a Welfare State in Britain, which most notably provided free healthcare under the National Health Service.

On the international stage, the second half of the 20th century was dominated by the Cold War between the Soviet Union and its socialist allies and the United States and its capitalist allies; the U.K. was a key supporter of the latter, joining the anti-Soviet military alliance NATO in 1949. During this period, the U.K. fought in the Korean War (1950–1953). The Cold War shaped world affairs until victory was achieved in 1989. The major parties largely agreed on foreign and domestic policy—except nationalization of some industries—in an era of Post-war consensus that lasted into the 1970s.

In 1951, Churchill and the Tories returned to power; they would govern uninterrupted for the next 13 years. King George VI died in 1952, and was succeeded by his eldest daughter, Elizabeth II, who reigned until her death on 8 September 2022. Churchill was succeeded in 1955 by Sir Anthony Eden, whose premiership was ruined by the Suez Crisis, in which Britain, France and Israel plotted to attack Egypt after its President Nasser nationalised the Suez Canal. Eden&#x27;s successor, Harold Macmillan, split the Conservatives when Britain applied to join the European Economic Community, but French President Charles de Gaulle vetoed the application.

Labour returned to power in 1964 under Harold Wilson, who brought in a number of social reforms, including the legalisation of abortion, the abolition of capital punishment and the decriminalisation of homosexuality. In 1973, Conservative Prime Minister Edward Heath succeeded in securing U.K. membership in the European Economic Community (EEC), what would later become known as the European Union. Wilson, having lost the 1970 election to Heath, returned to power in 1974; however, Labour&#x27;s reputation was harmed by the winter of discontent of 1978-9 under Jim Callaghan, which enabled the Conservatives to re-take control of Parliament in 1979, under Margaret Thatcher, Britain&#x27;s first female prime minister.

Although Thatcher&#x27;s economic reforms made her initially unpopular, her decision in 1982 to retake the Falkland Islands from invading Argentine forces, in the Falklands War, changed her fortunes and enabled a landslide victory in 1983. After winning an unprecedented third election in 1987, however, Thatcher&#x27;s popularity began to fade and she was replaced by her chancellor John Major in 1990.

Tensions between Protestants and Catholics in Northern Ireland came to a head in the late 1960s, when nationalist participants in a civil rights march were shot by members of the B Specials, a reserve police force manned almost exclusively by unionists. From this point the Provisional Irish Republican Army, also known as the Provos or simply the IRA, began a bombing campaign throughout the U.K., beginning a period known as The Troubles, which lasted until the late 1990s.

Prince Charles, the Prince of Wales and Elizabeth&#x27;s eldest son married Lady Diana Spencer in 1981; the couple had two children, William and Harry, but divorced in 1992, during which year Prince Andrew and Princess Anne also separated from their spouses, leading the Queen to call the year her &#x27;annus horribilis&#x27;. In 1997, Diana was killed in a car crash in Paris, leading to a mass outpouring of grief across the United Kingdom, and indeed the world.

===1997–present===
In 1997, Tony Blair was elected prime minister in a landslide victory for the so-called &#x27;New Labour&#x27;, economically following &#x27;Third Way&#x27; programmes. Blair won re-election in 2001 and 2005, before handing over power to his chancellor Gordon Brown in 2007. After a decade of prosperity both the U.K. and the Republic of Ireland were affected by the global recession, which began in 2008. In 2010, the Conservative party formed a coalition government with the Liberal Democrats, with Tory leader David Cameron as prime minister. In 2014, a referendum was held in Scotland on Scottish independence; the Scottish electorate voted to remain within the United Kingdom. In 2015 polling suggested a hung parliament was the most likely outcome in the General Election; however the Conservatives secured a slim majority.

After the September 11 Attacks, the U.K. supported the U.S. in their &quot;War on Terror&quot;, and joined them in the War in Afghanistan (2001–2021) and the invasion of Iraq. London was attacked in July 2005. The U.K. also took a leading role in the 2011 military intervention in Libya. In a referendum in 2016, the UK voted to leave the European Union, which was done 31 January 2020. Negotiations between the UK and Ireland culminated in the controversial, threatened Northern Ireland Protocol, ratified January 2020 to create a &quot;de facto&quot; customs border along the Irish Sea to ensure uninterrupted trade between Northern Ireland and the Republic.

After becoming prime minister and leader of the Conservative Party shortly after David Cameron&#x27;s resignation following the Brexit result, an election was called by Prime Minister Theresa May (the former Home Secretary), in an attempt to gain a larger majority for Brexit negotiations and also as an advantage, as the Labour Party were doing badly in the polls, the Conservative Party lost their majority despite winning a record number of votes, and were restricted to forming a &quot;supply and confidence&quot; deal, yet not a formal coalition with the Northern Irish unionist party, the DUP in order to have a working majority in the House of Commons.

Subsequent UK headlines focussed upon the calamitous Grenfell Tower fire that killed 72 in North Kensington on 14 June 2017, the deadliest structural fire in nearly three decades, which prompted an ongoing public inquiry; the novichok nerve agent poisoning of Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his wife Yulia in Salisbury on 4 March 2018, raising diplomatic tensions between the UK and Russia; and May&#x27;s authorisation of air strikes against Bashar al-Assad&#x27;s Syria in the ongoing civil war. Concurrently, Ireland elected its first openly gay taoiseach Fine Gael&#x27;s Leo Varadkar to replace the embattled Enda Kenny on 13 June 2017 in an unprecedented coalition with Fianna Fáil and the Greens; under Varadkar, GDP expanded some 8% in 2017 and 2018 before slowdowns in 2019 and then 2020.

May subsequently faced challenges to her premiership both within and without her party, surviving a vote of confidence in her leadership of the Conservative Party on 12 December 2018 by 200 MPs of the 159 votes required, and a motion of no confidence on 16 January 2019 by a margin of 19. May&#x27;s Irish backstop plan to keep Northern Ireland partially in the EU single market until a deal was made was consistently defeated in the House, forcing her to postpone the UK&#x27;s scheduled departure date. She resigned as party leader and Prime Minister 27 March; in the subsequent leadership election Boris Johnson (who served as foreign secretary in May&#x27;s cabinet 2016–18) defeated Jeremy Hunt, was elected prime minister and secured the largest parliamentary majority in that May&#x27;s general election since 1987, securing an 80-seat majority against Labour&#x27;s Jeremy Corbyn, who would be replaced as Leader of the Opposition by Sir Keir Starmer 4 April 2020.

Under Johnson, Britain withdrew from the EU, and faced challenges, as did Ireland, from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which forced the countries into many months lockdown, imposing social distancing and mask-wearing requirements as millions, including Johnson and incumbent taoiseach Micheál Martin, contracted coronavirus. The economy suffered greatly in both cases, but rebounded quickly; the two nations now face high inflation, economic cooldown and fears of recession. Negotiations after the 2020 Irish general election secured the aforementioned coalition 15 June 2020 largely against the democratic socialist Sinn Féin party, which became the second-largest party in the Dáil with 37 seats, the party&#x27;s most since 1923. Martin became taoiseach 27 June, and Varadkar will return December 2022.

Johnson was greatly damaged by a string of scandals between November 2021 and July 2022, including over his attendance earlier in the pandemic of numerous parties which flouted the government&#x27;s own lockdown restrictions, a string of electoral defeats, controversy involving several Tory MPs, including Owen Paterson and Sir Geoffrey Cox, and his awareness of allegations of sexual misconduct against former chief whip Chris Pincher. Despite surviving a no-confidence vote 6 June by the slightest majority against any sitting Tory Prime Minister, 62 MPs resigned from government between 5–7 July, including Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak and Health Secretary Sajid Javid, prompting his resignation the morning of 7 July. He was replaced as prime minister by Foreign Secretary Liz Truss 5 September, three days before the accession of King Charles III on the death of Queen Elizabeth II.

<text>Lara St. John (born April 15, 1971) is a Canadian violinist.

==Early life==
Lara St. John was born in London, Ontario, and spent her early childhood there. As the daughter of two educators (her father was a language teacher and her mother a music instructor), she and her older brother Scott were encouraged at an early age to develop musical talents.

St. John began playing the violin at the age of two and the following year she began her first lessons with the instructor Richard Lawrence. She gave her first public performance as soloist with an orchestra by age four. In 1976, at the age of five, she began making frequent trips with her mother and brother to Cleveland, Ohio, where the young St. John worked under the instruction of Linda Cerone. In 1979, she spent a year in Paris studying with Gérard Jarry. In 1980, at the age of 9, she won grand prize at the Canadian Music Competition. At age 10, St. John made her European debut with the Gulbenkian Orchestra in Lisbon, after which she spent three years touring the continent, including Spain, France, and Hungary.

Accepted at the age of thirteen, St. John entered the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, where she later received her degree. She studied under Felix Galimir and Arnold Steinhardt. St. John has stated that, during her studies at the Curtis Institute of Music, she was sexually assaulted by one of her instructors, Jascha Brodsky, when she was 14 years old. An investigation by the law firm Cozen O&#x27;Connor, commissioned by the Curtis Board in November 2019, found St. John&#x27;s claims to be credible.The Board unanimously accepted the law firm&#x27;s report.

In 1985, St. John participated in the Yehudi Menuhin International Competition for Young Violinists, winning 4th price in the Junior division.

In 1988, when she was sixteen, she moved on her own to the former Soviet Union, becoming the youngest post-graduate student at the Moscow Conservatory. In that same year, St. John traveled throughout the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, where she encountered the Romani people, a cultural experience that would later influence her musical performance projects.

St. John eventually returned to her studies and attended three different academies: the Guildhall School in London (under David Takeno), Mannes College of Music in New York (under Felix Galimir), and the New England Conservatory (NEC) in Boston (under James Buswell).

==Career==
===Notable performances===
In North America, St. John has performed as a soloist with major symphony orchestras that include those of Cleveland, Philadelphia, Minnesota, Seattle, San Francisco, Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver, the Boston Pops, the Knights, the National Arts Centre Orchestra (Ottawa) and the National Symphony Orchestra (Mexico).

In South America, she has performed with the National Symphony Orchestra (Peru), the Buenos Aires Philharmonic, the Orquestra Sinfônica do Estado de São Paulo and the Orquestra Sinfônica Brasileira.

In Europe, her performances have been with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra, Ensemble Orchestral de Paris, Marseilles Opera Orchestra, Orchestre philharmonique de Strasbourg, Amsterdam Symphony Orchestra, NDR Radiophilharmonie (Hanover), Mendelssohn Kammerorchester (Leipzig), RAI National Symphony Orchestra (Turin), Orchestra della Fondazione Teatro Lirico Giuseppe Verdi (Trieste), Zurich Chamber Orchestra, Norrköping Symphony Orchestra (Sweden), Oulu Symphony Orchestra (Finland), Kymenlaakson Orkesteri (Finland), Franz Liszt Chamber Orchestra (Budapest), Hungarian National Philharmonic, Belgrade Philharmonic Orchestra and Akbank Chamber Orchestra (Istanbul).

In Asia, she has made solo appearances with the China Philharmonic Orchestra (Beijing), Shanghai Symphony Orchestra, Hong Kong Philharmonic, Guangzhou Symphony Orchestra, Hangzhou Philharmonic Orchestra, Kazakh State Symphony Orchestra and Tokyo Symphony Orchestra, among others. St. John has also performed with the Queensland Orchestra, Adelaide Symphony Orchestra and Australian Chamber Orchestra in Australia, as well as the Auckland Philharmonia and Southern Symphonia in New Zealand.

In 2012, she produced and performed in the 25th anniversary concert of Astor Piazzolla’s &quot;Four Seasons of Buenos Aires&quot; in New York&#x27;s Central Park.

===Groups===
From 2002 to 2007, St. John performed with the Canadian music ensemble Bowfire.

==Instruments==
In 1997, upon winning the Canada Council Stradivarius Prize, St. John was given the two-year use of a Lyall Stradivarius built in 1702. In 1999, an anonymous donor made a permanent loan to St. John of the 1779 &quot;Salabue&quot; Guadagnini.

==Ancalagon Records==
In 1999, St. John founded the artist-owned record company, Ancalagon LLC. She formed the company as a result of her personal dissatisfaction with the marketing and production approach of larger recording companies. St. John named the record company after her pet iguana, Ancalagon.

==Internet presence==
St. John&#x27;s recordings have been popular on iTunes. Her &quot;Bach: The Six Sonatas and Partitas for Violin Solo&quot; was iTunes&#x27; best-selling double album of 2007. Her previous recording, &quot;Bach: The Concerto Album&quot;, rose to number one in the iTunes&#x27; classical category in 2005, shortly after appearing in the &quot;strongly recommended&quot; section of &quot;Gramophone&quot;. &quot;Apolkalypse Now&quot;, featuring St. John as a member of the group Polkastra, was released on iTunes in July 2009.

===Music videos===
St. John frequently produces and edits her own music videos, many of which are made available on YouTube. These include four videos of tracks from her &quot;Shiksa&quot; album. She has also participated in a video project series with dancer Stephanie Cadman, evoking the parallels between folk dancing and the dance movements of J. S. Bach.

==Recognition, notable reviews and awards==

St. John&#x27;s work has been featured on NPR&#x27;s &quot;All Things Considered&quot;, CNN&#x27;s &quot;Showbiz Today&quot;, Fox News, the CBC, and the Bravo! special series, &quot;Live At the Rehearsal Hall&quot;. Three short films have been produced by Bravo! featuring St. John, &quot;High Wire Bach&quot;, &quot;Czardas Caprice&quot; and &quot;High Flying Bach&quot;. She has also appeared in &quot;People Magazine&quot;.

At the 2008 Beijing Olympics, gold medalist Nastia Liukin performed her floor routine to &quot;Variations on Dark Eyes (Occhi Chornye)&quot;, from St. John&#x27;s &quot;Gypsy&quot; album.

St. John&#x27;s work has been reviewed by publications including &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; and &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;.

Winner 2011 Juno Classical Album of the Year – Large Ensemble or Soloist(s) with Large Ensemble Accompaniment

In 2018 she served as artistic curator for Wolf Trap Chamber Music at the Barns.

At the time of its release, St. John received attention for her then-controversial photo on the cover of her debut album, &quot;Bach Works for Violin Solo&quot; (1996). The photo showed her from the waist up, apparently topless, holding a violin positioned to hide her chest. The album sold over 25,000 copies, a best seller by the standards of the classical music industry. She said in 2002: &quot;If this cover, being unusual, ... is responsible for a couple of people picking it up and listening to these incredibly great works of Bach that they would not otherwise have heard, then it is all worthwhile.&quot;

==Personal life==
She is married to her manager Stephen H. Judson. While not on tour, she is based in New York City.

She feels an affinity with reptiles: she has a five-foot-long pet iguana, Ancalagon, named after a dragon from J.R.R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;Silmarillion&quot;.

Her native languages are English and French; she is also fluent in Spanish and Russian.

<text>The đàn bầu (; &quot;gourd zither&quot;; Chữ Nôm: ), also called độc huyền cầm (獨絃琴, &quot;one-string zither&quot;; the name is only used by the Jing ethnicity in China) is a Vietnamese stringed instrument, in the form of a monochord (one-string) zither.

==History==

While the earliest written records of the &quot;đàn bầu&quot; date its origin to 1770, scholars estimate its age to be up to one thousand years older than that. A popular legend of its beginning tells of a blind woman playing it in the market to earn a living for her family while her husband was at war. Whether this tale is based in fact or not, it remains true that the &quot;đàn bầu&quot; has historically been played by blind musicians. Until recent times, its soft volume limited the musical contexts in which it could be used. The &quot;đàn bầu&quot;, played solo, is central to Vietnamese folk music, a genre still popular today in the country. Its other traditional application is as an accompaniment to poetry readings. With the invention of the magnetic pickup, the usage of the &quot;đàn bầu&quot; spread to ensembles and also to contemporary Asian pop and rock music. Now, electronics designed for the electric guitar are sometimes employed with the &quot;đàn bầu&quot; to further expand its tonal palette.

==Construction==

Originally, the &quot;đàn bầu&quot; was a tube zither, made of just four parts: a bamboo tube, a wooden rod, a coconut shell half, and a silk string. The string was strung across the bamboo, tied on one end to the rod, which is perpendicularly attached to the bamboo. The coconut shell was attached to the rod, serving as a resonator. In present days, the bamboo has been replaced by a wooden soundboard, with hardwood as the sides and softwood as the middle. An electric guitar string has replaced the traditional silk string. While the gourd is still present, it is now generally made of wood, acting only as a decorative feature. Also, most &quot;đàn bầu&quot; now have modern tuning machines, so the base pitch of the string can be adjusted. Usually, the instrument is tuned to one octave below middle C, about 131 Hz, but it can be tuned to other notes to make it easier to play in keys distant from C.
==Playing==

The &quot;đàn bầu&quot; technique appears relatively simple at first glance, but actually requires a great deal of precision. The fifth finger of the musician&#x27;s right hand rests lightly on the string at one of seven commonly used nodes, while the thumb and index finger pluck the string using a long plectrum. The nodes are the notes of the first seven overtones, or flageolets, similar to guitar harmonics at the string positions above the octave (1/2), the perfect fifth (2/3), the perfect fourth (3/4), the just major third (4/5), the just minor third (5/6) and two tones not present on the Western musical scale: the septimal minor third (6/7) and the septimal whole tone (7/8). With the left hand, the player pushes the flexible rod toward the instrument with the index finger to lower the pitch of the note, or pushes it away from the instrument with the thumb to raise the pitch. This technique is used to play notes not available at a node, or to add vibrato to any note.

==Related instruments==

The &quot;dúxiánqín&quot; (Sino-Vietnamese: độc huyền cầm; Chinese: 獨絃琴) is essentially the same instrument but given a Mandarin name, played by the Jing people in China, who are ethnically Vietnamese. The instrument was introduced to China when the Jing Islands off the coast of Dongxing, Guangxi were ceded to China by France.

The Mường people play an instrument called &quot;Đàn Máng&quot; or &quot;Tàn Máng&quot;, which is virtually identical to acoustic &quot;đàn bầu&quot; forms.

<text>Baden Powell de Aquino (; 6 August 1937 – 26 September 2000), known professionally as Baden Powell, was a Brazilian virtuoso guitarist and composer. He combined classical techniques with popular harmony and swing. He performed in many styles, including bossa nova, samba, Brazilian jazz, Latin jazz and MPB. He performed on stage during most of his lifetime. Powell composed many pieces for guitar some of them now considered guitar standards, such as &quot;Abração em Madrid&quot;, &quot;Braziliense&quot;, &quot;Canto de Ossanha&quot;, &quot;Casa Velha&quot;, &quot;Consolação&quot;, &quot;Horizon&quot;, &quot;Imagem&quot;, &quot;Lotus&quot;, &quot;Samba&quot;, &quot;Samba Triste&quot;, &quot;Simplesmente&quot;, &quot;Tristeza e Solidão&quot;, and &quot;Samba da Benção&quot;. He released &quot;Os Afro-sambas&quot;, a watershed album in MPB, with Vinicius de Moraes in 1966. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest Brazilian guitar players of all time.

==Biography==
Baden Powell de Aquino was born in Varre-Sai in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. His father, a Scouting enthusiast, named him after Robert Baden-Powell. When he was three months old, his family relocated to the Rio suburb of São Cristóvão. His house was a stop for popular musicians during his formative years. He started guitar lessons with Jayme Florence, a famous choro guitarist in the 1940s. He soon proved a young virtuoso, having won many talent competitions before he was a teenager. At age fifteen, he was playing professionally, accompanying singers and bands in various styles. He was fascinated by swing and jazz, but his main influences were in the Brazilian guitar canon.

In 1955, Powell played with the Steve Bernard Orquestra at the Boite Plaza, a nightclub within the Plaza Hotel in Rio, where his skill got the attention of the jazz trio playing across the lobby at the Plaza Bar. When Ed Lincoln needed to form a new trio, he asked Powell to join on guitar to become the Hotel Plaza Trio. Powell brought in Luiz Marinho on bass and a fourth member of the &quot;trio&quot;: Claudette Soares on vocals. Powell, Lincoln, and their young musician friends took part in after-hours jam sessions, gaining notice in the growing Brazilian jazz scene.

Powell achieved wider fame in 1959 by convincing Billy Blanco, an established singer and songwriter, to put lyrics to one of Baden&#x27;s compositions. The result was called &quot;Samba Triste&quot; and quickly became very successful. It has been covered by many artists, including Stan Getz and Charlie Byrd in their seminal LP &quot;Jazz Samba.&quot;

In 1962, Powell met the poet-diplomat Vinicius de Moraes and began a collaboration that yielded classics of 1960s Brazilian music. Although bossa nova was the prevailing sound at the time, Baden and Vinicius wanted to combine samba with Afro-Brazilian forms such as candomblé, umbanda, and capoeira. In 1966 they released &quot;Os Afro-Sambas de Baden e Vinicius&quot;.

Powell studied advanced harmony with Moacir Santos and released recordings on the Brazilian labels Elenco Records and Forma, as well as in the French label Barclay and the German label MPS/Saba (notably, his 1966 &quot;Tristeza on Guitar&quot;). He was the house guitarist for Elenco, and of the singer Elis Regina&#x27;s TV show &quot;O Fino da Bossa&quot;.

In 1968, Powell joined with poet Paulo César Pinheiro and produced another series of Afro-Brazilian-inspired music, released in 1970 as &quot;Os Cantores da Lapinha&quot;.
Powell visited and toured Europe frequently in the 1960s, relocating permanently to France in 1968.

In the 1970s, he released recordings with labels in Europe and Brazil. In 1981, he performed on the stage of Palais des glaces in Paris as guitarist and singer for four weeks. However, he had health problems and spent the 1980s in semi-retirement in France and Germany. In the 1990s he and his family moved back to Brazil, where he continued to record and perform. Public recognition of his work came around that time in Brazil.

By the end of the 1990s he converted to evangelical Christianity, to which he credits overcoming his long addictions to alcohol and tobacco. He fell terminally ill in 2000 and died of general infection triggered by a bacterial pneumonia on 26 September 2000, in Rio de Janeiro.

==Playing style==
Baden Powell decided at age 19 to stop playing the electric guitar, preferring to concentrate on the classical guitar for the rest of his career. He did record a series of albums with a borrowed steel-string acoustic, but that is as far as he strayed from his main instrument in his adulthood.

An analysis of his repertoire reveals a wide range of interests. It spanned all the idioms of Brazilian popular music of the 20th century: samba, bossa nova, Afro-bahian ritual music, frevo, choro, and North Eastern Sertão music, and even European and Japanese lullabies. Like most musicians growing up in the 1940s and 1950s, he was deeply influenced by jazz, especially bebop and swing. He covered Thelonious Monk&#x27;s &quot;Round Midnight&quot; on two recordings, and Jerome Kern&#x27;s &quot;All the Things You Are&quot; on three occasions (including his first solo album).

This upbringing is reflected in his playing style, which shows a fusion of jazz harmonies and classical guitar technique, with a very Brazilian right hand (the one carrying the rhythm on the guitar). In solo classical music, he was proficient in the works of Tárrega and Bach. When playing in a group, he was able to accompany singers with quiet mastery, or let loose and play street samba in sloppy &quot;party&quot; style as if the guitar was another percussion instrument. Like Monk, he was fond of the minor second interval as a way to &quot;bend&quot; the tonality. However, because of his jazz background, he would rarely physically bend the string, preferring instead to play the minor second using an adjacent open string. Students of his style should note this preference for chord voicings that feature extensions on the open strings as a way of punctuating passages. Other idioms to watch for are the endless variations in rhythm played by the right hand, always within the proper samba meter, as well as his tendency to put his &quot;signature&quot; in a fast descending scale with a (slower) ascending arpeggio in the relative key. He also used vocalise and scat singing, often in unison with the melody line (especially when the melody was sung on the bass strings of the guitar).

His influences were his first teacher &quot;Meira&quot; (Jayme Florence, 1909–1982), Dilermando Reis (1916–1977), and Garoto (Anibal Augusto Sardinha, 1915–1955). He also commented about being influenced by the work of Les Paul (1915–2009), Django Reinhardt (1910–1953), and Jacques Loussier (1934–2019).

==Discography==
Baden Powell first appeared as accompanist on a few big band and samba recordings from the 1950s. He recorded his first solo album in 1959, but it was released in 1961. His first and second albums contain jazz standards, Brazilian popular music of the time, and original compositions. In 1962, he recorded with flautist Herbie Mann and drummer Jimmy Pratt. In 1963 he led small ensembles in Brazil and France. The French labels Barclay and Festival released many of his recordings. In Germany, MPS/Saba released his work with producer Joachim Berendt. In Brazil, he recorded for Elenco Records, Forma, and the Brazilian subsidiary of Philips Records. After a few new releases in the 1980s, Powell returned to recording studios in Brazil for his final years. His later recordings consist of solo guitar or voice and guitar.

<text>A railbus is a lightweight passenger railcar with an automotive engine. It shares many aspects of its construction with a bus, typically having a bus (original or modified) body and four wheels (2 axles) on a fixed base instead of on bogies. Originally designed and developed during the 1930s, railbuses have evolved into larger dimensions with characteristics similar in appearance to a light railcar, with the terms &quot;railcar&quot; and &quot;railbus&quot; often used interchangeably. Railbuses designed for use specifically on little-used railway lines were commonly employed in countries such as Germany, Italy, France, the United Kingdom, and Sweden.

Today, railbuses are being replaced by modern, light DMU railcar designs. Modern diesel-electric railcars, which can be run coupled as multiple units, like the Stadler RS1, the RegioSprinter of Siemens, or the successor Siemens Desiro, share the role and specifications with railbuses (albeit with improvements in noise, low floor design, fuel efficiency, speed, and other measures), but are usually not referred to by the term &quot;railbus&quot; any longer.

==Usage by country==
===Argentina===
Locally manufactured TecnoTren railbuses are in use around Argentina, most notably on the University train of La Plata. They are mostly used in rural parts of the country where the tracks have not yet been repaired and so can&#x27;t handle the weight of regular trains.
===Australia===
In 1937, the NSW Department of Railways added six Waddington-built four-wheel streamlined &quot;FP Paybuses&quot; to serve on small branch lines out of Cowra and Harden that did not have enough passengers to justify a rail motor. Powered by a Ford V8 engine, they were given the designation FP1 to FP6. When the railbus service wasn&#x27;t popular, several of the buses became mobile pay cars used to pay railway employees at stations and working on tracks.

In December 1941, one of these railbuses (FP 5) was destroyed when dynamite was placed on railway tracks near Yanderra. The three-man crew of the railbus were killed in the explosion. Though £2,000 of loose cash was taken, the safe in the railcar could not be opened by the robbers. No one was prosecuted for the offence.

The first railbus, FP1, has been restored where it is on display at the NSW Rail Museum in Thirlmere. Another seven were built by Comeng in the 1960s.

In Queensland, &quot;RailBus service&quot; refers to road bus service running parallel to portions of some railway lines, substituting for commuter train.

===Czech Republic and Slovakia===

In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, railbuses are used on less frequented rural lines. Most railbuses are based on a former ČSD M 152.0 diesel multiple unit, also known as ČD/ŽSR Class 810.

===Canada===
The Kaoham Shuttle utilizes DMU railbuses for its daily service between Lillooet and D&#x27;Arcy, British Columbia.
===Germany===

In Germany, the &quot;Schienenbus&quot; was developed in the 1930s to fulfill the need for an inexpensive rail vehicle. It was built to standard specifications on Germany&#x27;s Reichsbahn (the predecessor to DB) to meet the demand for cost-effective services on light railways or &quot;Kleinbahnen&quot; (the Wismar railbus was a pioneer in those days.) After the Second World War, the eventually ubiquitous Uerdingen railbuses were developed by Deutsche Bundesbahn in single-engined and double-engined versions. The latter were powerful enough to haul through coaches and freight cars. Matching trailers and driving trailers were developed as well. These railbuses were a predecessor of the modern diesel multiple units. In the late 1950s, Deutsche Reichsbahn in the GDR developed the single-engined class VT 2.09 with matching trailers and driving trailers, built by Waggonbau Bautzen.

A number of serious accidents in Germany in the late 1970s involving railbuses resulted in the specification and development of larger, more robustly designed diesel railcars. Although these cars were more similar in size to the U.S. produced diesel railcars, they would not have complied with current FRA requirements, and, like their North American cousin rail diesel cars, are largely railroad-derivative designs. The DB Class 628 exemplifies the contemporary German diesel railcar. This type of car replaced the &quot;Schienenbus&quot; and locomotive-hauled train consists where possible on branch-line and main-line assignments during the 1980s and 1990s. Both the Uerdingen Schienenbus and the Bautzen railbuses have virtually disappeared from regular revenue service, but its diesel rail car successors are still widely used. DMUs of a third generation in succession after the &quot;Schienenbus&quot; are now being ordered by the hundreds in a variety of modular design combinations. As a curious fact, there is also a double-decker DB Class 670.
=== Hungary ===

The first railbuses appeared in Hungary in 1925, made by Ganz Works. From 1934, MÁV started to use railbuses called Árpád, which were also manufactured by Ganz. These vehicles ran on the Budapest-Vienna line. In 1975, the last Árpád was scrapped.

In 1986, due to the lack of ČD 810 trains, Ikarus converted an Ikarus 260 bus into a railbus on behalf of MÁV. This model was called Ikarus 725. Its variations 725.01, 722.01 and 723.01 were sent to Malaysia in 1988.

=== India ===

Indian Railways operates many railbuses on its branch lines. These railbuses are being replaced by EMUs due to increase in passengers.

There is railbus on the Kalka-Shimla route (train number 72451), Mathura to Vrindavan (train number 72175) and Merta Jn to Merta City (train number 74804), Khajjidoni - Bagalkot as well, among others.
===Indonesia===

Railbuses in Indonesia are built locally by INKA and used in several local rail services operated by PT Kereta Api Indonesia (KAI).

On August 5, 2012, the first railbus service in the country &quot;Batara Kresna&quot; railbus was launched to accommodate parts of &quot;Prambanan Ekspres&quot; commuter rail passengers in Central Java from Purwosari Station in Solo to Wonogiri Station in Wonogiri and vice versa.

In 2014, KAI launched &quot;Kertalaya&quot; railbus in South Sumatra between Kertapati Station in Palembang to Indralaya Station in Ogan Ilir and vice versa to ease road traffic.

In 2016, &quot;Lembah Anai&quot; railbus was launched in West Sumatra to serve passengers from Kayu Tanam Station in Padang Pariaman to Minangkabau International Airport.

===Ireland===

The Great Northern Railway of Ireland produced railbuses at the Railway Works in Dundalk.

===Japan===
The president of JNR visited West Germany in 1953 and was introduced to railbusses there. JNR subsequently drew up a plan for railbus introduction plan in JNR, and a prototype was built in 1955. However, JNR found railbuses less reliable in daily operation as compared to standard rail equipment and discontinued their use in the 1960s.
Railbuses produced by Fuji Heavy Industries were operational on the Nanbu Jūkan Railway from 1962 until the line ceased operations in 1997, though the preserved units can still be seen at Shichinohe Station.

Motorization soared in Japan from the 1970s on, reducing consuming passenger numbers on local private railways. Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd. in 1982 began development of an &quot;LE-Car&quot; that incorporates significantly the structure of the bus, deficit local lines of JNR has been adopted by many of the railway company that local governments and private companies are operated by joint investment.

===Mongolia===
The Ulaanbaatar Railbus is a railbus-based public transit system in the Mongolian capital of Ulaanbaatar.
===Netherlands===
In the Netherlands, a Michelin car was trialled in 1932.

=== Peru ===

Railbuses are used on PeruRail.

===Saudi Arabia and Syria===
Syrian railbuses are used in Damascus from Ma&#x27;adan to Sarouja, and in Saudi Arabia from Riyadh to Medina and Mecca.

===Sri Lanka===

Railbuses entered service in Sri Lanka in 1995, using Tata Dimo buses, and later Lanka Ashok Leyland buses. The buses, originally built for road use, were modified to be used on rails and connected back-to-back like a DMU. Railbuses are used in various areas with little passenger demand, including from Kandy to the suburb of Peradeniya and the Kelani Valley line in Colombo. Services where railbuses are used are not indicated on the Sri Lankan Railways website. The route from Maho Junction to Polghawela in North Western Province is also serviced by Lanka Ashok Leyland railbuses.
===United Kingdom===
British Rail produced a variety of railbuses as a means both of building new rolling stock cheaply, and to provide services on lightly used lines economically.

A variety of railbus known as Pacers, which were constructed in the 1980s, remained in service until 2021, they were phased out as a result of their failure to comply with accessibility requirements.

===United States===

There are records of bus bodies being fitted to special Mack Truck chassis built with small four-wheel bogie trucks under the engine and hood, and larger flanged steel drive wheels, as early as 1903. Osgood Bradley Car Company built one of the more popular bodies during the 1920s. Fairbanks-Morse, later a locomotive builder, offered similar conversions fitted to Dodge truck chassis in the mid-1930s, preferring to fit the truck chassis with van bodies and supply a small matching passenger coach trailer. Some railroads built their own bodies on truck or large, powerful luxury passenger car chassis. Most continued the pattern of a small two axle truck in front, and a single drive axle in the rear. One example from the 1930s, built on a White Truck chassis, is preserved at the National Museum of Transportation in Kirkwood, Missouri.

The use of railbuses in the United States allowed railroads in the 1920s to run frequent and reliable passenger service on branch lines for a fraction of the cost of running steam locomotives, allowing some lines to directly compete with road transportation. The railbuses were well-liked by passengers and able to stop and start more easily than dedicated trains.

After World War II a number of more modern light train concepts appeared. Few were successful, as many railroads cooperated with highway bus services to eliminate passenger trains from their branch lines. Some, like the American Car &amp; Foundry Motorailer, blurred the line between railcar and railbus. Others, such as the Mack FCD, landed firmly in the railbus camp. Ten of the Macks were purchased by the New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford Railroad during 1951–1952. By the time they were delivered, however, a new president was in charge, and he had little interest in serving branch lines. Only one saw regular service. All were sold to other entities such as Sperry Rail Service, or to overseas railroads.

In 1967 and 1968, Red Arrow Lines tested a GM New Look bus converted to operate on rails on its interurban routes and the Norristown High Speed Line.

In 1985, SEPTA tested an imported BRE-Leyland railbus on the now-closed Fox Chase to Newton section of the Fox Chase Line.

<text>Nonsuch Palace was a Tudor royal palace, commissioned by Henry VIII in Surrey, England, and on which work began in 1538. Its site lies in what is now Nonsuch Park on the boundary of the borough of Epsom and Ewell (in Surrey) and the London Borough of Sutton.

The palace was designed to be a celebration of the power and the grandeur of the Tudor dynasty, built to rival Francis I&#x27;s Château de Chambord. Unlike most of Henry&#x27;s palaces, Nonsuch was not an adaptation of an old building; he chose to build a new palace in this location because it was near to one of his main hunting grounds. However, the choice of location was unwise, for there was no nearby supply of water suitable for domestic use.

The palace remained standing until 1682–3, when it was pulled down by Barbara, Countess of Castlemaine, mistress to Charles II, to sell off building materials to pay for her gambling debts.

== Building==
Nonsuch Palace, near Cheam, Greater London, was perhaps the grandest of Henry VIII&#x27;s building projects. It was built on the site of Cuddington, near Ewell, the church and village having been destroyed and compensation paid, to create a suitable site. Work started on 22 April 1538, the first day of Henry&#x27;s thirtieth regnal year, and six months after the birth of his son, later Edward VI.

Within two months the name &quot;Nonsuch&quot; appears in the building accounts, its name a boast that there was no such palace elsewhere equal to it in magnificence. Construction had been substantially carried out by 1541, but it took several more years to complete. As the Royal Household took possession of vast tracts of surrounding acreage, several major roads were re-routed or by-passed to circumvent what became Nonsuch Great Park.

== Later history ==
The palace was incomplete when Henry VIII died in 1547. In 1556 Queen Mary I sold it to Henry FitzAlan, 19th Earl of Arundel, who completed it by 1559. In 1585, the Treaty of Nonsuch was signed by Elizabeth I of England and the Dutch Republic at the palace. After Arundel&#x27;s death in 1580, his son-in-law, John Lumley, 1st Baron Lumley, sold the palace back to Elizabeth I and the Crown in 1590–1592, in exchange for lands valued at £534.

Upon the death of Elizabeth I in 1603, the palace was inherited by her successor, King James I/VI of England and Scotland.

Nonsuch Palace came to Anne of Denmark as her jointure property as the consort of King James VI/I. The royal Prince Henry and Princess Elizabeth, the future ‘Winter Queen’ of Bohemia were lodged at Nonsuch for a time in 1603. The Great Park remained the property of Lord Lumley until he surrendered the lease to the queen in 1605. She rarely visited, but came in July 1617 attended by Viscount Lisle, Lucy, Countess of Bedford, and the Earls of Southampton and Montgomery.

Under King James I, Viscount Lumley was appointed Keeper of the Palace and Little Park. Lumley paid the gardeners and weeders from his yearly fee. In 1606, the Earl of Worcester succeeded him. He was paid £600 to build a new lodge in the Great Park, known as &quot;Worcester House&quot;. Both James I and Charles I regularly visited for hunting and racing.

Following Parliament&#x27;s victory in the English Civil War, the Nonsuch estate was confiscated and let to a series of Parliamentarian supporters: first to Algernon Sidney, then to Colonel Robert Lilburne. The estate was then sold to Major-General John Lambert, and latterly to General Thomas Pride, who held it until his death in 1658.

The palace was handed back to the Crown after the Restoration in 1660, with the palace given to Queen Henrietta Maria and the park and Worcester House leased to Sir Robert Long. John Evelyn visited it in 1666 and reported:I ... took an exact view of the plaster statues and bass-relievos inserted betwixt the timbers and punchceons of the outside walls of the Court; which must needs have been the work of some celebrated Italian. I much admired how they had lasted so well and entire since the time of Henry VIII., exposed as they are to the air; and pity it is they are not taken out and preserved in some dry place; a gallery would become them. There are some mezzo-relievos as big as the life; the story is of the Heathen Gods, emblems, compartments, &amp;c. The palace consists of two courts, of which the first is of stone, castle like, by the Lord Lumleys (of whom it was purchased), the other of timber, a Gothic fabric, but these walls incomparably beautified. I observed that the appearing timber-puncheons, entrelices, &amp;c., were all so covered with scales of slate, that it seemed carved in the wood and painted, the slate fastened on the timber in pretty figures, that has, like a coat of armour, preserved it from rotting. There stand in the garden two handsome stone pyramids, and the avenue planted with rows of fair elms, but the rest of these goodly trees, both of this and of Worcester Park adjoining, were felled by those destructive and avaricious rebels in the late war, which defaced one of the stateliest seats his Majesty had.

Nonsuch remained royal property until 1670, when Charles II gave it to his mistress, Barbara, Countess of Castlemaine, with the title Baroness of Nonsuch. She had it pulled down around 1682–3 and sold off the building materials to pay her gambling debts.

Some elements were incorporated into other buildings; for example the wood panelling can still be seen today in the Great Hall at Loseley Park near Guildford. No trace of the palace remains on its site today, but some pieces are held by the British Museum. There is a discernible rise of land where the old Cuddington church used to be, before it was demolished to make way for the palace. Nonsuch Palace should not be confused with Nonsuch Mansion, which is at the east of the park, nor its associated banqueting hall whose foundations are still visible to the south east of the palace site.

The palace cost at least £24,000 (over £10 million in 2021) because of its rich ornamentation and is considered a key work in the introduction of elements of Renaissance design to England.

== Archaeology ==
Only about three contemporary images of the palace survive, and they do not reveal very much about either the layout or the details of the building. Following the digging of the trenches in the Second World War, it was reported that pieces of pottery had been discovered in the area, later found to be from the site of the palace. An outline of the site layout was also visible from the air, providing additional evidence in the search for the location of the site.

The site was excavated in 1959–60; the plan of the palace was quite simple with inner and outer courtyards, each with a fortified gatehouse. The exterior and outer courtyard were quite plain, but the inner courtyard was decorated with breathtaking stucco panels moulded in high relief. To the north, it was fortified in a medieval style, but the southern face had ornate Renaissance decoration, with tall octagonal towers at each end. It was within one of these towers that the premiere of Thomas Tallis&#x27; masterwork, &quot;Spem in alium&quot;, was perhaps performed. The 1959 excavation of Nonsuch by Martin Biddle, aged 22, was a key event in the history of archaeology in the UK. It was one of the first post-medieval sites to be excavated, and attracted over 75,000 visitors during the work. This excavation led to major developments in post-medieval archaeology.

== Gardens ==

John Speed&#x27;s map of Surrey has an insert depicting the palace and a part of its gardens, including some of the principal ornaments. These are also known from detailed drawings in the &quot;Red Velvet Book&quot;, the 1590 Lumley inventory.

<text>A traffic alert and collision avoidance system (TCAS), pronounced ), also known as an Airborne Collision Avoidance System (ACAS), is an aircraft collision avoidance system designed to reduce the incidence of mid-air collision (MAC) between aircraft. It monitors the airspace around an aircraft for other aircraft equipped with a corresponding active transponder, independent of air traffic control, and warns pilots of the presence of other transponder-equipped aircraft which may present a threat of MAC. It is a type of airborne collision avoidance system mandated by the International Civil Aviation Organization to be fitted to all aircraft with a maximum take-off mass (MTOM) of over or authorized to carry more than 19 passengers. In the United States, CFR 14, Ch I, part 135 requires that TCAS I be installed for aircraft with 10–30 passengers and TCAS II for aircraft with more than 30 passengers. ACAS/TCAS is based on secondary surveillance radar (SSR) transponder signals, but operates independently of ground-based equipment to provide advice to the pilot on potentially conflicting aircraft.
In modern glass cockpit aircraft, the TCAS display may be integrated in the navigation display (ND) or electronic horizontal situation indicator (EHSI).
In older glass cockpit aircraft and those with mechanical instrumentation, an integrated TCAS display including an instantaneous vertical speed indicator (IVSI) may replace the mechanical IVSI, which only indicates the rate at which the aircraft is descending or climbing.

== Impetus for a system and history ==

Research into collision avoidance systems has been ongoing since at least the 1950s, and the airline industry has been working with the Air Transport Association of America (ATA) since 1955 toward a collision avoidance system. ICAO and aviation authorities such as the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) were spurred into action by the 1956 Grand Canyon mid-air collision.

Although ATCRBS airborne transponders were available, it was not until the mid-1970s that research focused on using their signals as the cooperative element for a collision avoidance system. This technical approach enabled an independent collision avoidance capability on the flight deck, separate from the ground system. In 1981, the FAA decided to implement the Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS), which was developed based on industry and agency efforts in the field of beacon-based collision avoidance systems and air-to-air discrete address communication techniques that used Mode S airborne transponder message formats.

A short time later, prototypes of TCAS II were installed on two Piedmont Airlines Boeing 727 aircraft, and were flown on regularly scheduled flights. Although the displays were located outside the view of the flight crew and seen only by trained observers, these tests did provide valuable information on the frequency and circumstances of alerts and their potential for interaction with the ATC system. On a follow-on phase II program, a later version of TCAS II was installed on a single Piedmont Airlines Boeing 727, and the system was certified in April 1986, then subsequently approved for operational evaluation in early 1987. Since the equipment was not developed to full standards, the system was only operated in visual meteorological conditions (VMC). Although the flight crew operated the system, the evaluation was primarily for the purpose of data collection and its correlation with flight crew and observer observation and response.

Later versions of TCAS II manufactured by Bendix/King Air Transport Avionics Division were installed and approved on United Airlines airplanes in early 1988. Similar units manufactured by Honeywell were installed and approved on Northwest Airlines airplanes in late 1988. This limited installation program operated TCAS II units approved for operation as a full-time system in both visual and instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) on three different aircraft types. The operational evaluation programs continued through 1988 to validate the operational suitability of the systems.

=== Incidents ===
The implementation of TCAS added a safety barrier to help prevent mid-air collisions. However, further study, refinements, training and regulatory measures were still required because the limitations and misuse of the system still resulted in other incidents and fatal accidents, which include:

* 1996 Charkhi Dadri mid-air collision accident over New Delhi
* 1999 Lambourne near-collision, involving a Boeing 737-300 and a Gulfstream IV. The airspace above Lambourne is the waiting zone for Heathrow. The event is notable as both planes entered the zone from different directions leading to an imminent head-on collision (one o&#x27;clock position). The traffic advisory (amber mark) almost immediately turned into a resolution advisory (red mark) with a projected time for collision of less than 25 seconds.
* 2001 Japan Airlines mid-air incident, in which the Captain of Japan Airlines Flight 907 (a Boeing 747-400), 40-year old Makoto Watanabe (), chose to descend, ordered by the air traffic controller, when TCAS told the flight crew to climb, nearly colliding with the descending JAL Flight 958 DC-10 en route from Busan to Tokyo&#x27;s Narita Airport.
* 2002 Überlingen mid-air collision, between a Boeing 757 and a Tupolev Tu-154, where the Tupolev pilots declined to follow their TCAS resolution advisory (RA), instead following the directions of the air traffic controller, while the Boeing pilots followed their TCAS-RA, having no ATC instruction.
* 2006 collision between Gol Transportes Aéreos Flight 1907 (a Boeing 737) and an Embraer Legacy 600; the Embraer&#x27;s transponder had inadvertently been switched off, disabling its own TCAS and rendering the plane invisible to the TCAS on board flight 1907.
* 2011 Fribourg near-collision, involving Germanwings Airbus A319 Flight 2529 and Hahn-Air-Lines Raytheon Premier I Flight 201. Air traffic control at Geneva allowed flight 2529 to sink to flight level 250 () but entered flight level 280 () as usual for handover to traffic control at Zürich. Air traffic control at Zürich allowed flight 201 to climb to flight level 270 (). This triggered a resolution advisory (RA) for the Airbus to sink and for the Raytheon to climb which was followed by both aircraft. Nine seconds later Geneva instructed the Raytheon to sink to flight level 260 () which they then followed. It led to a situation where both planes passed at minimum distance. Shortly later the Raytheon was lower than the Airbus and TCAS issued a reversal RA for the Airbus to climb and for the Raytheon to sink.

== Overview ==

=== System description ===
TCAS involves communication between all aircraft equipped with an appropriate transponder (provided the transponder is enabled and set up properly). Each TCAS-equipped aircraft interrogates all other aircraft in a determined range about their position (via the 1030 MHz radio frequency), and all other aircraft reply to other interrogations (via 1090 MHz). This interrogation-and-response cycle may occur several times per second.

The TCAS system builds a three dimensional map of aircraft in the airspace, incorporating their range (garnered from the interrogation and response round trip time), altitude (as reported by the interrogated aircraft), and bearing (by the directional antenna from the response). Then, by extrapolating current range and altitude difference to anticipated future values, it determines if a potential collision threat exists.

TCAS and its variants are only able to interact with aircraft that have a correctly operating mode C or mode S transponder. A unique 24-bit identifier is assigned to each aircraft that has a mode S transponder.

The next step beyond identifying potential collisions is automatically negotiating a mutual avoidance manoeuver (currently, manoeuvers are restricted to changes in altitude and modification of climb/sink rates) between the two (or more) conflicting aircraft. These avoidance manoeuvers are communicated to the flight crew by a cockpit display and by synthesized voice instructions.

A protected volume of airspace surrounds each TCAS equipped aircraft. The size of the protected volume depends on the altitude, speed, and heading of the aircraft involved in the encounter. The illustration below gives an example of a typical TCAS protection volume.

=== System components ===
A TCAS installation consists of the following components:

;TCAS computer unit: Performs airspace surveillance, intruder tracking, its own aircraft altitude tracking, threat detection, resolution advisory (RA) manoeuvre determination and selection, and generation of advisories. The TCAS processor uses pressure altitude, radar altitude, and discrete aircraft status inputs from its own aircraft to control the collision avoidance logic parameters that determine the protection volume around the TCAS aircraft.
;Antennas: The antennas used by TCAS II include a directional antenna that is mounted on the top of the aircraft and either an omnidirectional or a directional antenna mounted on the bottom of the aircraft. Most installations use the optional directional antenna on the bottom of the aircraft. In addition to the two TCAS antennas, two antennas are also required for the Mode S transponder. One antenna is mounted on the top of the aircraft while the other is mounted on the bottom. These antennas enable the Mode S transponder to receive interrogations at 1030 MHz and reply to the received interrogations at 1090 MHz.
;Cockpit presentation: The TCAS interface with the pilots is provided by two displays: the traffic display and the RA display. These two displays can be implemented in a number of ways including displays that incorporate both displays into a single, physical unit. Regardless of the implementation, the information displayed is identical. The standards for both the traffic display and the RA display are defined in DO-185A.

== Operation ==

The following section describes the TCAS operation based on TCAS II, since this is the version that has been adopted as an international standard (ACAS II) by ICAO and aviation authorities worldwide.

=== Operation modes ===
TCAS II can be currently operated in the following modes:

;Stand-by: Power is applied to the TCAS Processor and the mode S transponder, but TCAS does not issue any interrogations and the transponder will reply to only discrete interrogations.
;Transponder: The mode S transponder is fully operational and will reply to all appropriate ground and TCAS interrogations. TCAS remains in stand-by.
;Traffic advisories only: The mode S transponder is fully operational. TCAS will operate normally and issue the appropriate interrogations and perform all tracking functions. However, TCAS will only issue traffic advisories (TA), and the resolution advisories (RA) will be inhibited.
;Automatic (traffic/resolution advisories): The mode S transponder is fully operational. TCAS will operate normally and issue the appropriate interrogations and perform all tracking functions. TCAS will issue traffic advisories (TA) and resolution advisories (RA), when appropriate.

TCAS works in a coordinated manner, so when an RA is issued to conflicting aircraft, a required action (i.e., &quot;Climb. Climb.&quot;) has to be immediately performed by one of the aircraft, while the other one receives a similar RA in the opposite direction (i.e., &quot;Descend. Descend.&quot;).

=== Alerts ===

TCAS II issues the following types of aural annunciations:
* Traffic advisory (TA)
* Resolution advisory (RA)
* Clear of conflict

When a TA is issued, pilots are instructed to initiate a visual search for the traffic causing the TA. If the traffic is visually acquired, pilots are instructed to maintain visual separation from the traffic. Training programs also indicate that no horizontal maneuvers are to be made based solely on information shown on the traffic display. Slight adjustments in vertical speed while climbing or descending, or slight adjustments in airspeed while still complying with the ATC clearance are acceptable.

When an RA is issued, pilots are expected to respond immediately to the RA unless doing so would jeopardize the safe operation of the flight. This means that aircraft will at times have to manoeuver contrary to ATC instructions or disregard ATC instructions. In these cases, the controller is no longer responsible for separation of the aircraft involved in the RA until the conflict is terminated.

On the other hand, ATC can potentially interfere with a pilot&#x27;s response to RAs. If a conflicting ATC instruction coincides with an RA, a pilot may assume that ATC is fully aware of the situation and is providing the better resolution. But in reality, ATC is not aware of the RA until the RA is reported by the pilot. Once the RA is reported by the pilot, ATC is required not to attempt to modify the flight path of the aircraft involved in the encounter. Hence, the pilot is expected to &quot;follow the RA&quot; but in practice this does not always happen.

Some countries have implemented &quot;RA downlink&quot; which provides air traffic controllers with information about RAs posted in the cockpit. Currently, there are no ICAO provisions concerning the use of RA downlink by air traffic controllers.

The following points receive emphasis during pilot training:
* Do not maneuver in a direction opposite to that indicated by the RA because this may result in a collision.
* Inform the controller of the RA as soon as permitted by flight crew workload after responding to the RA. There is no requirement to make this notification prior to initiating the RA response.
* Be alert for the removal of RAs or the weakening of RAs so that deviations from a cleared altitude are minimized.
* If possible, comply with the controller&#x27;s clearance, e.g. turn to intercept an airway or localizer, at the same time as responding to an RA.
* When the RA event is completed, promptly return to the previous ATC clearance or instruction or comply with a revised ATC clearance or instruction.

An RA occurs on average every 1,000 flight hours on short/medium-haul aircraft and every 3,000 hours for long-haul aircraft.
In its December 2017 ACAS guide, Eurocontrol found in about 25% of the cases, the pilots follow the RA inaccurately.
Airbus offers the option of an autopilot/flight director TCAS for automatic avoidance maneuvers.

=== Types of traffic and resolution advisories ===
=== Pilot/aircrew interaction during a TCAS event ===
== Safety aspects ==
Safety studies on TCAS estimate that the system improves safety in the airspace by a factor of between 3 and 5.

However, it is well understood that part of the remaining risk is that TCAS may induce midair collisions: &quot;In particular, it is dependent on the accuracy of the threat aircraft&#x27;s reported altitude and on the expectation that the threat aircraft will not make an abrupt maneuver that defeats the TCAS Resolution Advisory (RA). The safety study also shows that TCAS II will induce some critical near midair collisions...&quot; (See page 7 of Introduction to TCAS II Version 7 and 7.1 (PDF) in external links below).

One potential problem with TCAS II is the possibility that a recommended avoidance maneuver might direct the flight crew to descend toward terrain below a safe altitude. Recent requirements for incorporation of ground proximity mitigate this risk. Ground proximity warning alerts have priority in the cockpit over TCAS alerts.

Some pilots have been unsure how to act when their aircraft was requested to climb whilst flying at their maximum altitude. The accepted procedure is to follow the climb RA as best as possible, temporarily trading speed for height. The climb RA should quickly finish. In the event of a stall warning, the stall warning would take priority.

Both cases have been addressed by Version 7.0 of TCAS II and are currently handled by a corrective RA together with a visual indication of a green arc in the IVSI display to indicate the safe range for the climb or descent rate. However, it has been found that in some cases these indications could lead to a dangerous situation for the involved aircraft. For example, if a TCAS event occurs when two aircraft are descending one over the other for landing, the aircraft at the lower altitude will first receive a &quot;Descend, descend&quot; RA, and when reaching an extreme low altitude, this will change to a &quot;Level off, level off&quot; RA, together with a green arc indication directing the pilot to level off the aircraft. This could place the aircraft dangerously into the path of the intruder above, who is descending to land. A change proposal has been issued to correct this problem.

== Security aspects ==
TCAS was not designed with security in mind, even in its newest versions. With the rise of software-defined radios, security researchers have investigated wireless attacks on TCAS. Researchers demonstrate how to take full control over the collision avoidance displays and create RAs of arbitrary aircraft on a collision course. These attacks can be launched using commercial off-the-shelf hardware and could be used to instruct the pilot to climb or descend at will. However, these attacks are only possible when the attacker is close to the victim aircraft (up to a distance of 4.2 km), limiting the risk of abuse in the real world.

== Relationship to Traffic Advisory System (TAS) ==
TCAS technology has proved to be too expensive for small business and general aviation aircraft. Manufacturers and authorities recognized the need for an alternative to TCAS; this led to the development of the Traffic Advisory System. TAS is actually a simplified version of TCAS I. The system structure, components, operation, traffic display and TA logic are identical, but the minimum operational performance standards (MOPS) of TAS allow some simplification compared to TCAS I:
* Class A and Class B equipment are defined, where Class A is identical to TCAS I but Class B devices operate without traffic display (the latter give aural TAs only, accompanied by some visual representation of the TA).
* TAS display can be monochrome.
* There are very minor differences in operational tolerance values.
* TAS devices can provide only two levels of advisories: Other Traffic and Traffic Advisories (TAs). Displaying proximate traffic and Proximate Advisories (PAs) are optional, nevertheless most of the TAS devices provide the tracking of proximate traffic and use the standard TCAS I symbology.
* To assure that all interference effects from the TCAS I equipment are kept to a low level, TCAS I equipments continuously count the number of TCAS aircraft in the vicinity and reduce their interrogation rate or power or both to conform to the operational limits. This is also true to TAS equipments, but the manufacturer may choose to operate a TAS as a low power system at a fixed rate power product limit of 42W/sec, in which case the requirement to interference limitation is eliminated.

The following documents contain all of the differences between TCAS I and TAS:
* the minimum operational performance standards (MOPS) of TCAS I are described at RTCA-DO-197A,
* and changes to this document applicable to Traffic Advisory System (TAS) are published in TSO-C147a (or ETSO-C147a) Appendix 1.

In spite of all this, most of the manufacturers do not take the above-mentioned opportunities to make simplified devices. As a result of market forces, many TAS systems operate just like TCAS I (with interference limiting, using TCAS I symbology, etc.), with some having even have better surveillance performance (in range and tracked aircraft) and specifications than TCAS I.

== Relationship to automatic dependent surveillance – broadcast (ADS–B) ==
Automatic dependent surveillance – broadcast (ADS–B) messages are transmitted from aircraft equipped with suitable transponders, containing information such as identity, location, and velocity. The signals are broadcast on the 1090 MHz radio frequency. ADS-B messages are also carried on a universal access transceiver (UAT) in the 978 MHz band.

TCAS equipment which is capable of processing ADS–B messages may use this information to enhance the performance of TCAS, using techniques known as &quot;hybrid surveillance&quot;. As currently implemented, hybrid surveillance uses reception of ADS–B messages from an aircraft to reduce the rate at which the TCAS equipment interrogates that aircraft. This reduction in interrogations reduces the use of the 1030/1090 MHz radio channel, and will over time extend the operationally useful life of TCAS technology. The ADS–B messages will also allow low cost (for aircraft) technology to provide real time traffic in the cockpit for small aircraft. Currently UAT based traffic uplinks are provided in Alaska and in regions of the East coast of the US.

Hybrid surveillance does not make use of ADS–B&#x27;s aircraft flight information in the TCAS conflict detection algorithms; ADS–B is used only to identify aircraft that can safely be interrogated at a lower rate.

In the future, prediction capabilities may be improved by using the state vector information present in ADS–B messages. Also, since ADS–B messages can be received at greater range than TCAS normally operates, aircraft can be acquired earlier by the TCAS tracking algorithms.

The identity information present in ADS–B messages can be used to label other aircraft on the cockpit display (where present), painting a picture similar to what an air traffic controller would see and improving situational awareness.

== Versions ==

=== TCAS I ===
TCAS I is a cheaper but less capable system than the modern TCAS II system introduced for general aviation use after the FAA mandate for TCAS II in air transport aircraft. TCAS I systems are able to monitor the traffic situation around a plane (to a range of about 40 miles) and offer information on the approximate bearing and altitude of other aircraft. It can also generate collision warnings in the form of a &quot;Traffic Advisory&quot; (TA). The TA warns the pilot that another aircraft is in near vicinity, announcing &quot;Traffic, traffic&quot;, but does not offer any suggested remedy; it is up to the pilot to decide what to do, usually with the assistance of Air Traffic Control. When a threat has passed, the system announces &quot;Clear of conflict&quot;.

=== TCAS II ===

TCAS II is the first system that was introduced in 1989 and is the current generation of instrument warning TCAS, used in the majority of commercial aviation aircraft (see table below). A US Airways 737 was the first aircraft certified with the AlliedBendix (now Honeywell) TCAS II system. It offers all the benefits of TCAS I, but will also offer the pilot direct, vocalized instructions to avoid danger, known as a &quot;Resolution Advisory&quot; (RA). The suggestive action may be &quot;corrective&quot;, suggesting the pilot change vertical speed by announcing, &quot;Descend, descend&quot;, &quot;Climb, climb&quot; or &quot;Level off, level off&quot; (meaning reduce vertical speed). By contrast a &quot;preventive&quot; RA may be issued which simply warns the pilots not to deviate from their present vertical speed, announcing, &quot;Monitor vertical speed&quot; or &quot;Maintain vertical speed, Maintain&quot;. TCAS II systems coordinate their resolution advisories before issuing commands to the pilots, so that if one aircraft is instructed to descend, the other will typically be told to climb – maximising the separation between the two aircraft.

As of 2006, the only implementation that meets the ACAS II standards set by ICAO was Version 7.0 of TCAS II, produced by three avionics manufacturers: Rockwell Collins, Honeywell, and ACSS (Aviation Communication &amp; Surveillance Systems; an L3Harris and Thales Avionics joint venture company).

After the 2002 Überlingen mid-air collision (July 1, 2002), studies have been made to improve TCAS II capabilities. Following extensive Eurocontrol input and pressure, a revised TCAS II Minimum Operational Performance Standards (MOPS) document has been jointly developed by RTCA (Special Committee SC-147) and EUROCAE. As a result, by 2008 the standards for Version 7.1 of TCAS II have been issued and published as RTCA DO-185B (June 2008) and EUROCAE ED-143 (September 2008).

TCAS II Version 7.1 will be able to issue RA reversals in coordinated encounters, in case one of the aircraft doesn&#x27;t follow the original RA instructions (Change proposal CP112E). Other changes in this version are the replacement of the ambiguous &quot;Adjust Vertical Speed, Adjust&quot; RA with the &quot;Level off, Level off&quot; RA, to prevent improper response by the pilots (Change proposal CP115).; and the improved handling of corrective/preventive annunciation and removal of green arc display when a positive RA weakens solely due to an extreme low or high altitude condition (1000 feet AGL or below, or near the aircraft top ceiling) to prevent incorrect and possibly dangerous guidance to the pilot (Change proposal CP116).

Studies conducted for Eurocontrol, using recently recorded operational data, indicate that currently the probability of a mid-air collision for each flight hour in European airspace is 2.7 x 10−8 which equates to one in every 3 years. When TCAS II Version 7.1 is implemented, that probability will be reduced by a factor of 4.

Although ACAS III is mentioned as a future system in ICAO Annex 10, ACAS III is unlikely to materialize due to difficulties the current surveillance systems have with horizontal tracking. Currently, research is being conducted to develop a future collision avoidance system (under the working name of ACAS X).

=== TCAS III ===
Originally designated TCAS II Enhanced, TCAS III was envisioned as an expansion of the TCAS II concept to include horizontal resolution advisory capability. TCAS III was the &quot;next generation&quot; of collision avoidance technology which underwent development by aviation companies such as Honeywell. TCAS III incorporated technical upgrades to the TCAS II system, and had the capability to offer traffic advisories and resolve traffic conflicts using &quot;horizontal&quot; as well as vertical manoeuvring directives to pilots. For instance, in a head-on situation, one aircraft might be directed, &quot;turn right, climb&quot; while the other would be directed &quot;turn right, descend.&quot; This would act to further increase the total separation between aircraft, in both horizontal and vertical aspects. Horizontal directives would be useful in a conflict between two aircraft close to the ground where there may be little if any vertical maneuvering space.

TCAS III attempted to use the TCAS directional antenna to assign a bearing to other aircraft, and thus be able to generate a horizontal maneuver (e.g. turn left or right). However, it was judged by the industry to be unfeasible due to limitations in the accuracy of the TCAS directional antennas. The directional antennas were judged not to be accurate enough to generate an accurate horizontal-plane position, and thus an accurate horizontal resolution. By 1995, years of testing and analysis determined that the concept was unworkable using available surveillance technology (due to the inadequacy of horizontal position information), and that horizontal RAs were unlikely to be invoked in most encounter geometries. Hence, all work on TCAS III was suspended and there are no plans for its implementation. The concept has later evolved and been replaced by TCAS IV.

=== TCAS IV ===
TCAS IV uses additional information encoded by the target aircraft in the Mode S transponder reply (i.e. target encodes its own position into the transponder signal) to generate a horizontal resolution to an RA. In addition, some reliable source of position (such as Inertial Navigation System or GPS) is needed on the target aircraft in order for it to be encoded.

TCAS IV had replaced the TCAS III concept by the mid-1990s. One of the results of TCAS III experience was that the directional antenna used by the TCAS processor to assign a bearing to a received transponder reply was not accurate enough to generate an accurate horizontal position, and thus a safe horizontal resolution. TCAS IV used additional position information encoded on an air-to-air data link to generate the bearing information, so that the accuracy of the directional antenna would not be a factor.

TCAS IV development continued for some years, but the appearance of new trends in data link such as Automatic Dependent Surveillance – Broadcast (ADS-B) have pointed out a need to re-evaluate whether a data link system dedicated to collision avoidance such as TCAS IV should be incorporated into a more generic system of air-to-air data link for additional applications. As a result of these issues, the TCAS IV concept was abandoned as ADS-B development started.

== Current implementation ==
Although the system occasionally suffers from false alarms, pilots are now under strict instructions to regard all TCAS messages as genuine alerts demanding an immediate, high-priority response. Only Windshear Detection and GPWS alerts and warnings have higher priority than the TCAS. The FAA, EASA and most other countries&#x27; authorities&#x27; rules state that in the case of a conflict between TCAS RA and air traffic control (ATC) instructions, the TCAS RA always takes precedence. This is mainly because of the TCAS-RA inherently possessing a more current and comprehensive picture of the situation than air traffic controllers, whose radar/transponder updates usually happen at a much slower rate than the TCAS interrogations.
If one aircraft follows a TCAS RA and the other follows conflicting ATC instructions, a collision can occur, such as the July 1, 2002 Überlingen disaster. In this mid-air collision, both airplanes were fitted with TCAS II Version 7.0 systems which functioned properly, but one obeyed the TCAS advisory while the other ignored the TCAS and obeyed the controller; both aircraft descended into a fatal collision.

This accident could have been prevented if TCAS was able to reverse the original RA for one of the aircraft when it detects that the crew of the other one is not following their original TCAS RA, but conflicting ATC instructions instead. This is one of the features implemented in Version 7.1 of TCAS II.

Implementation of TCAS II Version 7.1 has been originally planned to start between 2009 and 2011 by retrofitting and forward fitting all the TCAS II equipped aircraft, with the goal that by 2014 the version 7.0 will be completely phased out and replaced by version 7.1. The FAA and EASA have already published the TCAS II Version 7.1 Technical Standard Order (TSO-C119c and ETSO-C119c, respectively) effective since 2009, based on the RTCA DO-185B and EUROCAE ED-143 standards. On 25 September 2009 FAA issued Advisory Circular AC 20-151A providing guidance for obtaining airworthiness approval for TCAS II systems, including the new version 7.1. On 5 October 2009, the Association of European Airlines (AEA) published a Position Paper showing the need to mandate TCAS II Version 7.1 on all aircraft as a matter of priority. On 25 March 2010, the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) published Notice of Proposed Amendment (NPA) No. 2010-03 pertaining to the introduction of ACAS II software version 7.1. On 14 September 2010, EASA published the Comment Response Document (CRD) to the above-mentioned NPA. Separately, a proposal has been made to amend the ICAO standard to require TCAS II Version 7.1 for compliance with ACAS II SARPs.

ICAO has circulated an amendment for formal member state agreement which recommends TCAS II Change 7.1 adoption by 1 January 2014 for forward fit and 1 January 2017 for retrofit. Following the feedback and comments from airline operators, EASA has proposed the following dates for the TCAS II Version 7.1 mandate in European airspace: forward fit (for new aircraft) 1 March 2012, retrofit (for existing aircraft) 1 December 2015. These dates are proposed dates, subject to further regulatory processes, and are not final until the Implementing Rule has been published.

Among the system manufacturers, by February 2010 ACSS certified Change 7.1 for their TCAS 2000 and Legacy TCAS II systems, and is currently offering Change 7.1 upgrade for their customers. By June 2010 Honeywell published a white paper with their proposed solutions for TCAS II Version 7.1. Rockwell Collins currently announces that their TCAS-94, TCAS-4000 and TSS-4100 TCAS II compliant systems are software upgradeable to Change 7.1 when available.

=== Current limitations ===

While the safety benefits of current TCAS implementations are self-evident, the full technical and operational potential of TCAS is not fully exploited due to limitations in current implementations (most of which will need to be addressed in order to further facilitate the design and implementation of Free flight) and NextGen:
* Most TCAS II issues reported to the Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS) encompass anomalous or erroneous operation of TCAS II equipment, TCAS-induced distraction, airborne conflicts provoked by TCAS, and non-standard use of TCAS.
* Like a controller, TCAS II uses Mode C information to determine vertical separation on other traffic. Should Mode C even temporarily provide erroneous altitude information, an erroneous Resolution Advisory command to climb or descend may result. Unlike a controller, TCAS II cannot query the flight crew to determine if the problem lies with malfunctioning equipment.
* Pilots frequently cite TCAS II related auditory and workload interference with normal cockpit duties.
* Many TCAS incident reports received at the ASRS allege that pilot response to erroneous TCAS commands has promoted a conflict where, initially, none existed. Consider the following near mid-air collision (NMAC) where the TCAS II RA may well have been triggered by the high climb rate of air carrier (Y).
* TCAS is limited to supporting only vertical separation advisories, more complex traffic conflict scenarios may however be more easily and efficiently remedied by also making use of lateral resolution maneuvers; this applies in particular to traffic conflicts with marginal terrain clearance, or conflict scenarios that are similarly restricted by vertical constraints (e.g. in busy RVSM airspace)
* ATC can be automatically informed about resolution advisories issued by TCAS only when the aircraft is within an area covered by a Mode S, or an ADS-B monitoring network. In other cases controllers may be unaware of TCAS-based resolution advisories or even issue conflicting instructions (unless ATC is explicitly informed by cockpit crew members about an issued RA during a high-workload situation), which may be a source of confusion for the affected crews while additionally also increasing pilot work load. In May 2009, Luxembourg, Hungary and the Czech Republic show downlinked RAs to controllers.
* In the above context, TCAS lacks automated facilities to enable pilots to easily report and acknowledge reception of a (mandatory) RA to ATC (and intention to comply with it), so that voice radio is currently the only option to do so, which however additionally increases pilot and ATC workload, as well as frequency congestion during critical situations.
* In the same context, situational awareness of ATC depends on exact information about aircraft maneuvering, especially during conflict scenarios that may possibly cause or contribute to new conflicts by deviating from planned routing, so automatically visualizing issued resolution advisories and recalculating the traffic situation within the affected sector would obviously help ATC in updating and maintaining situational awareness even during unplanned, ad hoc routing changes induced by separation conflicts.
* Today&#x27;s TCAS displays do not provide information about resolution advisories issued to other (conflicting) aircraft, while resolution advisories issued to other aircraft may seem irrelevant to another aircraft, this information would enable and help crews to assess whether other aircraft (conflicting traffic) actually comply with RAs by comparing the actual rate of (altitude) change with the requested rate of change (which could be done automatically and visualized accordingly by modern avionics), thereby providing crucial realtime information for situational awareness during highly critical situations.
* TCAS displays today are often primarily range-based, as such they only show the traffic situation within a configurable range of miles/feet, however under certain circumstances a &quot;time-based&quot; representation (i.e. within the next xx minutes) might be more intuitive.
* Lack of terrain/ground and obstacle awareness (e.g. connection to TAWS, including MSA sector awareness), which might be critical for creating feasible (non-dangerous, in the context of terrain clearance) and useful resolution advisories (i.e. prevent extreme descent instructions if close to terrain), to ensure that TCAS RAs never facilitate CFIT (Controlled Flight into Terrain) scenarios.
* Aircraft performance in general and current performance capabilities in particular (due to active aircraft configuration) are not taken into account during the negotiation and creation of resolution advisories (as it is the case for differences between different types of aircraft, e.g. turboprop/jet vs. helicopters), so that it is theoretically possible that resolution advisories are issued that demand climb or sink rates outside the normal/safe flight envelope of an aircraft during a certain phase of flight (i.e. due to the aircraft&#x27;s current configuration). Furthermore, as all traffic is being dealt with equally, there&#x27;s no distinction taking place between different types of aircraft, neglecting the option of exploiting aircraft-specific (performance) information to issue customized and optimized instructions for any given traffic conflict (i.e. by issuing climb instructions to those aircraft that can provide the best climb rates, while issuing descend instructions to aircraft providing comparatively better sink rates, thereby hopefully maximizing altitude change per time unit, that is separation). As an example, TCAS can order an aircraft to climb when it is already at its service ceiling for its current configuration.
* TCAS is primarily extrapolation-oriented, as such it is using algorithms trying to approximate 4D trajectory prediction using the &quot;flight path history&quot;, in order to assess and evaluate the current traffic situation within an aircraft&#x27;s proximity, however the degree of data- reliability and usefulness could be significantly improved by enhancing said information with limited access to relevant flight plan information, as well as to relevant ATC instructions to get a more comprehensive picture of other traffic&#x27;s (route) plans and intentions, so that flight path predictions would no longer be merely based on estimations but rather &quot;actual&quot; aircraft routing (FMS flight plan) and ATC instructions. If TCAS is modified to use data that are used by other systems, care will be required to ensure that the risks of common failure modes are sufficiently small.
* TCAS is not fitted to many smaller aircraft mainly due to the high costs involved (between $25,000 and $150,000). Many smaller personal business jets for example, are currently not legally required to have TCAS installed, even though they fly in the same airspace as larger aircraft that are required to have proper TCAS equipment on board. The TCAS system can only perform at its true operational potential once all aircraft in any given airspace have a properly working TCAS unit on board.
* TCAS requires that both conflicting aircraft have transponders. If one aircraft doesn&#x27;t have a transponder, then it will not alert TCAS as there is no information being transmitted.

To overcome some of these limitations, the FAA is developing a new collision avoidance logic based on dynamic programming.

In response to a series of midair collisions involving commercial airliners, Lincoln Laboratory was directed by the Federal Aviation Administration in the 1970s to participate in the development of an onboard collision avoidance system. In its current manifestation, the Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System is mandated worldwide on all large aircraft and has significantly improved the safety of air travel, but major changes to the airspace planned over the coming years will require substantial modification to the system.

==== ACAS X ====
A set of new systems called ACAS X will use this new logic:
* ACAS Xa will be a direct replacement for TCAS II, using active surveillance
* ACAS Xo will be collision avoidance tuned to work in some currently difficult operational situations, notably closely spaced parallel approaches.
* ACAS Xu will allow multiple sensor inputs and be optimised for unmanned airborne systems.
* ACAS Xp will be designed for aircraft with only passive surveillance (ADS-B).

The first FAA-scheduled industry meeting was held in October 2011 in Washington DC, to brief avionics manufacturers on the development plans for &quot;ACAS X&quot; – including flight demonstrations scheduled for fiscal 2013. The FAA says its work &quot;will be foundational to the development of minimum operational performance standards&quot; for ACAS X by standards developer RTCA.

It is estimated that, if ACAS X will be further developed and certified, ACAS X will not be commercially available before the mid 2020s. And it is said to be unclear at this stage whether ACAS X would provide any horizontal resolutions.

Airbus and Honeywell have tested a proposed automated system, where if the pilot ignored a Resolution Advisory, the aircraft&#x27;s autopilot would automatically take evasive action.

<text>Barysaw or Borisov (, ; , ) is a city in Minsk Region, Belarus. It serves as the administrative center of Barysaw District. It is located on the Berezina River and north-east from the capital Minsk. As of 2024, it has a population of 135,696.

==History==
===Early history===
Barysaw is first mentioned in the Laurentian Codex as being founded (as Borisov) in 1102 by the Prince of Polotsk Rogvolod Vseslavich, who had the baptismal name of Boris. During the next two centuries, it was burned and then rebuilt south of where it was before.

===Under Lithuania===
From the late 13th century to 1795, the town was part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, which was part of the Polish-Lithuanian union since the Union of Krewo (1385) and the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth after the Union of Lublin (1569).

In 1500, during the Lithuanian–Muscovite War, Alexander Jagiellon resided in Barysaw Castle. In 1563, it was granted Magdeburg town rights by King Sigismund II Augustus.

In the last years of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, troops were stationed here, including the 2nd and 4th Lithuanian Vanguard Regiments and 1st Lithuanian Infantry Regiment. King Stanisław August Poniatowski established the town&#x27;s coat of arms (decree #17435), the top half containing the coat of arms of Minsk, while the lower half had two stylized towers on a silver background with a passage between them and Saint Peter above the towers holding a key in his hand.

Barysaw became part of the Russian Empire in 1793 as a result of the Second Partition of Poland.

===19th century===
After the Partitions of Poland, Barysaw was an uyezd town in the Minsk Governorate.

In 1812, Barysaw became a crucial location when Napoleon&#x27;s troops crossed the Berezina river. The French feinted a crossing at the town itself, but successfully escaped the pursuing armies by building two wooden bridges north of the city, at Studianka. This event is reenacted by military locals during town festivals. A cannon from the Napoleonic era is kept by the town&#x27;s museum.

In 1871, the railway between Brest and Moscow passed near Barysaw, and a station was built there. In 1900 the area around the station was annexed the town.
===20th century===
During World War I, after the fall of Tsarist Russia, fights broke out for control of the city and it changed owners several times. In November 1917 the area became a part of Soviet Russia, from early 1918 it was occupied by Germany, in December 1918 it fell to the Soviets again, from 1919 to 1920 it was controlled by Poland, before being captured by the Soviets for the third time.

Soviet rule was recognized by the Peace of Riga in 1921 and the city was included in the Belarusian Soviet Socialist Republic.

During World War II, Barysaw was occupied by Nazi Germany from 2 July 1941 to 1 July 1944, and most of the city was destroyed. The Germans also operated the Dulag 126, Dulag 184, Dulag 240 and Stalag VI-H prisoner-of-war camps in the city.

Since May 1948 the city has been home to the headquarters of the 7th Tank Army, which became the 65th Army Corps and then the North Western Operational Command of the Armed Forces of Belarus in 2001. In 2000s the Head of City Administration, or Mayor, was Vassily Burgun.

<doc id="760813" wikidata="Q1347787" url="?curid=760813" title="Epyx">
<text>Epyx, Inc. was a video game developer and video game publisher active in the late 1970s and 1980s. The company was founded as Automated Simulations by Jim Connelley and Jon Freeman, originally using Epyx as a brand name for action-oriented games before renaming the company to match in 1983. Epyx published a long series of games through the 1980s. The company&#x27;s assets are currently owned by Bridgestone Multimedia Group Global.

==History==

===Formation===
In 1977, Susan Lee-Merrow invited Jon Freeman to join a &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; game hosted by Jim Connelley and Jeff Johnson. Connelley later purchased a Commodore PET computer to help with the bookkeeping involved in being a dungeon master, and he came up with the idea of writing a computer game for the machine before the end of the year so he could write it off on his taxes. Freeman had written on gaming for several publications, and he joined Connelley in the design of a new space-themed wargame. Starting work around August 1978, Freeman wrote the basic rules, mission sets, background stories and the manual, while Connelley coded up the system in PET BASIC.

===The BASIC era===
The two formed Automated Simulations around Thanksgiving 1978 to market the game, and released it in December as &quot;Starfleet Orion&quot;. Examining contemporary magazines (&quot;Byte&quot; and &quot;Creative Computing&quot;) suggests this is the first commercial space-themed wargame for a personal computer. As the game was written in BASIC, it was easy to port to other home computers of the era, starting with the TRS-80 and then the Apple II, the latter featuring rudimentary graphics. They followed this game with 1979&#x27;s &quot;Invasion Orion&quot;, which included a computer opponent so as not to require two human players.

The company&#x27;s next release, &quot;Temple of Apshai&quot;, was very successful, selling over 20,000 copies. As the game was not a &quot;simulation&quot; of anything, the company introduced the Epyx brand name for these more action-oriented titles. Rated as the best computer game by practically every magazine of the era, &quot;Apshai&quot; was soon ported from the TRS-80 to additional systems, such as the Atari 8-bit computers and Commodore 64. &quot;Apshai&quot; spawned a number of similar adventure games based on the same game engine, including two direct sequels, branded under the &quot;Dunjonquest&quot; label. The games were so successful that they were later re-released in 1985 as the &quot;Temple of Apshai Trilogy&quot;.

Using the same BASIC game engine, a series of &quot;semi-action&quot; games followed under the Epyx brand, including &quot;Crush, Crumble and Chomp!&quot;, &quot;Rescue at Rigel&quot;, and &quot;Star Warrior&quot;, each of which added twists to the &quot;Apshai&quot; engine.

===Growth and action focus===

Freeman became increasingly frustrated by Connelley&#x27;s refusal to update the game engine. He left the company to start Free Fall Associates in 1981, leaving Connelley to lead what was now a large company.

A year later, Epyx was starting to have financial difficulties. Jim Connelley wanted and received money through venture capital, and the venture capitalists installed Michael Katz to manage the company. Connelley clashed with new management, left Epyx, and formed his own development team, The Connelley Group, with all of the programmers going with him, but continued to work under the Epyx umbrella.

With no programmers to develop any games in-house, Michael Katz needed to hire programmers to ensure a steady supply of games. Several venture capital owners involved in Epyx also had ownership of a company called Starpath. While Starpath had several young programmers and hardware engineers, they were facing financial difficulties as well. Around this time, an independent submission to publish a game called &quot;Jumpman&quot; came through and was a big hit for Epyx. The success of Jumpman made Epyx a lot of money, so Michael Katz had the capital to create a merger between Epyx and Starpath, bringing Starpath&#x27;s programmers and hardware engineers under the same company. Michael Katz left Epyx in 1984 after being hired away by Atari Corporation as their President of Entertainment Electronics Division (and later, became the President of Sega of America), and was replaced by Gilbert Freeman (no relation to Jon Freeman).

By 1983 Epyx discontinued its older games because, Jerry Pournelle reported, &quot;its managers tell me that arcade games so outsell strategic games that it just isn&#x27;t cost-effective to put programmer time on strategy.&quot; By early 1984, &quot;InfoWorld&quot; estimated that Epyx was the world&#x27;s 16th-largest microcomputer-software company, with $10 million in 1983 sales. Many successful action games followed, including the hits &quot;Impossible Mission&quot; and the sports game &quot;Summer Games&quot;. The latter created a long run of successful sequels, including &quot;Summer Games II&quot;, &quot;Winter Games&quot;, &quot;California Games&quot;, and &quot;World Games&quot;. The company produced games based on licenses of &quot;Hot Wheels&quot;, &quot;G.I. Joe&quot;, and &quot;Barbie&quot;. In Europe, U.S. Gold published Epyx games for the Commodore 64, and also ported many of the games to other major European platforms such as the ZX Spectrum and Amstrad CPC.

For the Commodore 64, Epyx made the Fast Load cartridge which enables a fivefold speedup of floppy disk drive accesses through Commodore&#x27;s very slow serial interface. Another hardware product was the Epyx 500XJ Joystick, which uses high-quality microswitches and a more ergonomic than the standard Atari CX40 joystick while remaining compatible.

Starting in 1986, Epyx realized that the Commodore 64 was starting to show its age, and they needed to think about the future of the company. They hired Dave Morse to explore the next generation of consoles and computers and to learn about their strengths. David&#x27;s son wanted his father to come up with a portable game system, so he had a meeting with former colleagues at Amiga Corporation, RJ Mical and Dave Needle, to see if there was a way to design a portable gaming system. Internally, the handheld gaming system they were working on was called the Handy. Unable to continue due to high costs, it was sold to Atari Corporation which brought it to market in 1989 as the Atari Lynx.

===Litigation===
In 1987, Epyx faced an important copyright infringement lawsuit from Data East USA regarding Epyx&#x27;s Commodore 64 video game &quot;World Karate Championship&quot;. Data East thought the whole game, and particularly the depiction of the referee, looked too much like its 1984 arcade game &quot;Karate Champ&quot;. Data East won at the US District Court level and Judge William Ingram ordered Epyx to recall all copies of &quot;World Karate Championship&quot;. Epyx appealed the case to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, who reversed the judgment and ruled in favor of Epyx, stating that copyright protection did not extend to the idea of a tournament karate game, but specific artistic choices not dictated by that idea. The Court noted that a &quot;17.5 year-old boy&quot; could see clear differences between the elements of each game actually subject to copyright.

===Bankruptcy and asset sales===
Epyx had become heavily dependent on the Commodore 64 market, which accounted for the bulk of its revenues most years, but by 1988 the C64 was an aging machine now in its sixth year and the focus of computer gaming was shifting to PC compatibles and 16-bit machines. Although the console market, dominated by the Nintendo Entertainment System, was highly lucrative, Epyx objected to Nintendo&#x27;s strict rules and licensing policies and instead initiated a failed attempt to develop their own game console.

Epyx was unable to fulfill its contract with Atari to finish developing Lynx hardware and software, and the latter withheld payments that the former needed. By the end of 1989, Epyx discontinued developing computer games, began making only console games, and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. According to Stephen Landrum, a long-time game programmer at Epyx, the company went bankrupt &quot;because it never really understood why it had been successful in the past, and then decided to branch out in a lot of directions, all of which turned out to be failures.&quot;

Epyx had shrunk from 145 employees in 1988 to fewer than 20 by the end of 1989. After emerging from bankruptcy the company resumed game development but only for the Lynx, with Atari acting as publisher. In 1993, with eight employees left, they decided just to sell off the rest of the company. Bridgestone Media Group eventually acquired the rights the rest of Epyx&#x27;s assets. Job offers were extended to the eight remaining employees, but only Peter Engelbrite accepted.

In 2006, British publisher System 3 announced it had licensed certain Epyx&#x27;s assets on a time limited basis to release games such as &quot;California Games&quot; and &quot;Impossible Mission&quot; for Nintendo DS, PlayStation Portable, and Wii in 2007.

<text>Yehoshua Sobol, sometimes written Joshua Sobol (; born 24 August 1939), is an Israeli playwright, writer, and theatre director.

==Biography==
Yehoshua Sobol was born in Tel Mond. His mother&#x27;s family fled the pogroms in Europe in 1922 and his father&#x27;s family immigrated from Poland in 1934 to escape the Nazis.
Sobol is married to Edna, set and costume designer. They have a daughter, Neta, and a son, Yahli Sobol, a singer and writer. Sobol studied at the Sorbonne, Paris, and graduated with a diploma in philosophy. Born to a secular Jewish family, he identifies as an atheist.

==Theatre career==
Sobol&#x27;s first play was performed in 1971 by the Municipal Theatre in Haifa, where Sobol worked from 1984 to 1988 as a playwright and later assistant artistic director. The performance of his play &quot;The Jerusalem Syndrome&quot;, in January 1988, led to widespread protests, whereupon Sobol resigned from his post as artistic director.

In 1983, after the Haifa production of his play &quot;Weininger&#x27;s Night&quot; (The Soul of a Jew), he was invited to participate in the official part of the Edinburgh Festival. Between 1983 and 1989 Sobol wrote three related plays: &quot;Ghetto&quot;, &quot;Adam&quot; and &quot;Underground&quot;, which constitute together The Ghetto triptich.

&quot;Ghetto&quot; premiered in Haifa in May 1984. It won the David&#x27;s Harp award for best play. That year, Peter Zadek&#x27;s German version of the play was chosen by &quot;Theatre Heute&quot; as best production and best foreign play of the year. It has since been translated into more than 20 languages and performed in more than 25 countries. Following Nicholas Hytner&#x27;s production of the English-language version by David Lan at the Royal National Theatre of Great Britain in 1989, the play won the Evening Standard and the London Critics award for Best Play of the Year and was nominated for the Olivier Award in the same category. It was coldly received in New York, however. In his review of the play in the New York Times, Frank Rich described it as a &quot;tedious stage treatment of the Holocaust.&quot;

Since 1995, Sobol has collaborated with Viennese director Paulus Manker on a number of projects exploring new forms of the theatrical experience.

In 1995, &quot;Der Vater&quot; (The Father) a work by Niklas Frank and Joshua Sobol commissioned for the Wiener Festwochen (Vienna Festival) opened at the Theatre an der Wien under the direction of Paulus Manker. The play is about Niklas Frank&#x27;s father, Hans Frank, who was Hitler’s Governor general in Poland and was hanged in Nuremberg in 1946. In 1996, they created &quot;Alma&quot; for the Wiener Festwochen. &quot;Alma&quot; is a polydrama based on the life of Alma Mahler-Werfel. It played in Vienna for six successive seasons and toured to Venice, Lisbon, Los Angeles, Berlin, Jerusalem and Prague. In the Vienna production, the scenes of Alma’s life were performed simultaneously on all floors and in all rooms of a former Jugendstil sanatorium near Vienna. The guests were invited to abandon the immobilised position of &quot;spectator&quot; in a conventional drama, replace it with the mobile activity of &quot;traveller&quot;, thus partaking in a &quot;theatrical journey&quot;. By choosing the events, the path, and the person to follow after each event, each participant constructed her or his personal version of the &quot;Polydrama&quot;. In 2000, Sobol and Manker created &quot;F@LCO – A CYBER SHOW&quot;, a multimedia musical about the Austrian pop singer Falco. Staged in the former Varieté theatre Ronacher in Vienna, &quot;F@LCO&quot; offered the audience a choice between a more expensive, passive ticket for the boxes or the balconies, from which spectators could only watch the show from distance, or a cheap, &quot;active&quot; ticket on the floor, close to the rostrum (in the shape of @, the Internet &quot;at&quot; symbol) on which the show was performed. This position allowed the active spectator to move around during the show, dance and buy drinks at the bars installed under the catwalks.

<doc id="760828" wikidata="Q474301" url="?curid=760828" title="Myst (series)">
<text>Myst is a franchise centered on a series of adventure video games. The first game in the series, &quot;Myst&quot;, was released in 1993 by brothers Rand and Robyn Miller and their video game company Cyan, Inc. The first sequel to &quot;Myst&quot;, &quot;Riven&quot;, was released in 1997 and was followed by three more direct sequels: &quot;Myst III: Exile&quot; in 2001, &quot;Myst IV: Revelation&quot; in 2004, and &quot;Myst V: End of Ages&quot; in 2005. A spinoff featuring a multiplayer component, &quot;&quot;, was released in 2003 and followed by two expansion packs.

&quot;Myst&quot;″s story concerns an explorer named Atrus who has the ability to write books that serve as links to other worlds, known as Ages. This practice of creating linking books was developed by an ancient civilization known as the D&#x27;ni, whose society crumbled after being ravaged by disease. The player takes the role of an unnamed person referred to as the Stranger and assists Atrus by traveling to other Ages and solving puzzles. Over the course of the series, Atrus writes a new Age for the D&#x27;ni survivors to live on, and players of the games set the course the civilization will follow.

The brothers developed &quot;Myst&quot; after producing award-winning games for children. Drawing on childhood stories, the brothers spent months designing the Ages players would investigate. The name &quot;Myst&quot; came from Jules Verne&#x27;s novel &quot;The Mysterious Island&quot;. After &quot;Riven&quot; was released, Robyn left Cyan to pursue other projects, and Cyan began developing &quot;Uru&quot;; developers Presto Studios and Ubisoft created &quot;Exile&quot; and &quot;Revelation&quot; before Cyan returned to complete the series with &quot;End of Ages&quot;. &quot;Myst&quot; and its sequels were critical and commercial successes, selling more than twelve million copies; the games drove sales of personal computers and CD-ROM drives as well as attracting casual gamers with its nonviolent, methodical gameplay. The video games&#x27; success has led to three published novels in addition to soundtracks, a comic series, and television and movie pitches.

==Plot==

&quot;Myst&quot;″s story begins with the arrival of a people known as the D&#x27;ni on Earth, almost 10,000 years ago. The D&#x27;ni are an ancient race who used a special skill to create magical books that serve as portals to the worlds they describe, known as Ages. The D&#x27;ni build a great city and thriving civilization in caverns. A young geologist from the surface, Anna, stumbled upon the D&#x27;ni civilization. Learning the D&#x27;ni language, Anna becomes known as Ti&#x27;ana and marries a D&#x27;ni named Aitrus; the couple have a son named Gehn. Soon after, D&#x27;ni is ravaged by a plague created by a man named A&#x27;Gaeris. Aitrus sacrifices himself to save his wife and child, killing A&#x27;Gaeris while Ti&#x27;ana and Gehn escape to the surface as the D&#x27;ni civilization falls.

Ti&#x27;ana raises Gehn until he runs away as a teenager, learning the D&#x27;ni Art of writing descriptive books. Ti&#x27;ana also cares for Gehn&#x27;s son, Atrus, until Gehn arrives to teach Atrus the Art. Atrus realizes that his father is reckless and power-hungry, and with the help of Ti&#x27;ana and a young woman, Catherine, Atrus traps Gehn on his Age of Riven with no linking books. Atrus and Catherine marry and have two children, Sirrus and Achenar. The brothers grow greedy, and, after plundering their father&#x27;s Ages, they trap Catherine on Riven. When Atrus returns to investigate, the brothers strand him in a D&#x27;ni cavern before they themselves are trapped by special &quot;prison&quot; books. Through the help of a Stranger, Atrus is freed and sends his benefactor to Riven to retrieve Catherine from the clutches of Gehn. Sirrus and Achenar are punished for their crimes by being imprisoned in separate Ages until they reform.

Atrus writes a new Age called Releeshahn for the D&#x27;ni survivors to rebuild their civilization as he and Catherine settle back on Earth, raising a daughter named Yeesha. As Atrus prepares to take the Stranger to Releeshahn, a mysterious man named Saavedro appears and steals the Releeshahn Descriptive Book. The Stranger follows Saavedro through several Ages (which were used to train Sirrus and Achenar in the art of writing Ages) before finally recovering the book. Ten years later, Atrus asks for the Stranger&#x27;s help in determining if his sons have repented after their lengthy imprisonment; the Stranger saves Yeesha from Sirrus&#x27;s machinations, but Sirrus and a repentant Achenar are killed. D&#x27;ni is not fully restored until the creatures the D&#x27;ni enslaved, known as the Bahro, are freed.

==Games==
==Development==

&quot;Myst&quot; was originally conceptualized by brothers Rand and Robyn Miller. The Millers had created fictional worlds and stories as young children, influenced by the works of authors such as J. R. R. Tolkien, Robert A. Heinlein, and Isaac Asimov. They formed a video game company together called Cyan, Inc.; their first game, called &quot;The Manhole&quot;, won the Software Publishers Association award in 1988 for best use of the digital medium. Cyan produced other games, aimed at children; the Millers eventually decided their next project would be made for adults.

The brothers spent months designing the Ages comprising the game, which were influenced by earlier whimsical &quot;worlds&quot; Cyan had made for children&#x27;s games. The game&#x27;s name, as well as the overall solitary and mysterious atmosphere of the island, was inspired by the book &quot;The Mysterious Island&quot; by Jules Verne. Robyn&#x27;s unfinished novel, &quot;Dunnyhut&quot;, influenced aspects of &quot;Myst&quot;″s story, which was developed bit by bit as the brothers conceptualized the various worlds. As development progressed, the Millers realized that they would need to have even more story and history than would be revealed in the game itself. Realizing that fans would enjoy getting a deeper look at the story not in the games, the Millers produced a rough draft of what would become a novel, &quot;Myst: The Book of Atrus&quot;.

After the enormous response to &quot;Myst&quot;, work quickly began on the next &quot;Myst&quot; game. Cyan moved from their garage to a new office and hired additional programmers, designers, and artists. The game was to ship in late 1996, but the release was pushed back a year. Development costs were between $5 and $10 million, many times &quot;Myst&quot;″s budget. After the release of &quot;Riven&quot;, Robyn Miller left the company to pursue other projects, while Rand stayed behind to work on a &quot;Myst&quot; franchise.

While Rand Miller stated Cyan would not make another sequel to &quot;Myst&quot;, Mattel (then the owner of the &quot;Myst&quot; franchise) offered the task of developing a sequel to several video game companies who created detailed story proposals and technology demonstrations. Presto Studios, makers of the &quot;Journeyman Project&quot; adventure games, was hired to develop &quot;Myst III&quot;. Presto spent millions developing the game and used the studio&#x27;s entire staff to complete the project, which took two and a half years to develop. Soon after &quot;Myst III: Exile&quot; was released, Presto was shut down, and &quot;Exile&quot; publisher Ubisoft developed the sequel, &quot;Myst IV: Revelation&quot;, internally. Meanwhile, Cyan produced the spinoff title &quot;&quot;, which included an aborted multiplayer component allowing players to cooperatively solve puzzles.

Cyan returned to produce what was billed as the final game in the series, discarding live action sequences embedded in prerendered graphics for a world rendered in real time. The actors&#x27; faces were turned into textures and mapped onto digital characters, with the actor&#x27;s actions synchronized by motion capture. Shortly before release, Cyan closed down development, although this did not impact the release of the game; the company was able to rehire its employees a few weeks later, and continued to work on non-&quot;Myst&quot; projects and an attempted resurrection of &quot;Uru&quot;″s multiplayer component, &quot;&quot;. Servers paid for by donation were set up in 2010, and the game went open-source in 2011.

Among the detailed elements of the &quot;Myst&quot; universe Cyan created was the language and culture of the D&#x27;ni. The civilization&#x27;s numbers and writing first appeared in &quot;Riven&quot;, and were important to solving some of the game&#x27;s puzzles. The D&#x27;ni language was the language presented in various games and novels of the &quot;Myst&quot; franchise, created by Richard A. Watson. Several online D&#x27;ni dictionaries have been developed as part of the ongoing fan-based culture associated with the game.

==Music==

The music for each game in the &quot;Myst&quot; series has fallen to various composers. Originally, the Millers believed that any music or sound besides ambient noise would distract the player from the game and ruin the sense of reality; &quot;Myst&quot;, therefore, was to have no music at all. A sound test eventually persuaded the developers that music heightened the sense of immersion rather than lessening it, and as such Robyn Miller composed 40 minutes of synthesized music for the game. He would also produce the music for &quot;Riven&quot;, which featured leitmotifs for each of the main characters. Virgin Records bought the rights to the music and produced the soundtracks, which were released in 1998.

For &quot;Myst III: Exile&quot; and &quot;Myst IV: Revelation&quot;, composer Jack Wall created the music, developing a more active musical style different from Miller&#x27;s ambient themes. Wall looked at the increasing complexity of games as an opportunity to give players a soundtrack with as much force as a movie score, and tried to create a distinctive sound that was still recognizable as &quot;Myst&quot; music. In &quot;Revelation&quot;, Wall adapted the themes for the recurring characters of &quot;Myst&quot;, and collaborated with Peter Gabriel, who provided a song to the game as well as voicework.

The music for &quot;Uru: Ages Beyond Myst&quot; and &quot;Myst V: End of Ages&quot; was composed by Tim Larkin, who had gotten involved in the series doing sound design for &quot;Riven&quot;. Larkin stepped away from his background as a jazz composer and musician to create music with less structure and without a definite beginning and end. Larkin created different music depending on the location, giving each setting and Age a distinctive tone. For &quot;End of Ages&quot;, Larkin was unable to afford a full orchestra to perform his score, so he combined individual instrumentation with an array of synthesizers.

==Adaptations==
Rand and Robyn Miller both wanted to develop &quot;Myst&quot;″s back story into novels. After the success of &quot;Myst&quot;, publisher Hyperion signed a three-book, US$1 million deal with the brothers. David Wingrove worked from the Miller brothers&#x27; story outlines. The three books — &quot;Myst: The Book of Atrus&quot;, &quot;Myst: The Book of Ti&#x27;ana&quot;, and &quot;Myst: The Book of D&#x27;ni&quot; — were released in 1995, 1996, and 1997, respectively. The books were later packaged together as &quot;The Myst Reader&quot;. A fourth novel, &quot;Myst: The Book of Marrim&quot;, was planned but has not surfaced.

Cyan partnered with Dark Horse Comics in 1993 to release a four-part comic series called &quot;Myst: The Book of Black Ships&quot;. The series would have focused on Atrus and his young sons, taking place before the events of &quot;Myst&quot;. The first issue was released on September 3, 1997, but further books were canceled after Cyan decided the first issue did not live up to expectations. Another comic, &quot;Myst #0: Passages&quot;, was later released online.

Disney approached Cyan Worlds about constructing a theme park inspired by &quot;Myst&quot;, which included scouting an island area within Disney&#x27;s Florida properties that Rand Miller felt was perfect for the &quot;Myst&quot; setting. 

Various proposals for films and television series based on the franchise were planned or rumored but never came to fruition. They include:
* The Sci Fi Channel announced a TV miniseries in 2002, but it never materialized. According to Rand Miller, none of the various proposals met Cyan&#x27;s approval, or were too formulaic or silly. 
*Independent filmmakers Patrick McIntire and Adrian Vanderbosch wanted to produce a motion picture based on the story revealed in the &quot;Myst&quot; novels and in 2006 sent a DVD proposal to Cyan The film was set to be based on the novel &quot;Myst: The Book of Ti&#x27;ana&quot;, but no longer appears to be in production.
* In 2014, Legendary Entertainment announced that it was developing a television series based on &quot;Myst&quot;, but nothing came of it.

In May 2015, &quot;Unwritten: Adventures in the Ages of MYST and Beyond&quot; was published by Inkworks Productions as an authorized, Myst-based pencil-and-paper role-playing game. Unwritten was built on the popular Fate Core RPG system with a focus on investigation and non-violent adventure. Two small supplements exist as background for game-players: The D&#x27;Ni Primer explaining the history of the D&#x27;Ni, and The Myst Saga giving a chronology of the Myst series.

In 2016, Cyan Worlds released the Kickstarter-backed &quot;Obduction&quot;. While &quot;Obduction&quot; is not narratively linked to &quot;Myst&quot;, the game was considered by Rand Miller to be a spiritual successor to the &quot;Myst&quot; series, borrowing several of its themes and puzzle-design approaches, as well as incorporating full-motion video in homage to &quot;Myst&quot;. Robyn, who had left Cyan before this point, collaborated to help score the game and take on the role of one of the in-game characters.

In anticipation of the first game&#x27;s 25th anniversary in September 2018, Cyan Worlds secured the necessary rights to release all of the &quot;Myst&quot; games, updated for modern Windows systems with assistance of GOG.com to be released as a collected physical collectors edition. Further, Cyan launched a Kickstarter in April 2018 to provide digital copies of the seven games as well as backer rewards including a simulated Linking Book, using an LCD screen inserted into a book binding. The Kickstarter was successfully funded, bringing in on a target goal.

On June 26, 2019, Village Roadshow Entertainment Group announced that they have acquired the rights to the franchise and plans to expand its mythology to develop a multi-platform universe that includes movies and TV series. They will work alongside Miller and his brother Ryan as well as Isaac Testerman and Yale Rice of Delve Media.

==Reception and impact==
Overall, the &quot;Myst&quot; series has been critically and commercially successful. Rand and Robyn Miller were expecting &quot;Myst&quot; to perform as well as previous Cyan titles, making enough money to fund the next project. Instead, &quot;Myst&quot; sold more than six million units, becoming the top-selling PC game of all time until &quot;The Sims&quot; surpassed &quot;Myst&quot; sales in 2002. The first three games in the series have sold more than twelve million copies.

1UP.com writer Jeremy Parish noted that there have been two main opinions of &quot;Myst&quot;″s slow, puzzle-based gameplay; &quot;Fans consider &quot;Myst&quot; an elegant, intelligent game for grown-ups, while detractors call it a soulless stroll through a digital museum, more art than game.&quot; Game industry executives were confused by &quot;Myst&quot;″s success, not understanding how an &quot;interactive slide show&quot; turned out to be a huge hit. Online magazine writer Russell Pitts of &quot;The Escapist&quot; called &quot;Myst&quot; &quot;unlike anything that had come before, weaving video almost seamlessly into a beautifully rendered world, presenting a captivating landscape filled with puzzles and mystery. In a game market dominated by &quot;Doom&quot; clones and simulators, &quot;Myst&quot; took us by the hand and showed us the future of gaming. It took almost a decade for anyone to follow its lead.&quot; Critics from &quot;Wired&quot; and &quot;Salon&quot; considered the games approaching the level of art, while authors Henry Jenkins and Lev Manovich pointed out the series as exemplifying the promise of new media to create unseen art forms.

The series caused a major shift in the adventure game genre. Unlike previous games, &quot;Myst&quot; attempted to keep players immersed in the world by removing all information not associated with the fictional world itself—no explanatory text, inventory, or score counters. &quot;Myst&quot; has also been cited as the reason for the decline of the adventure game genre; eager to capitalize on &quot;Myst&quot;″s success, publishers churned out mediocre &quot;Myst&quot; clones, which flooded the market. By &quot;Exile&quot;″s release, games like &quot;Myst&quot; were considered to be an &quot;antiquated&quot; form of gaming by some critics.

The title was widely credited as one of the first games to appeal not just to hardcore gamers but to casual players and demographics that generally did not play games, such as women. &quot;Myst&quot;″s lack of conventional game elements—violence, dying, and failure—appealed to nongamers and those contemplating buying a computer. The Millers&#x27; decision to develop &quot;Myst&quot; for the nascent CD-ROM format helped boost interest and adoption of disc drives.

The game inspired a CD parody game called &quot;Pyst&quot;, written by comedian Peter Bergman and featured John Goodman in video scenes. Players traveled across the spoiled island of Myst after millions of players walked over it, with the parody game poking fun at elements of the prototype.

==Fan conventions==

The game has spawned annual fan conventions around the world. Mysterium has been held since 2000, which grew out of the plans of a small group of fans who wanted to meet in person. Approximately 200 people attended the meeting in Spokane, Washington, which was held at the headquarters of Cyan Worlds, developers of the game. Subsequent conventions have been more formally planned, involving presentations and live music. Similar to Mysterium, Mystralia is a gathering for Australia and New Zealand and has been held since 2005.

<text>Kayne Taylor is a pop music singer from Melbourne, Victoria who won the 2004 Australian series of &quot;Popstars Live&quot;. Taylor started singing in 1994 and can also play bass and guitar.

==&quot;Popstars Live&quot;==
Taylor was working for Australia Post when a friend dared him to audition. He did so, becoming a finalist and then the winner. On &quot;Popstars Live: The Finalists&quot;, Taylor covered &quot;Jealous Guy&quot;, first performed by John Lennon and later an Australian number one hit for Roxy Music in 1981. Taylor&#x27;s show-stopping performance of the INXS song &quot;Never Tear Us Apart&quot; was considered by many to be his finest moment. Other standouts included his unique rendition of &quot;It&#x27;s Raining Men&quot;, as well as the Kylie Minogue and Jason Donovan duet &quot;Especially for You&quot;, which was performed, strangely, as a solo.

After winning the series, Taylor entered the studios in early June 2004 to record a debut album. The first single &quot;Heartbreaker&quot; was released on 21 June 2004 and debuted at No. 8 on the Australian singles charts. He co-wrote the song himself. A planned second single, &quot;City Lights&quot;, and the album were never released.

==Future direction==
Taylor moved on from &quot;Popstars Live&quot; in order to pursue an independent record career. Taylor completed a three-month entertainment contract with the Conrad Hilton in Bangkok. During his time in Bangkok, Taylor got in touch with German producer Leslie Mándoki and subsequently travelled to Germany, where he recorded seven songs in four days. Taylor and Mandoki then began working on Taylor&#x27;s debut album for Europe.

<doc id="760848" wikidata="Q5953248" url="?curid=760848" title="Hybrid logic">
<text>Hybrid logic refers to a number of extensions to propositional modal logic with more expressive power, though still less than first-order logic. In formal logic, there is a trade-off between expressiveness and computational tractability. The history of hybrid logic began with Arthur Prior&#x27;s work in tense logic.

Unlike ordinary modal logic, hybrid logic makes it possible to refer to states (possible worlds) in formulas.

This is achieved by a class of formulas called &quot;nominals&quot;, which are true in exactly one state, and by the use of the @ operator, which is defined as follows:

:&quot;@i p&quot; is true if and only if &quot;p&quot; is true in the unique state named by the nominal &quot;i&quot; (i.e., the state where &quot;i&quot; is true).

Hybrid logics with extra or other operators exist, but @ is more-or-less standard.

Hybrid logics have many features in common with temporal logics (which sometimes use nominal-like constructs to denote specific points in time), and they are a rich source of ideas for researchers in modern modal logic. They also have applications in the areas of feature logic, model theory, proof theory, and the logical analysis of natural language. Hybrid logic is also closely connected to description logic because the use of nominals allows one to perform assertional ABox reasoning, as well as the more standard terminological TBox reasoning.

<doc id="760853" wikidata="Q6112082" url="?curid=760853" title="Jack Dempsey vs. Luis Ángel Firpo">
<text>[[Jack Dempsey]] vs. [[Luis Ángel Firpo]] was a boxing match and one of the most significant events in sports of the era. It was the first time that a Latin American challenged for the world heavyweight title. The bout was named &quot;Ring Magazine&quot; Fight of the Year for 1923. The painting &quot;Dempsey and Firpo&quot; by George Bellows, showing Firpo knocking Dempsey out of the ring, is an iconic piece of Americana.

== Background ==
Firpo was the first Latin American in history to challenge for the world heavyweight title. He burst onto the scene in 1922. None of the results of his from before 1922 were available to most audiences. After going 4–0 in 1922, Firpo began 1923 at Madison Square Garden knocking out former title challenger Bill Brennan in the 12th round with a right. Brennan had to be taken to the hospital afterwards for a concussion. &quot;Dempsey never hit me any harder than this fellow,&quot; said Brennan, adding that he couldn&#x27;t wear his old hat because his head was too swollen. Firpo knocked out former heavyweight champion Jess Willard in front of 100,000 spectators, a world record for boxing attendance at the time. He finally got the title shot after a win against Charley Weinert.

In anticipation for the Dempsey-Firpo bout, a Firpo sparring session drew a crowd of 12,000. The match was at the Polo Grounds, normal capacity 55,000, but an additional 20,000 seats were constructed bringing the total to 75,000 for the fight, later expanded to 83,000. The police estimated that 150,000 people showed up, including a mass extending a quarter mile in every direction around the arena.

== The event ==
Dempsey versus Firpo took place on September 14, 1923, at the Polo Grounds in New York City. Dempsey had been champion since 1919, and Firpo was one of the top heavyweights of the world, nicknamed &quot;El Toro de las Pampas&quot; (&quot;The Wild Bull of the Pampas&quot;). The referee was Johnny Gallagher.

Firpo was floored seven times in the first round of the bout, before he trapped Dempsey against the ropes and launched a combination that sent the champion out of the ring. Dempsey was helped into the ring at the count of nine (in spite of having been seventeen seconds outside the ring; fighters are given a twenty-second count when they are knocked through the ropes). After getting back in the ring Dempsey took 13 consecutive shots from Firpo. In the second round Dempsey rallied and knocked out Firpo. It was named &quot;Ring Magazine&quot; Fight of the Year for 1923.

== Controversies ==
Years later Gene Tunney would say in &quot;Esquire&quot;, &quot;the Dempsey-Firpo fight was the most controversial in boxing history.&quot; Tunney attributed the result to Firpo not having a manager. &quot;After Dempsey had been out of the ring ten seconds, any manager would have been in there, raising Firpo&#x27;s hand and claiming the championship.&quot;

When Dempsey was knocked out of the ring, reporters at ringside helped him back in, a violation of the rules. Years later Dempsey would say &quot;I was down, and if it wasn’t for the public throwing me back in there, I would have never gotten back into the ring.&quot; At the time of the fight &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that news had falsely spread to Buenos Aires that Dempsey had been disqualified.

Dempsey was permitted to stand over the fallen Firpo and immediately knock him down again, as there was yet no rule about going to a neutral corner. The referee, Johnny Gallagher, was still supposed to prevent the fighter from scoring the knockdown by standing directly over his floored opponent. In the aftermath of the fight, Gallagher was suspended after an investigation and never refereed again. 2 months after the fight, the New York Boxing Commission adopted the neutral corner rule.

== The aftermath ==
Dempsey and Firpo both became icons. Dempsey later lost his Heavyweight title to Gene Tunney in two equally historic bouts (see: The Long Count Fight). He served in the military and opened a restaurant in New York before his death in 1983.

Firpo&#x27;s popularity around Latin America was immeasurable. Years later, C.D. Luis Ángel Firpo, a professional football team in El Salvador was named after him. In addition, various schools, streets, and avenues across Latin America have been named after him.
Argentine boxer Oscar Bonavena also fought two great heavyweight champions, losing to Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier, the latter for the NYSAC&#x27;s version of the world heavyweight title. Ultimately, John Ruiz, an American of Puerto Rican descent, became the first boxer of Hispanic and of Latin American descent to win the world Heavyweight title, beating Evander Holyfield in 2001 for the World Boxing Association&#x27;s version of the title.

Firpo died a wealthy man in 1960. His body rests in the La Recoleta Cemetery in Buenos Aires.

== In popular culture ==

In 1923–1924, George Bellows painted &quot;Dempsey and Firpo&quot;, depicting Firpo dropping Dempsey through the ring&#x27;s ropes on their historic fight. (Although the painting seems to depict Firpo hitting Dempsey with a left, this is in fact the follow-through after Firpo&#x27;s right sent Dempsey through the ropes.) In 1950, Firpo&#x27;s second knockdown of Dempsey was named &quot;the most dramatic sports moment of the (20th) century so far&quot;.

Quirino Cristiani adapted the fight in an animated short, &quot;Firpo-Dempsey&quot; (1923).

This is the fight where Clark Gable&#x27;s and William Powell&#x27;s characters meet in the 1934 movie &quot;Manhattan Melodrama&quot;.

In 1935, the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; asked five prominent fighters and others involved in boxing to name the greatest ring battle they ever saw. Three of them- light-heavyweight champion Bob Olin, trainer Doc Robb and Madison Square Garden announcer Clem White- responded with the Dempsey-Firpo fight.

In the play &quot;Twelve Angry Men&quot;, the seventh juror (a sports fan who believes the accused is guilty) suggests to his fellow jurors that if juror No. 8 had been &quot;ringside at the Dempsey-Firpo fight, he&#x27;d be tryin&#x27; to tell us Firpo won&quot; because juror No. 8 is trying to convince the other 11 jurors that the accused may not be guilty. In the 1957 movie version by Sidney Lumet, the fight is also mentioned the same way, though juror No. 7&#x27;s line is cut short, only managing to say that if juror No. 8 had been &quot;ringside at the Dempsey-Firpo fight, he&#x27;d be tryin&#x27; to tell us...&quot; before trailing off and moving on to his next line.

In the 1957 movie &quot;The Spirit of St. Louis&quot;, Charles Lindbergh (portrayed by Jimmy Stewart) receives two film canisters, marked “Dempsey&quot; and &quot;Firpo.”

The fight was mentioned in Steve McQueen&#x27;s &quot;The Sand Pebbles&quot; (1966) during the fight between Po-han and Ski.

The fight is referenced in the 1976 film &quot;Rocky&quot; by character Mickey Goldmill, who says he fought an opponent on the same date. Moreover, challenger Rocky Balboa floors champion Apollo Creed at the very start of the fight, just as Firpo did to Dempsey.

In the &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; episode &quot;Tea and Empathy,&quot; a patient says to Dr. B.J. Hunnicutt, &quot;Hey Doc, remember me?&quot; Hunnicut replies, &quot;Yeah, sure. I sat next to you at the Dempsey-Firpo fight&quot;.

The fight is mentioned in Julio Cortázar&#x27;s short story &quot;Circe&quot;

Produced by Rudy VanderLans (editor and art director) and Zuzana Licko (type designer and typesetter), &quot;Emigre&quot; was known for creating some of the first digital layouts and typeface designs. Exposure to Licko&#x27;s typefaces through the magazine lead to the creation of Emigre Fonts in 1985.

==History==
&quot;Emigre&quot; was a graphic design magazine founded by fellow Dutchmen Marc Susan, Menno Meyjes, and Rudy VanderLans who met in San Francisco. The first four issues were edited by Susan and art directed by VanderLans, with Meyes mostly in an associate publisher role. By issue 6 (1986) Susan and Meyes had left, and all subsequent issues were edited and art directed by VanderLans. In 1985, VanderLans started incorporating the bitmap typefaces designed by Zuzana Licko in his layouts. Licko’s type designs became a prominent feature of the magazine for its entire run. By 1986, Emigre began selling commercial licenses of its digital fonts under the name Emigre Fonts.

The magazine was always self-funded, initially through commercial design work performed by VanderLans and Licko under the name Emigre Graphics which became Emigre Fonts. Additional income came from sporadic advertisement sales and subscriptions. Later issues were funded primarily by licensing of digital typefaces.

When the magazine began in 1984, it featured work by and topics important to émigré artists. The first eight issues were concerned with boundaries, international culture, travel accounts, and alienation (as the issues&#x27; titles suggest). These eight issues also incorporated a dynamic aesthetic that caught the attention of other designers.

As the publication grew in popularity (and sometimes notoriety) it gained collaborators. VanderLans invited guests such as Gail Swanlund, Anne Burdick, Andrew Blauvelt, and Experimental Jetset to edit dedicated issues, and readers began to recognize Jeffery Keedy, Kenneth FitzGerald, Lorraine Wild, and Diane Gromala as recurring contributors.

A notable content shift started with issue 9, which featured the art of Vaughan Oliver at 4AD. About this time, &quot;Emigre&quot;&#x27;s articles began to explore contemporary design practice more intentionally, catalyzing the magazine as a kind of analog discussion forum. Later issues would be devoted to Cranbrook, the Macintosh, type design, and occasionally individual graphic designers. Increasingly, &quot;Emigre&quot;&#x27;s content centered around design writing and critical essays.

Design discourse became primary to &quot;Emigre&quot;&#x27;s publications by 1994, and the magazine transitioned in 1995 from its oversized layout to a text-friendlier format that debuted with issue 33. The magazine remained this size until issue 60, released in 2001. Issues 60–63 were accompanied by additional media: three compact discs (featuring the music of Honey Barbara, The Grassy Knoll and Scenic) and one DVD (&quot;Catfish&quot;, an experimental documentary film on the work of designer and performance artist Elliott Earls). In its fourth and final incarnation, the last six issues of &quot;Emigre&quot; (64–69) were co-published by Princeton Architectural Press as small softcover books. The last issue, The End, was published in 2005.

&quot;Emigre&quot; was one of the first publications to be designed on Macintosh computers, and their work heavily influenced other graphic designers in the early digital era. Its variety of layouts, use of guest designers, and opinionated articles broke away from traditional design practices, making &quot;Emigre&quot; leaders in Postmodern design and landing them squarely in the middle of controversy. They were equally lauded and criticized for this work. Licko&#x27;s response that &quot;You read best what you read most,&quot; to an interview question about the legibility of her experimental bitmap fonts published in issue 15 (1990) incited what would later be known as the &quot;Legibility Wars.&quot; Her statement indicated that fonts such as Helvetica and Times New Roman are not intrinsically legible but become so through repeated use, and it was not entirely well received. In 1991, the prominent New York designer Massimo Vignelli criticized Emigre&#x27;s work, calling it &quot;garbage&quot; and &quot;an aberration of culture&quot; in an interview published by Print magazine. This brought much attention to their work and sealed Emigre&#x27;s reputation as design radicals. Six years later Licko and VanderLans were named AGIA medalists and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art staged a solo exhibition of Emigre&#x27;s work. In 2007, the Museum of Modern Art (New York) exhibited all 69 issues of &quot;Emigre&quot; as part of the exhibition &quot;Digitally Mastered.&quot;

==Formats==
The magazine changed formats several times. It was originally published quarterly in a large format where each page measures 285 mm × 425 mm (slightly shorter than 11 × 17&quot; or US ledger/tabloid size). Starting with issue 33, each page was about 8.5 × 11&quot; (US letter size). It changed into a multimedia format (a booklet where each page was 133 × 210 mm, plus a CD or DVD) starting with issue 60. And finally, starting with issue 64, the magazine became a book format, published semi-annually, where each page measured 133 × 210 mm. The issues in the book format were co-published by Princeton Architectural Press.

Inspired by the flourishing DIY culture in music, and the success and growing reach of Emigre&#x27;s publishing and mail order business, Emigre Music was launched in 1990. A total of 22 albums and compilations were released in CD and cassette formats. The final three CDs were included in issues of &quot;Emigre&quot; magazine.

<text>Brushfield spots are small, white or greyish/brown spots on the periphery of the iris in the human eye due to aggregation of connective tissue, a normal constituent of the iris stroma. The spots are named after the physician Thomas Brushfield, who first described them in his 1924 M.D. thesis.

Brushfield spots are a characteristic feature of the chromosomal disorder Down syndrome or trisomy 21. They occur in 35–78% of newborn infants with Down syndrome. Brushfield spots tend to be obscured by pigmentation of the anterior border layer of the iris in patients with darker irides. Hence, they are much more likely to be observed in children with lightly pigmented eyes. Brushfield spots are more commonly found in Down syndrome patients of European descent than similarly affected children of Asian heritage.

Brushfield spots comprise focal areas of iris stromal hyperplasia, surrounded by relative hypoplasia.

Similar spots described by Krückmann and Wolfflin are found in individuals without Down syndrome. Termed Krückmann-Wolfflin bodies, these spots typically are less well defined, fewer in number and more peripherally located than the Brushfield spots of trisomy 21.

<text>Stephen C. Singer-Brewster (b. 1945) also known as Stephen C. Brewster is an American astronomer.

He is a member of the American Association of Variable Star Observers. He participated in the Palomar Planet Crossing Asteroid Survey (PCAS) as an observer and astrometrist under the direction of American astronomer Eleanor Helin (JPL/Caltech) from 1985 to 1988. During this period, Stephen Brewster was credited with the discovery of 105P/Singer Brewster, a Jupiter-family comet. He also discovered six asteroids including the named main-belt asteroid 4555 Josefapérez and 5253 Fredclifford, a Mars-crosser.

Singer-Brewster has been an active member of Stony Ridge Observatory, Inc. since 1983 and has served on its board of directors. He formed the Faint Object Follow Up (FOFU) project at Stony Ridge in 2000 to encourage observations of faint asteroids and comets.

Eleanor Helin honored him with the naming of the asteroid 10315 Brewster, to acknowledge his work for PCAS, Stony Ridge Observatory, and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). Singer-Brewster is currently a retired member of the staff at JPL. At JPL, he worked on a number of spacecraft missions such as the Pluto Fast Flyby, the Outer Planets/Solar Probe Mission and the Europa Orbiter mission. At the time of his retirement in 2003 he was working in the Mars Advanced Studies Program and the Europa Orbiter/X2000 avionics development project at JPL.

<text>Coopers Brewery Limited, the largest Australian-owned brewery, is based in the Adelaide suburb of Regency Park. Coopers is known for making a variety of beers, the most famous of which are its pale ale and sparkling ale. It is also the world&#x27;s largest producer of homebrewing beer concentrate in cans. Cooper&#x27;s also manufactures DIY kits, reusable plastic bottles, and boxed brew enhancers. Its shares are primarily owned by the extended Cooper family. The brewery has been headed by Tim Cooper (originator of Dr Tim&#x27;s Traditional Ale) as managing director since 1990, with Michael Shearer taking over the role from 1 March 2025. Melanie Cooper has been chair of the board since December 2023.
The brewery was established by Thomas Cooper in 1862 in the eastern Adelaide suburb of Norwood, moving in 1881 to Leabrook, also in the eastern suburbs, and then in 2001 to northern Adelaide at Regency Park. 

==History==

===19th century===
The brewery was established by Thomas Cooper in 1862 at his home in the Adelaide suburb of Norwood. He brewed his first recorded batch on 13 May 1862.

In 1881 the brewery relocated to larger, commercial facilities at Leabrook.

Thomas died in 1897. In his will, after bequests to his wife, daughters and youngest sons, he left all his property to his four eldest surviving sons, John, Christopher, Samuel and Stanley, under instructions to &quot;carry on my business as Brewers under the form of &#x27;Thomas Cooper &amp; Sons&#x27; as partners&quot;.

===20th century===
Each time one of the partners retired or died, a new partnership agreement needed to be drawn up. This became unwieldy, so in 1923, the partners decided to incorporate with limited liability. An agreement was drawn up where the capital of the company was declared as £39,000, and 39,000 £1 shares were distributed. 15,953 of the shares were designated as class &quot;A&quot;, and 15,953 as class &quot;B&quot;. Directors were to be appointed equally by holders of &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; shares.

The company went through the doldrums during the recession of the late 1880s, a boom time in the 1920s, the doldrums during the Great Depression, and mixed fortunes through World War II and the 1950s. By the 1960s, the brewery was still producing much the same products as in the 1880s, but the brewing environment, and consumer demand, had changed.

====1962: South Australian Brewery share swap====
There had been much consolidation of breweries in South Australia since Coopers was established, and the South Australian Brewing Company and Coopers &amp; Sons were the only breweries remaining in Adelaide. As both were attractive takeover targets, in 1962 (after 100 years of Cooper family sole ownership), the two companies decided to do a mutually beneficial share swap in order to reduce the risk of takeover. The traditional South Australian market leader had been the South Australian Brewing Company. The share swap gave SA Brewing a 25% interest in Coopers (&quot;C&quot; and &quot;D&quot; class shares), and Coopers received 291,404 SA Brewing shares (2.65%). The Coopers board of directors was increased from four to five, with SA Brewing&#x27;s &quot;D&quot; shares having the right to elect the fifth director. After consulting the SA Brewing board and receiving their support, Coopers sold their SA Brewing shares in 1984, (at a substantial profit). SA Brewing continued to hold their 25% interest in Coopers.

In the early 1960s, demand for Coopers Ales was flat, had been for years in the past, and looked like it would be for years into the future. The company strongly considered adding a Lager to their range. The older members of the board were highly resistant to such change, and, as this would be in competition with SA Brewing, the new board member was also resistant. It was not until 1967 that the board voted to go ahead with the new plant, with the SA Brewing representative not voting. After 105 years of only brewing ale and stout, &quot;Gold Crown&quot;, Coopers first Lager, was available for sale in 1968.

In 1970, the retail price of a bottle of Coopers ale was 41 cents:
*11.82 cents (28.8%) was brewery costs
*19.55 cents (47.7%) was excise and taxes
*8.75 cents (21.34%) went to the retailer
*0.88 cents (2.16%) was the brewery profit.

====1987: 125th anniversary====
To celebrate the 125th anniversary, the board commissioned Adelaide historian Alison Painter, (wife of John Painter, an engineer employed by Coopers in 1968 to oversee the upgrading of the brewery plant and the reduction in plant maintenance costs), to write &quot;Jolly Good Ale and Old : The history of the Coopers Brewery 1862–1987&quot;.

====1993–1995: Lion Nathan takeover of SA Brewing====
SA Brewing Holdings subsequently diversified into manufacturing and wine, and then refocused to form Southcorp, Southcorp Wines, and SA Brewing. SA Brewing was acquired by trans-Tasman Lion Nathan in 1993. After two years of negotiations, in 1995 family members purchased all of the &quot;D&quot; class shares (with their right to elect a director), and some of the &quot;C&quot; class shares, and Coopers Brewery Ltd purchased the remainder of the &quot;C&quot; class shares.

Thus, SA Brewing had a seat on the Cooper&#x27;s board of directors from 1962 to 1995, but in 1995 the Cooper family once again became sole owners of the company.

===21st century===
====2001: Regency Park====

In 2001, the brewery relocated to much larger premises at Regency Park.

Since 2003, the Regency Park brewery has used a gas turbine based cogeneration plant to supply steam and electric power requirements. Fired with natural gas with a thermal efficiency of 80%, the $6.2 million plant produces power with a 90% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to a separate electricity generation and steam production plant. The plant is operated by AGL Energy and is rated at 4.4 MW. Generation above the brewery&#x27;s electrical load of 1.2 MW is fed back into the grid.

====2005: Lion Nathan takeover bid====
In late 2005, Lion Nathan made an unsolicited takeover bid for Coopers, which was strongly opposed by the board and by the Cooper family. It was ultimately rejected at an Extraordinary General Meeting when the holders of 93.4% of the shares voted in favour of permanently removing the 3rd tier purchasing rights of Lion Nathan, effectively preventing any current or future takeover bid.

Prince Alfred College held 70,000 shares (5%) in Coopers Brewery, which had been received in a bequest. At the time of the unsolicited takeover bid by Lion Nathan, these shares were valued at between $18 million and $22 million and considered to be a possible blocking stake.

With Lion Nathan wholly owned by Kirin Brewing Company since 2009, and Fosters owned by SABMiller since 2011, Coopers is the only wholly Australian-owned major brewery, and the largest.

Coopers released a limited-edition &quot;Celebration Ale&quot; to celebrate the 150th anniversary, as well as celebratory labels on their other beers.

====2017: Bible Society / same-sex marriage issue====
On 9 March 2017 Coopers Brewery launched a limited edition premium beer (in both can and carton) to commemorate the bicentenary of the Bible Society. Public outcry arose over the use of the Coopers Brewery branded beer in a video of the Bible Society debate over the issue of same-sex marriage. Coopers Brewery issued two statements on 12 March 2017 in response to the backlash and also posted a tweet saying they were not trying to push a religious message. Various venues in Melbourne and Sydney subsequently announced they would no longer be stocking Coopers beers. On 14 March Coopers issued a further statement declaring they were cancelling the release of the Bible Society commemorative cans and joining Australian Marriage Equality.

====2022–2024: new visitor centre====
In 2021, Coopers announced an expansion of its warehousing facilities at Regency Park. In April 2022, it announced a major expansion of the Regency Park site, creating a visitor centre, microbrewery, whisky distillery, and outdoor dining area. The estimated cost of the upgrade was A$50 million, but it grew to A$70 million, and took longer than expected to reach completion. The new visitors&#x27; centre, designed by Studio Nine Architects, opened on 28 August 2024, but the first whisky will not be ready for sale before 2028.

==Beers==

Coopers beers are widely available on tap in South Australia, Victoria and New South Wales, and in some bars in the rest of Australia as speciality beers. They are widely available in bottles and (to a lesser extent) cans around Australia and New Zealand, and occasionally at specialist importers in other countries. The distribution of the beers outside of South Australia has been largely promoted since 2003 by the subsidiary Premium Beverages Pty Ltd.

Coopers bottled beers are characterised by their secondary fermentation technique – some yeast remains in the bottle after bottling – thus the bottled beer contains some sediment. There are three schools of thought with regard to the sediment – some drinkers like to mix the sediment throughout the beer by tipping or rolling the beer before drinking, while others prefer to decant the beer into a glass leaving (most of) the sediment at the base of the bottle. Coopers have made such choice a strong element in their marketing strategy. Some find that mixing the sediment results in a shaken beer and prefer not to mix the sediment at all, simply opening the bottle and drinking. The action of drinking from the bottle serves to distribute the sediment anyway without shaking one&#x27;s beer up.

Coopers also produce a large range of homebrew kits. Among these are, English Bitter, Dark Ale, Real Ale and Lager, as well as several others. Coopers homebrew kits provide the starting place for many new homebrewers across the world and are a highly successful brand.



The company also produces a range of malt extracts and concentrate for homebrewers.

===Pale Ale===
In the twenty-first century Pale Ale is Coopers&#x27; most heavily marketed, most recognised, and most successful beer. Although it has only been produced under this name since 1989, it did have a number of similar predecessors from which it can claim a pedigree, with names including &quot;Light Brew Sparkling Ale&quot; (brewed in the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century before being discontinued due to poor sales), and &quot;Light Dinner Ale&quot; (brewed from the 1960s with some changes to the recipe). The beer occupies a unique place in the local market – it is seen as being somewhere between a &#x27;craft beer&#x27; and the traditional mass-produced lagers.

===Distribution===
Coopers distributes Carlsberg, Kronenbourg, Mythos, and Sapporo in Australia.

In 2022, it was announced that Coopers had been awarded the brewing rights to Miller Genuine Draft in Australia, which includes Miller Chill (Lime, and Blood Orange flavours). Distribution rights for the Miller range were awarded to Perth-based Good Drinks Australia. In addition the partnership secured the licensed brewing rights to Coors Light.

==The Cooper family==
As of 2009, six generations of the family had been involved in the brewery. 

===Thomas Cooper===
Thomas Cooper (1826–1897) was born in Carleton, North Yorkshire, and is the originator of the Adelaide Cooper family. Thomas married twice, leading to two branches of the family, known as the &quot;A side&quot; and &quot;B side&quot; of the family. This has led to the company having multiple classes of shares with different voting rights.

In 1849 he married Ann Laycock Brown (1827–1872) in the Wesleyan Chapel in Skipton, and they had three living children when they arrived in Port Adelaide on 24 August 1852. Their first home was a rented two-room cottage near the Rising Sun Inn on Bridge Street in the then village of Kensington, about three miles east of the city. Thomas worked initially as a shoemaker, then as a mason, and then as a dairyman, and Ann bore four more children. In 1856 he purchased land and built a house in George Street, Norwood.

On 13 May 1862, Thomas brewed his first recorded batch. He did all the work himself (purchasing, calling for orders, brewing, washing, filling, corking and wiring the bottles, delivering the finished product), while continuing to attend the cows, run the dairy, and do the daily milk deliveries. He mortgaged his property to Frederick Scarfe, the Mayor of Norwood, a butcher, for £300, and built a new brewhouse. In January 1863 he sold his cows and the milk delivery run. Although with half-a-dozen breweries in Adelaide, there was a lot of competition, Thomas&#x27;s ale was unique in that he used no sugar, &quot;consequently, ours being pure, the doctors recommend it to their patients&quot;. Although one of the smaller South Australian brewers, Thomas gained a reputation for quality. By 1867 he had over 120 customers, some quite notable (such as Samuel Davenport, John Barton Hack, George Hawker, and Dr Penfold), but he did not supply public houses, &quot;apparently because it was against his principles&quot;.

Ann bore four more children before dying suddenly in 1872. She was survived by all five of her sons, and two of her six daughters. Thomas remarried in 1874, and Sarah Louisa Perry bore eight children. When he died in 1897, Thomas was survived by his wife, and nine of his nineteen children – seven of his sons, and two of his daughters.

===Tim Cooper===
Dr Tim Cooper AM, who entered the family business in 1990 after training as a medical doctor and working as a cardiologist in the UK for some years, became managing director and chief brewer, taking over from his father Bill. 

In 2004 the company introduced a traditional pale ale in an aluminum can, Dr Tim&#x27;s Traditional Ale, based on an experiment by him, and it proved very popular.

In January 2025 it was announced that Tim Cooper would be stepping down as managing director on 1 March. General manager Michael Shearer, who has been with the company since 2004, would be assuming the role of managing director. The company continues to be family-owned and run, with the majority of the board being members of the Cooper family. Tim remains a director and chief brewer.

===Glenn Cooper===
Glenn Cooper AM, is a fifth-generation family member. He entered the business in 1990, having previously worked in IT and marketing roles for both Anderson Digital Equipment and his own Adelaide-based business. He retired from his executive position at the company in 2014, but remained chair until December 2023.

===Melanie Cooper===
Melanie Cooper AM, an accountant, was appointed chair of Coopers Brewery in December 2023, taking over from Glenn. Mel is the first female chair of the company, and is also director of Corporate Affairs and chair of the Coopers Brewery Foundation.

==Company structure==

===Cooper &amp; Sons – 1862-1897===
Thomas started recording his brews in 1862, and by the late 1860s he was employing one man, and his teenage son William. After initial success and expansion, in the late 1860s Thomas had many problems with the quality of the brews, and the business did not fare well for the next decade. In 1870 he sold all his property to meet his debts, and moved to rented premises in High Street, Kensington. By 1877, Thomas had resolved many of the quality problems, and in 1878 sales were back up to the level of the good years of the 1860s. In 1878, second son John went to work in the brewery full-time.

Although Thomas continued to refuse to sell to public houses, and the licensing laws required his minimum sale to be five gallons, his customer base continued to expand, and on 23 July 1881, the first ale was brewed at the much larger newly purchased and built premises in Statenborough Street, Leabrook. Although eldest son William died in 1882 (aged 32), by this time second and third sons Thomas and Christopher were working in the brewery, and fourth son Joseph joined them when he finished his schooling. Under John&#x27;s influence and monitoring, there was greater uniformity of the materials used, and the quality of the products steadily improved. In 1882, production increased to 30,000 gallons, and in the mid-1880s, 48,000 gallons, with the brewery employing seven men. The South Australian economic depression of the 1880s and 1890s suppressed demand, and for the next 10 years, production was level at around 30,000 gallons per year. Thomas retired from general work in the early 1890s, with John running the business with Christopher. Joseph died in 1888 (aged 25). Fifth son Samuel and sixth son Stanley (the eldest of second wife Sarah&#x27;s children) came to the brewery when they finished school, as did William&#x27;s son, Will, and younger sons Frederic, Charles and Walter.

===Thos Cooper &amp; Sons – Partnership – 1897–1923===
Thomas died on 30 December 1897. After bequests to his wife, daughters and youngest sons, his will left all of his property to his four eldest surviving sons, (John, Christopher, Samuel and Stanley), under instructions to &quot;carry on my business as Brewers under the form of &#x27;Thos Cooper &amp; Sons&#x27; as partners&quot;. Younger sons Frederic, (who spent all of his working life at the brewery), and Charles, (who worked at the brewery for many years), received no interest in the business. Nor did grandson Will, who also worked at the brewery. Youngest son Walter was bequeathed an interest in the business when he reached age 25, but died of malaria aged 26.

===Cooper &amp; Sons Ltd – 1923–1988===
Each time one of the partners retired or died, a new partnership agreement needed to be drawn up. This became unwieldy, so in 1923, the partners decided to incorporate with limited liability. An agreement was drawn up where the capital of the company was declared as £39,000, and the 39,000 £1 shares were distributed:
Directors were to be appointed equally by holders of &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; shares.

In 1962, when the two remaining Adelaide brewers were fearing takeover, SA Brewing and Coopers did a share swap. This gave SA Brewing a 25% interest in Coopers (&quot;C&quot; and &quot;D&quot; class shares) and Coopers received 291,404 SA Brewing shares (2.65%). The Coopers board of directors was increased from four to five, with SA Brewing&#x27;s &quot;D&quot; shares having the right to elect the fifth director. At the time, a total of 486,750 new shares were issued, being made up of 87,751 &quot;D&quot; class shares and the remainder, along with other unclassified shares, becoming &quot;C&quot; class shares.

After discussions with, and receiving support from, SA Brewing, Coopers sold their SA Brewing shares in 1984, at a substantial profit.

====Directors====
The directors of Cooper &amp; Sons Ltd were:

===Coopers Brewery Ltd – since 1988===
With Melanie joining the company in 1985, (and subsequently becoming Company Secretary, and a Director), the name &quot;Cooper &amp; Sons&quot; was no longer appropriate. She lobbied for a change in the company&#x27;s name, and was eventually successful.

SA Brewing was acquired by trans-Tasman Lion Nathan in 1993. After two years of negotiations, in 1995 Cooper family members purchased all of the &quot;D&quot; class shares (with their right to elect a director), and some of the &quot;C&quot; class shares, and Coopers Brewery Ltd purchased the remainder of the &quot;C&quot; class shares held by SA Brewing. In return the Coopers constitution was amended to give Lion Nathan &quot;third tier&quot; rights to buy Coopers shares.

This resulted in Max and Bill owning more than 50% of the &quot;D&quot; class shares. They agreed that Bill would sell Max his &quot;D&quot; class shares, and Max would sell Bill his &quot;B&quot; class shares, resulting in Max owning the majority of the &quot;D&quot;s, and Bill owning the majority of the &quot;B&quot;s.

In 2005, Lion Nathan launched a hostile takeover of Coopers, offering to buy Coopers shares at five times the price at which they had last traded. Although the 1995 negotiations resulted in Lion Nathan owning no Coopers shares, the section of the Coopers constitution, (which stated the circumstances under which shares could be sold), appeared to give Lion Nathan the avenue to buy Coopers shares. The constitution stated three tiers of purchasing rights: 
:The shares must first be offered to an existing shareholder. (&quot;first rights agreement&quot;);
:If existing shareholders choose not to buy, the shares must then be offered to the Coopers Superannuation Fund. (&quot;second rights agreement&quot;);
:If the Fund chooses not to buy, the shares must then be offered to Lion Nathan. (&quot;third rights agreement&quot;)
Lots of legal activity, injunctions, claims and counter-claims followed. Eventually the Coopers Board gained a ruling that allowed them to call an Extraordinary General Meeting to decide a motion which would remove the &quot;third rights agreement&quot; from the constitution. At the meeting, the holders of 93.4% of the shares voted to remove the &quot;third rights agreement&quot; from the constitution.

At the time (November 2005), Coopers had 117 Shareholders, and 4 classes of shares. The Coopers Constitution and the 2005 Buy-Back Offer stated:
:(a) the holders of (the 15,553) A Class shares may elect two directors to the board of Coopers (A Class directors);
:(b) the holders of (the 15,953) B Class shares may elect two directors to the board of Coopers (B Class directors);
:(c) the holders of (the 1,234,761) C Class shares, with the holders of Classes A, B and D Class shares, may elect one director to the board of Coopers if that director is nominated by a unanimous resolution of all directors appointed by the holders of A, B and D shares (C Class director); and
:(d) the holders of (the 87,091) D Class shares may elect one director to the board of Coopers (D Class director).
The total number of shares, of all classes, was 1,353,358. If the Buy-Back was fully subscribed, 203,003 shares would be cancelled, and the total number of shares would be reduced to 1,150,335.

The Takeovers Panel stated that the directors&#x27; holdings were:
*Glenn and James (or interests closely associated with them) controlled 4,834 A Class shares or approximately 31% of the A Class shares
*Bill, (or interests closely associated with him), controlled 9,456 B Class shares or approximately 59% of the B Class shares.
*M. Cooper Nominees Pty. Ltd., a company associated with Max, controlled 49,271 D Class shares or approximately 57% of the D Class shares.
*The other Coopers directors (or persons closely associated with them) owned 10,420 or approximately 11.7% of the D Class shares.
*The Coopers directors&#x27; voting power was 28.2%.

In the chairman&#x27;s address to the 2006 AGM, Glenn noted that the costs incurred by Coopers in addressing the offer were $8 million.

In 2009, Coopers Brewery Ltd appointed its first female director.

<text>Pedro Nel Ignacio Tomás de Villanueva Ospina Vásquez (18 September 1858 – 1 July 1927) was a Colombian general and political figure. He served as president of Colombia between 1922 and 1926.

== Biography ==
Ospina was born in Bogotá, on September 18, 1858. He was born in the Presidential Palace, as his father Mariano Ospina Rodríguez was president of Colombia at the time. He died in Medellín, on July 1, 1927.

== Educator ==

Colombia&#x27;s first significant effort in mining engineering was brought about by the Escuela Nacional de Minas in the city of Medellín. This institution was conceived strictly as a mining institute, modeled after the School of Mines of the University of California, Berkeley, from which its first directors, Ospina and his brother Tulio Ospina were graduated. When the school began its second life after 1904, it also offered degrees in chemistry, civil, electrical, mining and mechanical engineering. As rectors of the school, echoing the themes of their father, they insistently preached the virtues of work, discipline and practicality.

== Engineer and entrepreneur ==

&quot;Antioqueño&quot; engineers thought of themselves primarily as industrial entrepreneurs rather than agents of state policy. Although some, such as Ospina and his nephew Mariano Ospina Pérez, became highly successful in national politics, antioqueño engineers continued to nurture the self-image of the apolitical, economically practical, hardworking paisa. Since 1910, successful businessmen and engineers emerged from the business community of Medellín, as did Ospina, who was a Berkeley-trained mining engineer and an industrial entrepreneur as well as a large-scale agriculturalist.

== Politics ==

Ospina was elected MP to the Camara de Representantes (House of Representatives) in 1892 and 1894 for the province of Antioquia. During his first term he sponsored the bill to derogate the “Ley de los Caballos” and introduced a bill to enact the &quot;“freedom of speech”&quot;. During his second term he sponsored a bill to restructure the Banco Nacional (National Bank).

Ospina was a General of the Army during the civil war of the Thousand Days&#x27; War. In 1901 he was appointed as Minister of War by President José Manuel Marroquín.

President Carlos Eugenio Restrepo, in 1910, appointed Ospina as the Colombian Ambassador to the United States. Upon his return to the country, he was elected to congress and later as Governor of Antioquia.

In 1918, Ospina was appointed as Governor of the province of Antioquia. Later, in 1920, during the government of President Marco Fidel Suárez, Ospina was elected by congress as the nation&#x27;s presidential designate.

== Presidency ==

In 1922, he was elected as Colombia&#x27;s 36th president. During his administration, he organized the Departments of Education, Health, and the Treasury. He created the Central Bank (Banco de la Republica) and greatly advanced critical public works, such as the main national highways and railways systems, dams and bridges, and the crude oil pipelines connecting the major oil fields to the sea ports.

Ospina, as president of the republic between 1922 and 1926, secured the creation of a modern central bank, and in 1928 he created the Bogotá stock exchange. During his administration, banking and commerce expanded and became more organized.

<text>Luis Mariano Ospina Pérez (24 November 1891 – 14 April 1976), commonly known as Mariano Ospina Pérez, was a Colombian politician and a member of the Colombian Conservative Party. He served as the 17th President of Colombia between 1946 and 1950.

==Early years==

Ospina was born in Medellín, Antioquia on 24 November 1891 to his parents Tulio Ospina Vásquez and Ana Rosa Pérez, who were members of the traditional Colombian political families. He also spent his early years there. He was the grandson of former President of Colombia Mariano Ospina Rodríguez and nephew of President Pedro Nel Ospina.

Ospina was taught at the Colegio San Ignacio in Medellín and also studied engineering at the Escuela de Minas de Antioquia (Antioquia School of Mines), where he graduated as mining engineer. After graduating Ospina traveled for two years during which he toured and studied in Louisiana, London and Paris. Whilst on these travels he took courses on gold mining, sugar cane production, economics, labor relations, cooperativism, civil engineering and railway systems.

Ospina, who studied engineering at the Escuela de Minas de Medellín and Louisiana State University, served as the executive administrator of the National Federation of Coffee Growers and was a prominent businessman in other sectors before becoming president in 1946.

== The National Federation of Coffee Growers of Colombia ==

In 1927, after the Second National Congress of Coffee Growers had created the &quot;Federación Nacional de Cafeteros de Colombia&quot;, the first regional committee was established as &quot;“el Comité de Cafeteros de Antioquia”&quot;. Ospina was its first president, and the first registered member of the association.

The first board of directors of the newly organized National Federation of Coffee Growers of Colombia assembled in Bogotá on August 3, 1929. Its first members were Mariano Ospina Vásquez, Alberto Camilo Suárez, Gabriel Ortiz Williamson, Carlos Caballero, Jesús del Corral and Mariano Ospina Pérez, the greatest dignitary in the History of the Federation, for whom the organization of the national coffee industry was one of his most serious and ambitious concerns.

In December 1930 the Fourth National Congress of Coffee Growers convened in Bogotá. Owing to the vast knowledge and experience acquired by Ospina in the coffee industry as a result of running his own coffee business, he was summoned by the Minister of Industry Francisco J. Chaux and by President Rafael Olaya Herrera to preside over this Congress. Ospina was elected president of this Fourth Congress. At its adjournment Ospina was elected, by unanimous vote of the delegates, as “Gerente de la Federación” (General Director). He served in this position for four years, until 1934.

In 1954, during the election of members of the board of directors (of the National Federation of Coffee Growers of Colombia), Ospina, who had served as president of the Republic from 1946 to 1950, was elected and installed as president of the board of directors. His return to the federation marked the reappearance of one of Colombia&#x27;s greatest coffee names in an active role in Colombia&#x27;s coffee industry.

Ospina, grandson of Mariano Ospina Rodríguez, not only was one of the founders of the National Federation of Coffee Growers of Colombia, but was later elected as General Director of the Coffee Federation, and served in such capacity from 1930 to 1934. His main objective was to assist, finance, and educate the coffee growers while implementing an aggressive program to penetrate the world market and to successfully capture a substantial share of it.

Under Ospina&#x27;s direction, the National Federation of Coffee Growers of Colombia successfully consolidated the nation&#x27;s coffee industry and promoted it in world markets to great effect. Colombia became the largest producer of prime &quot;Coffea arabica&quot; coffee in the world. He laid a very solid corporative foundation, and today the Colombian Coffee Federation organizes and supports over 500,000 independent coffee growers and small farmers.

==Political career==

Upon his return to Colombia in 1914 Ospina contacted the leadership of the Colombian Conservative Party and was nominated to run for the office of counselor to the City Council of Medellín, representing the Conservative Party. In 1915 Ospina was elected as councilman and won a second term in 1917. That same year he was elected Deputy for Antioquia. In 1919 Ospina was appointed Railway Superintendent of the Antioquia Railway.

In 1921 he ran once again for the Assembly of Antioquia and was elected. After his father&#x27;s death that year Ospina took over his job as director of the Mining School. He was later elected to Congress, first as Representative and later as senator.

In 1922 his uncle Pedro Nel Ospina was elected president and Ospina was also elected as senator of Colombia for a four-year term. In 1926 the new president Miguel Abadía appointed Ospina as Minister of Public Works but he only remained in office for eight months, until 1927. Between 1930 and 1934 he was manager of the &quot;Federación Nacional de Cafeteros de Colombia&quot; and after this he acquired the nickname of &quot;Hombre de los Cafeteros&quot; (the man of the coffee growers) working for the Coffee Federation for almost a decade while also working as union leader and senator.

==Presidential candidate==

The Conservative party was relying on candidate Laureano Gómez to become the official candidate for the presidency of Colombia. Ospina&#x27;s name was suggested for the 1946 elections to take advantage of the division in the opposing Colombian Liberal Party between supporters of Jorge Eliécer Gaitán and those of Gabriel Turbay. With only three weeks remaining for the main election Ospina was appointed as the official Conservative party candidate for the presidency of Colombia. Ospina defeated his Liberal opponents with less than 40% of the votes due to a large abstention.

==The Presidency==

Ospina was installed as President of Colombia in 1946. During his administration Colombia reached its highest level of coffee exports, both in number of bags and as a percentage of the gross domestic product (GDP). He was determined to fortify the nation&#x27;s infrastructure and created Ecopetrol (Colombian Petroleum Company) and Acerias Paz del Río (the country&#x27;s largest steel mill). He was also committed to social responsibility and, to that end, set up the financial institution &quot;La Caja Agraria&quot;, the Social Security Administration, the Department of Labor and the Housing Credit Agency to help meet the credit, educational and social needs of blue-collar workers, coffee growers, and other small farmers and peasants.

During his presidency the country faced a growing political struggle between the backers of the Conservative party, the Liberal political forces and the rising Colombian Communist Party in the Boyacá, Nariño, Norte de Santander and Santander Departments. The Communists and Liberals blamed President Laureano Gómez for directly interfering with the presidential election of 1946, by disqualifying one million eight hundred Liberal votes as invalid. Ospina was dubbed by the Communists as Laureano Gómez&#x27;s successor with the mission of maintaining the Conservative party in power.
During his presidency, on April 9, 1948, the liberal leader Jorge Eliécer Gaitán was assassinated in confusing circumstances by Juan Roa. Gaitán was running for the presidency of Colombia for a second time; this time he had won his party&#x27;s primaries and had large support from the masses. The confusion and anger triggered by Gaitán&#x27;s assassination provoked the huge Bogotazo riots that extended throughout the Colombian capital Bogotá and extended later to the rest of the country to generate a ten-year period of violence known as &quot;La Violencia&quot;. The government forces supported by the Conservative party started a campaign of repression against the Liberals after a failed attempt to establish a government of national unity. Ospina was heavily criticized by the Liberals, especially in the National Congress where in 1948 they tried to impeach him, but Ospina closed the Congress before they could achieve this; a decade of civil-military dictatorship followed that lasted until 1958 when the National Front was created.

Ospina created the Colombian Petroleum Company ECOPETROL (Empresa Colombiana de Petroleos), the Telecommunications Company TELECOM, the Social Security Administration ISS (&quot;Instituto de Seguro Social&quot;), the petroleum pipeline from Barrancabermeja and Puerto Berrío, the hydroelectric dams of Sisga, Saldaña and Neusa, and established the Colombian Economic Development Plan under the direction of the Economic Mission of Professor Lauchlin Currie. He also fomented, financed and increased the production and exports of coffee.

== Post-Presidency ==

In 1949, in the midst of continuing civil strife, Laureano Gómez was elected as President of Colombia. A split developed in the Conservative party; Ospina backed a moderate wing while Gómez supported extreme Conservative policies. Ospina ultimately supported the coup d&#x27;etat against Gómez that established the military administration of Gustavo Rojas, Ospina&#x27;s former Minister of Post and Telegraphs.

Ospina later had political differences with Rojas and withdrew his support, choosing instead to encourage the creation of the National Front.

He died in Bogotá, Cundinamarca on 14 April 1976, at the age of 84.

<text>Jerónimo de la Ossa ( Panama City, April 9, 1847 - Panama City, 1907) was a Panamanian romantic poet, lyricist, and diplomat. He wrote the lyrics of the national anthem of Panama &quot;Himno Istmeño&quot;. His brother was Jose Francisco de la Ossa, the mayor of Panama City.

He studied in Chile, where he graduated as a civil engineer. He represented at the Chilean consulate in Panama and worked for the French Canal Company. He was the first president of the &quot;Sociedad El Progreso del Isthmo&quot;.

His poems were characterized by their simplicity and humility. His work is scattered in the various weekly newspapers and magazines of the time, however his best verses were composed when he was a student.

The importance of this poet is primarily in being the author of the lyrics of the National Anthem of Panama, where a pronounced patriotic accent is denoted. He also wrote the poem &quot;The Source of Paradise.&quot; Today, Jerónimo Ossa is considered one of the great poets of the 20th century.

<doc id="760897" wikidata="Q662185" url="?curid=760897" title="Choanal atresia">
<text>Choanal atresia is a congenital disorder where the back of the nasal passage (choana) is blocked, usually by abnormal bony or soft tissue (membranous) due to failed hole development of the nasal fossae during prenatal development. It causes persistent rhinorrhea, and with bilateral choanal atresia, an obstructed airway that can cause cyanosis and hypoxia.

Choanal atresia is diagnosed based on the inability to place a nasal catheter, and radiology results (particularly CT scans). Treatment involves maintaining an open airway, and may involve surgery to reopen the airway, potentially with a stent. Choanal atresia is a fairly rare condition, affecting between 1 in 7,000 to 1 in 5,000 live births. It is more common in females and is more often unilateral.

== Presentation ==
Choanal atresia can be unilateral or bilateral.

* A unilateral choanal atresia may not be detected until much later in life because the baby manages to get along with only one nostril available for breathing. Symptoms are minor, including persistent rhinorrhea (mainly normal mucus) and chronic sinusitis.
* Bilateral choanal atresia is a life-threatening condition because the baby will be unable to breathe directly after birth as babies are obligate nasal breathers (they mainly use their noses to breathe). In some cases, this may present as cyanosis while the baby is feeding, because the oral air passages are blocked by the tongue, further restricting the airway. Cyanosis may improve when the baby cries, as the oral airway is used. These babies may require airway resuscitation soon after birth.

=== Associated conditions ===
Choanal atresia is associated with a higher risk of other airway problems, including:

* tracheomalacia.
* laryngomalacia.
* subglottic stenosis.

Sometimes, babies born with choanal atresia also have other abnormalities:
*coloboma.
*heart defects and cardiovascular disease.
*intellectual disability.
*growth impairment.
*genital hypoplasia.
*CHARGE syndrome.
*others.

Also any condition that causes significant depression of the nasal bridge or midface retraction can be associated with choanal atresia. Examples include the craniosynostosis syndromes such as Crouzon syndrome, Pfeiffer syndrome, Treacher Collins syndrome, Apert syndrome, and Antley-Bixler syndrome.

== Cause ==
Choanal atresia is caused by problems with the development of the nasal cavity and the palate. Development begins with neural crest cells. Frontonasal processes fold, forming nasal placodes (nasal pits). The nasobuccal membrane must rupture in places to form the choanae. A number of theories exist as to how this developmental process causes choanal atresia.

=== Risk factors ===

Very few risk factors for choanal atresia have been identified. In general, choanal atresia is associated with a higher risk of other birth defects. Bilateral choanal atresia is more associated than unilateral choanal atresia.

While causes are unknown, both genetic and environmental triggers are suspected. One study suggests that chemicals that act as endocrine disrupters may put an unborn infant at risk. A 2012 epidemiological study looked at atrazine, a commonly used herbicide in the U.S., and found that women who lived in counties in Texas with the highest levels of this chemical being used to treat agricultural crops were 80 times more likely to give birth to infants with choanal atresia or stenosis compared to women who lived in the counties with the lowest levels. Another epidemiological report in 2010 found even higher associations between increased incidents of choanal atresia and exposure to second-hand-smoke, coffee consumption, high maternal zinc and B-12 intake and exposure to anti-infective urinary tract medications. The anti-thyroid medication methimazole has been associated with the development of choanal atresia in rare cases if given during the first trimester of pregnancy.

== Mechanism ==
Choanal atresia causes closure of the posterior choanae in the nasal cavity. Around 30% of these affect just the bone, while around 70% affect both bone and membranes. Bones affected can include the body of the sphenoid bone, the vomer, the medial pterygoid process of the sphenoid bone, and the horizontal plate of the palatine bone.

== Diagnosis ==

=== Nasal catheter ===
Choanal atresia can be suspected if it is impossible to insert a nasal catheter. The length of catheter that can be inserted indicates where choanal atresia has occurred: shorter distances indicate a problem with the vomer, while longer distances indicate a problem with the posterior choanae. Mucus can be cleared (using suction) to visualise the abnormality.

=== Radiology ===
Diagnosis is confirmed using CT scan. This is also useful for differential diagnosis.

== Treatment ==

=== Airway management ===
As bilateral choanal atresia is an emergency, the airway is secured. A small tube may be placed to the laryngopharynx. Tracheal intubation can also be used. If surgery cannot be performed soon after birth, tracheostomy may have better outcomes.

=== Surgery ===
Surgery may be used to reopen the airway, particularly with bilateral choanal atresia. This may be performed through the nasal cavity or through the palate (accessed through the mouth). A stent may be inserted to keep the newly formed airway patent. Repeated dilatation may be performed. CT guidance may be used.

== Epidemiology ==
Choanal atresia is fairly rare. It may have a frequency between 1 in 7,000 births and 1 in 5,000 births.

== History ==
Choanal atresia was first described by Roederer in 1755.

<doc id="760903" wikidata="Q2290085" url="?curid=760903" title="Colles' fracture">
<text>A Colles&#x27; fracture is a type of fracture of the distal forearm in which the broken end of the radius is bent backwards. Symptoms may include pain, swelling, deformity, and bruising. Complications may include damage to the median nerve.

It typically occurs as a result of a fall on an outstretched hand. Risk factors include osteoporosis. The diagnosis may be confirmed via X-rays. The tip of the ulna may also be broken.

Treatment may include casting or surgery. Surgical reduction and casting is possible in the majority of cases in people over the age of 50. Pain management can be achieved during the reduction with procedural sedation and analgesia or a hematoma block. A year or two may be required for healing to occur.

About 15% of people have a Colles&#x27; fracture at some point in their life. They occur more commonly in young adults and older people than in children and middle-aged adults. Women are more frequently affected than men. The fracture is named after Abraham Colles who described it in 1814.

== Causes ==
The fracture is most commonly caused by people falling onto a hard surface and breaking their fall with outstretched hand (FOOSH)–falling with wrists flexed would lead to a Smith&#x27;s fracture. Originally it was described in elderly and/or post-menopausal women. It usually occurs about three to five centimetres proximal to the radio-carpal joint with posterior and lateral displacement of the distal fragment resulting in the characteristic &quot;dinner fork&quot; or &quot;bayonet&quot; like deformity. Colles fracture is a common fracture in people with osteoporosis, second only to vertebral fractures.

== Diagnosis ==

Diagnosis can be made upon interpretation of anteroposterior and lateral views alone.

The classic Colles fracture has the following characteristics:
* Transverse fracture of the radius
* 2.5 cm (0.98 inches) proximal to the radio-carpal joint
* dorsal displacement and dorsal angulation, together with radial tilt

Other characteristics:
* Radial shortening
* Loss of ulnar inclination
* Radial angulation of the wrist
* Comminution at the fracture site
* Associated fracture of the ulnar styloid process in more than 60% of cases.

=== Classification ===
The term &quot;Colles fracture&quot; is classically used to describe a fracture at the distal end of the radius, at its cortico-cancellous junction. However, the term now tends to be used loosely to describe any fracture of the distal radius, with or without involvement of the ulna, that has dorsal displacement of the fracture fragments. Colles himself described it as a fracture that “takes place at about an inch and a half (38mm) above the carpal extremity of the radius” and “the carpus and the base of metacarpus appears to be thrown backward”. The fracture is sometimes referred to as a &quot;dinner fork&quot; or &quot;bayonet&quot; deformity due to the shape of the resultant forearm.

Colles&#x27; fractures can be categorized according to several systems including Frykman, Gartland &amp; Werley, Lidström, Nissen-Lie and the Older&#x27;s classifications.

== Treatment ==

Management depends on the severity of the fracture. An undisplaced fracture may be treated with a cast alone. The cast is applied with the distal fragment in palmar flexion and ulnar deviation. A fracture with mild angulation and displacement may require closed reduction. There is some evidence that immobilization with the wrist in dorsiflexion as opposed to palmarflexion results in less redisplacement and better functional status. Significant angulation and deformity may require an open reduction and internal fixation or external fixation. The volar forearm splint is best for temporary immobilization of forearm, wrist and hand fractures, including Colles fracture.
There are several established instability criteria:
dorsal tilt &gt;20°,
comminuted fracture,
abruption of the ulnar styloid process,
intraarticular displacement &gt;1mm,
loss of radial height &gt;2mm.

A higher amount of instability criteria increases the likelihood of operative treatment.

Treatment modalities differ in the elderly.

Repeat Xrays are recommended at one, two, and six weeks to verify proper healing.

==Prognosis==
Recovery time depends on the degree of bone displacement, the number of bone fragments, whether or not the break is &quot;intra-articular&quot; (involves the wrist joint), as well as the person&#x27;s age, gender, and medical history, and may range from two months to a year or more for complete recovery.

== Epidemiology ==

Colles fractures occur in all age groups, although certain patterns follow an age distribution.
* In the elderly, because of the weaker cortex, the fracture is more often extra-articular.
* Younger individuals tend to require a higher energy force to cause the fracture and tend to have more complex intra-articular fractures. In children with open epiphyses, an equivalent fracture is the &quot;epiphyseal slip&quot;, as can be seen in other joints, such as a slipped capital femoral epiphysis in the hip. This is a Salter I or II fracture with the deforming forces directed through the weaker epiphyseal plate.
* More common in women because of post-menopausal osteoporosis.

== History ==

The Colles fracture is named after Abraham Colles (1773–1843), an Irish surgeon, from Kilkenny who first described it in 1814 by simply looking at the classic deformity before the advent of X-rays. Ernest Amory Codman was the first to study it using X-rays. His article, published in the &quot;Boston Medical and Surgical Journal&quot;, now known as &quot;The New England Journal of Medicine&quot;, also developed the classification system.

It is sometimes said that Claude Pouteau was the first to describe the Colles&#x27; fracture (which is sometimes called the Pouteau-Colles fracture), but, according to P. Liverneaux, it is not the case.

<text>Barker College is an independent Anglican co-educational early learning, primary and secondary day and boarding school, located in Hornsby, a North Shore suburb of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. Barker was founded in 1890 by Rev. Henry Plume at Kurrajong Heights. In 2016 Barker announced a transition to a fully co-educational school, commencing in 2018 with girls in early learning and Kindergarten, in 2019 with girls in Year 3; in 2020 with girls in Year 7. It includes boarding facilities.

The school also incorporates three campuses for Aboriginal children. Two in NSW and the third Dhupuma Barker, in North East Arnhem Land in 2021.

The Council of Barker College was originally constituted by the Barker College Ordinance of 1919. In 1939, Barker College was incorporated pursuant to the provisions of the &quot;Anglican Church of Australia (Bodies Corporate) Act 1938&quot;. Therefore, though Barker College is an Anglican school, it is separately incorporated and has its own governing body.

Barker is affiliated with the Headmasters&#x27; and Headmistresses&#x27; Conference, the Association of Heads of Independent Schools of Australia, the Junior School Heads Association of Australia, the Australian Boarding Schools&#x27; Association, the Independent Schools Association, and is a founding member of the Combined Associated Schools.

==History==
In 1890, Henry Plume took up the position of Rector at St Stephen&#x27;s Church, Kurrajong. It was at the church that he tutored five local pupils for the Junior, Senior and Matriculation Examinations. Their academic success encouraged Plume to establish his own school. In 1891, Plume selected &quot;Stokesleigh&quot;, a guest house in Kurrajong Heights, as the site for this school. The name Barker College was chosen in memory of Frederic Barker, the second Bishop of Sydney whom Plume had met soon after his arrival in Australia. An outbreak of scarlet fever in 1894 convinced Plume that the School was too isolated and would be better located nearer to Sydney. Thus the School moved to its present site in Hornsby in 1896, and in 1919 its ownership transferred to the Church of England.

===Co-education===
1975 saw the introduction of the co-educational collegiate senior school for students in Years 11 and 12, with the enrolment of 59 female students. In 2000, with Year 10 becoming became part of the senior school, girls started at Year 10 level. 

==Headmasters==

The following men have served as Headmasters of Barker College:
==Motto==
The school motto, &quot;Honor non Honores&quot;, is derived from the Latin meaning &quot;Honour not Rewards&quot;. The earliest record of the motto is on an illuminated address presented to Rev and Mrs Plume on their departure from the School in 1905.

==Campus==
Barker College is situated on a campus in suburban Hornsby, to the north of Sydney, with additional facilities located in the Blue Mountains, and The Grange, located at Mount Victoria. The Junior School, shares the Hornsby campus with the Middle and Senior schools.

In 2016 the school opened an Indigenous campus, Darkinjung Barker, at Yarramalong on the NSW Central Coast, for students in Kindergarten to Year 6. In 2020 the school opened a second K–6 Indigenous campus, in the old Wollombi Public School building, called 
Ngarralingayil Barker; 
&quot;Ngarralingayil&quot; means &quot;a place where learning happens&quot; in the Wonnarua language. Fifteen students were enrolled in 2020, and 22 are expected in 2021. A third campus in Alice Springs is scheduled to open in 2021.

The current facilities of the school include:
*A library; an information technology centre; the McCaskill Music Centre;
*Three drama performance spaces: two theatres with raked seating – The Rhodes Theatre and The BCMA Theatre – and the Leslie Hall;
*The Centenary Design Centre with provision for individual studios and whole-class teaching in design and technology and visual arts;
*The Barker Foundation Science Centre;
*Boarding houses;
*Six sporting fields, together with 11 tennis courts, indoor courts for netball, basketball and volleyball, an artificial surface for hockey, football, softball and other games;
*The R. E. Kefford Building, equipped with classrooms, smaller group learning spaces, and two theatres which seat 302 and 215 respectively.
*The Junior School is an International Baccalaureate Candidate School and aims to become a registered IB school.
*The purpose-built Kurrajong Building for Pre-K – Year 2 students opened in 2018 within the Junior School campus.
*The Rosewood Centre for indoor sports, containing a number of classrooms
*The Senior Study Hub, equipped with classrooms and facilities for senior students

==Barker College House System==
As with most Australian schools, Barker College utilises a house system for students in years K-12. Each house has a teacher in charge, called a Head of House. The Junior School has 6 six Houses that were named after explorers of Australia and Antarctica: Byrd, Flinders, Hillary, Mawson, Scott &amp; Tasman. The Middle and Senior School has 16 sixteen houses, named after influential people in the School&#x27;s history, such as alumni or School Council members.

===Middle and Senior School Houses===

The Middle and Senior School Houses are named after influential figures in the School&#x27;s history, with eight male and eight female namesakes. In July 2018 the College announced they would be changing the pastoral care system for the middle and senior school following the introduction of coeducation. The existing Houses are all named after influential men from the school&#x27;s history, and after the introduction of coeducation, another eight new Houses were announced, after important women in the School&#x27;s past. 
These new houses are Bowman, Fear (1980), Hill, Mackenzie, May, Stevens, Sthalekar and Stone, adding to the list of existing houses; Andrew, Boyce, Butters, Holt, Pain, Wade, Wailes and Wilson. Both male and female students will be allocated to one of the 16 houses, regardless of gender.

== Sport ==
Barker College is a member of the Combined Associated Schools (CAS).

<text>Ion Nonna Otescu (15 December 1888 – 25 March 1940) was a Romanian composer and head of the Bucharest Conservatory (now the National University of Music) from 1918 until 1940. He was born in Bucharest and died there at the age of 51, having played an influential role in the musical life of his native country.

==Life and career==
Otescu was born in Bucharest and studied at the Conservatory there from 1903 to 1907 under Dumitru Georgescu-Kiriac and Alfonso Castaldi (1874–1942). He then went to Paris where he stayed until 1911 studying at the Schola Cantorum de Paris with Vincent d&#x27;Indy and at the Paris Conservatory with Charles-Marie Widor. He began teaching at the Bucharest Conservatory in 1913, and in 1918 he became its head, a position he held until his death in 1940. Otescu played an active role in the musical life of Romania and was instrumental in the founding of the (the precursor of the Romanian National Opera), the Romanian Composers Society, and the music journal &quot;Muzika&quot;.

In 1913 he won the George Enescu Prize and in 1928 the Romanian National Prize for composition. His works were predominantly dramatic in nature: operas, ballets, and symphonic poems. However, he also composed art songs and chamber music. Like his pupil Tudor Ciortea, Otescu&#x27;s music was strongly influenced by the French compositional style of the time and by Romanian folk music traditions.

==Principal works==
Stage
* &quot; Bubi&quot;, musical comedy (1903)
* &quot;Ileana Cosânzeana&quot;, ballet based on the mythical princess Ileana Cosânzeana to a libretto by Queen Marie of Romania (1918)

<doc id="760914" wikidata="Q1236057" url="?curid=760914" title="Conduction aphasia">
<text>Conduction aphasia, also called associative aphasia, is an uncommon form of aphasia caused by damage to the parietal lobe of the brain. An acquired language disorder, it is characterized by intact auditory comprehension, coherent (yet paraphasic) speech production, but poor speech repetition. Affected people are fully capable of understanding what they are hearing, but fail to encode phonological information for production. This deficit is load-sensitive as the person shows significant difficulty repeating phrases, particularly as the phrases increase in length and complexity and as they stumble over words they are attempting to pronounce. People have frequent errors during spontaneous speech, such as substituting or transposing sounds. They are also aware of their errors and will show significant difficulty correcting them.

In 1970, Tim Shallice and Elizabeth Warrington were able to differentiate two variants of
this constellation: the reproduction and the repetition type. These authors suggested an exclusive deficit of auditory-verbal short-term memory in repetition conduction aphasia whereas the other variant was assumed to reflect disrupted phonological encoding mechanism, affecting confrontation tasks such as repetition, reading and naming in a similar manner.

Left-hemisphere damage involving auditory regions often result in speech deficits. Lesions in this area that damage the sensorimotor dorsal stream suggest that the sensory system aid in motor speech. Studies have suggested that conduction aphasia is a result of damage specifically to the left superior temporal gyrus and/or the left supramarginal gyrus. The classical explanation for conduction aphasia is a disconnection between the brain areas responsible for speech comprehension (Wernicke&#x27;s area) and that of speech production (Broca&#x27;s area). This is due to specific damage to the arcuate fasciculus, a deep white matter tract. Aphasic people are still able to comprehend speech as the lesion does not disrupt the ventral stream pathway.

==Signs and symptoms==

Conduction aphasics will show relatively well-preserved auditory comprehension, which may even be completely functional. All cases are individualized and unique to their own extent. Speech production will be fluent, grammatically, and syntactically correct. Intonation and articulation will also be maintained. Speech often contains some paraphasic errors: phonemes and syllables will be dropped or transposed (e.g., &quot;snowball&quot; → &quot;snowall&quot;, &quot;television&quot; → &quot;vellitision&quot;, &quot;ninety-five percent&quot; → &quot;ninety-twenty percent&quot;). The hallmark deficit of this disorder, however, is in repetition. Aphasic people will show an inability to repeat words or sentences when asked by an examiner. After saying a sentence to a person with conduction aphasia, he or she will be able to paraphrase the sentence accurately but will not be able to repeat it. This is possibly because their &quot;motor speech error processing is disrupted by inaccurate forward predictions, or because detected errors are not translated into corrective commands due to damage to the auditory-motor interface&quot;. When prompted to repeat words, the person will be unable to do so, and produce many paraphasic errors. For example, when prompted with &quot;bagger&quot;, a person may respond with, &quot;gabber&quot;. Recent summaries about the syndrome show similarities between defective speech and writing and their relatively good comprehension. The sudden speech of a conduction aphasic is fluent, yet it is lengthy and inadequately structured. Aphasic people have difficulty in finding words appropriate to context and in accurately pronouncing a word. Aphasic errors in naming, reading aloud, and repeating are recognized.

Individuals with conduction aphasia are able to express themselves fairly well, with some word finding and functional comprehension difficulty. Although people with aphasia may be able to express themselves fairly well, they tend to have issues repeating phrases, especially phrases that are long and complex. During an assessment of aphasia, the clinician usually examine the person&#x27;s verbal fluency, comprehension, repetition, reading, writing, and naming. When asked to repeat something, the person will be unable to do so without significant difficulty, repeatedly attempting to self-correct (&quot;conduite d&#x27;approche&quot;).

People with conduction aphasia recognize their errors and will repetitively try to correct them. This recognition is due to preserved auditory error detection mechanisms. Errors frequently fit a pattern of incorrect approximations. These common errors typically occur in morphemes that &quot;a&quot;) share one or more similarly located phonemes but &quot;b&quot;) differ in at least one aspect that makes the substituted morpheme(s) semantically distinct. Repetitive self correction is commonly used by Aphasic people of conduction aphasia. Due to their relatively preserved auditory comprehension, conduction aphasics are capable of accurately monitoring, and attempting to correct, their own errors in speech output.

Conduction aphasia is a mild language disability, and most people return to their normal lives. Broca&#x27;s and Wernicke&#x27;s aphasia are commonly caused by middle cerebral artery strokes. Symptoms of conduction aphasia, as with other aphasias, can be transient, sometimes lasting only several hours or a few days. As aphasias and other language disorders are frequently due to stroke, their symptoms can change and evolve over time, or simply disappear. If the cause is a stroke, people can make a good recovery but may have persistent deficits. This is because the healing in the brain after inflammation or hemorrhage, leads to decreased local impairment. Furthermore, the plasticity of the brain may allow the recruitment of new pathways to restore lost function. For example, the right hemisphere speech systems may learn to correct for left-hemisphere damage. However, chronic conduction aphasia is possible, without transformation to other aphasias. These people show prolonged, profound deficits in repetition, frequent phonemic paraphasias, and repetitive self-correction during spontaneous speech.

===Examples of conduction aphasia===

==Causes==
Conduction aphasia is caused by damage to the parietal lobe of the brain, especially in regards to the area associated with the left-hemisphere dominant dorsal stream network. The arcuate fasciculus, which connects Broca&#x27;s area and Wernicke&#x27;s area (important for speech and language production and comprehension, respectively), is affected. These two areas control speech and language in the brain. The arcuate fasciculus is a thick band of fiber that connects the two areas and carries messages between them. When this area is damaged, the person experiences damage to the auditory-motor integration system. This results in disruption to the delayed auditory feedback network, causing the individual to have difficulty correcting themselves on speech repetition tasks. Additionally, recent evidence suggests that conduction aphasia can also be caused by lesions in the left superior temporal gyrus and/or the left supramarginal gyrus.

Conduction aphasia can also be seen in cases of cortical damage without subcortical extensions.

== Pathophysiology ==

Recent research has pointed to multiple different explanations for conduction aphasia, which is based on newer models suggesting language is facilitated by &quot;cortically based, anatomically distributed, modular networks.&quot;

==Diagnosis==

Several standardized test batteries exist for diagnosing and classifying aphasias. These tests are capable of identifying conduction aphasia with relative accuracy. The Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination (BDAE) and the Western Aphasia Battery (WAB) are two commonly used test batteries for diagnosing conduction aphasia. These examinations involve a set of tests, which include asking person to name pictures, read printed words, count aloud, and repeat words and non-words (such as &quot;shwazel&quot;). Neuro-imaging should also be used to look for a stroke, tumor, infection, or another pathology in the setting of conduction aphasia. This can be done through a CT or MRI or the brain; these are the first imaging modality of choice.

==Treatment==

Speech and language therapy are typically used as a treatment. There are no medical or surgical treatments. Treatment for Aphasia is generally individualized, focusing on specific language and communication improvements, and regular exercise with communication tasks. Regular therapy for conduction aphasics has been shown to result in steady improvement on the Western Aphasia Battery. The Western Aphasia Battery assesses neurological disorders to discern the degree and type of aphasia present. The test also discerns a person&#x27;s strengths and weaknesses, which can be used to treat the person better. Therapists should customize their treatment for each patient. The main focus for during speech therapy for conduction aphasia person is to strengthen correct word usage and auditory comprehension. A major goal is to focus on repetition.

==History==

In the late 19th century, Paul Broca studied person with expressive aphasia. These person had lesions in the anterior perisylvian region (now known as Broca&#x27;s area), and produced halting and labored speech, lacking in function words and grammar.

For example:Clinician: What brought you to the hospital?

Patient: yes ... ah ... Monday ... ah ... Dad ... Peter Hogan, and Dad ... ah ... hospital ... and ah ... Wednesday ... Wednesday ... nine o&#x27;clock and ah Thursday ... ten o&#x27;clock ... doctors two ... two ... an doctors and ... ah ... teeth ... yah ... and a doctor an girl ... and gums, an I.Comprehension is generally preserved, although there can be deficits in interpretation of complex sentences. In an extreme example, one of his person could only produce a single syllable, &quot;Tan&quot;.

Meanwhile, Carl Wernicke described person with receptive aphasia, who had damage to the left posterior superior temporal lobe, which he named &quot;the area of word images&quot;. These person could speak fluently, but their speech lacked meaning. They had a severe deficit in auditory comprehension. For example, &quot;Clinician: What brings you to the hospital?

The two disorders (expressive and receptive aphasias) thus seemed complementary, and corresponded to two distinct anatomical locations.

Wernicke predicted the existence of conduction aphasia in his landmark 1874 monograph, . He was the first to distinguish the various aphasias in an anatomical framework, and proposed that a disconnection between the two speech systems (motor and sensory) would lead to a unique condition, distinct from both expressive and receptive aphasias, which he termed &quot;Leitungsaphasie&quot;. He did not explicitly predict the repetition deficit, but did note that, unlike those with Wernicke&#x27;s aphasia, conduction aphasics would be able to comprehend speech properly, and intriguingly, would be able to hear and understand their own speech errors, leading to frustration and self-correction.

Wernicke was influenced by Theodor Meynert, his mentor, who postulated that aphasias were due to perisylvian lesions. Meynert also distinguished between the posterior and anterior language systems, leading Wernicke to localize the two regions. Wernicke&#x27;s research into the fiber pathways connecting the posterior and anterior regions lead him to theorize that damage to the fibers under the insula would lead to conduction aphasia. Ludwig Lichtheim expanded on Wernicke&#x27;s work, although he labeled the disorder &quot;commissural aphasia&quot;, to distinguish between aphasias tied to processing centers.

Sigmund Freud would argue in 1891 that the old framework was inaccurate; the entire perisylvian area, from the posterior to the anterior regions, were equivalent in facilitating speech function. In 1948 Kurt Goldstein postulated that spoken language was a central phenomenon, as opposed to a differentiated and disparate set of functionally distinct modules. To Freud and Goldstein, conduction aphasia was thus the result of a central, core language breakdown; Goldstein labeled the disorder &quot;central aphasia&quot;.

Later work and examination of brain structures, however, implicated the arcuate fasciculus, a white matter bundle connecting the posterior temporoparietal junction with the frontal cortex. Norman Geschwind proposed that damage to this bundle caused conduction aphasia; the characteristic deficits in auditory repetition were due to failed transmission of information between the two language centers. Studies showed that conduction aphasics had an intact &#x27;inner voice&#x27;, which discredited the central deficit model of Freud and Goldstein. The Wernicke-–Lichtheim–Geschwind disconnection hypothesis thus became the prevailing explanation for conduction aphasia. However, recent reviews and research have cast doubt on the singular role of the arcuate fasciculus and the model of spoken language in general.

<doc id="760918" wikidata="Q1263617" url="?curid=760918" title="Common bile duct">
<text>The bile duct (formerly known as the common bile duct) is a part of the biliary tract. It is formed by the union of the common hepatic duct and cystic duct. It ends by uniting with the pancreatic duct to form the hepatopancreatic ampulla. It possesses its sphincter to enable the regulation of bile flow.

== Anatomy ==
The bile duct is some 6–8 cm long, and normally up to 8 mm in diameter.

Its proximal supraduodenal part is situated within the free edge of the lesser omentum. Its middle retroduodenal part is oriented inferiorly and right-ward, and is situated posterior to the first part of the duodenum, and anterior to the inferior vena cava. Its distal paraduodenal part is oriented still more right-ward, is accommodated by a groove upon (sometimes a channel within) the posterior aspect of the head of the pancreas, and is situated anterior to the right renal vein.

The bile duct terminates by uniting with the pancreatic duct (at an angle of about 60°) to form the hepatopancreatic ampulla.

The distal extremity of the bile duct invariably features its own sphincteric muscle (the pancreatic duct and the hepatopancreatic ampulla usually possess sphincters of their own to allow the flow of pancreatic juice to be regulated independently, however, these two can be absent).

==Clinical significance==
Several problems can arise within the common bile duct, usually related to its obstruction. Opinions vary slightly on the maximum calibre of a normal CBD, but 6 mm is one accepted upper limit of normal with a further 1mm diameter allowed for each decade over 60 years.

It normally gets slightly dilated after cholecystectomy, with upper limit (95% prediction interval) being about 10 mm after a few months.

On abdominal ultrasonography, the common bile duct is most readily seen in the porta hepatis (where the CBD lies anterior to the portal vein and hepatic artery). The absence of Doppler signal distinguishes it from the portal vein and hepatic artery.

=== Obstruction ===
Tumours in the head of the pancreas may come to obstruct the distal bile duct.

If obstructed by a gallstone, a condition called choledocholithiasis can result. In this obstructed state, the duct is especially vulnerable to an infection called ascending cholangitis. One form of treatment is a cholecystenterostomy. Rare deformities of the common bile duct are cystic dilations (4 cm), choledochoceles (cystic dilation of the ampula of Vater (3–8 cm)), and biliary atresia.

==History==
Obstruction of the common bile duct and related jaundice has been documented since at least since the time of Erasistratus.

<text>Strathmore, or Strathmore &quot;By the Park&quot; Subdivision, is a neighborhood in the southwest of Syracuse, New York, United States. It is a mostly residential neighborhood that has many houses from the early and middle of the twentieth century.

== History ==
The subdivision was planned by 1917 and developed in 1919 by Clark &amp; Porter, Inc. Marketing materials stated &quot;...no smoke, no dirt, no fogs, no two-family or apartment houses, no business places of any kind, nothing but homes.&quot; An extension of the middle class and upper middle class Summit Avenue residential neighborhood on the other side of Onondaga Park and Hiawatha Lake, Strathmore was marketed as &quot;an exclusive residential district&quot; when it officially opened on September 27, 1919. It attracted solidly middle class and upper middle class residents into various enclaves such as Robineau Road. The original advertisement flyer proclaimed &quot;There can be no cheap homes in Strathmore by the Park&quot;, referring to Onondaga Park. Strathmore was zoned strictly residential, allowing for only single-family and two-family homes with a garage. It also contains many rental properties in the &quot;less greater&quot; section past Summit Ave.

Today, the neighborhood remains desirable and attracts a diverse, solidly middle and upper middle class population of white collar, academic, and creative class professionals. Strathmore is characterized by its Garden City town planning principles, bucolic tree-lined streets, and residential architecture of well-built Colonial Revival, Georgian, Federal, Norman French, Tudor, and Arts and Crafts style homes. During the annual Strathmore House Tour, five renovated houses are open to the public. In 1987, Onondaga Park became an official Syracuse Historic Preservation District.

It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2006. Strathmore homes designed by Ward Wellington Ward which are listed on the National Register of Historic Places are:
*Clark House, 105 Strathmore Drive
*Dunfee House, 206 Summit Avenue
*Fairchild House, 111 Clairmont Ave
*Hunziker House, 265 Robineau Road
*Porter House, 106 Strathmore Drive
*Sanford House, 211 Summit Ave 
*Stowell House, 225 Robineau Road
*White House, 176 Robineau Road

Other listings on the National Register of Historic Places are the Huntley Apartments, Onondaga Highlands-Swaneola Heights Historic District, Onondaga Park, and Strathmore &quot;By the Park&quot; Subdivision.

<text>Elwell Stephen Otis (March 25, 1838 – October 21, 1909) was a United States Army general who served in the American Civil War, Indian Wars, the Philippines late in the Spanish–American War and during the Philippine–American War.

==Biography==
Otis was born in Frederick, Maryland on March 25, 1838. He attended the University of Rochester, where he was a member of the Iota chapter of St. Anthony Hall aka the Fraternity of Delta Psi. He graduated from Harvard Law School in 1860 and was practicing law during the first year of the Civil War.

===Civil War===
During the American Civil War, Otis was appointed captain in the 140th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment formed in Rochester, NY in September 1862. He fought at the battles of Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville and Gettysburg. On December 23, 1863, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel of his regiment. At the Battle of Spotsylvania the regiment&#x27;s colonel was killed and Otis assumed command. He fought in all the battles of the Overland Campaign. During the Siege of Petersburg, he assumed command of the 1st Brigade, 2nd Division in V Corps leading it into action at the Battle of Peebles&#x27; Farm. During this battle he was severely wounded, which effectively ended his field career during the Civil War. He was promoted to brevet brigadier general of volunteers for actions at Peebles&#x27; Farm. Otis eventually recovered and was appointed lieutenant colonel of the 22nd U.S. Infantry in 1867.

===Indian Wars===
Otis continued serving in the army during the Indian Wars as part of the 22nd U.S. including campaigning in Montana in the aftermath of the Battle of the Little Bighorn. On February 8, 1880, he was appointed colonel of the 20th U.S. Infantry. On November 28, 1893, he was appointed brigadier general in the regular army. He later commanded the Department of the Columbia and the Department of Colorado.

===Philippine–American War===
On May 4, 1898, he was appointed major general of volunteers and was sent to the Philippines with reinforcements for General Wesley Merritt. Otis assumed command of the Eighth Army Corps, replacing Merritt, who had become the military governor of the Philippines. Merritt served as military governor only briefly before he returned to the United States. On August 28, 1898, Otis was appointed Military Governor for the Philippines.

He also continued in command of Eighth Corps during the Philippine–American War. He conducted the U.S. Army during the Battle of Manila in 1899 and during the first phase of the insurrection before fighting turned primarily to guerrilla warfare. When Filipino General Emilio Aguinaldo tried to stop the war by sending an emissary to General Otis to appeal for an end to the fighting in the Second Battle of Manila, Otis rejected it, insisting that &quot;fighting, having begun, must go on to the grim end.&quot;

In May 1899, the American Anti-Imperialist League published a pamphlet of letters allegedly written by U.S. soldiers in the Philippines that documented numerous atrocities committed by troops, leading to a wide public backlash against Otis and the war. In response, Otis denied to the press that any abuses had been committed, and tracked down the authors of the letters, threatening them with a court-martial if they did not immediately write a retraction. Despite his attempts to prevent reports of atrocities from reaching the press, Otis did admit that he suspected his troops of having committed atrocities, stating:

===Later life===
He was relieved of command in 1900 and replaced by Arthur MacArthur Jr., the father of Douglas MacArthur. He returned to the United States and commanded the Department of the Lakes. He was appointed major general in the regular army in 1906.

Otis was a skilled general and able administrator. However, he was generally disliked by his subordinates and peers and received harsh treatment in the press. He was known as &quot;Granny&quot; by his troops because of his age and graying hair. On the other hand, Rudolph Rau writes of Otis&#x27; work in the Philippines that &quot;He delegated no authority, was pompous and fuzzy, and inspired few&quot;. He died in Rochester, New York on October 21, 1909, from painful angina.

===Family===
Elwell S. Otis married twice. His first wife was Louise Selden. They married in 1870, and had two daughters:
# Laura Lu Otis born 1872 in North Dakota. Married Harry K. Elston.
# Mary L. Otis born 1875 in New York. Married Ralph Isham.
His second wife was Louisa Bowman, the daughter of Alexander Hamilton Bowman and Marie Louisa Collins. The couple had one child. They were married in 1878.
# Louise B. Otis born February 21, 1882, in Kansas and died December 27, 1963, in Santa Barbara, California. She married George Wagner.

Louisa &quot;Lulu&quot; Otis, the widow of Elwell Otis died in Santa Barbara, California on June 8, 1934.
==Legacy==
For many years on June 15, Rochester, New York celebrated Otis Day. This is no longer the case.

==Portrayal in the media==
* Portrayed by E.A. Rocha in the Philippine film, &quot;Heneral Luna&quot; (2015), and its sequel, &quot;&quot; (2018).

<text>Bok choy (American English, Canadian English, and Australian English), pak choi (British English, South African English, and Caribbean English) or pok choi is a type of Chinese cabbage (&quot;Brassica rapa&quot; subsp. &quot;chinensis&quot;) cultivated as a leaf vegetable to be used as food. Varieties do not form heads and have green leaf blades with lighter bulbous bottoms instead, forming a cluster reminiscent of mustard greens. Its flavor is described as being between spinach and water chestnuts but slightly sweeter, with a mildly peppery undertone. The green leaves have a stronger flavor than the white bulb.

&quot;Chinensis&quot; varieties are popular in southern China, East Asia, and Southeast Asia. Being winter-hardy, they are increasingly grown in Northern Europe. Originally classified as &quot;Brassica chinensis&quot; by Carl Linnaeus, they are now considered a subspecies of &quot;Brassica rapa.&quot;They are a member of the family Brassicaceae.

==Spelling and naming variations==
Other than the term &quot;Chinese cabbage&quot;, the most widely used name in North America for the &quot;chinensis&quot; variety is &quot;bok choy&quot; (Cantonese for &quot;white vegetable&quot;) or &quot;siu bok choy&quot; (Cantonese, for &quot;small white vegetable&quot;, as opposed to &quot;dai bok choy&quot; meaning &quot;big white vegetable&quot;, referring to the larger Napa cabbage). It is also sometimes spelled as &quot;pak choi&quot;, &quot;bok choi&quot;, and &quot;pak choy&quot;. In the UK, South Africa, and the Caribbean the term &quot;pak choi&quot; is used. Less commonly, the names &quot;Chinese chard&quot;, &quot;Chinese mustard&quot;, &quot;celery mustard&quot;, and &quot;spoon cabbage&quot; are also used.

There are two main types of bok choy, collectively called &quot;xiǎo bái cài&quot; (&quot;small white vegetable&quot;) in Mandarin. One is white bok choy () with dark green blades and white stalks, which is primarily cultivated in South China, and in Cantonese it is simply called &quot;baak choi&quot; (; the same characters pronounced &quot;bái cǎi&quot; by Mandarin speakers are preferably used for Napa cabbage). The other is green bok choy (; ; ; ; ) with light green stalks, which is more common in East China; the young and tender plants of green bok choy is called baby bok choy (), which is less crisp and therefore may become too soft if overcooked.

In Australia, the New South Wales Department of Primary Industries has redefined many transcribed names to refer to specific cultivars. They have introduced the word &quot;buk choy&quot; to refer white bok choy and redefined &quot;pak choy&quot; to refer to green bok choy.

==Uses==
===Cooking===

Bok choy cooks in 2 to 3 minutes by steaming, stir-frying, or simmering in water (8 minutes if steamed whole). The leaves cook faster than the stem. It is often used in similar ways to other leafy vegetables such as spinach and cabbage. It can also be eaten raw. It is commonly used in salads.

===Preserving===
Dried bok choy is saltier and sweeter. Pickled bok choy remains edible for months. Immature plants have the sweetest, tenderest stems and leaves.

==Nutritional value==
The raw vegetable is 95% water, 2% carbohydrates, 1% protein and less than 1% fat. In a reference serving, raw bok choy provides 54 kilojoules (13 food calories) of food energy and is a rich source (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of vitamin A (30% DV), vitamin C (54% DV) and vitamin K (44% DV), while providing folate, vitamin B6 and calcium in moderate amounts (10–17% DV).

==History==

Bok choy evolved from the mustard plant in China, where it has been cultivated since the 5th century CE. It can be traced to the Yangtze River delta area, one of the world&#x27;s oldest agricultural regions. It also has been traced to the Yellow River Valley where archaeologists found Chinese cabbage seeds dating back 6,000 years.

As bok choy grew in use, it spread to other parts of Asia and was eventually cultivated in countries such as Japan, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. Bok choy plantations were present in Japan and Malaya by the early 19th century. In Malaya, bok choy was not commonly consumed by the poor. 

The vegetable was introduced to Europe in the mid-18th century. A Swede named Osbeck brought bok choy seeds to Europe during the same time period Jesuit missionaries brought similar strains of the vegetable to German scientists working in Russia. Bok choy was introduced to North America in the 19th century, but did not gain in use for another century.

<text>Yoko Tsuno is a comics album series created by the Belgian writer Roger Leloup published by Dupuis in &quot;Spirou&quot; magazine since its debut in 1970. Through thirty volumes, the series tell the adventures of Yoko Tsuno, a female electrical engineer of Japanese origin surrounded by her close friends, Vic Video and Pol Pitron (see Yoko Tsuno characters). Their adventures bring them to, among other places, Belgium (Bruges), Germany, Scotland, Japan, Hong Kong, Indonesia and also into outer space. The stories are heavily technology driven, with concepts like robot dragons (&quot;Le Dragon de Hong Kong&quot;), suspended animation (&quot;La Frontière de la vie&quot;), time travel (&quot;La Spirale du temps&quot; and others), and even an alien species called the Vineans. Despite the often exotic settings and science-fiction plot lines, the stories generally remain realistic on the personal level between the characters and friendship, love and spirituality are some of the key themes of the series. The art is drawn in Ligne claire style, although having originally started out in the Marcinelle style. When depicting real-world settings, Leloup aspires to be as true to reality as possible, with places like Burg Katz or Rothenburg ob der Tauber depicted with almost photographic skill.

==Publication history==

&quot;Yoko Tsuno&quot; first appeared in the Franco-Belgian comics magazine &quot;Spirou&quot; on September 24, 1970 with the 8 page short &quot;Hold–up en hi–fi&quot;. This and the following two shorter works &quot;La belle et la bête&quot; and &quot;Cap 351&quot; served as precursors for the first full-length &quot;Yoko Tsuno&quot; adventure, &quot;Le trio de l&#x27;étrange&quot; serialised in &quot;Spirou&quot; from May 13, 1971. Staying with &quot;Spirou&quot; for the following 30 years, the series still appears in the magazine to date. The series has accumulated 30 albums and has been collected in nine integral compilations.

==Characters==
===Yoko Tsuno===

Yoko Tsuno is an electronics engineer, raised in Japan but now living in Belgium. She is quite compassionate and has a knack for making friends. Yoko is also a skilled scuba diver, holds a black belt in aikido, and can pilot jets, gliders and helicopters. This wide range of competences, together with her near-flawless behaviour, makes Yoko fall into the classic category of a competent woman. The flaw she does admit to having is the typically Japanese trait of valuing personal honour highly, which leads her at times to be trusting to the point of blindness.
Yoko Tsuno&#x27;s first name was inspired by Japanese actress Yoko Tani.

===Vic Video===
Vic Video (, but sometimes also referred to as Max): He has a strong personality, and is a close friend of Yoko (whom he seems to be in love with, though this is only hinted at). Before meeting Yoko, he directed live TV shows. He is often the voice of reason and prudence moderating Yoko&#x27;s impulsiveness. Vic appears in all albums except &quot;Aventures électroniques&quot;, &quot;L&#x27;Or du Rhin&quot; and &quot;La Pagode des brumes&quot;.

===Pol Pitron===
Pol Pitron (, ) is the comic relief of the trio. His name comes from French &quot;pitre&quot;, literally &quot;clown&quot;. Before meeting Yoko, he worked as a camera operator under direction of Vic. Pol is often lazy and grumpy, as well as a real gourmet. He is also playful and thus quite fond of children, and during a time travel adventure to 16th century Bruges, he gains a fiancée named Mieke, which brings his childish side down by some degrees (&quot;L&#x27;Astrologue de Bruges&quot;).&lt;br&gt;Pol appears in all albums except &quot;La Pagode des brumes&quot;, although he appears in only two stories of &quot;Aventures électroniques&quot;. Where almost all other characters in the comics are drawn realistically anatomically speaking, in the early albums, Pol&#x27;s nose and eyes are cartoonishly large and round.

===Khany===
Khany is a member of the extraterrestrial race of Vineans, who left their planet when it faced destruction by its twin suns and erected secret subterranean colonies on various habitable planets, including Earth. As of the end of &quot;La Forge de Vulcain&quot; and the fall of Karpan&#x27;s leadership, she is also their undeclared leader who directs the return of the Vineans from Earth to Vinea. She is also undertaking expeditions to find lost Vinean colonies. Like Vic, she is quite careful in her actions. Khany appears in &quot;Le Trio de l&#x27;étrange&quot;, &quot;La Forge de Vulcain&quot;, &quot;Les Trois soleils de Vinéa&quot;, &quot;Les Titans&quot;, &quot;La Lumière d&#x27;Ixo&quot;, &quot;Les Archanges de Vinéa&quot;, &quot;Les Exilés de Kifa&quot;, &quot;La Porte des âmes&quot;, &quot;La Servante de Lucifer&quot; and &quot;Le Secret de Khâny&quot;.

===Poky===
Khany&#x27;s younger sister, and originally her twin sister, who was revived from suspended animation much later than Khany after their arrival on Earth and has thus remained a child. She is quite attached to Yoko and has become close friends with Morning Dew. She appears, nearly always at her sister&#x27;s side, in &quot;Le Trio de l&#x27;étrange&quot;, &quot;La Forge de Vulcain&quot;, &quot;Les Trois Soleils de Vinéa&quot;, &quot;Les Titans&quot;, &quot;La Lumière d&#x27;Ixo&quot;, &quot;Les Archanges de Vinéa&quot;, &quot;Les Exilés de Kifa&quot;, &quot;La Porte des âmes&quot;, &quot;La Servante de Lucifer&quot; and &quot;Le Secret de Khâny&quot;.

===Rosée du Matin===
Rosée du Matin (&quot;Morning Dew&quot;; Dutch: &quot;Roosje&quot;; German: &quot;Morgentau&quot;) is Yoko&#x27;s adopted Chinese daughter, as of &quot;Le Dragon de Hong Kong&quot;. The child of two biologists who experimented with the artificial enlargement of animals, she was orphaned when her parents perished in a storm. She had been raised by her grandfather, but due to his deteriorating health, he entrusted guardianship to Yoko. She has so far also participated in Yoko&#x27;s time travel exploits and her trips into outer space. Rosée appears in all albums from &quot;Le Dragon de Hong Kong&quot; onwards. She was inspired by Leloup&#x27;s daughter, adopted from Korea.

===Ingrid Hallberg===
A German organist who becomes one of Yoko&#x27;s closest friends after Yoko helped solve the mystery of her father&#x27;s murder in &quot;L&#x27;Orgue du Diable&quot;. While she has never met them, Ingrid also knows about Yoko&#x27;s connection to the Vineans (&quot;Le Temple des immortels&quot;). She has since appeared in &quot;La Frontière de la vie&quot;, &quot;Le Feu de Wotan&quot;, &quot;L&#x27;Or du Rhin&quot; and &quot;Le Temple des immortels&quot;.

===Monya===
Monya is a fourteen-year-old time traveler from 3872, whom Yoko meets during the events described in &quot;La Spirale du temps&quot;. After changing history during this adventure, Monya is unable to return to her native time. She is adopted by Yoko&#x27;s cousin and the two girls become fast friends. With the help of Monya&#x27;s time machine, the &quot;translateur&quot;, Yoko and her friends undertake several time-travelling adventures.

===Emilia===
A spirited fourteen-year-old girl of Scottish-Russian descent, who appears in the series as of &quot;Le Septième Code&quot;. While she is not a skilled violin player as her mother was (and wanted her daughter to be), she demonstrates a natural aptitude for piloting. In &quot;La Servante de Lucifer&quot;, she is also revealed to have some latent telepathic talent.

===Myna and Angela===
Two female Vinean nursery androids. While Myna is an older construct from before the Vinean exodus (&quot;Les Exilés de Kifa&quot;), Angela was built as a gift for Morning Dew based on a children&#x27;s book Morning Dew had left behind during a previous visit on Vinea (&quot;La Servante de Lucifer&quot;).

===Akina===
A benevolent artificial intelligence which was once the controlling element in a spacecraft owned by Gobol, the antagonist of &quot;Les Exilés de Kifa&quot;. When Yoko uses the ship to escape Kifa, the AI accepts her as her new master after Yoko christens her with the first name (of an old school rival) that comes into her mind. A copy of Akina accompanies Yoko in subsequent stories, stored in a hand computer.

===Bonnie===
A young half-African girl from Kenya who was sired by Emilia&#x27;s great-granduncle in the early 20th century and taken in by his brother (Sir Archibald, Emilia&#x27;s great-grandfather) and sister-in-law. Not feeling at home in Europe because of her mixed-race heritage and the resulting social prejudice, she accompanied Yoko and Emilia, who had journeyed into the past, back to the 21st century, where she has taken up permanent residence (&quot;Le Maléfice de l&#x27;améthyste&quot;).

==Synopsis==
Yoko Tsuno first meets Vic and Pol when they catch her trying to break into a laboratory in &quot;Le Trio de l&#x27;étrange&quot;. The moment the men confront her, the owner of the laboratory explains that he hired the Japanese girl to test a burglar alarm system. Vic, intrigued by Yoko&#x27;s knowledge in electrical engineering and planning to do an independent television production with Pol as the cameraman, asks Yoko to come along. However, their filming operation turns out to become the first of a whole series of strange adventures, as they stumble upon a secret underground enclave inhabited by a highly advanced, blue-skinned people, the Vineans. This adventure forges a strong friendship between the three, inspiring them to stay together as the &quot;Strange Trio&quot;, who join each other on surreal adventures on Earth, in outer space, and even the depths of bygone times.

The main characters are based in Belgium, although adventures take place around the world and even in the Vinean solar system, 2,500,000 light years away. When the stories are Earth-based, they mostly take place in existing settings, such as the German locations Burg Katz and Rothenburg ob der Tauber, Hong Kong, or the Belgian city of Bruges.

==Books==
===Albums===
===&quot;L&#x27;Écume de l&#x27;aube&quot;===
Roger Leloup also wrote a novel with Yoko as the heroine, published in 1991: &quot;L&#x27;Écume de l&#x27;aube&quot; (&quot;The Froth of Dawn&quot;) (), which relates the childhood and youth of Yoko Tsuno.

==Translations==
Books from the Yoko Tsuno series have been translated from French to sixteen languages: Basque, Catalan, Chinese, Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, German, Greek, Icelandic, Indonesian, Italian, Norwegian, Portuguese, Spanish and Swedish.

===English translations===

As of 2015, only a limited number of Yoko Tsuno comics have been translated to English. Books #3 and 6 (&quot;La Forge de Vulcain&quot; and &quot;Les Trois Soleils de Vinéa&quot;) were released in English in 1989 under the series title, &quot;The Adventures of Yoko, Vic and Paul&quot; by Catalan Communications under their &quot;Comcat&quot; line. Some liberties were taken in the translation to English. For example, Yoko&#x27;s last name was changed to &quot;Suno&quot;, Khany was renamed &quot;Kani&quot; and the Vineans became &quot;Vinans&quot; from the planet &quot;Vina&quot;. Plot transitions between individual episodes were also altered; for instance, at the conclusion of &quot;The Prey and the Ghost&quot; (original issue #12), Vic tells Yoko in the original version that he was contacted by Khany, leading to the events of issue #13, &quot;The Archangels of Vinea&quot;; in the English translation, instead he tells her that it was her father who gave him a message for her, which in the Comcat line of continuity would lead to &quot;Daughter of the Wind&quot; (original issue #9).

Comcat planned next on reprinting books nos. 8, 10, 13, and possibly no. 17, but the company went under.

<doc id="760931" wikidata="Q5021305" url="?curid=760931" title="People v. Freeman">
<text>People v. Freeman was a criminal prosecution of Harold Freeman, a producer and director of pornographic films, by the U.S. state of California. Freeman was charged in 1987 with pandering - procurement of persons &quot;for the purpose of prostitution&quot; - under section 266i of the Cal. Penal Code for hiring adult actors, which the prosecution characterized as pimping. The prosecution was part of an attempt by California to shut down the pornographic film industry. The prosecution&#x27;s characterization was ultimately rejected on appeal by the California Supreme Court. Prior to this decision, pornographic films had often been shot in secret locations.

Freeman was initially convicted, and lost on appeal to the California Court of Appeal. The trial judge, however, thought jail would be an unreasonably harsh penalty for Freeman&#x27;s conduct, and sentenced him to probation, despite the fact that this was explicitly contrary to the statute. The State appealed this sentence but lost.

Freeman appealed to the California Supreme Court, which subsequently overturned his conviction, finding that the California pandering statute was not intended to cover the hiring of actors who would be engaging in sexually explicit but non-obscene performances. Freeman could only have been lawfully convicted of pandering if he had paid the actors for the purpose of sexually gratifying himself or the actors. The court relied upon the language of the statute for this interpretation, as well as the need to avoid a conflict with the First Amendment right to free speech. The court viewed Freeman&#x27;s conviction as &quot;a somewhat transparent attempt at an &#x27;end run&#x27; around the First Amendment and the state obscenity laws.&quot;

The State of California unsuccessfully tried to have this judgment overturned by the United States Supreme Court. Justice Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor denied a stay of the California Supreme Court&#x27;s judgment, while being critical of its First Amendment reasoning noting &quot;it must certainly be true that otherwise illegal conduct is not made legal by being filmed&quot; she found it unlikely the petition for certiorari would be granted because the California Supreme Court&#x27;s ruling was founded on an adequate and independent basis of state law. The full Court subsequently denied the petition for &quot;certiorari&quot;.

As a result, the making of hardcore pornography was effectively legalized in California.

In 2008, in the case of &quot;New Hampshire v. Theriault&quot;, the New Hampshire Supreme Court adopted the distinction between pornography production and prostitution in their interpretation of The New Hampshire Constitutions&#x27; free speech clause.

<doc id="760932" wikidata="Q6288018" url="?curid=760932" title="Joseph Wilton">
<text>Joseph Wilton (16 July 1722 – 25 November 1803) was an English sculptor. He was one of the founding members of the Royal Academy in 1768, and the academy&#x27;s third keeper.
His works are particularly numerous memorialising the famous Britons in Westminster Abbey.

==Life==
He was born the son of an ornamental plasterer in the Charing Cross area of London, where his father had sculpted the ceilings of the Foundling Hospital. His father wished that Joseph should become a civil engineer but instead Joseph strongly desired to be a sculptor.

Wilton initially trained under Laurent Delvaux at Nivelles, in present-day Belgium. In 1744 he left Nivelles and went to the Academy in Paris to study under Jean-Baptiste Pigalle. In 1752 he went to Italy with his sculptor friend Louis-François Roubiliac to learn to sculpt in marble, and stayed for seven years, living first in Rome and then in Florence. Whilst in Rome he met and befriended his first patron, William Locke of Norbury, who thereafter accompanied Wilton on his tour of Italy. Like many other artists of the day, he studied antiquities, and made numerous plaster casts and marble copies of classic works – many of these later formed the collection of Charles Lennox, 3rd Duke of Richmond at Richmond House in west London. A marble bust of the physician and scholar Antonio Cocchi, carved by Wilton in 1755, his last year in Italy, is in the collection of the Victoria and Albert Museum. Influenced by Wilton&#x27;s study of antique busts, it was considered by Margaret Whinney to be one of Wilton&#x27;s most distinguished works.

While in Florence he made the acquaintance of the Florentine painter Giovanni Battista Cipriani. When Wilton and the architect William Chambers returned to England, in August 1755, Cipriani went with them.
Once back in London, Wilton was named co-director of Lennox&#x27;s Richmond House gallery, and established a workshop. He built up a considerable practice, making busts and monuments, including the memorial to James Wolfe in Westminster Abbey. He made at least two marble busts of Oliver Cromwell, which he showed at the Society of Artists, in 1761 and 1761, basing the likeness on a cast of Cromwell&#x27;s face. One marble version, and the terracotta model for it, is in the collection of the Victoria and Albert Museum.

In 1761, he was first commissioned to produce a statue of King George III. Similar commissions followed, including one in 1766 from New York City. This massive statue portrayed the king on horseback in Roman garb, and was cast in lead and gilded before being shipped to America and erected at Bowling Green, near the tip of Manhattan in August 1770. It did not last long, being torn down by patriots in July 1776.

Wilton&#x27;s other works include many notable busts, monuments (e.g. Stephen Hales&#x27; memorial in Westminster Abbey, London) and other carvings including fireplaces and tables.

In 1768, when Wilton was perhaps at the peak of his powers, he was elected a founder member of the Royal Academy. However, that year also saw him inherit his father&#x27;s fortune and the new wealth diverted him away from sculpture to a life of dissolution. In 1786 he was forced to sell most of his possessions and in 1793 he was officially declared bankrupt. In 1790 he was appointed Keeper of the Royal Academy, a post he kept until his death in 1803. He was buried at St Mary the Virgin, Wanstead in east London.

<text>Todor Petrov Kolev (; 26 August 1939 – 15 February 2013) was a leading Bulgarian film and stage actor, singer, comedian and TV presenter.

Born in Shumen, his first major film was &quot;Tsar i General&quot; &quot;(Tsar and General)&quot; in 1966. He has appeared in more than 30 films. He is best known to the Bulgarian audience by his roles in comedies such as &quot;Gospodin za edin den&quot; (&quot;King for a day&quot;), &quot;Dvoynikat&quot; (&quot;The Double&quot;), &quot;Prebroyavane na Divite Zaytsi&quot; (&quot;The Hare Census&quot;), &quot;Tsarska Piesa&quot; (&quot;Royal Play&quot;), &quot;Posledniyat Ergen&quot; (&quot;The Last Bachelor&quot;), &quot;Opasen Char&quot; (&quot;Dangerous Charm&quot;).

During the Communist rule, he was temporarily exiled from Sofia to Sliven for a joke he made in public that there were three Toshkos who made Bulgarians laugh (&quot;Toshko&quot; is the diminutive form of the name Todor in Bulgarian): the Communist leader Todor Zhivkov, the clown Toshko Kozarev and himself. However, in his biography &quot;Varnenskoto Sofianche Ot Shumen&quot;, Todor Kolev denies having ever said this.

Todor Kolev was a host of the late night TV show &quot;Kak Shte Gi Stignem with Todor Kolev&quot; (1994-1998) and &quot;Free Entry&quot; (1998-1999).

He died on 15 February 2013 in Sofia, after serious illness of lung cancer.

<text>Swiss Cottage is an area in the London Borough of Camden, England. It is centred on the junction of Avenue Road and Finchley Road and includes Swiss Cottage tube station. Swiss Cottage lies north-northwest of Charing Cross. The area was named after a public house in the centre of it, known as &quot;Ye Olde Swiss Cottage&quot;.

== History ==
=== Toponymy ===
According to the &quot;Dictionary of London Place Names&quot; (2001), the district is named after an inn called &quot;The Swiss Tavern&quot; that was built in 1804 in the style of a Swiss chalet on the site of a former tollgate keeper&#x27;s cottage, and later renamed &quot;Swiss Inn&quot; and in the early 20th century &quot;Swiss Cottage&quot;.

=== Urban development ===

The district formed part of the ancient parish of Hampstead. It developed following the Finchley Road Act 1826, which authorised construction of Finchley New Road and Avenue Road, with &quot;The Swiss Tavern&quot; built at the junction of the new roads. The neighbourhood around Finchley Road and Avenue Road was redeveloped in 1937 and 1938 with the opening of an Odeon cinema and the Regency Lodge flats. After World War II, local authority housing was constructed by the London County Council in the area. Council housing includes the five-tower Chalcots Estate built in the 1960s.

On 20 March 2014 a planning application was submitted for a 24-storey tower to be built next to Swiss Cottage tube station. The application was rejected by Camden Council on 11 September 2014 following mass local protests. A revised scheme received planning permission in 2016 but the developer, Essential Living, argued affordable housing requirements made the scheme uneconomic. After delaying construction for several years, it decided to start the originally approved building with construction expected to begin in 2023 and complete by 2025.

== Government ==
Swiss Cottage is in the Hampstead and Kilburn constituency, formed at the 2010 general election. It was formerly in the Hampstead and Highgate constituency, for which the MP was Glenda Jackson. It forms part of the Barnet and Camden London Assembly constituency. There is a Swiss Cottage electoral ward, electing councillors to Camden London Borough Council.

== Geography ==
Swiss Cottage is located north-northwest of Charing Cross. Adjoining neighbourhoods include Hampstead Village to the northeast, Chalk Farm and Camden Town to the southeast, Belsize Park to the east, St John&#x27;s Wood to the south and West Hampstead to the west. Regent&#x27;s Park is within walking distance of Swiss Cottage (about 1.4 km). Adelaide Road runs eastwards to Chalk Farm.

It is bounded by five conservation areas; Belsize, Elsworthy, Fitzjohns-Netherhall, South Hampstead, St. John&#x27;s Wood (Camden) and St. John&#x27;s Wood (Westminster).

Swiss Cottage includes part of the NW3, NW6 and NW8 postal areas.

== Demography ==
According to the 2011 census, Swiss Cottage had a population of 12,900. 67% of the Swiss Cottage ward population was white (40% British, 25% Other, 2% Irish). 7% was Other Asian and 5% Indian. 33% were Christians, 24% irreligious, 11% Jewish and 10% Muslim.

== Economy ==
Swiss Cottage/Finchley Road is identified as a district centre in the London Plan and there are assorted shops the length of the Finchley Road. Local major hotels include Marriott Regents Park, Danubius Regents Park, and Hampstead Britannia Hotel. There are many smaller hotels in the area. Notable restaurants provide European, South-east Asian, and Japanese cuisine.

== Transport ==
The area is served by two London Underground stations Swiss Cottage station (Jubilee line) and Finchley Road station (Jubilee line and Metropolitan line) and is a local hub for London Buses. The former Swiss Cottage station was opened by the Metropolitan Railway in 1868; the current station dates from 1939. London Overground stations South Hampstead station (Lioness line) and Finchley Road &amp; Frognal station (Mildmay line) are also nearby. Swiss Cottage is also served by National coaches through the Finchley Road Coach Stop.

Local bus routes are:
* 13 – North Finchley to Victoria
* 31 – White City to Camden Town
* 46 – St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital to Paddington
* 113 – Edgware to Marble Arch
* 187 – Finchley Road O2 Centre to Central Middlesex Hospital
* 268 – Golders Green to Finchley Road O2 Centre
* 603 – Muswell Hill to Swiss Cottage
* C11 – Brent Cross Shopping Centre to Archway
* N28 – Wandsworth to Camden Town
* N31 – Clapham Junction to Camden Town
* N113 – Edgware to Trafalgar Square

== Culture ==
Swiss Cottage is a cultural centre within Camden and north-west London. Local amenities include an Odeon IMAX Cinema, Sir Basil Spence&#x27;s Grade II-listed Swiss Cottage Central Library, O2 Centre and the Hampstead Theatre. Swiss Cottage is the location of the Royal Central School of Speech and Drama, resident at the Embassy Theatre on Eton Avenue. Swiss Cottage Leisure Centre reopened in early 2006 after redevelopment; it now has two swimming pools, a gym and a climbing wall.

Many of the area&#x27;s cityscapes and London street scenes, particularly of Swiss Cottage, Adamson Road, Eton Avenue and Belsize Park were represented by the Camden Town Group painter Robert Bevan and his wife, the Polish painter Stanisława de Karłowska. They lived at 14 Adamson Road and are commemorated with an English Heritage Blue Plaque.

<doc id="760951" wikidata="Q246068" url="?curid=760951" title="Cysticercosis">
<text>Cysticercosis is a tissue infection caused by the young form of the pork tapeworm.&lt;ref name=&quot;WHO Taeniasis/cysticercosis fact sheet&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; People may have few or no symptoms for years. In some cases, particularly in Asia, solid lumps of between one and two centimeters may develop under the skin. After months or years, these lumps can become painful and swollen and then resolve. A specific form called neurocysticercosis, which affects the brain, can cause neurological symptoms. In developing countries, this is one of the most common causes of seizures.
Cysticercosis is usually acquired by eating food or drinking water contaminated by tapeworms&#x27; eggs from human feces. Among foods egg-contaminated vegetables are a major source. The tapeworm eggs are present in the feces of a person infected with the adult worms, a condition known as taeniasis. Taeniasis, in the strict sense, is a different disease and is due to eating cysts in poorly cooked pork. People who live with someone with pork tapeworm have a greater risk of getting cysticercosis. The diagnosis can be made by aspiration of a cyst. Taking pictures of the brain with computer tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is most useful for the diagnosis of disease in the brain. An increased number of a type of white blood cell, called eosinophils, in the cerebral spinal fluid and blood is also an indicator.
Infection can be effectively prevented by personal hygiene and sanitation: this includes cooking pork well, proper toilets and sanitary practices, and improved access to clean water. Treating those with taeniasis is important to prevent spread. Treating the disease when it does not involve the nervous system may not be required. Treatment of those with neurocysticercosis may be with the medications praziquantel or albendazole. These may be required for long periods. Steroids, for anti-inflammation during treatment, and anti-seizure medications may also be required. Surgery is sometimes done to remove the cysts.
The pork tapeworm is particularly common in Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa, and Latin America. In some areas it is believed that up to 25% of people are affected. In the developed world it is very uncommon. Worldwide in 2015 it caused about 400 deaths. Cysticercosis also affects pigs and cows but rarely causes symptoms as most are slaughtered before symptoms arise. The disease has occurred in humans throughout history. It is one of the neglected tropical diseases.
==Signs and symptoms==

===Muscles===
Cysticerci can develop in any voluntary muscle. Invasion of muscle can cause inflammation of the muscle, with fever, eosinophilia, and increased size, which initiates with muscle swelling and later progress to atrophy and scarring. Usually, it is asymptomatic since the cysticerci die and become calcified.

===Nervous system===

The term neurocysticercosis is generally accepted to refer to cysts in the parenchyma of the brain. It presents with seizures and, less commonly, headaches. Cysticerca in brain parenchyma are usually 5–20 mm in diameter. In subarachnoid space and fissures, lesions may be as large as 6 cm in diameter and lobulated. They may be numerous and life-threatening.

Cysts located within the ventricles of the brain can block the outflow of cerebrospinal fluid and present with symptoms of increased intracranial pressure.

Racemose neurocysticercosis refers to cysts in the subarachnoid space. These can occasionally grow into large lobulated masses causing pressure on surrounding structures.

Spinal cord neurocysticercosis most commonly presents symptoms such as back pain and radiculopathy.

===Eyes===
In some cases, cysticerci may be found in the eyeball, extraocular muscles, and under the conjunctiva (&quot;subconjunctiva&quot;). Depending on the location, they may cause visual difficulties that fluctuate with eye position, retinal edema, hemorrhage, decreased vision, or even vision loss.

===Skin===
Subcutaneous cysts are firm, mobile nodules, occurring mainly on the trunk and extremities. Subcutaneous nodules are sometimes painful.

==Cause==

Human cysticercosis develops after ingestion of the egg form of &quot;Taenia solium&quot; (often abbreviated as &quot;T. solium&quot; and also called pork tapeworm), which is transmitted through the oral-fecal route. The eggs enter the intestine where they develop into oncosphere larvae by hatching. The larvae enter the bloodstream and invade host tissues, where they further develop into larvae called cysticerci. The cysticercus larva completes development in about two months. It is about 0.6 to 1.8 cm–long, translucent, ellipsoidal, and shiny white, containing one developing scolex.

==Diagnosis==
The traditional method of demonstrating either tapeworm eggs or proglottids in stool samples diagnoses only taeniasis, carriage of the tapeworm stage of the life cycle. Only a small minority of patients with cysticercosis will harbor a tapeworm, rendering stool studies ineffective for diagnosis. Ophthalmic cysticercosis can be diagnosed by visualizing parasite in eye by fundoscopy.

In cases of human cysticercosis, diagnosis is a sensitive problem and requires biopsy of the infected tissue or sophisticated instruments. &quot;Taenia solium&quot; eggs and proglottids found in feces, ELISA, or polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis diagnose only taeniasis and not cysticercosis. Radiological tests, such as X-ray, CT scans which demonstrate &quot;ring-enhancing brain lesions&quot;, and MRIs, can also be used to detect diseases. X-rays are used to identify calcified larvae in the subcutaneous and muscle tissues, and CT scans and MRIs are used to find lesions in the brain.

===Serological===
Antibodies to cysticerci can be demonstrated in serum by enzyme linked immunoelectrotransfer blot (EITB) assay and in CSF by ELISA. An immunoblot assay using lentil-lectin (agglutinin from &quot;Lens culinaris&quot;) is highly sensitive and specific. However, individuals with intracranial lesions and calcifications may be seronegative. In the CDC&#x27;s immunoblot assay, cysticercosis-specific antibodies can react with structural glycoprotein antigens from the larval cysts of &quot;Taenia solium&quot;. However, this is mainly a research tool not widely available in clinical practice and nearly unobtainable in resource-limited settings.

===Neurocysticercosis===
The diagnosis of neurocysticercosis is mainly clinical, based on a compatible presentation of symptoms and findings of imaging studies.

====Imaging====
Neuroimaging with CT or MRI is the most useful method of diagnosis. A CT scan shows both calcified and uncalcified cysts, as well as distinguishing active and inactive cysts. Cystic lesions can show ring enhancement and focal-enhancing lesions. Some cystic lesions, especially the ones in ventricles and subarachnoid space may not be visible on a CT scan, since the cyst fluid is isodense with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Thus diagnosis of extraparenchymal cysts usually relies on signs like hydrocephalus or enhanced basilar meninges. A CT scan with intraventricular contrast or MRI can be used. MRI is more sensitive in the detection of intraventricular cysts.

====CSF====
CSF findings include pleocytosis, elevated protein levels and depressed glucose levels; but these may not be always present.

==Prevention==
Cysticercosis is considered a “tools-ready disease” according to WHO. International Task Force for Disease Eradication in 1992 reported that cysticercosis is potentially eradicable. It is feasible because there are no animal reservoirs besides humans and pigs. The only source of &quot;Taenia solium&quot; infection for pigs is from humans, a definite host. Theoretically, breaking the life cycle seems easy by doing intervention strategies from various stages in the life cycle.

For example,
# Massive chemotherapy of infected individuals, improving sanitation, and educating people are all major ways to discontinue the cycle, in which eggs from human feces are transmitted to other humans and/or pigs.
# Cooking pork or freezing it and inspecting meat are effective means to cease the life cycle
# The management of pigs by treating them or vaccinating them is another possibility to intervene
# The separation of pigs from human feces by confining them in enclosed piggeries. In Western European countries post World War 2 the pig industry developed rapidly and most pigs were housed. This was the main reason for pig cysticercosis largely being eliminated from the region. This, of course, is not a quick answer to the problem in developing countries.

===Pigs===
The intervention strategies to eradicate cysticercosis include surveillance of pigs in foci of transmission and massive chemotherapy treatment of humans. In reality, control of &quot;T. solium&quot; by a single intervention, for instance, by treating only the human population will not work because the existing infected pigs can still carry on the cycle. The proposed strategy for eradication is to do multilateral intervention by treating both human and porcine populations. It is feasible because treating pigs with oxfendazole is effective and once treated, pigs are protected from further infections for at least 3 months.

===Limitations===
Even with the concurrent treatment of humans and pigs, complete elimination is hard to achieve. In one study conducted in 12 villages in Peru, both humans and pigs were treated with praziquantel and oxfendazole, with a coverage of more than 75% in humans and 90% in pigs The result shows a decrease in prevalence and incidence in the intervention area; however, the effect did not eliminate &quot;T. solium&quot;. The possible reason includes the incomplete coverage and re-infection. Even though &quot;T. solium &quot;could be eliminated through mass treatment of human and porcine population, it is not sustainable. Moreover, both tapeworm carriers of humans and pigs tend to spread the disease from endemic to non-endemic areas resulting in periodic outbreaks of cysticercosis or outbreaks in new areas.

===Vaccines===
Given that pigs are part of a life cycle, vaccinating pigs is another feasible intervention to eliminate cysticercosis. Research studies have been focusing on vaccines against cestode parasites since many immune cell types are found to be capable of destroying cysticercus. Many vaccine candidates are extracted from antigens of different cestodes such as &quot;Taenia solium&quot;, &quot;T. crassiceps&quot;, &quot;T. saginata&quot;, &quot;T. ovis&quot; and target oncospheres and/or cysticerci. In 1983, Molinari et al. reported the first vaccine candidate against porcine cysticercosis using antigen from cysticercus cellulosae drawn out from naturally infected animals. Recently, vaccines extracted from genetically engineered 45W-4B antigens have been successfully tested to pigs in an experimental condition. This type of vaccine can protect against cysticercosis in both Chinese and Mexican type of &quot;T. solium&quot;. However, it has not been tested in endemic field conditions, which is important because the realistic conditions in the field differ greatly from the experimental condition, and this can result in a great difference in the chances of infection and immune reaction.

Even though vaccines have been successfully generated, the feasibility of their production and usage in rural free-ranging pigs remains a challenge. If a vaccine is to be injected, the burden of work and the cost of vaccine administration to pigs will remain high and unrealistic. The incentives of using vaccines by pig owners will decrease if the vaccine administration to pigs takes time by injecting every single pig in their livestock. A hypothetical oral vaccine is proposed to be more effective as it can be easily delivered to the pigs by food.

====S3PVAC vaccine====
The vaccine constituted by 3 peptide synthetically produced (S3Pvac) has proven its efficacy in natural conditions of transmission. The S3PVAC vaccine so far, can be considered as the best vaccine candidate to be used in endemic areas such as Mexico (20). S3Pvac consists of three protective peptides: KETc12, KETc1, and GK1, whose sequences belong to native antigens that are present in the different developmental stages of &quot;T. solium&quot; and other cestode parasites.

Non-infected pigs from rural villages in Mexico were vaccinated with S3Pvac and the vaccine reduced the number of cysticerci by 98% and the prevalence by 50%. The diagnostic method involves necropsy and tongue inspection of pigs. The natural challenge conditions used in the study proved the efficacy of the S3Pvac vaccine in transmission control of &quot;T. solium&quot; in Mexico. The S3Pvac vaccine is owned by the National Autonomous University of Mexico and the method of high scale production of the vaccine has already been developed. The validation of the vaccine in agreement with the Secretary of Animal Health in Mexico is currently in the process of completion. It is also hoped that the vaccine will be well-accepted by pig owners because they also lose their income if pigs are infected cysticercosis. Vaccination of pigs against cysticercosis, if successful, can potentially have a great impact on transmission control since there is no chance of re-infection once pigs receive the vaccination.

===Other===
Cysticercosis can also be prevented by routine inspection of meat and condemnation of measly meat by the local government and by avoiding partially cooked meat products. However, in areas where food is scarce, cyst-infected meat might be considered as wasted since pork can provide high-quality protein. At times, infected pigs are consumed within the locality or sold at low prices to traffickers who take the uninspected pigs at urban areas for sale.

==Management==

===Neurocysticercosis===

Asymptomatic cysts, such as those discovered incidentally on neuroimaging done for another reason, may never lead to symptomatic disease and in many cases do not require therapy. Calcified cysts have already died and involuted. Seizures can also occur in individuals with only calcified cysts.
Neurocysticercosis may present as hydrocephalus and acute onset seizures, thus the immediate therapy is emergent reduction of intracranial pressure and anticonvulsant medications. Once the seizures have been brought under control, antihelminthic treatments may be undertaken. The decision to treat with antiparasitic therapy is complex and based on the stage and number of cysts present, their location, and the person&#x27;s specific symptoms.
Adult &quot;Taenia solium&quot; are easily treated with niclosamide, and is most commonly used in taeniasis. However, cysticercosis is a complex disease and requires careful medication. Praziquantel (PZQ) is most often the drug of choice for neurocysticercosis. Albendazole is also a viable (and potentially superior) drug for the disease, and it has a lower cost and fewer drug interactions than praziquantel. In more complex situations, a combination of praziquantel, albendazole and steroids (such as corticosteroids to reduce the inflammation) is recommended. In the brain, the cysts can be usually found on the surface. Most brain cysts are found by accident, often while searching for other ailments. Surgical removals are the only way to completely remove cysts, even if symptoms have been treated successfully with medications.

Antiparasitic treatment should be given in combination with corticosteroids and anticonvulsants to reduce inflammation surrounding the cysts and lower the risk of seizures. When corticosteroids are given in combination with praziquantel, cimetidine is also given, as corticosteroids decrease the action of praziquantel by enhancing its first pass metabolism.
Surgical intervention is much more likely to be needed in intraventricular, racemose, or spinal neurocysticercosis. Treatments include direct excision of ventricular cysts, shunting procedures, and removal of cysts via endoscopy.

===Eyes===
In eye disease, surgical removal is necessary for cysts within the eye itself as treating intraocular lesions with anthelmintics will elicit an inflammatory reaction causing irreversible damage to structural components. Cysts outside the globe can be treated with anthelmintics and steroids. Treatment recommendations for subcutaneous cysticercosis include surgery, praziquantel, and albendazole.

==Epidemiology==

=== Regions ===
&quot;Taenia solium&quot; is found worldwide, but is more common where pork is part of the diet. Cysticercosis is most prevalent where humans live in close contact with pigs. Therefore, high prevalences are reported in Mexico, Latin America, West Africa, Russia, India, Pakistan, North-East China, and Southeast Asia. In Europe it is most widespread among Slavic people. However, reviews of the epidemiological in Western and Eastern Europe shows there are still considerable gaps in our understanding of the disease also in these regions.

=== Infection estimates ===
In Latin America, an estimated 75 million persons live in endemic areas and 400,000 people have symptomatic disease. Some studies suggest that the prevalence of cysticercosis in Mexico is between 3.1 and 3.9 percent. Other studies have found the seroprevalence in areas of Guatemala, Bolivia, and Peru as high as 20 percent in humans, and 37 percent in pigs. In Ethiopia, Kenya, and the Democratic Republic of Congo around 10% of the population is infected, and in Madagascar 16%. The distribution of cysticercosis coincides with the distribution of &quot;T. solium&quot;. Cysticercosis is the most common cause of symptomatic epilepsy worldwide.

Prevalence rates in the United States have shown immigrants from Mexico, Central and South America, and Southeast Asia account for most of the domestic cases of cysticercosis.

In 1990 and 1991, four unrelated members of an Orthodox Jewish community in New York City developed recurrent seizures and brain lesions, which were found to have been caused by &quot;T. solium&quot;. Researchers who interviewed the families suspect the infection was acquired from domestic workers who were carriers of the tapeworm.

=== Deaths ===
Worldwide as of 2010, it caused about 1,200 deaths, up from 700 in 1990. Estimates from 2010 were that it contributed to at least 50,000 deaths annually.

In US during 1990–2002, 221 cysticercosis deaths were identified. Mortality rates were highest for Latinos and men. The mean age at death was 40.5 years (range 2–88). Most patients, 84.6%, were foreign-born, and 62% had emigrated from Mexico. The 33 US-born persons who died of cysticercosis represented 15% of all cysticercosis-related deaths. The cysticercosis mortality rate was highest in California, which accounted for 60% of all cysticercosis deaths.

==History==

The earliest reference to tapeworms was found in the works of ancient Egyptians that date back to almost 2000 BC. The description of measled pork in the &quot;History of Animals&quot; written by Aristotle (384–322 BC) showed that the infection of pork with tapeworm was known to ancient Greeks at that time. It was also known to Jewish and later to early Muslim physicians and has been proposed as one of the reasons for pork being forbidden by Jewish and Islamic dietary laws. Recent examination of evolutionary histories of hosts and parasites and DNA evidence show that over 10,000 years ago, ancestors of modern humans in Africa became exposed to tapeworm when they scavenged for food or preyed on antelopes and bovids, and later passed the infection on to domestic animals, such as pigs.

Cysticercosis was described by Johannes Udalric Rumler in 1555; however, the connection between tapeworms and cysticercosis had not been recognized at that time. Around 1850, Friedrich Küchenmeister fed pork containing cysticerci of &quot;T. solium&quot; to humans awaiting execution in a prison, and after they had been executed, he recovered the developing and adult tapeworms in their intestines. By the middle of the 19th century, it was established that cysticercosis was caused by the ingestion of the eggs of &quot;T. solium&quot;.

<doc id="760958" wikidata="Q664439" url="?curid=760958" title="Cystic duct">
<text>The cystic duct is the duct that (typically) joins the gallbladder and the common hepatic duct; the union of the cystic duct and common hepatic duct forms the bile duct (formerly known as the common bile duct). Its length varies. 

== Anatomy ==
The cystic duct typically measures (sources differ) 2–4 cm/2–3 cm in length (though its length has been known to range from 0.5 cm to 9 cm), and 2–3 mm in diameter. It is often tortuous.

It is the distal continuation of the neck of the gallbladder, from where it is directed inferoposteriorly and to the left/medially (this occurs in half of individuals). It typically terminates by uniting with the common hepatic duct to form the bile duct (usually anterior to the right hepatic artery). It usually joins the common bile duct from the right lateral side (forming an oblique angle between the two), and at such a distance that the bile duct is twice as long as the common hepatic duct. It often fuses with the common hepatic duct before actually opening into it after a variable distance (this arrangement may have the purpose of directing bile flow distally instead of back towards the liver).

=== Structure ===
The inner surface of the cystic duct features spiral, crescentic mucosal folds - the spiral folds of cystic duct.

The inner surface of the proximal cystic duct exhibits a network of submicroscopic convoluted folds (rugae), whereas that of the distal cystic duct exhibits submicroscopic parallel longitudinal folds.

=== Histology ===
The epithelial lining of the inner surface of the duct is similar to that of the gallbladder and consists mostly of columnar epithelial cells with short microvilli upon their apical surfaces.

The subepithelial layer consists of elastic connective tissue and is highly vascular; vessels that are adjacent to the epithelial basement membrane are fenestrated, possibly to facilitate ion and fluid exchange with the bile as is the case in the gallbladder itself.

The outer fibromuscular layer contains smooth muscle continuous with that of the gallbladder; some of the smooth muscle extends into the spiral valves.

=== Relations ===
It usually lies next to the cystic artery.

=== Variation ===
The cystic duct may rarely be doubled.

An accessory hepatic duct may join the cystic duct.

A pathological diverticulum known as the Hartmann’s pouch may be present at the junction of the neck of bladder and the cystic duct.

Length

The duct may sometimes be extremely short (making cholecystectomy risky) or may rarely be altogether absent (so that the gallbladder is directly attached to the bile duct).

Shape

While most often tortuous, it may occasionally be curved, straight, or S-shaped.

Termination

The cystic duct may unite with the common hepatic duct so that the common hepatic duct is either very short or very long (and the bile duct in turn very long or very short, respectively), or it may instead unite with the a hepatic duct.

Occasionally, the cystic duct may first run alongside the common hepatic duct for some distance within the hepatoduodenal ligament before joining it. It sometimes join the common hepatic duct at its anterior, posterior, or medial side (in the latter case by passing posteriorly around the common bile duct to join it from the other side). It may spiral around the common hepatic duct before joining it.

Very rarely, the cystic duct opens into the duodenum.

==Function==
Bile can flow in either direction between the gallbladder, and the common bile duct and hepatic duct. In this way, bile is stored in the gallbladder in between meal times. The hormone cholecystokinin, when stimulated by a fatty meal, promotes bile secretion by increased production of hepatic bile, contraction of the gall bladder, and relaxation of the Sphincter of Oddi.

The bile duct was once thought to possess a sphincteric function, however, it is now known that bile flow through the cystic duct proceeds unimpeded and is instead regulated by other mechanisms at other points of the biliary system.

==Clinical significance==
Gallstones can enter and obstruct the cystic duct, preventing the flow of bile. The increased pressure in the gallbladder leads to swelling and pain. This pain, known as biliary colic, is sometimes referred to as a gallbladder &quot;attack&quot; because of its sudden onset.

During a cholecystectomy, the cystic duct is clipped two or three times and a cut is made between the clips, freeing the gallbladder to be taken out.

<text>Christoph Ignaz Abele, von und zu Lilienberg (1628, in Vienna – 12 October 1685, in Vienna), son of a Swabian family, was an Austrian jurist.

==Biography==
First records of the Abele family first appear at the court of Maximilian I, Elector of Bavaria, where a member is listed in the court service. In 1547, the Abeles were awarded a nobility title and tenures in Lower Austria and Steiermark. The good reputation of the Abeles is linked primarily to Christoph Ignaz, who earned a name and a career in the higher civil service of Austria at the same time as Johann Hocher, Freiherr von Hohenkrän. 

Abele was awarded the title &quot;von und zu Lilienberg, Erbherr auf Hacking&quot; on 5 November 1655 by Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor. He became imperial secretary and was in charge of important transactions. In 1667-1670, he took a principal place in the fact-finding committee at the process against the Hungarian magnate conspiracy. In 1674 he was incorporated in the &quot;old&quot; nobility. 

Abele kept a large influence on the Privy Conferencial or Ministerial Council. The fall of Georg Ludwig Sinzendorf procured him the directorate of the Court Chamber (?Reichskammergericht) in 1679. At the same time, he was awarded the title of baron, two years later he acquired magnate?lordship, as well as the post of Privy Council and President of the Court Chamber. In 1683, Abele resigned the latter office but remained member of the Council. 

In 1684 he earned the title of count and acts as commissar at the Hungarian royal court, but dies soon thereafter.

==Publications==
Christoph Ignaz Abele also published some juridical historical tracts, namely:
*&quot;Kurze doch wahrhaffte in jure et facto wohlbegründete Gegen Deduction der österreichischen Jurium wider die von dem löblichen fürstlichen Stifft Bamberg auff gegenwärtigem Reichstag zu Regenspurg abgegebene Informations Schrifft: Specimen facti etc.&quot; (sic), 1668, 12 pages folio

<text>is one of the eleven wards in the city of Kyoto, in Kyoto Prefecture, Japan. Famous places in Fushimi include the Fushimi Inari Shrine, with thousands of torii lining the paths up and down a mountain; Fushimi Castle, originally built by Toyotomi Hideyoshi, with its rebuilt towers and gold-lined tea-room; and the Teradaya, an inn at which Sakamoto Ryōma was attacked and injured about a year before his assassination. Also of note is the Gokōgu shrine, which houses a stone used in the construction of Fushimi Castle. The water in the shrine is particularly famous and it is recorded as one of Japan&#x27;s 100 best clear water spots.

Although written with different characters now, the name Fushimi (which used to be its own &quot;town&quot;) originally comes from &quot;fusu&quot; + &quot;mizu&quot;, meaning &quot;hidden water&quot; or &quot;underground water&quot;. In other words, the location was known for good spring water. The water of Fushimi has particularly soft characteristics, making it an essential component to the particular type of sake brewed in Fushimi. This also explains why the area developed as a sake-brewing center in Kyoto. Today, Fushimi is the second greatest area of Japan in terms of sake production, and is where the sake company Gekkeikan was founded.

<text>Benjamin Pond (1768October 6, 1814) was a United States representative from New York.

==Early life==
He was born in Stockbridge in the Province of Massachusetts Bay in 1768. He attended the common schools, became a farmer, and moved to Poultney, Vermont, in 1800. He later moved to a portion of Crown Point which was included in the town of Schroon at Schroon&#x27;s founding, and was subsequently incorporated into the town of North Hudson, New York.

==Political career==
His political career began in 1804 when he became a justice of the peace and Schroon&#x27;s town supervisor. In 1808 he was appointed judge of the Essex County court of common pleas, and he served until his death. Pond served in the New York State Assembly from 1808 to 1810.

In 1810 Pond was elected as a Democratic-Republican to the Twelfth Congress (March 4, 1811 – March 3, 1813).

During the War of 1812 he served in the New York Militia as a matross in Captain Russell Walker&#x27;s company of the 6th Artillery Regiment. He participated in the defense of northern New York and took part in the September, 1814 Battle of Plattsburgh.

==Death==
In 1814 Pond was elected to the Fourteenth Congress, the term of which was scheduled to begin on March 4, 1815. He died in Schroon on October 6, 1814, of disease incurred through exposure at the Battle of Plattsburgh, and so never took his seat in the Fourteenth Congress.

Pond was buried in North Hudson&#x27;s Pine Ridge Cemetery. On September 3, 1923, he was re-interred in Elizabethtown, New York&#x27;s Riverside Cemetery.

<doc id="760994" wikidata="Q6501076" url="?curid=760994" title="Electron mobility">
<text>In solid-state physics, the electron mobility characterises how quickly an electron can move through a metal or semiconductor when pushed or pulled by an electric field. There is an analogous quantity for holes, called hole mobility. The term carrier mobility refers in general to both electron and hole mobility.

Electron and hole mobility are special cases of electrical mobility of charged particles in a fluid under an applied electric field.

When an electric field &quot;E&quot; is applied across a piece of material, the electrons respond by moving with an average velocity called the drift velocity, formula_1. Then the electron mobility &quot;μ&quot; is defined as
formula_2

Electron mobility is almost always specified in units of cm2/(V⋅s). This is different from the SI unit of mobility, m2/(V⋅s). They are related by 1 m2/(V⋅s) = 104 cm2/(V⋅s).

Conductivity is proportional to the product of mobility and carrier concentration. For example, the same conductivity could come from a small number of electrons with high mobility for each, or a large number of electrons with a small mobility for each. For semiconductors, the behavior of transistors and other devices can be very different depending on whether there are many electrons with low mobility or few electrons with high mobility. Therefore mobility is a very important parameter for semiconductor materials. Almost always, higher mobility leads to better device performance, with other things equal.

Semiconductor mobility depends on the impurity concentrations (including donor and acceptor concentrations), defect concentration, temperature, and electron and hole concentrations. It also depends on the electric field, particularly at high fields when velocity saturation occurs. It can be determined by the Hall effect, or inferred from transistor behavior.

==Introduction==
===Drift velocity in an electric field===

Without any applied electric field, in a solid, electrons and holes move around randomly. Therefore, on average there will be no overall motion of charge carriers in any particular direction over time.

However, when an electric field is applied, each electron or hole is accelerated by the electric field. If the electron were in a vacuum, it would be accelerated to ever-increasing velocity (called ballistic transport). However, in a solid, the electron repeatedly scatters off crystal defects, phonons, impurities, etc., so that it loses some energy and changes direction. The final result is that the electron moves with a finite average velocity, called the drift velocity. This net electron motion is usually much slower than the normally occurring random motion.

The two charge carriers, electrons and holes, will typically have different drift velocities for the same electric field.

Quasi-ballistic transport is possible in solids if the electrons are accelerated across a very small distance (as small as the mean free path), or for a very short time (as short as the mean free time). In these cases, drift velocity and mobility are not meaningful.

===Definition and units===

The electron mobility is defined by the equation:
formula_3
where:
*&quot;E&quot; is the magnitude of the electric field applied to a material,
*&quot;vd&quot; is the magnitude of the electron drift velocity (in other words, the electron drift speed) caused by the electric field, and
*&quot;μ&quot;e is the electron mobility.
The hole mobility is defined by a similar equation: 
formula_4
Both electron and hole mobilities are positive by definition.

Usually, the electron drift velocity in a material is directly proportional to the electric field, which means that the electron mobility is a constant (independent of the electric field). When this is not true (for example, in very large electric fields), mobility depends on the electric field.

The SI unit of velocity is m/s, and the SI unit of electric field is V/m. Therefore the SI unit of mobility is (m/s)/(V/m) = m2/(V⋅s). However, mobility is much more commonly expressed in cm2/(V⋅s) = 10−4 m2/(V⋅s).

Mobility is usually a strong function of material impurities and temperature, and is determined empirically. Mobility values are typically presented in table or chart form. Mobility is also different for electrons and holes in a given material.

===Derivation===
Starting with Newton&#x27;s second law:
formula_5
where:
*&quot;a&quot; is the acceleration between collisions.
*&quot;F&quot; is the electric force exerted by the electric field, and
*formula_6 is the effective mass of an electron.

Since the force on the electron is −&quot;eE&quot;:
formula_7

This is the acceleration on the electron between collisions. The drift velocity is therefore:
formula_8 where formula_9 is the mean free time

Since we only care about how the drift velocity changes with the electric field, we lump the loose terms together to get 
formula_10 where formula_11

Similarly, for holes we have 
formula_12 where formula_13
Note that both electron mobility and hole mobility are positive. A minus sign is added for electron drift velocity to account for the minus charge.

===Relation to current density===
The drift current density resulting from an electric field can be calculated from the drift velocity. Consider a sample with cross-sectional area A, length l and an electron concentration of n. The current carried by each electron must be formula_14, so that the total current density due to electrons is given by:
formula_15
Using the expression for formula_16 gives
formula_17
A similar set of equations applies to the holes, (noting that the charge on a hole is positive). Therefore the current density due to holes is given by
formula_18
where p is the hole concentration and formula_19 the hole mobility.

The total current density is the sum of the electron and hole components:
formula_20

===Relation to conductivity===
We have previously derived the relationship between electron mobility and current density 
formula_20
Now Ohm&#x27;s law can be written in the form
formula_22
where formula_23 is defined as the conductivity. Therefore we can write down:
formula_24
which can be factorised to
formula_25

===Relation to electron diffusion===
In a region where n and p vary with distance, a diffusion current is superimposed on that due to conductivity. This diffusion current is governed by Fick&#x27;s law:
formula_26
where:
*&quot;F&quot; is flux.
*&quot;D&quot;e is the diffusion coefficient or diffusivity
*formula_27 is the concentration gradient of electrons

The diffusion coefficient for a charge carrier is related to its mobility by the Einstein relation. For a classical system (e.g. Boltzmann gas), it reads:
formula_28
where:
*&quot;k&quot;B is the Boltzmann constant
*&quot;T&quot; is the absolute temperature
*&quot;e&quot; is the electric charge of an electron

For a metal, described by a Fermi gas (Fermi liquid), quantum version of the Einstein relation should be used. Typically, temperature is much smaller than the Fermi energy, in this case one should use the following formula:
formula_29
where:
*&quot;E&quot;F is the Fermi energy

==Examples==
Typical electron mobility at room temperature (300 K) in metals like gold, copper and silver is 30–50 cm2/(V⋅s). Carrier mobility in semiconductors is doping dependent. In silicon (Si) the electron mobility is of the order of 1,000, in germanium around 4,000, and in gallium arsenide up to 10,000 cm2/(V⋅s). Hole mobilities are generally lower and range from around 100 cm2/(V⋅s) in gallium arsenide, to 450 in silicon, and 2,000 in germanium.

Very high mobility has been found in several ultrapure low-dimensional systems, such as two-dimensional electron gases (2DEG) (35,000,000 cm2/(V⋅s) at low temperature), carbon nanotubes (100,000 cm2/(V⋅s) at room temperature) and freestanding graphene (200,000 cm2/(V⋅s) at low temperature). Organic semiconductors (polymer, oligomer) developed thus far have carrier mobilities below 50 cm2/(V⋅s), and typically below 1, with well performing materials measured below 10.
==Electric field dependence and velocity saturation==
At low fields, the drift velocity &quot;v&quot;&quot;d&quot; is proportional to the electric field &quot;E&quot;, so mobility &quot;μ&quot; is constant. This value of &quot;μ&quot; is called the &quot;low-field mobility&quot;.

As the electric field is increased, however, the carrier velocity increases sublinearly and asymptotically towards a maximum possible value, called the &quot;saturation velocity&quot; &quot;v&quot;sat. For example, the value of &quot;v&quot;sat is on the order of 1×107 cm/s for both electrons and holes in Si. It is on the order of 6×106 cm/s for Ge. This velocity is a characteristic of the material and a strong function of doping or impurity levels and temperature. It is one of the key material and semiconductor device properties that determine a device such as a transistor&#x27;s ultimate limit of speed of response and frequency.

This velocity saturation phenomenon results from a process called &quot;optical phonon scattering&quot;. At high fields, carriers are accelerated enough to gain sufficient kinetic energy between collisions to emit an optical phonon, and they do so very quickly, before being accelerated once again. The velocity that the electron reaches before emitting a phonon is:
formula_30
where &quot;ω&quot;phonon(opt.) is the optical-phonon angular frequency and m* the carrier effective mass in the direction of the electric field. The value of &quot;E&quot;phonon (opt.) is 0.063 eV for Si and 0.034 eV for GaAs and Ge. The saturation velocity is only one-half of &quot;v&quot;emit, because the electron starts at zero velocity and accelerates up to &quot;v&quot;emit in each cycle. (This is a somewhat oversimplified description.)

Velocity saturation is not the only possible high-field behavior. Another is the Gunn effect, where a sufficiently high electric field can cause intervalley electron transfer, which reduces drift velocity. This is unusual; increasing the electric field almost always &quot;increases&quot; the drift velocity, or else leaves it unchanged. The result is negative differential resistance.

In the regime of velocity saturation (or other high-field effects), mobility is a strong function of electric field. This means that mobility is a somewhat less useful concept, compared to simply discussing drift velocity directly.

==Relation between scattering and mobility==
Recall that by definition, mobility is dependent on the drift velocity. The main factor determining drift velocity (other than effective mass) is scattering time, i.e. how long the carrier is ballistically accelerated by the electric field until it scatters (collides) with something that changes its direction and/or energy. The most important sources of scattering in typical semiconductor materials, discussed below, are ionized impurity scattering and acoustic phonon scattering (also called lattice scattering). In some cases other sources of scattering may be important, such as neutral impurity scattering, optical phonon scattering, surface scattering, and defect scattering.

Elastic scattering means that energy is (almost) conserved during the scattering event. Some elastic scattering processes are scattering from acoustic phonons, impurity scattering, piezoelectric scattering, etc. In acoustic phonon scattering, electrons scatter from state k to k&#x27;, while emitting or absorbing a phonon of wave vector q. This phenomenon is usually modeled by assuming that lattice vibrations cause small shifts in energy bands. The additional potential causing the scattering process is generated by the deviations of bands due to these small transitions from frozen lattice positions.

===Ionized impurity scattering===
Semiconductors are doped with donors and/or acceptors, which are typically ionized, and are thus charged. The Coulombic forces will deflect an electron or hole approaching the ionized impurity. This is known as &quot;ionized impurity scattering&quot;. The amount of deflection depends on the speed of the carrier and its proximity to the ion. The more heavily a material is doped, the higher the probability that a carrier will collide with an ion in a given time, and the smaller the mean free time between collisions, and the smaller the mobility. When determining the strength of these interactions due to the long-range nature of the Coulomb potential, other impurities and free carriers cause the range of interaction with the carriers to reduce significantly compared to bare Coulomb interaction.

If these scatterers are near the interface, the complexity of the problem increases due to the existence of crystal defects and disorders. Charge trapping centers that scatter free carriers form in many cases due to defects associated with dangling bonds. Scattering happens because after trapping a charge, the defect becomes charged and therefore starts interacting with free carriers. If scattered carriers are in the inversion layer at the interface, the reduced dimensionality of the carriers makes the case differ from the case of bulk impurity scattering as carriers move only in two dimensions. Interfacial roughness also causes short-range scattering limiting the mobility of quasi-two-dimensional electrons at the interface.

===Lattice (phonon) scattering===
At any temperature above absolute zero, the vibrating atoms create pressure (acoustic) waves in the crystal, which are termed phonons. Like electrons, phonons can be considered to be particles. A phonon can interact (collide) with an electron (or hole) and scatter it. At higher temperature, there are more phonons, and thus increased electron scattering, which tends to reduce mobility.

===Piezoelectric scattering===
Piezoelectric effect can occur only in compound semiconductor due to their polar nature. It is small in most semiconductors but may lead to local electric fields that cause scattering of carriers by deflecting them, this effect is important mainly at low temperatures where other scattering mechanisms are weak. These electric fields arise from the distortion of the basic unit cell as strain is applied in certain directions in the lattice.

===Surface roughness scattering===
Surface roughness scattering caused by interfacial disorder is short range scattering limiting the mobility of quasi-two-dimensional electrons at the interface. From high-resolution transmission electron micrographs, it has been determined that the interface is not abrupt on the atomic level, but actual position of the interfacial plane varies one or two atomic layers along the surface. These variations are random and cause fluctuations of the energy levels at the interface, which then causes scattering.

===Alloy scattering===
In compound (alloy) semiconductors, which many thermoelectric materials are, scattering caused by the perturbation of crystal potential due to the random positioning of substituting atom species in a relevant sublattice is known as alloy scattering. This can only happen in ternary or higher alloys as their crystal structure forms by randomly replacing some atoms in one of the sublattices (sublattice) of the crystal structure. Generally, this phenomenon is quite weak but in certain materials or circumstances, it can become dominant effect limiting conductivity. In bulk materials, interface scattering is usually ignored.

===Inelastic scattering===
During inelastic scattering processes, significant energy exchange happens. As with elastic phonon scattering also in the inelastic case, the potential arises from energy band deformations caused by atomic vibrations. Optical phonons causing inelastic scattering usually have the energy in the range 30-50 meV, for comparison energies of acoustic phonon are typically less than 1 meV but some might have energy in order of 10 meV. There is significant change in carrier energy during the scattering process. Optical or high-energy acoustic phonons can also cause intervalley or interband scattering, which means that scattering is not limited within single valley.

===Electron–electron scattering===
Due to the Pauli exclusion principle, electrons can be considered as non-interacting if their density does not exceed the value 1016~1017 cm−3 or electric field value 103 V/cm. However, significantly above these limits electron–electron scattering starts to dominate. Long range and nonlinearity of the Coulomb potential governing interactions between electrons make these interactions difficult to deal with.

===Relation between mobility and scattering time===
A simple model gives the approximate relation between scattering time (average time between scattering events) and mobility. It is assumed that after each scattering event, the carrier&#x27;s motion is randomized, so it has zero average velocity. After that, it accelerates uniformly in the electric field, until it scatters again. The resulting average drift mobility is:
formula_31
where &quot;q&quot; is the elementary charge, &quot;m&quot;* is the carrier effective mass, and is the average scattering time.

If the effective mass is anisotropic (direction-dependent), &quot;m&quot;* is the effective mass in the direction of the electric field.

===Matthiessen&#x27;s rule===
Normally, more than one source of scattering is present, for example both impurities and lattice phonons. It is normally a very good approximation to combine their influences using &quot;Matthiessen&#x27;s Rule&quot; (developed from work by Augustus Matthiessen in 1864):

formula_32
where &quot;μ&quot; is the actual mobility, formula_33 is the mobility that the material would have if there was impurity scattering but no other source of scattering, and formula_34 is the mobility that the material would have if there was lattice phonon scattering but no other source of scattering. Other terms may be added for other scattering sources, for example
formula_35
Matthiessen&#x27;s rule can also be stated in terms of the scattering time:
formula_36
where &quot;τ&quot; is the true average scattering time and τimpurities is the scattering time if there was impurity scattering but no other source of scattering, etc.

Matthiessen&#x27;s rule is an approximation and is not universally valid. This rule is not valid if the factors affecting the mobility depend on each other, because individual scattering probabilities cannot be summed unless they are independent of each other. The average free time of flight of a carrier and therefore the relaxation time is inversely proportional to the scattering probability. For example, lattice scattering alters the average electron velocity (in the electric-field direction), which in turn alters the tendency to scatter off impurities. There are more complicated formulas that attempt to take these effects into account.

===Temperature dependence of mobility===

With increasing temperature, phonon concentration increases and causes increased scattering. Thus lattice scattering lowers the carrier mobility more and more at higher temperature. Theoretical calculations reveal that the mobility in non-polar semiconductors, such as silicon and germanium, is dominated by acoustic phonon interaction. The resulting mobility is expected to be proportional to &quot;T&quot; −3/2, while the mobility due to optical phonon scattering only is expected to be proportional to &quot;T&quot; −1/2. Experimentally, values of the temperature dependence of the mobility in Si, Ge and GaAs are listed in table.

As formula_37, where formula_38 is the scattering cross section for electrons and holes at a scattering center and formula_39 is a thermal average (Boltzmann statistics) over all electron or hole velocities in the lower conduction band or upper valence band, temperature dependence of the mobility can be determined. In here, the following definition for the scattering cross section is used: number of particles scattered into solid angle dΩ per unit time divided by number of particles per area per time (incident intensity), which comes from classical mechanics. As Boltzmann statistics are valid for semiconductors formula_40.

For scattering from acoustic phonons, for temperatures well above Debye temperature, the estimated cross section Σph is determined from the square of the average vibrational amplitude of a phonon to be proportional to &quot;T&quot;. The scattering from charged defects (ionized donors or acceptors) leads to the cross section formula_41. This formula is the scattering cross section for &quot;Rutherford scattering&quot;, where a point charge (carrier) moves past another point charge (defect) experiencing Coulomb interaction.

The temperature dependencies of these two scattering mechanism in semiconductors can be determined by combining formulas for τ, Σ and formula_39, to be for scattering from acoustic phonons formula_43 and from charged defects formula_44.

The effect of ionized impurity scattering, however, &quot;decreases&quot; with increasing temperature because the average thermal speeds of the carriers are increased. Thus, the carriers spend less time near an ionized impurity as they pass and the scattering effect of the ions is thus reduced.

These two effects operate simultaneously on the carriers through Matthiessen&#x27;s rule. At lower temperatures, ionized impurity scattering dominates, while at higher temperatures, phonon scattering dominates, and the actual mobility reaches a maximum at an intermediate temperature.

== Disordered Semiconductors ==

While in crystalline materials electrons can be described by wavefunctions extended over the entire solid, this is not the case in systems with appreciable structural disorder, such as polycrystalline or amorphous semiconductors. Anderson suggested that beyond a critical value of structural disorder, electron states would be &quot;localized&quot;. Localized states are described as being confined to finite region of real space, normalizable, and not contributing to transport. Extended states are spread over the extent of the material, not normalizable, and contribute to transport. Unlike crystalline semiconductors, mobility generally increases with temperature in disordered semiconductors.

=== Multiple trapping and release ===
Mott later developed the concept of a mobility edge. This is an energy formula_45, above which electrons undergo a transition from localized to delocalized states. In this description, termed &quot;multiple trapping and release&quot;, electrons are only able to travel when in extended states, and are constantly being trapped in, and re-released from, the lower energy localized states. Because the probability of an electron being released from a trap depends on its thermal energy, mobility can be described by an Arrhenius relationship in such a system:

formula_46

where formula_47 is a mobility prefactor, formula_48 is activation energy, formula_49 is the Boltzmann constant, and formula_50 is temperature. The activation energy is typically evaluated by measuring mobility as a function of temperature. The Urbach Energy can be used as a proxy for activation energy in some systems.

=== Variable Range Hopping ===
At low temperature, or in system with a large degree of structural disorder (such as fully amorphous systems), electrons cannot access delocalized states. In such a system, electrons can only travel by tunnelling for one site to another, in a process called &quot;variable range hopping&quot;. In the original theory of variable range hopping, as developed by Mott and Davis, the probability formula_51, of an electron hopping from one site formula_52, to another site formula_53, depends on their separation in space formula_54, and their separation in energy formula_55.

formula_56

Here formula_57 is a prefactor associated with the phonon frequency in the material, and formula_58 is the wavefunction overlap parameter. The mobility in a system governed by variable range hopping can be shown to be:

formula_59

where formula_47 is a mobility prefactor, formula_61 is a parameter (with dimensions of temperature) that quantifies the width of localized states, and formula_62 is the dimensionality of the system.

==Measurement of semiconductor mobility==

===Hall mobility===

Carrier mobility is most commonly measured using the Hall effect. The result of the measurement is called the &quot;Hall mobility&quot; (meaning &quot;mobility inferred from a Hall-effect measurement&quot;).

Consider a semiconductor sample with a rectangular cross section as shown in the figures, a current is flowing in the &quot;x&quot;-direction and a magnetic field is applied in the &quot;z&quot;-direction. The resulting Lorentz force will accelerate the electrons (&quot;n&quot;-type materials) or holes (&quot;p&quot;-type materials) in the (−&quot;y&quot;) direction, according to the right hand rule and set up an electric field &quot;ξy&quot;. As a result there is a voltage across the sample, which can be measured with a high-impedance voltmeter. This voltage, &quot;VH&quot;, is called the Hall voltage. &quot;VH&quot; is negative for &quot;n&quot;-type material and positive for &quot;p&quot;-type material.

Mathematically, the Lorentz force acting on a charge &quot;q&quot; is given by

For electrons:
formula_63

For holes:
formula_64

In steady state this force is balanced by the force set up by the Hall voltage, so that there is no net force on the carriers in the &quot;y&quot; direction. For electrons,

formula_65

formula_66

formula_67

For electrons, the field points in the −&quot;y&quot; direction, and for holes, it points in the +&quot;y&quot; direction.

The electron current &quot;I&quot; is given by formula_68. Sub &quot;v&quot;&quot;x&quot; into the expression for &quot;ξ&quot;&quot;y&quot;,

formula_69

where &quot;RHn&quot; is the Hall coefficient for electron, and is defined as
formula_70

Since formula_71
formula_72

Similarly, for holes
formula_73

From the Hall coefficient, we can obtain the carrier mobility as follows:
formula_74

Similarly,
formula_75

Here the value of &quot;VHp&quot; (Hall voltage), &quot;t&quot; (sample thickness), &quot;I&quot; (current) and &quot;B&quot; (magnetic field) can be measured directly, and the conductivities &quot;σ&quot;n or &quot;σ&quot;p are either known or can be obtained from measuring the resistivity.

===Field-effect mobility===
The mobility can also be measured using a field-effect transistor (FET). The result of the measurement is called the &quot;field-effect mobility&quot; (meaning &quot;mobility inferred from a field-effect measurement&quot;).

The measurement can work in two ways: From saturation-mode measurements, or linear-region measurements. (See MOSFET for a description of the different modes or regions of operation.)

====Using saturation mode====
In this technique, for each fixed gate voltage VGS, the drain-source voltage VDS is increased until the current ID saturates. Next, the square root of this saturated current is plotted against the gate voltage, and the slope &quot;m&quot;sat is measured. Then the mobility is:
formula_76
where &quot;L&quot; and &quot;W&quot; are the length and width of the channel and &quot;C&quot;&quot;i&quot; is the gate insulator capacitance per unit area. This equation comes from the approximate equation for a MOSFET in saturation mode:
formula_77
where &quot;V&quot;th is the threshold voltage. This approximation ignores the Early effect (channel length modulation), among other things. In practice, this technique may underestimate the true mobility.

====Using the linear region====
In this technique, the transistor is operated in the linear region (or &quot;ohmic mode&quot;), where VDS is small and formula_78 with slope &quot;m&quot;lin. Then the mobility is:
formula_79
This equation comes from the approximate equation for a MOSFET in the linear region:
formula_80
In practice, this technique may overestimate the true mobility, because if VDS is not small enough and VG is not large enough, the MOSFET may not stay in the linear region.

===Optical mobility===
Electron mobility may be determined from non-contact laser photo-reflectance technique measurements. A series of photo-reflectance measurements are made as the sample is stepped through focus. The electron diffusion length and recombination time are determined by a regressive fit to the data. Then the Einstein relation is used to calculate the mobility.

===Terahertz mobility===
Electron mobility can be calculated from time-resolved terahertz probe measurement. Femtosecond laser pulses excite the semiconductor and the resulting photoconductivity is measured using a terahertz probe, which detects changes in the terahertz electric field.

=== Time resolved microwave conductivity (TRMC) ===
A proxy for charge carrier mobility can be evaluated using time-resolved microwave conductivity (TRMC). A pulsed optical laser is used to create electrons and holes in a semiconductor, which are then detected as an increase in photoconductance. With knowledge of the sample absorbance, dimensions, and incident laser fluence, the parameter formula_81 can be evaluated, where formula_82 is the carrier generation yield (between 0 and 1), formula_83 is the electron mobility and formula_84 is the hole mobility. formula_85 has the same dimensions as mobility, but carrier type (electron or hole) is obscured.

==Doping concentration dependence in heavily-doped silicon==
The charge carriers in semiconductors are electrons and holes. Their numbers are controlled by the concentrations of impurity elements, i.e. doping concentration. Thus doping concentration has great influence on carrier mobility.

While there is considerable scatter in the experimental data, for noncompensated material (no counter doping) for heavily doped substrates (i.e. formula_86 and up), the mobility in silicon is often characterized by the empirical relationship: 
formula_87
where &quot;N&quot; is the doping concentration (either &quot;ND&quot; or &quot;NA&quot;), and &quot;N&quot;ref and α are fitting parameters. At room temperature, the above equation becomes:

Majority carriers: 
formula_88
formula_89

Minority carriers: 
formula_90
formula_91

These equations apply only to silicon, and only under low field.

<doc id="761005" wikidata="Q142013" url="?curid=761005" title="166 Rhodope">
<text>166 Rhodope is a dark background asteroid from the central region of the asteroid belt, approximately 55 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered on 15 August 1876, by German–American astronomer Christian Peters at the Litchfield Observatory in Clinton, New York, United States. The asteroid was named after Queen Rhodope from Greek mythology.

== Orbit and classification ==

&quot;Rhodope&quot; is a non-family asteroid of the main belt&#x27;s background population, when applying the Hierarchical Clustering Method to its proper orbital elements. Alternatively, it has been dynamically assigned to the stony Eunomia family (), which have a different spectral class and albedo than that of &quot;Rhodope&quot; though. The asteroid has also been considered a member of the Adeona family.

&quot;Rhodope&quot; orbits the Sun in the central asteroid belt at a distance of 2.1–3.3 AU once every 4 years and 5 months (1,607 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.21 and an inclination of 12° with respect to the ecliptic. The body&#x27;s observation arc begins with the first recorded observation by the MPC at Vienna Observatory on 10 September 1885, or more than 9 years after its official discovery observation at Clinton.

On 19 October 2005, it was observed occulting the prominent star Regulus from Vibo Valentia, Italy.

== Physical characteristics ==

=== Spectral type ===

&quot;Rhodope&quot;″s spectral type is ambiguous. In the Tholen classification, the noisy spectrum is closest to a G-type and somewhat similar to a common C-type (GC:). In the SMASS classification, it is an Xe-subtype, that transitions from the X-type to the very bright E-type. In addition, &quot;Rhodope&quot; has also been characterized as a primitive P-type and carbonaceous C-type by the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) and by Pan-STARRS photometric survey, respectively.

=== Rotation period ===

Two well-defined rotational lightcurves of &quot;Rhodope&quot; were obtained from photometric observations by French astronomer Matthieu Conjat and by an anonymous observer of the &quot;Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link&quot; (CALL). Lightcurve analysis gave a consolidated rotation period of 4.715 hours with a brightness variation of 0.35 to 0.36 magnitude (). The result supersedes a period of 7.87 hours measured by Alan Harris in the early 1980s ().

=== Poles ===

In 2013, the asteroid&#x27;s lightcurve was also modeled from combined dense and sparse photometry. It gave a concurring sidereal period of 4.714793 hours. The modelling also determined two spin axis of (345.0°, −22.0°) and (173.0°, −3.0°) in ecliptic coordinates (λ, β).

=== Diameter and albedo ===

According to the surveys carried out by the Japanese Akari satellite and the NEOWISE mission of NASA&#x27;s WISE telescope, &quot;Rhodope&quot; measures between 39.04 and 65.29 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.046 and 0.10.

CALL adopts Petr Pravec&#x27;s revised WISE-data, that is, an albedo of 0.0747 and a diameter of 54.56 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 9.75.

== Naming ==

This minor planet was named from Greek mythology after Queen Rhodope of Thrace, wife of King Haemus and attendant of Artemis, &quot;also see &quot;. In vanity, Rhodope and Haemus compared themselves to the gods Zeus and Hera, &quot;see and &quot;, who punished the couple by changing them into the Rhodope Mountains and Balkan Mountains, respectively.

<text>167 Urda is a main-belt asteroid that was discovered by German-American astronomer Christian Heinrich Friedrich Peters on August 28, 1876, in Clinton, New York, and named after Urd, one of the Norns in Norse mythology. In 1905, Austrian astronomer Johann Palisa showed that the asteroid varied in brightness.

Photometric observations of this asteroid at the Palmer Divide Observatory in Colorado Springs, Colorado, during 2007–8 gave a light curve with a period of 13.06133 ± 0.00002 hours. This S-type asteroid is a member of the Koronis family of asteroids that share similar orbital elements.

In 2002, a diameter estimate of 37.93 ± 3.17 km was obtained from the Midcourse Space Experiment observations, with an albedo of 0.2523 ± 0.0448.

A stellar occultation by Urda was observed from Japan on July 23, 2001.

<text>168 Sibylla is a large main-belt asteroid, discovered by Canadian-American astronomer J. C. Watson on September 28, 1876. It was most likely named for the Sibyls, referring to the Ancient Greek female oracles. Based upon its spectrum this object is classified as a C-type asteroid, which indicates it is very dark and composed of primitive carbonaceous materials. 168 Sibylla is a Cybele asteroid, orbiting beyond most of the main-belt asteroids.

Photometric observations of this asteroid made at the Torino Observatory in Italy during 1990–1991 were used to determine a synodic rotation period of 23.82 ± 0.004 hours. The shape of this slowly rotating object appears to resemble an oblate spheroid.

<text>The Lachman test is a clinical test used to diagnose injury of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). It is recognized as reliable, sensitive, and usually superior to the anterior drawer test.

==Description==
The knee is flexed at 15 degrees with the patient supine. The examiner should place one hand behind the tibia and the other grasping the patient&#x27;s thigh. It is important that the examiner&#x27;s thumb be on the tibial tuberosity. The tibia is pulled forward to assess the amount of anterior motion of the tibia in comparison to the femur. An intact ACL should prevent forward translational movement (&quot;firm endpoint&quot;) while an ACL-deficient knee will demonstrate increased forward translation without a decisive endpoint - a soft or mushy endpoint indicative of a positive test. More than about 2 mm of anterior translation compared to the uninvolved knee suggests a torn ACL (&quot;soft endpoint&quot;), as does 10 mm of total anterior translation. An instrument called a &quot;KT-1000&quot; can be used to determine the magnitude of movement in millimetres. This test can be done in either an on-field evaluation in acute injury, or in a clinical setting when a patient presents for follow-up with knee pain.

==Interpretation==
The test may be negative in chronic ruptures as the ACL stump can scar to the PCL.

==History and etymology==
The test is named after orthopaedic surgeon John Lachman, late Chairman of the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery and Sports Medicine at Temple University School of Medicine in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The original description was submitted by one of his colleagues, JS Torg.

<text>169 Zelia is a main belt asteroid that was discovered by the brothers Paul Henry and Prosper Henry on September 28, 1876. Credit for this discovery was given to Prosper. Initial orbital elements for this asteroid were published in 1877 by American astronomer H. A. Howe.

Based upon its spectrum, this body is classified as a rare O-type asteroid in the taxonomic system of Bus &amp; Binzel. Photometric observations of this asteroid during 2009 gave a light curve with a period of 14.537 ± 0.001 hours and a brightness variation of 0.14 ± 0.03 in magnitude.

It was named for Zelia Martin, a niece of the astronomer Camille Flammarion.

<text>Judeo-Italian (or Judaeo-Italian, Judæo-Italian, and other names including Italkian) is a groups of endangered and extinct Jewish dialects, with only about 200 speakers in Italy and 250 total speakers today. The dialects are one of the Italian languages and are a subgrouping of the Judeo-Romance Languages. Some words have Italian prefixes and suffixes added to Hebrew words as well as Aramaic roots. All of the dialects except Judeo-Roman are now extinct.

==The term &quot;Judeo-Italian&quot;==
The glottonym is of academic and relatively late coinage. In English, the term was first used (as &quot;Judæo-Italian&quot;) by Lazaro Belleli in 1904 in the &quot;Jewish Encyclopedia&quot;, describing the languages of the Jews of Corfu. In Italian, Giuseppe Cammeo referred to a (&#x27;Judaico-Italian jargon&#x27;) in a 1909 article. That same year, Umberto Cassuto used the term , in the following (here translated into English):
=== Other designations ===

* Historically, Italian Jews referred to their vernaculars as (), Hebrew for &#x27;foreign language&#x27;, &#x27;non-Hebrew language&#x27;. And linguists use as a description of words of Romance origin in Yiddish. This may be connected with the Germanic use of the word (literally, &#x27;foreign&#x27;) and derived cognates, for Romance peoples and languages and sometimes Celtic peoples and languages (as in English terms &quot;Walloons&quot;, &quot;Wallachians&quot;, and &quot;Welsh&quot;): the Italian and Sephardic Hebrew script for Torah scrolls is known in Yiddish as or .
*In 1587, David de Pomis used the word in reference to the Italian glosses in his trilingual dictionary. The Hebrew title of the 1609 Venice Haggadah uses the word or () for the language of Leone Modena&#x27;s translation (, ).
* Other historic descriptions are and , both of which were commonly used in the Middle Ages to mean early Italian dialects in general, i.e. Vulgar Latin varieties.
* After the institution of the Ghetto forced Jewish communities throughout Italy into segregation, the term was identified with local Jewish varieties of regional dialects.
* Another native name type is (e.g., Judeo-Florentine ; &lt; Latin *, or an assimilation of the hiatus * &lt; *).
* The English neologism &quot;Italkian&quot; was coined in 1942 by Solomon Birnbaum, based on the modern Hebrew adjective , &#x27;Italian&#x27;, from the Middle Hebrew adjective meaning &#x27;Italic&#x27; or &#x27;Roman&#x27;.

=== ISO and Library of Congress classifications ===
The International Organization for Standardization language code for Judeo-Italian / Italkian in the ISO 639-3 specification is ; the ISO 639-2 collective language code (for Romance languages) can also apply more generally.

&quot;Italkian&quot; is not used by the US Library of Congress as a subject heading, nor does it figure as a reference to Judeo-Italian. The authorized subject heading is &quot;Judeo-Italian language&quot;. Subheadings are:

== History ==

=== Early History ===
The first Jewish communities in Italy emerged during the 2nd century BC and were Greek speaking with knowledge of Hebrew and Aramaic. But by 1000 AD the Jewish community in Italy had abandoned Greek and adopted early forms of Italian. By the 900&#x27;s AD Hebrew loanwords had begun to find their way into the speech of Italian Jews and Italian writing begins appearing in Hebrew, though the amount of Hebrew influence varies widely.

=== Later History ===
During the 16th expulsions led to a massive decline in the amount of Judeo-Italian literature. During the 19th century Judeo-Italian had switched from using Hebrew letters to the latin alphabet. The language began to decline in the early 19th century as Italian Jews were emancipated and began to switch to standard Italian instead of Judeo-Italian. At the same time it began to be written down to preserve the language as it declines. By 1900 30,000 people spoke the language today it is down to 250. Around 2015 Judeo-Piedmontese went extinct. All of the dialects of Judeo-Italian except for Judeo-Roman are now extinct.

==Influence on other Jewish languages==
According to some scholars, there are some Judeo-Italian loan words that have found their way into Yiddish. For example, the word in Judeo-Italian for &#x27;synagogue&#x27; is , closely related to , &#x27;school&#x27;. The use of words for &#x27;school&#x27; to mean &#x27;synagogue&#x27; dates back to the Roman Empire. The Judeo-Italian distinction between and parallels the Standard Yiddish distinction between for &#x27;synagogue&#x27; and for &#x27;school&#x27;. Another example is Yiddish , from the Judeo-Italian (&#x27;gentile&#x27;, &#x27;non-Jew&#x27;, &#x27;Christian&#x27;), as differentiated from the standard Italian , meaning &#x27;noble&#x27;, &#x27;gentleman&#x27; (even if the name can come from Judeo-French and French as well).

There are also several loanwords from Judeo-Italian dialects in Judeo-Gascon, due to the migration of a few Italian families to the Sephardi communities in Gascony during the 18th and 19th centuries.

==Dialects==
Judeo-Italian regional dialects (, ), these:

=== Unspecified ===
*Judeo-Ferrarese† () in Ferrara
*Judeo-Modenese† () in Modena
*Judeo-Pitigliano/ Judeo-Pitgilianese† &quot;(Giudeo-Pitigliano/ Giudeo-Pitgiliananese)&quot; in Tuscany
*Judeo-Salentinian† (&quot;Giudeo-Salentino&quot;) In Salentino
*Judeo-Resan† () in the region of Reggio Emilia of Emilia-Romagna
*Judeo-Torinese† (&quot;Giudeo-Torinese&quot;) in Turin
*Judeo-Italian of Lugo Di Romanga† (&quot;Giudeo-italiano di Lugo Di Romanga&quot;) in Lugo Di Romanga
*Judeo-Italian of Moncalvo† &quot;(Giudeo-italiano di Moncalvo)&quot; in Moncalvo
*Judeo-Italian of Casale Monferrato† &quot;(Giudeo-italiano di Casale Monferrato)&quot; in Casale Monferrato
*Judeo-Italian of Finale Emilia† &quot;(Giudeo-italiano di Finale Emilia)&quot; in Finale Emilia

* Judeo-Roman () in Rome

=== Tuscan Judeo-Italian ===

* Bagitto/Judeo-Livornese† &quot;(Bagitto/&quot;) in Livorno
* Judeo-Florentine† () in Florence

=== Northern Judeo-Italian ===
Source:

==== Venetian ====

* Judeo-Venetian† () in Venice
* Judeo-Triestine† (&quot;Giudeo-Triestino&quot;) in Trieste
* Judeo-Veronese† (&quot;Giudeo-Veronese&quot;) in Verona

==== Gallo-Italic ====
Source:

*Judeo-Reggiano† (&quot;Giudeo-Reggiano&quot;) in Reggio Emilia
*Judeo-Piedmontese† () in the region of Piedmont
*Judeo-Mantuan† () in Mantua

At least two Judeo-Italian varieties, based on the Salentino and Venetian languages, were also used in Corfu.

=== Time based divisions ===
It is also divided into two time based varieties which are Early Judeo-Italian which is attested through writings made from 1200 to 1700 and Modern Judeo-Italian attested from 1700 onwards.

==Characteristics==
All of the spoken Judeo-Italian varieties used combination of Hebrew verb stems with Italian conjugations (e.g., , &#x27;to eat&#x27;; , &#x27;to steal&#x27;; , &#x27;to speak&#x27;; , &#x27;to go&#x27;). Similarly, there are abstract nouns such as , &#x27;goodness&#x27;. This feature is unique among Jewish languages, although there are arguably parallels in Jewish English dialect.

Also common are lexical incorporations from Hebrew, particularly those applicable to daily life. Terms from other Jewish languages such as Yiddish and Judeo-Spanish were also incorporated. Bagitto, spoken in Livorno, is particularly rich in loanwords from Judeo-Spanish and Judeo-Portuguese.

It was claimed by Cassuto that most Judeo-Italian dialects reflect the Italian dialect of places further to the south, due to the fact that since the expulsion of the Jews from the Kingdom of Naples, the general direction of Jewish migration in Italy had been northward.

Compared to the non Jewish languages they&#x27;re related to the Judeo-Italian languages are relatively similar to each other, with them all being mutually intelligible.

The degree of variation between Judeo-Italian dialects and their base languages (Judeo-Venetian and Venetian, Judeo-Piedmontese and Piedmontese etc.) varies. With some like Judeo-Mantuan being more divergent, others like Judeo-Venetian being less divergent and some like Judeo-Livornese being in the middle.

==Works in &quot;Judeo-Italian&quot;==
The oldest known Judeo-Italian text is found in the margin notes of a copy of the Mishnah written between 1072 and 1073 known as &quot;Mishnah A&quot;. One of the most accessible ways to view the Judeo-Italian language is by looking at translations of biblical texts such as the Torah and Hagiographa. For example, the Judeo-Italian language is represented in a 1716 Venetian Haggadah, a Jewish prayer book typically used during a seder, some samples of which are available online.

Today, there are two locations, the Oxford Bodleian Library, and the Jewish Theological Seminary in New York, in which many of these texts have been archived.

Some notable writers who wrote in Judeo-Italian are: Guido Bedarida who wrote in Bagitto, and Annibale Gallico who wrote in Judeo-Mantuan. A theater groups named &quot;Chaimme &#x27;a sore &#x27;o sediaro e &#x27;a moje&quot; (Chaim, the sister, the chairmaker and the wife) performs plays in Judeo-Roman, and Crescenzo Del Monte wrote plays in Judeo-Roman, and the play Gnora Luna in Judeo-Florentine.

<doc id="761023" wikidata="Q5237832" url="?curid=761023" title="David William Murray, 3rd Earl of Mansfield">
<text>David William Murray, 3rd Earl of Mansfield, KT (7 March 1777 – 18 February 1840) was a British army officer and peer, who served as Lord Lieutenant of Clackmannanshire from 1803 until his death.

==Early life==

Murray was born in Paris in 1777 to David Murray, then 7th Viscount Stormont, and Louisa, daughter of Charles Cathcart, 9th Lord Cathcart and Jane Hamilton. In 1792 Murray&#x27;s father succeeded to his uncle William Murray&#x27;s 1792 creation of the Mansfield earldom and became 2nd Earl of Mansfield in 1793; Murray succeeded his father in 1796 as 3rd Earl of Mansfield and inheriting Kenwood House in Camden, London.

Mary Hamilton, his mother&#x27;s first cousin, visited Kenwood and described &quot;little William had written an answer to a letter from his great uncle Lord Mansfield—the style was easy &amp; the language perfectly good—no one would imagine this letter to have been written by a boy of 7 years old—he has very astonishing abilities of comprehension equally surprising for his age.&quot;

He was educated at Westminster School, at Leipzig, Germany and at Christ Church, Oxford. He received a degree, Doctor of Civil Law, from Christ Church, Oxford in 1793. He joined the Militia, becoming Colonel of the East Middlesex Militia in 1798, transferring to the Royal Perth Militia on 3 May 1803.

==Career==
Mansfield served as Lord Lieutenant of Clackmannanshire from 1803 until his death.

In 1835, Mansfield was elected a Knight of the Order of the Thistle. He was also a Fellow of the Royal Society (elected 1802) and a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London.

===Kenwood House===

Mansfield appointed William Atkinson to undertake essential structural reinforcement to Kenwood house between 1803 and 1839. Although the Mansfields preferred to live at their Scottish seat, Scone Palace, which had also been previously rebuilt by William Atkinson.In March 1805, Lord Mansfield gave a grand dinner at Mansfield House in Portland Place, the guests included Prince Adolphus, Duke of Cambridge, Marquess and Marchioness of Bath, Lord Grantham, Lord Somerville, and his sister Lady Elizabeth Finch-Hatton with her husband.

When his eldest daughter Lady Frederica died in 1823, Mansfield took his greatly afflicted and depressed son in law to live at Kenwood, but he never recovered and died in 1825, the jury gave a verdict of &quot;temporary insanity&quot;.

In July 1835, King William IV and Queen Adelaide paid a royal visit to Kenwood, this was attended by 800 of the nobility and gentry, scattered around the Kenwood garden. The Marchioness of Salisbury wrote &quot;The King and Queen and Royalties extremely well pleased: the King trotted about with Lord M. in the most active manner&quot;.

==Personal life==

On 16 September 1797, Mansfield married Frederica Markham, a daughter of Sarah ( Goddard) Markham and William Markham, Archbishop of York. William Markham was a close friend of his father, the 2nd Earl of Mansfield. They had nine children:

# Lady Frederica Louisa Murray (1800–1823), who married Hon. James Hamilton Stanhope in 1823 and had one son, James Stanhope.
# Lady Elizabeth Anne Murray (born 1803), who died unmarried.
# Lady Caroline Murray (born 1805), who died unmarried.
# William David (1806–1898), who succeeded as 4th Earl of Mansfield and married Louisa, third daughter of Cutbbert Ellison, in 1829 and had issue.
# Lady Georgina Catherine Murray (born 1807).
# Honourable Charles John Murray (born 1810), who married Frances Elizabeth, second surviving daughter of Thomas Anson, 1st Viscount Anson in 1835.
# Honourable David Henry Murray (born 1811), a Captain in the Scots Fusilier Guards.
# Lady Cecilia Sarah Murray (1814–1830), who died unmarried.
# Lady Emily Murray (1816–1902), married Francis Seymour, later 5th Marquess of Hertford, in 1839 and had issue.

Mansfield died at Leamington on 18 February 1840 and is buried in St Andrew&#x27;s Churchyard, Kingsbury, London.

<text>The Tipperary Hill Heritage Memorial, dedicated in 1997, is located on Tipperary Hill in Syracuse, New York. The memorial was erected in honor of early citizens who, in the opinion of local residents, were brave sons of Ireland who stood up to City Hall and won the battle of the &quot;Green over Red&quot; traffic light.

The memorial features bronze, life-size figures of a 1930s Irish immigrant family and was sculpted by Dexter Benedict of Penn Yan, New York. The father is pointing out the traffic light to his wife, daughter and son who has a sling shot in his back pocket, hinting that he might know a little bit of the history of the light.

The memorial is located in &quot;Tipperary Hill Memorial Park&quot; which was originally the site of a commercial building that held a prominent position on the northeast corner of Milton Avenue and Tompkins Street and was later demolished. It is the newest city park in Syracuse.

==History==


When the city first installed traffic signals in 1925, they placed one at a major intersection on Tipperary Hill, in the center of the neighborhood business district, located on the corner of Tompkins Street and Milton Avenue.

===Stone throwers===

The &quot;Stone Throwers&quot; were several youths from the neighborhood who were among some of the original residents who rallied against the addition of the new traffic light on Tipperary Hill because it sported the British &quot;red&quot; prominently placed over the Irish &quot;green&quot;. Due to strong national rivalries, the traditional &quot;red-over-green&quot; lights were interpreted as symbols of England over Ireland and offended the youths of the close-knit Irish neighborhood.

The youths, aged 11 to 17, included John &quot;Jacko&quot; Behan (born 1909), Richard &quot;Richie&quot; Britt (born 1908), James M. &quot;Duke&quot; Coffey (born 1910), Kenneth &quot;Kenny&quot; Davis (born 1914), George Dorsey, Gerald &quot;Mikis&quot; Murphy (born 1914), Francis &quot;Stubbs&quot; Shortt (born 1908), and Eugene Thompson (1911-2001).

Patrick &quot;Packy&quot; Corbett (born 1909), former Onondaga County Sheriff, was named honorary member of the group after growing up on Tipp Hill, however, would not acknowledge vandalizing the traffic light.

By 1925, the city was divided into north, east, west, and south side ethnic neighborhoods. According to one of the &quot;Stone Throwers&quot;, &quot;if you were Irish, you stayed in the Westend.&quot;

The youths gathered up stones which they called &quot;Irish confetti&quot; and &quot;took aim at the red lenses, managing to put the signal out of commission,&quot; an act they performed many times. Eventually, neighborhood leaders, led by &quot;Tipp Hill&quot; alderman, John J. &quot;Huckle&quot; Ryan and a number of local businessmen persuaded the city fathers to install a green-over-red traffic signal, the only one of its kind in the U.S. and it has been that way ever since.

===Establishment of memorial===

In 1997, local residents of Irish ancestry and business owners, including Peter Coleman, gathered resources and encouraged the city to demolish an old commercial building, to build a small park and erect the &quot;Tipperary Hill Heritage Memorial&quot;.

In a fund raising effort, Coleman, a saloonkeeper for over 50 years and owner of &quot;Coleman&#x27;s Authentic Irish Pub&quot; at 100 South Lowell Avenue, also sold commemorative bricks engraved with the names of loved ones for $75 each which were set around the base of the statue. There were a total of 450 installed.

Jerry Wilson, a local jewelry store owner, was also instrumental in the establishment of the memorial park. On March 17, 1995, he helped Coleman raise $6,000 for the statue and the two planned a fund raiser &quot;among pubs on The Hill.&quot;

<doc id="761025" wikidata="Q2571392" url="?curid=761025" title="Senate of Pakistan">
<text>The Senate of Pakistan, constitutionally the House of the Federation, is the upper house of the bicameral Parliament of Pakistan. As of 2023, It has a maximum membership of 96, of which 92 are elected by the provincial legislatures using single transferable vote; four represent the federal capital. Members sit for terms lasting six years, with half of the house up for election every three years. Unlike the National Assembly, the Senate is a continuing chamber and hence not subject to dissolution.

First convened in 1973, the Senate&#x27;s composition and powers are established by the Article 59 of the Constitution of Pakistan. Each of the four provinces is represented by 23 senators regardless of population, while the Islamabad Capital Territory is represented by four senators, all of whom serve staggered six-year terms. The Senate secretariat is located in the east wing of the Parliament Building; the National Assembly convenes in the west wing of the same building.

The Senate has several exclusive powers not granted to the National Assembly, including the powers of making parliamentary bills as a being enforced into law. Elections are held every three years for one half of the Senate and each Senator has a term of six years. The Constitution does not allow for the dissolution of the Senate.

== History ==

After Independence, the first Constituent Assembly of Pakistan, elected in December 1947 after partition, was assigned the task of framing the Constitution of Pakistan. This Assembly passed the Objectives Resolution on 12 March 1949, laying down principles which later became a substantive part of the Constitution of Pakistan. However, before it could accomplish the task of framing the constitution, it was dissolved in October 1954. Thereafter, the Governor General, convened the Second Constituent Assembly in May 1955, which framed and passed the first Constitution of Pakistan on 29 February 1956. That Constitution was promulgated on 23 March 1956, which provided for a parliamentary form of Government with a unicameral legislature. Hence, from 14 August 1947 to 1 March 1956, the Government of India Act 1935 was retained as the Constitution of Pakistan.

On October 7, 1958, Martial Law was promulgated and the Constitution abrogated. The Military Government appointed a Constitution Commission in February 1960 which framed the 1962 Constitution. That Constitution provided for a Presidential form of Government with a unicameral legislature. The 1962 Constitution was abrogated on 25 March 1969. The Civil Government, which came to power in December 1971 pursuant to 1970 elections, gave the nation an interim Constitution in the year 1972.

The 1970 Assembly framed the 1973 Constitution, which was unanimously passed on 12 April and promulgated on 14 August 1973. The 1973 Constitution provides for a parliamentary form of Government with a bicameral legislature, comprising the National Assembly and the Senate.

The membership of the Senate, which was originally 45, was raised to 63 in 1977 and to 87 in 1985. The government of Gen. Pervez Musharraf raised the membership of the Senate from 87 to 100 through the Legal Framework Order (LFO), 2002, enforced on 21 August 2002 and the government of Asif Ali Zardari raised the membership of the Senate from 100 to 104 through the 18th amendment in 2011 (four minority members from four provinces). After the Twenty-Fifth Amendment, the number of seats in the Senate was reduced to 96, as the seats for FATA were removed after its merger with KPK.

== Purpose and role ==
The main purpose for the creation of the Senate of Pakistan was to give equal representation to all the federating units since the membership of the National Assembly was based on the population of each province. Equal provincial membership in the Senate, thus, balances the provincial inequality in the National Assembly.

There are one hundred senatorial seats. There are 18 women Senators; Pakistani constitution requires that there be at least 17 women Senators. Members of the Senate are elected according to Article 59 of the Constitution.

===President and Parliament===
Under Article 50 of the Constitution, the Majlis-i-Shoora (Parliament) of Pakistan consists of the President and two Houses, to be known respectively as the National Assembly and the Senate. The President is elected by members of both Houses of the Parliament and the Provincial Assemblies. The President may be removed from office or impeached through a resolution, passed by not less than two-thirds of the total membership of the Parliament in a joint sitting of the two Houses, convened for the purpose. 
In the event that the office of the President becomes vacant, the Chairman of the Senate acts as President till such time that the position may be filled through a by election. This also occurs when the President, by reason of absence or any other incapacity, is unable to effectively exercise their office.

===Relations between the Houses===
Unless both the Houses pass a Bill, and it receives the President&#x27;s assent it cannot become a law including in the case of a money bill which is the sole prerogative of the National Assembly. Through an amendment, the role of a Mediation Committee, composed of eight members of each House, has been introduced to evolve consensus on Bills, in case there is a disagreement between the two houses

===Cabinet===
The Constitution provides that there shall be a Cabinet headed by the Prime Minister, which is collectively responsible to the National Assembly. The Prime Minister is chosen from the National Assembly. The Federal Ministers and Ministers of State are appointed from among the members of Parliament. However, the number of Federal Ministers and Ministers of State who are members of Senate, shall not at any time, exceed one fourth of the numbers of Federal Ministers.

<text>170 Maria is a Main belt asteroid that was discovered by French astronomer Henri Joseph Perrotin on January 10, 1877. Its orbit was computed by Antonio Abetti, and the asteroid was named after his sister, Maria. This is the namesake of the Maria asteroid family; one of the first asteroid families to be identified by Japanese astronomer Kiyotsugu Hirayama in 1918. This family may be the parent body of the large near-Earth objects 433 Eros and 1036 Ganymed.

In the Tholen classification system, this is categorized as a stony S-type asteroid based on its spectrum. Observations performed at the Palmer Divide Observatory in Colorado Springs, Colorado during 2007 produced a light curve with a period of 13.120 ± 0.002 hours and a brightness range of 0.21 ± 0.02 in magnitude. Previous measurements from 2000 gave 13.14 and 5.510 hour estimates for the period.

An occultation of a star by Maria was observed from Manitoba, Canada, on June 10, 1997.

<text>Friedrich Heinrich Ernst Graf von Wrangel (13 April 1784 – 2 November 1877) was a &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; of the Prussian Army.

A Baltic German, he was nicknamed &quot;Papa Wrangel&quot; and was a member of the Baltic noble family of Wrangel.

==Early life and career==
Wrangel was born in Stettin (now Szczecin, Poland) in Pomerania into the Wrangel family. He was actually a relative uncle to the world-famous explorer Ferdinand von Wrangel. He entered a dragoon regiment in 1796 and became second lieutenant in 1798. He fought as a subaltern during the Napoleonic Wars, distinguishing himself especially at Heilsberg in 1807 and receiving the order &quot;Pour le Mérite&quot;. In the reorganization of the army, Wrangel became first lieutenant and then captain; won distinction and promotion to lieutenant-colonel in the War of Liberation in 1813; won the Iron Cross at Wachau, near Leipzig; and became colonel in 1815.

Wrangel commanded a cavalry brigade in 1821, and two years later, he was promoted to major-general. He commanded the 13th Division, with headquarters at Münster, in Westphalia, in 1834 during riots caused by differences between the Archbishop of Cologne and the Crown, and the determination and the resolution with which he treated the clerical party prevented serious trouble. He was promoted to lieutenant-general, received many honours from the court, enjoyed the confidence of the Junkers and commanded at Königsberg and then Stettin.

==First Schleswig War==
In 1848, Wrangel commanded the II Corps of the army of the German Confederation during the First Schleswig War, was promoted to General of Cavalry and won several battles. However, the other European powers pressured Prussia to withdraw its forces, and King Frederick William IV accordingly ordered Wrangel to withdraw his troops from the duchies. Wrangel refused by asserting that he was under the command of not the king of Prussia but the regent of Germany. He proposed that at the very least, any treaty concluded should be presented for ratification to the Frankfurt Parliament, which was dominated by the liberals, which gave Liberals the rather mistaken idea that Wrangel was on their side. However, the Danes rejected that proposal, and negotiations were broken off, and after painful hesitation, Prussia signed a convention at Malmö that yielded to practically all of the Danish demands on 26 August 1848.

==German Revolutions==
Wrangel&#x27;s insubordination was not counted against him when, in the autumn, he was summoned to Berlin to suppress its riots during the German revolutions of 1848–49. As governor of Berlin and commander-in-chief of Brandenburg (appointments that he held until his death), he proclaimed a state of siege and ejected the Liberal president and the members of the Chamber. Thus, on two occasions in the troubled history of Prussia&#x27;s revival, Wrangel&#x27;s uncompromising sternness achieved its object without bloodshed.

==Second Schleswig War==
From then on, Wrangel was most prominent in connection with the revival of the Prussian cavalry from the neglect and inefficiency into which it had fallen during the years of peace and poverty since 1815. In 1856, after 60 years of service, he was made a field marshal. At the age of 80, he commanded the Austro-Prussian army in the Second Schleswig War with Denmark in 1864. Wrangel was too old for active work and often issued vague or impracticable orders; he had always desired the young &quot;Red Prince&quot;, Prince Frederick Charles of Prussia, to have the command. However, the prestige of Wrangel&#x27;s name and the leadership of Frederick Charles, Helmuth von Moltke the Elder, Eduard Vogel von Falckenstein and Ludwig von Gablenz made the campaign an overwhelming success.

==Later life==
After the Battle of Dybbøl, Wrangel resigned his command, was created a &quot;Graf&quot; (count), and received other honours. In 1866, &quot;Papa&quot; Wrangel assisted in the Austro-Prussian War but without a command on account of his great age. He took a keen interest in the second reorganisation of the cavalry army in 1866 to 1870, and in the Franco-Prussian War in 1870 to 1871. He died in Berlin in 1877.

==Legacy==
On the 70th anniversary of his joining the army, Wrangel&#x27;s regiment, the 3rd Cuirassiers, was given the title &quot;Graf Wrangel&quot;. A noteworthy Commander of this regiment was the Swedish Count Gilbert Hamilton who led the regiment during World War I.

==Honours==
He received the following orders and decorations:

<text>Gai lan, kai-lan, Chinese broccoli, or Chinese kale (Brassica oleracea var. alboglabra) is a leafy vegetable with thick, flat, glossy blue-green leaves with thick stems, and florets similar to (but much smaller than) broccoli. A &quot;Brassica oleracea&quot; cultivar, gai lan is in the group &quot;alboglabra&quot; (from Latin &quot;albus&quot; &quot;white&quot; and &quot;glabrus&quot; &quot;hairless&quot;). When gone to flower, its white blossoms resemble that of its cousin &quot;Matthiola incana&quot; or hoary stock. The flavor is very similar to that of broccoli, but noticeably stronger and slightly more bitter.
==Cultivation==
Gai lan is a cool season crop that grows best between . It withstands hotter summer temperatures than other brassicas such as broccoli or cabbage. Gai lan is harvested around 60–70 days after sowing, just before the flowers start to bloom. The stems can become woody and tough when the plant bolts. It is generally harvest for market when 15-20cm (6-8in) tall however it can also be produced as &quot;baby gai lan.&quot; The &quot;baby&quot; version is cultivated through crowding of seedings and generous fertilization; they resemble Brussels sprouts although they have looser folds.

==Hybrids==
Broccolini is a hybrid between broccoli and gai lan.

==Uses==
===Culinary===
The stems and leaves of &quot;gai lan&quot; are eaten widely in Chinese cuisine; common preparations include gai lan stir-fried with ginger and garlic, and boiled or steamed and served with oyster sauce. It is also common in Vietnamese, Burmese and Thai cuisine. In Chinese cuisine it is often associated with dim sum restaurants.

In Americanized Chinese food (like beef and broccoli), gai lan was frequently replaced by broccoli when gai lan was not available.
