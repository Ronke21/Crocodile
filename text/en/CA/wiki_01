<text>Sam Eagle is a Muppet character from the sketch comedy television series &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;, best known for his ultra-patriotism and disciplined manner of being. Sam originated on the television series, where he was performed by Frank Oz. Sam has appeared in every Muppet film; as himself in &quot;The Muppet Movie&quot;, &quot;The Great Muppet Caper&quot;, &quot;The Muppets Take Manhattan&quot;, &quot;Muppets from Space&quot;, and &quot;The Muppets&quot;, as well as the Head Schoolmaster in &quot;The Muppet Christmas Carol,&quot; Samuel Arrow in &quot;Muppet Treasure Island&quot; and a CIA agent in &quot;Muppets Most Wanted.&quot; The character also appears in the role of an ABC executive for broadcast standards and practices in the television series, &quot;The Muppets.&quot;

== Background ==
Also known as Sammy or Samuel, Sam&#x27;s overtly patriotic spirit distinguishes him from the rest of the Muppet cast, as does his general stuffiness and pomposity. It has been a running gag in either &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;, or the Muppet movies, that his nationalism is represented towards the United States. In &quot;The Muppet Christmas Carol&quot;, the fourth wall was broken when Sam (playing Scrooge&#x27;s former headmaster) informs the young Scrooge that he will enjoy business because &quot;It is the American way&quot;. The Great Gonzo, who plays Charles Dickens, as well as the narrator, corrects him and says that the line is, &quot;It is the British way,&quot; since the story is set in the United Kingdom.

== Character traits ==
Sam often railed against the &#x27;low brow&#x27; entertainment he claimed was on the show, and often tried to bring &#x27;dignity and class&#x27; to the performances, usually without any real success. During the first season, Sam would introduce two Muppet characters named Wayne and Wanda who would often sing various songs that were considered by Sam to be &#x27;normal&#x27; and &#x27;high brow&#x27; when compared to the rest of the show and its cast. 

On the show, Sam acts as a censor and comments on his being under-appreciated. He often gives self-important lectures in which he espouses some conservative idea only to find himself forced to stop in embarrassment at risk of sounding like a hypocrite. On one occasion, he gives a lecture about conservationism in which he reads a list of endangered animal species that he feels are the focus of misguided conservation efforts, only to sheepishly withdraw his statement when he realizes that his own species is included. In another sketch, he lectures on indecency because all people are nude underneath their clothes, leaving the podium in embarrassment upon realizing that all birds are similarly nude underneath their feathers.

Throughout the first season of &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;, Sam introduces his favorite singing duo, Wayne and Wanda, with gushing aplomb, praising them for their appropriateness. Although they are never able to finish a song (their routines always end with slapstick violence), Sam still adores them because they appeal to his conservative sensibilities: the couple sings old standards like &quot;You Do Something to Me&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s Only a Paper Moon&quot;.

Though he claims to be a cultured bird, close observation reveals that Sam knows nothing about culture, especially the culture of his own country. He has mistaken Beethoven for a playwright and thinks &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; was written by William Shakespeare. When informed that ballet dancer Rudolf Nureyev would be the guest star (Episode 213), Sam declared Nureyev as his favorite opera singer. Also when Nureyev arrived, Sam didn&#x27;t recognize him and ejected him from the theater. Sam is often hostile toward others who do not possess similar views to his own.

Sam does not interact with the guest stars of the show as often as the rest of the cast, but he is featured prominently in several episodes. In one, he throws casually dressed guest star Rudolf Nureyev out of the building in a fit of temper, mistaking him for a bum. Although he is forgiven by Nureyev, he is still disheartened because Mr. Nureyev (whom he believes is an opera singer rather than a ballet dancer) did not live up to his expectations. In another, he seeks out Zero Mostel – who he believes to be &quot;a man of dignity&quot;, and thus, a kindred spirit – only for Mostel to literally mock him behind his back during his usual tirade. Similarly, Sam makes a bet with Kermit the Frog during the Elton John episode, demanding Kermit to explain &quot;WHY does he DRESS like a STOLEN CAR?&quot;, and is forced to wear a flamboyant, albeit patriotic, costume. During the third season&#x27;s Halloween episode, Sam confronts Alice Cooper. Railing against the audience and &quot;indecency&quot; and &quot;low brow&quot; humor, Sam calls Cooper a &quot;demented, sick, degenerate, barbaric, naughty, Freako!&quot; Rather than being insulted by these comments as Sam was intending, Cooper takes it as a compliment and thanks Sam, to which Sam despairingly retorts, &quot;Freakos one, civilization zero.&quot;

On &quot;Muppets Tonight&quot;, Sam periodically hosted a debate show a la The McLaughlin Group, entitled &quot;From The Eagle&#x27;s Nest&quot;. Unfortunately, the only permanent debaters were Miss Piggy&#x27;s dimwitted nephews Andy &amp; Randy, who routinely got the better of him. His tagline for the show was &quot;Let&#x27;s talk POLITICS!&quot;

On &quot;Jim Henson&#x27;s Animal Show&quot;, Sam was the only Muppet character to make a crossover appearance, guest-starring in the third-season episode &quot;Bald Eagle&quot;.

== Film appearances ==
Sam has appeared in every major Muppet feature film, usually only as a brief cameo or minor role (&quot;The Muppet Movie&quot;, &quot;The Great Muppet Caper&quot;, &quot;The Muppets Take Manhattan&quot;, &quot;The Muppet Christmas Carol&quot;, &quot;Muppets from Space&quot;). However, in &quot;Muppet Treasure Island&quot;, he played the first mate Samuel Arrow and thus takes a more active role in the story.

In &quot;The Muppets&quot;, Sam is employed at a political news television station hosting a segment called &quot;Everything Stinks&quot;, though he soon finds himself reuniting with the other Muppets. He is later seen as one of the phone operators of &quot;The Muppet Telethon&quot; and as part of the barbershop quartet performing &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; with Rowlf the Dog, Link Hogthrob and Beaker. He also participates in the telethon&#x27;s &quot;Rainbow Connection&quot; finale.

In &quot;Muppets Most Wanted&quot;, Sam plays a fairly major role as a CIA agent who reluctantly collaborates with Interpol agent Jean Pierre Napoleon (Ty Burrell) to solve a series of burglaries in Europe. Sam and Napoleon interrogate the Muppets but learn nothing useful, and they mistakenly arrest Kermit the Frog and Fozzie Bear for the thefts.

In the TV series &quot;The Muppets&quot;, Sam is a main character and is in charge of the broadcast standards and practices for ABC. He also develops a romantic interest in Janice.

<text>Kopi luwak, also known as civet coffee, is a coffee that consists of partially digested coffee cherries, which have been eaten and defecated by the Asian palm civet (&quot;Paradoxurus hermaphroditus&quot;). The cherries are fermented as they pass through a civet&#x27;s intestines, and after being defecated with other fecal matter, they are collected. Asian palm civets are increasingly caught in the wild and traded for this purpose.

Kopi luwak is produced mainly on the Indonesian islands of Sumatra, Java, Bali, Sulawesi, and in East Timor. It is also widely gathered in the forest or produced in farms in the islands of the Philippines, where the product is called &quot;kape motit&quot; in the Cordillera region, in Tagalog areas, &quot;kapé melô&quot; or &quot;kapé musang&quot; in Mindanao, and in the Sulu Archipelago.
Kopi luwak is also produced in Palawan&#x27;s Langogan Valley. The beans from droppings of the Asian palm civet and Palawan binturong (&quot;Arctictis binturong whitei&quot;) are collected from the forest floor and cleaned.

Producers of the coffee beans argue that the process may improve coffee through two mechanisms: selection, where civets choose to eat only certain cherries; and digestion, where biological or chemical mechanisms in the animals&#x27; digestive tracts alter the composition of the coffee cherries.

The traditional method of collecting feces from wild Asian palm civets has given way to an intensive farming method, in which the palm civets are kept in battery cages and are force-fed the cherries. This method of production has raised ethical concerns about the treatment of civets and the conditions they are made to live in, which include isolation, poor diet, small cages, and a high mortality rate.

Although kopi luwak is a form of processing rather than a variety of coffee, it has been called one of the most expensive coffees in the world, with retail prices reaching per kilogram for farmed beans and per kilogram for wild-collected beans. Another epithet given to it is that it is the &quot;Holy Grail of coffees.&quot;

== History ==
The origin of kopi luwak is closely connected to the history of coffee production in Indonesia; Dutch colonialists established coffee plantations in Indonesia and imported beans from Yemen. In the 19th century, farmers in central Java started to brew and drink coffee from excreted beans collected at their plantations.

== Production ==
Kopi luwak is brewed from coffee beans that traversed the gastrointestinal tract of an Asian palm civet, and were thus subjected to a combination of acidic, enzymatic, and fermentation treatment. During digestion, digestive enzymes and gastric juices permeate through the endocarp of coffee cherries and break down storage proteins, yielding shorter peptides. This alters the composition of amino acids and impacts the aroma of the coffee. In the roasting process, the proteins undergo a non-enzymatic Maillard reaction.
The palm civet is thought to select the most ripe and flawless coffee cherries. This selection influences the flavour of the coffee, as does the digestive process. The beans begin to germinate by malting, which reduces their bitterness. When performed in nature, or in the wild, these two mechanisms achieve the same goal as selective picking and the wet or washed process of coffee milling: 1) harvesting optimally ripe cherries and 2) mechanically and chemically removing the pulp and skin from the cherry, leaving mainly the seed.

Traditionally, excreted coffee beans were collected directly in plantations and forests. As the international demand for kopi luwak increased, some producers turned to caged production methods to increase yields. In 2014, the annual kopi luwak production was grossly estimated at less than . It is produced in Indonesia, East Timor, the Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam and Ethiopia.

== Taste ==

The taste of kopi luwak varies with the type and origin of excreted beans, processing, roasting, aging, and brewing. The ability of the civet to select its berries, and other aspects of the civet&#x27;s diet and health, like stress levels, may also influence the processing and hence taste.

Within the coffee industry, kopi luwak is widely regarded as a gimmick or novelty item. The Specialty Coffee Association of America (SCAA) states that there is a &quot;general consensus within the industry...it just tastes bad&quot;. A coffee professional compared the same beans with and without the kopi luwak process using a rigorous coffee cupping evaluation. He concluded: &quot;it was apparent that luwak coffee sold for the story, not superior quality...Using the SCAA cupping scale, the luwak scored two points below the lowest of the other three coffees. It would appear that the luwak processing diminishes good acidity and flavor and adds smoothness to the body, which is what many people seem to note as a positive to the coffee.” Professional coffee tasters were able to distinguish kopi luwak from other coffee samples, but remarked that it tasted &quot;thin&quot;. Some critics claim more generally that kopi luwak is simply bad coffee, purchased for novelty rather than taste.
A food writer reviewed kopi luwak available to American consumers and concluded &quot;It tasted just like...Folgers. Stale. Lifeless. Petrified dinosaur droppings steeped in bathtub water. I couldn&#x27;t finish it.&quot;

== Imitation ==
Several commercial processes attempt to replicate the digestive process of the civets without animal involvement. Researchers with the University of Florida have been issued with a patent for one such process. Brooklyn-based food startup Afineur has also developed a patented fermentation technology that reproduces some of the taste aspects of Kopi Luwak while improving coffee bean taste and nutritional profile.

Vietnamese companies sell an imitation kopi luwak, made using an enzyme soak which they claim replicates the civet&#x27;s digestive process.

Imitation has several motivations. The high price of kopi luwak drives the search for a way to produce kopi luwak in large quantities. Kopi luwak production involves a great deal of labour, whether farmed or wild-gathered. The small production quantity and the labor involved in production contribute to the coffee&#x27;s high cost. Imitation may be a response to the decrease in the civet population.

== Animal welfare ==

Growing numbers of intensive civet &quot;farms&quot; have been established and are operated in Southeast Asia, confining tens of thousands of animals to live in battery cages and be force-fed.
&quot;The conditions are awful, much like battery chickens&quot;, said Chris Shepherd, deputy regional director of TRAFFIC in Southeast Asia. &quot;The civets are taken from the wild and have to endure horrific conditions. They fight to stay together but they are separated and have to bear a very poor diet in very small cages. There is a high mortality rate and for some species of civet, there&#x27;s a real conservation risk. It is spiraling out of control&quot;. The trade in palm civets for the production of kopi luwak may constitute a significant threat to wild populations.

In 2013, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) investigators found wild-caught civets on farms in Indonesia and the Philippines. They were deprived of exercise, proper diet, and space. Video footage from the investigation shows abnormal behaviours such as repeated pacing, circling, or biting the bars of their cages. The animals often lose their fur. A BBC investigation revealed similar conditions. Farmers using caged palm civets in north Sumatra confirmed that they supplied kopi luwak beans to exporters whose produce ends up in Europe and Asia.
Tony Wild, the coffee executive responsible for bringing kopi luwak to the Western world, has stated he no longer supports using kopi luwak due to animal cruelty and launched a campaign called &quot;Cut the Crap&quot; to halt the use of kopi luwak.

== Price and availability ==
Kopi luwak is one of the most expensive coffees in the world, selling for between in 2010. The price paid to collectors in the Philippines is closer to US$20 per kilogram. The specialty Vietnamese &quot;weasel coffee&quot;, which is made by collecting coffee beans eaten by wild civets, is sold at US$500 per kilogram. Most customers are Asian, especially those originating from Japan, China, and South Korea.

Some specialty coffee shops sell cups of brewed kopi luwak for US$35–80.

==Authenticity and fraud==
Investigations by PETA and the BBC found fraud to be rife in the kopi luwak industry, with producers willing to label coffee from caged civets with a &quot;wild sourced&quot; or similar label.

Genuine kopi luwak from wild civets is difficult to purchase in Indonesia and proving it is not fake is very difficult – there is little enforcement regarding use of the name &quot;kopi luwak&quot;, and there&#x27;s even a local cheap coffee brand named &quot;Luwak&quot;, which costs under US$3 per kilogram but is occasionally sold online under the guise of real kopi luwak.

== Variations ==
Coffee beans can be &quot;seeded&quot; with the same microbes as in civet gut to produce the same coffee flavor without having to deal with civet excrement.

The binturong is also sometimes kept captive for production of kopi luwak.

There are reports of a kopi luwak type process occurring naturally with muntjac and birds. Bat coffee is another variation that is in demand. Bats feed on the ripest coffee and fruits and spit out the seeds. These seeds are dried and processed to make coffee with a slight fruity flavor.

==In popular culture==
In the movie &quot;The Bucket List&quot;, billionaire health care magnate Edward Cole (played by Jack Nicholson) brings kopi luwak with him on all of his travels, but is unaware of how the drink is produced. Carter Chambers (Morgan Freeman) explains how civets defecate kopi luwak coffee beans, and that the gastric juices of the defecated beans give kopi luwak its unique aroma.

The Japanese manga series &quot;Beastars&quot; features an anthropomorphic civet character named Deshico that produces kopi luwak.

<text>Benjamin Barker Odell Jr. (January 14, 1854May 9, 1926) was an American businessman and politician who served as the 34th governor of New York from 1901 to 1904.

==Early life==
Born in Newburgh, New York, in 1854, Odell&#x27;s father, Benjamin B. Odell Sr., was a leading businessman who served twelve years as the city&#x27;s mayor. Odell studied at Bethany College in West Virginia, and at the Columbia College of Columbia University. While he would have graduated in 1877, Odell dropped out of school in his junior year, returning to Newburgh to help in his father&#x27;s business.

Odell worked his way up to head his father&#x27;s ice business, starting as the driver of an ice delivery truck, earning $2 per day. Having become familiar with the people of the Newburgh area, Odell participated in the political affairs of his father, which would allow him to become involved in the politics of his home town, turning a bellwether Democratic city into one strongly Republican. He would go on to be appointed Ice Controller of New York during the First World War, and later president of both the Consolidated Gas, Electric Light, Heat, and Power Company of Newburgh and of the Central Hudson Steamboat Company. During his early days in politics, Odell ran unsuccessfully for town supervisor of New Windsor, as well as losing a bid for New York State Senate after being drafted for the Republican nomination in a heavily Democratic district.

==Early political career==
In 1894, Odell was elected as a Republican to the 54th United States Congress, serving New York&#x27;s 17th congressional district, at that time encompassing Orange, Rockland, and Sullivan Counties. He ran for, and was reelected in 1896, but declined in 1898. He became one of the most powerful New York Republican operatives in of his time, serving for ten years as chairman of the Republican State Executive Committee, both before and after his two terms in Congress. In 1896, at the state convention called by Thomas C. Platt, Odell narrowly lost nomination for governor; having received an 11–5 vote in favor of his nomination, Platt was convinced overnight that Frank S. Black was the superior candidate, and Black was subsequently nominated for, and won the governorship in 1896.

In 1898, Odell was the first to suggest to Republican boss Thomas C. Platt that Theodore Roosevelt ought to be the Republican candidate for governor, which met Platt&#x27;s protest. With Platt convinced that Roosevelt was a figure who would disturb state politics, Odell used his position as the Republicans&#x27; state chairman to convince Platt that Governor Black would lose reelection if nominated in 1898. Returning as a hero from the Spanish–American War, Roosevelt&#x27;s campaign, under Odell&#x27;s management, would win the governorship by a comfortable margin in 1898. In his biography, then former President Roosevelt would say Odell was one of three men most responsible for his candidacy being pressed on Platt.

==Governorship (1901–1904)==

In the state election of 1900, Thomas C. Platt wanted to &#x27;rid himself&#x27; of Theodore Roosevelt from the governorship of New York. Devising a scheme to have Roosevelt nominated to replace the late Garret Hobart as vice president to President William McKinley, Platt placed Odell as nominee for governor in 1900. Odell would go on to handily defeat John B. Stanchfield in the general election to succeed Theodore Roosevelt as Governor of New York.

Taking office on January 1, 1901, Odell was the first New York governor of the twentieth century. As governor, Odell reduced the state tax, simplified governance of state insane asylums into the State Commission on Lunacy, and broke with allegiance to Thomas C. Platt, making independent decisions for his administration. In the state election of 1902, Odell won reelection to a second term, and Thomas Platt&#x27;s control over Republican politics in the state waned.

In his second term as governor, Odell pressed for a referendum to enlarge the Erie Canal, which was approved. He opposed and vetoed &quot;special legislation&quot; and &quot;personal bills&quot; passed by the legislature, which were focused on individual interests.

===Legacy===
In the 1920 presidential election, Odell was a presidential elector for Warren G. Harding and Calvin Coolidge.

After six months of prolonged illness in late 1925 to early 1926, Benjamin B. Odell died on May 9, 1926, in his home town of Newburgh, surrounded by family. Odell&#x27;s death came with praise from prominent New York politicians. Former Secretary of State, future Chief Justice, and fellow former Governor Charles Evans Hughes said of Odell:

Former governor and fellow Republican Nathan L. Miller said:

Incumbent Democratic Governor Al Smith said of Odell&#x27;s death:

<text>Ayria is a Canadian futurepop/synthpop musical project formed in early 2003 by Toronto&#x27;s Jennifer Parkin following her departure from the futurepop and EBM band Epsilon Minus.

==Biography==
The first Ayria album, &quot;Debris&quot;, was released on Alfa Matrix in 2003. 

During this period, Parkin performed guest vocals for several other projects, including Belgium&#x27;s Aïboforcen and Implant, and Mexico&#x27;s Isis Signum, some of which she would return to later on, such as the late 2011 release of two songs with Aïboforcen.

In late 2005, touring for &quot;Flicker&quot; commenced with several Canadian dates, a UK Festival (Interzone in Cardiff, the first European performance by Ayria), and a U.S. West Coast tour. 2006 saw many more opportunities for Ayria such as a first ever European tour in November as well as a debut performance in Osaka, Japan. As of 2008, Ayria was continuing a full United States tour as the supporting act for The Crüxshadows. She has played successful shows at DragonCon, alongside figures such as Sir Patrick Stewart, most recently in 2011, and has also performed with the seminal EBM/synthpop band VNV Nation.

The first two songs by Ayria since the release of &quot;Flicker&quot; included &quot;The Gun Song&quot;, featured on the compilation &quot;Alfa Matrix - Re:connected [2.0]&quot;, released in August 2006 and &quot;Six Seconds On All Sides&quot; released on Dancing Ferret&#x27;s &quot;Asleep By Dawn&quot; compilation in fall of 2006. The third full-length album, &quot;Hearts For Bullets&quot;, was released on September 12, 2008, featuring these two songs.

All of her albums have thus far come with double CD versions available that feature a collection of remixed tracks and other inclusions such as side projects and covers.

Ayria&#x27;s fourth full-length album, &quot;Plastic Makes Perfect&quot;, released May 24, 2013, during their North American tour with Project Pitchfork.

On April 22, 2016, she released a fifth full-length, titled &quot;Paper Dolls&quot;. It came in both a single CD, a two disc deluxe version and as a strictly limited pink vinyl. The second CD is a spiritual sequel to the bonus disc &quot;Planet Parkin&quot; that came with her third album &quot;Hearts for Bullets&quot;, titled &quot;The Heartless Kingdom&quot;.

==Touring members==
Ayria has performed with various band members for her live performances, which have included Mike Wimer of VNV Nation, Eric Gottesman, Shaun Frandsen, Joe Byer (v01d), Cam Eleon, Justin Pogue, and Kevin Toole. For her North American tour with Project Pitchfork in 2013, Sarah Wimer joined the live group; whereas in 2014, the live formation was completed by Michael Linke, who since then has played the keys beside of Sarah Wimer on various European shows of Ayria.

==Biography==
Early in his military career, he observed Soviet military activities while serving as a military liaison in Potsdam, East Germany. Later, he taught courses in Russian history at West Point, New York, and while serving at the United States embassy in Moscow in the early 1970s, he visited all of the republics of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. Although constantly trailed by KGB, he nonetheless managed to smuggle out a large portion of Alexander Solzhenitsyn&#x27;s archive, including the author&#x27;s membership card for the Writers&#x27; Union and Second World War military citations; Solzhenitsyn subsequently paid tribute to Odom&#x27;s role in his memoir &quot;Invisible Allies&quot; (1995).

Upon returning to the United States, he resumed his career at West Point where he taught courses in Soviet politics. Odom regularly stressed the importance of education for military officers.

In 2003, he revealed how the question of the 1967 USS &quot;Liberty&quot; incident’s deliberateness “just wasn’t a disputed issue” within the NSA. Along with NSA Deputy Director for Operations Oliver Kirby, U.S. Air Force Major General John E. Morrison (Kirby’s successor), and Admiral Bobby Ray Inman, he said he was unaware of any agency official at any time who dissented from the “deliberate” conclusion.

In 1977, he was appointed as the military assistant to Zbigniew Brzezinski, the hawkish assistant for national security affairs to President Jimmy Carter. Among the primary issues he focused on were American-Soviet relations, including the SALT nuclear weapons talks, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, the Iran hostage crisis, presidential directives on the situation in the Persian Gulf, terrorism and , and the executive order on telecommunications policy.

From 2 November 1981 to 12 May 1985, Odom served as the Army&#x27;s Assistant Chief of Staff for Intelligence. From 1985 to 1988, he served as the director of the National Security Agency, the United States&#x27; largest intelligence agency, under president Ronald Reagan.

Odom was a Senior Fellow at the Hudson Institute, where he specialized in military issues, intelligence, and international relations. He was also an adjunct professor at Yale University and Georgetown University, where he taught seminar courses in U.S. National Security Policy and Russian Politics. He earned a national reputation as an expert on the Soviet military.

Since 2005, he had argued that U.S. interests would be best served by an immediate withdrawal from Iraq, having called the 2003 U.S. invasion the worst strategic blunder in the history of U.S. foreign policy. He had also been critical of the NSA&#x27;s warrantless wiretapping of international calls, having said &quot;it wouldn&#x27;t have happened on my watch&quot;. Odom was also openly critical of the neoconservative influence in the decision to go to war: &quot;It&#x27;s pretty hard to imagine us going into Iraq without the strong lobbying efforts from the AIPAC and the [neoconservatives], who think they know what&#x27;s good for Israel more than Israel knows.&quot;

Odom was a member of the Military Intelligence Hall of Fame and the American Philosophical Society. He was also a member of the advisory council of the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation.

==Quotes==
* &quot;The president has let [the Iraq war] proceed on automatic pilot, making no corrections in the face of accumulating evidence that his strategy is failing and cannot be rescued. He lets the United States fly further and further into trouble, squandering its influence, money and blood, facilitating the gains of our enemies.
* &quot;An attempt to extort Congress into providing funds by keeping U.S. forces in peril [...] surely would constitute the &#x27;high crime&#x27; of squandering the lives of soldiers and Marines for his own personal interest.
* &quot;As many critics have pointed out, terrorism is not an enemy. It is a tactic. Because the United States itself has a long record of supporting terrorists and using terrorist tactics, the slogans of today&#x27;s war on terrorism merely makes [&quot;sic&quot;] the United States look hypocritical to the rest of the world.&quot;
* &quot;The invasion of Iraq may well turn out to be the greatest strategic disaster in American history.

<doc id="756686" wikidata="Q5404291" url="?curid=756686" title="Seabeck, Washington">
<text>Seabeck is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in Kitsap County, Washington, United States. The population was 1,105 at the 2010 census. Seabeck is a former mill town on Hood Canal.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Seabeck&quot; comes from the Twana &quot;/ɬqábaqʷ/&quot;, from &quot;/ɬ-/&quot;, &quot;far&quot;, &quot;/qab/&quot;, &quot;smooth, calm&quot;, and &quot;/-aqʷ/&quot;, &quot;water&quot;.

In his narrative of his voyage down the Hood Canal in 1792, Captain George Vancouver made no mention of the Seabeck area. The first known use of the place name &quot;Seabeck&quot; dates from the United States Exploring Expedition of 1838 to 1842. On May 16, 1841, Captain Charles Wilkes of the expedition ordered Lieutenant Augustus Case to take four boats and survey the Hood Canal. Wilkes wrote of the strait:

Hoods Canal branches off from Admiralty Inlet at Suquamish Head, where it is two miles wide. Its direction is south-southeast, five miles; it then turns to the south-southwest, six miles; thence to Squaller&#x27;s Point, southeast, six miles, turning again to the west-southwest, three miles to Nukolowap Point, south point to Toandons Peninsula, which divides the north branch from the canal. Continuing on this course across the mouth of the north branch, for four miles, is Quatsap Point, passing the harbor and point of Scabock [sic.] Harbor on the east then southwest, three miles to Triton Head ...

== History ==
Seabeck was founded in 1856 by Marshall Blinn and William Adams, doing business as the Washington Mill Company. Their lumber was in such demand they built a second mill, then a shipyard to build boats to haul the lumber to California, which had high demand due to the California Gold Rush. Eventually, along with four saloons, the town had two general stores and two hotels. In 1876, there were over 400 people living in Seabeck. After decades of success, in the 1880s the demand had eased, and most of the easily accessible trees had been harvested. In August 1886 a spark from the ship &quot;Retriever&quot; started a fire that consumed both mills, along with other buildings. Rumors flew that the mills would not be re-built, so most residents moved to other towns with mills, notably Port Hadlock, turning Seabeck into a virtual ghost town. In 1914, the old townsite was purchased by Laurence Colman and revived as a retreat for Puget Sound&#x27;s YMCA &amp; YWCA clubs, and eventually all non-profit groups. Several surviving buildings from the 1850s-60s were refurbished and today form the campus of the Seabeck Conference Center.

Seabeck is a mostly rural area, consisting primarily of the conference center across the road and lagoon from the general store, coffee shop, antique store, a pizza parlor and Olympic View Marina. There are houses and a now-demolished elementary school that served the areas around Seabeck. The population was 1,105 at the 2010 census.

Seabeck is the hometown of figure skater Ashley Wagner.

=== Shipbuilding ===
Under the direction of William J. Adams, the Washington Mill Company undertook the role of a shipyard, constructing vessels for a brief period of time in the late 1800s. In total, the Washington Mill Company is responsible for creating at least seven vessels of varying type within the city of Seabeck.

==== Constructed ships ====

* &quot;Georgia –&quot; 1872, steamer 
* &quot;Cassandra Adams&quot; – 1876, sail
* &quot;Richard Holyoke&quot; – 1877, tug
* &quot;Olympus&quot; – 1879, sail
* &quot;Mary Winkleman&quot; – 1881, sail
* &quot;Retriever&quot; – 1881, sail
* &quot;Louise –&quot; 1884, steamer

==Geography==
Seabeck is in western Kitsap County, along the southeastern shore of Hood Canal. It is northwest of Bremerton. The village of Seabeck is in the center of the Seabeck CDP, which extends east to Big Beef Creek and west to Stavis Bay. Scenic Beach State Park is in the western part of the CDP. Lake William Symington is directly south, a few kilometers away from the southern boundaries of the city.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the Seabeck CDP has a total area of , of which are land and , or 21.85%, are water.

== Notable places ==

=== Seabeck Conference Center ===
In the early 1900s, Laurence Colman and Arn Allen of Seattle formed a partnership to build a facility for YMCA and YWCA groups to hold summer conferences. In 1914, Lawrence Coleman and his brother George purchased much of the original Seabeck site. In 1936, Laurence Colman&#x27;s son, Ken Colman, incorporated the conference grounds as a private, nonprofit corporation. He deeded to the corporation the that now make up Seabeck Conference Center. The center is available for events during the year. For over thirty years, the Seattle Lighthouse for the Blind has held its annual retreat there, hosting deaf-blind visitors from across the nation and world.

=== Seabeck Elementary ===
The town&#x27;s primary school, Seabeck Elementary, offered kindergarten through sixth grade. It had a long and locally significant history and thus was supported by the community. The school closed at the end of the 2006-07 school year. Demolition of the old school building started in autumn of 2019, and is planned to become the new location of the area&#x27;s fire department. The school gym, which was built separate from the school in 1990, will remain standing. The field and track will also remain open, and both are available for use and open to community recreation.

In 2021 the newly formed Seabeck Community Center began operations on the site, using the renovated school-gym building, and featuring a farmers&#x27; market during the summer months.

=== Seabeck Cemetery ===
The Seabeck Cemetery lies in the woods of Seabeck near the elementary school. It is a popular attraction among locals due to its antiquity that is only locally challenged by the Buena Vista Cemetery in Port Gamble.

=== Scenic Beach State Park ===
The Scenic Beach State Park in the western part of the CDP began as the Emel family&#x27;s homesite in 1911. The site became a resort, then a state park, offering areas for visitors to boat, camp, or picnic.

=== Guillemot Cove Nature Reserve ===
The Kitsap County Guillemot Cove Nature Reserve is southwest of Seabeck and was the property of the Reynolds family from 1939 to 1993. The area is open to the public. Attractions include a hollowed-out stump of a red cedar, referred to as the Stump House.

<doc id="756707" wikidata="Q453393" url="?curid=756707" title="Lee Konitz">
<text>Leon &quot;Lee&quot; Konitz (October 13, 1927 – April 15, 2020) was an American jazz alto saxophonist and composer.

He performed successfully in a wide range of jazz styles, including bebop, cool jazz, and avant-garde jazz. Konitz&#x27;s association with the cool jazz movement of the 1940s and 1950s includes participation in Miles Davis&#x27;s &quot;Birth of the Cool&quot; sessions and his work with pianist Lennie Tristano. He was one of relatively few alto saxophonists of this era to retain a distinctive style, when Charlie Parker exerted a massive influence. Like other students of Tristano, Konitz improvised long, melodic lines with the rhythmic interest coming from odd accents, or odd note groupings suggestive of the imposition of one time signature over another. Other saxophonists were strongly influenced by Konitz, such as Paul Desmond and Art Pepper.

He died during the COVID-19 pandemic from complications brought on by the disease.

==Biography==
=== Early life ===
Konitz was born in 1927 in Chicago to Jewish emigrants Abraham Konitz (1897–1964) and Anna Getlin (1900–1973). Konitz had two older brothers, Sol (1919–1997) and Herman (later Herman Kaye; 1921–2005).

His father, who was born in Brody, Austria-Hungary (now Ukraine), operated a laundry business in the back of which the family lived. His mother was born in the Pinsk District (now Belarus). Lee went to Hebrew school for a short time and went to synagogue sometimes. The Konitz family was not strict religiously, but observed Jewish holidays and some dietary laws. Lee was ambivalent about traditional Jewish culture and said, &quot;there was something in-groupish about the Jewish people that I saw, that I didn&#x27;t like–there was always that word &quot;Gentile&quot; which I hated.&quot; Neither of his parents were musical but were supportive of Konitz&#x27;s interest in music.

At the age of 11, inspired by Benny Goodman, Konitz received his first clarinet. He received classical training from Lou Honig who also taught Johnny Griffin and Eddie Harris. A year later, his admiration for Lester Young led him to drop the instrument in favour of the tenor saxophone. He eventually moved from tenor to alto. He received saxophone training from Santy Runyon. Konitz&#x27;s early influences were big band horn players such as Johnny Hodges, Roy Eldridge, Willie Smith and Scoops Carry. He also greatly admired Louis Armstrong and credited the influence Benny Carter&#x27;s solo on &quot;I Can&#x27;t Believe that You&#x27;re in Love with Me&quot; had on him.

=== Career ===
Konitz began his professional career in 1945 with the Teddy Powell band as a replacement for Charlie Ventura. A month later, the band broke up. Between 1945 and 1947, he worked intermittently with Jerry Wald. In 1946, he met pianist Lennie Tristano, and the two men worked together in a small cocktail bar. His next substantial work was with Claude Thornhill in 1947 with Gil Evans arranging and Gerry Mulligan as a composer.

He participated with Miles Davis in a group that had a brief booking in September 1948 and another the following year, but he also recorded with the band in 1949 and 1950; the tracks were later collected on the album &quot;Birth of the Cool&quot; (Capitol, 1957). In his autobiography, Davis related that some Black musicians resented his hiring of Konitz: &quot;Then a lot of black musicians came down on my case about their not having work, and here I was hiring white guys in my band. So I just told them that if a guy could play as good as Lee Konitz played — that&#x27;s who they were mad about most, because there were a lot of black alto players around — I would hire him every time [...] I&#x27;m hiring a motherfucker to play, not for what color he is.&quot;

Konitz stated he considered the group to belong to Mulligan. His debut as leader also came in 1949 with tracks collected on the album &quot;Subconscious-Lee&quot;. (Prestige, 1955). He turned down an opportunity to work with Goodman in 1949, a decision he later regretted. Parker lent him support on the day Konitz&#x27;s child was born in Seattle, Washington, while he was stuck in New York City. The two were good friends, not the rivals some jazz critics made them out to be.

In the early 1950s, Konitz recorded and toured with the Stan Kenton Orchestra, but also continued to record as a leader. In 1961, he recorded &quot;Motion&quot; for Verve, with Elvin Jones on drums and Sonny Dallas on bass. This spontaneous session consisted entirely of standards. The loose trio format aptly featured Konitz&#x27;s unorthodox phrasing and chromaticism.

In 1967, Konitz recorded &quot;The Lee Konitz Duets&quot; for Milestone, in configurations that were often unusual for the period (saxophone and trombone, two saxophones). The recordings drew on nearly the entire history of jazz from Louis Armstrong&#x27;s &quot;Struttin&#x27; with Some Barbecue&quot;, with valve trombonist Marshall Brown, to two free improvisation duos: one with a Duke Ellington associate, violinist Ray Nance, and one with guitarist Jim Hall.

Konitz contributed to the film score for &quot;Desperate Characters&quot; (1971). In 1981, he performed at the Woodstock Jazz Festival, which was held in celebration of the tenth anniversary of the Creative Music Studio.

Konitz worked with Warne Marsh, Dave Brubeck, Ornette Coleman, Charles Mingus, Attila Zoller, Gerry Mulligan, and Elvin Jones. He recorded trio dates with Brad Mehldau and Charlie Haden, released by Blue Note, as well as a live album recorded in 2009 at Birdland and released by ECM in 2011, with drummer Paul Motian. Konitz became more experimental as he grew older and released a number of free jazz and avant-garde jazz albums, performing with many younger musicians, including saxophonist/composer Ohad Talmor with whom he collaborated on 6 albums, featuring mostly new Konitz&#x27;s music arranged by Talmor for a variety of ensembles. He soloed on Elvis Costello&#x27;s song &quot;Someone Took The Words Away&quot; in 2003, and his album with saxophonist/vocalist Grace Kelly was given 4 1/2 stars by Michael Jackson in &quot;Down Beat&quot; magazine.

Konitz had heart problems requiring surgery. He was scheduled to appear at Melbourne&#x27;s Recital Centre in 2011 for the Melbourne International Jazz Festival, but canceled due to illness.

In August 2012, Konitz played to sell-out crowds at the Blue Note club in Greenwich Village, as part of Enfants Terribles, a collaboration with Bill Frisell, Gary Peacock, and Joey Baron. Days after his 87th birthday in 2014, he played three nights at Cafe Stritch in San Jose, California, with the Jeff Denson Trio, improvising on his favoured old standards. In 2018, his duo album &quot;Decade&quot; (Verve Records) celebrated both his 90th birthday and ten years of collaboration with pianist Dan Tepfer.

Konitz was married three times. His first wife was Ruth Hamalainen. Ruth appears to have been a writer before she married, as she wrote an article with Barry Ulanov about Lennie Tristano that was published in the November 1946 issue of &quot;Metronome&quot;. Lee and Ruth had five children: Josh, Paul, Rebecca, Stephanie, and Karen. Karen was the namesake of his 1956 song &quot;Kary&#x27;s Trance&quot;; Rebecca inspired the 1950 improvisation “Rebecca”, and the 1951 original “Hi, Beck”; “Stephanie” inspired a so called ballad tune from 1958. Lee and Ruth later divorced. His second wife was Tavia Maria Mladinich (1931–1991), who died while they were married. A song named for her appeared on his 1977 album &quot;Pyramid&quot;. His third wife was Gundula. They divorced also, though they remained close friends. He wrote a ballad for her entitled &quot;Gundula&quot; that he recorded for the first time on the 1999 album &quot;Pride&quot;. Konitz died at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City on April 15, 2020, as a result of pneumonia brought on by COVID-19 during the pandemic in New York City.

<text>A public defender is a lawyer appointed to represent people who otherwise cannot reasonably afford to hire a lawyer to defend themselves in a trial. Several countries provide people with public defenders, including the UK, Belgium, Hungary and Singapore, and some states of Australia. Brazil is the only country in which an office of government-paid lawyers with the specific purpose of providing full legal assistance and representation to the needy free of charge is established in the constitution. The Sixth Amendment to the US Constitution, as interpreted by the Supreme Court, requires the US government to provide legal counsel to indigent defendants in criminal cases. Public defenders in the United States are lawyers employed by or under contract with county, state or federal governments.

==By country==
In civil law countries, following the model from the French Napoleonic Code of criminal procedure, the courts typically appoint private attorneys at the expense of the state.

===Australia===
The Australian states of Victoria and New South Wales both have dedicated Public Defenders chambers. These chambers retain barristers who are employed by the state government to represent legally-aided clients who are charged with serious indictable offences. In New South Wales, Public Defenders only appear in criminal matters, both at trial and appellate level, while in Victoria, Public Defenders also undertake some family law and civil work.

The New South Wales Senior Public Defender is Belinda Rigg, Senior Counsel, who was the first female public defender in NSW upon her appointment in 2019. In Victoria, the Chief Public Defender is Tim Marsh.

In Queensland, the Legal Aid Office (Queensland) was merged with the Public Defender&#x27;s Office in 1991, in an expanded service providing clients to access family, civil and all criminal law services.

===Brazil===
The Constitution of Brazil uniquely provides for a public defenders&#x27; office (&quot;Defensoria Pública&quot;) at both state and federal levels. Public defense is a right to poor people, who must declare, formally, that they cannot afford regular legal aid, to benefit from public defenders&#x27; services.

Public defenders, like prosecutors and judges, are admitted to their positions through civil service examination. The public defender&#x27;s office assists the poor and lower middle-class in both civil and criminal matters, although the poorest states in the country are still struggling to set up a state public defenders office.

Public defense in Brazil dates back to 1897, when a decree mandated government-funded legal assistance in the state of Rio de Janeiro, then called Legal Assistance (&quot;Assistência Jurídica&quot;). The Constitution of 1937 extended &quot;Assistência Jurídica&quot; to the entire country, but without the same effectiveness that is derived from the current, 1988 Constitution.

===Germany===

Germany provides legal representation, legal advice, and help in covering court costs in civil cases to those who cannot raise the necessary funds to hire an attorney, but only when there is a reasonable chance of success. In criminal cases where the defendant faces at least one year of imprisonment, the defendant has the right to legal counsel. Although there is a right to legal defense, there is no organized public defender system. Instead, any lawyer can be appointed to provide counsel to a specific defendant, and the defendant can select a specific lawyer. Questions of payment are deferred until the end of a trial, and the court will decide the cost of the case to the losing party. The defendant will not be charged for legal services if acquitted. If convicted, the defendant will be required to pay the lawyer&#x27;s expenses unless the court finds that the defendant is indigent.

===Hungary===
In Hungary, the police, the public prosecutor or the court (depending on what individual cases require) appoints a criminal defender at the state&#x27;s cost to defend those who can not afford a chosen lawyer. The defence counsel&#x27;s participation is required by the Criminal Procedure Act. Usually a private lawyer is appointed, one for each defendant, and conflict of interest between contradicting suspects is avoided, e.g. the same lawyer may not represent two accused whose evidence is mutually contradictory. If convicted, although in principle the defendant is liable for the fee, it is rarely pursued.

===India===
In India, free legal aid is provided by National Legal Services Authority. It is available at all the levels of court.

===Singapore===
Legal assistance in Singapore is provided by the State and the Pro Bono Services Office of the Law Society.

The State provides legal assistance in criminal cases where the accused faces the death penalty. The government also provides legal representation and advice in civil cases such as for divorce, child custody, adoption, wrongful dismissal, letters of administration/probate, tenancy disputes, claims in contract and tort, through the Ministry of Law&#x27;s Legal Aid Bureau (LAB). Assistance from the LAB is not free, and most clients are required to contribute towards the costs of the work done, but the amount a client is charged depends on a number of factors, among them the client&#x27;s financial means.

The Pro Bono Services Office of the Law Society runs the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme, which provides criminal legal assistance to the poor and needy who are unable to afford a lawyer, and are facing charges in a Singapore court for non death-penalty offences under statutes covered by CLAS.

===United Kingdom===

There are a small number of Public Defender Service offices in England and Wales with lawyers employed directly by the Legal Aid Agency to provide advice in police stations and representation in magistrates and crown courts. The Public Defender Service has existed since 2001, a department of the Legal Aid Agency, an Executive Agency of the Ministry of Justice (UK). It has four offices across England and Wales. The majority of state funded criminal defence work, however, is provided by private duty solicitors contracted to the Legal Aid Agency and paid by the case under the legal aid scheme.

In Scotland a wider network of Public Defender Solicitor Office (PDSO) lawyers employed by the Scottish Legal Aid Board (SLAB) are available to represent those accused of crimes in addition to private lawyers (duty solicitors) paid under the legal aid scheme. The PDSO is a not-for-profit organisation funded through SLAB.

===United States===
The 1963 US Supreme Court case &quot;Gideon v. Wainwright&quot; held that the Sixth Amendment&#x27;s right to counsel provision requires the government to provide legal counsel to indigent defendants in criminal cases. Different jurisdictions, however, use different approaches in providing legal counsel for criminal defendants who can&#x27;t afford private attorneys. Exactly which defendants qualify as &quot;indigent&quot; also varies by jurisdiction: Often a state will stipulate a maximum income threshold above which a defendant is not considered to be indigent, and thus does not qualify for a public defender. This threshold may vary depending on the severity of the crime with which a defendant is charged. For example, a defendant&#x27;s income may be too high to entitle him or her to a public defender in misdemeanor proceedings, but sufficiently low to qualify them as indigent when faced with a felony charge.

The term public defender in the United States is often used to describe a lawyer who is appointed by a court to represent a defendant who cannot afford to hire an attorney. More correctly, a public defender is a lawyer who works for a public defender&#x27;s office, a government-funded agency that provides legal representation to indigent defendants. The court appoints the public defender&#x27;s office to represent the defendant, and the office assigns a lawyer to the defendant&#x27;s case. In the federal criminal court system and some states and counties, representation is through a publicly funded public defender office. The state of Oregon is the only state in which indigent defense is exclusively provided by non-profit firms which are contracted and funded by the state.

Other courts may appoint private lawyers who have agreed to represent indigent defendants, with appointment being either on a contractual basis, through which the lawyer accepts an agreed number of cases from the court for the term of the contract, or a case-by-case basis. The majority of the states in the U.S. employ some combination of these delivery models.

<doc id="756727" wikidata="Q381937" url="?curid=756727" title="Amédée Ozenfant">
<text>Amédée Ozenfant (15 April 1886 – 4 May 1966) was a French cubist painter and writer. Together with Charles-Edouard Jeanneret (later known as Le Corbusier) he founded the Purist movement.

==Education==
Ozenfant was born into a bourgeois family in Saint-Quentin, Aisne and was educated at Dominican colleges in Saint-Sébastien. After completing his education he returned to Saint-Quentin and began painting in watercolour and pastels.

In 1904 he attended a drawing course run by Jules-Alexandre Patrouillard Degrave at the Ecole Municipale de Dessin Quentin Delatour in Saint-Quentin. In 1905 he began training in decorative arts in Paris, where his teachers were Maurice Pillard Verneuil and later Charles Cottet.

By 1907 he had enrolled in the Académie de La Palette, where he studied under Jacques-Emile Blanche. He befriended Roger de La Fresnaye and André Dunoyer de Segonzac, who were his fellow students. In 1908 he began exhibiting at the Salon de la Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts, and two years later began exhibiting at the Salon d&#x27;Automne.

==Collaboration with Le Corbusier and development of Purism==

Between 1909 and 1913 he travelled to Russia, Italy, Belgium, and the Netherlands and attended lectures at the Collège de France in Paris. In 1915, in collaboration with Max Jacob and Guillaume Apollinaire, Ozenfant founded the magazine &quot;L’Elan&quot;, which he edited until 1916, and his theories of Purism began to develop.

He met the Swiss architect and painter Charles-Edouard Jeanneret (Le Corbusier) in 1917, and they jointly expounded the doctrines of Purism in their book &quot;Après le cubisme&quot;. Its publication coincided with the first Purist exhibition, held at the Galerie Thomas in Paris in 1917, in which Ozenfant exhibited. There was a further collaboration between them on the journal &quot;L&#x27;Esprit Nouveau&quot;, which was published from 1920 to 1925.

A second Purist exhibition was held at the Galerie Druet, Paris, in 1921 in which Ozenfant again exhibited. In 1924 he opened Académie Moderne, a free studio in Paris with Fernand Léger, where they both taught with Aleksandra Ekster and Marie Laurencin. Ozenfant and Le Corbusier wrote &quot;La Peinture moderne&quot; in 1925 and in 1928 Ozenfant published &quot;Art&quot;, which was subsequently published in English as &quot;The Foundations of Modern Art&quot; in 1931. In this he fully expounds his theory of Purism, and it is remarkable for its idiosyncratic and aphoristic style.

==His influence on the use of colour in England==
He later founded his own atelier, l’Académie Ozenfant, in the residence and studio that Le Corbusier had designed for him. He moved to London in 1936, where he set up the Ozenfant Academy of Fine Arts in May of that year, before moving to New York City some two years later. His students in London included Leonora Carrington, Sari Dienes, Anne Said, Stella Snead and Hamed Saeed. Students in New York included his assistant, Chaim Koppelman, the Canadian Madeleine Laliberté and Iranian Manoucher Yektai.

In the early Purist manifestoes, colour was deemed secondary to form, and this could be seen in the careful placing of colour to reinforce discrete architectural elements by Le Corbusier in his work of the mid-1920s. However, by the time he was in England, Ozenfant had refined his ideas about colour and outlined many of these in the six articles on the subject that he wrote for the &quot;Architectural Review&quot;. Colour was now regarded as an essential element of architecture, rather than something considered by the architect while his work was being erected. Ozenfant believed that colour always modifies the form of the building and should receive more careful attention. We must endeavour to introduce a little order into this business, or at least sense into a great deal of it. But what is sense without order? We must try to find some method of arriving at some sort of order—one that will at least enable us to escape from this vagueness in the design of colour.

Ozenfant&#x27;s revised thoughts on the importance of colour were partly due to the influence of the artist Paul Signac and his theories on Divisionism. Signac maintained that the Neo-Impressionist technique of applying brushstrokes obtained the maximum brightness, colour, and harmony. Unlike the techniques used by the earlier Impressionists, patches of colours remained distinct, blending when viewed at a distance. In this instance, when no fusion of the colours takes place, the interaction is called “simultaneous contrast”, a condition in which colours merely influence one another by proximity. This technique prevents the muddiness or darkening that result when patches of colour actually run into each other. It was an extension of this technique that was recommended by Ozenfant for achieving “colour solidity” in architecture, altering colours visually by contrast to create the illusion of solidity.

This notion of “solidity” increasingly became an issue as the nature of modern construction changed, especially when dealing with such things as the lightweight partition and the glass curtain wall.

In 1937 Ozenfant said: I believe that an immense service would be done to architects, decorators, house-painters etc., if a chart especially adapted to their particular requirements were established. This chart might contain about a hundred hues.

Ozenfant&#x27;s articles on colour were read with interest, particularly by:…the students at the Architectural Association (AA), for example, but even for David Medd, a student at the AA who later authored the color standards for British schools, Ozenfant had already gone to the United States by the time he inquired about the course at the Academy.

The effect of his words can be seen in a number of articles on colour published in England shortly after the Second World War. Indeed, we are told in 1956 that they had a direct influence on the decoration of some of the early post-war schools.

==Final years==
The Ozenfant School of Fine Arts in New York was in operation from 1939 until 1955. He became a US citizen in 1944. Ozenfant taught and lectured widely in the United States until 1955, when he returned to France, where he was renaturalized in 1953. He remained there for the rest of his life and died in Cannes in 1966.

<doc id="756751" wikidata="Q1133804" url="?curid=756751" title="Life and death">
<text>Life and death (死活) is a fundamental concept in the game of Go, where the status of a specific group of stones is determined as either being &quot;alive&quot;, where they may remain on the board indefinitely, or &quot;dead&quot;, where the group will be &quot;captured&quot; and removed from the board. The basic idea can be summarized by:
==Explanation==
The concept of life and death is a consequence of two basic Go rules.

* A group of stones with no liberties is captured.
* A stone may not be played on a position where it will be captured directly, unless it directly captures another group.

Because of these rules, some groups can never be captured (and thus are &quot;alive&quot;), while others cannot avoid capture (and thus are &quot;dead&quot; even if they have not yet been removed from the board).

The group at a is not alive, but may become alive, so is &quot;unsettled&quot;. The group at b is &quot;dead&quot;. The group at c and d is &quot;alive&quot;.

=== Examples ===

See the diagram on the right, and suppose white tries to capture the black groups:
:*a: White is not allowed to play a, because a white stone at a would be captured immediately, and so would be a suicide.

:*b: White may play b, because the black group will be completely surrounded &quot;first&quot;, and thus it is captured, and the black stones will be immediately removed from the board.

:*c &amp; d: White cannot play c or d because the black group still has another liberty after one stone is placed. So, playing at c or d would be suicide.

The black group surrounding c &amp; d can never be captured, so it is called &quot;alive&quot;. The group has two separate liberties, where white cannot play. A group such as b that cannot become alive is called &quot;dead&quot;. Groups that are neither &quot;alive&quot; nor &quot;dead&quot; are called &quot;unsettled&quot;, and their fate will be resolved later.


e and f are eyes, g is a false eye.

=== Eyes and false eyes ===
Liberties inside a group are called &quot;eyes&quot;. In the previous example, a, b, c and d are eyes. An eye may be a single empty intersection, or more of them. In the diagram on the left, the intersections marked e form a single eye, and f forms another eye. The group has two—separated—eye spaces. Even though white can make a move in these eyes, black could eventually capture the white stones, and each eye would thereby be reduced to a single intersection.

An inner liberty where the opponent can still capture part of the group that encloses this liberty is called a &#x27;false eye&#x27; or &#x27;deficient eye&#x27;. A group with only one eye is not alive. In the example on the left, white can play at g, and capture a black stone. That eye is then destroyed, and black has only one eye left, so that group is now &quot;dead&quot;. The black group at g is dead, because it can not form two true eyes.

==Importance==
Life and death situations and issues occur when an area with a group of stones surrounds a small area (&lt;7 points) so that it may not be possible to form two separate independent &quot;eyes&quot;. As the board fills up during the course of the game, certain groups will survive, and others may not. A group with a single eye can normally be captured, in the end, by filling first round the outside. The purpose of making two eyes is to prevent this. Novices sometimes interpret making two eyes in a narrow way, and form &#x27;explicit&#x27; eyes one by one. This is often the wrong approach, and it is better to play generally to make a territory inside a group out of which two eyes can surely be made, if and when the opponent attacks it. Groups with seven or more points of territory can usually form two eyes when attacked, unless there are structural weaknesses.

Because the loss of a group can mean the loss of the game, and because the efficient use of each move is important, knowing the life and death status of one&#x27;s own groups (as well as one&#x27;s opponent&#x27;s) is an important skill to cultivate, if one is to become a strong player. The correct, accurate plays with which to make a group secure, or to kill the opponent&#x27;s group, are studied deeply by all strong players.

==Status of a group==

The concept of &#x27;status&#x27; is discussed in &quot;Life and Death&quot; by James Davies. Groups of stones are divided into those that are &quot;alive&quot;, &quot;dead&quot; or &quot;unsettled&quot;. Here &quot;alive&quot;, for example, is an unconditional judgement made, that with best play from both players, the group can survive to the end of the game. That assumes the &quot;opponent&quot; starts: the alive status means that, whatever the attack made, there is an adequate defensive answer.

The &quot;unsettled&quot; status is therefore most worthy of attention. By playing first, the attacking player can kill such a group. By playing first, the defending player can save such a group. There is an enormous range of formations that are unsettled.

A group can be considered &quot;alive&quot;, &quot;dead&quot;, or &quot;unsettled&quot; based on whether two eyes can be made regardless of how the opponent plays. Naturally, one space is insufficient. Two adjacent spaces are insufficient to make two eyes as well, since putting a stone in will create one eye only. The opponent can simply fill in one of the two spots, threatening to fill in the other, forcing the player to capture that one by playing in the second one. Then, the opponent simply plays there again, killing the group. Usually this will not be done during the game, but at the end, during calculation, the group will be labeled &quot;dead&quot; and removed as prisoners. The only way to actually remove a group from the board is to fill its &quot;eye space&quot; with all but one, forcing it to capture the filling-in group by putting a stone in the last space. If the created group is not alive, then continuing this process will eventually kill the entire group.

===Status of groups of three===


Unsettled groups with three empty points

There are two possible groups of three, an &quot;r&quot; shape and three in a line. Both of these are unsettled, as whoever plays obtains the desirable result. The person trying to create two eyes can play in the middle spot (the one connected to the other two) and the other two are now eyes. If the opponent plays, they will play in the same spot, followed by an adjacent spot (the other player&#x27;s piece would be captured were they to play in one of the two open spots), leaving only one empty spot left. This forces the first player to capture, leaving the dead two shape. The critical points are circled in the &quot;Unsettled groups with three empty points&quot; diagram.

===Status of groups of four===


Groups with four empty points


With four blank spots, there are five unique shapes. Three are alive, one is unsettled, and one is dead.

The three alive ones are the straight line, L and Z shape. If the opponent plays in any spot, the first player can live by playing in the adjacent spot in the center two. In the diagram &quot;Groups with four empty points&quot; black&#x27;s groups in the upper corners are alive. If the opponent plays any of the circled positions, playing the other circled position will secure the status of the black group.

The unsettled shape is the four-stone pyramid, shown in the left bottom corner. Whoever plays in the circled center spot gets the desired result, so the player whose move it is wins.

A two-by-two square space is dead: if black plays in the top left corner of the two-by-two square, white can respond by playing in the bottom right corner (see the L-shaped case in the previous section). On the other hand, if white wants to capture the black group, they only have to play anywhere inside the square, and there will be no way for black to avoid capture.

===Status of groups with more than four empty points===
There are no dead shapes with more than four empty points, though there are a couple of unsettled ones.

Unsettled groups with five empty points


A five stone &quot;plus sign&quot; (the X pentomino) and a &quot;bulky five&quot; (the P pentomino consisting of a square and one point off it, similar shape to a fist with the thumb extended&quot;) are the two unsettled ones. Playing in the point that touches the most others (four in the &quot;plus sign&quot; - center point, three in the &quot;bulky five&quot; - the one point in the square touching the outside point) will give the desired result to whoever does so.

Unsettled groups with six empty points


There are two unsettled six shapes, and the rest are all alive (see also miai).

One shape is the &quot;rabbity six&quot; — a square, plus adding the two points touching any one of the corners. (Similar to the plus sign five, but add any of the four taken corner points to get the unsettled six.) The opponent playing in the center point threatens to fill all but one spot with a bulky five shape, and there is no defense.

The other is the rectangular six &quot;in the corner&quot;. The opponent playing first in the top middle of the rectangle can kill the group. The defender playing first can save it by playing either there, or at the lower middle (denoted &quot;a&quot;).

Any group surrounding more than six points is alive, but it may be necessary to respond correctly if the opponent attacks. Additionally, because of special properties of the corner, a group with more than six points might not be unconditionally alive, as it is possible for the opponent to make an eye or two within its territory.

== Seki ==

Seki


There is a possibility for stones to be alive without eyes. This situation happens when two groups of otherwise dead stones face each other without being able to achieve capture.

The figure on the right shows one of the most simple seki. The black and white stones in contact with the circled points do not have any eyes and may seem dead. However, if Black tries to capture white, they must fill one of the circled points, which will only lead to its own capture by white. The same applies to White, who cannot fill black liberties without being captured first.

Since none of the players can kill the other, the situation is considered settled. The black and white stones are said to be &quot;alive in seki&quot;.

==Caveats==

Groups that are &quot;alive&quot; may yet die. One reason is that they may be sacrificed, in the course of a ko fight.

Another way in which the &quot;ko&quot; rule enters the discussion is through the complications &quot;ko&quot; adds to the classification by status. It is quite possible for a group to be alive in &quot;ko&quot;: that is, the group is &quot;conditionally alive&quot;, the condition being to be able to win a particular &quot;ko&quot; fight relating to the control of a key intersection.

==Dead stones==

Virtually all games will have at least a few dead stones, which remain on the board at the end of the game, when both players pass. Those dead stones are then removed, in an operation often called &#x27;cleaning&#x27;, which is a separate phase of the game. The stones removed are treated exactly like other captured stones. Under Chinese rules, which use area counting, stones removed during the cleaning phase are returned to their bowls.

It is a novice mistake to carry out the capture of dead stones before it is of tactical importance to do so. Such plays, during the game, waste a turn and may also cost points.

Single stones and small groups are often sacrificed. In cases where a group is more than of sacrificial value, that group typically must &quot;make life&quot; in order for one to have a chance at winning the overall game.

Generally each side will have at most 4-5 living groups on the board at the end of the game. There is a go proverb that says that &quot;Five groups may live, but the sixth will die&quot; which in a nutshell describes the need to emphasise connection between developing groups. The struggle for life can be solved by connection. Since each group needs two eyes, (and eyes are sometimes hard to come by) the alternative is to connect out to another group, thereby sharing both liberties and eyes.

== &quot;Aji&quot; ==
Even if a group is lost, one can still use one&#x27;s own dead stones for aji (potential). Ko threats are just one way in which apparently dead stones are put to good use. Expert players use a variety of &#x27;squeezing&#x27; tactics, of which &quot;semedori&quot;, an advanced endgame technique, and &quot;shibori&quot; are two that have recognised Japanese-language names.

Royal Caribbean International (RCI), formerly Royal Caribbean Cruise Line (RCCL), is a cruise line founded in 1968 in Norway and organized as a wholly owned subsidiary of Royal Caribbean Group since 1997. 

Based in Miami, Florida, it is the largest cruise line by revenue and second largest by passenger counts. In 2018, Royal Caribbean International controlled 19.2% of the worldwide cruise market by passengers and 14.0% by revenue.

 the line operates 28 ships; four additional ships are on order and two ships are planned but do not have a launch date.&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

==History==

Royal Caribbean Cruise Line was founded in 1968 by three Norwegian shipping companies: Anders Wilhelmsen &amp; Company, I.M. Skaugen &amp; Company, and Gotaas Larsen. The newly created line put its first ship, &quot;Song of Norway&quot;, into service two years later. A year later, the line added &quot;Nordic Prince&quot; to the fleet and in 1972 it added &quot;Sun Viking&quot;. In 1978, &quot;Song of Norway&quot; became Royal Caribbean&#x27;s first passenger ship to be lengthened. This was accomplished via the insertion of an section to the vessel&#x27;s severed center. Following the success of this work, &quot;Nordic Prince&quot; was also stretched in 1980. During the stretching of both ships, their sterns were modified to create more open space. In 1982, Royal Caribbean launched &quot;Song of America&quot;.
In 1986, Royal Caribbean leased a coastal property in Labadie, Haiti, to be used as a private destination for its guests, renamed as Labadee. After a corporate restructuring in 1988, the line launched &quot;Sovereign of the Seas&quot;, the largest passenger vessel afloat at the time. That same year, Royal Caribbean also merged with Admiral Cruises. Two years later in 1990, &quot;Nordic Empress&quot; and &quot;Viking Serenade&quot; entered service and Royal Caribbean purchased a second private destination, Little Stirrup Cay, an island in the Bahamas, which they branded as CocoCay.
The second and third s &quot;Monarch of the Seas&quot; and &quot;Majesty of the Seas&quot; were delivered in 1991 and 1992 respectively.

Royal Caribbean went public on the New York Stock Exchange in 1993. 

=== Reorganization and renaming ===
In 1997, it merged with the Greek cruise line Celebrity Cruises and changed its name from Royal Caribbean Cruise Line to Royal Caribbean International. At the same time, Royal Caribbean Group was formed as Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. to serve as a holding company that owned both Celebrity Cruises and Royal Caribbean International. 

In 2000, Royal Caribbean operated a series of land-and-sea-based &quot;cruise tours&quot; in Alaska, featuring glass-domed train cars to scenic destinations within the state and Canada. Over the next two years, they also introduced cruise tours to destinations throughout Europe.

An even larger class, the &quot;&quot;Oasis&quot; class&quot;, featuring &quot;Oasis of the Seas&quot; and &quot;Allure of the Seas&quot;, was launched in 2009 and 2010, guaranteeing Royal Caribbean the ship size lead for years to come. In December 2012, Royal Caribbean announced that they had ordered a third &quot;Oasis&quot;-class cruise ship from STX France, which would be larger than the previous ships in the class. In March 2014, Royal Caribbean announced that they had ordered a fourth Oasis-Class ship from STX France.

In February 2013, Royal Caribbean announced the first two ships of their newest &quot;Quantum&quot; class, &quot;Quantum of the Seas&quot; and &quot;Anthem of the Seas&quot;, which were being built at the Meyer Werft shipyard. In May of that year, Royal Caribbean announced that they had signed a contract for a third &quot;Quantum&quot;-class ship for delivery in mid-2016.

In September 2014, Royal Caribbean announced that the third &quot;Quantum&quot;-class ship would be named &quot;Ovation of the Seas&quot;, and in February 2015 they announced that the third &quot;Oasis&quot;-class ship would be named &quot;Harmony of the Seas&quot;.

In March 2015, Royal Caribbean announced that they had agreed to sell &quot;Splendour of the Seas&quot; to TUI Cruises in the second quarter of 2016.

In June 2016, Royal Caribbean announced that they had agreed to sell &quot;Legend of the Seas&quot; to TUI Cruises in the second quarter of 2017.

The company lobbies in various jurisdictions in which it operates. In the United States of America, lobbying expenditure records are held by the Senate Office of Public Records. In South Australia, the company is represented by lobbying company Richardson Coutts Pty Ltd.

In 2017, Royal Caribbean agreed to use Port Everglades as a preferred berth for its &quot;Oasis&quot; class ships. The new agreement extended the past contract with Port Everglades until 2026, contingent upon a $100 million remodeling of Cruise Terminal 25, and approved by the Broward County Board of County Commissioners.

In December 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Royal Caribbean suspended sailings across its fleet. It also sold &quot;Empress of the Seas&quot; and &quot;Majesty of the Seas&quot;, with the former going to Cordelia Cruises. , its first and only ship to resume sailing was &quot;Quantum of the Seas&quot;, which began sailing from Singapore in December 2020 under health and safety regulations formulated by the Singapore government.

On 29 June 2021, Royal Caribbean International&#x27;s &quot;Ovation of the Seas&quot; became the first cruise ship to return to the Port of Seattle since the COVID-19 Pandemic began.

=== Partnerships/capabilities ===
In August 2022, the company announced that it would partner with SpaceX to use its Starlink technology across all its ships, in an effort to improve historically weak internet connections. This comes on the heels of the Federal Communications Commission authorizing SpaceX to provide its services to boats, planes, and trucks.

==Fleet==
=== Current fleet ===
Since &quot;Sovereign of the Seas&quot; entered service in 1987, all subsequent Royal Caribbean ships have names ending with the phrase &quot;of the Seas&quot;.

====&quot;Vision&quot; class====
The &quot;Vision&quot; class consists of three pairs of sister ships. &quot;Legend&quot; and &quot;Splendour&quot;, built at Chantiers de l&#x27;Atlantique, Saint-Nazaire, France have a gross tonnage of approximately 70,000. &quot;Grandeur&quot; and &quot;Enchantment&quot; were built at Kvaerner Masa-Yards, Helsinki, Finland and had an original tonnage of approximately . The final pair, &quot;Rhapsody&quot; and &quot;Vision&quot; were also built at Chantiers de l&#x27;Atlantique, and have a tonnage of . In 2005, a midsection was added to &quot;Enchantment of the Seas&quot;, bringing its tonnage to over . All ships of this class feature over of glass. Royal Caribbean sold both &quot;Splendour of the Seas&quot; and &quot;Legend of the Seas&quot; to Marella Cruises. &quot;Splendour of the Seas&quot; last sailed for Royal Caribbean on 4 April 2016, and the final &quot;Legend of the Seas&quot; sailing for Royal Caribbean left port on 13 March 2017. In October 2019, Royal Caribbean announced a plan to transfer &quot;Grandeur of the Seas&quot; to Pullmantur Cruises after its last scheduled sailing on 21 March 2021. However, following Pullmantur&#x27;s filing for bankruptcy, Royal Caribbean later announced in August 2020 that &quot;Grandeur&quot; would remain in Royal Caribbean&#x27;s fleet.

====&quot;Voyager&quot; class====
The &quot;Voyager&quot;-class ships were the largest class of cruise ships in the world when constructed, were the first ships to have an ice rink at sea and the first to have Royal Caribbean&#x27;s &quot;Royal Promenade&quot; concept, a main thoroughfare extending most of the length of the ship, flanked by bars, cafes, and shopping venues. They were built at Kvaerner Masa-Yards&#x27; (now Meyer Turku) facility in Turku, Finland. They have a gross tonnage of around 137,000 tonnes. Activity options onboard all five ships include a basketball court, at least three pools, a mini-golf course, a rock wall, an ice skating rink and, originally, an inline skating track. &quot;Navigator of the Seas&quot; replaced the inline skating track with a Flowrider surf simulator in 2014, and similar changes are planned for &quot;Voyager&quot; and &quot;Explorer&quot;.

&quot;Navigator of the Seas&quot; and &quot;Mariner of the Seas&quot; are second-generation &quot;Voyager&quot;-class vessels, and feature glass stateroom balconies that extend out from the superstructure of the ship and a larger Windjammer buffet area.

====&quot;Radiance&quot; class====

All &quot;Radiance&quot;-class ships have a gross tonnage of 90,090 and environmentally friendlier gas turbine engines. The &quot;Radiance&quot;-class ships have over of glass, glass exterior viewing elevators, over 700 balcony staterooms, two-level glass windowed dining rooms, alternative restaurants, a retractable glass roof over a pool, an outdoor pool, as well as the first self-leveling billiard tables at sea. The &quot;Radiance&quot; class ships were constructed at Meyer Werft, Papenburg, Germany. Unlike the preceding &quot;Voyager&quot; class, these ships are built to the Panamax form factor, allowing them to pass through the Panama Canal.

====&quot;Freedom&quot; class====

The &quot;Freedom&quot;-class ships are lengthened versions of the second-generation &quot;Voyager&quot;-class ship, and contain a Royal Promenade mall running much of the length of the ship, an ice skating rink, basketball court, several pools, a mini-golf course, and a rock wall. New features on the &quot;Freedom&quot; class include the FlowRider surfing simulator, the H2O Zone kids water play area, a boxing ring, and hot tubs cantilevered over the side of the ship. At 154,407 gross tons, the &quot;Freedom&quot;-class ships were the largest ships in the world from 2006, until the debut of the Oasis class in 2009. 

====&quot;Oasis&quot; class====

The &quot;Oasis&quot;-class ships are some of the largest passenger ships ever built, having surpassed the &quot;Freedom&quot;-class ships, and are surpassed only by the Icon-class ships. They can accommodate up to 5,400 passengers at double occupancy and they have a maximum capacity of 6,296 passengers. Furthermore, the ships have a gross tonnage of at least 225,282 tons, and cost the line around US$1.4 billion each.
The first two ships in the class, &quot;Oasis of the Seas&quot; and &quot;Allure of the Seas&quot;, were delivered in 2009 and 2010 by STX Europe Turku Shipyard, Finland. The third and fourth ships in the class, &quot;Harmony of the Seas&quot; and &quot;Symphony of the Seas&quot; were built at Chantiers de l&#x27;Atlantique in Saint-Nazaire, France. They were the first to come with the Ultimate Abyss dry slide. Royal Caribbean International, in conjunction with USA Today, sponsored a contest to name the first two vessels. In February 2019, Royal Caribbean announced the order of a 6th Oasis class vessel, later named &quot;Utopia of the Seas&quot;, from Chantiers de l&#x27;Atlantique for delivery in 2024 with a double occupancy of 5,714 and gross tonnage of 231,000.
====&quot;Quantum&quot; class====

The &quot;Quantum&quot;-class of ships debuted as the second largest class of cruise ships in the world. The &quot;Quantum&quot;-class ships were the first ships built for Royal Caribbean by Meyer Werft since the &quot;Radiance&quot; class and share many features with those ships, including indoor pools with retractable roofs, vast expanses of glass, outdoor seating in the &quot;Windjammer&quot; buffet, and self-leveling pool tables. Other distinctive features of the &quot;Quantum&quot;-class include the &quot;North Star&quot; observation capsule mounted on the end of a crane arm, &quot;RipCord by iFLY&quot; a skydiving simulator, the three-deck-high Two70° lounge and performance venue at the aft of the ship featuring panoramic windows that convert into projection screens, and the multi-purpose SeaPlex facility which hosts activities such as basketball, roller skating, bumper cars, and a trapeze school. The &quot;Quantum&quot; class was the first class designed specifically for Dynamic Dining, and feature several separate complementary dining facilities instead of a single main dining room. Each venue will maintain the same menu and staff throughout the cruise. Unlike the earlier &quot;Voyager&quot;, &quot;Freedom&quot;, and &quot;Oasis&quot; class, &quot;Quantum&quot;-class ships do not feature a Viking Crown Lounge or ice skating rink, and the Royal Esplanade mall down the center of the ship is not featured in the traditional form of Royal Promenades.

Five ships, &quot;Quantum of the Seas&quot;, &quot;Anthem of the Seas&quot;, &quot;Ovation of the Seas&quot;, &quot;Spectrum of the Seas&quot;, and &quot;Odyssey of the Seas&quot; were built as of 2021.

====&quot;Icon&quot; class====

On 10 October 2016, Royal Caribbean and Meyer Turku announced an order to build two ships under the project name &quot;Icon&quot;. On 2 July 2019, Royal Caribbean announced an order for a third ship in the &quot;Icon&quot; class.

&quot;Icon&quot; class ships are the largest cruise ships ever constructed. The ships will be powered by liquefied natural gas (LNG), with a gross tonnage of about 250,800 GT. Ships will contain other alternative energy features, like the use of fuel cells to produce electricity and fresh water.

&quot;Icon of the Seas&quot; was delivered on 27 November 2023, and the second ship, &quot;Star of the Seas&quot;, is expected to be delivered in 2025. The third ship, &quot;Legend of the Seas&quot;, is planned to be delivered in 2026, one year after &quot;Star of the Seas&quot;.

In August 2024 an order for a fourth ship to be delivered in 2027 was announced and planned two additional ships.

===Future fleet===

A new class of smaller ships, to be named Discovery class, is planned, but not ordered yet.

==Incidents and controversies==

As of 2008, Royal Caribbean had 22% of the market share in cruise line operation. Cruise line operators are criticized for using this large economic impact to cut deals with home ports, ports of call, and agencies.

=== Norovirus outbreaks ===
In January 2014, an outbreak of norovirus aboard &quot;Explorer of the Seas&quot; sickened 689 of 4,237 passengers and crew (16.3%), causing the ship to return to port two days early. The outbreak reportedly marked the greatest number of cases of illness aboard a cruise ship in two decades, barely exceeding a 2006 outbreak aboard the Carnival Cruise Lines&#x27; &quot;Carnival Liberty&quot; that sickened 679 of 3,970 passengers and crew (17.1%). Royal Caribbean offered all passengers aboard that cruise a 50% refund of their cruise fare, an additional 50% (plus 10% for each day sick passengers were quarantined) of their cruise fare as a credit towards another cruise, and reimbursed extra travel expenses for guests returning home early.

===Docking in Haiti===
In the aftermath of the 2010 Haiti earthquake, Royal Caribbean continued docking cruise ships at the Labadee resort, located approximately 60 miles from the epicenter of the earthquake, during the ongoing humanitarian crisis. Royal Caribbean vice president John Weis defended the decision, citing relief supplies delivered through the ships and proceeds from the call going towards relief efforts. The decision to continue docking was criticized nonetheless and created concern among passengers.

===George Allen Smith case===

On 5 July 2005, passengers on board &quot;Brilliance of the Seas&quot; reported what appeared to be blood on a part of the ship below the passenger balconies. After a search, George Allen Smith was discovered to be missing and thought to have fallen overboard. A criminal investigation into possible foul play was conducted, and a brief press release on the company&#x27;s investor relations website announced the settlement of the case, later revealed to be more than $1 million.

===Environmental record===
In 1998 and 1999, the company was fined US$9 million because one of its ships, &quot;Sovereign of the Seas&quot;, had repeatedly dumped oily waste into the ocean and tried to hide this using false records, including fake piping diagrams given to the U.S. Coast Guard. Because the company was and is incorporated in Liberia, Royal Caribbean argued that this case was not in the jurisdiction of U.S. courts. Despite their argument, they were unsuccessful.

===Whakaari / White Island eruption===

On 9 December 2019, a volcanic eruption occurred killing 21 people from . It occurred on New Zealand&#x27;s Whakaari / White Island while &quot;Ovation&quot; was docked in the nearby Port of Tauranga. Despite an increase in seismic activity in preceding weeks, 47 people (including 38 passengers and crew from the ship) were on the island when it erupted. , 44 of the 47 were injured, missing, or killed. A Royal Caribbean spokesperson said the line was &quot;devastated by today’s events&quot;, and the ship remained in port until 10 December to assist with recovery efforts. In April 2020, legal action was commenced in Australia on behalf of relatives and &quot;Ovation&quot; passengers against Royal Caribbean.

=== Death of Chloe Rae Margaret Wiegand ===

On 7 July 2019, 18-month-old Chloe Rae Margaret Wiegand was dropped to her death from an open window by her grandfather Salvatore Anello on while docked in San Juan, Puerto Rico. He was later arrested on counts of homicide by authorities in Puerto Rico. The family attempted to file a civil suit against Royal Caribbean claiming that Anello did not know the window was open. Royal Caribbean later released several videos from surveillance cameras showing this incident. As of 25 February 2020, Anello took a plea deal with authorities. However, the civil lawsuit was still approved by a judge.

=== COVID-19 pandemic ===
During the COVID-19 pandemic, the &quot;Miami Herald&quot; reported that, after cruises were cancelled worldwide and they had disembarked all passengers, Royal Caribbean Cruises had refused to repatriate many of their crew members due to the associated costs, with many crew members turning to desperate measures, such as hunger strikes, as a result.

As part of the Cruise Line International Association (CLIA), Royal Caribbean paused its global sailing operations through 30 April 2021.

On 16 June 2021, Royal Caribbean International announced that it was delaying the inaugural sailing of their newest cruise liner, &quot;Odyssey of the Seas&quot; after eight crew members tested positive for SARS-CoV-2–COVID-19. Six of the crew members were without showing signs of symptoms while the other two were experiencing mild symptoms of the disease. The delay was extended until 31 July 2021.

<doc id="756765" wikidata="Q994473" url="?curid=756765" title="Thelarche">
<text>Thelarche, also known as breast budding, is the onset of secondary breast development, often representing the beginning of pubertal development. It is the stage at which male and female breasts differentiate due to variance in hormone levels; however, some males have a condition in which they develop breasts, termed gynecomastia. Thelarche typically occurs between the ages of 8 and 13 years with significant variation between individuals. However, the initial growth of breast tissue occurs during fetal development. It is usually the first sign of puberty in females (less commonly, it can be the second sign, after pubarche).

Usually, females experience menarche about two years after thelarche has begun, with complete breast development from thelarche to adult breasts, taking between 2 and 4 years but can last up to age 18. Moreover, puberty is considered delayed if breast development does not start at age 13 or if a female has not had her first period (menarche) within three years of thelarche. Additionally, secondary breast development occurring before the age of 7 years could be a sign of premature thelarche or precocious puberty. Of note, for some girls, thelarche will occur, with subsequent regression of breast development, and then months or years later, normal breast growth will commence again accompanied by normal pubertal changes; this is termed transient thelarche.

Pubertal changes, including breast development, are assessed using the Tanner Scale (Sexual Maturity Rating Scale) where stage 1 is before, stage 2 is the breast budding or thelarche stage, stages 3 and 4 are continual breast growth and areolar development, and stage 5 signifies completion of development. This system does not use breast size but instead examines the shape of breasts, nipples, and areolae to determine the progression of growth.

Various hormones interact and result in the changes seen during thelarche. The growth and accumulation of adipose tissue in the breasts are induced by estrogen, while the development of mammary glands and areolae are caused by progesterone; both estrogen and progesterone are produced by ovaries. Due to change in hormone levels, young breasts are likely to develop asymmetrically, and in many cases, adult breasts will remain unequal in size or shape.

== Epidemiology and trends ==
The age of thelarche has been decreasing in the past few decades. Between 1973 and 2013, the age of thelarche decreased at a rate of 0.24 years per decade. Other contemporary trends that may be contributing to this change in the onset of thelarche include increasing BMI, changes in pubertal timing, and environmental exposures. Studies also indicate associations between the average age of thelarche and race. The average age of thelarche for African American females in the United States is between 8.9 and 9.5 years, the average for Caucasians is 10–10.4 years, and the average age of thelarche for Hispanic females is approximately 9.8 years. Additionally, in African American and Mexican American girls, breast development may occur earlier than in other ethnic cohorts and can be normal in the 7th year of age. Due to the decreasing age of thelarche over time, there is discussion of adjusting the cutoff for early thelarche to 7 years old for white females and six years old for black females.

Furthermore, there have been associations between obesity, chemical contaminants, and the earlier average age of thelarche. Studies have shown that obesity is associated with an earlier average age of thelarche. Moreover, the prevalence of premature thelarche has been increasing over the past several years which many attribute to pesticides. Experimental data indicate the impact of chemical contaminants in gestation and puberty, with the chemical such as phthalates having a high association with premature thelarche frequency.

== Premature thelarche ==

Premature thelarche is a benign condition in which a young female has breast development before age eight without any accompanied pubertal changes. Individuals undergoing isolated premature thelarche do not experience menstruation, pubic hair growth (pubarche), or the bone growth characteristic of puberty. Initial breast development can be bilateral or unilateral and usually begins with a firm, disc-like area of tissue under the areola, which can be mistaken for a mass but is almost always a normal physiologic process. The breast is often tender, and palpation is sometimes painful, but breast discharge is absent. Usually, the breasts do not develop past stage 3 on the Tanner Scale, hence maintaining adolescent nipples. Moreover, in 90% of patients with isolated premature thelarche, breast enlargement will resolve six months to 6 years after diagnosis.

The most common age for females to develop isolated premature thelarche is between 0 and 2 years, with a prevalence rate between 2.2 and 4.7 percent of all female infants. The breasts of these females typically exhibit alternating progression and regression patterns of growth in 6-week intervals, often completely decreasing in size within 1.5 years. Due to the benign nature of the condition and the tendency to self-resolve, premature thelarche does not require treatment. However, premature thelarche should be evaluated to rule out additional causes, such as hypothyroidism or precocious puberty, especially if other symptoms are present. Such evaluations will typically involve serial examinations and radiographs.

== Precocious puberty ==
Precocious puberty is a condition where children undergo puberty before seven or eight years. Precocious puberty differs from premature thelarche in that the individual experiences additional aspects of puberty, including menarche, adrenarche, pubarche, vaginal discharge, and bone growth, while the sole presence of early thelarche identifies premature thelarche. Though premature thelarche and precocious puberty are distinct conditions, there is some overlap; an estimated 14 to 18 percent of females who exhibit premature thelarche will additionally develop precocious puberty. Precocious puberty can be identified using a pelvic ultrasound to assess the size of ovaries and uterus relative to the individual&#x27;s age. Other methods of diagnosis consist of blood tests to determine hormone levels and simple physician assessments with follow-up appointments to track the progression of development.

== Thelarche variant ==
The thelarche variant, also named exaggerated thelarche, is an intermediate condition between premature thelarche and precocious puberty. This condition resembles premature thelarche without the cyclic waxing and waning of breast growth. Pubic hair growth (pubarche) and advanced bone growth are often present in the thelarche variant. Yet, this growth does not result in complete sexual maturity as occurs with precocious puberty.

<text>Star of the Sea College is an independent, Catholic, day school for girls, located in Brighton, an inner south-eastern suburb of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.

Established in 1883 by the Presentation Sisters, the college has a non-selective enrolment policy, and currently caters for approximately 1,000 female students from Years 7 to 12.

Star of the Sea is affiliated with the Association of Heads of Independent Schools of Australia (AHISA), the Alliance of Girls&#x27; Schools Australasia (AGSA), and is a founding member of Girls Sport Victoria (GSV).

==History==
Star of the Sea College was founded by the Presentation Sisters in March 1883. The sisters were asked to come to Australia from Ireland by Father James Corbett, and after establishing the first Presentation Convent and school in Victoria at Windsor (now Presentation College Windsor), they moved to Gardenvale (then known as Elsternwick). The Presentation Sisters from Wagga Wagga in New South Wales, established Star of the Sea College.

The foundresses, Mother John Byrne and Mother Paul Fay, named the school after Our Lady, &#x27;Star of the Sea&#x27; when they moved into a house called &quot;Turret Lodge&quot;, which had a clear view of a local bay.

==Principals==
==House system==
The school has four houses through which students engage in inter-house competition and other activities. The house system dates back to the 1930s, when principal Mother Angela Johnston formed Nagle (blue), named after founder of the Presentation Sisters Nano Nagle, and Stella (red), named for the Latin word for &quot;star&quot;. Two additional houses were created in 1948: Ave (yellow) draws its name from the Latin word (in reference to &quot;Ave Maria&quot;), and Fay (green) is named for one of the school&#x27;s two founders, Mother Paul Fay. Each house has its own crest which symbolises the spirit of the house. From years 10 to 12 students participate in a vertical homeroom system in which students from the same house are grouped together to encourage house spirit.

== Sport ==
Star of the Sea is a member of Girls Sport Victoria (GSV).

==ANZAC==

Named for the Australian war veterans once housed there, ANZAC is Star of the Sea&#x27;s Year 9 campus. Located in the Kamesburgh Gardens on North Road, Brighton, the forty-room mansion was built in 1874 and presented as a gift to the Repatriation Department in 1919. It served for a time as ANZAC Hostel before the aged care home relocated to an updated facility in 1996. The mansion was then leased by the college, and opened as a Year 9 campus in 1997.

ANZAC retains a close relationship with the hostel, participating in Remembrance Day ceremonies and a &quot;Companions Program&quot; which allows students to engage in weekly visits with the hostel&#x27;s residents.

The campus has its own system of four houses, each of which are named after well-known battles or military campaigns fought by Australian soldiers: Kokoda, Gallipoli, Long Tan and Tobruk.

==Stacella==
Stacella is the name of the college&#x27;s a cappella choir. Founded in 1996, Stacella is composed of over 120 students from years 7 to 12, and has performed for primary schools, nursing homes, local festivals, service organisations and corporate clients. The choir holds an annual concert, in which all students perform the repertoire they have learnt during the year. As well as five tours to New Zealand and a trip Fiji, to date, the choir has also released five CDs.

==Student-exchange programs==
The school has a student exchange program for German, Italian and Japanese students. Every year girls who are learning a language in the senior years get the opportunity to be part of the student exchange program. Students in years 10 and 11 also are able to go on a study tour to either Italy or Japan.

<doc id="756772" wikidata="Q586994" url="?curid=756772" title="Lennie Tristano">
<text>Leonard Joseph Tristano (March 19, 1919 – November 18, 1978) was an American jazz pianist, composer, arranger, and teacher of jazz improvisation.

Tristano studied for bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees in music in Chicago before moving to New York City in 1946. He played with leading bebop musicians and formed his own small bands, which soon displayed some of his early interests – contrapuntal interaction of instruments, harmonic flexibility, and rhythmic complexity. His quintet in 1949 recorded the first free group improvisations. Tristano&#x27;s innovations continued in 1951, with the first overdubbed, improvised jazz recordings, and two years later, when he recorded an atonal improvised solo piano piece that was based on the development of motifs rather than on harmonies. He developed further via polyrhythms and chromaticism into the 1960s, but was infrequently recorded.

Tristano started teaching music, especially improvisation, in the early 1940s, and by the mid-1950s was concentrating on teaching in preference to performing. He taught in a structured and disciplined manner, which was unusual in jazz education when he began. His educational role over three decades meant that he exerted an influence on jazz through his students, including saxophonists Lee Konitz and Warne Marsh.

Musicians and critics vary in their appraisal of Tristano as a musician. Some describe his playing as cold and suggest that his innovations had little impact; others state that he was a bridge between bebop and later, freer forms of jazz, and assert that he is less appreciated than he should be because commentators found him hard to categorize and because he chose not to commercialize.

==Early life==
Tristano was born in Chicago on March 19, 1919. His mother, Rose Tristano (née Malano), was also born in Chicago. His father, Michael Joseph Tristano, was born in Italy and moved to the United States as a child. Lennie was the second of four brothers.

Lennie started on the family&#x27;s player piano at the age of two or three. He had classical piano lessons when he was eight, but indicated later that they had hindered, rather than helped, his development. He was born with weak eyesight, possibly as a consequence of his mother being affected by the 1918–19 flu pandemic during pregnancy. A bout of measles when aged six may have exacerbated his condition, and by the age of nine or ten he was totally blind as a result of glaucoma. He initially went to standard state schools, but attended the Illinois School for the Blind in Jacksonville for a decade from around 1928. During his school days he played several instruments, including saxophones, trumpet, guitar, and drums. At the age of eleven he had his first gigs, playing clarinet in a brothel.

Tristano studied for a bachelor&#x27;s degree in music in performance at the American Conservatory of Music in Chicago from 1938 until 1941, and stayed for another two years for further studies, although he left before completing his master&#x27;s degree. One of his aunts assisted Tristano by taking notes for him at university.

==Later life and career==

===1940s===
In the early 1940s Tristano played tenor saxophone and piano for a variety of engagements, including in a rumba band. He began giving private music lessons at around the same time, including to saxophonist Lee Konitz. From 1943 Tristano also taught at the Axel Christensen School of Popular Music. He first received press coverage for his piano playing in early 1944, appearing in &quot;Metronome&quot;″s summary of music in Chicago from that year, and then in &quot;Down Beat&quot; from 1945. He recorded with some musicians from Woody Herman&#x27;s band in 1945; Tristano&#x27;s playing on these tracks &quot;is characterized by his extended harmonies, fast single-line runs, and block chords.&quot; He also recorded solo piano pieces in the same year. Tristano also married in 1945; his wife was Judy Moore, a musician who sang to his piano accompaniment in Chicago in the mid-1940s.

Tristano&#x27;s interest in jazz inspired a move to New York City in 1946. As a preliminary step to moving there, he stayed in Freeport, Long Island, where he played in a restaurant with Arnold Fishkind (bass) and Billy Bauer (guitar). This trio, with an assortment of bassists replacing Fishkind, was recorded in 1946–47. Reviewers at the time commented on the originality of the piano–guitar counterpoint and the trio&#x27;s approach to harmony. Gunther Schuller later described one of their recordings as &quot;too far ahead of its time&quot; in its harmonic freedom and rhythmic complexity.

Tristano met saxophonist Charlie Parker in 1947. They played together in bands that included bebop musicians Dizzy Gillespie and Max Roach later that year for radio broadcasts. The pianist reported that Parker enjoyed his playing, in part because it was different from what Parker was accustomed to and did not copy the saxophonist&#x27;s style. In 1948 Tristano played less often in clubs, and added Konitz and a drummer to his regular band, making it into a quintet. This band recorded the first sides for the New Jazz label, which later became Prestige Records. Later that year Warne Marsh, another saxophonist student of Tristano&#x27;s, was added to the group.

Tristano&#x27;s band had two recording sessions in 1949 that proved to be significant. The sextet recorded original compositions, including his &quot;Wow&quot; and &quot;Crosscurrent&quot;, that were based on familiar harmonies; reviewers commented on the linearity of the playing and its departure from bebop. Without a drummer, the other musicians also recorded the first free improvisations by a group – &quot;Intuition&quot; and &quot;Digression&quot;. For these tracks, the sequence in which the musicians would join in the ensemble playing, and the approximate timing of those entrances, were planned, but nothing else – harmony, key, time signature, tempo, melody or rhythm – was prepared or set. Instead, the five musicians were held together by contrapuntal interaction. Both tracks were praised by critics, although their release was delayed – &quot;Intuition&quot; was released late in 1950, and &quot;Digression&quot; not until 1954. Parker and composer Aaron Copland were also impressed. Numerous other musicians of the time, however, thought Tristano&#x27;s music too progressive and emotionally cold, and predicted that it would not be popular with the public.

The sextet struggled to find enough work, but did play at Birdland&#x27;s opening night &quot;A Journey Through Jazz&quot;, a subsequent five-week engagement at that club, and at various other venues in the north-east of the US late in 1949. They performed free pieces in these concerts, as well as Bach fugues, but found it difficult over time to continue to play with the freedom that they had initially felt.

===1950s===
With occasional personnel changes, the sextet continued performing into 1951. In the same year, the location for Tristano&#x27;s lessons shifted from his home in Flushing, Queens to a Manhattan loft property, part of which he had converted into a recording studio. This also served as the location for frequent jam sessions with various invited musicians. The address became the title of one of his compositions – &quot;317 East 32nd Street&quot;. At around the same time, Tristano started a record label named Jazz Records. It released &quot;Ju-ju&quot; and &quot;Pastime&quot; on a 45 record in 1952, before Tristano abandoned the project because of time demands and distribution problems. The two tracks were from a trio session with bassist Peter Ind and drummer Roy Haynes, and contained overdubbed second piano parts added later by Tristano. Ind described them as the first improvised, overdubbed recordings in jazz. Early reviewers largely failed to realize that overdubbing had been used. Tristano&#x27;s recording studio remained in use, and was the scene of early sessions for Debut Records, co-founded by Roach and bassist Charles Mingus.

In 1952 Tristano&#x27;s band performed occasionally, including as a quintet in Toronto. In the summer of that year, Konitz joined Stan Kenton&#x27;s band, breaking up the core of Tristano&#x27;s long-standing quintet/sextet, although the saxophonist did on occasion play with Tristano again.

Tristano&#x27;s 1953 recording &quot;Descent into the Maelstrom&quot; was another innovation. It was a musical portrayal of Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s story of the same title, and was an improvised solo piano piece that used multitracking and had no preconceived harmonic structure, being based instead on the development of motifs. Its atonality anticipated the much later work of pianists such as Cecil Taylor and Borah Bergman.

In the following year Tristano&#x27;s sextet played at the first Newport Jazz Festival. This may have been his only jazz festival appearance – he considered them to be too commercial. Marsh left the band in the summer of 1955.

Tristano recorded his first album for Atlantic Records in 1955; he was allowed control over the recording process and what to release. The eponymous album included solo and trio tracks that contained further experiments with multitracking (&quot;Requiem&quot; and &quot;Turkish Mambo&quot;) and altered tape-speed (&quot;Line Up&quot; and &quot;East 32nd&quot;). The use of overdubbing and tape manipulation was controversial with some critics and musicians at the time. &quot;Requiem&quot;, a tribute to Parker, who had died a short time earlier, has a deep blues feeling – a style not usually associated with Tristano. For &quot;Line Up&quot; and &quot;East 32nd&quot;, Tristano&#x27;s &quot;use of chromatic harmony ... secures him a position of a pioneer in expanding the harmonic vocabulary of jazz improvisation&quot;, in biographer Eunmi Shim&#x27;s words.

By the mid-1950s Tristano focused his energies more on music education. In 1956 he had to leave his Manhattan studio; he established a new one in Hollis, Queens. Some of his core students moved to California after Tristano&#x27;s base was relocated. This, coupled with a separation from his wife in the same year due to his infidelity, meant that he was physically more isolated from the New York music scene. He gave fewer concerts than earlier, but in 1958 he had the first of what were sometimes lengthy engagements at New York&#x27;s Half Note Club, after the owners persuaded him to perform, in part by replacing their club&#x27;s Steinway piano with a new Bechstein of Tristano&#x27;s choosing. They later reported that, in the late 1950s and early 1960s, the musicians who were the most popular at their club were John Coltrane, Zoot Sims, and Tristano: &quot;Coltrane brought in the masses, Zoot brought in the musicians and Lennie brought in the intellectuals.&quot; In 1959 Tristano&#x27;s quintet again performed in Toronto, this time at the Famous Door.

===1960s and 1970s===
Tristano&#x27;s second album for Atlantic was recorded in 1961 and released the following year. &quot;The New Tristano&quot;, as was stressed on the album cover, consisted entirely of piano solos and no overdubbing or tape-speed manipulation was employed. The tracks contain left-hand bass lines that provide structure to each performance as well as counterpoint for the right-hand playing; block chords, unclear harmonies and contrasting rhythms also appear. Other solo piano recordings that Tristano made in 1961 were not released until the 1970s.

Tristano and his wife formally divorced in 1962. Their son, Steve, who was born in 1952, met his father only once after their initial 1956 separation. Tristano married again in the early 1960s. His second wife was Carol Miller, one of his students. They had a son, Bud, and two daughters, Tania and Carol. The couple divorced in 1964, and Tristano later lost a custody battle with his ex-wife over the children.

In 1964 the pianist reformed his quintet with Konitz and Marsh for a two-month engagement at the Half Note and performances at the Coq D&#x27;Or in Toronto. The quartet, missing Konitz, played the Cellar Club in Toronto two years later. Tristano played on occasion at the Half Note Club until the mid-1960s, and toured Europe in 1965. His European tour was mainly as a solo pianist, and the playing was in the style of his &quot;The New Tristano&quot; recordings. He performed with Ind and others in concerts in the UK in 1968; they were well received, and Tristano returned the following year. His last public performance in the US was in 1968.

Tristano declined offers to perform in the 1970s; he explained that he did not like to travel, and that the requirement for a career-minded musician to play concerts was not something that he wanted to follow. He continued teaching, and helped to organize concerts for some of his students. Another album, &quot;Descent into the Maelstrom&quot;, was released in the 1970s; it consisted of recordings made between 1951 and 1966.

Tristano had a series of illnesses in the 1970s, including eye pain and emphysema (he smoked for most of his life). On November 18, 1978, he died of a heart attack at home in Jamaica, New York.

==Personality and views on music==
In Ind&#x27;s view, Tristano &quot;was always so gentle, so charming and so quietly spoken that his directness could be unnerving.&quot; This directness was noted by others, including bassist Chubby Jackson, who commented that Tristano had almost no tact and would not worry about being rude or making others feel incompetent. Some of his students described Tristano as domineering, but others indicated that this impression came from his demanding discipline in training and attitude to music.

Writer Barry Ulanov commented in 1946 that Tristano &quot;was not content merely to feel something, ... he had to explore ideas, to experience them, to think them through carefully, thoroughly, logically until he could fully grasp them and then hold on to them.&quot; Tristano criticized the free jazz that began in the 1960s for its lack of musical logic as well as its expression of negative emotions. &quot;If you feel angry with somebody you hit him on the nose – not try to play angry music&quot;, he commented; &quot;Express all that is positive. Beauty is a positive thing.&quot; He expanded on this by distinguishing emotion from feeling, and suggested that playing a particular emotion was egotistical and lacking in feeling.

Tristano also complained about the commercialization of jazz and what he perceived to be the requirement to abandon the artistic part of playing in order to earn a living from performing. Later commentators have suggested that these complaints ignored the freedom that he was given by Atlantic and blamed others for what in many cases were the outcomes of his own career decisions.

==Influences and playing style==
Saxophonists Parker and Lester Young were important influences on Tristano&#x27;s development. Another major figure was pianist Art Tatum: Tristano practiced solo Tatum pieces early in his career, before gradually moving away from this influence in search of his own style. Bebopper Bud Powell also affected Tristano&#x27;s playing and teaching, as he admired the younger pianist&#x27;s articulation and expression.

Tristano&#x27;s advanced grasp of harmony pushed his music beyond the complexities of the contemporary bebop movement: from his early recordings, he sought to develop the use of harmonies that were unusual for that period. His playing has been labeled &quot;cool jazz&quot;, but this fails to capture the range of his playing. Eunmi Shim summarized the changes in Tristano&#x27;s playing during his career:

&quot;Grove Music&quot; commented on some aspects of Tristano&#x27;s style that were different from most modern jazz: &quot;Rather than the irregular accents of bop, Tristano preferred an even rhythmic background against which to concentrate on line and focus his complex changes of time signature. Typically, his solos consisted of extraordinarily long, angular strings of almost even quavers provided with subtle rhythmic deviations and abrasive polytonal effects. He was particularly adept in his use of different levels of double time and was a master of the block-chord style&quot;.

Fellow piano player Ethan Iverson asserted that, &quot;As a pianist, Tristano was in the top tier of technical accomplishment. He was born a prodigy and worked tirelessly to get better.&quot; Tristano &quot;had seemingly small but extremely flexible hands, which could expand to a phenomenal degree&quot;, allowing him to reach large intervals.

==Teaching==
Tristano is regarded as one of the first to teach jazz, particularly improvisation, in a structured way. He taught musicians irrespective of their instrument and structured lessons to meet the needs of each individual. Lessons were typically 15–20 minutes in length. He did not teach the reading of music or the characteristics of different styles of jazz, instead challenging students in ways that would allow them to find and express their own musical feelings, or style.

Foundational elements for a student&#x27;s learning were having a concept of (principally diatonic) scales as music and a basis for harmony. One of the teaching tools often used by Tristano, including for scales, was the metronome. The student set the metronome at or near its slowest setting initially, and gradually increased its speed, allowing a sense of time to develop, along with confidence in placing each note.

Tristano encouraged his students to learn the melodies of jazz standards by singing them, then playing them, before working on playing them in all keys. He also often had his students learn to sing and play the improvised solos of some of the best-known names in jazz, including Parker and Young. Some students first sang solos from a recording slowed to half the normal speed; eventually they learned to sing and play them at normal speed. Tristano stressed that the student was not learning to imitate the artist, but should use the experience to gain insight into the musical feeling conveyed. Such activities stressed the value of ear training, and the idea of feeling being fundamental to musical expression. All of this preceded having the opportunity to improvise during lessons.

==Legacy==
Critics disagree on Tristano&#x27;s importance in jazz history. Max Harrison indicated that the pianist had limited influence outside his own group of affiliated musicians; Robert Palmer, who pointed out that only one of Tristano&#x27;s albums was in print at the time of his death, suggested that he was pivotal in the change from 1940s modern jazz to the freer styles of subsequent decades; and Thomas Albright similarly believed that his improvising prepared and developed new ground in the history of the music.

Elements of Tristano&#x27;s early playing – counterpoint, reharmonizing, and strict time – influenced Miles Davis&#x27; &quot;Birth of the Cool&quot;, and the playing of saxophonist Gerry Mulligan and pianist Dave Brubeck. Tristano&#x27;s early, more feelings-based performances also influenced the style of pianist Bill Evans, who also used overdubbing and multitracking in his own recordings after Tristano had experimented with the techniques. Avant-garde musician Anthony Braxton has often mentioned Tristano and some of his students as influences.

Pianist Mose Allison commented that Tristano and Powell &quot;were the founders of modern piano playing, since nearly everyone was influenced by one or the other of them.&quot; Albright cited Tristano as an influence on the pianists Paul Bley, Andrew Hill, Mal Waldron, and Taylor. After Tristano&#x27;s death, jazz piano increasingly adopted aspects of his early playing, in Ted Gioia&#x27;s view: &quot;younger players were coming to these same end points not because they had listened to Tristano ... but because these developments were logical extensions of the modern jazz idiom.&quot;

In Ind&#x27;s opinion, Tristano&#x27;s legacy &quot;is what he added technically to the jazz vocabulary and his vision of jazz as a serious musical craft&quot;. &quot;Grove Music&quot;″s summary is that &quot;Tristano&#x27;s influence is felt most strongly in the work of his best pupils ... and in his example of high-mindedness and perfectionism, characteristics which presupposed for jazz the highest standards of music as art.&quot; Shim too identified his teaching as part of his legacy: parts of his approach to teaching jazz have become standard practice; and &quot;the sheer number of students he taught, which may easily exceed a thousand&quot;, tied to some of them going on to employ what they learned in their own playing and pedagogy, illustrate his influence. Tristano&#x27;s teaching also affected the art of painter Robert Ryman, who had music lessons with the pianist: Ryman&#x27;s &quot;technique not only parallels music in general but shares the principles of kinesthetic and multisensorial attention to detail that characterized the teaching of Lennie Tristano.&quot;

Shim suggested that the common under-appreciation of Tristano is attributable in part to his style being unusual and too difficult for jazz commentators to categorize. Ind also believed that Tristano&#x27;s reputation became less than was deserved – &quot;He stuck with his convictions and would not commercialize. His dedication, plus the lack of general appreciation by many jazz critics, led inevitably to his being sidelined.&quot;

==Awards==
Tristano was &quot;Metronome&quot;″s musician of the year in 1947. He was elected to &quot;Down Beat&quot;″s Hall of Fame in 1979. In 2013 Tristano was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame for &quot;Crosscurrents&quot;, an album of recordings from 1949. He was added to the Ertegun Hall of Fame in 2015.

<text>&lt;onlyinclude&gt;Celebrity Cruises is a cruise line headquartered in Miami, Florida, and a wholly owned subsidiary of Royal Caribbean Group. Celebrity Cruises was founded in 1988 by the Greece-based Chandris Group, and merged with Royal Caribbean Cruise Line in 1997.&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

==History==

=== Chandris Group (1988–1997) ===

==== Founding and first ship SS &quot;Meridian&quot; ====

Celebrity Cruises was founded in April 1988 as a subsidiary of the Greece-based Chandris Group to operate upmarket cruise ships to Bermuda. Chandris had been involved in cruise traffic since the 1960s, and during the late 1980s the company operated in the United States market under the brand name Chandris Cruises. Chandris Fantasy Cruises targeted the lower end of the cruise passenger market, with fleets consisting of second-hand ocean liners. 

Celebrity Cruises came into existence when, in April 1988, Home Lines, at the time one of the world&#x27;s leading premium cruise lines, was sold to Holland America Line. Home Lines&#x27; ships had held two of the five contracts offered by the Government of Bermuda to cruise lines, giving the ships priority berthing arrangement and unlimited access to sail to the islands in exchange for the ships sailing to Bermuda between April and October each year. Although these contracts were highly valued, Holland America Line withdrew the former Home Lines ships from this service, leaving an opening for two new ships to gain access. Chandris wanted to acquire the contracts, but the Government of Bermuda was only willing to award them to upmarket cruise lines, which Chandris Fantasy Cruises was not.

To gain the Bermuda Government contracts, Chandris created Celebrity Cruises and immediately began negotiating with the Bermuda Government in April 1988. As a result of the negotiations, Celebrity Cruises was awarded the contract for two ships for five years beginning in 1990 To fulfill the contract, Chandris Fantasy Cruises&#x27; was rebuilt at Lloyd Werft, Germany in 1989, re-entering service as the SS &quot;Meridian&quot; for Celebrity Cruises in February 1990.

Celebrity Cruises adopted the Chandris &quot;X,&quot; which was slightly stylized for their logo. The new line advertised itself as a “Luxury Cruising by Design&quot;, with the strategy of offering an upscale product with mass-market pricing. The ships would have refined interiors, destinations and dining, which included a partnership with famed chef Michel Roux, a unique thing for a cruise line at the time. Quoted by then chairman John Chandris, &quot;We will feature comfort and quality, not glitz and glitter.&quot;

==== First new-builds: &quot;Horizon&quot; and &quot;Zenith&quot; ====

Celebrity Cruise&#x27;s second ship &quot;Horizon&quot;, which had been ordered in 1988 as a replacement for in the Chandris Fantasy fleet, was transferred to Celebrity Cruises fleet, entering service in May 1990. It would be the line&#x27;s first purpose-built new build. In late 1990 Celebrity Cruises placed an order for a sister ship of the &quot;Horizon&quot;, delivered in 1992 as .

==== &quot;Century&quot; class debut ====

Celebrity ordered a trio of newbuilds at Meyer Werft, known as the &quot;Century&quot; class, with the first ship, the &quot;Century&quot; debuting in 1996, followed by the &quot;Galaxy&quot; and &quot;Mercury&quot;. These would be the last ships designed under the Chandris family management.

=== Royal Caribbean Group (1997–present) ===
In 1997, the Chandris family sold its interests in Celebrity Cruises to Royal Caribbean Cruise Line, leading to the formation of Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (later Royal Caribbean Group) as a holding company to keep both brands separate and the renaming of Royal Caribbean Cruise Line to Royal Caribbean International. Following the delivery of the &quot;Mercury&quot;, the lines first ship, the &quot;Meridian,&quot; was sold to Singapore-based Sun Cruises.

==== &quot;Millennium&quot; class debut ====

Between 2000 and 2002, Celebrity took delivery of a quartet of new ships, the first gas turbine-powered cruise ships, and aptly named &quot;Millennium&quot;-class ships , , and . The new class of ship introduced a new hull livery, with dark blue hull, gold stripes, and red accents on the mast and funnel. The livery was short Iived, and after a few years, would revert to Celebrity&#x27;s original white hull, dark blue stripe color scheme.
The Celebrity Expeditions sub-brand was launched in 2001 with the acquisition of , a small boutique ship offering specialized cruises around the Galápagos Islands. In 2005, the &quot;Horizon&quot; was transferred to the fleet of Royal Caribbean&#x27;s United Kingdom-based subsidiary Island Cruises. In the same year, the first ship of what was to be named &quot;Solstice&quot; class was ordered from Meyer Werft. By 2007, three more ships of this class were on order.

In 2006, plans were made to transfer and from the fleet of Pullmantur Cruises to Celebrity Cruises under the names of &quot;Celebrity Quest&quot; and &quot;Celebrity Journey&quot;. The ships would have joined the Celebrity Expeditions sub-brand, but in the end the decision was made to form an entirely new line, Azamara Cruises, to operate these ships in 2007. Also, in 2007, the &quot;Zenith&quot; was transferred to Pullmantur Cruises &#x27;in exchange&#x27; for the Azamara ships. Transfer of the &quot;Zenith&quot; also meant the end of Celebrity Cruises&#x27; association with Bermuda for the time being, as no ship was brought in to replace her on the cruises to Bermuda. In April 2010, The &quot;Celebrity Summit&quot; began to reposition yearly to New Jersey to offer cruises to Bermuda.

In 2007–2008, all Celebrity Cruises&#x27; ships were renamed with a &quot;Celebrity&quot; prefix added to the pre-existing ship names.

==== &quot;Solstice&quot; class debut ====
, the first ship in the new &quot;Solstice&quot; class, was delivered to Celebrity on 24 October 2008. In May 2009 &quot;Galaxy&quot; was transferred to the fleet of TUI Cruises, a joint venture between Celebrity Cruises&#x27; owner Royal Caribbean Group and TUI AG and renamed as &quot;Mein Schiff&quot;. Two more &quot;Solstice&quot;-class ships entered service – the in 2009 and the in 2010.

In 2011, was sold by Celebrity fleet to become &quot;Mein Schiff 2&quot; for TUI Cruises. The fourth &quot;Solstice&quot;-class ship the entered service in 2011. The was delivered in 2012.

In 2014, Celebrity Cruises launched a blog called &quot;Catalyst,&quot; which covered travel, fashion, and culture.

In April 2015, Celebrity&#x27;s oldest ship, the , departed the fleet.

==== &quot;Edge&quot; class debut ====

On 4 December 2014, Celebrity Cruises signed a letter of intent for a new class of vessels. The two 2,900-guest, 117,000 GT ships would be developed under the project name EDGE and will build upon the brand&#x27;s &quot;Millennium&quot;-class and &quot;Solstice&quot;-class vessels. The company took delivery of the first &quot;Edge&quot;-class vessel, the , on 31 October 2018, followed by the in 2020, and enlarged stretched &quot;Edge&quot;-class in 2022. The &quot;Edge&quot; class introduced a new livery for the brand, with blue painted hulls that would be incorporated on the rest of the fleet as part of the Celebrity revolution initiative.

In December 2014, Lisa Lutoff-Perlo, a 32-year veteran of Celebrity Cruises, was promoted to president and chief executive officer.

On 14 March 2016, Celebrity Cruises announced the planned acquisition of the Galápagos Islands tour operator Ocean Adventures and its two ships, the 48-guest MV &quot;Eclipse&quot; (now &quot;Celebrity Xperience&quot;) and the 16-guest catamaran MC &quot;Athala II&quot; (now &quot;Celebrity Xploration&quot;). The move expanded Celebrity&#x27;s guest capacity in the Galápagos by 65 percent.

Celebrity Cruises announced on 11 October 2017, that it would perform legal same-sex marriages on its ships while in international waters following the legalization of same-sex marriage in Malta, where most of the Celebrity fleet is registered. The company already hosted same-sex marriages while docked in jurisdictions where they are legal, but the change in Maltese law allowed the company&#x27;s captains to perform legally-recognized marriages while in international waters.

In July 2018, the company announced its intention to invest more than $500 million to refurbish all &quot;Millennium&quot;-class and &quot;Solstice&quot;-class ships in its fleet between 2019 and 2023.

In 2020, due to the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic, sailings were suspended on various dates in various regions. On 12 January 2021, a report indicated that sailings were suspended worldwide &quot;through April 30, including the May 1 transatlantic cruise on Celebrity Apex&quot;. Between May and October 2021, &quot;Europe and transatlantic cruises on &quot;Celebrity Edge&quot; and &quot;Celebrity Constellation&quot; will also be suspended May through Oct. 2021&quot;.

On 19 March 2021, Celebrity Cruises announced that it would be resuming its North American cruises in June, sailing out of St. Maarten and that to board all adults, including crew, will be required to show proof of COVID-19 vaccination. Children were allowed to show evidence of a negative COVID-19 test within 72 hours. On 26 June, &quot;Celebrity Edge&quot; became the first cruise ship to leave the United States with ticketed passengers since March 2020. It set sail from Port Everglades in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.

On 29 August 2022, a tugboat strike caused to delay its departure from the Port of Vancouver by almost 12 hours.

<text>Heinz-Harald Frentzen (; born 18 May 1967) is a German former racing driver, who competed in Formula One from to . Frentzen was runner-up in the Formula One World Drivers&#x27; Championship in with Williams, and won three Grands Prix across 10 seasons.

Born in Mönchengladbach, Frentzen began his racing career aged 12 in karting, winning several titles including the junior direct-drive German Kart Championship. He progressed to junior formulae in 1985, winning several races in Formula Ford before finishing runner-up in the 1989 German Formula Three Championship amidst a title battle with Karl Wendlinger and Michael Schumacher. After three seasons of racing in Japan, Frentzen signed with Sauber in , making his Formula One debut at the . He remained at Sauber—now under Red Bull sponsorship—the following season, achieving his maiden podium at the . After scoring several point finishes in his campaign, Frentzen joined Williams to replace reigning World Champion Damon Hill alongside Jacques Villeneuve. Frentzen achieved his maiden victory at the , taking several podiums as he finished runner-up to Villeneuve after Schumacher&#x27;s collision with him at the last race of the season saw his disqualification from the standings. Williams suffered their first winless season since with the FW20, prompting his departure to Jordan in a swap with Ralf Schumacher. Frentzen achieved further wins at the French and Italian Grands Prix in , finishing third in the World Drivers&#x27; Championship to Mika Häkkinen and Eddie Irvine. After struggling for form in , Frentzen was dropped by Jordan after the 2001 British Grand Prix, swapping with Jean Alesi to join Prost. After Prost went bankrupt at the end of the season, Frentzen spent two seasons with Arrows and Sauber before retiring at the conclusion of , having achieved three wins, two pole positions, six fastest laps and 18 podiums in Formula One.

Outside of Formula One, Frentzen competed full-time in the Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters from 2004 to 2006, as well as competing in the all-star Speedcar Series in both of its seasons. Frentzen entered two editions of the 24 Hours of Le Mans in and , finishing fourth in class at the latter with Aston Martin.

==Early career==
Frentzen was born on 18 May 1967 in the West German city of Mönchengladbach (North Rhine-Westphalia) to Heinrich-Harald Frentzen (1933–2012), a German entrepreneur and his Spanish wife Angela Lladosa (1937–2020). He has two sisters (Sylvia, a theologian, and Sonja, a teacher) and two half-sisters (Samantha, a former student, and Nicole-Nadine). His family was connected to motorsport; his father raced between 1950 and 1957. Frentzen&#x27;s parents divorced when he was eight years old and his father subsequently married Mexican-born Arazelli while Angela returned to Spain.

Frentzen began karting at the age of twelve, after his father brought him his first kart, and made an extraordinarily successful start. In 1981, aged fourteen, Frentzen won the German Junior Kart Championship. Two years later, Frentzen entered the CIK Asia Pacific Championships in Australia driving a Dino although he did not finish. In 1984, he finished runner-up in the 100cc class. He was funded and supported by his father—a funeral director—who also acted as both team boss and head mechanic.

In 1985, Frentzen moved into car racing by entering the German Formula Ford 2000 series. After two seasons in Formula Ford he was runner-up in the 1987 series, despite not participating in all races. Frentzen progressed to German Formula Opel Lotus in 1988 in the Junior Team of former Formula One driver Jochen Mass, who had been impressed by Frentzen&#x27;s performances in Formula Ford. Frentzen was champion of the German series in his first year and his teammate Marco Werner finished third in the championship. He also participated in the Formula Opel Lotus Euroseries, where he finished 6th in the championship, scoring 56 points.

The next step was the German Formula 3 Championship in 1989, where Frentzen competed against many future stars including Michael Schumacher and Karl Wendlinger. At the time, there was a big push by Bernie Ecclestone to have a German driver in the Formula One World Championship, so the ONS (the German National Motorsports committee) decided to support both Frentzen and Schumacher. The ONS put up the reward of a Formula One test to the driver who first would take a victory in a Formula 3 race. This ultimately ended up being Schumacher, in a controversial race at Zeltweg, Austria in which Frentzen claimed Schumacher had forced him off the track; however, Schumacher did not get the Formula One test drive anyway. Karl Wendlinger won the German Formula 3 Championship and Frentzen became joint runner-up with Schumacher (the two finishing on identical points totals).

In 1990, Frentzen entered the International Formula 3000 series driving for Eddie Jordan Racing and was partnered by Eddie Irvine. Frentzen finished the season 16th in the championship, scoring 3 points. In the same year, he also participated in the World Sports Prototype Championship driving a Mercedes-Benz C11 scoring one podium and six points. In 1991, Frentzen continued to drive in International Formula 3000, moving to Vortex Motorsport and scored five points in that year&#x27;s series.

==Formula One==

===Sauber (1994–1996)===
In 1994, Frentzen was given a Formula One drive by Peter Sauber in a Mercedes powered car, as teammate to fellow Mercedes junior Wendlinger, who had made it to F1 in and was in his second year with the team. Frentzen began the year strongly, qualifying fifth for his début in Brazil (albeit spinning off in the race) and scoring his first points with fifth in the Pacific Grand Prix. He was then thrust into the role of &quot;de facto&quot; team leader after Wendlinger crashed during qualifying for the fourth round of the season in Monaco, leaving him with severe head injuries that ruled him out for the remainder of the year. Frentzen had the measure of substitute team-mates Andrea de Cesaris and JJ Lehto, scoring points on three further occasions and finishing thirteenth in the World Drivers&#x27; Championship. A particularly noteworthy performance came in the European Grand Prix at Jerez, where he qualified fifth and ran third in the race. The team&#x27;s decision to run a one-stop refuelling strategy caused his pace to suffer and he slipped back to sixth by the finish.

Sauber&#x27;s performance was not sufficient to keep the partnership with Mercedes alive: the marque moved to McLaren, leaving the team to acquire a supply of Ford V8 engines for the season instead. The engines had powered Michael Schumacher to the World Drivers&#x27; Championship in 1994, but were now completely outpowered by the V10 and V12 engines used by the leading teams. The Sauber C14 chassis was also uncompetitive at the start of the year, but Frentzen produced consistent performances to finish in the points on multiple occasions. The performance of the car improved with development throughout the year, culminating in Frentzen taking the team&#x27;s first podium finish at the Italian Grand Prix and qualifying a season&#x27;s-best fifth in Portugal. He also easily had the measure of his team-mates: first, the returning Wendlinger, who was then replaced by Williams test driver Jean-Christophe Boullion mid-season. Frentzen&#x27;s performance against the latter was particularly significant in the team ultimately signing him to drive for the season. He finished ninth in the World Drivers&#x27; Championship with 15 points.

In , Frentzen was joined by Johnny Herbert and Ford upgraded to a V10 engine configuration, promising more power. The unit was still lacking in performance compared to the top teams, and was also less reliable than the trusty V8 had been the previous season. Frentzen was therefore limited to just three points-scoring finishes—in Monaco, Spain and Japan—whilst Herbert was also closer to him in performance than his team-mates in previous years had been. He finished the season twelfth in the World Drivers&#x27; Championship with seven points; by this stage, his move to Williams for 1997 had been announced.

===Williams (1997–1998)===

For the 1997 season, Frentzen replaced 1996 champion Damon Hill at the Williams-Renault team. At the first race of the season, Frentzen took the lead at the first corner and remained there until his first pit stop. He was running second late in the race when a brake disc exploded, throwing him off the circuit and into retirement. He took his first win at the fourth race of the year at San Marino. Frentzen followed this with his first pole position of his career at the following round in Monaco, but did not finish the race. After inconsistency marked the first half of the season, Frentzen finished the second half of season with six points scoring performances including five consecutive podiums. Despite eight front-row starts and seven podium finishes, Frentzen was generally out-performed by team-mate Jacques Villeneuve, out-qualifying the French-Canadian only four times during the season. Frentzen was unable to secure another victory and finished third in the driver&#x27;s championship standings with 42 points to teammate Villeneuve&#x27;s 81. He would be elevated to second after the disqualification of Michael Schumacher.

Renault discontinued factory support for the Williams engines in 1998. Williams also lost chief designer Adrian Newey to McLaren during the off-season. Consequently the team suffered a loss of performance compared to eventual title winners McLaren and Williams&#x27; 1997 title-rivals Ferrari. Frentzen would start the season with a podium at Albert Park. This would be the highlight of Frentzen&#x27;s year, as he was unable to repeat the podium, and was once again out-performed by team mate Jacques Villenuve. Frentzen finished the season placed 7th in the championship with 17 points. Frentzen would depart Williams during the off-season after two difficult years, with the time considered disappointing due to difficulty adjusting to the different atmosphere at Williams compared to Sauber and disagreements with head engineer Patrick Head.

===Jordan (1999–mid 2001) and Prost (mid 2001)===
In 1999 Frentzen moved to Jordan in a straight swap with Ralf Schumacher and enjoyed success in the Mugen-Honda powered car, with two race wins and scoring points in the majority of races. During the 1999 European Grand Prix he was leading after a pole position and with both Häkkinen and Irvine outside of the points (Häkkinen because he pitted for wets during a very very short shower period and Irvine because of a very slow pit stop where the rear right tyre was not ready in time) and with both outside the points and equal on 60 points and with him on 50, if positions would not change, he would be equal on points with both Häkkinen and Irvine with 2 races to go. But on the 32nd lap, his Jordan stopped. Häkkinen went on to recover and finish 5th. Before the 1999 Malaysian Grand Prix he was 12 points behind championship leader Häkkinen. But his title dreams were dashed on that race, with Frentzen finishing 6th, with Häkkinen and Irvine finishing 3rd and 1st respectively. With 1 race to go (and 10 points still available for drivers) Frentzen had 51 points, 19 less than championship leader Irvine. Frentzen finished third in the Driver Championship (22 points behind the world champion Mika Häkkinen and was regarded by many as the driver of the year. After the strong season Frentzen was considered as a favourite to challenge for the championship in 2000.

2000 and 2001 were critical years as Honda also began to supply the BAR team, resulting in a race between the teams as to who would secure the regular engine supply. In 2000 Frentzen managed two podiums, which were the best results for the team, but Jordan still finished down the grid and, crucially, behind BAR. After some low points finishes, injury, disagreements about the technical direction of the team (Frentzen reportedly offered to pay for the changes to fix the car, out of his own pocket) and then a string of retirements halfway through the 2001 season, Jordan sacked Frentzen and replaced him with Jean Alesi. Eight years later Eddie Jordan revealed that the termination of Frentzen&#x27;s contract was a move to appease Honda and sign the Japanese driver Takuma Sato to race for the team. Frentzen subsequently took Alesi&#x27;s place at the struggling Prost team, and managed to qualify fourth at Spa, before the outfit collapsed financially at the end of the season.

===Arrows (2002) and return to Sauber (2002–03)===
On 30 December 2001, Frentzen was signed by Arrows for the 2002 season. He scored points on two occasions and outpaced both the Jaguars who ran the same engine. The team went bankrupt in August and Frentzen was released from his contract. Back with Sauber for 2003, after a one-off drive replacing Felipe Massa at the 2002 United States Grand Prix, Frentzen was evenly matched with his highly rated teammate Nick Heidfeld and scored a final podium finish in the penultimate race of the year in the United States.

==DTM==
For 2004, Frentzen moved to the German Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters saloon car series to drive for Opel, encouraged by the success achieved in the series by fellow F1 refugee Jean Alesi. His Opel Vectra was not a competitive car, and he was regularly outpaced by not only the Audi and Mercedes drivers but also by his Opel teammates, eventually finishing the season 14th in the championship standings. He remained in the DTM with Opel for the 2005 season and finished the year in 8th as best-placed Opel driver, with his best result a 3rd place from pole position at Brno in the Czech Republic.

After Opel withdrew after the 2005 season, Frentzen joined Audi for 2006. He would finish 3rd at the first race of the season at Hockenheim and again at the 8th race of the season at Barcelona. Frentzen finished the season 7th in the final standings and quit the team stating he had &quot;no support from the team&quot;.

==Later career==

In April 2008, Frentzen drove the Bahrain race in the Speedcar Series of the 2007/2008 season and later on joined the Speedcar Series for the complete 2008/2009 season. He competed in the 24 Hours of Le Mans for Aston Martin Racing driving one of the two factory Aston Martin DBR9s with Karl Wendlinger and Andrea Piccini in the GT1 class. His team finished 4th in class and 16th overall.

Also in 2008, Frentzen built the HHF Hybrid Concept Car which he entered in the 24 Hours Nürburgring with his own team. The chassis was a bought Gumpert Apollo road car with a 3.3 litre V8 bi-turbo with 520 hp and an electric motor with approximately 136 hp. Frentzen finished the race but was not classified due to two conventional gearbox failures.

In 2011, Frentzen won a special one-off &quot;ROC Legends&quot; race against Hans-Joachim Stuck, Marc Duez and Stig Blomqvist as part of the 2011 Race of Champions. In 2012, Frentzen competed in the ADAC GT Masters season with a Callaway Competition Corvette Z06, and returned to the series in 2014 with a HTP Motorsport Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG GT3.

==Driving style and appraisal==
Frentzen has been described as a loyal driver. The monthly magazine &quot;F1 Racing&quot; observed that the key issue for Frentzen was finding the appropriate settings for his car which was done by himself. In his autobiography &quot;An Independent Man&quot;, Eddie Jordan said that Frentzen did a &quot;great job&quot; at driving the Jordan 199. After leaving Sauber at the end of 2003, BBC Sport described Frentzen as a driver who &quot;never quite made the most of a brilliant natural talent&quot;. Sauber team principal Peter Sauber said in 2005 that Frentzen was the most important driver for his team but admitted that the driver needed to work in a specific atmosphere and referred to his time at Williams where he was in conflict with technical director Patrick Head.

==Other notable appearances==
Frentzen appeared on an episode in the 29th series of British motoring show &quot;Top Gear&quot; in 2020, in which he appeared as a rival for the presenters in a Germany versus Britain challenge.

== Personal life ==
In the early 1990s, Frentzen was in a relationship with Corinna Betsch. After their relationship ended, Corinna later married fellow Formula 1 driver Michael Schumacher. In 1999, Frentzen married Tanja Nigge. Together they have three children.

<doc id="756777" wikidata="Q1344347" url="?curid=756777" title="List of Go terms">
<text>Players of the game of Go often use jargon to describe situations on the board and surrounding the game. Such technical terms are likely to be encountered in books and articles about Go in English as well as other languages. Many of these terms have been borrowed from Japanese, mostly when no short equivalent English term could be found. This article gives an overview of the most important terms.

== Use of Japanese terms ==
Although Go originated in China, the current English and Western technical vocabulary borrows a high proportion of terms from the Japanese language because it was through Japan that the West was introduced to Go.

Many of these terms are from a jargon used for technical Go writing and are to some extent specially developed for Go journalism. Some authors of English-language Go materials avoid use of Japanese technical terms, and the way they are applied can differ in subtle ways from the original meanings.

A few Korean-language terms have come into use (e.g., &quot;haengma&quot; as a way of describing the development of stones).

== Terms ==

=== &quot;Aji&quot; ===

 refers to the latent potential of stones to open various avenues of play. The &quot;aji&quot; in various positions on the board impacts the course of the game regardless of whether a player makes moves to realize the latent potential. A situation is said to contain bad &quot;aji&quot; when the presence of the opponent&#x27;s stones or weaknesses in one&#x27;s own position create a threat of compromising the position at an opportune moment in the game. It can be very difficult for players to assess the best moment to play a move to realize the potential of &quot;aji&quot; in a position or to remove the threat of bad &quot;aji&quot; in one&#x27;s own position.

In the diagram, the triangled stone is dead, and the three squared white stones appears to be trapped. However, the &quot;aji&quot; of the triangled stone enables White to escape by jumping to White 1. If black resists, the two black stones can be captured with the help of the triangled stone.

=== &quot;Atari&quot; ===
 is a term for a situation where a stone or group of stones has only one liberty and may be captured on the next move if unable to attain additional liberties. A group in such a situation is said to be &quot;in atari&quot; or &quot;under atari&quot;. Beginners often verbally call out &quot;atari&quot; in a manner similar to calling out &quot;check&quot; in chess, but it is considered inappropriate for more advanced players. In the illustration, the triangled white stones are said to be in &quot;atari&quot;, because black can capture them in a single move. If black plays a move at &quot;a&quot;, the white pieces are immediately captured and removed from the board.

In Japanese, () is the nominalized form of (, , or ), meaning &#x27;to hit the target&#x27; or &#x27;to receive something fortuitously&#x27;. The word is used in Japanese when a prediction comes true or when someone wins a lottery. In Chinese &quot;ta chi&#x27;ih&quot; (); Korean: &quot;dansu&quot; ().

=== Board positions ===
As the distance of a stone from the edge of the board has important tactical and strategic implications, it is normal to term the corner points of the board (1, 1) points, and count lines in from the edge.
* Star point (Japanese: 星, &quot;hoshi&quot;; ): an intersection traditionally marked with a small dot on the board. These are either
** a) (4, 4) point in an empty corner, or
** a) (4, 10) or (10, 4) point on one of the sides
* b) : the center of the board, located at (10, 10).
* c) : a (5, 5) point in a corner.
* d) : a (3, 3) point in a corner.
* e) : a (4, 3) or (3, 4) point in a corner.
* f) : a (5, 4) or (4, 5) point in a corner.
* g) : a (6, 4) or (4, 6) point in a corner.
* h) : a (5, 3) or (3, 5) point in a corner.
* i) : a (6, 3) or (3, 6) point in a corner.

=== &quot;Dame&quot; ===
 are unfilled neutral points that will not benefit either side. Typically, the term refers to vacant points that lie between two opposing forces, and will eventually be filled without altering the score. Basically, dame points are of no interest, though they must be filled before counting the score under area (Chinese style) scoring. The Japanese rules define a dame as a vacant point that is not surrounded by live stones of only one color, so the term can also refer to an empty point that is tactically useful as a liberty for a unit.

=== Divine move ===

A divine move is an exceptional, inspired and original move; one that is non-obvious and which balances strategy and tactics to create an unexpected turning point in a game. A divine move is singular; it is of such rarity that a professional Go player might reasonably hope to play a single such move in a lifetime. The term comes from the Japanese phrase , meaning &#x27;move of God&#x27; or &#x27;Godly move&#x27;.

The ear-reddening move played by Hon&#x27;inbō Shūsaku in 1846 is considered to be an example of a divine move.

=== Double &quot;hane&quot; ===
The double &quot;hane&quot; (, ) is a sequence of two moves in succession that step around an opponent&#x27;s adjacent group. It can be an aggressive and appropriate way to play, although it exposes the stones to cutting.
=== Eyes ===

Eyes are internal, fully surrounded liberties of a group of stones. An eye cannot be filled by the opponent until all of the group&#x27;s other liberties have been filled.

The presence or absence of eyes in a group determine life or death of that group: A group with one or no eyes will die unless its owner can develop them; conversely, a group with two or more eyes will live since an opponent can never reduce the group down to a single liberty.

Eyes are counted as occupied territory of the group that fully surrounds the eye. When a group shares (is adjacent to) one or more eyes with the opposing player&#x27;s groups, those eyes do not count as territory for either player. Sometimes those eyes are reduced to dame as other areas of the board change to give one or both groups additional eyes, allowing one or both players to fill the shared eyes. But sometimes those shared eyes do not resolve .

=== &quot;Gote&quot; ===

Playing means responding directly to the opponent&#x27;s &quot;sente&quot; move.

=== &quot;Hane&quot; ===

A &quot;hane&quot; (; ) is a move that goes around one or more of the opponent&#x27;s stones.

=== &quot;Hayago&quot; ===
 means &#x27;quick go&#x27;, &#x27;fast go&#x27; or &#x27;quick play&#x27;. Most &quot;hayago&quot; games last either five minutes, with ten seconds allotted for each move, or ten minutes, with thirty seconds per move.

=== &quot;Jigo&quot; ===

A is a tied score, i.e., the players have an equal number of points at the conclusion of the game. &quot;Jigo&quot; can be avoided by adding a fractional komi to white&#x27;s score.

=== &quot;Joseki&quot; ===

 are established sequences of play which (locally speaking) are considered to give an optimal result (balanced exchanges and/or equal territories/influences) to both players. There are thousands of such lines that have been researched and documented.

Often &quot;joseki&quot; are played out early in the game and involve dividing the corners. There are also &quot;mid-game joseki&quot;, dealing with for example an invasion into a common enclosure or framework.

Though &quot;joseki&quot; have some parallel with chess openings, they differ significantly. Chess openings structure the whole board while &quot;joseki&quot; deal only with a local position. Therefore, the choice of which &quot;joseki&quot; (of many possible) to play in any given situation should be based on an assessment of the global position. This includes considerations of the direction of play, current balance of territory and influence, and one&#x27;s own game strategy.

It is also quite possible to deviate from &quot;joseki&quot; and obtain a good result if the surrounding position allows. In other words, &quot;joseki&quot; are sensitive to the context in which they are played.

=== &quot;Kakari&quot; ===

A is an approach move to a corner position, such as at the 5-3 point (low &quot;kakari&quot;) or the 5-4 point (high &quot;kakari&quot;) when an opponent has previously played the 3-4 point, as in the diagram. More generally a &quot;kakari&quot; is low if it is played on the third line and high if it played on the fourth line. &quot;Kakaris&quot; higher than the fourth line are uncommon in professional play.

=== &quot;Keima&quot; ===

A is a stone placement which makes an &#x27;L&#x27; shape. It is sometimes called a &#x27;knight&#x27;s move&#x27; since it resembles the movement of the knight in chess.

=== &quot;Kiai&quot; ===

 translates as &#x27;fighting spirit&#x27;, meaning play that is aggressive or where the player takes the initiative. &quot;Kiai&quot; typically means keeping sente and not letting the opponent have his or her way. A sensei might say, &quot;You play too passively — put some &quot;kiai&quot; in your moves!” &quot;Kiai&quot; moves can surprise an opponent and turn the game around. Examples of &quot;kiai&quot; include defending with a move that also counter-attacks or answering a &quot;kikashi&quot; (forcing move) in an unexpected way. &quot;Kiai&quot; is also a term used in Japanese martial arts, usually as a name for a loud yell accompanying an attack.

=== &quot;Kikashi&quot; ===
Literally meaning &#x27;an enlivenment&#x27;, is a forcing move, usually one made outside the primary flow of play. Unlike &quot;sente&quot;, though, a move is &quot;kikashi&quot; when it yields a high efficiency in play by forcing the opponent to abandon a course of action. A &quot;kikashi&quot; stone will usually be sacrificed while conferring an advantage; for example, the &quot;kikashi&quot; stone could act as a ladder breaker or destroy the opponent&#x27;s potential eyeshape, while the answering move has no value at all.Moves can be &quot;kikashi&quot;, or not, depending on whether they are answered with appropriate sophistication or not. If the answering move strengthens the position, then the play is not &quot;kikashi&quot; but &quot;aji keshi&quot; (ruining one&#x27;s own potential).

=== &quot;Ko&quot; ===
 refers to a situation where the &quot;ko&quot; rule applies. The &quot;ko&quot; rule states that a move cannot be played such that it causes the board to look exactly the same as it did at the end of the player&#x27;s last move. Consequently, if a player captures a single stone, the opponent cannot respond immediately by capturing the stone the player used to make the original capture. This would make the board look as it did immediately priora situation that could repeat indefinitely.

A player may take advantage of the &quot;ko&quot; rule by playing a move with the knowledge that the opponent will not be permitted to recapture immediately. The opponent, however, may play a &quot;sente&quot; move elsewhere forcing the player to respond, in which case the opponent may then recapture the &quot;ko&quot;. Such a &quot;sente&quot; play is referred to as a &quot;ko threat&quot;. This kind of repeated back and forth sequence of &quot;ko&quot; capture, &quot;ko&quot; threat, response to &quot;ko&quot; threat, &quot;ko&quot; re-capture, etc., is known as a &quot;ko fight&quot;.

=== &quot;Komi&quot; ===

 is a bonus in score given to white as compensation for going second. There is no agreement on what Komi should be, but is commonly in the range of 4.5 to 7.5 points. Komi almost always includes a half point for breaking ties.

=== &quot;Korigatachi&quot; ===
 is often translated as &#x27;over-concentrated&#x27;, but more literally is &#x27;frozen shape&#x27;. If a player uses his stones in an inefficient way, the result will be &quot;korigatachi&quot;. Knowing something about this problem should tell you how to avoid it. Placing stones too close together is a fundamental mistake, rather than safe play.

=== &quot;Kosumi&quot; ===

The is a move placed at a point diagonally adjacent to another of one&#x27;s own stones where the adjoining intersections are unoccupied.

=== Ladder ===

A is a sequence of moves in which an attacker pursues a group in &quot;atari&quot; in a zig-zag pattern across the board.

=== Liberty ===
A is a vacant point that is immediately adjacent to a stone in a cardinal (orthogonal) direction, or connected through a continuous string of same-colored stones to such a point. A stone, chain, or group must have at least one liberty to survive. A group that has two or more separate internal liberties (eyes) is impossible to capture.

=== &quot;Miai&quot; ===

 (Korean: ) are a pair of vacant points on the board that are equivalent in value. For example, if Black plays at &quot;A&quot;, White can play at &quot;B&quot; and suffer no disadvantage from the exchange.

This occurs often. &quot;Miai&quot; can be seen in the &quot;fuseki&quot; stage on a large scale, or in a simple life and death problem, such as a straight four-space eye. This shape is alive because of its two central points &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;: if Black plays &quot;a&quot;, White can answer with &quot;b&quot; and vice versa.

The term originates from the Japanese custom of arranging marriage through a series of meetings (&quot;miai&quot;) to view prospective spouses ( &quot;miru&quot;, &quot;view&quot;, &quot;au&quot;, &quot;meet&quot;).

=== Monkey jump ===

A monkey jump is a move, usually used in the end-game, which can reduce one&#x27;s opponent&#x27;s territory significantly. It can be played when the attacker has a strong stone on the second line and the defender has no nearby stones on the first or second line guarding his hoped-for territory. The attacker places a stone on the first line three spaces into the defender&#x27;s territory from the strong stone. Due to the special properties of the edge of the board, the defender cannot usually cut off the stone.

=== &quot;Moyo&quot; ===
 is a framework for potential territory which usually consists of unconnected stones with some distance between them. The early game usually consists of competing for &quot;moyo&quot; by attempting to expand one&#x27;s own and/or invade or reduce one&#x27;s opponent&#x27;s. This term is often translated as &#x27;framework&#x27;, &#x27;potential&#x27; or &#x27;wall&#x27;.

=== &quot;Myoushu&quot; ===
 is an inspired movea move which turns a game around or otherwise exceeds expectations. An example of &quot;myoushu&quot; is the ear-reddening move played by Honinbo Shusaku in 1846.

=== &quot;Nakade&quot; ===

A refers to a move inside an opponent&#x27;s group that prevents the opponent from making two eyes. It can also refer to a group of stones or a shape where such a move could be played. The illustration shows a &quot;nakade&quot; often referred to as &quot;bulky five&quot; or &quot;chair&quot; shape.

=== &quot;Nerai&quot; ===
 is a Japanese go term (noun, from the verb nerau) meaning threat, aim, target, follow-up.

=== Peep ===
A peep is a move normally played in &quot;sente&quot; in which a stone is placed directly next to an empty point that would connect two groups. The move typically provokes an immediate response, since it threatens to separate the two groups.

=== Pincer ===
A pincer is a move that approaches an opponent&#x27;s stone from both sides. The purpose of the attack is to diminish the opponent&#x27;s ability to form a base or occupy a territory on the side.

=== Probe ===
A probe is a sophisticated move designed to yield information about the opponent&#x27;s intentions based on how they respond. The Japanese term for a probing move is . The phrase &quot;yōsu o miru&quot; literally means &#x27;to see how things stand&#x27;. A probe draws on other concepts such as &quot;kikashi&quot;, &quot;aji&quot;, and &quot;korigatachi.&quot;

=== &quot;Sabaki&quot; ===
 is the development of a flexible, efficient position that is difficult for the opponent to attack, often by means of contact plays and sacrifice.

=== &quot;Seki&quot; ===

 is a Japanese term for an impasse that cannot be resolved into simple life and death. It is sometimes translated as &quot;mutual life&quot; (). For example, a capturing race may end in a position in which neither player can capture the other. There are numerous types of &quot;seki&quot; positions that can arise, characterized as cases in which neither player adds a play to groups that do not have two eyes. The area remains untouched; at the end all groups involved are deemed alive, but no points are scored for territory.

In the &quot;seki&quot; figure, if either White or Black play on the points marked &quot;a&quot;, the other will effect capture immediately and will be able (if playing properly) to form two eyes.

=== &quot;Sente&quot; ===

Playing means to have the initiative.

=== Shape ===

Shape is the configuration of stones in their flexibility and efficiency at staying connected, forming eyes, and maintaining liberties. Stones are said to have good shape if they are efficient and flexible and bad shape if they are inefficient. Examples of good shape are the &quot;ponnuki&quot; (four stones in a diamond created by capturing an enemy stone) and the bamboo joint (a 2×3 pattern of two stones, two spaces and two more stones). Examples of bad shape are the empty triangle (three adjacent stones forming an &#x27;L&#x27;) and the &quot;dango&quot; (meaning &#x27;dumpling&#x27;, a large clump of stones not containing any eyes).

=== Shoulder hit ===

A shoulder hit is a stone placed diagonally next to an opponent&#x27;s stone, often towards the center of the board. It is generally used to reduce the territorial potential of an opponent&#x27;s group without being easily captured.

=== &quot;Tenuki&quot; ===

To play is to ignore an opponent&#x27;s &quot;sente&quot; move in order to play elsewhere.

=== &quot;Tesuji&quot; ===
A is a clever play, the best play in a local position, a skillful move. &quot;Tesuji&quot; is derived from , which means &#x27;line of play&#x27;.

The opposite of &quot;tesuji&quot; is &quot;zokusuji&quot;, which can be translated as &#x27;crude line of play&#x27;, and also referred to as &quot;anti-suji&quot; or a &quot;vulgar&quot; move depending on the situation.

&quot;Tesuji&quot; often require a player to read a situation several moves ahead. They may be applied in life and death situations (as found in &quot;tsumego&quot;), in order to obtain initiative (&quot;sente&quot;), to capture stones, to gain extra points in the end game (&quot;yose&quot;), or otherwise to salvage a seemingly unfavorable situation.

=== Thickness ===

 describes a position of power and impregnability. A group is thick when it has developed beyond the level of stability in its local area without accruing significant weaknesses, and consequently projects power at a distance, especially over vacant or unsettled areas of the board. Such positions have a profound influence on the flow of the game. In the diagram, though white has about 10 points of territory in the corner while black has little or none, black can expect the power projected outward by his thick position to more than make up for this. Note that black&#x27;s advantage would not be as significant if white had a settled position in the direction black&#x27;s influence is facing.

=== &quot;Yose&quot; ===
 is a term for endgame plays. A &quot;yose&quot; translates as a &#x27;tightening play&#x27;, i.e., a play on the board that consolidates territory or destroys the opponent&#x27;s territory. It also refers to the endgame phase.

A fundamental skill in the endgame is the ability to evaluate plays in different areas of the board and identify which plays have priority. This usually requires determining the number of points at stake (known as &quot;counting&quot;). Knowledge of counting begins with some simple examples and heuristics. Combinatorial game theory has been implicated in gaining actual proofs rather than practical ways to win positions.

&quot;Ōyose&quot;, or large &quot;yose&quot; refers to a position that is large enough to be hard to count with precision (say, 20 points or more). It may also be used to refer to the early endgame phase.

== Use in popular culture ==

The name of the video game company &quot;Atari&quot; came from the term used while playing the game because co-founder Nolan Bushnell was a fan of the game. &quot;Sente Technologies&quot; and &quot;Tengen&quot; also derive their names from Go terms.

<doc id="756781" wikidata="Q1441820" url="?curid=756781" title="Francis de Groot">
<text>Francis Edward de Groot (24 October 1888 – 1 April 1969) was an Irish-Australian soldier and furniture maker. He is best known for dramatically interrupting the official opening of the Sydney Harbour Bridge in 1932, attempting to slash the ribbon with a military sword while on horseback.

De Groot was born in Dublin into a family of artisans. He left school at a young age and joined the Merchant Navy, later serving an apprenticeship with his uncle, an antiques dealer. He first lived in Australia from 1910 to 1914, working for Angus &amp; Robertson as an antiques buyer. De Groot returned to Ireland in 1914 and enlisted in the British Army, having previously served with reserve units. He saw active service on the Western Front and finished the war with the rank of captain. In 1920, de Groot returned to Australia and established his own furniture-making business in Sydney, producing replicas of 18th-century furniture styles in Australian timber. He serviced a number of commercial clients and high-profile individuals from a workshop in Rushcutters Bay.

De Groot was a fascist and joined the paramilitary New Guard in 1931, taking part in clashes with left-wing groups. His disruption of the opening of the Sydney Harbour Bridge was designed to embarrass state premier Jack Lang, a particular target of the New Guard. He was arrested on the spot and charged with minor offences, receiving a small fine; he later successfully sued the police for wrongful arrest. Photographs and films of De Groot&#x27;s actions were widely published and made him a significant public figure, although he played little further role in the New Guard. He continued his work as a furniture manufacturer and during World War II served with the Australian military, eventually retiring back to Ireland.

==Early life==
De Groot was born on 24 October 1888 in central Dublin. He was the son of Mary (née Butler) and Cornelius De Groot. His father&#x27;s family was of Dutch Huguenot ancestry. He came from &quot;a dynasty of carvers and gilders&quot;; his father was a wood carver and sculptor, while his paternal grandfather exhibited wood carvings at the Great Exhibition of 1851 and Irish Industrial Exhibition of 1852.

De Groot attended Blackrock College and Belvedere College in Dublin. He joined the Merchant Navy at the age of thirteen, but later took up an apprenticeship with his uncle Michael Butler, an antiques dealer, for whom he worked for five years in Dublin and London. He remained involved with the military, joining the South of Ireland Imperial Yeomanry in 1907 and serving for six months with the 5th Dragoon Guards in 1909.

===Early years in Australia===
In 1910, de Groot immigrated to Australia and settled in Sydney. He soon came into contact with bookseller and antiquarian George Robertson, one of the founders of the Angus &amp; Robertson bookstore chain, and his associate Frederick Wymark. Robertson had tasked Wymark with opening a gallery attached to Angus &amp; Robertson&#x27;s Castlereagh Street store selling art and antiquities. De Groot&#x27;s connections in Dublin and London proved useful to Wymark and he serviced a number of significant clients including Eadith Walker, S. H. Ervin, Thomas Anderson Stuart, William Dixson, the Vickery family and the Hordern family. In his memoirs he recalled that Robertson had given him a budget of £10,000 () to acquire items for resale by Angus &amp; Robertson.

===World War I===
De Groot returned to Ireland on the outbreak of World War I and enlisted in the 15th Hussars, a cavalry regiment. He saw active service on the Western Front, later transferring to a tank battalion with the rank of acting captain. He was present for the Battle of the Somme in 1916 and the Battle of Passchendaele in 1917. He was discharged in 1919, with his discharge delayed by his recovery from Spanish flu.

==Furniture business==

In October 1919, de Groot married Mary Elizabeth Byrne in Donnybrook, Dublin. They had first met in 1910 prior to de Groot&#x27;s initial departure to Australia. After their marriage they took advantage of a War Office scheme which provided free passage to the Dominions for returned soldiers. They arrived in Sydney in May 1920 and de Groot established his own business as an antique dealer and manufacturer of reproduction furniture. De Groot&#x27;s Auction Rooms opened in Phillip Street in 1921 and later shifted to Bent Street. Specialising in Queensland maple, his business proved immensely successful and by 1927 he was reportedly employing 200 artisans at his workshop in Rushcutters. However, it has been suggested that the figures he claimed &quot;seem implausible given the size of the Australian furniture market in the 1920s&quot;.

De Groot had a particular interest in 18th-century furniture styles, translating Chippendale, Adam and William and Mary styles into Australian timbers &quot;with concessions to 20th century housekeeping&quot;. One of his most significant commissions in the 1920s was a refit of the David Jones department store chain. In 1934 he received a major commission from The Australia Hotel in Sydney, and the following year he designed a furniture suite for Governor-General Isaac Isaacs to be installed at Government House, Canberra. De Groot exhibited with The Society of Arts and Crafts of NSW in 1937 and advertised widely in interior design publications such as &quot;The Australian Home Builder&quot; and &quot;The Home&quot;. Outside of furniture he also collected china, silver, Waterford Crystal, and Persian rugs.

==Politics==

During the 1930s, de Groot joined a fascist paramilitary organisation called the New Guard, which was politically opposed to the more left-wing government and the socialist views of NSW Premier Jack Lang. Many of the members of the New Guard were men who had served in World War I.

Seeking to attack leftist meetings, de Groot organised groups of 1,000-strong groups of New Guard members throughout December 1931, commenting later that &quot;the best reply to force, was greater force...seeing that we could command the greater force, [I] saw no reason why it should not be employed&quot;.

== Sydney Harbour Bridge opening ceremony incident ==
He became famous when, on Saturday 19 March 1932, he upstaged Lang at the opening of the Sydney Harbour Bridge, before a crowd of 300,000 people. He was not a member of the official party but, on horseback and dressed in his military uniform, he was able to blend in with the escort party of NSW Lancers. Lang was about to cut the ribbon to formally open the bridge, when de Groot rode forward and drew his ceremonial sword, attempting to cut the ribbon and declare the bridge open &quot;in the name of the decent and respectable people of New South Wales&quot;. While many accounts say de Groot succeeded in slashing the ribbon, at least one eyewitness has disputed the claim and suggested it was probably broken by the hooves of his rearing horse.
He said this was in protest that the Governor of New South Wales, Sir Philip Game, had not been invited to perform the ceremony. The Mayor of North Sydney, Hubert Primrose, an official participant at the opening ceremony, was also a member of the New Guard, but whether he was involved in planning de Groot&#x27;s act is unknown. De Groot was also said to have later joined the White Army, another fascist organisation founded in Victoria in 1931.

===Arrest===

W. J. Mackay, Chief of the CBI pulled de Groot from his horse, arrested him, and confiscated his ceremonial sword. Initially he was taken to a small police station attached to the toll house on the Sydney Harbour Bridge. Later in the day he was sent to the Lunatic Reception House at Darlinghurst, where he was formally charged with being insane and not under proper care and control. On the same afternoon de Groot was examined by Eric Hilliard, psychiatrist and medical superintendent of Parramatta Mental Hospital, who determined that de Groot was not insane. The following day de Groot was examined by W.S. Dawson, Professor of Psychiatry at Sydney University, and by John McPherson. Both doctors found him to be completely sane.

On 21 March 1932, de Groot appeared before Mr. McDougall, Stipendiary Magistrate, for the hearing of the charge of insanity. Detective Superintendent Mackay gave evidence to the effect that de Groot&#x27;s actions on the Bridge were those of an insane man. Subsequently, Eric Hilliard gave his opinion, based on his examination of de Groot, that de Groot was sane. The magistrate subsequently ordered de Groot&#x27;s discharge from the Reception House.

===Charges===

De Groot was subsequently charged with three offences. The three charges brought against him were:

# Having maliciously damaged a ribbon which was the property of the Government of New South Wales to the value of £2;
# Having behaved in an offensive manner in a public place; and
# Having used threatening words to Inspector Stuart Robson in a public place.

The charges were heard on 1, 4, 5, and 6 April 1932 in the Central Police Court in Liverpool Street, Sydney before John Laidlaw, Chief Stipendiary Magistrate of New South Wales.

While the first and third charges laid against him were dismissed, the Magistrate did find de Groot guilty of offensive behaviour in Bradfield Highway – a public place. He was fined the maximum penalty of £5, with £4 in costs. The Magistrate found that &quot;... the actions of the defendant were grossly offensive, provocative, and clearly unlawful&quot;.

Later, de Groot sued the Commissioner of police for wrongful arrest, and case was eventually settled out of court with de Groot receiving damages amounting to £69/1/9 (£ or $138.18).

===Horse===
The horse ridden by de Groot at the opening ceremony was a 16.2-hand chestnut named &quot;Mick&quot;. The horse belonged to a Pymble schoolgirl, Margo Reichard, and was borrowed by the leader of the New Guard, Eric Campbell, from her father Albert Reichard. After the escapade, the horse was initially taken to the Mounted Police Barracks before being returned to its owner. In about 1933 the horse had a fall while being ridden by Albert Reichard, and was put down.

== Later life ==
After the court case he sued for wrongful arrest on the grounds that a police officer had no right to arrest an officer of the Hussars. An out-of-court settlement was reached, and de Groot&#x27;s ceremonial sword was returned to him. He later returned to Ireland, where he died on 1 April 1969.

Before his death, de Groot indicated he would like to see the sword returned to Australia. In 2004, the sword was found on a farm in County Wicklow, in the possession of de Groot&#x27;s nephew. Plans were announced to have it valued and returned to Australia, possibly as a display at the National Museum of Australia. However, the Museum was outbid by Paul Cave, the founder and chairman of BridgeClimb Sydney, the tourism company that conducts climbs across the Harbour Bridge. The sword was presented to Bridge Climb Sydney by prior students of Blackrock College, de Groot&#x27;s old school, during a school reunion for ex-students now living in Australia.

<text>The Judge Advocate General&#x27;s Corps, also known as the &quot;JAG Corps&quot; or &quot;JAG&quot;, is the legal arm of the United States Navy. Today, the JAG Corps consists of a worldwide organization of more than 1,000 commissioned officers serving as judge advocates, 550 enlisted members (primarily in the legalman rating), and nearly 700 civilian personnel, all serving under the direction of the judge advocate general of the Navy. The organization also includes more than 550 Reserve office and enlisted members in the Navy Reserve Law Program. 

The Office of the Judge Advocate General of the Navy is located in Washington, D.C.

==History==
In 1775, the Continental Congress enacted the Articles of Conduct, governing the ships and men of the Continental Navy. However, all of these ships were soon sold and Navy and Marine Corps were disbanded. In July 1797, Congress authorized the construction of six frigates and enacted the Rules for Regulation of the Navy as a temporary measure. Then, in 1800, Congress enacted a more sophisticated code adopted directly from the British Naval Code of 1749. There was little or no need for lawyers to interpret these simple codes, nor was there a need for lawyers in the uncomplicated administration of the Navy prior to the Civil War.

During the Civil War, however, Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles named a young assistant U.S. attorney in the District of Columbia named Nathaniel Wilson to present the government&#x27;s case in complicated courts-martial. Without any statutory authority, Secretary Welles gave Wilson the title of &quot;Solicitor of the Navy Department,&quot; making him the first house counsel to the U.S. Navy.

By the Act of March 2, 1865, Congress authorized the president &quot;to appoint, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, for service during the rebellion and one year thereafter, an officer of the [Navy] to be called the &#x27;Solicitor and Naval Judge Advocate General.&#x27;&quot; The United States Congress maintained the billet on a year-to-year basis by amendments to the Naval Appropriations Acts. In 1870, Congress transferred the billet to a newly established Justice Department with the title of Naval Solicitor.

Colonel William Butler Remey, U.S. Marine Corps, was the first uniformed chief legal officer of the Navy, in 1878. Colonel Remey was able to convince Congress that the Navy Department needed a permanent uniformed judge advocate general and that naval law was so unique it would be better to appoint a line officer of the Navy or Marine Corps. The bill to create the billet of judge advocate general of the Navy was signed in 1880.

The Naval Appropriations Act of 1918 elevated the billets of navy bureau chiefs and judge advocate general to rear admiral. In July 1918, Captain George Ramsey Clark was appointed the first judge advocate general to hold the rank of rear admiral.

In 1946, the Naval Justice School was established at Port Hueneme, Calif., to provide legal training for all Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard lawyers, enlisted legal professionals, active and reserve.

In 1947, the Navy created a &quot;law specialist&quot; program to allow line officers restricted duty to perform legal services. By the Act of May 5, 1950, Congress required that the judge advocate general be a lawyer. The act also required each judge advocate general of any service be a member of the bar with not less than eight years of legal duties as a commissioned officer. The Act also enacted the first Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ).

By 1967, the Navy had 20 years of experience with the law specialist program. There was, however, increasing pressure to create a separate corps of lawyers. That year, Congress decided to establish the Judge Advocate General&#x27;s Corps within the Department of the Navy. The legislation was signed into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson on December 8, 1967, and ensured navy lawyers as staff officers within the navy, and ensured Navy lawyers’ status as members of a distinct professional group within the Navy, similar to physicians and chaplains.

On December 3, 1973, by Notice 5450, the chief of naval operations (CNO) officially established the Naval Legal Service, “to administer the legal services program and provide command direction for all Naval Legal Service activities and resources as may be assigned; and to perform such other functions or tasks as may be related to the Naval Legal Service as directed by the CNO.” Navy Legal Service Offices were created in 1976 and responsible for providing defense and legal assistance to eligible personnel; Trial Service Offices were established in the mid-1990s and responsible for providing courts-martial prosecution, court reporting and administrative trial support; and Staff Judge Advocates provided legal advice to U.S. naval base commanding officers. In 2004, the judge advocate general approved the merger of the Navy&#x27;s Trial Service Offices and Staff Judge Advocates into new commands known as Region Legal Service Offices. On October 1, 2012, the eight Navy Legal Service Offices were disestablished and four Defense Service Offices were established.

In 2023, the Navy significantly reformed its military justice system and established the Office of Special Trial Counsel, which oversees the prosecution of sailors and other service members who commit personal violence offenses, including sexual assault.

Today, the judge advocate general directs a worldwide organization of active and reserve component judge advocates, active and reserve component enlisted, and civilian personnel. The judge advocate general provides legal and policy advice to the secretary of the Navy in all legal matters concerning military justice, administrative law, environmental law, ethics, claims, admiralty, operational and international law, litigation, and legal assistance.

==Insignia==

The distinctive JAG Corps insignia incorporates the millrind. In ancient France, the fer de moline, or millrind, was a symbol of equal justice for all under the law. The two counterbalancing oak leaves are identical and connote the scales upon which justice is weighed. Oak leaves denote a corps and symbolize strength, particularly the strength of the oak-timbered hulls of the early American Navy ships. In the milling of grains, the millrind was used to keep the stone-grinding wheels an equal distance apart to provide consistency in the milling process. Thus, it symbolizes the wheels of justice that must grind exceedingly fine and exceptionally even. In the 16th century, the millrind was adopted in England as a symbol for lawyers and later brought to America.

The legalman insignia incorporates the millrind and quill pen. The quill pen annotates the administrative nature and responsibilities that paralegals have for their attorneys.

==Legalman==

:&quot;See: (at &quot;Legalman&quot;)&quot;
Legalmen are trained paralegals who assist Navy and Marine Corps judge advocates and work in Navy legal offices throughout the fleet.

On January 4, 1972, Secretary of the Navy John H. Chafee approved the recommendation for establishment of the legalman enlisted rating. A memorandum from the chairman of the Rating Review Board announced the approval, stating in part, &quot;the scope of the new rating will provide judge advocates with the personnel trained in court reporting, claims matters, investigations, legal administration, and legal research. This scope is in consonance with the new concept in the civilian legal community where many areas of legal services can be provided by competent trained personnel under the supervision of a lawyer.&quot; On October 4, 1972, 275 petty officers were selected for conversion to the new legalman rating.

In 2007, the legalman education and training pipeline was adapted in order to fully train legalmen as paralegals. The Naval Justice School&#x27;s curriculum was adapted to include four American Bar Association approved paralegal college courses. Legalmen now leave Naval Justice School with 10 semester hours of college credit in paralegal studies.

==Judge Advocate General of the Navy==
The judge advocate general of the Navy and the deputy judge advocate general of the Navy are appointed positions. They are both nominated by the U.S. president and must be confirmed via majority vote by the U.S. Senate. They are appointed to a four-year term of office but they usually serve for three. They have historically been officers in the service of the Navy. Federal statutes, however, state that a Marine officer can be appointed to either position as long as he or she meets the requirements stated in the section. Currently, the judge advocate general is appointed as a three-star vice admiral or lieutenant general while holding office, and the deputy judge advocate general is currently appointed as a two-star rear admiral or a major general. Other than age and years of military service, there is no other statute of limitations on how many times they can be re-nominated for appointment to that position if the president so chooses.

<text>The Judge Advocate General&#x27;s Corps also known as the &quot;JAG Corps&quot; or &quot;JAG&quot; is the legal arm of the United States Air Force.

== History ==
The United States Air Force became a separate military service in September 1947. On June 25, 1948, Congress established an office of the Judge Advocate General (TJAG) in the United States Air Force. On July 8, 1949, the Air Force chief of staff designated 205 attorneys Air Force Judge Advocates. Thus, there were Air Force judge advocates three months before there was an Air Force judge advocate general. Following the promulgation of enabling legislation, the Air Force Judge Advocate General&#x27;s Department was established on January 25, 1949, by Department of the Air Force General Order No. 7 (as amended by General Order No. 17, May 15, 1949). While this event was clearly the birth of the department, it really represented an interim step, providing the Air Force authority to administer its military justice system within the existing Air Force structure of the time until other legislation (what became the Uniform Code of Military Justice) could be developed and enacted. The department was originally a part of the Air Force Personnel Branch but became a separate entity reporting directly to the Air Force chief of staff in February 1950. The first Air Force judge advocate general, Major General Reginald C. Harmon, believed it important for Air Force JAGs to remain a part of a functionally interconnected military department. For that reason, the concept of a separate corps was discarded in favor of the department that existed until 2003.
In 2003, the Judge Advocate General&#x27;s Department was renamed to the Judge Advocate General&#x27;s Corps by order of the secretary of the Air Force, James G. Roche. In December 2004, the Air Force Judge Advocate General, Thomas J. Fiscus, accepted non-judicial punishment under Article 15 of the UCMJ, for conduct unbecoming of an officer and obstruction of justice related to numerous unprofessional sexual relationships with subordinates. Upon his retirement, Fiscus was reduced two grades, to colonel. Major General Jack Rives, the deputy judge advocate general, became the Air Force judge advocate general as of February 2006. On July 23, 2008, General Rives was confirmed as a lieutenant general, becoming the first TJAG to hold that rank.

On December 15, 2009, the president nominated Brigadier General Richard C. Harding to serve as the 16th judge advocate general. On February 2, 2010, the Senate Armed Services Committee endorsed the nomination and the Senate voted to confirm the nomination. Lieutenant General Rives retired on February 5, 2010, accepting the position of executive director and chief operating officer of the American Bar Association, and now-Lieutenant General Richard Harding became the 16th judge advocate general of the Air Force. His formal investiture and promotion ceremony occurred on February 23, 2010. General Harding&#x27;s term as the judge advocate general ended on January 31, 2014.

On May 22, 2014, the Senate confirmed Brigadier General Christopher F. Burne to serve as the 17th judge advocate general in the grade of lieutenant general. He was promoted and began duties as The Judge Advocate General on the following day. Lieutenant General Burne&#x27;s term as The Judge Advocate General ended on May 18, 2018.

On January 30, 2018, the Senate confirmed Major General Jeffrey A. Rockwell, who was then serving as deputy judge advocate general, to serve as the 18th judge advocate general in the grade of lieutenant general. That same day, the Senate also confirmed Brigadier General Charles L. Plummer to serve as Deputy Judge Advocate General in the grade of major general. Lieutenant General Rockwell&#x27;s formal investiture ceremony occurred on May 21, 2018.

== JAG School ==

The Air Force Judge Advocate General&#x27;s School was founded in 1950 and has been located in the William Louis Dickinson Law Center, at Maxwell Air Force Base in Montgomery, Alabama, since 1993. The school provides instruction to new judge advocates and paralegals, in addition to offering approximately 30 continuing legal education courses. The school publishes scholarly legal journals such as &quot;The Air Force Law Review&quot;, semiannually, and &quot;The Reporter&quot; online. The school also produces &quot;The Military Commander and the Law&quot;, a publication that is invaluable not only to judge advocates, but commanders and first sergeants in handling the myriad of legal issues that arise with a squadron or wing, and for the continued enforcement of good order and discipline.

<doc id="756812" wikidata="Q4035858" url="?curid=756812" title="Captain Skyhawk">
<text>Captain Skyhawk is a scrolling shooter video game developed by Rare for the Nintendo Entertainment System. The game was released in North America by Milton Bradley in June 1990 and in Europe by Nintendo in 1991. It was also released for arcades by Nintendo in 1990. It was based on a concept from Milton Bradley, with Rare being contracted to develop the game.

==Gameplay==
The game is reminiscent of Sega&#x27;s &quot;Zaxxon&quot;. The game features top-down scrolling overhead isometric graphics, including simulated 3D terrain. The terrain mimics the look of flight simulators available for the PC at the time. The game player is the pilot of the plane, code-named the F-14VTS (a fictional version of the F-14), and must avoid the mountainous terrain while annihilating aliens.

There are a total of nine missions in the game. The first seven have three objectives each while missions eight and nine have two objectives and one objective, respectively. Each level has multiple routes, some of which allow the player to bypass large gatherings of hostiles. The objectives vary across missions and include destroying an enemy base, dropping supplies, fighting aerial battles, picking up a scientist, and docking with a space station.

===Weapons===
The player can fire four types of weapons: Cannon, Phoenix Air Intercept Missiles, Maverick air-to-ground missiles, and Hawk bombs. The cannon is the only weapon with an unlimited supply. The rest of the weapons must be purchased between missions after docking with the space station. The purchases are made with credits obtained through the levels by destroying all aliens that are in a group. Purchasing additional cannons allows the player to fire much more rapidly.

===Level design===
Each main level in &quot;Captain Skyhawk&quot; is an isometric plane. After the boss of the stage is destroyed or the packages are delivered the player moves on to a rear-facing 2D screen where he must destroy the enemy planes to gain credits to buy weapons in the space station on the end of the levels. The last space station is replaced with the alien mother-ship.

==Story==
The player takes a role of a fighter pilot working to repel an alien invasion. Aliens have invaded Earth, and have built four land bases. These bases are designed to drain Earth&#x27;s energy and feed it to their mother space station. If the space station is allowed to obtain enough energy, it will destroy the Earth with a massive laser blast. The player must destroy the enemy bases, then go after the space station itself. Scientists, during the course of the game, are working on a top-secret Neutron Cannon. During several missions, the player must make supply drops to the scientists working underground. Sometimes, the aliens will have a scientist captive. Then the player must defeat the alien base and take the scientist to safety.

== Retrospective commentary ==

The game received positive retrospective reviews from online critics.

<doc id="756834" wikidata="Q606959" url="?curid=756834" title="Explorer of the Seas">
<text>Explorer of the Seas is a owned and operated by Royal Caribbean International, completed in 2000. She can accommodate over 3,000 guests, including scientists making use of a built-in atmospheric and oceanographic laboratory operated by the University of Miami&#x27;s Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric, and Earth Science. The lab, with its attendant educational and outreach programs for passengers, was discontinued in 2007.

==History==

The &quot;Explorer of the Seas&quot; was completed in 2000 and has the capacity of 3,000 passengers.
An automated system for gathering data was installed in 2008.) At launch, &quot;Explorer of the Seas&quot; had a tonnage of , exceeding that of her sister ship &quot;Voyager of the Seas&quot; by 32 GT and making her the world&#x27;s largest passenger ship. She held that record until being overtaken by &quot;Navigator of the Seas&quot; in 2002. In early 2015, &quot;Explorer of the Seas&quot; received major upgrades, including the replacement of the inline skating rink with a Flowrider surfing simulator and increasing her tonnage to 138,194 GT. The ship&#x27;s godmother is American athlete Jackie Joyner-Kersee.

In 2019 September, it was announced that the ship will get a refurbishment with $110 million in makeovers before its 2020 summer season. The refurbishment that was to take place under the amplification program in 2020 was delayed indefinitely due to the COVID-19 pandemic, instead only technical refurbishment took place.

In July 2021, the ship was used to house some rescue workers and other officials involved in the rescue and recovery effort of the Surfside condominium building collapse.

==Ports of call==

In fall 2014, she sailed 5 to 9 day Caribbean cruises out of Port Canaveral, Florida. After dry-dock refurbishment in the spring of 2015, &quot;Explorer&quot; began to sail Northern Europe, Mediterranean, and Madeira, Azores and Canary Islands itineraries out of Southampton, Hampshire, United Kingdom.

From November 2015 to 23 April 2016 &quot;Explorer of the Seas&quot; was based in Sydney, Australia, for the summer cruise season. A 24-day cruise relocated the ship to Seattle for the summer 2016 season. In 2019 January, the ship brought 4,000 passengers to Wollongong.

==Accidents and incidents==
===Rescue of &quot;Tumbleweed&quot;===
On 16 February 2008, while en route from Bayonne, New Jersey, on a nine-day cruise to the Caribbean the bridge crew heard a faint mayday call over the radio. This turned out to be the crew from &quot;Tumbleweed&quot;, a 39-foot sailing vessel, which had a planned sail from Baltimore to the Florida Keys. The crew reportedly had a mechanical breakdown of both engine and sails. The vessel drifted for 11 days to the location N32.35 W 72.49–roughly 275 miles southeast of North Carolina. &quot;Explorer of the Seas&quot; located and rescued the three men, who then departed the ship in Puerto Rico on 21 February 2008.

===Crew overboard===
On 5 May 2010, 26-year-old Assistant Waiter Mauritius Satianand Buddaru was caught on surveillance jumping overboard. The ship turned around to rescue him but was unable to locate the Assistant Waiter.

===&quot;Norwegian Star&quot; collision===
On 14 September 2012, &quot;Explorer of the Seas&quot; was moored in Bermuda when heavy winds pushed Norwegian Cruise Line&#x27;s &quot;Norwegian Star&quot; at its stern. Neither ship suffered any significant damage.

===Norovirus outbreak===
On 24 January 2014, 281 passengers and 22 crew members aboard &quot;Explorer of the Seas&quot; fell ill, reporting symptoms of vomiting and diarrhea. Due to the number of passengers sick, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention sent a Sanitation Program Officer and an epidemiologist to the ship on Sunday, 26 January 2014, when it was docked in St. Thomas. By 27 January 2014 the number of ill increased to 564 passengers and 47 crew members and a decision was made to end the cruise early. After &quot;Explorer of the Seas&quot; returned to port, 684 of the 4,237 aboard had symptoms of norovirus.

===Gastro outbreak===
On 16 December 2015, A total of 182 passengers out of the 3,566 on board Explorer of the Seas contracted infectious diarrhea. The ship&#x27;s operator contacted South Eastern Sydney Local Health District before arriving in Sydney at 6am. None of the passengers were taken to hospital. It was also on this cruise that all of the passengers on board experienced a freak storm on 15 December 2015. During this storm the ship experienced a crosswind of 150 knots (277.8 km/h) and the ship listed to the port side by 10 degrees.

On 4 November 2019, the ship was forced to delay her arrival back in Southampton due to the heavy storms battering Western Europe.

===Coronavirus pandemic===
During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that at least one passenger had tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 within 14 days of disembarking from the ship on its voyage from 8 to 15 March 2020.

=== Surfside search and rescue ===
After the June 2021 Surfside condominium collapse, the &quot;Explorer of the Seas&quot; was moored nearby to host nearly 600 search and rescue personnel assisting with the incident.

===Passenger overboard===
On 9 August 2024, an unnamed passenger from the United Kingdom fell overboard as the ship traveled from Santorini, Greece to Zadar, Croatia. Search efforts commenced, with the Croatian Coast Guard assisting, and a planned stop in Zadar was cancelled. The search was called off after four days.

=== Storm troubles ===
On November 7, 2024 a storm affected the ship near the Canary Islands, causing a 14.5º heel, some injuries and material damage.

<text>Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is a technique that combines the use of endoscopy and fluoroscopy to diagnose and treat certain problems of the biliary or pancreatic ductal systems. It is primarily performed by highly skilled and specialty trained gastroenterologists. Through the endoscope, the physician can see the inside of the stomach and duodenum, and inject a contrast medium into the ducts in the biliary tree and/or pancreas so they can be seen on radiographs.

ERCP is used primarily to diagnose and treat conditions of the bile ducts and main pancreatic duct, including gallstones, inflammatory strictures (scars), leaks (from trauma and surgery), and cancer.
ERCP can be performed for diagnostic and therapeutic reasons, although the development of safer and relatively non-invasive investigations such as magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) and endoscopic ultrasound has meant that ERCP is now rarely performed without therapeutic intent.

==Medical uses==
===Diagnostic===
The following represent indications for ERCP, particularly if or when less invasive options are not adequate or definitive:
* Obstructive jaundice – This may be due to several causes
** Gallstones with dilated bile ducts on ultrasonography
** Indeterminate biliary strictures and suspected bile duct tumors
** Suspected injury to bile ducts either as a result of trauma or of iatrogenic origin
** Sphincter of Oddi dysfunction
* Chronic pancreatitis is currently a controversial indication due to widespread availability of safer diagnostic modalities including endoscopic ultrasound, CT, and MRI/MRCP
* Pancreatic tumors no longer represent a valid diagnostic indication for ERCP unless they cause bile duct obstruction and jaundice. Endoscopic ultrasound represents a safer and more accurate diagnostic alternative

===Therapeutic===
ERCP may be indicated in the above diagnostic scenarios when any of the following are needed:
* Endoscopic sphincterotomy of the sphincter of Oddi
* Extraction of gallstones or other biliary debris
* Insertion of a stent through the major duodenal papilla and ampulla of Vater into the common bile duct and/or the pancreatic duct
* Dilation of strictures (e.g. primary sclerosing cholangitis, anastomotic strictures after liver transplantation)
* Extraction of liver flukes from the biliary system (e.g., opisthorchiasis, clonorchiasis, fasciolosis)

==Contraindications==

* Acute pancreatitis (unless persistently elevated or rising bilirubin suggests ongoing obstruction)
* (Irreversible) coagulation disorder if sphincterotomy planned
* Recent myocardial infarction or pulmonary embolism
* Severe cardiopulmonary disease or other serious morbidity

Hypersensitivity to iodinated contrast medium or a history of iodinated contrast dye anaphylaxis is not a contraindication of ERCP, though it should be discussed with your health provider, and you should tell them you are allergic to iodine, as an alternative contrast iodine-free material (&quot;dye&quot;) is then injected gently into the ducts (pancreatic or biliary) and x-rays are taken.

==Procedure==

The patient is sedated or anaesthetized. Then a flexible camera (endoscope) is inserted through the mouth, down the esophagus, into the stomach, through the pylorus into the duodenum where the ampulla of Vater (the union of the common bile duct and pancreatic duct) exists. The sphincter of Oddi is a muscular valve that controls the opening to the ampulla. The region can be directly visualized with the endoscopic camera while various procedures are performed. A plastic catheter or &quot;&quot; is inserted through the ampulla, and radiocontrast is injected into the bile ducts and/or pancreatic duct. Fluoroscopy is used to look for blockages, or other lesions such as stones.

When needed, the sphincters of the ampulla and bile ducts can be enlarged by a cut (sphincterotomy) with an electrified wire called a sphincterotome for access into either so that gallstones may be removed or other therapy performed.

Other procedures associated with ERCP include the trawling of the common bile duct with a basket or balloon to remove gallstones and the insertion of a plastic stent to assist the drainage of bile. Also, the pancreatic duct can be cannulated and stents be inserted.

The pancreatic duct requires visualisation in cases of pancreatitis. Ultrasound is frequently the first investigation performed on admission; although it has little value in the diagnosis of pancreatitis or its complications. contrast-enhanced computed tomography (MD-CECT) is the most used imaging technique. However, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offers diagnostic capabilities similar to those of CT, with additional intrinsic advantages including lack of ionizing radiation and exquisite soft tissue characterization.

In specific cases, other specialized or ancillary endoscopes may be used for ERCP. These include mother-baby and SpyGlass cholangioscopes (to help in diagnosis by directly visualizing the duct as opposed to only obtaining X-ray images) as well as balloon enteroscopes (e.g. in patients that have previously undergone digestive system surgery with post-Whipple or Roux-en-Y surgical anatomy).

==Risks==
One of the most frequent and feared complications after endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is post-ERCP pancreatitis (PEP). In previous studies, the incidence of PEP has been estimated at 3.5 to 5%. According to Cotton et al., PEP is defined as a &quot;clinical pancreatitis with amylase at least three times the upper limit of normal at more than 24 hours after the procedure requiring hospital admission or prolongation of planned admission&quot;. Grading of severity of PEP is mainly based on the length of hospital stay.

Risk factors for developing PEP include technical matters related to the ERCP procedure and patient-specific ones. The technical factors include manipulation of and injection of contrast into the pancreatic duct, cannulation attempts lasting more than five minutes, and biliary balloon sphincter dilation; among patient-related factors are female gender, younger age, and Sphincter of Oddi dysfunction. A systematic review of clinical trials concluded that a previous history of PEP or pancreatitis significantly increases the risk for PEP to 17.8% and to 5.5% respectively.

Intestinal perforation is a risk of any gastroenterologic endoscopic procedure, and is an additional risk if a sphincterotomy is performed. As the second part of the duodenum is anatomically in a retroperitoneal location (that is, behind the peritoneal structures of the abdomen), perforations due to sphincterotomies are retroperitoneal. Sphincterotomy is also associated with a risk of bleeding. ERCP may provoke hemobilia from trauma to friable hilar tumors or a guide-wire penetrating the bile duct wall, creating a biliary fistula. Delayed bleeding is a rare but potentially serious complication of sphincterotomy, particularly as many patients are discharged home within hours of ERCP.

There is also a risk associated with the contrast dye in patients who are allergic to compounds containing iodine, which can be very severe, even if the anaphylactoid reactions occur while you are in a hospital.

Oversedation can result in dangerously low blood pressure, respiratory depression, nausea, and vomiting.

Other complications (less than 1%) may include heart and lung problems, infection in the bile duct called cholangitis, that can be life-threatening, and is regarded as a medical emergency. Using antibiotics before the procedure shows some benefits to prevent cholangitis and septicaemia. In rare cases, ERCP can cause fatal complications.

Cases of hospital-acquired (i.e., nosocomial) infections with carbapenem resistant enterobacteriaceae linked to incompletely disinfected duodenoscopes have occurred in the U.S. since at least 2009 per the Food and Drug Administration. Outbreaks were reported from Virginia Mason Hospital in Seattle in 2013, UCLA Health System Los Angeles in 2015, Chicago and Pittsburgh. The FDA issued a safety communication &quot;Design of ERCP Duodenoscopes May Impede Effective Cleaning&quot; in February 2015, which was updated in December 2015, and more recently in 2022 which recommended disposable components.

Prevalence of vitamin K and vitamin D deficiency, as bile is to assist in the breakdown and absorption of fat in the intestinal tract; a relative deficiency of bile can lead to fat malabsorption and deficiencies of fat-soluble vitamins.

<doc id="756836" wikidata="Q1937573" url="?curid=756836" title="Ray Nance">
<text>Ray Willis Nance (December 10, 1913 – January 28, 1976) was an American jazz trumpeter, violinist and singer. He is best remembered for his long association with Duke Ellington and his orchestra.

== Early years ==
Nance was born in Chicago on December 10, 1913. He studied piano and violin as a child. In high school, he taught himself trumpet because “I wanted to hear myself on a louder instrument in way I couldn&#x27;t do with a violin in an orchestra.” He was the leader of his own band in Chicago from 1932 to 1937. An ad in a June 1933 prom book at the Edgewater Beach Hotel for the Staples Cafe, 6344 N. Broadway, Chicago shows &quot;Ray Nance and His Ebony Aces.&quot; Then, he worked with Earl Hines from 1937 to 1939; and from 1939 to 1940 he worked with Horace Henderson.

== Ellington tenure ==

Ellington hired Nance to replace trumpeter Cootie Williams, who had joined Benny Goodman, in 1940. Nance&#x27;s first recorded performance with Ellington was at the Fargo, North Dakota ballroom dance. Shortly after joining the band, Nance was given the trumpet solo on the earliest recorded version of &quot;Take the &quot;A&quot; Train&quot;, which became the Ellington theme. Nance&#x27;s &quot;A Train&quot; solo is one of the most copied and admired trumpet solos in jazz history. Indeed, when Cootie Williams returned to the band more than twenty years later, he would play Nance&#x27;s solo on &quot;A Train&quot; almost exactly as the original.

Nance was often featured on violin, and was the only violin soloist ever featured in Ellington&#x27;s orchestra (especially noteworthy is his violin contribution to the original 1942 version of &quot;The &#x27;C&#x27; Jam Blues&quot;). He is also one of the better known male vocalists associated with Ellington&#x27;s orchestra. On later recordings of &quot;It Don&#x27;t Mean a Thing (If It Ain&#x27;t Got That Swing)&quot;, Nance took the previously instrumental horn riff into the lead vocal, which constitute the line &quot;Doo wha, doo wha, doo wha, doo wha, yeah!&quot; He was often featured as vocalist on &quot;Jump for Joy,&quot; &quot;Just A-Sittin&#x27; and A-Rockin&#x27;&quot; and &quot;Just Squeeze Me (But Please Don&#x27;t Tease Me)&quot;. His multiple talents (trumpet, violin, vocals and also dancing) earned him the nickname &quot;Floorshow&quot;.

Nance was absent from the Duke Ellington Orchestra for three or four months in 1946, including the date of that year&#x27;s Carnegie Hall concert. In 1949, Nance participated, along with Ellington sidemen Russell Procope, Johnny Hodges and Sonny Greer on several Ivory Joe Hunter sessions, for King Records of Cincinnati.

== Post-Ellington years ==
He left Ellington in 1963 during their Middle East tour after having played alongside his returned predecessor Cootie Williams for a year. He continued to make several guest appearances in the orchestra over the years and later toured and recorded in England in 1974.

Nance made a few recordings as a bandleader, and also recorded or performed with Earl Hines, Rosemary Clooney, Jaki Byard, Chico Hamilton and others.

<text>Pervomartovtsy (; a compound term literally meaning &quot;those of March 1&quot;) were the Russian revolutionaries, members of &quot;Narodnaya Volya&quot;, planners and executors of the assassination of Alexander II of Russia (March 1, 1881) and the attempted assassination of Alexander III of Russia (March 1, 1887, also known as &quot;The Second First of March&quot;).

==March 1, 1881==
The assassination in 1881 was planned by Narodnaya Volya&#x27;s Executive Committee. Andrei Zhelyabov was the main organizer. After his arrest on February 27, he was replaced by Sophia Perovskaya.

Alexander II was killed on March 1, 1881 by a bomb, thrown by Ignacy Hryniewiecki. Hryniewiecki wounded himself fatally in the assassination; Nikolai Sablin committed suicide. Accomplices - Zhelyabov, Perovskaya, Nikolai Kibalchich, Hesya Helfman, Timofei Mikhailov, Nikolai Rysakov - were tried by the Special Tribunal of the Ruling Senate on March 26-29 and sentenced to death by hanging. On April 3, 1881 five Pervomartovtsy were hanged (except for Helfman, whose execution had been postponed due to her pregnancy. Her execution was later replaced with katorga (forced penal labor) for an indefinite period of time; she nevertheless died of a post-natal complication in prison). 

==March 1, 1887==
The second &quot;First of March&quot; was planned by members of the &quot;terrorist faction&quot; of &quot;Narodnaya Volya&quot;, including Aleksandr Ulyanov (brother of Vladimir Lenin). On March 1, 1887, they came to St. Petersburg&#x27;s Nevsky Prospekt with bombs and waited for the carriage of Tsar Alexander III to pass by. However, they were arrested on the spot before his arrival. All of the 15 accomplices - Aleksandr Ulyanov, Petr Shevyrev (main organizers), Pakhomiy Andreyushkin, Vasili Generalov, Vasili Osipanov (bombthrowers) and ten other people - were tried by the Special Senate Committee on April 15–19 and sentenced. The first five were hanged on May 8, 1887; the rest were sentenced to prison, banishment, or katorga.

<text>Trafalgar is a 1971 album by the Bee Gees. It was their ninth album (seventh internationally), and was released in September 1971 in the US, and November 1971 in the UK. The album was a moderate hit in the United States, and peaked at No. 34. The lead single &quot;How Can You Mend a Broken Heart?&quot; was the first Bee Gees&#x27; No. 1 single in the United States but failed to chart in Britain as did the album. It is Geoff Bridgford&#x27;s only full-length appearance on a Bee Gees album as an official member.

&quot;Trafalgar&quot; is included in Robert Dimery&#x27;s book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

==Recording==
In December 1970, barely more than two months after the group recorded their last session for the &quot;2 Years On&quot; album, they recorded &quot;Together&quot;, &quot;Over the Hill and Over the Mountain&quot;, &quot;Merrily Merry Eyes&quot; and &quot;When Do I&quot;. They returned to the studio with new backing band member, guitarist Alan Kendall, who would play on the majority of their subsequent albums. Several songs were recorded around this time which have not officially been released. All of the songs chosen for release were ballads. Recording began on 28 January 1971 with &quot;We Lost the Road&quot;, &quot;When Do I&quot; and &quot;How Can You Mend a Broken Heart&quot; (&quot;We Lost the Road&quot; was held over for use on the following album &quot;To Whom It May Concern&quot;). Recording continued through April with several demos and out-takes recorded but not released.

==Release==
With &quot;How Can You Mend a Broken Heart&quot; as the lead single from the album, &quot;Don&#x27;t Wanna Live Inside Myself&quot; was released as the second single but only reached No. 57 on the US charts. &quot;Israel&quot; was released as a single in the Netherlands and reached No. 22. The album&#x27;s cover depicts the battle of Trafalgar. Bridgford was credited on the sleeve notes on the original vinyl release as &quot;Jeoff Bridgford&quot;.

In support of the album, The Bee Gees toured the US in the fall of 1971, playing such cities as Boston, Asbury Park, New York City (7 shows), Memphis, Kansas City, and Indianapolis.

<doc id="756844" wikidata="Q1572484" url="?curid=756844" title="Halve Maen">
<text>Halve Maen (; ) was a Dutch East India Company &quot;jacht&quot; (similar to a carrack) that sailed into what is now New York Harbor in September 1609. She had a length of 21 metres and was commissioned by the VOC Chamber of Amsterdam in the Dutch Republic to covertly find a northern passage to Asia. The ship was captained by Henry Hudson, an Englishman in the service of the Dutch Republic.

In 1909, the Kingdom of the Netherlands presented the United States with a replica of &quot;Halve Maen&quot; to commemorate the 300th anniversary of Hudson&#x27;s voyage; the replica was destroyed in a fire in 1934. Over fifty years later, in 1989, the New Netherland Museum commissioned a second replica.

==History==
&quot;Halve Maen&quot; was built on a wharf on Rapenburg.

On behalf of the Dutch East India Company, she set sail from the Netherlands on April 6, 1609 under the command of the Englishman Henry Hudson to explore the northwest passage to the Pacific. After a severe storm in ice and snow in the North Cape, the expedition finally reached the Newfoundland Bank and what is now Canada. From Cape Sable, Hudson followed the eastern American coast south to the Delaware River, past Manhattan and Long Island. In the summer of 1609, Hudson sailed the Hudson River named after him to what is now Albany. Since Hudson could not find a passage to the Pacific this way, he returned to the Netherlands.

In his 1625 book &quot;New World&quot;, which contains invaluable extracts from Hudson&#x27;s lost journal, Johannes de Laet, a director of the West India Company, writes that they &quot;bent their course to the south until, running south-southwest and southwest by south, they again made land in latitude 41° 43’, which they supposed to be an island, and gave it the name of New Holland, but afterwards discovered that it was Cape Cod&quot;.

From there they sailed south to the Chesapeake Bay and then went north along the coast navigating first the Delaware Bay and, subsequently, the bay of the river which Hudson named the Mauritius River, for Holland&#x27;s Lord-Lieutenant Maurits. &quot;Halve Maen&quot; sailed up Hudson&#x27;s river as far as Kinderhook, and the ship’s boat with five crew members ventured to the vicinity of present-day Albany, New York, where the crew determined the water was too narrow and too shallow for further progress. Concluding then that the river was also not a passage to the west, Hudson exited the river, naming the natives that dwelled on either side of the Mauritius estuary the Manahata. Leaving the estuary, he sailed north-eastward, never realizing that what are now the islands of Manhattan and Long Island were islands, and crossed the Atlantic to England where he sailed into Dartmouth harbor with the Dutch East India Company ship and crew.

In 1618, or a few years after, the ship was destroyed during an English attack on Jakarta in the Dutch East Indies.

==Replicas==
=== 1909 replica ===
In 1909 a replica of &quot;Halve Maen&quot; was given to the United States by the Kingdom of the Netherlands on the occasion of the 300th anniversary of Hudson&#x27;s voyage. The ship was constructed at the &quot;Rijksmarinewerf&quot; in Amsterdam. The keel was laid on 29 October 1908, and on 15 April 1909 the ship was launched and then transported to the US on the Holland America Lines freight liner &quot;Soestdijk&quot; in order to attend the 1909 Hudson-Fulton Celebration in New York, arriving in July. She appeared in a parade with the American replica ship &quot;Clermont&quot; celebrating Robert Fulton. This replica was eventually towed to Cohoes, New York, and perished in a fire in 1934; the &quot;Clermont&quot; was broken up for scrap 3 years later.

===1989 replica===
Another replica of &quot;Halve Maen&quot; (officially Anglicized as &quot;Half Moon&quot;) was constructed in Albany, New York, in 1989 by the New Netherland Museum. The museum contracted with Nicholas S. Benton to design and build the replica. Benton, a master ship-rigger and shipwright, was president of the Rigging Gang of Middletown, Rhode Island, which specialized in colonial ship restoration and design. To prepare for building &quot;Half Moon&quot;, a $1 million project, he visited maritime museums in the Netherlands and the United States. After his death while assisting with the rigging of another vessel, the construction of the &quot;Half Moon&quot; was completed by the New Netherland Museum, following delays and additional expenses.

The year 2009 marked NY400, the 400th anniversary of &quot;Halve Maen&quot;&#x27;s voyage. For the anniversary, the crown prince of the Netherlands and his wife were on board, as well as students from a Dutch school. This anniversary was marked in September 2009 with festivals, music, sailing ships parading around New York Harbor.

A non-for-profit organization, &quot;Half Moon&quot; is run by a crew of volunteers that range in age from their teens to octogenarians.

In April 2015 the ship was transported on loan to the Westfries Museum in Hoorn, Netherlands. The replica took part in SAIL Amsterdam 2015. In 2019, the Hoorn Council decided not to renew their lease. Today, Halve Maen is located in the port of Enkhuizen and is open to the public at a permanent mooring.

=== Weathervane ===
At in both height and length, the model of &quot;Halve Maen&quot; on top of the SUNY System Administration Building in Albany, New York, is claimed to be the largest working weathervane in North America.

==In popular culture==
&quot;Halve Maen&quot; is mentioned in the 1819 story of Rip Van Winkle by Washington Irving, when the protagonist ventures into the Catskill Mountains and discovers Henry Hudson and the ship&#x27;s crew.

<text>James Stanley Hall (December 4, 1930 – December 10, 2013) was an American jazz guitarist, composer and arranger.

==Biography==
===Early life and education===
Born in Buffalo, New York, Hall moved with his family to Cleveland, Ohio, during his childhood. Hall&#x27;s mother played the piano, his grandfather played violin, and his uncle played guitar. He began playing the guitar at the age of 10, when his mother gave him an instrument as a Christmas present. At 13 he heard Charlie Christian play on a Benny Goodman record, which he calls his &quot;spiritual awakening&quot;. As a teenager in Cleveland, he performed professionally, and also took up the double bass. Hall&#x27;s major influences since childhood were tenor saxophonists Coleman Hawkins, Lester Young, Paul Gonsalves, and Lucky Thompson. While he copied out solos by Charlie Christian, and later Barney Kessel, it was horn players from whom he took the lead. In 1955, Hall attended the Cleveland Institute of Music, where he majored in composition, studying piano and bass in addition to theory.

===Early professional career===
In 1956, Hall moved to Los Angeles, where he studied classical guitar with Vicente Gómez. In 1955 and 1956, Hall played in Chico Hamilton&#x27;s quintet, a group associated with the cool jazz movement, and Hall&#x27;s playing began to gain attention from critics and fellow musicians.

Hall left Hamilton&#x27;s group to join another cool jazz ensemble, the Jimmy Giuffre Three, and he worked on and off with Giuffre from 1957 to 1960. Hall recorded his first solo album for Pacific Jazz in 1957, though the album made only a modest impact, and Hall did not get to record a follow-up until 1969.

During the late 1950s and early 1960s, Hall developed a preference for &quot;challenging arrangements and interactive improvisation in duos and trios.&quot; He taught at the Lenox School of Jazz in Massachusetts in the summer of 1959. Hall toured during the late 1950s with Jazz at the Philharmonic and worked around this time in Los Angeles with Ben Webster, appearing on Ben Webster at the Renaissance (recorded in 1960). During 1959, he recorded the first of six albums as a featured soloist with Paul Desmond. In 1960, Hall also toured and recorded with Ella Fitzgerald in Europe.

Hall moved to New York City around 1960 and began performing with band leaders including Lee Konitz (1960–61), Sonny Rollins (1961–62, 1964), and Art Farmer (1962–64). He formed a studio partnership with Bill Evans during this time, appearing on five albums with Evans from 1962 to 1966. Hall also worked as a studio guitarist for commercial recording dates during the early and mid-1960s. As a freelance studio musician, he appeared on albums by singers Big Joe Turner, Johnny Hartman, June Christy, Big Miller, and Freda Payne, as well as on commercially-oriented orchestral pop and jazz albums by Quincy Jones, Lalo Schifrin, Oliver Nelson, and Gary McFarland. His freelance jazz work in the 1960s covered a range of styles. He participated in cool jazz, bossa nova, and third stream albums led by John Lewis, Gerry Mulligan, Bob Brookmeyer, and Paul Desmond. Hall recorded bebop and hard bop sessions with Sonny Stitt, Nat Adderley, and Sonny Rollins. He recorded a soul jazz session with Hammond organist Paul Bryant.

In 1962, he led a trio with pianist Tommy Flanagan and bassist Ron Carter (who was replaced by Red Mitchell in 1965). Starting in 1963, Hall played in the studio orchestra at The Merv Griffin Show, working with Bill Berry, Bob Brookmeyer, Benny Powell, Art Davis and Jake Hanna.
In the late 1960s, Hall decided to leave his TV job and pursue a solo career more actively. He recorded and performed in Germany and Japan, appearing on the &quot;Berlin Festival Guitar Workshop&quot; LP (1968) alongside Barney Kessel and Baden Powell, and on the &quot;Guitar Genius In Japan&quot; LP (1970) alongside Kenny Burrell and Attila Zoller. The German MPS label recorded Hall&#x27;s second solo album, &quot;It&#x27;s Nice to Be With You&quot; in 1969. In 1971, he began recording for Milestone Records, whose co-founder Orrin Keepnews had produced several records with Hall when running his previous label, Riverside Records. While on Milestone, Hall recorded the first of three duet albums with Ron Carter. Moving to CTI Records, Hall made the 1975 &quot;Concierto&quot; album, which featured Paul Desmond and Chet Baker, and became a critical and financial success.

Hall was an arranger and composer, as much as a performer. He was known for developing motifs and using blues inflections. These characteristics are showcased in his 1975 album &quot;Jim Hall Live!&quot;, with Don Thompson and Terry Clarke. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, Hall recorded with pianist George Shearing, classical violinist Itzhak Perlman, and had a studio reunion with Art Farmer. He also continued recording in duos with Red Mitchell and Ron Carter until 1985.

===Later life and career===
Hall recorded steadily from the 1970s until 2010, releasing albums on the Horizon, Concord, MusicMasters, and Telarc record labels.

Hall continued to tour all over the world during these years. His band members included drummers Bill Stewart, Joey Baron and Andy Watson, bass players Scott Colley and Steve LaSpina, and keyboardists Gil Goldstein and Larry Goldings. At times, saxophonists Chris Potter and Greg Osby played in Hall’s groups as well. Some of these musicians are featured in Hall&#x27;s video &quot;Master Sessions with Jim Hall&quot; from 1993. Hall appeared as a guest soloist in Michel Petrucciani&#x27;s trio with Wayne Shorter in 1986 and performed at the Village Vanguard with Bill Frisell. In 1990, he hosted the JVC Jazz Festival New York, which also featured fellow guitarists Pat Metheny and John Scofield. After this, he played a number of duo concerts with Metheny. In 1994, Hall recorded a solo guitar album. Furthermore, in 1996, he returned to Europe to lead a quartet with saxophonist Joe Lovano.

In 1995, Hall was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Music from Berklee College of Music. In 1997, Hall received the New York Jazz Critics Award for Best Jazz Composer/Arranger. His pieces for string, brass, and vocal ensembles can be heard on his &quot;Textures&quot; and &quot;By Arrangement&quot; albums. His original composition, &quot;Quartet Plus Four&quot;, a piece for jazz quartet and string quartet featuring the Zapolski string quartet, was debuted in Denmark, where he was awarded the Jazzpar Prize.

His last orchestral composition was a concerto for guitar and orchestra, commissioned by Towson University in Maryland for The First World Guitar Congress, which debuted in June 2004 with the Baltimore Symphony. He was awarded an NEA Jazz Masters Fellowship award in January 2004. Hall was one of the first artists to join the fan-funded label ArtistShare and released &quot;Magic Meeting&quot; in 2005. In 2006, on behalf of the French Minister of Culture, Kareen Rispal, Cultural Counselor of the Embassy of France, bestowed Hall with the honor of Chevalier dans l&#x27;ordre des Arts et des Lettres, saying, in part, &quot;We honor you, Jim Hall, for expanding the musical universe, for your innovations and contributions to musical expression. We salute your ongoing experimentation which has been known countless times to bring people around the world together.&quot; In November 2008 the double album &quot;Hemispheres&quot; was released through ArtistShare, featuring fellow guitarist and former student Bill Frisell with Scott Colley (bass), Joey Baron (drums) and produced by Brian Camelio.

Hall performed in a project titled “The Live Project”, where he shared his music making process through ArtistShare as well as interviews with other musicians about his lasting influence. In 2010, Hall and Baron recorded a duo album entitled &quot;Conversations&quot;. In 2012 at the age of 81, Hall had gigs at the Blue Note in New York City and at a number of jazz festivals in the US as well as in Europe.

===Personal life===
Hall married Jane Hall (née Jane Herbert) on September 9, 1965. Jane, a psychoanalyst by profession, was also an occasional composer and singer. Hall recorded several of her compositions, including &quot;O Gato&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s Nice to Be with You&quot;, &quot;Where Would I Be?&quot;, &quot;Goodbye, My Love&quot;, &quot;The Answer Is Yes&quot;, and &quot;Something Tells Me&quot;.

Hall died in his sleep of heart failure in his Manhattan, New York apartment on December 10, 2013.

==Musical style==
&quot;Hall&#x27;s musical style develops with every new album and collaboration he engages in. His approach to music is unique – he views music as a way to break all barriers, not limited to music, as well as to share his discoveries with others.&quot; &quot;Music is a vehicle of peace for Hall and he therefore makes it a goal to reach out to others and communicate his music, teaching seminars all over the world. He is innovative and always interested in new modes of musical expression to further his ability.&quot;

Jim Hall insisted a lot on the aural aspect of improvising music, stating that &quot;Players should force themselves to hear something and then play it, rather than just do whatever comes under their fingers. I try to make my playing as fresh as possible by not relying on set patterns.&quot;

Hall&#x27;s tone has been described as mellow, warm, gentle, subtle, rich, and lightly amplified. Unlike other musicians, Hall&#x27;s work is not necessarily recognized by a signature riff but rather his expressive capabilities. As an arranger, his solos are aptly constructed, taking into account harmonic, melodic and rhythmic elements. They are composed with both feeling and technique with clarity as the ultimate goal.

Hall was a part of several groups that had unusual instrumentation in the context of jazz. In his first high-profile professional group, led by Chico Hamilton, Hall played alongside cellist Fred Katz in a group that did not feature a piano. Hall&#x27;s next group, the Jimmy Giuffre 3, was even more radical, having no drummer or piano, and in one incarnation, no bass player. Hall later played on two André Previn records with classical violinist Itzhak Perlman. Similar to Duke Ellington, the other artists on the record influence the composition and he creates music to showcase their talents as well. Furthermore, he is always open to what is new and what others are playing, including the guitar synthesizer.
Silence is as much a part of Hall&#x27;s music as is sound. Intimate settings, such as smaller clubs, showcase this strength. Hall &quot;carefully [chooses] a few notes instead, one after another, and placed them with the care of someone setting an elegant table.&quot; Although Hall is generally a leader, his excellent listening skills allow him to aid other musicians harmonically when required and staying silent when needed. Everyone is equal in Hall&#x27;s groups, he explains, &quot;each one of these guys is a creative, growing musician, and I treat them that way.&quot;

Exemplifying how Hall&#x27;s musical style and approach could clash with more pre-planned approaches is his collaboration with guitarist Pat Metheny (1999). The duo had met 30 years previously, when guitarist Attila Zoller brought 15-year-old Metheny to The Guitar, a club where Hall and bassist Carter had a standing position. Hall described the collaboration in a 2011 interview recorded for the Smithsonian Institution:


Reflecting Hall&#x27;s broad musical tendencies, the album contains originals by Hall, Metheny, mutual friends Steve Swallow and Zoller, and two standards. Hall and Metheny&#x27;s expertise and virtuosity allowed for much improvisation, usually spurred by mood, which led to different compositions,&quot;at times acoustic, soft, reverential, melodic, cacophonous, outlandish, humorous, and upbeat.&quot; Apart from Metheny, he influenced other then contemporary guitarists such as Bill Frisell, Mick Goodrick, John Scofield, and John Abercrombie.

==Awards and honors==
For many years Jim Hall was named “Best Jazz Guitarist” by both the Critics and the Readers in annual Downbeat Magazine Polls. His lengthy career has garnered him many laudatory endorsements from around the world, including:
* Danish Jazzpar Prize (1998), an award of international, cultural significance sometimes referred to as The Oscar or The Nobel Prize of Jazz.
* National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Master Fellowship (2004) 
* &quot;Choc de l&#x27;année&quot; Award (&quot;Jazzman&quot; – France) 2005 – Magic Meeting
* &quot;Choc de l&#x27;année&quot; Award (&quot;Jazzman&quot; – France) 2006 – Free Association 
* Chevalier dans l’Ordre des Arts et des Lettres (Knight in the Order of Arts and Letters) granted by the French Minister of Culture and Communication (January 2006).
* Downbeat Hall of Fame (2014) (&quot;Downbeat&quot;) 2014 

==Equipment==
Hall always used an extremely simple approach regarding his instruments. In the very beginning of his tenure with Chico Hamilton, he used a Gibson Les Paul Custom. He soon switched to the hollow-body electric Gibson ES-175 guitar. This guitar, which Hall used for many years with its original P-90 pickup, was used with a Gibson GA50 amplifier. By the early 1970s, Hall was using a Guild-brand humbucker pickup in his guitar. In the mid-to-late 1970s, luthier Jimmy D&#x27;Aquisto supplied Hall with a pair of archtop guitars, one of which was all-acoustic, and the other of which had an electric pickup, and Hall began to use these instruments professionally. Also in the 1970s, Hall started using solid-state amplifiers, including those made by Polytone, Walter Woods, and Roland. Hall started working with luthier Roger Sadowsky in 1982, initially using Sadowsky for repair and maintenance work. Eventually the two collaborated on Sadowsky&#x27;s Jim Hall Model guitar, a commercially available guitar based on Hall&#x27;s original D&#x27;Aquisto.

Hall used flatwound strings gauges 11, 15, 20 (unwound), 30, 40, 50 (from high E to low E) and picks of varying thickness whose usage depended on what part he was playing. He would usually use medium picks for playing melodies, a thin pick if he would play a calypso, or &quot;some kind of zany rhythmic thing&quot; and heavy picks for ballads. Hall sometimes used a Digitech whammy pedal.

When asked if he ever tried playing solid-body guitars again, he said: &quot;solid bodies are strange to me, I need to feel the body resonating&quot;.

<doc id="756877" wikidata="Q1811812" url="?curid=756877" title="Lee Hall (playwright)">
<text>Lee Hall (born 20 September 1966) is an English writer and lyricist. He is best known for writing the screenplay for the film &quot;Billy Elliot&quot; (2000) and the book and lyrics for its adaptation as a stage musical of the same name. In addition, he wrote the play &quot;The Pitmen Painters&quot; (2007), and the screenplays for the films &quot;War Horse&quot; and &quot;Rocketman&quot; (2019).

==Early life==
Hall was born in 1966 in Newcastle upon Tyne, the son of a house painter and decorator and a housewife. He was educated at Benfield School in Walkergate. As a youth he went to Wallsend Young People&#x27;s Theatre along with Deka Walmsley, Mark Scott 
and Trevor Fox. Walmsley later appeared in two of Hall’s works, &quot;Billy Elliot&quot; and &quot;The Pitmen Painters&quot;.

Hall attended Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge, where he studied English literature and was taught by poet Paul Muldoon. 

After leaving Cambridge, he first worked as a youth theatre fundraiser in Newcastle and at the Gate Theatre in London. In 1997, his playwriting career was launched with the broadcast of his radio play, &quot;Spoonface Steinberg&quot;, on BBC Radio 4.

==Career==
Hall&#x27;s most commercially successful work is &quot;Billy Elliot&quot;, the story of a North Eastern English boy who, in the face of opposition from his family and community, aspires to be a ballet dancer. The inspiration for the screenplay was drawn, in part, from the A. J. Cronin novel &quot;The Stars Look Down&quot;, which is also set in an English coal mining community during a strike, and similarly tells the story of a miner&#x27;s son who goes against the grain. The character Billy was also partly inspired by the renowned baritone Sir Thomas Allen who came from a similar background, having been born in the North East&#x27;s County Durham. Initially a 2000 film directed by Stephen Daldry, for which Hall wrote the screenplay, and for which he received an Academy Award nomination, &quot;Billy Elliot&quot; was later turned into a stage musical, with music by Elton John and lyrics by Hall. It enjoyed a long run in the West End and opened on Broadway in 2008. It won Hall the 2009 Tony Award for Best Book of a Musical.

Also successful was &quot;Spoonface Steinberg&quot;, the tale of a young autistic Jewish girl who is dying of cancer. The last in a quartet of radio plays entitled &quot;God&#x27;s Country&quot;, the monologue aroused an unprecedented listener response when it was broadcast in 1997 on BBC Radio. It was subsequently voted one of the ten best radio dramas of all time by readers of the magazine &quot;Radio Times&quot;. &quot;Spoonface Steinberg&quot; was adapted as a television play and into a one woman show starring 42-year-old actress Kathryn Hunter. The play opened in 1999 and later transferred to the West End.

Hall had more limited success with his comedy &quot;Cooking with Elvis&quot;, the protagonist of which is an Elvis Presley impersonator who has been paralyzed in a car crash. It was originally a 1995 radio play but it became a stage play in 1999. Hall&#x27;s fondness for moving from one medium to another can also be seen in his work &quot;I Luv You Jimmy Spud&quot;, which began as a 1995 radio play and was later adapted by Hall into a stage play and a film, &quot;Gabriel and Me&quot;, starring Billy Connolly and Iain Glen.

He has also translated plays by Carlo Goldoni, Bertolt Brecht and Herman Heijermans and co-written the screenplays for adaptations of Jane Austen&#x27;s &quot;Pride &amp; Prejudice&quot; and Kenneth Grahame&#x27;s &quot;The Wind in the Willows&quot;.

Hall&#x27;s play, &quot;The Pitmen Painters&quot;, inspired by art critic William Feaver&#x27;s book on the Ashington Group, premiered at the refurbished Live Theatre in Newcastle upon Tyne in 2007. It tells of a group of miners from Ashington, Northumberland, who decide to learn about art and begin to paint. The production later transferred to the National Theatre in London and opened on Broadway in September 2010. It won the 2008 Evening Standard Award for Best Play.

In 2011, controversy arose over a children&#x27;s opera that Hall had written, called &quot;Beached&quot;. The opera was commissioned by Opera North and was to have been performed by children from Bay Primary School in Bridlington, East Riding of Yorkshire. The story is about a gay retired painter, a single father who tries to spend a quiet day at the seaside with his son, but who is interrupted by children on a school trip, dogs, a landscape painter, an amateur dramatic society and others. After rehearsals had been going on for six months, the school threatened to pull the children out of the production if changes were not made to the libretto. Hall changed some words to accommodate their requests, but school officials, supported by Opera North, insisted on the removal of the words &quot;I&#x27;m queer&quot; and &quot;I prefer a lad to a lass,&quot; and other references to the character being gay. The school eventually agreed to let the children perform if Hall changed &quot;queer&quot; to &quot;gay.&quot;

Hall was the original writer on the screenplay for a film adaptation of Michael Morpurgo&#x27;s &quot;War Horse&quot;; he shares credit on the finished film with Richard Curtis, who was brought in by Steven Spielberg. His most recent TV work is an adaptation of Nigel Slater&#x27;s Autobiography &quot;Toast&quot;, starring Helena Bonham Carter and Freddie Highmore and set in Wolverhampton, West Midlands. First broadcast on BBC One in December 2010, &quot;Toast&quot; received a gala at the 2011 Berlin Film Festival and was released in cinemas on 11 August 2011. He also worked on the screenplay for the yet-to-release Working Title film &quot;Hippie Hippie Shake&quot;, based on Richard Neville&#x27;s memoir &quot;Hippie Hippie Shake: The Dreams, the Trips, the Trials, the Love-ins, the Screw Ups: The Sixties&quot;.

Hall&#x27;s other projects include a biopic of Elton John, &quot;Rocketman&quot;, released in May 2019, a stage musical adaptation of Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;The Wall&quot;, and a film adaptation of George Orwell&#x27;s 1933 memoir &quot;Down and Out in Paris and London&quot;.

==Personal life==
Hall married film director Beeban Kidron (Baroness Kidron) in 2003. Kidron is a child rights advocate who has played a determinative role in establishing standards for online safety and privacy across the world.

<text>James Scott Tamborello, (born 1975) also known by his stage name Dntel , is an American electronic music artist and DJ. Aside from his main solo project, Tamborello is also known as a member of the groups The Postal Service, Headset, Strictly Ballroom, and Figurine, where he is sometimes cited as James Figurine.

== Personal life ==
Tamborello&#x27;s father was a jazz saxophone player, flautist, and a songwriter for many Santa Barbara, California-based bands. His mother, Joyce Menges was an actress who starred in the sitcom &quot;To Rome with Love&quot; starring John Forsythe, Kay Medford, and Melanie Fullerton, in 1969, and later in the Walt Disney Productions film &quot;Now You See Him Now You Don&#x27;t&quot;, starring Kurt Russell, in 1972.

== Musical career and Dntel ==

Tamborello first began creating music in 1989, when he was in junior high school in Santa Barbara. His father bought him a drum machine, a sequencer, a keyboard and an eight track recorder, primarily for the possibility to create music on his own. Tamborello recorded an album under the name Antihouse in 1993, which was released the following year, then beginning work on the first Dntel EP. During these years, Tamborello attended Loyola Marymount University where he was a DJ and music director at KXLU. He engineered on several albums recorded at the station including &quot;KXLU LIVE: Volume 1,&quot; for which he also designed the album artwork. Tamborello was also the bass player for a band known as Strictly Ballroom. The band was often described as &quot;Enocore,&quot; as Brian Eno soundscapes were an important influence in their music. Strictly Ballroom recorded one album, &quot;Hide Here Forever&quot;, which was released in 1997 on the Waxploitation Records label. They released a single in 1995 titled &quot;Dear XXX&quot; on the Chou Chou records label.

A collection of the demos during the period of 1995 to 1997 was released as &quot;Early Works for Me If It Works for You&quot;, in 1998, and work from the first Dntel EP was released as &quot;Something Always Goes Wrong&quot;, in 2000, both on the Phthalo label. As a pioneer of contemporary glitch and electronica, Dntel gained a cult following. After writing a track for the &quot;Voices in My Lunchbox&quot; collaboration for the Plug Research label, he was asked to work with them. Tamborello released a 12-inch LP, &quot;Anywhere Anyone&quot;, in 2000.

Tamborello released the debut Dntel full-length album, &quot;Life Is Full of Possibilities&quot;, in 2001. The album featured several guest artists on vocals and instruments, including Ben Gibbard of Death Cab for Cutie, Mia Doi Todd, fellow Figurine member Meredith Figurine, Chris Gunst of Beachwood Sparks, Brian McMahan of Slint, The For Carnation, and Rachel Haden of that dog. The track &quot;(This Is) The Dream of Evan and Chan&quot; from the album was very well-received, which led to the song being released in 2002 as the only single from &quot;Life Is Full of Possibilities&quot;. A remix of the song by Superpitcher was voted the 17th best dance track of the decade by a Resident Advisor poll in 2010.

On April 24, 2007, Tamborello released his third album &quot;Dumb Luck&quot; on Subpop Records to generally positive critical reception. This, coinciding with Death Cab For Cutie&#x27;s release, &quot;Narrow Stairs&quot; moved any future plans of The Postal Service recording past the end of the decade. Tamborello released a surprise new album called &quot;Hate In My Heart&quot; on August 2, 2018, through Leaving Records.

== Figurine ==
Since 1994, Tamborello has also been a member of the electropop band Figurine. Consisting of Tamborello (as James Figurine), Meredith Figurine, and David Figurine, the trio were high school friends and created music based mostly on the theme of long-distance love, releasing their debut album, &quot;Transportation + Communication = Love&quot;, in 1999. The group released their second album, &quot;The Heartfelt&quot;, in 2001, and a remix album, &quot;Reconfigurine&quot;, in 2002.

Tamborello released a solo album under the name James Figurine, &quot;Mistake Mistake Mistake Mistake&quot;, in 2006, featuring a downtempo electronica style.

== The Postal Service ==

The success of the collaboration between Tamborello and Ben Gibbard on the song &quot;(This Is) The Dream of Evan and Chan&quot; from &quot;Life Is Full of Possibilities&quot;, which features lyrics and vocals from Gibbard, led the two to form their own side-project The Postal Service in 2001. The duo released their debut album, &quot;Give Up&quot;, in 2003 on Sub Pop Records, receiving very positive reviews from critics and eventual platinum certification from the Recording Industry of America. The album spawned the successful singles &quot;Such Great Heights&quot;, &quot;The District Sleeps Alone Tonight&quot;, and &quot;We Will Become Silhouettes&quot;. Along with additional member Jenny Lewis, who performed vocals on the album, the group toured in support of &quot;Give Up&quot; despite their main projects also being active at the time.

The Postal Service became largely inactive after 2005, until 2013 when the group reunited for a tour to celebrate the tenth anniversary of &quot;Give Up&quot;. However, on August 3, 2013, Ben Gibbard announced via Twitter that The Postal Service would permanently disband after the tour.

On December 9, 2009, Rolling Stone named the song &quot;Such Great Heights&quot; the 27th best song of the decade.

In December 2022, the group announced a 2023 tour co-headlining with Death Cab for Cutie to celebrate the twentieth anniversaries of &quot;Give Up&quot; and &quot;Transatlanticism&quot;.

== Other projects ==

Tamborello is also the host of a regular music show called &quot;Dying Songs&quot; heard on the internet radio station Dublab. In 2004, Tamborello was credited for programming on the song &quot;Take It Easy (Love Nothing)&quot; by Bright Eyes, which reached number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; US Singles Chart.

As Headset he collaborated with Plug Research record label owner Allen Avanessian and a number of guest rappers on the 2004 album &quot;Space Settings&quot;.

== Equipment ==

His studio has a glockenspiel, Avalon Design VT-747sp compressor, MicroKorg, Elektron Machinedrum, Vostok Matrixsynth, Elektron Monomachine, Vermona Retroverb, Empirical Labs EL8X Distressor Compressor, MOTU MIDI Timepiece, Vermona DRM1 MKII (drum machine), Dave Smith Poly Evolver Rack, Minimoog Voyager, two Motu 828 MKII, Mackie 1604 mixer, Kurzweil K2000 synthesizer, Jomox Xbase 999, Moogerfooger MF-104Z Analog Delay, DigiTech IPS33 Smartshift Intelligent Pitch Shifter, Nord Modular G1, an Omnichord, accordions, jingle bells, Line 6 Delay, and an M-Audio Radium MIDI controller.

<text>The Detroit Free Press (commonly referred to as the Freep) is a major daily newspaper in Detroit, Michigan, United States. It is the largest local newspaper owned by Gannett (the publisher of &quot;USA Today&quot;), and is operated by the Detroit Media Partnership under a joint operating agreement with The Detroit News, its historical rival. The Sunday edition is titled the &quot;Sunday Free Press.&quot;

The &quot;Free Press&quot; has received ten Pulitzer Prizes and four Emmy Awards. Its motto is &quot;On Guard for Years&quot;. In 2018, the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; received two Salute to Excellence awards from the National Association of Black Journalists.

==History==

===1831–1989: Competitive newspaper===
The newspaper was launched by John R. Williams and his uncle, Joseph Campau, and was first published as the &quot;Democratic Free Press and Michigan Intelligencer&quot; on May 5, 1831. It was renamed to &quot;Detroit Daily Free Press&quot; in 1835, becoming the region&#x27;s first daily newspaper. Williams printed the first issues on a Washington press he purchased from the discontinued &quot;Oakland Chronicle&quot; of Pontiac. It was hauled from Pontiac in a wagon over rough roads to a building at Bates and Woodbridge streets in Detroit. The hand-operated press required two men and could produce 250 pages per hour. The first issues were in size, with five columns of type. Sheldon McKnight became the first publisher, with his uncle John Pitts Sheldon as the editor.

In the 1850s, the paper was developed into a leading Democratic Party-aligned publication under the ownership of Wilbur F. Storey. Storey left for the &quot;Chicago Times&quot; in 1861, taking much of the staff with him. In the 1870s ownership passed to William E. Quinby, who continued its Democratic leanings and established a London, England edition.

In 1940, the Knight Newspapers (later Knight Ridder) purchased the &quot;Free Press&quot;. During the next 20 years, the &quot;Free Press&quot; competed in the southeastern Michigan market with &quot;The Detroit News&quot; and the &quot;Detroit Times&quot;, until the &quot;Times&quot; was purchased and closed by the &quot;Detroit News&quot; on November 7, 1960. The &quot;Free Press&quot; was delivered and sold as a night paper, with home deliveries made after 7:00pm until around 1966. A morning &quot;Blue Streak Edition&quot; was available at news stands beginning around 1965, meaning the &quot;Free Press&quot; actually printed two editions per day. During that period &quot;The Detroit News&quot; was sold and delivered as an afternoon newspaper.

===1989–present: Joint operating agreement===
In 1989, the paper entered into a one hundred-year joint operating agreement with its rival, combining business operations while maintaining separate editorial staffs. The combined company is called the Detroit Media Partnership. The two papers also began to publish joint Saturday and Sunday editions, though the editorial content of each remained separate. At the time, the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; was the tenth-highest circulation paper in the United States, and the combined &quot;Detroit News and Free Press&quot; was the country&#x27;s fourth-largest Sunday paper.
On July 13, 1995, Newspaper Guild-represented employees of the &quot;Free Press&quot; and &quot;News&quot; and the pressmen, printers and Teamsters working for the &quot;Detroit Newspapers&quot; distribution arm went on strike. By October, about 40% of the editorial staffers had crossed the picket line, and many trickled back over the next months while others stayed out for the two and a half years of the strike. The strike was resolved in court three years later, and the unions remain active at the paper, representing a majority of the employees under their jurisdiction.

In 1998, the &quot;Free Press&quot; vacated its former headquarters in downtown Detroit and moved to offices into &quot;The Detroit News&quot;″ building and began to operate from its new offices in that building on June 26 of that year.

On August 3, 2005, Knight Ridder sold the &quot;Free Press&quot; to the Gannett Company, which had previously owned and operated &quot;The Detroit News&quot;. Gannett, in turn, sold &quot;The News&quot; to MediaNews Group; Gannett continues to be the managing partner in the papers&#x27; joint operating agreement.

The &quot;Free Press&quot; resumed publication of its own Sunday edition, May 7, 2006, without any content from &quot;The News&quot;, other than that &quot;The News&quot; would print its editorial page in the Sunday &quot;Free Press&quot;.
On December 16, 2008, Detroit Media Partnership (DMP) announced a plan to limit weekday home delivery for both dailies to Thursday and Friday only. On other weekdays the paper sold at newsstands would be smaller, about 32 pages, and redesigned. This arrangement went into effect March 30, 2009.

The &quot;Free Press&quot; entered a news partnership with CBS owned-and-operated station WWJ-TV channel 62 in March 2009 to produce a morning news show called &quot;First Forecast Mornings&quot;. Prior to the partnership, WWJ aired absolutely no local newscast at all.

In February 2014, the DMP announced its offices along with those of the &quot;Free Press&quot; and &quot;The Detroit News&quot; would occupy six floors in both the old and new sections of the former Federal Reserve building at 160 West Fort Street. The partnership expected to place signs on the exterior similar to those on the former offices. The move took place beginning in October 2014.

===Ownership changes===
In June 2015, Gannett split itself into two companies. The company&#x27;s television broadcasters and digital publishers became part of a new company known as Tegna Inc. while its traditional print publishers became part of a new Gannett.

In November 2019, the newspaper announced it would cut four staff positions ahead of the GateHouse Media conglomerate completing its purchase of Gannett. The Gannett board finalized the purchase agreement on November 19, 2019.

In 2025, Gannett announced it will close the paper&#x27;s printing facility in Sterling Heights, Michigan with 115 jobs lost. The production of 32 newspaper will be transferred to other printing plants.

<text>The Detroit News is one of the two major newspapers in the U.S. city of Detroit, Michigan. The paper began in 1873, when it rented space in the rival &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; building. &quot;The News&quot; absorbed the &quot;Detroit Tribune&quot; on February 1, 1919, the &quot;Detroit Journal&quot; on July 21, 1922, and on November 7, 1960, it bought and closed the faltering &quot;Detroit Times&quot;. However, it retained the &quot;Times&quot; building, which it used as a printing plant until 1975, when a new facility opened in Sterling Heights. The &quot;Times&quot; building was demolished in 1978. The street in downtown Detroit where the Times building once stood is still called &quot;Times Square.&quot; The Evening News Association, owner of &quot;The News&quot;, merged with Gannett in 1985.

At the time of its acquisition of &quot;The News&quot;, Gannett also had other Detroit interests, as its outdoor advertising company, which ultimately became Outfront Media through a series of mergers, operated many billboards across Detroit and the surrounding area, including advertising displays on Detroit Department of Transportation and Southeastern Michigan Transportation Authority buses, with its only competitor, primarily along Metro Detroit&#x27;s freeway network, being 3M National Advertising (now Lamar Advertising).

&quot;The News&quot; claims to have been the first newspaper in the world to operate a radio station, station 8MK, which began broadcasting August 20, 1920. 8MK is now CBS-owned WWJ. In 1947, it established Michigan&#x27;s first television station, WWJ-TV, now WDIV-TV; it has been a primary NBC affiliate since sign-on, owing to WWJ-AM&#x27;s ties with the NBC Radio Network.

In 1989, the paper entered into a one hundred year joint operating agreement with the rival &quot;Free Press&quot;, combining business operations while keeping separate editorial staffs. The combined company is called the Detroit Media Partnership (DMP). The &quot;Free Press&quot; moved into &quot;The News&quot; building in 1998 and until May 7, 2006, the two published a single joint weekend edition. Today, &quot;The News&quot; is published Monday–Saturday, and has an editorial page in the Sunday &quot;Free Press&quot;.

&quot;The Detroit News&quot; has an online version, including a separate website for connections from European Union countries that does not track personal information.

&quot;The Detroit News&quot; has won three Pulitzer Prizes.

==History==
&quot;The Detroit News&quot; was founded by James E. Scripps, who, in turn, was the older half-brother and one-time partner of Edward W. Scripps. The paper&#x27;s eventual success, however, is largely credited to Scripps&#x27; son-in-law, George Gough Booth, who came aboard at the request of his wife&#x27;s father. Booth went on to construct Michigan&#x27;s largest newspaper empire, founding the independent Booth Newspapers chain (now owned by S.I. Newhouse&#x27;s Advance Publications) with his two brothers.

&quot;The Detroit News&quot; building was erected in 1917. It was designed by architect Albert Kahn, who included a faux-stone concrete building with large street-level arches to admit light. The arches along the east and south side of the building were bricked-in for protection after the 12th Street Riot in 1967. The bricked-in arches on the east and south ends of the building were reopened during renovations required when the &quot;Free Press&quot; relocated its offices there 20 years later.

In 1931, &quot;The Detroit News&quot; made history when it bought a three-place Pitcairn PCA-2 auto-gyro as a camera aircraft that could take off and land in restricted places and semi-hover for photos. It was the ancestor of today&#x27;s well-known news helicopter. In 1935 a single Lockheed Model 9 Orion was purchased and modified by Lockheed as a news camera plane for &quot;The Detroit News&quot;. To work in that role, a pod was built into the frontal leading edge of the right-wing about out from the fuselage. This pod had a glass dome on the front and a mounted camera. To aim the camera the pilot was provided with a primitive grid-like gun sight on his windshield.

Deb Price&#x27;s debut column in &quot;The Detroit News&quot; in 1992 was the first syndicated national column in American mainstream media that spoke about gay life.

On July 13, 1995, Newspaper Guild employees of the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; and &quot;The News&quot; along with pressmen, printers and Teamsters, working for the &quot;Detroit Newspapers&quot; distribution arm, went on strike. Approximately half of the staffers crossed the picket line before the unions ended their strike in February 1997. The strike was resolved in court three years later, with the journalists&#x27; union losing its unfair labor practices case on appeal. Still, the weakened unions remain active at the paper, representing a majority of the employees under their jurisdiction.

August 3, 2005, Gannett announced that it would sell &quot;The News&quot; to MediaNews Group and purchase the &quot;Free Press&quot; from the Knight Ridder company. With this move, Gannett became the managing partner in the papers&#x27; joint operating agreement. On May 7, 2006, the combined Sunday &quot;Detroit News and Free Press&quot; was replaced by a stand-alone Sunday &quot;Free Press&quot;. On December 16, 2008, Detroit Media Partnership announced a plan to limit weekday home delivery for both dailies to Thursday and Friday only. On other weekdays the paper sold at newsstands would be smaller, about 32 pages, and redesigned. This arrangement went into effect on March 30, 2009.


In February 2014, the DMP announced its offices along with those of &quot;The News&quot; and the &quot;Free Press&quot; would move from the West Lafayette building to six floors in both the old and new sections of the former Federal Reserve building at 160 West Fort Street. The partnership expected to place signs on the exterior similar to those on the former offices. The move took place October 24–27, 2014.

In December 2024, The Detroit News moved to the historic Albert Kahn-designed former Cadillac showroom at 6001 Cass Ave., which was built in 1920.

Editorially, &quot;The News&quot; is considered more conservative than the &quot;Free Press.&quot; However, it considers itself libertarian. In an editorial statement printed in 1958, &quot;The News&quot; described itself as consistently conservative on economic issues and consistently liberal on civil liberties issues. It has never endorsed a Democrat for president, and has only failed to endorse a Republican presidential candidate five times: twice during the Franklin D. Roosevelt era; in 2004, when it did not endorse George W. Bush for re-election; in 2016, when it endorsed Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson rather than Republican nominee Donald Trump, and in 2020, when it continued to withhold its endorsement from Trump and did not endorse a candidate.

==Staff==
The staff of &quot;The Detroit News&quot; includes editorial page columnists Nolan Finley, Kaitlyn Buss and Bankole Thompson; food critic Melody Baetens; sports columnists Bob Wojnowski and John Niyo; sportswriters Angelique Chengelis, Tony Paul, Chris McCosky, Rod Beard, David Goricki, Nolan Bianchi, Ted Kulfan and James Hawkins; auto critic Henry Payne and business columnist Daniel Howes.

The staff also includes metro reporter Robert Snell, who was named Michigan Journalist of the Year in 2014, 2018, and 2020 by the Detroit chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists.

<doc id="756924" wikidata="Q1700995" url="?curid=756924" title="Oswestry School">
<text>Oswestry School is an ancient public school (English independent boarding and day school), located in Oswestry, Shropshire, England. It was founded in 1407 as a &#x27;free&#x27; school, being independent of the church. This gives it the distinction of being the second-oldest &#x27;free&#x27; school in the country, between Winchester College (founded 1382) and Eton College (1440). (See also the article on early grammar schools.)

Due to the fact that these Renaissance schools focused heavily on subjects such as Latin grammar, Oswestry School has long been known locally as &#x27;The Grammar School&#x27; even during the period when Oswestry had modern state grammar schools. Oswestry School should also not be confused with other secondary schools in Oswestry, such as the Marches School.

One of the school&#x27;s earliest sites, dating from the 15th century, can still be seen adjacent to St Oswald&#x27;s Parish Church. It is currently used as the town&#x27;s visitor and information centre, incorporating a coffee shop and exhibitions.

The present-day senior school is located on Upper Brook Street and the junior school is based at Bellan House on Church Street. Bellan House Preparatory School was a completely separate institution until its amalgamation in the 1970s.

==History==
Oswestry School was founded in 1407 by David Holbache, Member of Parliament for Shropshire and Shrewsbury, and his wife Guinevere. They are also known by their Welsh names: Dafydd ab Ieuan and Gwenhwyfar ferch Ieuan.

Later in the 15th century it took up residence in the ancient half-timbered building close to the Parish Church of St Oswald. The school later attracted the attention of Queen Elizabeth I and Oliver Cromwell; the former gave to the school an endowment of &quot;forty shillings per annum&quot; to help with its running, and the latter dismissed the headmaster at the time for being a &quot;delinquent&quot; (too &quot;Royalist&quot;). Early archive records show that a small percentage of the subsidised school-fees was set aside to pay for cockfighting, the pupil entertainment of that time.

Changes to the governance of the school in the mid-17th century saw a gradual transition from the lay trustees to a group of lay and clerical governors headed by the Bishop of St Asaph, who, from that time on, would appoint the Headmaster. Henceforth, these would be ordained men, a tradition which would extend into the 20th century.
Increasing numbers in the mid-18th century meant a move for the school to its present site on land next to the battlefield where in 642 AD King Oswald was defeated by King Penda. The Georgian building was constructed in 1776 on land leased (and later bought) from a local landed aristocrat. Its closest neighbour, the neo-Gothic Victorian chapel, built in 1863, stands looking across at St Oswald&#x27;s Maes-y-llan battlefield, now the school&#x27;s extensive playing fields.

A major change took place in 1972: with the admission of girls, the school became co-educational. Shortly after this, the local pre-preparatory school, Bellan House, was taken over, thereby eventually allowing the school to offer education spanning the widest possible range – now 4 years up to 18. Previously, Oswestry School solely admitted boys. Alumni of Oswestry School are referred to as Old Oswestrians.

Oswestry School celebrated its 600th anniversary in 2007.

Douglas Robb, who was headmaster from 2010 to 2014, had taught at Prince Edward School in Zimbabwe and developed links between the two schools.

==Houses==
Oswestry School has had numerous houses over the years, including both &#x27;competitive&#x27; and &#x27;residential&#x27; houses. At different eras the house might have identified a pupil as day/boarder, boy/girl, or junior/senior. There are currently three boarding houses: School House, Holbache and Guinevere. Senior boarders and day pupils now mingle in the &#x27;competitive&#x27; houses: Burnaby, Donne, Oswald and Spooner. Here are just some of the current and historical houses:

*Burnaby - Formerly a competitive house for day students, now mixed
*Donne - Formerly a competitive house for day students, now mixed
*Guinevere - A boarding house for girls situated at The Quarry
*Holbache - This started life as a senior boys&#x27; boarding house on Welsh Walls, acquired following WWII. It had previously been the old Cottage Hospital and was reputed to have retained its beds, warmth and ghosts. This building has since been redeveloped as apartments. In January 2006 it reopened on school grounds as home to sixth form boys. It has been both a residential and a competitive house.
*Oswald - Formerly a competitive house for boarders, now mixed
*School House - A boarding house for boys up to 5th form, based in the oldest part of the present school buildings, which date from 1776. 
*Spooner - Formerly a competitive house for boarders, now mixed

==School Song==
In the 19th century, an Old Oswestrian wrote the school&#x27;s Latin song, &#x27;Hymnus Oswestriensium&#x27;, which is informally known by its first words, &#x27;Gaude Plebs&#x27;.

&#x27;Gaude Plebs&#x27;, though written for Oswestry School, also became the official song of the nearby Moreton Hall School. Moreton Hall was founded in 1913 by the widow and daughters of Oswestry&#x27;s late headmaster, John Jordan Lloyd-Williams. It primarily educated girls, who were not then eligible to attend Oswestry School.

The song is as follows:

&quot;Gaude, plebs redemptionis&quot;
&quot;Gaude, tantis aucta bonis&quot;

&quot;Dei beneficio;&quot;

&quot;Omni labi propulsata&quot;

&quot;Mens exultet, provocata&quot;

&quot;Linguae ministerio.&quot;

&quot;Pro defunctis te laudandum&quot;

&quot;Pro viventibus, orandum,&quot;

&quot;Celebramus, domine.&quot;

&quot;Tu rem publicam beasti,&quot;

&quot;Tu maiores secundasti,&quot;

&quot;Noster et sis hodie.&quot;

&quot;Agimus pro fundatore&quot;

&quot;Et pro multo largitore&quot;

&quot;Grates laeto pectore.&quot;

<doc id="756937" wikidata="Q752561" url="?curid=756937" title="The Roxy (Covent Garden)">
<text>The Roxy was a fashionable nightclub located at 41–43 Neal Street in London&#x27;s Covent Garden, known for hosting the flowering British punk music scene in its infancy.

==History==
The premises had formerly been used as a warehouse to serve the Covent Garden wholesale fruit and vegetable market. In 1970 they were converted to a late-night bar called the Chaguaramas Club. At that time it was owned by record producer Tony Ashfield, who had several hits with 1970s reggae star John Holt, with whom he formed a company called Chaguaramas Recording Productions, probably after Chaguaramas Bay in Trinidad.

The Roxy was started by Andrew Czezowski, Susan Carrington and Barry Jones, by suggestion of Chelsea singer Gene October, to convert the club into London&#x27;s first live punk rock venue. The space was small, and spread out on two levels, which contained little more than a bar and a dance floor.

In December 1976, Czezowski organised three gigs at the Roxy. They financed the venture with borrowed money (Jones, a musician, pawned his guitar to stock the bars, and hire sound equipment, etc.). The first show, on 14 December, was Generation X, a band Czezowski managed. The second on the following night was the Heartbreakers. The third, on 21 December, featured Siouxsie and the Banshees and Generation X. However, it was the Clash and the Heartbreakers that headlined the official gala opening on 1 January 1977 which was filmed by Julien Temple and finally screened on BBC Four on 1 January 2015 as &quot;The Clash: New Year&#x27;s Day &#x27;77&quot;.

Don Letts was the resident DJ at the club and he was instrumental in encouraging punk rockers to embrace reggae.

In 1977, Harvest Records released an album &quot;Live at the Roxy WC2&quot;, featuring some of the regular acts who performed there. The original 12-track album reached No. 24 in the UK Albums Chart and spent five weeks in the chart. A further live album was released in May 1978 of lesser known acts such as the UK Subs, Open Sore, Crabs and the Bears. Since the late 1980s, a number of previously unreleased recordings of Roxy gigs from the late 1970s have been released as live albums including the Buzzcocks (Trojan 1989), the Adverts (Receiver, 1990), X-Ray Spex (Receiver, 1991), and the Boys (Receiver, 1999).

DJ Letts recorded many of the band performances in 1977 at the Roxy, some of which were released the following year as &quot;The Punk Rock Movie&quot;.

The anarcho-punk band Crass featured the Roxy as the subject of one of their most well known tracks, &quot;Banned from the Roxy&quot;, in 1978.

==Site==

The site later became the flagship store for the swimwear brand Speedo.

On Tuesday 25 April 2017, a &#x27;People&#x27;s Plaque&#x27; was unveiled by the Seven Dials Trust and invited unveilers - Andrew Czezowski and Susan Carrington, the founders of the ROXY (with Barry Jones), Gaye Black (The Adverts), Pauline Murray (Penetration), Tessa Pollitt (The Slits) and Jordan Mooney (who worked for Malcolm McLaren and Vivienne Westwood&#x27;s Sex (boutique)/Seditionaries shop on the King&#x27;s Road). The plaque is at first-floor level on Neal Street, marking the site of &#x27;The Roxy: legendary punk club, 1976–78&#x27;. Andrew Czezowski and Susan Carrington, guests and members of the original bands who played at the club then went onto attend the PV of &#x27;Fear &amp; Loathing at the ROXY&#x27; an exhibition of photographs taken mainly during the club&#x27;s first 100 nights, commissioned by Shaftesbury Plc and curated by artist and historian Jane Palm-Gold. The exhibition comprised the works of Derek Ridgers, Ray Stevenson, Jeremy Gibbs and Rebecca Hale and ran for 3 weeks.

<doc id="756944" wikidata="Q5214365" url="?curid=756944" title="Dan Senor">
<text>Daniel Samuel Senor (, ; born November 6, 1971) is an American columnist, writer, and political adviser. He was chief spokesman for the Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq and senior foreign policy adviser to U.S. presidential candidate Mitt Romney during the 2012 election campaign. A frequent news commentator and contributor to &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, he is co-author of the book &quot;Start-up Nation: The Story of Israel&#x27;s Economic Miracle&quot; (2009) and &quot;The Genius of Israel: The Surprising Resilience of a Divided Nation in a Turbulent World&quot; (2023). He is married to television news personality Campbell Brown.
==Early life and education==
Senor was born in Utica, New York, and grew up in Toronto, Ontario, the youngest of four children. His father, Jim, worked for Israel Bonds; his mother, Helen, was from Košice, now in Slovakia, where she and her mother hid from the Nazis during the Holocaust. Helen Senor&#x27;s father was murdered at the Auschwitz concentration camp. After the war, Helen and her mother fled to Paris, then via New York to Montreal. Senor said that his mother&#x27;s post-Holocaust trauma &quot;was very heavy for us growing up&quot;. Senor graduated from Forest Hill Collegiate Institute and then studied at the University of Western Ontario before moving onto Hebrew University and Harvard Business School.

==Career==

===Early career===

Senor spent much of the 1990s working as a staffer on Spencer Abraham&#x27;s (R-MI) 1994 Senate campaign and then in his Capitol Hill office. He later worked for Senator Connie Mack III (R-FL) and at AIPAC. During that time, he caught the attention of &quot;Weekly Standard&quot; editor William Kristol, who introduced him to the neoconservative group affiliated with George W. Bush.

From 2001 to 2003, he was an investment banker at the Carlyle Group.

===Iraq===

In the lead-up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq and during the fighting, Senor was a Pentagon and White House adviser based in Doha, Qatar, at U.S. Central Command Forward; he was subsequently based in Kuwait, working with General Jay Garner during the final days of the invasion and was in southern Iraq when the Saddam Hussein regime fell.

According to Rajiv Chandrasekaran, the author of &quot;Imperial Life in the Emerald City&quot;, Senor was known for the zealous spin that put a good face on the disaster unfolding in Baghdad (the Iraq War did not end until December 2011). Some statements he made to the press did not reflect the actual situation in the city.

Senor formally re-located to Baghdad on April 20, 2003. He traveled with General Garner&#x27;s team in the first American post-war civilian protection unit, becoming one of the first American civilians to enter Baghdad after the fall of the regime. In Iraq, Senor served as Chief Spokesperson for the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA), as Senior Advisor to Ambassador L. Paul Bremer, and as adviser to the Office of Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance. In the U.S., he was &quot;a regular television fixture in the immediate aftermath of the 2003 Iraq invasion&quot;, thus becoming &quot;the face of the Bush Administration&#x27;s efforts in Iraq&quot;.

Senor remained in Iraq until the summer of 2004. His 15 months working for the CPA from Baghdad made him one of the longest-serving American civilians in Iraq at the time. For his service, he was awarded the Department of Defense Distinguished Civilian Service Award, one of the Pentagon&#x27;s highest civilian honors.

==&quot;Start-up Nation&quot;==
Senor is the co-author, with his brother-in-law, &quot;Jerusalem Post&quot; columnist Saul Singer, of &quot;Start-up Nation: The Story of Israel&#x27;s Economic Miracle&quot;. The book, published in November 2009, examines the entrepreneurial economy of Israel and the cultural and social environment that supports this economy. &quot;It&#x27;s a book about Israel that&#x27;s not for Jews,&quot; Senor has said. &quot;I didn&#x27;t want it to be in the Judaica section of the bookstore, or the Israel or the Middle East section.&quot; Instead, the book is typically found in the Business section of the bookstore. The book has provoked a wide range of responses, from reviews that hail its research and its portrayal of often-neglected facets of Israeli society, to reviews that claim the book implicitly justifies never-ending conflict in the region. Senor and Singer have been praised for the effectiveness with which they have &quot;translat[ed] Israel&#x27;s own image of itself for an international audience&quot;; their book&#x27;s title has entered the language as shorthand descriptive term for Israel. The book inspired the creation of Start-Up Nation Central, a non-profit organization based in Tel-Aviv.

===Other professional activities===
Senor was an Adjunct Senior Fellow for Middle East Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations. He hosted two investigative documentaries on Iraq and Iran for Fox News, where he is a contributor. He has written work published by &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, and has authored pieces for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, the &quot;New York Post&quot;, and &quot;The Weekly Standard&quot;. He currently serves on the advisory board for nonprofit America Abroad Media.

Senor was a member of the honorary delegation that accompanied President George W. Bush to Jerusalem in May 2008 for the celebration of Israel&#x27;s 60th anniversary.

In March 2010, national Republican leaders encouraged Senor to run against freshman New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand in the 2010 United States Senate election in New York. Senor was reported to be seriously considering a challenge, but ultimately decided against it. He said in a statement it &quot;wasn&#x27;t the right time in my family and business life for me to run.&quot; Instead, he established a new think tank, the Foreign Policy Initiative, along with William Kristol and Robert Kagan.

&quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; ran an article in September 2009 in which Senor praised President Obama for having &quot;doubled down his commitment&quot; to the war in Afghanistan. &quot;There should therefore be no stronger advocates for Mr. Obama&#x27;s Afghanistan strategy than the GOP,&quot; he wrote. In a 2011 &quot;Journal&quot; op-ed, Senor accused Obama of having &quot;built the most consistently one-sided diplomatic record against Israel of any American president in generations&quot;; he returned to the same theme in a &quot;Journal&quot; piece the next year.

In May 2020, Senor started the podcast &quot;Call Me Back&quot; in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The podcast delves into global affairs, economics, culture, and technology, linking current events to their historical contexts. The podcast is part of the Ark Media podcast network.

==Role in the Romney campaign==
In 2012, Senor served as a foreign policy adviser to U.S. presidential candidate Mitt Romney. &quot;The two of them hit it off immediately,&quot; Romney chief of staff Beth Myers said. &quot;I can&#x27;t think of anyone who Mitt has ever met that he hit it off with so immediately as Dan Senor.&quot; Romney&#x27;s July 2012 trip to Israel was described as the &quot;brainchild&quot; of Ron Dermer, Benjamin Netanyahu&#x27;s chief strategist, &quot;and, Dan Senor&quot;. Senor brought to the campaign a network of close ties to Israel, including his sister Wendy Singer, who runs the Jerusalem office of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee.

Senor stirred controversy when he told journalists that if Israel launched a strike on Iran&#x27;s nuclear facilities, Romney &quot;would respect&quot; the move.

Senor praised Romney in an August 2012 op-ed for &quot;USA Today&quot; as &quot;a longstanding supporter of the Jewish state&quot; who &quot;sees in Israel&#x27;s heroic story a mirror of the heroism that America&#x27;s Founding Fathers exhibited when, against all odds, they fought for independence and self-government&quot;. Senor said in September 2012 that Obama&#x27;s failure to overthrow President Assad of Syria made the U.S. look &quot;impotent&quot;.

In August 2012, &quot;Politico&quot; said that if Romney were elected, Senor &quot;would likely get a top West Wing job, perhaps deputy chief of staff or even national security adviser&quot;. He gave &quot;intensive coaching&quot; to vice presidential candidate Paul Ryan for the latter&#x27;s debate with Vice President Joe Biden in October 2012.

===Post election===
After Romney lost the November election to Obama, Senor&#x27;s criticism of leading Republicans for being fair-weather friends to the candidate, cheering him as &quot;iconic&quot; before the election and &quot;eviscerating&quot; him afterward, was widely reported.

==Personal life==
In April 2006, Senor married Campbell Brown, editor in chief of The 74, a nonprofit education news website, who was then weekend anchor of &quot;Today&quot; on NBC and host of &quot;Campbell Brown&quot;, formerly on CNN. They have two children. His father-in-law is former Louisiana Insurance Commissioner and Secretary of State James H. &quot;Jim&quot; Brown, a Democrat. His mother remains a resident of Toronto.

<doc id="756961" wikidata="Q3137595" url="?curid=756961" title="Islam in Malaysia">
<text>Islam in Malaysia is represented by the Shafi‘i school of Sunni jurisprudence. Islam was introduced to Malaysia by traders arriving from Persia, Arabia, China and the Indian subcontinent. It became firmly established in the 15th century. In the Constitution of Malaysia, Islam is granted the status of &quot;religion of the Federation&quot; to symbolize its importance to Malaysian society, while defining Malaysia constitutionally as a secular state. Therefore, other religions can be practiced legally, though freedom of religion is still limited in Malaysia.

Malaysia is a country whose most professed religion is Islam. As of 2020, there were approximately 20.6 million Muslim adherents, or 63.5% of the population.

Various Islamic holidays such as Eid al-Fitr, Eid al-Adha and Mawlid have been declared national holidays alongside Christmas, Chinese New Year, and Deepavali.

==Background==

The draft Constitution of Malaysia did not specify an official religion. This move was supported by the rulers of the nine Malay states, who felt that it was sufficient that Islam was the official religion of each of their individual states. However, Justice Hakim Abdul Hamid of the Reid Commission which drafted the constitution came out strongly in favour of making Islam the official religion, and as a result the final constitution named Islam as the official religion of Malaysia. All ethnic Malays are Muslim, as defined by Article 160 of the Constitution of Malaysia.

===Religion of the Federation===
Nine of the Malaysian states, namely Kelantan, Terengganu, Pahang, Kedah, Perak, Perlis, Selangor, Johor, and Negeri Sembilan have constitutional Malay monarchs (most of them styled as Sultans). These Malay rulers still maintain authority over religious affairs in states. The states of Penang, Malacca, Sarawak, and Sabah do not have any sultan, but the king (Yang di-Pertuan Agong) plays the role of head of Islam in each of those states as well as in each of the Federal Territories of Kuala Lumpur, Labuan, and Putrajaya.

On the occasion of Malaysia&#x27;s first prime minister Tunku Abdul Rahman&#x27;s 80th birthday, he stated in the edition of 9 February 1983 of the newspaper &quot;The Star&quot; that the &quot;country has a multi-racial population with various beliefs. Malaysia must continue as a secular State with Islam as the official religion&quot;.Four of Malaysia&#x27;s states, Kelantan, Terengganu, Kedah, and Perlis, are governed by Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS), which is a conservative Islamic political party, with a proclaimed goal of establishing an Islamic state. 

The newest format of the Malaysian identity card (&quot;MyKad&quot;) divides Malaysians into various religious groups, e.g., Muslim, Christian, Hindu, Buddhist. The introduction of this card caused a political uproar and remains controversial.

There is also an Islamic university in Malaysia called the International Islamic University Malaysia, and a government institution in charge of organising pilgrimages to Mecca called Tabung Haji (Pilgrim Fund Board of Malaysia). In addition, the government also funds the construction of mosques and &quot;suraus&quot;.

The Department of Islamic Development Malaysia (JAKIM) was established under the Prime Minister&#x27;s Department. Besides, every state also has its own version of JAKIM. Various Islamic rules and regulations governing the public and family life were codified into law that is compliant to Islam. Government policies have also be permissible in Islam, in other words &#x27;halal&#x27;.

The National Fatwa Council was established by Conference of rulers to issue fatwas. It conducts two types of meetings, one was authorised by the Conference of Rulers, another called &quot;muzakarah&quot; (discourse) is held occasionally without the order of the Conference of Rulers.

==History==
Islam was also brought to Malaysia by Arab Muslim and Tamil Indian Muslim traders in the 12th century. It is commonly held that Islam first arrived in the Malay peninsula when Sultan Mudzafar Shah I of Kedah (Phra Ong Mahawangsa), the first Kedah ruler to convert to Islam in 1136 CE after being introduced to it by Indian traders who themselves were recent converts. However, the recent discovery of a Muslim tombstone in Pahang which has been dated to 419 H (1028 CE) suggests Islam&#x27;s presence in the Malay world much earlier, however the majority of those inscriptions were about foreign Muslims. In the 19th century, the Terengganu Inscription Stone was found in Kuala Berang, Terengganu, highlighting the evidence of Islam in the Malay state, the stone is dated to either the year 1303 or 1383. Sultan Megat Iskandar Shah, previously known as Parameswara prior to his conversion, is the first Sultan of Melaka in the early 15th century. He converted to Islam after marrying a princess from Pasai, of present-day Indonesia.

The religion was adopted peacefully by the people of the coastal trading ports in modern-day Malaysia and Indonesia, absorbing rather than conquering existing beliefs. Islam gradually spread from coastal ports to the hinterland, by the 17th century the majority of people in the Malay Peninsula had converted to Islam.

===Contemporary Islam===
Contemporary Islam follows the Shafi‘ite school of Sunnism. Some Islamic terms, such as the word &quot;Allah&quot; (Arabic for &quot;God&quot;), are forbidden to non-Muslims both orally and in writing. The government ban on the use of the word &quot;Allah&quot; by non-Muslims reversed the 2009 ruling of a court of first instance.

Until the 1970s, many Malay Muslims followed a liberal and moderate Islam, like Indonesian Muslims. At this time, a wave of Islamisation emerged (sparked by various social and ethnic conflicts, linked to the Al-Arqam parties and Islam Se-Malaysia), so that today, Malaysia lives in a more Islamic environment compared to the earlier years. Malays, who represent 50.4% of the total population, are almost all Muslims. About 70% of Malay Muslim women wear headscarves, but was marginal until the 1980s. The traditional Malay garment, of Islamic origin, is also worn by many Malays.

===Freedom of worship===
Article 3 (1) of the Malaysian Constitution provides:

Article 11 of the constitution provides:

Originally authorised for the country&#x27;s independence in 1957, apostasy became illegal following an amendment to the country&#x27;s constitution in 1988. The internationally reported attempt by Lina Joy to convert from Islam to Christianity is one of the most famous representations.

While this was not a problem during the colonial era, Muslims wishing to change their religion face severe deterrence. Before 1988, the question of freedom of religion and therefore of questions relating to the desire of citizens to change their religion was exclusively within the jurisdiction of secular courts. But since the law has changed, an amendment stipulates that secular courts no longer have the right to deal with claims by Muslims and that only Islamic Shariah courts have jurisdiction to discuss issues related to human rights. Apostasy is one of them and it follows that it is constitutionally legally impossible for a Muslim to change his belief.Many Muslims who have changed their religion, whether it is conversion to Buddhism, Christianity, Sikhism, Taoism and other beliefs, are forced for their own safety to lead a double life. In some cases, denunciations of apostasy have already been reported as being reported to the authorities by family members or co-workers.

In February 2014, Edry Faizal, a coordinator in charge of the Democratic Action Party, claimed that it was inconsistent from a Quranic point of view to forbid Muslims from freely changing beliefs, but from his point of view was the best alternative that the power had found to preserve its Malaysian electorate and consequently to remain in power continuously.

In May 2014, Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak said during his speech about the future of the country that: &quot;We will never tolerate any demand for the right to apostasy by Muslims, and we refuse that Muslims can have the right to be tried by courts other than sharia courts, and we will not allow Muslims to participate in LGBT activities&quot;. But he concluded that this was necessary because: &quot;This is in line with our efforts to make Malaysia a modern, progressive Muslim country in order to achieve the status of a developed nation with a high income for 2020&quot;.

In recent years, more and more voices have been asked to try to determine the number of ethnic Malay people supposed to have left Islam. The government has remained silent on the question, believing that it is much too controversial to be debated. However estimates go from 135, according to Ridhuan Tee, a Muslim preacher, to 260,000, according to Harussani Zakaria, the mufti of the state of Perak. The latter highest estimate when put in the context of the 2010 population census would make them between 3 and 4% of the Malaysian majority. Nevertheless, no data estimating the number of Malay who converted to another religion was provided.

Nonetheless, these remarks later triggered a polemic often repeated in the media by Islamist and nationalist circles that recognising the right of the Malayans and the entire Muslim community to be free to choose their own beliefs would risk provoking a &quot;Massive exodus of apostates&quot; within the nation, the same slogan has also been listed on the official website of Islam in Malaysia. On 17 December 2015, Malaysian Police Chief Tan Sri Khalid Abu Bakar during a speech, alluded to this mysterious report: &quot;I can not tell you how much this issue is potentially explosive. &quot;

===Religious discrimination===
The state banishes and sanctions non-Muslim proselytism, but encourages conversions to Islam and remunerates them in order to facilitate the reduction of the non-Muslim population within the nation. Among the new rights provided to converts, if a man has children, he has the right to convert his children to Islam, without having to consider the approval of his wife.

In March 2015, unrest erupted in Miri, Sarawak, when a 13-year-old Dayak schoolgirl complained to the police, along with her parents, after being sequestrated at her school by two of her teachers who wanted to convert her to Islam by forcing her to recite Shahada. The latter then rewarded his conversion by donating 250 ringgit. In order to ease interfaith tensions, the two teachers were subsequently fired and transferred out of the state of Sarawak.

On 4 December 2015, Malaysian feminist and human rights activist, Shafiqah Othman Hamzah wrote, &quot;What we are living in Malaysia is almost no different from apartheid. While segregation was racial in South Africa, in our country we live in religious segregation.&quot; She criticised some politicians and community leaders for leading to &quot;a multi-racial and multi-religious country, but it is with a heavy heart that I say we are not in harmony.&quot;

On 9 February 2016, the Putrajaya Federal Court ruled on a scandal termed the &quot;S Deepa Affair&quot; dating back to 4 September 2013, involving forced conversions of children to Islam in a Hindu couple married since 2003. In this case, the father N. Viran converted to Islam in November 2012 under the name of Izwan Abdullah decided to impose his conversion to his two children, his son Mithran and his daughter Sharmila. Shortly after that, the children had their names changed to Nabil for the son and Nurul Nabila for the girl. Becoming the only person judged capable of raising them, he had obtained from the Shari&#x27;a court of Seremban their sole custody and through this the dissolution of his marriage.

Their marriage, which had been celebrated according to the Hindu rites and subsequently registered in the civil registers, was thus dissolved by the Shari&#x27;a court on the sole ground of the conversion to Islam by the husband, making it immediately obsolete. However, the Seremban High Court ruled that the annulment of the marriage was illegal and decided to return the custody of the children to the mother on 7 April 2014.

However, two days later Izwan kidnapped his son during a home visit by his ex-wife. Deepa quickly requested the High Court for police aid in getting her son back. Izwan decided to appeal the decision by the Seremban High Court and sought the help from the Shari&#x27;a court to assert his rights. The Court of Appeal rejected both appeals in December 2014. Child custody in February 2016 was finally divided by the Court of Appeal. The guard of the son was entrusted to the father, in this case, Izwan and the guard of the daughter to the mother, S Deepa. Asked by the media at the announcement of the verdict, she announced in tears: &quot;This is injustice, I am upset. It was my last hope that the court would return my two children, but it was not so. Only my daughter was given to me.&quot;

===Influences of Zheng He&#x27;s voyages===

Zheng He, a 14th and 15th century Chinese explorer, is credited to have settled Chinese Muslim communities in Palembang and along the shores of Java, the Malay Peninsula, and the Philippines. These Muslims allegedly followed the Hanafi school in the Chinese language. This Chinese Muslim community was led by Yan Ying Yu, who urged his followers to assimilate and take local names.

==Denominations==
===Sunni Islam===
The Sunni Islam of the Shafi&#x27;i school of thought is the official, legal form in Malaysia, although syncretist Islam with elements of Shamanism is still common in rural areas. Mosques are an ordinary scene throughout the country and azan (call to prayer) from minarets are heard five times a day. Government bodies and banking institutions are closed for two hours every Friday so Muslim workers can conduct Friday prayer in mosques. However, in certain states such as Kelantan, Terengganu, Kedah and Johor, the weekends fall on Friday and Saturday instead of Saturday and Sunday. It has been introduced to several states, notably Kelantan and Terengganu, all businesses close for 2 hours on every Friday for prayers. Failure to comply would result in fines.

Since it is compulsory for Muslims to perform a prayer 5 times a day no matter where they are, almost all public places, including shopping malls, hotels, condominiums, usually have allocated spaces called &quot;Surau&quot;, for performing the Muslim prayers.

In 2017, it was reported that Wahhabism is spreading among Malaysia&#x27;s elite, and that the traditional Islamic theology currently taught in Government schools is gradually being shifted to a view of theology derived from the Middle East, particularly Saudi Arabia.

===Shia Islam===
The Malaysian government has strict policies against other Islamic sects, including a complete ban on Shia Islam, allegedly to &quot;avoid violence between the two faiths that has sometimes broken out in other parts of the world by promoting only the Sunni faith&quot;. Due to decades of Saudi funding, Shia Islam is openly and freely demonised and Shia Muslims are oppressed in the country, their prayers and gatherings are broken up, and the state secret service allegedly engages in Shia forced disappearances. Anti-Shi&#x27;ism reaches such an extent that the mainstream media often present Iran in a bad light while often glorying Saudi Arabia. For example, in 2019 Malaysian police raided multiple private functions commemorating the martyrdom of Husayn ibn Ali at the battle of Karbala, arresting scores of foreign and local Shia Muslims. While the true numbers are not known, the number of Malaysian Shia Muslims is estimated at around 250,000.

===Other sects===
A notable sect that has been outlawed is Al-Arqam.

Muslims who believe Mirza Ghulam Ahmad to be the fulfilment of the Islamic prophecies concerning the return of Jesus, the Ahmadiyya, are also present. There are approximately 2,000 Ahmadis in the country. Though small in number, they face state sanctioned persecution in Malaysia, as they do elsewhere in the Muslim world.

Muslims who reject the authority of Hadith, known as Quranists, Quraniyoon, or Ahl al-Quran, are also present in Malaysia. The most notable Malaysian Quranist is the scholar Kassim Ahmad.

==Cultural role==

Islam is central to and dominant in Malay culture. A significant number of words in the Malay vocabulary can trace their origins to Arabic which is the common language of Islamic prayer and rituals. This is, however, not exclusive and words from other cultures such as Portuguese, Chinese, Dutch, Sanskrit, Tamil, English, and French can also be found in the Malay language. Islam is so ingrained in Malay life that Islamic rituals are practised as Malay culture. Muslim and Malays are interchangeable in many daily contexts.

Hari Raya Aidilfitri (Eid ul-Fitr) is an important festival celebrated by Malaysian Muslims.

Muslim women generally wear the &quot;tudung&quot; (hijab or headscarf) over their heads. However, Malay women not wearing any headgear are not reprimanded or penalised. Prominent Malaysian female examples are Rafidah Aziz, International Trade and Industry Minister and Siti Hasmah Mohamad Ali, wife of then Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir bin Mohamad. However, with the influx of Arabic travellers, foreign Muslim women (Arabs) wearing hijab that leave only their eyes exposed are often spotted in tourist attractions, not the least at the shopping malls. At certain Malaysian institutions such as the International Islamic University, wearing of the tudung is mandatory; however, for non-Muslim students this usually amounts to a loosely worn piece of cloth draped over the back of the head.

Some regard the &quot;tudung&quot; to be an indication of Arabic influence in Malay Muslim culture, and point to incidents such as the banning of the traditional Malay &quot;wayang kulit&quot; in the state of Kelantan (which was ruled by the Islamist PAS) to be &quot;un-Islamic&quot;.

Malaysia&#x27;s top Islamic body, the National Fatwa Council, ruled against Muslims practising yoga, saying it had elements of other religions that could corrupt Muslims.
The same body has ruled against ghosts and other supernatural beings.

==Political issues==
===Definition of Malay===
As defined by the Constitution of Malaysia, Malays must be Muslim, regardless of their ethnic heritage; otherwise, legally, they are not Malay. Consequently, apostate Malays would have to forfeit all their constitutional privileges, including their Bumiputra status, which entitles them to affirmative action in university admissions and discounts on purchases of vehicles or real estate. It is legally possible to become a Malay if a non-Malay citizen with a Malaysian parent converts to Islam and thus claims all the Bumiputra privileges granted by Article 153 of the Constitution and the New Economic Policy (NEP). However, the convert must &quot;habitually speak the Malay language&quot; and adhere to Malay culture. A tertiary textbook for Malaysian studies following the government-approved syllabus states: &quot;This explains the fact that when a non-Malay embraces Islam, he is said to &quot;masuk Melayu&quot; (&quot;become a Malay&quot;). That person is automatically assumed to be fluent in the Malay language and to be living like a Malay as a result of his close association with the Malays&quot;.

Islam in Malaysia is thus closely associated with the Malay people, something some have criticised, for example saying that Malaysian Islam is &quot;still clothed in communal garb; that Muslims in Malaysia have yet to understand what the universal spirit of Islam means in reality&quot;.

===Sharia legal system===
Parallel to the civil courts, there are Sharia courts which conduct legal matters related to Muslim family sphere. Legal issues like Muslim divorce and Muslim apostasy are conducted in the Syariah Courts. However, there are cases whereby apostasy cases are tried in the Federal Courts. Non-Muslims are not bound by Sharia.

===Accusations of &quot;Christian agendas&quot;===
Accusations of prosleytization have been used regularly by various Muslim politicians against Christians in order to court support from the Malays. There have been many instances of attacks on the Christian faith and they all point to political agendas by Malay-Muslim political parties.
During the campaign for the 2022 Malaysian General Elections, Muhyiddin Yassin, the leader of Perikatan Nasional warned that his opponents were agents of a Jewish and Christian agenda out to colonize Malaysia.
==Clothing==

As of 2013, most Muslim Malaysian women wear the tudung, a type of hijab. This use of the tudung was uncommon prior to the 1979 Iranian Revolution, and the places that had women in tudung tended to be rural areas. The usage of the tudung sharply increased after the 1970s, as religious conservatism among Malay people in both Malaysia and Singapore increased.

Several members of the Kelantan ulama in the 1960s believed the hijab was not mandatory. However, in 2015 the majority of Malaysian ulama believed this previous viewpoint was un-Islamic. The National Fatwa Council has issued a ruling against young Muslim women wearing trousers.

Norhayati Kaprawi directed a 2011 documentary about the use of tudung in Malaysia, &quot;Siapa Aku?&quot; (&quot;Who am I?&quot;).

Despite the hijab, or tudung being non-mandatory in Malaysia, some government buildings enforce within their premises a dresscode which bans women, Muslim and non-Muslim, from entering while wearing &quot;revealing clothes&quot;.

In 2014, the feminist Muslim organization Sisters in Islam was named in a fatwa by the Selangor Islamic Religious Council. They had previously supported Muslim women who attempted to compete in the Miss Malaysia pageant before four had to withdraw.
==Distribution of Muslims==
According to the 2020 census, 63.5% of its population (20,623,140 people) were Muslim. Malays are officially defined as Muslims by virtue Article 160 in the Federal Constitution. Census from the Malaysian state of Sabah may also show higher proportion of Muslims due to mass Islamicization programmes in the 1970s and early 1980s and high presence of Muslim immigrants from Indonesia and the Philippines.

<doc id="756967" wikidata="Q3445725" url="?curid=756967" title="The Roxy (New York City)">
<text>The Roxy (sometimes Roxy NYC) was a popular nightclub and former disco roller rink located at 515 West 18th Street in New York City. 

Located in the Chelsea section of Manhattan, it began as a roller disco in 1978, founded by Steve Bauman, Richard Newhouse and Steve Greenberg. It was acquired in 1985 by Gene DiNino. 

The Roxy shut down permanently in March 2007.

== Operation ==
Beginning in the early 1980s, the owners began hosting private party nights. Referred to by many as the &quot;Studio 54 of roller rinks&quot;, these parties thrived for several years. Then, as the popularity of skating began to fade, the space was revamped into a dance club in June 1982 by Ruza Blue whose idea it was to transform the roller rink into a dance club.

The Roxy hosted a party for the famed Olympic gold medal-winning USA Ice Hockey team in 1980.

Ruza Blue, nicknamed &quot;Kool Lady Blue&quot;, produced the first multi-racial, multi-cultural Hip Hop dance clubs in New York City. She was the founder of Club Negril (1981–82) and The Roxy where she showcased elements of Hip Hop plus more for the first time downtown in a nightclub environment on a regular weekly basis and this is where true Hip Hop first gained recognition. Her clubs featured a mash up of all musical styles from early hip hop, electro, funk, soul, disco, rock, punk, dub and electronic dance music. Jon Baker, the future founder of Gee Street Records, worked the door. Hip hop pioneers such as Grand Mixer D.ST Jazzy Jay and Afrika Bambaataa began DJing there and Kool Lady Blue sponsored breaking or b-boy/b-girl competitions featuring the Rock Steady Crew, Graffiti Artist Murals, Emcees like Fab 5 Freddy hosting the nights and she even had the genius idea to book Double- exhibitions by The Fantastic Four local American Double Dutch League champions and added Double Dutch to the Hip Hop equation at Negril and The Roxy.

Artists such as Madonna, Run DMC, Kraftwerk, Shannon, Malcolm McLaren, New Edition, Kurtis Blow, The Beastie Boys, Yello, Dead or Alive, Cher, Bette Midler, Whitney Houston, Liza Minnelli, Chaka Khan, Donna Summer, Cyndi Lauper, Jorge Perez Evelyn,Grace Jones, Yoko Ono, LL Cool J, Lisa Marie Presley, Gloria Gaynor, and George Clinton and the P-Funk All-Stars all performed at the Roxy.

The site of many &quot;dance floor tests&quot; by recording artists, producers and remixers, the club&#x27;s notoriously discerning, racially mixed clientele and cross cultural ethos was considered the ideal crowd to inspire on the dance floor. It was here that DJ&#x27;s first played the test record of EBN-OZN&#x27;s white rap/spoken word &quot;AEIOU Sometimes Y&quot; in 1982, the first commercially released record made on a computer in the United States.

Kool Lady Blue&#x27;s Friday nights at The Roxy played a huge role in the evolution of Hip Hop and Electronic Dance Music and are integral to Hip Hop history. She was also one of the first to promote Hip Hop culture on to the world stage.

The Roxy hosted one of New York City&#x27;s largest weekly gay dance nights, &quot;Roxy Saturdays&quot;, promoted by John Blair Promotions, which featured many famous DJs including Junior Vasquez, Manny Lehman, Hex Hector, Victor Calderone, David Guetta, Frankie Knuckles, Paul van Dyk, Offer Nissim, Hector Fonseca and Peter Rauhofer.

During the late 1980s, it was operated under the name &quot;1018&quot;, and was closed down in 1989 by the New York City Office of Midtown Enforcement as a nuisance, based on allegations of underaged drinking, drug sales, and violence.

==Closure==
Roxy had stopped for several weeks in the fall of 2006, but resumed operation once again on December 2, 2006. The club closed its doors for good on March 10, 2007. A documentary about the club&#x27;s final party, entitled &quot;Roxy: The Last Dance&quot; premiered in August 2008 on the LOGO cable television network.

There were plans for the club to be demolished in order to make room for new residential apartments. However, in July 2008, there was news that the Roxy would reopen under new management. The local community board that represents the interests of the residents near the club have stated that the club could reopen if it served the community in the long run.

As of September 2017, the building is undergoing demolition to make way for high-end residential condominiums overlooking the adjacent High Line Park. 

In September 2021, Lantern House luxury residential condominiums opened where The Roxy once stood. 


==In popular culture==
A performance at the club by Afrika Bambaattaa was captured in the 1984 film &quot;Beat Street&quot;.

<doc id="756970" wikidata="Q691161" url="?curid=756970" title="Division bell">
<text>In some of the Commonwealth realms, a division bell is a bell rung in or around parliament to signal a division (a vote) to members of the relevant chamber so that they may participate. A division bell may also be used to signal the start or end of parliamentary proceedings, and often produces different sounds or coloured lights to identify the chamber affected.

== In the United Kingdom ==

In the United Kingdom, division bells are used in the immediate neighbourhood of the Palace of Westminster (housing Parliament) to signal that a division is occurring and that members of the House of Commons or of the House of Lords have eight minutes to get to their chosen division lobby to vote for or against the resolution. The call for a division is also displayed on annunciator screens throughout the Palace of Westminster. The division bells are also sounded at the start of a daily sitting, at the end of the two-minute prayers that start each day, and when the house rises. Division bells have been used in this way in the United Kingdom since 1858.

As of 2014, there were 384 division bells within the Parliamentary estate, and 172 outside it. Bells outside of the parliamentary estate are undergoing a phase out as of 2021.

Some Members may be in nearby offices, restaurants, pubs or shops, and therefore some of these establishments have their own division bells connected to those in the Houses of Parliament. MPs including Alec Douglas-Home, Michael Portillo and Michael Heseltine reportedly had division bells fitted in their homes.

Though the Commons and Lords share division bells, they are driven from separate ringing generator systems, so that the bells make noticeably different ring patterns for a division of the House of Commons and a division of the House of Lords.

The generator for the House of Commons simultaneously sounds all the division bells with a 2 Hertz signal (i.e., twice per second) for exactly eight minutes, though this has been varied by the House of Commons in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. As soon as the bells stop, the door keepers manning the entrances to the two division lobbies close and lock the doors. Any member who has failed to enter the lobby in time has lost the opportunity to vote in that division. Thus anywhere within an eight-minute journey of the Palace of Westminster is often said to be in the &quot;division-bell area&quot;.

A broadcast of the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Antiques Roadshow&quot; in October 2007 from the Banqueting House in Whitehall featured the original Ringing Generator System Number 1 from the House of Commons. The programme&#x27;s expert, Paul Atterbury, with the help of former House of Commons Speaker Baroness Betty Boothroyd, demonstrated the apparatus in use with one of the original Division Bells. The show valued the transmitter at £15,000.

Three Ringing Generator Systems were made at the end of the 19th century by the GPO at the request of the Government. They were numbered 1, 2 and 3. Numbers 2 and 3 were destroyed by a bomb in 1941 and replaced with copies bearing the numbers 4 and 5. Number 5 generator exists, but the whereabouts of number 4 is not known. The current generator is entirely electronic.

===External division bells===

There are 172 division bells located outside the Palace of Westminster, in nearby government offices and even MP&#x27;s private residences. Public establishments fitted with division bells (as of 2013) include:
The bells are connected by telephone lines, and proprietors of these establishments are responsible for the maintenance of the bells.

== In Australia ==

Both State and Federal Parliament buildings use electronic division bells. In most states with bicameral parliaments, and in the Federal Parliament, red and green lights near the division bells flash to indicate which house is being called. Queensland and the Territories, which have unicameral parliaments, do not require the red light which indicates the upper house. In the Parliament of New South Wales, the division bell rings differently for divisions in the Assembly and the council.

The bells are typically rung at the beginning of a sitting, because a member has challenged a vote (called a division), or because there are not enough members in the chamber to constitute quorum.

=== Federal Parliament ===
In both the Senate and the House of Representatives, the division bell is normally rung for four minutes, unless successive divisions are taken with no debate between, in which case they ring for one minute only. After this period has elapsed, the doors to the chamber are locked, and the vote takes place. The duration of the bell was increased to four minutes following the move to Parliament House in 1988, and is measured by in the House of Representatives using a sandglass. On one occasion, a young Paul Keating was furiously censured by his party’s whip for missing a division. Keating made the excuse that he could not hear the division bell in his office, when in fact he had simply turned it down.

== In Canada ==

The electronic bell of the House of Commons sounds to call members of the House for a sitting, a vote, or to announce the lack of a quorum. In the case of a vote, it is referred to as the division bell.

The Ontario Legislative Assembly makes use of an electronic voting bell, combined with visual lights, to indicate an upcoming vote. Bells are spread throughout the legislative building and rung for either 5, 10, or 30 minutes, depending on the nature of the vote.

<doc id="756973" wikidata="Q2492102" url="?curid=756973" title="Henry Pelham-Clinton, 5th Duke of Newcastle">
<text>Henry Pelham Fiennes Pelham-Clinton, 5th Duke of Newcastle-under-Lyne, (22 May 181118 October 1864), styled Earl of Lincoln before 1851, was a British politician and aristocrat. He sat in Parliament for South Nottinghamshire
(1832–46) and for Falkirk Burghs (1846–51) until inheriting the dukedom.

Newcastle held several key offices in the mid-19th century, including Chief Secretary for Ireland, Secretary of State for the Colonies, and Secretary of State for War and the Colonies. In 1855, he resigned as Secretary of State for War owing to disastrous casualties during the Crimean War.

==Background==
Newcastle was the son of Henry Pelham-Clinton, 4th Duke of Newcastle-under-Lyne, by his wife Georgina Elizabeth, daughter of Edward Miller-Mundy. He was educated at Eton and Christ Church, Oxford, where he took his B.A. degree in 1832, and was created a D.C.L. in 1863.

==Political career==
Newcastle was returned to Parliament for South Nottinghamshire in 1832, a seat he held until 1846, and then represented Falkirk Burghs until 1851, when he succeeded his father in the dukedom. Initially a Tory, he served under Sir Robert Peel as First Commissioner of Woods and Forests from 1841 to 1846 and as Chief Secretary for Ireland in 1846, as the effects of the Great Irish Famine began to take hold. He was admitted to the British Privy Council in 1841, and to the Irish Privy Council on 14 February 1846.

Newcastle joined the Peelites in 1846, and held office in Lord Aberdeen&#x27;s coalition government as Secretary of State for War and the Colonies between 1852 and 1854, and as Secretary of State for War and Secretary at War between 12 June 1854 and 1 February 1855, when he resigned over the Crimean War.

From 18 June 1859 to April 1864, he served as Secretary of State for the Colonies in Lord Palmerston&#x27;s Liberal administration. In 1860, while holding this office, he went to Canada and the United States, in company with the Prince of Wales. Apart from his political career he also held the honorary posts of Lord Lieutenant of Nottinghamshire from 1857 to 1864 and Lord Warden of the Stannaries from 1862 to 1864. He was made a Knight of the Garter on 17 December 1860.

Lord Lincoln was a member of the Canterbury Association from 27 March 1848. Upon succeeding to the dukedom, he joined the association&#x27;s management committee on 29 January 1851. In 1849, the chief surveyor of the Canterbury Association, Joseph Thomas, named the future town of Lincoln in New Zealand after him. The town&#x27;s university was in turn also named after Lord Lincoln.

==Family==

Newcastle married Lady Susan Hamilton (9 June 181428 November 1889), daughter of Alexander Hamilton, 10th Duke of Hamilton, on 27 November 1832. They had five children:

*Henry Pelham-Clinton, 6th Duke of Newcastle-under-Lyne (25 January 183422 February 1879), who married Henrietta Adela Hope (11 April 18438 May 1913) on 11 February 1861 and had five children.
*Lord Edward William Pelham-Clinton (11 August 18369 July 1907), who married Matilda Jane Cradock-Hartopp (died 23 October 1892) on 22 August 1865.
*Lady Susan Charlotte Catherine Pelham-Clinton (7 April 18396 September 1875), who married Lord Adolphus Vane-Tempest (2 July 182511 June 1864) on 23 April 1860. She was a mistress of Edward VII when he was Prince of Wales.
*Lord Arthur Pelham-Clinton (23 June 184018 June 1870) who died, possibly by suicide, after being charged in the Boulton and Park case.
*Lord Albert Sidney Pelham-Clinton (22 December 18451 March 1884), who married Mrs Frances Evelyn Stotherd on 17 November 1870; they were divorced in 1877.

The marriage was unhappy and the Duke and Duchess were divorced in 1850, after a considerable scandal in which the Duchess eloped with Horatio Walpole, Lord Walpole, and had an illegitimate child by him. Newcastle died in October 1864, aged 53, and was succeeded in the dukedom by his eldest son, Henry.

His papers are now held at Manuscripts and Special Collections, The University of Nottingham.

<text>Patricia Helen LaMarche (born November 26, 1960) is an American political figure and activist with the Green Party of the United States; she was the party&#x27;s vice-presidential candidate in the 2004 United States presidential election, with David Cobb as its presidential candidate, and was one of seven co-chairs of the party’s national committee, and was elected to that position on July 24, 2005.

LaMarche is also a two-time former candidate for Governor of Maine (1998 and 2006).

==Early life==
LaMarche was born in Providence, Rhode Island, the fourth of five children. She grew up in a public housing project in that city. Her maternal grandparents were immigrants from southern Ireland. Her father, Paul Henri LaMarche, is a doctor, and her mother, Genevieve (née Judge), was at that time a housewife but later became an auditor employed by the state of Maine. When the family moved to Bangor, Maine, in the 1970s, LaMarche enrolled at John Bapst Memorial High School where she graduated near the top of her class. She pursued her education with four years at Boston College.

LaMarche returned to Maine in 1982, and the following year, she married Michael Russell. She had two children: Rebecca in 1985 and John in 1987. Patricia and Michael divorced in 1990. In the late 1980s, she moved into the broadcasting field and was employed at various television and radio stations in the Bangor area. LaMarche has taught Public Relations at Husson College&#x27;s school of Communications and headed the Bangor chapter of the Children&#x27;s Miracle Network.

In 1996 LaMarche moved south to Portland, Maine, to take a job at talk radio station WGAN.
==Public life==
Until the beginning of her vice-presidential campaign, LaMarche was employed by a country music radio station in Maine under the pseudonym of Genny Judge; however, this ended with her candidacy.

On September 5, 2004, LaMarche announced that she would be visiting and staying overnight in homeless and domestic violence shelters throughout the United States &quot;to draw attention to those living on the edge of society.&quot; The campaign dubbed this LaMarche&#x27;s &quot;Left-Out Tour.&quot; &quot;Left Out in America&quot;, LaMarche&#x27;s book which chronicles her tour through American homeless shelters, was released on October 5, 2006, by Upsala Press.

===1998 gubernatorial election===
In 1998, LaMarche was approached to run for governor by Green Party activists on the Maine Green Independent Party nominee. Despite only raising $20,000, LaMarche&#x27;s campaign won 7% of the vote. Because her campaign received more than 5% of the total vote, she became the first woman in the history of the state of Maine to gain ballot access for a political party.

===2006 gubernatorial election===
On December 8, 2005, LaMarche announced her candidacy on the Maine Green Independent Party ticket for the 2006 Maine gubernatorial election against incumbent Democrat John Baldacci. Her positions garnered the endorsement, among others, of Chris Miller, progressive former Democratic candidate for governor who lost in the primaries. LaMarche was one of three Maine Candidates who took advantage of Maine&#x27;s Clean Election Act, a taxpayer-funded campaign system which rewards candidates with public funds if they meet the required 2,500 $5 contributions In November 2006, LaMarche received 51,992 votes (9.56%) in the Maine race for governor.

The LaMarche for Governor website was being permanently archived by the Library of Congress official 2006 Election archive. The site also won a number of awards, including The Golden Dot Award as Best Local Campaign Website of the 2006 campaign at the annual Politics Online conference held in Washington, D.C., on March 15, 2007, A Pollie Award from the American Association of Political Consultants (AAPC) in the gubernatorial websites category, and An Honorable Mention from AAPC for mobile technology used in the LaMarche campaign.

== Homeless Advocacy and Activism ==
=== #MemorialBlanket ===
In 2021, LaMarche spoke at the graduation ceremony for economically disadvantaged individuals who had to take a money management class to improve their housing and living assistance. After reminding the organizers that no one can stretch a penny far enough to compensate for having too few pennies to begin with - LaMarche congratulated the graduates and spent time getting to know them better. One woman on permanent disability explained that her dream existence would include crocheting every day. Walking home that night, LaMarche realized that she could create an art installation that would allow her to do just that... AND remind her community that homelessness kills. Indeed - every year, on homeless memorial night, advocates across the country commemorate those who are lost on the street. December 21st - the longest day of the year - is that day. LaMarche&#x27;s efforts were supported by Matthew Best, Max Donnelly and Marsha Roscoe. With the help of hundreds of artisans and volunteers, together they put 219 handmade blankets out, overnight, to mark the solemn event. 

In 2022, the blanket project returned. This time LaMarche arranged the event to grace the West Lawn of the US Capitol. With a generous grant from the Evangelical Lutheran Church of America and in cooperation with thousands of volunteers, the #memorialblanket art installation took place in front of the most powerful building on the planet.

A third #memorialblanket project took place December 21, 2023 at the State Capitol in Harrisburg. And at a satellite location in Akron, Ohio. More information is available at www.memorialblanket.org

The fourth #memorialblanket project is planned for Independence National Park forDecember 21, 2024

== Other occupations ==
From 2007 until 2011, LaMarche authored a weekly syndicated column which can be read on line in the &quot;Bangor Daily News&quot;. LaMarche was also a Contributing Author for the online news and commentary site New Clear Vision as well as a contributor to the &quot;Huffington Post&quot;.

Along with her journalism, LaMarche was Vice President of Safe Harbour, a homeless shelter based in Carlisle, Pennsylvania for several years. She returned to Maine in June 2011, having been offered the opportunity by Stephen King to institute &quot;a left-leaning&quot; talk show. With her co-presenter, Don Cookson, LaMarche appeared on the WZON show &quot;The Pulse&quot; five mornings each week. In November 2011, in order to raise matched funding on offer from Stephen King to provide winter heat for Mainers without, LaMarche announced her intention to spend a week living in a &quot;Hobbit Hole&quot; outdoors, notwithstanding the bracing Maine fall conditions. She repeated the feat in 2012, garnering thousands of dollars in contributions. Her last broadcast on the morning show was November 16, 2012.

Upon returning to Pennsylvania she worked with Rick Smith on the Rick Smith Show from Harrisburg. LaMarche and Smith traveled 9800 miles of the U.S., broadcasting nightly and she came away with her second book, Daddy, What&#x27;s the Middle Class? She is working to help end poverty in Appalachia.

LaMarche and fellow homeless advocate, Diane Nilan, traveled regularly speaking for agencies and universities about ever-growing despair among America&#x27;s poorest residents. They refer to themselves as the Babes of Wrath as a tribute to the important lessons delivered by John Steinbeck in his epic novel, The Grapes of Wrath.

In June 2019, LaMarche published a novel, Magic Diary through Sunbury Press.

In 2020, Sunbury Press published LaMarche&#x27;s non-fiction tome about poverty in the United States - a sequel to the book she wrote following her fun for Vice President. Still Left Out in America casts a journalist&#x27;s eye on the inside and outside world of homelessness.

Later that year, Pat participated in a Sunbury Press collaboration, After the Pandemic, reviewing the impact on the nation created by the Covid 19 pandemic. 

LaMarche&#x27;s novel, Priscilla the Princess of the Park, is part one of a four-part series, dealing with homelessness through the eyes of an elderly woman and the young people she befriends in the park. It is published by the non-profit, Charles Bruce Foundation.

LaMarche&#x27;s latest novel, Kursid Kids, was a collaboration with her then eight-year-old grandson, Ronan Russell. It details a magical land filled with science fantasy and a very special cat who is capable of ending homelessness. The sequel, Kursid Kids Winter Turns was released in October, 2024.

LaMarche&#x27;s newest book on poverty deals with food insecurity and homelessness. Humble Pie also contains recipes created by centuries of people struggling to survive as well as contributions from professional chefs.

=== January 2023 - Stringer for the Bucks County Beacon ===
LaMarche covers the Harrisburg beat as well as issues surrounding poverty for Philadelphia area local paper. Her first article ran January 25, 2023.

=== November 2024 - Co-host of the Sacred Legions Podcast ===
LaMarche is now co-host of the Sacred Legions Podcast created by Max Goller. Max was inspired by legendary American author and humanist, Kurt Vonnegut Jr., to create a program about decent people living in indecent times - what Vonnegut called Secular Saints.

<text>Solar Jetman: Hunt for the Golden Warpship is a multidirectional shooter video game developed by Zippo Games and Rare and published by Tradewest for the Nintendo Entertainment System. It was released in North America in September 1990 and in Europe by Nintendo on 26 September 1991. The game is the third installment of the &quot;Jetman&quot; series and was later re-released by Nintendo for their NES-based PlayChoice-10 arcade system in the United States in 1990.

In the game, series protagonist Jetman must manoeuvre his small craft through caverns of various planets whilst searching for pieces of the Golden Warpship. The game is presented in a horizontal side-view environment and has ranging gravitational pulls for each planet, which subjects Jetman&#x27;s craft to various forms of inertia. Similar to its predecessors, Jetman must keep his craft topped up with fuel in order to progress through levels.

The game was developed mostly by Mancunian developer Zippo Games under the name of &quot;Iota&quot; before being ordered to change the game into a &quot;Jetman&quot; title by Rare. Ports of the game for the Amiga, Commodore 64 and Atari ST were completed but not released due to poor sales of the NES version. The game received mostly positive reviews upon release, with critics praising the game&#x27;s presentation and graphics, however criticism was directed at the game&#x27;s difficulty. It is included in Rare&#x27;s 2015 &quot;Rare Replay&quot; compilation for Xbox One, and was re-released on the Nintendo Switch Online service on July 4, 2024.

==Gameplay==
The game is a multidirectional shooter that is presented in a horizontal side-view, in a similar vein to earlier installments of the &quot;Jetman&quot; series. The game is set after the events of &quot;Lunar Jetman&quot; and involves series protagonist Jetman on his quest to gather all pieces of the Golden Warpship, a mythical starship that allows interstellar travel. The player controls Jetman&#x27;s pod in either a clockwise or anti-clockwise direction. The pod is subject to inertia but not drag physics depending on the level of gravity of the set planet. The constant pull of gravity changes every level, which makes stable flight challenging and manoeuvring the pod more difficult as the levels progress.

&quot;Solar Jetman&quot; has twelve planets and one hidden planet, each with its own gravity and system of enemy-infested caverns. The goal is to navigate these caverns with small jet pods launched from an immobile mothership, on each planet bringing back a piece of the Golden Warpship and enough fuel to journey to the next one. Items are collected with a tow cable that makes flight more difficult due to the drag of the item, and are released over the mothership or deposited in small wormholes deeper in the caverns. Points are earned by retrieving valuables and destroying enemies, and can be spent after every other stage to buy power-ups for Jetman&#x27;s pod. If a pod is destroyed, Jetman will eject out of the pod and walk around in an agile but vulnerable space suit. The player may be able to return to the mothership in order to collect a new pod. If the player dies outside of their pod, a life will be lost.

==Development and release==
&quot;Solar Jetman&quot; was developed in-joint by Mancunian developer Zippo Games and Leicestershire-based Rare. Founded by brothers Ste and John Pickford, Zippo Games was known for developing &quot;Ironsword&quot;, a sequel to Rare&#x27;s 1987 game &quot;Wizards &amp; Warriors&quot;. Impressed by the success of &quot;Ironsword&quot;, Rare purchased Zippo Games and commissioned them more development projects, a decision which was viewed unfavourably by Ste Pickford, as he wanted to focus on developing games independently. After the buy-out, the Pickford brothers started development of &quot;Iota&quot; on 1 June 1989, a game which was conceived by programmer Steve Hughes to be an arcade-shooter inspired by the Atari ST game &quot;Oids&quot;. Despite having initial creative control over &quot;Iota&quot;, Rare ordered Zippo Games to change the game into a &quot;Jetman&quot; title halfway through development.

During the late 1980s, the Stamper brothers sold the rights of Ultimate Play the Game to U.S. Gold and shifted their focus from the British home computing market to broader home console games. The company became one of the first western developers to be granted a licence by Nintendo to produce games for the Nintendo Entertainment System, during which Rare began employing more staff and expanding their operations in order to develop more games for home consoles.

After development switched to &quot;Solar Jetman&quot;, the Pickford brothers received little input from Rare, with Ste Pickford later speculating that the Stamper brothers had confidence in their abilities, despite being entrusted with their most &quot;revered&quot; series. In a retrospective interview, Ste Pickford stated that he drew inspiration for the mechanics of &quot;Solar Jetman&quot; from a ZX Spectrum game, &quot;Scuba Diving&quot;, admitting that the gravitational pulls of Jetman&#x27;s pod were reminiscent of the way a scuba diver manoeuvred. Development of &quot;Solar Jetman&quot; lasted around a year and started from a standard two-man team to a workforce of several people as the game eventually grew larger in scale.

Shortly after release, Sales Curve Interactive announced ports of &quot;Solar Jetman&quot; for the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, Atari ST, and Amiga, all developed by Software Creations and published by Storm. The Commodore 64, Amiga and Atari ST versions were complete and the ZX Spectrum reached a playable demo state, before the project was cancelled due to poor sales of the NES original and perceived unsuitability for the home computer markets. The Commodore 64 version has subsequently been discovered and made available for download. Despite the cancellations, &quot;Solar Jetman&quot; was later re-released by Nintendo for their NES-based PlayChoice-10 arcade system in 1990. The game was later included in Rare&#x27;s 2015 Xbox One retrospective compilation, &quot;Rare Replay&quot;.

==Reception==

The game received positive reviews from critics upon release, despite the poor sales of the NES version. Reviewers of &quot;Mean Machines&quot; praised the game&#x27;s playability and gameplay, stating that it was &quot;second-to-none&quot; and the different gravity pulls of each planet provided &quot;unique challenges&quot;. Richard Leadbetter of &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; similarly praised the gameplay, comparing it to that of &quot;Thrust&quot;. Leadbetter found the gameplay challenging and stated that the addition of power-ups boosts the game&#x27;s playability. Steve Jarrett of &quot;Total!&quot; asserted that the gameplay was simplistic but addictive as exploration of the game&#x27;s twelve planets would &quot;set the player at it for weeks&quot;.

The graphics and sound were also praised. Reviewers of &quot;Mean Machines&quot; stated that the graphics were &quot;simply brilliant&quot; and presented an &quot;artistic accomplishment&quot;, whereas the sound was similarly &quot;excellent&quot;. Leadbetter stated that the sound and graphics were &quot;functional&quot; rather than outstanding, despite stating that the graphics appeared &quot;fast and smooth&quot;. Jarrett regarded the graphics as simple but &quot;dead smooth&quot; in appearance, also praising the smooth animation of the enemies and the movement of the player&#x27;s ship. Jarrett also praised the sound, heralding the soundtrack as &quot;eerie&quot; yet &quot;great&quot;. The game&#x27;s playability and replay value were praised by a reviewer of &quot;Mean Machines&quot;, stating that the number of levels and items will last a &quot;couple of months&quot;. Jarrett similarly stated that the game&#x27;s twelve levels provide good replay value due to the game&#x27;s difficulty.

<doc id="756999" wikidata="Q3504264" url="?curid=756999" title="Super R.C. Pro-Am">
<text>Super R.C. Pro-Am is a racing video game developed by Rare and published by Nintendo for the Game Boy. It was released in North America in June 1991 and in Europe on April 23, 1992; it was re-released in 1998 as part of Nintendo&#x27;s Player&#x27;s Choice series, which included all Game Boy titles which sold over one million copies. It is the follow-up to the Nintendo Entertainment System title &quot;R.C. Pro-Am&quot;, in which players race remote control cars from an out-of-vehicle perspective on a series of 24 tracks, avoiding obstacles and collecting items to improve performance in order to finish in the top three and qualify for the next track. The game can be played solo against three computer opponents, or two to four players can play simultaneously via the Game Link Cable or the Four Player Adapter.

&quot;Super R.C. Pro-Am&quot; received moderate coverage from some video gaming magazines. It was praised for its graphics and sound, controls, challenge, and ability for up to four players to play the game simultaneously. Criticisms included repetitiveness in gameplay, lack of variety, and rapid scrolling on the Game Boy that may cause players to miss some items. It was featured on &quot;Nintendo Power&quot;″s &quot;Top 20&quot; Game Boy list for most of 1992.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Super R.C. Pro-Am&quot; is a racing video game that is similar to its predecessor, &quot;R.C. Pro-Am&quot;, for the NES. In the game, players race remote control cars on a series of tracks. It can be played solo, with two-players via the Game Link Cable, or with three or four players via the Four Player Adapter. The game features 24 different tracks of increasing difficulty, and the object is to finish in the top three in order to qualify to race in the next track. Players who do not finish in the top three may use a continue and retry the track; players get three continues, and the game ends when the player fails to finish in the top three and has no continues remaining.
Each track is different and range from standard ovals to tracks with many twists and turns. The game includes many obstacles, such as oil slicks that send players spinning, puddles of water that cause players to slide out of control, sand traps and &quot;slow cones&quot; that slow players down, large cones that bring players to a complete halt, and walls of tires that players bounce off. If a player hits an oil slick and then hits a wall while spinning, the player&#x27;s car is temporarily destroyed, which loses time. The tracks also has items that help players along the way: &quot;zippers&quot; (a series of chevrons on the track) give players a speed boost, roll cages allow players to hit walls without being destroyed and allow them to crash opponents by forcing them into walls, and missiles and bombs temporarily destroy opponents&#x27; cars. Also on the track are spare parts which help improve performance – tires improve traction, batteries increase acceleration, and engines improve speed.

Players have the opportunity to upgrade their vehicles by collecting letters, which are distributed throughout the tracks. By spelling &quot;Nintendo&quot; with the letters, players upgrade to a better vehicle; players can upgrade from the &quot;Racer&quot; to the &quot;Speed demon&quot; and then to the &quot;Spiker&quot;, each of which performs progressively better than the previous vehicle. If players spell &quot;Nintendo&quot; while racing with the Spiker, then they win the game.

==Development and reception==

&quot;Super R.C. Pro-Am&quot; was developed by UK-based video game company Rare and was released for Nintendo&#x27;s Game Boy handheld console. It was first mentioned in video gaming magazine &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; in February 1991, along with Game Boy versions of &quot;Nintendo World Cup&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;The Sword of Hope&quot;. It was mentioned again in the following issue in March 1991, along with &quot;Skate or Die: Tour de Thrash&quot;; they mentioned that Rare was attempting to recapture the same feel from its Nintendo Entertainment System predecessor, &quot;R.C. Pro-Am&quot;. It was released in North America in June 1991 and in Europe on April 23, 1992.

&quot;Nintendo Power&quot; praised &quot;Super R.C. Pro-Am&quot; for its graphics and sound, saying that &quot;Rare has really captured the sounds of high-revving engines and tires trying to hold the track&quot;. They also praised the ability for up to four players to play the game simultaneously, saying that players cannot depend on their human opponents to do the same things computer opponents do, and that human opponents can fire back at them (while computer opponents cannot). It would be on the magazine&#x27;s &quot;Top 20&quot; Game Boy list for most of 1992; it debuted at #6 on the January 1992 list, when the magazine switched from the &quot;Top 30&quot; list for the NES and &quot;Top 5&quot; list for Game Boy to &quot;Top 20&quot; lists for the NES, Game Boy and the Super NES. It then went to #8 in February, #10 in March, and back to #8 in April. From May through October 1992, it was in the teens on the Game Boy list, finishing at #11 in May, #18 in June, #17 in July and August, #18 in September, and #15 in October. It dropped off the list afterwards.

&quot;Super R.C. Pro-Am&quot; was reviewed alongside &quot;Mega Man: Dr. Wily&#x27;s Revenge&quot; in UK-based computer gaming magazine &quot;ACE (Advanced Computer Entertainment)&quot;. Reviewer David Upchurch praised the game for its fluid graphics and scrolling, good controls, and &quot;long-term challenge&quot;. He also lauded the ability to play simultaneously with two to four human players, saying that &quot;this transforms the game from a fun diversion into an addictive obsession&quot;. Criticisms included lack of variety in the tracks and an &quot;annoyingly grating sound&quot;. &quot;GamePro&quot; praised the game for its easy-to-see graphics and multiplayer ability, but it criticized the lack of speed. German magazine &quot;Power Play&quot; primarily praised the game for the multiplayer features. The magazine criticized the game for its repetitiveness in gameplay and the rapid scrolling that may cause players to miss items on the track. &quot;Super R.C. Pro-Am&quot; was re-released in 1998 as part of Nintendo&#x27;s Player&#x27;s Choice series, which included all Game Boy titles that sold over one million copies.

<text>The Funeral Mountains is a short, arid mountain range in the United States along the California-Nevada border approximately 100 mi (160 km) west of Las Vegas. The mountains are considered a subrange of the Amargosa Range that form the eastern wall of Death Valley.

The crest of the range is within Death Valley National Park. The range is separated from the Grapevine Mountains to the northwest by the narrow Boundary Canyon and is separated from the Black Mountains by Furnace Creek Wash on the southwest and from the Greenwater Range at the narrow Travertine Point on the south. The broad flats of the Amargosa Desert lie across the border to the northeast in Nevada. The highest point in the range is Pyramid Peak, at 6703 ft (2043 m).

The first movement of Ferde Grofé&#x27;s &quot;Death Valley Suite&quot; is a symphonic musical portrayal of pioneer settlers trudging through the dry craggy peaks of the Funeral Mountains.

<text>R.C. Pro-Am is a racing game developed by Rare and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo Entertainment System. It was released in North America in February 1988, and then in Europe on April 15. Presented in an overhead isometric perspective, a single player races a radio-controlled car around a series of tracks in vehicular combat. Each track qualifies its top three racers for the next track. Collectible power-up items improve performance, hazards include rain puddles and oil slicks, and missiles and bombs can temporarily disable opponents. Originally titled &quot;Pro Am Racing&quot;, it was ported to the Sega Genesis in 1992 as Championship Pro-Am, an enhanced remake with enhanced graphics and additional features. &quot;R.C. Pro-Am&quot; spawned two sequels: &quot;Super R.C. Pro-Am&quot; in 1991, and &quot;R.C. Pro-Am II&quot; in 1992.

As one of Rare&#x27;s first successful NES games, &quot;R.C. Pro-Am&quot; was well-received for its visuals, sound, gameplay, and enjoyability. Its overhead perspective distinguishes it from earlier first-person racing games. It inspired subsequent games such as &quot;Super Off Road&quot;, &quot;Rock n&#x27; Roll Racing&quot;, and the &quot;Mario Kart&quot; series. It has appeared in many &quot;top games of all time&quot; lists and is regarded as one of the best of the NES library. It was re-released in Rare&#x27;s 2015 &quot;Rare Replay&quot; compilation for the Xbox One, and on the Nintendo Switch Online service on February 21, 2024.

==Gameplay==
&quot;R.C. Pro-Am&quot; is a racing video game in which a player races a radio-controlled car against three opponents around a track from an overhead isometric perspective. The horizontal control pad buttons steer left or right, and the other buttons accelerate, fire weapons, and pause the game. Across 32 tracks, the top three of four racers qualify for each next race or reach a game over. Two continues can restart the previous race, losing all points. Each track gives a trophy, and a high score yields larger &quot;High Score Trophies&quot;, leading up to the &quot;Super Trophy&quot;.

Twelve unique track configurations are repeated indefinitely. The original box art claims that the game contains &quot;32 tracks of racing thrills&quot; but the 24th track is unofficially the last because it is the largest. Each track after 24 is a repeat from track 1, but with additional features. At track 32, all computer-controlled opponents run at maximum speed and cannot be beaten without weapons. The game has no formal end; players eventually run out of weapons and are eliminated from the race.

Track items are collectable by driving over them. &quot;Tune-up items&quot; include turbo acceleration, &quot;hotter engines&quot; for higher top speed, and &quot;super sticky tires&quot; for traction and cornering; these additional abilities are displayed on the &quot;track conditions&quot; screen between races. Collectable weapons can temporarily disable other vehicles; missiles stop opponents from the front, and bombs from the rear. Collectable ammunition appears as a star, and carries over to the next race. Collectable roll cages protect cars from crash damage, stationary zippers give cars an extra speed boost, and bonus letters give large point bonuses and an upgraded car when all letters spelling &quot;NINTENDO&quot; (&quot;CHAMPION&quot; in the Genesis and &quot;Rare Replay&quot; versions) are collected. The standard truck upgrades to a faster 4-Wheeler and then to the fastest Off Roader. Hazards include oil slicks which spin cars out of control, water puddles and rain squalls slow them down, pop-up barriers crash cars, and skulls decrease ammunition. Excessive use of projectile weaponry makes the yellow car accelerate to 127 mph, which cannot be matched by the player.

The Sega Genesis version, &quot;Championship Pro-Am&quot;, features some gameplay differences from the NES version. Players race against five other vehicles instead of three, but must still place in the top three to move to the next track. Race records are saved, and players are prompted to enter a name before the game start.

== Background and release ==
The game development company Ultimate Play the Game was founded by brothers Tim and Chris Stamper, along with Tim&#x27;s wife, Carol, from their headquarters in Ashby-de-la-Zouch in 1982. They began producing video games for the ZX Spectrum throughout the early 1980s. The company was known for secrecy about operations and upcoming projects. Little was known except that they worked in &quot;separate teams&quot;: one team worked on programming and the other concentrated on other aspects such as sound or graphics. This company later evolved into Rare, which in 1987 developed &quot;Pro-Am Racing&quot; and renamed it to &quot;R.C. Pro-Am&quot;.

It was released for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) by Nintendo in February 1988 in North America, and in Europe on April 15. It was converted to the Sega Genesis as &quot;Championship Pro-Am&quot;, released by Tradewest in 1992. Its music was composed by David Wise, known for his work on &quot;Cobra Triangle&quot; and the &quot;Donkey Kong Country&quot; series.
&quot;R.C. Pro-Am&quot; received preview coverage in the Fall 1987 issue of &quot;Nintendo Fun Club News&quot; – the company&#x27;s predecessor to &quot;Nintendo Power&quot;. A more in-depth review in the proceeding Winter 1987 issue said that &quot;this game is a must for RC Car (radio-controlled) owners&quot;. It is the cover feature of the February–March 1988 issue, with a full walkthrough. In &quot;Nintendo Power&quot;″s premiere issue in July 1988, &quot;R.C. Pro-Am&quot; is listed 6th on its &quot;Top 30&quot; NES games list, and as the top &quot;Dealer&#x27;s Pick&quot;. It went down to the 8th position in September 1988, and 12th in November.

==Reception and legacy==
Worldwide, 2.3 million copies of &quot;R.C. Pro-Am&quot; were sold. This unqualified success made Rare into a major developer for the Nintendo Entertainment System.
&quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; called it &quot;a compelling, innovating approach to car racing video games&quot;. Bill Kunkel found that it was distinguished from earlier racing games such as Sega&#x27;s &quot;Enduro Racer&quot;, Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;Mach Rider&quot;, and Atari&#x27;s &quot;Pole Position&quot; by going from a more standard &quot;pseudo-first-person&quot; view to an isometric perspective. He praised its simplicity and controls, comparing them to that of an actual radio-controlled car. He criticized its lack of a two-player feature and for the instruction booklet&#x27;s vagueness. He concluded by lauding its graphics and sound, saying that they &quot;help make this the best game of its kind ever produced in any electronic game format&quot;. &quot;Bloomberg Businessweek&quot; listed &quot;R.C. Pro-Am&quot;, along with &quot;Cobra Triangle&quot;, as Rare&#x27;s most notable NES games.
The game has continued to receive positive reviews. Allgame&#x27;s Chris Couper stated that &quot;R.C. Pro-Am&quot; is among the best NES games, due to its realistic nature. He praised its challenge and sound. &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; saw the game as a precursor to &quot;Micro Machines&quot; by Codemasters, and compared the action and variety of items to the later &quot;Mario Kart&quot; series. They hailed it as one of Rare&#x27;s best early products, stating: &quot;Radio-controlled car racing in videogame form was pretty much perfected here&quot;. The 2009 book &quot;Vintage Games&quot; compared it to &quot;Spy Hunter&quot;, noting its emphasis on collecting power-ups and weapons and not just on racing, saying that the trend of combining racing with vehicular combat would reappear in future games such as &quot;Super Mario Kart&quot; and &quot;Rock n&#x27; Roll Racing&quot;. Later in 2010, as part of Rare&#x27;s 25th anniversary, the magazine said that it was Rare&#x27;s first successful NES game and one of the first games to combine racing and vehicular combat. Readers ranked it 22nd in a list of top 25 Rare games. In 2016, VintageGamer.com praised it for still being enjoyable and challenging 28 years after its release.
&quot;R.C. Pro-Am&quot; has appeared many times on various &quot;best games&quot; lists. A survey by &quot;GamePro&quot; in 1990 ranked it the 10th-best sports video game. &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; placed it the 52nd best console video game of all time in 1997. &quot;Game Informer&quot; placed it number 84 on its &quot;Top 100 Games of All Time&quot; list in August 2001. &quot;Paste&quot; magazine placed it as the 8th greatest NES game ever, saying that it is &quot;way more fun than &quot;real&quot; remote-control cars, which never seemed to be equipped with missile capabilities&quot;. IGN placed it the 13th-best NES game of all time, citing its player popularity and good sales. Executive Editor Craig Harris said that it was one of the first games to introduce the concept of vehicular combat, inspiring other games such as &quot;Super R.C. Pro-Am&quot;, &quot;R.C. Pro-Am II&quot;, and the &quot;Mario Kart&quot; series. 1UP.com listed it as the 14th best NES game, citing its good graphics and gameplay elements, though the difficulty level was too high. As with other retrospectives, the website staff listed the game as inspiration for future series such as &quot;Super Off Road&quot; and &quot;Rock n&#x27; Roll Racing&quot;. In a retrospective at Rare&#x27;s 25th anniversary, &quot;GamePro&quot; listed &quot;R.C. Pro-Am&quot; as one of Rare&#x27;s best games, calling the release &quot;one of Rare&#x27;s finest moments&quot;. Rare began work on a follow-up game for the Nintendo 64, called &quot;Pro-Am 64&quot;, which changed direction and became &quot;Diddy Kong Racing&quot;. The NES version of &quot;R.C. Pro-Am&quot; is one of the 30 games in the Xbox One compilation &quot;Rare Replay&quot;. The game was re-released via the Nintendo Switch Online service on February 21, 2024.

<doc id="757040" wikidata="Q368804" url="?curid=757040" title="U.S. Customs and Border Protection">
<text>United States Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is the largest federal law enforcement agency of the United States Department of Homeland Security. It is the country&#x27;s primary border control organization, charged with regulating and facilitating international trade, collecting import duties, as well as enforcing U.S. regulations, including trade, customs, and immigration. CBP is one of the largest law enforcement agencies in the United States. It has a workforce of more than 45,600 federal agents and officers. It is headquartered in Washington, D.C.

==Organization==

CBP has a workforce of over 58,000 employees, including officers and agents, agriculture specialists, aircraft pilots, trade specialists, mission support staff, and canine enforcement officers and agents.
*More than 21,180 CBP officers inspect and examine passengers and cargo at 328 ports of entry.
*Over 2,200 CBP agriculture specialists work to curtail the spread of harmful pests and plant and animal diseases that may harm America&#x27;s farms and food supply or cause bio- and agro-terrorism.
*Over 21,370 Border Patrol agents protect and patrol of border with Mexico and of border with Canada.
*Nearly 1,050 air and marine interdiction agents prevent people, weapons, narcotics, and conveyances from illegal entry by air and water.
*Nearly 2,500 employees in CBP revenue positions collect over $30 billion annually in entry duties and taxes through the enforcement of trade and tariff laws. In addition, these employees fulfill the agency&#x27;s trade mission by appraising and classifying imported merchandise. These employees serve in positions such as import specialist, auditor, international trade specialist, and textile analyst.
*The primary goal of the CBP Canine Program is terrorist detection and apprehension. The CBP Canine Program is critical to the mission of the Department of Homeland Security: &quot;To Protect the Homeland.&quot; The program conducts the largest number of working dogs of any U.S. federal law enforcement agency. K-9 teams are assigned to 73 commercial ports and 74 Border Patrol stations throughout the nation.

There are 328 officially designated ports of entry and an additional 14 pre-clearance locations in Canada, Ireland, the Middle East, Bermuda, and the Caribbean. CBP is also in charge of the Container Security Initiative, which identifies and inspects foreign cargo in its mother country before it is to be imported into the United States.

In addition the CBP claims to have legal jurisdiction to conduct some activities up to inwards from any land or sea border. This can include operating interior checkpoints.

CBP assess all passengers flying into the U.S. for terrorist risk via the Joint Terrorism Task Force (JTTF) and systems such as Advance Passenger Information System (APIS), United States Visitor and Immigrant Status Indication Technology (US-VISIT), and the Student and Exchange Visitor System (SEVIS). CBP also works with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to screen high-risk imported food shipments in order to prevent bio-terrorism and agro-terrorism.

Through the Container Security Initiative, CBP works jointly with host nation counterparts to identify and screen containers that pose a risk at the foreign port of departure before they are loaded on board vessels bound for the U.S. CSI is implemented in 20 of the largest ports in terms of container shipments to the U.S., and at a total of 58 ports worldwide.

The Secure Electronic Network for Travelers Rapid Inspection (SENTRI) program allows pre-screened, low-risk travelers from Mexico to be processed through dedicated lanes. NEXUS is a similar program on the country&#x27;s northern border with Canada. Along both borders, CBP has implemented the Free and Secure Trade, which uses transponder technology and pre-arrival shipment information to process participating trucks as they arrive at the border. An agreement with Canada allows CBP to target, screen, and examine rail shipments headed to the U.S.

CBP is authorized to provide aerial surveillance outside of the border area &quot;to assist law enforcement and humanitarian relief efforts&quot; when requested by local, tribal, state or federal agencies. CBP drones have been used to capture images of storm-impacted areas for the National Weather Service; assess hurricane affected areas for FEMA; and provide surveillance for local law enforcement during the 2015 Baltimore protests and 2020 George Floyd protests.

===List of commissioners of U.S. Customs and Border Protection ===


==Enforcement powers==


CBP has the authority to search outbound and inbound shipments, and uses targeting to carry out its mission in this area. Under Section 596 of the Tariff Act, CBP is required to seize and forfeit all merchandise that is stolen, smuggled, or clandestinely imported or introduced. CBP is also required to seize and forfeit controlled substances, certain contraband articles, and plastic explosives that do not contain a detection agent. In conjunction with the Department of State and the Bureau of the Census, CBP has put in place regulations that require submission of electronic export information on U.S. Munitions List and for technology for the Commerce Control List. CBP uses advance information from the Automated Targeting System and the Automated Export System to identify cargo that may pose a threat. CBP also works with the departments of state and defense to improve procedures on exported shipments of foreign military sales commodities.

Merchandise may also be seized and forfeited if:

*Its importation is restricted or prohibited because of a law relating to health, safety or conservation;
*The merchandise is lacking a federal license required for the importation;
*The merchandise or packaging is in violation of copyright, trademark, trade name, or trade dress protections;
*The merchandise is intentionally or repetitively marked in violation of country of origin marking requirements; or
*The imported merchandise is subject to quantitative restrictions requiring a visa or similar document from a foreign government, and the document presented with the entry is counterfeit.

===Civil penalties===
Section 1592 of the Tariff Act of 1930 is the basic and most widely used customs penalty provision for the importation of goods. It prescribes monetary penalties against any person who imports, attempts to import, or aids or procures the importation of merchandise by means of false or fraudulent documents, statements, omissions or practices, concerning any material fact. Penalties may be applied even in situations where there is no loss of revenue.

Section 1592 infractions are divided into three categories of culpability, each giving rise to a different maximum penalty:

*&quot;Fraud&quot;, an act or omission done intentionally to defraud the United States. The maximum civil penalty for a violation is the domestic value of the merchandise in the entry or entries concerned.
*&quot;Gross negligence&quot;, an act or omission with actual knowledge of, or wanton disregard for, the relevant facts and a disregard of section 1592 obligations. The maximum civil penalty is the lesser of the domestic value of the merchandise or four times the loss of revenue (actual or potential). If the infraction does not affect revenue, the maximum penalty is 40% of the dutiable value of the good.
*&quot;Negligence&quot;, involving a failure to exercise due care in ascertaining the material facts or in ascertaining the obligations under section 1592. The maximum civil penalties are the same for gross negligence, except the lesser of &quot;twice&quot; the domestic value of the merchandise or twice the loss of revenue is used. The penalty cannot exceed 20% of the dutiable value.
The Customs Modernization Act amended section 1592 to apply existing penalties for false information to information transmitted electronically and allows customs to recover unpaid taxes and fees resulting from 592 violations. It also introduced the requirement that importers use &quot;reasonable care&quot; in making entry and providing the initial classification and appraisement, establishing a &quot;shared responsibility&quot; between customs and importers, thus allowing customs to rely on the accuracy of the information submitted and streamline entry procedures. To the extent that an importer fails to use reasonable care, customs may impose a penalty.

US Customs agriculture specialist officers are allowed to issue civil penalties in accordance with CFR 7 &amp; 9.

===Criminal penalties===
In addition to the civil penalties, a criminal fraud statute provides for sanctions to those presenting false information to customs officers, with violators facing a maximum of two years imprisonment, or a $5,000 fine, or both, for each violation involving an importation or attempted importation.

==History==
===U.S. Customs Service===
Responding to an urgent need for revenue following the American Revolutionary War, the First United States Congress passed, and President George Washington signed on July 4, the Tariff of 1789, which authorized the collection of duties on imports. Four weeks later, on July 31, the fifth act of Congress established the United States Customs Service and its ports of entry.

For nearly 125 years, the U.S. Customs Service was the primary source of governmental funds, which paid for the nation&#x27;s early growth and infrastructure. Purchases include the Louisiana and Oregon territories; Florida, Alaska, and Washington, D.C.; funding the National Road and the Transcontinental Railroad; building many of the United States&#x27; lighthouses; and military academies.

In March 2003, the Customs Service was renamed the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection, and its structure split to form parts of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security as the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection and the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Division.

===U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS)===

Shortly after the American Civil War, some states started to pass their own immigration laws, which prompted the U.S. Supreme Court to rule in &quot;Chy Lung v. Freeman&quot; in 1875 that immigration was a federal responsibility. The Immigration Act of 1891 established an Office of the Superintendent of Immigration within the United States Department of the Treasury. This office was responsible for admitting, rejecting, and processing all immigrants seeking admission to the United States and for implementing national immigration policy. &quot;Immigrant inspectors&quot;, as they were then called, were stationed at major U.S. ports of entry collecting manifests of arriving passengers. A &quot;head tax&quot; of fifty cents was collected on each immigrant.

In the early 20th century, Congress&#x27;s primary interest in immigration was protecting American workers and wages – the reason it had become a federal concern in the first place. This made immigration more a matter of commerce than revenue; hence, in 1903, Congress transferred the Bureau of Immigration to the newly created Department of Commerce and Labor.

After World War I, Congress attempted to stem the flow of immigrants, still mainly coming from Europe, by passing laws in 1921 and 1924 limiting the number of newcomers by assigning a quota to each nationality based upon its representation in previous U.S. census figures. Each year, the U.S. State Department issued a limited number of visas; only those immigrants who had obtained them and could present valid visas were permitted entry.

The Immigration and Naturalization Service was formed in 1933 by a merger of the Bureau of Immigration and the Bureau of Naturalization. President Franklin D. Roosevelt moved the Immigration and Naturalization Service from the Department of Labor to the Department of Justice in 1940.

In 1969 President Richard Nixon formally changed the name of the United States Border Control to the United States Border Patrol.

===Reorganization (2003 to present)===

CBP became an official agency of the United States Department of Homeland Security on March 1, 2003, combining employees from the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (specifically the Plant Protection Quarantine inspectors), the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service (specifically, immigration inspectors and the United States Border Patrol), and the United States Customs Service. This transformation was led by former commissioner Robert C. Bonner.

W. Ralph Basham was nominated to the post of commissioner by President George W. Bush on June 6, 2006. Basham had 28 years of experience as a law enforcement manager, including serving as the head of the Secret Service and the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center. He had also served as the chief of staff for the Transportation Security Administration. It is the largest federal law enforcement agency and works closely with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).

In 2007, the U.S. Border Patrol joined two units, the Border Patrol Tactical Unit (BORTAC) and the Border Patrol Search, Trauma, and Rescue Unit (BORSTAR), to form the U.S. Border Patrol&#x27;s Special Operations Group (SOG), headquartered in El Paso, Texas. BORTAC and BORSTAR direct their nationally dispersed assets from the SOG, providing the U.S. Border Patrol with immediate tactical and emergency response assets.

On September 13, 2019, Director Troy Miller rang the closing bell at the New York Stock Exchange in honor of 230 years since the beginnings of the CBP.

==Personnel==

===U.S. Customs and Border Protection Officer (CBPO)===
CBP officers are federal law enforcement officers in the largest CBP Office of Field Operations empowered to exercise the authority and perform the duties provided by law and Department of Homeland Security regulations, including making arrests, conducting searches, making seizures, bearing firearms, and serving any order or warrant. CBP officers have full law enforcement powers on and off duty. CBP officers defend against terrorist intrusion by identifying high risk individuals who are attempting to enter into the United States; stop criminal activities – such as drug trafficking, child pornography (including on computers, cell phones, and other electronic media), weapons trafficking, and money laundering – by inspecting vehicles and trucks; and prevent the illegal entry of individuals, the smuggling of prohibited goods, and other customs and immigration violations. Officers are armed with Glock G19 pistols chambered in 9mm, expandable batons, x2 Tasers and oleoresin capsicum pepper spray. In accordance with Public Law 110–161, CBP officers are covered under special law enforcement retirement, and all candidates must be referred for selection for this position before reaching their 40th birthday.

Officer candidates attend the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center, in Glynco, Georgia for 21 weeks of paid training. Candidate training consists of basic law enforcement skills, including Anti-Terrorism; Detection of Contraband; Interviewing; Cross-cultural Communications; Firearms Handling and Qualification; Immigration and Naturalization Laws; U.S. Customs Export and Import laws, Defensive Tactics and Driving; Crime Investigation Site; Arrest Techniques; Baton Techniques; Examination of cargo, bags, and merchandise; border search exception; Entry and Control Procedures; Passenger Processing; and Officer Safety and Survival. Those candidates selected for duty locations requiring Spanish may receive an additional 6 weeks of Spanish Language training. After a few years of service, qualified Officers may serve on CBP&#x27;s Special Response Team after passing a pre-test and an additional five weeks of paid training at the U.S. Border Patrol Tactical Unit (BORTAC) in El Paso, Texas.

CBP officers may begin their careers in any region for which they apply. The duty region is selected during the application phase. Proficiency in Spanish is a duty requirement only for those stationed along southern border regions, although it is not a requirement before being hired. CBP officers stationed along southern border regions will undergo Spanish language training before coming on duty.

The CBP officer position is categorized as a &quot;critical-sensitive&quot; position in law enforcement. For this reason, officer candidates must undergo a single scope background investigation (SSBI) before being appointed. In addition, officer candidates must pass a written exam, undergo drug and medical examination, polygraph examination, a physical fitness test, pre-security screening and structured interview during the pre-appointment phase.

* The title and authority of Port Director can be held at the GS-12, GS-13, GS-14, GS-15, or SES pay grades based on staffing level of the port.

* Promotion to GS-12 CBP officer is automatic with time in service. Promotions to GS-13 and above are competitive.

===Agriculture specialists (OFO)===

CBP agriculture specialists receive 11 weeks of paid training at the Professional Development Center in Frederick, Maryland as well as a post-academy training phase that varies in length according to their assigned port. Agriculture Specialists are stationed at international ports of entry located at airports, seaports, and land borders throughout the U.S. and along the Canadian and Mexican borders; they are also stationed overseas in various countries authorized by the United States to have the traveling public and agricultural commodities pre-cleared before entering into the United States. They are uniformed federal officers with the authority to conduct random inspections of luggage or items entering the country and the power to seize prohibited or contaminated items. Agricultural Specialists issue civil fines, not to be confused with collecting duty or tax, to both international travelers and commercial entities in accordance with the federal laws CFR 7 &amp; 9; they do not however collect duty taxes. Although agriculture specialists work for and are sworn to uphold and enforce the laws governed under the jurisdiction of Customs and Border Protection, they are also tasked with enforcing the laws governed by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS). They serve as expert and technical consultants in the areas of inspection, intelligence, analysis, examination and law enforcement activities related to the importation of agricultural and commercial commodities and conveyances at the various ports of entry. Agriculture specialists apply a wide range of federal, state and local laws and agency regulations, including those of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), Centers for Disease Control (CDC), and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) when determining the admissibility of agricultural commodities, or commodities in general, while regulating and/or preventing the introduction of restricted or prohibited products, harmful pests, diseases and potential agro-terrorism into the United States. They participate in special enforcement, targeting, and analysis teams charged with collecting and analyzing information and identifying high-risk targets; or conducting visual and physical inspections of cargo, conveyances or passenger baggage. The Agriculture Specialist plans, conducts, and supervises remedial actions such as treating, disinfecting and decontaminating prohibited commodities, conveyances, contaminants or agricultural materials.

The agriculture specialist position is categorized as a &quot;sensitive&quot; position in law enforcement and may be granted up to the &quot;Secret&quot; level security clearance. Candidates must undergo a single scope background investigation and a polygraph examination before being appointed. In addition, the candidates must undergo a video based interview as well as a drug and medical examination during the pre-appointment phase.

===Import specialists (OFO)===

Import specialists interact with both importers and exporters and are responsible for decisions regarding merchandise, manufactured goods, and commodities.

Import specialists work alongside CBP officers, Homeland Security Investigations special agents and legal professionals in matters of international trade. They are responsible for classifying and appraising commercially imported merchandise that enter the country. They determine which products may legally enter the country by enforcing laws protecting public health and safety, intellectual property rights and fair trade practices. They detect incidents of smuggling, commercial fraud, and counterfeiting and participate in related criminal investigations.

Import specialists have the authority to issue penalties and fines, to recommend seizure of prohibited or suspect cargo and to participate in negotiations and legal prosecution. Occasionally, import specialists may be given short-term assignments overseas as part of a multi-agency team. Responsibilities could include investigating foreign manufacturing facilities for violations involving child labor, product safety or other areas of concern to the country. Seven weeks of paid specialized training enable import specialists to develop an expert knowledge of import and export trends, commodities, industries, and international trade agreements. Import specialists perform their mission at more than 300 ports of entry located at airports, seaports and land borders throughout the United States and along the Canadian and Mexican borders.

===United States Border Patrol (USBP)===

The U.S. Border Patrol agent (as opposed to officer) is a federal law enforcement agent actively patrolling a U.S. border to prevent persons from entering the United States without government permission. Agents detect and prevent the smuggling and unlawful entry of aliens into the United States, along with apprehending those people found to be in violation of immigration laws. Agents work to lower crime and improve the quality of life in border communities. In some areas, Agents are deputized or have peace-officer status and use it to enforce local and state/territory laws. More than 20,000 Border Patrol agents safeguard nearly 6,000 miles of land border the United States shares with Canada and Mexico, and more than 2,000 miles of coastal waters.

One of the most important activities for a United States Border Patrol agent is &quot;line watch&quot;. This involves the detection, prevention and apprehension of terrorists, illegal aliens and smugglers of both aliens and contraband at or near the land border by maintaining surveillance from a covert position, following up leads, responding to electronic sensor systems, aircraft sightings, and interpreting and following tracks, marks and other physical evidence. Some of the major activities are farm and ranch check, traffic check, traffic observation, city patrol, transportation check, administrative, intelligence, and anti-smuggling activities.

All agents complete a 26-week paid &quot;Basic Academy&quot; training at the U.S. Border Patrol Academy in Artesia, New Mexico. Training includes such topics as immigration and nationality laws, physical training (PT), weapons and marksmanship. For those needing Spanish language instruction, an additional 8 weeks may be required beyond the 65 days of Basic Academy training. Border Patrol Agents must be willing to work overtime and varying shifts under arduous conditions, and be proficient in the carry and use of firearms. They may also be sent on temporary assignments on short notice, or on permanent reassignments to any duty location. All new agents begin their careers along the Southwest border, where a working knowledge of Spanish is required.

===Air and marine enforcement and interdiction agents===
*CBP Office of Air and Marine Operations (AMO)
**Aviation enforcement agents (AEA)An aviation enforcement agent serves as the primary federal law enforcement officer aboard AMO aircraft.
**Air interdiction agents (AIA)Air interdiction agents serve as the pilot in command of an AMO aircraft.
**Marine interdiction agents (MIA)Marine interdiction agents are either the vessel commander or a crew member aboard an AMO vessel.

AMO is the world&#x27;s largest civilian aviation and maritime law enforcement organization. Its mission is to protect the American people and nation&#x27;s critical infrastructure through the coordinated use of air and marine assets to detect, interdict and prevent acts of terrorism and the unlawful movement of people, illegal drugs, and other contraband toward or across the borders of the United States. Air and marine interdiction agents are endowed with the authority to enforce Title 8 (Aliens and Nationality) and Title 19 (Customs) of the United States Code in addition to the general law enforcement powers bestowed upon federal law enforcement agents.

This specialized law enforcement capability allows AMO to make significant contributions to the efforts of the Department of Homeland Security, as well as to those of other federal, state, local, and tribal agencies. AMO is uniquely positioned to provide direct air and maritime support to multiple agencies and to ensure the success of border protection and law enforcement operations between ports of entry, within the maritime domain and within the nation&#x27;s interior. To accomplish its mission, AMO employs over 1,200 federal agents at 70 locations, operating more than 260 aircraft of 26 different types, and approximately 300 maritime vessels. It is one of the major operational components within U.S. Customs and Border Protection, along with the Office of Field Operations (OFO) and the United States Border Patrol (USBP).

===Employee morale===

In July 2006, the Office of Personnel Management conducted a survey of federal employees in all 36 federal agencies on job satisfaction and how they felt their respective agency was headed. DHS (which includes CBP) was last or near to last in every category including

*36th on the job satisfaction index
*35th on the leadership and knowledge management index
*36th on the results-oriented performance culture index
*33rd on the talent management index

The low scores were attributed to major concerns about basic supervision, management and leadership within DHS. Based on the survey, the primary concerns are about promotion and pay increase based on merit, dealing with poor performance, rewarding creativity and innovation, and the inability of leadership to generate high levels of motivation in the workforce, recognition for doing a good job, lack of satisfaction with various component policies and procedures and lack of information about what is going on with the organization and complaints from the traveling public.

In June 2007, CBP commissioner W. Ralph Basham announced to employees that the agency would be conducting 125 different focus groups in 12 different cities around the country to better understand their concerns as expressed in the Human Capital Survey. The agency is also going to give employees who are not a part of that focus group process an intranet virtual focus group where they can express their views and their concerns. The commissioner stated: &quot;We are looking at this very seriously. We want to hear from the employees, we want to hear from these focus groups, we want to drill down on this survey.&quot; In 2011, more than four years after this statement was made, these focus groups have never been reported to have been held, nor have any plans been reported for them to be held in the future.

A November 2007 Government Accountability Office report showed that low staffing, training, and overwork is a large problem within CBP, and an average of 71 officers leave the service every two weeks.

CBP continued carrying out their mission during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. As of June 17, 2020, 544 federal employees tested positive for COVID-19 and 5 have died as a result of the virus.

===Polygraphing===
In 2011, the United States Congress mandated that applicants to CBP jobs undergo polygraph testing. The agency polygraphs about 10,000 applicants annually. From the start of the polygraphing until August 16, 2013, over 200 confessions of wrongdoing had been made. Many of the applicants confessed that they had close associations with drug traffickers or that they were directly involved in smuggling of drugs and illegal immigrants. The agency accused ten applicants of using countermeasures. As part of the &quot;Operation Lie Busters&quot;, the name of the crackdown on polygraph countermeasures, all ten were not selected for employment.

CBP officers primary sidearm since 2019 is the Glock 19 pistol in 9mm caliber. It can contain as many as 16 rounds of ammunition (15 in the magazine and one in the chamber). Like many other law enforcement agencies, the 12 gauge Remington Model 870 is the standard pump-action shotgun. The CBP issue Model 870 has been modified by Scattergun Technologies to CBP specifications including: a 14-inch barrel, a five-shot capacity magazine, a composite stock with pistol grip, and night sights with a tactical &quot;ghost-ring&quot; rear sight. CBP uses the 5.56x45 caliber Colt M4 Carbine (M4A1) as the standard long gun for CBP Officers assigned to its aviation and maritime interdiction units, the CBP Border Patrol, the CBP Special Response Teams.

In April 2019, CBP awarded Glock a contract to replace the H&amp;K P2000. A special version of the Glock known as G47 was produced for CBP, along with Glock G19 compact and Glock G26 subcompacts modified to CBP specifications. All will be chambered in 9mm caliber.

==Criticism==
National Public Radio&#x27;s &quot;Morning Edition&quot; reported that CBP radiation-detection equipment at ports is better at detecting kitty litter than dangerous weapons, and that U.S. borders are so porous that congressional investigators carrying simulated nuclear materials have walked across unchallenged.

In an article entitled &quot;DHS Decision-Making: Competence or Character?&quot;, James Giermanski states that the fundamental problem within CBP is that the agency has weak and sometimes flawed management. He says that DHS and CBP suffer from &quot;seriously flawed decision-making&quot;, citing the &quot;door only&quot; policy, radio frequency identification technology, and lack of focus on exports which contain bombs.

The agency&#x27;s practice of performing internal document checks on buses and trains running entirely within U.S. territory has been called &quot;coercive, unconstitutional, and tainted by racial profiling&quot;.

The United States Court of International Trade found that CBP improperly classified merchandise when it had untrained chemists testifying before the court. The court found that there were errors in the laboratory reports, that CBP destroyed the evidence, and the tests used by the chemist did not meet any Daubert standards.

During a federal court case for unlawful removal, CBP and United States Department of Justice attorneys cited the U.S. Supreme Court case of &quot;Garcetti v. Ceballos&quot; (04-473), which ruled that CBP employees do not have protection from retaliation by CBP managers under the First Amendment of the Constitution. The free speech protections of the First Amendment have long been used to shield whistleblowers from retaliation. In response to the Supreme Court decision of &quot;Garcetti v. Ceballos&quot;, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 985, the Whistleblower Protection Act of 2007, and the Senate passed its version of the Whistleblower Protection Act (S. 274), which has significant bipartisan support.

In 2005, a merger of ICE and CBP was considered, following a review at the request Senator Susan Collins (R-ME) chairwoman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, that found morale and operational issues with ICE and the overlapping responsibilities within the two agencies.

A 2018 report by the ACLU and University of Chicago Law School&#x27;s International Human Rights Clinic alleged that there was pervasive physical, verbal, sexual and psychological abuse of immigrant minors by DHS and CBP officials over the period 2009–2014. Customs and Border Protection denied the allegations. The ACLU published a guide, &quot;Know Your Rights: In the 100-mile Border Zone.&quot;

In July 2019, after a report by ProPublica, the CBP initiated an investigation into &quot;disturbing social media activity hosted on a private Facebook group that may include a number of CBP employees&quot;. ProPublica reported that the three-year existence of the Facebook group called &quot;I&#x27;m 10-15&quot; (the code used by the Border Patrol for &quot;aliens in custody&quot;). The Facebook group, meant for current and former Border Patrol officials, had around 9,500 members. ProPublica published screenshots and quotes of group members mocking migrant deaths, questioning if a photo of drowned migrants was &quot;edited&quot; by liberals, and posting sexist and racist jokes on Latino members of the US Congress, including Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. She, in turn, described this as CBP&#x27;s &quot;violent culture&quot;. Border Patrol chief Carla Provost said that the &quot;posts are completely inappropriate&quot; and vowed to hold the employees responsible accountable. Provost herself was once a member of the group, having posted in it in November 2018.

In July 2020, the Trump administration dispatched federal officers to Portland, Oregon, during protests in the city following the murder of George Floyd. Policing tactics such as the detainment of protesters in unmarked vans and the shooting of protester Donavan La Bella in the head with an impact round were linked to a deployment that included CBP BORTAC agents sent to the city against the wishes of state and local government. US Customs and Border Protection was named in the resulting suit filed by the Oregon Department of Justice, which accused CBP and other federal agencies of violating protesters&#x27; civil rights.

The CBP was criticized in September 2022 for amassing a database of digital data from travelers crossing the US border with up to 10,000 people entered into the database per year, as well as the fact that around 2,700 CBP officers have warrantless access to the database and people&#x27;s data. Senator Ron Wyden addressed an official letter to the CBP commissioner, raising concern about &quot;allowing indiscriminate rifling through Americans&#x27; private records&quot; and asking that the searches be limited to criminal investigation suspects and known security risks.

<text>TTFN is an initialism for &quot;for now&quot;, an informal &quot;goodbye&quot;. The expression came to prominence in the UK during the Second World War. Used by the military, it was frequently heard by the British public.

&quot;TTFN&quot; was introduced in 1940 in the British weekly radio comedy &quot;It&#x27;s That Man Again&quot; by the character Mrs Mopp, who ended every scene with it. During the second series, the show&#x27;s name was shortened to &quot;ITMA&quot;, to satirize the abundance of abbreviations that were becoming common knowledge due to the ongoing war.

==Other usage==
In the 1966 &quot;Batman&quot; television episode &quot;Better Luck Next Time&quot;, Catwoman (played by the actress Julie Newmar) states &quot;TTFN&quot; in a microphone to Batman (Adam West) while he is high upon a wall while being stalked by her tiger, Tinkerbell, and then she has to further explain the meaning of the initialism to the puzzled Batman.

In &quot;Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day&quot;, a 1968 Disney featurette, the voice of Tigger was performed by Paul Winchell, whose wife Jean Freeman suggested that he ad-lib the line. It was further used by Tigger in &quot;The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh&quot; (1988–1991), often followed by a &quot;hoo hoo hoo hoo!&quot; as he bounces away on his tail. Tigger also uses variations of the word, in the episode &quot;Tigger is the Mother of Invention&quot; he says &quot;TTFG. Ta-ta for good&quot;, and in The Tigger Movie &quot;TTFE. Ta-ta For Ever&quot;. However, the phrase does not appear in the original books by A. A. Milne.

It appears in the 1980 children&#x27;s book &#x27;Quest for the Gloop&#x27; by Helen Nicoll and Jan Pienkowski

Tim Horton, the deceased professional hockey player and founder of the Tim Horton&#x27;s Doughnut chain, has &quot;TTFN&quot; on his grave stone.

On the sitcom &quot;Bewitched&quot;, the character Endora used the phrase TTFN before vanishing into thin air. 

&quot;Ta ta for now&quot; caught on with the British public so much that it was often uttered by dying people as their last words. It has been the catchphrase of radio personalities such as Jimmy Young, who modified it to BFN: &quot;Bye for now&quot;.

In the 1990s, TTFN was still being used in online chat such as IRC and MUDs.

The young adult novel &quot;ttfn&quot; by Lauren Myracle was released in 2005. The frequently challenged novel is written entirely in the style of instant messaging.

<text>Nathaniel Marston (July 9, 1975 – November 11, 2015) was an American actor and producer, known for his roles on the CBS soap opera &quot;As the World Turns&quot; and ABC&#x27;s &quot;One Life to Live&quot;.

==Early life==
Born on July 9, 1975, in Torrington, Connecticut, Marston lived in several states with his mother Elizabeth, an aspiring actress, before moving to Kauai, Hawaii, at the age of three. When he was ten, they moved to San Diego, California. During the next several years he lived in Los Angeles and New York, returning to Los Angeles where he graduated from Beverly Hills High School.

==Career==
While working at a Beverly Hills bakery, Marston was &quot;discovered&quot; by a customer who happened to be an agent for William Morris. After appearing in several commercials, he was cast as Rosario Cappamezza in the feature film &quot;Love Is All There Is&quot; co-starring with Angelina Jolie, followed by a role in the film &quot;The Craft&quot; (1996). He then became a regular in the prime time television series &quot;Matt Waters&quot; in 1996.

Marston appeared as Eddie Silva on the CBS soap opera &quot;As the World Turns&quot; from 1998 to 2000. The role earned him a Soap Opera Digest Award nomination for &quot;Outstanding Male Newcomer.&quot; 

He next portrayed Al Holden on the ABC soap opera &quot;One Life to Live&quot; from 2001 to 2003, and then subsequently played Dr. Michael McBain on the series from 2004 to 2007.

Marston had a small role in the 2002 cable television movie &quot;Monday Night Mayhem&quot;. On November 25, 2008, he appeared on &quot;Law &amp; Order: SVU&quot; in the role of Brent Latimer.
Marston&#x27;s other film work includes roles in the feature films &quot;Ordinary Sinner&quot; (2001) and &quot;Ciao, America&quot; (2002), along with a leading role in the short film &quot;The Paw&quot; (2005). Marston also starred as Tony Parisi in the 2011 independently produced body-switching romantic comedy &quot;Walk a Mile in My Pradas&quot;.

==Personal life==
Marston was married to Rita Bias in 2006. In the early hours of October 21, 2007, he was arrested following an altercation with three people in New York City, and was thought to be under the influence of narcotics. Ultimately, in March 2010 Marston pleaded guilty to one charge of misdemeanor resisting arrest and completed a three-month course in anger management as part of a no-jail-time sentencing deal. No drug allegations were ever substantiated, though Marston did admit to punching a police officer who was trying to break up the fracas. Marston was involved with the charities The Gabriel Project and Lower Eastside Service Center. He was an amateur boxer.

===Death===
On October 30, 2015, Marston was involved in a car accident near Reno, Nevada, that left him in critical condition. He was not wearing a seatbelt when his pickup truck flipped several times, throwing him from the truck. No drugs or alcohol were found in his system. His mother later reported that he was on life support and doctors had advised that, if he survived, he would likely be paralyzed from the neck down. Marston died on November 11, 2015, following complications from surgery.

<doc id="757045" wikidata="Q1375567" url="?curid=757045" title="Harry Carney">
<text>Harry Howell Carney (April 1, 1910 – October 8, 1974) was a jazz saxophonist and clarinettist who spent over four decades as a member of the Duke Ellington Orchestra. He played a variety of instruments, but primarily used the baritone saxophone, being a critical influence on the instrument in jazz.

==Early life==
Carney was born on April 1, 1910, in Boston, Massachusetts. In Boston, he grew up close to future bandmate Johnny Hodges. Carney began by playing the piano at age seven, moved to the clarinet at 14, and added the alto saxophone a year later. He first played professionally in clubs in Boston.

Early influences on Carney&#x27;s playing included Buster Bailey, Sidney Bechet, and Don Murray. Carney also reported that, for his baritone saxophone playing, he &quot;tried to make the upper register sound like Coleman Hawkins and the lower register like Adrian Rollini&quot;.

==Later life and career==
After playing a variety of gigs in New York City at the age of 17, Carney was invited to join the Duke Ellington band for its performances in Boston in 1927. He soon recorded with Ellington too, with a first session in October that year. Having established himself in the Ellington band, he stayed with it for the rest of his life. The band began a residency at the Cotton Club in New York at the end of the year.

After Ellington added more personnel in 1928, Carney&#x27;s main instrument became the baritone saxophone. He was a dominant figure on the baritone in jazz, with no serious rivals on the instrument until the advent of bebop in the mid-1940s. Within the overall sound of the Ellington band, Carney&#x27;s baritone was often employed to play parts of harmonies that were above the obvious low pitching of the instrument; this altered the textures of the band&#x27;s sound.

In January 1938, Carney was invited to play with Benny Goodman&#x27;s band at Carnegie Hall. Recordings from this event were released as &quot;The Famous 1938 Carnegie Hall Jazz Concert&quot;. Carney also took up the bass clarinet around 1944. He &quot;co-composed &quot;Rockin&#x27; in Rhythm&quot; and was usually responsible for executing the bubbling clarinet solo on this tune&quot;.

In 1957, Carney was part of a band led by pianist Billy Taylor that recorded the album &quot;Taylor Made Jazz&quot;.

Carney was the longest serving player in Ellington&#x27;s orchestra. On occasions when Ellington was absent or wished to make a stage entrance after the band had begun playing the first piece of a performance, Carney would serve as the band&#x27;s conductor. The Ellington orchestra typically travelled on a tour bus, but Ellington himself did not; he was driven separately by Carney, a &quot;quiet, calm presence&quot;.

Ellington wrote many showpiece features for Carney throughout their time together. In 1973 Ellington built the Third Sacred Concert around Carney&#x27;s baritone saxophone.

After Ellington&#x27;s 1974 death, Carney said: &quot;Without Duke, I have nothing to live for&quot;. Carney&#x27;s final recording may have been under Mercer Ellington&#x27;s leadership, for the album &quot;Continuum&quot;. Four months after Ellington&#x27;s death, Carney also died, on October 8, 1974, in New York.

==Influence and legacy==
Carney was an early jazz proponent of circular breathing. He was also Hamiet Bluiett&#x27;s favorite baritone player because he &quot;never saw anybody else stop time&quot; in reference to a concert Bluiett attended where Carney held a note during which all else went silent. Two months after Carney&#x27;s death, bassist Charles Mingus recorded Sy Johnson&#x27;s elegy &quot;For Harry Carney&quot;; the track was released on the album &quot;Changes Two&quot;.

<text>A teamster in American English is a truck driver; a person who drives teams of draft animals; or a member of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, a labor union. In some places, a teamster was called a carter, the name referring to the bullock cart. 

Originally the term &quot;teamster&quot; meant a person who drove a team, usually of oxen, horses, or mules, pulling a wagon, replacing the earlier &quot;teamer&quot;.

This term was common by the time of the Mexican–American War (1848) and the Indian Wars throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries on the American frontier.

Another name for the occupation was &quot;bullwhacker&quot;, related to driving oxen. A teamster might also drive pack animals, such as a muletrain, in which case he was also called a muleteer or muleskinner. Today this person may be called an outfitter or packer.

In Australian English, a teamster was also called a bullocker or bullocky and was sometimes used to denote a carrier.

From the Revolutionary War at least through World War I, United States Army enlisted personnel responsible for transporting supplies by wagon and for the upkeep of those draft animals were called wagoners.

<text>The Ranfurly Shield, colloquially known as the Log o&#x27; Wood, is a trophy in New Zealand&#x27;s domestic rugby union competition. First played for in 1904, the Shield is based on a challenge system. The holding union must defend the shield in challenge matches, which are usually played at the shield holder&#x27;s home venue, and if the challenger is successful in their challenge they will become the new holder of the Shield. There is a tradition for the first challenges of a new rugby season to be played against smaller associations from the Heartland Championship.

Although the professional era of rugby has seen other competitions, such as the NPC and Super Rugby, detracting from the pre-eminence of the Ranfurly Shield, many regard it as the greatest prize in New Zealand domestic rugby. This is mainly due to its long history, the fact that every challenge is a sudden-death defence of the Shield, and that any team has a chance to win.

 won the Shield from on 6 October 2024.

==History==
In 1901 the Governor of New Zealand, The 5th Earl of Ranfurly, announced that he would present a cup to the New Zealand Rugby Football Union to be used as the prize in a competition of their choosing. When the trophy, a shield, arrived, the NZRFU decided that it would be awarded to the union with the best record in the 1902 season, and thenceforth be the subject of a challenge system. Auckland, unbeaten in 1902, was presented with the shield. The shield was designed as a trophy for association football, not rugby. The picture in the centrepiece was a soccer one, and was modified by adding goal posts on the soccer goal in the picture to create a rugby scene. The alterations to the centrepiece are still apparent.

Auckland were on tour in 1903 and did not play any home games, and thus did not have to defend the Shield. Their first defence was against Wellington in 1904, and was unsuccessful.

Since the introduction of the National Provincial Championship in 1976, all home games a Shield-holder plays in the NPC or Heartland Championship, during league play are automatically challenge matches.

Auckland holds the record for the greatest number of consecutive Shield defences, 61 matches between 14 September 1985 and 18 September 1993. During this period Auckland took the Shield on tour to provincial unions that, mainly for financial reasons, would be unlikely to be able to mount a challenge for the trophy. While dismissed by some critics, usually because of the one-sided scores, it was mostly regarded as a success by those involved.

In 1994 when Canterbury wrested the Shield from Waikato, it was in battered condition, with large cracks, chips and peeled varnish. Nearly a century of use had taken its toll. Canterbury player Chris England, skilled in woodwork, fully renovated it, bringing it back into pristine condition.

In 2023 the Shield was restored over nine months by Tri Peek in Waikanae, Wellington, who had been repairing the trophy for several years before the full restoration decision. The original Oak shield was replaced with English Oak from the Hutt Valley in New Zealand, seasoned for 5 years. The badges, already recently replaced in 2012 were moved to the new shield.

The old Shield, which had gradually become worn down by 118 years of handling and an untold number of celebrations, has been blessed and decommissioned by NZ Rugby Māori cultural adviser Luke Crawford, recognising its status as a &quot;taonga&quot; in rugby. The replacement shield was accidentally broken after being dropped on a concrete floor in September 2023 just after Hawke&#x27;s Bay had won it from Wellington.

==Challenges==
The Shield holder at the end of each season is required to accept at least seven challenges for the following year. All home games during league play, but not during knockout playoffs, in the NPC or Heartland Championship are automatic challenges. The remaining shield defences must be made up of challenges from unions in the other domestic competition. For example, since North Harbour, an Air New Zealand Cup (now NPC) team, held the Shield at the end of the 2006 Cup season despite losing their home quarter-final to Otago, they were forced to defend the Shield against Heartland Championship teams during the 2007 pre-season. Having successfully done so, all their home fixtures in the round-robin phase were Shield defences until they lost the shield to Waikato.

The Shield-holder is never forced to defend the Shield in an away match, although they may choose to, as Auckland, for example, did on a number of occasions during their record tenure between 1985 and 1993. In 2008, Auckland played both their mandatory defences against Heartland teams on the road.

If a challenger successfully takes the Shield, all of their home matches for the rest of the season are defences of it.

===Proposed rule changes===
In August 2008, the New Zealand Rugby Union released a competitions review that proposed dramatic changes to the Shield rules:

* Once a team has successfully defended the Shield four times, all of the holder&#x27;s subsequent matches in league play would be mandatory defences, whether home or away. The Shield will not be at stake in semifinals or finals.
* If an Air New Zealand Cup team holds the Shield at the end of the league season, that season&#x27;s winners of the Meads Cup and Lochore Cup, the two trophies contested in the second-level Heartland Championship, will receive automatic challenges in the following year.

The changes were not implemented but did receive support from Auckland, which held the Shield when the NZRU released its report.

==Current teams==
Just under half of the unions that can contest for the Ranfurly Shield do not have an alias. South Canterbury&#x27;s emblem is their own Coat of Arms. But a soldier represents their green and black colour and current mascot, Tim and Ru. The mascots were originally used during wartime and were created by Ronald Murray. Many of the unions below have this situation, like Poverty Bay&#x27;s Weka, it resembles their mascot after the 2011 squads post-match photo after the Lochore Cup final.

<text>Marriage vows are promises each partner in a couple makes to the other during a wedding ceremony based upon Western Christian norms. They are not universal to marriage and not necessary in most legal jurisdictions. They are not even universal within Christian marriage, as Eastern Christians do not have marriage vows in their traditional wedding ceremonies.

==Background==
The oldest traditional wedding vows can be traced back to the manuals of the medieval church. In England, there were manuals of the dioceses of Salisbury (Sarum) and York. The compilers of the first &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;, published in 1549, based its marriage service mainly on the Sarum manual. Upon agreement to marry, the Church of England usually offered couples a choice. The couple could promise each other to &quot;love and cherish&quot; or, alternatively, the groom promises to &quot;love, cherish, and worship&quot;, and the bride to &quot;love, cherish, and obey&quot;.

==Western Christianity==
=== Roman Catholic ===
Couples wedding in the Latin Church of the Catholic Church essentially make the same pledge to one another. According to the Rite of Marriage (#25) the customary text in English is:

I, ____, take you, ____, to be my (husband/wife). I promise to be true to you in good times and in bad, in sickness and in health. I will love you and honour you all the days of my life.

In the United States, Catholic wedding vows may also take the following form:

I, ____, take you, ____, to be my lawfully wedded (husband/wife), to have and to hold, from this day forward, for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, until death do us part.

The priest will then say aloud &quot;You have declared your consent before the Church. May the Lord in his goodness strengthen your consent and fill you both with his blessings. What God has joined, men must not divide. Amen.&quot;

Historically, in the Sarum Rite of the Catholic Church, vow of the wife reads as follows:

N. Vis habere hunc uirum in sponsum et illi obedire et servire et eum diligere et honorare ac custodire sanum et infirmum sicut sponsa debet sponsum, etc.

In English, the bride says:

Ich .N. take the .N. to my weddyd housbonde to hau and to holden fro this day forward, for bettere, for wers, for richere for porere, in seknesse and in helthe to be boneyre and buxsum in bedde and at borde, tyl deth us departe, zif holi cherche hit wyle ordeyne and there to y plight the my treuthe.

===Lutheran===
The wedding vows used in the Lutheran Churches are as follows:

The law in England authorizes marriages to be legal if properly carried out and registered in the Church of England and some other religious bodies (e.g. Jewish, Quakers): other men and women who wish to marry can be married by a local official authorized to do so (civil ceremony). Circumstances may result in the same partners having both ceremonies at different times, though this is rare. The vows, presence of witnesses, and civil registration are absolute requirements under the law.

Civil ceremonies often allow couples to choose their own marriage vows, although many civil marriage vows are adapted from the traditional vows, taken from the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;, &quot;To have and to hold from this day forward, for better for worse, for richer for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish, till death us do part.&quot;

They were first published in English in the prayer book of 1549, based on earlier Latin texts (the Sarum and York Rituals of the medieval period). An older version of the final phrase is &quot;until death us depart&quot; where &quot;depart&quot; means &quot;separate&quot;. &quot;Until death us depart&quot; had to be changed due to changes in the usage of &quot;depart&quot; in the &quot;Prayer Book of 1662&quot;. In the 1928 prayer book (not authorized) and in editions of the 1662 prayer book printed thereafter &quot;obey&quot; was retained (in the 1928 book an alternative version omitted this). The 1928 revised form of Matrimony was quite widely adopted, though the form of 1662 was also widely used, though less so after the introduction of the &quot;Alternative Service Book&quot;.

The original wedding vows, as printed in the Book of Common Prayer, are:

Groom: I,____, take thee,_____, to be my wedded Wife, to have and to hold from this day forward, for better for worse, for richer for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish, till death us do part, according to God&#x27;s holy ordinance; and thereto I thee my .

Bride: I,_____, take thee,_____, to be my wedded Husband, to have and to hold from this day forward, for better for worse, for richer for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love, cherish, and to obey, till death us do part, according to God&#x27;s holy ordinance; and thereto I give thee my troth.

Then, as the groom places the ring on the bride&#x27;s finger, he says the following:

With this Ring I thee wed, with my body I thee worship, and with all my worldly goods I thee endow: In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.

In the &quot;Alternative Service Book&quot; (1980) two versions of the vows are included: the bride and groom must select one of the versions only. Version A:

I, ____, take you, ____, to be my wife (or husband), to have and to hold from this day forward, for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish, till death us do part, according to God&#x27;s holy law, and this is my solemn vow.

Version B is identical except for the clause &quot;to love and to cherish&quot; where the groom says &quot;to love, cherish, and worship&quot; and the bride says &quot;to love, cherish, and obey&quot;.

Since 2000 the service in &quot;Common Worship&quot; the normal vows are as follows:

I, &quot;N&quot;, take you, &quot;N&quot;, to be my wife (or husband), to have and to hold from this day forward, for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish, till death us do part, according to God&#x27;s holy law, in the presence of God I make this vow.

However, the bride and groom may choose to replace the clause &quot;to love and to cherish&quot; with &quot;to love, cherish, and obey&quot; when the bride makes her vows.

On September 12, 1922, the Episcopal Church voted to remove the word &quot;obey&quot; from the bride&#x27;s section of wedding vows. Other churches of the Anglican Communion each have their own authorized prayer books which in general follow the vows described above though the details and languages used do vary.

===Quaker===
In the United Kingdom, since the first law regulating marriage (the Marriage Act 1753), the state recognises marriages conducted by the Society of Friends (Quakers), Jews, and the Church of England.

The declarations made in Quaker marriage were first set down in a London Yearly Meeting minute in 1675 as such:

Man: Friends, in the fear of the Lord, and before this assembly, I take my friend &quot;AB&quot; to be my wife, promising, through divine assistance, to be unto her a loving and faithful husband, until it shall please the Lord by death to separate us.

Woman: Friends, in the fear of the Lord, and before this assembly, I take my friend &quot;CD&quot; to be my husband, promising, through divine assistance, to be unto him a loving and faithful wife, until it shall please the Lord by death to separate us.

The procedure is restated in a minute of London Yearly Meeting of 1754, and the declarations remained the same until the twentieth century. In July 1922, the Committee on the Marriage Declaration was set up, and this reported to London Yearly Meeting in 1923, and after reference to a further committee the final phrase was changed to &quot;as long as we both on earth shall live&quot;; although the option of &quot;until it shall please the Lord by death to separate us&quot; remained as an alternative.

The current declarations allowed in Britain Yearly Meeting is:

Friends, I take this my friend [name] to be my spouse, promising, through divine assistance, to be unto him/her a loving and faithful spouse, so long as we both on earth shall live.

The following alternatives are currently allowed:

* The declaration may be prefaced by &quot;In the presence of God&quot;
* The declaration may be prefaced by &quot;In the fear of the Lord and in the presence of this assembly&quot;
* The word &quot;spouse&quot; may be replaced by &quot;wife&quot; or &quot;husband&quot; as appropriate or by &quot;partner in marriage&quot;
* The phrase &quot;through divine assistance&quot; may be replaced by the words &quot;with God’s help&quot;
* The phrase &quot;so long as we both on earth shall live&quot; may be replaced by the words &quot;until it shall please the Lord by death to separate us&quot;
* The declaration may be made in Welsh in &quot;places where the Welsh tongue is used&quot;

== Civil marriage ==

===England and Wales===
Whilst couples may add to these, under the Marriage Act 1949, all civil marriage in England and Wales, and marriage by an authorised person (this includes religious marriage not carried out by the Anglican church, Jewish or Society of Friends (Quakers)), must include the following declaration and contracting words:

I do solemnly declare that I know not of any lawful impediment why I ____ may not be joined in matrimony to ____.

I call upon these persons here present to witness that I ____ do take thee ____ to be my lawfully wedded wife/husband.

The &quot;Marriage Ceremony (Prescribed Words) Act 1996&quot; allowed an alternative declaration of either:

I declare that I know of no legal reason why I ____ may not be joined in marriage to ____.

&quot;Registrar/Minister&quot;: Are you ____ free lawfully to marry ____&lt;br&gt;&quot;Man/Woman&quot;: I am. 

and an alternative of the contracting words of:
I ____ take you/thee ____ to be my wedded wife/husband.

==History==
The wedding vows as practised in most English-speaking countries derive ultimately from the Sarum rite of mediaeval England. The first part of the vows of the Sarum rite is given in Latin, but is instructed to be said by the priest &quot;in linguam materna&quot;, i.e. in the &quot;mother tongue&quot; of those present. The vows of the first English prayer book of 1549 mostly correspond to those of the Sarum rite.

<doc id="757080" wikidata="Q2106985" url="?curid=757080" title="The House I Live In (1945 film)">
<text>The House I Live In is a ten-minute short film written by Albert Maltz, produced by Frank Ross and Mervyn LeRoy, and starring Frank Sinatra. Made to oppose anti-Semitism at the end of World War II, it received an Honorary Academy Award and a special Golden Globe Award in 1946.

In 2007, this film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. It is also in the public domain.

==Plot==
Sinatra, playing himself, takes a break from a recording session and steps outside to smoke a cigarette. While outside, Sinatra sees more than ten boys chasing a dark-haired boy and intervenes, first with dialogue, then with a short speech. His main points are that we are &quot;all&quot; Americans and that one American&#x27;s blood is as good as another&#x27;s.

==Title song==

The song originally appeared in the musical revue &quot;Let Freedom Sing&quot;, which opened on Broadway on October 5, 1942. Brooks Atkinson wrote in &quot;The New York Times&quot;: &quot;Although Mordecai Bauman does not sing it particularly well, he sings it with earnest sincerity, without feeling that he must imitate youth by blasting the voice amplifying system and cutting a rug.&quot;
In the film, Sinatra sings the title song. His recording became a national hit. The music was written by Earl Robinson. Robinson was later blacklisted during the McCarthy era for being a member of the Communist Party. He also wrote campaign songs for the presidential campaigns of Franklin D. Roosevelt, Henry A. Wallace, and, in 1984, Jesse Jackson. The lyrics were written in 1943 by Abel Meeropol under the pen name Lewis Allan. In 1957, Meeropol adopted two boys, Michael and Robert, who had been orphaned when their parents Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed in 1953. Meeropol was enraged that the second verse of the song was not used in the film. When the film premiered, he protested against the deletion of the verse referring to &quot;my neighbors white and black&quot;.

The song was covered in later years by Paul Robeson, Mahalia Jackson, and Josh White. Sam Cooke also covered it. Kim Weston included it on her second post-Motown album &quot;This Is America&quot; (1968). Sinatra continued to include it in his repertory for decades. He performed it during a state dinner at the White House during the Nixon administration, at the 1985 inaugural ceremonies of Ronald Reagan, and at the ceremony marking the centenary of the Statue of Liberty that same year. Bill Cosby used a recording of the song to open some of his shows in 2002.

The song figures prominently in Arch Oboler&#x27;s radio play &quot;The House I Live In&quot;, which aired on April 26, 1945.
It was sung by Hope Foye.

<text>Robert Bowie Owens (October 29, 1870 – November 3, 1940) was a U.S. electrical engineer. He was the director of the Maryland Academy of Science. He was secretary of Franklin Institute from 1910 to 1924. He is credited as a discoverer of the alpha ray.

==Biography==
He was born October 29, 1870. Owens was a graduate of the Industrial College of Johns Hopkins University and Columbia University.

On August 19, 1891 he was employed as an adjunct professor in electrical engineering in the newly formed school of Electrical Engineering at the University of Nebraska. After seven years of service he left the now-department in shape comparable to other universities of the time, in August 1898, Owens took a position as MacDonald Chair of Electrical Engineering at McGill University in Montreal.

During his time at Nebraska, Owens was involved in forming &quot;The Society of Electrical Engineers of the University of Nebraska&quot; in 1893, the body which is known today as the IEEE.

Owens served as an officer in World War I, alongside General John J. Pershing.

He died on November 3, 1940.

<text>X (pronounced &quot;ten&quot;) is the eighth studio album by English rock band Def Leppard, released on 30 July 2002 by Island Records in the US and sister label Mercury worldwide. Much like 1996&#x27;s &quot;Slang&quot;, it featured another departure from their signature sound by moving into the pop genre. The album charted at No. 11 on The Billboard 200 and No. 14 on the UK Albums Chart. Most of the album was produced by Pete Woodroffe and the band, with remaining tracks produced by either Marti Frederiksen or Per Aldeheim and Andreas Carlsson.

==Background==
This is the first Def Leppard album in which drummer Rick Allen actively took part in song-writing. On all of the band&#x27;s prior albums, he is only credited with helping co-write three tracks. On this album alone, he co-wrote eleven. The album is also the first from the band to include original songs not to be written by any of the members: &quot;Unbelievable&quot; and &quot;Long, Long Way to Go&quot;, the latter of which was released as a single.

The album features the Roman numeral &#x27;X&#x27;, recognising it as their tenth album release, although the album is in fact only their eighth collection of all-new studio material. (The other two albums, &quot;Retro Active&quot; and &quot;&quot;, were a collection of B-sides and rarities, some re-recorded, and a greatest hits set respectively, although &quot;Vault&quot; also included a non-album single &quot;When Love &amp; Hate Collide&quot; as well as the single mixes of the songs &quot;Pour Some Sugar on Me&quot; and &quot;Rocket&quot;.)

The album &quot;X&quot; peaked at number 11 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, but did not sell to the standards of their previous releases and failed to earn any RIAA certifications. With the exception of an abbreviated version of &quot;Now&quot; being performed as part of an acoustic medley during the Rock of Ages Tour in 2012, nothing from this album was performed live by the band since the conclusion of its supporting tour until their Las Vegas residency in 2019.

For a short time after the album was released, Def Leppard&#x27;s website Defleppard.com featured a free mp3 download of &quot;Perfect Girl,&quot; a bonus track and early version of the track &quot;Gravity&quot;.

The album was released on vinyl for the first time in 2019 alongside 3 other albums from the 2000s, &quot;Yeah!&quot; and &quot;Songs from the Sparkle Lounge&quot;, before being released standalone later the same year.

==Reception==
&quot;X&quot; received mixed reviews. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic rated the album 2.5 out of 5. While commending the band for not adopting the then-popular nu metal and rap rock sound of the time, Erlewine lamented that the band&#x27;s pop rock approach meant that &quot;they&#x27;ve left rock behind, turning out a bunch of even-handed adult-pop that is melodic without being tuneful, or memorable for that matter.&quot; He concludes that, in some instances on &quot;X&quot;, &quot;Leppard still shows signs of being a great band -- there&#x27;s a chorus or a bridge here and there with spark, &quot;You&#x27;re So Beautiful&quot; and &quot;Everyday&quot; are the kind of sugar-sweet, heavy-pop songs that make this band so irresistible—but the slick production and self-conscious maturity make &quot;X&quot; a leaden affair, unfortunately.&quot;

Conversely, Rob Sheffield of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; was more positive, favorably comparing &quot;X&quot; to Bon Jovi&#x27;s &quot;Crush&quot;. Sheffield notes how &quot;since the Lepsters always had catchier beats and craftier tunes than the metal competition, they adapt to global pop with their signature sound intact, and &quot;X&quot; may be their niftiest since &quot;Adrenalize&quot;.&quot;

<text>The Roxy Theatre (often just the Roxy) is a nightclub on the Sunset Strip in West Hollywood, California, owned by Lou Adler and his son, Nic.

== History ==
The Roxy was opened on September 20, 1973, by Elmer Valentine and Lou Adler, along with original partners David Geffen, Elliot Roberts and Peter Asher. They took over the building previously occupied by a strip club owned by Chuck Landis called the Largo. (Adler was also responsible for bringing the stage play &quot;The Rocky Horror Show&quot; to the United States, and it opened its first American run at The Roxy Theatre in 1974, before it was made into the movie &quot;The Rocky Horror Picture Show&quot; the next year.)
Neil Young and the Santa Monica Flyers (billed as Crazy Horse, a related ensemble) played the Roxy for the first three days it was open. Only three months later, the Genesis lineup with Peter Gabriel played several consecutive days at the Roxy, a run that some band members and many fans consider to be amongst their finest performances (due in part, to the intimate atmosphere and good acoustics of the venue).

Paul Reubens, then a struggling comedian, introduced his Pee-wee Herman character in a raunchy revue here in 1981 that included such aspiring comics as Phil Hartman and Elayne Boosler.

Tom Eyen&#x27;s hit comedy &quot;Women Behind Bars&quot; enjoyed a long extended run with such stars as Lu Leonard, Adrienne Barbeau, Sally Kellerman, and Linda Blair, and was the site of the first AIDS benefit held in Los Angeles on July 27, 1983.

In January 2014, Goldenvoice became the exclusive promoter for The Roxy and ushered in a new era by bringing in big-name acts such as U2 and Foo Fighters.

<text>Wartburg College is a private Lutheran liberal arts college in Waverly, Iowa.

== History ==
Wartburg College was founded in 1852 in Saginaw, Michigan, by Georg M. Grossmann, a native of Neuendettelsau, Bavaria. Pastor Wilhelm Löhe sent Grossmann to establish a pastor training school for German immigrants. The college moved many times between Illinois and Iowa before settling in Waverly in 1935. Also in 1935, St. Paul Luther College in Saint Paul, Minnesota, merged with Wartburg College.

The college is named after Wartburg Castle in Eisenach, Germany, where Martin Luther was protected during the stormy days of the Reformation. Student and alumni groups often travel to the castle, and the Wartburg Choir has performed there several times. Waverly and Eisenach are sister towns and often swap foreign exchange students. The college is proud of its German heritage and celebrates an annual student-declared one-day holiday, Outfly, a deliberately mistaken translation of the German noun . Outfly is the most enduring Wartburg tradition. The first mention of comes from Mendota, Illinois, in 1883, when students went on a Friday-Saturday excursion to nearby Starved Rock, now a state park. Faculty minutes for October 5, 1892, note that was scheduled for the next day.

Old Main, the oldest building on campus, was built in 1880 for the Wartburg Teachers Seminary. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978 under the name Wartburg Teachers&#x27; Seminary.

The longstanding rivalry between Wartburg and Luther College in Decorah, Iowa, has produced some colorful moments. The rivalry&#x27;s origins are unclear. Stories of pranks date to the 1940s. For the most part, the rivalry has been characterized by fun and good sportsmanship. It rose to new heights in October 1996, when two Wartburg cross-country runners rented a light plane, flew to Decorah, and dropped leaflets on the Luther campus. The incident was reported in every major Iowa newspaper, got national mention on Fox, and made &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the most memorable college pranks of 1996–97. The creativity in the rivalry continued when student staff members of the college radio station, KWAR, secretly entered a float in the Luther College Homecoming Parade. The staff members decorated the float as an environmental club, the &quot;Organization of Nature Enthusiasts&quot;, from Luther College. In front of the judges&#x27; stand the float quickly changed color from blue and white to orange and black. It continued all the way through town and onto Luther&#x27;s campus, with numerous Wartburg students joining the procession from the crowd.

In 2022, Rebecca Ehretsman became Wartburg&#x27;s first female president.

<text>Hutchinson Heinemann is a British publishing firm founded in 1887. It is currently an imprint which is ultimately owned by Bertelsmann, the German publishing conglomerate.

==History==
Hutchinson Heinemann began as Hutchinson &amp; Co. (Publishers) Ltd., an English book publisher, founded in London in 1887 by Sir George Hutchinson and later run by his son, Walter Hutchinson (1887–1950). Hutchinson&#x27;s published books and magazines such as &quot;The Lady&#x27;s Realm&quot;, &quot;Adventure-story Magazine&quot;, &quot;Hutchinson&#x27;s Magazine&quot; and &quot;Woman&quot;.

In the 1920s, Walter Hutchinson published many of the &quot;spook stories&quot; of E. F. Benson in &quot;Hutchinson&#x27;s Magazine&quot; and then in collections in a number of books. The company also first published Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s Professor Challenger novels, five novels by mystery writer Harry Stephen Keeler, and short stories by Eden Phillpotts. In 1929, Walter Hutchinson stopped publishing magazines to concentrate on books. In the 1930s, Hutchinson published H. G. Wells&#x27;s &quot;The Bulpington of Blup&quot; as well as the first English translations of Vladimir Nabokov&#x27;s &quot;Camera Obscura&quot; (translated by Winifred Roy with Nabokov credited as Vladimir Nabokoff-Sirin) in 1936 and &quot;Despair&quot; (translated by Nabokov himself) under its John Long marque of paperbacks.

In 1947, the company launched the Hutchinson University Library book series.

Among notable, non-fiction books, in 1959, Hutchinson &amp; Co. published the first English edition of Karl Popper&#x27;s most famous work, &quot;The Logic of Scientific Discovery&quot;, first published as &quot;Logik der Forschung&quot; in 1934.

The company merged with Century Publishing in 1985 to form Century Hutchinson. The new company acquired Blond, Muller and White in 1987. Century Hutchinson was folded into the British Random House Group in 1989, briefly known as Random Century (1990 - 92), Century became an imprint of Cornerstone Publishing, a publishing house of Penguin Random House UK, which is in turn a division of Penguin Random House, which itself, since 2013, was owned jointly by Bertelsmann and Pearson plc and since 2019, just by Bertelsmann. In 2021, Penguin Random House merged William Heinemann, Hutchinson and Windmill into Hutchinson Heinemann.

<text>A Stargate is a fictional Einstein–Rosen bridge portal device within the &quot;Stargate&quot; fictional universe that allows practical, point-to-point near instantaneous travel between two distant locations with an &quot;address&quot;. The devices first appeared in the 1994 Roland Emmerich film &quot;Stargate&quot;, and thereafter in the television series &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot;, &quot;Stargate Infinity&quot;, &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot;, &quot;Stargate Universe&quot;, and &quot;Stargate Origins&quot;. In these productions, the Stargate functions as a plot device, allowing the main characters to visit alien planets without the need for spaceships or any other type of technology. The device allows for near-instantaneous teleportation across both interstellar and extragalactic distances.

==Concept==
Some early &quot;portal&quot; appearances in science fiction include A. E. van Vogt&#x27;s novella &quot;Secret Unattainable&quot; (July 1942, &quot;Astounding&quot;), a radio episode of &quot;Space Patrol&quot; that aired October 25, 1952 (in which it was called a &quot;cycloplex&quot; or a &quot;hole in space&quot;), and Robert A. Heinlein&#x27;s &quot;Tunnel in the Sky&quot; (1955) and its &quot;Ramsbotham jump&quot;. In &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;, Arthur C. Clarke uses the term &quot;Star Gate&quot; for the large monolith &quot;sentinel&quot; TMA-2, which is a classic stargate portal to another part of the universe.

The basic stargate concept is that it has at least two devices in distant positions, and when active, the rings of each become similar to a physical, singular gateway or door-frame between the two locations. The concept was developed by the writers of the feature film &quot;Stargate&quot;, Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich. Similar devices had been seen in previous fiction, and there has been contention as to whether they plagiarized the idea from a previous script submission from a student of Egyptology named Omar Zuhdi, who submitted a screenplay to them about ten years before the movie was made. Zuhdi pursued legal action regarding this, and the case was eventually settled out of court.

Much of the inspiration for the functioning of the device is drawn heavily from theoretical astrophysics, particularly that of black holes and wormholes, a staple of science fiction, often used to create &quot;shortcuts&quot; through space. Although these may exist in reality, it is not widely held to be true that any such phenomenon could safely transport a human being, as such wormholes would most likely be created by excessive gravity (e.g., from a black hole), which would destroy any potential traveler.

== Plot ==

===Films===

The &quot;Stargate&quot; film begins in 1928, when the alien device is first discovered and unearthed at Giza, with a young Catherine Langford watching as her father Paul, the archaeologist who found it, directs its unearthing. &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; has since revealed more of the backstory of the Earth Stargate. The American ship &quot;Achilles&quot; brought the gate to America in 1939 to prevent it from falling into the hands of the Nazis. The United States Air Force then stored the device in various locations —including Washington, DC—before installing it at its location of the film and series. The Stargate was studied in the 1940s as a potential weapon and was later mothballed. As the &quot;Stargate&quot; film quickly skips to the &quot;present day&quot; (1994), unsuccessful archaeologist Daniel Jackson is giving a lecture about his outlandish theories that the pharaoh Khufu did not build the Great Pyramid of Giza. After he is laughed away, an aged Catherine Langford meets with him and recruits his egyptological talent, taking him to a top-secret military base at Cheyenne Mountain, where he is instructed to decipher the unique Egyptian hieroglyphs present on a set of cover-stones. He realizes that the indecipherable glyphs are not actually words but images of constellations, such that by identifying 6 of them a position in space can be extrapolated. He is then shown the stargate itself, uses his new understanding to identify the 7th symbol (the point of origin allowing a route to be extrapolated), and the gate is opened for the first time.

Because thousands of combinations had been previously tried and had failed, it was believed at the time that only two stargates existed, connecting Earth and the planet Abydos, which was visited in the film and was at the time erroneously believed to be located in the Kaliam Galaxy, billions of light years away on the other side of the known universe. At the beginning of the &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; series, however, a large set of additional valid coordinates were discovered engraved in ruins on Abydos. Because of the stellar drift accumulated over millions of years, other addresses were impossible to dial until Samantha Carter reworked the dialing system on Earth to account for this movement. After this, a massive network of possible connections suddenly became available. Even more addresses were later uncovered by Colonel Jack O&#x27;Neill from a repository of Ancient knowledge. In order to allow for dialing back to Earth from other locations (without altering the dialing system), it was later stated that the DHD (&quot;Dial-Home Device&quot;) normally attached to each stargate automatically updates for stellar drift; Earth&#x27;s stargate lacks its DHD, requiring other accommodation.

The alien race encountered in the original movie is later developed in &quot;SG-1&quot; as the Goa&#x27;uld, the dominant evil power in the Milky Way. The leaders of this race, the System Lords, pose as gods and use the stargates to transport slaves between worlds. This has resulted in a large number of planets throughout the galaxy supporting human life, often in civilizations more primitive than Earth. The majority of these civilizations, descended from former Goa&#x27;uld slaves, treat the Stargate as a religious relic, often as a source of long-forgotten fear and evil.

Direct-to-video films &quot;&quot; (2008) and &quot;&quot; (also 2008) expand upon the &quot;Stargate&quot; lore.

===Television===
For most of the run of &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot;, Earth was under constant threat from the Goa&#x27;uld, and is no match for their superior technology. In the face of this threat, the US Air Force established a top-secret base, the SGC (Stargate Command), as a frontline defence. Multiple teams are formed and sent on missions through the stargate, their primary objective being exploration, and through it the discovery of intelligence, technology and allies to help in the fight against the Goa&#x27;uld. The primary team is called SG-1, and the series follows their adventures.

For a long time, it was thought that the Goa&#x27;uld were the builders of the Stargate network, but it was later discovered that they had merely made use of the relics left behind by a different and extinct race, the Ancients. At the climax of &quot;SG-1&quot;&#x27;s 6th season, Daniel Jackson discovers that the Earth myth of Atlantis is in fact founded on the Lost City of the Ancients, and Season 7 is spent trying to locate it. At the beginning of the show &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot;, which coincides with the beginning of &quot;SG-1&quot;&#x27;s 8th season, the city is found in the Pegasus Galaxy, and 8 chevrons are dialed to send an expedition there on what could be a one-way trip, due to the massive power required to generate a wormhole to another galaxy. It is there that they discover a new network of stargates, and are plagued by the nemesis of the Ancients, the Wraith. During the events of &quot;The Ark of Truth&quot;, it is revealed that the pre-ascended Ancient known as Amelius originated the concept of the Stargate and wormhole travel.

In the events of the third television series, &quot;Stargate Universe&quot;, a third generation of stargates is discovered, which allegedly predates the model originally discovered in the Milky Way galaxy. This model, discovered as a result of a three-month expedition to unlock the stargate&#x27;s ninth and final chevron, was first encountered on board the ancient research vessel &quot;Destiny&quot;, which has been traversing the universe for several million years uncrewed, and is several billion light years away from Earth. It is discovered that the Ancients constructed the vessel to be launched after a number of stargate seed ships were dispersed in the universe in order to follow in their path and stop at each planet at which a stargate was deposited. &quot;Destiny&quot; would then extract any relevant data from the planetary stargate in order to further complete research into an apparent signal embedded in the Cosmic microwave background radiation. This &quot;prototype&quot;, or &quot;beta&quot;, generation of gates has a limited range; one storyline in the series saw an exploratory team being left behind when &quot;Destiny&quot; jumped into hyperspace without them, requiring them to plot the ship&#x27;s course and travel to various other &quot;beta&quot; Stargates until they found one in range of &quot;Destiny&quot;. In addition, when a dialing sequence commences, the entire ring (as opposed to an inner track, like Milky Way-era gates) rotates clockwise and counterclockwise in an alternating pattern until the final chevron is locked and a wormhole is established. Finally, the event horizon of the wormhole also appears a slightly more silver color than later generations. Possibly due to the nature of how these stargates were deposited on hundreds of thousands of planets, no planetary DHD is present. Rather, explorers from &quot;Destiny&quot; are required to bring an Ancient remote control that can command the gate to dial an address in addition to other functions, presenting them with a list of accessible Stargates.

== Operation ==

Within the &quot;Stargate&quot; fictional universe, stargates are hyper-advanced large rings that allow interplanetary and intergalactic travel. Objects can travel only from the origin to the destination, while certain electromagnetic waves can travel either way (for instance, visible light does not pass through at all, but radio transmissions pass in both directions).

A stargate&#x27;s destination is not fixed; any stargate can connect to any other stargate in the network. Stargates have an inner ring akin to a rotary dial inscribed with a number of symbols, and nine prominent points (&quot;chevrons&quot;) spaced equally around their circumference. Between 7 and 9 symbols are combined to identify a destination, by assigning them to each of the chevrons in sequence. These &quot;addresses&quot; are selected by turning the ring until the next symbol in the address is correctly aligned, which associates it with the next chevron. The 8th chevron, if used, specifies a different galaxy; the first 6 chevrons identify points in space within that galaxy to triangulate a physical location; the 7th is a symbol unique to the specific gate, which identifies it as the point of origin; and the 9th is reserved for special destinations.

The gates were originally constructed with complementary control panels nearby, inscribed with the same symbols as can be found on the ring. Pressing these symbols would supply power to the gate and cause the inner ring to spin automatically until the selected symbol is aligned and the chevron engaged. However the gate can also be dialled by manually forcing the ring to move into each position.

Once a valid address is dialed by the traveler, if a functioning counterpart device exists close enough to those coordinates, the stargate generates a stable wormhole between itself and its counterpart.

The advanced technology of the stargate allows it to accept a wide range of power sources, which it can absorb by direct conduction if required. The power source in most situations is provided by the control panel, which contains a long-lasting power source.

Objects in transit between gates are broken down into their individual elemental components, and then into energy as they pass through the event horizon, and then travel through a wormhole before being reconstructed on the other side. The journey takes a few seconds, even for the greatest distances. Objects passing between stargates behave as if they pass through a doorway; momentum, for instance, is conserved at either end of the wormhole.

Human travellers exit the stargate with a sense of the journey that has been traversed. This normally feels effortless, but if the stargate has been improperly operated or is not functioning correctly, can be an uncomfortable experience.

===Addresses===
Each location in the &quot;Stargate&quot; universe has its own unique &quot;address&quot;, which is a combination of six or more non-repeating symbols appearing on the dialing stargate. By &quot;dialing&quot; these symbols in the correct order, the traveler selects a three-dimensional destination.


The symbols dialed are often referred to as &quot;coordinates&quot;, and are written as an ordered string; for example, this is the address used in the show for the planet Abydos: (corresponding to the constellations of Taurus, Serpens Caput, Capricornus, Monoceros, Sagittarius and Orion). As explained by Dr. Daniel Jackson in the movie, the Stargate requires seven correct symbols to connect to another Stargate. As shown in the picture opposite, the first six symbols act as coordinates, creating three intersecting lines, the destination. The Stargate uses the seventh symbol as the point of origin allowing one to plot a straight line course to the destination. With the stargates of the Milky Way, with 38 address symbols and one point of origin, there are 1,987,690,320 possible six symbol co-ordinates (leading to 38!/(38-6)!/8/6=41,410,215 addresses as the six symbol addresses are composed of three tuples that can be permuted in 6 ways and the two symbols within each tuple are invariant for 8 more permutations.). With the stargates of the Pegasus or Destiny, with 35 address symbols and one point of origin, there are only 1,168,675,200 possible six symbol coordinates.
By identifying six constellations in space, a single sextangulation point can be interpolated that corresponds to the destination desired. As only a small portion of the possible combinations of Stargate symbols represent valid addresses, dialing the Gate at random is largely futile. In &quot;Children of the Gods&quot;, SG-1 discovers a room on Abydos with a list of valid Stargate addresses and (luckily) a map that allows the SGC to compensate for thousands of years of stellar drift. In the series, the fictional planet Abydos could be dialed because it is relatively close to Earth, although in the film, Abydos was located in the fictional Kaliam Galaxy. It was initially believed that the Goa&#x27;uld created the Stargates, but this was proven false in &quot;The Torment of Tantalus&quot; when the SGC discovered that Earth had accidentally dialled an address in 1945 that was not on the Abydos cartouche. Following this revelation, a larger list of Stargate addresses is provided by Jack O&#x27;Neill in &quot;The Fifth Race&quot; from knowledge downloaded into his mind by a repository of the Ancients, allowing them to travel to worlds unknown to the Goa&#x27;uld. In &quot;Rising&quot;, a list of Stargate addresses in the Pegasus galaxy is found in the Atlantis database. The SGC assigns designations to Stargate-accessible planets in the form P&quot;xx-xxx&quot; or M&quot;xx-xxx&quot;. Samantha Carter explains in &quot;The Broca Divide&quot; that the designation &quot;is based on a binary code the computer uses for extrapolation&quot;.

Eight-symbol addresses are introduced in &quot;The Fifth Race&quot;, opening up new plot lines by connecting Stargates to different galaxies. The additional symbol acts as a type of &quot;area code&quot;. Such connections, in comparison to seven symbol codes, require substantially more energy to complete a functional wormhole – much more than any standard dialing method can provide. In the first instance, opening an intergalactic wormhole is shown to exceed the total power generation capacity of the SGC at the time. O&#x27;Neill fashioned an additional power source using spare parts and the liquid naquadah power core of a staff weapon using the same enhanced knowledge that had allowed him to determine this address in the first place, but this new power source only functioned twice and required repair work to operate the second time. A fully charged Zero Point Module (ZPM) can provide enough power for regular travel between galaxies. The 8th chevron is a key element in the Stargate Atlantis series, allowing travel to the Pegasus Galaxy. For the stargates of the Milky Way, with 38 address symbols and one point of origin, there are 63,606,090,240 possible seven symbol coordinates. The stargates of the Pegasus or Destiny, with 35 address symbols and one point of origin, provide only 33,891,580,800 possible seven symbol coordinates.

&quot;Stargate Universe&quot; introduces the concept of a nine-symbol address, the purpose of the ninth chevron never having been explored in the previous series. The nine-symbol addresses act as codes to dial specific Stargates, with the only two known nine-symbol addresses used to dial from the Milky Way galaxy to &quot;Destiny&quot;, a massive Ancient vessel that was part of a project to explore the universe, with the project being abandoned when they started researching into ascension among other things, and from &quot;Destiny&quot; to Earth. It is unknown if any other Stargates are reachable with a nine-symbol address, or if this is a feature unique to the Stargates on Destiny and Earth. Like eight-symbol addresses, the dialing of this address requires a significant amount of power, such that the scientists on Icarus Base had to tap into the planet&#x27;s naqahdriah core. With the Stargates of the Milky Way, with 38 address symbols, there are 1,971,788,797,440 possible eight-symbol destinations. With the Stargates of the Pegasus or Destiny, with 35 address symbols, there are only 948,964,262,400 possible eight symbol destinations. Provided the ninth symbol is your point of origin. If the ninth symbol can also be added to the destination, even 59,153,663,923,200 combinations with a Milky Way stargate or 25,622,035,084,800 combinations with a Pegasus or Destiny Stargate are possible.

===Dial-Home Device===
There are a handful of methods used in the shows to dial a Stargate, and the most common is with the use of a Dial-Home Device. Almost always referred to as the &quot;DHD&quot; for short, it is depicted as a pedestal-shaped device with a round inclined control panel on top, consisting of two concentric circles of &quot;keys&quot; and a translucent red (Milky Way) or blue (Pegasus) hemisphere in the center; the keys represent the symbols on the rim of the Stargate. By pressing these keys a traveler builds an address. The central hemisphere serves as an &quot;Enter&quot; key to activate the Stargate once a destination has been dialed. Each DHD only has 38 keys, 19 on each ring. According to Dr. Zelenka, dialing an address leaves a small imprint on the control crystals of the DHD, and about fifty addresses can be recovered from a DHD using the proper equipment. However, this gives no indication of the order in which the addresses were dialed, and no guarantee can be made as to the accuracy of the recovered addresses.
The Atlantis DHD is more similar to the Earth&#x27;s dialing computer than an actual DHD, and looks more like a set of crystal panels. It can block out certain gate addresses. The Atlantis DHD also has an extra control-crystal allowing the dialing of an eighth chevron during the dialing sequence and is the only DHD in the Pegasus Galaxy capable of dialing Earth. A similar DHD is also used on Puddle Jumpers, where the set of used glyphs corresponds to the galaxy of the Puddle Jumper. The Wraith also travel through Stargates in small spacecraft called darts and have some means of remote-dialing them in a manner similar to Ancient ships.

The show makes it clear that every Stargate originally had its own DHD, located directly in front of the gate and facing it. Over time, however, some DHDs have been damaged or lost. This has been the source of plot difficulties for the protagonists on several occasions, as it is still possible to travel to a Stargate that lacks a DHD, meaning that dialing home again will be much more difficult, if not impossible. One of the primary functions of the Mobile Analytic Laboratory Probe (M.A.L.P.), an unmanned ground vehicle that precedes an SG team, is to confirm the presence of a DHD. In the absence of a DHD, a user must select the address by manually rotating the inner ring of the Stargate, and use an external power source, as the ring will not rotate unless it is energised. Pegasus Galaxy Stargates do not have a movable ring, so manually dialing these is impossible. Travelers can also emulate a DHD through a dialing computer as present at Stargate Command. Remote dialers have been used by several races like the Goa&#x27;uld and Asgard in various episodes. As the Stargates in Stargate Universe are a different (less advanced model) the crew of the Destiny are forced to use such a device as no planet visited so far has any variation of DHD present.

===Wormhole===

Once an address is dialed, the gate is said to have created a &quot;stable wormhole&quot; between itself and the gate dialed. The creation process is depicted with great consistency, and hence has become one of the defining motifs of &quot;Stargate&quot;, at times being central in both the &quot;SG-1&quot; and &quot;Atlantis&quot; title sequences. It involves the generation of the &quot;puddle of water&quot; portal that lasts roughly two seconds, and is completed by the ejection of an unstable energy vortex resembling a surge of water or quicksilver. The vortex is portrayed as a symbol of the stargate&#x27;s power, invariably causing characters to become affected by awe. Any matter that comes into contact with the vortex is annihilated on a molecular level, as is dramatically demonstrated by a pair of smoking shoes in the episode &quot;Prisoners&quot;. In season 9&#x27;s &quot;Crusade&quot;, the unstable vortex was onomatopoeidiacally referred to by Col. Carter as the &quot;Kawoosh&quot;, emulating the sound of the initial vortex. This aspect has been used in some cases to dispose of highly hazardous materials. The vortex is also used on one occasion to dispose of a body in a formal funeral service – the body was placed on a pyre in front of the gate, which was then activated.

The actual portal of a Stargate appears inside the inner ring when an address is correctly dialed. This has the appearance of a vertical puddle of water, which represents the &quot;event horizon&quot; in the show. In non-fictional parlance, an event horizon is the perimeter around a black hole or wormhole beyond which the gravitational pull of the singularity would be too strong to overcome. The wavering undulations characteristic of water are supposed to represent the &quot;fluctuations in the event horizon&quot;. This puddle may then be entered (usually accompanied by a watery squishing sound), and the traveler will emerge from a similar pool at the destination Stargate.

The show makes it clear that transit is strictly one-way; an attempt to travel &quot;backwards&quot; causes the traveler to be destroyed. Although in the first episode the Goa&#x27;uld who come through at the beginning appear to walk back through the event horizon after taking a hostage, in actuality they dialed out again using a hand-held device, as the whooshing sound is audible in the background. As matter is only transmitted through a Stargate once the whole object has passed the event horizon, a person or object could be retrieved from the event horizon before entering completely, as the Stargate would automatically reintegrate the traveler.
Passage through a Stargate&#x27;s wormhole is depicted as a visual effect of shooting through a tunnel in space. The average travel time between Stargates is 3.2 seconds. In the movie and early &quot;SG-1&quot; episodes, travelers exit from the Stargate covered in frost and at high speed (often being knocked from their feet), feeling as though they have been on a &quot;roller coaster ride&quot;. The character Major Charles Kawalsky describes Stargate travel as worse than &quot;pulling out of a simulated bombing run in an F-16 at eight-plus &quot;g&quot;&quot;, with Major Louis Ferretti adding that on the other side one is &quot;frozen stiff like having just been through a blizzard naked&quot;. In later episodes the experience is no different from stepping through a door, explained as a result of refinements made to the dialing computer at the SGC.

Under normal circumstances, a wormhole can only be maintained for slightly more than 38 minutes. Extending the wormhole duration beyond that requires tremendous amounts of power, such as that provided by a nearby black hole.

While the &quot;kawoosh&quot; effect in the movie was created by filming the actual swirl of water in a glass tube, and looked like a vortex on the back of the Gate, on the TV series, this effect was completely created in CG by the Canadian visual effects company Rainmaker&quot;.&quot; At the beginning of Season 9, the original movie wormhole sequence was substituted by a new sequence similar to the one already used on &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot; but tinted bright blue (whereas in &quot;Atlantis&quot; it is green). &quot;Stargate Universe&quot; uses a darker shade of blue.

Throughout the run of the television franchise, it cost $5,000 to show a person stepping through the event horizon, using visual effects.

==Other variants==
*Orlin&#x27;s Stargate In the &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; episode &quot;Ascension&quot;, the outcast Ancient, Orlin, builds a miniature Stargate in Samantha Carter&#x27;s basement. Its stated components included 100 pounds of pure raw titanium, of fiber optic cable, seven 100,000 watt industrial strength capacitors, and a toaster. This gate was hooked up to the main power supply of the house and only connected once, to Velona, before burning out.
*Tollan Stargate In &quot;Pretense&quot;, the advanced Tollan civilization is shown to have a new Stargate, built with the assistance of the Nox. Jack O&#x27;Neill sarcastically mocks the Tollan gate, saying &quot;Ours is bigger&quot;. The Tollan Stargate is destroyed by the Goa&#x27;uld in &quot;Between Two Fires&quot;.
*Ori &quot;Supergate&quot; In the ninth season of &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot;, the Ori were introduced as the new main enemy for the show. The Ori employ extremely large Stargates to move their fleet of warships from their home galaxy to the Milky Way. Dubbed &quot;Supergates&quot;, these devices are composed of 90 individual segments and are powered by a quantum singularity.
*McKay-Carter Intergalactic Gate Bridge Introduced in season 3 of &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot;, the Gate Bridge is a chain of Stargates placed between the Milky Way and the Pegasus galaxies, allowing movement between Atlantis and Earth without the need for a ZPM or the &quot;Daedalus&quot;. Halfway along the Bridge is Midway Station, where travelers switch from one galaxy&#x27;s gate system to the other. The Bridge is hijacked by the Wraith in the episode &quot;Midway&quot;, and the Midway Station is destroyed as a result of Wraith tampering in the control systems. As a result of the destruction of the Midway Station, the gate bridge has since become inoperative.
*Asuran satellite weapon In the &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot; season 3 finale, &quot;First Strike&quot;, the Asurans send a satellite weapon to attack Atlantis in response to the &quot;Apollo&quot;&#x27;s bombing of their homeworld. The weapon consists of an eight-chevron Stargate, hyperdrive, shield, and a navigation system. Once it reaches its target, the Stargate activates and the Asurans fire an energy beam through.
*The &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot; series finale demonstrates the wormhole drive, essentially taking the Stargate concept and applying it to an interstellar vessel. The drive allows Atlantis to move from the edge of the Milky Way galaxy to Earth in moments, similar to a Stargate, but uses a tremendous amount of power. It also requires precise calculation to successfully arrive at the target destination without destroying the ship.

== Making of the props ==
Two full Stargate props were originally built for the &quot;SG-1&quot; pilot &quot;Children of the Gods&quot;, the second of which was reconstructed from the prop used in the film. They are made of steel and fiberglass, and are in diameter. The second prop is less detailed, and is used for exterior scenes; in the pilot it was used solely on the planet Chulak. The primary one is fully automated and capable of rotating and emitting light. This is achieved by the use of a specially designed circular gear, which turns the inner ring on a precise pinion drive wheel, using an eight horsepower electric motor. The top seven chevrons emit laser pulses that are read by a sensor fed into a computer responsible for the gate&#x27;s movement, which is consequently able to start and stop the rotation very quickly. This main prop is kept almost immovably at the permanent set of the SGC, at Bridge Studios, Vancouver.

There are further Stargate props that are no more than two-dimensional or semi-three-dimensional (jar-lid shaped) Stargates, being more lightweight and easier to erect on location. These are always filmed front-on to preserve the illusion. If a shot involves the iris, this is added in post-production, as the mechanics of it opening and closing would be very difficult to build. However, when a Stargate is filmed with just a closed iris (i.e. without it moving), a tangible prop is inserted into place.

The visual effects for &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; and &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot; are predominantly produced by Rainmaker Digital Effects, a notable visual-effects studio. However, some effects, including the entire Ori battle sequence in the episode &quot;Camelot&quot;, were done &quot;in-house&quot;. The unstable vortex effect, both in the film and the early seasons of the series, on account of being &quot;difficult to achieve&quot; was generated only once and recorded from various angles; this recording was the same used for all gate opening shots early in the series. Rather than being a jet of water, it is actually the image of high-pressure air being blasted &quot;into&quot; a tank of water. The effect was achieved by mounting a jet airplane engine two feet above a water tank, and using its windstream to create the sufficient water displacement. In post production, the surrounding water was removed with computer editing, and the image of the air-jet pasted into the center of the opening stargate. This technique was only used for earlier episodes, and the effect was replicated digitally soon after to allow more flexibility in shots.

To cut down on costs, the opening of a Stargate is often just &quot;implied&quot; rather than shown, by a costless sound-effect followed by distinct lighting effects characteristic of light shining through water (as the event horizon is depicted). The DVD commentary for &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; explains that these effects are produced by reflecting light off large sheets of vibrating Mylar.
The Stargate itself is nearly always filmed against a blue or green backdrop, not only making it easier to paste the vortex imagery onto the scene, but also facilitating the superimposition of the &quot;event horizon ripple effect&quot;, which is entirely computer-generated. However, if a shot only involves an open wormhole without anyone stepping through it, the crew may choose to use a &quot;practical puddle,&quot; which is simply a backlit screen placed in the gate displaying a video of the wormhole effect. This only works, however, on a darker set, as otherwise the projection will get washed out. On occasion, the Stargate itself is also completely swapped out for a computer generated model, usually in cases where it is being moved, or is depicted in space. Series producer Robert C. Cooper explained that it often costs a lot to erect a Stargate on location, and so in some cases offworld gates are also entirely a visual effect.

<doc id="757134" wikidata="Q19588706" url="?curid=757134" title="President of Harvard University">
<text>The president of Harvard University is the chief administrator of Harvard University and the &quot;ex officio&quot; president of the Harvard Corporation. Each is appointed by and is responsible to the other members of that body, who delegate to the president the day-to-day running of the university.

Harvard&#x27;s current president is Alan Garber, who took office on January 2, 2024, following the resignation of Claudine Gay. In August 2024, the Harvard Corporation announced he would be in the position until mid- 2027.

== Role ==
The president plays an important part in university-wide planning and strategy. Each names a faculty&#x27;s dean (and, since the foundation of the office in 1994, the university&#x27;s provost), and grants tenure to recommended professors. However, the president is expected to make such decisions after extensive consultation with faculty members.

Recently, however, the job has become increasingly administrative, especially as fund-raising campaigns have taken on central importance in large institutions such as Harvard. Some have criticized this trend to the extent it has prevented the president from focusing on substantive issues in higher education.

Each president is professor in some department of the university and teaches from time to time.

The university maintains an official residence for the president&#x27;s use, which from 1912 until 1971, was President&#x27;s House, and since then has been Elmwood.

== Influence ==

Harvard presidents have traditionally influenced educational practices nationwide. Charles W. Eliot, for example, originated America&#x27;s familiar system of a smorgasbord of elective courses available to each student; James B. Conant worked to introduce standardized testing; Derek Bok and Neil L. Rudenstine argued for the continued importance of diversity in higher education.

==History==
At Harvard&#x27;s founding it was headed by a &quot;schoolmaster&quot;, Nathaniel Eaton. In 1640, when Henry Dunster was brought in, he adopted the title of president. Since Harvard was founded for the training of Puritan clergy, and even though its mission was soon broadened, nearly all presidents through the end of the 18th century were in holy orders.

All presidents from Leonard Hoar in 1672 through Nathan Pusey in 1971 were graduates of Harvard College. Of the presidents since Pusey, nearly all earned a graduate degree at Harvard. The only exception has been Drew Gilpin Faust, who was the first president since the seventeenth century with no earned Harvard degree.

<doc id="757138" wikidata="Q7305131" url="?curid=757138" title="Red Strings">
<text>The Red Strings, also known as the Heroes of America, were a group active primarily in the Southern United States during the American Civil War. They favored peace, an end to the Confederacy, and a restoration of the Union. They began early in the war as a group of Unionists and Quakers in the Piedmont regions of North Carolina and Virginia, where slavery was not as prevalent and the forces favoring secession were weakest.

== Origin ==
With civilian war weariness increasing in parts of the Confederacy during 1863, pro-Union activities began to become organized as a resistance. The Loyal Order of the Heroes of America was started by several men from North Carolina, possibly including Henderson Adams, later the first elected State Auditor. The group&#x27;s leader was John Pool, later a Republican Senator from North Carolina, who spent some time in jail in Richmond, and who traveled through western Virginia in 1864.

The group&#x27;s name, &quot;Red Strings&quot;, comes from their using red strings worn on their lapels or hung outside of their windows to identify themselves. This symbol comes from the Biblical story of the harlot Rahab, who had helped two spies of Israel escape from Jericho with a red cord, and was advised by them to hang a red thread on her window as a recognition symbol and to show her faith. &quot;..[T]hou shalt bind this line of scarlet in the window which thou didst let us down by... ...and she bound the scarlet line in the window... ...And Joshua saved Rahab the harlot alive, and her father&#x27;s household, and all that she had. And she dwellest in Israel even unto this day; because she hid the messengers that Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.&quot;

The organization was completely decentralized, and most knew only one other member for certain; most of their anti-Confederate activities were carried out in secret. Some estimate that by the war&#x27;s end, as many as 10,000 people belonged to the Red Strings. They were comparably as disruptive to the Southern war effort as the Copperheads were to the Union.

==Activities==
According to the &quot;Historial Times Encyclopedia of the Civil War&quot;:

The best developed of the peace societies, the Order of the Heroes of America, may have been organized as early as Dec. 1861, though by whom and where is uncertain. Active in North Carolina, southwestern Virginia, and eastern Tennessee, the Heroes protected deserters, aided spies and escaped prisoners, and supplied Federal authorities with information about Confederate troop movements and strength to bring about a Confederate defeat. Brig. Gen. John Echols, who investigated the order in Virginia when it was discovered there in 1864, believed it had been formed at the suggestion of Federal authorities. Union civilian and military officials cooperated with the order by assuring its members safe passage through the lines and by offering them exemption from military service if they deserted, protection for their property, and a share of confiscated Confederate estates after the war. In addition to their signs and passwords, the Heroes identified themselves by wearing a red string on their lapels and thus were nicknamed the Red Strings&quot; and the &#x27;Red-String Band.&#x27;&quot;

The Order of the Heroes of America extended into southwestern Virginia as well. Paint Bank, Virginia was known as a Union-Hole because of the pro-Union membership in these societies. One of the members of the Order was a Christiansburg, Virginia wheelwright named Williams. It is not known if this is the same man named Williams that residents of Back Valley, Virginia spoke about as a member of the Loyal League.

The Red Strings did not actively fight the Confederacy as guerillas, and many of their members may have been motivated by opposition to conscription as much as, or more than, by their belief in the Union. Some members joined as the result of mistreatment by Confederate officials or Home Guard units.

In addition to the organized opposition groups such as the Red Strings and Heroes of America, there were other groups that were closer to bandits. Known as &quot;Buffaloes,&quot; these men and some women were a mixture of Confederate deserters, draft-dodgers, pro-Union men, escaped slaves and other men escaping the noose such as arsonists, rapists and murderers. Living in small groups in the swamps of eastern North Carolina or the woods of the central and western parts of that state, they attacked isolated homes, often with impunity, since many of the men were away at war, and there was no protection from their lawlessness. 

The correspondents in the war records seem unaware that North Carolina, like all Gaul, was divided into three parts- the Confederate, the Yankee and the Buffalo. It was easier to let the Yankee garrison the strip of coast and keep him there than have the expense of it ourselves, but it is amusing to read of &quot;The Rebels Invading North Carolina&quot;.

The &quot;Red Strings&quot; were also interested in forming blacks into soldiers and having them fight for the Union as well. There are miscellaneous accounts of these black companies being formed during the war, as is mentioned in Elizabeth Lee Battle&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Forget-Me-Nots of the Civil War&quot;.

After the war, the Red Strings actively opposed the Ku Klux Klan.

==Red Strings Baseball Team==
The term &quot;Red Strings&quot; became popular among different groups after the war. Indeed, during the next generation, there was an exceptional baseball team formed in Yadkin County with the name, &quot;Red Strings.&quot; They only lost three games out of some sixty games that they played in their brief career. Many of the players were trained in Quaker schools, although they denied any relation to the &quot;Red Strings&quot; of the Civil War. According to Macon Rush Dunnagan:

How the name Red Strings originated is not known definitely. Members think Captain Gus Long, organizer and manager, gave the name… Elkin-ites didn&#x27;t like the name Red Strings- too much like night riding political group about this time, the Red Shirts, reminiscent of the earlier Ku Klux Klan. They preferred to call them the Longtown boys.

==Earlier red string conspiracy==
It is unknown if an earlier Southern conspiracy with a similar name, also organized by slaves and indentured servants, that took place in Georgia in the 18th century had any influence or association with the later Red Strings. In 1735 and 1736, a conspiracy among indentured servants was quashed in Savannah, Georgia and in South Carolina. The servants would be known &quot;by a red string tied around their right wrist&quot; and they would kill the white masters and escape to join Native Americans, escaped slaves and other runaway indentured servants.

<text>John Buckland Wright (1897–1954) was a British printmaker, painter and draughtsman. He worked principally as an etcher and engraver, and was self-taught. 

==Biography==
Buckland Wright was born on 3 December 1897 in Dunedin, New Zealand. He moved to England in 1908. Buckland Wright studied history at Oxford and then architecture in London. He soon realised that he wanted to be an artist more than an architect and by 1921 he was living in Belgium and was elected a member of the Gravure Originale Belge in 1925. He was also a member of Xylographes Belges, SWE and LG. During the 1930s, Buckland Wright lived and worked in Paris and frequently visited S W Hayter&#x27;s Atelier 17. He had one-man shows in London and throughout the continent, sometimes signing his work J B W. His work is held by the Victoria and Albert Museum, the British Museum, the National Gallery of Art, the Museum of Modern Art, and many galleries and museums in Europe and America. His work was also part of the painting event in the art competition at the 1948 Summer Olympics.

He mentored Turkish artist and engraver Aliye Berger in the late 1940s when she moved to London and began to study engraving.

A master printmaker with an assured, swirling line, Buckland Wright passed on his skills after World War II when he taught at Camberwell School of Arts and Crafts, from 1948, and the Slade School of Fine Art, from 1953, the year that his book &quot;Etching and Engraving: Techniques and the Modern Trend&quot; was published. He illustrated over 50 books.

Buckland Wright died on 27 September 1954. There was a retrospective of his work at Blond Fine Art, in 1981.

<text>Arthur Mastick Hyde (July 12, 1877October 17, 1947) was an American Republican politician, who served as the 35th governor of Missouri from 1921 to 1925, and as the United States secretary of agriculture for President Herbert Hoover from 1929 to 1933.

== Biography ==
Hyde was born on July 12, 1877, in Princeton, Missouri, the son of Caroline Emity Mastick and Ira B. Hyde. Several of Arthur&#x27;s family members were involved in politics; his father, Ira B. Hyde, was the U.S. representative from Missouri. His brother, Laurance M. Hyde, would become a Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Missouri. He graduated from the University of Michigan in 1899. While at the University of Michigan, he joined the Delta Upsilon fraternity. In 1900, he completed his law degree at the University of Iowa. Hyde began practicing law with his father in Princeton. In 1911, he opened a Buick dealership.

On October 19, 1904, Hyde married Hortense Clara Cullers. They had one daughter, Caroline C. Hyde. He was elected as mayor of Princeton in 1908. He served two terms, from 1908 to 1912. In 1912, Hyde unsuccessfully ran for Missouri Attorney General as a member of the Progressive Party. In 1915, he moved to Trenton, Missouri, and continued his work as a lawyer and automobile dealership owner. Hyde joined the Republican Party and spoke across Missouri for fund-raising campaigns.
Hyde was elected as Governor of Missouri in the 1920 election, and served one term from 1921 to 1925. During his first month as governor, Hyde recommended extensive reorganization of state government by regrouping responsibilities into a few departments. Although challenged by Democratic Party bosses, his administration made advances in public education, roads, state parks, conservation, law enforcement, and equitable taxes. Also during his time as governor, women were authorized to hold state office.

Following his term as governor, Hyde returned to law practice in Kansas City and Trenton. He then served as the secretary of agriculture under President Herbert Hoover from March 6, 1929, until March 4, 1933. During his tenure, farm prices declined, stock prices crashed, and the Great Depression began.

After his cabinet appointment, Hyde continued his work with the Methodist Church and the Republican Party. In 1935, he organized and spoke at the Conference of Methodist Laymen. He spoke for Republican candidates nationally and was the keynote speaker for the Missouri State Republican Convention in 1940.

Arthur Hyde died in New York City, after cancer surgery on October 17, 1947, at age 70. He is buried at the Odd Fellows Cemetery in Trenton, Missouri.

<text>Gamma Ray is a German power metal band from Hamburg, founded and fronted by Kai Hansen after his departure from power metal band Helloween, in 1989. He is the band&#x27;s lead vocalist, guitarist and chief songwriter. Between 1990 and 2014, Gamma Ray recorded eleven studio albums.

==Biography==
===Formation===
In 1988, after four years with the German power metal band Helloween, guitarist and songwriter Kai Hansen decided to leave the group. Hansen claimed that Helloween had become too big for him to handle, although the group&#x27;s troubles with financial issues and their record company, Noise Records, most likely played a part as well. He proceeded to do some studio work with German power metal band Blind Guardian and, in 1989, decided to form his own project with longtime friend Ralf Scheepers, former vocalist of the band Tyran Pace. This two-man project grew into a four-man band with the addition of Uwe Wessel on bass and Mathias Burchardt on drums. This was the first lineup of Gamma Ray, bearing a sound understandably close to that of Helloween of that period.

===The Scheepers era (1989–1995)===
The original lineup released the album &quot;Heading for Tomorrow&quot; in February 1990 and, later that year, the &quot;Heaven Can Wait&quot; EP, with new guitarist Dirk Schlächter and new drummer Uli Kusch.

In February 1991, the band began rehearsing for the recording of their second album in a small, remote house in Denmark. With some brand-new songs written, Gamma Ray entered the studio under the supervision of producer Tommy Newton and recorded their second album &quot;Sigh No More&quot;, which was released in September 1991. The style differed vastly from that of &quot;Heading for Tomorrow&quot;, featuring darker lyrics inspired by the Persian Gulf War that was raging at the time. A 50-date worldwide tour followed.

After the Japanese tour at the beginning of 1991, Gamma Ray underwent another personnel change: the rhythm section (Wessel and Kusch) left due to a personal disagreement and were replaced by Jan Rubach (bass) and Thomas Nack (drums), both from the Hamburg band Anesthesia. The band also began to build their own studio, so work on their new album did not start until 1993. The album &quot;Insanity and Genius&quot; was released in June 1993, with a style which was closer to that of &quot;Heading for Tomorrow&quot; than &quot;Sigh No More&quot;. In September 1993, Gamma Ray, along with Rage, Helicon and Conception, embarked on the Melodic Metal Strikes Back tour. The tour contributed to the release of the double CD &quot;Power of Metal&quot;, and the videos &quot;Power of Metal&quot; and &quot;Lust for Live&quot;, in December.

===&quot;Land of the Free&quot; to &quot;Majestic&quot; (1995–2006)===
More changes in the lineup followed for Gamma Ray. Vocalist Ralf Scheepers, who lived far away from the other band members hometown of Hamburg, attempted to become the new Judas Priest singer after Rob Halford left. He felt that his position in the band had been strained due to the distance between him and the other members. Hansen and Scheepers agreed to an amicable departure. After failing to be recruited for Judas Priest, Scheepers started his own band, Primal Fear.

Hansen spoke in an interview 1999 about why Scheepers left:There were two main reasons. One was after the first three Gamma Ray albums we said - now we want to do a really, really good album, something really killer. But Ralf was not living in Hamburg, he was living 700km away from here. For that reason he only came up for a while for rehearsal or for the recordings. But to do an album which was really good we needed him there constantly. In years before we had been talking about him moving to Hamburg but at that time he still had a job going on...he still does and he&#x27;s never going to leave it somehow. He could not really make up his mind to move to Hamburg and there was one problem with that because when we wrote the songs I was always trying to think of his voice but on the other hand it would have been a lot better if he write his own vocal lines, melodies and lyrics. When he came to Hamburg most of the times I was singing in the rehearsal room when he was not there and I was singing on my demos so it was like everything was more or less fixed and he could not really change it. We wanted that to change, therefore we wanted him to move to Hamburg, he could not make up his mind. Then we said either you do it or you die somehow you know...like putting the pistol to his chest. Well...on the other hand he had this Judas Priest thing going on. He wanted to be given a chance. I was the idiot who told him maybe for fun just try it out when it was clear they were searching for a singer because Judas Priest was always his favorite band. We were thinking about him doing the Gamma Ray album and then going to Judas Priest. All in all it led to the point where we said we&#x27;d rather split our ways at that point because it doesn&#x27;t make sense to go on like that. [&quot;sic&quot;] Hansen then began to search for a new vocalist but, due to demand from friends and fans, took on the guitar-vocal duties himself as he had done for Helloween&#x27;s first EP and album. In 1995, the fourth album, &quot;Land of the Free&quot;, the first to feature Hansen on vocals, was released. The album was praised by critics and fans alike. In a 2008 interview, Hansen spoke about the importance of the &quot;Land of the Free&quot; album and what it represented:We made it exactly at a time point when this kind of metal was proclaimed to be dead as can be. Where it was almost like if a drummer came up with a double bass drum people would say &#x27;ya dooga daga yourself out of here man.&#x27; Everything was ruled by Kurt Cobain and the alternative to the alternative and all that kind of stuff. So at that point we made an album like this and it went down very successful. That was cool, that was something special. I think it was the album that gave Gamma Ray the acceptance as being a band not only a Kai Hansen project. [&quot;sic&quot;] &quot;&quot; 
The tour following the album, Men on a Tour, brought the recording and release of the live album &quot;Alive &#x27;95&quot; in 1996. Soon after, there was yet another major lineup change. Jan Rubach and Thomas Nack both left in order to return to Anesthesia, with Gamma Ray recruiting new drummer Dan Zimmermann. Zimmerman is also known for being a founding member of the German power metal band Freedom Call. Schlächter, who was originally a bass player, as can be seen on the 1990 video &quot;Heading for the East&quot;, left the second guitar spot and took back his original bass guitar position, being replaced on guitar by Henjo Richter.

Work started on the next album, and 1997 saw the release of &quot;Somewhere Out in Space&quot;, which marked the beginning of the band&#x27;s thematic concentration on space. The album featured the hit &quot;Valley of the Kings&quot; and entered in the charts of many European countries. After two years of touring came the album &quot;Power Plant&quot;, which was a continuation of &quot;Somewhere Out in Space&quot;&#x27;s lyrical approach but featuring a new direction musically. The album was highly acclaimed throughout the world and gained even more chart success than its predecessor.

For Gamma Ray&#x27;s next work, Hansen decided to do things differently from the usual compilation of songs. He let the fans decide by voting on their website for their three favorite songs on each album, then the band went back to the studio to re-record the old tracks from the first three albums and made remixed versions for the songs from the later albums. &quot;Blast from the Past&quot; was the name chosen for this double remix album.

After a one-year break, when Hansen concentrated on his side project Iron Savior, the band was ready for the recording and release of the album &quot;No World Order&quot;, which was stylistically similar to NWOBHM bands such as Iron Maiden and Judas Priest. Again, the album was highly praised and the &quot;No Order World&quot; tour saw the band visiting dozens of European countries and Japan. After resting from the tour, the band went on with the &quot;Skeletons in the Closet&quot; tour, which saw the band performing songs that they never or rarely played live before. Once again, the setlist was voted by the fans on the band&#x27;s website. Only a few shows were played on this tour, but two of those were recorded for the live album &quot;Skeletons in the Closet&quot;.
Kai Hansen and Henjo Richter also participated in Tobias Sammet&#x27;s project Avantasia, on both The Metal Opera and The Metal Opera Part II, along with various other musicians including Hansen&#x27;s former bandmates from Helloween, Markus Grosskopf and Michael Kiske.

A live DVD, &quot;Hell Yeah!!! The Awesome Foursome (And the Finnish keyboarder who didn&#x27;t want to wear his Donald Duck costume: Live in Montreal)&quot; was recorded on 6 May 2006 at Le Medley in Montreal, Quebec. The setlist contained songs drawn from all of their albums up to &quot;Majestic&quot; (excluding &quot;Insanity and Genius&quot;) and also a cover of the Helloween hit &quot;I Want Out&quot;. The DVD was released more than two years later on 4 November 2008. It entered the German media control charts at No. 9 and the Swedish charts at No. 1, according to the band&#x27;s official website.

===&quot;Land of the Free II&quot; to &quot;Empire of the Undead&quot; (2007–2014)===
In recent years, Gamma Ray have made use of touring keyboard players to fully augment their sound in a live environment. Axel Mackenrott of Masterplan fulfilled these duties in the past and was followed by Eero Kaukomies, a Finn who also plays in a Gamma Ray tribute band named Guardians of Mankind. His bandmate, Kasperi Heikkinen, also played on part of the &quot;Majestic&quot; tour in 2006 following an injury to Henjo Richter. On their most recent &quot;To the Metal!&quot; tour, Kasperi Heikkinen replaced Henjo Richter once again for shows scheduled in Germany and Czech Republic in March 2010. Richter was hospitalized on 16 March 2010 due to retinal detachment. Heikkinen also shared stage with fellow axemen Hansen and Richter making &quot;a three-guitar special&quot; for the encore numbers at the Nosturi club in Helsinki, Finland, on 29 March 2010.

&quot;Land of the Free II&quot; was released in late 2007 as a sequel to the hugely successful &quot;Land of the Free&quot; album. To promote the album, Gamma Ray were the &quot;very special guest&quot; on Helloween&#x27;s Hellish Rock 2007/2008 World Tour, on some shows along with the band Axxis. For the final encores of the evening, Hansen and members of Gamma Ray joined Helloween to play a couple of songs from when he was in the latter band. Hansen would also regularly join Helloween co-founder Michael Weikath at center stage to the delight of fans of both bands.

&quot;To the Metal!&quot; was released as the tenth studio album by the band. It was released on 29 January 2010 to modest critical praise, but disappointed some fans, who felt that it was uninspired and a weaker effort than &quot;Land of the Free II&quot;.

On 31 May 2011, Gamma Ray released an EP entitled &quot;Skeletons and Majesties&quot;. It contains newly recorded, rarely played material (&quot;Skeletons&quot;) and acoustic versions of other older songs (&quot;Majesties&quot;).

Hansen stated in an interview in February 2012 that he expected the next Gamma Ray album to be released in January 2013. On 1 September 2012, the band announced Michael Ehré as their new drummer, replacing Daniel Zimmermann who chose to retire after 15 years of band activity.

Kai Hansen revealed, in an interview with &quot;Metal Blast&quot; in April 2013, that their eleventh album, &quot;Empire of the Undead&quot;, would have a &quot;more thrashy&quot; sound. In the same interview, Dirk Schlächter announced that the band would do a headlining tour following its release. &quot;Empire of the Undead&quot; was released in March 2014, despite Gamma Ray&#x27;s studio being completely destroyed by a fire.

===Additional vocalist and new album (2015–present)===
In October 2015, it was announced that Frank Beck would be a new lead vocalist of Gamma Ray, in addition to Hansen. This was due to Hansen&#x27;s degrading vocals due to lengthy tour schedules, as well as Hansen&#x27;s desire to have more freedom onstage.

On 10 August 2017, the band announced that they would be releasing a 25th-anniversary edition of &quot;Land of the Free&quot;.

In June 2021, on the Scars and Guitars podcast, Kai Hansen stated that, despite his reunion with Helloween, he is not letting Gamma Ray die, and that he is preparing material for a new album to be tentatively released in 2022.

In 2023, Gamma Ray released a newly remastered version of &quot;Blast from the Past&quot; in a limited 3-CD digipak (which includes the &quot;Skeletons &amp; Majesties&quot; EP), digitally, and on vinyl LP.

<text>Laurance Mastick Hyde (February 2, 1892 – 1978) was a chief justice of the Missouri Supreme Court. He was a Republican.

Hyde was born in Princeton, Missouri and served in the U.S. Army during World War I. He was the justice and then the chief justice of the Missouri Supreme Court.

In 1949, Hyde co-founded and became the first president of the Conference of Chief Justices, which he helped create along with the Council of State Governments and several private foundations at a meeting in St. Louis called by him, along with New Jersey Chief Justice Arthur T. Vanderbilt and Nebraska Chief Justice Robert G. Simmons.

Some of his family members were also involved in politics. His father, Ira B. Hyde, was a representative from Missouri, and his brother, Arthur M. Hyde, was a Governor of Missouri.

<text>USS &quot;Kentucky&quot; (SSBN-737) is a United States Navy ballistic missile submarine which has been in commission since 1991. She is the third U.S. Navy ship to be named for Kentucky, the 15th state.

==Construction and commissioning==
The contract to build &quot;Kentucky&quot; was awarded to the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics Corporation in Groton, Connecticut, on 13 August 1985 and her keel was laid down there on 18 December 1987. She was launched on 11 August 1990, sponsored by Carolyn Pennebaker Hopkins, who used a custom blend of Kentucky bourbon whiskey, mixed for the occasion, rather than the traditional bottle of champagne to christen &quot;Kentucky&quot;. She was commissioned on 13 July 1991, with Captain Michael G. Riegel commanding the Blue Crew and Captain Joseph Henry commanding the Gold Crew.

==Service history==

On 19 March 1998 south of Long Island, New York, &quot;Kentucky&quot; collided with the attack submarine . No personnel suffered any injuries. The two submarines were conducting a joint training drill prior to deployment. One of &quot;Kentucky&quot;″s stern planes was slightly damaged; &quot;San Juan&quot;″s forward ballast tank was breached, but &quot;San Juan&quot; was able to surface and return to port. &quot;Kentucky&quot; returned to patrol the next day.

In both 2001 and 2002, &quot;Kentucky&quot;″s Gold Crew won first place in the United States Atlantic Fleet in the Captain Edward F. Ney Memorial Award Submarine Afloat Galley competition for outstanding food service.

&quot;Kentucky&quot;″s Blue and Gold Crews were awarded the Omaha Trophy for service as the best ballistic missile submarine in 2009.

On 12 October 2011, &quot;Kentucky&quot; had only her periscope above water, when she turned onto a new course that was blocked by the Totem Ocean ship &quot;Midnight Sun.&quot; The submarine came into close contact of about 800 meters with the freighter near British Columbia in the Strait of Juan de Fuca.

In January 2012 USS &quot;Kentucky&quot; entered her Engineering Refueling Overhaul (ERO) at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard.

On 7 November 2015, an unarmed missile launched from &quot;Kentucky&quot; during a test caused buzz on social media as it was mistaken for a UFO or meteor. The launch was also widely reported by the Southern California broadcast media.

On 13 March 2016, following completion of her ERO, &quot;Kentucky&quot; deployed for the boat&#x27;s first strategic deterrent mission since 2011.

On July 18 2023, &quot;Kentucky&quot; made a port visit to the Busan Naval Base in South Korea, the first such visit in over forty years. Just days prior, USS &quot;Tennessee&quot; (SSBN-734) made a port visit to HMNB Clyde in Scotland. This was allegedly conducted as a show of force and to demonstrate the capabilities of the U.S. SSBN Fleet. During the visit, the President of South Korea Yoon Suk Yeol and First Lady Kim Keon-hee toured the submarine. U.S. General Paul LaCamera, commander of the ROK-U.S. Combined Forces Command, called the USS &quot;Kentucky&quot; a strategic American asset for extended deterrence, adding that the first visit by an American SSBN to Korea in over 40 years shows the &quot;ironclad U.S. commitment to defending the Republic of Korea.&quot;
