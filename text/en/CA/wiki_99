<text>The Grey Wolves (), officially known by the short name Idealist Hearths (, ), is a Turkish far-right political movement and the youth wing of the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP). Commonly described as ultranationalist, neo-fascist, Islamo-nationalist (sometimes secular), and racist, the Grey Wolves have been described by some scholars, journalists, and governments as a death squad and a terrorist organization. Its members deny its political nature and claim it to be a cultural and educational foundation, citing its full official name: Idealist Hearths Educational and Cultural Foundation ().

Established by Colonel Alparslan Türkeş in the late 1960s, the Grey Wolves rose to prominence during the late 1970s political violence in Turkey when its members engaged in urban guerrilla warfare with left-wing militants and activists. Scholars hold it responsible for most of the violence and killings in this period, including the Maraş massacre in December 1978, which killed over 100 Alevis. They are also alleged to have been behind the Taksim Square massacre in May 1977, and to have played a role in the Kurdish–Turkish conflict from 1978 onwards. The attempted assassination of Pope John Paul II in 1981 by Grey Wolves member Mehmet Ali Ağca was never formally linked to Grey Wolves leaders, and the organization&#x27;s role remains unclear.

The organization has long been a prominent suspect in investigations into the deep state in Turkey, and is suspected of having close dealings in the past with the Counter-Guerrilla, the Turkish branch of the NATO Operation Gladio, as well as the Turkish mafia. Among the Grey Wolves&#x27; prime targets are non-Turkish ethnic minorities such as Kurds, Greeks, and Armenians, and leftist activists.

A staunchly pan-Turkist organization, in the early 1990s the Grey Wolves extended their area of operation into the post-Soviet states with Turkic and Muslim populations. Up to thousands of its members fought in the First Nagorno-Karabakh War on the Azerbaijani side, and the First and Second Chechen–Russian Wars on the Chechen side. After an unsuccessful attempt to seize power in Azerbaijan in 1995, they were banned in that country. In 2005, Kazakhstan also banned the organization, classifying it as a terrorist group.

The organization is also active in Northern Cyprus, and has affiliated branches in Western European nations with a significant Turkish diaspora such as Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands. They are the largest right-wing extremist organization in Germany. The Grey Wolves were banned in France in November 2020 for hate speech and political violence, and calls for similar actions are made elsewhere. In May 2021, the European Parliament also called on member states of the European Union to designate it as a terrorist group.

While it was characterized as the MHP&#x27;s paramilitary or militant wing during the 1976-1980 political violence in Turkey, under Devlet Bahçeli, who assumed the leadership of the MHP and Grey Wolves after Türkeş&#x27;s death in 1997, the organization claims to have reformed. According to a 2021 poll, the Grey Wolves are supported by 3.2% of the Turkish electorate.

==Name and symbolism==
The organization&#x27;s members are known as &quot;Ülkücüler&quot;, which literally means &quot;idealists&quot;. Its informal name is inspired by the ancient legend of Asena, a she-wolf in the Ergenekon, a Tengrist ancient myth associated with Turkic ethnic origins in the Central Asian steppes. In Turkey, the wolf also symbolizes honour. The Grey Wolves have a &quot;strong emphasis on leadership and hierarchical, military-like organisation.&quot;

According to scholar Ahmet İnsel, the Grey wolves also use &quot;fascist slogans imported from America&quot;, such as &quot;Love it or leave it&quot; (&quot;Ya Sev Ya Terk Et!&quot;) and &quot;Communists to Moscow&quot; (&quot;Komünistler Moskova&#x27;ya&quot;).

===Grey Wolves Salute===
The salutation of the Grey Wolves is &quot;a fist with the little finger and index finger raised&quot; Turkic hand gesture, described by founder Alparslan Türkes, as: “The little finger symbolises the Turks, the index finger symbolises Islam, the ring – or snout – symbolises the world. The point where the remaining three fingers [sic.] join is a stamp. It means: we will put the Turkish-Islamic stamp on the world.&quot;

It was banned in Austria in February 2019. In Germany, the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and the Left Party proposed banning the salute in October 2018, calling it fascist.
In the 2024 European Football Cup, Turkish player Merih Demiral displayed the ‘wolf salute’ after scoring in Turkey’s round of 16 match against Austria. Nancy Faeser, Germany’s interior minister, condemned use of the gesture, saying: &quot;To use the football championships as a platform for racism is completely unacceptable,&quot; and the Turkish ambassador was summoned to explain. Demiral was banned for two games by UEFA for this reason, prompting protests denouncing the suspension by the Turkish Football Federation and Turkish government officials. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan changed plans to visit Azerbaijan to attend the following match after Demiral&#x27;s suspension to show his support. He had defended the player, saying that he merely expressed his “excitement” after scoring.

A large group of Turkish supporters making their way to the European Championship quarterfinal against the Netherlands made the same nationalistic hand gesture that got Demiral banned from the match, and were dispersed by the police. German authorities believe the group has around 12,100 members in the country. It is monitored by Germany’s federal domestic agency. The group has been banned in France, while Austria has banned the use of the Gray Wolf salute.

==Ideology==
The Grey Wolves adhere to an extreme form of Turkish nationalism. It has been characterized as an ultra-nationalist and neo-fascist paramilitary organization by political scholars, the mainstream media, and left-wing sources. R. W. Apple Jr., writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1981, described MHP and its satellite groups as a &quot;xenophobic, fanatically nationalist, neofascist network steeped in violence.&quot; The organization&#x27;s ideology emphasizes the early history of the Turkic peoples in Central Asia and blends it with Islamic culture and beliefs; their synthesis of Turkish identity, political ideology, and Islamic beliefs is referred to as &quot;Turkish Islamonationalism&quot;, and is widely prevalent in their rhetoric and activities. One of their mottos is: &quot;Your doctor will be a Turk and your medicine will be Islam.&quot; Other sources have described it as secular.

Their ideology is based on a &quot;superiority&quot; of the Turkish &quot;race&quot; and the Turkish nation. According to Peters, they strive for an &quot;ideal&quot; Turkish nation, which they define as &quot;Sunni-Islamic and mono-ethnic: only inhabited by &#x27;true&#x27; Turks.&quot; A Turk is defined as someone who lives in the Turkish territory, feels Turkish and calls themselves Turkish. In their ideology and activities, they are hostile to virtually all non-Turkish or non-Sunni elements within Turkey, including Kurds, Alevis, Arabs, Armenians, Greeks, Christians, and Jews. They embrace anti-Semitic conspiracy theories such as those put forward by &quot;The Protocols of the Elders of Zion&quot;, and have distributed the Turkish translation of Adolf Hitler&#x27;s &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;.

The Grey Wolves are Pan-Turkist and seek to unite the Turkic peoples in one state stretching from the Balkans to Central Asia. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the Grey Wolves called for &quot;a revived Turkish empire embracing newly independent Central Asian states of the former Soviet Union.&quot; They have proposed &quot;a pan-Turkish extension of the Turkish nation-state.&quot; Due to their pan-Turkic agenda they are hostile towards China, Iran, and Russia.

The Grey Wolves are staunchly anti-communist and have a history of violence toward leftists.

==Base==
According to sociologist , the Grey Wolves—&quot;the militant youth wing of the Turkish ethnic nationalists that are dissatisfied with the inertia of the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) camp&quot;—are supported by 3.6% of the Turkish electorate as of 2014. A 2021 poll by Kadir Has University found that a similar percentage, 3.2% of respondents identify as &quot;Ülkücü&quot;, or supporters of the Grey Wolves.

According to analyst Ankarali Jan, the Grey Wolves have a largely unofficial presence in Turkey&#x27;s major universities, but their &quot;real power is on the streets, among disaffected poor people in predominantly Turkish Sunni neighbourhoods.&quot; Norm Dixon wrote in the &quot;Green Left Weekly&quot; in 1999 that the MHP and Grey Wolves &quot;retain strong support within the military.&quot; In 2018, Tom Stevenson described it as a &quot;street movement.&quot;

==Links to the Turkish government and NATO==
In the late 1970s, former military prosecutor and Turkish Supreme Court Justice Emin Değer documented collaboration between the Grey Wolves, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), and Counter-Guerrilla, the Turkish stay-behind anti-communist organization organized under NATO&#x27;s Operation Gladio, a plan for guerrilla warfare in case of a communist takeover. Martin Lee writes that the Counter-Guerrilla supplied weapons to the Grey Wolves, while according to Tim Jacoby, the CIA transferred guns and explosives to Grey Wolves units through an agent in the 1970s.

During the 1996 Susurluk scandal, the Grey Wolves were accused of being members of the Counter-Guerrilla. Abdullah Çatlı, second-in-command of the Grey Wolves leadership, was killed during the Susurluk car crash, which sparked the scandal. The April 1997 report of the Turkish National Assembly&#x27;s investigative committee &quot;offered considerable evidence of close ties between state authorities and criminal gangs, including the use of the Grey Wolves to carry out illegal activities.&quot;

In 2008 the Ergenekon trials, a court document revealed that the National Intelligence Organization (MİT) armed and funded Grey Wolves members to carry out political murders. They mostly targeted members of the Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia (ASALA), which attacked Turkish embassies abroad in retaliation for the Turkish state&#x27;s continued denial of the Armenian genocide. The Turkish intelligence services also made use of the Grey Wolves in the Kurdish–Turkish conflict, by offering them amnesty for their crimes in exchange.

In 2018, the AK Party formed an alliance with the MHP which succeeded in re-electing President Erdoğan. In 2022, concerns around the close connections between the Turkish government and the Grey Wolves caused the Foreign Affairs Committee of the European Parliament to recommend that the Grey Wolves be banned in the European Union.

==History==
According to Ruben Safrastyan, because the Grey Wolves are subtle and often formally operate as cultural and sports organizations, information about them is scarce.

===Early history===
The Grey Wolves organization was formed by Colonel Alparslan Türkeş in the late 1960s as the paramilitary wing of the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP). In 1968, over a hundred camps for ideological and paramilitary training were founded by Türkeş across Turkey. Canefe and Bora describe it as a grassroots fascist network, which had an active role in the economy, education, and neighbourhoods. Nasuh Uslu characterized it as a well-disciplined paramilitary organization, while Joshua D. Hendrick compared its organization to the Nazi &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot; (SS). Young male students and economic migrants from rural areas who have settled in Istanbul and Ankara made up the majority of its members. In 1973 Israeli orientalist Jacob M. Landau wrote that the importance of the Grey Wolves &quot;is attested to by the fact that Türkeş himself assumed responsibility for the formation of these youth groups and assigned the supervision of their training to two of his close associates&quot;.

===1970s violence and 1980 coup===
By the late 1970s the organizations had tens of thousands of members, and according to Amberin Zaman, the Turkish authorities had lost control over it. During the political violence between 1976 and 1980, members of the Grey Wolves were involved in numerous assassinations of left-wing and liberal activists, intellectuals, labour organizers, Kurds, officials, and journalists. The organization became a death squad engaged in &quot;street killings and gunbattles&quot;. According to authorities, 220 of its members carried out 694 murders of left-wing and liberal activists and intellectuals. In total, some 5,000 to 6,000 people were killed in the violence, with the Grey Wolves responsible for most of the killings.

Their most significant attack of this period was the Maraş massacre in December 1978, when over 100 Alevis were killed. They are also accused of being behind the Taksim Square massacre on 1 May 1977. The Grey Wolves became a &quot;state-approved force&quot; and used attacks on left-wing groups to &quot;cause chaos and demoralization and inflame a climate in which a regime promising law and order would be welcomed by the masses.&quot;
During this violent period, Grey Wolves operated with the encouragement and the protection of the Turkish Army&#x27;s Special Warfare Department.

The conflict between left-wing and right-wing groups eventually resulted in a military intervention in September 1980 when General Kenan Evren led a coup d&#x27;état. According to Daniele Ganser, at the time of the coup, there were some 1,700 Grey Wolves branches, with about 200,000 registered members and a million sympathizers. Following the 1980 coup, the Grey Wolves and MHP were banned and their activity was diminished. Turkish nationalists and others assert that the Grey Wolves were &quot;used and then discarded&quot; by the deep state in Turkey.

===Post-1980===
After the 1980 coup, the Grey Wolves reorganized. They began to direct their efforts against Kurds in Turkey, as well as lobbying for aggressive denial of the Armenian genocide and support of the Turkish occupation of Cyprus.

====Anti-Kurdish violence and activism====
=====1990s=====
In the 1990s, the Grey Wolves turned their focus on the Kurds and participated in the Kurdish–Turkish conflict in Turkish Kurdistan. In 1999, &quot;Hürriyet Daily News&quot; described the organization as &quot;the staunchest opponent to the Kurdish cause in Turkey.&quot;

In May 1998, the Grey Wolves were involved in two murders. On 3 May, a group of Grey Wolves attacked two students in Bolu who were passing by the organization&#x27;s building. Kenan Mak, one of the students, was killed. On 5 May, a worker named Bilal Vural was killed in Istanbul&#x27;s Şişli district, allegedly by the Grey Wolves. His family claimed that he was &quot;brought several times to the Ülkü Ocakları building where ultranationalists forced him to become a member.&quot; They said that he was killed because he was a member of the pro-Kurdish People&#x27;s Democracy Party (HADEP). As a result of these murders, Republican People&#x27;s Party (CHP) Deputy Chairman Sinan Yerlikaya and the Freedom and Solidarity Party (ÖDP) requested that the Grey Wolves be banned by the authorities.

During the 1999 general election, the Grey Wolves attacked members of the HADEP, allegedly with impunity.

=====2000s=====
In August 2002, the Grey Wolves burnt Masoud Barzani&#x27;s effigy in a protest in Ankara after he claimed the partly Turkmen-inhabited Iraqi governorates of Kirkuk and Mosul as part of Iraqi Kurdistan.

=====2010s=====
On 9 November 2010, Hasan Şimşek, a Grey Wolves member and a student, was killed at the Kütahya Dumlupınar University during an apparent fight between Kurdish nationalist and Turkish nationalist student groups. At his funeral, MHP leader Bahçeli stated that &quot;We expect every kind of measure to be taken to prevent the expansion of the PKK mob, who have a tendency to grow in the universities.&quot; Violence between Turkish and Kurdish students also broke out in Marmara University in Istanbul on 12 November.

In September 2011, the Ankara Police Department raided 40 locations across Ankara belonging to the Grey Wolves. They took 36 people into custody and seized numerous guns and knives. According to police, the Grey Wolves were planning an attack on the pro-Kurdish Democratic Regions Party (BDP).

In October 2013, the Grey Wolves demonstrated across Turkey against the Kurdish–Turkish peace process.

In October 2014, the Grey Wolves were involved in deadly clashes during the 2014 Kurdish riots in Turkey against the government&#x27;s perceived collaboration with the Islamic State during the Siege of Kobanî. A group of Grey Wolves in Sancaktepe, Istanbul, attempted to lynch a young man.

On 20 February 2015, Fırat Yılmaz Çakıroğlu, leader of the Grey Wolves organization in Ege University, was stabbed to death by left-wing and according to some reports, Kurdish nationalist students.

On 7–8 September 2015, Turkish nationalists, including Grey Wolves members, attacked 128 offices of the pro-Kurdish Peoples&#x27; Democratic Party (HDP) across Turkey in an apparent retaliation for anti-government attacks by the Kurdistan Workers&#x27; Party (PKK). Some have alleged that some of the attacks were carried out by AK Party members &quot;masquerading as Grey Wolves&quot; or that the Grey Wolves cooperated with AK Party members in attacks on HDP offices and left-wingers suspected of sympathy for the Kurds.

====Greece-related violence and activism====
On 18 June 1988 Kartal Demirağ, a senior member of the Grey Wolves, attempted to assassinate Prime Minister Turgut Özal&#x27;s at the Motherland Party congress. Özal linked it to his visit to Greece three days earlier, saying that the attempt was carried out &quot;by a group opposed to his efforts to improve relations with Greece.&quot;

On 6 September 2005, a group of nationalists, led by Grey Wolves leader Levent Temiz, stormed into an Istanbul exhibition commemorating the anti-Greek pogrom of 1955. They threw eggs and tore down photos. The Grey Wolves issued a statement denying involvement.

In the 2000s the Grey Wolves routinely demonstrated outside the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople in Fener (Phanar), Istanbul and burn the Patriarch in effigy. In October 2005 they staged a rally and proceeding to the gate they laid a black wreath, chanting &quot;Patriarch Leave&quot; and &quot;Patriarchate to Greece&quot;, inaugurating the campaign for the collection of signatures to oust the Ecumenical Patriarchate from Istanbul. As of 2006 the Grey Wolves claimed to have collected more than 5 million signatures for the withdrawal of the Patriarch and called on the Turkish government to have the patriarch deported to Greece.

In December 2017 Grey Wolves members, among them the BBP-affiliated Alperen Ocakları, invaded the Hagia Sophia and prayed there in protest against the United States recognition of Jerusalem as capital of Israel.

====Anti-Armenian violence and activism====
In January 2004, the Grey Wolves prevented the screening of &quot;Ararat&quot;, a film about the Armenian genocide, in Turkey.

On 24 April 2011, the murder of Sevag Balıkçı, a soldier of Armenian descent in the Turkish Army, was committed by Kıvanç Ağaoglu, who sympathized with Abdullah Çatlı, the late leader of the Grey Wolves. According to Ruben Melkonyan, an Armenian expert on Turkish studies, Ağaoglu was a member of the Grey Wolves.

On 24 April 2012, the Armenian Genocide Remembrance Day, nationalist groups, including the Grey Wolves, protested against the commemoration of the genocide in Istanbul&#x27;s Taksim Square.

In June 2015, during a visit to the medieval Armenian city of Ani in Kars Province by the Armenian pianist Tigran Hamasyan, the local leader of the Grey Wolves suggested that his followers should &quot;go on an Armenian hunt.&quot;

==== Other acts of violence ====
According to Zürcher and Linden, when Sunni radicals attacked Alevis in Istanbul in March 1995, the police in the Gazi quarter were &quot;heavily infiltrated by Grey Wolves&quot; and it was not until the police were replaced by military units that peace was restored.

In December 1996, the Grey Wolves attacked left-wing students and teachers at Istanbul University, with the alleged approval of the police.

In late November 2006 the Grey Wolves staged protests against Pope Benedict XVI&#x27;s visit to Turkey. On 22 November, tens of protesters symbolically occupied Haghia Sophia in Istanbul to perform Muslim prayers. They chanted slogans against the Pope, such as &quot;Don&#x27;t make a mistake Pope, don&#x27;t try our patience&quot;. Reuters reported that the event was organized by &quot;Alperen Ocakları&quot;, considered an offshoot of the Grey Wolves. Police arrested around 40 protesters for violating the ban on prayers in the former mosque, which had been a museum since the 1930s.

In July 2014 around a thousand people demonstrated in Kahramanmaraş against the presence of Syrian refugees who fled the Syrian Civil War. Many protesters made the sign of the Grey Wolves, blocked roads in the city and removed Arabic-language signs from stores. AKP lawyer Mahir Ünal commented: &quot;This doesn&#x27;t make them idealists [i.e. members of the Grey Wolves] but it is certain some people&#x27;s attempt to show it like something the idealists did.&quot;

In July 2015 the Grey Wolves staged protests across Turkey, burnt flags of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, attacked Chinese restaurants and &quot;tourists who were mistaken for being Chinese&quot; in response to the Chinese government&#x27;s ban on Muslim Turkic Uyghurs fast during the holy month of Ramadan. Korean tourists were attacked by Grey Wolves. An Uighur worked at the Turkish run Chinese restaurant which was assaulted. Members of the Grey Wolves displayed a banner in multiple locations that read, &quot;We crave Chinese blood.&quot; Grey Wolves members attacked the Thai consulate in Istanbul in apparent retaliation for the deportation of hundreds of Uyghurs by Thailand. MHP chairman Devlet Bahçeli stated that &quot;Our nationalist youth is sensitive to injustices in China&quot;, and that the attacks by MHP-affiliated youth on South Korean tourists was &quot;understandable&quot;, adding &quot;What feature differentiates a Korean from a Chinese? They see that they both have slanted eyes. How can they tell the difference?&quot;

In November 2015, the Grey Wolves protested Russian involvement in the Syrian Civil War near Istanbul&#x27;s Russian consulate, Ankara, and Adana, accusing Russia of slaughtering Syrian Turkmens.

==Presence in Eurasia==
===Azerbaijan===
During the First Nagorno-Karabakh War (1988–94), Grey Wolves members fought on the Azerbaijani side against Armenians, but many reportedly returned to Turkey in late 1992. Around 200 members of the Grey Wolves were still in the conflict zone in September 1994 to train Azerbaijani units.

In 1993, Azerbaijani Interior Minister Isgandar Hamidov established the National Democratic Party, which was known as Boz Qurd (&quot;Grey Wolves&quot;). According to Russian political scientist Stanislav Cherniavsky, the Azerbaijani Grey Wolves grew out of the nationalist Popular Front in 1992 and &quot;considered itself a branch of the Turkish Grey Wolves.&quot; It was registered by the Justice Ministry in 1994. In interviews in 1992–93, Hamidov said there was no organisational link with the Turkish organization, stating that the &quot;Grey Wolves of Azerbaijan are not subordinate to the Turkish group&quot;.

In March 1995, a coup d&#x27;état attempt against President Heydar Aliyev was staged in Baku by paramilitary police chief Rovshan Javadov, Turkish far-right organizations (including the Grey Wolves), and the Azerbaijani opposition. According to Thomas de Waal, the &quot;shadowy backers of this uprising were never identified but appear to have included rogue elements of the Turkish security establishment and members of the &#x27;Gray Wolves&#x27; Bozkurt movement.&quot; After the coup attempt, Hamidov was jailed, while the Azerbaijani Supreme Court formally abolished the National Democratic Party due to its links to the Turkish Grey Wolves, which it considered to be a terrorist organization. In 2004, Hamidov was freed in an amnesty granted by President Ilham Aliyev. In 2008, Hamidov retired from politics and as president of the party, which had been inactive since. After 2007, the Grey Wolves reportedly used to not operate in Azerbaijan for some time. In the blockades of the Lachin corridor of December 2022 the presence of Grey Wolves was made apparent by their repeated salutations.

===China (Xinjiang)===
The Grey Wolves &quot;set up training camps in Central Asia for youths from Turkic language groups&quot; following the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Failing to find support in post-Soviet Central Asian republics, they targeted the Uyghurs, concentrated in the Chinese province of Xinjiang and began actively supporting the East Turkestan independence movement. In this scope, the Grey Wolves&#x27; European affiliates attacked Chinese tourists in the Netherlands. The Institute of Peace and Conflict Studies suggested in 2012 they are &quot;highly limited in their reach and support base&quot;. In March 2020, several Chinese state-run outlets published an article, which claimed that the World Uyghur Congress (WUC) and &quot;its offshoots have forged ties with the Grey Wolves&quot; and that WUC founder Erkin Alptekin met Türkeş on numerous occasions.

===Cyprus===
Following the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974 the Grey Wolves &quot;continued to play a role in radicalizing the dispute with Greek Cypriots by actively engaging in violence on the island.&quot; They actively supported Rauf Denktaş, the President of the unrecognized Northern Cyprus between 1983 and 2005, and were involved, according to Harry Anastasiou, in state-sponsored terror of citizens. In July 1996, Kutlu Adali, a Turkish Cypriot journalist who had criticized Denktaş and his policies, was killed by the Grey Wolves, according to some sources.

In August 1996, the Grey Wolves were involved in an attack on a protest of Greek Cypriots against the Turkish occupation of Northern Cyprus. Tassos Isaac, a Cypriot protester, was beaten to death by the Grey Wolves in the United Nations Buffer Zone.

In July 1997 the Grey Wolves clashed in Northern Cyprus with Kurdish university students who protested against Turkey&#x27;s invasion of northern Iraq in search of the PKK.

On 17 October 2003, Murat Kanatlı, Turkish Cypriot journalist and editor of the opposition newspaper &quot;Yeniçağ&quot;, was &quot;attacked by a group of 20-30 persons belonging to the Grey Wolves&quot; according to the International Press Institute (IPI). Kanatlı had covered the Grey Wolves&#x27; demonstration against the &quot;intervention&quot; of the European Union and the United States in elections in Northern Cyprus.

During the 2004 referendum on the Annan Plan, the Grey Wolves campaigned for a &#x27;no&#x27; vote. During the pre-voting period at least 50 Grey Wolves activists arrived in Northern Cyprus and caused riots against pro-ratification supporters. They were suspected of assaulting motorcyclists carrying &#x27;vote yes&#x27; banners.

In October 2013 that the Grey Wolves opened a new headquarters in North Nicosia&#x27;s Köşklüçiftlik quarter. During the opening ceremony Adem Yurdagül, the chairman of the Grey Wolves in Cyprus delivered a speech, while slogans like &quot;Nicosia plain is home of Grey Wolves&quot;, &quot;Cyprus is Turkish and will remain Turkish&quot;, &quot;We are soldiers of [Alparslan] Türkeş&quot;, &quot;The Grey Wolves Movement cannot be prevented&quot; were chanted.

In November 2013 a fight broke out between members of the Grey Wolves and Kurdish students at the Near East University in North Nicosia resulting in arrest of 23 persons. According to the newspaper &quot;Havadis&quot;, &quot;the cause of the fight was allegations by the Grey wolves&#x27; organization that some Kurdish students broke the windows of the Grey wolves organization’s building. Around 500 students went out on the streets holding clubs and rocks and the police asked for reinforcement in order to put them under control.&quot;

===Russia===
In November and December 2015, Federation Council member Andrey Klishas and two Communist Party members of the State Duma proposed outlawing the Grey Wolves in Russia. In August 2020, the Russian International Affairs Council, a government think tank, classified the Grey Wolves as an extremist organization.

;Chechnya
Members of the Grey Wolves fought on the Chechen separatist side during the First Chechen War (1994–96) and the Second Chechen War (1999–2000). CNN reported in 2000 that the Grey Wolves with most pro-Chechen stance were those affiliated with the Islamist Great Union Party (BBP), which had split from MHP in 1993. The article suggested that they &quot;run the mosques and commercial activities in some parts of Istanbul. It is in these mosques, in the suburbs of the city, that offerings are collected after daily prayers for the Chechen refugees. It is money that probably also goes to soldiers on the front lines.&quot; According to Svante Cornell it is &quot;widely believed that the Grey Wolves organised arms shipments to Chechnya, probably with at least the partial knowledge of the Turkish authorities.&quot; Russian media has alleged that the Turkish government knew and possibly supported, or at least did not prevent, the activities of the Grey Wolves in Chechnya. Georgian Minister of State Security Valery Khaburdania stated in 2002 that the Grey Wolves were the &quot;conduit of assistance&quot; to the Chechen militants.

Azerbaijani Grey Wolves also participated in the fight against Russia. In January 1995 &quot;Kommersant&quot; cited the Federal Counterintelligence Service (FSK) in stating that the Azerbaijani Grey Wolves sent 80 fighters to Chechnya. Another 270 fighters went to Chechnya in December of that year.

;Crimea
According to a December 2015 report by the independent Russian online newspaper &quot;Svobodnaya Pressa&quot;, Crimean Tatar nationalists have apparently began cooperating with the Grey Wolves.

===Syria===
Activists of the MHP and Idealist Hearths have fought in the Syrian civil war, in support of the Syrian Turkmen, whom they consider kinsmen. The MHP and Grey Wolves have provided the Syrian Turkmen Assembly with relief aid and fighters. Syrian Turkmen Assembly president Abdurrahman Mustafa stated in 2016 that &quot;Turkish NGOs, just as the Grey Wolves, give us humanitarian aid.&quot; According to &quot;Egypt Today&quot; the National Intelligence Organization of Turkey (MİT) &quot;is believed to be recruiting retired military personnel to provide support for armed groups operating in Syria, through the Grey Wolves Brigades.&quot;

Some Syrian rebel groups have ties to Grey Wolves. One is the Muntasir Billah Brigade. Another is the Turkmen Abdulhamid Han Brigade.

On 24 November 2015, the Turkish Air Force shot down a Russian Sukhoi Su-24M bomber aircraft near the Syria–Turkey border. The pilot was shot in mid-air parachuting toward land by Syrian Turkmen rebels under Syrian Turkmen Brigades. The Turkmen rebel group operated under the command of Alparslan Çelik, a Turkish national and a Grey Wolves member from Elazığ.

&quot;Youm7&quot;, an Egyptian news site picked up a document allegedly issued by the Army of Conquest (&quot;Jaish al-Fatah&quot;), which claimed that it conspired with the Turkistan Islamic Party and the Grey Wolves in the December 2016 assassination of Andrei Karlov, the Russian ambassador to Turkey. Russian-state run news TASS agency cited this in a news report.

===Thailand===
The 2015 Bangkok bombing is suspected to have been carried out by the Grey Wolves due to Thailand&#x27;s deportation of Uyghur terrorist suspects back to China instead of allowing them to travel to Turkey for asylum. A man with fake Turkish passports using the name Adem Karadag was arrested by the Thai police in connection to the bombing and bomb making materials found in his apartment.

==Presence in Western Europe==
=== Austria ===
In Austria, the Grey Wolves salute as well as its symbols were legally banned starting from 1 March 2019. It is punishable by fines up to €4,000. Turkey&#x27;s Foreign Ministry condemned the ban. &quot;[T]he &#x27;bozkurt&#x27; (&#x27;Grey Wolves&#x27;) sign, which is a symbol of a legal political party in Turkey and the &#x27;rabia&#x27; sign that is widely used by Muslims in many countries as well as in Turkey. We do not accept this and we strongly condemn it,&quot; read the Foreign Ministry statement. Turkey also called on Austria to &quot;correct this grave mistake,&quot; because it &quot;deeply offends Turkey, the Turkish community in Austria and Muslims.&quot; In early March 2019, Grey Wolves sympathizers started a campaign on Twitter by sending Chancellor Sebastian Kurz hundreds of photos of people showing the salute. Kurz defended the ban declaring people and organizations that do not accept democratic values, or fight against those values, have no place in Austria.

In January 2020 four Turkish bus drivers were fired in Vienna for making the Grey Wolves sign. On 26 June 2020, Turkish nationalist groups, identified by journalist Jake Hanrahan as Grey Wolves members, attacked Kurdish rallies in Vienna protesting the Turkish operation in Iraqi Kurdistan. Turkey criticized the handling of the violence by the Austrian police and claimed that it was organized by PKK sympathizers.

===Belgium===
The &quot;Belçika Türk Federasyonu&quot; (BTF) is considered to be &quot;affiliated with or sympathetic&quot; to the Grey Wolves. According to one study, its aim is &quot;to foster loyalty among young people of Turkish origin to their ancestral culture, religion and history and to keep alive the Turkish identity in Europe. BTF claims to oppose not the integration of Belgian-Turks into their host society but rather their assimilation by it.&quot; Its activities mostly focus on &quot;issues relevant to Turkish national sensitivities&quot;. For instance, it has demonstrated against the erection of an Armenian Genocide memorial in Brussels. During the municipal elections of 2006 two member of the BTF came to the attention of the media: Fuat Korkmazer on the Flemish Christian Democrats (CD&amp;V) list in Ghent and Murat Denizli on the Francophone Socialist Party (PS) list in Schaerbeek, a municipality in the Brussels Region. Korkmazer got a very low number of votes, while Denizli was elected but had to resign because it was discovered he had a false address and lived in another municipality. In 2019, sp.a candidate Mustafa Ayutar was linked to the organization. In 2019, Belgian-Kurdish New Flemish Alliance politician Zuhal Demir reported that posters advertising her candidacy in Maasmechelen had been vandalized with swastikas and the symbol of the Grey Wolves.

In 2022, Grey Wolves vandalized an Armenian genocide memorial in Brussels with three crescents, similar to the MHP logo.

===France===
In May 1984, Grey Wolves leader Abdullah Çatlı carried out a bombing of an Armenian Genocide memorial in Alfortville, a Paris suburb.

According to Direction générale de la sécurité intérieure members of the Grey Wolves partook in a 21 January 2012 demonstration in Paris against the adoption of the bill criminalizing the Armenian genocide denial in France.

In November 2020, France banned the Grey Wolves organization after defacement of an Armenian Genocide Memorial, organizing combat training camps in the Ardèche region in 2019, inciting violence against Kurds and Armenians and orchestrating marches targeting Armenians near Lyon. Turkey&#x27;s Foreign Ministry criticized the ban and said: &quot;we will reciprocate to this decision in the strongest way.&quot; In addition, accused the French government of tolerating associations affiliated with the PKK and the FETÖ.

===Germany===
As a far-right extremist group, the Grey Wolves are monitored by the German authorities. The Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution assumes that there are around 12,100 people in Germany who can be assigned to the “Ülkücü” movement and its ideology as of 2023. The majority of these - around 10,500 supporters - are organized in clubs, which in turn are grouped together under the umbrella of larger associations. A 2017 article published by the Federal Agency for Civic Education estimated over 18,000 members. 

The three “Ülkücü” associations in Germany with the largest number of members are: 

* “Federation of Turkish Democratic Idealist Associations in Germany e.V.” (ADÜTDF), with around 7,000 members organized in around 200 local associations.
* “ATİB – Union of Turkish-Islamic Cultural Associations in Europe e.V.” (ATİB), with around 2,500 members in 25 associations.
* &quot;Federation of the World Order in Europe” (ANF), with around 1,000 members in around 15 local associations.

The group transfers conflicts from their native Turkey into Germany with harassment against Kurds and Armenians as well as people with leftist political views in general. Its members have actively engaged in attacks on and clashes with Kurds in Germany.

Historicly the most important Grey Wolves-affiliated Turkish organization in Germany was the &quot;Türk Federasyon&quot; (Avrupa Demokratik Ülkücü Türk Dernekleri Federasyonu, ADÜTDF), which had around 200 member organizations. Founded in 1978 by 64 nationalist organizations it declined in the 1980s, but revived in the 1990s and claimed to have doubled its membership following the Solingen arson attack of 1993. It denies any direct links with the Grey Wolves in Turkey or the MHP, however, its monthly journal publishes articles praising the MHP and denouncing left-wing and Kurdish organizations in Turkey and Germany. According to educationalist Kemal Bozay, their influence on third generation Turkish youth—who are &quot;looking for an identity&quot;—has &quot;increased significantly&quot;. They had ties to the banned Turkish-nationalistic outlaw motorcycle club Osmanen Germania BC.

According to the Baden-Württemberg State Government, there are 45 Grey Wolves clubs and associations in that state as of 2012. These associations are often given non-political names (usually cultural and athletic) to conceal their identity.

The 2013 in three German federal states &quot;two live arms with ammunition, blank-firing guns, batons, electric stun guns and Samurai swords&quot; were seized from members of the Grey Wolves.

The Ministry of the Interior of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany&#x27;s most populous state where 70 Grey Wolves associations with more than 2,000 members operated in 2011, also monitors the organization. Nevertheless, , a Social Democratic Party member of the state&#x27;s parliament, stated in a 2011 interview that the threat of the Grey Wolves in Germany is underestimated. He said, &quot;When thousands of Turkish right-wing radicals come together in Essen, we&#x27;re not worried. But if 100 members of NPD march, we immediately organize a counter-demonstration.&quot; Olaf Lehne, a Christian Democratic Union member of North Rhine-Westphalia&#x27;s state parliament, stated in an interview that the Grey Wolves &quot;are in this country, unfortunately, too often ignored&quot;. He also added that they have a large number of sympathizers among young people. Another important organization affiliated with the Grey Wolves are the ATIB (Turkish: &quot;Avrupa Türk-İslam Birliği, ATİB&quot;; German: &quot;Union der Türkisch-Islamischen Kulturvereine in Europa&quot;).

During the UEFA Euro 2024 football tournament held in Germany, several Turkish supporters were observed giving the &quot;wolf salute,&quot; a hand gesture associated with the Grey Wolves. This gesture, symbolic of Turkish ultra-nationalism and far-right ideologies, raised concerns among European authorities and football officials.

The incident occurred during the group stage match between Turkey and Italy, held in Munich on June 20, 2024. The &quot;wolf salute&quot; was prominently displayed by a section of Turkish fans, leading to immediate condemnation from various quarters. UEFA officials noted the salute and initiated an investigation to address the display of political and extremist symbols during the tournament.

UEFA issued a statement reaffirming its commitment to keeping political and extremist expressions out of football. The German Football Association (DFB) also expressed its concern and emphasized the need for vigilance against far-right activities in sports events. 

Turkey&#x27;s Merih Demiral was subsequently banned &quot;for violating the basic rules of decent conduct, for using sports events for manifestations of a non-sporting nature and for bringing the sport of football into disrepute&quot;, for allegedly making a &quot;wolf salute&quot; during Turkey&#x27;s round of 16 win over Austria. 

From 2014-2018 the Osmanen Germania were a extreme right criminal gang working as security guards for the gray wolves.

===Netherlands===
As early as 1979 the Dutch Scientific Council for Government Policy reported that clashes between the Grey Wolves and the Dutch-Turkish Workers Association (HTIB) occurred on May Day celebrations. Organizations such as Turkish Federation Netherlands (&quot;Turkse Federatie Nederland&quot;, TFN) and Turkish Islamic Federation (&quot;Turks Islamitische Federatie&quot;) have links to the Grey Wolves. According to Wangmo and Yazilitas, the Grey Wolves in the Netherlands have engaged in a variety of activities, ranging from criminal activities and nationalist propaganda to support of football teams. The organization was more influential in the 1990s when many first-generation Turkish immigrants &quot;maintained a deep interest in Turkish politics and who had a deeply felt Turkish identity.&quot; Grey Wolves activists have participated—with varying successes—in the local politics of several Dutch municipalities. In November 2020, VVD MP Bente Becker introduced a motion to ban the Grey Wolves. The motion was supported by 147 members of the parliament with 3 members voting against it. All three votes against the motion came from Denk.

===Sweden===
On 13 September 2015, an explosion occurred at a Kurdish civil center in Stockholm, Sweden, following clashes between Turks, Kurds and anti-fascists at a rally organized by the Swedish Grey Wolves.

The Swedish Green Party was hit by a political scandal in April 2016, as images emerged of party member and Housing Minister Mehmet Kaplan attending a dinner party alongside leading members of the Grey Wolves. Kaplan resigned when a 2009 video was made public in which he compared Israel&#x27;s treatment of Palestinians to that of Jews by Nazi Germany. The Sweden Democrats party have called for the Grey Wolves to be banned in Europe and for its members in Sweden to be deported.

===Vatican===
On 13 May 1981 Mehmet Ali Ağca, an alleged Grey Wolves member, attempted to murder Pope John Paul II in St. Peter&#x27;s Square. The masterminds were not identified and the organization&#x27;s role remains unclear. According to Daniel Pipes and Khalid Duran Grey Wolves appear to have been involved in the assassination attempt and write that Ağca &quot;in his own confused way mixed Turkish nationalist sentiments with fundamentalist Islam.&quot; However, Italian investigators could not establish his link to the Grey Wolves.

===Norway===
There is allegedly a Grey Wolf group recruiting in Drammen, Norway.

==Illegal drug trade allegations==
Grey Wolves members and leaders have been involved in international drug trafficking since the 1980s. In the early 1980s U.S. anti-terrorism officials at the State Department reported that Türkeş is &quot;widely believed to have been involved&quot; in moving heroin from Turkey into Western Europe. According Stephen E. Ambrose, the leaders of Grey Wolves had built in the late 1980s an army by trading drugs for military equipment, ranging from assault helicopters to tanks. Drugs were transported to Italy, where organized crime processed them. According to Peter Dale Scott, the author of the book &quot;American War Machine&quot;, in 2010 there were drug producing and dealing groups that had clear ties with the Grey Wolves and its affiliated political party, MHP.

==Designation as a terrorist group==
In 2005, Kazakhstan banned the Grey Wolves, classifying it as a terrorist group.

Following the November 2020 ban of the Grey Wolves in France for hate speech and violence, and the calls for similar actions to be taken in the Netherlands and Germany, the European Parliament urged, on 20 May 2021, that the 27 member states of the European Union to designate the Grey Wolves as a terrorist group, and thus, marking the first time that an EU institution has linked the Grey Wolves to terrorism. The Turkish government reacted to the EP report by calling it &quot;biased&quot; and &quot;unacceptable&quot;, because, according to the Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesperson Tanju Bilgiç, the Grey Wolves are &quot;a legal movement, which is associated with a long-established political party in Turkey.&quot; The MFA claimed the &quot;slanders&quot; are &quot;fabricated by the anti-Turkey Armenian diaspora as well as PKK and FETÖ circles.&quot;

In September 2021 Representative Dina Titus (D-NV) proposed designating the Grey Wolves as a terrorist group through an amendment to the Fiscal Year 2022 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). The proposed amendment asked the US Secretary of State to provide &quot;a detailed report of the activities of the Grey Wolves organization undertaken against US interests, allies, and international partners&quot; and determine if the organization &quot;meet the criteria for designation as a foreign terrorist organization.&quot; The state-run Anadolu Agency claimed that the Gülen movement was behind the move.

==Cultural references==
The Grey Wolves organization benefits from Turkish TV films and series, such as those released in 2003 to 2005 or 2018, which glorify Turkish nationalism.
* The Turkish television series &quot;Valley of the Wolves&quot; (&quot;Kurtlar Vadisi&quot;) and &quot;The Wolves&quot; (&quot;Börü&quot;) are particularly likely to provoke an exaggerated nationalist attitude and reinforce enemy images that are inherent in the Ülkücü movement.
* In the 2002 film &quot;Aram&quot; a French-Armenian fighter named Levon attempts to kill a high level Turkish general who is the head of Grey Wolves.
* In the 2003 novel &quot;&quot; (&quot;Empire of the Wolves&quot;) by Jean-Christophe Grangé the Grey Wolves are involved in a woman&#x27;s murder. The 2005 film &quot;Empire of the Wolves&quot; is based on the same-name novel by Grangé.
*The left-wing American podcast &quot;Chapo Trap House&quot; (2016–present) refers to avid fans and Patreon backers as &quot;Grey Wolves,&quot; an ironic reference to the podcast&#x27;s pretended support of Erdoğan and the AKP.

<text>Friday the Rabbi Slept Late is a 1964 mystery novel by Harry Kemelman, the first of the successful &quot;Rabbi Small&quot; series.

== Plot introduction ==

The fictional hero of the book, David Small, is the unconventional leader of the Conservative Jewish congregation in the fictional suburban Massachusetts town of Barnard&#x27;s Crossing. As the protagonist of a series of novels, Rabbi Small has wisdom, an unerring sense of Jewish tradition (which can at times put him at odds with the Jewish community when he believes that they are seriously deviating from Judaism) and all the good qualities of a detective sharpened by his Talmudic training, which enables him to see the &quot;third&quot; side of a problem. He is a devoted husband to his wife and (later in the series) father to his two children Jonathan and Hepsibah. 

Small&#x27;s logic, learned from the Talmud, plays an important part in the plots. Usually Small is drawn into the events when they involve a member of his congregation or Barnard&#x27;s Crossing&#x27;s Jewish community in general. Small has many troubles with his congregation and he is constantly at odds with at least one of its powerful members, usually the Temple President at the time.

Hugh Lanigan is the local police chief. Lanigan (a Catholic) and Small become friendly, and they often discuss religion over a cup of tea.

==Plot summary==

The body of a young woman is found on the grounds of the Temple. The woman had been strangled and evidence points to Rabbi Small - her purse is found in his car, which had been left in the Temple parking lot the night before.

*David Small – the newly hired rabbi of the title; protagonist
*Hugh Lanigan – the local police chief
*Miriam Small – the Rabbi&#x27;s wife
*Jacob Wasserman – the President of the Temple

*Elspeth Bleech – the murder victim, whose body is found on the Temple grounds
*Stanley Doble – the Temple custodian and handyman

<doc id="793944" wikidata="Q2983870" url="?curid=793944" title="Royal Roads Military College">
<text>Royal Roads Military College (RRMC) was a Canadian military college from 1940 to 1995, located in Hatley Park, Colwood, British Columbia, near Victoria, British Columbia, Canada.

The facility now serves as the campus of Royal Roads University, a public university that offers applied and professional academic programs on-campus and via distance education.

The campus&#x27; centrepiece is Hatley Castle, which was erected by architect Samuel Maclure in the early 20th century for British Columbia coal magnate James Dunsmuir and his wife, Laura.

==History==


The property owned by industrialist James Dunsmuir, along with his mansion Hatley Castle, was acquired by the Dominion Government in 1940. The initial plan was that the site would be used to house the British royal family during World War II. However, as the Queen Mother put it, &quot;The children will not go without me and I will not go without the King and the King will never go&quot;.

Designed to support Canada&#x27;s naval war effort, the facility began operating in December 1940 as an officer training establishment known as HMCS &quot;Royal Roads&quot; (named after the Royal Roads naval anchorage). Many of the 600 volunteer reserve officers who underwent training during this time served in the Battle of the Atlantic. HMCS &quot;Royal Roads&quot; was used to train short-term probationary Royal Canadian Navy Volunteer Reserve (RCNVR) sub-lieutenants to serve in World War II.

In 1942, because of wartime expansion, the &quot;Royal Canadian Naval College&quot; was established. In 1947, the facility became known as the &quot;RCN-RCAF Joint Services College&quot; where Royal Canadian Navy and Royal Canadian Air Force personnel were trained. The facility changed its name to &quot;Canadian Services College, Royal Roads&quot; in 1948 where personnel from all three services - the Navy, Air Force, and Army were trained during a two-year program.

In 1968 the college&#x27;s name was changed to &quot;Royal Roads Military College&quot;, and in 1975, the college began granting degrees.

The gentlemen cadets of RRMC were not only required to excel in their respective academic fields, but to achieve the standard in the three other components as well, the Second Language Training component, Physical Fitness component and the Military component. Failure in any of these four components resulted in the officer cadet not being awarded the coveted RRMC degree.

In February 1994, after the end of the Cold War and under the pressure of massive spending cuts from the Government of Canada, the Department of National Defence announced that it would close Royal Roads Military College. The final class graduated in May 1995.

Hatley Park and former Royal Roads Military College was declared a National Historic Site of Canada in 1995 to commemorate the Dunsmuir family (1908–1937) and RRMC (1940–1995). The site was plaqued in 2000 as a Canadian example of an Edwardian park, with gardens, which remains practically intact.

The name Royal Roads was drawn from geography. The name refers to an anchorage located in Juan de Fuca Strait between the city of Victoria, British Columbia and Albert Bay. HMCS &quot;Royal Roads&quot; was located on a property originally purchased by James Dunsmuir in 1902. Dunsmuir was a former British Columbian premier and lieutenant governor. The Hatley Park Estate originally comprised . The Dunsmuir family added Hatley Castle, which was completed in 1908. The Canadian Department of National Defence purchased Hatley Park, almost in its entirety, in 1940, for $75,000. This sum was roughly the value of the fence surrounding the property.

As Executive Officer, Commander Reginald Amand (Jumbo) Webber D.S.C., C.D. served there till late 1942. On June 21, 1995, after negotiations with the Department of National Defence and the Government of British Columbia, the British Columbia government passed the Royal Roads University Act, creating Royal Roads University. The campus is currently leased from the federal government under a $1, 50-year lease agreement with Royal Roads University which was announced in 2001. The Department of National Defence leases approximately 55 hectares of land for the campus to Royal Roads University, and has entered into a five-year Renewable Management Agreement with the University for the maintenance of the remaining 175 hectares of property owned by the Department of National Defence.

The athletic facilities at Hatley Park included a swimming pool, five tennis courts, two squash courts, three soccer pitches, one rugby field, two ball diamonds, a quarter- mile track, a 6.1 km cross country course, jetty and boat house. Cadets played sports including rugby, soccer, baseball, golf, scuba diving, track and field, wrestling, ball hockey, broomball, and ice hockey.

==Squadrons of the Cadet Wing==

The undergraduate student body, known as the Cadet Wing, was sub-divided into four smaller groupings called squadrons, under the guidance and supervision of senior cadets. Until the late 70&#x27;s the four squadrons were populated by undergraduate cadets. When the college started training NCMs it was reorganized so that the first three squadrons were for cadets while 4 Squadron was for mature students from the University Training Program Non-Commissioned Members program. Although squadrons were not named, they were represented by embroidered patches bearing mythological figures, which were worn on the sleeves of the cadet workdress. The squadrons were subdivided into flights, which were named after historical figures (explorers). Cadets competed by squadron in drill and intramurals.

==Band==

By 1955, Royal Roads had a drum and bugle corps. The Brass and Reed Band had already been formed by 1975. WO George Dunn, the first full-time Bandmaster, served from 1975 to 1979. The Pipes and Drums performed at parades, public relation trips and recruit shows. The Pipe Section and the Drum Section performed at mess dinners; parades; sporting events; ceremonies (official or squadron); weddings; funerals; public relations; wing events; Christmas and Graduation Balls; private events; and holidays.

<doc id="793946" wikidata="Q57264" url="?curid=793946" title="Alexandrine of Mecklenburg-Schwerin">
<text>Alexandrine of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (Alexandrine Auguste; 24 December 1879 – 28 December 1952) was Queen of Denmark from 1912 to 1947, as well as Queen of Iceland from 1918 to 1944 as the spouse of King Christian X.

Alexandrine was a daughter of Frederick Francis III, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin and Grand Duchess Anastasia Mikhailovna of Russia. She was brought up with simplicity, and her early life was , spending summers in Mecklenburg and the rest of the year in the south of France. She married Prince Christian of Denmark in 1898.

Alexandrine became crown princess in 1906 and queen consort of Denmark in 1912. She is not considered to have played any political role, but is described as being intelligent and a loyal support to her spouse. In spite of her German background, she was loyal to her new country and stood by her husband during the German occupation of Denmark during World War II.

==Early life==
===Birth and family===

Alexandrine was born a Duchess of Mecklenburg-Schwerin on Christmas Eve of 1879, in the city of Schwerin, the capital of the vast Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin in Northern Germany. Her father was Frederick Francis, Hereditary Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin; who was the eldest son of and heir to the reigning Grand Duke Frederick Francis II. Her mother was Grand Duchess Anastasia Mikhailovna of Russia, who was a granddaughter of Emperor Nicholas I of Russia. Alexandrine was her parents&#x27; first child, and was born eleven months after their wedding in St. Petersburg. She was born in the Neustadt Palace (New Town Palace) in Schwerin, which was her parents&#x27; residence in the city at the time.
Duchess Alexandrine had two younger siblings: her only brother was Duke Frederick Francis, who in 1897 succeeded their father as Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, and her only sister was Duchess Cecilie, who in 1906 married the German Crown Prince Wilhelm of Prussia, eldest son of German Emperor William II. She was also a paternal first cousin of Juliana of the Netherlands. Her mother was the paternal aunt of Princess Irina Alexandrovna of Russia, the wife of Felix Yusupov, one of the murderers of Rasputin.

=== Childhood and early adulthood ===

After their father&#x27;s succession as Grand Duke upon the death of his father on 15 April 1883, Alexandrine grew up with her brother and sister at the Castle in Schwerin, at the royal residences of Ludwigslust Palace and the Gelbensande hunting lodge, only a few kilometres from the Baltic Sea coast. Her father had a fragile health and suffered badly from dermatitis, asthma and respiratory disorders from an early age. The wet, damp, and cold Northern European climate of Mecklenburg was not good for his health, and as a result, Alexandrine spent a large amount of time with her family away from Mecklenburg, by the Lake Geneva, and in Palermo, Baden-Baden and Cannes in the south of France, where the family owned a large estate, the Villa Wenden. Cannes was favoured at the time by European royalty, including some whom Alexandrine personally met, such as Empress Eugénie of France and her future husband&#x27;s uncle, Edward VII of the United Kingdom.

== First years in Denmark ==

=== Engagement and marriage ===
It was also in Cannes during the winter visit of 1897 that Duchess Alexandrine met her future husband, Prince Christian of Denmark, the eldest son of Crown Prince Frederik and Crown Princess Louise of Denmark. The two young royals were engaged in Schwerin on 24 March 1897. In April 1897, shortly after the engagement was announced, her father the Grand Duke died suddenly at the age of just 46 years. His sudden death was somewhat shrouded in mystery as it was first reported that he had committed suicide by throwing himself off a bridge. However, according to the official report, he died in his garden when he fell over a low wall during a bout of shortness of breath.

The wedding of Duchess Alexandrine and Prince Christian was celebrated on 26 April 1898 in Cannes, when she was 18 years old. They had two children:
* Prince Frederik (1899–1972), later King Frederik IX of Denmark; married Princess Ingrid of Sweden
* Prince Knud (1900–1976), later Knud, Hereditary Prince of Denmark; married Princess Caroline-Mathilde of Denmark

=== Early years in Denmark ===
Upon their arrival in Denmark, the couple were given Christian VIII&#x27;s Palace at the Amalienborg palace complex in central Copenhagen as their principal residence and Sorgenfri Palace in Kongens Lyngby north of Copenhagen as a summer residence. Furthermore, the couple received Marselisborg Palace in Aarhus in Jutland as a wedding present from the people of Denmark in 1902, the garden of which was to become one of her greatest interests. In 1914, the King and Queen also built the villa Klitgården in Skagen in Northern Jutland.

On 29 January 1906, her husband&#x27;s grandfather King Christian IX died, and Christian&#x27;s father ascended the throne as King Frederik VIII. Christian himself became crown prince, and Alexandrine became crown princess.

==Queen of Denmark==

On 14 May 1912, King Frederik VIII died suddenly in Hamburg, Germany, while returning from a recuperation stay in Nice in Southern France. Alexandrine&#x27;s husband acceded to the throne as Christian X, and Alexandrine became queen consort of Denmark. She is not considered to have played any political role, but is described as being a loyal support to her spouse.

She was interested in music, and acted as the protector of the musical societies &quot;Musikforeningen i København&quot; and &quot;Den danske Richard Wagnerforening&quot;. She was known for her needlework, which she sold for charitable purposes. After the death of her mother-in-law Louise of Sweden in 1926, she succeeded her as the official protector of the various charity organisations founded by Louise. She enjoyed golf and photography.

During World War I, she founded &quot;Dronningens Centralkomité af 1914&quot; (&quot;The Queen&#x27;s Central Committee of 1914&quot;) to the support of poor families. The revolution in Russia brought much heartbreak for Alexandrine as three of her uncles, Nicholas, George and Sergey, were killed by the Bolsheviks.

She survived the 1918 flu pandemic.

=== World War II ===
The couple was given great popularity as national symbols during the World War II occupation, which was demonstrated during a tour through the country in 1946. Before the occupation, she and her daughter-in-law were engaged in mobilising the Danish women.

Her rejection of Major General Kurt Himer, Chief of Staff to General Kaupisch on 9 April 1940 became a symbol for her loyalty toward Denmark before her birth country Germany. When General Himer asked for an audience with the monarch, Christian was persuaded to receive him by his daughter-in-law as he would any other, which was supported by Alexandrine. He asked to do so alone, but Alexandrine told him she would interrupt them. When the General was about to leave, she came in; and when he greeted her, she said: &quot;General, this is not the circumstance in which I expected to greet a countryman.&quot;

It was reported, that although Alexandrine was seen as shy and disliked official ceremonies, she had a &quot;sharp&quot; intelligence, and she was, together with her daughter-in-law, Ingrid of Sweden, a true support of the monarch and a driving force for the resistance toward the occupation within the royal house. It was also reported, that in contrast to the monarch himself and the Crown Prince, the Queen and the Crown Princess never lost their calm when the nation was attacked. As she was not the Head of the Royal House, she could show herself in public more than her spouse, who did not wish to show support to the occupation by being seen in public, and she used this to engage in various organisations for social relief to ease the difficulties caused by the occupation. Kaj Munk is quoted to describe the public appreciation of her during World War II with his comment: &quot;Protect our Queen, the only German we would like to keep!&quot;

== Later life ==

In 1947, she was widowed; she became the first queen dowager of Denmark to opt not to use that title. In her later years, Alexandrine stayed longer and longer at Marselisborg Castle in Jutland. She remained very active until the end of her life, continuing her work as a patron and her charitable work; she was also an avid golfer and photographer, and produced excellent needlework.

Queen Alexandrine died on 28 December 1952 in her sleep, four days after her birthday after a long illness. She had an intestinal operation a week and a half before her death. She was buried at the traditional burial place of the royal family in Roskilde Cathedral.

<doc id="793953" wikidata="Q2059829" url="?curid=793953" title="Limerick Junction railway station">
<text>Limerick Junction () is the interchange railway station for trains originating in , , , , and stations. The station opened on 3 July 1848.

The station was highly noted for its layout which prior to 1967 required every train making a stop at the station to make a reversal to do so. The latest changes in 2019, including the addition of a new island platform, mean only trains to and from the Waterford direction need to reverse before and after accessing the station.

==Location==
The station is located in the townland of Ballykisteen, County Tipperary, Ireland, in the county&#x27;s historical barony of Clanwilliam. It is from Limerick City, from , and from . Tipperary town is about away to the south-east, and the station was originally named &quot;Tipperary Junction&quot;. The station lies just of the N24 road from Limerick to Waterford. Tipperary Racecourse lies just to the west of the station.

Beyond a cluster of railway cottages there has been no development of a village around the station, though there is a public house, and the settlement would be considered a small hamlet.

==Services==

There are 48 trains on a weekday to 6 destinations: 17 trains to Dublin Heuston, 13 to Cork, 2 to Waterford, 11 to Limerick and 3 to .

There is an hourly train to Limerick, with some services extended to or Galway. Most trains operating between Dublin and Cork or vice versa stop here.

==Buses==
Amongst other bus services, Local Link route 855 stops at Limerick Junction Railway Station (the timetable is 855 – (T41) Tipperary Town to Cashel via Cahir &amp; Limerick Junction Timetable).

==Layout==

Because of its complex layout it has a special place in railway lore: it is the only remaining railway junction in Ireland where two lines cross at a near-90-degree angle, the other being the &quot;Dundalk Square&quot; crossing near . One route is the Dublin-Cork main line, while the other is the line from Limerick to . Trains from all four locations are served, some connecting to in County Clare and in County Kerry.

The layout consists of four platforms, all of which are in use. The main line platform, number 1, is a through platform and primary use is for trains from Cork which access the station from a loop off of the main &quot;up&quot; line to Dublin. It is also possible for trains from Dublin, Limerick or Waterford to access the Platform 1 if required. The terminal platform, to the west of Platform 1, is numbered 2 and 3 for parts nearest and furthest from the buffers respectively. This allows two trains to be present at once, typically allowing a Waterford train and Limerick train to be simultaneously present. Access to Platforms 2 and 3 for trains from anywhere other than Limerick requires reversing. A train coming from Waterford must cross the Dublin-Cork main line towards Limerick, reversing along the curve used by trains arriving from Limerick. It can then stop at the Limerick bay.

Platform 4, added in 2019, is used by trains from Dublin towards Cork. The platform is accessed by footbridge from platform with lifts to the upper level also provided. A disadvantage with platform 4 is that cross platform interchange of trains is no longer possible.

==History==
The station opened on 3 July 1848 as the latest extension of the GS&amp;WR line from Dublin to Cork, connecting to the Waterford and Limerick Railway (W&amp;LR) at the same time which had opened to Tipperary from Limerick some two months previously. The station was owned by the GS&amp;WR, the W&amp;LR paying rent for use.

==Pre-1967==

The original layout was soon altered to the one that was to remain until 1967, requiring all trains to reverse to access the station. Trains from the W&amp;LR would arrive at the station prior to and leave after than those from the GS&amp;WR. It was common for trains to Dublin and Cork to be arranged to across at the same time, with 10 minutes being allowed for the stop, and the locomotives for Dublin and Cork facing each other, four trains being in the station at the same time.

The W&amp;LR briefly in 1880 constructed a platform at Keane&#x27;s points, where its trains left the W&amp;LR line to the GS&amp;WR station, leaving passengers to walk to the GS&amp;WR platform.

In 1955 the crossing from the Cork platform to the down line was changed from a diamond crossing to a ladder crossing. The change, made to support a new cement train service, meant that a train coming from Cork could proceed directly to Limerick without reversal.

==1967==

The 1967 changes were, at least in part, initiated by the closure of the Waterford–Mallow railway line and subsequent diversion of the Rosslare to Cork boat trains to run over Waterford to Limerick line instead. Also in 1967 a short curve was constructed just north of Limerick Junction allowing through main line trains between Limerick and Dublin without reversal at or Limerick Junction itself, trains using the direct curve being unable stop at the station. The curve is only used by three trains each way per day since the most recent timetable changes in December 2009. Through running (without reversal) from Limerick to Mallow and Cork is possible.

The station at Limerick Junction is surrounded by track. Trains accessing the Waterford bay from Limerick or Waterford must reverse into the platform. Trains from Waterford also reverse back from &quot;Keane&#x27;s points&quot;, where the curve out from the station joins the line.

==2007==
 2007 the platform south of the station building was truncated leaving to elimination of the &quot;Waterford Bay&quot; with the vacated area being allocated to a car park.

The line skirting to the west of the station to the &quot;Waterford Bay&quot; became disused from 2006. The track layout here has been reduced to now only two platforms. The bay platform to the north is used for trains to Limerick and Waterford/Rosslare and the main line platform is used for Dublin to Cork trains. The Waterford bay, which was located at the south end of the station, is now lifted and the so has the line that ran behind the station. The scissor crossover which is located halfway down the mainline platform is due to be lifted and the south loop of the mainline has now been disconnected. The Cork half of the through platform has also been removed and the area used to extend the car park.

==2019==

A new platform 4 became operational on 25 August 2019. Associated works included a new 20 metre span footbridge, passenger shelters and seating and new lighting. The platform, measuring 260 metres, has removed the constraints and speed restrictions associated with the former single platform which catered for all Dublin to Cork/Kerry services in both directions. Improved journey times of up to five minutes for Dublin to Cork/Kerry services, and of up to 11 minutes for Limerick to Cork/Dublin services due to improved connections will be delivered over time, the company hopes. A new footbridge with high capacity lifts was also built, catering for customers transferring to the new platform. The investment was worth €3.5m to the station. The planning application for the new platform and associated works was submitted to Tipperary County Council in April 2018, with planning permission granted in June 2018. Works were completed both between trains and during railway possessions.

==Horse racing==

Limerick Junction was also the name of the racecourse at the same location. In 1986 it was renamed Tipperary Racecourse. The course is not conducive to winter racing because of the frequency of water-logging. 
Racing here is a major attraction during the summer months and large crowds are attracted to the venue, especially for the Thursday evening meetings.

<text>Bowman Foster Ashe (April 3, 1885 – December 16, 1952) was a U.S. educator who served as the first president of the University of Miami.

==Early life and education==
Bowman Foster Ashe was born in Scottdale, Pennsylvania, a suburb of Pittsburgh, on April 3, 1885, one of six sons of a Methodist minister.

He attended the University of Mount Union in Alliance, Ohio, and then transferred to the University of Pittsburgh, where he earned a Bachelor of Science degree in 1910.

==Career==
After graduation, Ashe took a job teaching public school English and history. He also worked as the educational and social director for Langeloth, Pennsylvania, a coal mining company town near Pittsburgh. Ashe&#x27;s work eventually led him back to the University of Pittsburgh, where he became a faculty member and supervised the admission, transfer, and academic progress of freshmen and sophomores.

===University of Miami===

The founders of the University of Miami&#x27;s hired Ashe from the University of Pittsburgh to oversee the institution during its challenged infancy. During Ashe&#x27;s presidency, the university added the School of Law (1928), the School of Business Administration (1929), the School of Education (1929), the Graduate School (1941), the School of Marine and Atmospheric Science (1943), the College of Engineering (1947), and the School of Medicine (1952).

In 1926, Ashe partnered with Seminole Tribe in building the Iron Arrow Honor Society, which now is the highest honor the University of Miami can bestow on a student, administrator, or faculty member. At its 1926 founding, Iron Arrow was founded to recognize male high achievers. Fifty years later, in 1976, the federal government notified the University of Miami that it was providing significant assistance to Iron Arrow in violation of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972. In 1985, breaking with over fifty years of tradition, the society&#x27;s all-male membership voted to admit women and Iron Arrow was allowed back on campus.

In 1929, with the collapse of the economy, the University of Miami&#x27;s financial plight was severe, and Ashe took over as chairman of its board of trustees. He later gave up that role but continued as president. He recruited Jay F. W. Pearson from the University of Pittsburgh to join him as a part of the charter faculty and as an administrator. Pearson took over as president in November 1952 upon the first of two debilitating strokes, which led to Ashe&#x27;s death the following month.

==Honors and legacy==
The University of Miami&#x27;s administration building, the Bowman Foster Ashe Administration Building, and Bowman Foster Ashe Elementary School in West Kendall, Florida are both named in his honor. Ashe was also inducted into the Iron Arrow Honor Society, the University of Miami&#x27;s highest honor, which he helped create in 1926.

==Personal life==
Ashe&#x27;s grandson, Gary Dunn, played collegiate football at the University of Miami, In 1976, Dunn was drafted by the Pittsburgh Steelers, where he played for 12 seasons.

==Death==
Ashe died December 16, 1952 of cerebral hemorrhage, at Doctors Hospital in Coral Gables, Florida, at age 67.

<doc id="793962" wikidata="Q4570633" url="?curid=793962" title="1961–62 United States network television schedule">
<text>The following is the 1961–62 network television schedule for the three major English language commercial broadcast networks in the United States. The schedule covers primetime hours from September 1961 through April 1962. The schedule is followed by a list per network of returning series, new series, and series cancelled after the 1960–61 season.

The previous season had been criticized by Federal Communications Commission chairman Newton Minow in May 1961. Minow had criticized poor programs and weak network schedules, calling television a &quot;vast wasteland&quot; and calling on television executives to try harder to develop innovative and interesting television programs.

Television historians Castleman and Podrazik (1982) believe the 1961–62 season marked a comeback for television, as the networks rearranged their schedules to accommodate the critics. They point out CBS&#x27;s high-quality legal drama &quot;The Defenders&quot;, NBC&#x27;s medical drama &quot;Dr. Kildare&quot;, CBS&#x27;s &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot;, and ABC&#x27;s medical drama &quot;Ben Casey&quot; as bright spots in the new TV schedule. Despite the praise for these four series, the authors also highlight several less worthy series which debuted during the 1961–62 season: &quot;Room for One More&quot;, &quot;Window on Main Street&quot;, &quot;Hazel&quot; (&quot;possibly the dumbest family in TV history&quot;), and the truly terrible &quot;The Hathaways&quot; (&quot;possibly the worst series ever to air on network TV&quot;).

NBC lured Disney&#x27;s popular anthology series from ABC; &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Wonderful World of Color&quot; premiered on September 24, 1961. The color programs were a change from the previous ABC programs, which had been seen in black and white.

NBC also added a movie night to its schedule; the network paid $25 million for the rights to broadcast 50 20th-Century Fox films on Saturday nights. In April 1962, ABC followed suit when it added its own Sunday night movie to its schedule.

All times are Eastern and Pacific. New fall series are highlighted in bold.

<text>Elizabeth Alice Austen (March 17, 1866 – June 9, 1952) was an American photographer working in Staten Island. She is best known for her street photography and her intimate depictions of women&#x27;s lives and relationships in the Victorian era.

==Biography==
Alice Austen was born Elizabeth Alice Austen on March 17, 1866, in Rosebank, New York to Alice Cornell Austen and Edward Stopford Munn. Her great-great-grandfather, Peter Townsend, was the owner of Sterling Iron Works famous for forging the Hudson River Chain used to thwart British ships during the American Revolutionary War. Austen&#x27;s father abandoned the family around 1869, prompting Austen and her mother to move to her family&#x27;s Victorian Gothic farmhouse, nicknamed Clear Comfort, where they lived with Austen&#x27;s maternal grandparents, her uncle, and her aunt and her husband. She was encouraged at a young age to pursue various activities and hobbies, and was first introduced to photography at the age of ten by her uncle Oswald.

== Photography ==
Austen was a self-taught photographer, and primarily used photographic plates and a camera manufactured by the Scovill Company. She also meticulously recorded information about her photographs, including the glass plate brand, aperture, and exposure time. Austen used a darkroom, likely designed by her uncle, an amateur photographer and chemistry professor at Rutgers University, and produced over 7,000 photographs up through the 1930s, most notably depicting New York&#x27;s immigrant populations, the inner lives and activities of Victorian women, and her travels to Europe.

Austen is notable as one of the first female photographers to work outside of a studio and was known to transport up to fifty pounds of camera equipment on her bicycle. Austen is considered an amateur photographer as she was independently wealthy and typically did not sell her work to support herself. She copyrighted much of her work, though little of it was ever marketed. In 1895, she began work on a portfolio project titled &quot;Street Types of New York&quot; made up of street photography portraits of various tradespeople in working-class neighborhoods in Manhattan. From the mid-1890s to 1912, Austen worked for Alvah H. Doty photographing the equipment and conditions at the Quarantine Station of Ellis Island. Many of her photographs from this time were featured in an exhibit at the 1901 Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York, and published in &quot;Harpers Weekly Magazine&quot; and &quot;Medical Record&quot;.

Her work was also published in Violet Ward&#x27;s &quot;Bicycling for Ladies&quot; in 1896, although she was not credited. The majority of her work was intended for private viewing, as they depicted intimate relationships between Victorian women and scenes from a non-traditional lifestyle, which including smoking, cross-dressing, and biking. Austen&#x27;s work is today considered significant for providing a rare look into the private lives of queer Victorian women.

== Relationships and later life ==

In 1897, Austen met Gertrude Tate, a teacher from Brooklyn, while on vacation in the Catskills. They soon began a romantic relationship, with Tate moving into Clear Comfort in 1917, with the permission of Austen&#x27;s aunt. Austen continued to take photographs of her home and friends, and of her travels in Europe with Tate, though many of her film negatives from the 1920s and 1930s were never printed. Austen was an active member of Staten Island society, founding the Staten Island Garden Club and participating in the Staten Island Bicycle Club. She is said to have been the first woman in Staten Island to own a car. In 1929, Austen lost her savings in the Wall Street crash, and she and Tate financially struggled throughout the Great Depression. The two women worked to support themselves, with Tate offering dance classes and the brief establishment of a tea room in their home. In 1944, Austen was forced to sell Clear Comfort, and the pair was evicted from the house in 1945. Austen and Tate moved into an apartment in St. George, Staten Island, where they lived until 1949, when it became too difficult to care for Austen&#x27;s arthritis. She was subsequently declared a pauper by the state and transferred to the New York City Farm Colony in Castleton. Tate moved to Jackson Heights, Queens to live with her family, who disapproved of her relationship with Austen.

In 1951, historian and former &quot;LIFE&quot; magazine writer Oliver Jensen discovered her photographs, which had been transferred to the Staten Island Historical Society. Jensen helped publish the photos in &quot;LIFE&quot; and other magazines, helping raise enough money to transfer Austen to a private nursing home. The Staten Island Historical Society also sponsored &quot;Alice Austen Day&quot; featuring the first public exhibit of Austen&#x27;s work. Austen passed away on June 9, 1952, following a stroke. She was buried in her family&#x27;s plot in Moravian Cemetery in Staten Island, and despite their wish to be buried together, Tate was buried in Cypress Hills Cemetery in Brooklyn after her death in 1962.

== Museum and legacy ==

In the 1960s, when the opening of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge made waterfront property in Staten Island more valuable, a group of concerned citizens formed The Friends of Alice Austen to save her former home from demolition. Some preservationists involved in this effort included photographer Berenice Abbott and architect Phillip Johnson. The campaign was ultimately successful, with the Landmarks Preservation Commission designating the house as a New York City Landmark, prompting the city to purchase the property in 1975. With over $1 million from the city&#x27;s capital budget, the Alice Austen House was renovated and opened as a museum in 1985. The house was also designated as a National Historic Landmark in 1993. The Friends of Alice Austen House was formally incorporated as a nonprofit organization in 1979, and continues to operate the house and surrounding garden in coordination with the Department of Parks and Recreation.

In 1994, the Alice Austen House was the site of a demonstration by the activist group the Lesbian Avengers, who advocated for the acknowledgement of Austen and Tate&#x27;s same-sex relationship.

In 2017, the Alice Austen House was designated as a National LGBT Historic Site, and also received a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities to incorporate Austen and Tate&#x27;s relationship into the museum.

The Alice Austen School, PS 60, located in the Bulls Head neighborhood of Staten Island, is named in her honor, as well as a Staten Island Ferry boat. Playwright Robin Rice&#x27;s drama &quot;Alice in Black and White&quot; traces Austen&#x27;s life from 1876 to 1951. The play also follows Oliver Jensen&#x27;s search for and discovery of Austen and her glass plate negatives. The play first premiered at the Kentucky Center in 2013, and then at 59E59 Theaters in New York City in 2016, the 150th anniversary of Austen&#x27;s birth. The play also received the StageWrite Women&#x27;s Theatre Initiative Award at the Great Plains Theatre Conference in Omaha, Nebraska.

Her life and work inspired the 2022 young adult fiction book &quot;Alice Austen Lived Here&quot; by Alex Gino, in which two non-binary middle schoolers do a US History report about Austen. In 2022, a podcast created by scholar Pamela Bannos in collaboration with the Alice Austen House Museum, titled &quot;My Dear Alice&quot;, was released, featuring excerpts from Austen&#x27;s correspondence with various friends and family.

<text>Nathaniel Davis Ayer (August 5, 1887 – September 19, 1952) was an American composer, pianist, singer and actor. He made most of his career composing and performing in England in Edwardian musical comedy and revue. He also contributed songs to Broadway shows, including some of the &quot;Ziegfeld Follies&quot;.

Ayer&#x27;s most successful shows were the World War I hits &quot;The Bing Boys Are Here&quot; (1916) and &quot;Yes, Uncle&quot; (1917). His best-known Broadway song was &quot;Oh, You Beautiful Doll&quot; (1911). Of his many songs composed for London shows, his most famous is probably &quot;If You Were the Only Girl In the World&quot; (1916). After the war, he had less success and was declared bankrupt in 1938.

==Life and career==

===Early years===
Ayer was born Nathaniel Davis in Boston, Massachusetts. His first big hit was the song &quot;Oh, You Beautiful Doll&quot; (1911), with words by A. Seymour Brown (1885–1947). He wrote songs for Broadway revues and musical comedies including &quot;Miss Innocence&quot; (1908), &quot;The Newlyweds and their Baby&quot; (1909), &quot;Ziegfeld Follies of 1909,&quot; &quot;The Echo&quot; (1910), &quot;A Winsome Widow&quot;, &quot;The Wall Street Girl&quot;, &quot;Let George Do It&quot; (all 1912) and &quot;Ziegfeld Follies of 1916&quot;.

Ayer first visited London as a member of the Ragtime Octet in the years before the First World War. In 1912 he contributed to the West End revue &quot;Hullo, Ragtime&quot; the song &quot;You’re My Baby&quot; with words by Brown. In 1913 he appeared at the Tivoli music hall in the Strand, with Harry Williams, performing songs of their own composition, with Ayer at the piano. Later in the same year, the two appeared in &quot;The Hippodrome Revue&quot;, when &quot;The Times&quot; described them thus:

One of Ayer&#x27;s and Williams&#x27;s songs, &quot;That Ragtime Suffragette&quot;, was the subject of a court case in October 1913, when the lyricist and composer successfully took action to prevent others from violating its copyright.

===West End shows===
In 1916, Ayer composed the music for the hit show &quot;The Bing Boys Are Here&quot;, with a book by George Grossmith Jr. and Fred Thompson and lyrics by Clifford Grey. His best-known song from that show is &quot;If You Were the Only Girl In the World&quot;, adapted from a song by Willy Redstone which he had sold to Bert Feldman. In the same year, Ayer appeared with Alice Delysia in the revue &quot;Pell-Mell&quot;, with songs by Ayer and Grey. Ayer&#x27;s last show of 1916, which he composed and appeared in, was the musical comedy &quot;Houp La!&quot;, starring Gertie Millar. It was not a success, running for just over 100 performances, but Ayer&#x27;s next show, &quot;Yes, Uncle&quot;, was a considerable hit, with a run of 626 performances.

Ayer&#x27;s post-war shows were &quot;Baby Bunting&quot; (1919), &quot;Snap&quot;, &quot;Shufflin&#x27; Along&quot; and &quot;The Smith Family&quot; (1922). In 1938 he was declared bankrupt. He appeared as himself in the 1943 film &quot;Variety Jubilee&quot;.

Ayer died in 1952 in Bath, in the west of England, at the age of 65.

<doc id="793974" wikidata="Q348032" url="?curid=793974" title="Šarūnas Marčiulionis">
<text>Raimondas Šarūnas Marčiulionis (; born June 13, 1964) is a Lithuanian former professional basketball player. Widely considered one of the greatest international players, he was one of the first Europeans to become a regular in the National Basketball Association (NBA). Marčiulionis was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2014 and became a member of the FIBA Hall of Fame in 2015.

In the 1988 Summer Olympics, together with teammate Arvydas Sabonis, Marčiulionis led the senior USSR national team to the gold medal. With the senior Lithuanian national team, he won two Summer Olympics bronze medals, in 1992 and 1996. He was an All-Tournament Team member, the top scorer, and the MVP of the EuroBasket 1995, and he was also elected to the All-EuroBasket Team in 1987.

Marčiulionis is also often remembered for and associated with the Euro step move during his seven seasons playing in the NBA, which was popularized by Manu Ginóbili in the mid-2000s.

==Early life==
Marčiulionis was the second son of Laimutė, a geography teacher, and Juozas, an engineer. Given that Laimutė aggravated a spinal injury while giving birth to his sister Zita, her determination in having a son led to the middle name Šarūnas, invoking a legendary knight from Vincas Krėvė-Mickevičius&#x27;s works. Growing up in Kaunas, Marčiulionis took up tennis while growing up, being an ambidextrous player focused on forehands. Given his unorthodox technique, and an increasingly bulky frame, he eventually gave up on the sport.

At the age of 13, following a hospitalization caused by the use of makeshift explosives, Marčiulionis changed to the sport of basketball. In the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic, he and his friends had to build their own outdoor basketball court in a parking lot. When he moved to Vilnius, to study journalism at Vilnius State University of Vincas Kapsukas, and possibly try out for the Soviet junior national team, all Marčiulionis&#x27; parents could provide him was, &quot;one bag containing a very small amount of clothes, and another full of apples.&quot;

==Professional career==

===Statyba===
While Marčiulionis attended college, he rarely played basketball, but he eventually attracted a scout from Statyba, of the USSR Premier League, in 1981. He would play with Statyba, in the USSR League, from 1981 to 1989.

===NBA===
During a 1985 game against Athletes in Action, in Vilnius, Marčiulionis struck up a friendship with one of the opposing players, Donnie Nelson, despite the language barrier. Nelson&#x27;s father Don Nelson would later be the head coach of the Golden State Warriors, and what he said about Marčiulionis&#x27; skills led the Warriors to draft him in the 6th round of the 1987 NBA draft. Stan Kasten, president and general manager of the Atlanta Hawks, managed to void the pick by showing Marčiulionis was age 23, one year older than the age the draft rules prescribed for European players. , Marčiulionis was the last NBA player to have his selection ineligible in an NBA draft due to him being above the draft age limitations at the time of his initial selection. The Hawks then pursued Marčiulionis using then-owner Ted Turner&#x27;s connections with the Soviet Union, inviting him and other Soviet players to their training camp, and arranging for Hawks–USSR matches in Moscow, in 1988. While Marčiulionis signed a contract with Atlanta, the day after he won the gold medal in the 1988 Summer Olympics, the team wound up not submitting it to the NBA&#x27;s offices, as the Soviets said they would not permit the player to leave.

Eventually, Nelson&#x27;s influence helped Marčiulionis with his social projects in Vilnius, and led him to remain with the Warriors, with whom he signed a three-year $3.8 million contract, in 1989. Marčiulionis became the first Soviet player to join the North American league, and played four years with the Warriors, finishing as the runner-up for the Sixth Man of the Year Award in 1992. Marčiulionis became one of the first Europeans to get significant playing time in the NBA, helping to lead the way for the internationalization of the league in the late 1990s. After missing a year-and-a-half with a leg injury, he was traded, along with Byron Houston, to the Seattle SuperSonics in 1994 in exchange for Carlos Rogers, Ricky Pierce, and two 1995 second-round draft picks. In 1995, Marčiulionis and Houston were traded to the Sacramento Kings for Frank Brickowski. He finished his NBA career with the Denver Nuggets, in the 1996–97 season.

==National team career==
===Soviet national team===
In 1982 and 1983, Marčiulionis played sparingly with the Soviet juniors. He won a gold medal at the 1982 FIBA Europe Under-18 Championship, and a silver medal at the 1983 FIBA Under-19 World Cup, in Spain. Marčiulionis was frequently the last man cut from the senior Soviet Union national basketball team training camps, until he finally got his chance with the senior team in 1987, having a breakout performance, while winning a silver medal at the EuroBasket 1987. Marčiulionis would also be one of the standout players, as the Soviets won the gold medal at the 1988 Summer Olympics.

===Lithuanian national team===
Following the restoration of Lithuanian independence, in 1990, Marčiulionis almost single-handedly resurrected the senior Lithuanian national team. He contacted prospective players, encouraged several to join, selected the uniforms, negotiated a shoe deal, and arranged for sponsorships, along with friend Donnie Nelson. Sponsor deals struck by him included Bank of America and the rock band Grateful Dead, who were interested in supporting Lithuania, after reading a story on Marčiulionis and the national team, in the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;. The Grateful Dead also helped launch a line of tie-dyed jerseys, that would feature Lithuania&#x27;s national colors, along with a slam dunking skeleton, created by New York artist Greg Speirs. Speirs became a major sponsor when he donated 100% of his profits from his design to fund the team, and to Lithuanian children&#x27;s charities, amounting to at least $450,000. The team went on to win a bronze medal at the 1992 Summer Olympics.

Marčiulionis was again a bronze medalist with Lithuania, at the 1996 Summer Olympics. In 1995, he was named the MVP of the 1995 FIBA EuroBasket, after leading Lithuania to a silver medal in the tournament. In 1987, 1989, 1990, and 1991, he was voted the best sportsman in Lithuania.

Marčiulionis&#x27; basketball career and journey to represent his native country Lithuania in the 1992 Barcelona Olympics is highlighted in the documentary film &quot;The Other Dream Team&quot;. The film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in 2012 and was distributed by Lionsgate in the U.S. and Disney internationally.

==Post-playing career==

In 1992, Marčiulionis opened the Šarūnas Hotel in Vilnius. In 1993, he founded the Lithuanian Basketball League (LKL), and also became its president. In 1999, Marčiulionis founded the North European Basketball League (NEBL), and also became its commissioner. The NEBL would later be absorbed into the Baltic Basketball League. Today, he is one of the most successful businessmen in Lithuania. He was also the President of the Šarūnas Marčiulionis Basketball Academy.

On February 14, 2014, Marčiulionis was announced as a 2014 player inductee, by the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame; he formally entered the Hall on August 8. On September 19, 2015, Marčiulionis was inducted into the FIBA Hall of Fame.

On October 2, 2015, it was announced that Šarūnas Hotel was closed. The nearby Šarūnas Marčiulionis Basketball academy meanwhile, was closed after the 2015–16 season.

On May 26, 2019, Marčiulionis was elected to the European Parliament to serve in the Ninth European Parliament. However, on May 28, he announced that he decided to give up his seat in the European Parliament.
==Personal life==
Even with language barriers, Marčiulionis was a devoted teammate, and active in the communities he played in. In 1987, he helped a Panevėžys man get an artificial heart valve for his son, by appealing to Donnie Nelson, who arranged an operation for the teenager in the United States. In the aftermath of the 1989 San Francisco earthquake, Marčiulionis appeared at the site of a commuter train accident, wearing his Warriors warm up outfit, and he helped by pulling out trapped passengers and administering first aid.

After he joined the Warriors, Marčiulionis&#x27;s wife Inga enrolled at Merritt College, where she walked on to their women&#x27;s basketball team and was a star player for two seasons. She became one of 147 women in women&#x27;s college basketball history to score 50 or more points in a college game while at Merritt College, and joined the faculty of Merritt College after graduating. She served as head coach of Merritt&#x27;s women&#x27;s basketball team, and is now the head of their kinesiology department.

Marčiulionis and Inga are divorced and have one daughter. Inga lives in the United States and continues her work at Merritt College.

Marčiulionis married Laura Mikelionytė on March 10, 2012.

Šarūnas&#x27; son Augustas Marčiulionis made his debut in the Lithuanian Basketball League on September 19, 2020, as a member of his father&#x27;s first professional team Rytas Vilnius. Augustas played on an amateur contract to preserve his eligibility to play NCAA basketball, and on June 16, 2021, signed a letter of intent to play at Saint Mary&#x27;s College starting in the 2021–22 season.

<doc id="793975" wikidata="Q50076" url="?curid=793975" title="Horizontal branch">
<text>The horizontal branch (HB) is a stage of stellar evolution that immediately follows the red-giant branch in stars whose masses are similar to the Sun&#x27;s. Horizontal-branch stars are powered by helium fusion in the core (via the triple-alpha process) and by hydrogen fusion (via the CNO cycle) in a shell surrounding the core. The onset of core helium fusion at the tip of the red-giant branch causes substantial changes in stellar structure, resulting in an overall reduction in luminosity, some contraction of the stellar envelope, and the surface reaching higher temperatures.

==Discovery==
Horizontal branch stars were discovered with the first deep photographic photometric studies of globular clusters
and were notable for being absent from all open clusters that had been studied up to that time. The horizontal branch is so named because in low-metallicity star collections like globular clusters, HB stars lie along a roughly horizontal line in a Hertzsprung–Russell diagram. Because the stars of one globular cluster are all at essentially the same distance from us, their apparent magnitudes all have the same relationship to their absolute magnitudes, and thus absolute-magnitude-related properties are plainly visible on an H-R diagram confined to stars of that cluster, undiffused by distance and thence magnitude uncertainties.

==Evolution==

After exhausting their core hydrogen, stars leave the main sequence and begin fusion in a hydrogen shell around the helium core and become giants on the red-giant branch. In stars with masses up to 2.3 times the mass of the Sun the helium core becomes a region of degenerate matter that does not contribute to the generation of energy. It continues to grow and increase in temperature as the hydrogen fusion in the shell contributes more helium.

If the star has more than about 0.5 solar masses, the core eventually reaches the temperature necessary for the fusion of helium into carbon through the triple-alpha process. The initiation of helium fusion begins across the core region, which will cause an immediate temperature rise and a rapid increase in the rate of fusion. Within a few seconds the core becomes non-degenerate and quickly expands, producing an event called helium flash. Non-degenerate cores initiate fusion more smoothly, without a flash. The output of this event is absorbed by the layers of plasma above, so the effects are not seen from the exterior of the star. The star now changes to a new equilibrium state, and its evolutionary path switches from the red-giant branch (RGB) onto the horizontal branch of the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram.

Stars initially between about and have larger helium cores that do not become degenerate. Instead their cores reach the Schönberg–Chandrasekhar mass at which they are no longer in hydrostatic or thermal equilibrium. They then contract and heat up, which triggers helium fusion before the core becomes degenerate. These stars also become hotter during core helium fusion, but they have different core masses and hence different luminosities from HB stars. They vary in temperature during core helium fusion and perform a blue loop before moving to the asymptotic giant branch. Stars more massive than about also ignite their core helium smoothly, and also go on to burn heavier elements as a red supergiant.

Stars remain on the horizontal branch for around 100 million years, becoming slowly more luminous in the same way that main sequence stars increase luminosity as the virial theorem shows. When their core helium is eventually exhausted, they progress to helium shell burning on the asymptotic giant branch (AGB). On the AGB they become cooler and much more luminous.

==Horizontal branch morphology==
Stars on the horizontal branch all have very similar core masses, following the helium flash. This means that they have very similar luminosities, and on a Hertzsprung–Russell diagram plotted by visual magnitude the branch is horizontal.

The size and temperature of an HB star depends on the mass of the hydrogen envelope remaining around the helium core. Stars with larger hydrogen envelopes are cooler. This creates the spread of stars along the horizontal branch at constant luminosity. The temperature variation effect is much stronger at lower metallicity, so old clusters usually have more pronounced horizontal branches.

Although the horizontal branch is named because it consists largely of stars with approximately the same absolute magnitude across a range of temperatures, lying in a horizontal bar on a color–magnitude diagrams, the branch is far from horizontal at the blue end. The horizontal branch ends in a &quot;blue tail&quot; with hotter stars having lower luminosity, occasionally with a &quot;blue hook&quot; of extremely hot stars. It is also not horizontal when plotted by bolometric luminosity, with hotter horizontal branch stars being less luminous than cooler ones.

The hottest horizontal-branch stars, referred to as extreme horizontal branch, have temperatures of 20,000–30,000 K. This is far beyond what would be expected for a normal core helium burning star. Theories to explain these stars include binary interactions, and &quot;late thermal pulses&quot;, where a thermal pulse that asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars experience regularly, occurs after fusion has ceased and the star has entered the superwind phase. These stars are &quot;born again&quot; with unusual properties. Despite the bizarre-sounding process, this is expected to occur for 10% or more of post-AGB stars, although it is thought that only particularly late thermal pulses create extreme horizontal-branch stars, after the planetary nebular phase and when the central star is already cooling towards a white dwarf.

==The RR Lyrae gap==

Globular cluster CMDs (Color-Magnitude diagrams) generally show horizontal branches that have a prominent gap in the HB. This gap in the CMD incorrectly suggests that the cluster has no stars in this region of its CMD. The gap occurs at the instability strip, where many pulsating stars are found. These pulsating horizontal-branch stars are known as RR Lyrae variable stars and they are obviously variable in brightness with periods of up to 1.2 days.
It requires an extended observing program to establish the star&#x27;s true (that is, averaged over a full period) apparent magnitude and color. Such a program is usually beyond the scope of an investigation of a cluster&#x27;s color–magnitude diagram. Because of this, while the variable stars are noted in tables of a cluster&#x27;s stellar content from such an investigation, these variable stars are not included in the graphic presentation of the cluster CMD because data adequate to plot them correctly are unavailable. This omission often results in the &quot;RR Lyrae gap&quot; seen in many published globular cluster CMDs.

Different globular clusters often display different HB &quot;morphologies&quot;, by which is meant that the relative proportions of HB stars existing on the hotter end of the RR Lyr gap, within the gap, and to the cooler end of the gap varies sharply from cluster to cluster. The underlying cause of different HB morphologies is a long-standing problem in stellar astrophysics. Chemical composition is one factor (usually in the sense that more metal-poor clusters have bluer HBs), but other stellar properties like age, rotation and helium content have also been suggested as affecting HB morphology. This has sometimes been called the &quot;Second Parameter Problem&quot; for globular clusters, because there exist pairs of globular clusters which seem to have the same metallicity yet have very different HB morphologies; one such pair is NGC 288 (which has a very blue HB) and NGC 362 (which has a rather red HB). The label &quot;second parameter&quot; acknowledges that some unknown physical effect is responsible for HB morphology differences in clusters that seem otherwise identical.

==Relationship to the red clump==
A related class of stars is the &quot;clump giants&quot;, those belonging to the so-called red clump, which are the relatively younger (and hence more massive) and usually more metal-rich population I counterparts to HB stars (which belong to population II). Both HB stars and clump giants are fusing helium to carbon in their cores, but differences in the structure of their outer layers result in the different types of stars having different radii, effective temperatures, and color. Since color index is the horizontal coordinate in a Hertzsprung–Russell diagram, the different types of star appear in different parts of the CMD despite their common energy source. In effect, the red clump represents one extreme of horizontal-branch morphology: all the stars are at the red end of the horizontal branch, and may be difficult to distinguish from stars ascending the red-giant branch for the first time.

<doc id="793976" wikidata="Q7314536" url="?curid=793976" title="Republic of Winston">
<text>The informal Republic of Winston, or Free State of Winston, an area encompassing the present-day Winston, Cullman and Blount counties of Alabama, was one of several places in the Confederate States of America where disaffection during the American Civil War was strong. In Winston County, this opposition became violent and had long-lasting political consequences—deep enough to generate a legend after the war that the county had seceded from Alabama.

==Background==
Winston County is located in the hilly terrain of North Alabama. The area&#x27;s shallow soil is highly unsuitable for plantation-style agriculture, and thus the county had never been home to many slaves. The 1860 U.S. Census lists only 3,450 white residents in the county and 122 slaves. Winston&#x27;s residents were mainly poor farmers.

==Refusal of the Ordinance of Secession==
Winston County&#x27;s representative at the January 1861 Alabama Secession Convention was Charles Christopher Sheats, a 21-year-old schoolteacher. He refused to sign Alabama&#x27;s Ordinance of Secession, even after it had been passed by a vote of 61 to 39. Sheats became so vocal in his opposition that he was eventually arrested. Upon his release, he became a leader of a pro-neutrality group. Later, as a vocal Southern Unionist, he spent much of the war in prison.

A meeting was held at Looney&#x27;s Tavern, where a series of resolutions was passed. These stated that the people of Winston County had no desire to take part in the war and intended to support neither side. One resolution declared that if a state could secede from the Union, then a county could secede from the state. Richard Payne, a pro-Confederate, laughed with delight. &quot;Winston County secedes!&quot; he shouted. &quot;Hoorah for the &#x27;Free State of Winston&#x27;!&quot; From Payne&#x27;s remark was born the legend of the &quot;Republic of Winston.&quot; Other areas in the South at the time passed similar resolutions, including Searcy County, Arkansas, and Jones County, Mississippi. The so called &quot;State of Scott&quot; actually passed an official act of session.

Many Winston County residents refused induction into the Confederate Army, and some spoke openly of organizing troops to support the Union. The worried state authorities moved to enforce obedience to the cause through conscription and loyalty oaths, which only made matters worse.

==During the war==
In April 1862, the Union Army invaded northern Alabama. Many of the pro-Union Winston county residents, as well as those from the similarly aligned Nickajack area on the Tennessee border, enlisted in the Union Army&#x27;s new 1st Alabama Cavalry Regiment, commanded by an officer from New York, George E. Spencer. While the 1st Alabama Cavalry would play an important part in the war, it generally did so outside of Alabama.

Between 8,000 and 10,000 deserters from the Confederate Army were sheltered in Winston County during the war.

==Aftermath==
After the war, local politics in Winston County were dominated by the Republican Party.

==Legacy==
Winston&#x27;s unique history has become the basis of a small tourist industry, which includes an outdoor drama loosely based on the events. A prominent local landmark in the county is the &quot;Free state of Winston barn&quot;, a decaying barn with the phrase painted on the sign, located between Haleyville and Double Springs. A passenger boat named the &quot;Free State Lady&quot; plies the waters of the county&#x27;s Smith Lake. The &quot;Dual Destiny&quot; statue located in front of Winston County courthouse in Double Springs depicts a young soldier dressed half as a Union troop and half as Confederate soldier.

<doc id="793978" wikidata="Q7593919" url="?curid=793978" title="St Kilda light rail station">
<text>St Kilda station is a current tram stop and former railway station, located in the Melbourne suburb of St Kilda, Australia, and was the terminus of the St Kilda railway line in the Melbourne suburban rail system. It is one of the oldest surviving railway station buildings in Victoria. The building is currently used as retail premises, while the platform serves as stop 132 on tram route 96.

==History==
The line to St Kilda was built by the Melbourne and Hobson&#x27;s Bay Railway Company, to serve tourists to the seaside resort, with tenders called for earthworks and buildings at St Kilda on 3 November 1856. The line opened on 13 May 1857.

The station building was of restrained Italianate design, with face brickwork and stucco mouldings, and originally featured a semicircular portico on its south-western side. The station had a single platform, with a train shed supported by iron columns trimmed with a timber valence. There was a bluestone retaining wall along Canterbury Road. An engine depot and carriage shed were built in 1856.

In 1859, MHBRC paid St Kilda and Brighton Railway Company £5,000 to build a loop line from St Kilda to Windsor, the line being extended to Brighton Beach by 1861, on what is now the Sandringham line. However, a more direct route from Windsor to the city was built 11 months later by the Melbourne and Suburban Railway Company, and the loop line was dismantled in 1867. In 1878, all the privately operated suburban lines were bought out by the Victorian government and included in the Victorian Railways.

Passenger numbers to the station declined by 23 percent when cable cars started operating to Brighton Road in 1888, and then between Windsor and The Esplanade in 1891, so the Victorian Railways opened their Electric Street Railway to Brighton in 1906. The line was unique, because it was laid in the broad gauge used by the railways in Victoria, rather than the standard gauge used on all other street tramways in the state. The tram terminus was alongside the station building, permitting an easy interchange between modes. Facilities at the station during the days of steam operation included a run around road and traverser, coal stage and engine shed, which remained until at least 1928. An unusual feature of the station was a connection between the railway and tramway tracks, which was used to transfer trams from the Electric Street Railway to the Newport Workshops.

The St Kilda line was electrified in 1919 and, in the 1920s, St Kilda was the second-busiest station in Victoria, after Flinders Street. On 21 October 1928, automatic signals worked by trains were provided at St Kilda, allowing the signal box at the station to be closed when freight trains were not using the yard. The yard was simplified to a platform road and four sidings in 1952, and the last goods service operated on 18 June 1959.

The St Kilda to Brighton Street railway was closed in 1959 and replaced by buses. Passenger facilities were also downgraded, with the railway refreshment rooms closed in 1969, the post office closed in 1972, and the booking hall and ladies waiting room closed in 1976. October 1978 also saw the closure of the station as a depot for train crews, with overnight stabling of trains also ceasing. In the final years of the station, only two sidings remained, and colour light signals replaced semaphores.

==Closure==
In the 1980s, the Cain Labor Government looked at the possibility of closing several lines, or converting them to light rail services, which were perceived to be cheaper to run. After several inquiries, it was decided to close both the St Kilda and Port Melbourne lines, and convert them to light rail. The last train service ran on 31 July 1987, with the light rail officially commissioned on 21 November 1987.

The decision was made to retain the station buildings on the St Kilda line but use them for other purposes. Because it is located on busy Fitzroy Street, the St Kilda station was ideal for commercial use and was sold off. On 4 December 1989, the building was badly damaged by fire, although its structural soundness was not affected. A second fire occurred two days later.

In the late 1990s, developers announced a planned redevelopment of the station site, involving large-scale changes. Despite several protests from the National Trust of Australia and other heritage groups, the development went ahead. The Metropol Apartments were completed in the station forecourt by 2002, with the shops following soon after. The station building was converted into a number of different shops, and the entire platform space was removed. While few aspects of its original function were retained, an old cast iron platform clock remains, as evidence of the building&#x27;s former use.

The station location and platform continue to be used today as stop 132 on the light rail section of tram route 96.

==Tram services==
Yarra Trams operates one route via St Kilda station:
* : East Brunswick – St Kilda Beach

==In popular culture==
Australian rock band Hunters &amp; Collectors filmed the 1982 video clip for &quot;Talking to a Stranger&quot; at the station.

A large portion of the station building was used in the 2004 reality television series &quot;My Restaurant Rules&quot;, as the site of the Melbourne restaurant, &quot;Seven Stones&quot;.

<text>Gargunnock is a small village in the Stirling council area with an active community trust, west of Stirling, in Scotland. The census population was 912. It is situated on the south edge of the Carse of Stirling, at the foot of the Gargunnock Hills, part of the Campsie Fells.

Several small burns flow down from the Gargunnock Hills

The last naturally suitable crossing point on the Forth before reaching Stirling Bridge is situated just outside Gargunnock. This, coupled with the land condition and drainage around the feet of the Gargunnock hills, made Gargunnock the ideal location to build a farming settlement.

During the occupation of Scotland, the English posted a battalion in the Peel tower on the outskirts of the village to protect this important ferry. It is believed that William Wallace brought his army through Gargunnock (called &quot;Gargowans&quot; at the time), setting up fort on the Kier Hill, to take control of this part of the river in advance of the Battle of Stirling Bridge. Bonnie Prince Charlie is also said to have passed through the village on his travels.

==Known for==

Gargunnock House and Estate are focal points of the village dating back to the 16th century. Starting life as a tower house, over the following 200 years wings were added with the final wing completed in 1794. Charles Stirling, the fifth son of an old and distinguished family and who had prospered as a merchant in Glasgow, bought the remodelled Gargunnock in 1835. His great-granddaughter, Miss Viola Stirling, was the last of the family to own and run the estate. On her death in 1989 she left Gargunnock to trustees, with the hope that it could be &#x27;preserved and administered so as to exemplify and perpetuate the tradition of Scottish country life. It is also said that Frédéric Chopin once played at the house as Charles Stirling&#x27;s sister Jane was a pupil of his.

Gargunnock is also the home to the Gargunnock Show, founded in 1794 and hosted annually the show is one of the longest running in Scotland. 

More recently, during the nineteenth century Gargunnock was famous for its fine oak-spale baskets, until intensive deforestation removed the raw materials necessary for this trade and the industry moved to Loch Lomond.

Gargunnock War Memorial was erected in 1919 to a design by Sir Robert Lorimer marking the local people killed during the First World War. Additional names were added at the close of the Second World War.

A railway station, around 1 kilometre from the village, was opened by the Forth and Clyde Junction Railway in 1856 and was closed to passengers in 1934.

The majority of pupils from Gargunnock Primary continue their secondary education at the nearby Stirling High School, with others attending Balfron High School.

On Tuesday, July 6, 2021, the Gargunnock Village Store experienced a fire, leaving it vacant. In December 2023 the village community trust received £150,000 grant from the Scottish Land Fund to buy the shop with hopes to re-open it by September 2024.

In August 2023 the UCI Road World Championships time trials route went through the village with the Gargunnock Inn playing host as an &quot;Official Event Fan Zone&quot;.

<doc id="793990" wikidata="Q5281517" url="?curid=793990" title="Disco Biscuits">
<text>The Disco Biscuits are an American jam band from Philadelphia. The band consists of Allen Aucoin (drums), Marc &quot;Brownie&quot; Brownstein (bass guitar, vocals), Jon &quot;The Barber&quot; Gutwillig (guitar, vocals), and Aron Magner (keyboards, synths, vocals). The band incorporates elements from a variety of musical genres with a base of electronic and rock. Their style has been described as trance fusion.

== History ==
The Disco Biscuits formed in 1995 at the University of Pennsylvania. Brownstein, Gutwillig, Magner, and the original drummer, Sam &quot;Sammy&quot; Altman, bonded over a shared affinity for psychedelic rock, electronic music, soul, blues, jazz and classical music. This eclectic mix of interests helped inspire their distinctive style of live electronic music, which is sometimes called &#x27;trance fusion&#x27;. The term references the band&#x27;s choice to incorporate elements of trance music - specifically the driving, rhythmically repetitive drum beats and melodic sections that repeat and evolve over time - into the instrumentation and conventions of a live jamband where guitar, bass, keyboards, and drums play structured songs with sections for exploratory improvisation. 

The band honed their style while playing at bars and fraternity-house shows in the Philadelphia area in the mid-1990s. Bassist Marc Brownstein credits the improvisational ingenuity demonstrated by the jamband Phish during the 95-97 tours as a particular inspiration for the Disco Biscuits&#x27; unique sound. He recognized that improvisation-inclined bands needed to differentiate their sound in meaningful ways in order to stand out in the underground mid-to-late-1990s live music scene, and the Biscuits members&#x27; interest in electronic music provided an excellent opportunity to explore a unique sound. 

The band received particular acclaim from fans during their 1999 tours for the thoughtful setlist compositions mixed with exploratory improvisation. This era (which has been referred to as &#x27;the nine-nine&#x27; by Disco Biscuits fans) featured energetic musical improvisation that incorporated new musical elements while still remaining enjoyable to more mainstream jamband audiences whose tastes tended to gravitate towards folk-rock and blues. 

The first inklings of what ultimately became trance-fusion emerged during shows played by the band shortly after keyboardist Aron Magner incorporated a Roland JP-8000 into his live setup in late 1997. This analog-modeling synthesizer (which incidentally also features prominently in the popular track Sandstorm by Finnish electronic artist Darude) supplied sounds that lent a distinctly electronic flavor to jams that were in most other ways typical Phish-inspired blues-rock improvisations. The Halloween 1997 set at the Phi Kappa Gamma fraternity house near the University of Pennsylvania campus is unofficially recognized as the first show that incorporated the JP-8000, helping cement the Biscuits&#x27; connection to live, improvised electronic music. 

In 2005 drummer Sammy Altman left the band to pursue a career in medicine. The band began a search for their next drummer ending with a two-night, sold-out drum-off concert at the Borgata&#x27;s Music Box in Atlantic City. In December 2005 Allen Aucoin was announced as the newest member of the band. Aucoin knew members of the Biscuits&#x27; road crew and had opened for the Biscuits with his previous band, Skydog Gypsy, in the past. In 2006 the band purchased the Old City Philadelphia studio space that had previously belonged to DJ Jazzy Jeff. The space became a place for local musicians to congregate and work, culminating in the unique collaborations recorded in recording studio efforts known as the &quot;Planet Anthem&quot; sessions. Around the time &quot;Planet Anthem&quot; was released, the Biscuits also collaborated with noted hip-hop producer Damon Dash working on a variety of projects.

The band has created live, improvised scores to films on numerous occasions throughout their career, including &quot;Akira&quot; in 1999, &quot;Tron&quot; in 2015, &quot;The Fifth Element&quot; in 2023, and &quot;2001 A Space Odyssey&quot; in 2024.

== Camp Bisco ==
The first Camp Bisco took place in August 1999 in Cherrytree Pennsylvania, the band seeking to combine the creative effects of electronic DJs with improvisational rock. Over 17 years Camp Bisco has grown by leaps and bounds, with its lineup expanding to include acts such as Shpongle, Lotus, Pretty Lights, Bassnectar, Gramatik, and STS9. The band celebrated its fifteenth anniversary of the festival during July 2017 on Montage Mountain in Scranton, Pennsylvania.

Camp Bisco was canceled in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The band participated in the drive-in &quot;Pavement Rave&quot; concert series at the same venue as a replacement event. The 2021 festival was also canceled, citing that it could not be organized in time without compromising the experience. Two concert dates in Philadelphia were organized as a replacement, headlined by the band and Lotus.

== Rock operas ==
Brownstein and Gutwillig have each written rock operas. Gutwillig was first, writing the Hot Air Balloon sometime before it debuted on December 31, 1998, at Silk City in Philadelphia. Brownstein wrote the Chemical Warfare Brigade in early 2000 while on hiatus from the band. It debuted at the Trocadero Theater in Philadelphia on August 19, 2000 along with his side project Electron. The Disco Biscuits played the Chemical Warfare Brigade for the first time at the Vanderbilt in Plainview, New York on December 30, 2000. In 2022 the band begun to debut parts of a third opera entitled Revolution in Motion which was released March 29, 2024.

== Philanthropy ==
The Disco Biscuits are involved in a number of charitable efforts including food drives and raising money for hurricane relief. In 2004, Brownstein (along with Andy Bernstein, author of The Pharmer&#x27;s Almanac) founded HeadCount, a national, nonpartisan, non-profit, organization that partners with musicians to promote participation in democracy in the United States by registering voters at concerts. In 2010, the keyboardist Aron Magner was named to the Board of Directors for the Philadelphia Young Playwrights theatre arts program.

<text>The 1949 Canadian federal election was held June 27, 1949, to elect members of the House of Commons of Canada of the 21st Parliament of Canada.

The Liberal Party of Canada was re-elected with its fourth consecutive government, winning 191 seats (73 percent of the seats in the House of Commons), with just under 50 percent of the popular vote.

It was the Liberals&#x27; first election in almost thirty years not under the leadership of William Lyon Mackenzie King. King had retired in 1948, and was replaced as Liberal leader and Prime Minister by Louis St. Laurent.

It was the first federal election with Newfoundland voting, having joined Canada in March of that year. It was also the first election since 1904 in which part of the remaining parts of the Northwest Territories were granted representation, following the partitioning off of the provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan.

The Liberal Party victory won the largest majority in Canadian history to that point. , it remains the third largest majority government in Canadian history, and the largest in the party&#x27;s history (the Progressive Conservative Party won larger seat majorities in 1958 and 1984).

The Progressive Conservative Party, led by former Premier of Ontario George Drew, gained little ground in this election. The party lost over a third of their seats.

Smaller parties, such as the social democratic Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, and Social Credit, a party that advocated monetary reform, lost support to the Liberals and, to a lesser extent, the Conservatives.

<text>A Little Manila ( or ), also known as a Manilatown () or Filipinotown (), is a community with a large Filipino immigrant and descendant population. Little Manilas are enclaves of Overseas Filipinos consisting of people of Filipino origin living outside of the Philippines.

This term applies to Filipinos who are both abroad indefinitely as citizens or permanent residents of a different country, and to those Filipino citizens abroad for a limited, definite period, such as on a work contract or as students. It can also include seamen and others who work outside the Philippines, but are neither permanent nor temporary residents of another country.

==Characteristics==

===Filipino markets and Businesses===

According to Rick Bonus, author of &quot;Locating Filipino Americans: Ethnicity and the Cultural Politics of Space&quot;, &quot;...Filipinos only deal with Filipinos.&quot; The author meant that Filipino society is very &quot;tightly bound&quot; and tends to only purchase Filipino products only from known Filipino grocery stores, even though the same products may be available at more mainstream retailers.

===Filipino restaurants===
Many Filipinos who grow up in a Filipino enclave experience a yearning for Filipino food. For example, one author stated that &quot;... my stomach was trained at an early age to love Filipino food. I ate tocino (sweet pork) and longanisa (sweet sausage) for breakfast, and had adobo, pancit, and beef caldereta for dinner... White kids... would make faces at my food and ask what I was eating.&quot;

==Locations==
===Australia===
====Sydney====
There are about 85,000 Filipino-Australians in the area controlled by Blacktown City Council. Philippine-born residents comprise 5.9% of the population in the City of Blacktown and are the largest directly born ethnic group in Blacktown. More than fifty percent of Filipino-Australians are based in New South Wales.

Filipino food shops exist around Blacktown railway station.

====Melbourne====
&quot;... in different areas of Metropolitan Melbourne, with the greatest number settling down in the western suburbs.&quot; Filipinos in Victoria, a website from Vicnet, a division of the State Library of Victoria.

===Canada===
====Manitoba====
=====Winnipeg=====
Winnipeg is home to 56,400 Filipinos, making them the third largest Filipino community in Canada by total population, however the largest by percentage (8.7%). The Filipino community in Winnipeg is the largest visible minority group in Winnipeg ahead of the Chinese-Canadians and Indo-Canadians (but excluding aboriginal Canadians, who are not counted as a &quot;visible minority&quot; by Statistics Canada). Winnipeg is home to the more established Filipino community in Canada with mass migration beginning in the 1950s.

<doc id="794008" wikidata="Q1162694" url="?curid=794008" title="Dry eye syndrome">
<text>Dry eye syndrome, also known as keratoconjunctivitis sicca, is the condition of having dry eyes. Symptoms include dryness in the eye, irritation, redness, discharge, blurred vision, and easily fatigued eyes. Symptoms range from mild and occasional to severe and continuous. Dry eye syndrome can lead to blurred vision, instability of the tear film, increased risk of damage to the ocular surface such as scarring of the cornea, and changes in the eye including the neurosensory system.
Dry eye occurs when either the eye does not produce enough tears or when the tears evaporate too quickly. This can be caused by age, contact lens use, meibomian gland dysfunction, pregnancy, Sjögren syndrome, vitamin A deficiency, omega-3 fatty acid deficiency, LASIK surgery, and certain medications such as antihistamines, some blood pressure medication, hormone replacement therapy, and antidepressants. Chronic conjunctivitis such as from tobacco smoke exposure or infection may also lead to the condition. Diagnosis is mostly based on the symptoms, though several other tests may be used. Dry eye syndrome occasionally makes wearing contact lenses impossible.
Treatment depends on the underlying cause. Artificial tears are usually the first line of treatment. Wrap-around glasses that fit close to the face may decrease tear evaporation. Looking carefully at the medications a person is taking and, if safe, altering the medications, may also improve symptoms if these medications are the cause. Some topical medications, or eye drops, may be suggested to help treat the condition. The immunosuppressant cyclosporine (ciclosporin) may be recommended to increase tear production and, for short-term use, topical corticosteroid medications are also sometimes helpful to reduce inflammation. Another treatment that is sometimes suggested is lacrimal plugs that prevent tears from draining from the surface of the eye.
Dry eye syndrome is a common eye disease. It affects 5–34% of people to some degree depending on the population looked at. Among older people it affects up to 70%. In China it affects about 17% of people. The phrase &quot;keratoconjunctivitis sicca&quot; means &quot;dryness of the cornea and conjunctiva&quot; in Latin.
==Signs and symptoms==
Typical symptoms of dry eye syndrome are dryness, burning and a sandy-gritty eye irritation that gets worse as the day goes on. Symptoms may also be described as itchy, stinging or tired eyes. Other symptoms are pain, redness, a pulling sensation, and pressure behind the eye. There may be a feeling that something, such as a speck of dirt, is in the eye. The resultant damage to the eye&#x27;s surface increases discomfort and sensitivity to bright light. Both eyes usually are affected.

There may also be a stringy discharge from the eyes. Although it may seem contradictory, dry eye can cause the eyes to water due to irritation. One may experience excessive tearing such as if something got into the eye. These reflex tears will not necessarily make the eyes feel better since they are the watery tears that are produced in response to injury, irritation, or emotion which lack the lubricating qualities necessary to prevent dry eye.

Because blinking coats the eye with tears, symptoms are worsened by activities in which the rate of blinking is reduced due to prolonged use of the eyes. These activities include prolonged reading, computer usage (computer vision syndrome), driving, or watching television. Symptoms increase in windy, dusty, or smoky (including cigarette smoke) areas, in dry environments with high altitudes including airplanes, on days with low humidity, and in areas where an air conditioner (especially in a car), fan, heater, or even a hair dryer is being used. Symptoms reduce during cool, rainy, or foggy weather and in humid places, such as in the shower.

Most people who have dry eyes experience mild irritation with no long-term effects. However, if the condition is left untreated or becomes severe, it can produce complications that can cause eye damage, instability of the tear film, neurosensory changes, impaired vision, or (rarely) in the loss of vision.

==Causes==
Any abnormality of any one of the three layers of tears produces an unstable tear film, resulting in symptoms of dry eyes.

===Increased evaporation===
The most common cause of dry eye is increased evaporation of the tear film, typically as a result of meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD). The meibomian glands are two sets of oil glands that line the upper and lower eyelids and secrete the oily outer layer of the tear film—the lipid layer. These glands often become clogged due to inflammation caused by blepharitis and/or rosacea, preventing an even distribution of oil. The result is an unstable lipid layer that leads to increased evaporation of the tear film.

In severe cases of MGD, the meibomian glands can atrophy and cease producing oil entirely.

===Low humidity===
Low humidity may cause dry eye syndrome.

===Decreased tear production===
Keratoconjunctivitis sicca can be caused by inadequate tear production from lacrimal hyposecretion. The aqueous tear layer is affected, resulting in aqueous tear deficiency (ATD). The lacrimal gland does not produce sufficient tears to keep the entire conjunctiva and cornea covered by a complete layer. This usually occurs in people who are otherwise healthy. Increased age is associated with decreased tearing. This is the most common type found in postmenopausal women.

In many cases, aqueous deficient dry eye may have no apparent cause (idiopathic). Other causes include congenital alacrima, xerophthalmia, lacrimal gland ablation, and sensory denervation. In rare cases, it may be a symptom of collagen vascular diseases, including relapsing polychondritis, rheumatoid arthritis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, and systemic lupus erythematosus. Sjögren syndrome and other autoimmune diseases are associated with aqueous tear deficiency. Drugs such as isotretinoin, sedatives, diuretics, tricyclic antidepressants, antihypertensives, oral contraceptives, antihistamines, nasal decongestants, beta-blockers, phenothiazines, atropine, and pain relieving opiates such as morphine can cause or worsen this condition. Infiltration of the lacrimal glands by sarcoidosis or tumors, or post-radiation fibrosis of the lacrimal glands can also cause this condition. Recent attention has been paid to the composition of tears in normal or dry-eye individuals. Only a small fraction of the estimated 1543 proteins in tears are differentially deficient or upregulated in dry eye, one of which is lacritin. Topical lacritin promotes tearing in rabbit preclinical studies. Also, topical treatment of eyes of dry eye mice (Aire knockout mouse model of dry eye) restored tearing, and suppressed both corneal staining and the size of inflammatory foci in lacrimal glands.

===Additional causes===

Excess screen time on computers, smartphones, tablets, or other digital devices can cause dry eye. &quot;Humans normally blink about 15 times in one minute. However, studies show that we only blink about 5 to 7 times in a minute while using computers and other digital screen devices. Blinking is the eye&#x27;s way of getting the moisture it needs on its surface.&quot;

Aging is one of the most common causes of dry eyes because tear production decreases with age. Several classes of medications (both prescription and OTC) have been hypothesized as a major cause of dry eye, especially in the elderly. Particularly, anticholinergic medications that also cause dry mouth are believed to promote dry eye. Dry eye may also be caused by thermal or chemical burns, or (in epidemic cases) by adenoviruses. A number of studies have found that people with diabetes have an increased risk for the condition.

About half of all people who wear contact lenses complain of dry eyes. There are two potential connections between contact usage and dry eye. Traditionally, it was believed that soft contact lenses, which float on the tear film that covers the cornea, absorb the tears in the eyes. The connection between a loss in nerve sensitivity and tear production is also the subject of current research.

Dry eye also occurs or becomes worse after LASIK and other refractive surgeries, in which the corneal nerves that stimulate tear secretion are cut during the creation of a corneal flap. Dry eye caused by these procedures usually resolves after several months, but it can be permanent. Persons who are thinking about refractive surgery should consider this.

An eye injury or other problem with the eyes or eyelids, such as bulging eyes or a drooping eyelid can cause keratoconjunctivitis sicca. Eyelid disorders can impair the complex blinking motion to spread tears.

Abnormalities of the mucin tear layer caused by vitamin A deficiency, trachoma, diphtheric keratoconjunctivitis, mucocutaneous disorders, and certain topical medications are also causes of keratoconjunctivitis sicca.

Persons with keratoconjunctivitis sicca have elevated levels of tear nerve growth factor (NGF). The eye&#x27;s surface NGF may play an important role in ocular surface inflammation associated with dry eyes.

==Pathophysiology==
Having dry eyes for a while can lead to tiny abrasions on the surface of the eyes. In advanced cases, the epithelium undergoes pathologic changes, namely squamous metaplasia and loss of goblet cells. Some severe cases result in thickening of the corneal surface, corneal erosion, punctate keratopathy, epithelial defects, corneal ulceration (sterile and infected), corneal neovascularization, corneal scarring, corneal thinning, and even corneal perforation.

Another contributing factor may be lacritin monomer deficiency. Lacritin monomer, the active form of lacritin, is selectively decreased in aqueous deficient dry eye, Sjögren syndrome dry eye, contact lens-related dry eye, and in blepharitis. The ocular surface microbiome, composed of a diverse community of microorganisms, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of dry eye syndrome, potentially influencing ocular surface inflammation and homeostasis.

==Diagnosis==
Symptom assessment is a key component of dry eye diagnosis – to the extent that many believe dry eye syndrome to be a symptom-based disease. Several questionnaires have been developed to determine a score that would allow for a diagnosis. The McMonnies &amp; Ho dry eye questionnaire is often used in clinical studies of dry eyes.

Some tests allow patients to be classified into one of two categories, &quot;aqueous-deficient&quot; or &quot;hyperevaporative&quot;. Diagnostic guidelines were published in 2007 by the Dry Eye Workshop, updated by the Dry Eye Workshop II in 2017. A slit lamp examination can be performed to diagnose dry eyes and to document any damage to the eye. When realizing this test, the practitioner is testing the eyelid margin.

A Schirmer&#x27;s test can measure the amount of moisture bathing the eye. This test is useful for determining the severity of the condition. A five-minute Schirmer&#x27;s test with and without anesthesia using a Whatman #41 filter paper 5 mm wide by 35 mm long is performed. For this test, wetting under 5 mm with or without anesthesia is considered diagnostic for dry eyes.

If the results for the Schirmer&#x27;s test are abnormal, a Schirmer II test can be performed to measure reflex secretion. In this test, the nasal mucosa is irritated with a cotton-tipped applicator, after which tear production is measured with a Whatman #41 filter paper. For this test, wetting under 15 mm after five minutes is considered abnormal.

A tear breakup time (TBUT) test measures the time it takes for tears to break up in the eye. The tear breakup time can be determined after placing a drop of fluorescein in the cul-de-sac.

A tear protein analysis test measures the lysozyme contained within tears. In tears, lysozyme accounts for approximately 20 to 40 percent of total protein content.

A lactoferrin analysis test provides good correlation with other tests.

The presence of the recently described molecule Ap4A, naturally occurring in tears, is abnormally high in different states of ocular dryness. This molecule can be quantified biochemically simply by taking a tear sample with a plain Schirmer test. Utilizing this technique it is possible to determine the concentrations of Ap4A in the tears of patients and in such a way diagnose objectively if the samples are indicative of dry eye.

The tear osmolarity test has been proposed as a test for dry eye disease. Tear osmolarity may be a more sensitive method of diagnosing and grading the severity of dry eye compared to corneal and conjunctival staining, tear break-up time, Schirmer test, and meibomian gland grading. Others have recently questioned the utility of tear osmolarity in monitoring dry eye treatment.

==Prevention==
Avoiding refractive surgery (LASIK and PRK), limiting contact lens use, limiting computer screen use, and avoiding environmental conditions can decrease symptoms. Complications can be prevented by use of wetting and lubricating drops and ointments.

==Treatment==
A variety of approaches can be taken to treat dry eye syndrome. Approaches include: avoidance of exacerbating factors (things that make it worse), tear stimulation and supplementation, increasing tear retention, eyelid cleansing, and treatment of eye inflammation.

Conditions such as blepharitis can often co-exist and paying particular attention to cleaning the eyelids morning and night with mild soaps and warm compresses can improve both conditions.

===Avoiding exacerbating factors and environmental control===
Dry eyes can be worsened by smoky environments, dust, and indoor air conditioning, and by our natural tendency to reduce our blink rate when concentrating. Purposefully blinking, especially during computer use, and resting tired eyes are basic steps that can be taken to minimise discomfort. Rubbing one&#x27;s eyes can irritate them further, so should be avoided. Dry, drafty environments and those with smoke and dust should be avoided. This includes avoiding hair dryers, heaters, air conditioners, or fans, especially when these devices are directed toward the eyes. Wearing glasses or directing gaze downward, for example, by lowering computer screens can be helpful to protect the eyes when aggravating environmental factors cannot be avoided. Using a humidifier, especially in the winter, can help by adding moisture to the dry indoor air.

===Tear stimulation and supplementation===
For mild and moderate cases, supplemental lubrication is the most important part of treatment. Application of artificial tears is sometimes suggested every few hours and may provide temporary relief. Most artificial tear fluids contain mucoadhesive polymers such as hyaluronic acid, cellulose derivatives or polyvinyl alcohol as lubricants. These polymers remain for a prolonged period of time on the ocular surface binding high amounts of water. By the covalent attachment of thiol groups to such polymers, their ocular residence time can be even improved, as thiolated polymers (thiomers) form disulfide bonds with cysteine-rich subdomains of mucus glycoproteins on the ocular surface. Chitosan-N-acetylcysteine containing eye drops showed a significant reduction in symptoms of dry eye syndrome. There are many different types of artificial tear on the market, however, there is no strong evidence to suggest that certain artificial tear formulations are superior to others in treating dry eye.

==== Autologous serum eye drops ====
Eye drops that include autologous serum (serum taken from the same person&#x27;s blood and used in an eye drop formulation) are sometimes suggested to help supplement natural tears. The composition of serum has similarities to natural tears and may mimic natural tears. Evidence supporting this approach shows that autologous serum may be superior to artificial tears at relieving symptoms in the short-term, however, there is no strong evidence that autologous serum eye drops are better than artificial tears or saline solution for long-term symptom relief.

====Additional options====
Lubricating tear ointments can be used during the day, but they generally are used at bedtime due to poor vision after application. They contain white petrolatum, mineral oil, and similar lubricants. They serve as a lubricant and an emollient. Application requires pulling down the lower eyelid and applying a small amount (0.25 in) inside. Depending on the severity of the condition, it may be applied from every hour to just at bedtime. It should never be used with contact lenses. Specially designed glasses that form a moisture chamber around the eye may be used to create additional humidity.

===Medication===
Inflammation occurring in response to tears film hypertonicity can be suppressed by mild topical corticosteroids or with topical immunosuppressants such as ciclosporin (Restasis, Vevye). Elevated levels of tear NGF can be decreased with 0.1% prednisolone.

==== Topical corticosteroids ====
Topical corticosteroids are commonly prescribed for those whose dry eye syndrome symptoms may be caused by inflammation and may lead to a small to moderate improvement in dry-eye symptoms when compared to lubricants or artificial tear drop treatment alone. It is not clear if topical corticosteroid treatment leads to an improvement in the quality of the tear film or the quantity of natural tears. There are also risks to consider with long-term use of topical corticosteroid treatment including an increased risk of ocular hypertension, risk of cataract development, and increased risk of eye infections. For people who may benefit from topical corticosteroid treatment for dry eye syndrome, the ideal treatment regime, formulation of the topical preparations, and balance between potential risks of this medication is unclear.

====Ciclosporin (cyclosporin)====
Topical ciclosporin (topical ciclosporin A, tCSA) 0.05% ophthalmic emulsion is an immunosuppressant that is commonly used to treat symptoms of dry eye syndrome. The drug decreases surface inflammation to increase tear production. Some people find relief and report increased tear production, however, evidence of effectiveness from clinical trials is not strong and although some people may find relief, effectiveness may be inconsistent in different people. Ciclosporin A treatment also comes with risks of adverse effects that are generally not serious but include a burning sensation. Ciclosporin should not be used while wearing contact lenses, during eye infections or in people with a history of herpes virus infections. Side effects include burning sensation (common), redness, discharge, watery eyes, eye pain, foreign body sensation, itching, stinging, and blurred vision. Long-term use of ciclosporin at high doses is associated with an increased risk of cancer. Cheaper generic alternatives are available in some countries.

==== Other medications ====
Diquafosol, an agonist of the P2Y2 purinergic receptor, is approved in Japan for managing dry eye disease by promoting the secretion of fluid and mucin from cells in the conjunctiva, rather than by directly stimulating the lacrimal glands.

Lifitegrast was approved by the US FDA for the treatment of the condition in 2016.

Varenicline (Tyrvaya by Oyster Point Pharma) was approved by the US FDA for the treatment of dry eye disease in October 2021.

Oral n-acetylcysteine (NAC), hyaluronic acid and/or rebamipide-based eye drops may also be effective for dry eyes.

Perfluorohexyloctane (Miebo) was approved for medical use in the United States in May 2023.

===Conserving tears===
There are methods that allow both natural and artificial tears to stay longer.

In each eye, there are two puncta – little openings that drain tears into the tear ducts. There are methods to partially or completely close the tear ducts. This blocks the flow of tears into the nose, and thus more tears are available to the eyes. Drainage into either one or both puncta in each eye can be blocked.

Punctal plugs are inserted into the puncta to block tear drainage. It is not clear if punctal plugs are effective at reducing dry eye syndrome symptoms. Punctal plugs are thought to be &quot;relatively safe&quot;, however, their use may result in epiphora (watery eyes), and more rarely, serious infection and swelling of the tear sac where the tears drain. They are reserved for people with moderate or severe dry eye when other medical treatment has not been adequate.

If punctal plugs are effective, thermal or electric cauterization of puncti can be performed. In thermal cauterization, a local anesthetic is used, and then a hot wire is applied. This shrinks the drainage area tissues and causes scarring, which closes the tear duct.

===Other===
There is evidence that long‐chain omega‐3 supplementation may be helpful, however, probiotics, fish- flax- and hemp-oil (omega-3) supplements do not appear to be effective in relieving symptoms.

===Surgery===
In severe cases of dry eyes, tarsorrhaphy may be performed where the eyelids are partially sewn together. This reduces the palpebral fissure (eyelid separation), ideally leading to a reduction in tear evaporation.

==Prognosis==
Keratoconjunctivitis sicca usually is a chronic problem. Its prognosis shows considerable variance, depending upon the severity of the condition. Most people have mild-to-moderate cases, and can be treated symptomatically with lubricants. This provides an adequate relief of symptoms.

When dry eye symptoms are severe, they can interfere with quality of life. People sometimes feel their vision blurs with use, or severe irritation to the point that they have trouble keeping their eyes open or they may not be able to work or drive.

==Epidemiology==
Keratoconjunctivitis sicca is relatively common within the United States, especially in patients aged 40 or older. 10–20% of adults experience Keratoconjunctivitis sicca. Approximately 1 to 4 million adults (age 65–84) in the US are affected.

While persons with autoimmune diseases have a high likelihood of having dry eyes, most persons with dry eyes do not have an autoimmune disease. Instances of Sjögren syndrome and keratoconjunctivitis sicca associated with it are present much more commonly in women, with a ratio of 9:1. In addition, milder forms of keratoconjunctivitis sicca also are more common in women. This is partly because hormonal changes, such as those that occur in pregnancy, menstruation, and menopause, can decrease tear production.

In areas of the world where malnutrition is common, vitamin A deficiency is a common cause. This is rare in the United States.

Racial predilections do not exist for this disease.

A study based on 274 answers using the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) from medical school students aged between 20 and 25 years old found a prevalence of dry eye symptoms of 83.6%.

== Research ==
New treatment options are under development. Heating systems that try to unblock the oil glands in the eye have some preliminary evidence of benefit.

==Synonyms==
Other names for dry eye include dry eye syndrome, keratoconjunctivitis sicca, dysfunctional tear syndrome, lacrimal keratoconjunctivitis, evaporative tear deficiency, aqueous tear deficiency, and LASIK-induced neurotrophic epitheliopathy.

==Veterinary uses==
Among other animals, dry eye can occur in dogs, cats, and horses.

===Dogs===
Keratoconjunctivitis sicca is common in dogs. Most cases are caused by a genetic predisposition, but chronic conjunctivitis, canine distemper, and drugs such as sulfasalazine and trimethoprim-sulfonamide also cause the disease. Symptoms include eye redness, a yellow or greenish discharge, corneal ulceration, pigmented cornea, and blood vessels on the cornea. Diagnosis is made by measuring tear production with a Schirmer tear test. Less than 15 mm of wetting by tears produced in a minute is abnormal.

Tear replacers are a mainstay of treatment, preferably containing methylcellulose or carboxymethyl cellulose. Ciclosporin stimulates tear production and acts as a suppressant on the immune-mediated processes that cause the disease. Topical antibiotics and corticosteroids are sometimes used to treat secondary infections and inflammation. A surgery known as parotid duct transposition is used in some extreme cases where medical treatment has not helped. This redirects the duct from the parotid salivary gland to the eye. Saliva replaces the tears. Dogs with cherry eye should have the condition corrected to help prevent this disease.

Breeds with a higher risk of dry eye compared to other breeds include:
* American Cocker Spaniel
* Bloodhound
* Boston Terrier
* English Bulldog
* Cavalier King Charles Spaniel
* Lhasa Apso
* Miniature Schnauzer
* Pekingese
* Pug
* Samoyed
* Shih Tzu
* West Highland White Terrier

===Cats===
Keratoconjunctivitis sicca is uncommon in cats. Most cases seem to be caused by chronic conjunctivitis, especially secondary to feline herpesvirus. Diagnosis, symptoms, and treatment are similar to those for dogs.

<text>Empire Airlines is a cargo and former passenger airline based in Hayden, Idaho, near Coeur d&#x27;Alene. It operates over 120 scheduled cargo flights a day in 18 US states and Canada. Empire also operated passenger service within Hawaii, under the name &quot;Ohana by Hawaiian&quot;, between 2014 and 2021 in partnership with Hawaiian Airlines. Its main base is Coeur d&#x27;Alene Airport with a hub at Spokane International Airport. The company slogan is &quot;We Can Do That.&quot;

== History ==
Empire Airlines was established and started operations in May 1977 in Orofino as a charter company. Originally named Clearwater Flying Service (thus the CFS identifier for its flights), it was purchased by Nick Chenoweth and Vick Walters on April 12. Soon thereafter, a third partner, Mel Spelde joined as a flight instructor. Clearwater Flying Service made a living doing several different things including, fire patrol, transporting outfitters into the backcountry, air ambulance, air pollution monitoring, charters and flight instruction.
On November 1, 1980, Empire Airlines purchased West Aire, Inc. at Coeur d&#x27;Alene and expanded business to include aircraft sales and maintenance. In 1981 Empire purchased Executive Aviation in Missoula, Montana, and leased Twin Otter aircraft for United States Forest Service smoke jumping contracts. In December 1983 and January 1984, Empire was awarded government contracts to transport people and materiel in Grenada, following the conflict. In the mid-1980s, Empire received contracts from several places including, a Colorado ski destination, Hughes Aircraft, and Naval Arctic Research Laboratory. In 1988 Empire signed a FedEx Express contract to fly and maintain Cessna 208 Caravan aircraft out of Portland and Spokane; Seattle was added in September. In 1989 Empire became a FAR 121 operator after the purchase of Pacific Alaska Airlines and two Fairchild F-27 aircraft. In August Empire started F27 services for FedEx Express.

In 1990, Empire added more cargo routes and performed its first heavy maintenance check on a Fairchild F-27. By 1992, the airline was operating British Aerospace BAe 146-200 jet aircraft on contract charter flights for Silverwing Holidays from Bellingham, WA and Spokane to Los Angeles, Palm Springs, Phoenix and Reno. In 1993, Empire became a sustaining member of CASE (Coordinating Agency for Supplier Evaluation). From October 1993 to May 1994, it operated Fokker F27-500 aircraft in Hawaii on behalf of Mahalo Air, while the latter airline was awaiting its own operating certificate. In 1995, Empire moved corporate offices and ended passenger services, focusing on cargo, maintenance and airline startups. Empire began sending technical reps to Conair during heavy maintenance checks on Fokker F27 Friendships. In 1998, Empire started flying and maintaining Short 360 aircraft. Empire entered into a partnership agreement to begin Express Air serving FedEx in Europe.

In 2001, Empire received a Repair Station certificate. In 2002, Empire purchased Reliant Logistics as a wholly owned subsidiary. In 2003, The first ATR 42 aircraft arrived in Spokane for cargo conversion. In 2004, the first ATR 42 put on Empire&#x27;s certificate made the first ATR FedEx Feeder revenue flight. In 2005, Empire moved into new hangar and office building, in Hayden, Idaho, adjacent to the Coeur d&#x27;Alene airport (COE). In 2013, Empire Airlines began drone flights under the name &quot;Empire Unmanned&quot;, mainly serving agriculture and mining industries in the Western U.S.

On December 31, 2021, Empire Airlines acquired fellow FedEx feeder West Air, expanding its footprint to include all of California.

== &#x27;Ohana by Hawaiian service ==
In December 2012, it was announced that Empire would begin operating three ATR 42-500 series propjet aircraft acquired by Hawaiian Airlines on routes within the state of Hawaii. &#x27;Ohana by Hawaiian launched initial service to Molokai Airport (MKK) on March 11, 2014, and Lana&#x27;i Airport on March 18, 2014.

In 2015, Hawaiian Airlines announced a new all-cargo freighter service to be operated by Empire with ATR 72 turboprop aircraft on interisland routes in Hawaii

Hawaiian Airlines suspended all &#x27;Ohana by Hawaiian service on January 14, 2021, during the COVID-19 pandemic.

On May 27, 2021, Hawaiian announced that it would discontinue the ʻOhana by Hawaiian brand and its cargo and passenger services after the pandemic and resulting quarantine significantly impacted interisland travel. The interruptions in service forced the airline to reconsider the viability of operation and determine it was no longer feasible. The carrier&#x27;s ATR fleet would be moved to the mainland and be prepared for sale.

== Previous passenger service ==

Empire operated scheduled passenger flights during the early 1990s in the Pacific Northwest with Fairchild F-27 and Fairchild Swearingen Metroliner &quot;Metro II&quot; turboprop aircraft. In 1993, the airline was serving Boise, ID (BOI), Coeur d&#x27;Alene, ID (COE), Lewiston, ID (LWS), Olympia, WA (OLM) and Spokane, WA (GEG). Empire previously served Seattle (SEA) as well.

Initial scheduled service was between Boise and Coeur d&#x27;Alene, ID utilizing Cessna 441 Conquest II turboprop aircraft. Lewiston, ID was added as an enroute stop later; then the Swearingen Metro II came along.

In May 1993, Empire&#x27;s network included Boise, Lewiston, and Coeur d&#x27;Alene, ID; Portland and Astoria, OR; and Spokane, Pasco, Olympia, Seattle, and Hoquiam, WA. This was the third time Seattle had been served. Prior to the Metro propjets being introduced and new service to Lewiston, Empire had served Seattle and Missoula with the Cessna Conquest turboprop from Coeur d&#x27;Alene.

== Fleet ==
As of July 2024, the Empire Airlines fleet includes the following aircraft:

=== Previously operated ===
Empire Air formerly operated the following aircraft:

* ATR 42-300F
* British Aerospace BAe 146-200 - &quot;only jet aircraft type operated by the airline&quot;
* Cessna 441 Conquest II
* de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter
* Fairchild F-27
* Fairchild Swearingen Metroliner &quot;Metro II&quot;
* Fokker F27 Friendship (series -500 and -600 aircraft operated for FedEx in cargo operations and series -500 aircraft for Mahalo Air in scheduled passenger operations)
* Short 360

==Accidents and incidents==
* January 5, 1982: Empire Airlines Flight 141, Piper PA-31, a scheduled commuter fight between Utica, New York, and Washington, D.C., crashed while attempting an approach to Tompkins County Airport, Ithaca, New York, an en route stop. The flight crew contacted Elmira approach control and had received instructions for an instrument landing system (ILS) approach to runway 32 at Tompkins County Airport. The copilot declared an emergency stating that the airplane had a landing flap problem; he later stated that only one flap was down. He also stated that they were not able to maintain altitude and that the airplane was descending. The last radio transmission was recorded five minutes later. The airplane crashed in a wooded area near three suburban residences. The pilot and copilot, the only persons aboard, were killed. There were no injuries to personnel on the ground. The airplane was destroyed by impact and postimpact fire. The National Transportation Safety Board determined that the probable cause of the accident was excessive wear of the left flap motor/flexible drive spline and certification of the airplane with a flap system that did not meet the requirements of Civil Air Regulation 3.339. The worn spline caused a split flap condition of 34° that resulted in marginal flight control authority. Moderate low altitude turbulence and transient low level wind shear may have contributed to the upset and loss of control.
* January 11, 1995: A Cessna 208 Caravan leased by FedEx Express and flying a cargo flight from Flagstaff to Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport crashed about 1.3 miles SSE of Flagstaff Pulliam Airport. While returning to the airport, the &quot;fuel selector off&quot; warning horn was heard. The pilot was killed. The cause of the crash was determined to be the pilot&#x27;s failure to properly configure the fuel system prior to takeoff.
* October 9, 2000: Flight 665, a Cessna 208 Caravan on a VFR cargo flight from Bellingham to Orcas Island crashed on Lummi Island. The pilot onboard was killed. The cause of the crash was determined to be the pilot flying into adverse weather and not maintaining proper terrain clearance.

* December 24, 2005: An Empire Airlines Cessna 208B Caravan on a VFR cargo flight from Portland, Oregon to Roseburg, Oregon crashed shortly after takeoff in a golf course south of the Portland International Airport at 7:43 AM PT. The cause of the crash was determined to be a partial loss of engine power for an undetermined reason during the initial takeoff climb resulting in an in-flight collision with objects.
* On 27 January 2009, Flight 8284, an ATR-42-320 cargo plane under contract from FedEx Express crashed on landing at Lubbock Preston Smith International Airport at 04:37 CT.

<text>Battlezone is a first-person shooter real-time strategy video game, developed and published by Activision. It was released for Microsoft Windows in 1998. Aside from the name and presence of tanks, this game bears little resemblance to the original arcade game of the same name. The game is a combination of a tank simulation game, a first-person shooter and a real-time strategy game.

Two expansion packs were released in 1998, &quot;Battlegrounds&quot; and &quot;The Red Odyssey&quot;. In 2000, a Nintendo 64 port was released under the name Battlezone: Rise of the Black Dogs. In 2016, a remastered version titled Battlezone 98 Redux was released developed by Big Boat Interactive and published by Rebellion Developments. A sequel, &quot;Battlezone II: Combat Commander&quot;, was released in 1999.

== Gameplay==
The primary resource in &quot;Battlezone&quot; is bio-metal scrap which is used to produce new units and construct new buildings. Building and directing units is done via interface either by selecting onscreen object with the mouse or by using number keys on the keyboard. Starting with a bio-metal recycler (the most basic construction unit), the player constructs vehicles to scavenge scraps of bio-metal, build base defenses, and construct new base vehicles capable of building more advanced structures and vehicles.

Players can acquire bio-metal scrap by either finding it or salvaging it from a destroyed enemy unit. When a ship is destroyed, the pilot ejects and thus becomes vulnerable to being killed, but can escape by boarding any friendly vehicle.

===Multiplayer ===
&quot;Battlezone&quot; has a multiplayer feature that consists of three modes: Strategy, DeathMatch and Sniper. Strategy involves two or more players who compete in either as a player vs player, or playing in teams against one another, skirmishing for scrap collection and eventual map domination. Strategy offers the same type of control as in the single-player game. The Strategy game ends when the opposing force lives are reduced to zero. In DeathMatch two or more players battle until the opposing vehicle is destroyed. Once destroyed, the pilot is ejected and floats back to the ground with the user&#x27;s vehicle being respawned for continued play. The game ends for each player as the player quit the game and only for the player quitting the game. Sniper game play consists of two or more players participating against each other in a &quot;Deathmatch&quot; style face off with their rifles. When a sniper is killed, he (depending on map) will spawn at his original spawn point, or another spawn point on the map.

Online gaming used to be available at Activision&#x27;s servers through Anet, a peer-to-peer networking system which features a chat lobby and a list of games in progress. A player can select a game to join and then connect to the host&#x27;s computer.

== Plot ==
&quot;Battlezone&quot; is set during the turn of the 1970s with an alternative history plot, in which the Space Race is used to cover up the deployment of the United States and Soviet militaries into space. Both sides have used scraps of extraterrestrial &quot;bio-metal&quot;, which have fallen to Earth as meteors, to build vehicles with amazing properties such as hover capability. Both nations deploy into space and are fighting across the Solar System to control other deposits of the bio-metal. Gameplay is divided up into two campaigns; one following the American National Space Defense Force (NSDF), the other with the Soviet Cosmos Colonist Army (CCA, also referred to as the Communist Cosmonaut Army in early game manuals).

The American campaign starts on the Luna, but the NSDF is forced off after the destruction of their main base. They relocate to Mars, but find the Soviets already there. Both sides locate alien artifacts, and the Americans also find a factory; the long-dead alien race that created the bio-metal is identified as the Cthonians, who inhabited the planet Icarus (now the asteroid belt) and visited Earth on several occasions, influencing Greek mythology. The Americans learn of an ultimate weapon called the &quot;Fury&quot; and head to Venus to learn more about it. Another Cthonian relic is recovered, pointing to Jupiter&#x27;s moon Io. The NSDF finds a third relic, but this is stolen by a scientist defecting to the Soviets. The player must steal a Soviet fighter craft and tap into the communications network, which reveals the CCA relocation to their main base on Saturn&#x27;s moon Titan. The Americans clear nearby Europa of CCA units to prevent early warning to those on Titan, but the main assault is annihilated, as the Soviets have begun to manufacture Fury vehicles. The Furies then turn on the Soviets; they are self-aware and programmed to destroy all life. Icarus was destroyed by the Cthonians to prevent the Furies from reaching Earth. The NSDF and CCA ally against the new threat, and after destroying the production factory on Titan, travel to the fictional moon of Achilles, orbiting Uranus. The Americans destroy the main Fury base, but this causes the moon&#x27;s core to destabilise, and the player must destroy the Furies&#x27; evacuation vessel before it escapes, then escape themselves.

The Soviet campaign follows the same basic storyline, but from the CCA&#x27;s perspective. Starting on Venus, the Soviets are hounded off the planet by an NSDF unit called the &quot;Black Dogs&quot;. They travel to Io to capture one of the Fury relics, but after the Black Dogs destroy their main base, are forced to regroup and reestablish a foothold. Once this is achieved, the production of Fury units begins, and the CCA uses them to wipe out the Black Dogs in the final mission, just before the Furies turn on them. The Soviet campaign is the shorter of the two, as the NSDF missions were intended as the main game. However, the CCA missions are meant to be more difficult, and the player must manage the full technology tree from the beginning, instead of being gradually introduced over the course of the campaign.

An add-on, called &quot;The Red Odyssey&quot;, was later released with an American and a Chinese campaign. The American campaign follows an NSDF unit, also called the &quot;Black Dogs&quot;, during scrap-gathering operations on Jupiter&#x27;s moon Ganymede. The Americans, expecting boring garrison duty, are ambushed by Chinese tanks, which are capable of cloaking. After being mauled by the Chinese, the Americans reestablish themselves and discover that the Chinese are using a Stargate-like portal to travel between Earth and Ganymede, and to the planet Elysium, which is located in another planetary system. Control of the portals changes hands back and forth several times, but the campaign ends with the Americans in control, and the Chinese annihilated. The Chinese campaign starts earlier, with the first few missions focusing on stealing the Portal technology from the Soviets (who do not have their own campaign) and establishing their own. Later missions follow the American attempts to control Ganymede and Elysium.

== Development and release ==
Producer Mike Arkin explained the motive behind the game&#x27;s concept: &quot;The original &quot;Battlezone&quot; was action only. Action alone doesn&#x27;t cut it 17 years later. But when you combine action with other genres, you get wildly fun - and wildly successful - games. Action meets RPG, you get &quot;Diablo&quot;; action meets simulation, you get &quot;MechWarrior 2&quot;; action meets adventure, you get &quot;Tomb Raider&quot;. We said, &#x27;OK, there is no action meets strategy yet&#x27;&quot;. To solve the display issue which makes combining the action and strategy genres difficult, the development team created an interface which combined a first-person, in-the-field viewpoint with a 3D topological radar and transparent drop down menus which allow the player to monitor and control the battle situation at all times.

The game&#x27;s artificial intelligence was reused from &quot;Dark Reign: The Future of War&quot;.

&quot;Battlezone&quot; had gone gold by March 5, 1998 and was released on March 11, 1998.

=== Expansions ===
In 1998, Macmillan Publishing released &quot;Battlegrounds&quot;, an authorized level pack for &quot;Battlezone&quot;, after conducting a contest in which players submitted their own creations. The pack contains 45 Instant Action missions, and 52 multiplayer maps, provided with a new utility for launching and managing maps.

Also in 1999, Macmillan Publishing released the Team Evolve-made addon pack for &quot;Battlezone: The Red Odyssey&quot;. This expansion contains a new single-player story arc pitting the Chinese Red Army forces against both their allies, the CCA, and their enemies the &quot;Black Dogs&quot;. The &quot;Black Dogs&quot; were a roughed-up, beaten-up offshoot of the NSDF with the reputation of ending up with the toughest missions. The Chinese forces introduced both Portal technology that allowed travel outside the Solar System and a &#x27;Cloak&#x27;, which hid their ships while disabling weapons.

In 1999, a &quot;Battlezone&quot; Gold Pack was released which includes &quot;Battlezone&quot;, two authorized add-on packs: &quot;The Red Odyssey&quot; and &quot;Battlegrounds&quot;, and an official strategy guide.

=== Nintendo 64 port ===

In 2000, Crave ported the game to the Nintendo 64 under the name &quot;Battlezone: Rise of the Black Dogs&quot;. Compared to the PC version released a year earlier the game includes an additional Black Dog campaign distinct from that of &quot;The Red Odyssey&quot;, but the multiplayer is very limited. The game features a standard deathmatch mode where up to four players combat each other and a number of computer-controlled bots, a race mode where the objective is to navigate from one beacon to another for a set number of laps, and a strategy mode in which players choose three computer-controlled bots to assist them and simply attempt to eliminate all other players.

=== End-of-support ===
Last patch for the PC version was 1.4 released in November 1998. In 2002 the multiplayer support ended and Activision shut down its servers but released the source code of the multiplayer library &quot;Anet&quot; under GNU Lesser Public License to the community.

=== &quot;Battlezone 98 Redux&quot; ===
In July 2013, Rebellion Developments bought the rights to &quot;Battlezone&quot; from Atari, and in 2016 Rebellion unveiled &quot;Battlezone 98 Redux&quot;, a re-mastered version of the 1998 game. It was released on April 18 on the Steam platform and on June 8 on the GOG.com platform in that time. A remastered version of &quot;The Red Odyssey&quot; was later released in July, and the expansion was later bundled with the game for its release to the Apple App Store the next year.

== Reception ==
The American market research firm PC Data reported that &quot;Battlezone&quot; sold 48,000 copies between March and November 1998. Sales in the United States totaled 65,716 copies during 1998, which accounted for $2.45 million in revenue. This number had risen 73,324 copies by April 1999, while global sales totaled 200,000 copies by June. Pandemic head Andrew Goldman said that the game &quot;did not do as well as we would have liked at retail&quot;, which the company&#x27;s Josh Resnick blamed on its branding, marketing and unusual design. Regardless of its commercial performance however, &quot;Battlezone&quot; was successful enough to warrant a sequel, mainly due to the OEM market. Resnick stated that &quot;Battlezone&quot; was bundled with multiple 3D cards; thus, the game reached over a million users overall.

Reception of &quot;Battlezone&quot; was overwhelmingly positive. The game scored 89 out of 100 on GameRankings.

Most reviewers were impressed with the way &quot;Battlezone&quot; combined two genres: real time strategy and first-person shooter. GameSpot said that &quot;what really makes &quot;Battlezone&quot; so special is the way it blends the adrenaline rush of first-person action games with the strategy and resource management of &quot;Red Alert&quot;&quot;. Reviewers were also impressed with the game&#x27;s interface, calling it innovative and simple to use. Game Revolution praised graphics and addictive gameplay. Ted Smith from Allgame was disappointed with introductory voiceovers, while Stephen Poole from GameSpot 
noted that &quot;the AI for friendly units can be a little dicey and that Control can be a bit of a problem for mousers&quot; but concluded that Ninety percent of the reason he mentioned any game flaws in his review is because that is his job not because they bothered him much when he was playing.

&quot;Next Generation&quot; reviewed the PC version of the game, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that &quot;if &quot;Quake&quot; occupies 100% of a certain portion of the brain, and if &quot;Command &amp; Conquer&quot; can occupy 100% of another portion of your brain, &quot;Battlezone&quot; succeeds in occupying 80% of both&quot;.

&quot;Battlezone&quot; was nominated for GameSpot&#x27;s 1998 Strategy Game of the Year award.

&quot;Battlezone&quot; won &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;″s award for the best action game of 1998. The editors wrote that it &quot;really broke new ground&quot;, and summarized: &quot;The graphics were drop-dead gorgeous, the multiplayer game was a blast, and the game sported a beautifully designed interface that made commanding your forces an intuitive breeze&quot;. &quot;PC Gamer US&quot; nominated &quot;Battlezone&quot; as 1998&#x27;s best action game, best strategy game and overall game of the year, but it lost these three categories to &quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Rainbow Six&quot;, &quot;StarCraft&quot; and &quot;Half-Life&quot;, respectively. The editors called &quot;Battlezone&quot; &quot;a who-would-have-thought-it-possible melding of first-person action and real-time strategy that also boasted some of the year&#x27;s best presentation and interface design&quot;.

In 1998, &quot;PC Gamer&quot; declared it the 16th-best computer game ever released, and the editors called it &quot;one of the most refreshing games of 1998 [...] so much deeper than just a graphic reworking of its twenty year-old namesake&quot;.

In 1999, &quot;Next Generation&quot; listed &quot;Battlezone&quot; as number 38 on their &quot;Top 50 Games of All Time&quot;, commenting that &quot;using a brilliant 3D map interface, the developers [...] managed to seamlessly marry a great realtime strategy game with a hardcore action engine. The end result is one of the most compelling PC games ever released&quot;.

== Sequel ==
Activision released a sequel late in December 1999, &quot;Battlezone II: Combat Commander&quot;, which involved a war resulting from the incursion of a new faction known as the Scions. Members of the Black Dogs broke away and merged with the biometal, becoming Scions. &quot;Battlezone II&quot; introduced a split single-player campaign, allowing the player to switch sides at one point and join the enemy. The sequel received generally positive reviews, but notably less so than its predecessor.

<text>The 1953 Canadian federal election was held on August 10, 1953, to elect members of the House of Commons of Canada of the 22nd Parliament of Canada. Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent led his Liberal Party of Canada to its second consecutive majority government, although the party lost seats to the other parties.

The Progressive Conservative Party, led by former Premier of Ontario, George Drew, formed the official opposition, but for the last time until 1993, the party was unable to win the popular vote in any of Canada&#x27;s provinces or territories.

This was the last election until 1988 in which any party won back-to-back majorities, and the last until 1997 in which the Liberals would accomplish this feat. This election is the last time that the Liberals would win more seats in Alberta than the largest right-of-centre party in Canada, and the last time they would win more seats than the Tories in Alberta until 1993.

<doc id="794021" wikidata="Q242546" url="?curid=794021" title="Dora Carrington">
<text>Dora de Houghton Carrington (29 March 1893 – 11 March 1932), known generally as Carrington, was an English painter and decorative artist, remembered in part for her association with members of the Bloomsbury Group, especially the writer Lytton Strachey. From her time as an art student, she was known simply by her surname as she considered &quot;Dora&quot; to be &quot;vulgar and sentimental&quot;. She was not well known as a painter during her lifetime, as she rarely exhibited and did not sign her work. She worked for a while at the Omega Workshops, and for the Hogarth Press, designing woodcuts.

==Early life==
Carrington was born in Hereford, England, to railway engineer Samuel Carrington, who worked for the East India Company, and Charlotte (née Houghton). They had married in 1888 and had five children together of whom Dora was their fourth. She attended the all-girls&#x27; Bedford High School which emphasized art, and her parents paid for her to receive extra lessons in drawing. She won a number of awards in the national school competitions organised by the Royal Drawing Society.

In 1910, she went to the Slade School of Art in central London where she subsequently won a scholarship and several other prizes; her fellow students included Dorothy Brett, Paul Nash, C. R. W. Nevinson and Mark Gertler. All at one time or another were in love with her, as was Nash&#x27;s younger brother John Nash, who hoped to marry her. Gertler pursued Carrington for a number of years, and they had a brief sexual relationship during the years of the First World War.

During 1912, Carrington attended a series of lectures by Mary Sargant Florence on fresco painting. The following year, she and Constance Lane completed three large frescoes for a library at Ashridge in the Chilterns. Plans, with John and Paul Nash, for a cycle of frescoes for a church in Uxbridge near London came to nothing with the start of the War. After graduating from the Slade, although short of money, Carrington stayed in London, living in Soho with a studio in Chelsea. Her paintings were included in a number of group exhibitions, including with the New English Art Club, and she stopped signing and dating her work. In 1914 Carrington&#x27;s parents moved to Ibthorpe House in the village of Hurstbourne Tarrant in Hampshire, and shortly afterwards she moved there and set up her studio in an outbuilding.

==Career and personal life==
Carrington was not a member of the Bloomsbury Group, though she was closely associated with Bloomsbury and, more generally, with &quot;Bohemian&quot; attitudes, through her long relationship with the homosexual writer Lytton Strachey, whom she first met in 1916. Distinguished by her cropped pageboy hair style (before it was fashionable) and somewhat androgynous appearance, she was troubled by her sexuality; she is believed by some to have had an affair with Henrietta Bingham. She also had a significant relationship with the writer Gerald Brenan.

In June 1918, Virginia Woolf wrote of Carrington in her diary: &quot;She is odd from her mixture of impulse &amp; self consciousness. I wonder sometimes what she’s at: so eager to please, conciliatory, restless, &amp; active... [B]ut she is such a bustling eager creature, so red &amp; solid, &amp; at the same time inquisitive, that one can’t help liking her.&quot; Carrington first set up house with Lytton Strachey in November 1917, when they moved together to Tidmarsh Mill House, near Pangbourne, Berkshire. Carrington met Ralph Partridge, an Oxford friend of her younger brother Noel, in 1918. Partridge fell in love with Carrington and eventually, in 1921, Carrington agreed to marry him, not for love but to hold the ménage à trois together. Strachey paid for the wedding, and accompanied the couple on their honeymoon in Venice. The three moved to Ham Spray House in Wiltshire in 1924; the house had been purchased by Strachey in the name of Partridge.

In 1926, Ralph Partridge began an affair with Frances Marshall, and left to live with her in London. His marriage to Carrington was effectively over, but he continued to visit her most weekends. In 1928 Carrington met Bernard Penrose, a friend of Partridge and the younger brother of the artist Roland Penrose, and began an affair with him. The affair energized Carrington&#x27;s artistic creativity, and she also collaborated with Penrose on the making of three films. However, Penrose wanted Carrington exclusively for himself, a commitment she refused to make because of her love for Strachey. The affair, her last with a man, ended when Carrington became pregnant and had an abortion.
During her lifetime, Carrington&#x27;s work received no critical attention. The lack of encouragement may have kept her from displaying her artwork. Carrington&#x27;s work can be described as progressive, because it did not fit into the mainstream of art in England at the time. In fact, her work was not considered art at all. It featured Victorian-style pictures which were made from coloured tinfoil and paper. Carrington included pen sketches in letters to her friends, with the intention of entertaining them. She also created woodblock prints, which were highly regarded. Her lesser-known work included painted pub signs and murals, ceramics, fireplaces, and tin trunks.
Carrington was better known for her landscape paintings, which have been linked to surrealism. Her landscapes blend the facts of visual perception with interior desires and fantasies. One work of art, &quot;Mountain Ranges from Yegen, Andalusia&quot;, 1924, shows the split in perspectives. There is an intimate foreground, and there is in the distance a view of the mountains. The main focus, on the middle mountains, exhibit the texture of human skin. This merges the notion of the personal being made public.

===Relationship with Lytton Strachey===
For many years, Carrington&#x27;s art was neglected by the public, and her main notoriety was her relationship with Lytton Strachey. On the day that she agreed to marry Partridge she wrote to Strachey, who was in Italy, what has been described as &quot;one of the most moving love letters in the English language&quot;. She wrote, &quot;I cried last night Lytton, whilst he slept by my side sleeping happily—I cried to think of a savage cynical fate which had made it impossible for my love ever to be used by you...&quot;. Strachey wrote back that &quot;you &quot;do&quot; know very well that I love you as something more than a friend, you angelic creature, whose goodness to me has made me happy for years, and whose presence in my life has been and always will be, one of the most important things in my life ...&quot;. On his deathbed Strachey said, &quot;I always wanted to marry Carrington and I never did&quot;. His biographer calls that sentiment &quot;not true; but he could not have said anything more deeply consoling&quot;. Upon his death, Strachey left Carrington £10,000 (roughly the equivalent of £576,000 in 2023).

==Death==

Dora Carrington died by suicide on 11 March 1932, two months after Strachey&#x27;s death, using a gun borrowed from her friend, Hon. Bryan Guinness (later 2nd Baron Moyne). Her body was cremated and the ashes buried under the laurels in the garden of Ham Spray House.

==Legacy==
An accomplished painter of portraits, landscape and still-life, Carrington also worked in applied and decorative arts, painting on any type of surface she had at hand including inn signs, tiles and furniture. She also decorated pottery and designed the library at Ham Spray. In 1970 David Garnett published a selection of letters and extracts from her diary, since which time critical and popular appreciation of her work has risen sharply. In 1978, Sir John Rothenstein, for nearly thirty years Director of the Tate Gallery, London, called Dora Carrington &quot;the most neglected serious painter of her time.&quot; Carrington was one of the five artists featured in the television series &quot;Five Women Painters&quot; made in 1989 by the Arts Council and Channel 4, with accompanying book published by Lennard. In 1995 she was the subject of a major retrospective exhibition at the Barbican Art Gallery in London and in 20242025 there was another retrospective at the Pallant House Gallery in Chichester, co-curated by Anne Chisholm and Ariane Banks. Two of her works are in the Tate Gallery.

<text>Valpromide (marketed as Depamide by Sanofi-Aventis) is a carboxamide derivative of valproic acid used in the treatment of epilepsy and some affective disorders. It is rapidly metabolised (80%) to valproic acid (another anticonvulsant) but has anticonvulsant properties itself. It may produce more stable plasma levels than valproic acid or sodium valproate and may be more effective at preventing febrile seizures. However, it is over one hundred times more potent as an inhibitor of liver microsomal epoxide hydrolase. This makes it incompatible with carbamazepine and can affect the ability of the body to remove other toxins. Valpromide is no safer during pregnancy than valproic acid.

Valpromide is formed through the reaction of valproic acid and ammonia via an intermediate acid chloride.

In pure form, valpromide is a white crystalline powder and has a melting point 125–126 °C. It is soluble only in hot water. It is available on the market in some European countries.

<doc id="794030" wikidata="Q8012585" url="?curid=794030" title="William Howard Taft IV">
<text>William Howard Taft IV (born September 13, 1945) is an American diplomat and attorney who served in the United States government under several Republican administrations. He is a son of William Howard Taft III and a great-grandson of President William Howard Taft.

==Early life and education==

Taft was born in Washington, D.C., the second child of William Howard Taft III and Barbara Bradfield. Taft IV&#x27;s patrilineal great-grandfather was U.S. President William Howard Taft and he attended St. Paul&#x27;s School in Concord, New Hampshire graduating in 1962. Taft IV earned his bachelor of arts degree in English from Yale University in 1966 and his Juris Doctor degree from Harvard Law School in 1969.

==Personal life==
William Taft IV and his late wife, Julia Vadala Taft, had three children.

==Career==
After researching the FTC as one of &quot;Nader&#x27;s Raiders&quot;, William Taft IV briefly was the attorney adviser to the chairman of the Federal Trade Commission in 1970. From 1970 to 1973, he was the principal assistant to Caspar W. Weinberger, who was deputy director, then director of the Office of Management and Budget in the Executive Office of the President under President Richard Nixon. Taft assisted Weinberger in the management of the budgetary process, policy review, and program oversight for all of the federal government.

Taft married Julia Vadala in 1974.

Taft served from 1973 to 1976 as the executive assistant to the United States Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare. In April 1976 Taft was appointed by President Gerald Ford to serve as general counsel of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. In the post, as the chief lawyer for the department and the principal administrator of the Office of the General Counsel, he supervised over 350 lawyers in Washington and 10 regional offices. During the Carter administration, he was an attorney with the Washington, D.C. law firm of Leva, Hawes, Symington, Martin and Oppenheimer.

In February 1981, as one of his first appointments, President Ronald Reagan appointed Taft as General Counsel of the Department of Defense. Taft was appointed Deputy Secretary of Defense and served from January 1984 to April 1989. He served as acting Secretary of Defense from January to March 1989 after George H. W. Bush became president. Bush&#x27;s initial nominee, John Tower, was not confirmed by the United States Senate after much contentious debate and testimony. The eventual appointee confirmed in March was Dick Cheney (later Vice President of the United States, 2001–2009). Although he was only acting secretary of defense and never confirmed as the permanent secretary, he became the third member of his family to hold a position as civilian head of a military department after his great-great-grandfather Alphonso Taft (under President Ulysses S. Grant) and his great-grandfather William Howard Taft (under President Theodore Roosevelt).

Taft served as U.S. Permanent Representative to NATO, which has the rank of ambassador, from 1989 to 1992, during the Gulf War. During the Clinton administration, he entered private practice with the Washington, D.C., law firm of Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver &amp; Jacobson.

===Service in George W. Bush administration===
After the election of 2000, George W. Bush appointed Taft to serve as chief legal adviser to the United States Department of State under Secretary of State Colin Powell, with whom he was reportedly friends. The appointment was technically a significantly lower appointment than he had held in other administrations, but it permitted him to work with his wife, Julia Taft, a top State Department official in charge of refugees who also served during the Clinton administration.

While serving as legal adviser, Taft wrote two seminal law journal articles regarding the views of the United States on the legality of the use of military force. First, in connection with the decision of the International Court of Justice in the Oil Platforms case, Taft countered a series of propositions that the court appeared to accept regarding the principles governing the use of force. That included his conclusion that &quot;There is no requirement in international law that a State exercising its right of self-defense must use the same degree or type of force used by the attacking State in its most recent attack. Rather, the proportionality of the measures taken in self-defence is to be judged according to the nature of the threat being addressed.&quot; Second, Taft coauthored (with Todd F. Buchwald) an article in the Americal Journal of International Law that set forth the official United States Government view regarding the permissibility under international law of the use of force by the United States and Coalition forces during the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The article concluded that the preemptive use of force in Iraq is lawful where, as in Iraq, &quot;it represents an episode in an ongoing broader conflict initiated--without question-- by the opponent and where, as here, it is consistent with the resolutions of the Security Council.

In 2004, Taft&#x27;s name surfaced as a dissenter concerning the policy of interrogation techniques for military detainees. In a January 11, 2002, memo, he opposed Department of Justice lawyers to argue that the president could not &quot;suspend&quot; U.S. obligations to respect the Geneva Conventions and that a legal argument to do so was &quot;legally flawed and procedurally impossible.&quot; This was also the position of Secretary Powell, who attempted to persuade Bush to reconsider. Alberto R. Gonzales, the White House counsel, subsequently advised Bush in a memo that Taft and Powell were wrong and the Justice Department&#x27;s analysis was &quot;definitive.&quot; Gonzales claimed terrorist attacks &quot;require a new approach in our actions toward captured terrorists,&quot; and argued that if suspected terrorists had never respected the Geneva Conventions&#x27; human rights protections, the U.S. didn&#x27;t need to do so.

===Leaving government service===
After the re-election of President Bush, resignation of Colin Powell and appointment of Condoleezza Rice as secretary of state, Taft resigned to return to private practice, again at Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver &amp; Jacobson. He is a visiting professor at Stanford Law School, having succeeded Allen Weiner as the Warren Christopher Professor of the Practice of International Law and Diplomacy in 2007. In January 2009 he was named chair of the board of trustees for Freedom House, an independent watchdog organization which supports the expansion of freedom around the world. On September 12, 2006, Taft co-signed (along with 28 other retired military or defense department officials) a letter to the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Armed Services committee in which he stated his belief that the Bush Administration&#x27;s attempt to redefine Common Article 3 of the Geneva Convention &quot;poses a grave threat&quot; to U.S. service members.

Taft is said to be one of the sources who told journalists David Corn and Michael Isikoff that former Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage was the source syndicated columnist Robert Novak had when he made public the fact that Valerie Wilson worked for the CIA. In a review of Corn&#x27;s and Isikoff&#x27;s book, &quot;Hubris: The Inside Story of Spin, Scandal, and the Selling of the Iraq War&quot;, Novak wrote: &quot;I don&#x27;t know precisely how Isikoff flushed out Armitage [as Novak&#x27;s original source], but &quot;Hubris&quot; clearly points to two sources: Washington lobbyist Kenneth Duberstein, Armitage&#x27;s political adviser, and William Taft IV, who was the State Department legal adviser when Armitage was deputy secretary.&quot;

Though a staunch Republican, Taft opposed the 2016 presidential campaign of Donald Trump, declaring alongside 49 other Republican former national security officials that he would not vote for the candidate. In 2020, Taft again rebuked his party, endorsing Democrat Joe Biden over Trump. In 2020, Taft, along with over 130 other former Republican national security officials, signed a statement asserting that President Trump was unfit to serve another term, and &quot;To that end, we are firmly convinced that it is in the best interest of our nation that Vice President Joe Biden be elected as the next President of the United States, and we will vote for him.&quot;

<text>Ella Alexander Boole (July 26, 1858 – March 13, 1952) was an American temperance movement leader and social reformer. She served as president of the World&#x27;s Woman&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) from 1931 to 1947, after serving as president of the National WCTU in the U.S.

==Biography==
Ella Alexander was born on July 26, 1858, in Van Wert, Ohio. Her father was a prominent lawyer, who edited a free soil newspaper and supported reforms during Reconstruction following the Civil War. She attended public schools in Van Wert, then the College of Wooster where she studied classics. She had an aptitude for natural science and developed skills in public speaking. She received an A.B. degree (1878), followed by an A.M. degree (1881).

She married Reverend William H. Boole of the Willet Street Methodist Church on July 3, 1883. Her husband died in 1896 and she became a deaconess in his church.

==Political activities==
===Women&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union===
Boole&#x27;s husband was active in prohibition and temperance activities, in which she joined him. Boole joined the Women&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) in 1883. She showed great skill as an organizer of new unions, and became vice-president of the New York state union in 1891. After the death of Boole&#x27;s husband, she was able to support her family through an inheritance from her father and income from her speaking engagements and temperance activities. In 1898, she became president of the New York WCTU. She held this position until 1925, with the exception of a six-year period when she was corresponding secretary of the Woman&#x27;s Board of Home Missions of the Presbyterian Church (1903-1909). From October 1926 till October 1933, she served as Editor-in-Chief of the National WCTU&#x27;s organ, &quot;The Union Signal&quot;. One of her key activities was in shifting WCTU work away from its emphasis on collecting petitions, and towards direct lobbying of legislators.

===Political activities===
Following the enfranchisement of women in the United States, Boole decided to run for office herself. In 1920, she unsuccessfully challenged James Wolcott Wadsworth Jr. for the Republican Party nomination for the United States Senate. After losing the nomination, she ran as a candidate for the Prohibition Party against Wadsworth and the Democratic and Socialist Party candidates in the general election. Wadsworth won easily with 52% of the vote, while Boole came in third place with 7% of the vote, not far ahead of the Socialist candidate.

Boole served as head of the national Woman&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union from 1931 to 1947. She died on March 13, 1952, at age 93.

Her other causes included supporting legislative changes to bring about social reform, including laws to protect the rights of women and children in industry, the establishment of separate courts and deputies for juvenile offenders, and woman suffrage. As President of the international WCTU, she promoted disarmament, the end of the international illicit drug trade, and supported international women&#x27;s rights.

<doc id="794040" wikidata="Q5384135" url="?curid=794040" title="Equal Pay Act of 1963">
<text>The Equal Pay Act of 1963 is a United States labor law amending the Fair Labor Standards Act, aimed at abolishing wage disparity based on sex (see gender pay gap). It was signed into law on June 10, 1963, by John F. Kennedy as part of his New Frontier Program. In passing the bill, Congress stated that sex discrimination:
* depresses wages and living standards for employees necessary for their health and efficiency;
* prevents the maximum utilization of the available labor resources;
* tends to cause labor disputes, thereby burdening, affecting, and obstructing commerce;
* burdens commerce and the free flow of goods in commerce; and
* constitutes an unfair method of competition.

The law provides in part that &quot;[n]o employer having employees subject to any provisions of this section [section 206 of title 29 of the United States Code] shall discriminate, within any establishment in which such employees are employed, between employees on the basis of sex by paying wages to employees in such establishment at a rate less than the rate at which he pays wages to employees of the opposite sex in such establishment for equal work on jobs[,] the performance of which requires equal skill, effort, and responsibility, and which are performed under similar working conditions, except where such payment is made pursuant to (i) a seniority system; (ii) a merit system; (iii) a system which measures earnings by quantity or quality of production; or (iv) a differential based on any other factor other than sex [...].&quot;

==Background==

In 1944, Republican congresswoman Winifred C. Stanley from Buffalo, N.Y. introduced H.R. 5056, Prohibiting Discrimination in Pay on Account of Sex, which did not pass at the time. The issue languished until 10 June 1963, when Congress passed the Equal Pay Act (&quot;EPA&quot; or the &quot;Act&quot;) as an amendment to the Fair Labor Standards Act, to &quot;prohibit discrimination on account of sex in the payment of wages by employers.&quot;

Congress included within the text of the EPA a clear and concise policy statement and briefly described the problems it was intended to remedy. The clear statement of Congressional intent and policy guiding the EPA’s enactment indicate the Congressional desire to fashion a broad remedial framework to protect employees from wage discrimination on the basis of sex. The Supreme Court has expressly recognized the view that the EPA must be broadly construed to achieve Congress’ goal of remedying sexual discrimination. Congress passed the EPA out of &quot;concern for the weaker bargaining position of women&quot; to provide a remedy to discriminatory wage structures that reflect &quot;an ancient but outmoded belief that a man, because of his role in society, should be paid more than a woman.&quot; The EPA protects both men and women. It also protects administrative, professional and executive employees who are exempt under the Fair Labor Standards Act.

The EPA, Section 206(d)(1), prohibits &quot;employer[s] ... [from] discriminat[ing] … on the basis of sex by paying wages to employees [...] at a rate less than the rate [paid] to employees of the opposite sex [...] for equal work on jobs [requiring] equal skill, effort, and responsibility, and which are performed under similar working conditions[.]&quot; To establish a prima facie case under the EPA, an employee must show that:
#different wages are paid to employees of the opposite sex;
#the employees perform substantially equal work on jobs requiring equal skill, effort, and responsibility; and
#the jobs are performed under similar working conditions.

The EPA provides that the employer may not pay lower wages to employees of one gender than it pays to employees of the other gender, employees within the same establishment for equal work at jobs that require equal skill, effort, and responsibility, and that are performed under similar working conditions.

The EPA does not contain any intent requirement within the statutory language. Liability under the EPA is established by meeting the three elements of the prima facie case, regardless of the intention of the employer. As such, the EPA imposes strict liability on employers who engage in wage discrimination on the basis of gender.

Once a plaintiff meets her or his heavy burden and establishes a prima facie case of gender discrimination under the EPA, then the defendant may avoid liability only by proving the existence of one of four statutory affirmative defenses. The EPA’s four affirmative defenses allow unequal pay for equal work when the wages are set &quot;pursuant to (i) a seniority system; (ii) a merit system; (iii) a system which measures earnings by quantity or quality of production; or (iv) ... any other factor other than sex[.]&quot;

==Congressional intent==
Upon its initial enactment, the EPA was &quot;the first step towards an adjustment of balance in pay for women.” As a part of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, the EPA was subject to the scope and exceptions of covered employees and employers contained within that act. On the floor of the House of Representatives, many Representatives voiced their concern that the EPA should act as the starting point for establishing pay parity for women. Subsequent to the enactment of the EPA, Congress undertook two actions which broadened the scope of federal protection against wage discrimination on the basis of sex.

First, the same 88th Congress enacted Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. By including sex as an element protected from discrimination, Title VII expanded the protection of women from employment discrimination, to include almost all employees working for employers with fifteen or more employees. Foreseeing the potential conflict between the administration of two statutes with overlapping restrictions, Congress included the Bennett Amendment in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which incorporates the EPA’s four affirmative defenses into Title VII.

Second, Congress expanded the EPA’s coverage to professionals and other white-collar employees. For the first nine years of the EPA, the requirement of equal pay for equal work did not extend to persons employed in an executive, administrative or professional capacity, or as an outside salesperson. Therefore, the EPA exempted white-collar women from the protection of equal pay for equal work. In 1972, Congress enacted the Education Amendments of 1972, which amended the FLSA to expand the coverage of the EPA to these employees, by excluding the EPA from the professional workers exemption of the FLSA.

===Congress&#x27; consideration of economic consequences===
The Congress did not ignore the EPA’s economic consequences on the salaries and employment opportunities for both men and women. First, as an amendment of the FLSA, the EPA is part of the same legislative structure that houses the federal minimum wage laws. The EPA acts as a wage equalizer between men and women for equal jobs, and has the potential of acting as a price floor on the salaries of men or women for particular jobs. Economists, such as Thomas Sowell have asserted the EPA causes unemployment, and additional discrimination against women by excluding them from the labor market. Second, several Representatives voiced their concerns that the negative impact of setting price floors on the wages paid to women would reduce the availability of jobs for women. With the possible side effects of the Act noted on the Congressional record, the Act passed with little opposition, and no indication that any of the four affirmative defenses were intended to remedy or limit its negative consequences.

==Impact==

=== Earnings gap ===
Average American women’s salaries have risen relative to men&#x27;s since the EPA’s enactment, from 62.3% of men’s earnings in 1979 to 81.1% in 2018.

=== Further legislation ===
The EPA did not originally cover executives, administrators, outside salespeople, and professionals, but the Education Amendments of 1972 amended the EPA so that it does.

In 2005, Senator Hillary Clinton introduced the &quot;Paycheck Fairness Act,&quot; which proposed to amend the EPA’s fourth affirmative defense to permit only bona fide factors other than sex that are job-related or serve a legitimate business interest. Representative Rosa DeLauro first introduced an identical bill in the House of Representatives on the same day.

In 2007, the Supreme Court restricted the applicable statute of limitations for equal pay claims in &quot;Ledbetter v. Goodyear&quot;. On January 29, 2009, President Barack Obama signed into law the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which overturned the Court&#x27;s holding in this case. This bill, providing that each gender-unequal paycheck is a new violation of the law, was the first bill signed by President Obama.

=== Enforcement ===
Initially, a 2007 study commissioned by the Department of Labor cautioned against overzealous application of the EPA without closer examination of possible reasons for pay discrepancies. This study noted, for example, that men as a group earn higher wages in part because men dominate blue collar jobs, which are more likely to require cash payments for overtime work; in contrast, women comprise over half of the salaried white collar management workforce that is often exempted from overtime laws. In summary, the study stated:
&quot;Although additional research in this area is clearly needed, this study leads to the unambiguous conclusion that the differences in the compensation of men and women are the result of a multitude of factors and that the raw wage gap should not be used as the basis to justify corrective action. Indeed, there may be nothing to correct. The differences in raw wages may be almost entirely the result of the individual choices being made by both male and female workers.&quot;

However, later, in 2021, a Department of Labor blogpost observed, &quot;Women earn less than their same race and ethnicity counterpart at every level of educational attainment - Compared with white men with the same education, Black and Latina women with only a bachelor&#x27;s degree have the largest gap at 65%, and Black women with advanced degrees earn 70% of what white men with advanced degrees earn. Educational attainment is not enough to close gender earnings gaps. In fact, most women with advanced degrees earn less than white men, on average, with only a bachelor&#x27;s degree.&quot;

=== Outside the United States ===
The Equal Pay Act 1970 was an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom that prohibited any less favourable treatment between men and women in terms of pay and conditions of employment. The Equal Pay Act 1970 has now been mostly superseded by Part 5, chapter 3, of the Equality Act 2010.

<text>Lambert&#x27;s Cafe is a US restaurant chain with locations in Foley, Alabama; Sikeston, Missouri; and Ozark, Missouri. It was founded in 1942. It is known for throwing hot rolls to the customers. It features Southern or country cooking (fried chicken, catfish, etc.); a variety of side dishes, called &quot;pass arounds&quot;, are brought to the table to accompany each meal. The restaurants have been cited as a prime example of &quot;road food&quot;, and diners often arrive via tour bus.

==History==
The cafe was started in Sikeston in 1942 by Earl Lambert, assisted by his wife Agnes, his brother Robert, and Robert&#x27;s wife Ruby. In 1976 Earl&#x27;s son Norman &quot;&#x27;Ole Norm&quot; Lambert, a former football coach at Sikeston High School, took over management. It was Norman who started the tradition of throwing rolls to customers. In 1981 he explained, &quot;I started throwing rolls about four years ago when we were in our old cafe. It was too crowded one noon for me to serve the rolls to a customer and somebody yelled, &#x27;Throw em.&#x27; So I threw them. So, now I do that about every noon meal and during the evenings too. The rolls are fresh, right out of the oven.&quot;

==Legal issues==
In August 2015 the restaurant was sued by a customer who says he suffered permanent eye injuries after being struck by a hot roll thrown by a staff member. A lawyer acting for the plaintiff said Lambert&#x27;s has been sued for similar injuries in the past. A Lambert&#x27;s spokesman confirmed that other customers have previously sought damages for similar claims, and in some cases medical expenses have been paid.

<text>Air Chief Marshal Lloyd Samuel Breadner, CB, DSC (July 14, 1894 – March 14, 1952) was a Canadian military pilot and Chief of the Air Staff during World War II.

==Early career==
Breadner obtained his pilot&#x27;s certificate at Wright Flying School and was commissioned in the British Royal Naval Air Service on December 28, 1915. During World War I he served on the Western Front as a fighter pilot in the No. 3 (Naval) Squadron. He was promoted to Flight Lieutenant (RNAS) on 31 December 1916. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross on May 23, 1917. The citation read:

Squadron Commander Lloyd Breadner and 3 (Naval) Squadron were posted to RAF Walmer during the Winter of 1917/1918 .
He was released from the RAF with the rank of major in March 1919.

==Command==
He was commissioned promoted to Squadron Leader in 1920 and transferred to the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) on its formation in 1924. He became Controller of Civil Aviation in 1922, and later commanded Camp Borden from January 15, 1924, to September 23, 1925. He was promoted to Wing Commander on April 1, 1924.

<text>.ee is the internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) of Estonia, operated by the Estonian Internet Foundation.

== Second-level domain names ==
* .com.ee – companies (incorporated entities) as defined in the Commercial Code.
* .pri.ee – individuals.
* .fie.ee – self-employed people (sole proprietors) as defined in the Commercial Code.
* .med.ee – medical/health care institutions.
* .edu.ee – educational institutions and projects.
* .lib.ee – libraries.
* .org.ee – non-profit organizations and projects.

== History ==
The top-level domain .ee was introduced in 1992 and was operated by EENet until July 2010. The administrator of .ee domain was the academic Endel Lippmaa. 

There was a limit of one domain name per legal entity, and registrations of additional names to protect trademarks were specifically denied because &quot;the domain name has no trademark status&quot;. 

As domains under .ee were meant to be an institution&#x27;s identification on the Internet (like the register code in the commercial register), registration of additional domains in the defense of a trademark or a name form is not possible. 

Valid registrations were free of charge.

=== Domain reform ===
The new order of registration of .ee TLD became available on 5 July 2010. 

Estonian Internet Foundation took over .ee ccTLD registry functions from EENet. 

With the new domain rules, both private individuals and foreigners can register an unlimited number of domains directly under .ee. 

Domain name registration is done on two levels, .ee domain registrants are serviced by authorized registrars. Also, payment of registry administration from the state budget was stopped and a fee was established for domain registration. 

All existing domains registered before the transition had to be re-registered during a 6-month transition period which ended on 5 January 2011. Registration services can be done through accredited registrars listed on Estonian Internet Foundation website. 

Domain disputes are handled by Domain Disputes Committee.

=== After the reform ===
On June 13, 2011, the registration of domains with the dotted letters õ, ä, ö, ü, š and žš, ž was enabled, which covered the entire Estonian alphabet under the .ee domain.

From March 1, 2013, domains can also be registered for two or up to three years.

On July 18, 2013, the tasks of managing the .ee domain were handed over to EIS internationally. By the decision of the board of directors of ICANN, EIS was entered into the international database of top-level domains as the administrator or sponsoring organization of the .ee domain. With the status of a sponsoring organization, all administrative tasks related to the .ee domain in front of both the domestic and the international Internet community are concentrated in one institution.

On January 6, 2014, EIS, in cooperation with accredited registrars, launched the DNSSEC service - a system of security keys that ensures that the user is directed to the web page whose address is entered in the web browser. For example, DNSSEC ensures that entering the web address of your online bank in the address bar of a web browser does not redirect the user to a similar-looking page set up by fraudsters to steal data and passwords.

=== Registration fee ===
.ee domains can be registered for one, two or three years. 

From January 1, 2017, the domain registration fee charged to registrars is 6, 12 or 18 euros depending on the length of the registration period. 

In 2016, the registration fee was 7, 14 and 21 euros depending on the length of the registration period. VAT is added to the fee. 

The fee for the domain registrant is determined by the registrars. The final cost is also influenced by competition on the market.

== Domain hacks ==
* Linktree, a social media landing page service, uses the .ee domain (linktr.ee).
* Adventist World Radio, a refugee info and charity service, also uses the .ee domain (refug.ee).
* Shopee, an online retail site, uses the .ee domain for its link shortener service (shp.ee).
* Jakarta EE, a set of specifications for the Java software platform, uses jakarta.ee as its website address.

== Criticism ==
The new order of domain registering in 2010 was met with great controversy. 

The relaunch of the registry was at one point delayed to be reassessed. When the relaunch was finalized, the annual fee for a .ee domain was announced to be 285 Estonian kroons (18.2 euros) plus tax, which was met with wide criticism. 

A list of shortcomings was presented in a public notice to Estonian Internet Foundation by Tõnu Samuel and Jaan Jänesmäe, mentioning that the .ee domain had become the most expensive TLD in Europe. Their cause gained over 800 supporters on Facebook.

The NGO Estonian Internet Community was founded partly as a reaction to the controversial domain reform with 22 founding members. Its board is made up of Tõnu Samuel, Elver Loho and Heiti Kender. 

In 2010 it noted on its blog that several of its members had lost faith in the possibility of any sort of compromise and had independently written e-mails to IANA asking them to step in to resolve the controversy.

Over the following years the annual fee has gradually dropped, reaching 6 euros on 1 January 2017.

<text>Lawrence Miles (born 15 March 1972 in Middlesex) is a science fiction author known for his work on original &quot;Doctor Who&quot; novels (for both the Virgin New Adventures and BBC Books series) and the subsequent spin-off Faction Paradox. He is also co-author (with Tat Wood) of the &quot;About Time&quot; series of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; critiques.

== Life and work ==
Miles&#x27;s first professionally published fiction was a 3-page comic strip, illustrated by Richard Elson and run under the generic title &quot;Tharg&#x27;s Time Twisters&quot; in the weekly science fiction anthology comic &quot;2000 AD&quot;. It appeared in issue 722 (March 1991) and to date is Miles&#x27;s only contribution to &quot;2000 AD&quot;.

Miles&#x27;s major contribution to the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; expanded universe is the &quot;War in Heaven&quot; arc begun in his novel &quot;Alien Bodies&quot;. He has also written several novels and short stories outside this arc.

After most of the elements contributed by Miles were removed from the BBC novel range in the novel &quot;The Ancestor Cell&quot;, Miles reused the major elements of this arc, without the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; references, to create the Faction Paradox universe, which now encompasses books, comic books and audio dramas.

Miles used his web site The Beasthouse, where he has posted since 2004, initially as a venue for &quot;analysis of British popular culture using the UK Hit Parade as a framework and all-purpose excuse.&quot; Since then, its format shifted often, from actual diary format entries to postings consisting simply of lists. The domain &quot;beasthouse.co.uk&quot; now belongs to a different owner.

His weekly reviews of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episodes can be found on his other blog, Lawrence Miles&#x27; Doctor Who Thing. In May 2008, Miles temporarily posted online a spec script for the TV series titled &quot;Book of the World&quot;, in a self-described attempt to provide a legitimate basis for his polarising criticisms of the production team behind the revived series.

==&quot;About Time&quot;==
Miles is the co-author of the first five volumes of &quot;About Time&quot;, a &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episode guide which examines the series in its cultural and historical context. Co-written with Tat Wood, the guide contains detailed accounts of the various concerns that fed into the making of the series and a number of essays answering specific questions (e.g. &quot;How might the sonic screwdriver work?&quot; and &quot;Why didn&#x27;t they just spend more money?&quot;). In contrast to other &quot;Doctor Who&quot; guides, &quot;About Time&quot; is divided by &quot;era&quot; rather than by the lead actor, broadly reflecting different production philosophies and cultural climates. The several volumes are published in order of popularity rather than chronologically; volumes three and four were published first, covering the early and late 1970s. There are six volumes in total, the last covering the late eighties, the 1996 television movie and everything up to, but not including, the new 2005 series. Miles chose to leave the project after the completion of volume two, and the sixth and final volume was written by Wood. The sixth volume also featured additional material by publisher Lars Pearson.

<text>Syracuse, New York, United States, is a top-division, minor-league and college sports city. Teams include the Syracuse Mets of AAA Baseball and the Syracuse Crunch of the AHL. The most attended sporting events in Syracuse are those of the NCAA Division I Syracuse University Orange.

==Professional teams==

The Syracuse Mets, who play in the International League, are a AAA Minor League Baseball affiliate of the New York Mets.

The Syracuse Crunch are an American Hockey League affiliate of the Tampa Bay Lightning.

== History ==

Syracuse has had several top-level pro teams. Most notable are the Syracuse Nationals, an NBA team which played 17 seasons in Syracuse (1947–1963) before moving to Philadelphia to become the Philadelphia 76ers; and two different Major League Baseball teams: the Syracuse Stars of the National League in 1879, which didn&#x27;t finish their first season; and the Syracuse Stars of the American Association in 1890.

=== Baseball ===
Syracuse has been represented in professional baseball for all but four years since 1877, when the Syracuse Stars competed in the League Alliance, an early minor league. Syracuse fielded two major league versions of the Stars: in the National League and the American Association. Apart from those seasons, however, the Stars were members of high minor leagues such as the Eastern League (forerunner to the International) and the New York State League through 1917. From 1918 to 1927, the Stars competed in the International League and were an early farm team of the St. Louis Cardinals. In 1928 the IL franchise moved to Montreal and became the Montreal Royals. The Stars moved down one classification to the New York–Penn League for 1 seasons before moving to nearby Utica.

=== Basketball ===
Syracuse was from 1946 until 1963 home to the NBA&#x27;s Syracuse Nationals, which are now the Philadelphia 76ers. They played 17 seasons in Syracuse and won the NBA championship in 1955. The NBA&#x27;s 24-second clock was invented in and first came into use in Syracuse. In March 2005 the city dedicated a monument to this fact. It is a 125% scaled model of the original shot clock used.

The Syracuse Upstate Trojans played a single season in the American Basketball Association from 2023 to 2024.

=== Cycling ===
=== Football ===

Syracuse had a professional football team from 1890 to 1900 known as the Syracuse Athletic Association, the independent All-Syracuse team which was known in 1921 as the Syracuse Pros in the American Professional Football Association before leaving the league and reverting to the All-Syracuse team, and briefly in the 1936 American Football League season known as the Syracuse Braves.

In 1902, the first World Series of Football was played at New York&#x27;s original Madison Square Garden. The five teams in the tournament were the New York Knickerbockers, Syracuse AC, Warlow AC, the Orange (New Jersey) AC, and New York. Syracuse won the tournament 6–0 with Glenn (Pop) Warner at guard. The December 28, 1902, game where Syracuse defeated New York 5–0 at Madison Square Garden is credited as the first indoor pro football game.

The Syracuse Express were established in 1984, and were members of the Mid Continental Football League, before that league contracted into the Midwest. They joined the upstart New York Amateur Football League (NYAFL), where they became one of the league&#x27;s premier teams, along with their rivals, the Buffalo Gladiators. After absorbing the Cortland Warriors, in 1999 the team became the Central New York Express, although they still played their games in suburban Syracuse. The Express won one NYAFL title in 2003. The NYAFL merged to become the Northeastern Football Alliance and with the change, the team changed and was replaced by a new team named the Syracuse Shock.

Syracuse had a team for one season in the American Indoor Football League called the Syracuse Soldiers.

Syracuse has a minor league football team, Syracuse Strong.

=== Ice hockey ===
Syracuse has had several American Hockey League teams, which traditionally did not last longer than three seasons. The Syracuse Blazers began play in the Eastern Hockey League in 1973. The league disbanded in 1973; the team then affiliated with the North American Hockey League. 1994 marked the introduction of a new team, the Syracuse Crunch, which have been playing at the Upstate Medical University Arena since.

=== Lacrosse ===
The Syracuse Spirit was a member of the American Lacrosse League, a short lived professional lacrosse league in 1988, based in Syracuse, New York. The Spirit played their home games at the Griffin Field in Liverpool, New York. The general manager of the Spirit was Tom Scofield and the head coach was Jim Booth. The Spirit had a 4–1 record when the league folded.

Syracuse had a team in the National Lacrosse League (NLL) called the Syracuse Smash for three seasons from 1998 to 2000. They moved to Ottawa in 2001 and became the Ottawa Rebel.

=== Soccer ===
The first professional team in the city were the Syracuse Scorpions, who played in the American Soccer League in the 1970s. The Syracuse Salty Dogs existed for two seasons (2002–2004) until folding due to financial problems. The game attendance had been among the highest in the A-League. The Syracuse Silver Knights played in the Major Arena Soccer League from 2010 before moving to Utica and becoming Utica City FC in 2018.

== Venues ==
Sports venues in and around Syracuse include the following:

=== JMA Wireless Dome ===

Syracuse University&#x27;s JMA Wireless Dome can hold over 33,000 and 50,000 people, for basketball and football respectively, making it the largest domed stadium in the Northeastern United States and the largest on a college campus. Especially the Orange&#x27;s basketball games have been making use of the Dome&#x27;s capacity over the past few years. The third most attended college sporting events are lacrosse games, with the Orange at times drawing over 6,000 fans.

<doc id="794065" wikidata="Q595982" url="?curid=794065" title="1958 Canadian federal election">
<text>The 1958 Canadian federal election was held to elect members of the House of Commons of Canada of the 24th Parliament of Canada on March 31, 1958, just nine months after the 23rd election. It transformed Prime Minister John Diefenbaker&#x27;s minority into the largest majority government in Canadian history and the second-largest percentage of the popular vote; only Conservative Prime Minister Robert Borden’s triumph in the 1917 federal election, at 56.93 percent, was higher. Although the Tories would surpass their 1958 seat total in the 1984 election, the 1958 result (achieved in a smaller House) remains unmatched both in terms of percentage of seats (78.5%) and the size of the government majority over all opposition parties (a 151-seat majority). Voter turnout was 79.4%.

==Overview==

Diefenbaker called a snap election and capitalized on three factors:
* Nationally, the Liberals had just chosen a new leader, Lester Pearson, who had given an ill-advised maiden speech in Commons that asked Diefenbaker to resign and recommend the Governor General allow the Liberals to form a government without an election due to the recent economic downturn. Diefenbaker seized on the remark by describing a series of classified Liberal Cabinet documents stating that the economy would face a downturn in that year. This contrasted heavily with the Liberals&#x27; 1957 campaign promises. As election day drew near, the Liberals realized they had no chance of returning to power and hoped only to hold onto at least 100 seats. They were cut down to only 48, at the time the smallest seat count in their history.
* A turnaround in Quebec: Quebec had been largely Liberal since the Conscription Crisis of 1917, but upon the resignation of former Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent, the province had no favourite son leader, as they had since 1948, and its voters were open to new options. Seeking a greater voice in Ottawa, Quebec Premier Maurice Duplessis&#x27; &quot;Union Nationale&quot; used their party machine to ally with the Tories, allowing Diefenbaker&#x27;s Progressive Conservatives to win two thirds of the seats in what had been a Liberal stronghold for a generation. While the Liberals finished only four percentage points behind the Tories in Quebec, much of their vote was wasted racking up large majorities in their traditional safest seats. Nevertheless, the 25 seats the Liberals won in Quebec accounted for more than half of their decimated caucus and, on a proportional basis, was their best performance after Newfoundland.
* A collapse in support for the Social Credit Party, which lost all 19 of its seats. While it took half the votes it had taken in 1957, third parties historically do not do well in landslides, especially in first-past-the-post voting systems. Prior to the 1957 election, the Socreds were seen as a credible threat to replace the Tories as the main right-wing party in the country, as they had done in British Columbia and Alberta, but the popularity of the Diefenbaker government persuaded many Social Credit supporters to abandon the party. That not only allowed the Tories to pick up Social Credit seats, but also proved decisive in many seats that were four-way races between the PCs, Social Credit, Liberals, and CCF. Notably, the Tories swept all seventeen seats in Alberta, where they had previously held just three seats to Social Credit&#x27;s thirteen (and Liberal one seat). The election proved to be the start of a long decline for the federal Social Credit Party. It would never seriously challenge the PCs dominance again in federal politics (even in the West) although the BC Social Credit Party would govern that province for all but three years until 1991.

<doc id="794070" wikidata="Q6475219" url="?curid=794070" title="Lake Central Airlines">
<text>Lake Central Airlines was a local service carrier and scheduled airline that served multiple locations throughout the midwestern and eastern United States from 1950 to 1968, when it then merged into Allegheny Airlines. In 1979 Allegheny became USAir, and in 1997, USAir became US Airways. In 2015, US Airways was acquired by American Airlines through a merging of the two companies.

==History==
The airline was founded as Turner Airlines in 1948; it was based at Weir Cook Airport (now Indianapolis International Airport) in Indianapolis, Indiana. Lake Central&#x27;s network in the 1950s extended from Chicago to Pittsburgh; in August 1953 it had scheduled flights to 21 airports, and in May 1968, this number increased to 39.

Like other local service airlines regulated by the federal Civil Aeronautics Board, Lake Central was subsidized; in 1962 its revenue of $10.8 million included $4.2 million of &quot;pub. serv. rev.&quot;.

In February 1955 Lake Central Airlines became the first employee-owned scheduled airline in the history of the air transport industry. 162 employees (65% of the total) bought 97.5% of the outstanding stock, 25% outright, and the rest financed over 24 months.

Effective July 1, 1968, the airline was acquired by and merged into Allegheny Airlines. Allegheny later closed the Indianapolis base and sold the Nord 262s, which had proven unreliable. Lake Central had planned on acquiring new Boeing 737-200s, but the order was cancelled.

==Fleet==
Lake Central flew Douglas DC-3s, Convair 340s, Convair 580s, Beechcraft Bonanzas, and Nord 262s. DC-3 flights ended in 1967, and by spring of 1968 Lake Central had an all-turboprop fleet of Convair 580s and Nord 262s.

=== Historical fleet===

Lake Central Airlines previously operated the following aircraft:

* 8 Convair CV-340
* 4 Convair CV-580
* 1 Curtiss C-46 Commando (N1802M)
* 14 Douglas DC-3
* 5 Douglas C-47 Skytrain
* 3 Douglas C-53 Skytrooper
* 12 Nord 262A
==Destinations in 1968==
Shortly before the merger into Allegheny Airlines, Lake Central was serving the following cities with an all-turboprop fleet, mainly consisting of Convair 580 and Nord 262 aircraft, according to its April 28, 1968 timetable:
* Akron/Canton, Ohio

<text>Robert Ten Broeck Stevens (July 31, 1899January 31, 1983) was an American businessman and former chairman of J. P. Stevens and Company, which was one of the most established textile manufacturing plants in the US. He served as the Secretary of the Army between February 4, 1953, until July 21, 1955.

==Biography==
Stevens was born on July 31, 1899, in Fanwood, New Jersey to John Peters Stevens and Edna Ten Broeck. He attended Phillips Academy and graduated in 1917. After serving as a second lieutenant in the field artillery in World War I he attended and graduated from Yale University. He became president of J.P. Stevens and Company in 1929. It is now part of a conglomerate—WestPoint Home.

In 1941, Stevens attended a civilian course at the Army Command and General Staff School. In 1942, he was recalled to active duty in the Quartermaster Corps as a lieutenant colonel. Promoted to colonel, he served in the United States during most of World War II except for a temporary assignment in Europe, returning to civilian life in 1945.

He served as chairman of The Business Council, then known as the Business Advisory Council for the United States Department of Commerce in 1951 and 1952.

On January 29, 1953, Stevens was nominated to be Secretary of the Army by President Dwight Eisenhower and appeared for a hearing before the Senate Committee on Armed Services that same day. After confirmation, he came into conflict with Senator Joseph McCarthy over a series of issues that ultimately led to the Army-McCarthy hearings of 1954. In the fall of 1953, McCarthy began an investigation into the United States Army Signal Corps laboratory at Fort Monmouth. McCarthy&#x27;s aggressive questioning of army personnel was damaging to morale, but failed to reveal any sign of the &quot;dangerous spies&quot; that McCarthy alleged to exist. Next McCarthy investigated the case of Irving Peress, an Army dentist who had refused to answer questions in a loyalty-review questionnaire.

As various officers, scientists and other army staff were subjected to McCarthy&#x27;s often abusive questioning, Stevens was criticized for capitulating to many of McCarthy&#x27;s demands and not supporting his men.

Concurrent with these events, McCarthy&#x27;s chief counsel, Roy Cohn, had been pressuring the army, including Stevens, to give preferential treatment to his friend G. David Schine, who had recently been drafted. The Army-McCarthy hearings were held to investigate the Army&#x27;s charge that McCarthy and Cohn were making improper demands on behalf of Schine, and McCarthy&#x27;s counter charge that the Army was holding Schine &quot;hostage&quot; in an attempt to halt McCarthy&#x27;s investigations into the Army. During the hearings, McCarthy questioned Stevens for several days. Although Stevens is generally considered to have handled the hearings poorly, it was McCarthy who fared worst in the month-long investigation. The exposure before a television audience of McCarthy&#x27;s methods and manners during the hearings are credited with playing a major role in his ultimate downfall. Stevens wanted to resign after the incident but Vice-President Richard Nixon convinced him not to.

==J. P. Stevens &amp; Company==
Robert T. Stevens had a fifty-year career with J. P. Stevens &amp; Company—named after New York-based John Peter Stevens who made his fortune by selling the products of his grandfather&#x27;s Massachusetts-based family business which dated back to the War of 1812. Under John Peter Stevens it became one of the largest textile companies in the United States with mills in the North and South. By the age of thirty Robert T. Stevens was president of the company. During his tenure it was &quot;one of the world&#x27;s largest, most diversified textile organizations.&quot; He left Stevens for two-years to serve as Secretary of the Army and by July 1955 he returned to Stevens where he remained until his retirement. He became director emeritus in 1974.

Like many other companies in post-World War II United States, Stevens moved the company south specifically because he &quot;wanted to pay lower wages and avoid unions.&quot;

By 1963 Stevens was the second-largest company in the United States with 36,000 employees—mainly in the Southern states. For that reason it was selected by the union as the target of a major organizing campaign. Stevens&#x27;s employees earned &quot;wages that were well below the manufacturing average, and they had few benefits.&quot; Stevens resented his company being singled out by the union, and made an aggressive stand. From 1963 to 1980 the company and the union entered into a bitter struggle that became known as the J. P. Stevens campaign or controversy.

==Personal life==
His children include Bob Stevens from Helena, Montana, J. Whitney Stevens from New York, and Tom Stevens from Florida. The family still owns an est. cattle ranch called the American Fork in Two Dot, Montana.

Stevens died on January 30, 1983, in Edison, New Jersey. He was buried at the West Point Cemetery on February 3, 1983.

<text>The following is the 1962–63 network television schedule for the three major English language commercial broadcast networks in the United States. The schedule covers primetime hours from September 1962 through August 1963. The schedule is followed by a list per network of returning series, new series, and series cancelled after the 1961–62 season.

==Summary==
Television historians Harry Castleman and Walter Podrazik (1982) state, &quot;Despite all the promises of programming reform made by television executives in May, 1961&quot; (the month of Newton Minow&#x27;s landmark speech &quot;Television and the Public Interest&quot;), &quot;the 1962–63 schedule turned out to be business as usual&quot;. Castleman and Podrazik point out that although the three networks had added generally well-made public-affairs and news programs to their schedules, there were &quot;too many of them and their sheer number diluted the audience and stretched resources far too thin to allow quality productions each week&quot;. CBS aired &quot;CBS Reports&quot; and &quot;Eyewitness&quot;, NBC broadcast &quot;Chet Huntley Reporting&quot;, &quot;David Brinkley&#x27;s Journal&quot; and &quot;Actuality Specials&quot;, while ABC had &quot;Bell and Howell Close-up&quot; and the &quot;Howard K. Smith&quot; show. Despite Minow&#x27;s complaints that the sitcoms of the era were &quot;totally unrealistic&quot; and his disdain for cartoons, the new sitcoms of 1962 were even more hostile to Minow&#x27;s stated taste and were frequently &quot;stretching further than ever for their situations&quot;; increasingly fantastical premises such as hillbillies in the city (&quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot;) and cartoons set a century into the future (&quot;The Jetsons&quot;, ABC&#x27;s first regularly-scheduled TV series to air in color) were among the new offerings.

This was the first season that ABC aired some of their prime-time programs in color.

<text>The Nunc dimittis (), also known as the Song of Simeon or the Canticle of Simeon, is a canticle taken from the second chapter of the Gospel of Luke, verses 29 to 32. Its Latin name comes from its incipit, the opening words, of the Vulgate translation of the passage, meaning &quot;Now you let depart&quot;. Since the 4th century it has been used in Christian services of evening worship such as Compline, Vespers, and Evensong.

==Biblical account==
The title is formed from the opening words in the Latin Vulgate, &quot;&quot; (&quot;Now thou dost dismiss thy servant, O Lord&quot;). Although brief, the canticle abounds in Old Testament allusions. For example, &quot;Because my eyes have seen thy salvation&quot; alludes to Isaiah 52:10.

According to the narrative in Luke 2:25–32, Simeon was a devout Jew who had been promised by the Holy Spirit that he would not die until he had seen the Messiah. When Mary and Joseph presented the baby Jesus to the Temple in Jerusalem for the ceremony of redemption of the firstborn son (after the time of Mary&#x27;s purification: at least 40 days after the birth, and thus distinct from the circumcision), Simeon was there. He took Jesus into his arms and uttered words rendered variously as follows:

==Versions==
The &quot;Nunc dimittis&quot; passage in the original Koiné Greek:
Transliterated:
Latin (Vulgate):
English (Translation of the Vulgate):
English (&quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;, 1662):
English (Roman Breviary):

The &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; (1662) was derived from the King James Version (1611) of the Bible. Its text for this canticle is the same as in the prayer book, except for the last line. The Bible () reads: &quot;A light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of thy people Israel.&quot;

Church Slavonic (in Cyrillic)


==Commentary==

Writing in the early 20th century, Friedrich Justus Knecht concludes from this passage that &quot;belief in Jesus Christ drives away all fear of death.&quot; He writes:

Simeon now rejoiced at the prospect of death. Such a sensation was hitherto unknown in Israel. &quot;Pious Israelites closed their eyes in death, weary of life and submissive to God’s will; not altogether hopeless, but full of horror of the future. Death was a thing to be feared, and each new day of life which was granted was looked on as a gain&quot; (Grimm). But all at once every thing was changed. Holy Simeon had seen the Saviour, and was now ready to die joyfully. In fact, he did die very soon after; a pious tradition even goes so far as to say that he died before he left the Temple. He was thus the first to take the joyful news to Limbo that the Saviour was born and the day of salvation at hand.
While serving as Prefect at Georgetown College, English Jesuit Roger Baxter reflects on this passage in his 19th-century &quot;Meditations&quot;, saying: &quot;Oh that you would also bid farewell to all earthly things, and say with the Apostle, &#x27;But I am straitened — having a desire to be dissolved, and to be with Christ.&#x27; (Phil. 1:23.)&quot;

==Liturgical and musical settings==
The &quot;Nunc Dimittis&quot; is the traditional &quot;Gospel Canticle&quot; of Night Prayer (Compline), just as &quot;Benedictus&quot; and &quot;Magnificat&quot; are the traditional Gospel Canticles of Morning Prayer and Evening Prayer, respectively. The Nunc Dimittis is found in the liturgical night office of many western denominations, including Anglican Evensong in the 1662 &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;, Compline (A Late Evening Service) in the 1928 &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;, and the Night Prayer service in the Common Worship. Both the Catholic and Lutheran services of Compline include this canticle. In eastern tradition the canticle is included in Eastern Orthodox Vespers. 

In many Lutheran orders of service, the &quot;Nunc Dimittis&quot; may be sung following the reception of the Eucharist. A 1530 rhymed version by , &quot;Im Frieden dein, o Herre mein&quot;, with a melody by Wolfgang Dachstein, was written in Strasbourg for that purpose. Heinrich Schütz wrote at least two settings, one in Musikalische Exequien (1636), the other in Symphoniae sacrae II (1647). The feast day &quot;Mariae Reinigung&quot; was observed in the Lutheran Church in J. S. Bach&#x27;s time. He composed several cantatas for the occasion, including &quot;Mit Fried und Freud ich fahr dahin&quot;, BWV 125, a chorale cantata on Martin Luther&#x27;s paraphrase of the canticle, and &quot;Ich habe genug&quot;, BWV 82.

Many composers have set the text to music, usually coupled in the Anglican church with the Magnificat, as both the Magnificat and the Nunc dimittis are sung (or said) during the Anglican service of Evening Prayer according to the Book of Common Prayer, 1662. This prayer book merged the older offices of Vespers (Evening Prayer) and Compline (Night Prayer) into one service, which contained both Gospel canticles. In Common Worship, this is listed among &quot;Canticles for Use at Funeral and Memorial Services&quot; One of the most well-known settings in England is a plainchant theme by Thomas Tallis. Herbert Howells composed 20 settings of this pair of canticles, including the Gloucester Service (1947) and the St Paul&#x27;s Service (1951). A setting of the Nunc dimittis by Charles Villiers Stanford was sung as the recessional at the funeral of Margaret Thatcher. Stanford wrote many settings of both the &quot;Magnificat&quot; and &quot;Nunc dimittis&quot;.

The Genevan Psalter used by Calvinist churches also included the metrical versification for &quot;Nunc Dimittis&quot;. The music was composed by Louis Bourgeois and the lyrics were versified from the biblical text by Clément Marot.

A setting by British composer Geoffrey Burgon is featured during the end credits of episodes in the 1979 television adaptation of &quot;Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy&quot;.

Sergei Rachmaninoff wrote a setting of the Slavonic &quot;Nunc dimittis&quot; text, Ны́не отпуща́еши (&quot;Nyne otpushchayeshi&quot;), as the fifth movement of his &quot;All-Night Vigil.&quot; It is known for its final measures, in which the basses sing a descending scale ending on the B♭ below the bass clef.

The neoclassical electronic music group Mannheim Steamroller used the text of &quot;Nunc Dimittis&quot; in the song &quot;Lumen&quot; on their album Fresh Aire V, that was otherwise based on Johannes Kepler&#x27;s novel Somnium.

<doc id="794086" wikidata="Q1414579" url="?curid=794086" title="Tamil Script Code for Information Interchange">
<text>Tamil Script Code for Information Interchange (TSCII) is a coding scheme for representing the Tamil script. The lower 128 codepoints are plain ASCII, the upper 128 codepoints are TSCII-specific. After long years of being used on the Internet by private agreement only, it was successfully registered with the IANA in 2007.

TSCII encodes the characters in visual (written) order, paralleling the use of the Tamil Typewriter. Unicode, instead, uses the logical order encoding strategy for Tamil, following ISCII, in contrast to the case of Thai, where the visual order encoding grandfathered by TIS-620 was adopted.

The government of Tamil Nadu endorses its own TAB/TAM standards for 8-bit encoding and other, older encoding schemes can still be found on the web.

The free etext collection at Project Madurai uses the TSCII encoding, but has already started to provide Unicode versions.

==History==
The need for a common encoding for Tamil was felt by members of various mailing list based forums in mid-1990s, as there were multiple custom coded fonts were prevalent in those forums. While some of the commercial encodings were popular than the others, they were not accepted by wider community due to conflicting commercial interests. While Unicode was accepted by most as the future standard, most of the desktop systems at that time were still not capable of handling Unicode for Tamil language, and an interim 8-bit encoding was required.

A separate mailing list for discussion of such encodings (webmasters@tamil.net) was created in 1997 to initiate this discussion, starting with an email written by Dr.K.Kalyanasundaram to the popular Tamil author Sujatha who headed the committee for standardization of Tamil keyboard. This forum quickly attracted enthusiastic participants from across the globe, including several prominent Tamil scholars. Archives of these discussion are maintained by INFITT.

Subsequent to publishing TSCII, most of the members of webmasters@tamil.net mailing list became part of INFITT, which is a wider initiative to bring in standardization and continued development in various areas of Tamil computing.

==Codepage layout==


== Conversion Tools ==
Text encoded in UTF-8 can be converted to TSCII using the GNU iconv tools as follows,

$ iconv -f utf-8 -t tscii hello.utf8 &gt; hello.tscii

Whereas conversion from TSCII to UTF-8 is done by interchanging -f and -t flags.

=== Visual Application ===
An open source project is available at AnyTaFont2UTF8 is maintained by Isaiyini Tamil Community

<doc id="794088" wikidata="Q1779499" url="?curid=794088" title="Thembu">
<text>The Thembu () are a Xhosa Nation who inhabited the Kingdom of Thembuland. They were established around the 16th century as one of the Xhosa federations in the Transkeian territories. The federation was later annexed by British Empire shortly after the death of King Sarhili.

According to Xhosa oral tradition, the Hala clan migrated along the east coast of southern Africa before settling in KwaZulu-Natal. The earliest known Thembu ancestor is Chief Mbulali Ka-Nanzinzaba, whose grandson (named uMthembu KaNtongakazi), led his people from what became the South African province of KwaZulu-Natal to Dedesi in the present-day Transkei region of South Africa. The Thembu emerged as a single political entity during the reign of Nxeko, who settled in Dedesi and was awarded chieftainship by King Togu, who later also handed him independence to form a new Xhosa state. Famous descendants of Nxeko include members of the royal line of the Xhosa Kingdom and politicians like Nelson Mandela, whose father was a reigning nobleman from a junior branch of the AmaMadiba clan of kings, and Walter Sisulu.

==Name ==
In Xhosa, the name is &quot;abaThembu&quot; (&quot;aba-&quot; is a common prefix implying &quot;people&quot;). The territory of the Thembu state was historically known as Thembuland.

In the 19th century, Thembu were frequently known as the &quot;Tamboekie&quot; or &quot;Tambookie&quot; people. This name was originally the Khoisan language term specifically for the followers of Chief Maphasa who moved into the area west of the Great Kei River in the 1820s. However, Europeans used these terms as a synonym for &quot;Thembu&quot; for much of the 19th century.

==Origin==
Thembu was known as /Xam bu !e, /Xam and Embo people which makes /Xam bu !e in Xhosa it&#x27;s Thembu, the O became U for bu.

AbaThembu derives from /Xam ka !ue the meaning of /Xam is an Oryx or Antelope. The original name of AbaThembu was /Xam ka !eten (Antelope water people) in khoemana the word exists as /ehem it&#x27;s the same.

Thembu&#x27;s by a large portion spoke /Xam or /Xam ke an extinct language, The Basotho&#x27;s used to call Eastern Cape (Bathebu ke ing ke ma /Xam), it was known as a /Xam area. AbaThembu never originated from Central Africa the Thembu history never descended they ascended.

==/Xam and Thembu history==
The name ǂKhomani, now Queenstown, was a /Xam land, though /Xam land then became Thembuland. ǂkhomani people still exist in the Kalahari (!kung ra ma ba), which is Upington, Eastern Cape used to be a Cape Colony Queenstown (now called komani) is named after AmaQoma, Qoma means (A tree were a lion would rest). The Ntsundu people are Nǀuu people they exist in Northern Cape, Free State and Kalahari.

The definition of Thembu is /Xam bu !e. /Xam intermarried with Abambo a minority, not the majority of Abambo they build a relationship with them, that&#x27;s why today the /Xam bu !e, !e is a suffix when people say AbaThembu it is a Xhosa language it&#x27;s not a Indigenous language in Transkei they speak a different type of dialect which is not their own original dialect it&#x27;s a diversified dialect that kept connection with Abambo people. The original Thembu&#x27;s spoke five to six-click dialect.

Thembu&#x27;s always praises a phrase called Sopitso or Yem-Yem which means (/Xam - /Xam) it connects all the Madiba, Dlomo, Nxongo, and Qwithi people.

==History==
AbaThembu is a nation independent of AmaXhosa, from the eMbo/Aba-Mbo Empire. Zwide (&quot;Not of Ndwandwe&quot;) was the first man to leave eMbo, and he begot Malandela (&quot;not of AmaZulu years before&quot;), who settled in Mozambique, who begot Mbulali, who begot Njanye, who begot Mthembu.

Mthembu settled with his people in a place known as Mbabane in Swaziland and then went to kwaMsinga in Natal where he got two sons, Ndilo and Mvelase also known as Qudeni. He founded the tribe known as Abathembu BakwaMvelase. Ndilo left and died in a place known as Msana in Eastern Cape Ndilo&#x27;s sons were Ntongakazi (dumakazi), Bhomoyi, Mncotshe, Mdlane, Qoma, and Jali. The houses of Mdlane and Jali, Qoma, Mncotshe were unimportant because their mothers were commoners. The only houses that were respected were the houses of Bhomoyi and Ntongakazi also known as Dumakazi both their mothers came from Royal houses.

Bhomoyi left Msana to Lesotho to a place known as Qacha&#x27;s Nek he got into a battle with the Basotho&#x27;s and won his newfound land when Bhomoyi confiscated land Basotho came to ask him to leave so that they could continue to farm on their land Bhomoyi replied (Andizuhamba de ndizobe ndibhentselwa zintombi zabesotho) meaning I won&#x27;t leave until I&#x27;m awarded young Basotho women, The messenger went back to the Basotho King and returned with fifteen Basotho women this is where Isiduko Zabathembu got the phrase (&quot;VelaBembhentsele&quot;). Bhomoyi begot Ceduma who begot Mguti who begot Mngxongo and a daughter named Khazeka whose mother came from Mpondo royal family and who begot Ntoyi in the right-hand house whose mother was a commoner.

Khazeka is one of the two woman names mentioned in the history of AbaThembu because of their fearlessness and victories in unifying and stabilizing the Kingdom. Amagorhakazi esizwe saBathembu.

One day, Mtshutshumbe&#x27;s section of AmaXesibe had to pass by the land of AbaThembu to reach AmaGcaleka. But because AbaThembu namaXesibe had some history, Mtshutshumbe decided to hide his Xesibe identity by calling his people AmaQwathi, named after a cow that was used at his graduation from initiation school.

After they arrived, they presented a tribute of cattle to Mnguti in exchange for land, which they got eNgcobo. Mguti then told his son Mngxongo to confiscate their land, and when he had done so, amaQwathi gave him cattle that were all black, which is preserved in iziduko zamaNgxongo Ntsundu(these were the cattle&#x27;s colors).

It then happened that Mngxongo didn&#x27;t return and his father Mguti got lost searching for him to crown him as the next King and he drowned with his dogs in the Qethume River.

Mngxongo&#x27;s heir was Mphosesebeni, who was refused his place on the throne by the royal family. And to this day when Mguti and Mngxongo names are mentioned, it gets awkward ebaThenjini because the rightful king was overlooked.

Mphosesebeni&#x27;s uncle Ntoyi, who had usurped the royal throne begot Ntande and Zima. When Ntoyi passed on, Zima succeeded him as regent for the young Ntande. This is when amaTola arrived led by Mkhume and his brother. They are the ones who introduced the use of spears to abaThembu.

Ntande took over the reins after Zima&#x27;s death, and he begot Ngxeko, Maya, and the twins Qithi and Cube. During the 16th century, Ngxeko led the migration from Dedesi to Msana in the Mthatha district.

Ngxeko was the first legitimate king of abaThembu because he was the one who assimilated various fragments from tribes such as amaBomvana, amaVundle, amaMpondomise, and amaMfengu to build his kingdom. Nxekwa begot Hlanga by a Mpondo woman of the Mqiha clan, and Dlomo who is the eldest from another wife, as well as twins Balisa and Ndungwana, from a third wife.

All these women had not been classified into different ranks from major to minor. But it was clear that Hlanga, whose mother was a princess, was most likely to be the royal successor.

Just at that time, AmaMfene came asking to be incorporated into the Thembu nation. They were duly received and Ndungwana was instructed to allocate sites to them.

Ndungwana never returned from his mission, instead, he remained with the strangers, enjoying all the respect that was accorded him, and he installed himself as their Nkosi.

Whenever Dlomo slaughtered a cow, he would send inxaxheba (the right hindquarter) to Ndungwana, his junior, and then Hlanga would also send his nxaxheba to his junior Balisa which was a popular costume that displayed royal authority.

One day cows were slaughtered in the homes of both Dlomo and Hlanga. Dlomo decided to share meat with Welangaye, a maiden from the Mpemvu clan, and she burst out in praise of how Dlomo had basically installed himself as King and left shedding tears of joy.

Before the British conquest in the 19th century, the Thembu had an independent kingdom. The Xhosa clan name of the Thembu kings is Ntlazi aNkosiyane. Recent kings, Buyelekhaya Zwelibanzi Dalindyebo including Sabata Jonguhlanga Dalindyebo, took the surname Dalindyebo, after a 19th-century king.

After the conquest, the Thembu came under the government of the Cape Colony as part of Transkei. Except for a few missionaries and traders, Transkei was a Bantustan. The Transkei remained a Bantustan under apartheid and was regarded, along with Ciskei, as the homeland of the Xhosa people.

==Great House==
The great house of AbaThembu is called Eastern Thembu at Bumbane Great Palace and is situated in Mthata, Eastern Cape.
The right-hand house is called Western Thembu at Qamata Great Palace and is situated in Cofimvaba, Eastern Cape.
The Western Thembu&#x27;s house enjoyed autonomy for decades and was often referred to as the right-hand house, while the Eastern Thembu&#x27;s house was referred to as the great house.
King Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo, son of King Sabata Jonguhlanga Dalindyebo, became the King of AbaThembu Nation in May 1989; his praise name is Aa! Zwelibanzi !.

==The invasion of Thembuland==

When King Moshoeshoe I of Basotho invaded Thembuland in search of more cattle, he went along with his younger brother Magabane and Morosi, his great friend and the King of BaPhuthi. Moshoeshoe then instructed Magabane to go and raid for cattle at Ngubengcuka’s Royal Estate, while he and Morosi relaxed on a mountain near Ngcobo. When Magabane was returning with some cattle, Ngubengcuka&#x27;s regiments gave him a tough time, but unfortunately they failed to stop him.

The AbaThembu gradually built their regiments as more and more warriors responding to the war drum kept on joining them. They attacked Basotho repeatedly but were repulsed every time. Just as Magabane was about to ascend eLuhewini mountain with the cattle, a joint Army of AmaHala and AmaQwathi arrived at Basotho with their small axes and reaped havoc on the limbs of the enemy, but they were thrown into confusion as AbaThembu attacked from behind.

After some time Basotho gave in and sought refuge in a forest. Ngubengcuka instructed his army to completely expel Basotho from his Kingdom, but one of the men informed him that they had run out of weapons. Ngubengcuka then told them to get wood from the forest and make clubs. At once the orders of the King were carried out, Basotho were driven out of the forest with sticks and clubs and Magabane was fatally wounded.

When the fight reached Moshoeshoe, he put up no resistance and joined the flight into a nearby forest, which Ngubengcuka ordered his men to surround at once. Evening soon approached and because of the darkness, the AbaThembu could not drive the Basotho out of the forest. By the following morning there was not a single Mosotho in the forest, as they had all escaped in that way. Moshoeshoe was defeated by King Ngubengcuka.

The forest was renamed Nduku, meaning (stick to commemorate how they were used to drive out Basotho who very nearly perished in Thembuland). At the time when everything was under control in King Ngubengcuka’s country, there was no nation that dared to touch him, and his power was accepted and recognized by all.

== King ==
Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo, son of Sabata Jonguhlanga Dalindyebo, became the Thembu king in May 1989; his praise name is &quot;Zwelibanzi&quot;. Sabata deposed Kaiser Matanzima, whom the government had installed and who advocated against South African liberation movements. In December 2009, King Buyelekhaya was convicted of offenses including culpable homicide, kidnapping, arson and assault. In response, he proposed secession from South Africa, and later demanded that the government pay Dalindyebo R900 million and the tribe a further R80 billion in compensation for the humiliation caused by his criminal trial.

Dalindyebo was imprisoned in December 2015. He was also dethroned and was expected to be administratively dethroned.

Prince Azenathi Dalindyebo, Buyelekhaya&#x27;s heir, has served as the acting king of the tribe since 2016.

On 23 December 2019, following president Cyril Ramaphosa&#x27;s Day of reconciliation speech, the abaThembu king was released from prison after serving one-third of his sentence.

<doc id="794097" wikidata="Q1239620" url="?curid=794097" title="Giant Haystacks">
<text>Martin Austin Ruane (10 October 1946 – 29 November 1998) was a British professional wrestler of Irish parentage, best known by the ring name Giant Haystacks. He was one of the best-known wrestlers on the British wrestling scene in the 1970s and 1980s. He also worked in Canada and the United States under the name Loch Ness Monster or simply Loch Ness.

Ruane was known for his massive physical size, billed as standing 6 ft 11 inch (2.11 m) tall and weighing from at the beginning of his career to by the end of it; at his heaviest, he weighed . In the 1970s he formed a heel team with Big Daddy. After Big Daddy turned face and the team broke up, the two engaged in a long-running, high drawing feud. During his career, Ruane held the European Heavyweight Championship and British Heavyweight Championship in the UK, and won the Stampede International Tag Team Championship in Canada, with the Dynamite Kid.

==Early life==
Ruane was born in Camberwell, London, on 10 October 1946. He weighed 14 lbs and 6 oz at birth. His father was from Ballyhaunis, County Mayo, Ireland. In 1949, when he was three years old, Ruane and his family moved from London to Broughton in Salford, Lancashire, which remained his home. He attended St. Thomas&#x27; School until he left aged 14. He worked as a scraper driver building motorways, and as a nightclub bouncer before a friend suggested he take up wrestling.

==Professional wrestling career==
Ruane began wrestling in 1967, initially for the independent WFGB as &quot;Luke McMasters&quot; (later incorrectly reported as being his legal name). In the early 1970s, Ruane worked for Wrestling Enterprises (of Birkenhead), where he was billed as &quot;Haystacks Calhoun&quot;, after the American wrestling star William Calhoun who had wrestled under that name in and the World Wide Wrestling Federation. Ruane&#x27;s name was subsequently modified to &quot;Giant Haystacks&quot;.

In summer 1975, he moved to Joint Promotions, where he formed a heel tag team with Big Daddy (also a heel at this point). Haystacks&#x27; TV debut came in July that year, when he and Daddy teamed up against the brothers Roy and Tony St. Clair, losing by disqualification. Although mainly known as brutal superheavyweight heels who crushed blue-eye opponents, they also had a major feud with masked fellow heel Kendo Nagasaki.

Daddy in particular heard cheers during this feud and eventually completed a turn to blue eye. This was cemented when Haystacks and Daddy broke up their tag team in 1977 and feuded with each other, with Haystacks remaining as the heel, resulting in high ratings on Britain&#x27;s ITV Saturday sports show &quot;World of Sport&quot; any time they battled one another and establishing Haystacks as a household name during the 1970s and 1980s.

On television, the feud began when the two reached the finals of a September 1977 four-man knockout tournament only for Haystacks to walk out in the opening seconds of the final match. A November rematch between the two saw Daddy score a first fall early in Round One before Haystacks contrived to cause the referee to be crushed between himself and Daddy, resulting in a no contest. Subsequent televised tag matches at Christmas that year and through 1978 would mostly result in Haystacks abandoning his partner to concede the losing falls to Daddy (although on one occasion in August 1978 Haystacks would return to knock out Daddy&#x27;s tag partner Gary Wensor for a rare 2-1 victory.) Haystacks would be in Mighty John Quinn&#x27;s corner for his loss to Daddy at Wembley Arena in 1979 and would himself lose to Daddy at the same venue in 1981. From time to time in the 1980s, either man would turn up at the conclusion of the other&#x27;s televised match to issue a challenge for a further singles bout. The feud would continue on and off, generally in tag team matches, until Daddy&#x27;s retirement in December 1993.

Meanwhile, on 23 November 1978 at the Royal Albert Hall, Haystacks captured the British Heavyweight Championship from Tony St. Clair by splashing St.Clair in the knees to win by a technical knockout. He lost the title back to St. Clair in April 1979 at the same venue by disqualification. On 5 February 1991 in an angle at a TV taping for S4C&#x27;s &quot;Reslo&quot; show in Machynlleth, Wales, Haystacks issued a challenge to Pat Roach - having just been disqualified in a tag match (later released on VHS on the &quot;Wrestling Madness&quot; compilation) pitting himself and Drew McDonald against Roach and Robbie Brookside - for Roach&#x27;s European Heavyweight Championship. Haystacks defeated Roach for the title the following night February 6 in Llantrisant, Glamorgan Wales but lost it back to Roach later that year. In late 1991 at Fairfield Hall, Croydon Haystacks faced Nagasaki in a match - filmed for a BBC2 &quot;Arena&quot; documentary on Nagasaki - for what was said to be the CWA World Heavyweight Championship (in fact held at the time by Rambo) and was awarded the match and the championship when Nagasaki, suffering from cracked ribs, withdrew from the match and fled to the dressing room after being unmasked. Haystacks made sporadic defences of his title during 1992-1993 and he and Nagasaki continued their enmity, sometimes in tag matches where Haystacks teamed with lesser superheavyweight Scrubber Daly (Malcolm Hardimann) until Nagasaki&#x27;s 1993 retirement. At this point manager Lloyd Ryan and Nagasaki impersonator King Kendo took over the feud, lasting until Haystacks&#x27;s 1996 WCW debut. Indeed, prior to receiving his call-up for WCW, Haystacks had been advertised to face King Kendo in a lumberjack match at the same early 1996 Croydon show as was headlined by a troupe of Michinoku Pro wrestlers in a six man tag match.

Haystacks also wrestled all over the world. Ruane wrestled in Calgary, Alberta, Canada for Stu Hart&#x27;s Stampede Wrestling promotion as the &quot;Loch Ness Monster&quot;, managed by J.R. Foley from Wigan, England (alias John Foley, alumnus of Billy Riley&#x27;s &quot;Wigan Snakepit&quot; wrestling school). He also worked for the CWA in Germany and Austria, winning several trophy tournaments there, as well as in India, South Africa where he feuded with local fan favourite Jan Wilkins and Zimbabwe, where he was made an honorary citizen.

In January 1996, after spending time as a debt-collector in Manchester, selling cars, and undergoing knee surgery, Ruane debuted in the United States for World Championship Wrestling, under the ring name &quot;Loch Ness&quot;. He served as a member of the Dungeon of Doom who were at that time, feuding with Hulk Hogan. However, the feud was short-lived, ending abruptly when Ruane was diagnosed with lymphoma and returned to Britain. His last match was against The Giant at WCW Uncensored 1996, where he would lose in a short match.

== Personal life ==
Ruane, a private person, was a devout Catholic and refused to wrestle on Sundays. He claimed to have eaten three pounds of bacon and a dozen eggs every morning to maintain his strength. Ruane married his childhood sweetheart Rita Boylan at the age of 17 in 1965. They had three sons, Martin, Stephen, and Noel. All of them worked in construction.

==Death==
On 29 November 1998, Ruane died of lymphoma at his home in Prestwich, Greater Manchester. He was 52, and was survived by his wife Rita and three sons.

==Other media==
Ruane appeared in the films &quot;Quest for Fire&quot; (1981) and &quot;Give My Regards to Broad Street&quot; (1984); the latter was written by Paul McCartney, who was a fan of Ruane, and both were later lifelong friends. Roy Jenkins, Elizabeth the Queen Mother, and Frank Sinatra were also fans of Ruane.

In 1990, he also appeared on S4C in an episode of the Welsh language soap opera &quot;Pobol y Cwm&quot;, as himself when he came to the valley for a wrestling match with El Bandito (Orig Williams).

Ruane released a single titled &quot;Baby I Need You&quot; in 1983.

A play by Brian Mitchell and Joseph Nixon, &quot;Big Daddy vs Giant Haystacks&quot;, was performed at the Brighton Festival Fringe between 26 and 28 May 2011.

Manic Street Preachers mention Giant Haystacks in their song &quot;Me and Stephen Hawking&quot; from their ninth studio album &quot;Journal for Plague Lovers&quot; (2009).

In late 2021 a Giant Haystacks Retro figure was released by Chella Toys. There was a blue and brown variant for 2022 release.

In February 2022 writer Rob Cope released a memoir &quot;Giant Haystacks: My Heavyweight Hero&quot; via online publisher lulu.com detailing his meetings with Haystacks, then in the last months of his life and the story the wrestler had told him of his life and career. The book was released to raise funds for the Christie Cancer Hospital in Manchester.

Archival footage has been used when promoting various WWE events, including a video package during Clash at the Castle: Scotland on June 15, 2024, when William Regal hosted a short video package discussing the history of British wrestling.

<doc id="794110" wikidata="Q1436746" url="?curid=794110" title="Bakırçay">
<text>Bakırçay (, ) is a river in Turkey. It rises in the Gölcük Dağları mountains and debouches into the Gulf of Çandarlı.

In antiquity, the Bakırçay was or formed part of the &quot;Kaikos&quot; or &quot;Caicus&quot; River which flowed near the city of Pergamon and was the site of the Battle of the Caecus River. The Kaikos River is mentioned by Hesiod and Plutarch, who claims that its name was originally Astraeus (Ἀστραῖος) but was changed after Caicus, a son of Hermes, threw himself into it after sleeping with his sister Alcippe. However, since the course of the river has changed since antiquity it is not clear how the ancient names apply to the modern geographical features. Leake infers from the direction of L. Scipio&#x27;s march from Troy to the Hyrcanian plain, that the Caicus was the north-eastern branch of the river of Pergamon which flows by Menduria (possibly Gergitha) and Balıkesir (Caesaraea). The Caicus as it seems is formed by two streams which meet between 50 and 65 km above its mouth, and it drains an extensive and fertile country. Strabo (p. 616) says that the sources of the Caicus are in a plain separated by the range of Temnos from the plain of Apiae, and that the plain of Apia lies above the plain of Thebe in the interior. He adds that there also flows from Tetanus a river (the Mysius) which joins the Caicus below its source. The Caicus enters the sea approximately 12 km from Pitane, and 3 km from Elaea. Elaea was the port of Pergamon, which was on the Caicus, approximately 25 km from Elaea. 

The Bakırçay is one of the two candidates for the Hittite placename &quot;Seha River&quot;, site of the Seha River Land known from texts such as the Manapa-Tarhunta letter. The Gediz River is the other candidate.

<doc id="794111" wikidata="Q148745" url="?curid=794111" title="Spiraea">
<text>Spiraea , sometimes spelled spirea in common names, and commonly known as meadowsweets or steeplebushes, is a genus of about 80 to 100 species of shrubs in the family Rosaceae. They are native to the temperate Northern Hemisphere, with the greatest diversity in eastern Asia.

The genus formerly included the herbaceous species now segregated into the genera &quot;Filipendula&quot; and &quot;Aruncus&quot;; recent genetic evidence has shown that &quot;Filipendula&quot; is only distantly related to &quot;Spiraea&quot;, belonging in the subfamily Rosoideae.

==Description==


&quot;Spiraea&quot; plants are , deciduous-leaved shrubs. The leaves are simple and usually short stalked, and are arranged in a spiralling, alternate fashion. In most species, the leaves are lanceolate (narrowly oval) and about long. The leaf margins are usually toothed, occasionally cut or lobed, and rarely smooth. Stipules are absent.

The many small flowers of &quot;Spiraea&quot; shrubs are clustered together in inflorescences, usually in dense panicles, umbrella-like corymbs, or grape-like clusters. The radial symmetry of each flower is fivefold, with the flowers usually bisexual, rarely unisexual. The flowers have five sepals and five white, pink, or reddish petals that are usually longer than the sepals. Each flower has many (15 to 60) stamens. The fruit is an aggregate of follicles.

==Ecology==
&quot;Spiraea&quot; species are used as food plants by the larvae of many Lepidoptera species, including the brown-tail, the small emperor moth, the grey dagger, the setaceous Hebrew character, and the moth &quot;Hypercompe indecisa&quot;.

The leaves of &quot;S. betulifolia&quot; are eaten by blue grouse in spring, and the plant is browsed by deer in summer.

==Uses==

=== Food ===
Native Americans ate the species &quot;S. betulifolia&quot;.

===Horticulture===

Many species of &quot;Spiraea&quot; are used as ornamental plants in temperate climates, particularly for their showy clusters of dense flowers. Some species bloom in the spring, others in midsummer.

The following species, hybrids and cultivars are among those found in cultivation:

*&quot;S.&quot; &#x27;Arguta&#x27;
*&quot;S. betulifolia&quot;
*&quot;S. canescens&quot;
*&quot;S. cantoniensis&quot;
* &quot;S.&quot; × &quot;cinerea&quot;
*&quot;S. douglasii&quot;
*&quot;S. japonica&quot;
*&quot;S. nipponica&quot;
*&quot;S. prunifolia&quot;
*&quot;S.&quot; × &quot;pseudosalicifolia&quot;
*&quot;S. salicifolia&quot;
*&quot;S.&quot; &#x27;Snow White&#x27;
*&quot;S. thunbergii&quot;
*&quot;S. trichocarpa&quot;
*&quot;S.&quot; × &quot;vanhouttei&quot;
*&quot;S. veitchii&quot;
&quot;Spiraea&quot; &#x27;Arguta&#x27; (bridal wreath) and &quot;Spiraea&quot; × &quot;cinerea&quot; &#x27;Grefsheim&#x27; have won the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

===Traditional medicine===
&quot;Spiraea&quot; contain salicylates. Acetylsalicylic acid was first isolated from &quot;Filipendula ulmaria,&quot; a species at the time classified in the genus &quot;Spiraea&quot;. The word &quot;aspirin&quot; was coined by adding &quot;a-&quot; (for acetylation) to &quot;spirin&quot;, from the German &quot;Spirsäure&quot;, a reference to &quot;Spiraea&quot;.

Native American groups have various medicinal uses for local &quot;Spiraea&quot; species. &quot;S. betulifolia&quot; is used for abdominal pain and made into a tea. The Blackfoot use &quot;S. splendens&quot; root in an enema and to treat venereal conditions.

===Other===
Native Americans found &quot;S. douglasii&quot; useful for making brooms and hanging seafood to cook.

<doc id="794112" wikidata="Q7539815" url="?curid=794112" title="Sleeper hit">
<text>In the entertainment industry, a sleeper hit refers to a film, television series, music release, video game, or other entertainment product that was initially unsuccessful on release but eventually became a surprise success. A sleeper hit may have had little to no promotion and/or lack a successful launch but gradually develops a fandom following media (especially social media) attention, which in turn increases its public exposure and public interest in the product. As &quot;Variety&quot; puts it, &quot;A &#x27;sleeper hit&#x27; can be defined as the kind of show that catches us by surprise—programs whose popularity grows over time and can ultimately outshine the preordained hits.&quot; A sleeper hit often lacks star performers or high production values, but prevails, at times against its own makers&#x27; expectations, on the strength of such qualities as narrative, approach, or novelty, as well as market accidents. Sleeper hit films benefit theater owners because the owners keep a larger percentage of money from ticket sales.

==In film==
Some sleeper hits in the film industry are strategically marketed for audiences subtly, such as with sneak previews a couple of weeks prior to release, without making them feel obliged to see a heavily promoted film. This alternative form of marketing strategy has been used in sleeper hits such as &quot;Sleepless in Seattle&quot; (1993), the Oscar winner &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; (1994), &quot;My Best Friend&#x27;s Wedding&quot; (1997), &quot;There&#x27;s Something About Mary&quot; (1998), &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot; (1999), and &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; (1999).

Screenings for these films are held in an area conducive to the film&#x27;s demographic. In the case of &quot;Sleepless in Seattle&quot;, a romantic comedy, screenings were held at suburban shopping malls where romantic couples in their mid-20s to early 30s spent Saturday afternoons before seeing a new film. In theory, a successful screening leads to word-of-mouth marketing, as it compels viewers to discuss an interesting, low-key film with co-workers when they return to work after their weekend.

&quot;Easy Rider&quot; (1969), which was created on a budget of less than $400,000 (), became a sleeper hit by earning $50 million and garnering attention from younger audiences with its combination of drugs, violence, motorcycles, counter-culture stance, and rock music. It was also one of the successful films during the beginnings of the American New Wave of cinema.

&quot;The Rocky Horror Picture Show&quot; (1975) was considered a failure for the first 6 months of its release until it found popularity in midnight screenings afterwards.

&quot;A Christmas Story&quot; (1983) was initially a modest success with little promotion, but after Ted Turner purchased the MGM back-catalog a few years later and began rerunning the film on his cable networks every December, it became an iconic Christmas classic.

The 1979 Australian film &quot;Mad Max&quot;, which sprung from the Ozploitation movement and helped to popularize the post-apocalyptic dystopia genre, held the record for the biggest profit-to-cost ratio for several years until it was broken in 1999 by &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot;, also a sleeper hit.

The independent film &quot;Halloween&quot;, which played over the course of fall 1978 through fall 1979 and relied almost completely on word-of-mouth as marketing, was also a sleeper hit, having a box office take of $70 million on a budget of only $325,000. Its success caused other slasher films to try the same approach, although few fared as well since horror films heavily rely on opening weekend box office and quickly fall from theaters. Other notable examples of horror sleeper-hits to follow in &quot;Halloween&quot; wake include &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; in 1984, &quot;Scream&quot; in 1996, &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot; in 1999, &quot;Saw&quot; in 2004, and &quot;Paranormal Activity&quot; in 2007.

&quot;Hocus Pocus&quot; (1993) underperformed at the box office but eventually became a sleeper hit through television airings on the &quot;13 Nights of Halloween&quot; block on what is now Freeform.

&quot;The Iron Giant&quot; (1999) was a box-office failure due to lack of marketing from distributor Warner Bros., who did not have faith in the film. However, it received universal acclaim and earned a cult following once it arrived on home video and television, and is now considered a modern animation classic and one of the greatest animated films ever made.

&quot;Napoleon Dynamite&quot; made back its $500,000 budget and became a phenomenon in 2004, grossing almost $45 million within a year of its release, and became the basis for a short-lived animated series featuring the film’s entire cast.

&quot;The Peanut Butter Falcon&quot; (2019) also went on to become a sleeper hit, expanding the following weekend to 1,249 theaters and earning $3 million, as well as $1.1 million on Labor Day.

&quot;Puss in Boots: The Last Wish&quot; (2022) grossed $12.4 million in its opening weekend, and ultimately became a sleeper hit by March 2023.

&quot;Elemental&quot; (2023) originally opened below projections, earning $29.5 million in its opening weekend. However, positive word-of-mouth led the movie to become a sleeper hit by managing to make a drastic turnaround, with many news outlets praising Pixar Animation Studios&#x27; unprecedented box office comeback upon the film crossing $400 million worldwide by early August 2023, which ultimately became Disney&#x27;s biggest animated success during the COVID-19 pandemic. It also performed well internationally, particularly in South Korea, which became the film&#x27;s third-largest market. This was attributed to director Peter Sohn&#x27;s Korean-American background and the incorporation of elements that resonated with Korean audiences. Upon hearing this news, Sohn stated &quot;I think my heart burst with joy.&quot; By August 20, 2023, &quot;Elemental&quot; had surpassed &quot;Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse&quot;″s international box office total and in January 2024, the film received an Oscar nomination for Best Animated Feature.

&quot;Ruby Gillman, Teenage Kraken&quot; (2023) was a box-office bomb, grossing $46 million against a $70 million budget, losing projections of up to $80 million. However, it became a success on Netflix, beating out the competition, and caught on with the target audience, which was teens and young adults. &quot;Ruby Gillman, Teenage Kraken&quot; would reach the top of Netflix&#x27;s Top 10 and was seen by 12,300,000 viewers over the course of three weeks.

The romantic comedy &quot;Anyone but You&quot; (2023) also opened below projections. It was projected to gross around $7 million during its opening weekend, but opened to $6.3 million instead. However, the film experienced a gradual increase in weekend gross and stayed within the top five. The film led the box office from January 8, 2024 to January 11, which saw the debut of new films.

==In music==
Don Howard&#x27;s 1952 recording of &quot;Oh Happy Day&quot; was one of the earliest sleeper hits. Featuring only Howard&#x27;s baritone vocals and his acoustic guitar played at an amateur level, it was initially released regionally and was never expected to become a hit. A massive groundswell of support from teenagers in Howard&#x27;s home base of Cleveland, Ohio, led to the song rapidly rising in popularity, despite music industry scorn; cover versions (including one by Larry Hooper and the Lawrence Welk orchestra) were quickly rushed into production, and by 1953, there were no fewer than four hit recordings of the same song circulating, including Howard&#x27;s original.

The Romantics&#x27; 1980 single &quot;What I Like About You&quot; was a minor hit upon its release, charting at number 49 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in the United States, while not charting at all in the United Kingdom. It eventually became one of the most popular songs of the 1980s thanks to its use in various advertising campaigns.

The Waterboys 1985 single &quot;The Whole of the Moon&quot; charted initially in several countries on the lower end of charts including No. 26 in the UK. The song was re-released in 1991 to much acclaim peaking at No. 3 in the UK and No. 3 in Europe, and becoming certified platinum in the UK. The song became one of their most successful songs and well known.

The 1987 single &quot;Welcome to the Jungle&quot; by American rock band Guns N&#x27; Roses performed poorly in both the United States and the United Kingdom when first released in September of that year. As the band&#x27;s popularity grew steadily in 1988, it became a sleeper hit in the US and reached the top 10 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts. It was then re-released in the UK, charting within the top 40 there.

The 1990 single &quot;Somewhere Over the Rainbow/What a Wonderful World&quot; by Israel Kamakawiwoʻole became a sleeper hit after being featured in numerous film and TV soundtracks throughout the 2000s and 2010s, the song eventually charted across Europe in 2010 and 2011, finishing 16th on Germany&#x27;s decade-end charts for the 2010s.

Nirvana&#x27;s second album &quot;Nevermind&quot; was released in September 1991 with low expectations, hoping to sell 500,000 copies. The album entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 at number 144, but slowly climbed up the charts over the following months, entering the top 40 in November. The album was selling 300,000 copies a week by December, before in January 1992, it even replaced Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Dangerous&quot; at number 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts. The album went on to sell over 30 million copies worldwide, and has since become one of the world&#x27;s best-selling albums of all time.

&quot;Thank You&quot; by Dido was first featured in the movie &quot;Sliding Doors&quot; in 1998 and released as a single in September of 2000 but did not chart on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 until Eminem sampled the track for his hit single &quot;Stan&quot;, which helped propel &quot;Thank You&quot; and Dido&#x27;s debut album &quot;No Angel,&quot; which was released in 1999, to mainstream success. The single debuted on the chart at No. 80 in January 2001, and eventually peaked at number three in April 2001. &quot;No Angel&quot; entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 at No. 144, where it eventually reached its peak position of No. 4 on the chart.

Maroon 5&#x27;s debut studio album, &quot;Songs About Jane&quot;, was originally released in June 2002 but did not enter the chart until 11 months later in May 2003, where it underperformed on the chart, debuting at just No. 170, and staying beneath the top 40 for 8 months. However, with their popular hit single, &quot;This Love,&quot; released in 2004, and the equally popular follow-up, &quot;She Will Be Loved,&quot; both peaking at No. 5, with the former spending 14 weeks in the top ten and 43 weeks on the chart, it gave new hype for the album at the beginning of 2004, being certified platinum in February, and finally making the top 10 a month later.

The R&amp;B singer Raphael Saadiq&#x27;s classic soul-inspired album &quot;The Way I See It&quot; was a sleeper hit. Overlooked upon its release in 2008, it ended up charting for 41 weeks on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

&quot;Just Dance&quot; and &quot;Poker Face&quot; by pop singer Lady Gaga were both released in 2008 but did not become popular hits until the end of that year and the start of the next in some countries, including the USA and the UK, eventually becoming No. 1 hits in those countries. &quot;Poker Face&quot;, in particular, went on to become the world&#x27;s best-selling single of 2009 overall.

R&amp;B singer Miguel&#x27;s 2010 debut album &quot;All I Want Is You&quot; performed poorly at first, debuting at number 109 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with sales of 11,000 copies, while underpromoted by his record label. As its singles achieved radio airplay and Miguel toured in the record&#x27;s promotion, &quot;All I Want Is You&quot; became a sleeper hit and reached 404,000 copies sold by 2012. As of November 2017, the album has been certified platinum in the US.

&quot;Truth Hurts&quot; by Lizzo was released in September 2017, and did not chart until its appearance in the 2019 romantic comedy film &quot;Someone Great&quot; led to the single debuting at the number 50 position on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. As the song became a sleeper hit on the chart, the music video—featuring the singer in a &quot;wedding-gone-wild&quot; concept—went viral. By September 2019, the single had reached number one on the chart. The music video has been viewed over 290 million times as of August 2022. The single also benefited from its use in TikTok videos by users who lip-synced or referenced the lyric &quot;I just took a DNA test, turns out, I&#x27;m 100 percent that bitch&quot;. During its chart run, Gary Trust, the senior director of charts at &quot;Billboard&quot;, noted the rarity of a song topping the Hot 100 almost two years after its release, but explained that, &quot;in the digital era, it&#x27;s much easier than ever before for music fans to be exposed to older songs that might&#x27;ve been overlooked the first time around.&quot; According to &quot;Paper&quot; magazine&#x27;s Michael Love Michael, Lizzo&#x27;s sleeper hit can also be explained by a more inclusive popular media since the song&#x27;s original release: &quot;Black women are more visible than ever on magazine covers; fashion is having broader conversations about size, racial, and ethnic diversity. Lizzo&#x27;s presence in these spaces signals a future of greater inclusion.&quot;

Chappell Roan&#x27;s debut studio album &quot;The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess&quot; was not an immediate commercial success upon its release in September 2023, however, it began to garner a cult following due to Roan&#x27;s supporting act on Olivia Rodrigo&#x27;s Guts World Tour, her performances at music festivals like Coachella and Governors Ball, and the success of her follow-up single, &quot;Good Luck, Babe!&quot;. By June 2024, the album had peaked within the top ten on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Subsequently, several of its singles (&quot;Femininomenon&quot;, &quot;Casual&quot;, &quot;Pink Pony Club&quot;, &quot;Red Wine Supernova&quot;, and &quot;Hot to Go!&quot;) entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; Global 200 and the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 for the first time since their release.

By the mid-2020s, Lostwave wave was becoming a popular phenomenon on the internet, songs which have their origins discovered are likely to increase in popularity, most notably, &quot;Ulterior Motives&quot; by the Booth brothers and &quot;Subways of Your Mind&quot; by FEX (the later formerly known as &quot;The Most Mysterious Song on the Internet&quot;), whose careers were relaunched as a result of the discovery of their songs.

===TikTok===
The COVID-19 pandemic played a significant role in audiences&#x27; rediscovery of previously-released media, including music, primarily through video sharing service TikTok and other social media platforms. Songs which were released up to several years prior but failed to make an immediate impression commercially have gained renewed popularity and chart success. In September of 2023, &quot;Billboard&quot; introduced the new TikTok &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 50, which keeps track of songs from how many plays they get on TikTok. Examples of TikTok sleeper hits since 2020 include:

==In video games==
&quot;Pocket Monster Red&quot; and &quot;Green&quot; were released in 1996 in Japan, and later released as &quot;Pokémon Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot; in 1998. They followed several years of development and became sleeper hits. Believing it to be a one-time product, Nintendo initially shipped 200,000 copies, a relatively low amount. Most media ignored the games, but largely by word-of-mouth stemming from the hidden character Mew&#x27;s introduction, their popularity gradually spread throughout Japan, selling a million units by the end of 1996. They eventually became the best-selling video games ever in Japan, with 7.8 million copies sold, and 45 million sold worldwide. After becoming a national sensation in Japan, the franchise was introduced to the United States in September 1998, going on to start a worldwide craze dubbed &quot;Pokémania&quot;.

&quot;Portal&quot; was released in 2007 with little fanfare as part of the game compilation &quot;The Orange Box&quot;, but eventually became a &quot;phenomenon&quot;.

&quot;SteamWorld Dig&quot; (2013) was released on the 3DS by little-known developer Image &amp; Form. It became one of the first indie games mentioned in a Nintendo Direct, and ultimately sold over a million copies on all platforms. If the game had not succeeded, the studio would have been forced to close.

&quot;Among Us&quot; was released in June 2018 and received little mainstream attention at first, with the game only averaging at around 30 to 50 concurrent players. It received a sudden and significant jump in popularity in mid-2020 after being popularized by streamers on Twitch and YouTube. In November 2020, SuperData Research reported that the game had over half a billion users, proclaiming it to be &quot;by far the most popular game ever in terms of monthly players.&quot;

&quot;Helldivers 2&quot;, the sequel to &quot;Helldivers&quot; by developer Arrowhead Game Studios, began to have server issues because it was not designed to have a player base exceeding 250,000; at the time, the player base reached over 450,000. Because of its unforeseen success, &quot;Helldivers 2&quot; became one of the biggest sleeper hits of all time.

<text>The 1962 Canadian federal election was held on June 18, 1962, to elect members of the House of Commons of Canada of the 25th Parliament of Canada. The governing Progressive Conservative (PC) Party won a plurality of seats in this election, and its majority government was reduced to a minority government.

When the election was called, PC Prime Minister John Diefenbaker had governed for four years with the largest majority until then in the House of Commons in Canadian history.

This election reduced the PCs to a tenuous minority government as a result of economic difficulties such as high unemployment and a slumping Canadian dollar, as well as unpopular decisions such as the cancellation of the Avro Arrow. Despite the Diefenbaker government&#x27;s difficulties, the Liberal Party, led by Lester B. Pearson, was unable to make up enough ground in the election to defeat the government. For Social Credit, routed from the Commons just four years earlier, this election proved to be their most successful ever since they would never better the 30 seats won; for example, they lost seats in 1963 despite gaining a slightly better share of the vote.

This was the first election in which all adult Indigenous Canadians had the right to vote after the passage on March 31, 1960 of a repeal of certain sections of the Canada Elections Act.

For the first time ever, the entire landmass of Canada was covered by federal electoral districts (the former Mackenzie River riding was expanded to cover the entire Northwest Territories).

This was also the first general election contested by the New Democratic Party.

==Overview==
During its term of office, the Diefenbaker government had introduced reforms to social programs, a Canadian Bill of Rights, and other changes. The Tories tried to defend the decline in the Canadian dollar by pointing out the benefits to the tourism industry, exports, manufacturing and farming, and employment. They denied that the devaluation affected the price of bread, beef, gasoline and fruit and vegetables, saying that these prices were either set in Canada or were influenced by other factors.

The Liberals campaigned under the slogan, &quot;Take a stand for tomorrow,&quot; and attempted to portray the Diefenbaker government as &quot;feeble,&quot; with a divided cabinet. The Liberals criticized the PCs for their &quot;reckless mismanagement of finances,&quot; the slowdown in the Canadian economy, a lack of confidence in government policies, job losses, and a lower standard of living than in 1956. The Liberals also argued that the steep devaluation in the Canadian dollar was increasing the cost of living for Canadians.

The 1962 election was the first contested by the social democratic New Democratic Party, which had been formed from an alliance between the old Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) and the Canadian Labour Congress. The party chose longtime Premier of Saskatchewan Tommy Douglas as its first leader. The new party recovered ground lost by the CCF in the 1958 federal election, when it was nearly wiped out. It won almost 50% more votes than the CCF had ever managed, but it failed to achieve the major breakthrough that had been hoped for when the party was created.

The NDP was shut out in Saskatchewan, its political base, where Douglas failed to win his own seat. Douglas&#x27;s campaign was hurt by chaos in Saskatchewan brought about by the introduction of Medicare and a resulting strike by the province&#x27;s doctors. Douglas was forced to enter the House of Commons through a by-election in British Columbia. Despite the initial problems, Medicare proved popular, spread throughout the country, and is considered the NDP&#x27;s (and Douglas&#x27;) major contribution to the Canadian social fabric.

Social Credit returned to the House of Commons after being shut out in the 1958 election. While leader Robert N. Thompson and three other Socreds were elected in the party&#x27;s traditional base in western Canada, the party&#x27;s real success came in Quebec. Réal Caouette led the party&#x27;s Quebec wing to victory in 26 ridings. Indeed, their win of 30 seats overall represented the party&#x27;s greatest federal showing ever. They would never again equal, let alone surpass, that number—though the party gained its highest share of the vote in the 1963 election (1962 being its second-highest by a very close margin), it had a net loss of six seats.

The Socreds&#x27; success in Quebec was the result of several factors. Diefenbaker&#x27;s poor French impaired the Tories&#x27; ability to communicate their message to francophone voters. In 1958, the PCs had successfully compensated for that handicap by using the powerful electoral machine of the Union Nationale government under Maurice Duplessis. By 1962, Duplessis was dead and the Union Nationale had been toppled. Nevertheless, many francophone Quebecers remained hostile to the Liberals, and others had not yet warmed to the anglophone Pearson. Additionally, the controversy surrounding the new Liberal provincial government&#x27;s radical agenda of the Quiet Revolution badly hurt the Liberal brand in rural Quebec. Nevertheless, while the Liberals actually lost significant vote share in Quebec (they scored more than six percentage points less compared to 1958), the split in the centre-right vote meant they still managed a plurality there both in popular vote and seats. The Liberals actually gained ten seats in the province, despite the decline in vote share.

In the end, despite their large losses the Tories&#x27; major saving grace was that the Liberals were all but invisible in the west, winning only seven seats west of Ontario. This election thereby began a pattern of the Tories dominating the provinces west of Ontario by large margins (with only occasional breakthroughs by the Liberals and NDP), forcing the Liberals to rely on Ontario, Quebec and the Atlantic Provinces to garner a majority. That pattern would continue until the Tories&#x27; demise as a party of government three decades later. The Tories remained in power with the tacit support of the Socreds, as the two parties held enough seats between them to command a parliamentary majority. However, Diefenbaker declined to negotiate a more formal alliance between the two parties, which would ultimately prove costly and helped lead to the fall of his government the following year.

<text>Gunboat diplomacy is the pursuit of foreign policy objectives with the aid of conspicuous displays of naval power, implying or constituting a direct threat of warfare should terms not be agreeable to the superior force.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;gunboat diplomacy&quot; comes from the nineteenth-century period of imperialism, when Western powersfrom Europe and the United Stateswould intimidate other, less powerful entities into granting concessions through a demonstration of Western superior military capabilities, usually represented by their naval assets. A coastal country negotiating with a Western power would notice that a warship or fleet of ships had appeared off its coast. The mere sight of such power almost always had a considerable effect, and it was rarely necessary for such boats to use other measures, such as demonstrations of firepower.

A notable example of gunboat diplomacy, the Don Pacifico affair in 1850, saw the British Foreign Secretary Lord Palmerston dispatch a squadron of the Royal Navy to blockade the Greek port of Piraeus in retaliation for the assault of a British subject, David Pacifico, in Athens, and the subsequent failure of the government of King Otto to compensate the Gibraltar-born (and therefore British) Pacifico.

The effectiveness of such simple demonstrations of a nation&#x27;s projection of force capabilities meant that nations with naval power and command of the sea could establish military bases (for example, Diego Garcia, 1940s onwards)
and arrange economically advantageous relationships around the world. Aside from military conquest, gunboat diplomacy was the dominant way to establish new trade relationships, colonial outposts, and expansion of empire.

Peoples lacking the resources or technological innovations available to Western empires found that their own relationships were readily dismantled in the face of such pressures, and some therefore came to depend on the imperialist nations for access to raw materials or overseas markets.

== Theory ==
Diplomat and naval thinker James Cable spelled out the nature of gunboat diplomacy in a series of works published between 1971 and 1993. In these, he defined the phenomenon as &quot;the use or threat of limited naval force, otherwise than as an act of war, in order to secure advantage or to avert loss, either in the furtherance of an international dispute or else against foreign nationals within the territory or the jurisdiction of their own state.&quot; He further broke down the concept into four key areas:

* Definitive Force: the use of gunboat diplomacy to create or remove a fait accompli.
* Purposeful Force: application of naval force to change the policy or character of the target government or group.
* Catalytic Force: a mechanism designed to buy a breathing space or present policy makers with an increased range of options.
* Expressive Force: use of navies to send a political message. This aspect of gunboat diplomacy is undervalued and almost dismissed by Cable.

The term &quot;gunboat&quot; may imply naval power-projection - land-based equivalents may include military mobilisation (as in Europe in the northern-hemisphere summer of 1914), the massing of threatening bodies of troops near international borders (as practised by the German Reich in central Europe in the 1940s), or appropriately timed and situated military manoeuvres (&quot;exercises&quot;).

=== Distinctions ===
Gunboat diplomacy contrasts with views held prior to the 18th century and influenced by Hugo Grotius, who in &quot;De jure belli ac pacis&quot; (1625) circumscribed the right to resort to force with what he described as &quot;temperamenta&quot;.

Gunboat diplomacy is distinct from &quot;defence diplomacy&quot;, which is understood to be the peaceful application of resources from across the spectrum of defence to achieve positive outcomes in the development of bilateral and multilateral relationships. &quot;Military diplomacy&quot; is a sub-set of this, tending to refer only to the role of military attachés and their associated activity. Defence diplomacy does not include military operations, but subsumes such other defence activity as international personnel exchanges, ship and aircraft visits, high-level engagement (e.g., ministers and senior defence personnel), training and exercises, security-sector reform, and bilateral military talks.

==Modern contexts==

Gunboat diplomacy is considered a form of hegemony. As the United States became a military power in the first decade of the 20th century, the Rooseveltian version of gunboat diplomacy, Big Stick Diplomacy, was partially superseded by dollar diplomacy: replacing the big stick with the &quot;juicy carrot&quot; of American private investment. However, during Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s presidency, conventional gunboat diplomacy did occur, most notably in the case of the U.S. Army&#x27;s occupation of Veracruz in 1914, during the Mexican Revolution.

Gunboat diplomacy in the post-Cold War world is still largely based on naval forces, owing to the U.S. Navy&#x27;s overwhelming sea power. U.S. administrations have frequently changed the disposition of their major naval fleets to influence opinion in foreign capitals. More urgent diplomatic points were made by the Clinton administration in the Yugoslav wars of the 1990s (in alliance with the Blair administration) and elsewhere, using sea-launched Tomahawk missiles, and E-3 AWACS airborne surveillance aircraft in a more passive display of military presence. Henry Kissinger, during his tenure as United States Secretary of State, summed up the concept as thus: &quot;An aircraft carrier is 100,000 tons of diplomacy.&quot;

<text>Gaia Online is an English-language anime-themed social networking and forums-based website with Chibi-style animations. It was founded as go-gaia on February 18, 2003, by Derek Liu, Long Vo, Josh Gainsbrugh, and the name was changed to GaiaOnline.com in 2004 by its owner, Gaia Interactive. Gaia originally began as an anime linklist and eventually developed a small community, but following a statement by founder Derek Liu, the website moved towards social gaming and eventually became forum-based.

In 2007, over a million posts were made daily, and 7 million unique users visited each month (with over 26 million total registered users). Gaia also won the 2007 Webware 100 award in the Community category and was included in &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of 50 best websites in 2008. In January 2011, the company won the Mashable Best User experience Award for 2010.

==Avatars==
Members of Gaia Online, known as Gaians, receive a customizable avatar when they sign up. Users have the ability to customize their avatar in many ways, including skin tone, eye style and color, hairstyle and color, gender, race (e.g. human, vampire, elf, zombies), and attire. Numerous clothing items and accessories for avatars can be purchased from a range of NPC-run stores using the site currencies, Gaia Platinum and Gaia Cash. Players may also gift one another clothing items and accessories. Avatars appear next to posts in the forums and profile comments (the post itself encapsulated in a &quot;speech bubble&quot;), and in Gaia Towns and Gaia rallies, and other environments the avatar appears as a movable character that can travel from place to place, interacting with the environment (catching bugs, shaking trees, digging for buried treasure, collecting trash and flowers, etc.) and other users. In February 2018, an avatar based on on &quot;Doki Doki Literature Club!&quot; (&quot;DDLC!&quot;) main antagonist Monika was released to &quot;Gaia Online&quot; under the title &quot;Just Dangerous Me&quot;, the addition of which has been criticised by &quot;DDLC!&quot; creator Dan Salvato due to no permission having been sought and the skin being sold as downloadable content without compensation to Team Salvato.

==Forums==
There is a large variety of forums in which users can post it and communicate with one another. These forums are used for general discussion, news, announcements, role-play, general entertainment, and artist discussions.

==Economy==
===Currency===
The currency used in Gaia is known as &quot;Gaia Platinum&quot; (formerly, &quot;Gaia Gold&quot;). Platinum is regularly distributed to users as they browse around the website, post in the forums, play games, and participate in other various events and contests; the site also rewards users every day with random platinum or items from the Daily Chance. The former virtual currency was known as Gaia Gold, however, after a rapid increase in inflation after gold generating items were released, Gaia created Gaia Platinum and gave users the chance to switch to that currency.

In July 2007, Gaia released another virtual currency called &quot;Gaia Cash&quot;, which can be purchased with real money. Gaia Cash can be bought through cell phone payments, or directly from Gaia itself.

===AutoCash===
On September 13, 2010, Gaia announced the introduction of AutoCash. AutoCash is an optional feature where GaiaOnline members can sign up to buy Gaia Cash on a reoccurring monthly schedule. The current cost per month for the feature is $10; users are given extra content for the monthly fee. Staying past three months offers users the bonus of receiving special items. 

===Market===
Sales within the Gaian market can be divided into four areas: Gold Shops, Cash Shops, Trade, and Marketplace.
* &quot;Gold Shops&quot;: Items from these stores can be bought with Gold or Gaia Cash (most users purchase with Gold), and can range from regular store items to upmarket items. These are various NPC-run stores that sell a variety of items, such as avatar clothing and accessories, furniture for Gaia Houses, and parts for Gaia Cars. Items found in the shops can also be sold back to the shop for 50% of the shop price.
* &quot;Cash Shops&quot;: Items from these stores can be purchased with Gaia Cash only. The majority of Gaia Cash sales are from La Victoire, an NPC-run store that only accepts Gaia Cash. It specializes in high-end items such as &quot;Evolving Items&quot;, &quot;Random Item Generators&quot;, and &quot;Monthly Collectibles&quot;. Most items from La Victoire are continuously rotated in and out of the store. Other Cash-Only stores include &quot;Phin Phang&quot; (Gaia Aquarium items), and &quot;Back Alley Bargains&quot; (power-up items for Gaia&#x27;s MMORPG, &quot;zOMG!&quot;).
* &quot;Trade&quot;: Users can trade items and gold with other users. A majority of these trades are settled in the &quot;Gaia Exchange&quot; forum (and its sub-forums).
* &quot;Marketplace&quot;: The Marketplace is a separate area of the site for users to buy and sell items. Rather than self-auctioning an item through a thread in the Exchange forum, users can either put their item up for immediate sale with a &quot;Buy Now&quot; price, or leave their item for auction with a starting &quot;Bid&quot; price. Users can have up to 10 items for sale at once until getting the Tycoon achievement. After that, users can sell 20 items at once, and each item can be listed for a maximum of 14 days. The cost of this convenience is a 5% tax on all gold earned from sales.

The site&#x27;s virtual economy experienced hyperinflation after the introduction of more gold into circulation, partly due to the introduction of purchasable &#x27;gold generators&#x27; which generated daily gold automatically. These were introduced by the site&#x27;s then-owners in an attempt to boost the site&#x27;s short-term revenue. To maintain that revenue, new and bigger gold-generators were frequently introduced and an arms-race ensued between site users. This would eventually lead to the collapse of the economy, coupled with large declines in the userbase, and the ultimate sale of the site. Later owners substituted a replacement currency, Platinum, currently pegged at 1 Platinum to 10 million of the old Gold currency, and have not returned to currency generators as a way to raise revenue.
 However, former COO Jason Loia has stated he didn&#x27;t consider inflation as a significant issue.

===Notable items===
====Monthly Collectibles====
Monthly Collectibles (previously known as Donation Items, also referred on site as MCs) are special items that can be bought with real money meant to support Gaia&#x27;s maintenance and costs. Established in June 2003 after users of Gaia Online petitioned for a &quot;donation system&quot; in an attempt to increase site revenue, for every US$2.50 a user gives to the site, he or she receives an item known as a &quot;Sealed Envelope&quot; in his or her inventory.

Sealed Envelopes go on sale on the first day of every month and are released on the 15th of each month on. During August and September 2008, the envelopes were unsealed on the eighth, but on October 2, 2008, it was decided that the release date should be returned to the fifteenth. The Sealed Envelope disappears from the user&#x27;s inventory and is replaced by a &quot;Thank You Letter&quot; for the current paid month (for example, a &quot;Thank You Letter for August 2004&quot; represents a payment made in that month of that year). Users are then able to open these virtual letters to choose one of two or three limited-edition items to be granted into their inventory from each letter. These items were known as Donation Items until potential legal problems prompted the name change. Monthly Collectible items and the &quot;Thank You&quot; letter items they are found in are specific to the month that they were released in: for example, the items found in the &quot;Thank You&quot; letter for April 2006 can only be found in that letter, and one could only purchase that letter in April 2006.

Letters can be purchased over the phone, with a text message from a mobile phone, via PayPal, credit card, traditional mail or with Gaia Cash through the Cash Shop, &quot;La Victoire&quot;. Envelopes and letters can be later bought and sold through user trades or through Marketplace. The production of these types of items were discontinued, with the final Monthly Collectibles released on March 15, 2017.

====Evolving Items====
Evolving Items, commonly abbreviated to EIs, are items that change or evolve over time. Items begin with one set of item poses, but with each new evolution, a different set of poses become available instead. Additionally, with each subsequent evolution a re-release of the item becomes available at the Cash Shop as a &quot;next-generation&quot; release. When the item has fully evolved all previous poses become available for the item. Times between evolutions are different for each EI, and can be anywhere between a few weeks to a few months. Recent additions of &quot;Rapid Evolving Items&quot; evolve twice a week. New evolution updates are noted in regular site announcements as &quot;Evolving Item Reports&quot; present by the NPC, Dr. Singh. All EIs are available from the Cash Shop &quot;La Victoire&quot;, and can be later sold through trading or in the Marketplace. EIs are removed from the Cash Shop sometime after their final evolution becomes available.

====Chance Items/Random Item Generators====
With Chance Items, referred to as CIs (previously known as Random Item Generators, or RIGs), users play a chance mini-game and the item they are granted depends on their success with completing the game when they decide to stop playing and collect an item, or their failure to complete the game. Games will vary depending on the RIG – some may require users to choose a &quot;correct&quot; response, while some are simply a choice between continuing the game or stopping and collecting an item. RIGs are available from the Cash Shop &quot;La Victoire&quot; and are eventually rotated out of the shop.

===Gaia Houses===
Users are able to own their own Gaia House situated in Gaia Towns. Houses are available in three different styles: Round, Square, and Long. To purchase a house is free; however future changes to the style of the house cost an additional amount. Users are also able to relocate their homes to a different Town postcode for an additional cost. A range of decorative furniture items can be bought from the NPC-run store, &quot;The Faktori&quot;, such as include floor and wall tiles, tables, chairs, lamps, among others. Rare housing items can be found in Enchanted Wooden Trunks and Enchanted Golden Trunks randomly found floating across site pages.

===Gaia Cars===
On June 18, 2007, Gaia Online and Scion announced a partnership that allowed users to create a virtual Scion with customizable wheels, decals, fog lights, tail lights, and spoilers. Other car choices available were the fictional Possum and Musculero. The Scion tC, Scion xD, UFO and Kiki Car (which is available only with Cash) were later released, bringing the total to seven possible cars to choose from. Users can own up to 3 cars, which are stored in their Garage. Parts and decals for cars (such as paint color and antenna ornaments), as well as car bases, can be purchased from the NPC-run store, &quot;Sam&#x27;s Body and Parts&quot;. Cars are used as part of the Rally game available on the website.

===Gaia Aquarium===
Users can maintain fish and other creatures in Gaia Aquariums. Fish and tank accessories can be purchased with both Gaia Cash and Gold from the NPC-run store, &quot;Phin Phang&quot;. At certain times, the fish inside a tank (from a different owner, commonly as a signature under a post in the forums) will &quot;glow&quot;, enabling the Booty Grab mini-game. Aquarium item bundles (which include various fish and tank items) can be purchased from the main Cash shop, &quot;La Victoire&quot;. Items can also be bought at the marketplace.

===Arenas===
There are four main arenas on Gaia Online: Housing, Art, Avatar, and Writing – with some of these arenas having subcategories. Members can vote in the arenas and comment on art, avatars, houses, or written works that have been submitted by other users.

The Avatar Arenas was a popular feature of the site that was first released on January 2, 2006. Each week, Users could spend 100 Gold to enter their current Avatar into Arenas and have fellow users vote for them using a 10-point system. On Sundays at 12:00 A.M. PST, the top ten entries with the highest average score would be rewarded with Gold based on their rankings and had their Avatar permanently featured in the Avatar Arena winner circle that is permanently archived in the Arena features. On September 30, 2008, the Avatar Arenas were separated into two categories. Users could enter Cosplay Avatars in one Arena and Original Avatars which did not qualify as a cosplay in the other. The voting system was changed to a 5-Star score that users could vote with. Entry fees into the Arenas increased after this to reduce the number of entries and currently cost 10,000 gold to enter.

Entering the Art and Housing Arena is free, and no prizes are awarded.

===Sponsor Quests===

The Gaia Quest system grants users items for performing certain tasks. Although previously quests for doing tasks around the website (similar to Gaia&#x27;s current Achievement system), quests on the site are now for promotional purposes, granting items related to a featured movie, video game, or series for watching trailers or advertisements.

Movies, video games, and other products that are promoted by the Gaia Quest system include &quot;Gracie&quot;, &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: At World&#x27;s End&quot;, &quot;The Golden Compass&quot;, &quot;Nancy Drew&quot;, &quot;The Last Mimzy&quot;, &quot;The Spiderwick Chronicles&quot;, &quot;Kung Fu Panda&quot;, &quot;Bee Movie&quot;, &quot;Dynasty Warriors: Strikeforce&quot;, &quot;You Don&#x27;t Mess With The Zohan&quot;, &quot;Paul Blart: Mall Cop&quot;, &quot;The Sims 3&quot;, &quot;Sonic and the Black Knight&quot;, &quot;Harry Potter&quot;, &quot;PopStar Guitar&quot;, and &quot;The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2&quot;, among many others. Anime series and TV shows have also been promoted, such as &quot;Naruto&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;The Hills&quot;. There are a few for games such as &quot;Dragon Quest Swords&quot; and &quot;&quot;.

There are also some quests for products such as Crazy Cores Skittles.

===Achievements===
Achievements are tasks that can be performed around the site. Completion of Achievements grants users Achievement Points. There are a variety of different Achievements that can be obtained – tasks to gain these can include posting in a thread, changing one&#x27;s equipped avatar items (or equipping specific items), selling an item in Marketplace, among many others.

Users can use Achievements they earn to add titles under their Avatar.

==Games==
Gaia Online currently offers a number of games where users can win different items or gold. These games constitute 10% to 15% of total site activity. In December 2020, Gaia removed Flash from their website including games requiring Flash. This was a large portion of their game selection.

===zOMG===
zOMG is a browser-based MMORPG on Gaia where users battled monsters and participated in RPG-style quests. The game utilized special rings to activate abilities, such as throwing fireballs or conjuring up a defense. Users did not level up the traditional way via experience points, but instead, through collecting Charge Orbs and empowering their rings with them. zOMG was made public and open to beta testing in November 2008, and a number of updates were made to the rings and flow of the game during its six-year duration on the site. On November 6, 2014, the staff announced that due to hardware and engineering limitations, zOMG was to be permanently removed from Gaia Online.

On February 28, 2017, it was announced that beta tests for a zOMG revival were underway.

On March 13, 2017, zOMG returned and is now open to play again. Members who played zOMG before the shutdown of the servers could pick back up where they left off, however, those who sold or discarded their rings and zOMG-related items did not have their items recovered.

===Smashblox===
Smashblox is a game that is a part of The Playpen. Players destroy blocks and clear the board to score as many points as possible. Tournaments are held through the game, while Gaia Cash is required to play, and Gaia gold is rewarded as a prize for winning.

===Gaia Worlds===
Gaia Towns (often simply called Towns) is a virtual world game where avatars may move and interact with each other. While in Towns users can pick up various items. Insects, litter, and flowers can be collected while in Towns, and these items can be later made into other items for a small cost. Shaking trees, rocks, and shrubs can yield small amounts of gold to be collected. Users may use a virtual chat system while in the towns. Homes can be found throughout Towns and more than one user can visit someone else&#x27;s home.

Towns 2, was launched in 2013. The regular updating of Towns and Towns 2 was discontinued because of the decrease in active, unique players. Players can still use these Towns and visit their friends. In November 2020, an announcement was made that Gaia will be creating Towns 3 which is an entirely 3D environment. Players should expect the release of a Towns 3 demo once they have completely removed Flash from Gaia Online.

==Virtual worlds==

===Sponsored Worlds===
Since 2009, Gaia has been implementing virtual worlds, similar to Towns, for various site sponsors. These have included a rainbow-styled world for a Skittles sponsor, a castle for an &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; film promotion, a large forest tree for the film &quot;Legend of the Guardians&quot;, and a tree house for the animated TV series &quot;Adventure Time&quot; among many others. Users can interact with certain NPCs in these areas, and are often awarded prizes for visiting these areas.

===App===

Gaia has also released multiple apps on iOS. Gaia on the Go, the main application allows users a streamlined way of accessing the forums and making minor avatar edits, as well as viewing the site&#x27;s marketplace. Derek Liu announced that a new version of the application was being worked on. Gaia has also released one of their games, Switchem, and a virtual world, Rallys, as separate iOS applications.

<doc id="794128" wikidata="Q937472" url="?curid=794128" title="1963 Canadian federal election">
<text>The 1963 Canadian federal election was held on April 8, 1963 to elect members of the House of Commons of Canada of the 26th Parliament of Canada. It resulted in the defeat of the minority Progressive Conservative (Tory) government of Prime Minister John Diefenbaker, with the Liberals returning to power for the first time in 6 years, where they would remain for twenty of the next twenty-one years (winning every election except the 1979 election until their landslide defeat in 1984). For the Social Credit Party, despite getting their highest ever share of the vote, the party lost 6 seats compared to its high-water mark in 1962.

==Overview==
During the Tories&#x27; last year in office, members of the Diefenbaker Cabinet attempted to remove him from the leadership of the party, and therefore from the Prime Minister&#x27;s office. In addition to concern within the party about Diefenbaker&#x27;s mercurial style of leadership, there had been a serious split in party ranks over the issue of stationing American nuclear missiles (see Bomarc missile) on Canadian soil for protection from possible Soviet attack. Diefenbaker and his allies opposed this proposal, while many other Conservatives and the opposition Liberal Party were in favour. Minister of National Defence Douglas Harkness resigned from Cabinet on February 4, 1963, because of Diefenbaker&#x27;s opposition to accepting the missiles.

When it turned out that nearly half of his cabinet was also prepared to resign over the issue, Diefenbaker announced that he himself would resign with immediate effect and recommend that the Governor General appoint Minister of Justice Donald Fleming as acting Prime Minister pending a new Progressive Conservative leadership convention. Diefenbaker&#x27;s allies persuaded him not to go through with the resignation, however the furore caused by the cabinet split and Diefenbaker&#x27;s rejecting a proposed deal with the Social Credit Party, whose support the Progressive Conservatives had been relying on to remain in power since the previous election, resulted in Diefenbaker&#x27;s government losing two non-confidence motions the next day and consequently falling.

The Liberal Party of Lester Pearson were ahead of the Tories when the election was called, and it looked inevitable that they would form a majority government. Their campaign began to falter however, firstly when Pearson was struck down with a bout of ill-health which precluded him from actively campaigning, and more importantly when the U.S. Department of Defense leaked a document detailing the proposed missile defences (which ironically may have been done in an effort to help Pearson&#x27;s campaign), allowing Diefenbaker to accuse the United States of wanting to use Canada as a decoy to lessen the potential damage to its cities in the event of a nuclear exchange with the Soviet Union. The Tories surged in the polls, leaving it briefly looking possible that they might not only be able to continue in power, but possibly even return to majority government status. Ultimately, the Liberals were able to regain the momentum with a platform promising that, if elected, they would begin their term with &quot;60 Days of Decision&quot; on several key questions, while Diefenbaker&#x27;s repeated attacks on President Kennedy had limited effectiveness. The Tories&#x27; refusal to work with the Socreds also proved damaging, contributing to their losing ground in British Columbia, where they slipped to third place behind the Liberals and NDP.
Kennedy strongly favoured Pearson and made an effort to help his election campaign. Kennedy sent his consultant, Lou Harris, to work on the Pearson campaign and General Lauris Norstad publicly criticised the Conservatives for not meeting their NATO contributions. Harris later said &quot;One of the highlights of my life was helping Pearson&quot;.

Despite winning 41% of the vote, which is usually sufficient for ensuring the election of a majority government, the Liberals came up five seats short of a majority due to winning only six seats in the Prairies. The Liberals formed a minority government that was dependent on the support of the social democratic New Democratic Party (NDP) in order to pass legislation.

The social-democratic NDP had been formed in 1961 by a socialist party, the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, and by the Canadian Labour Congress. The 1963 election was the second vote contested by the NDP. The party won slightly fewer votes, and two fewer seats, than they had received in the 1962 election. They were again disappointed by the failure of their new partnership with the labour movement to produce an electoral breakthrough, particularly in the province of Ontario, which has the largest population and the largest number of seats in the House of Commons.

The Social Credit Party was unable to increase its representation in western Canada, and lost four of its Quebec seats despite gaining a slightly better share of the vote compared to 1962. Indeed, 1963 represented the highest share the party would ever get. The continuing lopsided result led to a split in the party when Thompson refused to step aside so that Réal Caouette could become party leader. Caouette and his followers left the Social Credit Party to sit as the &quot;Ralliement des créditistes&quot;.

<text>Adolphus Busch (10 July 1839 – 10 October 1913) was the German-born co-founder of Anheuser-Busch with his father-in-law, Eberhard Anheuser. He introduced numerous innovations, building the success of the company in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. He became a philanthropist, using some of his wealth for education and humanitarian needs. His great-great-grandson, August Busch IV, is a former CEO of Anheuser-Busch.

==Early life==
Busch was born on 10 July 1839, to Ulrich Busch and Barbara Pfeiffer in Kastel, then a district of Mainz in the Grand Duchy of Hesse. He was the 21st of 22 children. His wealthy family ran a wholesale business of winery and brewery supplies. Busch and his brothers all received quality education, and he graduated from the Collegiate Institute of Belgium in Brussels.

In 1857, at the age of 18, Busch emigrated with three of his older brothers to St. Louis, Missouri which was a major destination for German immigrants in the nineteenth century. Because he had so many siblings, Adolphus did not expect to inherit much of his father&#x27;s estate and had to make his own way. Since St. Louis was home to so many German immigrants, the market for beer was large. The city also had two natural resources essential for manufacturing and storing beer in that time, before refrigeration: the river provided an ample water supply; and the city had many caves that would keep beer cool.

His brother Johann established a brewery in Washington, Missouri. Ulrich Jr. married a daughter of Eberhard Anheuser in St. Louis, and settled in Chicago. Anton was a hops dealer who later returned to Mainz.

==Career==
Busch&#x27;s first job in St. Louis was working as a clerk in the commission house. He was also an employee at William Hainrichshofen&#x27;s wholesale company.

During the American Civil War Busch served as a corporal in the Union Army from May to August, 1861, enlisting in the 3rd Missouri US Reserve Corps Infantry Regiment, and fighting in Missouri, including at the Camp Jackson Affair. During this period, he learned that his father had died and he had inherited a portion of the estate.

Busch partnered with Ernst Battenberg in St. Louis to found the first of his businesses, a brewing supply company that sold to the three dozen breweries in the city. Eberhard Anheuser was one of Adolphus&#x27; customers. Anheuser was a soap manufacturer that lent money to the Bavarian Brewery. When the small brewery went bankrupt, Anheuser bought out the other creditors and renamed the company Anheuser. Adolphus married Eberhard&#x27;s daughter Lilly in 1861.

Returning to St. Louis after the Civil War, Busch entered his wife&#x27;s family&#x27;s brewery business. He bought out Eberhard&#x27;s partner, William D&#x27;Oench. In 1879, the company was renamed Anheuser-Busch.

At the death of Eberhard Anheuser in 1880, Busch became president of the business, and became wealthy due to the success of the brewery. He envisioned a national beer with universal appeal. His work was distinguished by his &quot;timely adoption of important scientific and technological innovations, an expansive sales strategy geared largely toward external domestic and international population centers, and a pioneering integrated marketing plan that focused on a single core brand, Budweiser, making it the most successful nationally-distributed beer of the pre-Prohibition era.&quot;

To build Budweiser as a national beer, Busch created a network of rail-side ice-houses and launched the industry&#x27;s first fleet of refrigerated freight cars. However, throughout his life, he jokingly referred to his beer as &quot;dot schlop&quot; and preferred wine to drink. Later budweiser from Budějovice has been named &quot;the beer of kings&quot; since the 16th century. Adolphus Busch adapted the slogan to &quot;the Kings Of Beers.&quot; The trademarks of these slogans owned by Anheuser Busch in the United States.

When Busch implemented pasteurization (1878) as a way to keep the beer fresh for longer, his company was able to profit from shipping beer across the country. Busch soon acquired breweries in Texas which allowed his operation to distribute to Mexico and California. Busch was an early adopter of bottled beer and founded the Busch Glass Company to make bottles for his product. In 1901 sales surpassed the one million barrels of beer benchmark.

In addition to pasteurization and refrigeration, Busch was an early adopter of vertical integration, or buying all components of a business. He bought bottling factories, ice-manufacturing plants, stave makers, timberland, coal mines, and a refrigeration company. He also bought railways and bought the rights from Rudolf Diesel to assemble diesel engines in America, establishing the Diesel Motor Company (later &quot;American Diesel Engine Company&quot; and &quot;Busch-Sulzer Bros. Diesel Engine Company&quot;). The Busch family also acquired hop farms in the area near Cooperstown, New York.

His focus on the business extended to the flavor of the beer itself. Carl Conrad held the trademark for the name Budweiser and had Anheuser-Busch manufacture it for him. Conrad was an importer of wines and champagnes. Busch studied the pilsner process in Europe, which was used for brewing Budweiser. Adolphus bought the rights to Budweiser from Conrad in October 1882 when Conrad went bankrupt.

In 1895, Busch joined Washington University in St. Louis&#x27;s Board of Directors. He would continue to serve on the Board until his death in 1913, at which point his son, August Busch, Sr. took over his seat. Busch also served as the president of the South Side Bank and the Manufacturers Railway. He had helped organize the latter as a short-line rail serving local industry. Likewise, he was a director of the Louisiana Purchase Company. Like other business leaders, he served as a director of the 1904 World&#x27;s Fair in St. Louis, contributing to civic efforts. In 1909, Busch was the leading investor when a consortium of St. Louis capitalists purchased Laclede Gas from North American, a public utilities conglomerate, which also owned Union Electric and United Railways, the consolidated streetcar company in St. Louis, which operated as St. Louis Traction Company.

Busch invested in new buildings and businesses in Dallas, Texas, which was growing rapidly in the early 20th century as an industrial city. In 1912, Busch constructed the Adolphus Hotel there as the tallest building in the state. Another was the Busch Building, which has been adapted as the Kirby Residences, and is located at 1509 Main St. It is a National Historic Landmark.

==Philanthropy==
From his early years, Busch contributed generously to charitable and education needs. With a lifelong interest in his homeland, he assisted in repairing devastation from the 1882 flooding of Mainz-Kastel by the Rhine River. He donated $100,000 (equivalent to $ million today) to San Francisco after the 1906 earthquake - $50,000 personally and $50,000 from his company.

Busch contributed a total of $350,000 (equivalent to $ million today) to Harvard to endow a Germanic museum, named Adolphus Busch Hall.

==Personal life==

Busch married Elise &quot;Lilly&quot; Eberhard Anheuser, the third daughter of Eberhard Anheuser, on 7 March 1861, at a Lutheran church in St. Louis, Missouri. They had thirteen children:

* Nellie Busch (1863 - 1934)
* Edward Busch (1864 - 1879)
* August Anheuser Busch Sr. (1865 - 1934)
* Adolphus Busch, Jr. (1868 - 1898)
* Alexis Busch (1869 - 1869)
* Edmee Busch (1871 - 1955)
* Emilee Busch (1870 - 1870)
* Peter Busch (1872 - 1905)
* Martha Busch (1873 - 1873)
* Anna &quot;Tolie&quot; Louise Busch (1875 - 1936)
* Clara Busch (1876 -1959)
* Carl Busch (1882 - 1915)
* Wilhelmina &quot;Minnie&quot; Busch (1884 -1952)

The Busches often traveled to Germany where they built their mansion. They named it the Villa Lilly for Mrs Busch. It is located in Lindschied near Langenschwalbach, in present-day Bad Schwalbach.

==Death and legacy==
Busch died in Lindschied in 1913 while on vacation. He had been suffering from dropsy since 1906. He was survived by his widow, five daughters and two sons, August A. and Carl Busch, both of St. Louis. His body was brought back to the United States in 1915 by ship, and transported by train to St. Louis.

Almost thirty thousand people paid their respects to Adolphus Busch when his body lay in state in the family mansion in St. Louis. Notable guests included the U.S. secretary of agriculture, the president of Harvard University, and the president of the University of California. The procession consisted of twenty-five trucks that were needed to transport all the flower arrangements to the cemetery as well as a 250 piece band that led the funeral procession. The procession spanned twenty miles, from No. 1 Busch Place to Bellefontaine Cemetery, Adolphus&#x27; final resting place. As many as 100,000 mourners lined the streets for the procession. Five minutes of silence were observed at the request of Mayor Henry W. Kiel and the lights were turned off at the Jefferson and Planter&#x27;s House hotels. Streetcars were also halted.

Lilly Anheuser&#x27;s parents had built a mausoleum at Bellefontaine Cemetery, but she felt that Adolphus needed something grander. She tore down the original structure, and had the other family members reinterred outside. She had Thomas Barnett design a new mausoleum in the Bavarian Gothic style. Constructed of stone quarried in Missouri, and completed in 1921, the new building cost $250,000 (equivalent to $ million today). It features grapevines representing both Adolphus&#x27; birthplace in German wine country, and his favorite beverage. Julius Caesar&#x27;s words, &quot;Veni, Vidi, Vici,&quot; or &quot;I came, I saw, I conquered&quot; are inscribed on the lintel.

Lilly died of a heart attack and pneumonia on 17 February 1928, in Pasadena, California. Her body was brought back to St. Louis, and was buried beside her husband.

<text>The John F. Kennedy Expressway is a nearly freeway in Chicago, Illinois, United States. Portions of the freeway carry I-190, I-90 and I-94. The freeway runs in a southeast–northwest direction between the central city neighborhood of the West Loop and O&#x27;Hare International Airport. The highway was named in commemoration of 35th US President John F. Kennedy. It conforms to the Chicago-area term of using the word &quot;expressway&quot; for an Interstate Highway without tolls. The Kennedy&#x27;s official endpoints are the Jane Byrne Interchange with Interstate 290 (Eisenhower Expressway/Ida B. Wells Drive) and the Dan Ryan Expressway (also I-90/94) at the east end, and the O&#x27;Hare Airport terminals at the west end. I-190 runs from the western terminus at O&#x27;Hare Airport for , where it meets I-90 and runs a further , before joining with I-94 for the final .

Traveling eastbound from O&#x27;Hare, the Kennedy interchanges with the eastern terminus of the Jane Addams Memorial Tollway (I-90) and with the Tri-State Tollway (I-294) at a complex junction just west of Illinois Route 171 (IL 171, Cumberland Avenue). The Kennedy later merges with the southern end of the Edens Expressway (I-94) at Montrose Avenue; the Kennedy (at this point both I-90 and I-94) then turns south to its junction with the Dan Ryan and Eisenhower Expressways and Ida B. Wells Drive at the Jane Byrne Interchange in downtown Chicago.

With up to 327,000 vehicles traveling on the Kennedy daily, the Kennedy and its South Side extension, the Dan Ryan, are the busiest roads in the Midwest.

==History==
The Kennedy was originally constructed along the route of Avondale Avenue, an existing diagonal street, and the C&amp;NW Northwest Line corridor, in the late 1950s and completed on November 5, 1960. 

On January 21st 1961, a new reversible roadway was completed.

Originally named the Northwest Expressway for its general direction of travel, the Chicago City Council voted unanimously on November 29, 1963—one week after the assassination of President Kennedy—to rename the highway the John F. Kennedy Expressway.

Throughout 1971, the old roadway was removed and replaced by new roadway. 

Until 1978, the Kennedy Expressway was marked as I-94 and Illinois Route 194 (IL 194), I-90 and I-190 replaced IL 194 and thus the Eisenhower Expressway was renamed from I-90 to I-290.

The express portion of the freeway was reconstructed from 1992 through 1994, when the existing express lanes, which previously were reversed by hand, were modernized. In addition, all aspects of the express lanes system were computerized, so that the process could be controlled at both ends from a central location. At least once a day, however, IDOT crews still examine the express lanes for debris while the lanes are closed.
In 2005, the Washington Street bridge over the expressway was reconstructed, and the entrance ramps to both directions of the Kennedy were partially removed. The same was done in 2006 for the Monroe Street bridge. This left a disconnected portion of each ramp remaining on the expressway, to be removed and the existing &quot;suicide ramps&quot; lengths extended when funding became available. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provided the necessary funding for the construction between Hubbard Street and the Circle Interchange, commencing in summer 2009. The westbound (facing north) ramps at Adams Street and Madison Street, along with the eastbound (facing south) ramps at Randolph Street and Madison Street, were lengthened by removing what remained of abandoned ramps and lengthening the entrance ramps significantly. The only remaining short, limited-sight, left-side suicide ramp entrance is from Lake Street to the eastbound expressway (heading south). As part of the project, eastbound (heading south) traffic patterns were adjusted. The two right-most lanes were made &quot;exit only&quot; for Chicago Loop, Ida B. Wells Drive, and Eisenhower Expressway exits, the Adams Street and Jackson Boulevard exits were combined, certain center median walls reconstructed, lanes restriped to remove the merging of the leftmost lanes, and appropriate signage changes. For example, the changes increased the taper for the Randolph Street entrance headed eastbound from , an increase of over 3.6 time. In the westbound direction (headed north), the exit ramp to Monroe Street was permanently removed.

In 2015, the American Highway Users Alliance named the of the Kennedy between the Circle Interchange and Edens junction the worst traffic bottleneck in the country.

== Impact ==
The creation of the Kennedy Expressway displaced &quot;3,306 families and 480 single people&quot;. Unlike other expressways on the south and west side of Chicago, areas around the Kennedy maintained much of their density despite the displacement caused by its construction.

The Kennedy Expressway bisected the Avondale neighborhood of Chicago. Avondale residents view the Kennedy&#x27;s underpasses&#x27; unwelcoming conditions as creating a barrier between the two halves of the neighborhood. Residents also complain about traffic congestion and dangerous speeds near the expressway&#x27;s onramps. A large portion of Avondale Park was destroyed to make way for the Kennedy Expressway, greatly decreasing its size from 5 acres to just over 1 acre. This contributed to Avondale becoming a &quot;park poor&quot; neighborhood. 

Areas around the Kennedy Expressway are hotspots for air pollution, especially in the Avondale and Irving Park neighborhoods of Chicago. Residents in these neighborhoods face significant exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5), a type of air pollution comprising tiny particles that can penetrate deep into the lungs. PM2.5 poses severe health risks such as heart and lung diseases, asthma, and premature death. PM2.5 is considered the largest environmental contributor to mortality, with approximately 5% of premature deaths in Chicago attributed to this pollution.

==Features==
The Blue Line operates in the median of the Kennedy Expressway for about from O&#x27;Hare International Airport to just south of Addison Street. The first section, an extension from Logan Square to Jefferson Park, opened in 1970. The second section opened between Jefferson Park and River Road (now Rosemont) in February 1983. The third and final section between River Road and O&#x27;Hare was opened in September 1984.
The second distinct features of the Kennedy Expressway are its reversible express lanes where I-94 merges into I-90. The reversible lanes lie in the median of the highway from the Kennedy Expressway/Edens Expressway junction until just north of the Loop (at Ohio Street), a distance of about . These reversible lanes, situated between the inbound lanes and the Blue Line tracks, allow two lanes of traffic to flow towards or away from the city, depending on the time of the day. The lanes are controlled by computers and verified by humans at a separate control center. Steel mesh barriers and breakaway gates prevent traffic from entering oncoming lanes. On January 25, 2014, a drunk driver broke through the safety gates and drove in the express lanes in the wrong direction, but was stopped by a snow plow; no injuries were reported. This was the first wrong-way accident involving the express lanes.

A third distinct feature is Hubbard&#x27;s Cave, also called the Hubbard Street Tunnel, which passes under several streets and the Metra&#x27;s Union Pacific West, North Central Service, Milwaukee District North, and Milwaukee District West lines (former Chicago &amp; Northwestern and Milwaukee Road commuter lines respectively). It is named for Hubbard Street, one of the streets it passes underneath. Hubbard&#x27;s Cave is a landmark frequently heard in traffic reports on radio and TV.
The final distinct features are the nine exits in between mile markers 50 and 51, and the southbound exit to I-290 and Ida B. Wells Drive is marked as exits 51H and 51I. While the density of interchanges is quite dangerous, the hazard is partially offset by the fact that exits are apart on the right hand side, while entrances to the highway were apart, but on the left side. Known as the &quot;suicide ramps&quot;, the entrance ramps on the left had little to no acceleration zone, and traffic on the ramps could not see mainline traffic until the last of the ramp. The 2009–10 reconstruction between Hubbard Street and the Circle Interchange improved safety by increasing the lengths of most entrance ramps and reduced bottlenecks by better utilizing the existing space.

The Kennedy Expressway was the location of a large Magikist lips flashing sign which was a Chicago pop culture icon for many years. Located at the southeast corner where Montrose Avenue abutted the expressway, the sign was torn down in 2004.

<doc id="794132" wikidata="Q3570204" url="?curid=794132" title="Wye College">
<text>The College of St Gregory and St Martin at Wye, commonly known as Wye College, was an education and research institution in the village of Wye, Kent. In 1447, Cardinal John Kempe founded his chantry there which also educated local children. , it still includes a rare, complete example of medieval chantry college buildings.

After abolition in 1545, parts of the premises were variously occupied as mansion, grammar school, charity school, infant school and national school, before purchase by Kent and Surrey County Councils to provide men&#x27;s technical education. For over a hundred years Wye became the school, then college, of London University most concerned with rural subjects, including agricultural sciences; business management; agriculture; horticulture, and agricultural economics. Chemist and Actonian Prize winner, Louis Wain developed synthetic auxin selective herbicides 2,4-DB, MCPB and Bromoxynil at Wye in the 1950s alongside his other research into insecticides, plant growth regulators and fungicides. Wain&#x27;s colleague Gerald Wibberley championed alternative priorities for the college with an early emphasis on land use and the environment.

Following World War II and a 1947 merger with Swanley Horticultural College for women, Wye transformed itself from small agricultural college, providing local practical instruction, to university for a rapidly increasing number of national and international students. Successive phases of expansion developed the college&#x27;s campus along Olantigh Road, Withersdane Hall the country&#x27;s first post-war, purpose built university hall of residence, and accumulated an estate of nearly . However, after a difficult 2000 merger with Imperial College and controversial 2005 attempt to build 4,000 houses on its farmland, Imperial College at Wye closed in 2009.

, the pioneering postgraduate distance learning programme created at Wye College continued within SOAS. Many of the college buildings have been redeveloped, though some are retained for community use or occasional public access.

==History==

===Chantry===

Church leaders from the 14th century onwards were concerned by the influence of John Wyclif and his fellow Lollards on the Weald and Romney Marsh. They felt priests educated in latin and theology, living in the community, would be better able to counter circulation of heretical translations and interpretation. Where these priests&#x27; persuasion failed, the alerted church authorities could punish committed dissenters, or even have them burnt as at Wye in 1557. Several chantries were established in the vicinity, at least in part for this purpose.

In 1432, John Kempe, then Archbishop of York and a native of adjoining Olantigh, was granted royal license by King Henry VI to found the College of Saints Gregory and Martin in the parish of Wye. In 1447 after protracted negotiation, he obtained about an acre of land, including dwellings known as Shalewell, Goldsmyth and Shank, from the Abbot and Convent of Battle who owned the Manor of Wye. Kempe constructed the Latin School, and buildings around a cloistered quadrangle for the accommodation of secular priests. There were up to ten priests at any one time in his chantry. Kempe had also rebuilt adjoining Wye Church in 1447 and Archbishop of Canterbury, John Stafford granted its vicarship to the college. The priests acted as a college of canons for the now collegiate church; performed their chantry duties for the Kempes&#x27; souls, and included a teacher of grammar (latin). The master had to be a scholar of theology and member of Kempe&#x27;s alma mater, Merton College.

Kempe&#x27;s statutes required the college &quot;to teach all scholars free, both rich and poor&quot;, though as a welcome seasonal exception grateful students could reward the schoolmaster with gifts of fowl and pennies on Saint Nicholas Day, &quot;confuetam galloram &amp; denariorum Sancti Nicholai gratuitam oblationem&quot;.

The dedication to Saint Gregory and Saint Martin mirrors that of Kempe&#x27;s adjoining church. An earlier 1290 Wye Church, on the site, had been solely named for Saint Gregory. The further reference, at both the college and church, to Saint Martin may have been to recognise the contribution of Battle Abbey, itself dedicated to him.

By 1450, Wye College had appropriated the pilgrim&#x27;s church at Boughton Aluph, and acquired land in Canterbury, Wye, Boughton Aluph, Crundale, Godmersham, Bethersden and Postling. King Edward IV granted it the west Kent coast churches of Newington, Brenzett and Broomhill in 1465.

The rules were not universally upheld. In 1511, Master Goodhewe was
reported to Archbishop Warham for appointing himself, rather than other fellows, to the College&#x27;s remunerated positions, and taking the entire benefit of its endowment &quot;to the neglect of divine service and the cure of souls&quot;. He failed to annually proclaim Kempe&#x27;s statutes and maintained a relationship with a woman, in breach of them. Goodhewe also found time to be Rector of Staplehurst without papal dispensation to hold two incompatible benefices. But he was not removed from office for his misconduct.

By 1534 the college had annual gross income of £125 15s 4d, or over £94,000 at 2022 values.

Other partially surviving chantry colleges near Wye include the larger Maidstone, and smaller Cobham Colleges. Traces remain at Ashford.

===After abolition===
The college was surrendered in 1545 under the Abolition of Chantries Act of that year, its assets appropriated for the Court of Augmentations. An inventory was valued at £7 1s 1d plus a silver salt at £3; silver spoons at 27s 6d, and two old masters at 6s 8d.

Apart from its principal buildings the college owned nearby Perry Court, and Surrenden manors, together with the rectory and advowson of Broomhill on Romney Marsh. It was entitled to annual payments of 33s 4d from Westwell rectory, 10s from Hothfield rectory and 8s from Eastwell rectory. The college owned other land in Wye, Withersdane, Naccolt, Hinxhill, Godmersham, Crundale, Great Chart, Bethersden, Postling, Westbury and Broomhill.

These properties were alienated first to Catherine Parr&#x27;s Secretary, Walter Buckler for £200, who promptly sold them in 1546 to his brother in law, and property speculator, Maurice Denys. Following Denys&#x27; disgrace the college was acquired by William Damsell in 1553, thence passing on death in 1582 to his four daughters.

As the seized lands passed from the Crown, and onwards, they did so subject to conditions, echoing Kempe&#x27;s statutes, requiring the owners to &quot;at all times provide and maintain a sufficient Schoolmaster capable of teaching boys and young lads in the art of Grammar, without fee or reward, in this parish&quot;. Those terms were met haphazardly in the coming years. In 1557, Archdeacon Harpsfield urged William Damsell be reminded of his obligations. Damsell had only been paying £9 of the £17 due each year, even though his former college lands in Wye alone gave him annual rents of £80. Harpsfield&#x27;s treatment of Damsell was lenient by comparison to the two Protestants he ordered burnt to death at Wye that same year. By 1596 it was noted, during a Commission of Inquiry at Deptford, that payments to a Wye schoolmaster required under the college&#x27;s original transfer to Buckler were no longer being made.

The college buildings were occupied as a substantial private residence in 1610 for the Twysden family, incorporating the extant, fine Jacobean staircase and imposing fireplaces to the Hall and Parlour. The family may have previously occupied it as tenants of lawyer Henry Haule.

In about 1626, King Charles I granted the forfeit former Wye College rectories of Boughton Aluph, Brenzett and Newington to reward his loyal supporter Robert Maxwell. The proviso was added Maxwell and his successors paid £16 per year, which reinstated the lapsed stipend for a Wye schoolmaster. Years later the sum would be diminished by inflation and several holders of the position faced short tenure and great financial hardship.

With salary back in place, the following year a grammar school for boys opened in part of the college though the southern range continued to be used as a private house in ownership of the Winchilsea Finch family from Eastwell. Restoration poet Ann Finch and her husband Heneage lived quietly at Wye College from 1690 to 1708 to avoid persecution at Court for their Jacobite sympathies. Several of her works refer directly or indirectly to the college and their time there, including reaction to a chimney fire in 1702.

Wye College&#x27;s grammar school did not achieve the prominence of rival Eton College though its alumni included notables such as journalist Alaric Alexander Watts and Robert Plot, first keeper of Oxford&#x27;s Ashmolean Museum. In 1762 there were 40 boarders and 100-day pupils but during other periods considerably less, if any at all. Sometimes the position was treated as little more than a sinecure.

In 1868 the grammar school&#x27;s position was bleak. Although teaching of classics was free, locals were concerned about increasing costs for tuition in other subjects. The school had only four boarders despite a capacity for 40. An alternative curriculum was considered and unless changes were made, an inspector concluded it would be hard to &quot;keep a good master for £16 and half a house&quot;.



===Lady Joanna Thornhill School===

Cardinal Kempe&#x27;s nephew Thomas Kempe sold Olantigh to Sir Timothy Thornhill in 1607. The 1708 will of Lady Joanna Thornhill, the daughter of Sir Bevil Grenville, second wife of descendant Richard Thornhill, and Woman of the Bedchamber to Queen Catherine of Braganza provided funds to care for and educate the children of Wye. Her trust purchased parts of the college buildings and other property for that purpose.

Sir George Wheler, who some sources claim was Lady Joanna Thornhill&#x27;s nephew, acquired the private mansion – the southern range, garden, outbuildings and Latin School in 1713. He had been a pupil at Wye Grammar School but &quot;learnt little&quot; there.

That transaction left the college part owned by Lady Thornhill&#x27;s trust and, on Wheler&#x27;s death in 1724, part by his. A grammar school still operated in the Latin School and buildings around the cloister.

The grammar school headmaster received free personal accommodation from Wheler&#x27;s trust, use of the Latin School for classes and the £16, but had to pay rent to Thornhill&#x27;s trust for other school space. The Thornhill trust operated its own charity schools for boys and girls in the Old Hall and Parlour respectively. Their schoolmaster received £30 per annum salary and the school mistress £20, from rent on property purchased in Wye and on Romney Marsh.

By the late 18th century there were over 100 children attending Lady Thornhills school. In 1839, rather than join the non-denominational British and Foreign School Society it affiliated with the Church of England&#x27;s National Society for Promoting Religious Education, becoming a national school.

Wheler&#x27;s will provided an annual £10 exhibition, increased to £20 by his son, for local boys from Lady Thornhill&#x27;s charity school to receive instruction at Wye Grammar School and then attend Lincoln College. The scholarship was funded by the rent charge on a house in Whitehall which Wheler owned. Unfortunately by 1790, that charge had become impossible to collect. Its absence was still greatly lamented, nearly a century later, both by Wye Grammar School and Lincoln College.

Trustees of Lady Thornhill&#x27;s charity school, requiring more space for girls, converted an outbuilding at the south east of the grammar school garden for the purpose. The space, with extant exposed crown post roof, belonging to Sir George Wheler&#x27;s trust became known as the college &quot;Wheelroom&quot;.

Nevertheless, the situation was poor. An inspector passed the facilities &quot;but with the greatest reluctance&quot;. He observed the Old Hall used as boys&#x27; schoolroom &quot;though a fine old room, is ill-adapted for a school and requires constant repair&quot;, and bemoaned that &quot;as long as they are allowed to use this old room, the inhabitants of Wye will not lift a finger towards the 
erection of new schools&quot;. His conclusion was that Wye &quot;has about the worst schools in the neighbourhood&quot;.

In 1878 the Wheler / Thornhill trusts and operation of the grammar and charity school premises they owned were combined, and two years later to comply with the &quot;Elementary Education Act 1870&quot; the girls&#x27; 
Wheelroom was leased to Wye and Brook School Board for use as an infant school.

===South Eastern Agricultural College===

Duty imposed upon beer and spirits under the Local Taxation (Customs and Excise) Act 1890 (53 &amp; 54 Vict. c. 60), commonly known as &quot;Whiskey Money&quot;, was intended to compensate licensees in the country required to close. It created an income which Sir Arthur Dyke Acland instead proposed to Parliament be earmarked for the new county councils to spend on technical instruction. His amendment, it is reported, was adopted by a &quot;lethargic and half empty house&quot;.

There were some institutions offering short courses in Agriculture but very few opportunities for degree courses. The Normal School of Science, shortly to merge and form Imperial College, had only graduated seven agricultural students per year between 1878 and 1887. There had been proposals for a single, central agricultural university, potentially near Derby, but no appetite for a network of them or state funding. However nationally, now county councils chose to spend £80,000 per year of the &quot;Whiskey Money&quot; specifically for agricultural education.

The combined Lady Thornhill Trust owned its school premises; nearby Amage Farm, and agricultural land on Romney Marsh. An 1891 proposal from the Earl of Winchilsea envisaged this should be the basis of a 40 male student agricultural college for Kent, Surrey and Sussex, funded by &quot;Whiskey Money&quot;. East and West Sussex County Councils dropped out of the scheme, and the farms were not immediately available, but negotiations took place for newly formed Kent County Council and Surrey County Council to purchase the school premises and a lease was arranged for of land at Coldharbour Farm from Erle-Drax&#x27;s Olantigh Estate. Coldharbour was considered difficult, inhospitable, and a suitable challenge for the college to prove its ability to local farmers.

In 1892, Kent and Surrey county councils obtained the old chantry premises for £1,000, the schools moving to a new building on land Lady Thornhill&#x27;s trust owned in Bridge Street, and in 1894 opened the South Eastern Agricultural College there. They appointed chemist, socialist and former schoolmaster Alfred Daniel Hall as principal and he opened with thirteen students. It was then &quot;the first and only college founded and maintained by public money solely for the benefit of agriculture in England&quot;. Hall&#x27;s student roll grew to 46 in 1900; 71 in 1902, and 124 in 1913.

Unconventionally for a college of agriculture, Hall chose to appoint teaching staff that were scientists rather than agriculturalists with some scientific insight, and at opening, none had agricultural experience. He later accepted that with his initial &quot;over-emphasis&quot; on basic science the establishment was fortunate to be accepted so quickly by the farming community. Rather than entrust the new college&#x27;s farm to Hall&#x27;s team the governors chose to run it themselves with the help of a bailiff. It was not until Frank Baybrook Smith briefly joined the college to teach agriculture that the governors felt sufficiently confident in the academic team to relinquish direct control of the college farm.

Between 1892 and 1894, the existing buildings were extensively refurbished at a cost of £18,000; a lecture theatre (Old Lecture Theatre) was abutted to the Parlour repurposed as a library, and biological laboratory (Lecture Room A) constructed north west of the cloister range. Original accommodation to the south of the cloister housed the principal. A chemistry laboratory was arranged in the Wheelroom, and housekeeping wing formed between it and the cloister range to service a refectory in the Old Hall. First floor space north of the cloister, and above the new biological laboratory and housekeeping wing, provided 20 student rooms. Others were to be accommodated in village houses.

Entomologist of independent means, Frederick Theobald joined the opening college as lecturer in agricultural zoology, and later became vice-principal. He remained at Wye throughout his career. Theobald&#x27;s work transitioned a discipline that had been a matter of simply collecting insects to the study of damage they did to crops and how to mitigate it. He spent much of his time curating economic zoology and mosquito collections at the British Museum, and ceased lecturing at Wye from 1920 in favour of agricultural extension. Theobald&#x27;s research on mosquitos and tropical sanitation earned him international recognition including the Order of Osmanieh and Mary Kingsley Medal. He lived at Wye Court until death in 1930, his coffin carried from there by former colleagues and students to Wye Church for burial.

In its early years only about a fifth of the South Eastern Agricultural College student intake was for three-year qualifications. Others undertook short, more applied instruction for two-year diplomas, or leading to a single year certificate. Short courses were provided, for instance to local school teachers tasked with instructing their pupils in nature topics.

As well as teaching and research, academics and other staff at the South Eastern Agricultural College, throughout its existence, provided agricultural extension services to farmers and growers in the south-east of England. Hall gave book-keeping and other advice to the Guinness hop farms; Ernest Stanley Salmon helped hop and other growers combat fungi, while Theobald advised those confronting crop pests. Their colleagues dealt with all manner of technical requirements, even designing an innovative aerating sewage treatment plant for nearby Olantigh.

Complementing individual consultations and publications, college staff toured the south-east of England giving lectures to agricultural or rural organisations on &quot;fruit growing, farriery, poultry, bee keeping, and numerous veterinary topics&quot;, sometimes in &quot;migratory vans&quot; specially prepared for these roadshows. In Wye they regularly gave talks to the village school, and the laboratories offered a service analysing soil, forage and milk, and performing veterinary post-mortems.

At the end of its first year of operation Wye&#x27;s College had cost Kent and Surrey county councils £25,000 split 3:2 in their agreed proportions. The two counties combined technical education budget at the time was only £37,000 per year. In addition to their normal annual contributions the counties had to make exceptional 1895 payments to cover their college&#x27;s deficit and stringent cost cutting was enforced in place of the earlier largess. Grants from the Board of Agriculture and those changes put the college back onto a sound financial footing ready for further premises expansion.

Going forward, and particularly following 1910&#x27;s Liberal government policy for expansion of agriculture and establishment of the Development Fund, this financial burden on the councils diminished, falling to only £3,000 by 1925. Indeed, &quot;itinerant agriculture lecturer&quot; Hall left Rothamsted in 1912 to become one of eight commissioners to the Development Fund. The college would be able to seek annual grants from successive central government agriculture or education departments by presenting itself alternately as an agricultural institution or university respectively.


The South Eastern Agricultural College at Wye immediately took advantage of the &quot;University of London Act 1898&quot; and became one of its federated schools with &quot;such privileges as it would have had if situated within the administrative county of London&quot;. Even in formal documents it was also referred to as &quot;Wye College&quot; at the time. From 1894, students seeking a three-year qualification completed the college&#x27;s two-year diploma and were then prepared a further year for examination by the Royal Agricultural Society of England, the Surveyors&#x27; Institution or by Cambridge University. The arrangement was reversed for the new London University Bachelor of Science degree. Students could take first year basic science courses anywhere in the university&#x27;s Faculty of Science and the latter years provided specialist teaching such as agricultural chemistry, agricultural botany and agricultural engineering.

Alfred Daniel Hall removed to Rothamsted in 1902 to continue his &quot;marriage of agriculture and science&quot;. At Wye he was replaced as principal by his Oxford contemporary Malcolm Dunstan, formerly director of the Midland Agricultural and Dairy Institute.

Hall&#x27;s departure was promptly followed by opening botany lecturer and vice-principal John Percival who moved to the University of Reading and became &quot;founding father of the faculty of agriculture&quot; there. Seeds Percival took with him formed the nucleus of a native European wheat variety collection eventually numbering over 2,500 varieties in the 1930s.

John Russell had joined the college in 1901 and took over chemistry teaching from Henry Cousins. Russell began research into soil microbiology determining that oxygen uptake could be used to measure micro-organism activity in a soil sample. However, he too departed in 1907 taking up an invitation to rejoin Hall at Rothamstead. In 1968, Wye College&#x27;s Russell Laboratories were named for him.

In 1903, the college appointed C S Orwin its lecturer in farm management and book-keeping. At opening he had been the first potential student interviewed by Hall and went on to be treasurer of the college&#x27;s students&#x27; union in its first year. Orwin remained on staff for three years and was later appointed by Hall to lead the Department of Agricultural Economics created at Oxford. Academics at Wye sought early ways to establish the actual cost of agricultural products on farm, albeit with varied success, and double entry book-keeping was then a part of the curriculum.

In 1913, East Malling and Wye Fruit Experimental Station established on bought by Kent County Council at East Malling. It was under the college&#x27;s control and initially advised by botanist V H Blackman of Imperial College. Ronald Hatton was appointed director of the station in 1914 and remained in post for the rest of his career. Hatton prioritised basic research; was concerned about the conditions of horticultural workers like fellow socialist Hall, and merely &quot;tolerated&quot; requests for practical advice from growers. The station became independent of the college in 1921.

The 1894 premises included chemical and biological laboratories. By 1901 expansion meant rooms could be dedicated to a drawing office as well as botany, zoology and analytical laboratories. With completion of works in 1914, space would be made available to support study of agriculture, horticulture, entomology, mycology, dairying, engineering, economics and physics. There was an iron workshop / forge and accommodation for operational research.

During World War I, student numbers shrank as students enlisted. A 28 bed reception hospital operated from 1915 to 1916 and subsequently a Red Cross supply depot was organised by Mrs Barnard of Withersdane Hall and principal Dunstan&#x27;s daughter Hester. The War Office presented the college with a German field gun in gratitude.

Malcolm Dunstan left Wye in 1922 to lead the Royal Agricultural College. He was replaced by Robert Wilson, formerly principal of the East Anglian Institute of Agriculture.

Lord Northbourne joined the college&#x27;s board of governors in 1925. He was also on the board of future merger partner Swanley Horticultural College and remained a governor of Wye College until 1965.

Ahead of war in 1939, Betteshanger Summer School visited the college farm. Lord Northbourne, originator of the term organic farming, hosted a biodynamic agriculture study week and was governor of the college.

During World War II the college initially remained open, alongside providing training to the Women&#x27;s Land Army, but closed in autumn 1940, its accommodation requisitioned for 180 Land Army recruits. Remaining students and faculty transferred to the University of Reading but principal Robert Wilson died in September 1940. Military Southern Command used some of the buildings. General Montgomery, Corps Commander for the South East, was a frequent visitor, briefing troops in the Old Lecture Theatre and Latin School. The college dining hall (Wheelroom) provided a space for servicemen&#x27;s Catholic Mass, the first time it had been celebrated in the village of Wye since the Reformation.

With the end of hostilities Withersdane Hall was purchased for £10,000 from Florence Barnard to house students of Swanley Horticultural College. Initially they lived in the house, and temporary buildings erected on its grounds. Botanist Norah Lillian Penston joined the South Eastern Agricultural College, ahead of its merger with Swanley College, as first female vice-principal. She went on to lead Wye&#x27;s Department of Biological Science until 1951.

Former World War II RAF Wing Commander Dunstan Skilbeck was appointed principal at the end of the war. A &quot;forceful character&quot;, he remained in post for 23 years modelling Wye on an Oxford college, establishing and reinforcing traditions such as formal dining and the wearing of academic gowns. He took particular interest in forming the college&#x27;s archeological society and beagle pack.

Skilbeck was joined by Louis Wain, returning to Wye as head of the two person chemistry department. He had previously been a temporary lecturer between 1937 and 1939. Wain went on to be head of Wye&#x27;s ARC Plant Growth Substances and Systemic Fungicides Unit, and contributed to agricultural chemistry research at the college for fifty years. While at Wye he developed and patented early synthetic auxin selective herbicides 2,4-DB, MCPB, Bromoxynil and Ioxynil. Wain was widely regarded as &quot;Wye&#x27;s unofficial chief scientist&quot; and &quot;ambassador&quot; responsible for much of the college&#x27;s reputation. His work there also created herbicide Mecoprop, fungicides Captan and , as well as innovative plant growth regulators and insecticides.

In 1947, the South Eastern Agricultural College formally amalgamated with Swanley Horticultural College as the School of Agriculture and Horticulture within the University of London. Swanley College&#x27;s former premises had been heavily damaged during World War II and it was decided to rebuild at a combined college rather than in Swanley.

===Wye College===

On 13 September 1948 Wye College was incorporated, by royal charter of King George VI, a full institution of the University of London as The College of St Gregory and St Martin at Wye generally known as &quot;Wye College&quot;. Its objects included:-

The major impact for the college was a cessation of short and diploma courses in favour of entirely degree-level education, which occurred alongside transfer of its agricultural extension work to the newly formed National Agricultural Advisory Service. Over the next 20 years the institution was to transform itself from a local agricultural college that &quot;happened to have a network of international contacts&quot; to a truly &quot;national and international&quot; establishment combining the &quot;practical and academic&quot;.

In 1951, a room behind the college&#x27;s Jacobean staircase north west of the cloister was converted to a chapel and consecrated by Geoffrey Fisher, Archbishop of Canterbury. Paintings to be hung on the walls were provided by principal Dunstan Skilbeck&#x27;s father and pews salvaged from the collapsed Eastwell Church. It had been a toilet before earlier transformation to small laboratory. There has been speculation this room was originally the chantry&#x27;s library.

The refurbishment featured a stained glass window designed by Michael Farrar-Bell, looking onto Wye Church, incorporating the University of London coat of arms, and depictions of King Henry VI and Cardinal Kempe.

The chapel was reconsecrated in 1997, and under 2021&#x27;s planning permission is to be &quot;available for public worship for four services per month and an annual heritage open day&quot;.

In 1954, Gerald Wibberley was appointed head of the Department of Economics. He led a move to broaden the college&#x27;s interest in land use and explored alternatives to a &quot;farming first&quot; philosophy, sometimes causing conflict with the national agricultural establishment and colleagues promoting Wye&#x27;s agricultural chemistry tradition. With associate Robin Best who for the first time accurately measured urban land area and loss of farmland, Wibberley drew particular early ire in &quot;the garden controversy&quot;, an exploration of capacity for food security from productive modern farming; the role of domestic gardens, and the potential for releasing farmland to other purposes.

Alongside his roles at the Council for Small Industries in Rural Areas, and as expert witness to public inquiries into large scale planning applications, Wibberley continued at the college until 1985. His work led to expansion of social science research and teaching at Wye with new Rural Environmental Studies and Landscape Ecology, Design and Maintenance courses, and ultimately business management options.

The Wye Double Digger was developed at Wye College in the 1970s, for experimental evaluation of comprehensive subsoil loosening akin to the traditional horticultural practise of double digging. It incorporates a conventional mouldboard plough with rotary cultivator operating in the open furrow, and can break up soil compaction layers below plough depth; mix topsoil with subsoil, and deeply incorporate soil nutrients. The powered blades help provide forward propulsion for the share. Wye&#x27;s Double Digger was tested around the world, notably at Purdue University. A business was established to market it, and commercial two furrow version built, before development ceased.

In 1977, the college appointed Ian Lucas as principal to replace Harry Darling. Darling&#x27;s departure was marked by a farewell above Wye village, on the Crown slope painted in weedkiller for all to see across the Stour Valley. Lucas had extensive experience of overseas agriculture and arrived from the University College of North Wales where he had been Professor of Agriculture. During his 11 years at Wye student enrollment increased 40%.

During the early 1980s, Government spending cuts led to a series of mergers between University of London colleges. In spite of Wye being among the very smallest, and persistent concerns that agriculture was not &quot;a fit subject to study at university&quot;, it was spared a merger because of physical isolation outside the capital and the absence of course overlap / potential cost savings with sister London colleges.

In 1996, Natural Resources International Ltd was incorporated in partnership with Imperial College, and the universities of Edinburgh and Greenwich, to take over overseas development training and consulting services formerly provided by the Government&#x27;s Overseas Development Agency Natural Resources Institute. Turnover in the first year was £25.9 million rising to £26.8 million by the time of the college&#x27;s merger with Imperial College. Clients included the Department for International Development, World Bank, European Union, African Development Bank, Asian Development Bank, and other state and commercial bodies.
In 1997 the Kempe Centre, named for Cardinal John Kempe, was opened by Princess Anne at the junction of Olantigh and Occupation Roads. The learning resource building designed by Nicholas Hare Architects received a RIBA award, with praise for its &quot;aesthetic grandeur&quot; and &quot;environmental efficiency&quot;. It subsequently formed the nucleus of Wye School.

Of the £4 million projected cost only £750,000 came from the Higher Education Funding Council for England. The college provided £2 million from property sales (including Court Lodge); the Frank Parkinson Agricultural Trust donated £100,000, and £500,000 came from an appeal including sums from the Wolfson Foundation, Westminster foundations and individual alumni. The remainder was funded by commercial loans.

According to Imperial College&#x27;s account of the &quot;World Class Merger&quot; in 2000, Wye College had students enrolled from 50 countries; 477 undergraduates; 259 postgraduates, and 200 on short courses. The growing External Programme had registered 975 mid-career professionals from 120 countries.

===Imperial College at Wye===
In 2000, Wye College merged with Imperial College and was renamed Imperial College at Wye. It ceased to be an independent College of London University.

Justifications for the merger from Wye College&#x27;s side were largely an aspiration to achieve financial resilience through scale. There was anticipated decline in demand for domestic agricultural qualifications. Government intended to withdraw from funding &quot;near market&quot; agricultural research in favour of pure sciences; reduce per capita student payments generally; weight them away from the subjects taught at Wye, and move to annual rather than five yearly funding arrangements. The college governors felt these measures would disproportionately and adversely impact small agricultural teaching and research institutions like Wye.

Apart from Imperial College, mergers were considered with University of Kent at Canterbury and University of Greenwich. The governors concluded that &quot;Imperial College, like Wye a constituent College of the University of London, complemented Wye most closely&quot;. The colleges were already partners in Natural Resources International, though so too was Greenwich. Imperial College was publicly enthusiastic.

In spite of reporting an operating surplus only once in its last ten independent years, instead relying heavily on endowment income and property sales, Wye College went into the merger with net assets of £18.24 million. It had doubled annual revenue in those years to £12.65 million and pivoted away from a dependency on traditional agricultural science courses. The college had just invested £5.5 million in new facilities, and a further £2 million preparing 50 postgraduate courses for the External Programme.

Imperial College briefly used Wye College&#x27;s origins to dubiously claim the status of third-oldest university in England.

Sir Richard Sykes was appointed new rector of Imperial College in 2000. He visited Wye and expressed enthusiasm for investment in academic facilities there, placing the campus in the short lived Life Sciences faculty that arose from his early reorganisation of Imperial College.

Nevertheless, 25% of academic staff at Wye were offered redundancy terms and took them. Worse still, Imperial College inadvertently did not include Wye undergraduate courses in its prospectus so admissions plummeted in 2000 and 2001.

As early as January 2001, Imperial College privately declared the 2000 merger a &quot;mistake&quot; and sought Higher Education Funding Council for England finance to transfer Wye campus to the University of Kent or a local technical college. As a result of these problems newly installed provost, Tim Clark resigned to be replaced by Jeff Waage. In public however, Imperial College began promoting Wye to potential students.

The Higher Education Funding Council did agree to meet legitimate costs Imperial College incurred in the 2000 merger. Imperial claimed £10.2 million. In 2002, the sum to be paid was settled at £2.5 million.

During a 2003 lecture to civil engineering students Sykes expressed concern about the integration of Wye College into Imperial College and stated it was not a part of his &quot;vision&quot; for Imperial College. By then student admissions to Wye were at record high levels, notably from EU residents on Agricultural Business Management courses, and research income was growing.

The campus met its first set of financial targets but was disadvantaged by Imperial College&#x27;s policy to allocate property and occupancy costs at a flat rate across all its sites. Intensively used city centre premises in South Kensington were being charged the same rate per floor area as the many acres of glasshouses at Wye. In private, Imperial College rejected Wye&#x27;s Department of Agricultural Science business plan for 2004 / 2005.
In 2004 Leszek Borysiewicz, Imperial College&#x27;s deputy rector informed staff that Wye&#x27;s Department of Agricultural Sciences was closing and most teaching and research at Wye would end. Provost, Jeff Waage protested then resigned. The sudden announcement was blamed on the department&#x27;s financial performance; distance between Wye and London, and low academic grades among applicants for agriculture courses. Critics argued these were all matters well known to Imperial College before merger.

====Imperial College scheme====

In 2005, Imperial College announced it intended to convert Wye College&#x27;s estate into a research centre for non-food crops and biomass fuels, and that it had support from Kent County Council and Ashford Borough Council. Later accounts included commercial biofuel production facilities on Wibberley Way and BP suggested as putative partner / operator. Leaked documents revealed Imperial College expected to gain £100 million by building 4,000 houses on in the Kent Downs, provoking national as well as local opposition.

Imperial College&#x27;s project team had spent at least £850,000 on external consultants preparing their &quot;Wye Park&quot; masterplan, and subsequently paid Bell Pottinger to lobby regional and national government in its favour.

The plan was seen as a test case for other attempts to build on Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty. In 2006, Ashford Borough Council withdrew support, and Imperial College abandoned its plans. Campaigners hailed the decision as a key victory preserving the status of protected areas, and Wye as a village.

====Closure====

In 2007, the University of Kent ran undergraduate business management courses from Wye College though later transferred them to its main campus. The following year science staff relocated from Wye to Imperial College&#x27;s South Kensington or Silwood Park sites and in 2009, the last students graduated and Wye College campus closed. Thereafter Imperial College sought to develop the estate, or to find suitable tenants for it.

The main village properties were sold to Telereal Trillium in 2015. Further sales included Squires Hostel as three dwellings; Wolfson Hostel as a site for six houses; the buildings opposite the college on High Street, and the pig, sheep and poultry (Agricultural Field Station / Farm Mechanisation Unit).

In 2021, Telereal Trillium obtained planning permission to convert the traditional college buildings to 38 dwellings. Conditions require public access one day a month to the cloistered quadrangle; Old lecture theatre; Old Hall; Parlour, and Jacobean staircase, and use of the Chapel for public worship. The former estates office area is reserved for charity, Wye Heritage. Imperial College&#x27;s endowment fund retains ownership of the Wye College farmland.

==Estate and facilities==
Wye College&#x27;s estate extended to about , largely between the villages of Wye and Brook. The college farmed approximately , and was employed for horticulture, both on a commercial basis. The remainder accommodated hop gardens, woodland, recreation space, research facilities and buildings.

By 1984, the college owned much of Wye village across the High Street from its main entrance, over to Bridge Street and some premises on Oxenturn Road. That was variously used for administration, student hostels, car parking, a clinic, laundry and offices. Outside the village Wye College owned the NIAB facility at Coldharbour Farm; the MAFF / Defra regional offices and laboratories on Olantigh Road; Regional Veterinary Investigation Centre / Edward Partridge House off Coldharbour Lane; Withersdane Hall, Agricultural Field Centre / Farm Mechanisation Unit / Poultry Research; beagle kennels; Court Lodge; Brook Agricultural Museum; sport fields on Cherry Garden Lane, and an SSSI site at Wye Crown and quarry.

By 2005, teaching and research resources included extensive glasshouses; climate-controlled growth rooms; a containment facility for transgenic plants; dedicated laboratories for plant molecular biology; genomics and gene sequencing; electron microscopy; use of radiochemicals; soil analysis, and plant/animal cell culture. Research was carried out at dairy, pig, hop and sheep enterprises on the college&#x27;s farm; in the horticulture department; on the chalk grasslands, and among commercial crops.

===Layout===

===Student accommodation===

Student bedrooms were provided at Withersdane Hall, or on the first floor of the main campus above teaching and administration space. Alternatively, the college owned student hostels in Wye village. Some of the hostels were self catering. Other student accommodation was available in college and privately owned houses.

===Old Flying Horse===

The hostel directly facing the main college entrance across High Street had been an inn, and before that medieval hall-house. Fourteenth century painted decoration and a dais canopy to protect guests from falling soot and sparks survived into the 20th century.

===Cloister===


===Painted glass===

In about 1996, it was discovered the low ground floor window from the college&#x27;s cloistered quadrangle to Wye Churchyard was medieval painted glass and bore the crest of both&#x27;s founder, Cardinal Kempe. The window was in a precarious position by the publicly accessible churchyard on the one side, and in a space used for student parties and ball games on the other. The college decided to replace it with a modern replica and sell the original. York Minster purchased the medieval glass at auction and incorporated it in their new Zouche Chapel, with other glasswork relating to Kempe.

===Latin School===

The building may not have consistently been used as a schoolroom. As early as the 16th century, references suggest it was employed as a chapel. In 1903, a brick extension was added to accommodate a billiard table. The existing jacobean fireplace was moved and incorporated into the new structure.

During WWII the building, along with the college&#x27;s Old Lecture Theatre, was used for briefings by General Montgomery.

Following college closure the Latin School was briefly occupied by community group Wye Heritage, as an exhibition and event space, but in 2021 Telereal Trillium obtained planning permission for conversion to residential use.

===Old Hall===


The minstrels&#x27; gallery is a 1946 embellishment, opposite the dais end of the hall.

===Parlour===

To the left of the parlour&#x27;s cloister entrance is the door to what was , a large medieval wine cellar.

===Withersdane Hall===

Wye&#x27;s College&#x27;s Withersdane Hall was the country&#x27;s first, post war, purpose built hall of residence though constructed around a pre-existing mansion. It included Swanley Hall auditorium; facilities for breakfast catering; lounges; laundry; formal gardens; tennis courts; woodland car parking; extensive lawns, and could be configured as a residential conference centre. CEAS operated from premises on the site. Between 1986 and 1993 Lloyds Bank, Dunstan Skilbeck and Bernard Sunley halls of residence were added to the complex.

The name Withersdane derives from &quot;Wider&#x27;s Farmstead&quot;, being &quot;Widres tun&quot; in Old English. &quot;Tun&quot; became corrupted to &quot;don&quot;, &quot;den&quot; and then finally to the present name. In the 18th century, Hasted described&quot; Withersden&quot; as a hamlet, formerly a manor, &quot;full of small inclosures, and the soil deeper&quot;.
The original Withersane Hall was constructed in the early 1810s as a grand country mansion near the site known for its curative mineral well named for Saint Eustace.

Russell Hoban repurposed Withersdane as &quot;Widders Dump&quot; in his 1980, post apocalyptic novel &quot;Riddley Walker&quot;. Wye became &quot;How&quot;; The Devil&#x27;s Kneading Trough, &quot;Mr Clevvers Roaling Place&quot;, and Pet Street, &quot;Pig Sweet&quot;.


===Jacobean staircase===

The grade I listed, Jacobean, three flight staircase adjacent to Wye College&#x27;s cloister has been compared in significance to the grand staircases at Knole House. Its seven newel finials are large painted statues, two male and seven female, commonly referred to as the &quot;Ancient Britons&quot;. The largest male of the chestnut, Flemish style figures is believed to represent Hercules. They were separated from the newel posts for protection against students who &quot; them&quot;, and placed for safe display on the nearby Old Hall&#x27;s minstrels&#x27; gallery.

Imperial College sold the statues in 2009 as &quot;reproductions&quot;. English Heritage and Ashford Borough Council ordered that Imperial College repurchase and return them, which it did.

===Students&#x27; Union===


A dedicated Students&#x27; Union complete with swimming pool opened in 1974, replacing the Wheelroom complex.
The Wye College Union of Students was NUS affiliated and a constituent union of ULU. Originally established at the South Eastern Agricultural College in 1894, in 2000 it merged with Imperial College Union.

===Wye Crown and quarry===


During a parish meeting in 1902, the South Eastern Agricultural College&#x27;s principal offered to celebrate the coronation of King Edward VII with a hill figure, carved into the North Downs scarp, above the college. Horses and humans carved into hillsides are well known, but the tall crown motif chosen was to be unique. It had to be distorted to take account of the viewpoint below and took 35 students four spring days, and 7,000 wheelbarrow loads of turf, soil and chalk to excavate. The King&#x27;s 30 June coronation was delayed by illness, but there was still a bonfire on the Crown. When the coronation did take place on 7 August the Crown was illuminated by 1,500 candles. The King was able to view the Crown himself, as a guest of Baron Frederic John Gerard at Eastwell Manor, two years later when it was lit by electric light.

To mark the 1977 retirement of principal Harry Darling, before Wye College owned the crown field, students pegged out &quot;Goodbye Harry&quot; and marked it with herbicide, visible for all to see across the Stour Valley.

In 1991, gabions, filled with white-washed flint, were embedded at a cost of £29,000 to delineate the motif and reduce maintenance. Previously students had regularly scoured the exposed chalk and rebuilt its edges. The work was followed up in 2003, when a bench and carved slate compass rose were installed above the Crown, on the North Downs Way. The Millennium waymarker identifies directions to historic towns including Canterbury, Hastings and York, and is inscribed with the motto &quot;Floreat Wye&quot; or &quot;may Wye flourish&quot;. It rests on a time capsule containing articles relating to the area.

Wye Crown has been a focus of celebrations for royal and national occasions, as well as Wye College students&#x27; charity week bonfires. In 2020, the Crown was illuminated to mark the 75th anniversary of VE Day, although during World War I and II it had to be camouflaged from enemy aircraft to prevent use as a navigation landmark.

Behind the bench and way marker are numerous small hollows believed to be ancient ironstone pits. The features acquired a mythology among Wye College students and spoof traditions were attributed to inscriptions on stone tablets supposedly found there.

The college&#x27;s former quarry, below Wye Crown was a source of flint and chalk, the chalk likely burnt for construction lime. Wye College students used it for clay pigeon shooting and spectacular parties, causing marginally less disruption than the machine gun training there during World War II. In 1991, part of the slope was converted to seating arranged as a natural, outdoor amphitheatre.

Wye Crown and quarry form part of the Wye National Nature Reserve. Its thin, seasonally grazed chalk grassland provides an ideal habitat for orchids.

==Legacy activities==

===External Programme===

The Wye College External Programme, established in 1988 under Ian Carruthers and Henry Bernstein, was the first use of exclusively, distance learning by the University of London. The programme built upon Wye&#x27;s established research and teaching links to the rural developing world, especially in Africa and combined resources from existing departments to offer rural development and other cross disciplinary MSc and Postgraduate Diploma courses.

Developing the 50 courses cost Wye College £2 million. Learning resources were initially on paper, supplemented by audio cassettes; videotapes, and 24-hour telephone support. The World Wide Web was embraced later.

The programme received a Queen&#x27;s Anniversary Prize for Education in 1994, the first year the awards were granted. A citation commended the unique programme for providing quality professional development to agriculturalists at a third the cost of overseas students in the UK, and its ability to project even into war torn countries thereby assisting their recovery.

By 2000, Wye&#x27;s External Programme had 975 mid-career professionals registered from 120 countries, and was growing. In 2007, it became the Centre for Development, Environment and Policy of SOAS, albeit initially from the Wye campus. This arrangement allowed enrolled students to be awarded their contracted &quot;University of London&quot; degrees but deprived Imperial College of a programme it had been enthusiastic about acquiring.

===Hop research===

Mycologist and accomplished tennis player, Ernest Stanley Salmon established a systematic hop breeding programme at the college in 1906. It was the world&#x27;s first, and a model for those that followed. The importance of his work was rapidly understood so while the college&#x27;s other hop gardens were grubbed out in 1917 to grow potatoes and support the war effort, Salmon&#x27;s trial plots were spared.

Seeking fungal resistance he crossed European plants with seeds grown on from a wild Manitoban hop cutting, and thence bred varieties including &quot;Brewer&#x27;s Gold&quot; (1934), &quot;Bullion&quot; (1938), and &quot;Northern Brewer&quot; (1944). It was estimated in 2005 that over half of all hops grown commercially worldwide were descended from Salmon&#x27;s original seedlings. Ray Neve succeeded Salmon in 1953 producing varieties such as &quot;Wye Northdown&quot; (1971), &quot;Wye Challenger&quot; (1971), and &quot;Wye Target&quot; (1972).

In 1981, Peter Darby took over the programme focussing on dwarf hops such as &quot;First Gold&quot; (1995); aphid resistance (&quot;Boadicea&quot;, 2004), and flavour. At that time, the college&#x27;s breeding programme was producing 30,000 plants a year to evaluate.

The unit merged into the newly formed Horticulture Research Institute in 1985; through subsequent consolidation became part of Horticulture Research International in 1990, and spun off with East Malling Research Station to form East Malling Research in 2004. As Imperial College sought to close their Wye campus in 2007, hop research activities transferred to Wye Hops Ltd, a subsidiary of the British Hop Association, based at China Farm, Upper Harbledown. , Wye Hops&#x27; national hop variety collection has been relocated to Shepherd Neame&#x27;s Queen&#x27;s Court at Faversham.

===&quot;Cyclamen persicum&quot;===

In the 1960s, Allan Jackson&#x27;s breeding programme at Wye crossed large flowered cyclamen with wild forms, producing smaller houseplants with scented, elongated flowers and attractively marked foliage. These became known commercially as the &quot;Wye College Hybrids&quot; and , continue to be produced.

The hybrid varieties include &quot;Wye Downland&quot; (white), &quot;Admiral&quot; (orchid-mauve), &quot;Peacock&quot; (pinky / red) and &quot;Fritillary&quot; (dark-red and jewel colours). Those named after butterflies are fragrant and breed true to the colour of their namesakes.

===Biological pest control===

explored biological methods of pest control and facilitated their widespread adoption. Mike Copeland&#x27;s entomology team harnessed Australian ladybirds, and parasitic wasps to suppress mealy bug and soft scale insect pests. He launched Wye Bugs at the 1991 Chelsea Flower Show to make insect controls available to ordinary gardeners, and with the subsequent closure of Wye Campus to facilitate continued research. Wye Bugs occupied glasshouses and laboratory facilities to the north of Occupation Road but by 2019, when that site was presented for development, moved south of the track.

, Wye Bugs supply biological control insects and pest deterrents, mainly on a wholesale basis.

===John Nix Pocketbook===
John Nix published the first edition of his &quot;Farm Management Pocketbook&quot; in 1966 and sales were estimated at 250,000 copies by the time he retired in 1989. As of 2022, it is in its 55th edition and known as the &quot;John Nix Pocketbook for Farm Management&quot;. Contents include information for budgeting, or benchmarking, that seeks to anticipate forthcoming trends.

For many years, Nix&#x27;s colleague in the Wye College Farm Business Unit, Paul Hill, researched and co-authored the pocketbook. Nix died in 2018, and his pocketbook is published, , by The Andersons Centre.

It was described in the &quot;International Journal of Agricultural Management&quot; as a &quot;standard reference for business in agriculture&quot;.

===Brook Agricultural Museum===


In 1948, Wye College agreed to be custodian to a collection of old agricultural implements acquired by former staff members. Students including Michael Nightingale undertook the transfer, cataloguing and arrangement of items, from East Malling Research Station to Coldharbour Farm. When Wye College purchased Court Lodge Farm, Brook in 1957, the growing collection was transferred to the 14th century crown post roof Manorial Barn there.

In 1996 the college decided to sell the adjoining Principal&#x27;s House at Court Lodge. Wye Rural Museum Trust, again led by Michael Nightingale, was established to take over the collection. With help from grants and donations the trust purchased its barn at Brook in 1997.

, the museum operates regular summer opening hours to the public.

===CEAS===


The Centre for European Agricultural Studies was conceived at Wye College in 1971, within the Department of Agricultural Economics. As the UK joined the European Common Market, agricultural affairs in Britain were expected to be strongly influenced by Europe&#x27;s Common Agricultural Policy. The centre was intended to be an independent research centre focused on implications for UK food, farming and rural communities of these new policy directions.

A 1973 appeal raised £463,000 to support the research and in 1975, Henry Plumb opened the purpose-built £650,000 premises and European Documentation Centre at Withersdane Hall. The Frank Parkinson Lecture Theatre there was supported by a grant from the Frank Parkinson Agricultural Trust and incorporated facilities for live translation of speakers. Space was provided to accommodate visiting academics.

By 1990, CEAS was providing a venue for the Worshipful Company of Farmers Advanced Management Course and specialist training to Lloyds and National Westminster Bank. The conference facility had a turnover of £200,000 and was booked up two years in advance.

CEAS Consultants (Wye) Ltd incorporated in 1985 to undertake CEAS&#x27;s commercial consultancy work, and Wye College held a ownership stake that subsequently passed to Imperial College. By 1990, it had established a satellite office in Brussels. In 2006, CEAS Consultants (Wye) Ltd moved from Withersdane Hall to Bramble Lane, Wye and , it operates, as Agra CEAS Consultants Ltd, at an address in Berkshire.

Following changes to Common Agricultural Policy priorities, the centre was renamed the &quot;Centre for European Agri-Environmental Studies&quot;. In 2006, it left the closing Wye Campus and became a Centre of the University of Kent in Canterbury.

==Wye College Beagles==

John Stevens established a Wye College Beagle pack in 1947, encouraged by principal Dunstan Skilbeck who was chairman from 1947 to 1967, and the endeavour was largely run by students of the college. It disbanded in 2014, having been independent of the college since 2008 when the campus closed.

The first kennelman lived in an old double decker bus by the kennels, but as facilities developed &quot;Beagle Cottage&quot; was made available by the college to his successors.

Supporters of the beagle pack ran annual horse, and terrier shows from the 1950s to 1980s, and also a hunt ball and puppy show. Opponents of hunting within the college&#x27;s student body organised their alternative &quot;Anti-hunt Ball&quot; on the same evening as the beagle hunt ball.

In 1988, at the invitation of
Simon Block, Lay Sheriff, Wye College&#x27;s beagles led the Lord Mayor&#x27;s Parade through the City of London. They were accommodated the night before at Knightsbridge Barracks.

Wye College Beagles achieved national prominence in 2001 when Animal Liberation Front activists raided their kennels and took approximately 47 of the pack. It was reported the beagles had only caught one hare in the previous year.

==In popular culture==

In the 1992 Darling Buds of May episode &quot;Stranger at the Gates&quot;, Pop Larkin&#x27;s visit to the Kent County Council&#x27;s offices is filmed at the college.

2007 television drama &quot;Cape Wrath&quot; includes scenes filmed at Wye College. The Old Lecture Theatre&#x27;s steeply tiered, &quot;student-proof&quot; oak benches masquerade as a London academic institution.

==Alumni and staff==

===Agricola Club===

The Wye College Agricola Club is an association of former students and staff of the college. It was founded in 1901 for the South Eastern Agricultural College, and from 1951 to 1995 was named the &quot;Wye College Agricola Club and Swanley Guild&quot;. From 2000 to 2009 it formed part of Imperial College&#x27;s &quot;Imperial Alumni&quot;, but is an independent entity with some 3,000 members. The club publishes an annual journal, &quot;Wye: The Journal of The Wye College Agricola Club&quot;.

<text>The PUMA (ProgrammableUniversalMachine forAssembly&quot;, or Programmable Universal Manipulation Arm&quot;) is an industrial robotic arm developed by Victor Scheinman at pioneering robot company Unimation. Initially developed by Unimation for General Motors, the PUMA was based on earlier designs Scheinman invented while at Stanford University based on sponsorship and mentoring from robot inventor George Devol.

Unimation produced PUMAs for years until being purchased by Westinghouse (ca. 1980), and later by Swiss company Stäubli (1988). Nokia Robotics manufactured about 1500 PUMA robots during the 1980s, the Puma-560 being their most popular model with customers. Some own Nokia Robotics products were also designed, like Nokia NS-16 Industrial Robot or NRS-15 
. Nokia sold their Robotics division in 1990.

In 2002, General Motors Controls, Robotics and Welding (CRW) organization donated the original prototype PUMA robot to the Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s National Museum of American History. It joins a collection of historically important robots that includes an early Unimate and the Odetics Odex 1.

The essence of the design is represented in three categories; 200, 500, and 700 series.
The 200 series is a smaller desktop unit. Notably, this model was used for the first robotic stereotactic brain biopsy in 1985.
The 500 Series and can reach almost 2 meters up. This model is the more popular design and is the most recognizable configuration.
The 700 series is the largest of the group and was intended for assembly line, paint, and welding work.

All designs consist of two main components: the mechanical arm and the control system. These are typically interconnected by one or two large multi-conductor cables. When two cables are used, one carries power to the servo motors and brakes while the second carries the position feedback for each joint back to the control system.

The control computer is based on the LSI-11 architecture which is very similar to PDP11 computers. The system has a boot program and basic debug tool loaded on ROM chips. The operating system is loaded from external storage through a serial port, usually from a floppy disk.

The control unit also contains the servo power supply, analog and digital feedback processing boards, and servo drive system.

The arm appears in the film Innerspace. An arm was displayed in the &quot;Bird And The Robot&quot; attraction at the World of Motion pavilion of EPCOT.

<text>Realm of Impossibility is an action game created by Mike Edwards for Atari 8-bit computers and published by Electronic Arts in 1984. It was originally released in 1983 as Zombies by BRAM, a company formed by Edwards and a friend. BRAM previously developed and published &quot;Attack at EP-CYG-4&quot;.

Electronic Arts ported &quot;Realm of Impossibility&quot; to the Apple II and Commodore 64. A ZX Spectrum version was published in 1985 by Ariolasoft.

==Plot==
The player must traverse 13 dungeons to gather seven crowns to defeat the evil cleric Wistrik.

==Gameplay==
Each dungeon comprises up to a dozen separate rooms, with the game moving from one to another when the player moves reaches the edge of the screen. The player navigates through the rooms to find the treasure: either a crown or a key that provides access to a locked dungeon.

The rooms contain zombies, snakes, spiders and other creatures which cannot be killed. The joystick button drops crosses which block the creatures. A dozen crosses can be present at once, and they disappear slowly over time.

Scrolls can be collected allowing spells to be cast by pressing the first letter of its name on the keyboard:
#&quot;Freeze:&quot; holds a monster in place for a short duration
#&quot;Protect:&quot; makes the player immune to damage for a time
#&quot;Confuse:&quot; makes the monster wander in a daze for a while

Two players can play cooperatively on the same screen. This doubles the number of crosses visible at once. Both players need to reach the edge of the screen to cause it to move to the next screen.

==Development==
Edwards worked at Boeing. When his job changed and he was no longer programming at work, he became interested in the home computer market as a way to continue programming. Checking over various models at a local computer store, he purchased an Atari after seeing &quot;Star Raiders&quot;. After having the machine for a while he began programming on it and, at the suggestion of a long-time friend, wrote a simple program in Atari BASIC to sell locally as a tax dodge.

He then began programming his first game, &quot;Attack at EP-CYG-4&quot;, a shoot &#x27;em up which allowed two players at once. This was licensed to another company for sale on game cartridge, with Edwards helping with the port. He then began work on a maze game, which became &quot;Zombies&quot; after adding in 3D effects at the prompting of his partner. The game contained several levels of increasing complexity. The last level, &quot;The Realm of Impossibility&quot;, contained a number of optical illusions similar to those popularized by artist M. C. Escher. Surfaces that appear vertical turn out to be horizontal, and other illusions can confuse the player.

The success of the original release prompted Don Daglow to acquire the rights for EA. Minor changes were made to the game, new levels were added, and a new soundtrack was added, written by Dave Warhol who had worked with Daglow on the Intellivision game design team. Officially renamed &quot;Mike Edwards&#x27; Realm of Impossibility&quot;, it was released not long after the original BRAM release, with the box cover touting &quot;Deluxe Edition of The Classic Game Zombies&quot;. The game was part of the &quot;third wave&quot; of titles introduced by Electronic Arts after its founding in 1982.

==Reception==
&quot;ROM&quot;″s review praised the game&#x27;s unusual lack of weapons and use of 3D graphics. &quot;Antic&#x27;s&quot; review of the original stated that &quot;computer enthusiasts who enjoy quick-paced, challenging action games will like &quot;Zombies&quot;&quot;.

&quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; said of the revised version: &quot;I do not feel that the changes [from &quot;Zombies&quot;] are numerous-enough or significant enough to justify buying the both games. However, if you have neither, then ROI is a good addition to your arcade-action game inventory&quot;. Steve Panak of &quot;ANALOG Computing&quot; wrote: &quot;Your problem is that you must be perfectly immobile to cast your spell, and in this game you can&#x27;t afford to stand still too often, or for very long&quot;. He disliked the defensive nature of the game, wanting a way to destroy his pursuers. He concluded, &quot;while the &quot;Realm of Impossibility&quot; fails on many levels, it is still not bad enough to make me lose faith in Electronic Arts&quot;. &quot;COMPUTE!&quot; called it &quot;a classic, run-as-fast-as-you-can, three- dimensional arcade game with a goal&quot;, noting that &quot;what distinguishes &quot;Realm of Impossibility&quot; from the run-of-the-mill chase game is not the three dimensions, but one element: cooperation&quot;. The magazine praised the Apple II version&#x27;s graphics and two-player mode. 

Ariolasoft&#x27;s conversion of the game to the ZX Spectrum garnered negative reviews. &quot;Your Sinclair&quot; critic gave it a three out of ten, describing it as an &quot;object lesson in flickery sprites, bad control and the odd bug or three&quot;. &quot;Crash&quot; scored it a 10%, calling it &quot;one of the worst Spectrum games I&#x27;ve seen in a long while&quot;; it &quot;could have been a passable game a couple of years ago. A joke today&quot;. The game took third place for the magazine&#x27;s 1986 readers&#x27; award for &quot;Least Pleasing Game&quot;, garnering 4.5% of all votes.

<text>&quot;On, Wisconsin!&quot; is the fight song of the Wisconsin Badgers at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. A version with modified lyrics is the official state song of Wisconsin.

&quot;On, Wisconsin!&quot; was also the cry that Arthur MacArthur Jr. used in the Battle of Chattanooga at Missionary Ridge in the Civil War.

==History ==
The tune was composed in 1909 by William T. Purdy as &quot;Minnesota, Minnesota,&quot; with the intention of entering it into a competition for a new fight song at the University of Minnesota.

Carl Beck, a former Wisconsin student, convinced him to withdraw it from the contest at the last minute and allow his alma mater to use it instead. Beck then wrote the original, football-oriented lyrics, changing the words &quot;Minnesota, Minnesota&quot; to &quot;On, Wisconsin! On, Wisconsin!&quot; (The eventual winner of the competition became known as the Minnesota Rouser.)

The lyrics were rewritten for the state song in 1913 by Judge Charles D. Rosa and J. S. Hubbard. The song was widely recognized as the state song at that time but was never officially designated. Finally, in 1959, &quot;On, Wisconsin!&quot; was codified in Chapter 170, Laws of 1959, and is incorporated in Section 1.10 of the statutes.

&quot;On, Wisconsin!&quot; was regarded by John Philip Sousa as &quot;the finest of college marching songs&quot;. It has become one of the most popular fight songs in the country, with some 2,500 schools using some variation of it as their school song. There have been persistent rumors that the rights to the song are owned by Paul McCartney or Michael Jackson. The song is actually in the public domain in the United States. The international rights are unclear.

==Lyrics==
Modified lyrics for the state song:
== Battle cry ==
&quot;On, Wisconsin!&quot; was the cry that Arthur MacArthur Jr. used in the Battle of Chattanooga at Missionary Ridge during the American Civil War. He seized the regimental colors and rallied his regiment with &quot;On, Wisconsin!&quot;, for which he was awarded the Medal of Honor.

==Ownership==
In the early 1980s, after the purchase of Edwin H. Morris &amp; Company, lawyers working for Paul McCartney attempted to claim copyrights for several well-known songs, including &quot;On, Wisconsin!&quot; The entire catalog was later sold to Michael Jackson. When the copyright claim was initially made, public outcry demanded that the copyright be deeded over to the State of Wisconsin as the copyright holders were demanding royalties for performance. The matter was resolved quietly; however, rumors persist that McCartney or Jackson&#x27;s estate holds the claim. The song remains in the public domain.

<text>The 1965 Canadian federal election was held on November 8, 1965 to elect members of the House of Commons of Canada of the 27th Parliament of Canada. The Liberal Party of Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson was re-elected with a larger number of seats in the House. Although the Liberals lost a small share of the popular vote, they were able to win more seats, falling just short of a majority.

==Overview==
The Liberals campaigned on their record of having kept the promises made in the 1963 campaign, which included job creation, lowering income taxes, higher wages, higher family allowances and student loans. They promised to implement a national Medicare program by 1967, and the Canada Pension Plan system of public pensions. The party also urged voters to give them a majority for &quot;five more years of prosperity&quot;. The party campaigned under the slogans, &quot;Good Things Happen When a Government Cares About People&quot;, and, &quot;For Continued Prosperity&quot;. However, the Liberals came up two seats short of a majority, largely due to being virtually nonexistent in the Prairies for the second consecutive election. They actually lost five seats in the region, the only survivor being Veterans Affairs Minister Roger Teillet.

The Progressive Conservative Party of John Diefenbaker, campaigning with the slogan, &quot;Policies for People, Policies for Progress&quot;, gained a small number of seats. Despite losing a second time, Diefenbaker refused to resign as party leader, and was eventually forced from the position by a campaign by the party president Dalton Camp. Diefenbaker subsequently ran for re-election as leader in the party&#x27;s 1967 leadership convention, but lost to Robert Stanfield.

Old age pensions were an important issue in this campaign. The Liberal Party pointed to having increased the pension to $75 per month for persons 70 years of age and older, planned to reduce the eligibility age to 65 by 1970 and also promised a &quot;Canada Assistance Program&quot; payment for seniors with lower incomes. The PCs promised to increase OAP to $100 per month for all those 70 years old and over.

The New Democratic Party of Tommy Douglas, campaigning under the slogan, &quot;Fed up? Speak up! Vote for the New Democrats!&quot;, increased its share of the popular vote by more than four and a half percentage points, and became the third largest party in the House of Commons. However, it won only four more seats as it continued to fail to make the electoral break-through that was hoped for when the party was founded in 1960.

The Social Credit Party of Canada split in two before this election. Réal Caouette led French-Canadian Socreds out of the party into the new &quot;Ralliement créditiste&quot; (Social Credit Rally) but lost more than half of the party&#x27;s Quebec seats. Robert N. Thompson continued to lead the Social Credit Party in English-speaking Canada, and actually managed to gain one seat outside Quebec although it was still fewer than the French-Canadian breakaway party. However, even the combined seat totals of the two factions would not have been enough to prevent the NDP from replacing Social Credit as the third largest party. The election would be the last time that the Social Credit Party elected federal candidates outside Quebec.

This was the first election for the Rhinoceros Party of Canada, a satirical party led by Cornelius the First. The party fielded only one candidate. Cornelius, a resident of the Granby zoo, did not seek election because Canadian election law does not permit rhinoceroses (or other zoo animals) to be nominated.

In order to govern, the minority Liberals relied on the New Democratic Party and occasionally other smaller opposition parties in order to remain in power. Pearson announced his intention to resign as Liberal leader in December 1967 and was replaced the following April by Pierre Trudeau.

Notably, this election marked the last time that a single conservative party did not win an absolute majority of the vote in Alberta (although the totals of the Progressive Conservatives and Social Credit combined did add up to over two thirds of the vote in that province).

<text>The trifoliate orange, Citrus trifoliata (syn. Poncirus trifoliata), is a member of the family Rutaceae. Whether the trifoliate oranges should be considered to belong to their own genus, &quot;Poncirus&quot;, or be included in the genus &quot;Citrus&quot; is debated. The species is unusual among citrus for having deciduous, compound leaves and pubescent (downy) fruit.

It is native to northern China and Korea, and is also known as the Japanese bitter-orange (karatachi), hardy orange or Chinese bitter orange.

The plant is a fairly cold-hardy citrus (USDA zone 6) and will tolerate moderate frost and snow, making a large shrub or small tree tall. Because of its relative hardiness, citrus grafted onto &quot;Citrus trifoliata&quot; are usually hardier than when grown on their own roots.

==Description==
The trifoliate orange is recognizable by the large thorns on the shoots, and its deciduous leaves with three (or rarely, five) leaflets, typically with the middle leaflet long, and the two side leaflets long. The flowers are white, with pink stamens, in diameter, larger than those of true citrus but otherwise closely resembling them, except that the scent is much less pronounced than with true citrus. As with true citrus, the leaves give off a spicy smell when crushed.

The fruits are green, ripening to yellow, and in diameter similar in size to a lime and resembling a small orange, but with a finely downy surface and having a fuzzy texture similar to a peach. The fruits also have distinctive smell from other citrus varieties and often contain a high concentration of seeds.

==Uses==

===Cultivation===

The cultivar &#x27;Flying Dragon&#x27; is dwarfed in size, has highly twisted, contorted stems, and has even stronger thorns than the type. It makes an excellent barrier hedge due to its density and strong curved thorns. Such hedges have been grown for over 50 years at Oklahoma State University in Stillwater, and are highly student-proof. The plant is also highly deer-resistant. In central London, mature specimens of the trifoliate orange can be seen in the gardens of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral.

Trifoliate orange and various of its hybrids with other &quot;Citrus&quot; are widely used as citrus rootstock, which are valued for their resistance to cold, the tristeza virus, and the oomycete &quot;Phytophthora parasitica&quot; (root rot).

Recent studies have revealed that the trifoliate orange contains auraptene at a high concentration, which is one of the functional components having immunity against citrus tristeza virus (CTV).

===As food===

Trifoliate orange fruits are very bitter, due in part to their poncirin content. Most people consider them inedible fresh, but they can be made into marmalade. When dried and powdered, they can be used as a condiment.

===Medicine===

====Traditional medicine====

The fruits of the trifoliate orange are widely used in medical traditions of East Asia as a treatment for allergic inflammation.

==Taxonomy==
The trifoliate orange was considered a member of the genus &quot;Citrus&quot; until Walter Swingle (1871 – 1952) moved it in 1943 to its own separate genus, &quot;Poncirus&quot;, based on its deciduous trifoliate leaves differing from other &quot;Citrus&quot; and as part of a larger reclassification that split the historical &quot;Citrus&quot; into seven genera. More recently, David Mabberley and Dianxiang Zhang reunited all of Swingle&#x27;s novel genera back into &quot;Citrus&quot; in 2008. Early phylogenetic analysis of trifoliate orange plastids nested &quot;Poncirus&quot; within the citrus, consistent with a single genus, but the sequencing of the nuclear genome by Wu, &quot;et al.&quot; showed its genome to be most divergent, different enough to justify retention of &quot;Poncirus&quot; as a separate genus. To explain the conflict between the plastid and nuclear genomic analysis, it was speculated that the trifoliate orange is likely either the progeny of an ancient hybridization between a core citrus and an unidentified more distant relative, or at some time in its history it acquired an introgressed cpDNA genome from another species. Ollitrault, Curk and Krueger indicate that the majority of data are consistent with the enlarged &quot;Citrus&quot; that includes the trifoliate orange, though they recognize that many botanists still follow Swingle.

A second species of trifoliate orange native to Yunnan (China) has been reported and named &quot;Poncirus polyandra&quot;. Were &quot;Poncirus&quot; to be subsumed into &quot;Citrus&quot;, where &quot;C. polyandra&quot; is unavailable, the name &quot;Citrus polytrifolia&quot; has been suggested. Zhang and Mabberley concluded this Yunnan cultivar is likely a hybrid between the trifoliate orange and another &quot;Citrus&quot;, but recent genomic analysis of &quot;P. polyandra&quot; showed low levels of heterozygosity, the opposite of what one would expect for a hybrid. This analysis dated its divergence from &quot;P. trifoliata&quot; about 2.82 million years ago.

The trifoliate orange does not naturally interbreed with core &quot;Citrus&quot; taxa due to different flowering times, but hybrids have been produced artificially between the trifoliate orange and other citrus. In the Swingle system, where the trifoliate orange is placed in &quot;Poncirus&quot;, a hybrid genus name has been coined for these intra-generic crosses, &quot;× &quot;Citroncirus&quot;&quot;. The most notable of these are the citrange, a cross between the trifoliate and sweet oranges, and the citrumelo, a hybrid of trifoliate orange and &#x27;Duncan&#x27; grapefruit. Placing the trifoliate orange in &quot;Citrus&quot; would mean these hybrids would no longer be intergeneric, but instead hybrids within &quot;Citrus&quot;. Genomic analysis of a number of these hybrids showed them all to derive from &quot;P. trifoliata&quot; and not &quot;P. polyandra&quot;.
