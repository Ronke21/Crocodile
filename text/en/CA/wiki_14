<doc id="761050" wikidata="Q795982" url="?curid=761050" title="Heermann's gull">
<text>Heermann&#x27;s gull (Larus heermanni) is a gull resident in the United States, Mexico and extreme southwestern British Columbia, nearly all nesting on Isla Rasa in the Gulf of California. They are usually found near shores or well out to sea, very rarely inland. The species is named after Adolphus Lewis Heermann, nineteenth-century explorer and naturalist.

==Description==
This species looks distinctly different from other gulls. Adults have a medium gray body, blackish-gray wings and tail with white edges, and a red bill with a black tip. The head is dusky gray in non-breeding plumage and white in breeding plumage. Immatures resemble non-breeding adults but are darker and browner, and the bill is pink till the second winter. A few birds, no more than 1 in 200, have white primary coverts, which form a showy spot on the upper wing. This gull is unlikely to be confused with other species as it is the only white-headed, gray-bodied gull found on the west coast of North America.

Calls are described as deep and similar in pattern to other gulls but is noticeably different in quality.

==Distribution==

Of the current population of about 150,000 pairs, 90% nest on the island of Isla Rasa off Baja California in the Gulf of California, with smaller colonies as far north as California and as far south as Nayarit. After breeding, birds commonly disperse to central California, and less commonly north as far as British Columbia and south as far as Guatemala. Some birds exhibit strong site fidelity to their nonbreeding territories, including a one-legged gull who resided for 17 years at the Loch Lomond Marina in San Rafael, California.The only known active breeding colony of Heermann&#x27;s gull in the continental United States is located in Seaside, California, when a small number of gulls were observed nesting on artificial fill islands on Roberts Lake as of 1999. After the islands eroded away by 2007, the colony continued to nest on nearby rooftops. In June 2018, one of the colony&#x27;s main nesting sites, the Seaside McDonald&#x27;s, was destroyed by a drunk driving crash. In April 2019, after obtaining a permit from the City of Seaside, the Monterey Audubon Society deployed a floating artificial nesting island in Roberts Lake in an effort to restore nesting territory to the colony.

== Diet ==
Heermann&#x27;s gull eats small fish, marine invertebrates, lizards, insects, refuse, and carrion.

==Behavior==
This species nests colonially on the ground, like many gulls. The nests are often at densities as high as 110 nests per . It lays two or three eggs, grayish buff, to buff with gray and brown markings.

Heermann&#x27;s gull sometimes steals prey from other seabirds, particularly brown pelicans, with which it often associates.

==Status==
Isla Rasa was declared a sanctuary in 1964. Egg-collecting and disturbance during the breeding season are discouraged. With the breeding colony concentrated on one small island this species is vulnerable to a catastrophic weather event. The success of the colony in any one year is dependent on the availability of prey and this is related to the ocean temperature changes brought about by El Niño. These factors have caused the IUCN to rate this bird as &quot;Near Threatened&quot;.

<doc id="761055" wikidata="Q10862754" url="?curid=761055" title="Euler's Disk">
<text>Euler&#x27;s Disk, invented between 1987 and 1990 by Joseph Bendik, is a trademarked scientific educational toy. It is used to illustrate and study the dynamic system of a spinning and rolling disk on a flat or curved surface. It has been the subject of several scientific papers. Bendik named the toy after mathematician Leonhard Euler.

==Discovery==

Joseph Bendik first noted the interesting motion of the spinning disk while working at Hughes Aircraft (Carlsbad Research Center) after spinning a heavy polishing chuck on his desk at lunch one day. 

The apparatus is a dramatic visualization of energy exchanges in three different, tightly coupled processes. As the disk gradually decreases its azimuthal rotation, there is also a decrease in amplitude and increase in the frequency of the disk&#x27;s axial precession.

The evolution of the disk&#x27;s axial precession is easily visualized in a slow motion video by looking at the side of the disk following a single point marked on the disk. The evolution of the rotation of the disk is easily visualized in slow motion by looking at the top of the disk following an arrow drawn on the disk representing its radius. 

As the disk releases the initial energy given by the user and approaches a halt, its rotation about the vertical axis slows, while its contact point oscillation increases. Lit from above, its contact point and nearby lower edge in shadow, the disk appears to levitate before halting.

The commercial toy consists of a heavy, thick chrome-plated steel disk and a rigid, slightly concave, mirrored base. Included holographic magnetic stickers can be attached to the disk, to enhance the visual effect of wobbling. These attachments may make it harder to see and understand the processes at work, however. 

When spun on a flat surface, the disk exhibits a spinning/rolling motion, slowly progressing through varying rates and types of motion before coming to rest. Most notably, the precession rate of the disk&#x27;s axis of symmetry increases as the disk spins down. The mirror base provides a low-friction surface; its slight concavity keeps the disk from &quot;wandering&quot; off the surface. 

Any disk, spun on a reasonably flat surface (such as a coin spun on a table), will exhibit essentially the same type of motion as an Euler Disk, but for a much shorter time. Commercial disks provide a more effective demonstration of the phenomenon, having an optimized aspect ratio and a precision polished, slightly rounded edge to maximize the spinning/rolling time.

==Physics==
A spinning/rolling disk ultimately comes to rest quite abruptly, the final stage of motion being accompanied by a whirring sound of rapidly increasing frequency. As the disk rolls, the point of rolling contact describes a circle that oscillates with a constant angular velocity formula_1. If the motion is non-dissipative (frictionless), formula_1 is constant, and the motion persists forever; this is contrary to observation, since formula_1 is not constant in real life situations. In fact, the precession rate of the axis of symmetry approaches a finite-time singularity modeled by a power law with exponent approximately −1/3 (depending on specific conditions).

There are two conspicuous dissipative effects: rolling friction when the disk slips along the surface, and air drag from the resistance of air. Experiments show that rolling friction is mainly responsible for the dissipation and behavior—experiments in a vacuum show that the absence of air affects behavior only slightly, while the behavior (precession rate) depends systematically on coefficient of friction. In the limit of small angle (i.e. immediately before the disk stops spinning), air drag (specifically, viscous dissipation) is the dominant factor, but prior to this end stage, rolling friction is the dominant effect.

=== Steady motion with the disk center at rest ===
The behavior of a spinning disk whose center is at rest can be described as follows. Let the line from the center of the disk to the point of contact with the plane be called axis formula_4. Since the center of the disk and the point of contact are instantaneously at rest (assuming there is no slipping) axis formula_5 is the instantaneous axis of
rotation. The angular momentum is formula_6 which holds for any thin, circularly symmetric disk with mass formula_7; formula_8 for a disk with mass concentrated at the rim, formula_9 for a uniform disk (like Euler disk), formula_10 is the radius of the disk, and formula_1 is the angular velocity along formula_5.

The contact force formula_13 is formula_14 where formula_15 is the gravitational acceleration and formula_16 is the vertical axis pointing upwards. The torque about the center of mass is formula_17 which we can rewrite as formula_18 where formula_19. We can conclude that both the angular momentum formula_20, and the disk are precessing about the vertical axis formula_21 at rate At the same time formula_22 is the angular velocity of the point of contact with the plane. With axis formula_23 defined to lie along the symmetry axis of the disk and pointing downwards, it holds that formula_24, where formula_25 is the inclination angle of the disc with respect to the horizontal plane. The angular velocity can be thought of as composed of two parts formula_26, where formula_27 is the angular velocity of the disk along its symmetry axis. From the geometry it is easily concluded that:

formula_28

Plugging formula_29 into equation () finally gets 
As formula_25 adiabatically approaches zero, the angular velocity of the point of contact formula_22 becomes very large, making a high-frequency sound associated with the spinning disk. However, the rotation of the figure on the face of the coin, whose angular velocity is formula_32 approaches zero. The total angular velocity formula_33 also vanishes as well as the total energy

formula_34

as formula_25 approaches zero, using the equation (). 

As formula_25 approaches zero the disk finally loses contact with the table and the disk then quickly settles on to the horizontal surface. One hears sound at a frequency formula_37, which becomes dramatically higher, formula_38, as the figure rotation rate slows, formula_39, until the sound abruptly ceases.

=== Levitation illusion ===

As a circularly symmetric disk settles, the separation between a fixed point
on the supporting surface and the moving disk above oscillates at increasing frequency, in sync with the rotation axis angle off vertical.

The levitation illusion results when the disk edge reflects light when tilted slightly up above the supporting surface, and in shadow when tilted slightly down in contact. The shadow is not perceived, and the rapidly flashing reflections from the edge above supporting surface are perceived as steady elevation. See persistence of vision.

The levitation illusion can be enhanced by optimizing the curve of the lower edge so the shadow line remains high as the disk settles. A mirror can further enhance the effect by hiding the support surface and showing separation between
moving disk surface and mirror image.

Disk imperfections, seen in shadow, that could hamper the illusion, can be hidden in a skin pattern that blurs under motion.

==== US Quarter example ====

A clean US Quarter (minted 1970–2022), rotating on a flat hand mirror, viewed from the side near the mirror surface, demonstrates the phenomenon for a few seconds.

Lit by a point source directly over the center of the soon to settle quarter,
side ridges are illuminated when the rotation axis is away from the viewer,
and in shadow when the rotation axis is toward the viewer. Vibration blurs the ridges and heads or tails is too foreshortened to show rotation.

== History of research ==
=== Moffatt ===
In the early 2000s, research was sparked by an article in the April 20, 2000 edition of &quot;Nature&quot;, where Keith Moffatt showed that viscous dissipation in the thin layer of air between the disk and the table would be sufficient to account for the observed abruptness of the settling process. He also showed that the motion concluded in a finite-time singularity. His first theoretical hypothesis was contradicted by subsequent research, which showed that rolling friction is actually the dominant factor.

Moffatt showed that, as time formula_40 approaches a particular time formula_41 (which is mathematically a constant of integration), the viscous dissipation approaches infinity. The singularity that this implies is not realized in practice, because the magnitude of the vertical acceleration cannot exceed the acceleration due to gravity (the disk loses contact with its support surface). Moffatt goes on to show that the theory breaks down at a time formula_42 before the final settling time formula_41, given by

:formula_44

where formula_10 is the radius of the disk, formula_15 is the acceleration due to Earth&#x27;s gravity, formula_47 the dynamic viscosity of air, and formula_7 the mass of the disk. For the commercially available Euler&#x27;s Disk toy (see link in &quot;External links&quot; below), formula_42 is about formula_50 seconds, at which time the angle between the coin and the surface, formula_25, is approximately 0.005 radians and the rolling angular velocity, formula_22, is about 500 Hz.

Using the above notation, the total spinning/rolling time is:

:formula_53

where formula_54 is the initial inclination of the disk, measured in radians. Moffatt also showed that, if formula_55, the finite-time singularity in formula_22 is given by

:formula_57

===Experimental results===
Moffatt&#x27;s theoretical work inspired several other scientists to experimentally investigate the dissipative mechanism of a spinning/rolling disk, with results that partially contradicted his explanation. These experiments used spinning objects and surfaces of various geometries (disks and rings), with varying coefficients of friction, both in air and in a vacuum, and used instrumentation such as high speed photography to quantify the phenomenon.

In the 30 November 2000 issue of &quot;Nature&quot;, physicists Van den Engh, Nelson and Roach discuss experiments in which disks were spun in a vacuum. Van den Engh used a rijksdaalder, a Dutch coin, whose magnetic properties allowed it to be spun at a precisely determined rate. They found that slippage between the disk and the surface could account for observations, and the presence or absence of air only slightly affected the disk&#x27;s behavior. They pointed out that Moffatt&#x27;s theoretical analysis would predict a very long spin time for a disk in a vacuum, which was not observed.

Moffatt responded with a generalized theory that should allow experimental determination of which dissipation mechanism is dominant, and pointed out that the dominant dissipation mechanism would always be viscous dissipation in the limit of small formula_25 (i.e., just before the disk settles). 

Later work at the University of Guelph by Petrie, Hunt and Gray showed that carrying out the experiments in a vacuum (pressure 0.1 pascal) did not significantly affect the energy dissipation rate. Petrie &quot;et al.&quot; also showed that the rates were largely unaffected by replacing the disk with a ring shape, and that the no-slip condition was satisfied for angles greater than 10°. Another work by Caps, Dorbolo, Ponte, Croisier, and Vandewalle has concluded that the air is a minor source of energy dissipation. The major energy dissipation process is the rolling and slipping of the disk on the supporting surface. It was experimentally shown that the inclination angle, the precession rate, and the angular velocity follow the power law behavior. 

On several occasions during the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike, talk show host Conan O&#x27;Brien would spin his wedding ring on his desk, trying to spin the ring for as long as possible. The quest to achieve longer and longer spin times led him to invite MIT professor Peter Fisher onto the show to experiment with the problem. Spinning the ring in a vacuum had no identifiable effect, while a Teflon spinning support surface gave a record time of 51 seconds, corroborating the claim that rolling friction is the primary mechanism for kinetic energy dissipation.
Various kinds of rolling friction as primary mechanism for energy dissipation have been studied by Leine who confirmed experimentally that the frictional resistance of the movement of the contact point over the rim of the disk is most likely the primary dissipation mechanism on a time-scale of seconds.

== In popular culture ==
Euler&#x27;s Disks appear in the 2006 film &quot;Snow Cake&quot; and in the TV show &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot;, season 10, episode 16, which aired February 16, 2017.

The sound team for the 2001 film &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; used a spinning Euler&#x27;s Disk as a sound effect for torpedoes. A short clip of the sound team playing with Euler&#x27;s Disk was played during the Academy Awards presentations.

The principles of the Euler Disk were used with specially made rings on a table as a futuristic recording medium in the 1960 movie &quot;The Time Machine&quot;.

<text>Pierre Dupont (23 April 1821 – 25 July 1870) was a French songwriter.

Dupont was born in Lyon as the son of a blacksmith. His mother died before he was five years old, and he was brought up in the country by his godfather, a village priest. He was educated at the seminary of L&#x27;Argentière, and was afterwards apprenticed to a notary at Lyon. In 1839 he found his way to Paris, and some of his poems were inserted, in the &quot;Gazette de France&quot; and the &quot;Quotidienne&quot;. Two years later he was saved from the conscription and enabled to publish his first volume – &quot;Les Deux Anges&quot; – through the exertions of a kinsman and of Pierre Lebrun.

In 1842 he received a prize from the Academy, and worked for some time on the official dictionary. Gounod&#x27;s appreciation of his peasant song, &quot;Les Bœufs&quot; (1846), settled his vocation as a songwriter. He had no theoretical knowledge of music, but he composed both the words and the melodies of his songs, the two processes being generally simultaneous. He himself remained so innocent of musical knowledge that he had to engage Ernest Reyer to write down his airs.

He sang his own songs, as they were composed, at the workmen&#x27;s concerts in the Salle de la Fraternité du Faubourg Saint-Denis; the public performance of his famous &quot;Le chant du pain&quot; was forbidden; &quot;Le chant des ouvriers&quot; (1846) was even more popular; and in 1851 he paid the penalty of having become the poet laureate of the socialistic aspirations of the time by being condemned to seven years of exile from France.

The sentence was cancelled, and the poet withdrew for a time from participation in politics. He died at Lyon, where his later years were spent, on 25 July 1870. 

His songs have appeared in various forms:
*&quot;Chants et chansons&quot; (3 vols., with music, 1852–1854)
*&quot;Chants et poesies&quot; (7th edition, 1862)
Among the best-known are &quot;Le Braconnier&quot;, &quot;Le Tisserand&quot;, &quot;La Vache blanche&quot;, &quot;La Chanson du blé&quot;, but many others might be mentioned of equal spontaneity and charm. His later works have not the same merit.

<doc id="761068" wikidata="Q1518223" url="?curid=761068" title="National Assembly of Pakistan">
<text>The National Assembly of Pakistan (, , or ) is the lower house of the bicameral Parliament of Pakistan, with the upper house being the Senate. As of 2023, the National Assembly has a maximum membership of 336, of which 266 are directly elected by an adult universal suffrage and a first-past-the-post system to represent their respective constituencies, while 60 are elected on reserved seats for women and religious minorities from all over the country. Members hold their seats for five years or until the house is dissolved by the President on the advice of the Prime Minister. The house convenes at the Parliament House, Red Zone, Islamabad.

Members are elected through the first-past-the-post system under universal adult suffrage, representing electoral districts known as National Assembly constituencies. According to the constitution, the 70 seats reserved for women and religious minorities are allocated to the political parties according to their proportional representation.

Each National Assembly is formed for a five-year term, commencing from the date of the first sitting, after which it is automatically dissolved. The National Assembly can only be dissolved by the President of Pakistan on the Prime Minister of Pakistan advice, it cannot be dissolved by the Prime Minister alone.

On 3 April 2022, President of Pakistan Arif Alvi dissolved the Assembly Under Section 58-I and 48-I on the advice of Prime Minister Imran Khan. On 7 April, the Supreme Court of Pakistan set aside the dissolution order, restoring the National Assembly. After these events, on 11 April, after National Assembly proceedings, a vote was held on deciding the next prime minister of Pakistan, overseen by Ayaz Sadiq. There were only two candidates contesting, from the PTI, was Shah Mehmood Qureshi, and from the PMLN, Shehbaz Sharif. Before the vote, 123 members of the PTI resigned from the National Assembly. The vote would be conducted under the supervision of Ayaz Sadiq, resulting in the election of Shehbaz Sharif as the Prime Minister of Pakistan. Following this, large political crises occurred across Pakistan in late 2022 and for the duration of 2023 between the ousted Imran Khan and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif until a new assembly was elected in early 2024.

The current National Assembly is the 16th National Assembly of Pakistan, which was formed in February 2024 after the 2024 Pakistani general election. The election was contested for rigging. The 16th assembly has seen various shuffles, including a large bloc of Independent politicians backed by PTI use the Sunni Ittehad Council as a parliamentary vehicle, and several reserved seats being suspended by the Supreme Court of Pakistan due to the &quot;Reserved seats case&quot;.

== History ==

The first session of the first Constituent Assembly of Pakistan was held on 10 August 1947 at Sindh Assembly Building, in Karachi. On 11 August 1947, Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah was elected unanimously as the President of the Constituent Assembly of Pakistan and the National Flag was formally approved by the Assembly.
* On 12 August 1947, a resolution was approved regarding officially addressing Mr. Muhammad Ali Jinnah as &quot;Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah&quot;. On the same day, a special committee called the &quot;Committee on Fundamental Rights of Citizens and Minorities of Pakistan&quot; was appointed to look into and advise the Assembly on matters relating to the fundamental rights of the citizens, particularly the minorities, to legislate on these issues appropriately.
* On 14 August 1947, Lord Mountbatten, Governor General of India, addressed the Constituent Assembly of Pakistan. The transfer of power took place on 15 August. The Quaid gave a reply to the address in the House, on which the principles of the State of Pakistan were laid.
* On 15 August 1947, Quaid-i-Azam was sworn in as the first Governor General of Pakistan. Sir Mian Abdul Rashid, Chief Justice of Pakistan, administered an oath of office from him. The Quaid remained in this position until his death on 11 September 1948.

== Powers ==


The Constitution, which was passed unanimously by the National Assembly in April 1973, provides a federal parliamentary system of government, with the president as the ceremonial head of the state and an elected prime minister as the head of the government. Under Article 50 of the Constitution, the federal legislature is the bicameral Majlis-e-Shoora (Parliament), which comprises the President and the two Houses, the National Assembly and the Senate. The National Assembly, Pakistan&#x27;s sovereign legislative body, makes laws for the federation under powers spelled out in the federal legislative List and also for subjects in the concurrent List, as given in the fourth schedule of the Constitution. Through debates, adjournment motions, question hours, and standing committees, the National Assembly keeps a check on the government. It ensures that the government functions within the parameters set out in the Constitution, and does not violate the people&#x27;s fundamental rights. The Parliament scrutinizes public spending and exercises control of expenditure incurred by the government through the work of the relevant standing committees. The Public Accounts Committee has a special role in reviewing the report of the auditor general. The Senate, the upper house of the Parliament, has equal representation from the federating units balancing the provincial inequality in the National Assembly, where the number of members is based on population of the provinces. The Senate&#x27;s role is to promote national cohesion and harmony and work as a stabilizing factor of the federation. The Senate has 104 members who serve six-year terms which are alternated so that half the senators are up for re-election by the electoral college every three years. The National Assembly consists of 342 members. The Constitution does not empower the President to dissolve the National Assembly. The Senate is not subject to dissolution. Only the Parliament can amend the Constitution, by a two-thirds majority vote separately in each House.

== List of Assemblies ==
== Members of National Assembly ==
=== Qualifications ===
The Constitution of Pakistan lists several requirements for members of the National Assembly in Article 62.

The constitution also details several disqualifications in Article 63, which include mental instability, insolvency, criminal conviction and accepting dual-citizenship or relinquishing Pakistani nationality, among others. Furthermore, candidates found to have opposed Pakistan&#x27;s ideology or worked against the integrity of the country, after its establishment in 1947, are disqualified.

=== National Assembly Composition ===
The National Assembly has 336 members, including 60 seats reserved for women and 10 for Non-Muslims, as per Article 51. The seats in the National Assembly are allocated to each province and the federal capital based on population, as officially published in the preceding census. The present allocation of seats is as under:
=== Tenure ===
The National Assembly is elected for a five-year term based on adult franchise and one person, one vote. The tenure of a Member of the National Assembly is for the duration of the House, or sooner, in case the Member dies or resigns. The tenure of the National Assembly also comes to an end if dissolved on the advice of the Prime Minister or by the President in his discretion under the Constitution. Under the 1973 Constitution, a member of Parliament may not hold the office of the prime minister more than twice. In the 1990s, Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif proposed a bill to amend the 1973 constitution to allow a Member to serve a third term as prime minister.

== Speaker and deputy speaker ==
 According to The Constitution

* (1) After a general election, the National Assembly shall, at its first meeting and to the exclusion of any other business, elect from amongst its members a Speaker and a Deputy Speaker and, so often as the office of Speaker or Deputy Speaker becomes vacant, the Assembly shall elect another member as Speaker or, as the case may be, Deputy Speaker.
* (2) Before entering upon office, a member elected as Speaker or Deputy Speaker shall make before the National Assembly oath in the form set out in the Third Schedule.
* (3) When the office of Speaker is vacant, or the Speaker is absent or is unable to perform his functions due to any cause, the Deputy Speaker shall act as Speaker, and if, at that time, the Deputy Speaker is also absent or is unable to act as Speaker due to any cause, such member as may be determined by the rules of procedure of the Assembly shall preside at the meeting of the Assembly.
* (4) The Speaker or the Deputy Speaker shall not preside at a meeting of the Assembly when a resolution for his removal from office is being considered.
* (5) The Speaker may, by writing under his hand addressed to the President, resign his office.
* (6) The Deputy Speaker may, by writing under his hand addressed to the Speaker, resign his office.
* (7) The office of Speaker or Deputy Speaker shall become vacant if:

# (a) he resigns his office;
# (b) he ceases to be a member of the Assembly;
# (c) he is removed from office by a resolution of the Assembly, of which not less than seven days&#x27; notice has been given and which is passed by the votes of the majority of the total membership of the Assembly.

* (8) When the National Assembly is dissolved the Speaker shall continue in his office till the person elected to fill the office by the next Assembly enters upon his office.

The Speaker of the House is the presiding officer of the National Assembly. The speaker is assisted by the Deputy Speaker. Both officers are elected from within the ranks of the National Assembly and, by current convention, are usually members of the majority party. The election of the two officers is the first matter an incoming National Assembly deals with, as mandated by the constitution. Apart from presiding over National Assembly debates, the Speaker may also assume the duties of Acting President, if the position is vacant (in case the President as well as Chairman Senate are not available).

The current Speaker and Deputy Speaker are Ayaz Sadiq (PMLN) and Syed Ghulam Mustafa Shah (PPP) respectively.

== Sessions ==
The National Assembly is divided into sessions. It had to meet for 130 days before the First Amendment was passed on 8 May 1974 in the constitution of 1973. According to this amendment, the maximum duration between successive sessions was reduced to 90 days from 130 days, and there must be at least three sessions in a year. A session of the National Assembly is summoned by the President under Article 54(1) of the Constitution. In the summoning order, the President gives the date, time, and place (usually the Parliament House), for the National Assembly to meet. The date and time for the summoning of the National Assembly is immediately announced over radio and television. Generally, a copy of the summon is also sent to the Members at their home addresses. The National Assembly can also be summoned by the Speaker of the National Assembly on a request made by one-fourth of the total membership of the National Assembly. If the National Assembly is so requisitioned, it must be summoned within 14 days.

== Procedure ==

=== Constitutional role ===
Article 50 of the Constitution provides that the Parliament shall consist of the president and the two houses known as the National Assembly and the Senate. The National Assembly has an edge over the Senate by legislating exclusively on money matters. With exception to money bills, however, both houses work together to carry out the basic work of the Parliament, i.e. law-making.

=== Legislative procedures ===
The bill relating to the Federal Legislative List can be originated in either house. If the House passes a bill through a majority vote, it shall be transmitted to the other place. If the other house passes it without amendment, it shall be presented to the President for assent.

If the bill, transmitted to the other house, is not passed within ninety days or rejected, it shall be considered in a joint sitting to be summoned by the President at the request of the house in which the bill was originated. If the bill is passed in the joint sitting, with or without amendments, by the votes of the majority of the members of the two houses, it shall be presented to the President for assent.

If the bill is presented to the President for assent, he shall assent to the bill in not later than ten days. If it is not a money bill, the President may return it to the Majlis-e-Shoora with a message requesting that the bill be reconsidered and an amendment specified in the message be considered. The Majlis-e-Shoora shall reconsider the bill in a joint sitting. If the bill is passed again, with or without amendment, by a vote of the majority of the members present and voting, it shall be presented to the President and the President shall give his assent within ten days; failing which such assent shall be deemed to have been given.

Under the Constitution, the Parliament may also legislate for two or more provinces by consent and request made by those provinces. If the federal government proclaims a state of emergency in any province, the power to legislate about that province is vested in the Parliament. But the bills passed by the Parliament during the state of emergency shall cease to be in force after the expiration of six months from the date that the emergency is lifted. Nevertheless, the steps already taken under these acts shall remain valid.

== Leaders ==
=== Leader of the House ===

The Leader of the House is the highest-ranking representative of the majority party in the National Assembly, usually the Prime Minister.

=== Leader of the Opposition ===

The Leader of the Opposition is the highest-ranking representative of the main opposition party.

== Committees ==
While recognizing the Committee System, the committees have been empowered to go into all matters of the ministry. A matter can be remitted to a standing committee by the Speaker or the Assembly suo moto and without moving any motion.

The committees have also been empowered to invite or summon before it any member or any other person having a special interest in any matter under its consideration and may hear expert evidence and hold public hearings.

== Pasban-e-Aman Force ==
In 2023 the National Assembly Secretariat would constitute the &quot;Pasban-e-Aman&quot; (پاسبان امان) Force for the security of the Parliament House. According to the article, the majority of Pasban-e-Aman Force personnel belong to Gujar Khan, the constituency of then NA Speaker Raja Pervez Ashraf. The force is charged with the security of Parliament House and the National Assembly. Security responsibilities the Parliament House has been shifted from Frontier Corps to the new force. Pasban-e-Aman Force Personnel were given anti-terrorism training near Simly Dam, by September 15, 2023 three batches had finished their training. The uniform of the Pasban-e-Aman resembles to that of Elite Force having ATS sign on caps and Pasban-e-Aman written on the right shoulder.

== Composition and elections ==
The Parliament of Pakistan, according to the Constitution of 1973, is bicameral. Article 50 of the Constitution clearly states that the Parliament of Pakistan consists of the President and two Houses known as the National Assembly and the Senate. The composition of the National Assembly is specified in Article 51 of the Constitution of Pakistan. Originally there were 210 National Assembly seats including 10 women which was increased to 237 in 1985 and later to 342. Currently, there are a total of 342 seats in the National Assembly. Of these, 266 are filled by direct elections. In addition, the Pakistani Constitution reserves 10 seats for religious minorities and 60 seats for women, to be filled by proportional representation among parties with more than 5% of the vote. After the 25th Amendment Article 51. (1) There shall be [three hundred and thirty-six] seats for members in the National Assembly, including seats reserved for women and non-Muslims. Article 51. [(3A) Notwithstanding anything contained in clause (3) or any other law for the time being in force, the members of the National Assembly from the Federally Administered Tribal Areas to be elected in the general elections, 2018 shall continue till the dissolution of the National Assembly and thereafter this clause shall stand omitted.

Members of the National Assembly are elected by the people in competitive multi-party elections, to be held at most five years apart on universal adult franchise. To be a member of the electoral college, according to Article 62 of the Constitution, candidates must be citizens of Pakistan and not less than 25 years of age.

== 2024 election ==

== Dissolution ==

The National Assembly can be dissolved at the initiative of the Prime Minister. If dissolved, new elections are conducted for the Assembly. Article 58 of the Constitution of Pakistan deals with the dissolution of the Assembly:

58. Dissolution of the National Assembly:
: (1) The President shall dissolve the National Assembly if so advised by the Prime Minister; and the National Assembly shall, unless sooner dissolved, stand dissolved at the expiration of forty-eight hours after the Prime Minister has so advised.

: (2) Notwithstanding anything contained in clause (2) or Article 48, the President may dissolve the National Assembly at his discretion where a vote of no-confidence having been passed against the Prime Minister, no other member of the National Assembly commands the confidence of the majority of the members of the National Assembly by the provisions of the Constitution, as ascertained in a session of the National Assembly summoned for the purpose.

<text>Hungry Jack&#x27;s Pty Ltd. is an Australian fast food franchise of the Burger King Corporation. It is a wholly owned subsidiary of Competitive Foods Australia (with licensing from Restaurant Brands International), a privately held company owned by Jack Cowin. Hungry Jack&#x27;s owns and operates or sub-licenses all of the Burger King/Hungry Jack&#x27;s restaurants in Australia.

As the master franchise for Australia, the company is responsible for licensing new operators, opening its own stores and performing standards oversight of franchised locations in Australia. With over 400 locations across Australia, Hungry Jack&#x27;s is the second-largest franchise of Burger King in the world (second to Carrols Corporation, which is now owned by Restaurant Brands International).

==Corporate profile==

===Early history===
When Burger King moved to expand its operations into Australia, it found that its business name was already trademarked by a takeaway food shop in Adelaide, South Australia. As a result, Burger King provided the Australian franchisee, Jack Cowin, with a list of possible alternative names derived from pre-existing trademarks already registered by Burger King and its then corporate parent Pillsbury that could be used to name the Australian restaurants.

Cowin selected the &quot;Hungry Jack&quot; brand name, one of Pillsbury&#x27;s U.S. pancake mixture products, and slightly changed the name to a possessive form by adding an apostrophe and &quot;s&quot; to form the new name &quot;Hungry Jack&#x27;s&quot;. The first Australian franchise of Burger King Corporation was established in Innaloo, Perth, on 18 April 1971, under the auspices of Cowin&#x27;s new company Hungry Jack&#x27;s Pty Ltd.

By the end of its first decade of operation in the 1970s, Hungry Jack&#x27;s had expanded to 26 stores in three states. In October 1981, the company opened its first New South Wales store in the Sydney central business district on the corner of Liverpool and George Street. In 1986, the chain entered Victoria by purchasing 11 stores from the ailing Wendy&#x27;s Hamburgers chain, later converting them to Hungry Jack&#x27;s.

=== 1996 to 2001: legal battle with Burger King ===


In 1991, Hungry Jack&#x27;s Pty Ltd. renewed its franchise agreement with Burger King Corporation which allowed the Hungry Jack&#x27;s to licence third party franchisee. However, one of the conditions of the agreement was that Hungry Jack&#x27;s had to open a certain number of stores every year for the term of the contract. In 1996, shortly after the Australian trademark on the Burger King name lapsed, Burger King Corporation made a claim that Hungry Jack&#x27;s had violated the conditions of the renewed franchise agreement by failing to expand the chain at the rate defined in the contract and sought to terminate the agreement.

Under the aegis of this claim, Burger King Corporation in partnership with Shell Australia, began to open its own stores in 1997 beginning in Sydney and throughout the Australian regions of New South Wales, Australian Capital Territory, Victoria and Tasmania. In addition, Burger King sought to limit HJ&#x27;s ability to open new locations in the country, whether they were corporate locations or third-party licensees.

As a result of Burger King&#x27;s actions, Hungry Jack&#x27;s owner Jack Cowin and his company Competitive Foods Australia, began legal proceedings in 2001 against the Burger King Corporation, claiming Burger King Corporation had violated the conditions of the master franchising agreement and was in breach of the contract. The Supreme Court of New South Wales agreed with Cowin and determined that Burger King had violated the terms of the contract and awarded Hungry Jack&#x27;s A$46.9 million (US$41.6 million in 2001).

In its decision, the Court said that Burger King sought to engineer a default of the franchise agreement so that the company could limit the number of new Hungry Jack&#x27;s branded restaurants and ultimately claim the Australian market as its own, which was a purpose that was extraneous to the agreement. The case introduced the American legal concept of good faith negotiations into the Australian legal system, which until the time of the verdict had been rarely used in the Australian court systems.
=== 2002 to present===
After Burger King Corporation lost the case, it decided to terminate its operations in the country and in July 2002 the company transferred its assets to its New Zealand franchise group, Trans-Pacific Foods (TPF). The terms of the sale had TPF assume oversight of the Burger King franchises in the region as the Burger King brand&#x27;s master franchisee. Trans-Pacific Foods administered the chain&#x27;s 81 locations until September 2003 when the new management team of Burger King Corporation reached an agreement with Hungry Jack&#x27;s Pty Ltd. to rebrand the existing Burger King locations to Hungry Jack&#x27;s and make Hungry Jack&#x27;s Pty the sole master franchisee of both brands.

An additional part of the agreement required Burger King Corporation to provide administrative and advertising support as to ensure a common marketing scheme for the company and its products. Trans-Pacific Foods transferred its control of the Burger King franchises to Hungry Jack&#x27;s Pty Ltd., which subsequently renamed the remaining Burger King locations as &quot;Hungry Jack&#x27;s,&quot; joining the other 210 outlets at the time.

In the 2009 to 2010 financial year, Competitive Foods Australia reported an after-tax profit of $32.1 million on sales of $1.043 billion.

As of September 2021, Hungry Jack&#x27;s has 440 stores, with 75% being company owned. The company intends to open more than 20 new stores per year in the future, with an upper aim of 700 stores in total.

==Products==
The only Burger King trademarks that are currently sold at Hungry Jack&#x27;s are the Whopper range of beef burgers and the TenderCrisp range of chicken burgers. Other products sold by Hungry Jack&#x27;s include the Brekky Wrap range and the Grill Masters premium Angus beef burger range, as well as more generic items such as cheeseburgers, chicken nuggets, and chips.

Hungry Jack&#x27;s breakfast menu, introduced in late 2005 in two states, Queensland and Western Australia, as well as the Northern Territory, and the other states the following year, bears little resemblance to Burger King&#x27;s US breakfast menu, and includes items such as English muffins and toasties. In 2021 Hungry Jack&#x27;s released two new breakfast menu items, the Turkish Brekky BLAT and the Turkish Brekky BLAT with egg. A BLAT sandwich is popular in Australia; the acronym stands for Bacon, Lettuce, Avocado and Tomato.

Due to the increase in popularity of plant-based meat alternatives being consumed across Australia, Hungry Jack&#x27;s introduced the &quot;Rebel Whopper&quot; in partnership with V2food in late 2019, which is a variation of the Whopper containing a meat-free patty made with protein extracted from legumes. A large promotional campaign was run, including partnering with online creator Natalie Tran. The restaurant also serves a vegan Whopper burger and English muffins, which contain a vegetable patty.

In November 2018, the full menu of Hungry Jack&#x27;s was available for home delivery via Menulog.

In April 2022, Hungry Jack&#x27;s launched its Jack&#x27;s Café coffee chain brand as a pilot scheme in its 65 restaurant in Western Australia as a response to McDonald&#x27;s McCafé offering. The pilot scheme was perceived as being successful and the coffee brand was rolled out to all Hungry Jack restaurants in Australia in June of the same year. Grinders Coffee, the coffee blend used by Hungry Jack&#x27;s later received Gold Medal in the Large Chain Store Espresso Category of the 2023 Golden Bean Australasia awards.

===Big Jack===

In mid-2020, the chain introduced the &quot;Big Jack&quot; burger, which is essentially a slightly altered version of the Big King, and similar to McDonald&#x27;s Big Mac burger. The close similarities in the name, appearance and the marketing of the burger led to McDonald&#x27;s suing Hungry Jack&#x27;s in the Federal Court of Australia in August 2020 over trademark infringement, and they sought to cancel Hungry Jack&#x27;s Big Jack trademark which was filed the previous year. They also accused the company of deliberately copying the ingredients and appearance of the Big Mac in bad faith.

In its defence, Hungry Jack&#x27;s argued that the burger&#x27;s name is simply a play on the company&#x27;s name and that of its founder Jack Cowin, and that a burger&#x27;s appearance and composition cannot be protected by a trademark, noting that their product features &quot;common characteristics of hamburgers&quot; sold everywhere. However the company also admitted there was an “element of cheekiness” in the name, and that it was positioned as a direct competitor to the Big Mac. In November 2023, the Federal Court ruled against McDonald&#x27;s, finding that &quot;Big Jack is not deceptively similar to Big Mac&quot;, and that the company had not established that Hungry Jack&#x27;s trademarks had infringed on McDonald&#x27;s existing trademarks. Hungry Jack&#x27;s had also ran an advertising campaign that made light of the lawsuit during the early stages of the trial which also made the claim that the Big Jack patty was 25% larger than the Big Mac&#x27;s as a point of differentiation; the Court found this claim misleading but it did not affect the final verdict. 

Hungry Jack&#x27;s eventually released a number of variants of the burger to the range, including a larger version — the Mega Jack, the Outlaw Big Jack (which added bacon and barbeque sauce), and the Chicken Big Jack. The burger and all its variants were removed from the menu in late 2021, though it returned as a limited time item in May 2024 after the suit was resolved.

==Marketing==
===Logo===
The Hungry Jack&#x27;s logo is still based on the 1994 Burger King logo, despite subsequent revisions to the logo used by Burger King in other markets. The logo was redesigned in 2000, with the design based on the 1999 Burger King logo, but the logo was never used.

===Sponsorship===
Hungry Jack&#x27;s currently sponsors the West Coast Eagles and Adelaide Football Club in the Australian Football League (AFL).

Hungry Jack&#x27;s are also the naming rights sponsor for the National Basketball League.

<text>Trade unions in India are registered and file annual returns under the Trade Union Act (1926). Statistics on trade unions are collected annually by the Labour Bureau of the Ministry of Labour, Government of India. According to the latest data released for 2012, there were 16,154 trade unions with a combined membership of 9.18 million, based on returns from 15 states out of a total of 28 states and 9 union territories. The trade union movement in India is largely divided along political lines and follows a pre-Independence pattern of overlapping interactions between political parties and unions. The net result of this system is debated, as it has both advantages and disadvantages. According to data submitted by various trade unions to the Ministry of Labour and Employment as part of a survey, INTUC, with a combined membership of 33.3 million, emerged as the largest trade union in India as of 2013.

Firm or industry-level trade unions are often affiliated with larger federations. The largest federations in the country, which represent labour at the national level, are known as central trade union organisations (CTUOs). As of 2002, when the last trade union verification was carried out, there were 12 CTUOs recognised by the Ministry of Labour.

==History==

The establishment of textile and clothing mills around the port cities of Bombay (now Mumbai), Calcutta (now Kolkata), Madras (now Chennai), and Surat in the latter half of the 19th century marked the beginnings of the industrial workforce in India. Several incidents of strikes and protests by workers were recorded during this period. The credit for the first association of Indian workers is generally attributed to the Bombay Mill-Hands Association, founded by N.M. Lokhande in 1890. This was shortly after the passing of the &#x27;First&#x27; Factories Act in 1881 by the British government. The subsequent years saw the formation of several labour associations and unions. The first registered trade union is considered to be the Madras Labour Union, founded by B.P. Wadia in 1918, while the first trade union federation established was the All India Trade Union Congress in 1920.

Following the rapid growth of unions around the time of the First World War, the Russian Revolution, and the establishment of the ILO, industrial conflict began to rise, with over 1,000 strikes recorded between 1920 and 1924. The situation intensified with the arrest of prominent leaders and trade unionists in the infamous &#x27;Cawnpore Conspiracy Case&#x27; of 1924, where union leaders were accused of attempting a Communist revolution to overthrow the ruling British government. Subsequently, the Trade Union Act (1926) was enacted, creating rules for the regulation and closer monitoring of trade unions. In the first year of the law&#x27;s implementation, 28 unions registered and submitted returns, with a total membership of 100,619. The number of unions grew rapidly thereafter, and by the time of India’s independence in 1947, there were 2,766 registered unions with a combined membership of over 1.66 million. This broad influence of unions and workers&#x27; organisations led to the enactment of significantly favourable social legislation in the first decade of Independence, including several important labour laws.

===Independence (1947) to liberalisation (1991)===

Following the country’s independence in 1947 and the formation of the republic in 1950, India largely adopted a socialist economic approach, promoting public sector employment and pro-worker legislation. The trade union movement reflected the major political divisions of the time, being primarily divided along socialist and communist lines. The subsequent decades saw significant growth in trade union membership, with the number of active unions peaking in the mid-1970s and mid-1980s. While the 1970s were marked by political instability, the 1980s saw a shift towards more market-friendly policies, increased support for industrialists, and implicit opposition to workers. Two key events during this period were the 1974 railway strike and the Great Bombay textile strike of 1982, the latter of which led to a prolonged and complex stalemate.

===Liberalisation (1991) to present===

The period following economic liberalisation in 1991 was characterised by reduced government intervention in the economy, a decline in public sector employment, and increased encouragement for the private sector. Efforts to unionise in the private sector were often met with opposition, and the general withdrawal of state support for workers further undermined their bargaining power. These policies resulted in stagnation in the number of unionised formal sector workers.

A gradual shift in focus towards the importance of the Informal sector and &#x27;informal employment in the formal sector&#x27; from the late 1990s onwards led trade unions to also focus on these workers. This shift resulted in greater enrolment of informal sector workers and an increase in union membership. The central trade union organisations (CTUOs) raised their combined membership from 13.21 million in 1989 to 24.85 million in 2002. Nearly all CTUOs now have at least 20 percent of their official members from the informal sector.

==Central trade union organisations (CTUOs) of India==

Local, firm-level, or industry-level trade unions are often affiliated with larger federations. The largest federations in the country represent labour at the national level and are known as central trade union organisations (CTUs or CTUOs). To acquire status as a CTUO, a trade union federation must have a verified membership of at least 500,000 workers spread across a minimum of four states and four industries (including agriculture). Trade union membership verification is usually conducted once a decade, and an updated verification with new criteria is currently underway, with 2011 as the reference year. Complications around membership verification have arisen due to discrepancies between the membership claimed by unions and the actual number of members. These issues have increased in recent years with the wider inclusion of informal sector workers in union membership data.

The International Labour Organization has listed 12 organisations that are officially recognised as CTUOs under the terms set by the Ministry of Labour.

<text>Regius Professorship of History is one of the senior chairs in history at the University of Cambridge. It was founded in 1724 by George I as the Regius Professorship of Modern History.

== History ==
The Regius Professorship was originally intended by George I to teach contemporary European history, to correct &quot;the prejudice that has accrued to the ... University from this Defect, Persons of Foreign Nations being often employed in the Education and Tuition of Youth&quot;. Two modern language instructors were required to be paid for out of the Professor&#x27;s salary, which was set at £400 per year, at the time nearly equal to the stipends of all other Cambridge professors put together. The University, in accepting the benefaction, agreed that the professorship would ensure &quot;our Nobility and Gentry will be under no Temptation of sending for persons from foreign Countries to be entrusted with the education of their children.&quot; However, the practice of appointing language instructors died out by 1724, Regius Professors instead retaining the whole stipend for themselves, and in 1861 this requirement was formally dropped.

The professorship&#x27;s field of &quot;modern history&quot; was intended to encompass all post-classical history, beginning from the fall of Rome. However, for the first few decades of the professorship&#x27;s existence, only ancient history was studied in the University, and so the Regius Professorship of Modern History was little more than a sinecure. However, by the time an independent History undergraduate examination was established in the 19th century, the professorship had more duties to fulfil.

Under the original understanding of &quot;modern history&quot;, the Regius Professorship was several times held by academics specialising in the Middle Ages. However, by the 21st century, the meaning of &quot;modern history&quot; had shifted to refer either to the history of the modern period following the middle ages, or of the late modern period following the early modern period. In 2010, the Queen in Council approved the removal of the word &quot;modern&quot; from the title to reflect this change in usage, on the recommendation of the Faculty of History and the University.

== Appointment ==
The appointment is by Royal Warrant on the recommendation of the Prime Minister of the day. Traditionally the Patronage Secretary at Number 10 Downing Street &#x27;took soundings&#x27; in Cambridge and put two names before the Prime Minister, of which one was forwarded to the monarch. In 2008, however, Prime Minister Gordon Brown devolved the appointment of all the Regius Professorships onto appointments committees at their respective universities; the Vice-Chancellor is now required to forward the name of the successful candidate, who must have accepted the offer of the post, to the Cabinet Office, which then initiates the recommendation by the Prime Minister and the issuing of the Royal Warrant.

<text>Universiti Sains Malaysia ( &#x27;University of Science Malaysia&#x27;; abbreviated as USM) is a public research university in Malaysia. Founded on 1 June 1969 as a statutory body with its own constitution, it is the oldest institute of higher learning in Northern Malaysia, as well as the second oldest in the country. It has six campuses: a main campus on the island of Penang, a health campus in Kelantan, an engineering campus in Nibong Tebal, an Advanced Medical and Dental Institute in Kepala Batas, Seberang Perai, a postgraduate studies campus in Kuala Lumpur and an offshore International Medical Programme Campus in Belgaum, India in collaboration with KLE University.

USM is the only Accelerated Programs for Excellence (APEX) government-funded autonomous university in Malaysia. Like most of other universities in Malaysia, USM also used English as its medium of instruction.

==History==

===Early concept and establishment===

The idea of a university in Penang was first mooted by D. S. Ramanathan in 1959 in the State Assembly and later crystallised when he was nominated chairman of the Penang University Project committee. The acquisition of a piece of land in Sungai Ara was then followed by the ceremonial laying of the foundation stone by Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman on 7 August 1967.

In June 1968, the Federal Government commissioned a committee led by Mohamed Suffian to draft a Constitution for the new university. The committee then issued a report recommended that the university be autonomous and separate from the government and supported academic freedom in relation to the society and the Government.

USM was established as a statutory body and the second university in Malaysia in 1969. It was first known as the University of Penang (). The university operated on borrowed premises at the Malayan Teachers&#x27; Training College at Gelugor, with only 57 science-based students in the beginning. At that time, there were only three schools of Biological Sciences, Chemical Sciences and Physics and Mathematics. A year later, three non-science schools of Cultural Studies and Humanities, Educational Studies and Social Sciences were established.

===Campus relocation and expansion===

In 1971, it moved to its present 239-hectare site at Minden (formerly Minden Barracks of the British Far East Command) in Gelugor, 10 kilometres from the city of Georgetown. In 1972, two new schools of Pharmaceutical Sciences (first of its kind in Malaysia) and the Building Sciences and Architecture (a year later renamed School of Housing, Building and Planning) were established. The same year, USM&#x27;s publication arm – Penerbit USM was established under its Department of Library. In 1973, the School of Applied Sciences was established (later renamed School of Engineering Sciences and Industrial Technology on 7 August 1984), followed by School of Mathematical Sciences in May 1974 (split from School of Physics and later renamed School of Mathematics and Computer Sciences in 1985) and School of Medical Sciences in 1979.

===New branch campuses===

In 1983, a health campus was opened in Kubang Kerian, Kelantan, housing a training hospital in the beginning for fourth year medical students. The School of Medical Sciences moved there in stages, and became fully operational there in June 1990. Two more schools of Dental and Health Sciences were established on 1 December 1998 and 1 November 1999 respectively.

Realising the need for degree recognition by factories in the engineering field especially those in Penang and Kuala Lumpur, an Engineering Campus was established in 1986, first by occupying rental buildings in Ipoh, Perak. At the same time, the School of Engineering Sciences and Industrial Technology was split into the School of Industry Technology which remain at the main campus and the School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering and the School of Materials and Mineral Resources Engineering which were relocated to the Engineering Campus, then also known as Perak Branch Campus (). Two more schools were established there in 1989 – The schools of Civil Engineering and Mechanical Engineering. December that same year, the Engineering Campus moved to its permanent site in Teronoh, 30 kilometres away from the state&#x27;s capital and was officially opened by Sultan Azlan Shah on 13 September 1990.

The School of Chemical Engineering was established on 1 May 1992, and the School of Aerospace Engineering was established on 1 March 1999 through upgrading the campus&#x27; Aerospace Engineering Unit. In 1997, the Ministry of Education decided to transfer the engineering campus back to Penang to help fulfill the state&#x27;s growing human resources needs in its Electrical and Electronics Sector. Thus, a new location in Seri Ampangan, Nibong Tebal was identified for the campus and it began operations there in June 2001, while its former site was taken over by Universiti Teknologi Petronas, a private university owned by Malaysian oil and gas multinational corporation Petronas.

Meanwhile, in the main campus, the School of Management was established on 1 December 1989, while the Institute of Postgraduate Studies (IPS) was established in 1991 to meet the needs of rising number of candidates in higher degree programmes. The School of Communication was established in 1993, and on 1 March 1995, the School of Computer Sciences was split from the School of Mathematical Sciences as a separate School. Towards the end of the 20th century, the School of Distance Education and the School of the Arts were established in 1998 and 1999 respectively. On 15 March 1998, USM became the second university in Malaysia to be corporatised after University of Malaya. USAINS Holding Sdn Bhd, USM&#x27;s corporate arm was later established on 21 October 1999 to leverage the available skills for income-generating business development, replacing its Innovation and Consultancy Centre.

USM&#x27;s first off-campus site Centre for Marine and Coastal Studies (CEMACS) was established in August 1991 at Teluk Aling in Penang National Park for research and post-graduate training in the Marine Science and Coastal Ecosystems fields.

===APEX Status and International Collaboration===

On 16 February 2002, The Advanced Medical and Dental Institute (, AMDI or IPPT) was established in Bertam, Kepala Batas, Seberang Perai, Penang as institute for advanced research and postgraduate programmes in the medical fields.

In June 2008, the Science and Arts Innovation Space (also known as sains@USM) was launched in Bukit Jambul to strengthen innovation and retain the best talents in the science and arts fields, while attracting international collaborators to boost the country&#x27;s knowledge economy. It was constructed on 12.4ha plot of land located few kilometres away from the main campus that was bought from IJM Corporation in March that year for RM59 million.

On 3 September 2008, the Ministry of Higher Education under Mohamed Khaled Nordin selected USM to implement the Accelerated Programme for Excellence (APEX), a fast-track development programme created to enable institutions of higher education to be recognised as world-class entities. School of Languages, Literacies and Translation was established on 19 November 2008 by upgrading the Language Unit of the School of Education, while the Graduate School of Business was established in 2009. In 2010, an international offshore medical campus in collaboration with KLE University was established in the college&#x27;s compound in Belgaum, India.

On 1 November 2013, Sains@KL (known as USM@KL since 16 November 2022) was established in Kuala Lumpur as an institute to offer high impact academic postgraduate programmes. On 9 October 2023, USM@KL moved from its original location in Wisma Sejarah, Jalan Tun Razak, to a new office at MoF Inc Tower, Platinum Park.

== Coat of arms ==

The coat of arms of USM was first introduced in June 1972 and modernised in 2009. Its initial draft was designed by York Heralds of Arms in London, before being perfected by an artist and Penang Free School (PFS) teacher, Mr. G.S. Reutens.

The arms of the university is displayed on a native shield, and contains much local symbolism, but generally conform to traditional English heraldic principles and may be blazoned as follows.

Shield: &quot;Purpure in chief in front of two krises in saltire an open book and in base a Bunga Raya or hibiscus flower all proper.&quot;

Crest: &quot;On a wreath of the Colours a crescent therefrom issuant a fourteen-pointed federal star Or.&quot;

Supporters: &quot;Two tigers rampant, each holding a palm frond in their forepaw.&quot;

Motto: &quot;&quot;Kami Memimpin&quot; (Malay: &quot;We Lead&quot;&quot;)

Since 25 January 2003, the USM coat of arms has been accompanied by the university&#x27;s logotype designed by Anthony Tan Chee Kian, featuring the initials U, S and M attached to one another and the university&#x27;s name in full written in capital letters –&#x27;UNIVERSITI SAINS MALAYSIA&#x27; as seen on its corporate logo.

USM is currently one of the three public universities in Malaysia to adopt its coat of arms, the other two are the University of Malaya (UM) and The National University of Malaysia (UKM).

}
&lt;/mapframe&gt;The Main campus has the name of a German city (Minden) because the campus was built on the territory of the former British Minden Barracks, which themselves were named after the Battle of Minden.

Besides the main campus in Minden, USM has one at Kubang Kerian in Kelantan known as Health Campus, and another at Seri Ampangan, Nibong Tebal in mainland Penang known as Engineering Campus.

Started as a USM hospital in 1982, the Health campus has expanded after the School of Medical Science was moved from the main campus to the present site which is 73 hectares. The School of Medical Science was moved from the main campus in June 1984. There are two other schools on the health campus — the School of Dental Science and the School of Allied Health Sciences.

The Engineering Campus was originally located at Tronoh, Perak, and named Perak Branch Campus (KCP). After operating in the state for 15 years (1986–2001), the Engineering Campus moved to the present site in Nibong Tebal, Penang.

Other campuses of USM include:
* Advanced Medical and Dental Institute (AMDI) in Bertam, Kepala Batas, Seberang Perai
* IPS Sains@USM in Kuala Lumpur
* USM-KLE International Campus in Belgaum, Karnataka, India in collaboration with Karnatak Lingayat Education Society

<text>Yuanjia&#x27;ao (袁家嶴) is a village in Fenghua municipality, Zhejiang province, China. Situated at approx. 280m above sea level in the Tiantai Mountain range, its main products are bamboo and timber. The village is traditionally considered the ancestral home of the Yuans of the greater Ningbo, who have been estimated to number some 20,000.

The village itself is split in two by the Tangqi River, a small stream which can flood in the autumn months. Yuanjia&#x27;ao is famous in Fenghua because it is a thoroughfare to Malongkeng, a religious site near the peak of Mount Dalei. There is a narrow concrete road to Yuanjia&#x27;ao from Xiaowangmiao in the north, which follows the Tangqi River all the way to Xujiashan in the south. On the 18th day of the sixth lunar month, when the religious festival to honour the dragon king of Malongkeng is held, the road becomes heavily congested.

Of the 400 families of Yuanjia&#x27;ao, over 90% are surnamed Yuan. According to the &quot;&quot; of 1923, all the Yuans of the village are descended from a certain Yuan Rong (袁蓉), who moved from Xinchang county and settled at the site in the tenth century. The village also has wider significance as the ancestral home of the Yuan clans of Ningbo and its hinterlands. Efforts have been made in recent years to revive and restore the clan monuments and religious buildings which were destroyed during the Cultural Revolution. In 1997, a clan hall was reopened, and the Duling Temple and its connected memorial arch was erected. Since 2001, clan members have been studying the last remaining copy of the clan genealogy held by the Fenghua government and liaising with members of the Cilin Yuan clan to republish the genealogy.

<text>The OCA–DLR Asteroid Survey (ODAS) was an astronomical survey to search for small Solar System bodies focusing on near-Earth objects in the late 1990s. This European scientific project was a collaboration between the French Observatoire de la Côte d&#x27;Azur (OCA) and the German Aerospace Center (DLR). The survey is credited for the discovery of one comet and more than 1000 minor planets during 1996–1999.

== Description ==

ODAS operated in cooperation with a global effort regarding near-Earth objects that was begun by the &quot;Working Group on Near-Earth Objects&quot;, a component of the International Astronomical Union. The project began October 1996 and ceased observations in April 1999 for a refurbishing. However the telescope has not been reopened since that time. Survey observations were made during the 15 days each month when moon light was at a minimum, during the first and last quarters of the lunar month. The operation used a 90 cm Schmidt telescope of the OCA at Calern, near the city of Nice in southeastern France. A combination of a CCD camera and a software package were used for automated detection of moving objects.

Throughout its tenure, the project observed a total of 10,523 objects, made a total of 44,433 positional measurements, and was responsible for the discovery of more than a thousand asteroids according to the new rules issued by the MPC in October 2010. (The rules redefines who discovered a particular object. Previously, ODAS accounted for a total of 1020 asteroid discoveries). Among the discoveries are also 5 near-Earth asteroids and 8 Mars-crossers &quot;(without considering said rule)&quot;. ODAS also &quot;recovered&quot; several objects that were previously lost and discovered the comet 198P/ODAS The discovered NEO&#x27;s were 189011 Ogmios, (recovery), 16912 Rhiannon, 1998 SJ2, and 1998 VD31.

== List of discovered minor planets ==
ODAS is credited by the Minor Planet Center (MPC) with the discovery of more than a thousand numbered minior planets during 1996–1999. The published list on ODAS project website may significantly differ from the MPC, as newly numbered bodies have been added, while other bodies are not (anymore) credited to ODAS. For example, the discovery of the two listed asteroids on the ODAS website, and , are now officially credited to Spacewatch and CSS, respectively.

<text>Grannygate is the name given to several different sporting scandals, typically regarding eligibility of players for national teams. A rugby union version of Grannygate occurred in Wales in March 2000, a rugby league version occurred in New Zealand in 2006.

==Rugby union==
In rugby union, Grannygate was a scandal over the eligibility of international players which occurred in March 2000. The rules of World Rugby, which was known in 2000 as the International Rugby Board (IRB), allow a player to qualify to play for a country based on his parents&#x27; or grandparents&#x27; country of birth. Alternatively a player can qualify based on residency in a country for a defined number of years.

The players involved in Grannygate were:
* Shane Howarth, former New Zealand international who gained 19 caps for Wales before being banned as he had no Welsh qualification.
* Brett Sinkinson, New Zealand born flanker (though he never played for New Zealand) who played for Wales whilst ineligible. He was barred from playing for Wales but later returned to the Wales team after qualifying through the residency rules and achieved a total of 20 caps.
* Dave Hilton, born in Bristol (though he never played for England) claimed Scottish qualification through his grandfather. He played 41 times for Scotland before it was revealed his grandfather was born in England and he was therefore ineligible to play for Scotland. He played one more international for Scotland after qualifying through residency.

Three other Welsh players were initially implicated but exonerated as they had valid Welsh qualifications and had not played for other countries: Australian Jason Jones-Hughes, New Zealander Matt Cardey and English-born Peter Rogers who had played club rugby in South Africa and Wales. A fourth player, Colin Charvis, had been first capped for Wales in 1996 while apparently ineligible, but by the time the scandal broke he had completed the required 3-year residency period and no further action was taken.

==Rugby league==

The term Grannygate was used of Nathan Fien who played rugby league for New Zealand in the 2006 Rugby League Tri-Nations, despite not being qualified to do so. Fien had played State of Origin for the Queensland Maroons in 2001 but was seeking permission to play for the Kiwis in the second game of the 2006 Tri-Nations. Fien claimed eligibility based on the grandparent rule. Fien played in the losing Kiwi team in Melbourne and in the winning Kiwi team against Great Britain in New Zealand. He was later banned after &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; in Sydney revealed that Fien was claiming eligibility based upon a great-grandmother and not a grandmother. A further consequence was that the Kiwis were forced to forfeit the two competitions points gained for the victory against the Lions which further hampered the Kiwis&#x27; efforts to make the final. Fien became eligible to play for the Kiwis in 2007 due to residency rules via his tenure with the Auckland Warriors in the NRL.

The effect of the incident on international rugby league was a public slanging match between the Australian Rugby League (ARL) and the New Zealand Rugby League (NZRL). Selwyn Bennett, the chairman of the NZRL, resigned over the incident and two weeks later Andrew Chalmers announced that he would also leave his job with a year still to run on his contract. Graham Lowe, a former Kiwi coach, tabled a failed bid to have the whole NZRL replaced. Bennett has since claimed that the incident was good for international rugby league, accusing ARL chief executive, Geoff Carr, of knowing about Fien&#x27;s ineligibility before it was revealed publicly. Bennett said: &quot;Not only Geoff Carr but the secretary at the ARL Colin Love looked into it. The only one who didn&#x27;t know anything seemed to be me.&quot;

<text>Malongkeng (马龙坑; also Malukeng 马陆坑, 马鹿坑) is a religious site located south of Yuanjia&#x27;ao, China, dedicated to the Zhouji Dragon King. The site is revered by villagers of the surrounding hills and the greater Fenghua area for its spring waters. 

Donations are periodically made to Xianling Temple (显灵庙), which guards the site. According to tradition, the Dragon King went to the aid of imperial troops in the Ming Dynasty and was honoured by the Jiajing Emperor by edict. From that time onwards pilgrims from around Fenghua have made their way to Malongkeng to ask favours of the Dragon King. 

A colorful folk religious festival is held annually at Malongkeng on the 18th day of the sixth lunar month, which is said to be the birthday of the Zhouji Dragon King. At that time tens of thousands of people make the trip to Malongkeng and roads up the mountain become extremely congested. 

In July 2004, the Fenghua municipal government banned the festival, citing danger from fire in the surrounding forest. Authorities described the festival as &quot;superstition&quot; and said measures taken against it would promote civilisation and social stability. In late July traffic to 
Malongkeng was not allowed to proceed and the Xianling Temple was temporarily closed down.</text><links>

<doc id="761096" wikidata="Q74784" url="?curid=761096" title="ESO 3.6 m Telescope">
<text>The ESO 3.6 m Telescope is an optical reflecting telescope run by the European Southern Observatory at La Silla Observatory, Chile since 1977, with a clear aperture of about and area.

The telescopes uses the HARPS instrument and has discovered more than 130 exoplanets. In 2012, it discovered Alpha Centauri Bb, a now-disproven possible planet in the Alpha Centauri system only 4.4 light-years away.

ESO collaborated with CERN on building the telescope. It saw first light in 1976 and entered full operations in 1977. When completed it was one of the world&#x27;s largest optical telescopes. It received an overhaul in 1999 and a new secondary in 2004. The ESO 3.6-metre Telescope has supported many scientific achievements and presented ADONIS, one of the first adaptive optics system available to the astronomical community in the 1980s.

== Instruments ==

Since 22, the ESO 3.6 m telescope has hosted HARPS, the High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher and NIRPS, the Near Infra Red Planet Searcher. HARPS is a fibre-fed high resolution echelle spectrograph dedicated to the discovery of extrasolar planets. Other instruments on the telescope, now decommissioned, include:
* CES: is a spectrograph that provides a resolving power of up to 235,000 in the 346–1028 nm region.
* EFOSC2: the &quot;ESO Faint Object Spectrograph and Camera (v.2)&quot;, is a very versatile instrument for low resolution spectroscopy and imaging.
* TIMMI-2: the &quot;Thermal Infrared MultiMode Instrument&quot; dedicated to the 3–25 μm spectrum.
* ADONIS: is the acronym for &quot;Adaptive Optics Near Infrared System&quot;, and was a second-generation adaptive optics system for the astronomical community. More than 40 peer-reviewed scientific articles were published based on this instrument data. ADONIS is the final version of diverse Adaptive Optics (AO) prototypes named Come-on and Come-on +. It was offered in its final version in October 1996 as an official ESO instrument, then decommissioned in 2001. ADONIS was the first AO system offered to a large community of astronomers.

== Recent scientific achievements ==
The ESO 3.6 m telescope has made several scientific discoveries since it saw first light. Recent astronomical achievements were made possible by HARPS, a &quot;top-class&quot; instrument. This include finding the lightest exoplanet known at the time of discovery in, Gliese 581e, with only twice the mass of the Earth, and the richest planetary system known at the time, with up to seven planets orbiting a Sun-like star.

The telescope was also involved in solving a decades-old mystery regarding the mass of Cepheid variable stars. By using the HARPS instrument, astronomers detected for the first time a double star where a pulsating Cepheid variable and another star pass in front of one another, which allows to measure the mass of the Cepheid. The study concluded that the mass prediction coming from the theory of stellar pulsation was correct while the value calculated was at odds with the theory of stellar evolution.

The discovery of the extrasolar planet Gliese 581 c by the team of Stéphane Udry at University of Geneva&#x27;s Observatory in Switzerland was announced on April 24, 2007. The team used the telescope&#x27;s HARPS spectrograph, and employed the radial velocity technique to identify the planet&#x27;s influence on the star.

By 2009, the telescope was used to discover 75 exoplanet candidates. In 2011, another 50 exoplanet candidates were announced.

<doc id="761101" wikidata="Q3481366" url="?curid=761101" title="Shane Howarth">
<text>Shane Paul Howarth (born 8 July 1968) is a former international rugby union player who gained four caps and scored 54 points for the All Blacks before later switching allegiance to Wales, attaining 19 Welsh caps.

An outside-half or full-back, he was a prolific goal-kicker and a fast elusive runner. He scored 23 points for Wales including a try in the 32–31 victory over England in 1999 played at Wembley as the Millennium Stadium was under construction in Cardiff.

==Background==
Howarth was born in Auckland, New Zealand. He was educated at St Peter&#x27;s College, Auckland.

==Rugby career==
He played for the Auckland Marist club and Auckland. He made his All Black debut against South Africa in 1994 and played in three tests in the series.

In 1996 he switched to rugby league, signing with the North Queensland Cowboys in the Australian Rugby League competition. He played 12 games for the club and scored 49 points, including three field goals.
 However he was not re-signed by the club and instead returned to rugby union, playing three games for the Auckland Blues during the 1997 Super 12 season.

He moved to England to play for Sale at outside-half. There was then a tug-of-war between various nations for him to play for them, but he chose Wales, after being offered the chance to play for Newport. Howarth moved to Newport RFC in 1999 and played for the club until 2003, scoring 1,035 points and helping the Black &amp; Ambers win the WRU Principality Cup.

== Grannygate scandal==

During the 2000 Six Nations Championship, a number of British newspapers revealed that Howarth (along with fellow player Brett Sinkinson) was ineligible to represent Wales. Howarth had claimed Welsh eligibility through a Welsh-born grandfather. However, following the revelations in March 2000, Howarth was unable to provide the documents to prove his eligibility and was subsequently not considered for selection in that season&#x27;s remaining matches.

Howarth continued to play rugby for Newport RFC and in 2001 announced he intended to qualify for Wales under residency laws (which would have made him eligible again on 14 May 2002). However, by this time the IRB had changed the rules so that players could only represent one country and Howarth was considered a New Zealand player only. During a 2022 interview with Sky Sport New Zealand, Howarth reiterated his belief that he was Welsh qualified, noting that he chose to represent Wales over my lucrative offers: &quot;I can tell you now if I went to England, financially I&#x27;d have been better off. I believed I was Welsh, I still believe I&#x27;m Welsh and I was proud to put the jersey on.&quot;

== Coaching==
Howarth commenced a coaching in Auckland. He was assistant coach of the Pacific Islanders, New Zealand in 2004 and 2005. Howarth was assistant coach for the Auckland NPC team from 2006 until 2010 under Pat Lam. Auckland claimed four championships in 10 years. Howarth&#x27;s tenure was ended after Auckland slumped to seventh in 2010.

In June 2012 he was appointed as backs coach to London Wasps. From September 2013 until late 2014, Howarth was backs coach for the Worcester Warriors.

<text>LiteStep is a Windows Shell replacement for Windows 9x and up, licensed under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL).

LiteStep replaces the Windows Shell which provides access to the graphical user interface on Windows-based computers. Depending on the theme used, it can replace or remove shell elements, such as the start menu and taskbar. It can also be used to create informational-type displays. Aside from the core executable, LiteStep is made up of modules, some of which are included with the initial installation. Other modules, which a theme may require to function properly, are automatically downloaded. The modules and core provide users with the ability to create anything from minimal environments, to elaborate and heavily scripted desktops. Customizations are provided in the form of themes, which may be created or modified with a text editor. A theme for LiteStep is a collection of configurations, scripts, and/or images which are distributed in a file with the zip or lsz extension. The lsz file extension is a renamed zip file, which is associated with the LiteStep Theme Installer.

==History==
LiteStep was inspired by AfterStep, which in turn was inspired by NeXTSTEP. LiteStep was initially developed by Francis Gastellu as a closed-source project until April 1998 (version b23), and was then entirely rewritten (versions 24 and up). LiteStep later inspired DarkStep, which supports scripting, and PureLS. LiteStep also inspired Phil Stopford in 1999 to start LDE(X), which was a complete and production-stable LiteStep-based Windows interface replacement. LiteStep is one of the oldest remaining Windows shell replacements. 
Over time, and due to the rise of popularity in freeform skinning, LiteStep desktop designs have tended to drift away from the AfterStep layouts seen under pre-0.24 versions, and LiteStep theming has become an art form in itself, being referred to as an &quot;OS equivalent of an expandable Leatherman multi-tool&quot;.

==Example==

===Theme.rc===
The following is an example of an OTS2 theme.rc configuration file to be loaded at LiteStep&#x27;s execution. OTS2 is the second generation of the Open Theme Standard, which is to be followed for themes to be compatible with the LiteStep structure. The theme.rc file is the entry point for all LiteStep themes.

===Explanation===
The LiteStep interface is composed of modules, most having the extension .dll. They are loaded by themes through a text configuration file named theme.rc. To load different modules you would write a line like this, to invoke LiteStep&#x27;s NetLoadModule.dll:

NetLoadModule.dll is itself a module that is loaded in a default LiteStep setup. The command *NetLoadModule tells NetLoadModule.dll to load a module for use in the current theme.

LiteStep and its themes rely on variables, with many already hardcoded into the core. Variables are surrounded with $...$. $LiteStepDir$, for example, is the directory that litestep.exe resides in.

Other variables can be manually set by writing a line in any configuration file like this:

You could then use the variable $Firefox$ instead of the full path to the executable.

Module configurations can span over different files for the sake of organization. The command &quot;include,&quot; seen below, tells LiteStep to load the specified file. The variable $ThemeDir$ is the directory of the theme being currently used. Put together with &quot;Config\someconfig.rc&quot; will result in the settings of file someconfig.rc being loaded from \Theme\Config\someconfig.rc.

Modules are what make LiteStep look and behave the way you want it to. There are graphical modules that are used to build GUI elements and non-graphical modules used to create hotkeys, watch window classes for scripted events, and create LiteStep-specific commands called !bang commands. !bang commands are a way to execute event-driven functions within a given theme. These commands can reference files, folders, namespaces, executables, or elements of the theme itself. Many !bang commands are hardcoded into the LiteStep core, and others may be provided through user scripts or through the currently loaded modules. Bangs are the primary way you control the modules. !bangs can be triggered through a hotkey, popup menu, shortcut, or through module-specific events.

Some of the most popular modules include:

*lsxcommand.dll: This module creates a commandline where you can enter bang commands, filepath commands i.e. notepad.exe or C:\, and urls.
*v_bang-lite.dll: This module creates bangs to control Winamp. The bangs can then be used in User Interface elements such as shortcuts, or hotkeys, etc.
*hotkey.dll: This type of module lets you create custom hotkeys, which can be used to execute a hardcoded bang command, or a module specific bang command.
*xlabel.dll: Theme developers use xlabel for creating box-like windows on the desktop. These &quot;boxes&quot; can be used for informational texts (ex: cpu usage, memory usage, uptime, song playing, etc.) or images, or a combination of both. xlabel can also be used to create buttons for running !bang commands, scripts, or opening system programs. Basically, anything you would like to display and interact with can be made using xlabel.

<doc id="761108" wikidata="Q716212" url="?curid=761108" title="Yuan (surname)">
<text>Yuan (, ) is a Chinese surname ranked 37th in China by population in 2019. In Standard Chinese, the surname is transliterated Yuán (hanyu pinyin) or Yüen2&quot; (Wade-Giles). Other romanizations include Yeu (Shanghainese), Ion (Chang-Du Gan), Yuen (Cantonese), Oan (Hokkien/Min Nan), Wang (Teochew), [[Won (surname)|Won]] (Korean), and [[Viên]] (Vietnamese). Pronunciation differs widely from region to region.

According to tradition, the surname originated from a noble family of the ancient state of Chen, in what is now eastern Henan province. The written form of the character took its current standardised form around the 1st century. During the Han dynasty, it was associated with the powerful Yuan clan of Ru&#x27;nan and later during Jin and Southern dynasties, with the Yuan clan of Chen.

Historically, the name has been fast growing amongst Han Chinese, and has also been taken up by various non-Chinese ethnic groups. The surname is now held by more than 6.5 million people worldwide, and makes up 0.54% of the population of mainland China. Although growth has tapered off in the past six centuries, the Yuan name is still relatively widespread throughout China, as well as among overseas Chinese, with heaviest per capita concentrations in the Yangtze Delta region of central coastal China.

Because the Yangtze Delta region has historically exhibited high clan consciousness, there exist a large number of Yuan genealogies, most of which are now held in public institutions. Renewed interest in ancestry outside mainland China has been encouraged by the PRC government.

It is the 59th name on the &quot;Hundred Family Surnames&quot; poem.

== Origin of the surname ==
Traditional sources trace the surname to Yuan Taotu, a 7th-century BC Chen nobleman, who was part of a collateral branch of the family of the marquis ruling that state. He selected the second character in his grandfather&#x27;s style name, Boyuan (伯爰), to be his own family name. Yuan Taotu was granted a feoff in Yangjia (陽夏), in what is now Taikang county, Henan. This estate is regarded as the ancestral home of the earliest Yuan clan. Through its connection with the ruling family of Chen, the Yuan house could also claim ancestry from the great legendary Emperor Shun. Descendants of Yuan house are mentioned by name in the &quot;Zuo Zhuan&quot; as holding high office in the state of Chen until it was extinguished by Chu in 479 BC.

An alternate, much less widely accepted theory, suggests that the surname Yuan is derived from Xuanyuan (軒轅 or 玄袁), the clan name of the Yellow Emperor. After his death, the Yellow Emperor&#x27;s estates came to be called Yuanyi (袁邑), and his descendants took their place of birth as a surname.

Prior to the unification of China in 221 BC, the surname is only known to have been present in the historical domain of Chen. Some members of the Yuan clan are known to have moved to Zheng and other neighbouring states. The process of emigration from the Yangjia heartland continued after unification. An example of this is the case of Yuan Ang, a minister to Emperor Gao of Han. His family was forced by banditry to move to Anling, in the area of modern Xi&#x27;an, some 500 km west of their ancestral homeland.

The surname Yuan could be written in at least five different ways in early Han times, and they were used interchangeably in pre-Han times. By the 1st century, the name had taken a largely standardised form (袁), which remains to the present day. An early dictionary, the &quot;Shuowen&quot;, defines this character as &quot;a long garment&quot;, but this archaic meaning had already fallen into disuse. The Han text &quot;Qian fu lun&quot; (潛夫論: &quot;Comments of a Recluse&quot;) suggests that the character was derived from either 1) the character &quot;ai&quot; (哀), meaning &quot;sorrow, grief&quot;; or 2) a combination of the characters &quot;gong&quot; (公: &quot;lord&quot;) and &quot;gu&quot; (谷: &quot;grain&quot;).

== Early Yuan clans ==
Until the end of the Han dynasty, the heartland of the Yuan house was still in the area of the ancient state of Chen. Around the 1st century, three Yuan clans rose to sufficient national importance to be mentioned in the dynastic histories. All were located in close proximity of each other, on the tributaries of the Huai River. One maintained its estates at Fuyue (扶樂), in Chen (陳); another was based at Ruyang (汝陽) in Ru&#x27;nan (汝南); and a third of lesser importance was associated with Yingchuan (潁川). All three clans produced members of a land-owning gentry which began to participate increasingly in local and national government, although only the first two are known of in any detail.

=== The Ru&#x27;nan Yuan ===
The most well-known group were undoubtedly the Yuan clan of Runan. According to local genealogies, the Ru&#x27;nan Yuan estates were in the vicinity of the modern township of Yuanlao (袁老), bordering the Fen River (汾水) in the south. There are still some 20,000 Yuan in the area and around a third of the population of Yuanlao there still bears the name Yuan.

The Yuan clan of Ru&#x27;nan became known among the gentry for its learning in the &quot;I Ching&quot;, which was passed on between generations. The scholar Yuan Liang (袁良), the earliest Ru&#x27;nan Yuan known by name, was an aide to the heir apparent, the future Emperor Ming of Han. His grandson Yuan An (袁安) made the family&#x27;s fortunes, rising rapidly through the bureaucracy from 70 AD onwards, reaching the post of Minister over the Masses and playing an important role in policy decisions at the Han court until his death in 92.

One of his sons took the highest military post and two of his grandsons both reached the rank of &quot;Three Excellencies&quot;. They did not, however, play any significant role in the executive, and usually appeared instead as power brokers during critical events, such as the coup d&#x27;etat against Liang Ji in 159. The reputation and power of the Ru&#x27;nan Yuan was maintained with a network of clients and associates, and through intermarriage with other powerful lineages. In addition, during the reigns of Emperors Huan and Ling, clansman Yuan She was an eunuch supporting Yuan Wei and Yuan Feng. At the time of Emperor Ling of Han&#x27;s death in 189, the clan was undisputed as the most influential in the empire. Most of its leading members lived at the capital Luoyang and some of its sons, such as Yuan Shao (袁紹), were born there.

Yuan Shao and his half-brother Yuan Shu (袁術) played leading roles in the massacre of the eunuchs in September 189 and in the succeeding years both became regional warlords. Yuan Shu declared himself emperor in 197, basing his claim to the throne on descent from Emperor Shun, and died shortly afterwards. Yuan Shao dominated much of north China until he was decisively defeated by Cao Cao at the Battle of Guandu in 200. Following his death in 202, the cohesion of Ru&#x27;nan Yuan and its followers as a national power collapsed.

=== The Yuan of Chen ===
The other Yuan clan of importance were based in the county of Fuyue, Chen Commandery (part of what is now Taikang county). Like the Ru&#x27;nan Yuan, they produced generations of high officials. One of the first whose background can be verified is Yuan Huan (袁渙), who served Cao Cao and later his son Cao Pi in the civil bureaucracy. Yuan Huan does not seem to have been connected to the Ru&#x27;nan Yuan and his career was not affected by their downfall. Of his three sons who lived to adulthood, all were granted official positions under the Nine-rank system.

The Chen Yuan were among the northern aristocratic clans that retreated south as north China was overrun by the Xiongnu. According to the great 10th century genealogist Liu Fang: &quot;Across the Yangzi River, the elite clans were known as &#x27;émigré clans&#x27;; the Wang (王), Xie (謝), Yuan, and Xiao (萧) were the greatest among them.&quot; When Sima Rui established the Eastern Jin at Jiankang in 317, he did so with the support of powerful members of these great families. The Chen Yuan brought with them dependants and armed retainers, and they were eventually able to carve out large estates for themselves in the peripheral frontier districts. One branch of the clan settled in Yichun, in east-central China. Eventually it grew to such size that the prefecture was renamed Yuanzhou (袁州) in the early 7th century.

During the Eastern Jin and the Southern dynasties period, the Chen Yuan established extensive marriage alliances with the other major clans, especially the Xie, whose ancestral lands were in the same county. The clan also provided consorts for the imperial family, including the empresses of Emperor Wen of Southern Song and Emperor Wu of Qi. The Chen Yuan had strong traditions of scholarly accomplishment rather than military leadership. It produced a number of notable scholars such as the historian Yuan Hong (袁宏) and the poet Yuan Shansong (袁山松). Among the four great émigré clans, the Yuan were notable for never making a bid for military power.

A branch of the Chen Yuan moved north around 420 and settled in Luoyang, later serving the Northern Wei. Upon the conquest of the Chen dynasty by Sui in 589, members of the southern ruling elite, such as Yuan Xian (袁憲), were moved to the capital Chang&#x27;an where they continued to serve in government. A number of Tang dynasty noblemen trace their ancestry directly to the Chen Yuan.

== Spread of the surname ==
In general, the spread of the Yuan surname has followed the migration of Han Chinese throughout mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Southeast Asia. The general trend over the past 1500 years has been a shift from north to south and southeast.

The main branches of the Yuan clan after the Han dynasty were all in north China, most of them in population centres near the Yellow River. In the 3rd century members of the Chen Yuan are known to have moved as far south as the Red River delta in modern Vietnam. Early migrations south established Yuan clans along the lower Yangtze River, in Danyang, Lujiang, Wuxi, Yangzhou and Nanjing. Records from the Tang dynasty name three major Yuan clans, in Ru&#x27;nan, Pengcheng and Yichun.

Larger scale migrations south occurred during the middle and late Song dynasty, when north China was overrun by the Jurchens and later the Mongols. Yuan clans appeared in what is now Zhejiang (Hangzhou, Ningbo, Fenghua and Yinxian), Jiangxi (Nanchang) and Fujian (Fu&#x27;an). The name was already widespread in the 12th century, being concentrated in what is now Sichuan, Zhejiang and Shanxi.

Around the beginning of the Ming dynasty in the late 14th century, population booms in the lower Yangtze River valley made Jiangxi, Jiangsu and Zhejiang the three most populous provinces for the Yuan name. The southern coastal provinces of Fujian and Guangdong also experienced significant increases.

By the Qing dynasty, Yuan had penetrated to the frontier lands of Yunnan in the southwest, Guangxi in the south, Liaoning in the northeast and Taiwan in the southeast. Many in Guangdong and Fujian migrated south to Southeast Asia, especially Singapore and Indonesia.

Up until the 15th century, growth in the Yuan name consistently outstripped that of the general population, but this rate has fallen below average over the past six centuries. This period has seen a resurgence of the Yuan name in northern provinces, so much so that Sichuan and Hebei are now the most important in terms of absolute population. The Yuan name is most populous as a percentage of local populations in the Yangtze Delta region, in northwestern Jiangxi and in the border region between Shaanxi and Sichuan. In 1994, for example, there were 97,400 Yuan in Shanghai, ranked 30th by population – slightly higher than the national average. Yuanjia&#x27;ao in Fenghua District, Zhejiang, takes part of its name from the Yuan family. In northeast China, Heilongjiang is home to concentrations in the southeast of the province as well as a lengthy strip along the Russian border. Generally speaking, the name is relatively absent in the farthest geographical extremes of China, namely southern Yunnan, Guangxi, and the island province of Hainan.

In Taiwan, the surname is ranked 94th by population. Most who hold the name were relatively recent emigres who arrived during the 19th century or at the end of the Chinese Civil War in 1949. They are concentrated in Taipei, Hsinchu, Nantou, Chiayi and Tainan.

=== Adoption by non-Han peoples ===
During the 2nd century, the Yuan surname was taken by one of the three tribal groupings of the Bandun Man, who inhabited what is now Chongqing and Sichuan. This group later migrated north to the Wei River valley, and gradually were absorbed by Han Chinese.

After Emperor Xiaowen of the nomadic Xianbei moved his capital to Luoyang in 494, his clan of Tuoba changed their surname to Yuan (元) to assimilate with the Chinese population. In later centuries, this surname declined and was sometimes subsumed by the more common form of Yuan (袁).

The character of &quot;yuan&quot; (袁) has also been associated with the Gaoju people of Central Asia, who claimed descent from the Xuanyuan clan of the Huang Di. One of their nine clans was called Yuanhe (袁紇) or Yuanwei (袁韋), and one of their twelve major surnames was Qiyuan (乞袁). In 605, the Yuanhe defeated the Göktürks and won leadership over a tribal confederation which came to be called the Huihe (回紇). There have been suggestions that the name of Genghis Khan&#x27;s tribe, Kiyad (called &quot;Qiyan&quot; 乞顏 or &quot;Qiyin&quot; 乞引 in Chinese), was a corruption of &quot;Qiyuan&quot;. Those among the Mongols who retained the Qiyuan surname may have simplified it to &quot;Yuan&quot; after settling in China.

During the early 17th century, during the Qing (Manchu) dynasty, the surname is also known to have been adopted by members of the Eight Banners, including by a number of Manchu bannermen in Shenyang. Today, the surname appears among the Manchu, Mongols, Yao, Yi, Bai, Koreans and Tibetans. There are major Yuan clans among the Yao in Long&#x27;an county, Guangxi and in Funing, Yunnan.

The Yuan surname is a relatively minor one in Korea, where it is called Won (원). According to a 2000 census, there were 1,104 individuals bearing the name in South Korea. They trace their ancestry to Won Roebo (袁賚輔) of Bian (安比縣). During the 20th century, the Won clan were centered in the north-central area of South Korea, in the province of Gangwon-do.

== Genealogies ==
Almost all available information on the early origins of the surname come from noble genealogies which were updated and maintained until the 10th century. Some of the aristocratic Yuan families of the Tang dynasty used these registers as a means of upholding their prestige and maintaining influence. These texts were also used as sources for the 5th century story collection &quot;Shishuo xinyu&quot; (世說新語: &quot;New Tales of the World&quot;). A Yuan clan genealogy from Jiangxi is mentioned in &quot;Sui shu&quot; (隋书: &quot;Book of Sui&quot;) and a Yuan clan temple inscription survives in the anthology of essayist and poet Han Yu. Although no copies of early genealogies are extant today, fragments have been preserved by famed Chinese historian Ouyang Xiu in the 11th century work &quot;Xin Tang Shu&quot;.
From the time of Ouyang Xiu onwards, the practice of genealogy compilation devolved down to gentry families and became correspondingly more widespread. The clans of the Yangtze Delta and its hinterlands were most active in producing genealogies. Many of the Yuan clan genealogies associate their clans with the Ru&#x27;nan Yuan or the Chen Yuan, and in particular trace their ancestries to Yuan An. Yuan Zhijun (袁志君), founder of the Yuan clan of Dongguan and ancestor of the Ming dynasty general Yuan Chonghuan (袁崇煥), for example, claimed to be a 38th generation descendant of Yuan An. A number of collateral branches in Xingning, Meixian and Huiyang also follow the Tongguan clan in the claim. Similarly, the clans of Xinchang, Fenghua and Yinxian, which produced many &quot;jinshi&quot; degree holders in the Song dynasty, claimed that their ancestor Yuan Yuan (袁元) was a 31st generation descendant of Yuan An. It was not uncommon for clans to build memorial halls, sometimes titled &quot;Ru&#x27;nan&quot;, &quot;Woxue&quot; (卧雪: &quot;Sleeping in [time of] snow&quot;) or &quot;Shouzheng&quot; (守正: &quot;upholding justice&quot;), in honour of Yuan An. Such attempts to trace the origin of clans to a famous individual have interest as a sociological phenomenon rather than for its historical accuracy.

Clan-based activities and genealogies were attacked during the Cultural Revolution, when various movements inspired by the Chinese government attempted to eradicate symbols of the old society. They were relatively successful, so much so that many genealogies have been lost. Most surviving Yuan genealogies on the mainland are now out of private hands.

Some one hundred Yuan clan genealogies are known to be held in government archives or in public libraries in Beijing, Shanghai and Ningbo. A provincial breakdown of the geographic distribution of these genealogies in order of number: Zhejiang (23); Jiangsu (22); Hunan (17); Jiangxi (9); Shandong (9); Sichuan (5); Henan (4); Anhui (3); unknown (7). A few genealogies may also be held in university archives in Japan and the United States. No doubt many more fragments are scattered in villages and townships across China.

== Clan organisation ==
From around the Song dynasty, clans began organising themselves in mutual obligation relationships, often based around the compilation of genealogies. The role of clan elders was often that of moral or Confucian instruction. The &quot;Yuan shi shi fan&quot; (袁氏世范: &quot;Yuan clan hereditary rules&quot;), by the Song dynasty &quot;jinshi&quot; Yuan Cai (袁采), was an early manual of ethical behaviour and was regarded by contemporaries as a classic of clan instruction. Toward the late imperial period, these relationships strengthened to the extent that clans sometimes provided social welfare and enforced customary law. Regionally prominent clans often allied together based on a common (and sometimes spurious) ancestor, known as the &quot;first ancestor who moved&quot; (始遷祖).

Renewed interest since the late 1980s by overseas Chinese in root-seeking has been largely encouraged by the government of mainland China as a way of attracting foreign direct investment. In 2001, for example, the Hong Kong Association of Yuen Clansmen (香港袁氏宗親會) donated HKD $1.2 million toward the construction of a Yuan Chonghuan Memorial Park on the site of his Ming dynasty home. In 2004, a group of 68 Yuan clan businessmen from Shenzhen and Hong Kong were invited to Ru&#x27;nan county, so-called &quot;ancestral home of all Yuan under Heaven&quot;. The group, led by Yuen Mo, a representative of Hong Kong to the National People&#x27;s Congress, held talks with provincial and local officials with regard to the development of food processing projects in the area.

In recent years, genealogy compilation and clan organisation has seen a resurgence, together with a renewed interest in local history. The 13th &quot;Conference of the Descendants of Shun,&quot; held in Ru&#x27;nan in 1999, was attended by representatives of Yuan clans from as far afield as Hong Kong and Thailand. A number of local clans are also reorganising themselves and publishing updated versions of their genealogies. In May 2005, after updating their 1939 genealogy, the Yuan clan of Ximen, Ningbo, held a large scale ancestor worship ceremony which was much publicised in the local media. This return to clan consciousness has been limited, however, by increased geographic and social mobility in China.

Starting in the 1980s, astronomers began to use the facility to measure stars over long periods of time, which led to hunts for extrasolar planets.

The largest telescope east of Texas in the United States is the 61-inch reflector &quot;(see Hobby-Eberly Telescope)&quot;. However, most of its projects were discontinued in 2005. Harvard University&#x27;s Optical SETI program continues at the site.

It also housed an steerable radio telescope once used in Project BETA, a search for extraterrestrial intelligence. A 41-cm (16-inch) Boller and Chivens Cassegrain reflector originally housed at Oak Ridge is available for public use at the National Air and Space Museum&#x27;s Public Observatory Project on the National Mall in Washington, DC.

The inner main-belt asteroid 4733 ORO, discovered at Oak Ridge in 1982, was named in honor of the observatory.

<text>Olivier van Noort (1558 – 22 February 1627) was a Dutch merchant captain and the first Dutchman to circumnavigate the world.

Olivier van Noort was born in 1558 in Utrecht. He left Rotterdam on 2 July 1598 with four ships to find an alternative trade route to China and the Spice Islands during the Dutch Eighty Years&#x27; War with Spain and Portugal. His ships were poorly equipped, especially in the way of armament, and the crews were unruly.

Van Noort sailed through the Strait of Magellan, and captured a number of Spanish and Portuguese ships along the Pacific coast of South America. While in the strait his men killed around forty indigenous Selknam, in what was the bloodiest recorded event in the strait until then.

He lost two ships on the way due to a storm, including his largest ship, the &quot;Hendrick Frederick&quot;, which was wrecked on Ternate in the Maluku Islands. In November and December 1600, he established a berth for his two remaining ships, &quot;Mauritius&quot; and &quot;Eendracht&quot;, in the surroundings of Corregidor Island at Manila Bay in the Philippines. From there he engaged in attacks on Spanish ships, targeting the sailing route to and from Manila. This situation was ended after the naval combat of Fortune Island on December 14, 1600. The Spanish lost their flagship, the galleon &quot;San Diego&quot; (its wreck would be found in 1992 and yield a treasure in porcelain and gold pieces) but the Spanish captured the Dutch &quot;Eendracht&quot;, making van Noort&#x27;s position untenable and forcing him to retire from the Philippines.

Van Noort returned to Rotterdam via what would become the Dutch East Indies and the Cape of Good Hope, on 26 August 1601 with his last ship, the &quot;Mauritius&quot;, and 45 of the original 248 crew. The venture barely broke even, but was the inspiration for more such expeditions. The united Dutch East India Company was formed a few months later.

Van Noort&#x27;s voyage is also told by Hans Koning in the book &quot;The Golden Keys&quot; (Doubleday 1956, 1970), a fictionalized retelling of the voyage for children.

<doc id="761115" wikidata="Q387691" url="?curid=761115" title="Estádio das Antas">
<text>The Estádio das Antas (; officially Estádio do Futebol Clube do Porto ) was the third (and longest occupied) stadium of the Portuguese football side FC Porto. It was in use from 1952 to 2004, replacing the earlier Campo da Constituição, 1.6km (1 mile) to the west, and later replaced by the Estádio do Dragão, a block southeast away. As well as the stadium, it had an indoor arena and three training grounds. The club&#x27;s offices were also split between the inside of the stadium and the &quot;Torre das Antas&quot;, built in front of the stadium during the 1990s. It was demolished in 2004, although one floodlight still remains, and the majority of the site is not yet redeveloped.

==Layout==
The stadium was split into six different areas. The &quot;Poente&quot; and &quot;Maratona&quot; contained the best seats, while the most financially accessible were located in the &quot;Superior Norte&quot;, &quot;Superior Sul&quot; and &quot;Arquibancada&quot;. Between the &quot;Norte&quot; and &quot;Poente&quot; were seats for the away supporters. Each stand was split into different sectors. While the &quot;Poente&quot; had four, both &quot;Maratona&quot; and &quot;Arquibancada&quot; had five, and both &quot;Superiores&quot; (upper tiers) had nine, but two in &quot;Norte&quot; were reserved for away supporters. For matches, low turnout from away fans, in contrast to that expected from Porto supporters, so the away fan sector was often reduced in size by half. In the past there were other divisions, such as splitting the &quot;Superior&quot; stands between the original and the new terraces built after the 1986 capacity increase.

==Portugal national football team==
The national team first played in the stadium in 1952 and held its last game there in 2003.

==Milestones==

*28 May 1952 – Inaugurated in the presence of Portuguese President General Craveiro Lopes.
*1 September 1962 – Floodlights.
*1973 – All-purpose arena completed.
*30 April 1976 – Construction of &quot;Maratona&quot; stand, on the opposite of the main stand, and start of the &quot;Arquibancada&quot;.
*16 December 1986 – capacity increased to 95,000 (&quot;rebaixamento&quot;). (Athletics track removed)
*Summer 1997 – All-seater (capacity reduced to 48,297 seats).
*24 January 2004 – Final game. Although the successor Estádio do Dragão had opened in November 2003, the replanting of the turf resulted in some games returning to Estádio das Antas.
*March 2004 – Demolition began.

<text>Jim Gettys (born 15 October 1953) is an American computer programmer.

== Activity ==
Gettys worked at DEC&#x27;s Cambridge Research Laboratory.

He is one of the original developers of the X Window System at MIT and worked on it again with X.Org, where he served on the board of directors.

Until January 2009, he was the Vice President of Software at the One Laptop per Child project, working on the software for the OLPC XO-1.

From 2009 through 2014, he worked at Alcatel-Lucent Bell Labs.

Gettys was the co-founder of the group investigating bufferbloat and the effect it has on the performance of the Internet. He was a core member of the group from 2010 to 2017, concluding with his publication of &quot;The Blind Man and the Elephant&quot;, calling for the wide adoption of fair queuing and active queue management techniques across the Internet, particularly RFC8290.

He served on the GNOME foundation board of directors.

He worked at the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and was the editor of the HTTP/1.1 specification in the Internet Engineering Task Force through draft standard.

Gettys helped establish the handhelds.org community, from which the development of Linux on handheld devices can be traced.

One of his main goals at OLPC was to review and overhaul much of standard Linux software, in order to make it run faster and consume less memory and power. In this context, he has pointed out a common fallacy among programmers today: that storing computed values in memory is preferable to recomputing those values later. This, he claims, is often false on current hardware, given fast CPUs and the long time it takes to recover from a potential cache miss.

He holds a BSc degree from MIT in &quot;Earth and Planetary Sciences&quot; (course 12 — EAPS).

== Awards ==
He won the 1997 &quot;Internet Plumber of the Year&quot; award on behalf of the group who worked on HTTP/1.1.

Gettys is one of the keepers of the Flame (USENIX&#x27;s 1999 Lifetime Achievement Award) on behalf of The X Window System Community at Large.

<doc id="761119" wikidata="Q45732" url="?curid=761119" title="MAGIC (telescope)">
<text>MAGIC (Major Atmospheric Gamma Imaging Cherenkov Telescopes, later renamed to MAGIC [[Florian Goebel]] Telescopes) is a system of two Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes situated at the Roque de los Muchachos Observatory on La Palma, one of the Canary Islands, at about 2200 m above sea level. MAGIC detects particle showers released by gamma rays, using the Cherenkov radiation, i.e., faint
light radiated by the charged particles in the showers. With a diameter of 17 meters for the reflecting surface, it was the largest in the world before the construction of H.E.S.S. II.

The first telescope was built in 2004 and operated for five years in standalone mode. A second MAGIC telescope (MAGIC-II), at a distance of 85 m from the first one, started taking data in July 2009. Together they integrate the MAGIC telescope stereoscopic system.

MAGIC is sensitive to cosmic gamma rays with photon energies between 50 GeV (later lowered to 25 GeV) and 30 TeV due to its large mirror; other ground-based gamma-ray telescopes typically observe gamma energies above 200–300 GeV. Gamma-ray astronomy also utilizes satellite-based detectors, which can detect gamma-rays in the energy range from keV up to several GeV.

==Aims==
The goals of the telescope are to detect and study primarily photons coming from:
*Accretion of black holes in active galactic nuclei
*Supernova remnants, due to their interest as sources of cosmic rays.
*Other galactic sources such as pulsar wind nebulae or X-ray binaries.
*Unidentified EGRET or Fermi sources
*Gamma ray bursts
*Annihilation of dark matter

==Observations==
MAGIC has found pulsed gamma-rays at energies higher than 25 GeV coming from the Crab Pulsar. The presence of such high energies indicates that the gamma-ray source is far out in the pulsar&#x27;s magnetosphere, in contradiction with many models.

In 2006 MAGIC detected very high energy cosmic rays from the quasar 3C 279, which is 5 billion light years from Earth. This doubles the previous record distance from which very high energy cosmic rays have been detected. The signal indicated that the universe is more transparent than previously thought based on data from optical and infrared telescopes.

MAGIC did not observe cosmic rays resulting from dark matter decays in the dwarf galaxy Draco. This strengthens the known constraints on dark matter models.

A much more controversial observation is an energy dependence in the speed of light of cosmic rays coming from a short burst of the blazar Markarian 501 on July 9, 2005. Photons with energies between 1.2 and 10 TeV arrived 4 minutes after those in a band between 0.25 and 0.6 TeV. The average delay was 30 ±12 ms per GeV of energy of the photon. If the relation between the space velocity of a photon and its energy is linear, then this translates into the fractional difference in the speed of light being equal to minus the photon&#x27;s energy divided by 2×1017 GeV. The researchers have suggested that the delay could be explained by the presence of quantum foam, the irregular structure of which might slow down photons by minuscule amounts only detectable at cosmic distances such as in the case of the blazar.

==Technical specifications==
Each telescope has the following specifications:
*A collecting area 236 m2 consisting of 956 50 cm × 50 cm aluminium individual reflectors
*A lightweight carbon fibre frame
*A detector consisting of 396 separate hexagonal photomultiplier detectors in the center (diameter: 2.54 cm) surrounded by 180 larger photomultiplier detectors (diameter: 3.81 cm).
*Data are transferred in analogue form by fibre optic cables
*Signal digitization is done via an ADC (analog-to-digital converter) with a 2 GHz sampling rate
*Total weight of 40,000 kg
*Reaction time to move to any position of the sky less than 22 seconds

Each mirror of the reflector is a sandwich of an aluminum honeycomb, 5 mm plate of AlMgSi alloy, covered with a thin layer of quartz to protect the mirror surface from aging. The mirrors have spherical shape with a curvature corresponding to the position of the plate in the paraboloid reflector. The reflectivity of the mirrors is around 90%. The focal spot has a size of roughly half a pixel size (&lt;0.05°).

Directing the telescope to different elevation angles causes the reflector to deviate from its ideal shape due to the gravity. To counteract this deformation, the telescope is equipped with an Active Mirror Control system. Four mirrors are mounted on each panel, which is equipped with actuators that can adjust its orientation in the frame.

The signal from the detector is transmitted over 162 m of optical fibers. The signal is digitized and stored in a 32 kB ring buffer. The readout of the ring buffer results in a dead time of 20 μs, which corresponds to about 2% dead time at the design trigger rate of 1 kHz. The readout is controlled by an FPGA (Xilinx) chip on a PCI (MicroEnable) card. The data is saved to a RAID0 disk system at a rate up to 20 MB/s, which results in up to 800 GB raw data per night.

<text>Hsp90 (heat shock protein 90) is a chaperone protein that assists other proteins to fold properly, stabilizes proteins against heat stress, and aids in protein degradation. It also stabilizes a number of proteins required for tumor growth, which is why Hsp90 inhibitors are investigated as anti-cancer drugs.

Heat shock proteins, as a class, are among the most highly expressed cellular proteins across all species. As their name implies, heat shock proteins protect cells when stressed by elevated temperatures. They account for 1–2% of total protein in unstressed cells. However, when cells are heated, the fraction of heat shock proteins increases to 4–6% of cellular proteins.

Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is one of the most common of the heat-related proteins. The &quot;90&quot; comes from the fact that it has a mass of roughly 90 kilodaltons. A 90 kDa protein is considered fairly large for a non-fibrous protein. Hsp90 is found in bacteria and all branches of eukarya, but it is apparently absent in archaea. Whereas cytoplasmic Hsp90 is essential for viability under all conditions in eukaryotes, the bacterial homologue HtpG is dispensable under non-heat stress conditions.

This protein was first isolated by extracting proteins from cells stressed by heating, dehydrating or by other means, all of which caused the cell&#x27;s proteins to begin to denature. However it was later discovered that Hsp90 also has essential functions in unstressed cells.

==Isoforms==
Hsp90 is highly conserved and expressed in a variety of different organisms from bacteria to mammals – including the prokaryotic analogue HtpG (high-temperature protein G) with 40% sequence identity and 55% similarity to the human protein. Yeast Hsp90 is 60% identical to human Hsp90α.

In mammalian cells, there are two or more genes encoding cytosolic Hsp90 homologues, with the human Hsp90α showing 85% sequence identity to Hsp90β. The α- and the β-forms are thought to be the result of a gene duplication event that occurred millions of years ago.

The five functional human genes encoding Hsp90 protein isoforms are listed below:

There are 12 human pseudogenes (non-functional genes) that encode additional Hsp90 isoforms that are not expressed as proteins.

A membrane-associated variant of cytosolic Hsp90, lacking an ATP-binding site, has recently been identified and was named Hsp90N. This HSP90α-Δ-N transcript is a chimera, with the first 105 bp of the coding sequence derived from the CD47 gene on chromosome 3q13.2, and the remaining coding sequence derived from HSP90AA1. However, gene-encoding Hsp90N was later proven to be non-existent in human genome. It is possibly a cloning artifact or a product of chromosomal rearrangement occurring in a single cell line.

==Structure==

===Common features===
The overall structure of Hsp90 is similar to that of other proteins in that it contains all of the common secondary structural elements (i.e., alpha helixes, beta pleated sheets, and random coils). Being a cytoplasmic protein requires that the protein be globular in structure, that is largely non-polar on the inside and polar on the outside, so as to be solubilized by water. Hsp90 contains nine helices and eight anti-parallel beta pleated sheets, which combine to form several alpha/beta sandwiches. The 310 helices make up approximately 11% of the protein&#x27;s amino acid residues, which is much higher than the average 4% in other proteins.

===Domain structure===
Hsp90 consists of four structural domains:
* a highly conserved N-terminal domain (NTD) of ~25 kDa
* a &quot;charged linker&quot; region, that connects the N-terminus with the middle domain
* a middle domain (MD) of ~40 kDa
* a C-terminal domain (CTD) of ~12 kDa.

Crystal structures are available for the N-terminal domain of yeast and human Hsp90, for complexes of the N-terminus with inhibitors and nucleotides, and for the middle domain of yeast Hsp90. Recently structures for full length Hsp90 from &quot;E. coli&quot; (, ), yeast (, ), and the dog endoplasmic reticulum (, ) were elucidated.

Hsp90 forms homodimers where the contact sites are localized within the C-terminus in the open conformation of the dimer. The N-termini also come in contact in the closed conformation of the dimer.

====N-terminal domain====

The N-terminal domain shows homology not only among members of the Hsp90 chaperone family but also to members of the ATPase/kinase GHKL (Gyrase, Hsp90, Histidine Kinase, MutL) superfamily.

A common binding pocket for ATP and the inhibitor geldanamycin is situated in the N-terminal domain. Amino acids that are directly involved in the interaction with ATP are Leu34, Asn37, Asp79, Asn92, Lys98, Gly121, and Phe124. In addition, Mg2+ and several water molecules form bridging electrostatic and hydrogen bonding interactions, respectively, between Hsp90 and ATP. In addition, Glu33 is required for ATP hydrolysis.

====Middle domain====
The middle domain is divided into three regions:
*a 3-layer α-β-α sandwich
*a 3-turn α-helix and irregular loops
*a 6-turn α-helix.
The MD is also involved in client protein binding. For example, proteins known to interact this the Hsp90 MD include PKB/Akt1, eNOS, Aha1, Hch1. Furthermore, substrate binding (e.g., by Aha1 and Hch1) to the MD is also known to increase the ATPase activity of Hsp90.

====C-terminal domain====
The C-terminal domain possesses an alternative ATP-binding site, which becomes accessible when the N-terminal Bergerat pocket is occupied.

At the very C-terminal end of the protein is the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motif recognition site, the conserved MEEVD pentapeptide, that is responsible for the interaction with co-factors such as the immunophilins FKBP51 and FKBP52, the stress induced phosphoprotein 1 (Sti1/Hop), cyclophilin-40, PP5, Tom70, and many more.

==Mechanism==
The Hsp90 protein contains three functional domains, the ATP-binding, protein-binding, and dimerizing domain, each of which playing a crucial role in the function of the protein.

===ATP binding===

The region of the protein near the N-terminus has a high-affinity ATP-binding site. The ATP binds to a sizable cleft in the side of protein, which is 15 Å (1.5 nanometres) deep. This cleft has a high affinity for ATP, and when given a suitable protein substrate, Hsp90 cleaves the ATP into ADP and Pi. Direct inhibitors of ATP binding or allosteric inhibitors of either ATP binding or ATPase activity can block Hsp90 function. Another interesting feature of the ATP-binding region of Hsp90 is that it has a “lid” that is open during the ADP-bound state and closed in the ATP-bound state. In the open conformation, the lid has no intraprotein interaction, and when closed comes into contact with several residues. The contribution of this lid to the activity of Hsp90 has been probed with site-directed mutagenesis. The Ala107Asp mutant stabilizing the closed conformation of the protein through the formation of additional hydrogen bonds substantially increases ATPase activity while leaving the AMP+PnP conformation unchanged.

The ATPase-binding region of Hsp90 is currently under intense study, because it is the principal binding site of drugs targeting this protein. Antitumor drugs targeting this section of Hsp90 include the antibiotics geldanamycin, herbimycin, radicicol, deguelin, derrubone, macbecin, and beta-lactams.

===Protein binding===

The protein-binding region of Hsp90 is located toward the C-terminus of the amino sequence. The Hsp90 protein can adopt two major conformational states. The first is an open ATP-bound state and the second is a closed ADP-bound state. Thus, ATP hydrolysis drives what is commonly referred to as a “pincer-type” conformational change in the protein binding site.

Hsp90, while in the open conformation, leaves some hydrophobic residues exposed, to which unfolded and misfolded proteins that have unusual hydrophobic regions exposed are recruited with high affinity. When a bound substrate is in place, the energy-releasing ATP hydrolysis by the ATPase function near the N-terminal domain forces conformational changes that clamp the Hsp90 down onto the substrate. In a reaction similar to that of other molecular clamp proteins like GyrB and MutL, this site drives virtually all of the protein folding functions that Hsp90 plays a role in. In contrast, MutL and GyrB function as topoisomerases and use a charge clamp with a high amount of positively charged sidechains that is electrostatically attracted to the negative backbone of DNA.

The ability of Hsp90 to clamp onto proteins allows it to perform several functions including assisting folding, preventing aggregation, and facilitating transport.

==Function==

===Normal cells===
In unstressed cells, Hsp90 plays a number of important roles, which include assisting folding, intracellular transport, maintenance, and degradation of proteins as well as facilitating cell signaling.

====Protein folding and role as chaperone====
Hsp90 is known to associate with the non-native structures of many proteins, which has led to the proposal that Hsp90 is involved in protein folding in general. Furthermore, Hsp90 has been shown to suppress the aggregation of a wide range of &quot;client&quot; or &quot;substrate&quot; proteins and hence acts as a general protective chaperone. However Hsp90 is somewhat more selective than other chaperones.

====Protein degradation====

Eukaryotic proteins that are no longer needed or are misfolded or otherwise damaged are usually marked for destruction by the polyubiquitation pathway. These ubiquitinated proteins are recognized and degraded by the 26S proteasome. Hence the 26S proteasome is an integral part of the cell&#x27;s mechanism to degrade proteins. Furthermore, a constant supply of functional Hsp90 is needed to maintain the tertiary structure of the proteasome. Finally experiments done with heat sensitive Hsp90 mutants and the 26S proteasome suggest that Hsp90 is responsible for most, if not all, of the ATPase activity of the proteasome.

====Interaction with steroid receptors====


The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is the most thoroughly studied example of a steroid receptor whose function is crucially dependent on interactions with Hsp90. In the absence of the steroid hormone cortisol, GR resides in the cytosol complexed with several chaperone proteins including Hsp90 (see figure to the right). These chaperones maintain the GR in a state capable of binding hormone. A second role of Hsp90 is to bind immunophilins (e.g., FKBP52) that attach the GR complex to the dynein protein trafficking pathway, which translocates the activated receptor from the cytoplasm into the nucleus. Once in the nucleus, the GR dimerizes and binds to specific sequences of DNA and thereby upregulates the expression of GR responsive genes. Hsp90 is also required for the proper functioning of several other steroid receptors, including those responsible for the binding of aldosterone, androgen, estrogen, and progesterone.

===Cancerous cells===
Cancerous cells overexpress a number of proteins, including growth factor receptors, such as EGFR, or signal transduction proteins such as PI3K and AKT (Inhibition of these proteins may trigger apoptosis). Hsp90 stabilizes various growth factor receptors and some signaling molecules including PI3K and AKT proteins. Hence inhibition of Hsp90 downregulates the PI3K/AKT pathway leading to downregulation of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-w resulting in apoptosis of cancerous and senescent cells.

Interestingly, the disruption of HSP90 with nano-therapeutics has been implicated in targeting drug-induced resistance and relieves the suppression of Natural Killer (NK) immune cells in breast cancer. Another important role of Hsp90 in cancer is the stabilization of mutant proteins such as v-Src, the fusion oncogene Bcr/Abl, and mutant forms of p53 that appear during cell transformation. It appears that Hsp90 can act as a &quot;protector&quot; of less stable proteins produced by DNA mutations.

Hsp90 is also required for induction of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and nitric oxide synthase (NOS). Both are important for &quot;de novo&quot; angiogenesis that is required for tumour growth beyond the limit of diffusion distance of oxygen in tissues. It also promotes the invasion step of metastasis by assisting the matrix metalloproteinase MMP2. Together with its co-chaperones, Hsp90 modulates tumour cell apoptosis &quot;mediated through effects on AKT, tumor necrosis factor receptors (TNFR) and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) function.&quot;. Also, Hsp90 participates in many key processes in oncogenesis such as self-sufficiency in growth signals, stabilization of mutant proteins, angiogenesis, and metastasis.

==Clinical significance==

Hsp90 plays apparently conflicting roles in the cell, as it is essential for both the creation and the maintenance as well as the destruction of proteins. Its normal function is critical to maintaining the health of cells, whereas its dysregulation may contribute to carcinogenesis. The ability of this chaperone to both stabilize the 26S proteasome (which enables the cell to degrade unwanted and/or harmful proteins) and to stabilize kinases against the same proteasome demonstrates its functional diversity. The uses of Hsp90 inhibitors in cancer treatment highlight Hsp90&#x27;s importance as a therapeutic target.

Targeting Hsp90 with drugs has shown promising effects in clinical trials. For example, the Hsp90 inhibitor geldanamycin has been used as an anti-tumor agent. The drug was originally thought to function as a kinase inhibitor but was subsequently shown to be an Hsp90 inhibitor where it uses a compact conformation to insert itself into the ATP binding site.

HSP90 beta has been identified as one of the autoantigenic biomarkers and targets involved in human ovarian autoimmune disease leading to ovarian failure and thereby infertility.

Prediction and validation of the immunodominant epitope/s of HSP90 beta protein has been demonstrated using sera from infertile women having anti-HSP90 autoantibodies. The decapeptide EP6 (380-389)is a major immunogenic epitope of HSP90 followed by EP1 (1-12) and EP8 (488-498). Knowledge of binding epitopes on the autoantigen is necessary to understand the subsequent pathologic events. Predicted 3D structures of these peptides demonstrated that they exist in the loop conformation, which is the most mobile part of the protein. Also, analysis of the sequences of HSP90 beta across several species reveals that EP6 peptide forms a part of a well-conserved motif. A polyclonal antibody generated to the immunodominant epitope- EP6 confirms similar biochemical and cellular immunoreactivity as seen with the patients&#x27; sera with anti-HSP90 autoantibodies. The study might generate new tools for the detection of disease-inducing epitopes and a possible therapeutic intervention.

==Evolution==

Sequence alignments of Hsp90 have shown the protein to have about 40% sequence identity across all homologs, indicating that it is a highly conserved protein. There are two homologs, found in the cytosol and endoplasmic reticulum respectively. The presence of these two homologs was likely caused by a gene duplication event very early in the evolution of eukaryotes that may have accompanied the evolution of the endoplasmic reticulum or the nucleus. This inference is supported by the fact that the duplication is found in &quot;Giardia lamblia&quot;, one of the earliest branching eukaryotic species. At least 2 other subsequent gene duplications occurred, which explains the different forms of Hsp90 found in fungi and vertebrates. One divergence produced cognate and heat-induced forms of Hsp90 in &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot;, while the second gene duplication event in the cytosolic branch produced the alpha and beta subfamilies of sequences that are found in all vertebrates. In a phylogenetic tree based on Hsp90 sequences, it was found that plants and animals are more closely related to each other than to fungi. Similar to the Hsp90 protein, the gene for Hsp70 protein also underwent duplication at a very early stage in the formation of eukaryotic cells and the homologs in the cytosol and endoplasmic reticulum resulted from this gene duplication event. These gene duplication events are important in terms of the origin of the eukaryotic cell and of the endoplasmic reticulum.

<text>Kenneth McKerrow Logan (born 3 April 1971) is a Scottish retired rugby union player who played wing for Stirling County RFC and Glasgow District at amateur level; Glasgow Warriors, Wasps RFC professional level; and Scotland at international level. He won three English Premierships Heineken Cup with Wasps RFC; and one Scottish Premiership title with Stirling County RFC in 1995, just before the game turned professional. 

== Early life ==
Logan was born on 3 April 1971 in Stirling, Scotland. As a schoolboy, Logan had football trials as a goalkeeper for Dundee United and Hearts. He left school at sixteen and began his rugby career with his hometown club Stirling County, making his senior debut at 17.

==Club career==
Logan played for the amateur provincial side Glasgow District. In 1996 the professional era began and the side became Glasgow Rugby. He played for the newly professional team in the three matches of the 1996–97 Scottish Inter-District Championship as well as 2 matches in that season&#x27;s European Challenge Cup, the European Conference.

As the Full Back named for Warriors first match as a professional team - against Newbridge in the European Challenge Cup - Logan has the distinction of being given Glasgow Warrior No. 15 for the provincial side.

In 1997, Logan joined Wasps for his first season in English rugby. Logan was with Wasps for seven seasons. Whilst at Wasps he helped them win the Anglo-Welsh Cup in 1999 and 2000; he was a replacement in the 1999 final but started and scored a try and a conversion in 2000. He also helped Wasps win the 2002–03 Premiership Final. In 2004, he re-signed for Glasgow before joining London Scottish after a season. He retired from playing in 2005.

== International career ==
Logan played for Scotland A. Logan made his Scotland debut in 1992 against Australia at the age of 20. He was in and out of the side before cementing a position in the starting XV at the 1994 Five Nations Championship. He played in the 2003 World Cup. He won 70 caps over a 11-year period, scoring 20 tries in the process. He retired from international rugby union after the 2003 World Cup.

== Personal life ==
Logan was diagnosed with dyslexia as a child and found solace in playing sports. He attended Wallace High School but left without sitting for his final exams.

Logan dated newsreader Kirsty Young and moved to London, before the couple separated in 1999 after three years. In July 2001, he married television presenter Gabby Yorath. After undergoing IVF treatment, the couple welcomed twins, a son (Reuben), and a daughter, who were born on 28 July 2005.

Logan and his wife took part in the fifth series of the BBC celebrity dancing programme &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot;. Kenny was partnered with Ola and Gabby was partnered with James Jordan. Logan ended in 5th place. Gabby finished in 12th place.

Logan and his wife are past presidents of the children&#x27;s charity Sparks. In 2009, Logan and Sparks joined forces to organise an annual mass-participation event entitled Logan&#x27;s Challenge.

In August 2014, Logan was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to &quot;The Guardian&quot; expressing their hope that Scotland would vote to remain part of the United Kingdom in September&#x27;s referendum on that issue.

Logan supports Rangers F.C.

In 2022, Logan, at his wife&#x27;s suggestion, had a &quot;Well Man&quot; health check that unexpectedly revealed he was in the very early stages of prostate cancer and the medical diagnosis recommendation was to remove his entire prostate to prevent the further spread of cancer. The operation was successful.

He was responsible for X releases at this time. In 1992 he returned to Portland, Oregon to work for Network Computing Devices on X terminals and computer graphics. From 1999 he worked for SuSE from his home in Portland, Oregon on the XFree86 implementation of X. He worked at the Cambridge Research Labs of Compaq (and then Hewlett-Packard) from 2001 until 2005 when the lab closed down. In 2003 he was ejected from XFree86. This led to the formation of the successful X.Org Server fork. He is now project lead on the X.org project, the official reference implementation of the X Window System.

Packard became a Debian Developer in 2004, maintaining font-config (as well as being the upstream maintainer) and other packages. Packard began working for Intel in August 2006. Packard joined Debian&#x27;s Technical committee in November 2013. Packard started working at Hewlett-Packard&#x27;s HP Labs in January 2015. Packard started consulting for Valve in March 2017. Packard left HP Labs to join SiFive in July 2019, working on free software for RISC-V-based processors, among other tasks. Packard joined Amazon in May 2021.

<doc id="761132" wikidata="Q7417406" url="?curid=761132" title="Sandy Point, Newfoundland and Labrador">
<text>Sandy Point or Flat Island (as described by some provincial maps) was formerly a peninsula but is now an island on the west coast of Newfoundland which is gradually being transformed into a hidden island as a result of ocean storm-induced coastal erosion. Its former connecting isthmus is known as &quot;The Gap&quot; by locals after a severe winter storm during the 1960s breached the land bridge and created a gap. The island of Sandy Point was first coined a &quot;hidden island&quot; due to the extreme difficulty in spotting the barrier island on the horizon when approaching inner Bay St. George from the Gulf of St Lawrence by ship. This may have also served beneficial to &quot;pirate&quot; vessels looking to temporarily mask or hide from the regular trade route along the Gulf of St. Laurence River at the time on the lee side of Sandy Point where an anchorage was available, away from the prevailing winds. The fur trade was quite lucrative during this period, so it is somewhat conceivable that inner Bay St. George may have served as a tax or thief &quot;hideaway&quot; from the regular trade routes although this is somewhat speculative.

Sandy Point is now an abandoned former island community of the same name. Due to changing economic, social, and logistical circumstances it became more practical to relocate to the nearby mainland community of St. George&#x27;s or elsewhere nearby. A scheduled railway connection began to supply goods that were previously unavailable to the island community.

The Sandy Point land bar leads or extends from an isthmus or land bridge from Flat Bay West in St. George&#x27;s Bay. This coastal land bridge extends from Flat Bay West towards Stephenville Crossing and is about a total hike to the Sandy Point Lighthouse with about a intertidal barrier. The land bridge was severed in a severe storm on the 2nd of December, 1951, and was disconnected from the mainland until 2020, when a violent storm washed a connection of rocks back into the gap, causing a peninsula to be formed again.

==History==

Sandy Point is thought to have been long inhabited by aboriginals, namely a Dorset culture, and later the Beothuk and Mi&#x27;kmaq nations, and was the hub of the St. George’s Bay fishery. The area was also a major port and supply centre for much of the west coast of Newfoundland.

Sandy Point was divided practically down the middle between Catholics and Anglicans. The westward end, where Catholics lived, was known as &quot;up along&quot;. The Eastern portion, where the Anglicans lived, was &quot;down along&quot;.

In the ensuing decades, Sandy Point became host to a small population of multi-cultural and multi-lingual residents including Mi&#x27;kmaq, English, Jersey, and French residents. Sandy Point also became known for a genetic defect among its population which was termed Allderdice syndrome, also known to locals in the surrounding area as &quot;Sandy Point Syndrome&quot;.

The outport community of Sandy Point continued until a period after Newfoundland entered Confederation in 1949 whereupon the provincial government began a program of voluntary and forced resettlement of coastal communities.

In the case of Sandy Point, the provincial government gave financial enticements for residents to leave the community and move to nearby St. George&#x27;s which was located on the Newfoundland Railway main line and would thus be cheaper to provide services to a concentrated population.

Sandy Point, which had been an important sea port for the western coast of Newfoundland, declined to the point where its last two residents were forced to abandon the community during the 1970s.

Today, the recently created island is completely uninhabited. Various levels of government are undertaking a process to create the territory as an historical site and conservation area for the numerous species of migratory birds which inhabit the island during the summer months; these include piping plovers, with the Sandy Point colony comprising between 15-30% of Newfoundland&#x27;s overall plover population. The island hosts a diverse habitat ranging from tidal sandflats, beaches and sand dunes, saltmarshes, meadows, freshwater ponds, and some forested area, making for a unique landscape in the province. The island also has one of the most northerly and largest occurrences of Spartina salt marshes in eastern North America.

Sandy Point, Newfoundland appears to be somewhat unusual in that it may be the most Northerly Barrier Island in Eastern Canada. (Unconfirmed) The island exhibits some unique flora and fauna not common within Eastern Canada. Likewise, the inner bay of Sandy Point exhibits eelgrass beds which may provide means as nursery grounds for many fish species but also exhibits a deep water outer trench directly behind the island which also may serve of some particular value to other fish species or marine mammals.

<doc id="761136" wikidata="Q83808" url="?curid=761136" title="François Joseph Lefebvre">
<text>François Joseph Lefebvre, Duke of Danzig ( , ; 25 October 1755 – 14 September 1820) was a French military commander of the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars, and one of the original eighteen Marshals of the Empire created by Napoleon.

==Early life==
Lefebvre was born on 28 May 1755 in Rouffach, Alsace, the son of a miller and retired hussar. Orphaned at a young age, he was raised by an uncle who, himself a priest, unsuccessfully tried to lead him to a career in the church. After working as a clerk to the prosecutor of Colmar, Lefebvre enlisted in the French Guards in 1773. As a commoner, Lefebvre had little prospect for advancement; he was promoted to corporal in 1777 and to sergeant in 1788. In 1783 he married Cathérine Hübscher, with whom he had 14 children, although all predeceased him. According to Louise Fusil his last son, a general, died in Vilna on 19 December 1812.

Lefebvre was in Paris at the time of the Storming of the Bastille in 1789 and, like his close friend, Michel Ordener, he embraced the French Revolution. After his unit was disbanded early in the Revolution, Lefebvre entered the newly-formed National Guard of Paris, obtaining the rank of lieutenant, and was injured defending King Louis XVI&#x27;s during a popular uprising. He was soon transferred to a regular infantry regiment.

==French Revolutionary Wars==

Lefebvre held the rank of captain at the start of the War of the First Coalition in 1792. He quickly rose through the ranks, receiving his promotion to brigade general on 2 December 1793. Assigned to the Army of the Moselle, he took part in the Battle of Fleurus on 24 June 1794, and thereafter served on the Rhine front for the next years. After General Lazare Hoche&#x27;s death, in September 1797, Lefebvre was appointed commander of the Army of Sambre and Meuse. He then commanded the vanguard of the Army of the Danube under Jean-Baptiste Jourdan in March 1799, although for the first week of the campaign he was incapacitated with ringworm and Dominique Vandamme replaced him temporarily. He was later injured at the Battle of Ostrach where the Advance Guard bore the brunt of the early fighting.

In May 1799, Lefebvre, by then a well-known general of division, entered politics and was elected to the Council of Five Hundred, even presenting himself as a candidate for a seat in the Directory in replacement of Jean Baptiste Treilhard. He failed to be elected but was appointed Military governor of Paris. In this role, Lefebvre agreed to support Napoleon Bonaparte and was crucial for the success of his coup d&#x27;état of 18 Brumaire. In 1800, his loyalty to Bonaparte was rewarded with a seat in the &quot;Sénat conservateur.

==Napoleonic Wars==

On 19 May 1804, Lefebvre was one of four senators to be made a Marshal of the Empire. He presented the &quot;Joyeuse&quot; to Napoleon in his coronation as emperor on 2 December. For the duration of the War of the Third Coalition, Lefebvre commanded a reserve corps in Mainz as well as three departments on the left bank of the Rhine. He was appointed commander of the Imperial Guard&#x27;s infantry in the campaign of 1806, during the War of the Fourth Coalition. 

On 23 January 1807 he received the order to capture Danzig. At the head of the X Corps, Lefebvre captured the city on 24 May after a two-month siege. Four days later, Napoleon awarded him the victory title &quot;Duke of Danzig&quot; (&quot;Duc de Dantzig&quot;). In 1808, Lefebvre took part in Napoleon&#x27;s campaign in the Peninsular War, defeating the Spanish at the Battle of Zornoza on 31 October 1808. He commanded the Bavarian Army in 1809 during the War of the Fifth Coalition, fighting at the battles of Arnhofen, Eckmühl, and Wagram. That same year, Lefebvre was tasked with suppressing the Tyrolean Rebellion, but was replaced in this command by Drouet d&#x27;Erlon after a series of setbacks.

Lefebvre commanded the infantry of the Old Guard in the 1812 French invasion of Russia, and fought at the Battle of Borodino. He served in the German campaign (1813) and in the French campaign (1814) of the War of the Sixth Coalition, and voted for the emperor&#x27;s deposition at the Senate in April 1814. After the first Bourbon Restoration he was made Peer of France by King Louis XVIII (4 June 1814), but rallied to Napoleon during the Hundred Days.

==Later life==
Lefebvre was excluded from the Chamber of Peers during the second Restoration. However, he retained his rank of marshal. Louis XVIII restored his peerage on 5 March 1819. He died in Paris on 14 September 1820, and was buried near André Masséna at the Père-Lachaise Cemetery.

He never forgot the risks he undertook that brought him rank and wealth. When a friend expressed envy of his estate, Lefebvre said, &quot;Come down in the courtyard, and I&#x27;ll have ten shots at you with a musket at 30 paces. If I miss, the whole estate is yours.&quot; After the friend declined this offer, Lefebvre added, &quot;I had a thousand bullets shot at me from much closer range before I got all this.&quot;

==In popular culture==
Lefebvre is portrayed by Yves Montand in Sacha Guitry&#x27;s 1955 film &quot;Napoléon&quot;.

In the 1931 anthology &quot;If It Had Happened Otherwise&quot;, the alternate history scenario &quot;If the Moors in Spain Had Won&quot; by Philip Guedalla has Napoleon appointing Lefebvre as King Youssef I of Granada after deposing the House of Boabdil, only to trigger an analog of the Peninsular War.

<text>Laphroaig distillery ( ) is a single malt Scotch whisky distillery on Islay, Scotland. It is situated on the south coast of the island, near Port Ellen, at the head of a small bay known as Loch Laphroaig. The Lagavulin and Ardbeg distilleries are close by.

The distillery and brand are owned and operated by Suntory Global Spirits, a subsidiary of Suntory Holdings of Osaka, Japan.

==History==
The Laphroaig distillery was established in 1815 by Donald and Alexander Johnston. The Johnstons who founded Laphroaig were from the Clan Donald and are likely to be from the MacIain of Ardnamurchan branch of the clan. The family anglicised their name to Johnston. The last member of the Johnston family to run the distillery was Ian Hunter, a nephew of Sandy Johnston, who died childless in 1954 and left the distillery to one of his managers, Bessie Williamson.

The distillery was sold to Long John International, a Scottish distiller in the 1960s. In 1973, Long John International and the distillery were acquired by Whitbread. 

In 1989, the distillery was sold by Whitbread to become part of Allied Domecq. The brand was in turn acquired by Fortune Brands in 2005, as one of the brands divested by Pernod Ricard in order to obtain regulatory approval for its takeover of Allied Domecq. Laphroaig has been the only whisky to carry the Royal Warrant of the Prince of Wales, which was awarded in person during a visit to the distillery in 1994. The distillery identifies Charles by his title of Duke of Rothesay, as he is recognised in Scotland. The 15-year-old is reportedly then Prince and now King Charles&#x27; favourite whisky.

Fortune Brands split up its business product lines in 2011, forming its spirits business into Beam Inc. Beam was then purchased by Suntory Holdings in April 2014.

==Taste==

Laphroaig calls itself &quot;the most richly flavoured of all Scotch whiskies&quot;, and is most frequently aged to 10 years, although the 15-year-old variety is common (the 27-, 30- and 40-year-olds are rare and expensive; the 18-year-old was discontinued in late 2015). The whisky has a peaty/smoky flavour. Approximately 10% of their barley is malted on site using hand-cut peat from locations on Islay.

The &quot;Laphroaig Quarter Cask&quot; was introduced in 2004. This expression is aged in ex-bourbon barrels, is finished in smaller casks, and is not chill filtered. Due to the smaller barrels used, the oak surface contact is 30% greater than with standard barrels. The company describes the effect of this as &quot;creating a soft and velvety edge&quot;. The Quarter Cask is bottled at 48% ABV (96 proof). The 10-year-old standard-bearer is bottled at 40% or 43% ABV, depending on the local market.

There are also expressions now selling in Travel Retail: Laphroaig QA cask (matured in ex-bourbon barrels and virgin American oak casks), Laphroaig PX cask (matured in three types of wood – from American oak to Quarter Cask to Pedro Ximenez ex-sherry), Laphroaig An Cuan Mor – Big Ocean (matured in first-fill bourbon barrels and then in European oak).

==Friends of Laphroaig==
In 1994, the Friends of Laphroaig Club was established, members of which are granted a lifetime lease of up to per person of Laphroaig land on the island of Islay. The annual royalty from owning a plot is a dram of Laphroaig which can be obtained upon visiting the distillery. Friends of Laphroaig was revamped in 2020, from lifetime status to an annualized tier-based system starting in 2021, whereby members gained annual access to club benefits commensurate with points earned under the programme&#x27;s new rules.

==Advertising==
In early 2016, Scottish poet Elvis McGonagall began appearing in online ads, reciting his own poetry as he humorously discussed the correct pronunciation of Laphroaig whisky.

In October of 2016, comedian Andy Daly performed a 3.5 hour filibuster by reading customer reviews of Laphroaig Single Malt scotch whisky.

<doc id="761152" wikidata="Q49979" url="?curid=761152" title="Steven Runciman">
<text>Sir James Cochran Stevenson Runciman (7 July 1903 – 1 November 2000), known as Steven Runciman, was an English historian best known for his three-volume &quot;A History of the Crusades&quot; (1951–54). His works had a profound impact on the popular conception of the Crusades.

==Biography==
Born in Northumberland, he was the second son of Walter and Hilda Runciman. His parents were members of the Liberal Party and the first married couple to sit simultaneously in Parliament. His father was created Viscount Runciman of Doxford in 1937. His paternal grandfather, Walter Runciman, 1st Baron Runciman, was a shipping magnate. He was named after his maternal grandfather, James Cochran Stevenson, the MP for South Shields.

===Eton and Cambridge===
Runciman said that he started reading Greek at the age of seven or eight. Later he came to be able to make use of sources in other languages as well: Arabic, Turkish, Persian, Hebrew, Syriac, Armenian and Georgian. A King&#x27;s Scholar at Eton College, he was an exact contemporary and close friend of George Orwell. While there, they both studied French under Aldous Huxley.

In 1921 he entered Trinity College, Cambridge, as a history scholar and studied under J. B. Bury, becoming, as Runciman later said, falsely, &quot;his first, and only, student&quot;. At first the reclusive Bury tried to brush him off; then, when Runciman mentioned that he could read Russian, Bury gave him a stack of Bulgarian articles to edit, and so their relationship began. His work on the Byzantine Empire earned him a fellowship at Trinity in 1927.

===Work as a historian===
After receiving a large inheritance from his grandfather, Runciman resigned his fellowship in 1938 and began travelling widely. Thus, for much of his life he was an independent scholar, living on private means. He went on to be a press attaché at the British Legation in the Bulgarian capital, Sofia, in 1940 and at the British Embassy in Cairo in 1941. From 1942 to 1945 he was Professor of Byzantine Art and History at Istanbul University, in Turkey, where he began the research on the Crusades which would lead to his best known work, the &quot;History of the Crusades&quot; (three volumes appearing in 1951, 1952 and 1954). From 1945 to 1947 he was a representative in Athens of the British Council.

Most of Runciman&#x27;s historical works deal with Byzantium and her medieval neighbours between Sicily and Syria; one exception is &quot;The White Rajahs&quot;, published in 1960, which tells the story of Sarawak, an independent state founded on the northern coast of Borneo in 1841 by James Brooke, and ruled by the Brooke family for more than a century.

Jonathan Riley-Smith, one of the leading historians of the Crusades, denounced Runciman for his perspective on the Crusades. Riley-Smith had been told by Runciman during an on-camera interview that he [Runciman] considered himself &quot;not a historian, but a writer of literature.&quot;

According to Christopher Tyerman, Professor of the History of the Crusades at Hertford College, Oxford, Runciman created a work that &quot;across the Anglophone world continues as a base reference for popular attitudes, evident in print, film, television and on the internet.&quot;

===Interest in occult===
In his personal life, Runciman was an old-fashioned English eccentric, known as an æsthete, raconteur and enthusiast of the occult. According to Andrew Robinson, a history teacher at Eton, &quot;he played piano duets with the last Emperor of China, told tarot cards for King Fuad of Egypt, narrowly missed being blown up by the Germans in the Pera Palace Hotel in Istanbul and twice hit the jackpot on slot machines in Las Vegas&quot;.

A story from his time at Eton of an incident with a then-friend, Eric Blair, who later became famous writing as George Orwell, is told in Gordon Bowker&#x27;s biography of Orwell:
&quot;Drawing from new correspondence with Steven Runciman, one of Orwell&#x27;s friends at Eton (which he attended from 1917 to 1921), Bowker reveals the (perhaps surprising) fascination of Blair with the occult. A senior boy, Phillip Yorke, had attracted the disfavour of both Blair and Runciman so they planned a revenge.
As Runciman recalled, they fashioned an image of Yorke from candle wax and broke off a leg. To their horror, shortly afterwards, Yorke not only broke his leg but in July died of leukaemia. The story of what happened soon spread and, in somewhat garbled form, became legend. Blair and Runciman suddenly found themselves regarded as distinctly odd, and to be treated warily&quot;.

===Homosexuality===
Runciman was homosexual. There is little evidence of a long-term lover, but Runciman boasted of a number of casual sexual encounters, and told a friend in later life: &quot;I have the temperament of a harlot, and so am free of emotional complications.&quot; Nevertheless, Runciman was discreet about his homosexuality, partly perhaps because of religious feelings that homosexuality was &quot;an inarguable offence against God&quot;. Runciman also felt that his sexuality had potentially held back his career. Max Mallowan related a conversation in which Runciman told him &quot;that he felt his life had been a failure because of his gayness&quot;.

===Death===
He died in Radway, Warwickshire, while visiting relatives, aged 97. He never married.

==Assessment==
Edward Peters (2011) says Runciman&#x27;s three-volume narrative history of the Crusades &quot;instantly became the most widely known and respected single-author survey of the subject in English.&quot;

John M. Riddle (2008) says that for the greater part of the twentieth century Runciman was the &quot;greatest historian of the Crusades.&quot; He reports that, &quot;Prior to Runciman, in the early part of the century, historians related the Crusades as an idealistic attempt of Christendom to push Islam back.&quot; Runciman regarded the Crusades &quot;as a barbarian invasion of a superior civilization, not that of the Muslims but of the Byzantines.&quot;

Thomas F. Madden (2005) stresses the impact of Runciman&#x27;s style and viewpoint:
It is no exaggeration to say that Runciman single-handedly crafted the current popular concept of the crusades. The reasons for this are twofold. First, he was a learned man with a solid grasp of the chronicle sources. Second, and perhaps more important, he wrote beautifully. The picture of the crusades that Runciman painted owed much to current scholarship yet much more to Sir Walter Scott. Throughout his history Runciman portrayed the crusaders as simpletons or barbarians seeking salvation through the destruction of the sophisticated cultures of the east. In his famous &quot;summing-up&quot; of the crusades he concluded that &quot;the Holy War in itself was nothing more than a long act of intolerance in the name of God, which is a sin against the Holy Ghost.

Mark K. Vaughn (2007) says &quot;Runciman&#x27;s three-volume &quot;History of the Crusades&quot; remains the primary standard of comparison.&quot; However, Vaughn says that Tyerman &quot;accurately, if perhaps with a bit of hubris, notes that Runciman&#x27;s work is now outdated and seriously flawed.&quot; Tyerman himself has said, &quot;It would be folly and hubris to pretend to compete, to match, as it were, my clunking computer keyboard with his [Runciman&#x27;s] pen, at once a rapier and a paintbrush; to pit one volume, however substantial, with the breadth, scope and elegance of his three.&quot;

==Honours==
* Runciman was knighted in the 1958 New Year Honours List and appointed a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour in 1984. He was elected a Fellow of the British Academy in 1957 and a member of the American Philosophical Society in 1965.
*Streets in Mystras, Greece, and Sofia, Bulgaria, were named in his honour.

<text>Scapa distillery is a Scotch whisky distillery on The Mainland of Orkney, Scotland on the shore of Scapa Flow near the town of Kirkwall. Scapa is the third-northernmost whisky distillery in Scotland, south of the Highland Park Distillery.

==History==
The distillery was founded in 1885 by Macfarlane &amp; Townsend, a Glasgow blender. The distillery was almost destroyed by fire in 1919 but was saved by nearby sailors of the remaining Grand Fleet forming a human chain carrying buckets of sea water to extinguish the fire. In 1954, the distillery was acquired by Hiram Walker &amp; Sons Ltd (now part of Pernod Ricard) and rebuilt. The distillery was again refurbished in 1978.

In 1994 the distillery was mothballed, with limited production being occasionally carried out from 1997 by nearby staff from Highland Park distillery. Ownership of the distillery had passed to Allied distillers when they bought Hiram Walker in 1987 and in 2004, when facing definitive closure, the company decided to rebuild and restore the distillery at a cost of £2.1 million. In 2005, ownership passed to Pernod Ricard and full production recommenced in October 2005.

In 2015, a visitor centre opened at the distillery.

==Production and products==
The distillery has one wash still and one spirit still producing a single malt whisky. The wash still was a Lomond still, but the condensation plates that are the Lomonds still defining property have been removed, and it functions as a regular wash still.

this It produces an especially honey flavoured whisky, and less peaty than most Island Whiskies. This is because, though the water at the source is peaty, it gets transported to the distillery through pipelines to avoid more contact with the peat. Furthermore, the malt is not dried over peat smoke. The water source is the Lingro Burn, which flows into Scapa Flow.

During the period of limited production, the most commonly available edition was the Scapa 12 years old, which was and still is a most distinctive island whisky for its subtle heathery honey plus sea taste. Because of the time-gap, to full production again, it was decided to stop the 12 years and introduce the 14 years, which was quite different from its predecessor. Both products have now all but disappeared and are only available on the secondary market. The 14-year expression of the Scapa offering was given fair-to-good reviews at international spirit ratings competitions. It won gold and double gold medals at the 2005 and 2008 San Francisco World Spirits Competitions, but received a more modest score of 85 (on a 100-point scale) in 2005 from the Beverage Testing Institute.

In November 2009, a 16 years old Scapa whisky was released, with an extra two years in first fill American oak casks. The 16-year-old was discontinued in 2016.

The core products of the distillery are currently Scapa Skiren (matured in American first fill oak casks) and Scapa Glansa (a lightly smoked peat whisky). Scapa Glansa was launched in 2016 and is a no age statement whisky.

<doc id="761160" wikidata="Q350662" url="?curid=761160" title="Bon-Adrien Jeannot de Moncey">
<text>Bon-Adrien Jeannot de Moncey (or Jannot de Moncey), 1st duc de [[Conegliano]] (31 July 1754 – 20 April 1842) was a French military officer and a prominent commander in the French Revolutionary Wars and later a Marshal of the Empire during the Napoleonic Wars. He later became governor of the Hôtel des Invalides. Moncey is one of the names inscribed under the Arc de Triomphe, on Column 33.

==Early life and family==

Moncey was born on 31 July 1754 in Palise or Moncey, Doubs. His father was a lawyer from Besançon. During his childhood, he twice enlisted in the French Army, but his father procured his discharge on both occasions. His desire to be in the army was at last gratified when he received a commission in 1778.

===Family===
Moncey married Charlotte Prospère Remillet (1761–1842). The couple had three children:
*Anne-Francoise (1791–1842), married to Louis-Charles Bourlon de Chevigné, who was permitted by the King to add &quot;de Moncey&quot; to his surname in 1819.
*Bon-Louis (1792–1817)
*Jeanne-Francoise (1807–1853), married Alphonse-Auguste Duchesne de Gillevoisin de Conegliano (1798–1878), 2nd Baron de Gillevoisin and later 2nd Duke of Conegliano and 2nd Baron of Conegliano, who inherited his father-in-law&#x27;s titles.

==Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars==

Moncey was a captain when, in 1791, he embraced the principles of the French Revolution. He won great distinction in the campaigns of 1793 and 1794 during the War of the Pyrenees, rising from the commander of a battalion to the commander-in-chief of the Army of the Western Pyrenees in a few months. His successful operations were instrumental in compelling the Spanish government to make peace. After this, he was employed in the highest commands until 1799, when the government, suspecting him of being a royalist, dismissed him.

The coup d&#x27;état of 18 Brumaire in 1799 brought Moncey back to the active list, and during Napoleon&#x27;s Italian campaign of 1800, he led a corps from Switzerland into Italy, surmounting all the difficulties of bringing horses and guns over the formidable Gotthard Pass. In 1801, Napoleon made him inspector-general of the French Gendarmerie, and on the assumption of the imperial title, made him a Marshal of the Empire. In 1805, Moncey received the Grand Cordon of the Legion of Honour.
In July 1808, Moncey was made &quot;duc de Conegliano&quot; (&quot;Duke of Conegliano&quot;; it was a &quot;duché grand-fief&quot;, a rare hereditary honor. The title was later confirmed under the Bourbon Restoration, and, since he had no surviving son, Moncey was granted permission to pass it to his son-in-law (with his newly granted title of &quot;Baron of Conegliano&quot; and Peer of France).

=== Peninsular War ===

In late 1807 Moncey entered Spain at the head of the Corps of Observation of the Ocean Coast, part of France&#x27;s first Army of Spain, whereafter he occupied the area around Madrid. After the Dos de Mayo Uprising and the beginning of the Peninsular War he advanced on Valencia to put down the revolt there, but he was unable to take the city. Moncey then took a leading part in the emperor&#x27;s campaign on the Ebro and in the Second Siege of Saragossa in 1809.

=== War of the Sixth Coalition (March 1813 – May 1814) ===
He refused to serve in the invasion of Russia, and therefore had no share in the campaign of the &quot;Grande Armée&quot; in 1812 and 1813. However, when France was invaded in 1814, Moncey reappeared in the field and fought the last battle for Paris on the heights of Montmartre and at the barrier of Clichy.

In 1814, he supported Louis XVIII and was made a Peer of France as &quot;Baron of Conegliano&quot; (confirmed in 1825). He remained neutral during Napoleon&#x27;s return to power, feeling himself bound to Louis XVIII by his engagements as a Peer of France, but after Waterloo he was punished for refusing to take part in the court martial of Marshal Michel Ney; by imprisonment and the loss of his marshalate and peerage.

==Bourbon Restoration, July monarchy, and the last years==
In 1816, Moncey was given back his title of marshal by the king and he re-entered the Chamber of Peers three years later. He continued his military career as his last active service was as commander of an army corps of the Hundred Thousand Sons of Saint Louis in 1823. From 1833 to 1842, Moncey was governor of the Hôtel des Invalides (a home for veterans in Paris).

By the 1830s Moncey was among the last marshals of the first empire, and on 15 December 1840 Napoleon&#x27;s funeral was to take place after his mortal remains were brought back to France. The 86-year old marshal, gravely ill, and barely able to move, wanted to pay a final tribute to the emperor. Already seriously ill before the arrival of the coffin, he begged his doctor to stuff him with just enough drugs and medicine to be able to attend the emperor&#x27;s funeral, saying, &quot;Doctor, make me live a little longer, I want to honour the Emperor&quot;. He was brought to the altar on a wheelchair, awaiting the arrival of Napoleon&#x27;s corpse. When the emperor was brought in, Moncey tried to get up but, weakened, fell back onto his wheelchair. He was brought to the coffin, kissed the hilt of Napoleon&#x27;s sword. After the ceremony, he said &quot;Now let&#x27;s go home to die&quot;. He died little more than a year later.

<text>Wilhelm Röpke (; 10 October 1899 – 12 February 1966) was a German economist and social critic, one of the spiritual fathers of the social market economy. A professor of economics, first in Jena, then in Graz, Marburg, Istanbul, and finally Geneva, Röpke theorised and collaborated to organise the post-World War II economic re-awakening of the war-wrecked German economy, deploying a program referred to as ordoliberalism, a more conservative variant of German liberalism.

With Alfred Müller-Armack and Alexander Rüstow (sociological neoliberalism) and Walter Eucken and Franz Böhm (ordoliberalism) he elucidated the ideas, which then were introduced formally by Germany&#x27;s post-World War II Minister for Economics Ludwig Erhard, operating under Konrad Adenauer&#x27;s Chancellorship. Röpke and his colleagues&#x27; economic influence therefore is considered largely responsible for enabling Germany&#x27;s post-World War II &quot;economic miracle&quot;. Röpke was also a historian and was nominated to the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1965.

==Life==
Röpke was born in to the family of a rural doctor. His parents were devout Protestants and politically liberal. From 1917 he studied law and economics at the universities of Göttingen, Tübingen and Marburg. In 1921 he defended his doctoral thesis, and in 1922 he successfully completed the habilitation procedure for his doctoral degree at the University of Marburg. In 1922 he received a professorship at the University of Jena, becoming the youngest professor in Germany. This was followed by a stay in the US as a visiting professor for the Rockefeller Foundation, in 1928 an appointment at the University of Graz and in 1929 an appointment at the Philipps University in Marburg, where he worked until 1933 as a professor of political economy.

Röpke&#x27;s opposition to the German National Socialist regime led him (with his family) in 1933 to emigrate to Istanbul, Turkey, where he taught until 1937, before accepting a position at the Geneva Graduate Institute, where he lived until his death, in 1966.

==Work==
In his youth, Röpke was first inspired by socialism and afterwards by the Austrian School economist Ludwig von Mises. Despite this, the post-World War II economic liberation enabling Germany to once again lead Europe, which Röpke and his allies (Walter Eucken, Franz Böhm, Alfred Müller-Armack and Alexander Rüstow) were the intellectual muscle behind, occurred by implementing policy divergent to that advocated by Ludwig von Mises. Though the two men shared some beliefs in certain areas, Röpke and his colleagues instead formed the school of ordoliberalism and advocated free trade but with more central bank and state influence than what Austrian School economists suggest is required. Unlike many mainstream Austrian School economists, Röpke and the ordoliberals conceded that the market economy can be more disruptive and inhumane unless intervention is permitted a role to play.

Following Alexander Rüstow, Röpke concluded that free markets&#x27; vaunted efficiency and affluence can exact social and spiritual forfeits. In consequence, he envisioned a positive and more extensive role for the state, as rulemaker, enforcer of competition, and provider of basic social security.

During the Great Depression, Röpke argued in &quot;Crises and Cycles&quot; that a secondary deflation had to be combated through a fiscal reflation. It has been argued that the secondary deflation essentially is the same phenomenon that Taiwanese-American economist Richard C. Koo in later years has denoted as a balance sheet recession. In spite of this, however, Röpke remained a political decentralist and rejected Keynesian economics, deriding it as &quot;a typically intellectual construction that forgets the social reality behind the integral calculus&quot;.

For Röpke, rights and moral habits (&quot;Sitte&quot;) were key elements which the Central Bank and State (opposed to the Market-Economy) needed to subtly help organise. With a &quot;conforming&quot; social, economic, and financial policy, the task of which is to protect the weak &quot;beyond the market,&quot; to equalize interests, set rules of the game, and limit market power, Röpke strove for an economic order of &quot;economic humanism,&quot; something which he also referred to as the &quot;Third Way.&quot;

Röpke stood for a society and social policy in which human rights are given the highest importance. He believed that individualism must be balanced by a well-thought-out principle of sociality and humanity. Significantly, Röpke&#x27;s economic thought is highly congruent with Catholic social teaching. As he grew older, Röpke increasingly appreciated the overall, general benefits of a society that embraces spirituality, particularly in contrast to societies where spirituality is marginalized or demonized.

Röpke is also known for his pro-apartheid views on South Africa. In 1964, he published &quot;South Africa: An Attempt at a Positive Appraisal&quot;, which argued that apartheid was justified because the ‘South African Negro’ was not only of ‘an utterly different race’ but ‘a completely different type and level of civilisation’. Taking a position opposed to many Western governments, Röpke also supported the 1965 unilateral declaration of independence of Rhodesia, the racially-segregated southern African territory, from the British Empire.

== Influence ==

In particular, from 1930 to 1931, Röpke served on a government commission examining unemployment and, from 1947 to 1948, he served on Germany&#x27;s post-World War II currency reform council. Furthermore, Röpke personally advised the Chancellor of (post-World War II) West Germany, Konrad Adenauer, and his Minister of Economics, Ludwig Erhard up until the late 1950s, and therefore is credited with contributing the intellectual backbone of the now famous German Economic &quot;Miracle&quot;.

Occupying West Germany following the conclusion of World War II, the Western Allies (the US, Britain, and France) had continued to implement an economic policy of rationing as well as wage and price controls, coupled with the continued excessive printing of paper money. Production consequently collapsed and prominent businessmen once again became unwilling to accept the (relatively) worthless currency, triggering widespread shortages and the mainstreaming of a grey-market barter economy. Röpke&#x27;s &quot;The Solution to the German Problem&quot; (1947) illuminated the negative implications of the Western Allies&#x27; continuing of Hitler&#x27;s economic policies. Instead, Röpke proposed abolishing price controls and replacing the reichsmark with a sound, more trustworthy currency.

Accordingly, price and wage controls were then incrementally abolished and on June 21, 1948, the new Deutsche Mark was introduced. These long-range policy initiatives, however, spawned some civil unrest immediately following their implementation because of a consequent increase in unemployment. Despite these disturbances and stoically supported by Röpke&#x27;s learned newspaper writings, the Minister of Economics Ludwig Erhard persevered with foresight, and this eventually amounted to &quot;a great personal vindication for Röpke&quot;: Röpke and his allies had &quot;made West Germany immune to communism&quot;.

He was president of the Mont Pelerin Society from 1961 to 1962. But as a result of a long quarrel with Friedrich August von Hayek he stepped down and terminated his membership in it.

<text>Gondomar () is a Portuguese municipality located in the eastern part of the Porto Metropolitan Area, just from central Porto. The population in 2021 was 164,257, in an area of . The name &quot;Gondomar&quot; is sometimes attributed to the Visigothic king Gundemar, who may have established a religious domain in the region around the 7th century.

Notable for its long-standing tradition in jewelry-making, Gondomar is considered the heart of Portugal&#x27;s goldsmithing industry, accounting for 42% of the country&#x27;s annual production. Gondomar&#x27;s local gastronomy is deeply influenced by the nearby Douro River with dishes like shad and lamprey being regional specialties. Gondomar&#x27;s current mayor is Marco Martins.

== History ==
Archaeological discoveries reveal that Gondomar has been inhabited since prehistoric times. The area also shows evidence of Roman occupation, particularly through gold mining activities in the surrounding regions.

The name &quot;Gondomar&quot; is often attributed to the Visigothic king Gundemar, who is said to have established a couto (ecclesiastical domain) there in 610, although no evidence supports the presence of Visigothic knights in the area. Gondomar officially became a couto in 1193 when King Sancho I granted the Carta de Couto as part of a conciliatory agreement with the Bishop of Porto, Martinho Rodrigues, following a conflict between the diocese and the monarchy. This charter confirmed and expanded the bishop’s influence over the region, which had been part of the diocese&#x27;s holdings since 1120 through a donation by Countess Teresa to Bishop Hugo. The Carta de Couto was later confirmed by King Afonso II during the Inquirições and recognized Gondomar as the honra (noble domain) of Soeiro Reymondo, who owned a manor in the area.

In 1515, during the reign of King Manuel I, Gondomar was granted its first foral (charter), which modernized its administrative and fiscal framework as part of the monarch’s broader reforms aimed at centralizing power and updating local taxation systems. These fertile lands were also granted to Margarida de Vilhena, who was awarded various privileges, including income and rents from the territory.

Over the following centuries, the jurisdiction (Julgado) of Gondomar underwent several changes. Various administrative adjustments in the localities of Melres, Rio Tinto, Lomba, and São Pedro da Cova altered the municipality&#x27;s boundaries. Avintes and Campanhã were previously a part of the municipality, although they are now part of the municipalities of Vila Nova de Gaia and Porto respectively.

In 1868, the parishes of São Cosme, Valbom, Rio Tinto, Fânzeres, São Pedro da Cova, Jovim, Foz do Sousa, Covelo, Medas, Melres, and Lomba were incorporated into the municipality. São Cosme was officially confirmed as Gondomar&#x27;s municipal seat in 1927 following a formal request to the Presidency of the Republic.

In 1875, the opening of the Minho and Douro railway lines connected the parish of Rio Tinto to Porto and the Minho and Trás-os-Montes regions. The station became a vital hub for transporting goods such as coal from São Pedro da Cova, corn, furniture, and passengers, driving industrial development in the area. The original station, unable to accommodate growing demand, was replaced in 1935 by the current building. In 2011, the Porto Metro light-rail system reached the areas of Rio Tinto, Baguim do Monte and Fânzeres.

Significant milestones in the 20th century include the establishment of the parish of Baguim do Monte in 1985 and Gondomar&#x27;s elevation to city status in 1991, followed by Rio Tinto in 1995 and Valbom in 2005.

<doc id="761164" wikidata="Q164571" url="?curid=761164" title="Chuck Baldwin">
<text>Charles Obadiah Baldwin (born May 3, 1952) is an American right-wing politician, radio host, and founder-former Independent Baptist pastor of Crossroad Baptist Church in Pensacola, Florida. As of 2024 he is leading pastor of Liberty Fellowship in Kalispell, Montana. He was the presidential nominee of the Constitution Party for the 2008 U.S. presidential election and had previously been its nominee for vice president in 2004. He hosts a daily one-hour radio program, &quot;Chuck Baldwin Live&quot;, and writes a daily editorial column carried on its website, as well as on VDare. He is a former editor of NewsWithViews.com.

As a Republican Party member, Baldwin was state chairman of the Florida Moral Majority in the 1980s. However, during the 2000 campaign of Republican George W. Bush for U.S. president, Baldwin left the party and began a long period of criticism of Bush. Baldwin endorsed U.S. Representative Ron Paul for the 2008 Republican nomination for president, and Paul in turn endorsed Baldwin for the presidency in the 2008 general election. He identifies as an anti-Zionist, believing that Zionism is the main threat to the U.S. He writes that Zionists control the media, &quot;the mainstream Christian religion, and the U.S. government&quot; and that Zionism is responsible for the ills of U.S. society and culture.

The Southern Poverty Law Center identifies Baldwin as part of the antigovernment movement.

==Family and education==
Baldwin was born in La Porte, Indiana on May 3, 1952, to Edwin J. &quot;Ed&quot; Baldwin and his second wife, Ruth. Baldwin graduated from La Porte High School in 1971 and attended Midwestern Baptist College in Pontiac, Michigan, for two years. He met Connie Kay Cole there and married her on June 2, 1973. Though he originally had planned on a career in law enforcement, Baldwin felt called to evangelistic ministry; he moved to the South, and enrolled in, and graduated with a Bible diploma from, the Thomas Road Bible Institute (now the Liberty Bible Institute at Liberty University). He received unaccredited bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees in theology through correspondence programs from Christian Bible College of Rocky Mount, North Carolina.

==Ministry==
On June 22, 1975, Chuck and Connie Baldwin and four other individuals held the first meeting of what would become the Crossroad Baptist Church in Pensacola, Florida; Baldwin was the founding pastor. According to the SPLC, &quot;He preached an anti-abortion, anti-gay, fundamentalist gospel, and the church grew rapidly. It became a Christian evangelical Mecca, complete with a mock graveyard that honored aborted fetuses.&quot; By 1985, the church had gone through repeated building programs and been recognized by President Ronald Reagan for its unusual growth and influence.

==Political activity==
Prior to joining the Republican Party in 1980, Baldwin had been a registered Democrat, like his father. From 1980 to 1984, Baldwin served as Pensacola chairman and then state executive director of the Florida Moral Majority, organized by the Rev. Jerry Falwell. Baldwin helped carry the state twice for Reagan electors; he says he helped Falwell register some 50,000 Christian conservative voters. Baldwin&#x27;s father, Ed, a lifelong Democrat, expressed grudging admiration for what he saw as Reagan&#x27;s honesty and courage. In August 1994, Baldwin had a call-in radio show on the Christian Patriot Network.

In 2000, however, Baldwin left the Republican Party on grounds that the Bush–Cheney ticket was too liberal. He saw the two main parties as “two peas in the same pod”. Baldwin has said that many evangelical minds, similarly to ministers in Nazi Germany, had seemingly given George W. Bush &quot;the aura of an American Fuhrer&quot;. He considered himself an independent affiliated with the Constitution Party.

At about this time, Baldwin began hosting a local daily one-hour current-events radio program, &quot;Chuck Baldwin Live&quot;, which continues today nationwide on the Genesis Communications Network. He wrote a semiweekly editorial column carried on its website, chuckbaldwinlive.com, and in several newspapers. He has also appeared on numerous television shows and radio shows, including on MSNBC and CNN, and in churches across the country. He was the keynote speaker for the 50th anniversary of D-Day at Naval Air Station Pensacola. He also appeared on “The Political Cesspool,” a white nationalist radio program. His columns are archived on VDARE.com, a far right website and he has contributed to the antisemitic American Free Press website.

In 2006, Baldwin said his only organizational memberships were in his church, the Constitution Party, Gun Owners of America, and the National Rifle Association of America.

===2004 vice presidential campaign===
In the 2004 presidential election, Baldwin was the running mate of Michael Peroutka of Maryland and was the candidate for U.S. vice president on the Constitution Party ticket, the Alaskan Independence Party ticket, and other tickets and qualified write-in slots in 42 states. The two ran on a platform of &quot;For God, Family, and the Republic&quot;. The Peroutka–Baldwin campaign publicly spoke out against abortion, women in the military, and the Iraq War, and emphasized the Bible, traditional family values, and the need for Constitutionally limited government. According to Political Research Associates, &quot;Peroutka’s 2004 failed presidential campaign was well-known for touting conspiratorial claims&quot;.

The party joined with the American Independent Party, the Independent American Party and the Constitution Party to endorse Peroutka–Baldwin as their 2004 presidential ticket.

Peroutka was also endorsed by many paleoconservatives, the Alaskan Independence Party, the League of the South (accepted by Peroutka at its 2004 national convention), the Southern Party of Georgia, Samuel T. Francis, Alex Jones, Howard Phillips, and Taki Theodoracopulos. Pat Buchanan also stated there was a chance he would vote for Peroutka, counting them as &quot;a Buchananite party&quot;, but eventually endorsed Bush. The ticket came in fifth with 143,630 votes (0.12%) and spent $728,221, somewhat less per vote than either George W. Bush or John Kerry. It was the only third party to increase its share of the vote in 2004.

===2006-2008: Ron Paul and the Black Regiment===
In the Constitution Party&#x27;s April 2006 national convention in Tampa, Florida, a heated disaffiliation vote forced members to choose between one of two anti-abortion positions. The assembly voted not to disaffiliate the Independent American Party of Nevada over the more exceptive position of its gubernatorial candidate, Christopher H. Hansen. Baldwin voted in favor of disaffiliation, favoring the more conservative position. Baldwin remained with the party, but several conservative state parties subsequently voted to leave the national party, believing it to have unacceptably compromised the anti-abortion plank of its platform; rump factions have been orchestrated by the national Constitution Party in some of these states.

On August 30, 2007, Baldwin wrote an informal endorsement for Ron Paul for the GOP nomination: &quot;Conservative Republicans have only one choice for president in 2008: Congressman Ron Paul of Texas&quot;; more formal endorsement of Paul came in a December video. That same month, Baldwin said:
In April 2007, he launched an appeal for pastors to join the Black Regiment, a network of &quot;spiritual leaders&quot; who support values such as strong borders, resisting abortion and homosexuality, and repudiating George Bush&#x27;s &quot;unconstitutional&quot; policies. Members decline to register their churches with the IRS for purposes of federal tax exemption.

===2008 presidential campaign===
Baldwin&#x27;s vice presidential run, and Peroutka&#x27;s withdrawal from the national Constitution Party, led to active 2006 speculation that Baldwin would seek the presidential nomination in 2008. Baldwin responded in October that &quot;I have learned to never say never, but I have no desire to run. [It] would require several &#x27;miraculous&#x27; signs of reassurance that, frankly, I cannot see happening. However, I am always open to God&#x27;s will.&quot; He repeated this stance through March 2008.

Baldwin announced on April 10, two weeks before the national convention was held in Kansas City, Missouri, that he would make himself available for the party&#x27;s nomination at the convention, while &quot;not &#x27;running, but continuing to seek God&#x27;s will. A Nolan Chart writer conveyed speculation that Baldwin&#x27;s availability may have been responsive to the sudden candidacy of former ambassador Alan Keyes, who strongly favored the Iraq War. Baldwin, a noninterventionist, admitted others &quot;have urged me to place my name in nomination&quot;. In a convention speech, party founder Howard Phillips endorsed Baldwin and controversially referred to Keyes as a neoconservative and a too-recent Republican.

Baldwin was nominated on April 26, 2008, after what was described as the most contentious battle in the party&#x27;s 16-year history. He received 383.8 votes, ahead of Keyes, who drew 125.7 votes from delegates; Keyes had abandoned the Republicans for the Constitution Party (one month before the Constitution Party convention), much as Baldwin had done in 2000. Party members such as national chairman Jim Clymer said Baldwin&#x27;s stands were more in line with party thinking. Baldwin asked the convention to nominate bankruptcy attorney Darrell Castle of Tennessee as his running mate, and this request was honored.

After Ron Paul withdrew from the Republican campaign in June, he remained neutral about making a presidential endorsement. On September 10, Paul held a National Press Club conference at which Baldwin, Green Party nominee Cynthia McKinney, and independent candidate Ralph Nader all agreed on four principles—quickly ending the Iraq War, protecting privacy and civil liberties, stopping increases in the national debt, and investigating the Federal Reserve—and on their opposition to the Democratic and Republican parties ignoring these issues. Paul&#x27;s advice at the conference was to vote for whichever third-party candidate one has the most affinity to, because &quot;we must maximize the total votes of those rejecting the two major candidates.&quot; However, on September 22, 2008, Paul stated his neutrality was &quot;due to my respect and friendship and support from both the Constitution and Libertarian Party members ... and I&#x27;m a ten-term Republican congressman. It is not against the law to participate in more than one political party.&quot; Paul then gave his endorsement to Baldwin: &quot;Unsolicited advice from the Libertarian Party candidate ... has [persuaded] me to reject my neutral stance in the November election. I&#x27;m supporting Chuck Baldwin, the Constitution Party candidate.&quot; Paul later clarified that though he would vote for Baldwin, he recognized the diversity of his support base and could not bind anyone&#x27;s conscience. A former Paul primary backer, Houston term limits pioneer Clymer Wright, also contributed to the Baldwin campaign.

Baldwin wrote specifically against the candidacies of Barack Obama and John McCain, and those of vice-presidential nominees Sarah Palin and Joe Biden. In his campaign, he said that the September 11 terrorist attacks might have been an &quot;inside job,&quot; attacked Republicans for not eliminating federal departments, called for closing of the Education and Energy departments of the Federal Government and the IRS and Federal Reserve, and called for the U.S. to withdraw from the United Nations, &quot;a sinister organization run by Marxists, socialists and communists&quot;.

Baldwin received 199,314 votes, 0.15% of the popular vote, putting him in fifth place, while Paul and Peroutka polled 2% in Montana.

===Move to Montana: Liberty Fellowship and the American Redoubt===
In 2010, Baldwin retired from his position as pastor of Crossroad Baptist Church and announced his intention to move with his extended family to Montana, because he believed God had told him that the mountain states were the &quot;tip of the spear in the freedom fight&quot;. In March 2011, he wrote an article in support of the American Redoubt strategic relocation movement originated by novelist and blogger James Wesley Rawles. This plan designates five western states (Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, eastern Oregon, and eastern Washington) as a safe haven for conservative Christians. In a June 9, 2011 article, Baldwin outlined his reasons for choosing the Flathead Valley of western Montana for his family&#x27;s home. He cited Montana&#x27;s freedom-loving people, its recognition of the right to keep and bear arms, and a feeling of strong conviction, following prayer: &quot;“We know there’s a fight coming. We know there is a line being drawn in the sand, and we want to be in the right place. The good ground is right here in Montana,”

He established a new church in Montana, the Liberty Fellowship, based in the Kalispell area, where congregants have included survivalist Randy Weaver and neo-Nazi activist April Gaede. Gaede described on the Stormfront website how Baldwin&#x27;s sermons move her to tears. BuzzFeed describes the church as &quot;an anti-government, anti-globalism church... that serves as a beacon for the extreme political right — a mix of constitutionalists, militia members, and separatists&quot;.

In 2011, Baldwin spoke at a survivalist expo in the Flathead Valley, hosted by Flathead Liberty Bell, an organization led by former militia leader David Burgert, alongside Stewart Rhodes, the founder of the right-wing Oath Keepers movement.

In December 2019, Rawles listed Baldwin first in a list of &quot;key leaders and promoters of the American Redoubt movement&quot;.

===2012 campaign for lieutenant governor===
In November, 2011, Republican Montana gubernatorial candidate Bob Fanning selected Chuck Baldwin as his running mate. Baldwin withdrew his candidacy for lieutenant governor on February 12, 2012, several months before the June primary.

===2012 presidential nomination===
In July 2012, the Reform Party of the United States&#x27; Kansas affiliate nominated Baldwin as its presidential candidate, though Andre Barnett was the national candidate. Baldwin received 5,017 votes, or 0.43% of the total popular vote in Kansas.

===Second Amendment Pastors, Oath Keepers===
In January 2013, Baldwin launched a network of Second Amendment Pastors, which resists the registration of firearms.

Also in 2013, Baldwin became the national chaplain of the anti-government Oath Keepers group.

In 2014, he gave a sermon at an armed stand-off between anti-government activists led by Cliven Bundy and federal agents at Bundy&#x27;s ranch in Nevada.

===The COVID-19 pandemic===
Although he told congregants that he believed COVID-19 to be real, Baldwin preached that federal and state public health measures against it were a &quot;pretext for civil tyranny&quot;, a form of &quot;Medical martial law&quot; and a &quot;psychological ops campaign against the American people&quot;.

Baldwin resigned from his Oath Keepers position in April 2020, due to the group&#x27;s response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The group pledged support for public health measures such as suspending public gatherings, to which Baldwin responded: &quot;By resorting to gross fearmongering and hyperbole, you have joined the mainstream media and Big Government medical hacks in attacking virtually every constitutionally protected liberty upon which our country was founded.&quot;

Early in the pandemic, he committed to holding an in-person Easter gathering in defiance of the state governor&#x27;s prohibition, saying &quot;Am I now going to allow a bunch of misguided physicians and government bureaucrats tell me that I can no longer serve God the way he has called me to serve him? If I were to do so, I would be less than a Christian.&quot; His YouTube channel hosted a viral video in April 2020 alleging federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to be artificially inflating the recorded number of coronavirus deaths.

Baldwin called Anthony Fauci a &quot;Big Pharma fascist&quot; in 2020.

==Political positions==
===Moral issues===
Baldwin has several beliefs typically distinctive of Independent Baptists. For example, he believes in the primacy of the local New Testament church, considers homosexuality as a &quot;moral perversion&quot;, favours strict abstinence from drinking and smoking, and strict diet and exercise. In 2010, he identified as a &quot;premillennial dispensationalist&quot;, interpreting the Book of Revelation literally. He believes that America has evolved into &quot;a matriarchal society&quot; and that it is losing the &quot;inner toughness&quot; of masculinity.

===Islam===
In 2002 he wrote a booklet, &quot;What Every Christian Should Know About Islam&quot;. It says that &quot;The Muslim religion has been a bloody, murderous religion since its inception.&quot; Baldwin summarizes Muslim persecution of Christians by saying, &quot;Only communism rivals Islam in sheer numbers of people persecuted and killed&quot;. However, more recently, he has argued that Zionism constitutes a greater threat to America than Islamic terrorism, and urged Christians to draw distinctions between different sects of Islam.

===Foreign policy===
Baldwin supports American sovereignty and is an opponent of what he sees as the New World Order. He has stated that fighting against one-world government is his top priority. He believes globalism in government has led to many connected threats and issues, among which he lists illegal immigration, the United Nations, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the North American Free Trade Agreement, CAFTA, the North American Union, the Trans-Texas Corridor, the Iraq War, China, the Security and Prosperity Partnership, and the Free Trade Area of the Americas. He would also effect United States withdrawal from the United Nations and has pledged to push the UN out of its New York City offices.

Baldwin believed that &quot;the invasion and occupation of Iraq was absolutely unnecessary&quot; and said his presidency would result in troop withdrawal from Iraq.

Baldwin argues that Iran is not an enemy, saying &quot;Our enemy is those warmongering miscreants in Washington, D.C., Tel Aviv, Riyadh and London.&quot; And that &quot;when did the terrible &#x27;terrorist&#x27; state of Iran shoot down a U.S. passenger jet and murder nearly 300 innocent civilian passengers? You can&#x27;t remember? Well, you can&#x27;t remember, because Iran did NOT shoot down an American passenger jet; it was America that shot down an Iranian passenger jet.&quot;

He has written that &quot;the Mexican government is deliberately and systematically working to destabilize and undermine the very fabric and framework of American society.&quot; He strongly opposes &quot;amnesty&quot; for illegal immigrants and would try to end illegal immigration.

Baldwin has suggested reopening the investigation into the September 11 attacks, believing that the 9/11 truth movement has a right to have &quot;alternative&quot; 9/11 theories investigated, including those that raise the possibility of U.S. government involvement in the attacks.

Baldwin has long been a critic of neoconservatism, and argues that recent wars that America has fought in the middle east are &quot;waged on behalf of the Zionist state&quot; [of Israel]. He is especially critical of attempts at regime change in Iraq, Libya, Syria and Iran, considering American involvement therein to be intended to assist Israel in the creation of a &quot;Greater Israel&quot; that would make &quot;Israel the dominant political and military force in the region&quot;. He also opposes Donald Trump, calling him a &quot;Zionist puppet&quot;; he believes that Trump has betrayed his previous campaign promises to keep America out of wars, even going so far as to argue that &quot;Trump is making all of the overtures of taking us into the Third World War&quot; and speaking favorably of General Smedley Butler&#x27;s anti-war book &quot;War is a Racket&quot;.

=== Antisemitism and anti-Zionism ===
Baldwin is frequently described as antisemitic. He believes that the &quot;castrated churches&quot; of America are terrified of &quot;Judaizers&quot;.

Baldwin argues that, &quot;Zionists heavily influence—if not outright control—the mainstream news media, the major motion picture industry, the popular entertainment industry, mainstream Christian religion, and the U.S. government. I&#x27;ll say it straight out: Zionism is not only a &#x27;clear and present danger&#x27; to the liberties of the American people; it is the BIGGEST danger to the liberties of the American people.&quot; Baldwin argues that Israel is a fascist apartheid state that &quot;commits mass murder against defenseless Palestinians&quot; and is responsible for the deaths of innocent Palestinians and hundreds of thousands of other Arabs, as well as thousands of Americans. He considers Israel a creation of the Jewish Rothschild dynasty, to which he also ascribes much of the blame for the Russian Revolution. In a similar vein, he believes the Israel Lobby exercises a harmful influence over US politics, and he opposes attempts to criminalize boycotts of Israel, arguing that laws against such boycotts violate Americans&#x27; civil rights. He has argued that neoconservatives and &quot;Zionist billionaires&quot; &quot;prop up&quot; former Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whom he labels a &quot;warmonger&quot; and &quot;criminal&quot;

Baldwin believes that &quot;Zionism has killed more Americans (not to mention the hundreds of thousands of innocent men, women, and children throughout the Arab world) through our perpetual wars-for-Israel; destroyed the Christian faith of generations of America&#x27;s youth; destroyed the sanctity of the traditional family; infested America with every kind of moral rot and sexual perversion; and has Judaized the Christian Church in America to the point of turning the fascist Zionist State of Israel into an object of worship.&quot;

He also argues that Zionism is a fascist and communist movement, writing: &quot;Anyone who claims to be opposed to globalism and neoconism but denies the pernicious part that Zionism plays in globalism and neoconism is either badly ignorant of what globalism and neoconism really are or is knowingly providing cover for the Zionists—and is, therefore, controlled opposition for Zionists. I believe the latter is true in far, far too many cases. And never forget the fact that at their center Zionists are fascists and communists.&quot;

He also blames &quot;Zionist influence&quot; in &quot;America&#x27;s entertainment industries, economic policies, educational systems, news networks (including and maybe especially FOX News) and America&#x27;s political and religious institutions&quot; for what he perceives as a decline in &quot;America&#x27;s family/moral culture, educational culture, economic culture, entertainment culture, political culture, and, yes, Christian culture&quot;. He argues that &quot;Christian Zionism&quot; is a &quot;false theology&quot; and is distinct from what he terms &quot;traditional Christianity&quot;, which in his view does not recognize the modern state of Israel as a fulfillment of Biblical prophecy. He argues that &quot;Christian Zionists&quot; are influenced by the Scofield Bible, which he considers heretical.

He is highly critical of media personality Ben Shapiro, calling him a &quot;Zionist Christ-rejecting blasphemer&quot;, comparing him with the Pharisees, and arguing that Shapiro is not a true conservative.

===Economy===
Baldwin says he would end all federal income taxes and phase out the Internal Revenue Service. His website also says that &quot;a tariff on foreign imports, based on the difference between the foreign item&#x27;s cost of production abroad and the cost of production of a similar item produced in the United States, would be a Constitutional step toward a fair trade policy that would protect American jobs and, at the same time, raise revenue for our national government.&quot;

He has said that as president he would streamline the federal government and tap oil reserves in Alaska, the Dakotas, and the Gulf of Mexico. He believes the United States should return to the gold standard.

===States&#x27; rights and characterization of the Civil War===
NewsOne.com has described Baldwin as a Neo-Confederate. Baldwin believes that &quot;the South was right in the War Between the States&quot; (referring to the American Civil War), and that the leaders of the Confederacy were not racists. He uses the term &quot;War for Southern Independence&quot; and &quot;War of Northern Aggression&quot;.

He criticized George W. Bush&#x27;s failure to rescind executive orders by Bill Clinton that Baldwin argued undermined states&#x27; rights and private property rights.

In 2010, he spoke at a Neo-Confederate &quot;Alabama Secession Day Commemoration&quot; linked to the League of the South.

===Individual liberties===
Baldwin &quot;believe[s] the federal &#x27;war on terror&#x27; and &#x27;war on drugs&#x27; are mostly a cover for power-hungry, Big Government zealots to trample constitutional government and squash freedoms and liberties, which are supposed to be protected by the Bill of Rights and Declaration of Independence&quot;. He opposes the Patriot Act and related legislation and orders, saying that it &quot;deprives the people of their rights secured under the Fourth and Fifth Amendments under the guise of &#x27;combating terrorism&#x27; or &#x27;protecting national security. In relation to airplane captain Don Carty profiling a customer&#x27;s credentials and behavior, Baldwin stated that &quot;profiling of all sorts is a very necessary tool for effective law enforcement. Only morons would try to hamper a lawman&#x27;s ability to bring criminals to justice by removing this tool from them.&quot;

Regarding the separation of church and state, Baldwin believes that &quot;America was deliberately and distinctively founded as a haven for Christians&quot; and he supports the public display of the Ten Commandments in government buildings.

He says that freedom of association in health care is important: &quot;I strongly support the freedom of choice of practitioner and treatment for all citizens for their health care. ... The government should not have the power to force people to receive immunizations or vaccinations.&quot; He also would eliminate the Food and Drug Administration as unconstitutional.

Baldwin supports freedom for homeschooling and private schooling and wants to disband the U.S. Department of Education; he says that he would be the best friend homeschoolers have ever had in the White House.

Baldwin previously stated 
If we were really serious about making airline travel safer, we would immediately cease and desist from this incessant infatuation with meddling into the internal affairs of foreign countries, stop invading and occupying foreign countries, and stop our own State Department and CIA from sticking their noses where they don&#x27;t belong--which only serves to agitate the world against us. We&#x27;d stop giving out travel visas to people from countries sympathetic to terrorists; seal the US border--especially the southern border; and allow pilots, policemen, and any other citizen lawfully qualified to carry a firearm to carry those weapons on board the aircraft.
Baldwin believes that the right to keep and bear arms should not be infringed by the government: A Baldwin Administration will uphold the right of the citizens to keep and bear arms and will oppose attempts to prohibit ownership of guns by law-abiding citizens, and, further, will stand against all laws which would require the registration of guns or ammunition. . . . Richard Henry Lee, a signer of the Declaration, once said, &quot;To preserve liberty, it is essential that the whole body of the people always possess arms, and be taught alike, especially when young, how to use them.&quot; Just as the right to bear arms is necessary in the defense against tyranny, so [too] is that same right vital for the purpose of self-defense. ... Firearms are used 60 times more often to protect the lives of honest citizens than to take lives. ... The vast majority of the time (92%), the mere presence of a firearm helps to avert a major crime from occurring. That is what Congressman Roscoe Bartlett (R-MD) concluded after extensive research. According to Rep. Bartlett, the number of defensive uses is four times the number of crimes reported committed with guns. According to Political Research Associates, he believes revolution is preferable to gun control.

Baldwin had already begun promoting militia movements on his radio show as early as 1995. He says that in his opinion, people like Morris Dees, head of the Southern Poverty Law Center, try to &quot;pander the market of fear, trying to convince everybody that anyone with a gun, any person who wants to own a gun, and anyone who would consider themselves part of a citizen militia is a threat to our government and to our society&quot;. He takes a critical view of the federal government&#x27;s handling of Randy Weaver, the Branch Davidians, and Hutaree.

Baldwin firmly opposes abortion (which he sees as &quot;murder&quot; and &quot;America&#x27;s national Holocaust&quot;) and &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;. He favors Ron Paul&#x27;s Sanctity of Life Act and says his presidency would end abortion. He opposes female military combat service, saying in 2010 it &quot;does not serve the interests of combat effectiveness. Neither does it serve the interests of family and child rearing.&quot; He also opposes mixed service, and homosexual service.

==Recognition==
Baldwin has received two honorary doctor of divinity degrees, from Christian Bible College and from Trinity Baptist College in Jacksonville, Florida.

<text>Valongo () is a Portuguese municipality located in the District of Porto and 10 km from Porto, in the northern region of Portugal.

The municipality area consists of and 94,672 inhabitants in 2021, and it is subdivided into four parishes: Alfena, Campo e Sobrado, Ermesinde and Valongo. The municipality is limited to the north by the municipality of Santo Tirso, to the northeast by Paços de Ferreira, to the east by Paredes, to the southwest by Gondomar and to the west by Maia.

== History ==
The Municipality of Valongo was created in 1836 as a part of the administrative reform of the country, which occurred during the reign of D. Maria II. However, human occupation of this region predates the Roman conquest of the Iberian Peninsula.

===Ancient history===
This region was occupied by the Romans, especially for gold mining in the Serra de Santa Justa. One of the traces of Roman occupation is in the municipality name, which originated in the Latin words &quot;Vallis Longus&quot;. There are still traces that would allow the detection of two main Roman connecting roads that would cross the municipality: the Porto - Guimarães road and the Alfena - Valongo - Aguiar de Sousa / Penafiel road.

This region would then be occupied by the germanic Suebi and Visigoths and later by Arabs and Moors. Toponyms in the municipality from this period include &quot;Luriz&quot; of germanic origin and “Moirama”, “Ilhar Mourisco” and “Alfena” from Arabic origin.

According to Father Lopes dos Reis, a native of Valongo, “the Moors entered Hespanha enthusiastic about the holy war with the alfange in one hand and Al Koran in the other, taking over with their powerful army all the places they could pass through. In Vallongo, perhaps there was no blood at all, because the inhabitants, few and without defense, could only fearlessly try to prevent the passage to a powerful enemy from whom they had known that an army of brave people had fled in terror. That is why, when the Arabs arrived in Vallongo (716), they left their people in peace without writing it, and by means of a certain tribute they gave them the freedom to live as they did here, going to settle far from the Goda settlement, which occupied the Susão and the western part of the villa, on the plain at the edge of a stream that was later called Ilhar Mourisco.”

After the &quot;reconquest&quot; of &quot;Portus Cale&quot; (Porto) by Vímara Peres in 868, he was named a count and given control of the frontier region between the Lima and Douro rivers by Alfonso III of Asturias, therefore bringing the region under control of the Kingdom of Asturias.

===Middle ages===
From the General Inquiries of 1258, the current municipality was divided at the time between the jurisdiction (julgado) of Aguiar de Sousa - which included S. Martinho de Campo and Sobrado, and the jurisdiction of Maia, which included S. Vicente da Queimadela, Valongo and S. Lourenço de Asmes.

From the economic and social point of view, at this time, the ownership of land was the basis of the economy and the main element of survival and power. In the area of the municipality, land belonged to the King and the Clergy - particularly the Regular Clergy.

The appearance of new settlements, the progressive extension of the term of existing settlements, the multiplication of suffragan chapels and the division of property, is evidence of the notorious demographic growth of this region over the centuries. This increase in population was accompanied by the progressive development of other sectors of the economy. Industry and commerce, initially based on incipient forms, acquire a strong expression in the economy. The traditional bakery industry is an excellent example of this: its origins date back to the Low Middle Ages, but the development of wheat bread is such a development, which allowed Valongo bakers to feed the entire surrounding region and with the product of their work. This, in turn, allows them to make a decisive contribution. for the construction of the new church, the Igreja Matriz de Valongo, whose construction dates to the end of the 18th century.

===19th century===
At the dawn of the 19th century, Valongo experiences the hardship of the presence of Napoleon&#x27;s troops, during the French Invasions. A division settled in Valongo, turning the church into a stable and plundering values from individuals and the church.

These lands, therefore, served as a stage for battles and military movements that took place between the two straying brothers: D. Pedro, on the side of the Liberals, D. Miguel, on the part of the Miguelists/Absolutists. During this period two important battles take place: the Battle of Ponte Ferreira and the Battle of the Ant. In Ermesinde, the former Convent of Nª. Mr. do Bom Despacho (now, the Church of St. Rita), became a military hospital for Miguelists forces.

By decree published on November 29, 1836, D. Maria II creates the Municipality of Valongo with the parishes of Sobrado, Campo and Gandra (which belonged to the Municipality of Baltar) and Alfena, Ermesinde and Valongo (which belonged to the Municipality of Maia).

On May 18, 1852, there was a lunch at Travagem offered by the Municipality chamber to the Royal Family composed of Queen D. Maria II, King D. Fernando II, then prince D. Pedro (future D. Pedro V) and then prince D. Luís (future D. Luís I). This lunch took place on the last visit of D. Maria II to the north of Portugal in the form of thanks for the creation of the Municipality of Valongo in 1836.

Years later, there would be another royal visit, this time by D. Luís and D. Maria Pia. &quot;For a long time, there was still talk with great admiration of the gigantic and beautiful arches that were made in many places of passage of the procession and that gave the celebrations an admirable splendor.&quot;

Between the end of the 18th century and the beginning of the 20th century, large farming houses were built across the municipality. The road network was developed within the limits of the municipality, which began being served by transport such as the tram and train. The main artery of Valongo and Ermesinde saw the opening of commercial establishments. During this time, the local population increased with migration from the interior of Portugal.

By the middle of the 19th century, the region became an attractive site for the mining of slate, but also of antimony, tungsten and coal. At the borders of Ermesinde, large factories were set up, such as “Resineira”, “Cerâmica” - “Empresa Industrial de Ermesinde” and “Têxtil de Sá”, among others. The Municipality became the site for the expansion of industries such as metallurgy, textile manufacturing, civil construction, public works, food, wood and furniture. Compared to the other parishes, Campo and Sobrado retain a greater level of rurality. The smallholding regime sustain their living with traditional productions - the vine, the corn and the fodder, which is linked to the production of milk. New crops such as kiwi and also were introduced to the region.

Religious Patrimony

Slate

There&#x27;s a strong presence of slate mining industry and different transformative industries associated with slate, whose industrialization began in the 19th century and matured in the 20th century. Slate was formed 350 million years ago by a metamorphosis of shale, clay and volcanic ash that results to a fine-grained foliated rock. Common application and uses of slate can be found in writing slates, blackboards, as a roofing material, for billiard table tops and in the decoration industry. The Slate Museum (&quot;Museu da Lousa&quot;) is located in the town of Campo.

Portuguese traditional toys

Alfena is home to an industry of handmade portuguese traditional toys, made using different kinds of available, and often recycled, materials including paper, wood, plate, celluloid and plastic. Toys often depict objects used in daily tasks.

&quot;Regueifa&quot; and Biscuits

Regueifa is a form of bread popular in northern Portugal. The manufacture of bread in Valongo has been documented since the Middle Ages. In addition to being an indispensable daily food, a means of paying forums, it is likely that the biscuit was part of the sailors&#x27; rations during the period of the discoveries, thus paving the way for the manufacture of the biscuit that we know today. With the introduction of American big corn, the bread came to prominence and with the French invasions the “&quot;mollet&quot;” started to be produced. Currently, regueifa is considered a delicacy in the world of bread, with the regueifa of Valongo being famous in northern Portugal.

<text>Local government is the third level of government in Australia, administered with limited autonomy under the states and territories, and in turn beneath the federal government. Local government is not mentioned in the Constitution of Australia, and two referendums in 1974 and 1988 to alter the Constitution relating to local government were unsuccessful. Every state/territory government recognises local government in its own respective constitution. Unlike the two-tier local government system in Canada or the United States, there is (largely) only one tier of local government in each Australian state/territory, with no distinction between counties and cities.

The Australian local government is generally run by a council, and its territory of public administration is referred to generically by the Australian Bureau of Statistics as the local government area or LGA, each of which encompasses multiple suburbs or localities (roughly equivalent to neighborhoods) often of different postcodes; however, stylised terms such as &quot;city&quot;, &quot;borough&quot;, &quot;region&quot; and &quot;shire&quot; also have a geographic or historical interpretation. The council board members are generally known as councillors, and the head councillor is called the mayor or Shire President. As of August 2016, there were 547 local councils in Australia.

Despite the (largely) single tier of local governance in Australia, there are a number of extensive regions with relatively low populations that are not a part of any established LGA. Powers of local governments in these unincorporated areas may be exercised by special-purpose governing bodies established outside of the local legislation, as with Victoria&#x27;s alpine resorts; or directly administered by state/territory governments, such as the entirety of the Australian Capital Territory. The administrative area covered by local government councils in Australia ranges from as small as for the Shire of Peppermint Grove in the Perth metropolitan region, to as big as for the Pastoral Unincorporated Area in South Australia.

As an exception to the generalisation that Australian local government has only a single tier, New South Wales has county councils, which are special purpose local governments governing county districts composed of two or more LGAs; variously responsible for water supply, flood mitigation and weed management; formerly they also played significant role in urban planning, electricity distribution, and some also operated abattoirs. By the 21st century, only a handful remain, with the majority of New South Wales LGAs no longer belong to any county council.

==Types of local government==


Local governments are subdivisions of the six federated states as well as the Northern Territory. The Australian Capital Territory has no separate local government, and municipal functions in Canberra and the surrounding regions (normally performed by local governments in other states) are performed by the ACT territorial government. The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), however, considers the entire ACT as an &quot;unincorporated&quot; local government area, even though it is technically a state-level administrative region.

Although all essentially identical in functions and jurisdictions, Australian local governments have a variety of different titles. The term &quot;local government area&quot; (LGA) is used by the ABS to collectively refer to all local government administrative zones regardless of the varying designations, whilst the local governing legislature itself is generally known as a council. In general, an urban/suburban LGA is called a &quot;&quot;city&quot;, as in the City of Melbourne, City of Canada Bay and City of Bunbury; while an exurban/rural LGA covering a larger agricultural/natural area is usually called a &quot;shire&quot;&quot;, as in Shire of Mornington Peninsula, Shire of Banana and Lachlan Shire.

Sometimes designations other than &quot;city&quot; or &quot;shire&quot; are used in the names of LGAs, and today the stylised titles of &quot;town&quot;, &quot;borough&quot;, &quot;municipality&quot;, &quot;district&quot;, &quot;region&quot;, &quot;community government&quot;, &quot;Aboriginal council/shire&quot; and &quot;island&quot; are used in addition. The word &quot;municipality&quot; occurs in some states with differing meanings: in New South Wales it is typically used for older urban areas, and the word is used for some rural towns in South Australia. Larger towns and small metropolitan exurban centres in Queensland and Western Australia simply use the term &quot;town&quot;, while in Victoria they are designated as &quot;rural city&quot;. Historically, the word &quot;borough&quot; was common for small towns and suburban centers in Victoria, but nowadays only the Borough of Queenscliffe remains as the one and only borough in the entire country. New South Wales and Queensland have also introduced a new term &quot;region&quot; for outback LGAs formed by the amalgamation of smaller shires and rural cities. In New South Wales, where the Local Government Act does not mandate adopting a designation, some local government areas are legally known simply as &quot;council&quot;, such as Port Macquarie-Hastings Council, Inner West Council and Federation Council. Some rural areas in South Australia are known as &quot;district council&quot;, and all the LGAs in Tasmania that were previously municipalities have been renamed &quot;council&quot;.

Almost all local councils have the same administrative functions and similar political structures, regardless of their naming, and retain a particular designation (&quot;shire&quot;, &quot;borough&quot;, &quot;town&quot;, &quot;city&quot;) for historical reasons only. They will typically have an elected council and usually a mayor or shire president responsible for chairing meetings of the council. In some councils, the mayor is a directly elected figure, but in most cases the mayor is elected by the board of fellow councillors. The powers of mayors vary as well; for example, mayors in Queensland have broad executive functions, whereas mayors in New South Wales are essentially ceremonial figureheads who can only exercise power at the discretion of the council.

Most of the capital city LGAs administer only the central business districts and nearby central suburbs. A notable exception is the City of Brisbane, the most populous LGA in the country, which administers a significant part of the Brisbane metropolitan area. In most cases, when a city&#x27;s population statistics are used, it is the statistical division population rather than the local government area.

=== Local governments by type and state ===
The following table provides a summary of local government areas by states and territories by local government area types as of December 2023:

Note the above table does not include the county councils of New South Wales, which while a form of local government are not classified as being local government areas.

===Classification===
The Australian Classification of Local Governments (ACLG) categorises local governing authorities using the population, the population density and the proportion of the population that is classified as being urban for the council. The classification, at the two-digit level, is:

* RA Rural Agricultural
* RS Rural Significant
* RT Rural Remote
* UC Urban Capital
* UD Urban Developed
* UF Urban Fringe
* UR Urban Regional

==Powers and functions==
All local governments are approximately equal in their theoretical powers, although LGAs that encompass large cities such as Brisbane and the Gold Coast command more resources due to their larger population base. Unlike local governments in many other countries, services such as police, fire protection and schools are provided by respective state or territory governments rather than by local councils. However, local governments still maintain some responsibility for fire service functions within Queensland and Western Australia.

The councils&#x27; chief responsibility in the first half of the 20th century was the provision of physical infrastructure such as roads, bridges and sewerage. From the 1970s the emphasis changed to community facilities such as libraries and parks, maintenance of local roads, town planning and development approvals, and local services such as waste disposal. Child care, tourism and urban renewal were also beginning to be part of local governments&#x27; role. These are financed by collection of local land taxes known as &quot;rates&quot;, and grants from the state and Commonwealth governments. They are caricatured as being concerned only with the &quot;three Rs&quot;: Rates, Roads and Rubbish.

However, the roles of local government areas in Australia have recently expanded as higher levels of government have devolved activities to the third tier. Examples include the provision of community health services, regional airports and pollution control as well as community safety and accessible transport. The changes in services has been described as a shift from &#x27;services to property&#x27; towards &#x27;services to people&#x27;. Community expectations of local government in Australia have risen in the 21st century partly as a result of wider participation in decision-making and transparent management practices.

Recent years have seen some State governments devolving additional powers onto LGAs. In Queensland and Western Australia LGAs have been granted the power to independently enact their own local subsidiary legislation, in contrast to the previous system of by-laws. Councils also have organised their own representative structures such as Local Government Associations and Regional Organisations of Councils.

Doctrines of New Public Management have shaped state government legislation towards increased freedoms aiming to allow greater flexibility on the part of local governments.

==History==
There is no mention of local government in the Constitution of Australia, though it is mentioned several times in the Annotated Constitution of Australia. &quot;Municipal institutions and local government&quot; appears in Annotation 447, and &quot;Power of the Parliament of a Colony&quot; appears under &quot;Residuary Legislative Powers&quot; on pages 935 and 936.

The first official local government in Australia was the Perth Town Trust, established in 1838, only three years after British settlement. The Adelaide Corporation followed, created by the province of South Australia in October 1840. The City of Melbourne and the Sydney Corporation followed, both in 1842. All of these early forms failed; it was not until the 1860s and 1870s that the various colonies established widespread stable forms of local government, mainly for the purpose of raising money to build roads in rural and outer-urban regions. Council representatives attended conventions before Federation, however local government was unquestionably regarded as outside the Constitutional realm.

In the 1970s, the Whitlam government expanded the level of funding to local governments in Australia beyond grants for road construction. General purpose grants become available for the first time.

===Reforms===
Significant reforms took place in the 1980s and 1990s in which state governments used metrics and efficiency analysis developed within the private sector in the local government arena. Each state conducted an inquiry into the benefits of council amalgamations during the 1990s. In the early 1990s, Victoria saw the number of local councils reduced from 210 to 78. South Australia, Tasmania and Queensland saw some reductions in the number of local governments while Western Australia and New South Wales rejected compulsory mergers. New South Wales eventually forced the merging of some councils. The main purpose of amalgamating councils was for greater efficiency and to improve operations, but forced amalgamation of councils is sometimes seen as a dilution of representative democracy.

An increase in the range of services offered by councils, but only minor cost savings of less than 10% have been noted by academics as outcomes after mergers. The council mergers have resulted in widespread job losses and lingering resentment from some whose roles have experienced a larger workload.

The growth of the Regional Organisations of Councils has also been a factor in local government reform in Australia. In 1995, there were 50 such agreements across the country. A 2002 study identified 55 ROCs with the largest involving 18 councils.

==Constitutional position==
Local government powers are determined by state governments, and states have primary responsibility for funding and exclusive responsibility for supervision of local councils.

Local government is mentioned in the annotated Australian constitution, as a department of the State Governments, and they are mentioned in the constitutions of each of the six states.

Under the Constitution, the federal government cannot provide funding directly to local governments; a 1974 referendum sought to amend the Constitution to authorise the federal government to directly fund local governments, but it was defeated.

A 1988 referendum sought to explicitly insert mention of local government in the federal constitution but this was comprehensively defeated. A further referendum was proposed in 2013, but was cancelled due to the change in the election date.

Federal government interaction with local councils happens regularly through the provision of federal grants to help fund local government managed projects.

===State/territory control===

Local government in Australia has very limited legislative powers and no judicial powers, and executive-wise is subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state/territory it belongs to. The functions and practices of local councils are mostly centered around managing public services and land uses at the community level, and are similar throughout Australia, but can vary to some degree between jurisdictions. State departments oversee the activities of local councils and may intervene in their affairs when needed, subject to relevant legislation.

For more details in each state and territory, see the following:

* Local government areas of New South Wales
* Local government areas of the Northern Territory
* Local government in Queensland and Local government areas of Queensland (list)
* Local government areas of South Australia
* Local government areas of Tasmania
* Local government in Victoria and Local government areas of Victoria (list)
* Local government areas of Western Australia

The Australian Capital Territory is not divided into local government areas, so it is regarded as a single &quot;unincorporated&quot; local government area during censusing.

==Unincorporated areas==
Unlike many other countries, Australia has only one level of local government immediately beneath state and territorial governments. Aside from very sparsely populated areas and a few other special cases, almost all of Australia is part of a local government area. Unincorporated areas are often in remote locations, cover vast areas, or have very small populations.

Queensland and Tasmania are entirely partitioned into LGAs and have no unincorporated areas.

===Australian Capital Territory===
The Australian Capital Territory (ACT) has no municipalities. The ACT government is responsible for both state-level and local-level matters. In some countries, such an arrangement would be referred to as a unitary authority, but the Australian Bureau of Statistics refers to the whole of the ACT as an unincorporated area.

The ACT Government directorate Transport Canberra &amp; City Services handles responsibilities that are under the purview of local government in other parts of Australia, such as local road maintenance, libraries and waste collection.

Many Canberra districts have community organisations called &quot;community councils&quot;, but these are not part of the government (though they generally receive government funding). They do not have the power to change laws or policies, and their role is limited to advising government. They are effectively residents&#x27; associations.

===New South Wales===
New South Wales has three unincorporated areas:

* Lord Howe Island is managed by the Lord Howe Island Board, a State Government agency.
* The Unincorporated Far West Region covers the western third of the state (other than the City of Broken Hill). This area is sparsely populated. Local government functions in this area are managed directly by the state government and its agencies.
* The Sydney Harbour Area, managed by the State Government.

===Northern Territory===
In the Northern Territory, 1.47% of the total area and 3.0% of the population are in unincorporated areas. These include the Cox-Daly and Marrakai-Douglas Daly areas in the Top End region, the Northern Territory Rates Act Area and Darwin Waterfront Precinct within Darwin, Nhulunbuy on the Gove Peninsula, Alyangula on Groote Eylandt, and Yulara in Central Australia.

===South Australia===
In South Australia, 63% of the state&#x27;s area is unincorporated. Residents in this area – less than 0.2% of the state&#x27;s population – receive municipal services provided by a state agency, the Outback Communities Authority.

===Victoria===

Victoria has a number of unincorporated areas which are not part of any LGA:

* French Island is an unincorporated area, as are two nearby privately owned islands, Elizabeth Island and Sandstone Island. Most services that would normally be provided by a council, such as waste collection and recreation facilities, are absent from these islands. On French Island, maintenance of roads and roadsides is carried out by Forest Fire Management Victoria, while the Bass Coast Shire is responsible for food safety of commercial premises. The Victorian Government maintains planning powers over all three islands.
* Victoria&#x27;s six alpine resorts – Falls Creek Alpine Resort, Lake Mountain Alpine Resort, Mount Baw Baw Alpine Resort, Mount Buller Alpine Resort, Mount Hotham Alpine Resort, and Mount Stirling Alpine Resort – are managed and serviced by Alpine Resorts Victoria, a State Government-appointed board.
* Gabo Island is treated as an unincorporated area by the Victorian Government for the purposes of formally designating bushfire prone areas.
* The Australian Bureau of Statistics includes numerous other uninhabited offshore islands, including Lady Julia Percy Island, in its definition of unincorporated areas of Victoria.

===Western Australia===
Western Australia has two unincorporated areas:

* Abrolhos Islands, which are officially uninhabited and controlled by the WA Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development.
* Kings Park in central Perth, which is administered by the Botanic Gardens and Parks Authority.

<text>Vincent &quot;Vince&quot; Edward Matthews (born December 16, 1947) is an American former sprinter, winner of two Olympic gold medals, at the 1968 Summer Olympics and 1972 Summer Olympics.

==Career==
Matthews was one of the best African American long sprinters to appear in the mid-1960s, and developed a fierce rivalry with future Olympic champion Lee Evans. The pair first met in their teens, and then duelled several times in 1967, with Evans coming out on top in the AAU Championships and Pan American Games.

At the warm-up meet two weeks before the Olympic Trials in 1968, Matthews set the new world record 44.4 s in 400 m, but his time was rejected as a world record due to his use of PUMA&#x27;s illegal &quot;brush spikes&quot;. At the Trials themselves, he was then beaten out of the top three by Evans, Larry James and Ron Freeman.

At the 1968 Olympic Games in Mexico City, Matthews ran the first leg on the United States gold medal-winning 4 × 400 m relay team that set the world record of 2:56.16, which lasted for 20 years.

===1972 Olympics===
After Mexico, Matthews gave up track and field for a year as he struggled with the demands of work and marriage, but worked his way back to full fitness and into contention for the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich. At the 400m Olympic Trials, Matthews finished third behind John Smith and Wayne Collett, beating old rival Lee Evans into fourth. In the Olympic final, Smith took the early lead but dropped out due to a hamstring injury after 80 meters. The race turned into a battle between Matthews and Collett, with Matthews winning in 44.66 s and Collett coming second in 44.80 s.

The triumph was tarnished by the events during the medal ceremony, where they were talking to each other and fidgeting while the US national anthem played, leading many to believe it was a Black Power protest like that of Tommie Smith and John Carlos in 1968.

The Associated Press noted that the casual behavior of Matthews and Collett during the playing of the anthem was &quot;disrespectful,&quot; and described the conduct as follows:

Collett, bare-footed, leaped from the No. 2 tier to the No. 1 stand beside his teammate. They stood sideways to the flag, twirling their medals, with Matthews stroking his chin. Their shoulders slumped, neither stood erect nor looked at the flag. ... As whistles and catcalls continued, Collett raised a clenched fist to the crowd before entering the portal of the dressing room.

Robert Markus reported in the Chicago Tribune on September 9, 1972

[Matthews] was angry at Coach Bill Bowerman-as most of the U.S. trackmen seem to be-because Bowerman had hinted he would like to remove him from the place he had earned in the 400-meter field. He was angry that he had been forced to train on his own in unsuitable facilities, had to travel 4 or 5 times from N.Y. to the west coast in order to get any kind of competition, and had been put down by some of the press as a drag on America&#x27;s hopes for a 400-meter sweep.

The Chicago Tribune reported

Matthews said his and Collett&#x27;s actions were directed at the U.S. coaching staff, not the flag or the National Anthem. &quot;We were just mad about a lot of things. We didn&#x27;t think it would blow up like this. We were asked to apologize. I&#x27;m not really sorry for what I did. I&#x27;m sorry for the way people took it [hoots and whistles from the stands when the anthem finished]. What I tried to get across to the Olympic Committee was if it was pre-meditated I could have done something better than that. It was just something that happened. We didn&#x27;t realize the implications to the people in the stands.

However, in an interview after the medal ceremony with the American Broadcasting Company, Collett said the national anthem meant nothing to him. He explained that he had felt unable to honor the anthem because of the struggle faced by African Americans at the time: &quot;I couldn&#x27;t stand there and sing the words because I don&#x27;t believe they&#x27;re true. I wish they were. I believe we have the potential to have a beautiful country, but I don&#x27;t think we do.&quot;

The two were banned from future Olympic competition by the IOC. Since John Smith had pulled a hamstring 80 meters into the 400 m final while leading and had been ruled unfit to run, the USA were missing three runners and were unable to field a team in the 4 × 400 m relay and were forced to scratch from the event.

On the March 1973 cover of &quot;Track and Field News&quot; Matthews and Collett are pictured from the award stand promoting an article &quot;All Gold Does Not Glitter.&quot;

==Personal life==
Matthews is also an artist - burning images onto wood panels - with works on display with the Art of the Olympians.

<text>John Hardcastle Dalton Madin (23 March 1924 – 8 January 2012) was an English architect. His company, known as John H D Madin &amp; Partners from 1962 and the John Madin Design Group from 1968, was active in Birmingham for over 30 years.

==Biography==
Madin was born in Moseley, Birmingham, on 23 March 1924. He served in Egypt with the Royal Engineers in World War II.

Madin was a significant figure of post-war Birmingham architecture. Madin&#x27;s work has been much neglected and was not highly regarded by the early-21st century political leadership within Birmingham. Clive Dutton, the city&#x27;s former Director of Planning and Regeneration, described Madin&#x27;s Central Library as a &quot;concrete monstrosity&quot; (Madin&#x27;s original plans were for the building to be clad in marble; the city, however, was unwilling to foot the bill so a concrete finish was used instead). A replacement, the Library of Birmingham, was opened on 3 September 2013 in Centenary Square, which resulted in the previous building being demolished, starting in early 2015.

John Madin Design Group was also responsible for the early designs for Dawley New Town, which later became Telford. During the 1970s, Madin became increasingly involved in master-planning projects in the Middle East.

Societies such as the 20th Century Society campaigned to have some of his buildings listed and English Heritage twice recommended the former Library should be listed, but this attempt was unsuccessful. The two Madin designed buildings to gain listed status are Juniper Hill in Lapworth, Warwickshire, a residential property designed and built between 1957 and 1959 and designated at Grade II on 29 October 2013; and St James&#x27;s House, Frederick Road, Edgbaston, Birmingham, erected in 1954–1957 and one of a group of postwar office buildings designated by English Heritage in January 2015.

Madin died in hospital in Southampton on 8 January 2012.

<text>Valerie Olukemi A &quot;Kemi&quot; Olusanya (13 October 1963 – 25 April 1999), commonly known by her stage name Kemistry, was a leading English drum and bass DJ of the early 1990s, half of duo Kemistry &amp; Storm, and co-founder of the Metalheadz record label.

==Career==
Born in Birmingham, Olusanya grew up in Kettering, Northamptonshire, and began a career as a make-up artist before giving it up for DJing in the early 1990s. She was half of the DJ and recording duo Kemistry &amp; Storm, which she formed with an old friend when they both lived in London. They both started out playing on pirate radio stations Touchdown and Defection FM. With Goldie, they formed the Metalheadz record label. After two and a half years at the label, they moved on to concentrate on DJing and also released a widely distributed mix album, &quot;DJ-Kicks: Kemistry &amp; Storm&quot;, which has been described as &quot;paving the way for other, younger, female DJs&quot;.

The track &quot;Kemistry&quot; by Goldie, originally released in 1992 when they were in a relationship together, and also featured on his 1995 album &quot;Timeless&quot;, is dedicated to her.

==Death==
At 2:30 am on 25 April 1999, Olusanya was a front-seat passenger in a car travelling on the M3 motorway in Hampshire, behind a van which dislodged a cat&#x27;s eye in the road. The metal body flew through the windscreen and hit Olusanya in the face, killing her instantly. The coroner recorded a verdict of accidental death.

<text>Maia () is a municipality in the Porto Metropolitan Area, &quot;Grande Porto&quot; subregion, in Norte Region, Portugal. It is located 11 km north of central Porto. The population in 2011 was 135,306, in an area of . There is one city (Cidade da Maia) and three towns (Moreira, Castêlo da Maia and Águas Santas) in the municipality.

==History==
The area of the current municipality (&quot;concelho&quot;) has been inhabited for millennia, with human occupation dating back to the Paleolithic period. In the many hills of the region, remains of villages from the Iron Age have been found. Attracted by the rich soil and abundance of resources, the Romans also left visible marks of their occupation in the area. In the middle of the thirteenth century, the Lands of Maia (&quot;Terras da Maia&quot;) extended from the city of Porto to the Ave river and from the sea to the mountains. In 1304 the Lands of Maia were incorporated into those of Porto, losing its political and administrative autonomy. In 1360, King Pedro I of Portugal gave the land of Azurara (current Vila do Conde), with land in Maia, to the then infant Denis, Lord of Cifuentes, his son. The history of this municipality is also closely linked to the founding of the Portuguese nation. Some authors argue that even the Prince Afonso Henriques had been educated here, next to the family of Mendes da Maia, who belonged to the Arcebishop of Braga D. Paio Mendes and the famous warrior Gonçalo Mendes da Maia, the &quot;Lidador&quot; (today the hero of the city), named so for having entered into fearless struggle against the Saracens. In the Age of Discovery, the region of Maia produced sails and fabrics for use in the Portuguese caravels. At the beginning of the sixteenth century, the King Manuel I of Portugal granted the charter, which provided the rent to be paid to the donee Reguengos of Maia, and regulated how to carry out punishments and courts. Between 1700 and 1836, the county was composed of 44 parishes and encompassed the entire range between the sea and the Leça and Ave rivers. 
With administrative reforms initiated in 1836, Maia became a separate municipality, but reduced both in area and number of parishes. In 1857, the municipality of Maia was no more, it was then restored in 1868. Maia municipality was crossed in 1809 by the Napoleonic army of the Duke of Dalmatia, the Marshal Soult, which was going from Braga to Porto. Between 1832 and 1834, in the turbulent years of struggles and civil war opposing Miguel of Portugal to Pedro IV of Portugal, it was the scene of bloody battles between the absolutist and the liberal factions.

Other industries include textiles, chemicals, mechanical equipment and food products (e.g. Ferbar - Fernando Barros Productos Alimentares, Lda., a major Portuguese wholesaler of food products). Sonae SGPS, owner of one of the largest hypermarket chains and the largest private employer in Portugal, is also headquartered in Maia. CEIIA - Centro para a Excelência e Inovação na Indústria Automóvel (auto industry innovation center), is located in TECMAIA (Parque de Ciência e Tecnologia da Maia complex), a science park situated in the Maia Industrial Zone. Prozis, a Portuguese multinational sports nutrition company, has a major research and development center in Maia.

<text>A forwarding equivalence class (FEC) is a term used in Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) to describe a set of packets with similar or identical characteristics which may be forwarded the same way; that is, they may be bound to the same MPLS label.

Characteristics determining the FEC of a higher-layer packet depend on the configuration of the router, but typically this is at least the destination IP address. Quality of service class is also often used. Thus, a forward equivalence class tends to correspond to a label-switched path (LSP). The reverse is not true, however: an LSP may be (and usually is) used for multiple FECs.

<text>Not Only... But Also is a BBC British sketch comedy show starring Peter Cook and Dudley Moore that aired in three series between 1965 and 1970.

==History==
The show was originally intended as a solo project for Moore, called &quot;Not Only Dudley Moore, But Also His Guests&quot;. However, unsure about going it alone, Moore invited his partner from &quot;Beyond the Fringe&quot;, Peter Cook, to guest in the pilot (along with Diahann Carroll and John Lennon, who was to make two more appearances during the course of the series). So well received by the studio audience was their double act, in particular the first &quot;Dagenham Dialogue&quot;, &quot;A Spot of the Usual Trouble&quot;, that Cook was invited to become a permanent fixture and the show became &quot;Not Only Peter Cook and Dudley Moore, But Also Their Guests&quot;, though it was only ever really referred to as &quot;Not Only... But Also...&quot;. This somewhat cumbersome title was later referred to by Cook in an interview as &quot;another of Dudley&#x27;s plodding ideas&quot;.

Three series were made: the first, airing from January to April 1965 (produced and directed by Joe McGrath); the second, from January to February 1966 (produced and directed by Dick Clement); and the third, from February to May 1970 (produced and directed by Jimmy Gilbert). John Street produced the (surviving) 1966 Boxing Day Special.

The opening titles for series one often featured Moore playing the series&#x27; theme (later released on the B-side of the 1965 &quot;Goodbyee&quot; single release) in a variety of unusual locations, such as in a car wash, on a violin at a Gypsy cafe, and as a one-man band. From series two onwards, episodes usually began with a sketch based primarily around revealing the words &quot;NOT ONLY... BUT ALSO...&quot; in huge letters placed in obscure places (for example, the aircraft carrier &quot;Ark Royal&quot;). Every edition except (possibly) the pilot concluded with a performance of arguably Moore&#x27;s best known composition, &quot;Goodbyee&quot;, sometimes involving the guest star of that particular episode. Examples include Cilla Black crying &quot;Oh, kiss me, Peter!&quot; during the song&#x27;s intro in series two episode one, and Peter Sellers accompanying the duo on timpani in series one episode six.

Among the best known features of the show were the &quot;Dagenham Dialogues&quot; between Pete and Dud, which were rambling, surreal conversations running often for over ten minutes and regular appearances by Cook&#x27;s oblivious upperclass gent, Sir Arthur Streeb-Greebling. Other well-known sketches include the &quot;Facts of Life&quot; sketch (&quot;A Bit of a Chat&quot;), &quot;The Leaping Nuns of the Order of St Beryl&quot;, &quot;Superthunderstingcar&quot; (a parody of &quot;Thunderbirds&quot; and other Sylvia and Gerry Anderson puppet shows), and the &quot;rhythmic voodoo&quot; R&amp;B singer Bo Dudley – though the fame of these almost certainly owes much to the fact they still exist in vision, unlike much of the series.

Contrary to popular myth, the Cook perennial &quot;One Leg Too Few&quot;, a classic sketch about a one-legged actor applying for the role of Tarzan, which had been written by Cook when he was 18 years old and used in &quot;Beyond the Fringe&quot;, never appeared on the BBC &quot;Not Only... But Also...&quot;, although it did feature in one of the Australian shows in 1971. 

The series – in particular the &quot;Pete and Dud&quot; segments – allowed Cook the chance to adlib and both, but most famously Moore, were often reduced to helpless laughter, or &quot;corpsing&quot;. Cook made a habit of trying to crack Moore up in the middle of their dialogues, occasionally forcing himself to corpse in the process.

Between the second and third series, the two men made a series for ATV called &quot;Goodbye Again&quot; (director Shaun Riordan), which was very similar up to the point of using the same music and reusing some sketches like &quot;Alan-a-Dale&quot;. Shows lasted an hour and were edited more heavily. Unlike those of &quot;Not Only ... But Also...&quot;, all the tapes survive, although only in black and white. The show was originally recorded in colour (some sketches prerecorded on film still exist in colour).

The BBC wiped most editions of &quot;Not Only... But Also...&quot; in the late 1960s and early 1970s, as it did with many other programmes in this era. Cook and Moore even offered to pay for the cost of preservation and buy new videotapes so that the old tapes would not need to be reused, but this offer was rejected. Some telerecordings of the black and white episodes survive, but as the completed videotapes of the colour series were wiped, the only surviving colour sketches are the 16mm film inserts. In 2010 it was announced that off-air audio recordings for at least part of all the episodes had been recovered, and that there were plans to make them available, although this has yet to happen. A 2016 documentary by Victor Lewis-Smith, &quot;The Undiscovered Peter Cook&quot;, featured first series extracts from &quot;Sir Arthur at the Tailor&quot;, long known to exist, and the final minute and 25 seconds of &quot;Pete and Dud on the Bus&quot;, being reconstituted from film footage newly recovered from the Australian Broadcasting Corporation trailer department. &quot;Peter Cook and Dudley Moore: The Missing Sketches&quot;, transmitted on New Year&#x27;s Day 2017, included further ABC trailer extracts from &#x27;Pete and Dud - Diseases&#x27; and &#x27;Pete and Dud – Sex&#x27;. One remaining recovered clip, lasting one minute and 25 seconds, of &#x27;Pete and Dud – Music&#x27; remains unscreened to date.

A 1971 visit to Australia for the live show &quot;Behind the Fridge&quot; (the name was a pun on &quot;Beyond the Fringe&quot;) saw Cook and Moore record two half-hour &quot;Not Only... But Also...&quot; specials for Australian television. These two episodes also survive intact, as do specially filmed performances of the &quot;Behind the Fridge&quot; live show from Australia and London, the latter in colour. The Australian performance has been available on DVD. Although they have since been viewed as &quot;best-of&quot;s (featuring new versions of &quot;One Leg Too Few&quot;, &quot;Shirt Shop&quot; and &quot;Pseudolene/Job Offer&quot;), at least half of the material was new.

A number of surviving sequences were compiled into &quot;The Best of Not Only...But Also&quot;, screened by BBC2 on 24 December 1974. Cook and Moore persuaded the BBC (in part thanks to a pleading letter from Cook&#x27;s elderly mother) to piece together six half-hour compilation shows, screened on BBC2 from 4 November to 9 December 1990 as &quot;The Best of What&#x27;s Left of Not Only... But Also...&quot; and released in 100-minute compilation form under the same title on VHS. In 2003 a 98-minute Region 2 DVD compilation of surviving sketches was released as &quot;The Best of Peter Cook &amp; Dudley Moore&quot;; this is the same as the previous video tape but missing the third series&#x27; opening sequence, &quot;Tower Bridge&quot;. At least one sketch substitution appears to have occurred between domestic and international versions of the compilation shows, the latter of which included &quot;The Walrus and the Carpenter&quot; (a filmed recreation of the Lewis Carroll poem which survives from the largely missing sixth episode of series two) instead of &quot;The Ravens&quot;. Neither DVD includes this sequence. &quot;Initials&quot;, or &quot;Old J.J.&quot;, an old piece of Cook&#x27;s recorded for the NOBA pilot in November 1964 and screened in January 1965 in the first episode of the series proper, was included in a mid-1990s VHS compilation of 1960s BBC comedy extracts.

A Region 1 DVD of &quot;The Best of... What&#x27;s Left of... Not Only... But Also...&quot; was released by BBC Worldwide on 9 September 2008, featuring all six compilation episodes. This still leaves over half the extant material unreleased in any form.

===Christmas special: TX 26 December 1966===
The 1966 Christmas Special survives in a slightly abridged copy: it was transmitted in a 50-minute slot, but the circulating print (and that held by the BBC) is four minutes shorter. Reference to the studio shooting script reveals the excised material to be a section of &quot;The Fairy Cobbler&quot; as well as an entire filmed sketch referred to as &quot;Golf Quickie&quot;. 
&quot;(John Lennon)&quot;
&quot;Fox Hunt Opening/Fairy Cobbler/Pete and Dud – The Unexplained/Swinging London (Lionel Bloab – Destructive Artist, Rev. Gavin Thistle, Penny Ryder, Simon Accrington, &quot;The L.S. Bumblebee&quot;, The Ad Lav Club)&quot;
Music: Marion Montgomery (&quot;I&#x27;ll Be Tired of You&quot;, &quot;I’m Old Fashioned&quot;), Dudley Moore Trio

* The 15-minute &quot;Swinging London&quot; segment was partly filmed in Soho in November 1966. Purporting to be an episode of &quot;The Pipesucker Report&quot;, with Cook playing investigative reporter Hiram J. Pipesucker, the sketch satirises the American media&#x27;s coverage of the Swinging London phenomenon. Cook and Moore poke fun at London&#x27;s burgeoning creative scenes, such as performance art, fashion modelling and pop music. As Simon Accrington, Moore plays the manager of a pop group that have become devotees of Chinese banjo player Ravi Oli (a send-up of The Beatles guitarist George Harrison travelling to India to study the sitar with Indian classical musician Ravi Shankar). The band, with Cook and Moore as vocalists, are shown recording a new single, &quot;The L.S. Bumblebee&quot; – the lyrics and exotic musical effects of which parody the Beatles&#x27; recent experimental song &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot;. At the end of the sketch, Pipesucker attempts to gain entry into the Ad Lav Club, which he describes as &quot;London&#x27;s most fashionable lavatory spot ... [where] film stars rub shoulders with royalty&quot;. In a parody of the exclusive door policy at London&#x27;s Ad Lib nightclub, the doorman (played by John Lennon) grants Pipesucker access only when the reporter persuades him that he is the Duke and Duchess of Windsor.

=== Off-air audio ===
Audio recordings for all of the lost episodes of the series exist, thanks to off-air audio recordings made by viewers at the time of transmission. Some of these audio recordings are more complete than others. Very few of them are completely unedited. This means that although we have an audio recording for every episode, some parts of some of those episodes still remain lost. A complete collection of these recordings is housed in the National Sound Archive at the British Library in London.

Further off-air recordings have since also been recovered, mostly from Australia; though some of the recordings are abridged. A confirmed list of these Australian findings (including some material not held at the British Library) include:

*Series 1, Show 7: TX 3 April 1965 (feat Eric Sykes): The Grand Order of the Bull/Pete and Dud – Religions/Making of a B-Movie/Outro and Goodbyee (partial)

==The Best Of What&#x27;s Left Of Not Only... But Also...==
In 1990 much of the surviving material was compiled into 6 30-minute episodes under the name The Best Of What&#x27;s Left Of Not Only... But Also...
A VHS release of the same name, though containing somewhat different material, including a new Pete and Dud dialogue, was released at the same time.

==Other media==
Four compilation albums were released by Decca Records to accompany the series, taken from the original television recordings:
* &quot;Not Only Peter Cook... But Also Dudley Moore&quot; (1965) - sketches include &quot;The Ravens&quot;, &quot;Superstitions&quot;, &quot;Tramponuns&quot;, &quot;Art Gallery&quot;, &quot;Initials&quot;, &quot;Religions&quot;
* &quot;Once Moore with Cook&quot; (1966) - sketches include &quot;Dud and Pete on Sex&quot;, &quot;Father and Son&quot;, &quot;The Frog and Peach&quot;, &quot;Six of the Best&quot;, &quot;The Music Teacher&quot;, &quot;A Bit of a Chat&quot;, &quot;Dud and Pete at the Zoo&quot;, &quot;The Psychiatrist&quot;
* &quot;Not Only But Also&quot; (1971) - sketches include &quot;Dud&#x27;s Dreams&quot; [sic], &quot;In the Club&quot;, &quot;Lengths&quot;, &quot;This is Ludwig Van Beethoven&quot;, &quot;The Making of a Movie&quot;, &quot;0-0 Dud&quot;
* &quot;The World of Pete &amp; Dud&quot; (1974) - sketches include &quot;Art Gallery&quot;, &quot;A Bit of a Chat&quot;, &quot;Lengths&quot;, &quot;The Psychiatrist&quot;, &quot;Dud Dreams&quot;, &quot;The Ravens&quot;, &quot;Father and Son&quot;, &quot;Six of the Best&quot;

The scripts of 12 of the 29 &quot;Dagenham Dialogues&quot; (most, but not all, from &quot;Not Only ... But Also...&quot;) were published in a book of that title by Methuen in 1971 (reissued 1988).

<doc id="761212" wikidata="Q1354212" url="?curid=761212" title="Ralph Steadman">
<text>Ralph Idris Steadman (born 15 May 1936) is a British illustrator best known for his collaboration with the American writer Hunter S. Thompson. Steadman is renowned for his satirical political cartoons, social caricatures, and picture books.

==Early life==
Steadman was born in Wallasey, Cheshire to an English father, Lionel Raphael Steadman, and a Welsh mother, Gwendoline; the family moved to Wales towards the end of the Second World War. Steadman attended the Grammar School in Abergele in north Wales but hated the draconian, sadistic new headmaster and left aged 16. &quot;I couldn&#x27;t wait to get out,&quot; he said. He came from a lower middle class background; his father was a commercial traveller and his mother was a shop assistant at T J Hughes in Liverpool. 

Steadman took his first job at 16 as a RADAR Operator at the De Havilland aircraft factory in the border town of Broughton near Chester but only remained for nine months, finding factory life repetitive and dull, and becoming fed up with fellow employees, citing persistent cruel practical jokes (&quot;They were always putting stuff in your tea&quot;); however, whilst there he became skilled in technical drawing, thus sowing the seeds of his future career. 

Steadman returned to England after National Service in 1954 and found work in London as a cartoonist. Wishing to accelerate his progress he enrolled in 1959 at East Ham Technical College and the London College of Printing during the 1960s, doing freelance work for &quot;Punch&quot;, &quot;Private Eye&quot;, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; during this time.

==Career==
===Collaborations with Hunter S. Thompson===
Steadman had a long partnership with the American journalist Hunter S. Thompson, drawing pictures for several of his articles and books. He accompanied Thompson to the Kentucky Derby for an article for the magazine &quot;Scanlan&#x27;s&quot;, to the Honolulu Marathon for the magazine &quot;Running&quot;, and illustrated both &quot;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas&quot; and &quot;Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail &#x27;72.&quot;

Steadman has expressed regret at selling the original illustrations for &quot;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas&quot; at the advice of his agent to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; founder Jann Wenner for the sum of $75, a fraction of their later value. As a result of that transaction Steadman has largely refused to sell any of his original artwork and has been quoted as saying &quot;If anyone owns a Steadman original, it&#x27;s stolen.&quot; While there are original pieces held outside of his archive, they are exceedingly rare. The artist has kept possession of the vast bulk of his original artwork.

Steadman appears on the second disc of The Criterion Collection &quot;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas&quot; DVD set, in a documentary called &quot;Fear and Loathing in Gonzovision&quot;, which was made by the BBC in 1978, of Thompson planning the tower and cannon that his ashes were later blasted out of. The cannon was atop a 153-ft. tower of Thompson&#x27;s fist gripping a peyote button; Thompson demands that Steadman gives the fist two thumbs, &quot;Right now.&quot;

===Other illustration work===
As well as writing and illustrating his own books and Thompson&#x27;s, Steadman has worked with writers including Ted Hughes, Adrian Mitchell and Brian Patten, and also illustrated editions of &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;, &quot;Treasure Island&quot;, &quot;Animal Farm&quot;, the English translation of Flann O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s Gaelic-language classic &quot;The Poor Mouth&quot;, and most recently, &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot;.

Steadman has drawn album covers for numerous music artists, including the Who, Exodus, Frank Zappa and Ambrosia, and the lead banner for the gonzo journalism website GonzoToday.com.

Among the British public, Steadman is well known for his illustrations for the catalogues of the off-licence chain Oddbins.

In 1985, Steadman designed a set of four British postage stamps to commemorate the appearance that year of Halley&#x27;s Comet.

Steadman has illustrated Will Self&#x27;s column in &quot;The Independent&quot; newspaper.

Steadman has contributed to the BirdLife International&#x27;s Preventing Extinctions programme with an image of critically endangered northern bald ibis.

In 2014, Steadman created the artwork for a series of limited edition Breaking Bad SteelBook DVDs. These works were the subject of an exhibition at 71a Gallery in Hackney, London in February 2015.

In 2016 Steadman did the cover art for Anthony Bourdain&#x27;s &quot;&quot;.

In 2017, Steadman penned the artwork for Travis Scott and Quavo&#x27;s joint project &quot;Huncho Jack, Jack Huncho&quot;.

In 2019, Steadman created the artwork for Taylor Mac&#x27;s Broadway show &quot;&quot;.

In 2020, Steadman created the artwork for the documentary film &quot;Freak Power: The Ballot or the Bomb&quot; which follows journalist Hunter S. Thompson and his 1970 campaign for sheriff of Pitkin County, Colorado.

===Beer labels and freedom of speech===
Steadman has designed label art for Flying Dog beer and designed the V logo used on Flying Dog&#x27;s packaging since 1995. The Logo includes an original motto by Steadman: &quot;Good Beer No Shit&quot;. Because of this, and because of Steadman&#x27;s controversial label art for the craft brewery&#x27;s Road Dog ale and Doggie Style ale, a complaint of obscenity was filed against Flying Dog. The Colorado State Liquor Board then had Flying Dog beers pulled from store shelves. Flying Dog and the American Civil Liberties Union sued the state of Colorado while the displayed motto was changed to &quot;Good Beer No Censorship.&quot; In 2001, the Colorado Supreme Court entered final judgment in favor of Flying Dog, based on the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, (freedom of speech).

In 2009, the Michigan Liquor Control Commission banned Flying Dog&#x27;s &quot;Raging Bitch Belgian-Style IPA&quot; beer, partly for the name and partly for Steadman&#x27;s label art. In 2015, the 6th Circuit Federal Court of Appeals struck down the ban on first amendment grounds and recommended civil damages against the state of Michigan.

In an article since deleted from its website, Flying Dog stated that its Cardinal &quot;Spiced&quot; Zin&#x27; wine was banned in Ohio for Steadman&#x27;s &quot;disturbing&quot; interpretation of a Catholic cardinal on its label.

In 2018, Flying Dog received a complaint in the UK about the packaging of its &quot;Easy IPA&quot; reduced-alcohol beer. The complaint partially involved Steadman&#x27;s label art, depicting a tipsy cartoon character. The Portman Group, a third-party organization which evaluates alcohol-related marketing in the UK, has accepted the complaint&#x27;s allegation that the artwork &quot;could be seen as encouraging drunkenness&quot;, particularly among minors, and has issued an advisory.

In 2021, Flying Dog sued the North Carolina Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission for violation of free speech provisions after the NC ABC rejected the label for the brewery&#x27;s &quot;Freezin&#x27; Season&quot; beer as &quot;inappropriate&quot;.

===Music and writing===
In 1980, Steadman wrote a 57-second song &quot;Sweetest Love (Lament after a Broken Sashcord on a Theme by John Donne)&quot; for an album he was illustrating, &quot;Miniatures: A Sequence of Fifty-One Tiny Masterpieces&quot; (edited by Morgan Fisher), on Pipe Records. Steadman sang the song to Fisher&#x27;s harmonium accompaniment.

In 1999, Steadman wrote the lyrics for Richard Harvey&#x27;s choral album &quot;Plague and the Moonflower&quot;, on Altus Records.

Also in 1999, Steadman released an anthology album of his &quot;favourite music&quot;, on EMI Records, entitled &quot;I Like It&quot;. Two pieces of his own music are included, &quot;Weird &amp; Twisted Nights&quot; (listed as a collaboration with Hunter S. Thompson and someone named Mc Dean) and &quot;Sweetest Love I Do Not Go&quot; (the same 57-second piece he released in 1980). The album comes with a &quot;songbook&quot;, which has text by Steadman.

Hal Willner and Johnny Depp&#x27;s 2006 anthology of songs, &quot;Rogue&#x27;s Gallery: Pirate Ballads, Sea Songs, and Chanteys&quot; contains two contributions from Steadman. He sings lead on &quot;Little Boy Billee&quot; and sings backing vocals for Eliza Carthy on &quot;Rolling Sea&quot;.

In 2011, Steadman began running prose and poetry in &quot;Kotori Magazine&quot;.

In 2015, Steadman released a 7-inch vinyl single on Philthy Phonograph Records, &quot;The Man Who Woke Up in the Dark&quot; B/w &quot;Striped Paint&quot;.

In 2020, Chronicle Chroma published the definitive book on Steadman&#x27;s work and career, &quot;A Life in Ink&quot; by Ralph Steadman. 

==Awards==
Awards that he has won for his work include the Francis Williams Book Illustration Award for &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;, the American Society of Illustrators&#x27; Certificate of Merit, the W H Smith Illustration Award for &quot;I Leonardo&quot;, the Dutch Silver Paintbrush Award for &quot;Inspector Mouse&quot;, the Italian Critica in Erba Prize for &quot;That&#x27;s My Dad&quot;, the BBC Design Award for postage stamps, the Black Humour Award in France, and several Designers and Art Directors Association Awards. He was voted Illustrator of the Year by the American Institute of Graphic Arts in 1979.

===Film documentary===
A major documentary about Steadman&#x27;s career, &quot;For No Good Reason&quot;, directed by Charlie Paul, played at the 2013 Toronto International Film Festival in the &quot;Mavericks&quot; programme. The film, reportedly 15 years in the making, played in New York City and Los Angeles in December 2013, and was given US domestic release in spring 2014. The film was in competition for the Grierson Award for Best Documentary at the 2012 BFI London Film Festival.

==Personal life==
Steadman is a member of the Chelsea Arts Club.

He is a patron of the Association of Illustrators.

Steadman lives in Kent. His second wife, Anna, died in February 2022. He has five children.

<text>Friedrich Adolf Graf von Kalckreuth (22 February 1737 – 10 June 1818) was a Prussian Generalfeldmarschall.

Kalkreuth was born in Sotterhausen near Sangerhausen. He entered the regiment of Gardes du Corps in 1752, and in 1758 was adjutant or &quot;aide de camp&quot; to Frederick the Great&#x27;s brother, Prince Henry, with whom he served throughout the later stages of the Seven Years&#x27; War. He won special distinction at the battle of Freiberg (29 September 1762), for which Frederick promoted him major.

Personal differences with Prince Henry severed their connection in 1766, and for many years Kalckreuth lived in comparative retirement. He participated in the War of the Bavarian Succession as a colonel, and on the accession of Frederick William II was restored to favour. He greatly distinguished himself as a major-general in the invasion of the Netherlands in 1787, and by 1792 had become count and lieutenant-general. Under the Duke of Brunswick, he took a conspicuous part in the campaign of Valmy in 1792, the siege of Mainz in 1793, and the Battle of Kaiserslautern in 1794.

Kalckreuth was defeated in the 1806 Battle of Auerstedt. In 1807 he defended Danzig for 78 days against the French under Marshal Lefebvre, with far greater skill and energy than he had shown in the previous year. He was promoted to field marshal soon afterwards, and conducted many of the negotiations at Tilsit. He died as governor of Berlin in 1818.

The &quot;Dictées du Feldmaréchal Kalckreuth&quot; were published by his son (Paris, 1844).

<doc id="761214" wikidata="Q2831921" url="?curid=761214" title="Albion W. Knight Jr.">
<text>Albion Williamson Knight Jr. (1 June 1924 – 22 May 2012) was the second Archbishop of the United Episcopal Church of North America (UECNA) from 1989 until his resignation in 1992. During his tenure, Knight more than tripled the number of parishes belonging to the church. He later helped found the Church of England (Continuing), a conservative church in England that opposes both the growth of Anglo-Catholic practices and doctrines and the more liberal religious and social stance of the Church of England.

== Personal life ==
Knight was born on June 1, 1924 in Jacksonville, Florida to Albion Williamson Knight (1891–1953) and Anna Marion née Russell (1893–1966). He was the grandson of Albion W. Knight (1859–1936), the former Bishop of Cuba in the Episcopal Church (TEC) and subsequently Bishop Coadjutor of New Jersey. 

He graduated from the U.S. Military Academy in 1945, and retired from the Army in 1973 as a Brigadier General. He earned master&#x27;s degrees from the University of Illinois and American University.

Knight died on May 22, 2012 at his home in Gaithersburg, Maryland.

== Career ==
Knight was ordained a deacon in TEC in 1964 and as a priest in 1965. He joined the UECNA in late 1983 and became the bishop of its Eastern diocese in 1984 before being elected its Archbishop in 1985. He was consecrated in Bethesda, Maryland on June 2, 1984 by Charles D. D. Doren, the first bishop in the Continuing Anglican movement and first Archbishop of the UECNA.

During his tenure, Knight sponsored the creation of a denominational seminary, reorganized the church into missionary districts, and embarked on a revision of the UECNA Constitution and Canons, which was initially voted on in 1991. The revision changed the title of the senior bishop in the UECNA to Presiding Bishop. 

He resigned in 1992 to pursue his political aspiration, and was succeeded as Presiding Bishop by John Cyrus Gramley (1931–1996). Knight was the vice-presidential candidate of the U.S. Taxpayers Party in the 1992 presidential election.

<text>Herbert William &quot;Herb&quot; Titus (October 17, 1937 – June 20, 2021) was an American attorney, writer, and political candidate. He was the Constitution Party&#x27;s nominee for Vice President during the 1996 presidential election.

==Early life==
Titus was born in Baker City, Oregon on October 17, 1937. He attended Baker public schools, where he graduated as co-valedictorian of the class of 1955. Four years later he graduated from the University of Oregon, where he had served as student body president. Titus graduated cum laude from Harvard Law School in 1962.

==Career==
Titus held a law degree from Harvard University, graduating cum laude, and a B.S. degree in political science from the University of Oregon, where he graduated Phi Beta Kappa. He was vice president of the freshman class at Oregon.

He was an active member of the Virginia Bar Association and was admitted to practice before the United States Supreme Court, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, the United States Court of Federal Claims, and the United States Courts of Appeals for the Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, Ninth, Tenth, and District of Columbia and Federal Circuits. He was also admitted to practice in the Army Court of Criminal Appeals and the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces.

After two years as a trial attorney and a Special Assistant United States Attorney with the U.S. Department of Justice, Titus worked as a professor of law from 1964 to 1979 at the state universities of Oklahoma, Colorado and Oregon. He was &quot;active in various left-wing-based political causes&quot; during this period, opposing the Vietnam War and supporting homosexual rights and abortion rights. He also worked with attorneys and clients on a number of constitutional cases in his role as a regional director with the American Civil Liberties Union.

In 1975, Titus was &quot;dramatically converted to Christ&quot; while attending a Sunday School class with his wife, after which he studied with Dr. Francis Schaeffer in Switzerland for a year.

He left his tenured position as professor of law at the University of Oregon in 1979 to become a member of the charter faculty at the O. W. Coburn School of Law at Oral Roberts University. Three years later, Titus moved to CBN University (later named Regent University), where he served for a total of eleven years, first as the founding Dean of the School of Public Policy and then as Vice-President for Academic Affairs. Starting in 1986, Titus became the founding Dean of the College of Law and Government in Regent University. All told, Titus taught constitutional law, common law, and other subjects at five different law schools for almost 30 years.

He was the author of a book entitled &quot;God, Man and Law: The Biblical Principles&quot;.

Titus was of counsel at the Virginia law firm of William J. Olson, P.C., specializing in Constitutional Law, Legislative Practice, Appellate Practice, Election and Campaign Finance, and Firearms Law.

==Politics==
Titus was the 1996 vice presidential nominee for the Constitution Party (then known as the U.S. Taxpayer&#x27;s Party) as the running mate of the party founder Howard Phillips.

Along with his client, former Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore, Titus was an original drafter of the Constitution Restoration Act, which sought to take out of federal court jurisdiction appellate cases that involved public officials who acknowledged God as the sovereign source of law, liberty, or government, and provided for the impeachment of federal judges who disregarded the act. The act did not pass either time it was introduced, but its tenets were incorporated into the 2004 Republican Party platform.

==Personal life==
Residents of Chesapeake, Virginia, Titus and his wife, Marilyn, to whom he had been married 52 years at the time of his death, had four children and 15 grandchildren.

Titus died on June 20, 2021, a practicing lawyer until his death.

<text>The PT-91 Twardy (, English: Hard) is a Polish main battle tank. A development of the T-72M1, it entered service in 1995. The PT-91 was designed at the OBRUM (&quot;Ośrodek Badawczo-Rozwojowy Urządzeń Mechanicznych&quot;, or &quot;Research and Development Centre for Mechanical Appliances&quot;) and is produced by the Bumar Łabędy company, part of the Bumar Group, a Polish technical military consortium. Changes from the T-72M include a new dual-axis stabilized fire-control system, reactive armour, a more powerful engine, transmission and new automatic loader.

Unlike many other T-72 upgrades, Polish Army PT-91s feature elements created almost exclusively by domestic companies, including the new engine, fire control system, and all communication system elements. Many of the elements were used to upgrade existing fleets of T-72 tanks in countries including the Czech Republic (T-72M4 CZ), Georgia (T-72SIM-1), and India (T-72 Ajeya Mk. 2). A total of 232 PT-91 tanks were delivered to the Polish Land Forces: 92 newly built vehicles and 140 from refurbished T-72M and T-72M1 tanks, designated PT-91MA and PT-91MA1, respectively.

==History==
In the late 1980s, the Polish Army modernized all of its obsolete T-55 tanks to the T-55AM &quot;Mérida&quot; standard. The successful conversion convinced the General Staff that similar modernization programs could be applied to other Soviet-designed tanks made in Poland and used by the Polish Armed Forces. In late 1988, the decision was made to prepare the modernization of the T-72M1, using experience gained from the production of licensed T-72M (obiekt 172M-E3 – Polish army designation T-72), T-72M1 (obiekt 172M-E5) and T-72M1K (Polish army designation T-72M1D).

The Gliwice-based OBRUM was chosen as the main design bureau. However, initially, the work progressed at a very slow pace, mainly because the Polish General Staff was also considering the purchase of a newer version of the T-72 (T-72S) or the modern T-80.

After the political upheaval of 1989 and dissolution of the Soviet bloc, Polish-Soviet talks on purchase of modern tanks came to a halt and support for designing a new Polish tank gained momentum. The first design proposed by the bureau was code-named &quot;Wilk&quot; (Polish for &quot;wolf&quot;), but the project was cancelled. Instead, priority was shifted to a different project named &quot;Twardy&quot;.

The basic aim of the T-72 conversion was to adapt it to the reality of modern warfare and fix its most visible deficiencies. Among those were low mobility, insufficient armour, lack of a fire control system and poor stabilisation of the main gun, which resulted in poor firing accuracy. An additional problem was the lack of passive night vision aiming systems.

==Development==
Starting in July 1991, T-72 modernization programs were implemented by the Bumar-Labedy factory, which had been producing T-72s under Soviet license. The modernized main battle tank was designated the PT-91 &quot;Twardy&quot;. Bumar-Labedy enhanced the tank&#x27;s armour protection, fire control system and the engine. In 1993, the Polish Defense Ministry ordered 20 PT-91 tanks, to be used for field trials and armed forces tests.

The new &quot;&quot; dynamic armour, developed by the Poland Military-Technical Institute, increased the main battle tank&#x27;s protection from high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) projectiles and missiles. The protection consisted of 394 tiles with explosives, which would detonate in case of a direct hit. The tiles cover 9 m2 of the tank: 108 are placed on the turret, 118 on the hull and 84 on each side&#x27;s anti-HEAT screens. The &quot;Twardy&quot; uses steel anti-HEAT screens instead of the rubber one used on the T-72.

The ERAWA tiles fit together almost without gaps, unlike the gaps on the modernized Soviet T-72 which measure up to 15 mm, noticeably decreasing their defensive effectiveness. There are two ERAWA modifications: &quot;ERAWA&quot;-1 and -2, differing in weight of the explosives. Experiments showed that the ERAWA dynamic defense decreases the high-explosive jet impact depth by 50–70% and that of penetrator (APFSDS) projectiles by 30–40%. Furthermore, ERAWA&#x27;s explosive containers do not detonate when hit by a shot of up to 30 mm calibre or by shell or mine fragments, or when covered in burning napalm or petrol.

The &quot;Twardy&quot; is armed with the same 2A46 125 mm smoothbore gun used in the T-72, fitted with an automatic reloading mechanism which reduces the tank crew by one, as it replaces the gun loader, and gives a rate of fire of 8 to 10 rounds per minute. Additional armament comprises the 7.62 mm PKT coaxial general-purpose machine gun and 12.7 mm NSVT anti-aircraft heavy machine gun. The PT-91 has a thermosmoke device that generates smoke screens from fuel, and has 24 grenade launchers fitted with smoke, anti-personnel fragmentation, or tear gas grenades developed specifically to provide a non-lethal protection.

The modernization of the fire control system began with replacing the older Soviet 2Є28M two-plane stabilizer with a new stabilizer developed in Slovakia. The system has an electronic information block showing the tank&#x27;s technical condition. Furthermore, it informs the commander when the sighted fire becomes ineffective from excessively high cross-country speed or other reasons.

The fire control system, developed by Polish engineers, contains the PCD gunner&#x27;s day sight and the TES thermovision night sight developed by the Israeli company El-Op, the POD-72 commander&#x27;s combined day-night passive observation and aiming sight, a ballistic computer, a laser rangefinder, and a data system processing information for the ballistic computer. The sighting of the ballistic computer depends on the target&#x27;s speed, weather conditions, projectile temperature, and projectile type.

The driver uses the US-DK-1 control and diagnostic complex to control the tank&#x27;s main systems, displaying information on a monitor. The driver&#x27;s night sight was replaced by the &quot;Radomka&quot; passive night sight.

The modernized tank&#x27;s increased weight led the developers to add a more powerful engine: a 12-cylinder S-12U diesel engine (a modernized version of the Soviet V-46-6) produced in Warsaw by PZL-Wola, generating 850 hp instead of 780. The main improvement is the modernized fuel and air injection system. This caused, however, a noticeable decrease in the tank&#x27;s road endurance. The latest &quot;Twardy&quot; variants have the 1,000 hp S-1000 engine with a turbocharger.

==Variants==
===PT-91 &quot;Twardy&quot;===
Production variant for the Polish Army, an extensively modernized development of the T-72M1. Most are equipped with an SKO-1M Drawa-1T dual-axis stabilized fire control system (with TES – Thermal Elbow Sight; the total number of delivered thermal sights is 202&lt;ref name=&quot;NTW 05/09&quot;&gt;Andrzej Kliński, Nowa Technika Wojskowa – May 2008 page 22 – Odmłodzona Drawa.&lt;/ref&gt;) though some early production vehicles have a SKO-1 Drawa (with NV sight), &quot;Erawa&quot; reactive armour, a PCO SSC-1 Obra-1 laser-warning system and 850 hp PZL-Wola S-12U engine.&lt;ref name=&quot;NTW 09/07&quot;&gt;Andrzej Kliński, Nowa Technika Wojskowa – September 2007 page 14 – Jak można zmodernizować Twardego?&lt;/ref&gt; The first 20 initial production vehicles were delivered to Polish Land Forces in 1993–1994. Another 78 full-scale production vehicles were delivered 1995–1997, 135 modernized T-72M1 tanks (made in the late 80s) were delivered between 1998 and 2002. Both new and modernized tanks have the same combat capabilities. The Polish Army uses PT-91s in 3 variants– PT-91, PT-91MA and the PT-91MA1.

===PT-91A &quot;Twardy&quot;===
Development variant with a PZL-Wola S-1000 1,000 hp engine with mechanic transmission and a number of other minor changes. Used for trials and as a demonstrator on military exhibitions.

===PT-91Z &quot;Hardy&quot;===
(&quot;Z&quot; for &quot;Zmodernizowany&quot; – literally &quot;Modernized&quot;) Further development with a SAGEM Savan-15 fire control system. In live-fire tests the Savan-15 has a minor advantage in accuracy over the Drawa.&lt;ref name= &quot;NTW 11/99&quot;&gt;Nowa Technika Wojskowa – November 1999 page 18 – Polskie T-72 – Co dalej? - by Tomasz Begier and Dariusz Użycki&lt;/ref&gt; The biggest advantage is a new gun stabilization system that provides a significant increase in accuracy when the tank is on the move. Later it was used as a base to develop the PT-91M. This variant has won a number of stress tests in Malaysia over the T-90, T-84 and K1 tanks, and has won the competition for a new Malaysian MBT. Only one prototype was made.

===PT-91M &quot;Pendekar&quot;===
(&quot;M&quot; for &quot;Malaysia&quot;) Production export variant for Malaysia with a Sagem Savan-15 fire control system, a new 1,000 hp powerpack, and a Renk automatic transmission, bringing its top speed to 70 km/h. Its main gun has been changed to a ZTS 2A46MS 125 mm gun, along with a 7.62 mm FN MAG coaxial machine gun and a 12.7 mm FN Browning M2 HB AA machine gun. This variant is equipped with a Sagem panoramic sight, a Sagem laser gyro inertial navigation system, turret stabilisation system, Obra-3 laser-warning system, and is integrated with 81 mm smoke grenade launchers, CBRN warning and protection system, and Thales communication system. It also features ERAWA 2 Explosive Reactive Armour, and German-made tank tracks (Diehl Defence). Two prototypes were made (renamed PT-91E and PT-91Ex), then 48 serial PT-91M Pendekar vehicles were produced from 2007 to 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;NTW 10/05&quot;&gt;Nowa Technika Wojskowa – October 2005 page 9 – Pierwsza prezentacja &quot;Malaja&quot; - by Andrzej Kliński&lt;/ref&gt;

===PT-91E/Ex===

(&quot;E&quot; for &quot;Export&quot;) Renamed prototypes of the PT-91M used as demonstrators of the export variant shown at military exhibitions. The PT-91E is an initial prototype, initially named SP1 (it is the same vehicle that was shown on military parade in Kuala Lumpur in 2005). PT-91Ex is the second prototype, named SP2.&lt;ref name=&quot;NTW 11/07&quot;&gt;Nowa Technika Wojskowa – November 2007 page 15 – Pokaz &quot;Malaja&quot; i CV90120-T na Drawsku – by Andrzej Kliński&lt;/ref&gt; Both vehicles faced a number of tests in Malaysia. SP1 was used for traction tests and was driven 7000 km offroad in Malaysia. SP2 achieved 2000 km with 500 firings of the main cannon. The PT-91Ex is very similar to PT-91M, and is offered for export to other countries.

===PT-91P===
(&quot;P&quot; for &quot;Peru&quot;) A demonstrator for the SITDEF Peru 2009 military exhibition, the PT-91P is a cheaper alternative to the PT-91Ex. This variant is equipped with the latest PCO Drawa-TG fire control system, a thermal sight, and a modern communication system (Radmor RRC9310 radio, WB Electronics Fonet-IP communication system and Teldat battlefield management system). The vehicle was shown at a number of South American events including the SITDEF Peru 2009 Expo.&lt;ref name=&quot;NTW 04/09&quot;&gt;Nowa Technika Wojskowa – April 2009 page 16 – Twardy na wystawie w Peru – by Andrzej Kliński&lt;/ref&gt;

===PT-72U / PT-91U / PT-91EU===
(&quot;U&quot; for &quot;Urbanizowany&quot; – Tank to fight in urbanized terrain) A demonstrator for the MSPO 2011 military exhibition. This is an offer for the Polish Army which involves certain modifications of the T-72 and PT-91 tanks. The modification includes installation of such additional equipment as a remote-controlled cannon with an optical system, an omnidirectional observation system, add-on armour, and further engineering equipment. The PT-72U is equipped with a remote-controlled weapon station armed with a 12.7 mm machine gun mounted to the crew commander hatch. The system had a fire rotation of 360° and an elevation angle for the gun from -5° to 55°.

The observation system is equipped with 8 day–night cameras with the observation angle 55° and a rotary passive camera FLIR which has up to 26 times optical zoom. The armour package has chassis and turret bar armour. The bottom of the chassis is equipped with reactive armour and add-on armour. The PT-72U is equipped with a full range of new modern internal and external communication tools, allowing communication also via the internet. There were plans to modernize 84 Armenian T-72s to the PT-72U standard.

===PT-16===
A further development introduced in 2016. Upgrades include improved armour, armament, and mobility. The hull armour and cast turret have been upgraded with add-on composite armour equivalent to up to 1000 mm RHA (rolled homogeneous armour), supplied by Germany. The protection can be improved with Polish ERAWA explosive reactive armour. The 125 mm smoothbore cannon has been replaced with a 120 mm smoothbore cannon compatible with NATO ammunition and uses a carousel-type autoloader. This autoloader is separate from the crew compartment, where the T-72 autoloader was located. The manned 12.7 mm machine gun has been upgraded to be remotely operated.

Other improvements include an upgraded fire control system. The tank is proposed to be fitted with a new engine, options for which include an unspecified Serbian turbocharged diesel, a German 1088 hp, Serbian V46-TK, and potentially yet-to-be-developed 1200 hp engines. Other improvements include rubber skirts covering the lower hull and the tracks, and new tracks based on those found on German Leopard 2s, which can be fitted with deep wading kits to allow it to ford water obstacles up to deep. The upgrade can be applied to both PT-91s and T-72M1s, of which Poland has a total of 823 (233 PT-91s, 120 active T-72M1s, and 470 reserve T-72M1s). The vehicle did not enter mass production.

===PT-17===
The main goals of the PT-17 tank were to increase firepower and fire maneuverability, increase mobility and survivability on the battlefield, improve crew comfort, and increase mission duration. The demonstrator was developed in cooperation with Ukrainian companies that supplied the tank turret.
The PT-17&#x27;s power range includes a S1000R ESM-350M engine and a reinforced suspension. Diehl rubber tracks are used. The chassis equipment includes an auxiliary power generator (APU), air conditioning, a new steering system with shuttlecock and a PCO KDN-1 Nyks day/night reversing camera.

The tank turret is a Ukrainian construction, featuring the Ukrainian KBM-2 smoothbore 120 mm cannon, with a barrel length of L50, and a 22 mm ammunition-charge unit mounted in the niche of the turret. The total ammunition capacity is 50 shells. The PT-17 was created with the experience of Ukrainian designers from UkrObronProm - the Oplot tank. Based on the Doublet reactive armor, the ERAWA-II reactive armor was created. He also took over the booking from him. According to statements by representatives from &quot;Bumar-Łabędy&quot;, the armor of the tank is estimated at 1000mm of homogeneous armor. However, the turret&#x27;s armor, as well as information about the latest reactive armor, have not been disclosed. The armament is supplemented by a 7.62 mm caliber machine gun and a remotely mounted ZSMU-1276 armament module manufactured by Zakłady Mechaniczne &quot;Tarnów&quot; S.A. The turret was equipped with stabilized sight-and-sight optics, GOC-1 Nike and GOD-1 Iris from PCO S.A. and BMS. Optionally, the manufacturer advises on the use of Safran&#x27;s VIGY-15 panoramic day-observation device.

The additional composite armour of both the hull and the turret is expected to increase survival of the tank on the battlefield, as is the installed PCO SSP-1 OBRA-3 universal self-propelled vehicle system and two 6-tube intermittent grenade launchers.

===PT-91M2===
Although the PT-91M2&#x27;s modernization objectives are the same as the PT-17&#x27;s, the range of the PT-91M2 differs considerably. The S-12U engine is powered by an 850-horsepower engine with enhanced mechanical transmission (Cx version). Tracks come with rubber overlays developed by Obrum / Bumar. Like the PT-17, reinforced suspension (torsion shafts, shock absorbers, and elastomer bumpers) are used. Among the chassis, equipment included the auxiliary power generator (APU), the modernized rotary car charger, the PNK-72 &quot;Radomka&quot; night-vision, and PCO KDN-1 Nyks night-time reversing camera. Hull protection is provided by the ERAWA III reactive armour and rod armour at the rear of the chassis.

Increased firepower is planned to be achieved by installing a 125 mm 2M46MS caliber Slovak cannon with a barrel length of 48 calibres. Inside the turret, there is also a change to the location of the second round of ammunition. Significantly, the PT-91M2 demonstrated a SAVAN-15 French fire control system (SAVAN-15) from Safran, previously used in PT-91M tanks in Malaysia. A TKN-3z night vision mount is available for the commander. The PT-91M2 has a SOD Observation System, a universal PCO SSP-1 OBRA-3 vehicle self-propelled system (both PCO S.A.), and two modules each of 12 902A smoke grenades. Additional protection for the turret includes ERAWA reactive armour modules.

Closely related to a truck based MS-20 Daglezja. Currently in development phase, it is expected to replace a T-55 based BLG-67M bridges in Polish Army.

===PZA &quot;Loara&quot;===
The &quot;PZA&quot; (&quot;Przeciwlotniczy Zestaw Artyleryjski&quot;, meaning &quot;AA Artillery System&quot;; “Loara” means “Loire” in Polish) is an armoured self-propelled anti-aircraft artillery system developed in the late 1990s. Based around the &quot;Twardy&quot; chassis, this system mounts an armoured turret holding two Oerlikon KDA 35 mm cannons linked to a radar fire control system. It was planned that it would work closely together with PZR “Loara” (anti-aircraft rocket system) vehicles built on the basis of the PZA Loara but that project is currently on hold. The Loara is an autonomous fire unit capable of performing its tasks independently or acting as a component of a wider air defense system.

The system has two radars, 3D search radar and engagement radar. The search radar has a range of and is capable of tracking and identifying up to 64 targets at once. The radar system can be operated on the move, refreshing its data every second. The system has a laser range-finder, TV and FLIR cameras giving the system both all-weather day/night capabilities and the ability to operate entirely passively in a heavy ECM environment. The system has a reaction time less than 10 seconds. The system can engage aircraft flying at altitudes from very low altitudes up to , and flying at speeds up to 500 m/s (1,125 mph). It is effective against infantry, lightly armoured ground and naval targets.

===SJ-09===
SJ-09 is one of the elements of the T-72 and PT-91 crew training system. The system is composed of both trainers teaching crew trainees how to operate different systems of the tank and simulators allowing training more advanced situations. For example, the SJ-02 is used to teach how to load the main gun. The SJ-09 is the driver training vehicle used to train drivers in operating of the vehicle as big and heavy as main battle tank. The vehicle is a tank chassis that has the turret replaced with an instructor station. All unnecessary equipment (like side skirts) were removed. The vehicle has a dummy main gun that obstructs the driver&#x27;s view, like in the real tank. Vehicles used by the Polish Army were rebuilt from the few original T-72 Ural in Polish inventory delivered from Soviet Union. Another vehicle was built new for the Malaysian Army as a part of the PT-91M order.

===PT-94 &quot;Goryl&quot;===
(&quot;Goryl&quot; is Polish for &quot;Gorilla&quot;) – project of a Polish main battle tank designed using experience gained on PT-91 project. The tank would be similar in its design to Merkava (engine at front), and it would feature redesigned engine, transmission and fire control system. Armour: composite + ERA, main armament: 120/125 mm gun, 60 mm mortar, secondary armament: 7.62 mm PKT coaxial machine gun, 12.7 mm NSWT AA machine gun, crew: 3. This program was also known under the name Anders. The program was cancelled at an early stage.

===PT-97 &quot;Gepard&quot;===
The Gepard (Polish for &quot;Cheetah&quot;), sometimes known as PT-2001, is another modification project of a Polish main battle tank prepared as a future modernisation programme for the T-72 family. The programme was called for, after the first PT-91 proposition fell below requirements. Two propositions were submitted, one by Bumar which provided a project with modified frontal armour, different mortar and sporting a Leclerc–like a turret with the 2A46 main gun. OBRUM&#x27;s competing project had new front and sides reactive armour and a L-44 main gun.

Despite considerable improvements, neither was approved for financial reasons, and no prototypes were built. However, design experience helped with new PT-91 versions.

===Krab===
The &quot;Krab&quot; (Polish for &quot;Crab&quot;) is a 155 mm self-propelled howitzer designed by HSW S.A. with an OBRUM&#x27;s UPG-NG chassis (a heavily modified variant of the SPG-1M vehicle) which utilizes only a handful of components from the PT-91 program such as the road wheels, suspension and S-12U power plant. It combines these with a licensed AS-90M &quot;Braveheart&quot; turret armed with a 52-calibre gun and WB Electronics Artillery Fire Control System Topaz.

In 2014, this configuration was abandoned due to manufacturing flaws (microfractures detected in the vehicle&#x27;s welded steel plates), numerous reliability concerns related to the automotive performance of the chassis and the loss of the Polish manufacturing line for the S-12U engine, and was replaced by the Korean-made K9 tracked chassis.

==Operational history==
===Poland===
233 PT-91&quot;s&quot; were delivered between 1995 and 2002. 232 vehicles remain in service. An early prototype is preserved in the Land Forces Training Center museum in Poznań. 38 support vehicles were based on the T-72/PT-91 hull (29 WZT-3M armoured recovery vehicles, 8 MID engineering tanks, and one prototype PZA Loara self-propelled anti-aircraft weapon).

Units equipped with the PT-91 Twardy:

* 9 Brygada Kawalerii Pancernej (9th Armoured Cavalry Brigade) – two battalions, Braniewo - probably lost some tanks in 2022, relocated to units using T-72 that were transferred to Ukraine, it is expected that eventually 9th Brigade will receive K2 Black Panther like whole 16th Mechanized Division. 
* 15 Brygada Zmechanizowana - operating one battalion of PT-91, same situation as with 9t Brigade.
* 19 Brygada Zmechanizowana - in 2022 received some PT-91s for training in place of T-72s transferred to Ukraine, eventually like whole 18th Mechanized Division it is expected to be equipped with M1 Abrams (expected since 2025).
* Centrum Szkolenia Wojsk Lądowych (Land Forces Training Center) – Poznań
Former units equipped with PT-91 Twardy:
* 1 Warszawska Brygada Pancerna (1st Armoured Brigade) Wesoła - one battalion, 2015 replaced with Leopard 2, since 2023 equipped with M1 Abrams like the rest of 18th Division
* 2 Brygada Zmechanizowana Legionów (2nd Mechanised Brigade) Złocieniec – In 2022 unit lost all its tanks, because most T-72s in service were transferred to Ukraine, as of 2023 tank battalion of 2nd Mechanized has no tanks. 
* 10 Brygada Kawalerii Pancernej (10th Armoured Cavalry Brigade) – Świętoszów (replaced with Leopard 2A4 in 2002-03)
* 15 Wielkopolska Brygada Kawalerii Pancernej (15th Armoured Cavalry Brigade) – Wędrzyn (unit disbanded in June 2007)
* 17 Wielkopolska Brygada Zmechanizowana (17th Mechanized Brigade) – Międzyrzecz (replaced with KTO Rosomak)
* 34 Brygada Kawalerii Pancernej (34th Armoured Cavalry Brigade) – Żagań (replaced with Leopard 2A5 in 2014-15)

At the introduction of PT-91, the intention of Polish General Staff was to equip all brigades of the 11th Armoured Cavalry Division with the PT-91. At the time, the division had four brigades: the 10th Armoured Cavalry, 15th Armoured Cavalry, 17th Mechanised, and 34th Armoured Cavalry.

In 2002, the 10th Armoured Cavalry brigade received Leopard 2A4 tanks donated to Poland by Germany. In 2007, the 15th Armoured Cavalry brigade was disbanded and the 17th Mechanised received the first KTO Rosomak. All these changes allowed the reallocation of PT-91s to other divisions, replacing the oldest T-72s. In early 2014, the 34th Brigade from Żagań received the first Leopard 2A5 tanks, shifting its PT-91s to the 9th Brigade in Braniewo, which previously used the T-72M1.

A typical Polish PT-91 tank battalion is equipped with 58 tanks, composed of four frontline companies with 14 vehicles each, and 2 tanks for the battalion commander and the battalion second in command. Every company of 14 tanks is composed of three platoons, with 4 tanks in each and 2 tanks for the company commander and company&#x27;s second in command.

Before the start of the war in Ukraine, Polish Land Forces operated 4 battalions of PT-91 tanks. 3 battalions in 16th Mechanized Division (2 in 9th Armored Cav brigade, 1 in 15th Mechanized Brigade) and one battalion in 12th Mechanized Division (2nd Mechanized Brigade). Since the start of the war in Ukraine, Poland transferred most combat ready T-72s and at least one battalion of PT-91 to Ukraine. 2nd Mechanized Brigade lost its PT-91 tanks in one tank battalion completely, 34th Armored Cavalry lost all (combat ready) T-72s from its two battalions with no replacement. 19th Mechanized Brigade also lost all T-72s from two battalions but received some PT-91s from 9th Armored Cavalry and 15th Mechanized (making all 3 units understrength). 20th Mechanized Brigade is another unit that lost all its T-72s from its one tank battalion, but already received first K2 Black Panther tanks (two companies as of late 2023), it will have two battalions of K2, including one newly formed.

It is planned that 16th Mechanized Division (with 9th Armored Cavalry, 15th and 20th Mechanized Brigades) will be equipped with K2 tanks (during transition a mix of K2 and PT-91). 18th Mechanized Division (with 1st Armored, 19th and 21st Mechanized Brigades) is receiving M1 Abrams tanks that will replace Leopard 2 and remains of T-72. It is expected 11th Armored Cavalry Division (with 10th and 34 Armored Cavalry and 17th Mechanized Brigades) will continue to operate Leopard 2 tanks that undergo upgrade to Leopard 2 PL variant (in 10th Brigade) and will receive more Leopard 2 tanks from 18th Division that will be replaced by M1 Abrams (for 34th Brigade).

===Malaysia===

In 2007–2009, Bumar Łabędy delivered to Malaysia 48 PT-91M and 15 support vehicles (6 WZT-4 {WZT-91M} armoured recovery vehicle, 3 MID-M {MID-91M} engineering tank, 5 PMC Leguan {PMC-91M} - armoured vehicle-launched bridge and one SJ-09 driver training tank), ammo, spares and support for US$370 million. Operating capability was reached 1 September 2010.

Units equipped with PT-91M:
* Rejimen ke-11 Kor Armour DiRaja – (&quot;11th Regiment of Royal Armoured Corps&quot;) – Gemas

Rejimen ke-11 KAD is the sole user of PT-91M in the Malaysian Army.

===Georgia===
Upgraded Georgian army T-72SIM-1 tanks use the Drawa-T fire control system, a development of the fire control system on the PT-91. The FCS is equipped with laser range finder and thermal imaging sensor. The system is slightly different from the one used on Polish PT-91s: the commander uses an LCD screen instead of an eyepiece. The Thermal Elbow Sight thermal imaging sensor used in Georgian tanks is of the same (Israeli) origin as the one used on the PT-91, though the external housing is different.

===India===
In April 1999, India ordered 44 WZT-3 armoured recovery vehicles, followed by orders in April 2002 (80 vehicles) and July 2005 (228 vehicles) for a total of 352 WZT-3s. These vehicles are used to support the T-72 and T-90 main battle tanks. Deliveries began in 2001, and India was planning to upgrade its Ajeya Mk1 tanks (local name for T-72M1) to Ajeya Mk2 standard, with some elements from PT-91, such as the Drawa-TE1 fire control system and the PZL-Wola S-1000 engine.

In October 2011, the Indian Defense Ministry announced that the state-owned BEML would produce an additional 204 WZT-3 armoured recovery vehicles – taking the total to 556 vehicles. The Ministry also clarified that no global tender was floated because it was a repeat order.

===Ukraine===
In April 2023, at least 30 PT-91s were sent to Ukraine by Poland for support in the 2023 Ukrainian counteroffensive. The tanks are used by 22nd Mechanized Brigade, new brigade of Ukrainian Land Forces trained and equipped by Poland.

As of the 5 of January 2025, the Oryx blog recorded the loss of 11 PT-91 tanks during the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

They were used by Ukraine during the August 2024 Kursk Oblast incursion.

<text>In mathematics, specifically in functional and complex analysis, the disk algebra &quot;A&quot;(D) (also spelled disc algebra) is the set of holomorphic functions

:&quot;ƒ&quot; : D → formula_1,

(where D is the open unit disk in the complex plane formula_1) that extend to a continuous function on the closure of D. That is,
:formula_3
where denotes the Banach space of bounded analytic functions on the unit disc D (i.e. a Hardy space).
When endowed with the pointwise addition (&quot;ƒ&quot; + &quot;g&quot;)(&quot;z&quot;)  &quot;ƒ&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) + &quot;g&quot;(&quot;z&quot;), and pointwise multiplication (&quot;ƒg&quot;)(&quot;z&quot;)  &quot;ƒ&quot;(&quot;z&quot;)&quot;g&quot;(&quot;z&quot;), this set becomes an algebra over C, since if &quot;ƒ&quot; and &quot;g&quot; belong to the disk algebra then so do &quot;ƒ&quot; + &quot;g&quot; and &quot;ƒg&quot;.

Given the uniform norm,
:formula_4
by construction it becomes a uniform algebra and a commutative Banach algebra.

By construction the disc algebra is a closed subalgebra of the Hardy space . In contrast to the stronger requirement that a continuous extension to the circle exists, it is a lemma of Fatou that a general element of &quot;H&quot;∞ can be radially extended to the circle almost everywhere.

<text>Amandus Augustus Abendroth (16 October 1767 in Hamburg – 17 December 1842) was a German jurist and mayor of Hamburg.

He was the son of Abraham Augustus Abendroth, a lower court procuration from Eisenberg, Saxony. Beginning in 1787, he studied law in Erlangen and Göttingen, where he was awarded a doctorate on 30 March 1790. He married in Venice in 1792. After having lived for a number of years as a lawyer in Hamburg, where he helped to administer the newly founded &quot;Armen-Anstalt&quot; (&quot;Poor&#x27;s Institution&quot;), he was elected alderman on 5 September 1800.

In this capacity he held the office of praetor – meaning mayor – during the French occupation. The praetor was the first instance for civil cases and led the fact-finding actions when required. In 1809 he became governor of Ritzebüttel. After the incorporation of the town into the French Empire, he became &quot;maire&quot;, mayor of the same town.

After the end of the occupation and his return to Hamburg, Abendroth became head of the police, as successor of his brother-in-law Johann Heinrich Bartels, and once more helped in the &quot;Armen-Anstalt&quot;. He was voted mayor of Hamburg on 29 July 1831, succeeding Wilhelm Amsinck.

He is the father of August Abendroth, a Hamburgian lawyer.

<doc id="761227" wikidata="Q4448003" url="?curid=761227" title="Rawhide (material)">
<text>Rawhide is a hide or animal skin that has not been exposed to tanning. It is similar to parchment, much lighter in color than leather made by traditional vegetable tanning.

Rawhide is more susceptible to water than leather, and it quickly softens and stretches if left wet unless well waterproofed.

&quot;Rawhide&quot; laces often sold for boots or baseball gloves are made of normal tanned leather rather than actual rawhide. Rawhide is not pliable when dry and would be unsuitable for that use.

== Process ==
The skin from buffalo, deer, elk or cattle from which most rawhide originates is prepared by removing all fur, meat and fat. The hide is then usually stretched over a frame before being dried. The resulting material is hard and translucent. It can be shaped by rewetting and forming before being allowed to thoroughly re-dry. It can be rendered more pliable by &#x27;working&#x27;, i.e. bending repeatedly in multiple directions, often by rubbing it over a post, sometimes traditionally by chewing. It may also be oiled or greased for a degree of waterproofing.

== Uses ==
It is often used for objects such as whips, drumheads or lampshades, and more recently chew toys for dogs. It is thought to be more durable than leather, especially in items suffering abrasion during use, and its hardness and its shapability render it more suitable than leather for some items. 

=== Saddles ===
Rawhide is often used to cover saddle trees, which make up the foundation of a western saddle, while wet: it strengthens the wooden tree by drawing up very tight as it dries and resists the abrasion regularly encountered during stock work or rodeo sports. 

=== Bows ===
Rawhide can be used as a backing on a wooden bow. Such a backing keeps the bow from breaking by protecting the back from damage and preventing splinters from forming. Bows made from softer woods such as birch benefit more from a rawhide backing.

=== Hammers ===
Soft hammers are also made with rolled rawhide dipped in shellac: these hammers are mostly used to work soft metals without marring them (by jewelers, brass instrument repairmen, boilermakers etc.).

=== Shoes ===
Traditional gaucho&#x27;s &quot;boots&quot; are made with horse feet rawhide. Gauchos skin the animal and put the freshly skinned hides on their feet like socks, where they are left to dry, taking the user&#x27;s feet shape. Like moccasins they are soft-soled. Like ancient Roman cothurnus, the rudimentary boots have no toe box and do not cover the toes completely.

=== Dog chew ===
Rawhide is used in many dog chews. Some veterinarians discourage the giving of rawhide to dogs because of the animal&#x27;s inability to digest the rawhide properly, sometimes causing bowel obstruction that is fatal if left untreated.

=== Garrotte / Medical uses ===
Wet rawhide has been used by some earlier cultures as a means of torture or execution, gradually biting into or squeezing the flesh of body parts it encloses as it dries. An example is buskin. On the other hand, it has also been used in the context of medicine by First Nations peoples, and other groups such as the Sioux Nation: wet rawhide would be wrapped around a long bone fracture and it would dry, slowly setting the bone; the dried rawhide then served to support the fracture, similar to how a plaster cast does today.

===Boat===
The &quot;pelota&quot; was an improvised rawhide boat used for crossing rivers in South and Central America.

<text>A sexual network is a social network that is defined by the sexual relationships within a set of individuals.

==Studies and discoveries==
Like other forms of social networks, sexual networks can be formally studied using the mathematics of graph theory and network theory.

Recent epidemiological studies have investigated sexual networks, and suggest that the statistical properties of sexual networks are crucial to the spread of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Sub-graphs, both large and small, can be defined within the overall sexual network graph; for example, people who frequent particular bars or clubs, belong to a particular ethnic group or take part in a particular type of sexual activity, or are part of a particular outbreak of an STI. In particular, assortative mixing between people with large numbers of sexual partners seems to be an important factor in the spread of an STI.

In a surprising result, mathematical models predict that the sexual network graph for the human race appears to have a single giant component that indirectly links almost all people who have had more than one sexual partner, and a great many of those who have had only one sexual partner (if their one sexual partner was themselves part of the giant component).

For more detailed epidemiological work, the time sequence of sexual contacts is important.

<text>A bell is a directly struck idiophone percussion instrument. Most bells have the shape of a hollow cup that when struck vibrates in a single strong strike tone, with its sides forming an efficient resonator. The strike may be made by an internal &quot;clapper&quot; or &quot;uvula&quot;, an external hammer, or—in small bells—by a small loose sphere enclosed within the body of the bell (jingle bell).

Bells are usually cast from bell metal (a type of bronze) for its resonant properties, but can also be made from other hard materials. This depends on the function. Some small bells such as ornamental bells or cowbells can be made from cast or pressed metal, glass or ceramic, but large bells such as a church, clock and tower bells are normally cast from bell metal.

Bells intended to be heard over a wide area can range from a single bell hung in a turret or bell-gable, to a musical ensemble such as an English ring of bells, a carillon or a Russian zvon which are tuned to a common scale and installed in a bell tower. Many public or institutional buildings house bells, most commonly as clock bells to sound the hours and quarters.

Historically, bells have been associated with religious rites, and are still used to call communities together for religious services. Later, bells were made to commemorate important events or people and have been associated with the concepts of peace and freedom. The study of bells is called campanology.

==Etymology==

&quot;Bell&quot; is a word common to the Low German dialects, cognate with Middle Low German and Dutch but not appearing among the other Germanic languages except the Icelandic which was a loanword from Old English. It is popularly but not certainly related to the former sense of &quot;to bell&quot; (, &#x27;to roar, to make a loud noise&#x27;) which gave rise to &quot;bellow&quot;.

== History ==
The earliest archaeological evidence of bells dates from the 3rd millennium BCE, and is traced to the Yangshao culture of Neolithic China. Clapper-bells made of pottery have been found in several archaeological sites. The pottery bells later developed into metal bells. In West Asia, the first bells appear in 1000 BCE. The earliest metal bells, with one found in the Taosi site and four in the Erlitou site, are dated to about 2000 BCE. With the emergence of other kinds of bells during the Shang dynasty (), they were relegated to subservient functions; at Shang and Zhou sites, they are also found as part of the horse-and-chariot gear and as collar-bells of dogs. By the 13th century BCE, bells weighing over were being cast in China. After 1000 CE, iron became the most commonly used metal for bells instead of bronze. The earliest dated iron bell was manufactured in 1079, found in Hubei Province.

Bells west of China did not reach the same size until the 2nd millennium CE. Assyrian bells dated to the 7th century BCE were around 4 inches high. Roman bells dated to the 1st and 2nd century CE were around 8 inches high. The book of Exodus in the Bible notes that small gold bells were worn as ornaments on the hem of the robe of the high priest in Jerusalem. Among the ancient Greeks, handbells were used in camps and garrisons and by patrols that went around to visit sentinels. Among the Romans, the hour of bathing was announced by a bell. They also used them in the home, as an ornament and emblem, and bells were placed around the necks of cattle and sheep so they could be found if they strayed. As late as the 10th century CE, European bells were no higher than 2 feet in height.

== Styles of ringing ==

In the western world, the common form of bell is a church bell or town bell, which is hung within a tower or bell cote. Such bells are either fixed in a static position (&quot;hung dead&quot;) or mounted on a beam (the &quot;headstock&quot;) so they can swing to and fro. Bells that are hung dead are normally sounded by hitting the sound bow with a hammer or occasionally by pulling an internal clapper against the bell.

Where a bell is swung, it can either be swung over a small arc by a rope and lever or by using a rope on a wheel to swing the bell higher. As the bell swings higher the sound is projected outwards rather than downwards. Larger bells may be swung using electric motors. In some places, such as the Salzburg Cathedral, the clapper is held against the sound bow with an electric clasp as the bell swings up. The clasp would release the clapper to provide a cleaner start to ringing. To silence the bell, the clasp catches and locks the clapper back in place.

Bells hung for full circle ringing are swung through just over a complete circle from mouth uppermost. A stay (the wooden pole seen sticking up when the bells are down) engages a mechanism to allow the bell to rest just past its balance point. The rope is attached to one side of a wheel so that a different amount of rope is wound on and off as it swings to and fro. The bells are controlled by ringers (one to a bell) in a chamber below, who rotate the bell through a full circle and back, and control the speed of oscillation when the bell is mouth upwards at the balance-point when little effort is required.

Swinging bells are sounded by an internal clapper. The clapper may have a longer period of swing than the bell. In this case, the bell will catch up with the clapper and if rung to or near full circle will carry the clapper up on the bell&#x27;s trailing side. Alternatively, the clapper may have a shorter period and catch up with the bell&#x27;s leading side, travel up with the bell, and come to rest on the downhill side. This latter method is used in English style full circle ringing.

Occasionally the clappers have leather pads (called &quot;muffles&quot;) strapped around them to quieten the bells when practice ringing to avoid annoying the neighbourhood. Also at funerals, &quot;half-muffles&quot; are often used to give a full open sound on one round, and a muffled sound on the alternate round for a distinctive, mournful effect. This was done at the Funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales in 1997.

A carillon, which is a musical instrument consisting of at least 23 cast bronze cup-shaped bells, is tuned so that the bells can be played serially to produce a melody, or sounded together to play a chord. A traditional carillon is played by striking a baton keyboard with the fists, and by pressing the keys of a pedal keyboard with the feet. The keys mechanically activate levers and wires that connect to metal clappers that strike the inside of the bells, allowing the performer to vary the intensity of the note according to the force applied to the key.

== Church and temple bells ==
In the Eastern world, the traditional forms of bells are temple and palace bells, small ones being rung by a sharp rap with a stick, and very large ones rung by a blow from the outside by a large swinging beam. (See images of the great bell of Mii-dera below.)

The striking technique is employed worldwide for some of the largest tower-borne bells because swinging the bells themselves could damage their towers.

In the Roman Catholic Church and among some High Lutherans and Anglicans, small hand-held bells, called Sanctus or sacring bells, are often rung by a server at Mass when the priest holds high up first the host and then the chalice immediately after he has said the words of consecration over them (the moment known as the Elevation). This serves to indicate to the congregation that the bread and wine have just been transformed into the Body and Blood of Christ (see transubstantiation), or, in the alternative Reformation teaching, that Christ is now bodily present in the elements, and that what the priest is holding up for them to look at is Christ himself (see consubstantiation).

In Russian Orthodox bell ringing, the entire bell never moves, only the clapper. A complex system of ropes is developed and used uniquely for every bell tower. Some ropes (the smaller ones) are played by hand, the bigger ropes are played by foot.

=== Bells in Japanese religion ===

Japanese Shintoist and Buddhist bells are used in religious ceremonies. &quot;Suzui&quot;, a homophone meaning both &quot;cool&quot; and &quot;refreshing&quot;, are spherical bells which contain metal pellets that produce sound from the inside. The hemispherical bell is the &quot;Kane&quot; bell, which is struck on the outside. Large suspended temple bells are known as &quot;bonshō&quot;. (See also :ja:鈴, :ja:梵鐘).

=== Bells in Jainism, Buddhism and Hinduism ===
Jain, Hindu and Buddhist bells, called &quot;Ghanta&quot; (IAST: Ghaṇṭā) in Sanskrit, are used in religious ceremonies. See also singing bowls. A bell hangs at the gate of many Hindu temples and is rung at the moment one enters the temple.
== Bellfounding ==
The process of casting bells is called bellfounding, and in Europe dates to the 4th or 5th century. The traditional metal for these bells is a bronze of about 23% tin. Known as &quot;bell metal&quot;, this alloy is also the traditional alloy for the finest Turkish and Chinese cymbals. Other materials sometimes used for large bells include brass and iron. Steel was tried during the busy church-building period of mid-19th-century England, because it was more economical than bronze, but was found not to be durable and manufacture ceased in the 1870s.

===Casting===
Small bells were originally made with the lost wax process but large bells are cast mouth downwards by filling the air space in a two-part mould with molten metal. Such a mould has an outer section clamped to a base-plate on which an inner core has been constructed.

The core is built on the base-plate using porous materials such as coke or brick and then covered in loam well mixed with straw and horse manure. This is given a profile corresponding to the inside shape of the finished bell and dried with gentle heat. Graphite and whiting are applied to form the final, smooth surface.

The outside of the mould is made within a perforated cast-iron case, larger than the finished bell, containing the loam mixture which is shaped, dried and smoothed in the same way as the core. The case is inverted (mouth down), lowered over the core and clamped to the base plate. The clamped mould is supported, usually by being buried in a &quot;casting pit&quot; to bear the weight of metal and to allow even cooling.

Historically, before rail or road transport of large bells was possible, a &quot;bell pit&quot; was often dug in the grounds of the building where the bell was to be installed. Molten bell metal is poured into the mould through a box lined with foundry sand. The founder would bring his casting tools to the site, and a furnace would be built next to the pit.

===Bell tuning===


Large bells are generally around 80% copper and 20% tin (bell metal), which has been found empirically to give the most pleasant tone. However, the tone of a bell is mostly due to its shape. A bell is regarded as having a good tone when it is &quot;in tune with itself&quot;. In western bell founding, this is known as &quot;harmonic tuning&quot; of a bell, which results in the bell&#x27;s strongest harmonics being in harmony with each other and the strike note. This produces the brightest and purest sound, which is the attractive sound of a good bell. Much effort has been expended over the centuries to find the shape which will produce the harmonically tuned bell.

The accompanying musical staves show the series of harmonics which are generated when a bell is struck. The Erfurt bell is notable that it although it is an old bell, it is harmonically tuned, but was not typical of its time. Pieter and François Hemony in the 17th century reliably cast many bells for carillons of unequalled quality of tuning for the time, but after their death, their guarded trade secrets were lost, and not until the 19th century were bells of comparable tuning quality cast. It was only in modern times that repeatable harmonic tuning using a known scientific basis was achieved. The main partials (or harmonics) of a well-tuned bell are:

* hum note (an octave below the named note)
* strike tone (also called tap note or named note)
* tierce (a minor third above named note)
* quint (a fifth above named note)
* nominal (an octave above named note)

Further, less-audible, harmonics include the major third and a perfect fifth in the second octave above the named note.

This quest by various founders over centuries of bell founding has resulted in the development of an optimum profile for casting each size of a bell to give true harmonic tuning. Although bells are cast to accurate patterns, variations in casting mean that a final tuning is necessary as the shape of the bell is critical in producing the desired strike note and associated harmonics. Tuning is undertaken by clamping the bell on a large rotating table and using a cutting tool to remove metal. This is an iterative process in which metal is removed from certain parts of the bell to change certain harmonics. This process was made possible historically by the use of tuning forks to find sympathetic resonance on specific parts of a bell for the harmonic being tuned, but today electronic strobe tuners are normally used. To tune the strike note, the nominal or the strike note are tuned; the effect is usually the same because the nominal is one of the main partials that determines the tone of the strike note. The thickness of a church bell at its thickest part, called the &quot;sound bow&quot;, is usually one thirteenth its diameter. If the bell is mounted as cast, it is called a &quot;maiden bell&quot;.

====Major third bell====
The traditional harmonically tuned bell has a minor third as a main harmonic. On the theory that western music in major keys may sound better on bells with a major third as a harmonic, production of bells with major thirds was attempted in the 1980s. Scientists at the Technical University in Eindhoven, using computer modelling, produced bell profiles which were cast by the Eijsbouts Bellfoundry in the Netherlands. They were described as resembling old Coke bottles in that they had a bulge around the middle; In 1999 a design without the bulge was announced. However, the major bell concept has found little favour; most bells cast today are almost universally minor third bells.

== Use in clock chimes ==

Bells are also associated with clocks, indicating the hour by the striking of bells. Indeed, the word &quot;clock&quot; comes from the Latin word &quot;Cloca&quot;, meaning &quot;bell&quot;. Bells in clock towers or bell towers can be heard over long distances, which was especially important in the time when clocks were too expensive for widespread ownership.

In the case of clock towers and grandfather clocks, a particular sequence of tones may be played to distinguish between the hour, half-hour, quarter-hour, or other intervals. One common pattern is called &quot;Westminster Quarters,&quot; a sixteen-note pattern named after the Palace of Westminster which popularized it as the measure used by Big Ben.

== Notable bells ==

*The Great Bell of Dhammazedi (1484) may have been the largest bell ever made. It was lost in a river in Burma after being removed from a temple by the Portuguese in 1608. It is reported to have weighed about .
*The Tsar Bell by the Motorin Bellfounders is the largest bell still in existence. It weighs , but it was never rung and broke in 1737. It is on display in Moscow, Russia, inside the Kremlin.
*The Great Mingun Bell is the largest functioning bell. It is located in Mingun, Burma, and weighs .
* The Gotenba Bell is the largest functioning swinging bell, weighing . It is located in a tourist resort in Gotenba, Japan. Hung in a freestanding frame, it is rung by hand. It was cast by Eijsbouts in 2006.
*The World Peace Bell was the largest functioning swinging bell until 2006. It is located in Newport, Kentucky, United States, and was cast by the Paccard Foundry of France. The bell itself weighs ; with clapper and supports. The total weight which swings when the bell is rung is .
*The largest Bell of the People&#x27;s Salvation Cathedral is the largest free-swinging church bell in the world, surpassing the Petersglocke of Cologne Cathedral. Weighing more than 25 tons, it was cast by the Grassmayr Bell Foundry on the 11th of November 2016 and has a height of 3,130 mm, thickness of 273 mm.
*The Bell of King Seongdeok is the largest extant bell in Korea. The full Korean name means &quot;Sacred Bell of King Seongdeok the Great.&quot; It was also known as the Bell of Bongdeoksa Temple, where it was first housed. The bell weighs about 25 tons and was originally cast in 771 CE. It is now stored in the National Museum of Gyeongju.
*Pummerin in Vienna&#x27;s Stephansdom is the most famous bell in Austria and the fifth largest in the world.
*The St. Petersglocke, in the local dialect of Cologne also called &quot;&quot; (&quot;fat Peter&quot;, ), is a bell in Germany&#x27;s Cologne Cathedral. It weighs 24 tons and was cast in 1922. It is the largest functioning free-swinging bell in the world that swings from its top. (The Gotenba Bell and the World Peace Bell swing around their center of gravity, which is more like turning than swinging. So, depending on the point of view, the St. Petersglocke may be considered the largest free-swinging bell in the world.)
*Maria Dolens, the bell for the Fallen in Rovereto, Italy, weighs 22.6 tons.
*The South West tower of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral in London, England, houses Great Paul, the second largest bell at 16.5 tons in the British Isles. One can hear Great Paul booming out over Ludgate Hill at 1300 every day.
* The Olympic Bell, commissioned and cast for the 2012 London Olympic Games, is the largest harmonically-tuned bell in the world.
*Big Ben is the fourth-largest bell in the British Isles, after The Olympic Bell (used at the opening of the 2012 Olympic Games), Great Paul (St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, City of London) and Great George (Liverpool Cathedral). Big Ben is the hour bell of the Great Clock in the Elizabeth Tower (formerly called the Clock Tower) at the Palace of Westminster, the Houses of Parliament.
*The Dom Tower in the city of Utrecht, the Netherlands, houses the Salvator, weighing 8.2 tons and cast in 1505 by Geert van Wou.
*Great Tom is the bell that hangs in Tom Tower (designed by Christopher Wren) of Christ Church, Oxford. It was cast in 1680 and weighs over 6 tons. Great Tom is still rung 101 times at 21:05 every night to signify the 101 original scholars of the college.
*The Liberty Bell is a American bell of great historic significance, located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It previously hung in Independence Hall.
*Sigismund is a 12 tonne bell in the Wawel Cathedral in Kraków, Poland, cast in 1520. It is rung only on very significant national occasions.
*The Maria Gloriosa in Erfurt Cathedral, Germany, was cast by Geert van Wou in 1497, weighs more than 12,500 kg (13 tons) and is the world&#x27;s largest medieval free-swinging bell.
*The Lutine Bell is the ship&#x27;s bell of the wrecked HMS &quot;Lutine&quot;, weighs and bears the inscription &quot;ST. JEAN – 1779&quot;. It rests in the Lloyd&#x27;s of London Underwriting Room, where it used to be struck when news of an overdue ship arrived—once for the loss of a ship (i.e., bad news, last in 1979), and twice for her return (i.e., good news, last in 1989).
*The tenor (heaviest bell) of the change-ringing peal at Liverpool Cathedral is the heaviest bell hung for full-circle ringing.

== Usage as musical instruments ==
Some bells are used as musical instruments, such as carillons, (clock) chimes, agogô, or ensembles of bell-players, called bell choirs, using hand-held bells of varying tones. A &quot;ring of bells&quot; is a set of four to twelve or more bells used in change ringing, a particular method of ringing bells in patterns. A peal in changing ringing may have bells playing for several hours, playing 5,000 or more patterns without a break or repetition. They have also been used in many kinds of popular music, such as in AC/DC&#x27;s &quot;Hells Bells&quot; and Metallica&#x27;s &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot;.

=== Ancient Chinese bells ===

The ancient Chinese bronze chime bells called bianzhong or zhong / zeng (鐘) were used as polyphonic musical instruments and some have been dated at between 2000 and 3600 years old. Tuned bells have been created and used for musical performance in many cultures but &quot;Zhong&quot; are unique among all other types of cast bells in several respects and they rank among the highest achievements of Chinese bronze casting technology. However, the remarkable secret of their design and the method of casting—known only to the Chinese in antiquity—was lost in later generations and was not fully rediscovered and understood until the 20th century.

In 1978 a complete ceremonial set of 65 &quot;Zhong&quot; bells was found in a near-perfect state of preservation during the excavation of the tomb of Marquis Yi, ruler of Zeng, one of the Warring States. Their special shape gives them the ability to produce two different musical tones, depending on where they are struck. The interval between these notes on each bell is either a major or minor third, equivalent to a distance of four or five notes on a piano.

The bells of Marquis Yi—which were still fully playable after almost 2500 years—cover a range of slightly less than five octaves but thanks to their dual-tone capability, the set can sound a complete 12-tone scale—predating the development of the European 12-tone system by some 2000 years—and can play melodies in diatonic and pentatonic scales.

Another related ancient Chinese musical instrument is called qing (磬 pinyin qìng) but it was made of stone instead of metal.

In more recent times, the top of bells in China was usually decorated with a small dragon, known as &quot;pulao&quot;; the figure of the dragon served as a hook for hanging the bell.
===Konguro&#x27;o===
Konguro&#x27;o is a small bell which, like the Djalaajyn, was first used for utilitarian purposes and only later for artistic ones. Konguro&#x27;o rang when moving to new places. They were fastened to the horse harnesses and created a very specific &quot;smart&quot; sound background. Konguro&#x27;o also hung on the neck of the leader goat, which the sheep herd followed. This led to the association in folk memory between the distinctive sound of konguro&#x27;o and the nomadic way of life.

To make this instrument, Kyrgyz foremen used copper, bronze, iron and brass. They also decorated it with artistic carving and covered it with silver. Sizes of the instruments might vary within certain limits, what depended on its function. Every bell had its own timbre.

===Chimes===
A variant on the bell is the tubular bell. Several of these metal tubes which are struck manually with hammers, form an instrument named &quot;tubular bells&quot; or &quot;chimes&quot;. In the case of wind or aeolian chimes, the tubes are blown against one another by the wind.

===Skrabalai===
The skrabalai is a traditional folk instrument in Lithuania which consists of wooden bells of various sizes hanging in several vertical rows with one or two wooden or metal small clappers hanging inside them. It is played with two wooden sticks. When the skrabalai is moved a clapper knocks at the wall of the trough. The pitch of the sound depends on the size of the wooden trough. The instrument developed from wooden cowbells that shepherds would tie to cows&#x27; necks.

== Farm bells ==
Whereas the church and temple bells called to mass or religious service, bells were used on farms for more secular signalling. The greater farms in Scandinavia usually had a small bell-tower resting on the top of the barn. The bell was used to call the workers from the field at the end of the day&#x27;s work.

In folk tradition, it is recorded that each church and possibly several farms had their specific rhymes connected to the sound of the specific bells. An example is the Pete Seeger and Idris Davies song &quot;The Bells of Rhymney&quot;.

==Dead bell==
In Scotland, up until the nineteenth century, it was the tradition to ring a dead bell, a form of handbell, at the death of an individual and at the funeral.

==Bell study and ringing organizations==
Numerous organizations promote the ringing, study, music, collection, preservation and restoration of bells, including:
*The American Bell Association International (United States with foreign chapters)
*Central Council of Church Bell Ringers (worldwide) – promotes English style full circle change ringing
*The Guild of Carillonneurs in North America (Canada, Mexico, United States)

<text>Adriaen Brouwer ( – January 1638) was a Flemish painter active in Flanders and the Dutch Republic in the first half of the 17th century. Brouwer was an important innovator of genre painting through his vivid depictions of peasants, soldiers and other &quot;lower class&quot; individuals engaged in drinking, smoking, card or dice playing, fighting, music making etc. in taverns or rural settings. Brouwer contributed to the development of the genre of tronies, i.e. head or facial studies, which investigate varieties of expression. In his final year he produced a few landscapes of a tragic intensity. Brouwer&#x27;s work had an important influence on the next generation of Flemish and Dutch genre painters. Although Brouwer produced only a small body of work, Dutch masters Peter Paul Rubens and Rembrandt collected it.

==Life==
There are still a number of unresolved questions surrounding the early life and career of Adriaen Brouwer. The early Dutch biographer Arnold Houbraken included multiple erroneous statements and fanciful stories about Brouwer in his &quot;The Great Theatre of Dutch Painters&quot; of 1718–19. The most glaring mistakes of Houbraken were to place Brouwer&#x27;s place of birth in Haarlem in the Dutch Republic and to identify Frans Hals as his master.
It is now generally accepted that Brouwer was born in Oudenaarde in Flanders in 1605 or 1606. His father who was also called Adriaen worked as a tapestry designer in Oudenaarde, at the time an important centre for tapestry production in Flanders. The father died in poverty when Adriaen the younger was only 15 or 16 years old. Brouwer had by that time already left the paternal home.

Brouwer worked in Antwerp in 1622. By March 1625 Adriaen Brouwer was recorded in Amsterdam where he resided in the inn of the painter Barend van Someren, another Flemish artist who had taken up residence in the Dutch Republic. Brouwer is further recorded on 23 July 1626 as a notary&#x27;s witness when he signed a statement of Barend van Someren and Adriaen van Nieulandt about a sale of pictures in Amsterdam. It is possible that by that time he already lived in Haarlem. He was active in the Chamber of Rhetoric &#x27;De Wijngaertranken&#x27; in Haarlem. The motto of this amateur literary circle was: &quot;In Love Above All Else&quot;.

In 1631 Brouwer returned to his native Flanders where he was registered as a master in the Antwerp Guild of St Luke even before he had become a poorter of Antwerp. The artist continued to live and work in Antwerp until his untimely death. The artist&#x27;s name regularly shows up in Antwerp records usually in connection with arrangements for his various debts.
In 1633 Brouwer was jailed in the Antwerp Citadel. The reason for the imprisonment is not clear. Possibly it was for tax evasion, or, alternatively, for political reasons because the local authorities may have considered him to be a spy for the Dutch Republic. The operation of the bakery in the Antwerp Citadel was in the hands of the baker Joos van Craesbeeck. It is assumed that Brouwer and van Craesbeeck got to know each other during this time. Based on information provided by contemporary Flemish biographer Cornelis de Bie in his book &quot;Het Gulden Cabinet&quot; van Craesbeeck is believed to have become Brouwer&#x27;s pupil and best friend. Their relationship was described by de Bie as &quot;Soo d&#x27;oude songhen, soo pypen de jonghen&quot; (&quot;As the old ones sang, so the young ones chirp&quot;). The stylistic similarities of van Craesbeeck&#x27;s early work with that of Brouwer seem to corroborate such pupilage.

On 26 April 1634 Adriaen Brouwer took up lodgings in the house of the prominent engraver Paulus Pontius as the two men had become close friends. The same year the pair joined the local chamber of rhetoric Violieren. It has been suggested that Brouwer&#x27;s painting called &quot;Fat Man&quot; or &quot;Luxuria&quot; (Mauritshuis), which possibly represents the deadly sin of lust, is at the same time a portrait of Paulus Pontius.
Early biographers describe how Adriaen Brouwer and his artist friends spent much of their time in local taverns. Brouwer painted a tavern scene called &quot;The Smokers&quot;, which included a self-portrait together with portraits of Jan Cossiers, Jan Lievens, Joos van Craesbeeck and Jan Davidsz. de Heem (c. 1636, Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York). The company of friends is shown sitting around a table and smoking. Brouwer is the figure in the middle who is turned around to face the viewer. This type of group portrait doubled as a representation of one of the five senses (in this case the sense of taste).

Despite his reported dissolute lifestyle and his preference for low-life subjects, Brouwer was highly respected by his colleagues as evidenced by the fact that Rubens owned 17 works by Brouwer at the time of his death, of which at least one had been acquired before Rubens got to know Brouwer personally. Rembrandt and Titus van Rijn also had paintings by Brouwer in his collection.

In 1635 Brouwer took on Jan-Baptist Dandoy (active 1631–1638) as his only officially registered pupil. In January 1638 Adriaen Brouwer died in Antwerp. Some early biographers associated his early death with his party lifestyle and abuse of alcohol. Houbraken, however, attributes his death to the plague. Evidence for the latter is that originally his remains were buried in a common grave. A month after his death on 1 February 1638, his body was re-interred in the Carmelite Church of Antwerp after a solemn ceremony and at the initiative and expense and in the presence of his artist friends.

==Work==

===General===
Brouwer left a small body of work amounting to about 60 works. Just a few of his works are signed, while none is dated. As Brouwer was widely copied, imitated and followed in his time, attributions of work to Brouwer are sometimes uncertain or contested. For instance, &quot;The Smoker&quot; (Louvre) showing a man exhaling smoke while holding a bottle of liquor was attributed for a long time to Brouwer, but is now given to Brouwer&#x27;s follower and, possibly, pupil Joos van Craesbeeck.

The principal subject matter of Brouwer are genre scenes with peasants, soldiers and other &quot;lower class&quot; individuals engaging in drinking, smoking, card or dice playing, fights etc. often set in taverns or rural settings. Brouwer also contributed to the development of the genre of tronies, i.e. head or facial studies, which investigate varieties of expression. He produced a few landscapes in the final years of his career. Brouwer&#x27;s compositions are nearly all executed in small format.

Brouwer was influenced by Dirck Hals, a genre painter who was active in Haarlem. Brouwer&#x27;s stylistic development cannot be traced with certainty. Pictures in bright natural colours are believed to have been painted in the 1620s. Around 1630, Brouwer&#x27;s palette started showing a strong preference for browns, greys and greens. The painter had a free, sketchy manner of painting and applied paint thinly.

===Genre scenes===

In his genre scenes Brouwer depicted peasants, soldiers and other &quot;lower class&quot; individuals engaging in various forms of vices such as drinking, smoking, card or dice playing, brawls etc. often set in taverns or rural settings. The sole purpose of his compositions often appears to be the representation of the essence of the vice.

It is still contested whether he intended to convey any moral message. He gradually appears to have concentrated more on the expressions of his subjects going through the emotions of pain, anger, disgust and joy. This is particularly clear in his many paintings of tavern brawls, such as the &quot;Brawl Between Peasants&quot; and &quot;Brawling Card Players&quot; (both in the Alte Pinakothek, Munich). These compositions depict how rage in its varying stages and degrees is reflected in the facial expressions of the persons having an argument. Brouwer does not appear to denounce these outbreaks of anger as a Christian sin but as an expression of a lack of self-control. This view may have come from ethical ideas of Seneca the Younger that were formulated as neostoicism by Justus Lipsius, and generally accepted in Antwerp&#x27;s humanist circle of which Brouwer formed part.

===Portraits and tronies===
Adriaen Brouwer is regarded as an important innovator of portrait painting, a prominent genre in Netherlandish art.
His most famous group portrait is set in a tavern and is referred to as &quot;The Smokers&quot; (, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, in New York City). Despite the modern title, the scene is a group portrait of fellow artists of Adriaen Brouwer who resided in Antwerp. Not all of them have been identified with certainty. Brouwer is the second figure on the left who is turned towards the viewer. He has his eyes wide open, holds a beer jug in his right hand and puffs out smoke from his pipe. The figure on the far right has been identified as Jan Davidsz. de Heem. The other artists have not been identified with certainty but it has been suggested that Jan Lievens is the person on the far left, Joos van Craesbeeck the person in the middle and Jan Cossiers the second person on the right. This group portrait is regarded as belonging to the type of the &quot;friendship portrait&quot;. Similar friendship portraits that include a self-portrait had been created before by Rubens in his &quot;Self-Portrait in a Circle of Friends from Mantua&quot; and by Simon de Vos in the group portrait of himself with Johan Geerlof and Jan Cossiers referred to as &quot;Gathering of Smokers and Drinkers&quot;. While the latter two friendship portraits were fairly conventional, Brouwer innovated the type in &quot;The Smokers&quot;. He achieved this by expanding the portraits to full-length portraits, setting the scene in a tavern, the expressiveness of the faces and the nonchalant demeanour and clothing of the sitters. The dynamism of the composition brings the group portrait closer to Brouwer&#x27;s tavern scenes than to contemporary portrait paintings. The portrait &quot;The Smokers&quot; falls also into the genre of the &quot;dissolute&quot; artist portraits that took root in Dutch and Flemish genre painting in the 17th century. The genre was an inversion of the Renaissance ideal of the &quot;pictor doctus&quot;: the artist as an intellectual and gentleman. This ideal was replaced by the new model of the prodigal artist who is characterized by his creative inspiration and talents. These (self-)portraits emphasized the artists&#x27; dissolute nature by creating associations with traditional moral themes such as the &quot;Five Senses&quot;, the &quot;Seven Deadly Sins&quot; and the &quot;Prodigal Son in the Tavern&quot;. In &quot;The Smokers&quot; Bouwers depicted the sense of taste. 
Brouwer played an important role in the development of the genre of the &quot;tronie&quot;. The term tronie typically refers to figure studies not intended to depict an identifiable person, but rather to investigate varieties of expression. As such tronies are a form of genre painting in a portrait format. Adriaen Brouwer contributed to the genre as he had a talent for expressiveness. His work gave a face to lower-class figures by infusing their images with recognizable and vividly expressed human emotions—anger, joy, pain, and pleasure. His &quot;Youth Making a Face&quot; (c. 1632/1635, National Gallery of Art) shows a young man with a satirical and mocking gesture which humanises him, however uninviting he may appear. Brouwer&#x27;s vigorous application of paint in this composition, with his characteristically short, unmodulated brushstrokes, increases the dramatic effect.

Genre painters often returned to the old theme of the allegory of the five senses and created series of tronies depicting the five senses or the seven deadly sins. Brouwer also painted a number of genre portraits that represent the five senses or the seven deadly sins. An example is the painting called &quot;Fat Man&quot; or &quot;Luxuria&quot; (Mauritshuis), which is believed to be a portrait of Paulus Pontius as well as a representation of the deadly sin of lust (&quot;luxuria&quot; in Latin).

===Landscapes===
Brouwer painted a few late landscapes in addition to his rural scenes. They are atmospheric and painted with a loose touch. These landscapes were influential on other landscape painters such as Lodewijk de Vadder whose &quot;Extensive Dune Landscape With Travelers and a Dog On a Path Alongside an Inlet&quot; clearly draws inspiration from Brouwer&#x27;s &quot;Dune Landscape by Moonlight&quot; (Gemäldegalerie, Berlin).

==Influence==
Brouwer influenced a large number of Flemish and Dutch painters including Adriaen van Ostade and his brother Isak, Cornelis Saftleven, David Teniers the Younger, Joos van Craesbeeck, David Ryckaert, Gillis van Tilborch, Mattheus van Helmont, Hendrik Martenszoon Sorgh, Horatius Bollongier, Giacomo Francesco Cipper, Daniël Boone and Joseph Danhauser.

==In literature==
In &quot;Fisher&#x27;s Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1837&quot;, Letitia Elizabeth Landon published a poem entitled &quot;A Dutch Interior&quot; based on Brouwer&#x27;s painting &quot;Peasants playing cards in an Inn&quot;.

<doc id="761250" wikidata="Q1071252" url="?curid=761250" title="Chevrolet Omega">
<text>The Chevrolet Omega is an executive car sold by Chevrolet for the Brazilian market. Replacing the Chevrolet Opala, which was a development of the Opel Rekord C, the original Chevrolet Omega was based on the Opel Omega A and built locally between 1992 and 1998. After 1999, local production ceased, and General Motors do Brasil imported badge engineered versions of the Holden Commodore from Australia.

== Omega A ==
Based on the Opel Omega A, the Chevrolet Omega A debuted in Brazil in 1992 with a choice of two engines—a 2.0-liter four-cylinder (GLS and GL trim) and 3.0-liter six-cylinder (CD trim). From 1995, following the discontinuation of Omega A in Germany, the engines were upgraded to a 2.2-liter four (GLS) and a Chevrolet straight-six engine (CD) as used in the previous GM Opala albeit tuned by Lotus and with electronic multiport fuel injection added. Both sedan and station wagon (called Omega Suprema) body styles were available. The station wagon shared the exact powertrain configuration and trim options with the sedan versions. Some funeral parlor owners chose the Omega Suprema as their preferred car for hearse-based modifications.

In addition to the bigger engines, suited to local gasoline quality, General Motors do Brasil had also deemed it necessary to beef up the suspension of the Omega to deal with Brazilian road conditions. The CD version was offered the availability of the &quot;4L30-E&quot; automatic transmission as an option.


== Omega B ==

In October 1998, with the Chevrolet Omega B, General Motors do Brasil ceased local production in favor of a rebadged version of the Holden Calais (VT) sedan imported from Australia (as would be the case for Middle East bound models, instead badged Chevrolet Lumina).

The Brazilian model sold in a single &quot;CD&quot; specification, based on the Holden Calais powered by the &quot;Ecotec&quot; 3.8-liter V6 engine developing . The VT II model came to Brazil in December 1999.

On 18 May 2001, GM announced that the Omega CD would now be based on the VX Calais, designed and manufactured in Australia. Although based on the Holden Calais, the Brazilian model instead featured the trunk lid from VX series base models (whose tail lamps did not extend into the trunk lid).

The next update was announced by GM on 28 April 2003, with the Omega CD now based on the VY Calais, again in a single &quot;CD&quot; specification.

GM announced a final update of Omega B on 9 March 2005, now based on the Holden VZ series, powered by the new 3.6-liter &quot;Alloytec&quot; V6 engine. It was again sold in a single &quot;CD&quot; specification-specification CD model, this time based on the VZ Berlina with some extra equipment from the VZ Calais. Sales ended in 2007 with the arrival of the new Omega C.
== Omega C ==
For the third generation Chevrolet Omega C, General Motors again looked to Holden. The new model was announced on 4 July 2007, was now based on a rebadged Holden Berlina (VE). It was again powered by the 3.6-liter &quot;Alloytec&quot; V6 engine. Due to the global financial crisis, imports ceased in 2008.

=== Facelift ===
The Omega was re-released in September 2010. The first 600 models were sold as the &quot;Omega Fittipaldi Edition&quot;, named after the homonymous 1970s Brazilian Formula One World Champion. The new Omega&#x27;s specifications now reflected those of the Australian Holden Calais (VE Series II), except for specially tuned suspension settings for Brazil&#x27;s road conditions. Imports ceased after 2011 with no further Holden-based products being sold in Brazil since.

<text>Quincy D. Watts (born June 19, 1970) is an American former athlete, and two time gold medalist at the 1992 Summer Olympics.

==Career==
Born in Detroit, Michigan, Quincy Watts attended the University of Southern California (USC) where he excelled as a general athlete and a wide receiver on the college football team. He took up track at Sutter Middle School and later went to Taft High School in Woodland Hills, California, a neighborhood in Los Angeles. In 1987, he ran a 10.36s 100 m, which stands as the Los Angeles city section record, and at the time was the second fastest in CIF history, behind only Henry Thomas&#x27; 10.25 in 1985. That same year he repeated as the 200 meters Champion at the CIF California State Championships in Sacramento.

Watts began as a short sprinter, specializing for 100 m and 200 m, but the USC coach Jim Bush, convinced him to run 400 m, where he found his success.

In 1992, by far his most successful year, he won the gold medal in the Olympic 400 m. He twice broke Lee Evans&#x27; Olympic record of 43.86, (set at altitude during the 1968 games in Mexico), clocking 43.71 in his semi-final, before going on to record 43.50 in the final. As of August 2024, this is still the track record for Barcelona and the secondfastest time run in Spain. He was a member of the 4 × 400 m relay team, running the second leg in 43.10, which smashed the then-world record in a time of 2:55.74.

At the World Championships in 1991, Watts won a silver medal in 4x400 relay, which he turned to gold in the following championships in 1993 running the second leg on the team that took almost a second and a half off the then-World Record he had been a part of the year before. That race time still stands as the World Record. In the 1993 Individual 400m Final, where Watts was expecting to challenge the time of his relay teammates Michael Johnson and Butch Reynolds, his custombuilt Nike shoe disintegrated as he was coming off the final turn. Continuing to run, he still managed fourth place. Since this incident, poor Nike shoe quality has been referred to as &quot;doing the Quincy Watts&quot; in track circles. It has also affected Nike&#x27;s concern for quality control.

In 1994 and 1995, he failed to break 45 seconds and in 1996 finished a disappointing seventh in the US Olympic trials in a time of 45.64. Overshadowed by Michael Johnson, he retired in 1997 and was hired as the head coach at Taft High School. After his tenure at Taft, he worked as an assistant track coach at Harvard-Westlake School. Watts currently serves as an assistant coach for the Men&#x27;s and Women&#x27;s sprints teams at the University of Southern California. In addition to his coaching responsibilities, he also trains several professional athletes, including Willie McGinest and Curtis Conway. Notably, Conway was a high school competitor of Watts.

Watts currently holds the position of head coach at USC.

<text>Niclas, Graf von Abensberg (1441 – 28 February 1485) was a knight and nobleman under the reign of Louis IX, Duke of Bavaria.
Originating from an old family of considerable means ruling at Abensberg (Bavaria), Niclas came as a young man to the Court of Louis IX in Landshut. He excelled in the battle of Singen in 1462 and participated in most tournaments. He was assigned the tenures of Graisbach, Riedenburg and Kelheim.

In the dispute among the sons of Albert III, Duke of Bavaria, Niclas took side for the elder son Duke Albert IV and arrested the younger Duke Christof while he was bathing. The quarrel was settled, but reemerged fourteen years later. Once more, Niclas led the troops of Albrecht IV, conquering Päl, Weilheim and Landsberg without meeting resistance. However, as Niclas and the other noblemen returned home, they were ambushed by Duke Christof. Niclas was dismounted from his saddle and surrendered, but was stabbed by a varlet and died.

As Niclas was childless, he was the last of the family of von Abensberg.

<doc id="761263" wikidata="Q365870" url="?curid=761263" title="Antifuse">
<text>An antifuse is an electrical device that performs the opposite function to a fuse. Whereas a fuse starts with a low resistance and is designed to permanently break or open an electrically conductive path (typically when the current through the path exceeds a specified limit), an antifuse starts with a high resistance—an open circuit—and programming it converts it into a permanent electrically conductive path (typically when the voltage across the antifuse exceeds a certain level). This technology has many applications. Antifuses are best known for their use in mini-light (or miniature) style low-voltage Christmas tree lights. 

==Christmas tree lights==
Low-voltage lights cannot handle the full voltage typical to a residential circuit and are wired in series, unlike the larger, traditional, C7 and C9 style lights which are wired in parallel and are rated to operate directly at mains/residential voltage. Since a blown bulb in a series circuit would open the entire circuit, a series string would be rendered inoperable by a single lamp failing.

Because of this, each bulb has an antifuse installed within it, normally as an internal shunt wire. When the bulb blows, the entire mains voltage is applied across the single blown lamp. This rapidly causes the antifuse to short out the blown bulb, allowing the series circuit to resume functioning, albeit with a larger proportion of the mains voltage now applied to each of the remaining lamps. The antifuse is made using wire with a high resistance coating and this wire is coiled over the two vertical filament support wires inside the bulb. The insulation of the antifuse wire withstands the ordinary low voltage imposed across a functioning lamp but rapidly breaks down under the full mains voltage, giving the antifuse action. 

As more bulbs fail in the string, a higher and higher voltage is applied across the remaining bulbs. Often a special bulb with no antifuse and often a slightly different rating (so it blows first as the voltage gets too high) known as a &quot;fuse bulb&quot; is incorporated into the string of lights to protect against the possibility of severe overcurrent if too many bulbs fail.

==Antifuses in integrated circuits==
Antifuses are widely used to permanently program integrated circuits. Antifuses may be used in programmable read-only memory (PROM). Each bit contains both a fuse and an anti-fuse and is programmed by triggering one of the two. This programming, performed after manufacturing, is permanent and irreversible and is a means of achieving what is referred to as &quot;one-time programming&quot; (OTP).

Certain programmable logic devices (PLDs), such as structured ASICs, use fuse technology to configure logic circuits and create a customized design from a standard IC design. Antifuse PLDs are one-time programmable in contrast to other PLDs that are SRAM-based and which may be reprogrammed to fix logic bugs or add new functions. Antifuse PLDs have advantages over SRAM-based PLDs in that like ASICs, they do not need to be configured each time power is applied. They may be less susceptible to alpha particles which can cause circuits to malfunction. Also, circuits built via the antifuse&#x27;s permanent conductive paths may be faster than similar circuits implemented in PLDs using SRAM technology.

===Dielectric antifuses===
Dielectric anti-fuses employ a very thin oxide barrier between a pair of conductors. Formation of the conductive channel is performed by a dielectric breakdown forced by a high-voltage pulse. Dielectric antifuses are usually employed in CMOS and BiCMOS processes as the required oxide layer thickness is lower than those available in bipolar processes.

===Amorphous silicon antifuses===
One approach for the ICs that use antifuse technology employs a thin barrier of non-conducting amorphous silicon between two metal conductors. When a sufficiently high voltage is applied across the amorphous silicon it is turned into a polycrystalline silicon-metal alloy with a low resistance, which is conductive.

Amorphous silicon is a material usually not used in either bipolar or CMOS processes and requires an additional manufacturing step.

The antifuse is usually triggered using an approximately 5 mA current. With a poly-diffusion antifuse, the high current density creates heat, which melts a thin insulating layer between polysilicon and diffusion electrodes, creating a permanent resistive silicon link.

===Zener antifuses===
Zener diodes can be used as antifuses. The p-n junction that serves as such a diode is overloaded with a current spike and overheated. At temperatures above 100 °C and current densities above 105 A/cm2 the metallization undergoes electromigration and forms spikes through the junction, shorting it out; this process is known as Zener zap in the industry. The spike is formed on and slightly below the silicon surface, just below the passivation layer without damaging it. The conductive shunt therefore does not compromise the integrity and reliability of the semiconductor device. Typically a few-millisecond pulse at 100-200 mA is sufficient for common bipolar devices, for a non-optimized antifuse structure; specialized structures will have lower power demands. The resulting resistance of the junction is in the range of 10 ohms.

Zener zap is frequently employed in mixed-signal circuits for trimming values of analog components. For example a precision resistor can be manufactured by forming several series resistors with Zeners in parallel (oriented to be nonconductive during normal operation of the device) and then shorting selected Zeners to shunt the unwanted resistors. By this approach, it is possible only to lower the value of the resulting resistor. It is therefore necessary to shift the manufacturing tolerances so that the lowest-value typically made is equal to or larger than the desired value. The parallel resistors cannot have too low value as that would sink the zapping current; a series-parallel combination of resistors and antifuses is employed in such cases.

==Street-lighting (obsolete)==
In a similar fashion to that of Christmas tree lights, before the advent of high-intensity discharge lamps, street light circuits using incandescent light bulbs were often operated as high-voltage series circuits. Each individual street-lamp was equipped with a &quot;film cutout&quot;; a small disk of insulating film that separated two contacts connected to the two wires leading to the lamp. In the same fashion as with the Christmas lights described above, if the lamp failed, the entire voltage of the street lighting circuit (thousands of volts) was imposed across the insulating film in the cutout, causing it to rupture. In this way, the failed lamp was bypassed and illumination restored to the rest of the street.

Unlike Christmas lights, the circuit usually contained an automatic device to regulate the electric current flowing in the circuit, such as a constant-current transformer. As each series lamp burned out and was shorted out, the AC current regulator reduced the voltage, which kept each remaining bulb operating at its normal voltage, current, brightness, and life expectancy. When the failed lamp was finally replaced, a new piece of film was also installed, again separating the electrical contacts in the cutout. This style of street lighting was recognizable by the large porcelain insulator that separated the lamp and reflector from the light&#x27;s mounting arm; the insulator was necessary because the two contacts in the lamp&#x27;s base may have routinely operated at a potential of several thousands of volts above ground/earth.

The same mechanism (a film-disc cutout) is used broadly in applications where series lighting is desired, such as airfield runway and taxiway lights.

<text>Jill Corey (born Norma Jean Speranza; September 30, 1935 – April 3, 2021) was an American popular standards singer. She was discovered and signed on one day when she was 17. She went on to have her own radio shows and to star in a feature film.

==Biography==
Italian-American, Corey was born in Avonmore, Pennsylvania, a coal mining community about forty miles east of Pittsburgh. Her father, Bernard Speranza, was a coal miner, and she was the youngest of five children. Her mother died when she was four years old.

She was a 1953 graduate of Bell-Avon High School. Corey began singing as an imitator of Carmen Miranda at family gatherings, on amateur shows in grade school, and contralto in the local church choir. At the age of 13, she began to develop her own style. She won first prize at a talent contest sponsored by the Lions Club, which entitled her to sing a song on WAVL in Apollo, Pennsylvania. This got her an offer to have her own program. By the age of 14 she was working seven nights a week, earning $5-$6 a night, with a local orchestra led by Johnny Murphy. By the age of 17 she was a local celebrity talent.
At the home of the only owner of a tape recorder in town, with trains going by in the background and no accompaniment, she made a tape recording to demonstrate her singing skills to the outside show business world. The tape came to the attention of Mitch Miller, who headed the artists &amp; repertory section at Columbia Records. He normally received over 100 record demos a week, and this one, with a 17-year-old girl and its train background, would not have been likely to gain his attention. 
He telephoned her in Avonmore, and the next morning she flew to New York to be heard by Miller in a more normal studio setting. Miller had &quot;Life Magazine&quot; send over reporters and photographers, and had her audition with Arthur Godfrey and Dave Garroway. The &quot;Life&quot; photographers reenacted her signing a contract with Columbia, and all this happened in a single day, with her headed back to Avonmore that night.

Both Garroway and Godfrey called her, and it was her choice to pick one; she picked Garroway, who took the name Jill Corey out of a telephone book. Within six weeks the &quot;Life&quot; article, with a cover picture and seven pages, came out. Jill Corey became the youngest star ever at the Copacabana nightclub, where she was hit on by Frank Sinatra, and had numerous hit records. Even so, in May 1956, Billboard described Corey as a performer who &quot;hasn&#x27;t made it big&quot; despite the amount of publicity she received.

Corey was a regular on the television variety programs &quot;Robert Q&#x27;s Matinee&quot; (1950–1956) &quot;The Dave Garroway Show&quot; (1953–1954), and the 1958–1959 version of &quot;Your Hit Parade&quot;. She was co-host of &quot;Music on Ice&quot;, a variety program on NBC (1960).

She also worked on television with Ed Sullivan. In 1956 she became a regular on Johnny Carson&#x27;s CBS-network comedy-variety show from California. In addition, she had her own syndicated radio and television shows, like &quot;The Jill Corey Show&quot; hosted by the National Guard Bureau, the &quot;Jill Corey Sings&quot; radio show, and episodes of &quot;Stop the Music&quot; radio show. She also appeared at a Delta Gamma gathering in 1957, where she sang and greeted guests. She is known for her cover of a French song, &quot;Let It Be Me&quot;, in 1957 for Columbia Records and her 1956 song, &quot;Egghead&quot;, which focuses on &quot;failed masculinity&quot; of an egghead. In 1959 she starred in a feature-length musical film for Columbia Pictures, entitled &quot;Senior Prom&quot;, which was co-produced by Moe Howard of The Three Stooges.

A two-CD compilation of her complete singles was released in June 2015 by Jasmin Records.

==Personal life and death==
Corey suspended her career to marry Pittsburgh Pirates third baseman Don Hoak on December 28, 1961, in Pittsburgh. They had a daughter, Clare. Hoak died of a heart attack at age 41 after they had been married eight years. She then resumed her career in New York City.

Following the death of Hoak, she starred in plays on and off Broadway including &quot;Annie Get Your Gun&quot;, &quot;Sweet Charity&quot;, and played to a sold out crowd at Carnegie Hall in 1989.

An Associated Press article published in February 1973 pointed out the difficulties that Corey faced in attempting a comeback. &quot;Today I don&#x27;t know how to audition, how to get people interested in booking me,&quot; she said. Determined to succeed, she said, &quot;Somehow, I&#x27;m going to find a way to tell people I&#x27;m back, and that I want to sing.&quot;

Corey died on April 3, 2021, from septic shock in Shadyside Hospital, Shadyside (Pittsburgh), Pennsylvania, at age 85.

<text>Adriaen van Ostade (baptized as Adriaen Jansz Hendricx 10 December 1610 – buried 2 May 1685) was a Dutch Golden Age painter of genre works, showing everyday life of ordinary men and women.

==Life==

According to Arnold Houbraken, he and his brother were pupils of Frans Hals and like him, spent most of their lives in Haarlem. He thought they were &quot;Lubekkers&quot; by birth, though this has since found to be false.
He was the eldest son of Jan Hendricx Ostade, a weaver from the hamlet of Ostade near Eindhoven. Although Adriaen and his brother Isaack were born in Haarlem, they adopted the name &quot;van Ostade&quot; as painters. According to the RKD, he became a pupil in 1627 of the portrait painter Frans Hals, at that time the master of Jan Miense Molenaer. In 1632, he is registered in Utrecht (where, like Jacob Duck, he was probably influenced by the village scenes of Joost Cornelisz Droochsloot, which were popular in his day), but in 1634 he was back in Haarlem where he joined the Haarlem Guild of St. Luke. Aged 26, he joined a company of the civic guard at Haarlem, and at twenty-eight he married. His wife died two years later in 1640. In 1657, &quot;as a widower&quot;, he married Anna Ingels. He again became a widower in 1666. He opened a workshop and took on pupils. His notable pupils were Cornelis Pietersz Bega, Cornelis Dusart, Jan de Groot, Frans de Jongh, Michiel van Musscher, Isaac van Ostade, Evert Oudendijck, and Jan Steen.

In 1662 and again in 1663, he is registered as deacon of the St. Luke guild in Haarlem. In the rampjaar (1672), he packed up his goods with the intention of fleeing to Lübeck, which is why Houbraken felt he had family there. He got as far as Amsterdam, however, when he was convinced to stay by the art collector Konstantyn Sennepart, in whose house he stayed, and where he made a series of colored drawings, that were later bought for 1300 florins (along with some drawings by Gerrit Battem) by , where Houbraken saw them and fell in love with his portrayals of village life. Jonas Witsen (1676–1715) was the man who convinced Houbraken to move to Amsterdam from Dordrecht. He had been the city secretary and was probably his patron. His successor, Johan van Schuylenburgh, who became city secretary in 1712, was the man to whom Houbraken dedicated the first volume of his &quot;Schouburg&quot;.

==Work==
Ostade was the contemporary of the Flemish painters David Teniers the Younger and Adriaen Brouwer. Like them, he spent his life in delineation of ordinary life, depicting tavern scenes, village fairs and country quarters. Between Teniers and Ostade the contrast lies in the different condition of the agricultural classes of Brabant and Holland and in the atmosphere and dwellings peculiar to each region. Brabant has more sun and more comfort; Teniers, in consequence, is silvery and sparkling, and the people he paints are fair specimens of their culture. Holland, in the vicinity of Haarlem, seems to have suffered much from war; the air is moist and hazy, and the people depicted by Ostade are short and ill-favoured, marked with adversity&#x27;s stamp in feature and dress.

Brouwer, who painted the peasant in his frolics and passions, brought more of the spirit of Frans Hals into his depictions than did his colleague; but the type is the same as Ostade&#x27;s. During the first years of his career, Ostade tended toward the same exaggeration and frolic as his comrade, though he is distinguished from his rival by a more general use of light and shade, especially a greater concentration of light on a small surface in contrast with a broad expanse of gloom. The key of his harmonies remained for a time in the scale of greys, but his treatment is dry and careful in a style which shuns no difficulties of detail. He shows us the cottages, inside and out: vine leaves cloak the poverty of the outer walls; indoors, nothing decorates the patchwork of rafters and thatch, the tumble-down chimneys and the ladder staircases, the rustic Dutch home of those days. The greatness of Ostade lies in how often he caught the poetic side of the peasant class in spite of its coarseness. He gave the magic light of a sun-gleam to their lowly sports, their quarrels, even their quieter moods of enjoyment; he clothed the wreck of the cottages with colourful vegetation.

It was natural, given the tendency to effect which marked Ostade from the first, that he should have been fired by emulation to rival the masterpieces of Rembrandt. His early pictures are not so rare but that we can trace how he glided from one period to the other. Before the dispersal of the collection at Vienna in 1872, it was easy to study the steel-grey harmonies, the exaggerated caricature of his early works between 1632 and 1638. There is a picture in the Vienna Gallery of a &quot;Countryman Having his Tooth Drawn&quot;, unsigned, and painted about 1632; a &quot;Bagpiper&quot; of 1635 in the Liechtenstein Gallery at Vienna; cottage scenes of 1635 and 1636 in the museums of Karlsruhe, Darmstadt, and Dresden; and the &quot;Card Players&quot; of 1637 in the Liechtenstein palace at Vienna, making up for the loss of the Gsell collection. The same style marks most of those pieces.

About 1638 or 1640, the influence of Rembrandt suddenly changed his style. He painted the &quot;Annunciation&quot; of the Brunswick Museum: angels, appearing in the sky to Dutch boors half-asleep amidst their cattle, sheep and dogs in front of a cottage, recall at once the similar subject by Rembrandt, who effectively lighted the principal groups by rays propelled to earth from a murky sky. Ostade, however, did not succeed here in giving dramatic force and expression; his shepherds were without much emotion, passion or surprise. His picture was an effect of light, and masterly as such, in its sketchy rubbings of dark brown tone relieved by strongly impasted lights, but without the very qualities which made his usual subjects attractive.

In 1642 he painted the beautiful interior at the Louvre: a mother tending her cradled child, her husband sitting nearby, beside a great chimney; the darkness of a country loft dimly illumined by a sunbeam shining on the casement. One might think the painter intended to depict the Nativity; but there is nothing holy in the surroundings, nothing attractive, indeed, except the wonderful Rembrandtesque transparency, the brownish tone, and the admirable keeping of the minutest parts. Ostade was more at home in a similar effect applied to the commonplace incident of the &quot;Slaughtering of a Pig&quot;, one of the masterpieces of 1643, and once in the Gsell collection. In this and similar subjects of the previous and succeeding years, he returned to the homely themes in which his power and wonderful observation had made him a master. He does not seem to have gone back to gospel illustrations until 1667, when he produced an admirable &quot;Nativity&quot; which is only surpassed in arrangement and colour by Rembrandt&#x27;s &quot;Carpenter&#x27;s Family&quot; at the Louvre, or by the &quot;Woodcutter and Children&quot; in the gallery of Cassel. Almost innumerable are the more familiar themes to which he devoted his brush during this interval: from small single figures, representing smokers or drinkers, to allegories of the five senses (Hermitage and Brunswick galleries), half-lengths of fishmongers and bakers, cottage brawls, scenes of gambling, itinerant players and quacks, and ninepins players in the open air.
The humor in some of these pieces is contagious, as in the &quot;Tavern Scene&quot; of the La Caze Collection (Louvre, 1653). His art may be studied in the large series of dated pieces which adorn every European capital from Saint Petersburg to London. Buckingham Palace has a large number, and many a good specimen lies hidden in private collections in England. Should we select a few as peculiarly worthy of attention, we might point to the &quot;Rustics in a Tavern&quot; of 1662 at The Hague, the &quot;Village School&quot; of the same year at the Louvre, the &quot;Tavern Court-yard&quot; of 1670 at Cassel, the &quot;Sportsmen&#x27;s Rest&quot; of 1671 at Amsterdam, and the &quot;Fiddler and his Audience&quot; of 1673 at the Hague.

At Amsterdam we have the likeness of a painter, sitting with his back to the spectator, at his easel. The colour-grinder is at work in a corner, a pupil prepares a palette, and a black dog sleeps on the ground. A replica of this picture, with the date 1666, is in the Dresden gallery. Both depictions are supposed to represent Ostade himself, but unfortunately we see the artist&#x27;s back and not his face. In an etching (Bartsch, 32), the painter shows himself in profile at work on a canvas. Two of his latest dated works, the &quot;Village Street&quot; and the &quot;Skittle Players&quot;, noteworthy items in the Ashburton and Ellesmere collections, were executed in 1676 without any sign of declining powers. He died in 1685 in Haarlem.

==Legacy==
The number of Ostade&#x27;s pictures was given by the art dealer John Smith at 385, but by Hofstede de Groot (1910) at over 900. At his death, the stock of his unsold pieces was over 200. His engraved plates were put up to auction with the pictures. Fifty etched plates, most of them dated 1647–1648, were disposed of in 1686. there are 220 of his pictures in public and private collections, of which 104 are signed and dated, while seventeen are signed with the name but not with the date. The prices which Ostade received are not known; but pictures which were worth £40 in 1750 were worth £1,000 a century later, and Earl Dudley gave £4,120 for a cottage interior in 1876.

The signatures of Ostade vary at different periods, but the first two letters are generally interlaced. Up to 1635, Ostade writes himself Ostaden, e.g. in the &quot;Bagpiper&quot; of 1635 in the Liechtenstein collection at Vienna. Later on, he uses the long s (ſ), and occasionally he signs in capital letters. His pupils are his own brother Isaack, Cornelis Bega, Cornelis Dusart, and Richard Brakenburg.

<text>Karl Friedrich von Steinmetz (27 December 1796 – 2 August 1877) was a Prussian &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot;. He was born at Eisenach and joined the army of Prussia during the War of Liberation. Over the Seven Weeks&#x27; War he led the V Corps against Austria and became known as the &quot;Lion of Nachod&quot; for his victories as the Battles of Nachod, Skalitz, and Schweinschädel. Steinmetz commanded one of three armies assembled on the Rhine for the Franco-Prussian War, during which he quarreled with Prince Friedrich Karl. After the war he retired.

==Early life and Napoleonic Wars==
Steinmetz was born at Eisenach on 27 December 1796 and was educated at the cadet school of Stolp in Pomerania from 1807 to 1811, in the midst of the misery and poverty caused by the French occupation. He showed great ability in military education. At the outbreak of the War of Liberation he and his elder brother made their way through the French positions to Breslau, where they were at once appointed to the army, the elder as ensign on probation, the younger to the substantive rank of second lieutenant. After a vain attempt to transfer to the Blücher Hussars, a regiment he had an intense boyish admiration for when it was quartered at Stolp, he was ordered to report to General Ludwig von Yorck, who treated him and the other officers from Breslau with coldness, until Steinmetz asked about returning to the king who had sent him.

The brothers were in the hardest fighting of the campaign of 1813, the elder being killed at the Battle of Leipzig and the younger being wounded more than once. During the short halt on the Rhine he improved his military and general education. In the battles in France, he won the Iron Cross, Second Class. After the peace, he entered Paris only once, fearing to spend the ten ducats that sent monthly to his mother. For the same reason, he did not take part in the pleasures of his better-off comrades.

==Service in Prussia==
===Character and marriage===
Steinmetz&#x27;s avoidance of youthful excesses helped him overcome bad health and become physically vigorous, which he was to the end of his military career. His character as well as his physique was strengthened by his Spartan way of life, but his temperament was embittered by the circumstances which imposed this self-restraint. His poverty and want of influence were the more obvious as he was, shortly after the wars, assigned to the lowly 2nd Foot Guards, stationed in Berlin.

He rigorously devoted himself to study and his professional duties. From 1820 to 1824 he studied at the General War Academy, graduating from the course with distinction, and so was appointed to the topographical section of the general staff. General von Müffling reported that he was arrogant and resented encouragement, which he probably regarded as patronising, but that his ability would outdistance his comrades. Steinmetz was too poor to buy a good horse or a house, and he had to live in his regimental quarters. However, shortly after his marriage to his cousin Julie, the daughter of Lieutenant-General KKF von Steinmetz (1768–1837), gave him enough money to temper his resentment, since his father-in-law was generous to the young couple, and helped him get an appointment as captain at the Landwehr Guard at Potsdam. His brigade commander, General von Röder, was an excellent soldier, and Steinmetz often spoke of the thorough training he received.

===Garrison duty===
From 1830 his regimental work went on without incident in various garrisons, until in 1839 he was promoted to major given command of a battalion. In this position he had many differences with his superiors, for he urged strenuous training for the troops, in all seasons. However, his off-duty relationships were extremely cordial, thanks chiefly to the social gifts of his wife.

In 1848, he commanded a guard battalion during the disturbances in Berlin, but was not involved. The same year, he was sent to fight in the First Schleswig War. After the Battle of Schleswig, Wrangel, the commander-in-chief, told him that he had decided the battle. He distinguished himself again at Düppel, and Prince Wilhelm decorated him with the order &quot;Pour le Mérite&quot;.

On returning to Germany, he was given the difficult command of troops at Brandenburg during the sitting of a democratic popular convention there, troops known to be affected by the revolution. During the Olmütz-Bronnzell incident of 1850, he was military governor of Cassel. In 1851, he became colonel commandant of the cadet school of Berlin, where he reformed the prevailing system of instruction, the defects of which he had condemned as early as 1820. Though more than fifty years of age, he learned Latin and English to be a more competent instructor.

==General officer==
===1854-1864===
In 1854, after forty-one years of active service, he was promoted major-general. At Magdeburg, as at Berlin, his reforming zeal made him many enemies, and in October his youngest and only surviving child died at twenty-six, which affected him deeply. In 1857, he was posted to the command of a guard brigade at Berlin, and thence almost immediately to a divisional command in the I Corps. Early in 1858 he was promoted lieutenant-general, and for the five years that he held this command he devoted himself to cavalry. In 1863, learning that Adolf von Bonin, his senior by date of rank, but his junior in age and length of service, was to be appointed to the command of the I Corps, he considered retirement. However, when Bonin took command, Steinmetz was given command of the II Corps. Shortly afterwards, the crown prince of Prussia Frederick William took over II Corps and Steinmetz went to command the V Corps at Posen. Soon after this his wife died.

===Austro-Prussian War===
He was promoted to general of infantry in 1864, and led the V Corps in the Austro-Prussian War of 1866. It was part of the Second Army of Crown Prince Frederick William. On 26 June 1866 Steinmetz and his reinforced corps were ready to enter Austrian territory as the advance guard of the army&#x27;s left column. In the evening of that day the border was crossed on the road leading from Glatz to Bohemia via Reinerz. On the following day he encountered troops of Wilhelm von Ramming, the resulting Battle of Náchod ending in a Prussian victory. He likewise was victorious in the battles of Skalitz and Schweinschädel on the following days. His skillful and resolute leadership was displayed in three battles on three successive days. He later opened the way through the mountains in spite of Bonin&#x27;s defeat at Trautenau. In 1867, the &quot;Lion of Nachod&quot;, as he was popularly called, married Elise von Krosigk (who after his death married Count Bruhl). He was now, for the first time in his life, a fairly wealthy man, having been awarded a money grant for his brilliant services in 1866. About this time he was elected a member of the North German Confederation parliament.

===Franco-Prussian War===
At the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War in 1870, Steinmetz was appointed to command one of the three armies assembled on the Rhine, the others being led by Prince Frederick Charles and the crown prince. It was not long before serious differences arose between Steinmetz and Prince Frederick Charles. Steinmetz, embittered by his lifelong struggle against the influences of wealth and position, saw an order to clear the roads for the prince&#x27;s army as an attempt to crowd a humbler comrade out of the fighting, and various incidents.

On 6 August he led the First Army south from his position on the Moselle and moved straight toward the town of Spicheren, cutting off Prince Frederick Charles from his forward cavalry units in the process. There he encountered the French II Corps under Frossard, which was fortified between Spicheren and Forbach and was able to stall him until the German Second Army came to the aid of their compatriots and routed the French.

Eight days later he again encountered the French army at Borny-Colombey. At the Battle of Gravelotte he lost his temper and wasted his troops against a French superior position, nearly causing the defeat of the Prussian armies. After this he was relieved of command and sent home as governor-general of the V and VI Army Corps districts.

As a commander in the Franco-Prussian War and the Battle of Gravelotte, Steinmetz was mentioned a few times in Chapter IV of anti-war short story entitled &quot;Bartek The winner&quot;, written by Polish Nobel-awarded writer Henryk Sienkiewicz.

==Promotion to field marshal and later life==
In April 1871, he retired at his own request, but his great services were not forgotten when victory had softened animosities, and he was promoted to field marshal, given a pension of 2000 thalers and made a member of the upper chamber. In the spirit of loyalty which had guided his whole career, he made no attempt to justify his conduct in 1870. His life in retirement was quiet and happy, and he remained healthy to the last. He died at Bad Landeck on 2 August 1877.

==Honours and awards==
The 37th Fusiliers of the German army bore his name as part of their regimental title.

<text>Johann Ludwig Aberli (14 November 1723, Winterthur - 17 October 1786, Bern) was a Swiss painter and etcher.

==Biography==
He was born into a humble family. His father was a watchman. After completing his basic education, he became the student of a local artist named Heinrich Meyer. With his recommendation, in 1741, Aberli was accepted at the drawing school operated by . While studying there, he worked as a decorative painter.

In the mid-1740s, he and Philipp Hieronymus Brinckmann took a trip through the Bernese Oberland, which stimulated his interest in painting landscapes. In 1747, he married Christina Barbara Janss, from Saanen. They had only one daughter, who died young. That same year, he succeeded his former teacher Grimm as operator of the drawing school. He often took his students on trips to lake Geneva, Lake Biel, Lake Neuchâtel, and the Oberland.

He established his own workshop in the 1750s, together with a publishing company to issue his works. He also trained his employees, including the engraver, Adrian Zingg, and the vedutist, Samuel Hieronymus Grimm. In 1759, he took them to Paris, to study the Old Masters at the museums, and to show them the famous engraving workshop of Johann Georg Wille.

After returning from Paris, he had a small summer house built in Köniz and began collecting art. His greatest financial success came with copper engravings, but he also made a decent profit on his watercolours. In order to reproduce them, he developed an etching method that came to be known as the &quot;Aberlische Manier&quot;. 

In 1774, he travelled throughout the Jura Mountains with his colleague, Sigmund Freudenberger. He was visited by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, on his second trip to Switzerland in 1779.

He died at the age of sixty-two. His business operations were continued by the artist, , while the remainder of his estate was auctioned off. A street in Biel is named after him.

<doc id="761287" wikidata="Q7886041" url="?curid=761287" title="Union Square (Somerville)">
<text>Union Square is a neighborhood in the southeastern part of Somerville, Massachusetts, United States. It is centered on Union Square proper, which is located at the intersection of Washington Street, Webster Avenue, and Somerville Avenue.

The name &quot;Union Square&quot; comes from the square having been used as a recruitment and mustering site for the Union Army in the Civil War. A plaque commemorating the mustering site sits at the southwestern corner of the square between Somerville Avenue and Washington Street, and the Prospect Hill Monument is located several blocks away atop Prospect Hill. Union Square is now the commercial center of a primarily residential neighborhood with many restaurants, bars and neighborhood stores.

As the oldest and largest commercial area in the city, Union Square is home to a number of community institutions, including the Somerville Police headquarters, Somerville Community Access Television (SCATV), and Boston Free Radio.

==History==

===Sand Pit Square===
Union Square was Somerville&#x27;s earliest commercial district to develop when it was still a part of Charlestown. Early trade routes passed through the square and a tavern was built there as early as 1770. Originally called &quot;Sand Pit Square,&quot; the area&#x27;s sandy, clay pit-dotted pastures yielded a fine grade of silica used in glass and brick-making.

===American Revolution===
It was during the American Revolution that Union Square took center stage. Because of its location and height providing panoramic views and control of Charlestown, Somerville, and Cambridge, Prospect Hill had great strategic importance in the Revolutionary War and became known as the &quot;Citadel&quot;. The castle, dedicated in 1903, is a monument commemorating the fortifications atop the hill during that war. A tablet inside reads: &quot;This tablet is erected in memory of the soldiers of the Revolution and of the Civil War who encamped on Prospect Hill and of the banners under which they valiantly fought.&quot;

Somerville is one of several locales claiming to have hosted the first raising of the U.S. Flag, called the Grand Union Flag. Tradition claims that George Washington raised the flag on Prospect Hill on January 1, 1776, and a plaque on the hill indicates such. However, some scholars dispute these traditional accounts, concluding that the flag raised at Prospect Hill was probably a British Union Flag. Since a favorable surrender was then being offered to the rebelling colonists, the raising of a flag similar (or identical) to the Union Jack was briefly mistaken for a gesture of surrender.

===Industry growth===

In its early years, Somerville was an agricultural suburb, supplying the growing urban area surrounding Boston. For a time the Union Square area was known as Milk Row after the small farms surrounding it.

Union Square became a major commercial center during the early 19th century due to its location at an important crossroads. When the Warren Bridge opened to link Charlestown and Boston in 1828, it caused a considerable increase in traffic along Washington Street and Charlestown Lane (now Somerville Avenue). Railroad access began with the opening of the Fitchburg Railroad in 1843 and then opening of the Union Square railroad station just west of Webster Avenue. The Boynton Yards area south of the rail line and east of Union Square was created in 1874 when the swampy ground was filled with material from the top of Prospect Hill. It became a meat packing and manufacturing district, with a slaughterhouse, brickyard, glass shop, and later other industries.

After 1853, the square was known as Liberty Pole Square, in honor of the liberty pole erected there by anti-slavery firemen. In 1861 it was again renamed as Union Square as a pro-reunification gesture for the American Civil War and after the square&#x27;s Revolutionary War history.

In 1917, the first Marshmallow Fluff to be sold in stores was produced in Union Square. In honor of this, since 2006 an annual Somerville Fluff Festival has been held in Union Square.

Service to the Union Square railroad station ended in 1938, as some local stops on the Fitchburg Railroad were dropped due to competition from streetcars. By then, Union Square was well served, first by Boston Elevated Railway streetcars, then by buses.

===Commerce and gentrification===

Like much of Somerville, Union Square suffered economic decline in the 20th century as wealthy residents moved to more distant suburbs and manufacturing moved away from the area. The city began planning for a revitalization of Boynton Yards in the 1980s, including the construction of South Street to allow trucks to serve lots once only reachable by rail. The area proceeded to attract new manufacturing, including Taza Chocolate, several breweries, and other food companies. The city approved a cluster of four life sciences laboratory-office buildings (the first in Somerville), of which 101 South Street opened in 2022, 808 Windsor is expected to open in 2024.

With rents lower than nearby Cambridge, Union Square attracted new immigrant populations towards the end of the 20th century, including large groups of Brazilian, Punjabi, and Sikh residents. Many markets in the area are run by and cater to the various ethnic groups that live in and around Union Square.

Union Square&#x27;s location at the juncture of working-class East Somerville and the city&#x27;s tonier western sections have made it the focal point of changing demographics. More upscale cafes, bars, and restaurants have opened since the 1990s, bringing gentrification deeper into Somerville. Union Square Main Streets, a local development group, began running a Saturday morning farmers&#x27; market in 2005 as one of its first visible efforts in the square. A landscaped community garden with regularly scheduled concerts and artistic events sits just outside Union Square at the site of an old school.

==Transportation==

Union Square station on the MBTA Green Line, located on Prospect Street south of Union Square, opened on March 21, 2022, as part of the Green Line Extension project. East Somerville station, located on Washington Street east of the square, opened on December 12, 2022. Union Square is also a minor hub for MBTA bus service, with 5 routes passing through:

*85 Spring Hill–Kendall/M.I.T. station via Summer Street &amp; Union Square
*86 Sullivan station–Reservoir (Cleveland Circle) via Harvard/Johnston Gate
*87 Arlington Center or Clarendon Hill–Lechmere station via Somerville Avenue
*91 Sullivan Square station–Central Square via Washington Street

<text>Jagdish Natwarlal Bhagwati (born July 26, 1934) is an Indian-born naturalized American economist and one of the most influential trade theorists of his generation.
He is a University Professor of economics and law at Columbia University and a Senior Fellow in International Economics at the Council on Foreign Relations. He has made significant contributions to international trade theory and economic development.

He is widely regarded as the intellectual father of the Indian economic reforms of 1991. He is one of the few professors in American academia to have a chair named after him while he was still teaching at the university. He is one of only 10 scholars who hold the title of University Professor at Columbia University. Bhagwati is the recipient of several prestigious awards, including the Order of the Rising Sun, Padma Vibhushan, Frank Seidman Distinguished Award in Political Economy and the Freedom Prize of Switzerland.

In 2014, the &quot;Financial Times&quot; called him “one of the most outstanding economists of his generation never to have won the Nobel Prize”. This view is shared by his peers including Nobel Prize winning economist Paul Krugman, &quot;The crucial point for me is that people didn’t understand at all clearly how distortions in a trading economy relate to policy before Jagdish spelled it out. Once he did, it became so clear that it was hard to believe that someone had to point it out. In my view, that makes his work Nobel-worthy.&quot;

==Early years and personal life==
Bhagwati was born in 1934, into a Gujarati family in the Bombay Presidency during the British Raj. He is the son of Indian judge Natwarlal H. Bhagwati and the brother of P. N. Bhagwati, former Chief Justice of India and also of S.N. Bhagwati, an eminent neurosurgeon who served as the president of the Neurological Society of India.

Bhagwati attended St. Xavier’s High School and received a BCom from Sydenham College, Mumbai. He then traveled to England to study at St. John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, receiving a second BA at Cambridge (in economics) in 1956. Between 1957 and 1959 he studied at Nuffield College, Oxford. He received a PhD in economics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1967 for a thesis titled &quot;Essays in International Economics,&quot; supervised by Charles P. Kindleberger. He has also received honorary degrees from the University of Sussex and Erasmus University, as well as others.

Bhagwati is married to Padma Desai, also a Columbia economist and Russia specialist; they have one daughter. Bhagwati and Desai&#x27;s joint 1970 OECD study &quot;India: Planning for Industrialization&quot; was a notable contribution at the time.
==Career==
After completing his PhD, Bhagwati returned to India in 1961, first to teach briefly at the Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata, and then as professor of international trade at Delhi School of Economics at the University of Delhi, from 1962 to 1968. He then returned to American academia and from 1968 until 1980, Bhagwati was the Ford International Professor of Economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

From 1980 he taught economics at Columbia University, where he was Arthur Lehman Professor of Economics and Professor of Political Science and later University Professor, Economics and Law. He is one of only 10 scholars who hold the title of University Professor at Columbia University.

Bhagwati is a Senior Fellow of the Council on Foreign Relations in New York and is a Member of the National Academy of Sciences and the American Philosophical Society. He currently serves on the Academic Advisory Board of Human Rights Watch (Asia) and on the board of scholars of the Centre for Civil Society.

He has held several important positions internationally, including special adviser to the United Nations on globalization, economic policy adviser to Arthur Dunkel-the director-general of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and external adviser to the World Trade Organization. He has also worked as a member of group appointed by the director-general of the WTO on the future of the WTO.

He was also a member of the advisory committee to UN Secretary General Kofi Annan on the New Partnership for Africa’s Development, an economic program accelerating economic co-operation and integration among African countries.

In May, 2004, Bhagwati was one of the experts who took part in the Copenhagen Consensus project.

In 2006, Bhagwati was a part of the Eminent Persons Group along with Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso on the future of United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). In early 2010, Bhagwati joined the advisory board of the Institute for Migrant Rights in Indonesia.

In 2000, Bhagwati was signatory to an amicus briefing, coordinated by the American Enterprise Institute, with the Supreme Court of the United States to contend that the Environmental Protection Agency should, contrary to a prior ruling, be allowed to take into account the costs of regulations when setting environmental standards.

In January 2004, Bhagwati published &quot;In Defense of Globalization,&quot; a book in which he argues that globalization, when properly governed, is the most powerful force for social good in the world today. He described how globalization helps the cause of women, reduces child labor and increases literacy. He makes a point that:

... this process [of globalization] has a human face, but we need to make that face more agreeable.
Jagdish Bhagwati was the fictional winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Elementary School Musical&quot;.

==Awards, honors and commentary==
* Mahalanobis Memorial Medal of the Indian Econometric Society (1974)
* Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1982)
*Member of the American Philosophical Society (1995)
* Seidman Distinguished Award in International Political Economy (1998)
* Padma Vibhushan Award (2000)
* Lifetime Achievement Award of the Indian Chamber of Commerce (2004)
* Order of the Rising Sun, Gold and Silver Star (2006)
*Member of the National Academy of Sciences (2012)

Nobel laureate Paul Samuelson, on the occasion of Bhagwati&#x27;s 70th birthday &quot;festschrift&quot; conference in Gainesville, Florida in January 2005 said:

I measure a scholar&#x27;s prolific-ness not by the mere number of his publishings. Just as the area of a rectangle equals its width times its depth, the quality of a lifetime accomplishment must weight each article by its novelties and wisdoms. ... Jagdish Bhagwati is more like Haydn: a composer of more than a hundred symphonies and no one of them other than top notch. ... In the struggle to improve the lot of mankind, whether located in advanced economies or in societies climbing the ladder out of poverty, Jagdish Bhagwati has been a tireless partisan of that globalization which elevates global total-factor – productivities both of richest America and poorest regions of Asia and Africa.
Other awards include the Bernhard Harms Prize (Germany), the Kenan Enterprise Award (United States), the Freedom Prize (Switzerland), and the John R. Commons Award (United States). He has also received honorary degrees from the University of Sussex and Erasmus University, as well as others.

<text>The Malpighian layer (stratum mucosum or stratum malpighii) of the epidermis is generally defined as both the stratum basale (basal layer) and the thicker stratum spinosum (spinous layer/prickle cell layer) immediately above it as a single unit, although it is occasionally defined as the stratum basale specifically, or the stratum spinosum specifically.

It is named after the Italian biologist and physician Marcello Malpighi.

Basal cell carcinoma originates from the basal layer of the stratum malpighii.

This layer is where almost all of the mitotic activity in the epidermis occurs. The activity of these cells is increased by IL-1 (interleukin-1) and epidermal growth factor. The activity is decreased by transforming growth factor beta.

<text>The Parc des Princes (, ) is an all-seater football stadium in Paris, France. It is located in the south-west of the French capital, inside the 16th arrondissement, near the Stade Jean-Bouin and Stade Roland Garros.

The stadium, with a seating capacity of 47,929 spectators, has been the home of football club Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) since 1846. Before the opening of the Stade de France in 1998, it was the home stadium of France&#x27;s national football team and national rugby union team. The Parc des Princes pitch is surrounded by four covered all-seater stands, officially known as Tribune Borelli, Tribune Auteuil, Tribune Paris, and Tribune Boulogne.

Conceived by architect Roger Taillibert and Siavash Teimouri, the current version of the Parc des Princes officially opened on 25 May 1972, at a cost of 80–150 million francs. The stadium is the third to have been built on the site, the first opening its doors in 1897 and the second in 1932.

PSG registered its record home attendance in 1983, when 49,575 spectators witnessed the club&#x27;s 2–0 win over Waterschei in the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup quarter-finals. However, the France national rugby union team holds the stadium&#x27;s absolute attendance record. They defeated Wales, 31–12, in the 1989 Five Nations Championship in front of 50,370 spectators.

==History==

===Original stadium (1897–1932)===

Originally called Stade Vélodrome du Parc des Princes, the stadium was inaugurated on 18 July 1897. Situated in the 16th arrondissement of Paris, the area was a forested parkland used by the royal family before the French Revolution. This gave the Parc des Princes its name.

With more than 3,000 seats, the velodrome had a 728-yard track. The director of the stadium, Henri Desgrange, was a former racing cyclist and founder of the cycling magazine &quot;L&#x27;Auto&quot; (predecessor of &quot;L&#x27;Équipe&quot;). The Parc des Princes marked the finish of the Tour from its first edition in 1903 until 1967. The 1900 UCI Track Cycling World Championships was held at the Parc des Princes.

In 1903, an English side easily defeated a team composed by the best Parisian players (11–0) in front of 984 paying spectators, in what was the first international football played at the Parc des Princes. In 1905, the France national football team contested its first ever home match against Switzerland, winning 1–0 at the Parc des Princes. Subsequently, the stadium welcomed further prestigious friendly games, but also four USFSA French Championship finals, as well as the 1919 Coupe de France Final between CASG Paris and Olympique de Paris in front of 10,000 spectators.

PSG&#x27;s home also boasts a long history as an international rugby venue. In 1906, the France national rugby union team played their debut international, against the New Zealand national rugby union team. Other tenants included the Racing Club de France.

The stadium capacity was increased to 20,000 by the start of the 1924 Summer Olympics, held in Paris. However, Stade Olympique Yves-du-Manoir, which had been expanded to 60,000 seats, hosted the event.

===Second stadium (1932–1972)===
In the 1930s, &quot;L&#x27;Auto&quot; founder Henri Desgrange and his business partner Victor Goddet carried out a thorough reconstruction of the Parc des Princes and expanded it so that the sports arena had seats for 45,000 visitors, including 26,000 covered. The new stadium opened on 19 April 1932. Its capacity, however, was quickly reduced to 38,000 seats to improve comfort. The Parc des Princes hosted the opening match of the 1938 FIFA World Cup between Switzerland and Germany as well as the victory of Hungary in the semi-final against Sweden. But Stade Olympique Yves-du-Manoir continued to be more important, hosting the 1938 FIFA World Cup final in which Italy beat the Hungarians 4–2 to claim its second consecutive world title.

Following the Liberation of Paris in August 1944 and the end of World War II in September 1945, the French football championship returned, with big Parisian clubs Stade français-Red Star and Racing Paris regularly playing at the Parc des Princes. Still equipped with a cycling track of 454 metres, the Tour de France was not the only major sporting event hosted at this stadium. The Parc des Princes also hosted the 1954 Rugby League World Cup final, which saw Great Britain defeat hosts France in the inaugural staging of the Rugby League World Cup; Real Madrid&#x27;s win over Stade de Reims in the first ever European Cup final in 1956; and the 1960 European Nations&#x27; Cup final, which saw the Soviet Union claim the first edition of the tournament after beating Yugoslavia.

===Current stadium (1972–present)===
Conceived by French architect Roger Taillibert and Iranian artist Siavash Teimouri, the third and current Parc des Princes is one of the continent&#x27;s most emblematic and historic venues. It is a landmark and legally protected icon of French architecture. It was also the first stadium with lighting systems integrated onto its elliptical roof, and to this day is praised for its unique acoustics and its distinctive concrete ribs or razors.

The inauguration of the Parc des Princes took place on 25 May 1972 on the occasion of the football match between France and USSR. The new stadium also hosted the 1972 Coupe de France Final between Olympique de Marseille and Bastia on 4 June 1972, and the 1972 Rugby League World Cup. That same year, Paris Saint-Germain – a fusion between Paris FC and Stade Saint-Germain – went through a bitter divorce. Paris FC remained in Ligue 1, while PSG kept their name but were administratively demoted to Division 3.

PSG played their first game at the Parc des Princes against Ligue 2 promotion rivals Red Star on 10 November 1973, as a curtain-raiser for that season&#x27;s league season between Paris FC and Sochaux. PSG won 3–1 as Othniel Dossevi scored the club&#x27;s first goal at the stadium. PSG returned to Ligue 1 in 1974, ironically the same year that Paris FC were relegated. They immediately moved into the Parc des Princes, which up until that point had been the home stadium of Paris FC. Before that, PSG had been playing at several grounds including the Stade Georges Lefèvre, the Stade Jean-Bouin, the Stade Bauer, and even the Parc des Princes a few times that season despite the reluctance of Paris FC. Thereafter, Paris FC and Racing Paris also played at the Parc des Princes while they were in Ligue 1 (until 1990), but never reaching the numbers of attendance leaders PSG.

Following its opening, the Parc des Princes finally became France&#x27;s biggest stadium. This was where the national and international cup finals took place, including every single Coupe de France from 1972 to 1997, and three European club finals (the 1975 European Cup Final, the 1978 European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup Final, and the 1981 European Cup Final), and the 1991 Rugby World Cup. Most importantly, the Parc des Princes saw France defeat Spain in the UEFA Euro 1984 Final to claim its first-ever title. In 1992, France was named to host the 1998 World Cup. It was the country&#x27;s first since 1938 and construction of a new arena began in May 1995, at the same time that Parc des Princes hosted the 1995 UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup Final.

Inaugurated in January 1998, the Stade de France was the stadium of the future, while the Parc des Princes hosted its last international final that same year: the 1998 UEFA Cup Final. France have only played twice at the Parc des Princes since 1998: against Scotland during the UEFA Euro 2008 qualifiers in September 2007, and versus Australia in a friendly match in October 2013. Nonetheless, the stadium has still staged games at the 1998 FIFA World Cup, 2007 Rugby World Cup, UEFA Euro 2016 and 2019 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup.

====Renovation and expansion====

In November 2013, PSG reached an agreement with the Paris City Council, owner of the Parc des Princes, to extend their stadium lease for a further 30 years until 2043, based on a fixed rent plus a variable share of their income. Subsequently, under the guidance of American architect Tom Sheehan, PSG completed a three-year €75 million upgrade of the Parc des Princes (2012, 2013–2014, 2015–2016) ahead of the UEFA Euro 2016 in France.

Two additional rows of seats were added, allowing the ground to remain at its current capacity, despite now boasting larger and more comfortable seats. Hospitality capacity went from 1,200 to 4,500, and new substitutes&#x27; benches and spacious, modern changing rooms that include warm-up and treatment rooms were installed. Carrying out this renovation work saw PSG&#x27;s stadium revenue swell from €20m to €100m.

PSG are also looking to increase the capacity of their home to 60,000 in the coming years. From the start of their ownership at the club, Qatar Sports Investments (QSI) made it clear that a larger stadium is necessary to establish PSG as one of the leading European clubs. Originally, there were two options under consideration: move to the Stade de France or expand the Parc des Princes. The former was discarded following the redevelopments made to the Parc des Princes ahead of the Euro 2016. There have also been rumours that QSI are interested in buying the Parc des Princes for a fee believed to be around €150m.

==Concerts==

Since its musical debut in June 1988, when Michael Jackson took the stage, the Parc des Princes has often hosted major concerts. Jackson played there again in 1997. The stadium was also used as a venue by other major artists, including The Rolling Stones and Prince in 1990, Johnny Hallyday in 1993, and David Bowie in 1997, as part of the Rock Festival in Paris. Following a show from U2 in 1997, the venue had a six-year musical hiatus.

Johnny Hallyday&#x27;s second stint in June 2003, with four concerts to celebrate his 60th anniversary, reactivated the music scene at the Parc des Princes. He remains the singer who performed the most live concerts, seven in total. It subsequently welcomed the likes of Red Hot Chili Peppers (2004), Metallica (2004), Moby (2005), Iron Maiden (2005), Robbie Williams (2006), Muse (2007), Genesis (2007), Bruce Springsteen (2008), and Coldplay (2009). In June 2010, French hip hop group Suprême NTM and American rock band Green Day marked the last music chapter at the stadium in a long time.

In June 2022, DJ Snake became the first artist to perform at the Parc des Princes in twelve years. He was followed by French singer Dadju later that same month.

<text>Sir Thomas Johnstone Lipton, 1st Baronet (10 May 18482 October 1931) was a Scotsman of Irish parentage who was a self-made man, as company founder of Lipton Tea, merchant, philanthropist and yachtsman who lost 5 straight America&#x27;s Cup races.

He engaged extensive advertising for his chain of tea stores and his brand of Lipton teas. He boasted that his secret for success was selling the best goods at the cheapest prices, harnessing the power of advertising, and always being optimistic. He was the most persistent challenger in the history of the America&#x27;s Cup yacht race.

==Parentage and childhood==
Lipton was born in a tenement in Crown Street in the Gorbals, Glasgow, on 10 May 1848. His Ulster-Scots parents, Thomas Lipton senior and Frances Lipton (&quot;née&quot; Johnstone), were from the townland of either Shannock Green or Shankillk (Tonitybog), both near Roslea, in the south-east corner of County Fermanagh in Ulster, not far from Clones in County Monaghan. His parents were married in St. Mark&#x27;s Church of Ireland Church in Aghadrumsee, near Roslea.

The Liptons had been smallholders in County Fermanagh for generations but, by the late 1840s, Thomas Lipton&#x27;s parents had been forced to leave Ireland due to the Great Famine of 1845. Moving to Scotland in search of a better living for their young family, the Liptons had settled in Glasgow by 1847. Lipton&#x27;s father had a number of occupations throughout the 1840s and 1850s, including working as a labourer and as a printer.

Although Lipton later stated that he was born at his family&#x27;s home in Crown Street in the Gorbals in 1850, there is no record of this in the parish register for that period. In the 1851 census, however, the family were recorded as living in the north of Glasgow, with young Thomas being listed as being 3 years old, suggesting that he must have been born in 1848. Thomas&#x27; siblings, three brothers and one sister, all died in infancy, but Thomas, the youngest, survived.

&quot;Tommy&quot; Lipton was educated at St Andrew&#x27;s Parish School close to Glasgow Green between 1853 and 1863. By the early 1860s his parents owned a shop at 11 Crown Street in the Gorbals where they sold ham, butter and eggs. Thomas Lipton left school at the age of thirteen to supplement his parents&#x27; limited income, and found employment as a printer&#x27;s errand boy, and later as a shirtcutter. He also enrolled at a night school, the Gorbals Youth&#x27;s School, during this period.

==Grocer and Lipton&#x27;s tea==

In 1864 Lipton signed up as a cabin boy on a steamer running between Glasgow and Belfast and was captivated by life aboard the ship and the stories told by sailors who had travelled to the United States. After being let go by the steamer company, Lipton quickly used the wages he had saved to purchase passage on a ship bound for the U.S., where he spent five years working and travelling all over the country. Lipton had a number of jobs during this time: at a tobacco plantation in Virginia, as an accountant and book-keeper at a rice plantation in South Carolina, as a door-to-door salesman in New Orleans, a farmhand in New Jersey, and finally as a grocery assistant in New York.

He returned to Glasgow in 1870, initially helping his parents run their small shop in the Gorbals. The following year he opened his first provision shop—Lipton&#x27;s Market—at 101 Stobcross Street in the Anderston area of Glasgow. This enterprise proved to be successful and Lipton soon established a chain of groceries, first across Glasgow, the rest of Scotland, until finally he had stores throughout Britain. While Lipton was expanding his empire, tea prices were falling and demand was growing among his middle-class customers.

In 1880, Lipton invested in the Union Stockyards of Omaha, Nebraska, founding a large packing plant in South Omaha which he sold to American interests in 1887. In 1888, when his empire had grown to 300 stores, he entered the tea trade and opened his tea-tasting office. He started bypassing traditional trading and wholesale distribution channels (most UK tea-trading was focused in London&#x27;s Mincing Lane) in order to sell teas at unprecedentedly low prices to the untapped poor working class market. In order to provide his shops with goods Lipton bought tea gardens and in doing so, he established the Lipton tea brand, which continues to exist today.

Lipton visited British Ceylon in 1890 and made business deals with James Taylor, who introduced tea gardens to the country with indentured Tamil workers from British India. Lipton&#x27;s company purchased Ceylon tea, distributing it through Europe and the USA beginning in 1890. At Queen Victoria&#x27;s diamond jubilee in 1897 he gave £20,000 for providing dinners for a large number of the London poor.

==Sportsman==

King Edward VII and King George V both shared their interest in yachting with Lipton and enjoyed his company. Between 1899 and 1930 he challenged the American holders of the America&#x27;s Cup through the Royal Ulster Yacht Club five times with his yachts called &quot;Shamrock&quot; through &quot;Shamrock V&quot;. His well-publicised efforts to win the cup, which earned him a specially designed cup for &quot;the best of all losers&quot;, made his tea famous in the United States. Lipton, a self-made man, was no natural member of the British upper class and the elite Royal Yacht Squadron only admitted him shortly before his death. Lipton was inducted into the America&#x27;s Cup Hall of Fame in 1993.

Before the first Football World Cup was held in 1930, Thomas Lipton donated the Sir Thomas Lipton Trophy and The Lipton Challenge Cup in Italy.

In 1914 he presented the silver Sir Thomas Lipton Cup to his friend Con Riley of Winnipeg as a means of promoting the sport of rowing in the central portions of Canada and the United States. Since then the rowing clubs of the North West International Rowing Association (NWIRA) have fiercely battled each year for the honour of having their names engraved upon the Lipton Cup.

He also donated the Copa Lipton trophy which was contested between the national football teams of Argentina and Uruguay from 1905 to 1992.

==Personal life==

Lipton was sometimes described in the press as &#x27;the world&#x27;s most eligible bachelor&#x27;, and carefully cultivated a public image as a &#x27;ladies man&#x27;. He never had a relationship with a woman, using as the excuse that none measured up to his mother. Instead, he maintained a thirty-year relationship with one of his early shop assistants, William Love, with whom he lived. When they parted other male companions followed, including an orphan from Crete whom Lipton met during a cruise in 1900. A close friend was Maurice Talvande, the self-styled &quot;Comte de Mauny&quot;.

Lipton came to his home, Osidge, in Southgate, London, from Muswell Hill in 1892. Before moving in, he redecorated the house completely, built a new billiards room and moved the existing pathway as far away from the house as possible. Before the coming of the motor car, his home&#x27;s newly enlarged stables contained at least three pairs of fast carriage horses, of which he was proud. He was driven to his offices in City Road each day, and did not use the nearby railway.

During the First World War, Lipton helped organisations of medical volunteers. He placed his yachts at the disposal of the Red Cross, the Scottish Women&#x27;s Hospitals Committee of Dr. Elsie Inglis, the Serbian Relief Fund and others, for the transport of medical volunteers (doctors and nurses) and medical supplies. In Serbia during the winter of 1914–1915 and the spring of 1915, several British hospital teams were working with Serbian military and civilian doctors and nurses. A catastrophic typhus epidemic erupted, killing thousands of civilians, soldiers, and prisoners of war; medical staff were among the first victims. At the height of the epidemic, Lipton decided to visit Serbia, travelling aboard his steam yacht &quot;Erin&quot; via Sardinia, Malta, Athens and Thessaloníki.

Once in Serbia, he visited hospitals and medical missions in Belgrade, Kragujevac, Niš, Vrnjačka Banja, and elsewhere. His modesty made him very popular among the people. He asked only for modest lodgings and requested for meals only what the common people ate under war conditions. He also liked to pose for photographs with Serbian officers and soldiers. In addition to visiting many hospitals, where he encouraged doctors, nurses and soldiers, he found time to attend traditional fairs and to take a part in blackberry gathering and fishing. He was made an honorary citizen of the city of Niš.

Author Herbert W. Newby writes in a book about Southgate in 1949:Sir Thomas was proud of his successes in life, and any reference to him made in any publication was always carefully cut out and pasted into a book kept for this purpose. These books formed a most interesting section of his library. He was a very genial man to meet and always put a stranger quickly at ease. I met him on several occasions and found him without any form of snobbery.

Lipton was appointed Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order by Edward VII on 8 March 1901. On 24 July 1902 he was created Baronet of Osidge, in the Parish of Southgate, in the County of Middlesex.

A portrait of Lipton appeared on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine on 3 November 1924.

==Freemasonry==

Lipton was Initiated to Scottish Freemasonry in Lodge Scotia, No. 178, (Glasgow).

==Death==
He died at Osidge on 2 October 1931 and bequeathed the majority of his fortune to his native city of Glasgow, including his yachting trophies, which are now on display at the Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum. Sir Thomas Lipton was buried alongside his parents and siblings in Glasgow&#x27;s Southern Necropolis. He left no issue and so his title was not carried forward and died with him.

==In literature and popular culture==
The departure of Lipton&#x27;s &quot;Shamrock III&quot; and America&#x27;s Cup fleet from Gourock in 1903 was satirised by Neil Munro in his Erchie Macpherson story, &quot;Erchie Suffers a Sea Change&quot;, published in the Glasgow Evening News on 1 June 1903.

<text>Off-off-Broadway theaters are smaller New York City theaters than Broadway and off-Broadway theaters, and usually have fewer than 100 seats. The off-off-Broadway movement began in 1958 as part of a response to perceived commercialism of the professional theatre scene and as an experimental or avant-garde movement of drama and theatre. Over time, some off-off-Broadway productions have moved away from the movement&#x27;s early experimental spirit.

== History ==
The off-off-Broadway movement began in 1958 as a &quot;complete rejection of commercial theatre&quot;. Michael Smith gives credit for the term&#x27;s coinage to Jerry Tallmer in 1960. Among the first venues for what would soon be called &quot;off-off-Broadway&quot; theatre were coffeehouses in Greenwich Village, particularly the Caffe Cino at 31 Cornelia Street, operated by the eccentric Joe Cino, who early on took a liking to actors and playwrights and agreed to let them stage plays there without bothering to read the plays first, or to even find out much about the content. This DIY aesthetic also led to creative acts of object repurposing by playwrights and directors, who cobbled together sets from materials scavenged from local streets. Also integral to the rise of off-off-Broadway were Ellen Stewart at La MaMa, and Al Carmines at Judson Poets Theatre, located at Judson Memorial Church. Other theaters of note that presented many plays were Theatre Genesis, New York Theatre Ensemble, The Old Reliable, The Dove Company, The Playwrights Workshop, and Workshop of the Players Art.

At its coalescence, off-off-Broadway was known for its experimental nature. Brooks McNamara wrote that over time, off-off-Broadway work lost some of its experimental spirit, instead beginning to imitate the &quot;characteristics of off-Broadway, which had gradually moved toward reshaping itself in the image of Broadway, though often producing works that were unsuitable for commercial theatre.&quot;

An off-off-Broadway production that features members of the Actors&#x27; Equity Association may be an &quot;Equity Showcase&quot; production intended to allow actors to be seen by potential future employers. Equity maintains union rules about working in such productions, including restrictions on price of tickets, the length of the run, and rehearsal times. Professional actors&#x27; participation in showcase productions is frequent and comprises the bulk of stage work for the majority of New York actors. There has been an ongoing movement to revise the Equity Showcase Code, which many in the community find overly restrictive and detrimental to the creation of New York theatre.

In 1964, off-off-Broadway productions were made eligible for Obie Awards, and in 1974, the Drama Desk Awards began evaluating such productions with the same criteria as it used for Broadway and off-Broadway productions. Since 2005, the New York Innovative Theatre Awards (NYIT Awards or IT Awards) have annually honored individuals and organizations that have achieved artistic excellence in off-off-Broadway theatre.

The term &quot;indie theatre&quot;, or independent theatre, was suggested as an alternative for &quot;off-off-Broadway&quot; by playwright Kirk Bromley during a speech at the 2005 New York Innovative Theatre Awards.

<doc id="761310" wikidata="Q727480" url="?curid=761310" title="Ordoliberalism">
<text>Ordoliberalism is the German variant of economic liberalism that emphasizes the need for government to ensure that the free market produces results close to its theoretical potential but neither advocates for a welfare state nor against one.

Ordoliberal ideals became the foundation of the creation of the post-World War II German social market economy and its attendant . The term &quot;ordoliberalism&quot; () was coined in 1950 by and refers to the academic journal &quot;ORDO&quot;.

== Linguistic differentiation ==

Ordoliberals separate themselves from classical liberals. Notably, , with , founder of ordoliberalism and the Freiburg School, rejected neoliberalism.

Ordoliberals promote the concept of the social market economy, which favors a strong role for the state with respect to the market and which is in many ways different from the ideas connected to the term &quot;neoliberalism&quot;. The term &quot;neoliberalism&quot; was originally coined in 1938 at the by , who is regarded as an ordoliberal today.

Because of the connected history, ordoliberalism is sometimes referred to as &quot;German neoliberalism&quot;. This has led to frequent confusion and mix-ups of terms and ideas in the discourse, debate and criticism of both economic schools. In 1991 political economist published &quot;Capitalisme Contre Capitalisme,&quot; and in 2001 Peter A. Hall and David Soskice published &quot;Varieties of Capitalism&quot;, and both separated the concepts and developed the new terms &quot;liberal market economy&quot; and &quot;coordinated market economy&quot; to distinguish neoliberalism and ordoliberalism.

== Development ==
The theory was developed from about 1930 to 1950 by German economists and legal scholars from the Freiburg School, such as Walter Eucken, , Hans Grossmann-Doerth, and Leonhard Miksch.

Ordoliberal ideals (with modifications) drove the creation of the post-World War II German social market economy. They were especially influential on forming a firm competition law in Germany. However the social market economy was implemented in economies where corporatism was already well established, so ordoliberal ideals were not as far reaching as the theory&#x27;s economic founders had intended.

Since the 1960s, ordoliberal influence on economics and jurisprudence has significantly diminished; however, many German economists define themselves as Ordoliberals through the present day, the &quot;ORDO&quot; is still published, and the Faculty of Economics at the University of Freiburg is still teaching ordoliberalism. Additionally, some institutes and foundations such as the and the are engaged in the ordoliberal tradition.

Germany&#x27;s Free Democratic Party (FDP) is a traditional and committed supporter of ordoliberalism, the party having been influenced by the economic theories of Wilhelm Röpke and Alexander Rüstow. Historical FDP party grandee Otto Graf Lambsdorff, who served as Federal Minister of Economics, was a particular proponent of ordoliberalism.

== Implementation ==

Ordoliberalism was a major influence on the economic model developed in post-war West Germany. Ordoliberalism in Germany became known as the social market economy.

The Ordoliberal model implemented in Germany was started under the government administration of . His government&#x27;s Minister of Economics, , was a known Ordoliberal and adherent of the Freiburg School. Under , some, but not all, price controls were lifted, and taxes on small businesses and corporations were lowered. Furthermore, social security and pensions were increased to provide a social base income. Ordoliberals have stated that these policies led to the , or economic miracle.

== Theory ==
Ordoliberal theory holds that the state must create a proper legal environment for the economy and maintain a healthy level of competition through measures that adhere to market principles. This is the foundation of its legitimacy. The concern is that, if the state does not take active measures to foster competition, firms with monopoly (or oligopoly) power will emerge, which will not only subvert the advantages offered by the market economy, but also possibly undermine good government, since strong economic power can be transformed into political power.

According to Stephen Padgett, &quot;a central tenet of ordo-liberalism is a clearly defined division of labor in economic management, with specific responsibilities assigned to particular institutions. Monetary policy should be the responsibility of a central bank committed to monetary stability and low inflation, and insulated from political pressure by independent status. Fiscal policy—balancing tax revenue against government expenditure—is the domain of the government, whilst macro-economic policy is the preserve of employers and trade unions.&quot; The state should form an economic order instead of directing economic processes, and three negative examples ordoliberals used to back their theories were Nazism, Keynesianism, and Soviet socialism. It is also seen as a third way between collectivism and laissez-faire liberalism.

While the ordoliberal idea of a social market is similar to that of the third-way social democracy advocated since the 1990s by the likes of the New Labour government (especially during the premiership of Tony Blair), there are a few key differences. Whilst they both adhere to the idea of providing a moderate stance between socialism and capitalism, the ordoliberal social market model often combines private enterprise with government regulation to establish fair competition (although German network industries are known to have been deregulated), whereas advocates of the third-way social democracy model have been known to oversee multiple economic deregulations. The third way social democracy model has also foreseen a clash of ideas regarding the establishment of the welfare state, in comparison to the ordoliberal&#x27;s idea of a social market model being open to the benefits of social welfare.

Ordoliberals are also known for pursuing a minimum configuration of vital resources and progressive taxation. The ordoliberal emphasis on the privatization of public services and other public firms such as telecommunication services; wealth redistribution and minimum wage laws as regulative principles makes clear the links between this economic model and the social market economy.

Wilhelm Röpke considered ordoliberalism to be &quot;liberal conservatism&quot;, against capitalism in his work (&quot;A Humane Order of Society&quot;, 1944). also criticized laissez-faire capitalism in his work (&quot;The Failure of Economic Liberalism&quot;, 1950). The ordoliberals thus separated themselves from classical liberals and valued the idea of social justice. &quot;Social security and social justice&quot;, wrote , &quot;are the greatest concerns of our time&quot;.

 also notes the similarity (beyond just historical contemporaneity) between the Ordo/Freiburg school and the Frankfurt School of critical theory, due to their inheritance from . That is, both recognise the &quot;irrational rationality&quot; of the capitalist system, but not the &quot;logic of contradiction&quot; that Marx posited. Both groups took up the same problem, but in vastly different directions. The political philosophy of Ordoliberals was influenced by Aristotle, , , , , , and .

== Criticism ==
According to and , ordoliberalism is central to the German approach to the European sovereign-debt crisis, which has often led to conflicts with other European countries.

<doc id="761312" wikidata="Q491757" url="?curid=761312" title="Principle of conferral">
<text>The principle of conferral is a fundamental principle of European Union law. According to this principle, the EU is a union of its member states, and all its competences are voluntarily conferred on it by its member states. The Union has no competences by right, and thus any areas of policy not explicitly agreed in treaties by all member states remain the domain of the member states. This indicates that the member states have the right to deal with all matters that fall outside the agreements of the Treaties and the EU can only act within the conferred competences defined by the Member States in the treaties.

This principle has always underpinned the European Union, but it was explicitly specified for the first time in the proposed and rejected Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe. The principle carried over into its replacement, the Treaty on European Union (TEU). It is spelled out fully in Articles 4 and 5 of the TEU.

Both Articles make clear that the Union acts only within the limits of the competences conferred upon it by the Member States, but then state clearly that &quot;Competences not conferred upon the Union in the Treaties remain with the Member States.&quot; Article 4(1) repeats this and goes on to stipulate that &quot;The Union shall respect the equality of Member States before the Treaties as well as their national identities, inherent in their fundamental structures, political and constitutional, inclusive of regional and local self-government. It shall respect their essential State functions, including ensuring the territorial integrity of the State, maintaining law and order and safeguarding national security. In particular, national security remains the sole responsibility of each Member State.&quot;

In many areas the Union has shared competence with the Member States. Once the Union has passed legislation in these fields competence moves to the Union.

<doc id="761313" wikidata="Q2232867" url="?curid=761313" title="Phosphor bronze">
<text>Phosphor bronze is a member of the family of copper alloys. It is composed of copper that is alloyed with 0.5–11% of tin and 0.01–0.35% phosphorus, and may contain other elements to confer specific properties (e.g. lead at 0.5–3.0% to form free-machining phosphor bronze). The tin increases the corrosion resistance and strength of the alloy, while the phosphorus increases its wear resistance and stiffness.

Phosphor bronze alloys are notable for their toughness, strength, low coefficient of friction, and fine grain. The phosphorus reduces the viscosity of the molten alloy, which makes it easier and cleaner to cast and reduces grain boundaries between crystallites. It was originally formulated by the Belgian Georges Montefiore-Levi and the German Karl Künzel.

==Industrial uses==
Phosphor bronze is used for springs, bolts, bushings and bearings, electrical switches with moving or sliding parts, dental bridges, the reed component of organ pipes and various other products or assemblies where resistance to fatigue, wear, and corrosion are required (e.g., ship&#x27;s propellers in a marine environment).

Phosphor bronze comes in a wide array of standard alloys, including nonferrous spring alloys, free-machining phosphor bronze and bearing bronze. The combination of good physical properties, fair electrical conductivity, and moderate cost make phosphor bronze wire (available in standard round, square, flat, and special formats) desirable for many springs, electrical contacts, and a wide variety of wire forms where the desired properties do not require the use of more expensive beryllium copper.

Phosphor bronze with 94.8% copper, 5% tin, and 0.2% phosphorus is also used in cryogenics. In this application, its combination of fair electrical conductivity and low thermal conductivity allows the making of electrical connections to devices at ultra low temperatures without adding excessive heat.

==Spent nuclear fuel overpack==

Oxygen-free copper can be alloyed with phosphorus (CuOFP alloy) to better withstand oxidizing conditions. This alloy has application as thick corrosion-resistant overpack for spent nuclear fuel disposal in deep crystalline rocks.

==UNIVAC computer==
Magnetic tape was first used to record computer data in 1951 on the Eckert-Mauchly UNIVAC I. The UNISERVO drive recording medium was a thin metal strip of wide nickel-plated phosphor bronze. Recording density was 128 characters per inch (198 micrometre/character) on eight tracks at a linear speed of , yielding a data rate of 12,800 characters per second. Of the eight tracks, six were data, one was a parity track, and one was a clock, or timing track. Making allowance for the empty space between tape blocks, the actual transfer rate was around 7,200 characters per second. A small reel of mylar tape provided separation from the metal tape and the read/write head.

==Musical instruments==

Phosphor bronze is preferred over brass for cymbals because of its greater resilience, leading to broader tonal spectrum and greater sustain.

Phosphor bronze is one of several high copper content alloys used as a substitute for the more common &quot;yellow&quot; or &quot;cartridge&quot; types of brass to construct the bodies and bells of metal wind instruments. Examples of instruments constructed using high copper alloys occur among members of the brass instrument family (trumpets, flugelhorns, and trombones) and one member of the reed instrument family, saxophones. In addition to the distinctive appearance provided by the reddish-orange hue of high copper alloys, they are purported by some instrument designers, sellers, and players to provide a broader harmonic response spectrum for a given instrument design. The Yanagisawa 902/992 model saxophones (pictured) have bodies of phosphor bronze, in contrast to the brass 901/991 models. 

Some instrument strings for acoustic guitars, mandolins and violins are wrapped with phosphor bronze. Some harmonica reeds are made of phosphor bronze, such as those by Suzuki Musical Instrument Corporation and Bushman Harmonicas.

The reed component of reed-type organ pipes is usually made of phosphor bronze owing to its high wear and low deformability under conditions of constant vibration when producing sound.

Some snare drums are constructed with phosphor bronze.

Some tambourine jingles are made of phosphor bronze.

==Variants==
Further increasing the phosphorus content leads to formation of a very hard compound Cu3P (copper phosphide), resulting in a brittle form of phosphor bronze, which has a narrow range of applications.

Around 2001, the Olin Corporation developed another alloy for use in electrical and electronic connectors which they referred to as &quot;phosphor bronze&quot;. Its composition was as follows:

*Zinc – 9.9%
*Tin – 2.2%
*Iron – 1.9%
*Phosphorus – 0.03%
*Copper – 85.97%

When assessed in strictly metallurgical terms it is not a phosphor bronze, but a form of iron-modified tin brass.

<text>Wimbledon Common is a large open space in Wimbledon, southwest London. There are three named areas: Wimbledon Common, Putney Heath, and Putney Lower Common, which together are managed under the name Wimbledon and Putney Commons totalling 460 hectares (1,140 acres). Putney Lower Common is set apart from the rest of the Common by a minimum of of the built-up western end of Putney.

==Wimbledon and Putney Commons==
Wimbledon Common, together with Putney Heath and Putney Lower Common, is protected by the Wimbledon and Putney Commons Act of 1871 from being enclosed or built upon. The common is for the benefit of the general public for informal recreation, and for the preservation of natural flora and fauna. It is the largest expanse of heathland in London, with an area of bog with a flora that is rare in the region. The western slopes, which lie on London Clay, support mature mixed woodland. The Commons are also an important site for the stag beetle.

Most of the Common is a Site of Special Scientific Interest, and a Special Area of Conservation under the EC Habitats Directive. English Nature works with the Conservators on the management plan for the area. Wimbledon Common and Putney Heath are also a Site of Metropolitan Importance for Nature Conservation.

The Commons are administered by eight Conservators. Five of them are elected triennially and the remaining three are appointed by three government departments: the Department of the Environment, Ministry of Defence and Home Office. The Commons are managed by the Clerk and Ranger, supported by a Deputy, a Wildlife &amp; Conservation Officer and a personal assistant. There are seven Mounted Keepers (who deal with public safety and security), two groundsmen (for the playing fields), six maintenance workers and one property maintenance worker – some 23 employees in total. There are at least four horses which are used by the Keepers on mounted patrol.

The Conservators are responsible for the annual budget of around £1m. Most of the revenue comes from an annual levy on houses within of the Commons. The levy payers are entitled to vote for the five elected Conservators. The levy payers fall within three London boroughs: Merton, Wandsworth (which includes Putney) and Kingston.

In 1864, the lord of the manor, Earl Spencer, who owned Wimbledon manor, attempted to pass a private parliamentary bill to enclose the Common for the creation of a new park with a house and gardens and to sell part for building. In a landmark decision for English common land, and following an enquiry, permission was refused and a board of conservators was established in 1871 to take ownership of the common and preserve it in its natural condition.

The windmill stands near the centre of Wimbledon Common as usually understood; in fact the unmarked parish boundary with Putney Common runs right past it (line marked --- on the map). Here Robert Baden-Powell wrote parts of Scouting for Boys, which was published in 1908.

In the 19th century the windmill was the headquarters of the National Rifle Association and drew large crowds each July for the Imperial Meeting - the Association&#x27;s National Championship. &quot;These annual gatherings are attended by the élite of fashion, and always include a large number of ladies, who generally evince the greatest interest in the target practice of the various competitors, whether it be for the honour of carrying off the Elcho Shield, the Queen&#x27;s or the Prince of Wales&#x27;s Prize, or the shield shot for by our great Public Schools, or the Annual Rifle Match between the Houses of Lords and Commons.&quot; The Association left Wimbledon in 1889 as the Meeting outgrew the ranges there, relocating for the 1890 Meeting at a new complex near Bisley, Surrey.

Two broad, shallow pools, Kingsmere and Rushmere, lie near roads on the higher parts of Wimbledon Common and seem to be the result of gravel extraction. The more remote Queensmere is somewhat deeper, being impounded in a small valley. These were often referred to as &quot;Pen Ponds&quot;.

Beverley Brook runs along the western edge of Wimbledon Common. The watercourse was the historic south west London boundary, and is paralleled by the Beverley Brook Walk.

Near Beverley Brook and Warren Farm are two Local Nature Reserves managed by the London Wildlife Trust: Farm Bog and Fishpond Wood and Beverley Meads.

At the southern end of the common on the part used by the Royal Wimbledon Golf Club, but with a public footpath running through the middle, are the remains of an Iron Age hill fort known (in fact only since the 19th century) as Caesar&#x27;s Camp. Though the main period of use as an &quot;oppidum&quot; seems to have been the 6th to 4th centuries BC, there is some evidence that it was indeed stormed by the Romans, probably in the Invasion of Britain by Claudius. It may have been taken by the &quot;Legio II Augusta&quot; under Vespasian in their push westwards in AD 44. It is possible the site was settled as far back as the Bronze Age, but it and the surrounding barrows were deliberately destroyed by John Erle-Drax in 1875.

During World War One, an area of the common known as The Plain was used as one of ten air bases protecting London. In 1914 and before, model aircraft were flown here.

==Putney Heath==
Charles II reviewed his forces on Putney Heath in 1684; in May 1767, George III reviewed the Guards, and the Surrey Volunteers at the same spot in 1799. The 300th anniversary of the Queen&#x27;s Royal Surrey Regiment was marked in 1961 when a tercentenary monument was unveiled and blessed on the heath. According to Samuel Pepys, Charles II and his brother, the Duke of York used to run horses on the heath.

A stone and brick obelisk was erected on Putney Heath in 1770, marking the 110th anniversary of the Great Fire of London, to coincide with the invention of the Hartley fire plates by David Hartley, near a spot where his fireproof house was built. The obelisk, with the ornately detailed foundation stone, is still standing and can be accessed via the car park adjacent to The Telegraph public house, off Wildcroft Road, SW15. The lower part of this house was repeatedly set on fire in the presence, among others, of George III and Queen Charlotte, the members of Parliament, the Lord Mayor, and the Aldermen. Since 1955 the obelisk has been a Grade II listed building. The adjacent Wildcroft Manor was formerly in the ownership of publishing magnate George Newnes, builder of Putney Library. In 1895 he was created a baronet &quot;of Wildcroft, in the parish of Putney, in the county of London&quot;.

Many duels were fought on Putney Heath. In May 1652, a duel between George, the third Lord Chandos, and Colonel Henry Compton ended with Compton being killed. On a Sunday afternoon in May 1798 William Pitt, the then Prime Minister, who lived in Bowling-Green House on the heath, fought a bloodless battle with William Tierney, MP. The house derived its name from the bowling-green formerly attached to it, and for more than sixty years (1690–1750) was the most famous green in the neighbourhood of London. &quot;In the early days of George III&#x27;s reign it was celebrated for its public breakfasts and evening assemblies during the summer season. It was occupied for some time by Archbishop Cornwallis previous to Pitt taking up his residence there. During Pitt&#x27;s ownership the house had large rooms for public breakfasts and assemblies, was a fashionable place of entertainment&quot;. Nearly a century earlier the property was noted for &quot;deep play&quot;. Pitt died in the house in 1806 from typhus. It was later owned by Henry Lewis Doulton, son of Henry Doulton of pottery fame. It was demolished and an art deco style residence rebuilt on the site in 1933. Nearby stands Bristol House, which owes its name to the Bristol family. James Macpherson, the translator and author of the Ossian&#x27;s Poems, had a villa on Putney Heath.
The heath near the Telegraph pub was also the venue for the September 1809 duel between Cabinet ministers George Canning and Lord Castlereagh.

Scio House was the last villa on Portsmouth Road abutting the heath: it eventually became a hospital and was known as Scio House Hospital for Officers, Putney. It has since been redeveloped as a gated community of 70 neo-Georgian homes divided into two streets.

Putney Heath is around in size and sits at approximately above sea level. Because of its elevation, from 1796 to 1816 Putney Heath hosted a station in the shutter telegraph chain, which connected the Admiralty in London to its naval ships in Portsmouth. This was replaced by a semaphore station, which was part of a semaphore line that operated between 1822 and 1847.

Thomas Cromwell, 1st Earl of Essex, was born on the north side of the heath circa 1485. He became a statesman who served as chief minister of Henry VIII and an agent of Cardinal Wolsey. In the 19th century his birthplace was still a place of note. &quot;The site of Cromwell&#x27;s birthplace is still pointed out by tradition, and is in some measure confirmed by the survey of Wimbledon Manor... for it describes on that spot &#x27;an ancient cottage called the smith&#x27;s shop, lying west of the highway from Richmond to Wandsworth, being the sign of the Anchor.&#x27; The plot of ground here referred to is now covered by the Green Man public house.&quot;

The wilderness was for many years a noted rendezvous for highwaymen. In 1795, the notorious highwayman Jeremiah Abershaw – also known as Jerry Avershaw – was caught in the pub (now owned by Wandsworth brewery Young&#x27;s,) on the north side of the heath where Putney Hill meets Tibbet&#x27;s Ride. After Abershaw&#x27;s execution at Kennington, his body was hung in a chain gibbet on the heath, as a warning to others. The location on the heath is known as Jerry&#x27;s Hill. It is viewable from the A3 near Putney Vale, slightly uphill from Putney Vale Cemetery where a number of famous people have since been buried or cremated. Abershaw frequented the Bald Face Stag Inn. The inn was later knocked down and became the KLG factory, founded by Kenelm Lee Guinness, part of the famous brewing dynasty and a noted early motor racer before developing highly reliable auto and aero spark plugs. The factory site is now occupied by an Asda supermarket.
Above the hill peak of the A3 at Tibbet&#x27;s Corner – on the A219 towards Putney – stands an ancient wood fence cattle pound opposite the Green Man, adjacent to two huge plane trees near the bus terminus. This simple wood fence structure, used historically to contain lost livestock, has been listed as a Grade II listed structure since 1983. A number of fine homes lined Putney Hill and the north face of the heath, west of the Green Man. All had semi-circular carriageway entrances and exits. These included Grantham House, the residence of Lady Grantham; Ripon House; Ashburton House; and Exeter House, occupied by the second Marquis of Exeter. Grantham House had a large fountain in its grounds between road and residence, while across the road on the heath was a large, shallow rectangular pond used for ice skating. Grantham House stood east of both Exeter and Ashburton houses, on the site of the present-day Hayward Gardens. The skating pond was filled in post-WWII. George Cokayne, author of peerage and baronetage publications, died at Exeter House in 1911. Nearby Gifford House was owned by J. D. Charrington of brewing fame; and Dover House was the seat originally of Lord Dover, afterwards of Lord Clifden.

With the development of transport routes for the growing financial sector, Putney Heath became highly desirable for City gentlemen in the 1890s, and they were initially known as &quot;outsiders&quot;. Dover House was owned at the turn of the 20th century by the famous US financier J. P. Morgan. Social researcher Charles Booth classified the whole area of Putney Hill and West Hill, leading into Putney Heath, as wealthy or well-to-do. Despite a full array of places of worship, he said the area was noted for low church attendance with all denominations &quot;struggling for the souls of pleasure-seeking Putney ... the middle class here are as indifferent as the poor elsewhere.&quot;

At the top of Putney Hill, the road taking that name veers off Tibbet&#x27;s Ride at Putney Heath Lane (which was formerly known as Cut-Through Lane). Seven grand homes once lined the east side of this part of Putney Hill. It is now a no-through-road leading to Tibbet&#x27;s Corner. Several of the mansions remain. The most southern of the homes was named Bath House, which included a keeper&#x27;s lodge and large grounds. In 1926 it was opened as the Ross Institute and Hospital for Tropical Diseases by the then Prince of Wales, the future Edward VIII. The hospital was founded by malariologist Ronald Ross, who discovered that malaria was transmitted by mosquitoes. He won the 1902 Nobel Prize for his discovery. After his death and burial at nearby Putney Vale Cemetery in 1932, the financially strapped hospital was incorporated into the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine in Keppel Street, central London. Bath House was later demolished and mansion flats built on the property. In memory of its history the block was named Ross Court. Within the grounds remains an older dwelling named Ross Cottage.

The village green at the corner of Wildcroft and Telegraph roads is still used by Roehampton Cricket Club, established in 1842. The club has played there continuously since 1859 when the lord of the manor, Earl Spencer, suggested it as a new site. It has two teams in the highly competitive Fullers Surrey County League and a Sunday side that plays on a more social level. In 1900, a decade after the death of his multimillionaire father Junius Morgan, J. P. Morgan had already gained a fondness for the sport and was made an honorary member. Antarctic explorer Sir Ernest Shackleton, who presided at the club dinner in 1910, allowed his two young children – Raymond and Cecily – to play cowboys and Indians on the cricket green during the week. This groundkeeper&#x27;s transgression was later believed to have been a privilege of him being an honorary member.

The Chelsea Water Company originally owned the reservoir site and allowed construction of the club pavilion on its property. The covered reservoir is now owned by Thames Water. Cricket matches continued during the war although some games started late or were drawn due to late starts or air raid sirens. Four German V-1 flying bombs struck the area in World War II. One destroyed the club&#x27;s pavilion, opposite the Telegraph pub, in July 1944, near the reservoir. Wildcroft Road, turning into Portsmouth Road and further along into the future A3, was the main thoroughfare into SW London and became a stop-off point for American serviceman who alighted from their jeeps to &quot;taste this crazy cricket game&quot;.

On the south side of the reservoir, in the triangle of land between Wildcroft Road, Tibbet&#x27;s Ride and the Green Man, is a large clearing of land. A funfair is set up on the grounds each October, lasting for one week. Ground rent is paid by the touring company to the Wimbledon and Putney Commons Conservators, as part of the income of the charity.

==Sports and recreation==

In August 1730 a cricket match between Putney and Fulham was played, reportedly for &quot;50 guineas per side&quot;. It is the only known instance of a team called Putney and of a match at this venue.

Old Central School, situated in the south west of Wimbledon Common, provided a former pupils football team in the late 19th century which played on the common and used the &quot;Fox and Grapes&quot; public house as a changing room. At first called &quot;The Old Centrals&quot;, this club later became Wimbledon F.C.

Putney Lower Common hosted Fulham F.C.&#x27;s home games in the 1885–1886 season.

The Richardson Evans Memorial Playing Fields, which form part of the Commons and are situated in Kingston Vale, provide football and rugby pitches for local schools and clubs. The grounds are currently home to London Cornish RFC, and was the training ground for Harlequins RL. It also hosts the annual National Schools Sevens rugby tournament. The grounds can also accommodate many different sports such as Australian Rules Football and Ultimate Frisbee.

Hampton and Richmond Borough Juniors FC (Colts section of Hampton &amp; Richmond Borough of the Conference South League) play their home matches at the Richmond Park entrance/Robin Hood roundabout corner of the common on Sunday mornings.

A Parkrun is held on the common every Saturday morning which usually sees in excess of 300 runners complete 5 kilometres. The course starts and finishes at the Windmill.

Today, as well as being a popular place for cycling, jogging and walking, the Common is home to The Wimbledon Common Golf Club and London Scottish Golf Club. The first University Golf Match was played on Wimbledon Common in 1878, courtesy of the LSGC. It also is the base for Thames Hare and Hounds, the oldest cross country running club in the world. Annually Thames Hare and Hounds host the 1st team (Blues) Varsity cross-country match between Oxford and Cambridge Universities.

The Commons also provide some 16 miles of horse rides.

==Legal disputes==

In early 2012 the Wimbledon and Putney Commons Conservators agreed to sell the access rights across Putney Common to Wandsworth Council, having been threatened with a Compulsory Purchase Order if they refused. Without public consultation the Conservators entered into legal agreements, in return for a payment of £350,000. Some local residents who objected to the sale of the access and loss of common to facilitate what they saw as an unattractive and over-intensive development challenged the sale in the High Court, which ruled that the Conservators had not acted beyond their powers.

Some local residents also objected to Wandsworth&#x27;s planning permissions for the site (where Wandsworth were both the applicant and planning authority), and two permissions were quashed by the High Court in early 2013 over technicalities. The technicalities were corrected and the planning permission subsequently re-obtained. The residents made a public appeal to fund their legal challenge, raising £25,000 from a few dozen donors. The Wimbledon and Putney Commons Conservators joined forces legally with Wandsworth, appointing Wandsworth to build the roads.

The land sold by the Conservators to the council will be tarmacked for some 110 metres (120 yards), and lined with bollards, in addition to street lighting, tarmacked footpaths and electronic barriers, which objectors say will suburbanise and alter the natural state of the Common. The Conservators refused the sustainable transport charity Sustrans permission to upgrade an adjacent path to a cycle path on the grounds that it would &quot;alter the natural state of the commons&quot;. The Open Spaces Society gave financial support to the residents in taking the case to the Court of Appeal, saying in December 2013: &quot;This is a unique green lung, which the society helped to save back in the 1870s. We are not prepared to stand by and see it destroyed now.&quot;

In August 2016 the Charity Commission announced a Statutory Inquiry into the potential loss due to granting of an easement for access rights to Putney Lower Common.

In July 2020, nearly four years after the Inquiry commenced, the Charity Commission published the results of their Statutory Inquiry, concluding that the easement may have been transferred at an undervalue. Charity Commission Statutory Inquiry Conclusion

On 4 August 2020, &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper published an article suggesting that the Charity Commission&#x27;s Statutory Inquiry was a whitewash, as criticism of the deal and trustees was removed when the report was challenged by lawyers acting for Sir Ian Andrews. In the article the Labour MP Dame Margaret Hodge questioned whether the commission was &#x27;fit for purpose&#x27;, due to the changes. Putney&#x27;s MP, Fleur Anderson described the report as a &#x27;whitewash&#x27;.

==Keepers==

The Wimbledon and Putney Commons Act 1871 contains a provision to allow the Conservators to have Officers attested as constables for the purposes of enforcing the provisions of the Act and all bylaws made there under.

There was resistance at the time to a similar provision in the draft Bill that preceded the Act, whereby an article in &quot;The Spectator&quot; in January 1865 objected to the creation of &#x27;Spencerian Police&#x27;. The article refers to draft Bill as it was published in draft in 1864, whereby the article suggests that the Bill contained a provision for the appointment of Special Constables with full police powers. It would seem that this provision was removed in favour of the provision that allowed the attestation of constables just for the purposes of enforcing the Act itself and the byelaws made there under.

In addition to the ability to swear in constables, the Act creates a power of arrest for any officer of the Conservators or a constable when the details of a person suspected of committing a byelaws offences cannot be obtained (e.g. details refused or suspected of being false). Whilst it is unlikely that this power would be used by anyone other than a Keeper in modern times, a theoretical power of arrest exists for any staff and for any member or the public that they call upon for assistance.

The historic role of the Keeper was captured in a 1959 British Pathé film, which showed them dressed in bowler hats and tweeds being inspected by the Warden (a former Lieutenant Colonel) before going about their daily routine of tackling summer fires and challenging golfers who were not in appropriate attire.

<text>Anthology of Twentieth-Century British and Irish Poetry is a poetry anthology edited by Keith Tuma, and published in 2001 by Oxford University Press. Tuma is an American academic, and author of the somewhat despairing &quot;Fishing by Obstinate Isles: Modern and Postmodern British Poetry and American Readers&quot; (1998), on the topic of the perceived gap between &#x27;mainstream&#x27; British poetry and the possible American reception (particularly in academia). The choice of poets (it, clearly enough, operating at the level of poets as much as poems) is therefore some gesture at remedying a gulf supposed to have opened when Ezra Pound left London for Paris.
