<text>Pacific Coliseum, locally known as The Coliseum or the Rink on Renfrew, is an indoor arena located at Hastings Park in Vancouver, British Columbia. Its main use has been for ice hockey and the arena has been the home for several ice hockey teams.

The arena was the home of the Vancouver Giants of the Western Hockey League (WHL), from 2001 to 2016. Other hockey tenants of the Pacific Coliseum have been the Vancouver Canucks (Western Hockey League) from 1968 to 1970, Vancouver Canucks (National Hockey League) from 1970 to 1995, the Vancouver Nats (WHL) from 1972 to 1973, the Vancouver Blazers (World Hockey Association) from 1973 to 1975, and the Vancouver Voodoo (Roller Hockey International) from 1994 to 1995.

It was completed in 1968 on the site of the Pacific National Exhibition. Its architect and plans were also used for Edmonton&#x27;s Northlands Coliseum. Originally holding 15,038 for ice hockey, capacity has fluctuated slightly over the years and currently holds 16,281. During the 2010 Olympic Winter Games, it was the venue for figure skating and short track speed skating. The arena also hosts a variety of concerts and other events.

==History==

Designed by W. K. Noppe in 1966–67, with its simple geometric shape and distinctive ring of white panels, the building can be classified as formalist architecture. Used initially as home to the WHL&#x27;s Vancouver Canucks, the building was used to attract an NHL franchise in 1970 and a World Hockey Association franchise in 1973. The Coliseum underwent renovations and additions in the late 1970s, but its role as host of an NHL team and a main venue for events in Vancouver was lost with the construction and opening of General Motors Place (now Rogers Arena) in 1995.

The original centre-hung scoreclock was replaced during the 1985 renovations (this renovation work included seismic upgrades to the facility) by a new four-sided centre-hung scoreclock with colour matrix animation/matrix displays along with electronic message boards across the bottom on each side (the original sponsors for this clock were Imperial Tobacco and Molson Brewery), which in 2007 was replaced by a four-sided Daktronics scoreboard with a video display on each side.

Recent renovations were completed in 2007 to upgrade accessibility, seating, HVAC, and ice surface for its use as a venue for the 2010 Winter Olympics. During the renovations prior to the Olympics major upgrades were done to the ice plant at Pacific Coliseum. The adjacent Agrodome ice plant was decommissioned and both buildings now share the same system located at the Coliseum.

In early 2023 the Pacific Coliseum retired its scoreclock, donating it to the Sunshine Coast Junior Hockey Society in Gibson, British Columbia. Video screens were added to the north end of the arena and concourse walls.

In June 2023 a $2.6 million lighting project installed LED lighting around the exterior walls of the venue, allowing the arena to light up with different colours to recognize different events, dates and occasions.

===Seating capacity===

The seating capacity for hockey has progressed as follows:
*15,038 (1968–1970)
*15,570 (1970–1978)
*16,413 (1978–1982)
*16,553 (1983–1989)
*16,123 (1989–1992)
*16,150 (1992–2006)
*16,281 (2006–present)

==Sports==
The arena hosted the fourth game of the 1972 Summit Series on September 8, when the Soviet Union defeated Canada 5–3. In a famous post-game interview, Phil Esposito voiced his displeasure with the Vancouver crowd&#x27;s reaction to their loss in an interview that was broadcast on national television.

The WHA Vancouver Blazers started playing at the Coliseum in 1973 when local businessman Jim Pattison bought the team from the Philadelphia Blazers ownership team. The team would last two years before moving to Calgary, becoming the Calgary Cowboys.

The Coliseum played host to the 2001 Mann Cup, where the hosting WLA Coquitlam Adanacs defeated MSL&#x27;s Brampton Excelsiors in seven games.

===2010 Winter Olympics===
The Coliseum played host to figure skating and short-track speed skating events for the XXI Olympic Winter Games in Vancouver, from February 12 to 28, 2010.

===Vancouver Canucks===
The arena hosted its first NHL game on October 9, 1970, where the Los Angeles Kings defeated the Vancouver Canucks 3–1 in the Canucks&#x27; NHL debut. The Kings&#x27; Bob Berry scored the first goal, with Barry Wilkins scoring the first goal for the Canucks. Its final NHL game was played May 27, 1995, with the Chicago Blackhawks defeating the Canucks 4–3 to sweep them out of the 1995 Stanley Cup Playoffs in the second round.

The 25-year tenure of the Canucks would see the Stanley Cup Finals come to the Coliseum twice; once in , where the New York Islanders would complete their sweep of the Canucks in Vancouver on May 16, 1982, and again in where they would lose to the New York Rangers in a seven-game thriller. Former owner Arthur Griffiths called the sixth game of the 1994 series, the only Stanley Cup Finals game that the Canucks would ever win at the Coliseum, to be &quot;The greatest game ever played at the Pacific Coliseum,&quot; and sent the entire city into a frenzy in its wake. The Coliseum would host a viewing of game 7, which the Canucks would lose by a goal, after Nathan LaFayette&#x27;s potential tying shot went off the post.

Pacific Coliseum also played host to the 1977 NHL All-Star Game, which saw the Wales Conference All-Stars defeat the Campbell Conference All-Stars 4–3.

The final NHL goal scored in the arena belongs to the Chicago Blackhawks&#x27; Chris Chelios, as the Blackhawks completed a four-game sweep of the Canucks in the 1995 Stanley Cup Playoffs&#x27; second round. Roman Oksiuta scored the Canucks&#x27; last goal in the building.

===Junior hockey===

Pacific Coliseum first hosted the Memorial Cup in 1977, when Stan Smyl and the New Westminster Bruins won their first Memorial Cup championship by defeating the Ottawa 67&#x27;s, 6–5. Smyl would eventually have a successful thirteen-year NHL career playing with the Vancouver Canucks at the arena, eventually having his #12 retired by the team on November 3, 1991; the first number that the team would retire, and the only one retired by the Canucks during their time at the Coliseum.

After the departure of the Canucks in 1995, hockey returned to the Rink on Renfrew with the inaugural season of the WHL Vancouver Giants in 2001, where they would stay until dwindling attendance numbers would cause them to move to the Langley Events Centre after the 2015–16 season.

The arena was one of four arenas to play host to the 2006 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships, alongside Rogers Arena, Prospera Place in Kelowna, and the Sandman Centre in Kamloops.

In 2006, the Giants were chosen to host the 2007 Memorial Cup Tournament. During this tournament, the arena surpassed the all-time Memorial Cup attendance record; after seven round-robin games 91,808 attended, and the tournament would eventually finish with a total attendance of 121,461. In the same tournament, the Vancouver Giants won their first Memorial Cup championship, by defeating the WHL champion Medicine Hat Tigers, 3–1. The Giants had lost the WHL final in seven games to the Tigers earlier in the season.

===Volleyball===
The 2020 Men&#x27;s Volleyball North American Olympic Qualification Tournament took place at the coliseum. Canada went 3–0 in the tournament, which qualified the team for the 2020 Summer Olympics.

<doc id="768472" wikidata="Q4705940" url="?curid=768472" title="Alamo (sculpture)">
<text>Alamo, also known as the Astor Place Cube or simply The Cube, is an outdoor sculpture by Tony Rosenthal, located on Astor Place, in the East Village neighborhood of Manhattan in New York City. It is a black cube, long on each side, mounted on a corner. The cube is made of Cor-Ten steel and weighs about . The faces of the cube are not flat but have various indentations, protrusions, and ledges. The sculpture&#x27;s name, &quot;Alamo&quot;, is designated on a small plaque on the base and was selected by the artist&#x27;s wife because its scale and mass reminded her of the Alamo Mission. It was fabricated by Lippincott, Inc.

==History==
Installed in 1967 as part of &quot;Sculpture and the Environment&quot;, organized by the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs, the cube was one of 25 temporary art installations that were intended to remain for a six-month period; however, local residents successfully petitioned the city to keep &quot;Alamo&quot;. It has since become a popular meeting place in the East Village. It stands in an intersection, across the street from two entrances to the Astor Place subway station, as well as the Cooper Union Foundation Building.

The cube rotates around a hidden pole in its center. The cube&#x27;s sculptor Tony Rosenthal never intended for &quot;Alamo&quot; to spin, saying in 2005: &quot;I actually thought we would put it on this post and we’d turn it to the position we wanted it and then stick it like that.&quot; However, the cube was never locked in place. One observer described spinning the cube as &quot;part of the New York experience&quot;.
On March 10, 2005, the Parks Department removed the &quot;Cube&quot; for maintenance. The original artist and crew replaced a missing bolt, and made a few other minor repairs. A makeshift replica made of polyvinyl chloride tubes, named the &quot;Jello Cube&quot; in honor of Peter Cooper, was placed in its stead. In November 2005, the &quot;Cube&quot; returned with a fresh coat of black paint, still able to spin. In October 2015, the sculpture was covered in a protective wooden box because of the redevelopment of Astor Place, but was eventually removed off-site again for &quot;restoration and repainting&quot; and to keep it &quot;out of harm&#x27;s way,&quot; according to a representative of the New York City Parks Department. On November 1, 2016, the sculpture returned to Astor Place after a $180,000 reconstruction and rust removal. In November 2017, the Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation celebrated the sculpture&#x27;s 50th year anniversary of its installation.

By May 2022, the New York City Department of Transportation, which was responsible for the sculpture&#x27;s maintenance, determined that problems with spinning the structure could cause further damage. According to city engineers, the cube was in danger of tipping over if it continued to spin. The city locked it in place with metal braces until additional work on the pivot could eventually prove sufficient to permit it to spin freely again. In May 2023, the DOT announced the cube had been removed and would be refurbished offsite at a Connecticut foundry. The sculpture was returned to Astor Place as in August 2023.

== Similar cubes ==
&quot;Alamo&quot; is one of seven similar cubes created by Rosenthal. The identical &quot;Endover&quot; stands on the campus of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan, where Rosenthal earned a bachelor of fine arts degree. The cube was donated by the class of 1965 and was installed in 1968. The &quot;Endover&quot; cube also rotates but its pivot is sunken into the ground, as opposed to the pivot of the &quot;Alamo&quot;, which is on a separate platform.

==Pranks==
* In June 2003, the &quot;Cube&quot; was the subject of a prank played by the ATF squad (All Too Flat) in which it was turned into a giant Rubik&#x27;s Cube. The cube stayed up for about 24 hours before NYC maintenance removed the painted cardboard panels from the sculpture.
* In March 2006, the Graffiti Research Lab distributed LED throwies to a group of people to throw onto and decorate the &quot;Cube&quot;.
* In April 2006, a tub of chalk was left by the &quot;Cube&quot; and passersby began to draw on it. Seven individuals were later arrested for vandalism. The chalk was washed off by NYC maintenance the following morning.
* In October 2011, the visual artist Olek (Agata Oleksiak) made a crochet covering with their signature camouflage pattern over the cube.
* On December 14, 2011, Caltech students covered the cube in a fitted cloth, making it resemble the Weighted Companion Cube from the video game &quot;Portal&quot;.
* In October 2013, a fake documentary video went viral claiming to show that a man lived inside the cube.
* For Halloween 2015, a man dressed up as &quot;The Cube&quot; and stood in its place. At the time &quot;Alamo&quot; was temporarily off-site because Astor Place was being rebuilt.

<text>James Harrison (December 11, 1937 – March 26, 2016) was an American poet, novelist, and essayist. He was a prolific and versatile writer publishing over three dozen books in several genres including poetry, fiction, nonfiction, children&#x27;s literature, and memoir. He wrote screenplays, book reviews, literary criticism, and published essays on food, travel, and sport. Harrison indicated that, of all his writing, his poetry meant the most to him.

Harrison published 24 novellas during his lifetime and is considered &quot;America&#x27;s foremost master&quot; of that form. His first commercial success came with the 1979 publication of the trilogy of novellas &quot;Legends of the Fall,&quot; two of which were made into movies.

Harrison&#x27;s work has been translated into multiple languages including Spanish, French, Greek, Chinese, and Russian. He was the recipient of multiple awards and honors including a Guggenheim Fellowship (1969), the Mark Twain Award for distinguished contributions to Midwestern literature (1990), and induction into the American Academy of Arts &amp; Letters (2007). Harrison wrote that &quot;The dream that I could write a good poem, a good novel, or even a good movie for that matter, has devoured my life.&quot;

==Biography==
Harrison was born in Grayling, Michigan, to Winfield Sprague Harrison, a county agricultural agent, and Norma Olivia (Wahlgren) Harrison, both avid readers. Harrison was born 18 months after oldest child John, with whom Jim was close. Jim&#x27;s younger siblings are Judith and then Mary and David. He became blind in one eye after a childhood accident. He wrote about his eye in an early poem:

Harrison graduated from Haslett High School (Haslett, Michigan) in 1956. When he was 24, on November 21, 1962, his father and sister Judy died in an automobile accident.

In 1959, he married Linda King, with whom he had two daughters. He was educated at Michigan State University, where he received a B.A. (1960) and M.A. (1964) in comparative literature. After a short stint as assistant professor of English at Stony Brook University (1965–66), Harrison started working full-time as a writer. His awards include National Academy of Arts grants (1967, 1968, and 1969), a Guggenheim Fellowship (1969–70), the Spirit of the West Award from the Mountain &amp; Plains Booksellers Association, and election to the American Academy of Arts and Letters (2007).

His work has appeared in many leading publications, including &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, &quot;Esquire&quot;, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;Outside&quot;, &quot;Playboy&quot;, &quot;Men&#x27;s Journal&quot;, and &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot;. He published several collections of novellas, two of which were eventually turned into films: &quot;Revenge&quot; (1990) and &quot;Legends of the Fall&quot; (1994).

Much of Harrison&#x27;s writing is set in sparsely populated regions of North America and its West. Many stories are set in places such as Nebraska&#x27;s Sand Hills, Michigan&#x27;s Upper Peninsula, Montana&#x27;s mountains, and along the Arizona–Mexico border.

Harrison lived in Patagonia, Arizona, Livingston, Montana, and Grand Marais, Michigan. On August 31, 2009, he was featured in an episode of Anthony Bourdain&#x27;s television show &quot;No Reservations,&quot; which took place in and around Livingston. He also appeared during season 7 of Bourdain&#x27;s CNN series, &quot;Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown&quot;, in an episode which first aired on May 15, 2016.

Harrison died of a heart attack on March 26, 2016, in Patagonia, Arizona.

==Prose works==

===Early career===
Harrison said he became a novelist after he fell off a cliff while bird hunting. During his convalescence, his friend Thomas McGuane suggested he write a novel, and &quot;Wolf: A False Memoir&quot; (1971) was the result. It is the story of a man who tells his life story while searching for signs of a wolf in the northern Michigan wilderness. This was followed by &quot;A Good Day to Die&quot; (1973), an ecotage novel and statement about the decline of American ecological systems, and &quot;Farmer&quot; (1976), a &quot;Lolita&quot;-like account of a country school teacher and farmer coming to grips with middle age, his mother&#x27;s dying, and complications of human sexuality.

Harrison&#x27;s first novellas were published in 1979 under the title &quot;Legends of the Fall&quot;. The actor Jack Nicholson, a close friend of Harrison&#x27;s whom he had met through Thomas McGuane, played a peripheral role in the creation of that book. When Nicholson heard that Harrison was broke, he sent $30,000, which allowed Harrison to write &quot;Legends of the Fall&quot;. The title novella is an epic story that spans 50 years and tells the tale of a father and three sons in the vast spaces of the northern Rocky Mountains around the time of World War I. Referring to the title novella, Harrison said:&quot;I wrote &quot;Legends of the Fall&quot; in nine days and when I re-read it, I only had to change one word. There was no revision process. None. I had thought so much about the character that writing the book was like taking dictation. I felt overwhelmed when I finished, I needed to take a vacation, but the book was done.&quot; The novella format would become an important part of both Harrison&#x27;s future reputation and his output. Following &quot;Legends of the Fall&quot;, seven more collections of novellas appeared over the course of Harrison&#x27;s lifetime: &quot;The Woman Lit by Fireflies&quot; (1990), &quot;Julip&quot; (1994), &quot;The Beast God Forgot to Invent&quot; (2000), &quot;The Summer He Didn&#x27;t Die&quot; (2005), &quot;The Farmer&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (2009), &quot;The River Swimmer&quot; (2013), and finally &quot;The Ancient Minstrel&quot; (2016), the latter appearing just before Harrison&#x27;s death in March of that year.

After publishing &quot;Warlock&quot; (1981) and &quot;Sundog&quot; (1984), Harrison published &quot;Dalva&quot; (1988), one of his best-known novels. It is a complex tale, set in rural Nebraska, of a woman&#x27;s search for the son she had given up for adoption and for the boy&#x27;s father, who also happened to be her half-brother. Throughout the narrative, Dalva invokes the memory of her pioneer great-grandfather John Wesley Northridge, an Andersonville survivor during the Civil War and naturalist, whose diaries vividly tell of the destruction of the Plains Indian way of life. Many of these characters are featured also in &quot;The Road Home&quot; (1998), a complex work using five narrators, including Dalva, her 30-year-old son Nelse, and her grandfather John Wesley Northridge II. Harrison has been described as trying to get at &quot;the soul history of where you live&quot; in this sequel to &quot;Dalva&quot;, in this case rural Nebraska in the latter half of the 20th century.

By the time Harrison turned 60 in 1998, he had published both a dozen works of fiction and another dozen volumes of poetry.

===Later life and writings===
In terms of his publishing career, Harrison&#x27;s final 18 years, after he turned 60, would be nearly as productive as the preceding 30 years. After age 60, he published another dozen works of fiction, at least six more volumes of poetry, a memoir &quot;Off to the Side&quot;, and &quot;The Raw and the Cooked: Adventures of a Roving Gourmand&quot;, a collection of his food essays which had first appeared in magazines, mostly in &quot;Esquire&quot; and &quot;Men&#x27;s Journal&quot;.

Although he continued writing in the novella format, during these final years (1999–2016), Harrison refocused his efforts on the longer novel form. In the 2000s, Harrison published two of the most ambitious novels, setting them in Michigan&#x27;s Upper Peninsula: &quot;True North&quot; (2004) and its sequel &quot;Returning to Earth&quot; (2007). &quot;True North&quot; examines the costs to a timber and mining family torn apart by alcoholism and the moral recklessness of a war-damaged father. The novel contains two stories: that of the monstrous father and that of the son&#x27;s trying to atone for his father&#x27;s evil, and ultimately, reconciling with his family&#x27;s history.

&quot;Returning to Earth&quot; (2007) revisits the characters and setting of &quot;True North&quot; (2004) 30 years later. The story has four narrators: Donald, a mixed-blood Indian, now middle-aged and dying of Lou Gehrig&#x27;s disease; Donald&#x27;s wife Cynthia, whom he rescued as a teen from the ruins of her family; Cynthia&#x27;s brother David (the central character of &quot;True North&quot;); and K, Cynthia&#x27;s nephew and Donald&#x27;s soul mate. Ultimately, the extended family helps Donald end his life at the place of his choosing, and then draw on the powers of love and commitment to reconcile loss and heal wounds borne for generations.

Harrison&#x27;s &quot;The English Major&quot; (2008) is a road novel about a 60-year-old former high school English teacher and farmer from Michigan, who after a divorce and the sale of his farm, heads westward on a mind-clearing road trip. Along the way, he falls into an affair with a former student, reconnects with his big-shot son in San Francisco, confers on questions of life and lust with an old doctor friend, and undertakes a project to rename all the states and their state birds.

Harrison wrote two darkly comic detective novels, &quot;The Great Leader: A Faux Mystery&quot; (Grove Press, 2012) and &quot;The Big Seven&quot; (Grove Press, 2015), both focused on protagonist Detective Sunderson. &quot;The Great Leader: A Faux Mystery&quot; was positively reviewed in&quot; The New York Times&quot;, with critic Pete Dexter calling Harrison&#x27;s writing &quot;very close to magic.&quot;

==Poetry==
=== Publication history ===
Inspired by his study of Pablo Neruda, Harrison completed what he called his first acceptable poems in the early 1960s. In 1965 he had several poems published in &quot;The Nation&quot; and &quot;Poetry&quot; and then, with the assistance of the poet Denise Levertov, he published his first poetry collection &quot;Plain Song&quot; (1965).

Over the course of his life Harrison published his poetry in many periodicals including &quot;Virginia Quarterly Review&quot;, &quot;Triquarterly&quot;, &quot;The American Poetry Review&quot;, and &quot;The New York Times Book Review.&quot; He published 17 collections of poetry (the number includes chapbooks, limited editions, and coauthored works). &quot;The Shape of the Journey: New and Collected Poems&quot; (1998) collects over 120 of his poems. The posthumous &quot;Jim Harrison: The Essential Poems&quot; (2019) was selected from nearly 1000 poems that Harrison wrote.

Harrison was aware that his poetry did not have mass appeal. He wrote that to draw attention to poetry &quot;you would have to immolate a volunteer poet in an 751 BMW&quot;. He hoped that by choosing a small press like Copper Canyon Press, his poetry collections would stay in print.

&quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Float&quot; (2016), his final book of poetry, was published the year of his death.

=== Influences ===
Harrison began his study of poetry as a teenager and, as a young man, thought of himself as &quot;a poet and nothing else&quot;. His earliest influences included Arthur Rimbaud, Richard Wright, and Walt Whitman.

Harrison studied a multitude of English speaking poets including W.B. Yeats, Dylan Thomas, Robert Bly, and Robert Duncan. Harrison also cited a diverse set of influences from world poetry including: French Symbolist poetry; the Russian poets Georgy Ivanov and Vladimir Mayakovsky; the German poet Rainier Maria Rilke; and Chinese Tang dynasty poetry. He felt a particular affinity for the French poet Rene Char and the Russian poet Sergei Yesenin as they both came &quot;from humble beginnings out in the country&quot;. Harrison&#x27;s sequence of prose poems &quot;Letters to Yesenin&quot; (1973) was inspired by Yesenin.

Harrison&#x27;s practice of Zen Buddhism was important to his poetry, in part because it kept his &quot;head from flying off&quot;. He became aware of Zen inspired poetry &quot;by way of poets like Clayton Eshleman and Cid Corman, and most powerfully of all through Gary Snyder&quot;&quot;.&quot; He wrote that his long poem &quot;The Theory and Practice of Rivers (1986)&quot; was &quot;basically Zennist&quot;. His sequence of 57 poems &quot;After Ikkyū&quot; (1996) is entitled after the Zen monk Ikkyū and was occasioned by his study of the Zen sages Tung-shan and Yunmen.

=== Nature poetry ===
Harrison&#x27;s poetry often concerns itself with the natural world. Nonhuman creatures, especially birds and dogs, populate his poetry and wild, uncivilized places are frequent settings. Harrison&#x27;s poetry &quot;returns us to some level of understanding about our relationship to other life on the planet&quot;. Harrison wrote that his &quot;intimacy with the natural world has been a substitute for religion, or a religion of another sort.&quot; &quot;The River&quot;, one of Harrison&#x27;s later poems, is illustrative:

==Harrison bibliographies and interviews==
In 2009, University of Nebraska Press published &quot;Jim Harrison: A Comprehensive Bibliography, 1964–2008&quot;, an illustrated guide to Harrison&#x27;s published works, edited by Gregg Orr and Beef Torrey, with an introduction by Robert DeMott, which contains more than 1600 citations of writing by and about Harrison. Many of Harrison&#x27;s papers are housed at Grand Valley State University in Allendale, Michigan.

Harrison was interviewed in 2004 in Paris by François Busnel, and asked how he explained the success of his novel, &quot;True North&quot;, in the United States where his previous books were not successful. Harrison replied, &quot;The age, undoubtedly! Or a proof that America loves France, since it is said often over there that I am the most French of the American writers.&quot;

Many of Harrison&#x27;s interviews between 1976 and 1999 are collected in the book, &quot;Conversations with Jim Harrison&quot;, edited by Robert DeMott, published by the University Press of Mississippi, 2002. Harrison discusses his poetry in an extensive interview in &quot;Five Points Magazine.&quot;

==Film work==
Harrison&#x27;s work on films and in the screenplay format began with his book &quot;Legends of the Fall&quot;, when he sold the film rights for all three stories in the book and became involved in writing the screenplay for the film with the same title. It was directed by Edward Zwick and starred Brad Pitt, Anthony Hopkins, and Aidan Quinn; it won the 1995 Academy Award for cinematography. Jim Harrison had a writing credit for the film.

Other films he scripted or co-wrote include &quot;Cold Feet&quot; (1989), with Keith Carradine, Tom Waits, and Rip Torn, and &quot;Revenge&quot; (1990), starring Kevin Costner. For his work on the screenplay for &quot;Wolf&quot; (1994, starring Jack Nicholson) Harrison, along with co-writer Wesley Strick, shared the Saturn Award for Best Writing.

<text>George Smith Patton IV (December 24, 1923 – June 27, 2004) was a major general in the United States Army and the son of World War II General George S. Patton Jr. He served in the Korean War and the Vietnam War.

==Career==
Patton was educated at The Hill School. Patton entered West Point in 1942 and graduated four years later in 1946 as an infantry officer. While serving at West Point, his father died, and the younger Patton dropped the Roman numeral from his name. Technically the fourth &#x27;George Smith Patton&#x27;, he is sometimes remembered as &#x27;George Patton III&#x27; as his father was called Patton Jr. 

His first assignment was to Regensburg, West Germany, where he participated in the 1948 Berlin Airlift. The troops under his command were used to load supplies onto Air Force transport aircraft bound for Berlin. In 1952, he joined C Company, 63rd Tank Battalion, 1st Infantry Division, as a platoon leader. A year after he returned from Germany, he married Joanne Holbrook in 1952
===Korean War===
Patton served in the Korean War from February 1953, commanding &quot;A&quot; Company of the 140th Tank Battalion, 40th Infantry Division. He received his first Silver Star and the Purple Heart in Korea.

Returning to the United States in 1954, Patton, now a captain, was initially assigned to West Point, but was quickly picked up as part of an exchange program and was sent to teach at the United States Naval Academy.

===Vietnam War===
Patton served a total of three tours of duty in South Vietnam, the first from April 1962 to April 1963 at Military Assistance Command, Vietnam, during which he was promoted to lieutenant colonel. He then took command of the 2nd Battalion, 81st Armor of the 1st Armored Division at Fort Hood Texas, before his second tour in 1967, this one lasting only three months. During Patton&#x27;s final and most intense tour, lasting from January 1968 to January 1969, he was awarded two Distinguished Service Crosses for his actions on the battlefield. During this final tour, he was initially assigned as Chief of Operations and Plans at Headquarters, United States Army Vietnam. However, after his promotion to colonel in April 1968, he was given command of the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment. During his three tours in Vietnam, Patton, who frequently used helicopters as a mobile command post, was shot down three times and was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross and a second Silver Star.

===Post-war===
After Vietnam, Patton was promoted to brigadier general in June 1970 before becoming the commanding general of the 2nd Armored Division, in 1975, as a major general. This was a unit his father had commanded just before the United States had entered World War II, making this the first time in United States Army history that a father and a son had both commanded the same division.

Brigadier General Patton was deputy post commander at Fort Knox, Kentucky, during 1972. He was also assistant commandant of the Armor School at the same time.

Patton was assigned to the VII Corps in Germany, as the deputy commander. He was stationed near Stuttgart, where Manfred Rommel, son of Field Marshal Erwin Rommel, was a government official who later became the city&#x27;s mayor. The sons of the two former adversaries entered a much publicized friendship, which continued until Patton&#x27;s death in 2004. From 5 August 1975 to 3 November 1977, he commanded the 2nd Armored Division at Fort Hood, Texas.

==Awards and decorations==
Patton&#x27;s military awards include:
;Badges

;Decorations

;Unit Award

;Service Medals

;Foreign Awards
==Later life and death==

In the years after his retirement in 1980, Patton turned an estate owned by his father located north of Boston into the Green Meadows Farm, where he named the fields after soldiers who died under his command in Vietnam.

Patton befriended the mayor of Stuttgart, Manfred Rommel, the son of his father&#x27;s wartime opposing general Erwin Rommel. The two remained friends after Patton&#x27;s retirement from the armed forces.

During the first years after his retirement from the Army, Patton was interviewed by journalist Kim Willenson for his book &quot;The Bad War: An Oral History of the Vietnam War&quot;, which was published in June 1987. In the 1990s, Patton worked alongside author Brian Sobel to write &quot;The Fighting Pattons&quot;, a book that serves as an official family biography of his father as well as a comparison between the military of his father&#x27;s generation and that of his own, a time which covered five conflicts and almost 70 years of combined service. &quot;The Fighting Pattons&quot; was published in 1997.

He died from a form of Parkinson&#x27;s disease at the age of 80 in 2004.

==Personal life==
Patton was the fourth in his line to be named George Smith Patton. His great-grandfather, the first George Smith Patton, was a colonel in the Confederate army during the American Civil War. Commanding a brigade at the Battle of Opequon, also known as the Third Battle of Winchester on September 19, 1864, he was wounded, captured and died. True to what would be a Patton family characteristic of never admitting defeat, Patton was mortally wounded in a nearly hopeless attempt to rally his men after his brigade had been shot to pieces and all his subordinate regiments&#x27; colors had been captured. Patton&#x27;s grandfather, born George William Patton in 1856, changed his name to George Smith Patton in 1868, in honor of his father. Patton&#x27;s father was George Smith Patton Jr., the renowned World War II general most famous for his command of the Third U.S. Army in Northwest Europe in 1944 and 1945.

Though given the name Junior, Patton&#x27;s father was actually the third George Smith Patton. For this reason, Patton was christened George Smith Patton IV. Following his father&#x27;s death in 1945, Patton changed his legal name to George Smith Patton, dropping the Roman numerals.

His eldest son, technically the fifth George S. Patton, is also known as George Smith Patton Jr. The World War II General Patton&#x27;s youngest grandson, who still is living, has given interviews on the History Channel and the Military Channel, recalling his family heritage.

Another son, Robert H. Patton, has written a history of the Patton family: &quot;The Pattons: A Personal History of an American Family&quot; (Crown, 1994).

His youngest son Benjamin Patton has written a family biography entitled &quot;Growing Up Patton: Reflections on Heroes, History, and Family Wisdom&quot;, which reflected on his grandfather and father&#x27;s careers. Benjamin, a filmmaker, also recorded tapes of his father&#x27;s memories of his own and his grandfather&#x27;s experiences, and those tapes formed the basis of the book &quot;The Fighting Pattons&quot; by Brian M. Sobel.

<text>The eye in the sky is a term given to casino and other commercial security closed circuit cameras. In casinos, they are positioned to monitor seats, tables, hallways, restaurants, and even elevators closely. The functional component is known as a pan–tilt–zoom camera, or a PTZ, an industry standard term.

==Overview==
The PTZ camera is covered by a semi-transparent plastic globe which makes it nearly impossible to see which direction the camera is facing from a distance. Retail stores often install empty globes, giving the appearance of additional cameras. The camera is mounted on a series of interconnected gears and levers, which usually allow two axes of rotation. This rotation can either be controlled manually by an operator using remote control, or it can be automated using motion sensing technology. In most commercial and civilian applications, both control methods are used simultaneously to allow automated surveillance of general movement while allowing a manual over-ride mode to view specific subjects more closely.

==Application==
These cameras often help casino officials judge whether the person is card counting or past posting. In case a crime or a cheat is detected after the fact, the casino employees can review the recorded tapes and find the culprit. The casino cameras are adjusted to focus on certain suspicious players by security workers in a separate casino room with banks of security monitors.

These types of cameras are also found in retail stores as well to monitor customers and employees, such as Walmart or Target. They can also fool robbers into thinking that there is a camera watching them and that they are being monitored by CCTV.

<text>Little Joe 5B was an uncrewed launch escape system test of the Mercury spacecraft, conducted as part of the US Mercury program. The mission used production Mercury spacecraft # 14A. The mission was launched April 28, 1961, from Wallops Island, Virginia. The Little Joe 5B flew to an apogee of 2.8 miles (4.5 km) and a range of 9 miles (14 km). The mission lasted 5 minutes 25 seconds. Maximum speed was 1,780 mph (2865 km/h) and acceleration was 10 g (98 m/s²). The mission was a success and Mercury spacecraft # 14A was recovered.

Mercury spacecraft #14A used in the Little Joe 5B mission, is on display at the Virginia Air and Space Center in Hampton, Virginia.

<doc id="768493" wikidata="Q7840315" url="?curid=768493" title="Tribal Rites of the New Saturday Night">
<text>&quot;Tribal Rites of the New Saturday Night&quot; is the title of a 1976 &quot;New York&quot; article by British rock journalist Nik Cohn, which formed the basis for the plot and inspired the characters for the 1977 movie &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot;.

Originally, the article was published as a piece of factual reporting. However, around the time of the 20th anniversary of the film in 1996, Cohn revealed that it was actually a work of fiction.

After persuading &quot;New York&quot; editor Clay Felker to let him write an article about the 1970s disco scene, Cohn, a newcomer to the United States, set about researching the American working-class subculture he was trying to cover. One night he travelled to Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, to visit the disco 2001 Odyssey. However, when he arrived a drunken fight was taking place outside the club, and one of the participants rolled over in the gutter and threw up on Cohn&#x27;s trouser leg, leading him to return to Manhattan. Despite this brief visit, Cohn did notice that the scene was surveyed by one clubgoer standing in the doorway and calmly watching events. Cohn returned to the club subsequently but the young man was not there.

To overcome his lack of familiarity with the New York disco scene, Cohn combined the image of the figure outside the club with people he knew from his youth, including a gang member from the Northern Ireland city of Derry, where Cohn had grown up, and a young man he knew in England. &quot;My story was a fraud&quot;, he wrote. &quot;I&#x27;d only recently arrived in New York. Far from being steeped in Brooklyn street life, I hardly knew the place. As for Vincent, my story&#x27;s hero, he was largely inspired by a Shepherd&#x27;s Bush mod whom I&#x27;d known in the Sixties, a one-time king of Goldhawk Road.&quot; For additional detail Cohn returned to Bay Ridge during the day to get a better feel for the area.

On the 40th anniversary of the article’s publication in 2016, Cohn said that he thought that such a fictionalised piece would not be published in the contemporary press:

Oleynik began her career as a child actor, first appearing onstage as young Cosette in a national touring production of &quot;Les Misérables&quot; (1989–1991). She was subsequently cast as the titular character in the Nickelodeon series &quot;The Secret World of Alex Mack&quot;, which aired from 1994 to 1998. She also began a film career, starring in an ensemble cast as Dawn Schafer in the film adaptation &quot;The Baby-Sitters Club&quot; (1995), and in a lead role in the teen comedy &quot;10 Things I Hate About You&quot; (1999).

Oleynik subsequently had a supporting role in the comedy &quot;100 Girls&quot; (2000), after which she starred opposite Nastassja Kinski and Scarlett Johansson in the period film &quot;An American Rhapsody&quot; (2001), and the independent drama &quot;Bringing Rain&quot; (2003). She later had supporting roles in &quot;Atlas Shrugged: Part II&quot; (2011) and the horror film &quot;Jessabelle&quot; (2014). From 2010 to 2015, she had a recurring role as Cynthia Cosgrove on the AMC series &quot;Mad Men&quot;, and a voice role as Icy on the Nickelodeon revival of &quot;Winx Club&quot; (2011–2014).

==Early life and education==
Larisa Romanovna Oleynik was born in Santa Clara, California. Her father was of Ukrainian ancestry, and she was raised in the Orthodox tradition. Oleynik was raised in the San Francisco Bay Area. She graduated from the Pinewood School in Los Altos, California, in 1999. As her acting career flourished, she would &quot;divide her time between normal childhood experiences in Northern California and auditions in Los Angeles.&quot;

After the success in her role as Alex Mack, Oleynik decided to attend college, enrolling at Sarah Lawrence College in Yonkers, New York, which she later described as &quot;the best decision I’ve made&quot;.

==Career==
===1989–2002===
Oleynik began acting in a San Francisco production of &quot;Les Misérables&quot; in 1989 after seeing an audition ad in a newspaper when she was eight years old. She obtained two parts in the production (young Cosette and young Eponine), both with singing roles. After appearing in the musical, she was referred to an agent by her &quot;Les Misérables&quot; co-star, Rider Strong, and began to take formal acting lessons. &quot;I remember being 10 years old and thinking, &#x27;I want to be good at this&#x27;... It wasn&#x27;t about, &#x27;I want to be on TV&#x27;. It was more looking around at the other kids and being like, &#x27;I&#x27;m not good at sports, I&#x27;m not really smart. I think I could be good at this, though&#x27;.&quot;

Her onscreen acting career began at age 12, in a 1993 episode of the television series &quot;Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman&quot;; the same year, she also appeared in the made-for-television film &quot;River of Rage: The Taking of Maggie Keene&quot;.

Later, in 1993, she was cast in the lead role of the series &quot;The Secret World of Alex Mack&quot;, where she portrayed a teenage girl who gains superpowers in a chemical accident. She won the role of Alex Mack over 400 other aspirants. The series ran on Nickelodeon from 1994 to 1998 and was one of the network&#x27;s top three most watched shows, becoming quite a favorite among the child and teen audiences and turning Oleynik into a teen idol. During the show&#x27;s heyday, children who met Oleynik (and were too young to understand special effects) would often ask her to &quot;morph&quot; for them. Rather than try to explain things, she would quickly glance around, then tell them, &quot;Not here – everybody would see!&quot;. Oleynik reprised the role in an &quot;All That&quot; sketch, although the name was changed to &quot;Alex Sax&quot;. She later made an appearance in the 100th episode of the show.

In 1996, she made a cameo on the series &quot;The Adventures of Pete &amp; Pete&quot; as a nurse at the beginning of the episode &quot;Dance Fever&quot;. Also during her time on &quot;The Secret World of Alex Mack&quot;, she played Dawn Schafer, one of the lead characters in the 1995 feature film &quot;The Baby-Sitters Club&quot; (1995), opposite Rachael Leigh Cook and Schuyler Fisk, appeared in several episodes of &quot;Boy Meets World&quot;, wrote an advice column for &quot;Tiger Beat&quot; magazine, and was involved in Nickelodeon&#x27;s &quot;The Big Help&quot; charity, &quot;Hands Across Communication&quot;, &quot;Surfrider Foundation&quot; and the &quot;Starlight Children&#x27;s Foundation&quot;. She has also hosted the CableACE Awards, Daytime Emmy Awards, YTV Achievement Awards, The Nickelodeon Kids&#x27; Choice Awards as well as &quot;The Big Help&quot;. She has commented that she stayed &quot;grounded&quot; during her period as a teen star, mainly through the help of a &quot;strong network of people&quot; that she was close to.

After &quot;The Secret World of Alex Mack&quot; ended its run, Oleynik had a starring role in the film &quot;10 Things I Hate About You&quot; as Bianca. The film was released in April 1999, and did fairly well at the box office, grossing a total of $38 million domestically. From 1998 to 2000, Oleynik appeared in twenty-one episodes of the NBC series &quot;3rd Rock from the Sun&quot; as Alissa Strudwick. During 2000, she also appeared in two independent films: &quot;100 Girls&quot; (opposite Emmanuelle Chriqui, Katherine Heigl and Jonathan Tucker) and &quot;A Time for Dancing&quot; (opposite Shiri Appleby); neither film received a theatrical release in the United States.

Oleynik had a supporting role in the independent drama film &quot;An American Rhapsody&quot; (2001), opposite Nastassja Kinski and Scarlett Johansson, which follows a young woman whose parents are forced to leave her behind in Communist Hungary while they flee to the United States.

===2003–present===
Oleynik had a supporting part in &quot;Bringing Rain&quot; (2003), a low-budget teen drama starring Adrian Grenier and Paz de la Huerta, which premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival. In 2005, she appeared as a guest star on the series &quot;Malcolm in the Middle&quot; as Reese&#x27;s lesbian army buddy who develops a crush on his mother. Oleynik was cast in a supporting role in the series &quot;Pepper Dennis&quot;, which began airing on The WB in April 2006, but was not picked up by The WB&#x27;s successor The CW. The same year, she starred in the independent drama &quot;Pope Dreams&quot;.

In March 2008, Oleynik guest-starred in episode 13 of &quot;Aliens in America&quot;. In 2009, she provided audio commentary for the &quot;10 Things I Hate About You&quot; 10th Anniversary Edition Blu-ray. In March 2011, Oleynik started appearing in a recurring role on &quot;Hawaii Five-0&quot; as CIA analyst Jenna Kaye, until her character was later killed off. She was subsequently cast in the Ayn Rand adaptation &quot;Atlas Shrugged: Part II&quot; (2012), as Cherryl Brooks, a store clerk who becomes acquainted with the protagonist, Dagny Taggart (portrayed by Samantha Mathis). Oleynik also guest-starred as Ken Cosgrove&#x27;s girlfriend (and later wife) Cynthia Baxter in several episodes on the AMC television series &quot;Mad Men&quot;.

In 2016, Oleynik starred in the one-woman show &quot;I Loved, I Lost, I Made Spaghetti&quot; at the Hangar Theatre in Ithaca, New York. Beginning in 2017, Oleynik starred in the Off-Broadway musical comedy &quot;Baghdaddy&quot;. In 2020, Oleynik starred in the Netflix family comedy series, &quot;The Healing Powers of Dude&quot;. In 2023, it was announced that Oleynik was cast as Sylvia in the Nickelodeon comedy &quot;Erin &amp; Aaron&quot;.

==Personal life==
Oleynik resides in Venice, California. She said that her first kiss was with Rider Strong when she was an actress on &quot;Boy Meets World&quot;. She also says that he was her &quot;first major crush.&quot;

In January 2013, she was granted a restraining order against a stalker who was so obsessed with her that he changed his last name to &quot;Oleynik&quot;.

<doc id="768500" wikidata="Q7187657" url="?curid=768500" title="Lexical definition">
<text>The lexical definition of a term, also known as the dictionary definition, is the definition closely matching the meaning of the term in common usage. As its other name implies, this is the sort of definition one is likely to find in the dictionary. A lexical definition is usually the type expected from a request for definition, and it is generally expected that such a definition will be stated as simply as possible in order to convey information to the widest audience. 

Note that a lexical definition is &quot;descriptive&quot;, reporting actual usage within speakers of a language, and changes with changing usage of the term, rather than &quot;prescriptive&quot;, which would be to stick with a version regarded as &quot;correct&quot;, regardless of drift in accepted meaning. They tend to be inclusive, attempting to capture everything the term is used to refer to, and as such are often too vague for many purposes. 

When the breadth or vagueness of a lexical definition is unacceptable, a precising definition or a stipulative definition is often used. 

Words can be classified as lexical or nonlexical. Lexical words are those that have independent meaning (such as a Noun (N), verb (V), adjective (A), adverb (Adv), or preposition (P)).

The definition which reports the meaning of a word or a phrase as it is actually used by people is called a lexical definition. Meanings of words given in a dictionary are lexical definitions. As a word may have more than one meaning, it may also have more than one lexical definition.

<doc id="768503" wikidata="Q321593" url="?curid=768503" title="Nik Cohn">
<text>Nik Cohn (born 1946), also written Nick Cohn, is a British writer.

==Life and career==
Cohn was born in London, England and brought up in Derry in Northern Ireland. He is the son of historian Norman Cohn and Russian writer Vera Broido. An incomer to the tight-knit town, he spent most of his time at the local record shop and the walk there, from his home on campus at Magee University College, inspired one of his earliest stories, &quot;Delinquent in Derry&quot;. He left the city to attend the Royal Grammar School in Newcastle upon Tyne in England, then moved to London.

Cohn is considered by some critics to have helped originate rock criticism while writing columns for &quot;Queen.&quot; His first major book, &quot;Awopbopaloobop Alopbamboom&quot;, was first published in 1969. Cohn has since published articles, novels and music books regularly.

When reviewing a rough mix of the Who&#x27;s rock opera &quot;Tommy&quot;, he told the group members that the album lacked a hit single. Hearing this, Pete Townshend decided to take the song &quot;Pinball Wizard&quot;, which he had already written knowing that Cohn was a fan of pinball, and incorporate it into the rock opera. Cohn also panned &quot;The Beatles&quot; and &quot;Abbey Road&quot; upon their release in reviews for &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

It has long been rumoured that Cohn&#x27;s novel &quot;I Am Still the Greatest Says Johnny Angelo&quot; was an inspiration for David Bowie&#x27;s album &quot;The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars&quot;.
He wrote the 1976 &quot;New York&quot; article &quot;Tribal Rites of the New Saturday Night&quot;, which was the source material for the movie &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot;. In 1996, Cohn revealed the article to have been a complete fabrication, based only on clubgoers he knew from his native England. 

In the early 1980s, he was indicted on drug trafficking charges for importing $4 million worth of Indian heroin. He refused to give a testimony and the trafficking charges were subsequently dropped. Instead, he was given five years&#x27; probation and fined $5,000 for possession.

Cohn was a columnist for &quot;The Guardian&quot; in the mid- to late 1990s as he researched his book on the underbelly of England, &quot;Yes We Have No: Adventures in the Other England&quot;. He is also a regular contributor to &quot;Granta&quot;. In 2016, &quot;Awopbopaloobop Alopbamboom&quot; was listed by &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s Robert McCrum as one of the &quot;100 Best Nonfiction Books of All Time.&quot; It and &quot;The Heart of the World&quot; were subsequently reissued by Penguin UK&#x27;s Vintage Classics imprint.

<text>In Polynesian mythology, Ira (also known as Hera) is the sky goddess and mother of the stars.

== Background ==
In Greek mythology, Ira is one of the Olympian gods. She is the sister and wife of Zeus, the daughter of Rea and Cronus, and the mother of four daughters- Eve, Aris, Hephaestus and Eileithiia.

== Looks ==
Ira is a beautiful young woman, sometimes wearing a high cylindrical crown. She has an emblem that includes a scepter topped with a cuckoo and a pomegranate, the symbol of married love and fruitfulness. Ira has a peacock sacred to her, showing the services of the hundred-eyed Argus.

<doc id="768511" wikidata="Q9180311" url="?curid=768511" title="Automatic firearm">
<text>An automatic firearm or fully automatic firearm (to avoid confusion with semi-automatic firearms) is a self-loading firearm that continuously chambers and fires rounds when the trigger mechanism is actuated. The action of an automatic firearm is capable of harvesting the excess energy released from a previous discharge to feed a new ammunition round into the chamber, and then igniting the propellant and discharging the projectile (either bullet, shot, or slug) by delivering a hammer or striker impact on the primer.

If &quot;both&quot; the feeding and ignition procedures are automatically cycled, the weapon will be considered &quot;fully automatic&quot; and will fire continuously as long as the trigger is kept depressed and the ammunition feeding (either from a magazine or a belt) remains available. In contrast, a firearm is considered &quot;semi-automatic&quot; if it only automatically cycles to chamber new rounds (i.e. self-loading) but does not automatically fire off the shot unless the user manually resets (usually by releasing) and re-actuates the trigger, so only one round gets discharged with each individual trigger-pull. A burst-fire firearm is an &quot;in-between&quot; of fully and semi-automatic firearms, firing a brief continuous &quot;burst&quot; of multiple rounds with each trigger-pull, but then will require a manual re-actuation of the trigger to fire another burst.

Automatic firearms are further defined by the type of cycling principles used, such as recoil operation, blowback, blow forward, or gas operation.

==Rates of fire==
===Cyclic rate===
Self-loading firearms are designed with varying rates of fire due to having different purposes. The speed with which a self-loading firearm can cycle through the functions of:

# Fire
# Eject
# Load
# Cock

is referred to as its cyclic rate. In fully automatic firearms, the cyclic rate is tailored to the purpose the firearm is intended to serve. Anti-aircraft machine guns often have extremely high rates of fire to maximize the probability of a hit. In infantry support weapons, these rates of fire are often much lower and in some cases, vary with the design of the particular firearm. The MG 34 is a WWII-era machine gun which falls under the category of a &quot;general purpose machine gun&quot;. It was manufactured in several variations: with a cyclic rate as high as 1200 rounds per minute, but also in an infantry model which fired at 900 rounds per minute.

===Effective rate of fire===
Continuous fire generates high temperatures in a firearm&#x27;s barrel and increased temperatures throughout most of its structure. If fired continuously, the components of the firearm will eventually suffer structural failure. All firearms, whether they are semi-automatic, fully automatic, or otherwise, will overheat and fail if fired indefinitely. This issue tends to present itself primarily with fully automatic fire. For example, the MG34 may have a calculated cyclic rate of 1200 rounds per minute, but is likely to overheat and fail in the space of one minute of continuous fire.

Semi-automatic firearms may also overheat if continuously fired. Recoil plays a significant role in the time it takes to reacquire one&#x27;s sight picture, ultimately reducing the effective rate of fire.

==Automatic firearm types==
Automatic firearms can be divided into six main categories:

;Automatic rifle: The standard type of service rifles in most modern militaries, usually capable of selective fire. Assault rifles are a specific type of select-fire rifle chambered in an intermediate cartridge and fed via a high-capacity detachable magazine. Battle rifles are similar, but chambered in a full-powered cartridge.
;Automatic shotgun: A type of combat shotgun capable of firing shotgun shells automatically, usually also semi-automatically.
;Machine gun: A large group of heavier firearms used for suppressive automatic fire of rifle cartridges, usually attached to a mount or supported by a bipod. Depending on size, weight and role, machine guns are divided into heavy, medium or light machine guns. The ammunition is often belt-fed.
;Submachine gun: An automatic, short rifle (carbine) typically chambered for pistol cartridges. Today seldom used in military contexts due to a rise in the use of body armor, they are commonly used by police forces and close protection units in many parts of the world.
;Personal defense weapon: A new breed of automatic firearms that combines the light weight and size of the submachine gun with the medium power caliber ammunition of the rifle, thus in practice creating a submachine gun with body armor penetration capability.
;Machine pistol: A handgun-style firearm, capable of fully automatic or burst fire. They are sometimes equipped with a foldable shoulder stock, to promote accuracy during automatic fire, creating similarities to their submachine gun counterparts. Some machine pistols are shaped similarly to semi-automatics (e.g., the Glock 18, Beretta 93R). As with SMGs, machine pistols fire pistol caliber cartridges (such as the 9mm, .40, .45 ACP etc.).

==Burst mode==

Burst mode is an automatic fire mode that limits the number of rounds fired with each trigger pull, most often to three rounds. After the burst is fired, the firearm will not fire again until the trigger is released and pulled again. Burst mode was implemented into firearms due to the inaccuracy of fully automatic fire in combat, and due to suggestions that fully automatic fire has no genuine benefit. Additionally, many militaries have restricted automatic fire in combat due to the ammunition wasted.

==Regulation==


Possession of automatic firearms tends to be restricted to members of military and law enforcement organizations in most developed countries, even in those that permit the civilian use of semi-automatic firearms. Where automatic weapons are permitted, restrictions and regulations on their possession and use may be much stricter than for other firearms. In the United States, taxes and strict regulations affect the manufacture and sale of fully automatic firearms under the National Firearms Act of 1934 and the Firearm Owners Protection Act of 1986; the latter act banned civilian machine gun ownership, grandfathering in existing legally owned weapons. As legally owned weapons were registered under the NFA this that meant that only previously registered automatic weapons may be purchased. A prospective user must go through an application process administered by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), which requires a federal tax payment of $200 and a thorough criminal background check. The tax payment buys a revenue stamp, which is the legal document allowing possession of an automatic firearm. The use of a gun trust to register with the ATF has become an increasingly popular method of acquisition and ownership of automatic firearms.

==Similar weapons==
Other similar weapons not usually referred to as automatic firearms include the following:

* Autocannon, which are 15 mm or greater in bore diameter and thus considered cannons, not small arms.
* Gatling guns, multiple-barrel designs, often used with external power supplies to generate rates of fire higher than automatic firearms.

<text>Little Joe 5A was an uncrewed launch escape system test of the Mercury spacecraft, conducted as part of the U.S. Mercury program. It was an attempted re-test of the failed Little Joe 5 flight. The mission used production Mercury spacecraft #14 atop a Little Joe booster rocket. The mission was launched March 18, 1961, from Wallops Island, Virginia. The LJ-5 failure sequence was repeated when capsule escape rocket again ignited prematurely with the capsule remaining attached to the booster. In this flight however, a ground command was sent to separate the capsule from the booster and escape tower. This allowed the main and reserve parachutes to deploy and the capsule was recovered with only minor damage. It would be used again on the subsequent Little Joe 5B mission, in a third attempt to achieve mission objectives. The Little Joe 5A flew to an apogee of 7.7 miles (12 km) and a range of . The mission lasted 5 minutes 25 seconds. Maximum speed was and acceleration was 8 G (78 m/s²).

Mercury spacecraft # 14 used in the Little Joe 5A mission, is currently displayed at the Virginia Air and Space Center, Hampton, Virginia.

<text>A. J. Raffles is a British fictional character – a cricketer and gentleman thief – created by E. W. Hornung. Between 1898 and 1909, Hornung wrote a series of 26 short stories, two plays, and a novel about Raffles and his fictional chronicler, Harry &quot;Bunny&quot; Manders.

The first story, &quot;The Ides of March&quot;, appeared in the June 1898 edition of &quot;Cassell&#x27;s Magazine&quot;. The early adventures were collected in &quot;The Amateur Cracksman&quot; and continued with &quot;The Black Mask&quot; (1901). The last collection, &quot;A Thief in the Night&quot; (1904) and the novel &quot;Mr. Justice Raffles&quot; (1909) tell of adventures previously withheld. The novel was poorly received, and no further stories were published.

Hornung dedicated the first collection of stories, &quot;The Amateur Cracksman,&quot; to his brother-in-law, Arthur Conan Doyle, intending Raffles as a &quot;form of flattery.&quot; In contrast to Conan Doyle&#x27;s Holmes and Watson, Raffles and Bunny are &quot;something dark, morally uncertain, yet convincingly, reassuringly English.&quot;

Raffles is an antihero. Although a thief, he &quot;never steals from his hosts, he helps old friends in trouble, and in a subsequent volume he may or may not die on the veldt during the Boer War.&quot; Additionally, the &quot;recognition of the problems of the distribution of wealth is [a] recurrent subtext&quot; throughout the stories.

According to the &quot;Strand Magazine&quot;, these stories made Raffles &quot;the second most popular fictional character of the time,&quot; behind Sherlock Holmes. They have been adapted to film, television, stage, and radio, with the first appearing in 1903.

== Plot ==
The &quot;Raffles&quot; stories have two distinct phases. In the first phase, Raffles and Bunny are men-about-town who also commit burglaries. Raffles is a famous gentleman cricketer, a marvellous spin bowler who is often invited to social events that would be out of his reach otherwise. &quot;I was asked about for my cricket&quot;, he comments after this period is over. It ends when they are caught and exposed on an ocean voyage while attempting another theft; Raffles dives overboard and is presumed drowned. These stories were collected in &quot;The Amateur Cracksman.&quot; Other stories set in this period, written after Raffles had been &quot;killed off&quot;, were collected in &quot;A Thief in the Night.&quot;

The second phase begins some time later when Bunnyhaving served a prison sentenceis summoned to the house of a rich invalid. This turns out to be Raffles himself, back in England in disguise. Then begins their &quot;professional&quot; period, exiled from Society, in which they are straightforward thieves trying to earn a living while keeping Raffles&#x27;s identity a secret. They finally volunteer for the Boer War, where Bunny is wounded and Raffles dies in battle after exposing an enemy spy. These stories were originally collected in &quot;The Black Mask&quot;, although they were subsequently published in one volume with the phase one stories. The last few stories in &quot;A Thief in the Night&quot; were set during this period as well.

Raffles was never quite the same after his reappearance. The &quot;classic&quot; Raffles elements are all found in the first stories: cricket, high society, West End clubs, Bond Street jewellersand two men in immaculate evening dress pulling off impossible robberies.

== Characters ==

=== A. J. Raffles ===

Raffles is, in many ways, a deliberate inversion of Holmeshe is a &quot;gentleman thief&quot;, living at the Albany, a prestigious address in London, playing cricket for the Gentlemen of England and supporting himself by carrying out ingenious burglaries. He is called the &quot;Amateur Cracksman&quot;, and often, at first, differentiates between himself and the &quot;professors&quot;professional criminals from the lower classes.

=== Bunny Manders ===
Bunny Manders, a struggling journalist, is Watson to Raffles&#x27; Holmes, his partner and chronicler. They met initially at school and then again on the night Bunny intended to commit suicide after writing bad cheques to cover gambling debts. Raffles, also penniless, but thriving, persuaded Bunny to join him instead.

=== Inspector Mackenzie ===

The most notable recurring character in the stories aside from Raffles and Bunny is Inspector Mackenzie, a Scottish detective from Scotland Yard. Mackenzie is an adversary to Raffles and appears in &quot;Gentlemen and Players&quot;, &quot;The Return Match&quot;, &quot;The Gift of the Emperor&quot;, and &quot;Mr. Justice Raffles&quot;. He is first mentioned in &quot;A Costume Piece&quot; and is also referenced by name in &quot;The Chest of Silver&quot;. He is probably the &quot;canny man at Scotland Yard&quot; mentioned in &quot;The Rest Cure&quot;.

Mackenzie was based on Melville Leslie Macnaghten, the Chief Constable of the Criminal Investigation Department at Scotland Yard, according to Richard Lancelyn Green. Owen Dudley Edwards wrote that the character Inspector MacDonald in &quot;The Valley of Fear&quot; seems to have been inspired by Inspector Mackenzie.

Though Mackenzie only directly appears in four of the Raffles stories, he is used as a more major character in several adaptations of Raffles, for example the 1977 television series &quot;Raffles&quot;. There are a few other minor recurring characters in the Raffles stories, such as the rival thief Crawshay, who appears in two early stories and is mentioned in &quot;The Chest of Silver&quot;.

* &quot;Raffles&quot; (1975), a made-for-TV film, with Anthony Valentine portraying Raffles and Christopher Strauli playing his partner Bunny Manders.
* Valentine and Strauli reprised their roles in a television series titled &quot;Raffles&quot;, produced by Yorkshire Television in 1977 and scripted by Philip Mackie. Victor Carin portrayed Inspector Mackenzie. The series was intermittently repeated on ITV3 in 2006, and has been released on DVD.
*A version of Raffles makes an appearance in the Sherlock Holmes TV film &quot;Incident at Victoria Falls&quot; under the name Stanley Bullard and played by Alan Coates.
* &quot;The Gentleman Thief&quot; (2001), starring Nigel Havers.

===Radio and audio===
*Frederic Worlock voiced Raffles in a 1934 CBS radio series, &quot;Raffles, the Amateur Cracksman&quot;. The scripts were adapted by Charles Tazewell.
*A radio adaptation of &quot;The Ides of March&quot; aired on 9 December 1941 on the BBC Forces Programme, with Malcolm Graeme as Raffles and Ronald Simpson as Bunny. It was adapted by John Maitland and produced by John Cheatle.
*Horace Braham voiced Raffles in CBS radio productions between 1942 and 1945.
*Six radio episodes with Frank Allenby as Raffles and Eric Micklewood as Bunny were broadcast on the BBC Light Programme between 3 December 1945 and 14 January 1946. The producer was Leslie Stokes.
*Austin Trevor voiced Raffles with Lewis Stringer as Bunny in a radio adaptation of &quot;Mr. Justice Raffles&quot;, adapted and produced by Val Gielgud. It aired on the BBC Home Service on 8 February 1964. Duncan McIntyre voiced Inspector Mackenzie.
* &quot;Raffles&quot; (1985–1993), a BBC radio series starring Jeremy Clyde as Raffles and Michael Cochrane as Bunny Manders. The series included an adaptation of the play &quot;The Return of A. J. Raffles&quot;.
* &quot;Raffles, the Gentleman Thief&quot; (2004–present), a series on the American radio show &quot;Imagination Theatre&quot; starring John Armstrong as Raffles and Dennis Bateman as Bunny Manders. Raffles and Bunny encounter Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson in an episode of another &quot;Imagination Theatre&quot; radio series, &quot;The Further Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;.
* Audiobooks such as &quot;Raffles, The Amateur Cracksman&quot; read by David Rintoul.
* &quot;Mr. Raffles (Man, It Was Mean)&quot;, a 1974 pop single by Steve Harley &amp; Cockney Rebel, was inspired by the character.
*The Big Finish audio play &quot;The Suffering&quot; by Jacqueline Rayner has the First Doctor comment that he learned his house breaking techniques &quot;from Raffles&quot;. He almost certainly means nothing more than he picked up techniques from reading Hornung&#x27;s stories, but since Sherlock Holmes appears as a real character in the Doctor Who universe, it is possible that A.J. Raffles is real too.

===Theatre===
* The story of A. J. Raffles was first performed on Broadway as &quot;Raffles, The Amateur Cracksman&quot; on 27 October 1903 at the Princess Theatre. The play moved to the Savoy Theatre in February 1904 and closed out in March of that year racking up 168 performances. It starred Kyrle Bellew as Raffles, a young Clara Blandick as Gwendolyn and E. M. Holland as Captain Bedford. The play was co-written by E. W. Hornung and Eugene Presbrey. It premiered in London on 12 May 1906, with Gerald du Maurier as Raffles. André Brulé starred as Raffles in a production that opened on 14 June 1907 at the Théatre Réjane, Paris. The play opened at the Teatro de la Comedia, Madrid, on 11 February 1908. Eille Norwood played Raffles in a touring version of the play in 1909.
*In Langdon McCormick&#x27;s 1905 play, &quot;The Burglar and the Lady&quot;, Raffles went up against Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s famous fictional detective Sherlock Holmes. Former boxer &quot;Gentleman Jim&quot; Corbett played Raffles, who was portrayed as an American to match his casting. McCormick did not secure permission from either Doyle or Hornung to use their characters. A 1914 movie adaptation of the play removed Holmes but kept Raffles, again played by Corbett.
*The play &quot;A Visit from Raffles&quot;, by E. W. Hornung and Charles Sansom, opened on 1 November 1909 at the Empress Theatre, Brixton. It starred H. A. Saintsbury as Raffles.
*Graham Greene wrote a play called &quot;The Return of A. J. Raffles&quot; which differs from the Hornung canon on several points, including reinventing Raffles and Bunny as a homosexual couple. Denholm Mitchell Elliott starred as Raffles in the 1975 premiere at the Aldwych Theatre. Raffles has also been played in other productions by John Neville (1979), Jeremy Child (1979), and Brian Protheroe (1994). The play was adapted for radio in 1993 as part of the BBC radio series with Jeremy Clyde as Raffles.

===Comics===
*In the Doctor Who comic strip &quot;Character Assassin&quot; by Scott Gray (Doctor Who Magazine no.311, 12 December 2001), A. J. Raffles is a member of the villainous Sisyphean Society&#x27;s inner circle in the Land of Fiction. The Master quickly kills him along with the other members of the Society.
*The character was mentioned in the 2007 epistolary graphic novel &quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen: Black Dossier&quot;. Following this he recently appeared as a central character in the first chapter of &quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Volume III: Century&quot;, set in 1910.
*&quot;Raffles, Gentleman Thug&quot; is a strip in &quot;Viz&quot; that features a character who shares his name (plus the name of his assistant, Bunny) with the literary Raffles. He is depicted as an upper-class, late Victorian or early Edwardian version of a &#x27;chav&#x27;.

==Literary pastiches==
*The Raffles character was continued by Barry Perowne with the approval of the Hornung Estate. Published in the story paper &quot;The Thriller&quot; during the 1930s and early 1940s, his series featured Raffles as a fairly typical contemporary pulp adventure hero and plays the role of detective alongside that of thief. When he picked up the series again in the 1950s, and once again during the 1970s, the stories were set closer to the late Victorian-setting of the original stories. Over the course of 50 years, off and on, Perowne produced around 60 short stories, some at novella length, and five novels featuring Raffles. Rare for a pastiche writer, Perowne&#x27;s stories have been compared favourably with the originals.
*Jon L. Breen&#x27;s story &quot;Ruffles versus Ruffles&quot; is based on the conceit that Hornung&#x27;s Raffles and Perowne&#x27;s Raffles are separate people, playing off the differing characterisation used by the two authors.
*The 1977 novel &quot;Raffles&quot;, by David Fletcher, is a fresh re-write of many of Hornung&#x27;s original stories, deriving from the television series of the same year.
*Peter Tremayne wrote the 1991 novel &quot;The Return of Raffles&quot; in which Raffles becomes involved in a plot between rival spies. Although announced as the &quot;first of a new series of Raffles adventure,&quot; it remains a single volume.
*Around the turn of the 21st Century, John Hall wrote eight Raffles pastiches, some of which appeared in the &quot;Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s Mystery Magazine&quot;. Some were adaptions of scripts he wrote earlier for the &quot;Imagination Theatre&quot; radio series. They were collected in the 2007 book &quot;The Ardagh Emeralds&quot;.
*Adam Corres authored the 2008 novel &quot;Raffles and the Match-Fixing Syndicate&quot;, a modern crime thriller in which A. J. Raffles, a master of gamesmanship, explores the corrupt world of international cricket match fixing.

===Raffles and Holmes===
*John Kendrick Bangs authored a 1906 novel, &quot;R. Holmes &amp; Co.&quot;, starring Raffles&#x27; grandson (and Sherlock Holmes&#x27;s son, by Raffles&#x27; daughter Marjorie), Raffles Holmes. The novel&#x27;s second chapter tells the story of Holmes&#x27;s pursuit of Raffles and his growing affection for Raffles&#x27;s daughter. Bangs also wrote &quot;Mrs Raffles&quot;, in which Raffles&#x27;s sidekick Bunny Manders teams up in America with the cracksman&#x27;s hitherto-unchronicled wife.
*Carolyn Wells wrote several short parodies in which Sherlock Holmes leads a group called the International Society of Infallible Detectives. Raffles is depicted as a member of the society, along with other characters such as C. Auguste Dupin and Arsène Lupin. Raffles appears in four of the stories, which were published in magazines: &quot;The Adventure of the &#x27;Mona Lisa&#x27;&quot; (1912), &quot;Sure Way to Catch Every Criminal. Ha! Ha!&quot; (1912), &quot;The Adventure of the Lost Baby&quot; (1913), and &quot;The Adventure of the Clothes-line&quot; (1915).
*Several of Barry Perowne&#x27;s Raffles short stories feature or reference Sherlock Holmes, including: &quot;The Victory Match&quot;; &quot;The Baskerville Match&quot; and &quot;Raffles and an American Night&#x27;s Entertainment&quot;.
*In 1932, Hugh Kingsmill&#x27;s &quot;The Ruby of Khitmandu&quot;, in which Raffles and Bunny were pitted against Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, was published in the April issue of &quot;The Bookman&quot;. A portion of the story was republished in the collection &quot;The Misadventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot; (1944, edited by Ellery Queen).
*Philip José Farmer put Raffles and Manders into a science-fictional situation in his story, &quot;The Problem of the Sore BridgeAmong Others&quot;, in which he and Bunny solve three mysteries unsolved by Sherlock Holmes and save humanity from alien invasion.
*In one of Robert L. Fish&#x27;s Schlock Homes stories, &quot;The Adventure of the Odd Lotteries&quot; (1980), Homes and Watney encounter a cracksman and hypochondriac known as &quot;A.J. Lotteries.&quot;
*Raffles and Bunny feature in &quot;Moriarty: The Hound of the D&#x27;Ubervilles&quot; (2011), by Kim Newman, in a chapter depicting the gathering of the world&#x27;s greatest criminals.
*In 2011 and 2012 Richard Foreman published a series of six Raffles stories, collected in a single volume, &quot;Raffles: The Complete Innings&quot;. These stories, contemporaneous with &quot;The Amateur Cracksman&quot;, begin with &quot;The Gentleman Thief,&quot; in which Raffles and Bunny are hired by Sherlock Holmes to steal a stolen letter. Later stories in the sextet see Raffles and Bunny encounter H. G. Wells and Irene Adler. Foreman&#x27;s Raffles is also more moralistic than the original: the gentleman thief often donates part of his ill-gotten gains to various charitable causes.

=== Cameo appearances ===
*Raffles makes a cameo appearance in Kim Newman&#x27;s &quot;Anno Dracula&quot; (1992). Although never mentioned by name, the character is described as an amateur cracksman (a reference to the title of the first short story collection), and mutters the epigram, &quot;You play what&#x27;s chucked at you, I always say.&quot;
*Raffles and Bunny make a minor appearance in &quot;Lost in a Good Book&quot;, a 2004 novel written by Jasper Fforde. They are pulled out of the literary world into the real world to help crack a safe containing the stolen manuscript of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Cardenio&quot;.

<doc id="768523" wikidata="Q490098" url="?curid=768523" title="Dartos fascia">
<text>The dartos fascia, dartos tunic or simply dartos is a layer of connective tissue found in the penile shaft, foreskin and scrotum. The penile portion is referred to as the superficial fascia of penis or the subcutaneous tissue of penis, while the scrotal part is the dartos proper. In addition to being continuous with itself between the scrotum and the penis, it is also continuous with Colles&#x27; fascia of the perineum and Scarpa&#x27;s fascia of the abdomen. 

The dartos lies just below the skin, which places it just superficial to the external spermatic fascia in the scrotum and to Buck&#x27;s fascia in the penile shaft. In the scrotum, it consists mostly of smooth muscle. The tone of this smooth muscle is responsible for the wrinkled (rugose) appearance of the scrotum. In females, the same muscle fibers are less well developed and termed &quot;dartos muliebris&quot;, lying beneath the skin of the labia majora. The dartos fascia receives innervation from postganglionic sympathetic nerve fibers arriving via the ilioinguinal nerve and the posterior scrotal nerve.

==Function==

In the penis, the loose attachment of the dartos fascia to Buck&#x27;s fascia is responsible for the high degree of mobility of the penile skin over the underlying tissue. It is also responsible for carrying the blood supply of the penile skin, a longitudinally-coursing anastomotic network of vessels that arise from the external pudendal vessels.

In the scrotum, the dartos fascia acts to regulate the temperature of the testicles, which promotes spermatogenesis. It does this by expanding or contracting to wrinkle the scrotal skin.

* Contraction reduces the surface area available for heat loss, thus reducing heat loss and warming the testicles.
* Conversely, expansion increases the surface area, promoting heat loss and thus cooling the testicles.

The dartos muscle works in conjunction with the cremaster muscle to elevate the testis but should not be confused with the cremasteric reflex.

The dartos fascia keeps the foreskin close to the glans penis throughout life. In infancy, the dartos fascia operates as a one-way check valve at the tip of the foreskin, allowing urine to pass out, but prohibiting the entry of foreign matter and pathogens.

There is an increase in elastic fibers with increasing maturity that allows the foreskin to become retractable by adulthood and glide freely back and forth.

==Related terms==

Etymology:

: Derived from the Greek δέρνω/derno (beat, flog) and/or δέρμα/derma (skin), meaning &quot;that which is skinned or flayed&quot;, possibly due to its appearance.

Some dartos-related terms:

: dartoic &quot;(dar·to·ic)&quot; (dahr-to&#x27;ik) of the nature of a dartos; having a slow, involuntary contractility like that of the dartos.

: dartoid &quot;(dar·toid)&quot; (dahr&#x27;toid) resembling the dartos.

<doc id="768526" wikidata="Q3793484" url="?curid=768526" title="The Baby-Sitters Club (film)">
<text>The Baby-Sitters Club is a 1995 American comedy-drama film directed by Melanie Mayron, in her feature film directorial debut. It is based on Ann M. Martin&#x27;s novel series of the same name and is about one summer in the girls&#x27; lives in the fictional town of Stoneybrook, Connecticut. The film was shot in the California cities of Los Angeles, Altadena, and Santa Clarita.

The film was released on August 18, 1995. The film received mostly mixed to positive reviews, and grossed $9.6 million against a budget of $6.5 million.

==Plot==
At the first meeting of the summer, Kristy Thomas, the president and founder of a babysitting club called &quot;The Babysitter&#x27;s Club&quot;, has the great idea of holding a day camp for their babysitting charges for the entire summer. She and her co-founders (Claudia Kishi, Mary Anne Spier, Stacey McGill, Dawn Schafer, Mallory Pike, and Jessi Ramsey) vow to keep an eye on the children. Mary Anne and Dawn, who are stepsisters, offer their parents&#x27; backyard to serve as the campsite, as long as the kids do not come inside the house and the barn (leading the club to rent a porta potty for the summer). The summer camp annoys Mary Anne and Dawn&#x27;s neighbor, Mrs. Haberman, who becomes increasingly upset because of the camp activities that are taking place next door, and keeps threatening to have the camp shut down.

Kristy&#x27;s father Patrick also comes back into town to see her but cautions her to not tell anyone he is there. This leads to a summer of lies and secrets (only Mary Anne knows he is in town), while Kristy and her father re-build their bond over baseball and mouse-shaped pancakes. Kristy&#x27;s 13th birthday comes, and her father promises to take Kristy to the local amusement park Fun Land for her birthday but never shows. Then a thunderstorm comes and Fun Land closes. Kristy tries to walk home in the rain, but is picked up by the members of the club when Mary Anne tells the other girls about what has been happening with Patrick. Kristy then finally celebrates her 13th birthday with her friends over a melted ice cream cake that the club members had made for her.

Claudia is forced to attend summer school because she failed science. Her parents have told her that she needs to bring up her grades and pass summer school or else they will force her to quit the Babysitters Club and repeat the 8th grade. Claudia is worried about not passing final exam until the kids, club members, and Alan Gray perform a rap song based on the material at the day camp, helping Claudia pass the test.

Mary Anne has a boyfriend named Logan Bruno, who is also a club member. But classmate Cokie Mason likes him too and wants to steal him from Mary Anne. Their rivalry lasts all summer and only ends when Jackie Rodowsky hits his first home run into Cokie, who is sitting in a tree nearby.

Stacey has a crush on a 17-year-old boy named Luca from Switzerland, who is Rosie Wilder&#x27;s cousin. As their relationship progresses, she faces problems telling him about her diabetes, and later, her age. This is revealed after a trip to a New York City club with Claudia, in which a bouncer does not allow her into a club because she is underage. Luca is outraged, unable to believe that Stacey is 13 years old. Luca and Stacey break up briefly until Stacey calls on Luca to help them rescue Kristy during her rainy walk home from Fun Land. As Stacey is saying goodbye to Luca, he tells her that he will be coming to Stoneybrook again next year. Delighted, Stacey tells him that she will be 14 years old when he returns. They share a kiss just before Luca departs.

Alan Gray has a crush on Dawn Schafer, and tries to impress her by going to the day camp. When he helps the kids perform the rap song for Claudia, Dawn finally realizes that she likes Alan after all.

Mallory and Jessi have problems with the day camp thanks to the kids, who always misbehave and drive them crazy.

The club is also on the hunt for a new headquarters, believing they are close to outgrowing the space at Claudia&#x27;s house. They find an old greenhouse and spend the summer with the kids cleaning and fixing it up. After the renovations and cleanup are complete, the members realize that Claudia&#x27;s room is already perfect as club headquarters and they decide to give the greenhouse to Mrs. Haberman as a way of thanking her for putting up with the day camp. Mrs. Haberman takes a photo of the BSC and the children, and they are remembered forever.

==Cast==
==Reception==

===Box office===
&quot;The Baby-Sitters Club&quot; was one of two nationwide theatrical releases on the weekend of August 18, 1995. It suffered a disappointing debut, opening in ninth place with $3 million, which placed it behind &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;. The total domestic gross was $9.6 million.

===Critical response===
 Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade &quot;B+&quot; on scale of A to F.

Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; gave the film 4.5 out of 5 calling it &quot;A beautiful film that possesses the power to enchant all ages.&quot; Hal Hinson of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called the film &quot;A colorful, buoyant, loving tribute to the notion of girlfriends forever.&quot; Edward Guthmann of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; gave the film 2 out of 4 and was critical of the film saying &quot;85 minutes doesn&#x27;t provide an adequate format for developing seven distinct characters.&quot;

==Soundtrack==

&quot;The Baby-Sitters Club: Music from the Motion Picture&quot; is a soundtrack that was released on August 8, 1995. The trailer memorably included such hit 90s songs as &quot;Cornflake Girl&quot; by Tori Amos, &quot;Good&quot; by Better Than Ezra, and &quot;Dreams&quot; by The Cranberries, none of which are included on the soundtrack.

<doc id="768527" wikidata="Q422269" url="?curid=768527" title="Ghrelin">
<text>Ghrelin (; or lenomorelin, INN) is a hormone primarily produced by enteroendocrine cells of the gastrointestinal tract, especially the stomach, and is often called a &quot;hunger hormone&quot; because it increases the drive to eat. Blood levels of ghrelin are highest before meals when hungry, returning to lower levels after mealtimes. Ghrelin may help prepare for food intake by increasing gastric motility and stimulating the secretion of gastric acid.

Ghrelin activates cells in the anterior pituitary gland and hypothalamic arcuate nucleus, including neuropeptide Y neurons that initiate appetite. Ghrelin stimulates brain structures having a specific receptor – the growth hormone secretagogue receptor 1A (GHSR-1A). Ghrelin also participates in regulation of reward cognition, learning and memory, the sleep-wake cycle, taste sensation, reward behavior, and glucose metabolism.

==History and name==
Ghrelin was discovered after the ghrelin receptor (called growth hormone secretagogue type 1A receptor or GHS-R) was determined in 1999. The hormone name is based on its role as a &quot;growth hormone-releasing peptide&quot;, with reference to the Proto-Indo-European root &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;to grow&quot;.

==Gene, transcription products, and structure==

The &quot;GHRL&quot; gene produces mRNA which has four exons. Five products arise: the first is the 117-amino acid &quot;preproghrelin&quot;. It is homologous to promotilin; both are members of the motilin family. It is cleaved to produce &quot;proghrelin&quot; which is cleaved to produce an unacylated 28-amino acid &quot;ghrelin&quot; and an acylated &quot;C-ghrelin&quot;. &quot;Obestatin&quot; is presumed to be cleaved from C-ghrelin.

Ghrelin only becomes active when caprylic (octanoic) acid is linked posttranslationally to serine at the 3-position by the enzyme ghrelin O-acyltransferase (GOAT) to form a proteolipid. It is located on the cell membrane of ghrelin cells in the stomach and pancreas. The non-octanoylated form is desacyl ghrelin. It does not activate the GHS-R receptor but does have other effects: cardiac, anti-ghrelin, appetite stimulation, and inhibition of hepatic glucose output. Side-chains other than octanoyl have also been observed: these can also trigger the ghrelin receptor. In particular, decanoyl ghrelin has been found to constitute a significant portion of circulating ghrelin in mice, but as of 2011 its presence in humans has not been established.

==Ghrelin cells==

===Alternative names===
The ghrelin cell is also known as an A-like cell (pancreas), X-cell (for unknown function), X/A-like cell (rats), Epsilon cell (pancreas), P/D sub 1 cell (humans) and Gr cell (abbreviation for ghrelin cell).

===Location===
Ghrelin cells are found mainly in the stomach and duodenum, but also in the jejunum, lungs, pancreatic islets, gonads, adrenal cortex, placenta, and kidney. It has also been shown that ghrelin is produced locally in the brain. Additionally, research suggests that ghrelin may be produced in the myocardium and have an &#x27;autocrine/ paracrine&#x27; like effect within the heart.

Ghrelin cells are also found in oxyntic glands (20% of cells), pyloric glands, and small intestine.

===Features===
They are ovoid cells with granules. They have gastrin receptors. Some produce nesfatin-1. Ghrelin cells are not terminally differentiated in the pancreas: they are progenitor cells that can give rise to A-cells, PP cells and Beta-cells there.

==Function and mechanism of action==
Ghrelin is a participant in regulating the complex process of energy homeostasis which adjusts both &quot;energy input&quot; – by adjusting hunger signals – and &quot;energy output&quot; – by adjusting the proportion of energy going to ATP production, fat storage, glycogen storage, and short-term heat loss. The net result of these processes is reflected in body weight, and is under continuous monitoring and adjustment based on metabolic signals and needs. At any given moment in time, it may be in equilibrium or disequilibrium. Gastric-brain communication is an essential part of energy homeostasis, and several communication pathways are probable, including the gastric intracellular mTOR/S6K1 pathway mediating the interaction among ghrelin, nesfatin and endocannabinoid gastric systems, and both afferent and efferent vagal signals.

Ghrelin and synthetic ghrelin mimetics (growth hormone secretagogues) increase body weight and fat mass by triggering receptors in the arcuate nucleus that include neuropeptide Y (NPY) and agouti-related protein (AgRP) neurons. Ghrelin-responsiveness of these neurons is both leptin- and insulin-sensitive. Ghrelin reduces the sensitivity of gastric vagal afferents, so they are less sensitive to gastric distension.

In addition to its function in energy homeostasis, ghrelin also activates the cholinergic–dopaminergic reward link in inputs to the ventral tegmental area and in the mesolimbic pathway, a circuit that communicates the hedonic and reinforcing aspects of natural rewards, such as food and addictive drugs such as ethanol. Ghrelin receptors are located on neurons in this circuit. Hypothalamic ghrelin signalling is required for reward from alcohol and palatable/rewarding foods.

Ghrelin has been linked to inducing appetite and feeding behaviors. Circulating ghrelin levels are the highest right before a meal and the lowest right after. Injections of ghrelin in both humans and rats have been shown to increase food intake in a dose-dependent manner. So the more ghrelin that is injected the more food that is consumed. However, ghrelin does not increase meal size, only meal number. Ghrelin injections also increase an animal&#x27;s motivation to seek out food, behaviors including increased sniffing, foraging for food, and hoarding food. Body weight is regulated through energy balance, the amount of energy taken in versus the amount of energy expended over an extended period of time. Studies have shown that ghrelin levels are positively correlated with weight. This data suggests that ghrelin functions as an adiposity signal, a messenger between the body&#x27;s energy stores and the brain.

==Blood levels==
Blood levels are in the pmol/L or fmol/mL range. Both active and total ghrelin can be measured. Circulating ghrelin concentrations rise before eating and fall afterward, more strongly in response to protein and carbohydrate than to lipids. The plasma ghrelin-like immunoreactivity concentration measured with a particular radioimmunoassay in a typical human is 166.0 + 10.1 fmol/mL. Serum ghrelin concentrations tend to increase in age and vary throughout the day, with values peaking while one is asleep.

==Ghrelin receptor==
The ghrelin receptor &quot;GHS-R1a&quot; (a splice-variant of the growth hormone secretagogue receptor, with the &quot;GHS-R1b&quot; splice being inactive) is involved in mediating a wide variety of biological effects of ghrelin, including: stimulation of growth hormone release, increase in hunger, modulation of glucose and lipid metabolism, regulation of gastrointestinal motility and secretion, protection of neuronal and cardiovascular cells, and regulation of immune function. They are present in high density in the hypothalamus and pituitary, on the vagus nerve (on both afferent cell bodies and efferent nerve endings) and throughout the gastrointestinal tract.

==Locations of action==

===Glucose metabolism===
The entire ghrelin system (dAG, AG, GHS-R and GOAT) has a gluco-regulatory action.

===Sleep===
Preliminary research indicates that ghrelin participates in the regulation of circadian rhythms. A review reported finding strong evidence that sleep restriction affected ghrelin or leptin levels, or energy expenditure.

===Reproductive system===
Ghrelin has inhibitory effects on gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) secretion. It may cause decreased fertility.

===Fetus and neonate===
Ghrelin is produced early by the fetal lung and promotes lung growth. Umbilical cord blood levels of ghrelin show a correlation between ghrelin levels and birth weight.

=== Cardiovascular system ===
Ghrelin functions as a cardio-protective peptide by being an anti-inflammatory agent, promoting angiogenesis, inhibiting arrhythmia, and improving heart failure.

=== Immune system ===
Ghrelin has a diverse immunoregulatory role mediating the release of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4 and 10 along with TGF-β while reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, INF-γ, and IL-1β from various immunologically competent cells &quot;in vitro&quot; and &quot;in vivo.&quot; Additionally, Ghrelin and its endogenous receptor, GHSR1a, along with GOAT are expressed in primary immune tissues such as the spleen and thymus where it has a role in modulating interactions between metabolic state and inflammation, mediating energy balance homeostasis.

=== Stress/ Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis ===
GHSR1A, Ghrelin&#x27;s endogenous receptor, is expressed within the hypothalamus including the arcuate nucleus, but not in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) where ghrelin has been found to indirectly affect HPA axis function via neighboring corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) neurons. Studies regarding how ghrelin affects cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) secretion along with how cortisol and ACTH levels affect ghrelin are inconsistent as different psychological and physical stressors within &quot;in vivo&quot; studies have produced a myriad of results as the underlying mechanisms are still not understood well.

== Role(s) in disease ==

===Gastric bypass surgery===
Gastric bypass surgery not only reduces gut capacity for food, but also lowers ghrelin levels compared to both lean people and those who lost weight through dieting. Studies have not clarified whether ghrelin levels return to normal in people who had gastric bypass surgery after weight loss has stabilized. Gastric bypass surgery involving vertical-sleeve gastrectomy reduces plasma ghrelin levels by about 60% in the long term.

===Anorexia and obesity===
Ghrelin levels in the plasma of obese individuals are lower than those in leaner individuals, suggesting that ghrelin does not contribute to obesity, except in the cases of Prader–Willi syndrome-induced obesity, where high ghrelin levels are correlated with increased food intake. Those with anorexia nervosa have high plasma levels of ghrelin compared to both the constitutionally thin and normal-weight controls. The level of ghrelin increases during the time of day from midnight to dawn in thinner people, which suggests there is a flaw in the circadian rhythm of obese individuals. Ghrelin levels are high in people with cancer-induced cachexia. There is insufficient evidence to conclude either for or against use of ghrelin in managing cachexia associated with cancer.

=== Effects on cardiovascular system ===
Ghrelin has been theorized to have protective effects on the cardiovascular system. Studies have shown that in mice models of myocardial infarction (MI) with knock-outs of ghrelin, subjects with no endogenous ghrelin production had a significantly increased mortality rate along with worse metrics in terms of cardiac sympathetic activity and systolic function when compared to wild-type subjects. with exogenous ghrelin being shown to improve heart function in rodent models of chronic heart failure and improved ventricular remodeling in post-MI rats.

<text>Restoration is a set of BBC television series where viewers decide on which listed building that was in immediate need of remedial works was to win a grant from Heritage Lottery Fund. It first aired in 2003.

The host of all three series is Griff Rhys Jones, whilst investigating each building in the heats are the show&#x27;s resident &quot;ruin detectives&quot;, Marianne Suhr and Ptolemy Dean.

==First series==
Thirty buildings featured in ten regional heats in 2003, with money raised from the telephone vote being added to the prize fund. Viewers chose which of a selection of the United Kingdom&#x27;s most important, but neglected, buildings should be awarded a Heritage Lottery Grant of £3m. The winning building was the Victoria Baths in Manchester; however, bureaucratic and technical hurdles meant that the money raised could not be spent immediately, and final planning-approval to begin a restoration process did not go through until September 2005. The first phase of restoration work finally began on 19 March 2007.

Kate Humble co-hosted the 2003 live grand final.

==Second series==
A second series, featuring 21 buildings in 7 regional heats, appeared on BBC Two in the summer of 2004. The winner was the Old Grammar School and Saracen&#x27;s Head in Kings Norton, Birmingham. Both buildings closed to the public in July 2006 for archeological investigation, restoration work began in February 2007. Both buildings were officially reopened on 13 June 2008.

The 2004 live Grand Final was co-hosted by Natasha Kaplinsky.

===Spin offs===
*Shown in tandem with the series
**&quot;Restored to Glory&quot;, BBC Four
**&quot;Restoration Nation&quot;, BBC Four
**&quot;Restoration: You Make It Happen&quot;, Community Channel

===Updates===
On 4 September 2005, Rhys Jones presented a programme, updating viewers as to the progress made by the featured buildings, or otherwise.

==Third series==
A third series of nine programmes, presented by Griff Rhys Jones, began on BBC Two in August 2006. Entitled Restoration Village, the series focused on buildings in smaller settlements, using the same format and voting as before, featuring 21 buildings in 7 regional heats. Updates about previously featured buildings were also included. The winner of Restoration Village was Chedham&#x27;s Yard, an early 19th-century blacksmith&#x27;s yard.

===Updates===
On 22 April 2009, Rhys Jones presented &quot;Restoration Revisited&quot;, a 60-minute programme updating viewers as to the progress made by some of the 72 featured buildings throughout the three TV series.

==The Perfect Village==

The Perfect Village was a companion series of architectural travelogues presented by Ptolemy Dean, and shown on BBC Four in 2006. The show chose twelve villages from all around the United Kingdom as illustrations of village life. In the final show Heighington in County Durham was chosen as the UK&#x27;s &quot;perfect village&quot;.

* Show 1. &quot;Introduction&quot;
* Show 2. Dedham and Alderley Edge (Essex and the North West)
* Show 3. Bourton-on-the-Water and Ardglass (The West and Northern Ireland)
* Show 4. Rogart and Tonyrefail (Scotland and South Wales)
* Show 5. Heighington and Milton Abbas (the North and the South West)
* Show 6. Polperro and Wye (the South West and the South East)
* Show 7. Silver End and Poundbury (the East and the South West)
* Show 8. &quot;What makes the perfect village?&quot;

==Responses==
The Channel 4 programme, &quot;Demolition&quot;, broadcast in December 2005, was an &quot;answer&quot; to &quot;Restoration&quot;; instead of voting for a building to be saved, viewers were asked to vote on which eyesore should be demolished.

== Music ==
* The main theme music was composed by Nick Franglen, who forms one half of ambient music duo Lemon Jelly. The Lemon Jelly track &quot;In The Bath&quot; was used as background music within the programmes.

<text>Georg Otto Hermann Balck (7 December 1893 – 29 November 1982) was a highly decorated officer of the German Army who served in both World War I and World War II, rising to the rank of General der Panzertruppe.

==Early career==

Balck was born in Danzig - Langfuhr, present-day Wrzeszcz in Poland. He was the son of William Balck and his wife Mathilde, née Jensen. His family had a long military tradition, and his father was a senior officer in the Imperial German Army.

On 10 April 1913 Balck entered the Hanoverian Rifle Battalion 10 in Goslar as a cadet. From 12 February 1914 he attended the Hanoverian Military College, where he remained until called up with the outbreak of the First World War in August.

Balck served as a mountain infantry officer, and his unit played a key role in the Schlieffen Plan, leading the crossing at Sedan. He fought on the western, eastern, Italian and Balkan fronts. He served three years as a company commander, ending the war in command of a machine-gun company. At one point he led an extended patrol that operated independently behind Russian lines for several weeks. Over the course of the war he was wounded seven times and awarded the Iron Cross First Class. Balck was nominated for Prussia&#x27;s highest honor, the Pour le Mérite, in October 1918, but the war ended before his citation completed processing.

During the interwar period Balck was selected as one of the 4,000 officers to continue on in the military serving in the &quot;Reichswehr&quot;. He transferred to the 18th Cavalry Regiment in 1922, and remained with that unit for 12 years. Balck twice turned down a post in the German General Staff, the normal path for advancing to high rank in the German army, preferring instead to remain a line officer.

==World War II==
At the outbreak of World War II in 1939, Balck was serving in the &quot;Oberkommando des Heeres&quot; (OKH) as a staff officer in the Inspectorate of Motorized Troops, which was in charge of refitting and reorganizing the growing panzer forces. In October he was placed in command of one of the mechanised regiments of the 1st Panzer Division, with which he served during the Battle of France. The 1st Panzer Division made up a part of Guderian&#x27;s panzer corps. Balck&#x27;s regiment spearheaded a crossing over the Meuse, and established a bridgehead on the far side.

During the winter of 1940 through the spring of 1941 he commanded a panzer regiment, and led this unit during the Battle of Greece. He later commanded a panzer brigade in the same division. He returned to staff duties with the OKH in the Inspectorate of Armoured Forces in July 1941. In May 1942, Balck went to the Eastern Front in command of the 11th Panzer Division in Ukraine and southern Russia. Following the encirclement of the 6th Army at Stalingrad in the Soviet Operation Uranus, the German southern front faced a generalized collapse. Balck&#x27;s division took part in the efforts to stop the Soviet advance. In battles along the Chir River his division destroyed an entire Soviet Tank Corps and much of the Soviet 5th Tank Army. For this and other achievements Balck was made one of only twenty-seven officers in the entire war who received the Knight&#x27;s Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords, and Diamonds.

Balck was then given command of the Heer&#x27;s elite unit, Großdeutschland Division which he led at Zhitomir in 1943. After a brief posting to Italy in which he commanded the XIV Panzer Corps, he returned to command the XLVIII Panzer Corps on the Eastern Front in December 1943, as well as the operations against the Soviet winter/spring offensive in western Ukraine in 1944. In July 1944 Balck commanded the Corps during the initial phase of the Soviet Lvov-Sandomierz Offensive. He was closely involved in the failed relief attempt of the encircled XIII Army Corps in the Brody pocket, where it was destroyed. In August 1944 he assumed command of the 4th Panzer Army.

In September 1944 Balck was transferred from 4th Panzer Army in Poland to the Western Front to command Army Group G in relief of General Johannes Blaskowitz in the Alsace region of France. Balck was unable to stop the Allied advance under General George S. Patton, and in late December he was relieved of command of Army Group G and placed in the officer reserve pool. By the intervention of General Heinz Guderian he was transferred to command the reconstituted 6th Army in Hungary, which also had operational control of two Hungarian armies. Balck&#x27;s unit surrendered to the U.S. XX Corps in Austria on 8 May 1945.

==Postwar life==
Balck was a POW and remained in captivity until 1947. He declined to participate in the US Army Historical Division&#x27;s study on the war. After the war Balck found employment as a depot worker. In 1948 he was arrested for murder for the execution of artillery commander Lieutenant-Colonel Johann Schottke. The incident in question occurred while Balck served as commander of Army Group G on the western front. On 28 November 1944 near Saarbrücken, Schottke&#x27;s unit had failed to provide its supportive artillery fire upon its target area. When searched, he was found drunk on duty. Balck held a summary judgment, and Schottke was executed by firing squad. The sentence and execution were conducted without the ordained military tribunal. Balck was found guilty of manslaughter and sentenced to three years in prison. He served 18 months of his sentence.

Hermann Balck was sentenced by a French military court in Colmar to 20 years of hard labour for his role in the scorched earth Operation Waldfest but never extradited.

In the late 1970s and early 1980s Balck and Friedrich von Mellenthin participated in seminars and panel discussions with senior NATO leaders at the US Army War College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania.

==Career assessment==
According to the historian David T. Zabecki, Balck was considered a gifted commander of armored troops, exemplified by his handling of 11th Panzer Division and XLVIII Panzer Corps during 1942–43. In reviewing Balck&#x27;s command of the division during the Chir River crisis of December 1942, U.S. General William DePuy estimated Balck to have been &quot;perhaps the best division commander in the German Army.&quot; Some battles Balck directed are described in &quot;Panzer Battles&quot;, the memoir of the former general Friedrich von Mellenthin, whom he met when Balck&#x27;s 11th Panzer Division came under the command of the XLVIII Panzer Corps. At the time Mellenthin was serving as Chief of Staff of the XLVIII Panzer Corps.

Balck started the war as an &quot;Oberstleutnant&quot; (lieutenant-colonel) in 1939 and ended it as a &quot;General der Panzertruppe&quot; (general of armored troops). Balck was one of only twenty-seven officers in the Wehrmacht to receive the Knight&#x27;s Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords, and Diamonds. His career was detailed in contrast to that of Alfred Jodl in &quot;Weapons and Hope&quot; by Freeman Dyson. Balck&#x27;s own autobiography is entitled &quot;Ordnung im Chaos: Erinnerungen, 1893-1948&quot;.

<doc id="768552" wikidata="Q1153032" url="?curid=768552" title="Roc-A-Fella Records">
<text>Roc-A-Fella Records was an American hip hop record label and music management company founded by record executives and entrepreneurs Shawn &quot;Jay-Z&quot; Carter, Damon Dash, and Kareem &quot;Biggs&quot; Burke in 1994. Carter issued his debut album, &quot;Reasonable Doubt&quot; (1996), as the label&#x27;s first release, in a joint venture with Priority Records. The label signed and released albums for acts including Kanye West, Cam&#x27;ron, Beanie Sigel, Memphis Bleek, Juelz Santana, Freeway, Jadakiss, Teairra Marí, State Property, and The Diplomats before its dissolution in 2013.

== History ==

=== 1994–2000: Formation and early years ===
Roc-A-Fella Records was founded in 1994. After Shawn &quot;Jay-Z&quot; Carter had been rejected by major record labels, it began as an independent outlet for the rapper&#x27;s debut album. Carter, Damon Dash and Kareem Burke started the label through Priority Records, using finances from Payday Records due to their singles-only deal. The name &quot;Roc-A-Fella&quot; was conceived by rapper Tone Hooker as a double entendre for Rockefeller and a rapper dominating his opponent (&quot;rocking a fella&quot;). Though &quot;Reasonable Doubt&quot; (1996) didn&#x27;t earn immediate commercial success, it spawned successful singles and earned Jay-Z regional popularity in hip hop. Starting out as Roc-A-Fella&#x27;s only artist, Jay-Z was supported by the Notorious B.I.G.&#x27;s producer DJ Clark Kent and Camp Lo&#x27;s producer DJ Ski; affiliated rappers, Sauce Money, Jaz-O, and a young Memphis Bleek, though only Memphis Bleek would eventually sign with the label.

In June 1997, Roc-A-Fella agreed to a 50/50 partnership and distribution deal with Def Jam Recordings. In November 1997, Roc-A-Fella released their first two albums under Def Jam&#x27;s distribution, Jay-Z&#x27;s sophomore album, &quot;In My Lifetime, Vol. 1&quot;, as well as R&amp;B duo Christión&#x27;s debut and only album for the label, &quot;Ghetto Cyrano&quot;, on the same day. Roc-A-Fella and Jay-Z saw increasing popularity, mainly due to a high-profile appearance by Jay on The Notorious B.I.G.&#x27;s posthumous &quot;Life After Death&quot;, complete with Roc-A-Fella and Damon Dash references. While Memphis Bleek signed with Roc-A-Fella, Sauce Money chose to pursue a deal with Priority, and Jaz-O refrained from signing anywhere and provided production for only one song on &quot;In My Lifetime, Vol. 1&quot;, &quot;Rap Game/Crack Game.&quot; Despite Jaz-O not signing to Roc-A-Fella, he became Memphis Bleek&#x27;s manager. In 1998, Roc-A-Fella Records released the movie &quot;Streets Is Watching&quot; and the accompanying soundtrack; the film compiles various Jay-Z videos into a continuous story, and the album introduced more affiliated, future Roc-A-Fella Records acts like Noreaga, M.O.P., and DJ Clue, as well as producer Irv Gotti and the short-lived group, Murder Inc. (namesake of Irv&#x27;s record label, Murder Inc.).

Jay&#x27;s 1998 album, &quot;Vol. 2... Hard Knock Life&quot;, saw him largely depart from his previous entourage and venture forth with producers Swizz Beatz, Timbaland, The 45 King and Jermaine Dupri. &quot;Vol. 2&quot; spawned his first major hit, &quot;Hard Knock Life&quot;, and became the label&#x27;s first Platinum-RIAA certified release; it was the last Roc-A-Fella release to see appearances by Jaz-O or Sauce Money, and the first to feature new Roc artists Beanie Sigel and Amil. The label closed out 1998 with the December release of DJ Clue&#x27;s debut album, &quot;The Professional&quot;, which saw guest appearances from Jay-Z, Memphis Bleek, and an appearance from future Roc-A-Fella artist Cam&#x27;ron. The album was certified platinum by the RIAA, making DJ Clue the first other than Jay-Z to achieve platinum status. Meanwhile, DJ Ski had, at the time, formed the production company Roc-A-Blok, although the company folded when Ski moved out of New York to take a break from music.

In August 1999, Memphis Bleek&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Coming of Age&quot;, was released through Roc-A-Fella. The album was executive produced by Kareem &quot; Biggs&quot; Burke, Damon Dash, and Jay-Z. It featured guest appearances from Roc-A-Fella artists Beanie Sigel and Jay-Z as well as Dark Half and Da Ranjahz, artists signed to Roc-A-Fella&#x27;s subsidiary label The Carter Foundation. Despite their appearances, they soon parted ways with The Carter Foundation. Though not as successful as Jay-Z&#x27;s albums, &quot;Coming Of Age&quot; achieved Gold status in America thanks to the single &quot;What You Think Of That&quot; (featuring Jay-Z). Jay-Z&#x27;s 1999 album &quot;Vol. 3... Life and Times of S. Carter&quot; continued Jay&#x27;s new affiliations with then-popular producers; in 2000, the label saw a redefinition in both sound and roster. Jay-Z put out &quot;The Dynasty: Roc La Familia&quot; as a solo album. Originally intended to be a collaboration project, it nonetheless featured heavy appearances by Beanie Sigel, Amil, and Memphis Bleek, along with a Philly rapper Freeway guest spot that led to him being signed to Roc-A-Fella. Rather than return to Timbaland or Swizz Beatz for production, Jay selected beats from a new crop of producers: Kanye West, Bink, The Neptunes and Just Blaze. Each beat-smith would go on to become consistently involved in future Roc-A-Fella projects.

=== 2000–2005: Prominence and split ===
The new decade saw Roc-A-Fella begin to expand beyond one figurehead artist. Although Jay-Z remained the label&#x27;s prominent image—with the acclaimed release of &quot;The Blueprint&quot; and the closing of his trial for the 1999 stabbing of producer Lance Rivera—other Roc artists began to gain popularity and acceptance. In 2000, Beanie Sigel released &quot;The Truth&quot; and reached #5 on the Billboard charts, DJ Clue released &quot;The Professional 2&quot;, and Memphis Bleek released &quot;The Understanding&quot;. Although Clue and Beans&#x27;s albums hit the top five on the Billboard charts, Bleek&#x27;s album was in the top twenty. Nonetheless, all three albums were certified Gold by the RIAA. Amil&#x27;s album, however, had lackluster sales. Jay-Z and Damon Dash began signing up new talent, including Freeway, and several young Philadelphia rappers that were later compiled into the Freeway/Sigel-led group, State Property. During this time, Jay-Z and Beanie Sigel were embroiled in a feud with Ruff Ryders artists Jadakiss and DMX. Disses back and forth between Jay-Z and Jadakiss implied a conflict between Jay and former groupmate DMX, led to a full-on war of words between Sigel and Kiss, and eventually culminated in a diss by Beanie Sigel over Jada&#x27;s hit &quot;Put Your Hands Up,&quot; after which the rivalry faded. On December 4, 2001 (Jay-Z&#x27;s 32nd birthday), it was announced and confirmed that rapper Cam&#x27;ron had signed to Roc-A-Fella through his connection with Damon Dash. After Cam&#x27;ron was signed, his rap group The Diplomats as well as Diplomats members Juelz Santana and Jimmy Jones also signed to Roc-A-Fella as well.

Upon signing to Roc-A-Fella, Cam&#x27;ron reached a new commercial peak. On May 14, 2002, Roc-A-Fella released Cam&#x27;ron&#x27;s Roc-A-Fella debut &quot;Come Home With Me&quot;. The album featured guest appearances from Roc-A-Fella artists Jimmy Jones, Juelz Santana, Beanie Sigel, Memphis Bleek, and Jay-Z, and featured production from Roc-A-Fella&#x27;s in house producers Just Blaze and Kanye West. It featured two hit singles &quot;Oh Boy&quot; and &quot;Hey Ma&quot; (both featuring Juelz Santana), which both peaked in the top 5 on the Billboard Hot 100, as well as the moderately successful third single &quot;Daydreaming&quot;. The album was certified Platinum by the RIAA for selling over a million copies in America. From 2002 to 2003, Damon Dash signed several artists in response to Jay-Z&#x27;s talk of retirement after his 2002 album &quot;The Blueprint2: The Gift &amp; The Curse&quot;. He signed M.O.P. and Ol&#x27; Dirty Bastard, gave Grafh a joint-venture deal, and attempted to sign Twista and Joe Budden. Twista never signed to Roc-A-Fella due to his deal with Atlantic Records. Roc-A-Fella experienced its height in product releases and overall popularity as a brand name during this period. On March 25, 2003, Roc-A-Fella released The Diplomats&#x27; debut album &quot;Diplomatic Immunity&quot;. Despite not producing any major hits, the success of the singles &quot;Built This City&quot; and &quot;Dipset Anthem&quot; led to the album being certified Gold by the RIAA. In late 2003, the company released Jay-Z&#x27;s alleged final album, &quot;The Black Album&quot;. Rumors of friction between Carter and Dash became apparent; though denied by both camps at the time, problems involving Damon&#x27;s media attention and Jay&#x27;s alleged inaccessibility had been brewing since the music video shoot for &quot;Big Pimpin&#x27;&quot;.

After Jay-Z&#x27;s supposed last hurrah, it was revealed that he had accepted a position as CEO and President of Def Jam Recordings, and The Island Def Jam Music Group purchased the remaining 50 percent stake of Roc-A-Fella Records that IDJ didn&#x27;t already own. Dash, poised to take greater control in the company, began heavily promoting artists Cam&#x27;ron, The Diplomats, State Property, Kanye West, and Twista. In 2004, Kanye West&#x27;s album, &quot;The College Dropout&quot;, became a huge commercial and critical success, selling multi-Platinum-RIAA certified sales, and Foxy Brown was signed and began work on her album, &quot;Black Rose&quot;. The infamous &#x27;split&#x27; between Dash, Carter, and Burke occurred when it was revealed the trio had sold their 50% interest in Roc-A-Fella to The Island Def Jam Music Group, making the label full owners. As President, Carter retained control of the Roc and his masters, ousting his 2 former partners. He later explained that he had offered to turn down the position and ownership for the masters to &quot;Reasonable Doubt&quot; alone:

As Dash and Burke set up their own fledgling record label, originally called &quot;Roc4life&quot; and later rechristened to &quot;Dame Dash Music Group&quot;, each artist was offered their choice of labels. Memphis Bleek and Kanye West remained on Roc-A-Fella. Jimmy Jones and The Diplomats opted to leave Roc-A-Fella in 2004. Cam&#x27;Ron chose not to stay with either Dame Dash Music Group or Roc-A-Fella and instead stayed with Diplomat Records and signed with Asylum Records for distribution for his next two albums. Cam&#x27;ron was especially vocal in running a smear campaign against Jay-Z, claiming Jay-Z blocked him from an executive position Dash had offered him at Roc-A-Fella.

Beanie Sigel, then doing a year&#x27;s incarceration on an attempted murder charge, put out his album &quot;The B. Coming&quot; on Dame Dash and Roc-A-Fella; this was accompanied by accusations from Dash that of all the members of State Property, only Oschino had gone to visit Sigel in prison. Beanie had initially chosen Dame Dash Music Group, and he wanted to bring the rest of State Property over to Dame Dash. However, the rest of the group refused, preferring to remain on Roc-A-Fella; in response, Beanie Sigel effectively put the group on hold, claiming disappointment in his groupmates. M.O.P. and Grafh also left Roc-A-Fella for Dame Dash Music Group, though both acts parted ways with Dash soon thereafter. Due to the 2004 death of Ol&#x27; Dirty Bastard, Dash also brought with him masters of the rapper&#x27;s project and promises to release the album, &quot;A Son Unique&quot;, though this never occurred.

Memphis Bleek and Kanye West released &quot;534&quot; and &quot;Late Registration&quot;, respectively, in 2005, along with the Young Gunz&#x27; sophomore effort and Teairra Marí&#x27;s debut, though only Kanye West&#x27;s project saw significant sales. It was stated by Memphis Bleek that Cory Gunz had signed, but nothing materialized. By the end of the year, Dash had split his label from Def Jam and Jay-Z&#x27;s role overseeing his project, after asking for more money and a bigger role in the company. Dame Dash Music Group left Def Jam and was subsequently dissolved.

=== 2006–2009: Roc Redefinition and departure of Jay-Z ===
In 2006, releases were largely limited to those of Roc-La-Familia, a Latino-geared label under Roc-A-Fella that followed the trend of reggaeton. Héctor el Father and N.O.R.E. both put out albums, and the label was home to New York rapper Tru Life, but has since folded. Jay-Z made his return that year with &quot;Kingdom Come&quot;, to mixed reviews. He stepped down from his Def Jam position and put out a second album in 2007, &quot;American Gangster&quot;, to more positive reviews and sales, along with Kanye West&#x27;s &quot;Graduation&quot;, Beanie Sigel&#x27;s &quot;The Solution&quot;, and Freeway&#x27;s &quot;Free at Last&quot;; Kanye West&#x27;s album sold multi-platinum to rave reviews. Freeway&#x27;s project received acclaim but not major sales, and contained comments aimed at Kanye West and Just Blaze for not supplying production. He later amended his comments, stating he desired to work with Just Blaze but the producer hasn&#x27;t reached out. This may have been due to Just Blaze&#x27;s work on &quot;American Gangster&quot; and complications regarding his Atlantic-distributed label, Fort Knocks, and his artist Saigon.

The signing of Ruff Ryders artist Jadakiss, former rival to both Jay-Z and Beanie Sigel, also came in 2007, as did Uncle Murda. Foxy Brown was dropped from the label after 2 years, in light of a jail sentence. Though Young Chris and Peedi Crakk continued to appear on projects, neither seemed any closer to solo projects, and in 2008 Peedi Crakk announced that State Property had been dropped from the label. This was countered by Beanie Sigel&#x27;s manager, who confirmed that Beanie Sigel and Freeway were still part of Roc-A-Fella. Young Chris also apparently signed as a solo artist. 2008 saw only the release of Kanye West&#x27;s &quot;808s &amp; Heartbreak&quot;, garnering decent sales. It also brought repeated disses in songs and interviews from Peedi Crakk towards Jay-Z, claiming he held up his project on purpose, though he claims to have moved on. During that year, Jay-Z had signed a $150 million deal with Live Nation that included concerts, endorsements and recordings, and included a platform for him to launch his Roc Nation label. Uncle Murda left the label after a year and a half with no release, citing lack of executive interest after Jay-Z left Def Jam.

In March 2009, Freeway procured his release from Def Jam, claiming a need to explore his options; shortly, he announced his signing to Ca$h Money, while stating he would always respect Roc-A-Fella. Longtime signee Memphis Bleek also reported his departure from Def Jam, deciding not to travel to Roc Nation in favor of starting his own record label, but he is still very close with Roc-A-Fella. Additionally, Tru Life has been referred to as a &quot;1 time [or past] affiliate&quot; of Roc-A-Fella upon his turning himself in to authorities for his connection to a retaliatory stabbing. On May 21, 2009, Jay-Z had bought back his contract from Def Jam for an unprecedented $5,000,000 and started his deal with Live Nation.

=== 2010–2013: Final years and TufAmerica vs. Roc-A-Fella ===
Jadakiss briefly moved to Roc-A-Fella and released an album &quot;The Last Kiss&quot; before reuniting with Ruff Ryders. On May 3, 2010, Damon Dash relaunched Roc-A-Fella after nearly a year of inactivity with his 1st artist being former Young Money rapper Curren$y. Curren$y&#x27;s third album, &quot;Pilot Talk&quot;, was to be released under the newly relaunched Roc-A-Fella. However, Curren$y stated in interviews with both &quot;XXL&quot; and &quot;Complex&quot; that the album would be released under Damon Dash&#x27;s DD172 record label division, BluRoc Records and distributed through Def Jam. On August 8, 2011, Jay-Z and Kanye West released a collaborative album titled &quot;Watch the Throne&quot;. It was later revealed that Jay-Z was part of a short-lived relaunched Roc-A-Fella, as the album was released on Roc-A-Fella, Roc Nation, and Def Jam.

In September 2012, record label Tuff City, via its subsidiary TufAmerica, filed a lawsuit on the grounds of copyright infringement by Roc-A-Fella, seeking undisclosed damages. The complaint filed in federal court in Manhattan claims Roc-A-Fella and their parent Island Def Jam paid them a $62,500 license fee to sample Eddie Bo&#x27;s &quot;Hook and Sling, Part 1&quot; in Kanye West&#x27;s &quot;Who Will Survive in America&quot; and &quot;Lost in the World&quot;. Despite this, Tuff City says UMG and Roc-A-Fella &quot;failed and refused to enter into written license agreements that accounted for their multiple other uses of &#x27;Hook and Sling&#x27;&quot;. The unmentioned &quot;multiple other&quot; uses TufAmerica refers to are in the &quot;Lost in the World&quot; video and the short film based on Kanye&#x27;s &quot;Runaway&quot;. Tuff City is represented by New York attorney Kelly Talcott. 

On June 16, 2013, Jay-Z announced with a tweet: &quot;VII IV XIII Roc A Fella/Roc Nation&quot;, hinting a possible relaunch and revival of Roc-A-Fella and a possible merger with Roc Nation. However, it was later revealed that the tweet instead meant that Roc-A-Fella was only temporarily relaunched, specifically for the sole purpose of releasing his new album, &quot;Magna Carta Holy Grail&quot;.

== Legal issues ==
In June 2021, Roc-A-Fella sued its co-founder Damon Dash for attempting to auction off a non-fungible token representing the Jay-Z album &quot;Reasonable Doubt&quot;, due to Roc-A-Fella owning the rights to the album. In response, Dash claimed that he was not trying to sell the album, but his own share of the record label. On June 22, a restraining order prohibiting Dash from further selling the album was placed.

== Subsidiaries ==

=== ROC Films ===
In 2002, Roc-A-Fella released, through Lions Gate Entertainment, &quot;State Property&quot;. The movie, while not the first for Dash, would be the start of ROC Films/Roc-A-Fella Films. The film studio would go on to release &quot;Paid in Full&quot; the same year, and follow up in 2003 with &quot;Paper Soldiers&quot; and the hip-hop satire &quot;Death of a Dynasty&quot;. In 2005, the sequel to the studio&#x27;s debut release would hit theatres, &quot;State Property 2&quot;, featuring rap stars such as Beanie Sigel and Damon Dash, who also produced and co-created the story. Cameo roles included musicians Kanye West, N.O.R.E, and Mariah Carey, and light heavyweight champion boxers Bernard Hopkins and Winky Wright. The list of films include:

*&quot;Streets Is Watching&quot; (1998)
*&quot;Backstage&quot; (2000)
*&quot;State Property&quot; (2002)
*&quot;Paid in Full&quot; (2002)
*&quot;Paper Soldiers&quot; (2002)
*&quot;Death of a Dynasty&quot; (2003)
*&quot;Fade to Black&quot; (2004)
*&quot;State Property 2&quot; (2005)

=== Roc La Familia ===
Roc-La-Familia was founded in 2005 by then Roc-A-Fella and Def Jam President/CEO Shawn Carter. This sub-label was created to focus on signing international recording artists.

<doc id="768560" wikidata="Q1236195" url="?curid=768560" title="Pingback">
<text>A pingback is one of four types of linkback methods for Web authors to request notification when somebody links to one of their documents. This enables authors to keep track of who is linking to, or referring to their articles. Some weblog software and content management systems, such as WordPress, Movable Type, Serendipity, and Telligent Community, support automatic pingbacks where all the links in a published article can be pinged when the article is published. Other content management systems, such as Drupal and Joomla, support pingbacks through the use of addons or extensions.

Essentially, a pingback is an XML-RPC request (not to be confused with an ICMP ping) sent from Site A to Site B, when an author of the blog at Site A writes a post that links to Site B. The request includes the URI of the linking page. When Site B receives the notification signal, it automatically goes back to Site A checking for the existence of a live incoming link. If that link exists, the pingback is recorded successfully. This makes pingbacks less prone to spam than trackbacks. Pingback-enabled resources must either use an X-Pingback header or contain a codice_1 element to the XML-RPC script.

== History ==
The Pingback specification was developed in 2002 by Stuart Langridge, Simon Willison, and Ian Hickson.

== Exploits ==
In March 2014, Akamai published a report about a widely seen exploit involving pingback that targets vulnerable WordPress sites. This exploit led to massive abuse of legitimate blogs and websites and turned them into unwilling participants in a DDoS attack. Details about this vulnerability have been publicized since 2012, with Akismet reporting in 2013 that &quot;almost 100% of trackbacks and pingbacks are spam&quot;.

The pingback attacks consist of &quot;reflection&quot; and &quot;amplification&quot;: an attacker sends a pingback to a legitimate Blog A, but providing information of the legitimate Blog B (impersonation). Then, Blog A needs to check Blog B for the existence of the informed link, as it&#x27;s how the pingback protocol works, and thus it downloads the page off Blog B server&#x27;s, causing a &quot;reflection&quot;. If the target page is big, this &quot;amplifies&quot; the attack, because a small request sent to Blog A causes it to make a big request to Blog B. This can lead to 10x, 20x, and even bigger amplifications (DoS). It&#x27;s even possible to use multiple reflectors, to prevent exhausting each of them, and use the combined amplification power of each to exhaust the target Blog B, being by overloading bandwidth or the server CPU (DDoS).

WordPress changed a bit how the pingback feature works to mitigate this kind of vulnerability: the IP address that originated the pingback (the attacker address) started being recorded, and thus shown in the log. Notwithstanding, in 2016, pingback attacks continued to exist, supposedly because the website owners don&#x27;t check the user agent logs, that have the real IP addresses. If the attacker is more than a script kiddie, they will know how to prevent their IP address being recorded, by, for example, sending the request from another machine/site, so that this machine/site IP address is recorded instead, and the IP logging then, becomes less worthy. Thus, it&#x27;s still recommended to disable the pingbacks, to prevent attacking other sites (although this does not prevent being target of attacks).

<doc id="768571" wikidata="Q3308755" url="?curid=768571" title="1967 Atlantic hurricane season">
<text>The 1967 Atlantic hurricane season was an active Atlantic hurricane season overall, producing 13 nameable storms, of which 6 strengthened into hurricanes. The season officially began on June 1, 1967, and lasted until November 30, 1967. These dates, adopted by convention, historically describe the period in each year when most tropical cyclogenesis occurs in the Atlantic Ocean. The season&#x27;s first system, Tropical Depression One, formed on June 10, and the last, Tropical Storm Heidi, lost tropical characteristics on November 2.

Hurricane Beulah, the strongest storm of the season, and only major hurricane (Category 3 or above on the Saffir–Simpson scale), was also the most damaging. It caused 59 deaths and $235 million in damage (1967 USD) along its two-week-long path. Beulah formed on September 5 and soon after crossed southern Martinique into the Caribbean Sea. On the island, it dropped of rainfall in Les Anses-d&#x27;Arlet, causing severe flooding. Widespread evacuations occurred along the southern coast of the Dominican Republic due to fears of a repeat of Hurricane Inez from the previous year. After brushing the south coast of Hispaniola, the hurricane weakened and re-intensified, striking the Yucatán Peninsula and later near the United States/Mexico border. There, it caused severe river flooding, killing 34 people in the two countries.

Hurricanes Arlene and Chloe, as well as several tropical depressions, originated from tropical waves that left the coast of Africa. Chloe lasted for nearly 17 days, eventually dissipating over France after wrecking a ship offshore northern Spain, killing 14 people. Hurricane Doria co-existed with Beulah and Chloe, taking an unusual trajectory over the eastern United States; it killed three people in a boating accident offshore New Jersey. In late September, Tropical Storm Edith was a minimal storm that moved through the Lesser Antilles without serious impact. Hurricane Fern killed three people when it struck Mexico north of Tampico.

== Season summary ==
The 1967 Atlantic hurricane season officially began on June 1, and ran through November 30. These dates historically describe the period in each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic Ocean. Tropical cyclogenesis, the process in which a tropical cyclone develops, resulted mainly from tropical waves, the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), and decaying frontal systems. There were 30 tropical waves that exited the west coast of Africa at Dakar, Senegal; another 20 tropical disturbances originated offshore the Mid-Atlantic states, and 7 disturbances derived from cold-core lows. A total of 18 tropical depressions (tropical cyclones with maximum sustained winds of 38 mph (62 km/h) or less) formed during the season, 13 of which developed into named storms. Of those, six strengthened into hurricanes, while 1 system reached major hurricane intensity. This was the first season that non-developing tropical depressions were included into HURDAT, the National Hurricane Center(nbh)managed tropical cyclone database.

The season got off to a slow start, with the first operationally named storm, Arlene, not forming until August 28. The latency was caused by a stronger than normal ridge across the Atlantic Ocean, which suppressed convective activity across the basin and prevented the formation of strong low pressure areas. The season came to life in September, as seven tropical storms formed, including hurricanes Beulah, Chloe, and Doria. The season&#x27;s overall activity was reflected with an above normal Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) index of 121.7 units. ACE is, broadly speaking, a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed, so storms that last a long time, as well as particularly strong hurricanes, such as Beulah, have high ACEs. It is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 39 mph (63 km/h), which is the threshold for tropical storm status.
== Systems ==

=== Mid-June tropical storm ===

Satellite imagery and ship data indicated that Subtropical Depression Three formed at 18:00 UTC on June 14 to the northeast of the northeastern Bahamas, associated with an upper-level low. With a ridge to the northeast, the depression moved northwestward toward the Southeastern United States. Conditions were not favorable for strengthening, with cool air and minimal outflow, although the cyclone acquired gale-force winds by 12:00 UTC on August 16, becoming a subtropical storm. Shortly thereafter the system&#x27;s circulation contracted, indicative of a transition to tropical status 12 hours later. An approaching cold front turned the system northeastward on June 18. At 02:00 UTC, the minimal tropical storm moved ashore near Little River Inlet, South Carolina, with winds of . Weakening to a depression as it headed inland, the cyclone lost tropical characteristics by 12:00 UTC on June 22. Having transitioned into an extratropical storm, its remnants continued to the northeast, restrengthening slightly to a day later. Early on June 22, the system was absorbed by the front, and continued to the northeast into Nova Scotia. The system dropped locally heavy rainfall, peaking at in North Wilkesboro, North Carolina. In South Carolina, the rains caused flooding near Myrtle Beach, concurrent with above-normal tides, which caused $15,000 in damage, mostly to crops. Farther north, the rains were beneficial, with totals as high as in Saco, Maine.
=== Late June tropical storm ===

In mid-June, a lingering trough produced disorganized convection across the eastern Gulf of Mexico and western Atlantic. An area of low pressure developed northeast of Florida and gradually organized into a tropical depression around 00:00 UTC on June 20. Strong westerly shear affected the system, but it intensified into a tropical storm the next day and attained peak winds of as it maintained a small central dense overcast. The system gradually weakened beginning on June 22 and dissipated after 12:00 UTC on June 23 as it moved toward the east.
=== Hurricane Arlene ===

Following a series of weak tropical depressions emerging from the west coast of Africa, the ITCZ became more active at the end of August. A tropical wave exited the coast of Africa on August 24, and by the next day, a Pan American flight observed a circulation with falling pressures. Based on the system&#x27;s organization on satellite imagery, the NHC assessed that Tropical Depression Five developed late on August 28 about west of Cabo Verde. Steered by a strong ridge to its northeast, the nascent system tracked northwestward, strengthening into a tropical storm by 18:00 UTC on the following day. After two ships reported gale-force winds, the NHC began issuing advisories on Tropical Storm Arlene at 08:00 UTC on August 30. That day, Arlene quickly attained winds of . Concomitantly, the Hurricane Hunters observed winds of , although the storm was well below hurricane intensity at that time; this was due to Arlene&#x27;s interaction with the strong ridge.

Arlene failed to intensify much for nearly three days while passing through the Mid-Atlantic upper-level trough, although its wind speeds eventually increased. On September 2, Arlene turned to the north due to an approaching trough moving eastward from the Northeastern United States. Around that time, it began intensifying as it passed about east of Bermuda. The storm&#x27;s convection wrapped around the center and organized further as Arlene progressed northward. Turning to the northeast, the storm attained hurricane status by 18:00 UTC. Late on the next day, the Hurricane Hunters recorded a minimum barometric pressure of , which, along with the storm&#x27;s forward speed, suggested maximum sustained winds of ; together these data would signify Arlene&#x27;s peak intensity. Soon after, the storm transitioned into an extratropical cyclone, and was absorbed by the trough late on September 5 to the southeast of Newfoundland.
=== Early September tropical storm ===

A tropical wave moved off Africa on August 28, spawning a large area of disorganized convection as it moved west. The system became much better organized on September 1, and it developed into a tropical depression around 12:00 UTC that day. Moving along the Intertropical Convergence Zone, the cyclone further developed into a tropical storm winds of winds on September 3. Satellite imagery showed a compact storm with organized convection near its center. However, it began to weaken on September 4, and it dissipated over the central Atlantic after 18:00 UTC on September 5. The remnants of the storm may have been absorbed into the large circulation of Chloe to the east.
=== Hurricane Chloe ===

On September 4, a tropical wave exited the west coast of Africa, and by 18:00 UTC organized into Tropical Depression Eight between Cabo Verde and Senegal. Soon after, the depression moved through Cabo Verde, and it continued northwestward due to a passing mid-latitude trough. On September 6, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Chloe, but its intensity stabilized for the next three days. On September 9, intensification resumed, and the Hurricane Hunters visually observed winds of ; though these were judged to be too high, Chloe&#x27;s winds neared hurricane status. Maintaining intensity over the following day, Chloe turned sharply westward. By 12:00 UTC on September 11 Chloe attained hurricane status; around that time interaction with Hurricane Doria to the west turned Chloe more toward the northwest. Little more than a day later, Chloe peaked with winds of , and subsequently reached its minimum pressure of , as documented by reconnaissance aircraft. Due to the sparse observations in the area, it is possible that Chloe briefly reached major hurricane intensity, but data were insufficient for such an upgrade.

After maintaining peak winds for about 48 hours, Chloe weakened somewhat early on September 15, while still over the open waters of the east-central Atlantic Ocean. By 12:00 UTC the cyclone briefly dipped below Category 2 on the Saffir–Simpson scale, but re-intensified to recover its former status 12 hours later. Over the next three days the westerlies turned Chloe east-northeastward, but the storm maintained winds of during this timeframe. On September 18 the storm was last intercepted by the Hurricane Hunters southeast of Newfoundland. By 12:00 UTC on September 19 Chloe finally began to lose its strength, and a day later degenerated into a tropical storm. Chloe transitioned into an extratropical cyclone containing gales on September 21. On the same date, the extratropical remnants of Chloe reached the coastline of France near Bordeaux and quickly dissipated inland over central France. Off the northern coast of A Coruña, Spain, high waves from Chloe sank the &quot;Fiete Schulze&quot; – a German cargo ship attempting to circumnavigate the storm. Of the 42 person crew, 14 people drowned, and the others were rescued and brought to a West German hospital, sparking fear of kidnapping from the East German government.
=== Hurricane Beulah ===
A tropical wave exited the coast of Africa on August 28. Moving westward, it organized into Tropical Depression Seven at 12:00 UTC on September 5, while located about northeast of Barbados. On September 7, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Beulah, which crossed into the Caribbean Sea that day. After continued strengthening, Beulah became a hurricane on September 8, and two days later reached an initial peak of to the southwest of Puerto Rico. An anticyclone over the Bahamas turned the hurricane westward, as changing upper-level conditions from a passing trough to the north, as well as land interaction with Hispaniola, greatly weakened Beulah. The track shifted to the southwest and weakened further to a tropical storm.

On September 13, Beulah began a steady track to the northwest while passing south of Jamaica. On the next day, it re-intensified into a hurricane due to favorable conditions, strengthening to a major hurricane by September 17. Continuing to intensify, Beulah impacted Cozumel and later the east coast of the Yucatán Peninsula with winds of . After weakening over land, Beulah restrengthened over the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico, attaining peak winds of early on September 20, making it a Category 5 on the Saffir-Simpson scale. On two aircraft passes about seven hours apart, Hurricane Hunters reported a minimum pressure of , the second-lowest aircraft reading at the time after Hurricane Hattie in 1961. The pressure may have been lower between those passes around 00:00 UTC on that day as a result. Beulah weakened slightly before making its final landfall around 12:00 UTC on September 20, just south of the United States–Mexico border, with winds of and an estimated central pressure of . It weakened quickly over land and stalled near Alice, Texas, before turning to the southwest over Nuevo León on September 22.

On Martinique, Beulah dropped of rainfall in Les Anses-d&#x27;Arlet. Flooding rains damaged roads, bridges, and houses on Martinique and neighboring Saint Lucia. In the Lesser Antilles, Beulah caused $7.65 million in damage and 17 deaths. The storm caused minor damage and one death in southern Puerto Rico. After the severe impacts of Hurricane Inez a year prior, about 200,000 people evacuated the southern coast of the Dominican Republic. There, Beulah left heavy damage to roads, bridges, and the banana and coffee crops, but the evacuations led to a low death toll of two in the nation. Minor water damage occurred along Haiti&#x27;s southern Tiburon Peninsula. On Cozumel, Beulah&#x27;s strong winds destroyed 40% of the houses and heavily damaged many hotels, severely impacting the tourism industry. Along the northern Yucatán Peninsula, the winds wrecked a clock tower in Tizimín, killing five. Beulah dropped heavy rainfall in southern Texas and northeastern Mexico, peaking at in Pettus, Texas. The rains caused record river flooding, with a peak crest of along the San Antonio River at Goliad. In northeastern Mexico, Beulah killed 19 people, left 100,000 people homeless, and caused $26.9 million in damage. In Texas, damage reached $200 million, and there were 15 deaths, 5 of whom related to a then-record-breaking tornado outbreak that generated 115 tornadoes.
=== Hurricane Doria ===
A decaying cold front led to Subtropical Storm Nine developing on September 6 off the Southeastern United States. Containing winds of , it weakened to a subtropical depression on the following day, and drifted to the west-southwest before turning sharply to the northeast on September 9. That day it intensified into Tropical Storm Doria, becoming a hurricane with winds of on September 10 while east of the Florida–Georgia border. It briefly weakened to a tropical storm on September 11, but by the next day had already re-strengthened into a hurricane. Doria attained peak winds of on September 14, after which a ridge over New England turned the storm westward. On September 16, the hurricane weakened to tropical storm status to the south of New Jersey. At 00:00 UTC on September 17, Doria made landfall near Virginia Beach, Virginia, with winds of , and it later turned southward, re-emerging into the Atlantic Ocean east of Cape Lookout as a tropical depression. It then crossed over its former path before turning eastward, dissipating on September 21 southwest of Bermuda. Doria left $150,000 in minor coastal damage and killed three people when capsizing a boat offshore Ocean City, New Jersey.
=== Late September tropical storm ===

A convectively active tropical wave moved off the western coast of Africa on September 22. It tracked westward, remaining disorganized until September 25, when it developed into a tropical depression around 00:00 UTC. The small system harbored organized convection over its center, which was the basis for upgrading it to a tropical storm on September 27. The next day, it reached peak winds of . By September 30, the storm began to become less organized while it slowed in forward motion, a trend that caused the cyclone to dissipate after 12:00 UTC on October 1.
=== Tropical Storm Edith ===

A tropical disturbance moved westward from the African coast on September 20. On September 26, satellite imagery and ship observations indicated that a tropical depression about east of Barbados. At 21:00 UTC, the NHC issued their first advisory, naming the system &quot;Edith&quot;. A nearby ship reported waves on September 27, potentially indicating stronger winds during periods without meteorological observations, although unfavorable conditions prevented initial development. It was not until 12:00 UTC that Edith attained tropical storm force winds. Twelve hours later, the storm reached peak winds of , a trend that spurred hurricane watches from Dominica northward through the Leeward Islands. The storm failed to intensify due to its proximity to a cold upper-level trough and releasing too much latent heat. On September 30, Edith passed over Dominica as a weakened tropical storm and dissipated the next day over the eastern Caribbean Sea. It caused gusty winds and minor damage during its passage through the Lesser Antilles.
=== Hurricane Fern ===

Toward the end of September, a powerful cold front moved through the Gulf of Mexico and stalled over the Bay of Campeche. Convection persisted across the region as the surface pressure dropped. Satellite imagery suggested that Tropical Depression Fourteen developed on October 1 about northwest of Ciudad del Carmen. As the system organized more, it tracked northward, although a ridge to the north steered the nascent system to the west. On October 2, the British ship &quot;Plainsman&quot; observed gale-force winds, prompting the NHC to upgrade the depression to Tropical Storm Fern. A small system, the storm intensified further to hurricane status on October 3, reaching peak winds of and a minimum barometric pressure of . Upwelling and cold air left in the wake of Hurricane Beulah caused Fern to weaken slightly as it approached the Gulf Coast of Mexico. Around 06:00 UTC on October 4, Fern made landfall about north of Tampico, Tamaulipas, possibly having weakened to a tropical storm. It rapidly weakened over land, dissipating by 18:00 UTC.

Fern&#x27;s landfall was accompanied by an area of heavy rainfall that extended into the mountainous areas of Veracruz. The rains caused additional flooding along the Pánuco River, which became swollen during Hurricane Beulah two weeks prior. Three people drowned in the floodwaters. Damage was minor related to Fern. Along the lower Texas coast, the threat from Fern spurred high tide and small craft warnings from the National Weather Service. Additional members of the Texas National Guard, in place after Beulah, were activated due to the threat from Fern.
=== Tropical Storm Ginger ===

An area of convection developed off the west coast of Africa following the westward passage of Tropical Depression Sixteen. On October 5, it is estimated that Tropical Depression Seventeen developed from this system, based on the convective appearance on satellite imagery. Three ships reported winds on October 6, which was the basis for the NHC upgrading it to Tropical Storm Ginger, in conjunction with data from Cabo Verde. At the time, the storm was located about north-northwest of Dakar, Senegal, well east of 35° W where the NHC began issuing formal tropical cyclone advisories. Instead, the Rota, Spain Naval Fleet Station issued gale warnings in relation to the storm. Later on October 6, it was estimated that Ginger reached peak winds of and a minimum barometric pressure of . On October 7, the storm curved west-southwestward and quickly weakened into a tropical depression. Ginger dissipated on October 8 to the north of Cabo Verde.
=== October tropical storm ===

A tropical wave moved through the northeastern Caribbean on October 10, with a large area of associated thunderstorms. The wave interacted with a stalled frontal boundary, developing a broad circulation by October 13 to the northeast of the Bahamas. A day later, the system developed into a subtropical storm – its classification was because the system was co-located with a trough. There was another area of convection along the front northeast of the subtropical storm, which accelerated northeastward. Meanwhile, the subtropical storm turned westward. It had a small circulation with thunderstorms sheared north of the center, which gradually became more organized. On October 17, an approaching front turned the storm northward and later northeastward. On the same day, the subtropical storm transitioned into a tropical cyclone. On the next day, the storm attained peak winds of , before it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone over Atlantic Canada, where it was ultimately absorbed by the cold front on October 19.
=== Hurricane Heidi ===

An area of convection persisted on October 16 between the Lesser Antilles and Cabo Verde. It moved west-northwestward for several days, developing into Tropical Depression Twenty-Two on October 19 about northeast of the Lesser Antilles. The &quot;S.S. Sunrana&quot; moved through the storm on October 20, reporting winds of . At the time, the system was not named due to the lack of a warm thermal core, although it was later assessed as a tropical storm as of 18:00 UTC that day. On October 21, the Hurricane Hunters observed a weak circulation with winds of only . At the same time, the storm was located along the edge of a baroclinic zone, which limited strengthening. Curving northeastward due to an approaching trough, the storm intensified more on October 22, as a ship reported winds of . That day, data from the Hurricane Hunters observed a warm core, and the NHC classified the system as Tropical Storm Heidi. The storm was more of a hybrid storm initially, with the strongest winds near the center, spurring gale warnings for Bermuda. However, winds there only reached about during the storm&#x27;s passage.

The NHC initially anticipated that Heidi would become extratropical within two days. Early on October 23, the agency upgraded the storm to hurricane status about 105 mi (175 mi) southeast of Bermuda. Heidi moved quickly eastward with the approaching trough until October 25, when a building ridge caused the hurricane to move slowly northeastward in an area of light wind shear. Early on October 26, Heidi attained peak winds of about halfway between Bermuda and the Azores. By the next day, the hurricane had become much larger, with characteristics of an extratropical storm despite maintaining the warm thermal core. After stalling on October 29, Heidi turned westward and weakened to tropical storm status. Another approaching trough turned the storm back to the northeast on October 31. Later that day, Heidi started losing tropical characteristics, transitioning into an extratropical cyclone by November 1. Later that day, the remnants of Heidi were absorbed into the prevailing weather conditions of the north Atlantic Ocean.
=== Other systems ===

There were also five non-developing tropical depressions during the season.

On June 10, Tropical Depression One developed in the western Caribbean Sea, near the Gulf of Honduras. It moved northwestward, dissipating over the eastern Yucatán Peninsula on June 12.

A tropical wave exited Senegal on September 18 and progressing westward near Cabo Verde. A day later, it developed into Tropical Depression Fifteen. It moved across the Atlantic, dissipating on September 27 after entering the eastern Caribbean.

A tropical wave exited Africa on September 25. A day later, it became Tropical Depression Seventeen while moving near Cabo Verde. It dissipated on September 28.

From October 7–10, Tropical Depression Twenty-Two existed in the western Atlantic.

From October 15–17, Tropical Depression Twenty-Four existed in the central Atlantic.
== Storm names ==

The following list of names was used for named storms, of tropical storm and hurricane strength, that formed in the North Atlantic in 1967. Storms were named &quot;Chloe&quot;, &quot;Doria&quot;, &quot;Fern&quot;, &quot;Ginger&quot; and &quot;Heidi&quot; for the first time in 1967.

=== Retirement ===

The name &quot;Beulah&quot; was retired following the 1967 season, and will never be used for an Atlantic tropical cyclone again. It was replaced with &quot;Beth&quot; for the 1971 season.

== Season effects ==
This is a table of all of the tropical cyclones that formed in the 1967 Atlantic hurricane season. It includes their name, duration, peak classification and intensities, areas affected, damage, and death totals. Deaths in parentheses are additional and indirect (an example of an indirect death would be a traffic accident), but were still related to that storm. Damage and deaths include totals while the storm was extratropical, a wave, or a low, and all of the damage figures are in 1967 USD.

==Political career==

Prats began working in his early twenties with the Government of Puerto Rico. He worked closely with Sila M. Calderón, then Mayor of San Juan, being the city&#x27;s Public Affairs and Federal Relations Advisor.

In the 2000 elections, Prats was elected as an at-large Senator, becoming the youngest at-large member that year of the Puerto Rican Senate. During his tenure, Prats pushed legislation that sought to help low-income families, environmental statutes and transportation legislation, and was considered a consensus-builder.

In 2003, Sila M. Calderón announced she would not seek a second term as governor. The resident commissioner of Puerto Rico, Aníbal Acevedo Vilá, was chosen to run for governor in the elections of 2004. Senator Roberto Prats became the Popular Democratic Party&#x27;s nominee for resident commissioner for the upcoming elections, which he lost to Luis Fortuño, despite a big boost for his congressional campaign, when the Democratic National Committee (DNC) Chairman Terry McAuliffe endorsed him in March 2004. He subsequently was elected state chair of the Democratic Party in Puerto Rico, a position he currently holds, under DNC chairmen Howard Dean, with whom he also has a close relationship, Tim Kaine, the former governor of Virginia, Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman-Schultz and Donna Brazile. In the summer of 2016, he was elected to a fourth term as state chair.

One of Puerto Rico&#x27;s &quot;superdelegates&quot;, Prats announced his support in January 2008 of Sen. Hillary Clinton&#x27;s presidential bid and served, along with then-Puerto Rico Senate President Kenneth McClintock, as co-chair of her Hispanic Leadership Council, in spite of his former running mate&#x27;s (Gov. Acevedo Vilá&#x27;s) endorsement of Sen. Barack Obama. Prats and McClintock also co-chaired Clinton&#x27;s successful June 1, 2008 primary campaign in the U.S. territory. Both once again were her top spokespersons in Puerto Rico for the June 5, 2016 Puerto Rico primary, which she also won by over 60% of the vote.

In 2009, Prats was elected a member of the DNC&#x27;s executive committee, the highest ranking Puerto Rican within the Democratic National Committee.

In November 2010, he coauthored a book on the 2008 Hillary Clinton campaign in Puerto Rico with McClintock, then Secretary of State.

In September 2024, Prats wrote a letter asking the judge presiding over the bribery case involving US Senator Bob Menendez, asking for a lenient sentence for the lawmaker who accepted gold bars, cash and other bribes in exchange for favors using his influence and power on behalf of criminal associates and foreign governments. https://newjerseymonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/1-2-24-Menendez-sentencing-submission.pdf

<doc id="768582" wikidata="Q633730" url="?curid=768582" title="Archdeacon">
<text>An archdeacon is a senior clergy position in the Church of the East, Chaldean Catholic Church, Syriac Orthodox Church, Anglican Communion, St Thomas Christians, Eastern Orthodox churches and some other Christian denominations, above that of most clergy and below a bishop. In the High Middle Ages it was the most senior diocesan position below a bishop in the Catholic Church. An archdeacon is often responsible for administration within an archdeaconry, which is the principal subdivision of the diocese. The &quot;Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church&quot; has defined an archdeacon as &quot;A cleric having a defined administrative authority delegated to him by the bishop in the whole or part of the diocese.&quot; The office has often been described metaphorically as &quot;oculus episcopi&quot;, the &quot;bishop&#x27;s eye&quot;.

==Catholic Church==
In the Latin Catholic Church, the post of archdeacon, originally an ordained deacon (rather than a priest), was once one of great importance as a senior official of a diocese. The duties are now performed by officials such as auxiliary or coadjutor bishops, the vicar general, and the episcopal vicars. The title remains.

===History===
The term &quot;archdeacon&quot; appears for the first time in Optatus of Mileve&#x27;s history of Donatism of about 370, in which he applies it to someone who lived at the beginning of that century. From the office of the &quot;diaconus episcopi&quot;, a deacon whom the bishop selected to administer the church&#x27;s finances under the bishop&#x27;s personal direction, the office of archdeacon gradually developed, as certain functions were reserved to him by law. These functions included not only financial administration but also the discipline of the clergy, and examination of candidates for priesthood. From the 8th century, there was in the West a further development of the authority of the archdeacon, who now enjoyed a jurisdiction independent of the bishop.

Large dioceses had several archdeaconries, in each of which the archdeacon (usually by now a priest), had an authority comparable to that of the bishop. He was often appointed not by the bishop but by the cathedral chapter or the king. However, from the 13th century, efforts were made to limit their authority. This was effected in part by the institution of the new office of vicar general. In 1553, the Council of Trent removed entirely the independent powers of archdeacons. Those who had been in charge of different parts of the diocese gradually ceased to be appointed. Only the archdeacon associated with the cathedral chapter continued to exist as an empty title, with duties almost entirely limited to liturgical functions.

The title of archdeacon is still conferred on a canon of various cathedral chapters, and the word &quot;archdeacon&quot; has been defined in relation to the Latin Catholic Church as &quot;a title of honour conferred only on a member of a cathedral chapter&quot;.

However, Eastern Catholic Churches still utilize archdeacons.

==Anglican Communion==

Archdeacons serve the church in part of a diocese by taking particular responsibility for all buildings, the welfare of clergy and their families and the implementation of diocesan policy for the sake of the Gospel. An archdeaconry is their territorial division; these vary in number according to the size of the diocese and in a few, mainly English, cases an assistant (Suffragan) Bishop will also stand in as Archdeacon, as applied to the Archdeaconry of Bodmin 1953–62 (which is one of two archdeaconries in the Diocese of Truro). A later, possibly lasting instance, is in the role of Bishop suffragan(-Archdeacon) of Ludlow (in Shropshire).

They are usually styled &quot;The Venerable&quot; instead of their usual clerical style of &quot;The Reverend&quot;. In the Church of England the role can only be held by a priest who has been ordained for at least six years. (This rule was introduced in 1840. The rule that they be in priests&#x27; orders was enacted in 1662.) In the Church of England, the legal act by which a priest becomes an archdeacon is called a &quot;collation&quot;. If that archdeaconry is annexed to a canonry of the cathedral, they will also be &quot;installed&quot; (placed in a stall) at that cathedral, in practice working largely in the chapter offices.

In some other Anglican churches they can be deacons instead of priests; such archdeacons often work with the bishop to help with deacons&#x27; assignments to congregations and assist the bishop at ordinations and other diocesan liturgies. The Anglican ordinal presupposes (it is policy by default) that every Archdeacon helps to examine candidates for ordination and presents the most suitable candidate(s) to the ordaining bishop. In some parts of the Communion where women cannot be consecrated as bishops, the position is the most senior office a female cleric can hold: this being so, for instance, in the (Anglican) Diocese of Sydney.

Very rarely, &quot;lay archdeacons&quot; have been arisen, most notably the former Anglican Communion Observer to the United Nations, Taimalelagi Fagamalama Tuatagaloa-Leota, who retained her title after having served as Archdeacon of Samoa.

==Eastern Orthodox and Eastern Catholic churches==

In the Eastern Christian churches (Eastern Orthodox Church and Eastern Catholic Churches), an archdeacon is the senior deacon within a diocese and has responsibility for serving at hierarchical services (those at which the bishop is present and presiding). He has responsibility for ensuring the smooth running of the service by directing the clergy and servers as appropriate. As such, he usually travels with the ruling bishop to various parts of the diocese, and will sometimes act as his secretary and cell attendant, ensuring that he is able to balance his monastic life with his hierarchical duties. The archdeacon wears the double orarion, which is twice the length of the usual orarion, and wraps under the right arm as well as hanging from the left shoulder. An archdeacon may come from either the monastic or married clergy.

A protodeacon also wears the double orarion, although he is distinguished from the archdeacon in that he is the senior deacon at a cathedral or other principal church within a diocese and serves as the principal deacon when a number of deacons serve together.

==Saint Thomas Christians==

According to the canons of the Eastern churches, an archdeacon is of the highest priestly rank: he is the head of all the clerics belonging to a bishopric; he is responsible for the whole worship of the cathedral church and represents the will of the bishop in his absence. However, from the local point of view, the rank of an archdeacon was more important than this; not only was he the most important priest of the community, but he also fulfilled the role of an ethnarch. An archdeacon was the &quot;prince and head of the Christians of Saint Thomas&quot; and had such titles as &quot;Archdeacon and Gate of All India, Governor of India&quot;. The origin and the meaning of the term &quot;gate&quot; is mysterious. While the Catholicos Patriarch of Seleucia-Ctesiphon reserved for himself the right to send his own prelates originating from Iraq to the Indian diocese, the continuous governance of his Indian flock was secured by the indigenous Archdeacon serving as the head of all the priests in Malabar and representing the bishop&#x27;s will.

According to the traditional structure, the Indian Church of the East was governed by a metropolitan sent by the Catholicos Patriarch. At the same time, at the local level, in India, church affairs were governed by the Malabar Assembly or &quot;Malankara Yogam&quot;. There was also an indigenous head of the Church of Malabar, the &quot;head of the caste&quot;, that is the head of the St Thomas Christians called &quot;Jathikku Karthavyan&quot; or &quot;Malankara Mooppen&quot;. Patriarch Timothy (780–826) of Persia called him the head of the faithful in India.

While originally an archdeacon in the Church of the East was elected by the bishop according to merit, the office of the Archdeacon of India seems to have been dynastic. It was the privilege of the Pakalomattam family, at least from the sixteenth century onwards. Indeed, we know about a number of Pakalomattam archdeacons, beginning with 1502, when Metropolitan John of India appointed George Pakalomattam. The name of the family varies, and the family seems to be identical with the Parambil family, translated into Portuguese as &#x27;de Campo&#x27;.

An archdeacon had all the attributes of a secular leader and was normally escorted by a number, sometimes several thousands, of soldiers. While there could be several bishops appointed for the Malabar Church, there was always only one archdeacon, a custom contrary to the canons of the Church of the East. This situation is best explained by the fact that from the point of view of the East Syriac Church structure the archdeacon had an ecclesiastical function, but from that of the St Thomas Christian community he had also a socio-political, princely function, representing the unity of the Christian nation, or caste(s), of Hindoo (India). Portuguese colonists stopped this practice among the Syro-Malabar Catholic and Pulikkottil Mar Dionysious stopped this amongst the Malankara Syrian Church later in 1816.

==Coptic Christians==

In the Coptic Orthodox church, an archdeacon is the highest rank in the order of deacons. The lower ranks of the diaconate are deacon, subdeacon, lector and cantor, the holders of which ranks the Coptic people generically refer to as &quot;deacons&quot;. However, the rank of archdeacon is lower than the rank of a priest. Thus it is possible for a deacon to be appointed to the rank of an archdeacon within the Coptic Orthodox tradition.

<doc id="768586" wikidata="Q1637214" url="?curid=768586" title="Select fire">
<text>Select fire, is the capability of a weapon to be adjusted to fire in semi-automatic, fully automatic, and/or burst mode. The modes are chosen by means of a selector switch, which varies depending on the weapon&#x27;s design. Some select-fire weapons have burst fire mechanisms to limit the maximum number of shots fired automatically in this mode. The most common limits are two or three rounds per trigger pull. Fully automatic fire refers to the ability for a weapon to fire continuously until either the feeding mechanism is emptied or the trigger is released. Semi-automatic refers to the ability to fire one round per trigger pull.

The presence of select fire modes on firearms permits more efficient use of rounds to be fired for specific needs, versus having a single mode of operation, such as fully automatic, thereby conserving ammunition while maximizing on-target accuracy and effectiveness. This capability is most commonly found on military weapons of the 20th and 21st centuries.

==History==

Early attempts at this technology were hindered by one or both of two obstacles: over-powerful ammunition and mechanical complexity. The latter led to excessive weight and unreliability in the firearm. One of the earliest designs dates to just before the end of the 19th century with the development of the Cei-Rigotti, an early automatic rifle created by Italian Army officer Amerigo Cei-Rigotti that had select-fire capability (single shots or burst).

Another is the M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle (BAR) developed during the First World War. The BAR and its subsequent designs incorporated a variety of select-fire functions. The first design (M1918) is a select-fire, air-cooled automatic rifle that used a trigger mechanism with a fire selector lever that enabled operating in either semi-automatic or fully automatic firing modes. The selector lever is located on the left side of the receiver and is simultaneously the manual safety (selector lever in the &quot;S&quot; position – weapon is &quot;safe&quot;, &quot;F&quot; – &quot;Fire&quot;, &quot;A&quot; – &quot;Automatic&quot; fire). The next version (M1918A1) had a unique rate-of-fire reducer mechanism purchased from FN Herstal with two rates of automatic fire. This reducer mechanism was later changed to one designed by the Springfield Armory. The final version (M1918A2) provided two selectable rates of fully automatic fire only.

During World War II the Germans began development of the select-fire function which resulted in the FG 42 battle rifle developed in 1942 at the request of the German Air Force (&quot;Luftwaffe&quot;) in 1941. Another German design that used select fire was the StG 44 that was the first of its kind to see major deployment and is considered by many historians to be the first modern assault rifle. &quot;The principle of this weapon -- the reduction of muzzle impulse to get useful automatic fire within actual ranges of combat -- was probably the most important advance in small arms since the invention of smokeless powder.&quot;

The select-fire function was later seen in the Russian AK-47 (designed in 1946), the Belgian FN FAL (designed 1947–53) the British EM-2 (designed in 1948), and the U.S. AR-10 (designed in 1957) and its AR derivatives.

== Design ==
Select-fire weapons, by definition, have a semi-automatic mode, where the weapon automatically reloads the chamber after each fired round, but requires the trigger be released and pulled again before firing the next round. This allows for rapid and (in theory) aimed fire. In some weapons, the selection is between different rates of automatic fire and/or varying burst limiters. The selection is often by a small rotating switch often integrated with the safety catch or a switch separate from the safety, as in the British SA80 family. Another method is a weighted trigger, such as the Steyr AUG, which will fire a single shot when 4.0 - 7.1 kg (8.8 – 15.4 lbs.) of weight is exerted on the trigger, and then become fully automatic when over 7.1 kg (15.4 lbs.) of weight is applied. This is useful for emergency situations where a rapid volley of rounds is more effective for suppressing a close enemy rather than a single-round burst (multiple single shots with a trigger pull for each round).

Some select-fire weapons offer a burst mode as the second option, where each pull of the trigger automatically fires a predetermined number of rounds (generally two or three), but will not fire any more until the trigger is released and pulled again. The current U.S. standard assault rifle, the M16A4, and the M4 carbine variant of this rifle fire a maximum of three rounds with each pull of the trigger in burst mode. In this design, it retains the count of previously fired rounds and may fire fewer than three rounds. Other designs reset the count with each trigger pull, allowing a uniform three-round burst as long as rounds remain.

A common version of the Heckler &amp; Koch MP5 submachine gun (which is widely used by SWAT teams and military special operations personnel) fires single shots, three-round-bursts, and automatically. A special variant uses a two-round-burst to minimize the chances of missing with a third round. Some automatic cannons have larger burst limiters to coincide with higher rates of fire.

<doc id="768597" wikidata="Q288685" url="?curid=768597" title="Villarrica, Paraguay">
<text>Villarrica del Espíritu Santo (), is a city in Paraguay. Located in the middle of the Eastern Region of Paraguay, it is the capital and most populous city of Guairá Department.

It is located to the center west of Guairá and is bordered to the east by the towns of Mbocayaty and Yataity, to the west by Itapé and Félix Pérez, to the east by Independencia, Ñumí and Garay, and to the south by San Salvador and Borja.

Founded in 1570 by Sevillian Ruy Díaz de Melgarejo, it is one of the oldest settlements in Paraguay. Nevertheless, the original foundation site was located within the extinct Spanish province of Guayra in what is now the state of Parana in Brazil. The residents of Villarrica were forced to relocate seven times during a timespan of more than 100 years. These relocations were mainly caused by the repeated attacks from the neighbouring portuguese bandeirantes but also by political and economical issues. They were finally settled in its current location near Ybytyruzu hills in 1683. As a result, the city got the nickname of &quot;Wandering City&quot;. 

After the end of the Paraguayan War in 1870, Villarrica experimented a rapid economical and populational growth becoming the second most important Paraguayan city after the capital Asuncion. Nowadays, the city is still a well-known cultural hub.

== History ==

=== Background ===

The Tordesillas Treaty signed by Castile and Portugal set ambiguous borders between the two empires in South America. Portugal took an aggressive and expansionist policy usually disrespecting the agreements of the treaty. Meanwhile, the Spanish in Asuncion decided to settle more towns to the east closer to the Portuguese border to reinforce their territorial claims. 

In the 1550s, what is now Paraguay was a province of the Governorate of New Andalusia and was ruled by Captain Domingo Irala. Under the command of Irala, they founded a city named &quot;Ontiveros&quot; to continue the conquest of the lands to the east of Asuncion known as the &quot;lands of Guayrá&quot;. In 1557, Ruy Diaz Melgarejo founded another city in Guayrá named &quot;Ciudad Real&quot; with the purpose of reducing the abuse that the Portuguese were inflicting on the Cario Indigenous tribe but also due to the strategic location as a trail towards Brazil. A couple of years later, the interim Governor Felipe de Cáceres has a personal dispute with Melgarejo and drives him out of the office of governor of the province of Guayra. Cáceres appoints an Andalusian conquistador named Alonso Riquelme to replace Melgarejo. When Riquelme arrives in Ciudad Real, Melgarejo has him arrested, incarcerated and later banished to a cabin forty leagues away of the town.  

=== Settlement ===

In the 16th century, Melgarejo departs from Ciudad Real with 40 men and 53 horses towards the East where he expected to find mines of gold and silver. After arriving in the lands of Indian chief named Cuaracybera (Shining-Sun), he settles a new town on May 14, 1570, and names it &quot;Villa Rica del Espíritu Santo&quot; (Wealthy village of the Holy Ghost) because of the belief that there were precious metals in the area and because the date was near the Catholic festivity of the Holy Ghost. 

In 1592, explorer Ruy Díaz de Guzman moves the city 100 km east. In 1599, he moves it again, this time near the Mboteitei River, 100 leagues from Asunción. After long years of peaceful existence, the city was invaded in 1632 by the bandeirantes, and after 4 years of pilgrimage the population settles near Mbaracayu hills. Two years later, Governor Valderrama determined to situate it in the fields of Yaru. In 1642, the population moves again this time to Curuguaty. In 1678, the population settled close to the Tobatyry River, in a place called &quot;Espinillo&quot;. The soil was no good for agriculture so many people decided to do a recognition expedition of the area beyond the Tebicuarymi River. 

On the other side of the river, they found fertile land and several streams near the Ybytyruzú hills so they requested the Spanish Governor&#x27;s authorization to move the city again. On May 25, 1682, the Governor issued the license to settle in Ybyturuzú to await the King&#x27;s official approval. On May 14, 1701 King Philip V issues the Royal Order that approves the permanent settlement of the city in Ybyturuzú. This date became the ultimate date of foundation. The Franciscan missionaries helped the town&#x27;s stabilization, founding the Guaraní Mission of Itapé

=== 1600s to 20th century ===

The Franciscan friars in an effort of educating the population and gaining souls to the Catholic faith ran a convent that worked as an elementary and secondary school from the 1600s until 1818 when Gaspar de Francia the dictator of Paraguay had it shut as part of his policy of retaining absolute control over the country. Schools were reopened in 1844 after Francia died but only to be shut again in 1865 with the declaration of the Paraguayan War. When the war was over in 1870, Villarrica had a very small population due to the large casualties. In 1888, the railway got to Villarrica which started a rapid population and economical growth. 

From 1892 to the beginning of the 1900s, the city received an important influx of Italians, French, Spaniards, Germans, Ashkenazi Jews, Argentines, Uruguayans and a lesser number of Lebanese, Croats and Greeks. These immigrants helped develop the industry, the culture and the education making Villarrica the second most important city after the capital, Asuncion. However, the two Paraguayan civil wars had a deep effect in the city, especially the so called Revolution of 1947 when the Paraguayan military took over and cause the migration of thousands of Paraguayans and an important part of Villarrica intellectual people spread across the country or made it to Argentina. A similar phenomenon occurred from 1954 to 1989 with the political persecutions during the regime of Alfredo Stroessner. By the end of the 20th century Villarrica had lost its prominent position within the country to newer settlements like Ciudad del Este, Encarnacion and Luque. 

== Geography ==
The district of Villarrica is located 20 km to the west of Ybytyruzu hills, 172 km to the east of Asunción, 237 km to the north of Encarnación and 217 km to the west of Ciudad del Este. Within the department of Guairá, it is located in the central-western region at a height of about 200m above sea level. The municipal territory has roughly a shape of a triangle and has an area of 247 km2.

=== Geology and Orography ===
The soil is composed of sandstones interbedded with shales and oolitic calcareous formations. In the alluvial plains of the Tebicuarymí River, there seems to be Quaternary sediments. 

The soils of the urban area are mainly sandy hills, with gentle slopes in the northern area and slightly steeper slopes in the south. Good drainage and no rockiness are also observed. Both in the urban area of Villarrica and in 14 de Mayo area (on the way to Ñumí) you can find ferruginous laterites and they occur in thick layers that support small topographic elevations. Due to the heavy deforestation, one can observe primitive tree species almost exclusively in areas of difficult access such as banks of streams. A great variety of grasses and palm trees grow In its terrain of undulating plains. Grass can be natural grasslands or cultivated in order to feed cattle. The current extension of the palm groves is small but is increasing due to soil degradation. 

=== Hydrography ===

Due to the particularly isolated location of Villarrica, there is no river that reaches its municipal territory. Instead, the city is irrigated by a network of tributary streams of the river Tebicuarymi. The type of drainage is centrifugal and good internal drainage in the urban area. There are springs that drain to the south, to a stream named Guarapo and this one drains to the Bolas Cuá stream basin. 

To the north there is a stream named Bobo that serves as the border with the town of Mbocayaty. Almost parallel to the Bobo stream, there is one of its tributaries called Mitay. Mitay stream which serves as the limit between Villarrica and Yataity. To the west there is a tributary of Mitay stream named Kaundy. Kaundy is the border between Villarrica and Félix Pérez. Both Kaundy and Bobo are tributaries to Mitay stream. Mitay feeds into Tebicuarymi river to the northwest. 

Three streams in the urban area named Itacua, Carumbey and Ycuaangua feed into another stream named Yhu. Yhu is a tributary of Bolas Cua and its confluence is located in the hamlet of Caazapami to the southwest of the municipality. In the southeastern end of the municipal territory, in an area named 14 de Mayo, there is a stream named Remansito which is the limit between Villarrica and the town of Ñumí. The Remansito runs slightly to the southwest. The Ovie stream is located southeast of the municipality between the areas 14 de Mayo and Lemos and runs towards the southwest until it merges with the Remansito to form a new stream named Bolas Cua. The Bolas Cuá stream, initially runs to the southwest where it serves as the border between Villarrica and San Salvador. However, when crossing the area named Yhacamí (San Salvador) it takes the northwest and once again borders the territory of Villarrica (Caazapamí) where it serves as the border between Villarrica and the town of Borja. Bolas Cua ultimately feeds into Tebicuarymi river. 

=== Native Species ===

Native animals that can be observed within the territory of the city are the following: 

* Birds: Pitangus sulphuratus, Cyanochorax chrysops, Procnias nudicollis, Nyctibius griseus, Campephilus melanoleucos, Mergus octosetaceus, Vanellus chilensis and Amazona vinacea.
* Reptiles: Hydrodynastes gigas, Eunectes notaeus and Dracaena paraguayensis. 
* Mammals: Myrmecophaga tridactyla, Cerdocyon thous, Didelphis albiventris and Vampyressa pusilla.

The most vulnerable animal species are the giant otter and the mantle hawk. The apex-predator, the jaguar is currently extinct in Villarrica and western Guaira. 

As for native trees one can frequently see Handroanthus impetiginosus (pink lapacho), Handroanthus serratifolius (yellow lapacho), Jacaranda mimosifolia (blue jacaranda), Peltophorum dubium (ibirapita), Cordia trichotoma and Enterolobium contortisiliquum (pacara earpod tree). 

Some native fruit are the passion fruit (Passiflora edulis), acerola cherry (Malpighia emarginata), brazilian cherry (Eugenia uniflora), macaw palm fruit (Acrocomia aculeata) and a fruit called &quot;aratiku&quot; (Annona nutans)
===Climate===
Villarica has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen &quot;Cfa&quot;) bordering on a tropical rainforest climate (&quot;Af&quot;) and a tropical monsoon climate (&quot;Am&quot;). The climate, in general is benign and healthy, with an average temperature of . In summer it can reach , while in winter it can drop to . The rainiest months are January and November.

== Demographics ==
The influx of European immigrants the city received in the late 19th century constituted a significant part of the ethnic make up of Villarrica until the second Paraguayan Civil War in 1947. After this conflict the number of European-descended people started to shrink rapidlly due to emigration to Asuncion and Argentina, decreasing birth rates among the Europeans, increasing birth-rates of the locals and mixed-unions with the already majoritary population with significant Indigenous and Sub-Saharian African ancestry. By the end of the 20th century the racial make up of Villarrica was virtually identical to the one of Paraguay having over 90% of racially-mixed residents who prefer to speak Jopara and Guarani over plain Spanish. 

=== Subdivisions ===

There are 14 neighborhoods that comprise the urban area and 23 hamlets that comprise the rural area. 
==Economy==

The most important economic activities of Villarrica are commerce of Brazilian and Argentine goods, services and family-owned industries like sugar processing, furniture making and shoemaking. Commerce has such a relevance in the economy of the city as the universities attract students from all the other towns in Guaira, the departments of Caaguazu and Caazapa but also medical students from Brazil. As for agriculture, it has a decreasing importance. Only 10% of the total sugar cane cultivation of Guaira comes from Villarrica.

There are two paved roads that communicate Villarrica with the town of Itapé. The first one(18km) departs from Lomas Valentinas neighborhood and the other one (23km) departs from Santa Librada neighborhood. The road that communicates Villarrica directly to neighboring town of Felix Perez is still a dirt road.

Water service is provided by the government owned company ESSAP. Electricity is provided by the local private company CLYFSA. Villarrica is the only municipality in Paraguay that gets its electricity service from a private company. The service for Internet access is provided by the companies Tigo, Personal and the state-owned COPACO.

Many renowned Paraguayan artists such as poet Manuel Ortiz Guerrero, classical composer Diego Sanchez Haase and guitar player Cayo Sila Godoy were born and raised there. Several other Villarrica natives have been very relevant especially in education, journalism and literature. In addition, many towns in Paraguay such as Caaguazu, Mbocayaty, Independencia and even Union in San Pedro Department are said to have been settled by pioneers and families from Villarrica. 

The oldest social club in Paraguay named Club Porvenir Guaireño was founded in Villarrica in 1888 and the first private electricity company named CLYFSA was also founded in the city in 1953. The second most popular political party in Paraguay, the PLRA was founded in Villarrica in 1886 by Villarrica-born Antonio Taboada.

<text>World War I was the first major conflict involving the use of aircraft. Tethered observation balloons had already been employed in several wars and would be used extensively for artillery spotting. Germany employed Zeppelins for reconnaissance over the North Sea and Baltic and also for strategic bombing raids over Britain and the Eastern Front.

Airplanes were just coming into military use at the outset of the war. Initially, they were used mostly for reconnaissance. Pilots and engineers learned from experience, leading to the development of many specialized types, including fighters, bombers, and trench strafers.

Ace fighter pilots were portrayed as modern knights, and many became popular heroes. The war also saw the appointment of high-ranking officers to direct the belligerent nations&#x27; air war efforts.

While the impact of airplanes on the course of the war was mainly tactical rather than strategic, the most important role being direct cooperation with ground forces (especially ranging and correcting artillery fire), the first steps in the strategic roles of aircraft in future wars were also foreshadowed.

==The early years of war==

At the 1911 meeting of the Institute of International Law in Madrid, legislation was proposed to limit the use of aeroplanes to reconnaissance missions and banning them from being used as platforms for weapons. This legislation was rooted in a fear that aeroplanes would be used to attack undefended cities, violating Article 25 of the Den Hague &quot;Reglement&quot; (the set of international laws governing warfare)&quot;.&quot;

At the start of the war, there was some debate over the usefulness of aircraft in warfare. Many senior officers, in particular, remained skeptical. However the initial campaigns of 1914 proved that cavalry could no longer provide the reconnaissance expected by their generals, in the face of the greatly increased firepower of twentieth century armies, and it was quickly realised that aircraft could at least locate the enemy, even if early air reconnaissance was hampered by the newness of the techniques involved. Early skepticism and low expectations quickly turned to unrealistic demands beyond the capabilities of the primitive aircraft available.

Even so, air reconnaissance played a critical role in the &quot;war of movement&quot; of 1914, especially in helping the Allies halt the German invasion of France. Aircraft were first used in Alexander von Kluck&#x27;s German First Army during the Battle of Mons to target its guns on British II Corps positions. On 22 August 1914, British Captain L.E.O. Charlton and Lieutenant V.H.N. Wadham of the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) reported von Kluck&#x27;s forces were preparing to surround the British Expeditionary Force, contradicting all other intelligence. The British High Command took note of the report and started to withdraw from Mons, saving the lives of 100,000 soldiers. Later, during the First Battle of the Marne, observation aircraft discovered weak points and exposed flanks in the German lines, allowing the allies to take advantage of them.

In Germany the great successes of the early Zeppelin airships had largely overshadowed the importance of heavier-than-air aircraft. Out of a paper strength of about 230 aircraft belonging to the army in August 1914 only 180 or so were of any use. The French military aviation exercises of 1911, 1912, and 1913 had pioneered cooperation with the cavalry (reconnaissance) and artillery (spotting), but the momentum was, if anything, slacking.

The United Kingdom had &quot;started late&quot; and initially relied largely on the French aircraft industry, especially for aircraft engines. The initial British contribution to the total allied airwar effort in August 1914 (of about 184 aircraft) was three squadrons with about 30 serviceable machines. By the end of the war, the British Armed Forces had formed the world&#x27;s first air force to be independent of either army or naval control, the Royal Air Force. The United States Armed Forces air services were far behind; even in 1917, when the United States entered the war, they were to be almost totally dependent on the French and British aircraft industries for combat aircraft.

The Germans&#x27; great air &quot;coup&quot; of 1914 was at the Battle of Tannenberg in East Prussia, where an unexpected Imperial Russian Army attack was reported by &quot;Leutnants&quot; Canter and Mertens, resulting in the Russians being forced to withdraw.

===Early Western Front reconnaissance duties===
By the end of 1914 the line between the Imperial German Army and the Allied powers stretched from the North Sea to the Alps. The initial &quot;war of movement&quot; largely ceased, and the front became static. Three main functions of short range reconnaissance squadrons had emerged by March 1915.

The first was photographic reconnaissance: building up a complete mosaic map of the enemy trench system. The first air cameras used glass plates. (Photographic film had been invented by Kodak, but did not at this stage have sufficient resolution).
Artillery &quot;spotting&quot; enabled the ranging of artillery on targets invisible to the gunners. Radio telephony was not yet practical from an aircraft, so communication was a problem. By March 1915, a two-seater on &quot;artillery observation&quot; duties was typically equipped with a primitive radio transmitter transmitting using Morse code, but had no receiver. The artillery battery signalled to the aircraft by laying strips of white cloth on the ground in prearranged patterns. Observation duties were shared with the tethered balloons, which could communicate directly with their batteries by field telephone, but were far less flexible in locating targets and reporting the fall of shot.

&quot;Contact patrol&quot; work attempted to follow the course of a battle by communicating with advancing infantry while flying over the battlefield. The technology of the period did not permit radio contact, while methods of signalling were necessarily crude, including dropping messages from the aircraft. Soldiers were initially reluctant to reveal their positions to aircraft, as they (the soldiers) found distinguishing between friend and foe problematic.

Reconnaissance flying, like all kinds, was a hazardous business. In April 1917, the worst month for the entire war for the RFC, the average life expectancy of a British pilot on the Western Front was 93 flying hours.

===Early bombing efforts===

Typical 1914 aircraft could carry only very small bomb loads – the bombs themselves, and their storage, were still very elementary, and effective bomb sights were still to be developed. Nonetheless the beginnings of strategic and tactical bombing date from the earliest days of the war. Notable are the raids by the RNAS on the German airship sheds at Düsseldorf, Cologne and Friedrichshafen in September, October and November 1914, as well as the formation of the &quot;Brieftauben Abteilung Ostende&quot;.

==The dawn of air combat==
As Dickson had predicted, initially air combat was extremely rare, and definitely subordinate to reconnaissance. There are even stories of the crew of rival reconnaissance aircraft exchanging nothing more belligerent than smiles and waves. This soon progressed to throwing grenades, and other objects—even grappling hooks. The first aircraft brought down by another was an Austrian reconnaissance aircraft rammed on 8 September 1914 by a Russian pilot Pyotr Nesterov in Galicia in the Eastern Front. Both planes crashed as the result of the attack, killing all occupants. Eventually, pilots began firing handheld firearms at enemy aircraft; however, pistols were too inaccurate and the single-shot rifles too unlikely to score a hit. On August 23, 1914, no 5 Squadron British observer Lt Leslie da Costa Penn Gaskell opened fire on a German aircraft with a machine gun for the first time and the era of air combat was underway as more and more aircraft were fitted with machine guns.

===Evolution of fighter aircraft===
====The pusher solution====
As early as 1912, designers at the British firm Vickers were experimenting with machine gun carrying aircraft. The first concrete result was the Vickers Experimental Fighting Biplane 1, which featured at the 1913 Aero Show in London. and appeared in developed form as the FB.5 in February 1915. This pioneering fighter, like the Royal Aircraft Factory F.E.2b and the Airco DH.1, was a pusher type. These had the engine and propeller behind the pilot, facing backward, rather than at the front of the aircraft, as in a tractor configuration design. This provided an optimal machine gun position, from which the gun could be fired directly forward without an obstructing propeller, and reloaded and cleared in flight. An important drawback was that pusher designs tended to have an inferior performance to tractor types with the same engine power because of the extra drag created by the struts and rigging necessary to carry the tail unit. The F.E.2d, a more powerful version of the F.E.2b, remained a formidable opponent well into 1917, when pusher fighters were already obsolete. They were simply too slow to catch their quarry.

====Machine gun synchronisation====
The forward firing gun of a pusher &quot;gun carrier&quot; provided some offensive capability—the mounting of a machine gun firing to the rear from a two-seater tractor aircraft gave defensive capability. There was an obvious need for some means to fire a machine gun forward from a tractor aircraft, especially from one of the small, light, &quot;scout&quot; aircraft, adapted from pre-war racers, that were to perform most air combat duties for the rest of the war. It would seem most natural to place the gun between the pilot and the propeller, firing in the direct line of flight so that the gun could be aimed by &quot;aiming the aircraft&quot;. It was also important that the breech of the weapon be readily accessible to the pilot so that he could clear the jams and stoppages to which early machine guns were prone. However, this presented an obvious problem: a percentage of bullets fired &quot;free&quot; through a revolving propeller will strike the blades, with predictably destructive results.
Early experiments with synchronised machine guns had been carried out in several countries before the war. Franz Schneider, then working for Nieuport in France but later working for L.V.G. in Germany, patented a synchronisation gear on 15 July 1913. Early Russian gear was designed by a Lieutenant Poplavko: the Edwards brothers in England designed the first British example, and the Morane-Saulnier company were also working on the problem in 1914. All these early experiments failed to attract official attention, partly due to official inertia and partly due to the failures of early synchronising gears, which included dangerously ricocheting bullets and disintegrating propellers.
The Lewis gun used on many Allied aircraft was almost impossible to synchronise due to the erratic rate of fire resulting from its open bolt firing cycle. 
Some RNAS aircraft, including Bristol Scouts, had an unsynchronised fuselage-mounted Lewis gun positioned to fire directly through the propeller disk. The propeller blades were reinforced with tape to hold the wood together if hit, and it relied on the fact that the odds of any single round hitting a blade below 5%, so if short bursts were used, it offered a temporary expedient even if it was not an ideal solution.

The Maxim guns used by both the Allies (as the Vickers) and Germany (as the Parabellum MG 14 and Spandau lMG 08) had a closed bolt firing cycle that started with a bullet already in the breech and the breech closed, so the firing of the bullet was the next step in the cycle. This meant that the exact instant the round would be fired could be more readily predicted, making these weapons considerably easier to synchronise.
The standard French light machine gun, the Hotchkiss, was, like the Lewis, also unamenable to synchronisation. Poor quality control also hampered efforts, resulting in frequent &quot;hang fire&quot; rounds that didn&#x27;t go off. The Morane-Saulnier company designed a &quot;safety backup&quot; in the form of &quot;deflector blades&quot; (metal wedges), fitted to the rear surfaces of a propeller at the radial point where they could be struck by a bullet. Roland Garros used this system in a Morane-Saulnier L in April 1915. He managed to score several kills, although the deflectors fell short of an ideal solution as the deflected rounds could still cause damage. Engine failure eventually forced Garros to land behind enemy lines, and he and his secret weapon were captured by the Germans.
Famously, the German High Command passed Garros&#x27; captured Morane to the Fokker company—which already produced Morane type monoplanes for the German Air Service—with orders to copy the design. The deflector system was totally unsuitable for the steel-jacketed German ammunition so that the Fokker engineers were forced to revisit the synchronisation idea (perhaps infringing Schneider&#x27;s patent), crafting the &quot;Stangensteuerung&quot; system by the spring of 1915, used on the examples of their pioneering &quot;Eindecker&quot; fighter. Crude as these little monoplanes were, they produced a period of German air superiority, known as the &quot;Fokker Scourge&quot; by the Allies. The psychological effect exceeded the material: The Allies had up to now been more or less unchallenged in the air, and the vulnerability of their older reconnaissance aircraft, especially the British B.E.2 and French Farman pushers, came as a very nasty shock.

====Other methods====

Another method used at this time to fire a machine gun forward from a tractor design was to mount the gun to fire above the propeller arc. This required the gun to be mounted on the top wing of biplanes and be mounted on complicated drag-inducing structures in monoplanes. Reaching the gun so that drums or belts could be changed, or jams cleared, presented problems even when the gun could be mounted relatively close to the pilot. Eventually, Foster mounting became more or less the standard way of mounting a Lewis gun in this position in the R.F.C.: this allowed the gun to slide backward for drum changing, and also to be fired at an upward angle, a very effective way of attacking an enemy from the &quot;blind spot&quot; under its tail. This type of mounting was still only possible for a biplane with a top wing positioned near the apex of the propeller&#x27;s arc: It put considerable strain on the fragile wing structures of the period, and it was less rigid than a gun mounting on the fuselage, producing a greater &quot;scatter&quot; of bullets, especially at anything but very short range.

The earliest versions of the Bristol Scout to see aerial combat duty in 1915, the Scout C, had Lewis gun mounts in RNAS service that sometimes were elevated above the propeller arc, and sometimes (in an apparently reckless manner) firing directly through the propeller arc without synchronisation. During the spring and summer of 1915, Captain Lanoe Hawker of the Royal Flying Corps, however, had mounted his Lewis gun just forward of the cockpit to fire forwards and outwards, on the left side of his aircraft&#x27;s fuselage at about a 30° horizontal angle. On 25 July 1915 Captain Hawker flew his Scout C, bearing RFC serial number 1611 against several two-seat German observation aircraft of the &quot;Fliegertruppe&quot;, and managed to defeat three of them in aerial engagements to earn the first Victoria Cross awarded to a British fighter pilot, while engaged against enemy fixed-wing aircraft.

==1915: The Fokker Scourge==

The first purpose-designed fighter aircraft included the British Vickers F.B.5, and machine guns were also fitted to several French types, such as the Morane-Saulnier L and N. Initially the German Air Service lagged behind the Allies in this respect, but this was soon to change dramatically.

In July 1915 the Fokker E.I, the first aircraft to enter service with a &quot;synchronisation gear&quot; which enabled a machine gun to fire through the arc of the propeller without striking its blades, became operational. This gave an important advantage over other contemporary fighter aircraft. This aircraft and its immediate successors, collectively known as the &quot;Eindecker&quot; (German for &quot;monoplane&quot;) – for the first time supplied an effective equivalent to Allied fighters. Two German military aviators, &quot;Leutnants&quot; Otto Parschau and Kurt Wintgens, worked for the Fokker firm during the spring of 1915, demonstrating the revolutionary feature of the forward-firing synchronised machine gun to the embryonic force of &quot;Fliegertruppe&quot; pilots of the German Empire.

The first successful engagement involving a synchronised-gun-armed aircraft occurred on the afternoon of July 1, 1915, to the east of Lunéville, France when &quot;Leutnant&quot; Kurt Wintgens, one of the pilots selected by Fokker to demonstrate the small series of five special Eindecker service-test prototype aircraft, forced down a French Morane-Saulnier &quot;Parasol&quot; two seat observation monoplane behind Allied lines with his Fokker M.5K/MG Eindecker production prototype/service-test aircraft, carrying the IdFlieg military serial number &quot;E.5/15&quot;. Some 200 shots from the synchronised Parabellum MG14 machine gun on Wintgens&#x27; aircraft had hit the Gnome Lambda rotary engine of the Morane Parasol, forcing it to land safely in Allied territory.

By late 1915 the Germans had achieved air superiority, rendering Allied acquisition of vital intelligence derived from continual aerial reconnaissance more dangerous. In particular the defencelessness of Allied reconnaissance types was exposed. The first German &quot;ace&quot; pilots, notably Max Immelmann, had begun their careers.

The number of actual Allied casualties involved was for various reasons very small compared with the intensive air fighting of 1917–18. The deployment of the Eindeckers was less than overwhelming: the new type was issued in ones and twos to existing reconnaissance squadrons, and it was to be nearly a year before the Germans were to follow the British in establishing specialist fighter squadrons. The Eindecker was also, in spite of its advanced armament, by no means an outstanding aircraft, being closely based on the pre-war Morane-Saulnier H, although it did feature a steel tubing fuselage framework (a characteristic of all Fokker wartime aircraft designs) instead of the wooden fuselage components of the French aircraft.

Nonetheless, the impact on morale of the fact that the Germans were effectively fighting back in the air created a major scandal in the British parliament and press. The ascendancy of the Eindecker also contributed to the surprise the Germans were able to achieve at the start of the Battle of Verdun because the French reconnaissance aircraft failed to provide their usual cover of the German positions.

Fortunately for the Allies, two new British fighters that were a match for the Fokker, the two-seat F.E.2b and the single-seat D.H.2, were already in production. These were both pushers, and could fire forwards without gun synchronisation. The F.E.2b reached the front in September 1915, and the D.H.2 in the following February. On the French front, the tiny Nieuport 11, a tractor biplane with a forward firing gun mounted on the top wing outside the arc of the propeller, also proved more than a match for the German fighter when it entered service in January 1916. With these new types the Allies re-established air superiority in time for the Battle of the Somme, and the &quot;Fokker Scourge&quot; was over.

The Fokker E.III, Airco DH-2 and Nieuport 11 were the very first in a long line of single seat fighter aircraft used by both sides during the war. Very quickly it became clear the primary role of fighters would be attacking enemy two-seaters, which were becoming increasingly important as sources of reconnaissance and artillery observation, while also escorting and defending friendly two-seaters from enemy fighters. Fighters were also used to attack enemy observation balloons, strafe enemy ground targets, and defend friendly airspace from enemy bombers.

Almost all the fighters in service with both sides, with the exception of the Fokkers&#x27; steel-tube fuselaged airframes, continued to use wood as the basic structural material, with fabric-covered wings relying on external wire bracing. However, the first practical all-metal aircraft was produced by Hugo Junkers, who also used a cantilever wing structure with a metal covering. The first flight tests of the initial flight demonstrator of this technology, the Junkers J 1 monoplane, took place at the end of 1915 heralding the future of aircraft structural design.

==1916: Verdun and the Somme==

Creating new units was easier than producing aircraft to equip them, and training pilots to man them. When the Battle of the Somme started in July 1916, most ordinary RFC squadrons were still equipped with planes that proved easy targets for the Fokker. New types such as the Sopwith 1½ Strutter had to be transferred from production intended for the RNAS. Even more seriously, replacement pilots were being sent to France with pitifully few flying hours.

Nonetheless, air superiority and an &quot;offensive&quot; strategy facilitated the greatly increased involvement of the RFC in the battle itself, in what was known at the time as &quot;trench strafing&quot; – in modern terms, close support. For the rest of the war, this became a regular routine, with both attacking and defending infantry in a land battle being constantly liable to attack by machine guns and light bombs from the air. At this time, counter fire from the ground was far less effective than it became later, when the necessary techniques of deflection shooting had been mastered.

The first step towards specialist fighter-only aviation units within the German military was the establishment of the so-called &quot;Kampfeinsitzer Kommando&quot; (single-seat battle unit, abbreviated as &quot;KEK&quot;) formations by Inspektor-Major Friedrich Stempel in February 1916. These were based around Eindeckers and other new fighter designs emerging, like the Pfalz E-series monoplanes, that were being detached from their former Feldflieger Abteilung units during the winter of 1915–16 and brought together in pairs and quartets at particularly strategic locations, as &quot;KEK&quot; units were formed at Habsheim, Vaux, Avillers, Jametz, and Cunel, as well as other strategic locations along the Western Front to act as &quot;Luftwachtdienst&quot; (aerial guard force) units, consisting only of fighters. In a pioneering move in March 1916, German master aerial tactician Oswald Boelcke came up with the idea of having &quot;forward observers&quot; located close to the front lines to spot Allied aircraft approaching the front, to avoid wear and tear on the trio of Fokker Eindecker scout aircraft he had based with his own &quot;KEK&quot; unit based at Sivry-sur-Meuse, just north of Verdun. By April 1916, the air superiority established by the Eindecker pilots and maintained by their use within the KEK formations had long evaporated as the Halberstadt D.II began to be phased in as Germany&#x27;s first biplane fighter design, with the first Fokker D-series biplane fighters joining the Halberstadts, and a target was set to establish 37 new squadrons in the next 12 months – entirely equipped with single seat fighters, and manned by specially selected and trained pilots, to counter the Allied fighter squadrons already experiencing considerable success, as operated by the Royal Flying Corps and the French &quot;Aéronautique Militaire&quot;. The small numbers of questionably built Fokker D.IIIs posted to the Front pioneered the mounting of twin lMG 08s before 1916&#x27;s end, as the building numbers of the similarly armed, and much more formidable new twin-gun Albatros D.Is were well on the way to establishing the German air superiority marking the first half of 1917.

Allied air superiority was maintained during the height of both battles, and the increased effectiveness of Allied air activity proved disturbing to the German Army&#x27;s top-level &quot;Oberste Heeresleitung&quot; command staff. A complete reorganisation of the &quot;Fliegertruppen des deutschen Kaiserreiches&quot; into what became officially known as the &quot;Luftstreitkräfte&quot; followed and had generally been completed by October 1916. This reorganisation eventually produced the German strategic bombing squadrons that were to produce such consternation in England in 1917 and 1918, and the specialist close support squadrons (&quot;Schlachtstaffeln&quot;) that gave the British infantry such trouble at Cambrai and during the German spring offensive of 1918. Its most famous and dramatic effect, however, involved the raising of specialist fighter squadrons or &quot;Jagdstaffeln&quot; – a full year after similar units had become part of the RFC and the French &quot;Aéronautique Militaire&quot;. Initially these units were equipped with the Halberstadt D.II (Germany&#x27;s first biplane fighter), the Fokker D.I and D.II, along with the last few surviving &quot;Eindecker&quot;s, all three biplane design types using a single lMG 08, before the Fokker D.III and Albatros D.I twin-gun types arrived at the Front.

==1917: Bloody April==


The first half of 1917 was a successful period for the &quot;jagdstaffeln&quot; and the much larger RFC suffered significantly higher casualties than their opponents. While new Allied fighters such as the Sopwith Pup, Sopwith Triplane, and SPAD S.VII were coming into service, at this stage their numbers were small, and suffered from inferior firepower: all three were armed with just a single synchronised Vickers machine gun. On the other hand, the &quot;jagdstaffeln&quot; were in the process of replacing their early motley array of equipment with Albatros D-series aircraft, armed with twin synchronised MG08s. The D.I and D.II of late 1916 were succeeded by the new Albatros D.III, which was, in spite of structural difficulties, &quot;the best fighting scout on the Western Front&quot; at the time. Meanwhile, most RFC two-seater squadrons still flew the BE.2e, a very minor improvement on the BE.2c, and still fundamentally unsuited to air-to-air combat.

This culminated in the rout of April 1917, known as &quot;Bloody April&quot;. The RFC suffered particularly severe losses, although Trenchard&#x27;s policy of &quot;offensive patrol&quot;, which placed most combat flying on the German side of the lines, was maintained.

During the last half of 1917, the British Sopwith Camel and S.E.5a and the French SPAD S.XIII, all fitted with two forward firing machine guns, became available in numbers. The ordinary two seater squadrons in the RFC received the R.E.8 or the F.K.8, not outstanding warplanes, but far less vulnerable than the BE.2e they replaced. The F.E.2d at last received a worthy replacement in the Bristol F.2b. On the other hand, the latest Albatros, the D.V, proved to be a disappointment, as was the Pfalz D.III. The exotic Fokker Dr.I was plagued, like the Albatros, with structural problems. By the end of the year the air superiority pendulum had swung once more in the Allies&#x27; favour.

==1918: The Spring Offensive==
The surrender of the Russians and the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk in March 1918, and the resulting release of troops from the Eastern Front gave the Germans a &quot;last chance&quot; of winning the war before the Americans could become effectively involved. This resulted in the last great German offensive of the war, the &quot;Spring Offensive&quot;, which opened on 21 March. The main attack fell on the British front on the assumption that defeat of the British army would result in the surrender of the mutiny-weakened French.
In the air, the battle was marked by the carefully coordinated use of the &quot;Schlachtstaffeln&quot; or &quot;battle flights&quot;, equipped with the light &quot;CL&quot; class two seaters built by the Halberstadt and Hannover firms, that had proved so effective in the German counter-attack in early October&#x27;s Battle of Cambrai. The new German fighter aircraft, notably the Fokker D.VII, that might have revived German air superiority in time for this battle had not however reached the &quot;Jagdstaffeln&quot; in sufficient numbers, despite its own premier on the Western Front in the mid-Spring of 1918. As with several offensives on both sides, thorough planning and preparation led to initial success, and in fact to deeper penetration than had been achieved by either side since 1914. Many British airfields had to be abandoned to the advancing Germans in a new war of movement. Losses of aircraft and their crew were very heavy on both sides – especially to light anti-aircraft fire. However, by the time of the death of Manfred von Richthofen, the famed Red Baron, on 21 April, the great offensive had largely stalled. The new German fighters had still not arrived, and the British still held general air superiority.

The month of April 1918 began with the consolidation of the separate British RFC and RNAS air services into the Royal Air Force, the first independent air arm not subordinate to its national army or navy. By the end of April, the new Fokker, Pfalz and Roland fighters had finally begun to replace the obsolescent equipment of the &quot;Jagdstaffeln&quot;, but this did not proceed with as much dispatch as it might have, due to increasing shortages of supplies on the side of the Central Powers, and many of the &quot;Jastas&quot; still flew Albatros D types at the time of the armistice. The rotary engined Fokker D.VIII and Siemens-Schuckert D.IV, as well as surviving Fokker Triplanes, suffered from poor reliability and shortened engine life due to the Voltol-based oil that was used to replace scarce castor oil – captured and salvaged Allied aircraft (especially Sopwith Camels) were scrounged, not only for engines and equipment, but even for their lubricants. Nonetheless, by September, casualties in the RFC had reached the highest level since &quot;Bloody April&quot; – and the Allies were maintaining air superiority by weight of numbers rather than technical superiority.

===Readying for battle===

1918, especially the second half of the year, also saw the United States increasingly involved with the allied aerial efforts. While American volunteers had been flying in Allied squadrons since the early years of the war, not until 1918 did all-American squadrons begin active operations. Technically America had fallen well behind the European powers in aviation, and no American designed types saw action, with the exception of the Curtiss flying boats. At first, the Americans were supplied with second-rate and obsolete aircraft, such as the Sopwith 1½ Strutter, Dorand AR and Sopwith Camel, and inexperienced American airmen stood little chance against their seasoned opponents.

General John J. Pershing assigned Major General Mason Patrick as Chief of the United States Army Air Service to remedy these issues in May 1918. As numbers grew and equipment improved with the introduction of the twin-gun Nieuport 28, and later, SPAD XIII as well as the S.E.5a into American service near the war&#x27;s end, the Americans came to hold their own in the air; although casualties were heavy, as indeed were those of the French and British, in the last desperate fighting of the war. One of the French twin-seat reconnaissance aircraft used by both the French and the USAAS, was the radial powered Salmson 2 A.2.

Leading up to the Battle of Saint-Mihiel, The US Air Service under Maj. Gen. Patrick oversaw the organization of 28 air squadrons for the battle, with the French, British, and Italians contributing additional units to bring the total force numbers to 701 pursuit planes, 366 observation planes, 323 day bombers, and 91 night bombers. The 1,481 total aircraft made it the largest air operation of the war.

==Impact==

By war&#x27;s end, the impact of aerial missions on the ground war was in retrospect mainly tactical; strategic bombing, in particular, was still very rudimentary indeed. This was partly due to its restricted funding and use, as it was, after all, a new technology. On the other hand, the artillery, which had perhaps the greatest effect of any military arm in this war, was in very large part as devastating as it was due to the availability of aerial photography and aerial &quot;spotting&quot; by balloon and aircraft. By 1917 weather bad enough to restrict flying was considered as good as &quot;putting the gunner&#x27;s eyes out&quot;.

Some, such as then-Brigadier General Billy Mitchell, commander of all American air combat units in France, claimed, &quot;[T]he only damage that has come to [Germany] has been through the air&quot;. Mitchell was famously controversial in his view that the future of war was not on the ground or at sea, but in the air.

During the course of the War, the exact number of German, British and French planes destroyed is unknown. However, the Luftstreitkräfte suffered enormous losses, so much so that seeing a German plane was considered rare towards the end of the war.

==Anti-aircraft weaponry==
Though aircraft still functioned as vehicles of observation, increasingly they were used as a weapon in themselves. Dog fights erupted in the skies over the front lines, and aircraft went down in flames. From this air-to-air combat, the need grew for better aircraft and gun armament. Aside from machine guns, air-to-air rockets were also used, such as the Le Prieur rocket against balloons and airships. Recoilless rifles and autocannons were also attempted, but they pushed early fighters to unsafe limits while bringing negligible returns, with the German Becker 20mm autocannon being fitted to a few twin-engined &quot;Luftstreitkräfte&quot; G-series medium bombers for offensive needs, and at least one late-war &quot;Kaiserliche Marine&quot; zeppelin for defense – the uniquely armed SPAD S.XII single-seat fighter carried one Vickers machine gun and a special, hand-operated semi-automatic 37mm gun firing through a hollow propeller shaft. Another innovation was air-to-air bombing. If a fighter had been fortunate enough to climb higher than an airship the Ranken dart was designed just for this opportunity.

This need for improvement was not limited to air-to-air combat. On the ground, methods developed before the war were being used to deter enemy aircraft from observation and bombing. Anti-aircraft artillery rounds were fired into the air and exploded into clouds of smoke and fragmentation, called archie by the British.

Anti-aircraft artillery defenses were increasingly used around observation balloons, which became frequent targets of enemy fighters equipped with special incendiary bullets. Because balloons were so flammable, due to the hydrogen used to inflate them, observers were given parachutes, enabling them to jump to safety. Ironically, only a few aircrew had this option, due in part to a mistaken belief they inhibited aggressiveness, and in part to their significant weight.

During a bombing raid over Kragujevac on 30 September 1915, private Radoje Ljutovac of the Serbian Army successfully shot down one of the three aircraft. Ljutovac used a slightly modified Turkish cannon captured some years previously. This was the first time that a military aeroplane was shot down with ground-to-air artillery fire, and thus a crucial moment in anti-aircraft warfare.

==Bombing and reconnaissance==

As the stalemate developed on the ground, with both sides unable to advance even a few hundred yards without a major battle and thousands of casualties, aircraft became greatly valued for their role gathering intelligence on enemy positions and bombing the enemy&#x27;s supplies behind the trench lines. Large aircraft with a pilot and an observer were used to scout enemy positions and bomb their supply bases. Because they were large and slow, these aircraft made easy targets for enemy fighter aircraft. As a result, both sides used fighter aircraft to both attack the enemy&#x27;s two-seat aircraft and protect their own while carrying out their missions.

While the two-seat bombers and reconnaissance aircraft were slow and vulnerable, they were not defenseless. Two-seaters had the advantage of both forward- and rearward-firing guns. Typically, the pilot controlled fixed guns behind the propeller, similar to guns in a fighter aircraft, while the observer controlled one with which he could cover the arc behind the aircraft. A tactic used by enemy fighter aircraft to avoid fire from the rear gunner was to attack from slightly below the rear of two-seaters, as the tail gunner was unable to fire below the aircraft. However, two-seaters could counter this tactic by going into a dive at high speeds. Pursuing a diving two-seater was hazardous for a fighter pilot, as it would place the fighter directly in the rear gunner&#x27;s line of fire; several high scoring aces of the war were shot down by &quot;lowly&quot; two-seaters, including Raoul Lufbery, Erwin Böhme, and Robert Little. Even Manfred von Richthofen, the highest scoring ace of WWI, was once wounded and forced to crash land from the bullets of a two-seater, though he did survive the encounter and continued flying after he recovered.

==Strategic bombing==
The first aerial bombardment of civilians occurred during World War I. In the opening weeks of the war, zeppelins bombed Liège, Antwerp, and Warsaw, and other cities, including Paris and Bucharest, were targeted, In January 1915 the Germans began a bombing campaign against England that was to last until 1918, initially using airships. There were 19 raids in 1915, in which 37 tons of bombs were dropped, killing 181 people and injuring 455. Raids continued in 1916. London was accidentally bombed in May, and in July, the Kaiser allowed directed raids against urban centres. There were 23 airship raids in 1916 in which 125 tons of ordnance were dropped, killing 293 people and injuring 691. Gradually British air defenses improved. In 1917 and 1918 there were only eleven Zeppelin raids against England, and the final raid occurred on 5 August 1918, resulting in the death of Peter Strasser, commander of the German Naval Airship Department. By the end of the war, 54 airship raids had been undertaken, in which 557 people were killed and 1,358 injured. Of the 80 airships used by the Germans in World War I, 34 were shot down and further 33 were destroyed by accidents. 389 crewmen died.

The Zeppelin raids were complemented by the Gotha G bombers from 1917, which were the first heavier than air bombers to be used for strategic bombing, and by a small force of five Zeppelin-Staaken R.VI &quot;giant&quot; four engined bombers from late September 1917 through to mid-May 1918. Twenty-four Gotha twin-engined bombers were shot down on the raids over England, with no losses for the Zeppelin-Staaken giants. Further 37 Gotha bombers crashed in accidents. They dropped 73 tons of bombs, killing 857 people and wounding 2058.

It has been argued that the raids were effective far beyond material damage in diverting and hampering wartime production, and diverting twelve squadrons and over 17,000 men to air defenses. Calculations performed on the number of dead to the weight of bombs dropped had a profound effect on attitudes of the British government and population in the interwar years, who believed that &quot;The bomber will always get through&quot;.

==Observation balloons==
Manned observation balloons floating high above the trenches were used as stationary reconnaissance points on the front lines, reporting enemy troop positions and directing artillery fire. Balloons commonly had a crew of two equipped with parachutes: upon an enemy air attack on the flammable balloon, the crew would parachute to safety. Recognized for their value as observer platforms, observation balloons were important targets of enemy aircraft. To defend against air attack, they were heavily protected by large concentrations of antiaircraft guns and patrolled by friendly aircraft. Blimps and balloons helped contribute to the stalemate of the trench warfare of World War I, and contributed to air-to-air combat for air superiority because of their significant reconnaissance value.

To encourage pilots to attack enemy balloons, both sides counted downing an enemy balloon as an &quot;air-to-air&quot; kill, with the same value as shooting down an enemy aircraft. Some pilots, known as balloon busters, became particularly distinguished by their prowess at shooting down enemy balloons. The premier balloon busting ace was Willy Coppens: 35 of his 37 victories were enemy balloons.

==Leading aces==
As pioneer aviators invented air-to-air combat, the contending sides developed various methods of tracking aerial casualties and victories. Aviators with five or more aerial victories confirmed by their parent air service were dubbed &quot;aces&quot;. Their numbers would burgeon, until by war&#x27;s end, there were over 1,800 aces.

The following aces scored the most victories for their respective air services.

<doc id="768604" wikidata="Q2667159" url="?curid=768604" title="Reflex syncope">
<text>Reflex syncope is a brief loss of consciousness due to a neurologically induced drop in blood pressure and/or a decrease in heart rate. Before an affected person passes out, there may be sweating, a decreased ability to see, or ringing in the ears. Occasionally, the person may twitch while unconscious. Complications of reflex syncope include injury due to a fall.
Reflex syncope is divided into three types: vasovagal, situational, and carotid sinus. Vasovagal syncope is typically triggered by seeing blood, pain, emotional stress, or prolonged standing. Situational syncope is often triggered by urination, swallowing, or coughing. Carotid sinus syncope is due to pressure on the carotid sinus in the neck. The underlying mechanism involves the nervous system slowing the heart rate and dilating blood vessels, resulting in low blood pressure and thus not enough blood flow to the brain. Diagnosis is based on the symptoms after ruling out other possible causes.
Recovery from a reflex syncope episode happens without specific treatment. Prevention of episodes involves avoiding a person&#x27;s triggers. Drinking sufficient fluids, salt, and exercise may also be useful. If this is insufficient for treating vasovagal syncope, medications such as midodrine or fludrocortisone may be tried. Occasionally, a cardiac pacemaker may be used as treatment. Reflex syncope affects at least 1 in 1,000 people per year. It is the most common type of syncope, making up more than 50% of all cases.

==Signs and symptoms==
Episodes of vasovagal syncope are typically recurrent and usually occur when the predisposed person is exposed to a specific trigger. Before losing consciousness, the individual frequently experiences early signs or symptoms such as lightheadedness, nausea, the feeling of being extremely hot or cold (accompanied by sweating), ringing in the ears, an uncomfortable feeling in the heart, fuzzy thoughts, confusion, a slight inability to speak or form words (sometimes combined with mild stuttering), weakness and visual disturbances such as lights seeming too bright, fuzzy or tunnel vision, black cloud-like spots in vision, and a feeling of nervousness can occur as well. The symptoms may become more intense over several seconds to several minutes before the loss of consciousness (if it is lost). Onset usually occurs when a person is sitting up or standing.

When people lose consciousness, they fall down (unless prevented from doing so) and, when in this position, effective blood flow to the brain is immediately restored, allowing the person to regain consciousness. If the person does not fall into a fully flat, supine position, and the head remains elevated above the trunk, a state similar to a seizure may result from the blood&#x27;s inability to return quickly to the brain, and the neurons in the body will fire off and generally cause muscles to twitch very slightly but mostly remain very tense.

The autonomic nervous system&#x27;s physiological state (see below) leading to loss of consciousness may persist for several minutes, so
* If patients try to sit or stand when they wake up, they may pass out again
* The person may be nauseated, pale, and sweaty for several minutes or hours

==Causes==
Reflex syncope occurs in response to a trigger due to dysfunction of the heart rate and blood pressure regulating mechanism. When heart rate slows or blood pressure drops, the resulting lack of blood to the brain causes fainting.

===Vasovagal===
Typical triggers include:
* Prolonged standing
* Emotional stress
* Pain
* The sight of blood
* Fear of needles
* Time varying magnetic field (i.e. transcranial magnetic stimulation)

===Situational===
* After or during urination (micturition syncope)
* Straining, such as to have a bowel movement
* Coughing
* Swallowing
* Lifting a heavy weight

===Carotid sinus===
Pressing upon a certain spot in the neck. This may happen when wearing a tight collar, shaving, or turning the head.

==Pathophysiology==
Regardless of the trigger, the mechanism of syncope is similar in the various vasovagal syncope syndromes. The nucleus tractus solitarii of the brainstem is activated directly or indirectly by the triggering stimulus, resulting in simultaneous enhancement of parasympathetic nervous system (vagal) tone and withdrawal of sympathetic nervous system tone.

This results in a spectrum of hemodynamic responses:
# On one end of the spectrum is the cardioinhibitory response, characterized by a drop in heart rate (negative chronotropic effect) and in contractility (negative inotropic effect) leading to a decrease in cardiac output that is significant enough to result in a loss of consciousness. It is thought that this response results primarily from enhancement in parasympathetic tone.
# On the other end of the spectrum is the vasodepressor response, caused by a drop in blood pressure (to as low as 80/20) without much change in heart rate. This phenomenon occurs due to dilation of the blood vessels, probably as a result of withdrawal of sympathetic nervous system tone.
# The majority of people with vasovagal syncope have a mixed response somewhere between these two ends of the spectrum.

One account for these physiological responses is the Bezold-Jarisch reflex.

Vasovagal syncope may be part of an evolved response, specifically, the fight-or-flight response.

==Diagnosis==
In addition to the mechanism described above, a number of other medical conditions may cause syncope. Making the correct diagnosis for loss of consciousness is difficult. The core of the diagnosis of vasovagal syncope rests upon a clear description of a typical pattern of triggers, symptoms, and time course.

It is pertinent to differentiate lightheadedness, seizures, vertigo, and low blood sugar as other causes.

In people with recurrent vasovagal syncope, diagnostic accuracy can often be improved with one of the following diagnostic tests:
* A tilt table test (results should be interpreted in the context of patients&#x27; clinical presentations and with an understanding of the sensitivity and specificity of the test)
* Implantation of an insertable loop recorder
* A Holter monitor or event monitor
* An echocardiogram
* An electrophysiology study

==Treatment==
Treatment for reflex syncope focuses on avoidance of triggers, restoring blood flow to the brain during an impending episode, and measures that interrupt or prevent the pathophysiologic mechanism described above.

===Lifestyle changes===
* The cornerstone of treatment is avoidance of triggers known to cause syncope in that person. However, research has shown that people show great reductions in vasovagal syncope through exposure-based exercises with therapists if the trigger is mental or emotional, e.g., sight of blood. However, if the trigger is a specific drug, then avoidance is the only treatment.
* A technique known as &quot;applied tension&quot; may be additionally useful in those who have syncope with exposure to blood. The technique is done by tightening the skeletal muscles for about 15 seconds when the exposure occurs and then slowing releasing them. This is then repeated every 30 seconds for a few minutes.
* Because vasovagal syncope causes a decrease in blood pressure, relaxing the entire body as a mode of avoidance is not favorable. A person can move or cross their legs and tighten leg muscles to keep blood pressure from dropping so significantly before an injection.
* Before known triggering events, the affected person may increase consumption of salt and fluids to increase blood volume. Sports drinks or drinks with electrolytes may be helpful.
* People should be educated on how to respond to further episodes of syncope, especially if they experience prodromal warning signs: they should lie down and raise their legs, or at least lower their head to increase blood flow to the brain. At the very least, upon the onset of initial symptoms the patient should try to relocate to a &#x27;safe&#x27;, perhaps cushioned, location in case of losing consciousness. Positioning themselves in a way where the impact from falling or collapsing would be minimized is ideal. The &#x27;safe&#x27; area should be within close proximity, since, time is of the essence and these symptoms usually climax to loss of consciousness within a matter of minutes. If the individual has lost consciousness, he or she should be laid down in the recovery position. Tight clothing should be loosened. If the inciting factor is known, it should be removed if possible (for instance, the cause of pain).
* Wearing graded compression stockings may be helpful.

===Medications===
* Certain medications may also be helpful:
** Beta blockers (β-adrenergic antagonists) were once the most common medication given; however, they have been shown to be ineffective in a variety of studies and are thus no longer prescribed. In addition, they may cause the syncope by lowering the blood pressure and heart rate.
** Medications which may be effective include: CNS stimulants fludrocortisone, midodrine, SSRIs such as paroxetine or sertraline, disopyramide, and, in health-care settings where a syncope is anticipated, atropine or epinephrine (adrenaline).
* For people with the cardioinhibitory form of vasovagal syncope, implantation of a permanent pacemaker may be beneficial or even curative.
Types of long-term therapy for vasovagal syncope include
* Preload agents
* Vasoconstrictors
* Anticholinergic agents
* Negative cardiac inotropes
* Central agents
* Mechanical device
* Discontinuation of medications known to lower blood pressure may be helpful, but stopping antihypertensive drugs can also be dangerous in some people. Taking antihypertensive drugs may worsen the syncope, as the hypertension may have been the body&#x27;s way to compensate for the low blood pressure.

==Prognosis==

Brief periods of unconsciousness usually cause no lasting harm to health. Reflex syncope can occur in otherwise healthy individuals, and has many possible causes, often trivial ones such as prolonged standing with the legs locked.

The main danger of vasovagal syncope (or dizzy spells from vertigo) is the risk of injury by falling while unconscious. Medication therapy could possibly prevent future vasovagal responses; however, for some individuals medication is ineffective and they will continue to have fainting episodes.

<text>Newborn screening (NBS) is a public health program of screening in infants shortly after birth for conditions that are treatable, but not clinically evident in the newborn period. The goal is to identify infants at risk for these conditions early enough to confirm the diagnosis and provide intervention that will alter the clinical course of the disease and prevent or ameliorate the clinical manifestations. NBS started with the discovery that the amino acid disorder phenylketonuria (PKU) could be treated by dietary adjustment, and that early intervention was required for the best outcome. Infants with PKU appear normal at birth, but are unable to metabolize the essential amino acid phenylalanine, resulting in irreversible intellectual disability. In the 1960s, Robert Guthrie developed a simple method using a bacterial inhibition assay that could detect high levels of phenylalanine in blood shortly after a baby was born. Guthrie also pioneered the collection of blood on filter paper which could be easily transported, recognizing the need for a simple system if the screening was going to be done on a large scale. Newborn screening around the world is still done using similar filter paper. NBS was first introduced as a public health program in the United States in the early 1960s, and has expanded to countries around the world.

Screening programs are often run by state or national governing bodies with the goal of screening all infants born in the jurisdiction for a defined panel of treatable disorders. The number of diseases screened for is set by each jurisdiction, and can vary greatly. Most NBS tests are done by measuring metabolites or enzyme activity in whole blood samples collected on filter paper. Bedside tests for hearing loss using automated auditory brainstem response and congenital heart defects using pulse oximetry are included in some NBS programs. Infants who screen positive undergo further testing to determine if they are truly affected with a disease or if the test result was a false positive. Follow-up testing is typically coordinated between geneticists and the infant&#x27;s pediatrician or primary care physician.

==History==
Robert Guthrie is given much of the credit for pioneering the earliest screening for phenylketonuria in the late 1960s using a bacterial inhibition assay (BIA) to measure phenylalanine levels in blood samples obtained by pricking a newborn baby&#x27;s heel on the second day of life on filter paper. Congenital hypothyroidism was the second disease widely added in the 1970s. Guthrie and colleagues also developed bacterial inhibition assays for the detection of maple syrup urine disease and classic galactosemia. The development of tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) screening in the early 1990s led to a large expansion of potentially detectable congenital metabolic diseases that can be identified by characteristic patterns of amino acids and acylcarnitines. In many regions, Guthrie&#x27;s BIA has been replaced by MS/MS profiles, however the filter paper he developed is still used worldwide, and has allowed for the screening of millions of infants around the world each year.

In the United States, the American College of Medical Genetics recommended a uniform panel of diseases that all infants born in every state should be screened for. They also developed an evidence-based review process for the addition of conditions in the future. The implementation of this panel across the United States meant all babies born would be screened for the same number of conditions. This recommendation is not binding for individual states, and some states may screen for disorders that are not included on this list of recommended disorders. Prior to this, babies born in different states had received different levels of screening. On April 24, 2008, President George W. Bush signed into law the Newborn Screening Saves Lives Act of 2007. This act was enacted to increase awareness among parents, health professionals, and the public on testing newborns to identify certain disorders. It also sought to improve, expand, and enhance current newborn screening programs at the state level.

==Inclusion of disorders==
Newborn screening programs initially used screening criteria based largely on criteria established by JMG Wilson and F. Jungner in 1968. Although not specifically about newborn population screening programs, their publication, &quot;Principles and practice of screening for disease&quot; proposed ten criteria that screening programs should meet before being used as a public health measure. Newborn screening programs are administered in each jurisdiction, with additions and removals from the panel typically reviewed by a panel of experts. The four criteria from the publication that were relied upon when making decisions for early newborn screening programs were: 
# having an acceptable treatment protocol in place that changes the outcome for patients diagnosed early with the disease
# an understanding of the condition&#x27;s natural history
# an understanding about who will be treated as a patient
# a screening test that is reliable for both affected and unaffected patients and is acceptable to the public

As diagnostic techniques have progressed, debates have arisen as to how screening programs should adapt. Tandem mass spectrometry has greatly expanded the potential number of diseases that can be detected, even without satisfying all of the other criteria used for making screening decisions. Duchenne muscular dystrophy is a disease that has been added to screening programs in several jurisdictions around the world, despite the lack of evidence as to whether early detection improves the clinical outcome for a patient.

==Targeted disorders==
Newborn screening is intended as a public health program to identify infants with treatable conditions before they present clinically, or suffer irreversible damage. Phenylketonuria (PKU) was the first disorder targeted for newborn screening, being implemented in a small number of hospitals and quickly expanding across the United States and the rest of the world. After the success of newborn screening for PKU (39 infants were identified and treated in the first two years of screening, with no false negative results), Guthrie and others looked for other disorders that could be identified and treated in infants, eventually developing bacterial inhibition assays to identify classic galactosemia and maple syrup urine disease.

Newborn screening has expanded since the introduction of PKU testing in the 1960s, but can vary greatly between countries. In 2011, the United States screened for 54 conditions, Germany for 12, the United Kingdom for 2 (PKU and medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MCADD)), while France and Hong Kong only screened for one condition (PKU and congenital hypothyroidism, respectively). The conditions included in newborn screening programs around the world vary greatly, based on the legal requirements for screening programs, prevalence of certain diseases within a population, political pressure, and the availability of resources for both testing and follow-up of identified patients.

===Congenital Disorders of Amino Acid Metabolism===
Newborn screening originated with an amino acid disorder, phenylketonuria (PKU), which can be easily treated by dietary modifications, but causes severe Intellectual disability if not identified and treated early. Robert Guthrie introduced the newborn screening test for PKU in the early 1960s. With the knowledge that PKU could be detected before symptoms were evident, and treatment initiated, screening was quickly adopted around the world. Ireland was the first country in the world to introduce a nationwide screening programme in February 1966, Austria started screening the same year and England in 1968.

Other congenital disorders of amino acid metabolism tested for on the newborn screening include Tyrosinemia and Maple Syrup Urine Disorder.

===Fatty acid oxidation disorders===
With the advent of tandem mass spectrometry as a screening tool, several fatty acid oxidation disorders were targeted for inclusion in newborn screening programs. Medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MCADD), which had been implicated in several cases of sudden infant death syndrome was one of the first conditions targeted for inclusion. MCADD was the first condition added when the United Kingdom expanded their screening program from PKU only. Population based studies in Germany, the United States and Australia put the combined incidence of fatty acid oxidation disorders at 1:9300 among Caucasians. The United States screens for all known fatty acid oxidation disorders, either as primary or secondary targets, while other countries screen for a subset of these.

The introduction of screening for fatty acid oxidation disorders has been shown to have reduced morbidity and mortality associated with the conditions, particularly MCADD. An Australian study found a 74% reduction in episodes of severe metabolic decompensation or death among individuals identified by newborn screening as having MCADD versus those who presented clinically prior to screening. Studies in the Netherlands and United Kingdom found improvements in outcome at a reduced cost when infants were identified before presenting clinically.

Newborn screening programs have also expanded the information base available about some rare conditions. Prior to its inclusion in newborn screening, short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (SCADD) was thought to be life-threatening. Most patients identified via newborn screening as having this enzyme deficiency were asymptomatic, to the extent that SCADD was removed from screening panels in a number of regions. Without the cohort of patients identified by newborn screening, this clinical phenotype would likely not have been identified.

===Endocrinopathies===
The most commonly included disorders of the endocrine system are congenital hypothyroidism (CH) and congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). Testing for both disorders can be done using blood samples collected on the standard newborn screening card. Screening for CH is done by measuring thyroxin (T4), thyrotropin (TSH) or a combination of both analytes. Elevated 17α-hydroxyprogesterone (17α-OHP) is the primary marker used when screening for CAH, most commonly done using enzyme-linked immunosorbant assays, with many programs using a second tier tandem mass spectrometry test to reduce the number of false positive results. Careful analysis of screening results for CAH may also identify cases of congenital adrenal hypoplasia, which presents with extremely low levels of 17α-OHP. When the immunoassay method is utilized as a screening method for quantifying 17α-OHP in dried blood spots, it exhibits a significant rate of false positive results. As per the clinical practice guideline issued by the Endocrine Society in 2018, employing LC-MS/MS to measure 17α-OHP and other adrenal steroid hormones (such as 21-deoxycortisol and androstenedione) is recommended as a supplementary screening approach to enhance the accuracy of positive predictions.

CH was added to many newborn screening programs in the 1970s, often as the second condition included after PKU. The most common cause of CH is dysgenesis of the thyroid gland After many years of newborn screening, the incidence of CH worldwide had been estimated at 1:3600 births, with no obvious increases in specific ethnic groups. Recent data from certain regions have shown an increase, with New York reporting an incidence of 1:1700. Reasons for the apparent increase in incidence have been studied, but no explanation has been found.

Classic CAH, the disorder targeted by newborn screening programs, is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme steroid 21-hydroxylase and comes in two forms – simple virilizing and a salt-wasting form. The incidence of CAH can vary greatly between populations. The highest reported incidence rates are among the Yupic Eskimos of Alaska (1:280) and on the French island of Réunion (1:2100).

===Hemoglobinopathies===

Any condition that results in the production of abnormal hemoglobin is included under the broad category of hemoglobinopathies. Worldwide, it is estimated that 7% of the population may carry a hemoglobinopathy with clinical significance. The most well known condition in this group is sickle cell disease. Newborn screening for a large number of hemoglobinopathies is done by detecting abnormal patterns using isoelectric focusing, which can detect many different types of abnormal hemoglobins. In the United States, newborn screening for sickle cell disease was recommended for all infants in 1987, however it was not implemented in all 50 states until 2006.

Early identification of individuals with sickle cell disease and other hemoglobinopathies allows treatment to be initiated in a timely fashion. Penicillin has been used in children with sickle cell disease, and blood transfusions are used for patients identified with severe thalassemia.

===Organic acidemias===
Most jurisdictions did not start screening for any of the organic acidemias before tandem mass spectrometry significantly expanded the list of disorders detectable by newborn screening. Quebec has run a voluntary second-tier screening program since 1971 using urine samples collected at three weeks of age to screen for an expanded list of organic acidemias using a thin layer chromatography method. Newborn screening using tandem mass spectrometry can detect several organic acidemias, including propionic acidemia, methylmalonic acidemia and isovaleric acidemia.

===Cystic fibrosis===
Cystic fibrosis (CF) was first added to newborn screening programs in New Zealand and regions of Australia in 1981, by measuring immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT) in dried blood spots. After the &quot;CFTR&quot; gene was identified, Australia introduced a two tier testing program to reduce the number of false positives. Samples with an elevated IRT value were then analyzed with molecular methods to identify the presence of disease causing mutations before being reported back to parents and health care providers. CF is included in the core panel of conditions recommended for inclusion in all 50 states, Texas was the last state to implement their screening program for CF in 2010. Alberta was the first Canadian province to implement CF screening in 2007. Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and Prince Edward Island do not include CF in their screening programs. The United Kingdom as well as many European Union countries screen for CF as well. Switzerland is one of the latest countries to add CF to their newborn screening menu, doing so in January 2011.

===Urea cycle disorders===
Disorders of the distal urea cycle, such as citrullinemia, argininosuccinic aciduria and argininemia are included in newborn screening programs in many jurisdictions that using tandem mass spectrometry to identify key amino acids. Proximal urea cycle defects, such as ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency and carbamoyl phosphate synthetase deficiency are not included in newborn screening panels because they are not reliably detected using current technology, and also because severely affected infants will present with clinical symptoms before newborn screening results are available. Some regions claim to screen for HHH syndrome (hyperammonemia, hyperornithinemia, homocitrullinuria) based on the detection of elevated ornithine levels in the newborn screening dried blood spot, but other sources have shown that affected individuals do not have elevated ornithine at birth.

===Lysosomal storage disorders===
Lysosomal storage disorders are not included in newborn screening programs with high frequency. As a group, they are heterogenous, with screening only being feasible for a small fraction of the approximately 40 identified disorders. The arguments for their inclusion in newborn screening programs center around the advantage of early treatment (when treatment is available), avoiding a diagnostic odyssey for families and providing information for family planning to couples who have an affected child. The arguments against including these disorders, as a group or individually center around the difficulties with reliably identifying individuals who will be affected with a severe form of the disorder, the relatively unproven nature of the treatment methods, and the high cost / high risk associated with some treatment options.

New York State started a pilot study to screen for Krabbe disease in 2006, largely due to the efforts of Jim Kelly, whose son, Hunter, was affected with the disease. A pilot screening program for four lysosomal storage diseases (Gaucher disease, Pompe disease, Fabry disease and Niemann-Pick disease was undertaken using anonymised dried blood spots was completed in Austria in 2010. Their data showed an increased incidence from what was expected in the population, and also a number of late onset forms of disease, which are not typically the target for newborn screening programs.

===Hearing loss===
Undiagnosed hearing loss in a child can have serious effects on many developmental areas, including language, social interactions, emotions, cognitive ability, academic performance and vocational skills, any combination of which can have negative impacts on the quality of life. The serious impacts of a late diagnosis, combined with the high incidence (estimated at 1 - 3 per 1000 live births, and as high as 4% for neonatal intensive care unit patients) have been the driving forces behind screening programs designed to identify infants with hearing loss as early as possible. Early identification allows these patients and their families to access the necessary resources to help them maximize their developmental outcomes.

Newborn hearing testing is done at the bedside using transiently evoked otoacoustic emissions, automated auditory brainstem responses, or a combination of both techniques. Hearing screening programs have found the initial testing to cost between $10.20 and $23.37 per baby, depending on the technology used. As these are screening tests only, false positive results will occur. False positive results could be due to user error, a fussy baby, environmental noise in the testing room, or fluid or congestion in the outer/middle ear of the baby. A review of hearing screening programs found varied initial referral rates (screen positive results) from 0.6% to 16.7%. The highest overall incidence of hearing loss detection was 0.517%. A significant proportion of screen positive infants were lost to follow-up before a diagnosis could be confirmed or ruled out in all screening programs.

===Congenital heart defects===
In some cases, critical congenital heart defects (CCHD) are not identified by prenatal ultrasound or postnatal physical examination. Pulse oximetry has been recently added as a bedside screening test for CCHD at 24 to 48 hours after birth. However, not all heart problems can be detected by this method, which relies only on blood oxygen levels.

When a baby tests positive, urgent subsequent examination, such as echocardiography, is undergone to determine the cause of low oxygen levels. Babies diagnosed with CCHD are then seen by cardiologists.

===Severe combined immunodeficiency===
Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) caused by T-cell deficiency is a disorder that was recently added to newborn screening programs in some regions of the United States. Wisconsin was the first state to add SCID to their mandatory screening panel in 2008, and it was recommended for inclusion in all states&#x27; panels in 2010. Since December 2018 all US states perform SCID screening. As the first country in Europe, Norway started nationwide SCID screening January 2018. Identification of infants with SCID is done by detecting T-cell receptor excision circles (TRECs) using real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). TRECs are decreased in infants affected with SCID.

SCID has not been added to newborn screening in a wide scale for several reasons. It requires technology that is not currently used in most newborn screening labs, as PCR is not used for any other assays included in screening programs. Follow-up and treatment of affected infants also requires skilled immunologists, which may not be available in all regions. Treatment for SCID is a stem cell transplant, which cannot be done in all centers.

===Other conditions===
Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked disorder caused by defective production of dystrophin. Many jurisdictions around the world have screened for, or attempted to screen for DMD using elevated levels of creatine kinase measured in dried blood spots. Because universal newborn screening for DMD has not been undertaken, affected individuals often have a significant delay in diagnosis. As treatment options for DMD become more and more effective, interest in adding a newborn screening test increases. At various times since 1978, DMD has been included (often as a pilot study on a small subset of the population) in newborn screening programs in Edinburgh, Germany, Canada, France, Wales, Cyprus, Belgium and the United States. In 2012, Belgium was the only country that continued to screen for DMD using creatine kinase levels.

As treatments improve, newborn screening becomes a possibility for disorders that could benefit from early intervention, but none was previously available. Adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD), a peroxisomal disease that has a variable clinical presentation is one of the disorders that has become a target for those seeking to identify patients early. ALD can present in several different forms, some of which do not present until adulthood, making it a difficult choice for countries to add to screening programs. The most successful treatment option is a stem cell transplant, a procedure that carries a significant risk.

==Techniques==

===Sample collection===
Newborn screening tests are most commonly done from whole blood samples collected on specially designed filter paper, originally designed by Robert Guthrie. The filter paper is often attached to a form containing required information about the infant and parents. This includes date and time of birth, date and time of sample collection, the infant&#x27;s weight and gestational age. The form will also have information about whether the baby has had a blood transfusion and any additional nutrition the baby may have received (total parenteral nutrition). Most newborn screening cards also include contact information for the infant&#x27;s physician in cases where follow up screening or treatment is needed. The Canadian province of Quebec performs newborn screening on whole blood samples collected as in most other jurisdictions, and also runs a voluntary urine screening program where parents collect a sample at 21 days of age and submit it to a provincial laboratory for an additional panel of conditions.

Newborn screening samples are collected from the infant between 24 hours and 7 days after birth, and it is recommended that the infant has fed at least once. Individual jurisdictions will often have more specific requirements, with some states accepting samples collected at 12 hours, and others recommending to wait until 48 hours of life or later. Each laboratory will have its own criteria on when a sample is acceptable, or if another would need to be collected. Samples can be collected at the hospital, or by midwives. Samples are transported daily to the laboratory responsible for testing. In the United States and Canada, newborn screening is mandatory, with an option for parents to opt out of the screening in writing if they desire. In many regions, NBS is mandatory, with an option for parents to opt out in writing if they choose not to have their infant screened. In most of Europe, newborn screening is done with the consent of the parents. Proponents of mandatory screening claim that the test is for the benefit of the child, and that parents should not be able to opt out on their behalf. In regions that favour informed consent for the procedure, they report no increase in costs, no decrease in the number of children screened and no cases of included diseases in children who did not undergo screening.

===Laboratory testing===
Because newborn screening programs test for a number of conditions, a number of laboratorial methodologies are used, as well as bedside testing for hearing loss using evoked auditory potentials and congenital heart defects using pulse oximetry. 
In the early 1960s Newborn screening started out using simple bacterial inhibition assays to screen for a single disorder, starting with phenylketonuria. With this testing methodology, newborn screening required one test to detect one condition. As mass spectrometry became more widely available, the technology allowed rapid determination of a number of acylcarnitines and amino acids from a single dried blood spot. This increased the number of conditions that could be detected by newborn screening. Enzyme assays are used to screen for galactosemia and biotinidase deficiency. Immunoassays measure thyroid hormones for the diagnosis of congenital hypothyroidism and 17α-hydroxyprogesterone for the diagnosis of congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Molecular techniques are used for the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis and severe combined immunodeficiency.

As of 2023, numerous initiatives using next generation sequencing (NGS) have been announced worldwide including the Genomic Uniform-screening Against Rare Diseases in All Newborns (GUARDIAN study), BeginNGS and Early Check in the USA, BabyScreen+ in Australia, Generation Study by Genomics England, and Screen4Care, Baby Detect in Belgium and PERIGENOMED in France. In a 2023 survey of 14 European newborn screening programs, there was one pan-European research study with 2 pilot trials planned in Germany (NEW_LIVES) and Italy, the others included three initiatives in Italy, three in the Netherlands, two in Spain, one in Belgium, one in England, one in Germany, one in Greece and one in France. Of the 14 initiatives, 11 selected a single NGS approach for their studies: 6 initiatives planned to use only whole genome sequencing (WGS) as a first-tier test for NBS, including one also testing parents using whole exome sequencing (WES) to facilitate filtering variants, 3 initiatives use classical NGS gene panels, 2 initiatives will be using WES and 2 initiatives will use a mixed approach: one comparing WES and Whole genome sequencing (WGS) and one comparing WES, WGS, and classical NGS. gene panels.

===Reporting results===
The goal is to report the results within a short period of time. If screens are normal, a paper report is sent to the submitting hospital and parents rarely hear about it. If an abnormality is detected, employees of the agency, usually nurses, begin to try to reach the physician, hospital, and/or nursery by telephone. They are persistent until they can arrange an evaluation of the infant by an appropriate specialist physician (depending on the disease). The specialist will attempt to confirm the diagnosis by repeating the tests by a different method or laboratory, or by performing other corroboratory or disproving tests. The confirmatory test varies depending on the positive results on the initial screen. Confirmatory testing can include analyte specific assays to confirm any elevations detected, functional studies to determine enzyme activity, and genetic testing to identify disease-causing mutations. In some cases, a positive newborn screen can also trigger testing on other family members, such as siblings who did not undergo newborn screening for the same condition or the baby&#x27;s mother, as some maternal conditions can be identified through results on the baby&#x27;s newborn screen. Depending on the likelihood of the diagnosis and the risk of delay, the specialist will initiate treatment and provide information to the family. Performance of the program is reviewed regularly and strenuous efforts are made to maintain a system that catches every infant with these diagnoses. Guidelines for newborn screening and follow up have been published by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Medical Genetics.

==Laboratory performance==
Newborn screening programs participate in quality control programs as in any other laboratory, with some notable exceptions. Much of the success of newborn screening programs is dependent on the filter paper used for the collection of the samples. Initial studies using Robert Guthrie&#x27;s test for PKU reported high false positive rates that were attributed to a poorly selected type of filter paper. This source of variation has been eliminated in most newborn screening programs through standardization of approved sources of filter paper for use in newborn screening programs. In most regions, the newborn screening card (which contains demographic information as well as attached filter paper for blood collection) is supplied by the organization carrying out the testing, to remove variations from this source.

==Society and culture==

===Controversy===
Newborn screening tests have become a subject of political controversy in the last decade. Lawsuits, media attention, and advocacy groups have surfaced a number of different, and possibly countervailing, positions on the use of screening tests. Some have asked for government mandates to widen the extent of the screening to find detectable and treatable birth defects. Others have opposed mandatory screening concerned that effective follow-up and treatment may not be available, or that false positive screening tests may cause harm to infants and their families. Others have learned that government agencies were often secretly storing the results in databases for future genetic research, often without consent of the parents nor limits on how the data could be used in the future . In the UK a campaign called the &quot;Newborn Screening Collaborative,&quot; 17 small rare disease organisations including &quot;Genetic Alliance UK,&quot; have joined together to raise awareness surrounding this issue and promote the positives of early diagnosis.

==== Increasing mandatory tests in California ====
Many rare diseases have not historically been tested for or testing that has been available has not been mandatory. One such disease is glutaric acidemia type I, a neurometabolic disease present in approximately 1 out of every 100,000 live births. A short-term California testing pilot project in 2003 and 2004 demonstrated the cost of forgoing rare disease testing on newborns. While both Zachary Wyvill and Zachary Black were both born with the same disease during the pilot program, Wyvill&#x27;s birth hospital tested only for four state-mandated diseases while Black was born at a hospital participating in the pilot program. Wyvill&#x27;s disease went undetected for over six months during which irreversible damage occurred but Black&#x27;s disease was treated with diet and vitamin supplements. Both sets of parents became advocates for expanded neonatal testing and testified in favor of expanding tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) testing of newborns for rare diseases. By August, 2004, the California state budget law had passed requiring the use of tandem mass spectroscopy to test for more than 30 genetic illnesses and provided funding. California now mandates newborn screening for all infants and tests for 80 congenital and genetic disorders.

==== Government budgetary limitations ====
Instituting MS/MS screening often requires a sizable up front expenditure. When states choose to run their own programs the initial costs for equipment, training and new staff can be significant. Moreover, MS/MS gives only the screening result and not the confirmatory result. The same has to be further done by higher technologies or procedure like GC/MS, Enzyme Assays or DNA Tests. This in effect adds more cost burden and makes physicians lose precious time. To avoid at least a portion of the up front costs, some states such as Mississippi have chosen to contract with private labs for expanded screening. Others have chosen to form Regional Partnerships sharing both costs and resources.

But for many states, screening has become an integrated part of the department of health which can not or will not be easily replaced. Thus the initial expenditures can be difficult for states with tight budgets to justify. Screening fees have also increased in recent years as health care costs rise and as more states add MS/MS screening to their programs. (See Report of Summation of Fees Charged for Newborn Screening, 2001–2005) Dollars spent for these programs may reduce resources available to other potentially lifesaving programs. It was recommended in 2006 that one disorder, Short Chain Acyl-coenzyme A Dehydrogenase Deficiency, or SCAD, be eliminated from screening programs, due to a &quot;spurious association between SCAD and symptoms. However, other studies suggested that perhaps expanded screening is cost effective (see ACMG report page 94-95 and articles published in &quot;Pediatrics&quot;&#x27;. Advocates are quick to point out studies such as these when trying to convince state legislatures to mandate expanded screening.

==== Decreasing mandatory tests ====
Expanded newborn screening is also opposed by among some health care providers, who are concerned that effective follow-up and treatment may not be available, that false positive screening tests may cause harm, and issues of informed consent. A recent study by Genetic Alliance and partners suggests that communication between health care providers and parents may be key in minimizing the potential harm when a false positive test occurs. The results from this study also reveal that parents found newborn screening to be a beneficial and necessary tool to prevent treatable diseases. To address the false positive issue, researchers from the University of Maryland, Baltimore and Genetic Alliance established a check-list to assist health care providers communicate with parents about a screen-positive result.

==== Secret genetic research ====
Controversy has also erupted in some countries over collection and storage of blood or DNA samples by government agencies during the routine newborn blood screen.

In the United States, it was revealed that Texas had collected and stored blood and DNA samples on millions of newborns without the parents&#x27; knowledge or consent. These samples were then used by the state for genetic experiments and to set up a database to catalog all of the samples/newborns. , samples obtained without parents&#x27; consent between 2002 and 2009 were slated to be destroyed following the settlement of &quot;a lawsuit filed by parents against the Texas Department of Health Services and Texas A&amp;M; for secretly storing and doing research on newborn blood samples.&quot;

A similar legal case was filed against the State of Minnesota. Over 1 million newborn bloodspot samples were destroyed in 2011 &quot;when the state&#x27;s Supreme Court found that storage and use of blood spots beyond newborn screening panels was in violation of the state&#x27;s genetic privacy laws.&quot;. Nearly was required to be paid by the state for the attorney&#x27;s fees of the 21 families who advanced the lawsuit. An advocacy group that has taken a position against research on newborn blood screening data without parental consent is the Citizens&#x27; Council for Health Freedom, who take the position that newborn health screening for &quot;a specific set of newborn genetic conditions&quot; is a very different matter than storing the data or those DNA samples indefinitely to &quot;use them for genetic research without parental knowledge or consent.&quot;

=== Bioethics ===
As additional tests are discussed for addition to the panels, issues arise. Many question whether the expanded testing still falls under the requirements necessary to justify the additional tests. Many of the new diseases being tested for are rare and have no known treatment, while some of the diseases need not be treated until later in life. This raises more issues, such as: if there is no available treatment for the disease should we test for it at all? And if we do, what do we tell the families of those with children bearing one of the untreatable diseases? Studies show that the rarer the disease is and the more diseases being tested for, the more likely the tests are to produce false-positives. This is an issue because the newborn period is a crucial time for the parents to bond with the child, and it has been noted that ten percent of parents whose children were diagnosed with a false-positive still worried that their child was fragile and/or sickly even though they were not, potentially preventing the parent-child bond forming as it would have otherwise. As a result, some parents may begin to opt out of having their newborns screened. Many parents are also concerned about what happens with their infant&#x27;s blood samples after screening. The samples were originally taken to test for preventable diseases, but with the advance in genomic sequencing technologies many samples are being kept for DNA identification and research, increasing the possibility that more children will be opted out of newborn screening from parents who see the kept samples as a form of research done on their child.

<text>The rock partridge or common rock partridge (Alectoris graeca) is a gamebird in the pheasant family, Phasianidae, of the order Galliformes (gallinaceous birds). It is native to southern Europe, and is closely related and very similar to its eastern equivalent, the chukar partridge, &quot;A. chukar&quot;.

==Habitat==
It is a resident breeder in dry, open and often hilly country.

==Breeding==
It nests in a scantily lined ground scrape laying 5–21 eggs.

==Diet==
The rock partridge takes a wide variety of seeds and some insect food.

==Description==
The rock partridge is a rotund bird, with a light brown back, grey breast and buff belly. The face is white with a black gorget. It has rufous-streaked flanks and red legs. When disturbed, it prefers to run rather than fly, but if necessary it flies a short distance on rounded wings. It is very similar to the chukar partridge, but is greyer on the back and has a white, not yellowish foreneck. The sharply defined gorget distinguishes this species from red-legged partridge. The song is a noisy &quot;ga-ga-ga-ga-chakera- chakera- chakera&quot;.

Some confusion exists in the naming of this species because the name of the species called stone partridge in English translates literally from other languages into English as &quot;rock partridge&quot;. For instance, in Dutch the species is &quot;rotspatrijs&quot;, in German – &quot;Felsenhenne&quot;, in French – &quot;poulette de roche&quot; – all literal translations of &quot;rock partridge&quot;. The confusion is further compounded as in some languages, &quot;Alectoris&quot; species are known by names that literally translate as stone partridge. In Dutch, &quot;steenpatrijs&quot;, in German &quot;Steinhuhn&quot;; red-legged partridge (&quot;A. rufa&quot;) being &quot;rode steenpatrijs&quot; in Dutch. Further complication arises as, particularly within the US, the name &quot;rock partridge&quot; has been used for a variety of &quot;Alectoris&quot; species and hybrids. The international bird trade, for sport, aviaries&#x27; and meat, has led to misapplication of various of these common and scientific names.

==Conservation==
This species is declining in parts of its range due to habitat loss and over-hunting. While populations are usually stable, the status of the Sicilian population may be more precarious, and certainly deserves attention (Randi 2006).

==Taxonomy==
This species is closely related to the chukar, Przevalski&#x27;s, and Philby&#x27;s partridges, forming a superspecies. The Western Mediterranean red-legged and Barbary partridges with their spotted neck collar are slightly more distant relatives. Nonetheless, although this species&#x27; range does not naturally overlap with that of its relatives, they co-occur where they have been introduced as gamebirds, for example in North America, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, and Russia, and in southeastern France where red-legged partridges have been released. In these areas, hybrids between this species, the chukar, and the red-legged partridge are usually found.(McGowan 1994, &quot;see also&quot; Randi 2006)

The rock partridge has four recognized subspecies:

* &quot;A. g. graeca&quot; - Serbia and Albania to Greece and Bulgaria
* &quot;A. g. orlandoi&quot; - Italy
* &quot;A. g. saxatilis&quot; – Alps from France to western Croatia
* &quot;A. g. whitakeri&quot; ( – Sicily
* &quot;A. g. martelensis&quot; – paleosubspecies, only known from fossils

The proposed subspecies from the Apennines, &quot;A. g. orlandoi&quot; , is of doubtful validity. It is usually included in &quot;saxatilis&quot;, but apparently mostly derives from Albanian &quot;A. g. graeca&quot;. These probably crossed the Adriatic via a land-bridge during the last ice age, to become isolated only with the sea levels rising at the beginning of the Holocene c.12.000–10.000 years ago, with Alpine birds much less contributing to the Apennines population (Randi 2006).

Apennine birds are not consistently recognizable by external morphology, and are only weakly differentiated with regards to mtDNA D-loop and hypervariable control region sequences and microsatellite genotyping. As they nonetheless constitute a discrete subpopulation evolving towards subspecies status, their population numbers could arguably deserve monitoring (Randi 2006).

<text>Sunwapta Peak is a peak in the Sunwapta River valley of Jasper National Park, just north of the Columbia Icefield in Alberta, Canada. The peak was named in 1892 after the Stoney language word meaning &quot;turbulent river&quot;. The mountain can be seen from the Icefields Parkway (Highway 93).

== Routes ==

The normal climbing route (an easy scramble) is via the southwest slopes, requiring an elevation gain of to the summit from the trail head beside the Icefields Parkway.

==Geology==

Sunwapta Peak is composed of sedimentary rock laid down from the Precambrian to Jurassic periods that was pushed east and over the top of younger rock during the Laramide orogeny.

==Climate==

Based on the Köppen climate classification, Sunwapta Peak is in a subarctic climate zone with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. Temperatures can drop below −20 °C with wind chill factors below −30 °C. Precipitation runoff from Sunwapta Peak drains into the Sunwapta River which is a tributary of the Athabasca River.

<doc id="768632" wikidata="Q6843071" url="?curid=768632" title="Midtown Atlanta">
<text>Midtown Atlanta, or Midtown for short, is a high-density commercial and residential neighborhood of Atlanta, Georgia. The exact geographical extent of the area is ill-defined due to differing definitions used by the city, residents, and local business groups. However, the commercial core of the area is anchored by a series of high-rise office buildings, condominiums, hotels, and high-end retail along Peachtree Street between North Avenue and 17th Street. Midtown, situated between Downtown to the south and Buckhead to the north, is the second-largest business district in Metro Atlanta. In 2011, Midtown had a resident population of 41,681 and a business population of 81,418.

Midtown has the highest density of art and cultural institutions in the Southeast, notably including the Fox Theatre, Woodruff Arts Center, the High Museum of Art, the Center for Puppetry Arts, the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra, and the Museum of Design Atlanta. Midtown attracts more than six million visitors annually, mostly in connection with large annual events such as the Atlanta Dogwood Festival, Atlanta Pride, Music Midtown, and Georgia Tech athletic games. Since the 1990s, Midtown has also been a primary area for high-density development due to the area&#x27;s mass transit options, urban street grid, and desirability.

==Geography and nomenclature==
The definition and meaning of &quot;Midtown&quot; have varied over time, expanding from an original concept of a small neighborhood midway between Downtown and Buckhead. Boundary definitions vary by source. In many cases, Midtown is a quasi-legal entity for zoning, law enforcement, and tax purposes. It is defined by the City of Atlanta to include the business district along Peachtree Street as well as Historic Midtown, the residential area east of Piedmont Avenue and to the south of Piedmont Park.

The Midtown Alliance defines a larger, &quot;Greater Midtown&quot; area of approximately four square miles. This includes the area within the city&#x27;s definition, but splitting it into the sub-areas Midtown Core and Midtown Garden District, i.e. Historic Midtown. It also includes the neighborhoods of Ansley Park, Sherwood Forest, Atlantic Station, Home Park, and Loring Heights.

The area has gone by other names in the past. An 1897 source refers to the area as North Atlanta, which would later be the name of today&#x27;s city of Brookhaven. The 1897 &quot;North Atlanta&quot; encompassed (roughly) most of today&#x27;s Midtown, Georgia Tech, and English Avenue. Sources from the 1950s and early 1960s refer to the area as &quot;Uptown Atlanta,&quot; a moniker which would later be applied instead to Buckhead following its annexation.

==History==

The southern half of Midtown between 8th Street and North Ave was originally purchased by Richard Peters in 1848 to use the pine forest there for fuel for his downtown flour mill. Over the next 40 years, Peters slowly subdivided sections of these land lots off for a gridded residential area and built his own home there on Peachtree at 4th Street. His son, Edward, built his home on the block bounded by North Avenue, Piedmont Avenue, Ponce de Leon Avenue, and Myrtle Street. The home, now called Ivy Hall, was restored by the Savannah College of Art &amp; Design in 2008 and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

After the Civil War, Peachtree between what is now 8th and 12th streets was still about a mile beyond the city limits, which ended at Pine Street. After the American Civil War a shantytown named Tight Squeeze developed at Peachtree at what is now 10th Street. It was infamous for vagrancy, desperation, and robberies of merchants transiting the settlement. As Atlanta grew ever further outwards from its historic center, mansions were constructed along Peachtree Street and the area around 10th was known as Blooming Hill.

Cross streets were built and residential development began around 1880. Piedmont Park was established with the Piedmont Exposition of 1887, followed by the Cotton States and International Exposition of 1895, lending the area new prominence. Electric streetcar lines extended along Piedmont Avenue by 1895 and along Peachtree Street (to Brookwood) by 1900.

In 1904, the development of Ansley Park began. By the 1920s, Tenth and Peachtree had become the nexus of a significant shopping district for the surrounding neighborhood. The 1910 &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; listed Peachtree Street in Midtown as one of the finest residential areas of the city, along with Ponce de Leon Circle (now Ponce de Leon Avenue), Washington Street, and Inman Park.

The Downtown Connector freeway opened in the 1950s, and the blocks between Williams Street and Techwood Drive were demolished to make way for it. In 1959 Lenox Square and in 1964, Ansley Mall opened, and the Tenth Street shopping district went into decline. By the late 1960s, Peachtree Street between Eighth and Fourteenth Streets had become a center of hippie culture known as The Strip

Large-scale commercial development began with Colony Square, the first mixed-use development in the Southeast, which was built between 1969 and 1973. The MARTA subway line opened in 1981. In the 1980s, many older properties were demolished, some remaining vacant for decades. High-density commercial and residential development took root in the north–south corridor along Peachtree and West Peachtree. The BellSouth Center (1982), now the AT&amp;T Midtown Center, was long the landmark skyscraper in the area. However, commercial development escalated after 1987, when One Atlantic Center was completed.
The 2000s decade saw the construction of numerous high-rise condo buildings in Midtown, such as the Spire, Viewpoint, and 1010 Midtown. In 2006, then-Mayor Shirley Franklin set in motion a plan to make the 14-block stretch of Peachtree Street a street-level shopping destination. The 2004 opening of the Seventeenth Street Bridge over the Downtown Connector reconnected Midtown with the west side of the city and to the Atlantic Station mixed-use development, which was built on the former site of the Atlantic Steel company.

The Midtown Alliance, a group of volunteers, employees, and business and community members, was formed in 1978 in order to work towards improving the overall quality of life in Midtown and transform it into an ideal place for people to actively live, work, and play. Activities of the Alliance include improving neighborhood safety, developing area arts and education programs, and building community leaders. The master plan from the Alliance, called Blueprint Midtown, is credited with fueling the economic resurgence that has helped the once downtrodden Midtown area transform over the past number of years into a popular neighborhood.

A 2011 &quot;Creative Loafing&quot; article claimed that:No part of the city has evolved more dramatically over the past two decades ... Impersonal office buildings, imposing parking decks and cold asphalt arteries have given way to high-rise living and an explosion of street life ... Where once there was a wasteland, now there are great restaurants, groceries, specialty shops, townhouses, lofts, and ... people.

==Architecture and historic districts==

In the early 1980s, Midtown Atlanta was a blighted area mainly consisting of parking lots. By 1987, One Atlantic Center was built on the corner of West Peachtree Street and 14th Street, which kick-started the redevelopment of the area. Some contemporary buildings of note are:
*High Museum of Art by Richard Meier and Renzo Piano
*One Atlantic Center by Philip Johnson
*1100 Peachtree
*1180 Peachtree
*AT&amp;T Midtown Center
*Four Seasons Hotel
*Promenade II
*Spire
*ViewPoint
*1010 Midtown
In the area surrounding Peachtree Street, very little of the original architecture was preserved. Some of the notable exceptions listed on the National Register of Historic Places include the Margaret Mitchell House, Rhodes Hall, Edward C. Peters House, and the Academy of Medicine.

Historic districts include the Fox Theatre Historic District and Historic Midtown; both are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Fox Theatre Historic District comprises the Fox Theatre (Oliver Vinour et al., 1929), William Lee Stoddart&#x27;s Georgian Terrace Hotel (1911), Stoddart&#x27;s Italianate Ponce de Leon Apartments (1913), and the Cox-Carlton Hotel (1925). Historic Midtown, which includes most of Midtown east of Piedmont Avenue, is noted for its bungalows and Queen Anne style houses.

Midtown&#x27;s focal point is the expansive greenspace of Piedmont Park, which underwent a major expansion in 2011. The park is surrounded by the Midtown business district to its west, Ansley Park to its northwest, the BeltLine, Morningside, and Virginia Highland to its east, and the Midtown Historic District to its south. The Atlanta Botanical Garden adjoins the Park.

The BeltLine is a trail circling the older neighborhoods of central Atlanta which will be developed in stages.

Midtown is known by many residents as Atlanta&#x27;s &quot;Heart of the Arts&quot;. It is the home of the Ferst Center for Arts, Fox Theatre, the Woodruff Arts Center, the Atlanta Botanical Garden, the Richard Meier- and Renzo Piano-designed High Museum of Art, as well as the Atlanta Ballet, Atlanta Symphony Orchestra, Center for Puppetry Arts, and other arts and entertainment venues.

Midtown is the home of the Atlanta campus of Savannah College of Art and Design, which is located in historic buildings throughout the district.
Midtown&#x27;s Piedmont Park is a popular venue for cultural festivals in Atlanta. Every spring, when the native dogwoods are in bloom in Piedmont Park, is the Atlanta Dogwood Festival, an arts and crafts fair. Piedmont Park is the finish line of the Peachtree Road Race, held annually on Independence Day. As ground zero for the Atlanta arts community, Midtown is home to the annual Atlanta Arts Festival, which brings artists from across the country to Piedmont Park.

The Midtown Ecodistrict was created in 2012 as a platform for the community to collaborate on initiatives that results in improved environmental and economic performance. The program focuses on measurement on sustainability methods throughout the company. Green operational practices in the areas of energy, water, transportation and waste were implemented in an effort to make Midtown one of the most livable, vibrant and sustainable districts in the country.

This district is heavily urbanized (buildings, shops, skyscraper and hotels). Midtown also serves cyclists and pedestrians with 5 miles of bike lanes. The restaurants established in Midtown are recycling and composting at least 95% . 50 recycling cans have been installed.

<doc id="768633" wikidata="Q3247086" url="?curid=768633" title="1968 Atlantic hurricane season">
<text>The 1968 Atlantic hurricane season was a below average hurricane season during which only nine nameable storms developed. The season officially began on June 1 and lasted until November 30, dates which conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic basin. Of the named storms, five strengthened into hurricanes; none however intensified into a major hurricane. Only four other seasons since the start of the satellite era—1972, 1986, 1994, and 2013—did not feature a major hurricane. The first system, Hurricane Abby, developed in the northwestern Caribbean on June 1. Abby moved northward and struck Cuba, bringing heavy rainfall and flooding to western portions of the island. Making landfall in Florida on June 4, Abby caused flooding and spawned four tornadoes, but left behind little damage. Overall, the hurricane resulted in six deaths and about $450,000 (1968 USD) in damage. In late June, Tropical Storm Candy brought minor flooding and spawned several tornadoes across portions of the Southern United States. Overall damage from the cyclone reached approximately $2.7 million. 1968 featured two simultaneously active tropical storms during the month of June, a phenomenon that would not occur again until 2023.

Despite three named storms in June, cyclone activity slowed throughout the subsequent month, with only one tropical depression. During late August and early September, Tropical Depression Eleven brought flooding to the Jacksonville area of Florida. Hurricane Gladys, the final and also the strongest named storm of the season, developed in the southwestern Caribbean Sea on October 13. Peaking as a Category 2 on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale, the system resulted in flooding across western Cuba, particularly in Havana, where the storm caused six deaths and about $12 million in damage. Rough seas, gusty winds, tornadoes, and heavy rainfall resulted in generally minor impact in Florida, with three fatalities and damage totaling $6.7 million. Gladys also provided relief for one of North Carolina&#x27;s worst droughts. Several other storms left negligible impact on land. Overall, the storms of the season collectively caused approximately $21.8 million in damage and killed 17 people.

==Season summary==

The Atlantic hurricane season officially began on June 1, with Hurricane Abby developing that day. It was a below average season in which nine tropical or subtropical storms formed, compared to the 1966–2009 average of 11.3 named storms. Five of these reached hurricane strength, slightly below the 1966–2009 average of 6.2. There were no major hurricanes during the season. Despite an active beginning, this season had the fewest hurricane days since 1962. Four hurricanes and one tropical storm made landfall during the season, causing 17 deaths and about $21.8 million in damage. The last storm of the season, a subtropical depression, dissipated on November 25, five days before the official end of hurricane season on November 30.

Tropical cyclogenesis began in June, with three named storms during that monthhurricanes Abby and Brenda and Tropical Storm Candytying several seasons for the most named storms in June. Despite the quick start, activity abruptly slowed, with only a tropical depression in July. The next named storm, Hurricane Dolly, existed from August 10 to August 17, while a tropical depression formed later that month. September was the most active month, with five tropical depressions, two tropical storms, and one subtropical storm, which peaked with an intensity equivalent to a Category 1. In October, Hurricane Gladys became the strongest tropical cyclone of the season, despite maximum sustained winds of only and a minimum barometric pressure of .

The season&#x27;s activity was reflected with an accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 45. ACE is, broadly speaking, a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed, so storms that last a long time, as well as particularly strong hurricanes, have high ACEs. It is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding , which is tropical storm strength.

==Systems==

===Hurricane Abby===
The interaction of a mid-tropospheric trough and a cold front spawned a tropical depression on June 1. The initial circulation was not embedded within the convection, but as it moved slowly north-northeastward, it was able to strengthen and become better organized, reaching tropical storm strength on June 2. It crossed the western tip of Cuba, and upon reaching the southeast Gulf of Mexico, Abby gradually strengthened. It attained winds of 65 mph (100 km/h) prior to landfall near Punta Gorda, Florida, on June 4. Abby moved across the state and then reached the western Atlantic, where it briefly attained hurricane status late on June 5. On June 6, it weakened and made another landfall near Fernandina Beach with winds of 65 mph (100 km/h). Abby weakened to a tropical depression as it moved over Georgia, and over the next six days, it drifted over The Carolinas, finally dissipating on June 13 east of Virginia.

As Abby crossed Cuba, moderate rainfall and relatively high winds were reported. In addition, Abby dropped heavy rainfall across the state of Florida, peaking at in Hart Lake. However, the rain was almost entirely beneficial, as Florida was suffering from a severe drought. Despite winds gusts up to , no significant wind damage was reported. Abby spawned several tornadoes in Florida, though losses rarely exceeded $5,000. One twister in Monroe, North Carolina, damaged 20 cars, and destroyed three homes and impacted 20 others. Elsewhere, the storm dropped relatively light rainfall and produced a few tornadoes throughout the Southeastern United States. Overall, the storm caused approximately $450,000 in damage and led to six indirect fatalities.
===Hurricane Brenda===

The trough that spawned Abby persisted, with another tropical depression developing over the Straits of Florida on June 17. Early the following day, the depression crossed the Florida Keys and later made landfall in a rural area of Monroe County. Wind shear levels became increasingly favorable, causing the depression to maintain its intensity while crossing Florida. Because the heaviest shower and thunderstorm activity remained well offshore the state, little impact was reported. Up to of precipitation fell at the Homestead Experiment Station. At 18:00 UTC on June 19, the depression intensified into a tropical storm while still inland over Central Florida, and six hours later emerged into the Atlantic Ocean near Flagler Beach. Shortly thereafter, a weak trough in the westerlies forced the storm to curve eastward. Intensification then occurred, with Brenda nearing hurricane intensity late on June 21.

At that time and into June 22, the Bermuda high built southwestward as a weak trough passed to the north, resulting in Brenda turning northeastward. With persistent favorable conditions, the storm reached hurricane status at 12:00 UTC on June 23. Early the next day, Brenda attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 80 mph (130 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of . Thereafter, a ridge of high pressure blocked moist air from reaching the storm, causing it to weaken. By June 25, Brenda fell to tropical storm intensity and deteriorated further to a tropical depression on June 26. Later that day, it was absorbed by a large extratropical cyclone, while located about west-southwest of Flores Island in the Azores.
===Tropical Storm Candy===
A tropical disturbance located in the southwestern Gulf of Mexico developed into a tropical depression on June 22. Gradual strengthening occurred, with the depression being upgraded to Tropical Storm Candy on the following day. At 22:45 UTC, the storm peaked with maximum sustained winds of 70 mph (110 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of as it made landfall near Port Aransas, Texas. Moving inland, Candy quickly weakened to a tropical depression late on June 24. However, it persisted for a few more days, until transitioning into an extratropical cyclone over Michigan on June 26.

Due to rainfall from a previous weather system, the ground was already saturated throughout Texas. As a result, Candy caused flooding, with precipitation exceeding in some areas. Minor damage to crops, roads, and bridges was reported in the eastern portions of the state. Agricultural losses alone were slightly less than $2 million. Storm surge along the coast of Texas caused &quot;cuts&quot; on Padre Island. The storm spawned 24 tornadoes, though only one caused significant impact. Candy and its remnants dropped rainfall in 24 other states, reaching as far north as New Hampshire. Overall, Candy caused $2.7 million in damage and no fatalities.
===Hurricane Dolly===

In late July, a tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic Ocean from the west coast of Africa. After tracking west-northwestward and westward, the wave reached the Straits of Florida on August 9, where it began interacting with an upper-level low. Early on August 10, the system developed into a tropical depression, while located near Andros Island in the Bahamas. By 18:00 UTC that day, the depression strengthened into a tropical storm while heading generally northward over the western Atlantic. Initially, Dolly did not strengthen significantly and was nearly absorbed by a cold front. After paralleling part of the East Coast of the United States, Dolly moved further out to sea. By 12:00 UTC on August 12, Dolly developed into a hurricane, and six hours later attained its initial peak of 85 mph (140 km/h).

Dolly briefly weakened back to a tropical storm on August 13 amid unfavorable atmospheric conditions, only to reattain hurricane intensity on the following day. By 12:00 UTC on August 14, Dolly once again peaked with winds of 85 mph (140 km/h). After maintaining its strength for 18 hours, Dolly began to rapidly weaken and became extratropical on August 16, while about north of the Azores. Impact from Hurricane Dolly was minimal, with only rainfall being reported on land. Precipitation peaked at at Palm Beach International Airport in West Palm Beach, Florida. Although it was mostly limited to the east coast of Florida, isolated areas of rain were reported in the Panhandle and on the west coast. Elsewhere, rainfall from Dolly was also recorded in North and South Carolina, though it did not exceed or reach .
===Unnamed tropical storm===

An upper-level trough and attendant frontal boundary moved into the western Atlantic on September 8. The next day, an area of low pressure formed on the tail-end of this front and began to organize as it moved westward. Surface observations suggested the formation of a tropical depression by 00:00 UTC on September 10. The newly formed system curved north-northeast in advance of another trough and intensified into a tropical storm while passing offshore the Carolinas. On September 11, it attained peak winds of 65 mph (100 km/h), a strength it maintained while making landfall in Long Island, New York, around 10:00 UTC that day. A few hours later, the storm transitioned into an extratropical cyclone as it became intertwined with a front. It crossed Newfoundland into the North Atlantic, interacting with another non-tropical low before dissipating on September 17.

While the storm passed just offshore the Outer Banks of North Carolina, the depression dropped of precipitation on Bodie Island. Tropical storm-force winds overspread Long Island and Connecticut, including a peak measurement of 58 mph (93 km/h) at Falkner Island.
===Tropical Storm Edna===

A tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic Ocean from the west coast of Africa on September 10. A weak high-level trough and a warm anticyclone to the east-northeast generated low wind shear, allowing a tropical depression to develop at 18:00 UTC on September 13, while located about southeast of Praia, Cape Verde. Although satellite imagery indicated a well-defined system, the cyclone did not organize further until the following day, when it became a tropical storm at 06:00 UTC. Upon doing so, Edna quickly gained strength. Early on September 15, the ship &quot;Sal Mela&quot; observed wind speeds of , indicating that Edna was approaching hurricane status. At 00:00 UTC, Edna attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 70 mph (110 km/h), which it maintained for 18 hours. On the next day, a cold upper-level trough began producing unfavorable conditions, causing Edna to degenerate into a tropical depression by 06:00 UTC on September 17. Edna degenerated into a tropical wave early the following day, while situated about east of Barbuda.
===Unnamed hurricane===

A subtropical depression developed at 12:00 UTC on September 14, while located about southeast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, initially moving east-northeastward. Early on September 16, it briefly curved north-northwestward and strengthened into a subtropical storm, before turning back to the east-northeast later that day. By September 17, the storm re-curved to the southeast and decelerated, before accelerating again on September 19. Strengthening continued, with the storm becoming a Category 1-equivalent subtropical cyclone early the following day. At 00:00 UTC on September 22, it peaked with maximum sustained winds of and a minimum barometric pressure of . Accelerating northeastward, a weakening trend soon commenced. The subtropical storm became extratropical by 12:00 UTC on September 22. 
===Tropical Storm Frances===

A subtropical depression developed east of the Bahamas at 12:00 UTC on September 23. Convection was enhanced by a mid-tropospheric trough, though further strengthening was initially slow. Initially, the subtropical depression headed northward, but curved northeastward on September 25. A reconnaissance aircraft on September 26 reported a warm core, sustained winds of , and a minimum barometric pressure of . Therefore, it is estimated that the subtropical depression transitioned into Tropical Storm Frances around 12:00 UTC on that date. The storm intensified slightly further to winds of 60 mph (95 km/h) on September 27, before beginning to weaken on the following day. Later that day, steering flow from an upper low-pressure area caused Frances to curve almost due eastward. Frances became extratropical by 12:00 UTC on September 29, while still producing gale-force winds, and dissipated little more than a day later. 
===Hurricane Gladys===
In early October, a tropical wave interacted with the Intertropical Convergence Zone while located in the southwestern Caribbean Sea, spawning multiple low-pressure areas. One of the lows developed into a tropical depression while centered near San Andrés on October 13. The depression moved north-northwestward and strengthened into Tropical Storm Gladys late on October 14. Intensifying further, Gladys attained winds of 65 mph (100 km/h) before striking western Cuba at 15:00 UTC on October 16. Upon reaching the eastern Gulf of Mexico, Gladys resumed intensification, and later attained hurricane status early on October 17. At 00:00 UTC on October 19, Gladys peaked with maximum sustained winds of 100 mph (155 km/h), making it equivalent to a Category 2 hurricane, and four hours later made landfall near Homosassa, Florida, with the same winds, along with an estimated central pressure of . The hurricane crossed the state and continued northeastward, passing just east of Cape Hatteras on October 20. By 18:00 UTC, Gladys became extratropical and was absorbed by a cold front over Nova Scotia.

In Cuba, Gladys caused flash flooding and heavily damaged the tobacco crop. Damage in the country was estimated at $12 million, and there were six deaths. While passing west of the Florida Keys, the hurricane produced strong winds that briefly cut communications to the Dry Tortugas, but damage was minor. Near where Gladys made landfall, winds gusted to and tides reached 6.5 ft (2.0 m) above normal. There was heavy beach erosion and flooding along the coast, while the winds knocked down trees and caused power outages. Across the state, damage was estimated at $6.7 million, and three people were indirectly killed. Heavy rainfall in South Carolina caused minor river flooding. When paralleling just off the coast of North Carolina, Gladys was responsible for breaking the state&#x27;s worst drought since 1932, and proved more beneficial than the minor storm damage there. Later, Gladys killed two people in Atlantic Canada and caused coastal damage in Prince Edward Island. 
===Other systems===

A total of four tropical/subtropical cyclones remained below tropical/subtropical storm strength during the 1968 season. 

On August 26, a tropical depression developed in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico. Drifting northeastward, the depression was situated offshore Central Florida on August 28, shortly before it trekked southward and made three landfalls in Florida near Clearwater, Holmes Beach, and Venice. By early on August 29, the depression began moving northeast to north-northeastward across the state. Late on August 31, the system emerged into the Atlantic Ocean near Atlantic Beach and dissipated shortly thereafter. Due to the depression&#x27;s slow movement across Florida, heavy rainfall was observed, including of rainfall in Jacksonville. Considerable flooding was reported in Clay and Duval counties. Along the upper Cedar River in the latter, many homes and businesses were flooded. Eleven bridges were inundated with water ranging from a few inches to . Peak discharge amounts were higher than during Hurricane Dora in 1964. However, soil moisture and streamflow conditions during Dora were much more conducive to producing floods than antecedent conditions associated with this depression. Further south in Daytona Beach, a tornado destroyed a motel and several homes.

A tropical depression developed on September 18 near Cabo Verde. The depression moved northwestward and did not strengthen. By September 20, it dissipated about in the open Atlantic Ocean.

On September 25, a tropical depression formed in the northwestern Caribbean Sea. While a tropical cyclone, it struck Cuba and Florida. Generally light rainfall was reported in the state, with up to at the Royal Palm Ranger Station in Everglades National Park. Thereafter, the depression tracked northeastward and dissipated on September 28. 

A subtropical depression developed on November 24 near the Bahamas. Moving north-northeastward to northeastward, the depression dissipated southwest of Bermuda about 24 hours later.

==Storm names==

The following list of names was used for named storms that formed in the North Atlantic in 1968. A storm was named Candy for the first time in 1968. Also, the name &quot;Edna&quot; was used this season after a 14 year retirement from the naming list on account of Hurricane Edna in 1954; the name was later permanently retired, as the 1954 hurricane was still an active subject of research.

==Season effects==
This is a table of all of the storms that formed in the 1968 Atlantic hurricane season. It includes their name, duration, peak classification and intensities, areas affected, damage, and death totals. Deaths in parentheses are additional and indirect (an example of an indirect death would be a traffic accident), but were still related to that storm. Damage and deaths include totals while the storm was extratropical, a wave, or a low, and all of the damage figures are in 1968 USD.

<text>The Barbary partridge (Alectoris barbara) is a gamebird in the pheasant family (Phasianidae) of the order Galliformes. It is native to North Africa.

==Distribution==
The Barbary partridge has its main native range in North Africa, and is also native to Gibraltar and the Canary Islands (&quot;Alectoris barbara&quot; ssp. &quot;koenigi&quot;). It has been introduced to continental Portugal and Madeira, though there are no recent records of this species on the latter islands. It is also present in Sardinia.

==Description==
The Barbary partridge is a rotund bird, with a grey-brown back, grey breast and buff belly. The face is light grey with a broad reddish-brown gorget. It has rufous-streaked white flanks and red legs. When disturbed, it prefers to run rather than fly, but if necessary it flies a short distance on rounded wings.

It is closely related to its western European equivalent, the red-legged partridge. It is similar to the red-legged partridge, but it has a different head and neck pattern. The song is a noisy &quot;&quot;.

==Breeding==
This 33–36 cm bird is a resident breeder in dry, open and often hilly country. It nests in a scantily lined ground scrape laying 10-16 eggs. A few cases of breeding in trees in empty nest of African Magpie &quot;Pica mauretanica&quot; have been documented in Tunisia, probably to escape strong predation on the ground.

The Barbary partridge takes a wide variety of seeds and some insect food. It usually starts feeding and drinking at dawn.

The Barbary partridge is the national bird of Gibraltar where it appears on the 1 pence local coins.

<doc id="768640" wikidata="Q7094624" url="?curid=768640" title="Ontario Coalition Against Poverty">
<text>The Ontario Coalition Against Poverty (OCAP) was an anti-poverty group in Ontario, Canada, which promoted the interests of the poor and homeless. The group used publicity-generating direct action techniques such as squatting and demonstrations which could be confrontational, for example the 2000 Queen&#x27;s Park protest. On May 13, 2023, OCAP decided at its annual general meeting to cease operations.

==Composition and early history==
The coalition was founded in 1989 by activists in the Toronto Union of Unemployed Workers, coming out of a mass &quot;March Against Poverty&quot;. The coalition officially began its operations in 1990 with the premise of promoting concern and action around poverty, homelessness, and gentrification in downtown Toronto. The group was headquartered in Toronto.

==Queen&#x27;s Park protest and aftermath==
On June 15, 2000, OCAP staged a large demonstration on the lawn at Queen&#x27;s Park in Toronto, during which violent altercations took place between the demonstrators and security officials, police officers, and police horses. The protestors were asking to address the Ontario Legislature in order to demand a repeal of the new Tenant Protection Act which limited tenant rights, to demand increased social housing, to demand an end to the Safe Streets Act which was targeting the homeless and poor, and to reverse the 21.5% cut to welfare payments instituted by the Conservative government. The protestors, which included large numbers of homeless people directly affected by Premier Mike Harris&#x27; policies, tore up cobblestones to use as projectiles.

Mayor Mel Lastman, the Toronto Police Services Board and the Toronto Police Association argued that the police response was proportionate, but seventeen community groups which included Ontario Public Service Employees Union, Parkdale Community Legal Services and the National Action Committee on the Status of Women called for an inquiry to be made by the Ontario Civilian Commission on Police Services.

In the aftermath, upwards of 40 people were arrested and charged, including three high-profile OCAP members — John Clarke, Gaetan Heroux and Stefan Pilipa. The defence argued that videos demonstrated police brutality. The eventual trial of these three was declared by the presiding judge to be a mistrial due to a hung jury. The Crown dropped the charges against Heroux and Pilipa but elected to proceed again against Clarke. All charges against Clarke were eventually dropped when a judge threw them out owing to the Crown&#x27;s failure to disclose evidence expeditiously.

Charges against most other defendants had mixed results; most were either acquitted or had their charges dropped. In all, however, the crown attorney in conjunction with the Toronto police spent over two years on these cases. In the early 2000s, OCAP&#x27;s activities were denounced by union bureaucrats and some public officials who have objected to their tactics.

== Flaherty eviction ==

OCAP evicted the Ontario Finance Minister Jim Flaherty from his constituency office in Whitby in June, 2001. By this action, OCAP wanted to demonstrate opposition to Flaherty&#x27;s policies and to show him personally the effects of being evicted. Office furniture was damaged and some OCAP members were arrested. In response, the Canadian Auto Workers union cancelled its funding for the group.

== Pope squat ==
OCAP squatted a house in Parkdale at 1510 King Street West, in July 2002. South Parkdale was undergoing a gentrification process and OCAP had identified 35 longterm empty properties. The selected building was chosen because the ownership was in limbo between the city and the province. It was called the Pope squat because of the concurrent visit of Pope John Paul II. The squat was well supported by figures such as Jack Layton and Naomi Klein and the city council passed a motion suggesting the building be converted into affordable housing, but it was evicted in November 2002 by the province.

== Diet allowance ==
OCAP noticed in 2005 that the Ontario Works social assistance regulations mandated doctors prescribing a diet allowance to people who were claiming welfare benefits. Working with doctors such as Gary Bloch, OCAP ensured people were informed about the allowance. In 2006, the provincial government decided that only people with specific illnesses could be prescribed the allowance.

==Coronavirus concerns==
On March 18, 2020, OCAP called for the city of Toronto to repurpose empty buildings into shelter for homeless people so as to minimise the effects of the coronavirus pandemic.

<text>Herman Zanstra (November 3, 1894, Schoterland – October 2, 1972, Haarlem) was a Dutch astronomer.

Zanstra was born near Heerenveen in Friesland. In 1917 he graduated with an Engineer&#x27;s degree in chemical engineering from the Delft Institute of Technology. While working in Delft for four years, the last two as a high school teacher, he wrote a highly theoretical and mathematical paper on relative motion which he sent to William Francis Gray Swann. Swann, then offered him to earn a Ph.D. degree in theoretical physics with him at the University of Minnesota at Minneapolis, which he did in two years time by expanding on his paper (dissertation: &quot;A Study of Relative Motion in Connection with Classical Mechanics&quot;, 1923). After another year with Swann, now in Chicago, and a year at various labs in the Netherlands and Germany and two months at Niels Bohr&#x27;s lab in Copenhagen, he became a postdoc at Caltech. Here he wrote a famous paper, &quot;An Application of the Quantum Theory to the Luminosity of Diffuse Nebulae&quot;, which for the first time provided a quantitative method (the &quot;Zanstra method&quot;) for understanding the luminosity of nebulas and comets.

After teaching briefly at the University of Washington he went to London and eventually to the University of Amsterdam. World War II left him stranded in South Africa, and he therefore took up a teaching position in Durban, but returned to Europe after the war. In 1949 he became member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.

He won the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1961.

The lunar crater Zanstra is named after him, as is Asteroid 2945 Zanstra.

<text>Real Gone is the sixteenth studio album by Tom Waits, released on October 4, 2004, in Europe, and October 5 in the United States on the ANTI- label. The album was supported by the Real Gone Tour, playing sold-out locations in North America and Europe in October and November 2004.

The album features some of the few political songs Waits has written, the most explicit being &quot;Day After Tomorrow&quot;, a song Waits has described as an &quot;elliptical&quot; protest against the Iraq War.

It was chosen by the editors of &quot;Harp Magazine&quot; as the best album of 2004.

A remixed, remastered version of the album was released by ANTI- on November 22, 2017, with the remastering process personally overseen by Waits and Kathleen Brennan.

==Background==
Per ANTI-, 
Written and produced by Tom Waits and Kathleen Brennan, his wife and long-time collaborator, &quot;Real Gone&quot; features 15 tracks of funk, Jamaican rock-steady, blues both urban and rural, rhythms and melodies both Latin and African and, for the first time, no piano. The crash and collide of rhythms and genres within a song creates a hybrid unlike any music he has and the sonic mayhem and nonsense rhyme ride to &quot;Top of the Hill&quot; are both punctuated by a live band and turntable playing along to Waits&#x27; home recorded voice percussion.

The album features Waits beatboxing on tracks like &quot;Top of the Hill&quot; and &quot;Metropolitan Glide&quot;. He had picked up the technique from his interest in hip hop. Waits&#x27;s longtime guitarist Marc Ribot plays in a Cuban style on &quot;Hoist That Rag&quot;, as he had on &quot;The Prosthetic Cubans&quot;.

The album features references to real people and events. &quot;Don&#x27;t Go Into That Barn&quot; was based on a &quot;New York Times&quot; story about a slave jail in Kentucky. The article quotes Isaac Lang, Jr.: &quot;Dad told us never to go in there...He said, &#x27;Boys, I&#x27;m going to tell you the truth. It&#x27;s all right to play around that barn, but don&#x27;t go inside.&#x27; He said it just wasn&#x27;t right. That it was pitiful. He never did tell us why.&quot; The article quotes Carl Westmoreland: &quot;It was a slave ship turned upside down,&quot; a line echoed by Waits.

<doc id="768664" wikidata="Q201881" url="?curid=768664" title="1969 Atlantic hurricane season">
<text>The 1969 Atlantic hurricane season was the most active Atlantic hurricane season since the 1933 season, and was the final year of the most recent positive Atlantic multidecadal oscillation (AMO) era. The hurricane season officially began on June 1, and lasted until November 30. Altogether, 12 tropical cyclones reached hurricane strength, the highest number on record at the time; a mark not surpassed until 2005. The season was above-average despite an El Niño, which typically suppresses activity in the Atlantic Ocean, while increasing tropical cyclone activity in the Pacific Ocean. Activity began with a tropical depression that caused extensive flooding in Cuba and Jamaica in early June. On July 25, Tropical Storm Anna developed, the first named storm of the season. Later in the season, Tropical Depression Twenty-Nine caused severe local flooding in the Florida Panhandle and southwestern Georgia in September.

The most significant storm of the season was Hurricane Camille, which peaked as a Category 5 hurricane on August 17 and devastated the Gulf Coast of the United States upon striking Mississippi the next day. Strong winds and storm surge heights especially impacted Mississippi and Louisiana. Later in its duration, the storm caused severe flooding Virginia and West Virginia. Camille alone was responsible for 259 deaths and $1.43 billion. It was the costliest United States hurricane at the time, until Hurricane Agnes in 1972. In early September, Hurricane Francelia caused deadly floods in Central America, with 271 people killed in Central America. Hurricane Inga had the third longest duration of an Atlantic tropical cyclone. The last storm, Hurricane Martha, was the only known tropical cyclone to make landfall in Panama. Martha caused minor flooding in the former and Costa Rica. Overall, the systems of the season collectively caused 535 deaths and over $1.5 billion in losses.

== Season summary ==
The 1969 Atlantic hurricane season officially began on June 1. Of the twenty-three tropical cyclones that developed in the North Atlantic Ocean in 1969, eighteen of them intensified into tropical storms; this was above the 1950–2000 average of 9.6 named storms. In terms of tropical storms, it was the busiest season since 1933. Twelve systems reached hurricane status, a record that stood until there were fifteen named storms in 2005. Three of the hurricanes deepened into major hurricanes, which are Category 3 or higher on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. Between 1950 and 2000, there was an average of 2.3 major hurricanes per season. Throughout the season, the U.S. Weather Bureau issued more advisories than in any previous season. Additionally, reconnaissance aircraft were utilized for more flight hours than in any year in the Atlantic basin until that point. The season officially ended on November 30.

Hurricane Camille made landfall in Mississippi on August 18 as a Category 5 hurricane, one of only four tropical cyclones on record to strike the continental United States at that strength, after the 1935 Labor Day hurricane, and addition to: Hurricane Andrew in 1992, and Hurricane Michael in 2018. During the 1969 season, Project Stormfury conducted seeding experiments on Hurricane Debbie, which declined in wind speed by 31% on the first day and by 18% of the following day. With a duration of almost 25 days from September 20 to October 15, Hurricane Inga became the third longest-lasting tropical cyclone on record in the Atlantic, behind only the 1899 San Ciriaco hurricane, and Hurricane Ginger in 1971. On November 24, Hurricane Martha became the first tropical cyclone on record to strike Panama.

The season was above average despite an El Niño, which typically suppresses tropical cyclogenesis in the Atlantic Ocean while increasing activity in the eastern Pacific Ocean. The Atlantic upper tropospheric shear line, a semi-permanent feature that extended southeastward into the Caribbean Sea, which enhances outflow from disturbances, remained persistent throughout the season. However, the opposite periphery of the shear line inhibits the divergent outflow of a disturbance. This may have increased the number of tropical cyclones developing, while causing other storms to remain weak or dissipate over the deep tropics. Additionally, an abnormally strong mid-tropospheric ridge replaced the southward-displaced westerlies that deterred tropical cyclone formation in 1968. Five hurricanes and two tropical storms made landfall, causing 535 deaths and $1.5 billion in damage; Tropical Depression Twenty-Nine also resulted in damage.
Tropical cyclogenesis began early, with a tropical depression that affected Jamaica. Activity briefly went dormant between June 15 and July 25, when the next depression originated. That same day, the season&#x27;s first named storm, Anna, developed over the eastern Atlantic. There were five tropical cyclones that formed in the month of August – Blanche, Camille, Debbie, Eve, and Francelia. Camille was the most intense tropical cyclone of the season, peaking as a Category 5 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of and a minimum barometric pressure of .

September was the most active month of the season, with six tropical cyclones, five of which intensified into a tropical storm – Gerda, Holly, Inga, and an unnamed hurricane. Of the five named storms that originated in October, three intensified into hurricanes, including Kara, Laurie, and an unnamed storm. While an unnamed hurricane existed into November, Martha was the only tropical cyclone to originate in that month. Martha, the last storm of the season, dissipated over Panama on November 25.

The season&#x27;s activity was reflected with an accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 149. ACE is, broadly speaking, a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed, so storms that last a long time, as well as particularly strong hurricanes, have high ACEs. It is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding , which is the threshold for tropical storm status.
== Systems ==

=== June tropical depression ===

A tropical depression developed near the Yucatan Peninsula on June 7. It moved north, reaching western Cuba by the following day. As the depression moved towards Florida, small-craft warnings were issued for the southern coast. The depression made landfall in Florida on June 9 and dissipated shortly thereafter. As a result of rain in Cuba, Radio Havana warned of a flash flood and later reported that three rivers were overflowing in Camagüey. Flooding also forced 1,801 people from their homes. Sustained winds of and gusts up to were observed on the island. Impact from the depression in Florida is unknown.

Damage was catastrophic in Jamaica with landslides, flooding, broken communication lines, cancellation of its railway service and evacuation of hundreds of people from their homes. The Jamaica Railway Corporation&#x27;s trains were disrupted by landslides blocking the tracks from Spanish Town to Port Antonio and floodwaters inundating a bridge in Gregory Park. A train bound for Kingston was disrupted by the flooded bridge, as was a diesel tram, isolating both trains at Richmond. Furthermore, the former train did not reach its destination due to landslides. The Jamaica Telephone Company reported troubles due to waterlogged telephone lines. Schools and colleges in Kingston suspended classes and motorists in the area had difficulty traveling due to flooded roads. Correspondents from &quot;The Gleaner&quot; reported heavy rains, which inundated roads, washed away livestock and destroyed crops. On June 9, the Church Welfare Organization of the West Indies Junior Seventh Day Adventists set out food, money and blankets the victims.
=== July tropical depression ===

A tropical wave situated about east of Trinidad developed into a tropical depression on July 25. The depression moved northwestward toward the Lesser Antilles and later that day crossed Barbados with winds of . It continued to the northwest and may have struck Martinique on July 26. At 0000 UTC on the following day, the depression dissipated about west-southwest of Basseterre, Guadeloupe.

=== Tropical Storm Anna ===

On July 23, a tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic from the west coast of Africa. By 06:00 UTC on July 25, the system developed into Tropical Depression Twelve. Initially, the depression strengthened slowly while moving west-northwestward. Eventually, it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Anna at 06:00 UTC on July 27. Modest intensification ensued during the next 18 hours, after which Anna maintained winds of for nearly two days. At 12:00 UTC on July 30, Anna began to weaken and moved in a more northwesterly direction. By 12:00 UTC on July 31, Anna degenerated into a surface-based trough while situated north of the Lesser Antilles, but continued to produce gale-force winds.

Anna reorganized into a tropical storm by 12:00 UTC on August 1, but weakened to a tropical depression as it re-curved northeastward on August 2, while situated offshore of the East Coast of the United States. By 18:00 UTC, however, Anna once again regained tropical-storm status, and underwent steady intensification on the following day. At 18:00 UTC on August 3, Anna peaked with winds of , and six hours later attained its minimum central pressure of . Anna subsequently weakened and merged with an extratropical low-pressure area on the same day, while centered near Sable Island. The remnants continued rapidly east-northeastward across the Atlantic until becoming unidentifiable on August 5.
=== August tropical depression ===

A trough in the western Gulf of Mexico produced an area of thunderstorms. On August 7, a Hurricane Hunters flight observed a circulation, indicating that a tropical depression developed. The system moved southwestward, making landfall near Tuxpan in northeastern Mexico early on August 8. It quickly dissipated after moving ashore.
=== Hurricane Blanche ===

A tropical wave was initially tracked about east of the Lesser Antilles on August 6. The system curved west-northward on August 6 and eventually moved around the western periphery of the Bermuda high. Late on August 10, a closed circulation developed, indicative of a tropical depression, and by 00:00 UTC on August 11 the system became a tropical storm while located about east of Wabasso Beach, Florida. Under the influence of a trough, Blanche headed rapidly north to north-northeastward while significantly intensifying, becoming a hurricane by 18:00 UTC on the same date, based on Navy reconnaissance reports.

At 00:00 UTC on August 12, Blanche peaked at . Afterward, the strong southwesterly current in which Blanche was embedded caused the storm to accelerate northeastward. By 12:00 UTC Blanche lost its tropical characteristics near Sable Island, having developed an asymmetrical wind field. At Sable Island, a weather station reported sustained winds of and gusts up to . While passing to the south of Newfoundland, the extratropical remnants of Blanche turned eastward and east-southeastward, eventually to be absorbed by a frontal zone late on August 14.
=== Hurricane Debbie ===
On August 14, a tropical wave developed into a tropical depression while located about midway between the Lesser Antilles and the coast of Africa. The following day, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Debbie. By 12:00 UTC on August 16, Debbie became a Category 1 hurricane, and continued intensification led to its first peak of by 18:00 UTC on August 17. Debbie then began oscillating between a Category 1 and a Category 2 hurricane for the next few days, possibly due to being seeded by silver iodide as part of Project Stormfury, though reanalysis suggested that an eyewall replacement cycle was the culprit instead. Moving northwestward, Debbie began re-intensifying on August 19, becoming Category 3 hurricane with winds of by 18:00 UTC. By 00:00 UTC on August 20, Debbie peaked with winds of , which it maintained for a full day. The storm&#x27;s minimum barometric pressure of was measured by hurricane hunters during this timeframe.

Debbie curved northeastward as Hurricane Camille moved offshore the East Coast of the United States, weakening to a Category 2 hurricane early on August 21. Debbie accelerated and fell to below Category 2 intensity by 12:00 UTC on August 23. Six hours later Debbie became extratropical while still bearing hurricane-force winds, shortly before passing just offshore Newfoundland. The remnants of Debbie turned northeastward and deteriorated to gale strength late on August 24. About three days later, Debbie&#x27;s remnants dissipated about east-northeast of Cape Farewell, Greenland. In Newfoundland, wind gusts up to were observed in St. John&#x27;s, while rainfall up to was recorded along the Avalon and Bonavista peninsulas.
=== Hurricane Camille ===
A tropical disturbance moved off the west coast of Africa on August 5, and developed into Tropical Storm Camille near Grand Cayman on August 14. The storm strengthened quickly into a strong Category 2 hurricane with winds of when it struck near the western tip of Cuba on August 15. The storm damaged 100 homes on Isla de la Juventud, while 20,000 residents were left homeless on the mainland; five fatalities were also reported and damages reached $5 million. Early on August 16, Camille emerged into the Gulf of Mexico. Between August 16–17, the storm rapidly deepened, attaining a minimum barometric pressure of , along with maximum sustained winds of , making it a Category 5 hurricane. After briefly weakening to Category 4 intensity near the Mississippi River Delta, Camille re-intensified prior to landfall near Waveland, Mississippi, early on August 18, becoming one of only four tropical cyclones to strike the mainland United States as a Category 5, the others being the 1935 Labor Day hurricane, Hurricane Andrew in 1992, and Hurricane Michael in 2018. With winds of and an estimated pressure of at landfall, Camille was the second strongest and next most intense hurricane to strike the mainland United States, as measured by wind and pressure, respectively, after the 1935 hurricane. Mississippi bore the brunt of Hurricane Camille. A combination of strong winds—estimated at up to in gusts—and large storm surges caused adverse impact in the state. In Mississippi alone, 3,881 dwellings were destroyed and 41,848 were damaged. About 406 trailers were destroyed and an additional 325 suffered major losses. An estimated 645 farm buildings were destroyed and another 2,002 received major damage. In addition, 569 small businesses were impacted.

In Mississippi&#x27;s neighboring states of Alabama and Louisiana, 1,781 homes were destroyed and 6,000 others were inflicted losses. About 676 trailers were demolished and 296 were severely impacted. Additionally, 124 small businesses were either destroyed or incurred major damage. Camille rapidly weakened after landfall on August 18 and was only a tropical depression about 24 hours later. However, the storm maintained intensity as it recurved to the east over the Ohio River Valley. It dropped heavy rainfall while approaching the Atlantic Ocean, especially in Virginia. Up to fell in west central Nelson County. In Nelson County alone, 133 bridges washed out, while in some places entire communities were under water. Rivers crested at record heights, causing severe flooding. In the state of Virginia and West Virginia combined, an estimated 349 homes were destroyed and 2,587 received damage to some degree. Eighty-three trailers were demolished and 71 others received major losses. Reportedly, 730 farm buildings were destroyed and 535 were inflicted minor damage. Ninety-six small businesses were also severely damaged or destroyed. Along its path, rainfall was recorded in several other states, including Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and Tennessee. After reaching the Atlantic, Camille re-strengthened into a strong tropical storm with winds of on August 21, but was absorbed by a cold front south of Newfoundland on August 22. With losses estimated at $1.42 billion, Camille was considered the costliest hurricane in United States history at the time. Additionally, there were 256 deaths in the United States.
=== Tropical Storm Eve ===

In the wake of Hurricane Camille, a quasi-stationary front moved across the Southern United States and became situated over North Florida. A cut-off low pressure area developed along the system and acquired a low-level circulation. By 0000 UTC on August 25, the system was classified as a tropical depression while located about east of Jacksonville, Florida. Due to cold air in the region, the depression strengthened slowly while tracking nearly due east. Late on August 25, it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Eve.

On August 26, the National Hurricane Center noted although conditions would prevent rapid deepening, further intensification was possible. The storm threatened the Mid-Atlantic states and Bermuda, but remained offshore and caused no impacts in either region. Eve strengthened slightly on August 26, reaching maximum sustained winds of . Although the storm weakened later that day, Eve reached its minimum barometric pressure of . Early on August 2, Eve was downgraded to a tropical depression. It began to succumb to the effects of cold air, which entrained the circulation of the storm. At 0000 UTC on August 28, Eve degenerated into a trough of low pressure while located about west-northwest of Bermuda.
=== Hurricane Francelia ===
A tropical wave developed into a tropical depression near the Windward Islands on August 29. Initially, the depression slowly strengthened while moving west-northwestward and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Francelia until more than 24 hours later. While located north of Honduras, it curved west-southwestward and was upgraded to a hurricane on September 1. Late on September 3, Francelia made landfall near Punta Gorda, Belize with winds of . The storm quickly weakened inland, and less than 24 hours later, it dissipated over northern Guatemala. However, the remnants of Francelia later contributed to the development of Hurricane Glenda in the eastern Pacific Ocean.

During its early stages, Francelia brought gusty winds and light rainfall to several islands in the Caribbean Sea. While remaining nearly stationary offshore Central America, heavy precipitation fell in some countries, especially Guatemala where severe flooding killed 269 people and caused $15 million in damage. Throughout the country, approximately 10,200 people were left homeless. In neighboring Honduras, the hurricane caused damage in the northern portions of the country, with the offshore Bay Islands Department being particularly hard hit. There, the storm damaged or destroyed the majority of two towns. In El Salvador, flooding isolated towns for several days and caused crop damage. Coastal areas of Belize lost electricity and telephone service, and high winds resulted in extensive damage to banana crops. A number of rivers in the region flooded, including the Belize River, which reached above normal. Francelia ranked as the deadliest tropical cyclone in Guatemala, until Hurricane Mitch in 1998. Overall damage was estimated at $35.6 million, and there were 271 deaths.
=== Early September tropical depression ===

A tropical depression exited the coast of Africa on September 5 and proceeded westward. Two days later, it developed into a tropical depression, with winds of around . At that time, the system had a tight circulation with organized convection over the center. On September 9, the system began weakening, dissipating a day later. The remnants eventually crossed the Lesser Antilles on September 13.
=== Hurricane Gerda ===
A tropical wave located over the central Bahamas developed into a tropical depression on September 6. The depression moved northwestward and initially remained disorganized. By early on September 7, the depression made landfall near West Palm Beach, Florida. Impact in the state was minimal, limited mostly to light rainfall. Later on September 7, the depression reemerged into the Atlantic Ocean just south of Cape Canaveral. It began to strengthen on the following day and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Gerda at 0600 UTC. By late on September 8, Gerda intensified into a hurricane. The storm deepened significantly further, peaking with winds of on September 9. Early on September 10, Gerda weakened slightly while approaching New England and Atlantic Canada.

It made landfall near Eastport, Maine, at 01:00 UTC on September 10, becoming the only hurricane on record to have impacted the state. Despite landfall as a Category 1 hurricane, the strongest sustained wind speed recorded was in Washington County, Maine as the sheared nature kept the strongest winds farther east. Twenty-four-hour rainfall amounts exceeding were observed in some areas of New England, with a precipitation peak of in Wellfleet, Massachusetts. Due to the winds and rainfall, portions of Maine, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire reported power outages and localized flooding. By 0600 UTC on September 10, Gerda became extratropical over southeastern Quebec. In Atlantic Canada, winds left many without electricity in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, and left about $3.5 million in losses to apple crops.
=== Hurricane Holly ===

A tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic Ocean from the west coast of Africa on September 8. Moving westward to west-northwestward, it developed into a tropical depression at 1200 UTC on September 14, while located about southeast of Puerto Rico, based on Hurricane Hunter observations of an organized circulation. It quickly organized and was soon upgraded to Tropical Storm Holly. Continuing northwestward, it steadily intensified, and the Hurricane Hunters reported that Holly attained hurricane status on September 16, with peak winds of and a minimum barometric pressure of .

On September 16, Holly weakened slightly while turning westward toward the Lesser Antilles. Due to the lack of good upper-level outflow, as well as unfavorable water, Holly quickly weakened to tropical storm status on September 18, as confirmed by the Hurricane Hunters. By the next day, it weakened to tropical depression status and later moved through the Lesser Antilles. Holly dissipated on September 21 in the Caribbean Sea, while situated between the Los Roques archipelago of Venezuela and Puerto Rico.
=== Mid-September tropical depression ===

Ship reports on September 19 indicated the presence of low pressure area in the Gulf of Mexico, centered about west-northwest of Key West, Florida. It is estimated that a tropical depression developed at 1200 UTC on that day. The depression headed north-northwestward and did not strengthen significantly, although it may have briefly become a tropical storm. By early on September 21, the depression made landfall between Panama City and Port St. Joe, Florida. It degenerated into a remnant low pressure area only a few hours later. A high-pressure ridge blocked the system&#x27;s movement, moving it to the east. By September 23, the system became a low pressure trough. Upper-level wind shear moved the circulation to the east-northeast and moved into the Atlantic Ocean the next day.

Rainfall in Florida peaked at in Havana, and exceeding in most of the central Panhandle. Many bridges and roads were washed out or inundated by water, including portions of U.S. Route 98 and State Road 20 between Tallahassee and Panama City. In addition, a tornado spawned by the depression destroyed a trailer, damaged 30 homes, and toppled ballpark bleachers, fences, lights, and electrical poles. Damage in Florida reached almost $3.78 million, including $1.65 million to crops and $2.135 million to property. In southwest Georgia, precipitation totals exceeding were common, while rainfall peaked at in southern Decatur County. Severe local flooding ensued, causing damage to property and crops, mostly to peanuts that were not threshed. Up to of rainfall fell in Alabama, while precipitation totals reached in Tennessee, South Carolina, North Carolina, and Virginia.
=== Hurricane Inga ===
A tropical disturbance developed into a tropical depression on September 20. By the following day, it strengthened into Tropical Storm Inga while centered about east-southeast of San Juan, Puerto Rico. At the time, the storm was moving westward at . However, by September 23, the storm weakened to a tropical depression. The depression continued west-northwestward, passing north of the Leeward Islands, before drifting northwestward. Inga became a tropical storm again on September 29. It continued to intensify, and achieved hurricane status on September 30, while curving northeastward. The storm then turned towards the south, and ultimately completed a cyclonic loop as it bent back westward. Late on October 3, Inga turned to the northwest.

Early on October 5, the hurricane produced wind gusts up to on Bermuda, though minimal impact occurred other than power outages. Thereafter, Inga curved northeastward and continued deepen. Later on October 5, it peaked as a strong Category 2 with maximum sustained winds of and a minimum barometric pressure of . While moving into an environment of colder sea surface temperatures, the storm began to weaken. As cold air became entrained into its circulation, the storm began to lose tropical characteristics. Inga briefly re-strengthened while beginning to drift generally eastward. However, storm turned southward and began to weaken, deteriorating to a tropical storm on October 10. Heading westward, Inga was downgraded to a tropical depression, before dissipating fully on October 15, while located about from where it initially attained hurricane status.
=== September hurricane ===

A subtropical depression formed approximately east-southeast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, around 12:00 UTC on September 21. Six hours later, the system intensified into a subtropical storm as it headed east-northeastward. The storm curved northeastward by September 24 and transitioned into a hurricane that day, peaking with maximum sustained winds of and a minimum barometric pressure of . Shortly thereafter, the hurricane began accelerating, before dissipating about south of Newfoundland early on September 26.
=== September tropical storm ===

A tropical storm developed from a subtropical depression southwest of the Azores on September 24. After a day of drifting west-southwest, it moved westward where it became a subtropical storm, and later a tropical storm on September 26. The cyclone reached peaked with maximum sustained winds of on September 27 while moving northward. Satellite estimates suggest that it may have reached hurricane intensity but such could not be concluded by other data. It retained that intensity for two days, but on September 30, it became extratropical well east of Newfoundland.
=== Subtropical Storm One ===

An upper-level low pressure area in the southeastern Gulf of Mexico spawned a subtropical depression at 1200 UTC on September 29. Operationally, it was classified as Tropical Depression Thirty-Two. Six hours later, the strengthened into a subtropical storm. Early on the following day, the storm peaked with maximum sustained winds of . It maintained that intensity for about 24 hours, before cool air and wind shear began weakening the storm early on October 1. Shortly thereafter, the storm weakened back to a subtropical depression, a few hours prior to landfall near Fort Walton Beach, Florida. The subtropical depression rapidly dissipated inland.

Rainfall was relatively light and the heaviest amounts were displaced far east of the track, with precipitation peaking at in Saint Augustine, Florida. Closer to the location of landfall, rainfall reached nearly in Pensacola. Several waterspouts were reported in the Panama City area, while a tornado touched down in Carabelle, and another unroofed a home in the St. James community. United States Coast Guard planes searched for three people in a light aircraft that went missing as it traveled from DeFuniak Springs to Sebring. The storm brought rainfall to several others states, reaching as far north as Maine.
=== Tropical Storm Jenny ===

On October 1, a tropical depression developed over the northwestern Caribbean Sea from the same cut-off low pressure that spawned the previous subtropical storm on September 29. The depression moved quickly north-northeastward and struck Cuba early on October 2. While approaching the southwest coast of Florida later that day, the system intensified into Tropical Storm Jenny. Simultaneously, Jenny attained its peak intensity with winds of and a minimum pressure of . Around 0000 UTC on October 2, the storm made landfall between Fort Myers and Naples, Florida, with winds of . Jenny emerged into the western Atlantic as a tropical depression, but increased ridging forced the storm to track west-southwestward back over Florida. The cyclone was unable to re-strengthen and dissipated on October 6 south of Louisiana.

The storm crossed Cuba as a tropical depression. Minimal impact was reported. The storm produced moderate to heavy rainfall over parts of the Florida Peninsula, peaking at near Deland. Minor road washouts were reported in Lee County. Rainfall along the lower Kissimmee River and the Lake Okeechobee basin caused some pastures and flood plain areas to be inundated by water. Lake Kissimmee rose in height due to precipitation. Jenny&#x27;s remnants later contributed to the development of heavy rains in southern Louisiana.
=== Hurricane Kara ===

A cold core trough of low pressure over the western Atlantic Ocean warmed on the eastern end, becoming a tropical depression on October 7 about north of Punta Cana, Dominican Republic. The depression passed south of Turks and Caicos Islands and later to the west of Mayaguana. Early on October 9, the system turned northward and intensified into Tropical Storm Kara after several hours. Southwesterly flow associated with an upper-level trough then caused the storm to curve northeastward. On October 10, an upper-level low pressure formed offshore North Carolina. Initially, Kara moved rapidly north-northwest around the low. However, by October 11, Kara and the low merged, resulting in the former moving erratically. While tracking southwestward into warmer ocean temperatures, the storm continued to strengthen.

After executing a small cyclonic loop, Kara developed an eye feature on October 14, before strengthening into a hurricane on October 15. While moving offshore North Carolina, the storm brought tides of above normal between October 10 and October 15, causing coastal flooding in very low-lying areas. By October 15, an upper-level westerlies forced the storm to move northeastward and accelerate. Kara began losing tropical characteristics and weakening after encountering a cold trough over the northeast Atlantic, falling to tropical storm intensity late on October 18. The storm soon became extratropical about north-northeast of Corvo Island in the Azores.
=== Hurricane Laurie ===

A low pressure area developed into a tropical depression while located about northeast of Guanaja in the Bay Islands Department of Honduras. Although conditions were favorable for rapid deepening, the depression failed to do so because it was not vertically stacked and struck the Yucatan Peninsula late on October 18. After emerging into the Gulf of Mexico on the following day, the system strengthened into Tropical Storm Laurie. Later on October 19, Laurie curved northward and continued intensifying. At 18:00 UTC on October 20, the storm became a hurricane. It then curved eastward over the central Gulf of Mexico and continued to deepen, peaking as a Category 1 hurricane with sustained winds of and a minimum barometric pressure of . Thereafter, drier air began weakening Laurie on October 22. Laurie curved southeastward and then southward, allowing it to remain well offshore the Gulf Coast of the United States.

Early on October 23, the cyclone weakened to a tropical storm while curving west-southwestward. Late the following day, Laurie deteriorated into a tropical depression. After moving southwestward and then southward, the storm made landfall near Paraíso, Tabasco, Mexico, early on October 27. Laurie promptly dissipated. Offshore, oil rig personnel were evacuated as the storm approached. A hurricane watch was issued from Galveston, Texas, to Pensacola, Florida; the watch was extended eastward to Apalachicola, Florida, on October 21. Voluntary evacuations occurred in southern Louisiana out of fear of a storm similar to Hurricane Betsy in 1965 or Camille earlier that year. Impact on land was primarily limited to minor beach erosion. It caused minor damage in the Yucatan Peninsula and in Tabasco.
=== October tropical storm ===

A subtropical depression formed west-southwest of the Azores on October 28. It moved northwestward, reaching tropical storm strength on October 29, and after turning sharply east, the system attained its peak of winds. The storm transitioned into an extratropical on October 31 west of the Azores.
=== October hurricane ===

A large extratropical storm over the North Atlantic formed a subtropical storm on October 31 south of Newfoundland. It moved southeast, gaining tropical characteristics and strength on the way. It reached hurricane strength on November 4, peaking as a minimal Category 1 storm while approaching the Azores, but weakened prior to passing through the islands. The system transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on November 7.
=== Hurricane Martha ===
Tropical Storm Martha developed in the southwestern Caribbean Sea on November 21. Initially, the storm developed with sustained winds of , skipping tropical depression status. It remained stationary and quickly intensified into a hurricane. Martha attained maximum sustained winds of on November 22. Subsequently, Martha weakened and drifted southward. On November 24, Martha made landfall in Veraguas, Panama, as a strong tropical storm. Martha was the only tropical cyclone on record to make landfall in Panama. The system weakened to a tropical depression and dissipated over land on November 25.

Because the storm weakened prior to landfall, strong winds were not expected or reported in the impacted countries. In Panama, more than of precipitation may have fallen in some areas. Agricultural land was flooded in Almirante, Bocas del Toro and streets became inundated in low-lying areas of Puerto Armuelles, Chiriquí. The storm also brought significant rains to Costa Rica. Flooding and mudslides isolated most of the capital city of San José. Numerous streets were inundated in Golfito. Damage in Costa Rica reached $30 million and 5 deaths were reported.
== Storm names ==

The following list of names was used for named storms that formed in the North Atlantic in 1969. This is the same list used in the 1965 season, except for &quot;Blanche&quot;, &quot;Camille&quot;, &quot;Eve&quot;, and &quot;Francelia&quot;, which replaced &quot;Betsy&quot;, &quot;Carol&quot;, &quot;Elena&quot;, and &quot;Frances&quot;, respectively. Storms were named &quot;Blanche&quot;, &quot;Camille&quot;, &quot;Eve&quot;, &quot;Francelia&quot;, &quot;Holly&quot;, &quot;Kara&quot;, &quot;Laurie&quot; and &quot;Martha&quot; for the first (and in the case of &quot;Camille&quot;, only) time in 1969.

=== Retirement ===

After the season, the name &quot;Camille&quot; was retired. The name &quot;Cindy&quot; was selected to replace &quot;Camille&quot; in 1973. However, the 4year lists then in use were replaced in 1971 by a new series of 10 lists, running through 1980 before recycling.

== Season effects ==
This is a table of all of the storms that formed in the 1969 Atlantic hurricane season. It includes their name, duration, peak classification and intensities, areas affected, damage, and death totals. Deaths in parentheses are additional and indirect (an example of an indirect death would be a traffic accident), but were still related to that storm. Damage and deaths include totals while the storm was extratropical, a wave, or a low, and all of the damage figures are in 1969 USD.

<doc id="768668" wikidata="Q1141458" url="?curid=768668" title="Cape Verde hurricane">
<text>A Cape Verde hurricane or Cabo Verde hurricane is an Atlantic hurricane that originates at low-latitude in the tropical Atlantic from a tropical wave that has passed over or near the Cape Verde islands after exiting the coast of West Africa. The average Atlantic hurricane season has about two Cape Verde hurricanes, which are often the largest and most intense storms of the season due to having plenty of warm open ocean over which to develop before encountering land or other factors prompting weakening. A good portion of Cape Verde storms are large, and some, such as hurricanes Allen, Ivan, Dean, and Irma have set various records. Most of the longest-lived tropical cyclones in the Atlantic basin are Cape Verde hurricanes. While many move harmlessly out to sea, some move across the Caribbean Sea and into the Gulf of Mexico, becoming damaging storms for Caribbean nations, Central America, Mexico, Bermuda, the United States, and occasionally even Canada. Research projects since the 1970s have been launched to understand the formation of these storms and their movement through the Main Development Region.

==Origin==
Prior to the early 1940s, the term Cape Verde hurricane referred to August and early September storms that formed to the east of the surface plotting charts in use at the time. Cape Verde hurricanes typically develop from tropical waves which form in the African savanna during the wet season, then move into the African steppes. The disturbances move off the western coast of Africa and become tropical cyclones soon after moving off the coast, within 10 to 15 degrees latitude, or to , of the Cape Verde Islands; this comprises the tropical latitudes east of the 40th meridian west.

==Research==
Twenty nations took part in the GATE research project in 1974, where Douglas DC-6 aircraft examined tropical waves which spawned Cape Verde hurricanes. In 2006, there was a two-month research project known as NAMMA-06 (short for NASA African Monsoon Multidisciplinary Activities) which flew Douglas DC-8s into seedling disturbances in the eastern Atlantic which had the potential to become Cape Verde hurricanes.

<text>Virgin Drinks was a company that marketed Virgin Cola and Virgin Vodka. It was a subsidiary of the Virgin Group owned by Richard Branson.

The company was started in 1994 in conjunction with Cott to oversee and manage the product of Virgin Cola, Virgin&#x27;s first-ever drink. The company was first based in Folkestone, Kent, in the United Kingdom. Virgin Cola was launched in early 1994. The drink had big enough success for Virgin Drinks to go on to produce Virgin Vodka.

The company had previously also tried to market a range of beverages in the same functional energy class as Red Bull and Red Devil. These beverages were available in three different flavours (including Lemon and Lime) and were marketed in day-time versions (Virgin DT) and night-time versions (Virgin NT, a FAB with added vodka). These were only around for a very short amount of time.

After thirteen years, the brand started to massively decline as rival Coca-Cola had made exclusive distribution deals in big stores and restaurants. This led to Virgin only being sold in select supermarkets and local stores. Virgin Group decided it could not compete with cola rivals. In 2007, Virgin Drinks sold over the rights of Virgin Cola to a company called Silver Spring Soft Drinks. Virgin Vodka was discontinued when Virgin Drinks failed to find a buyer. Virgin Drinks were made defunct in 2007.

<text>Virgin Cola was a carbonated cola soft drink, launched in 1994. In 2009, it was discontinued in the United Kingdom, and in 2014 it was stopped being made by its final licensee, in Bangladesh.

== History ==
Virgin Cola was set up during the early 1990s in conjunction with Cott, an American-Canadian company that specialises in bottling own-label drinks. Cott was looking for a major international brand that could have worldwide appeal. Virgin Group founder, Richard Branson was looking to widen the Virgin name and to rival the Coca-Cola and Pepsi brands.

Virgin Cola began to hit international shores within its first year. The UK first served the drink on Virgin Atlantic flights, on-board shops on Virgin Trains and also at Virgin Cinemas. The Gulliver&#x27;s Kingdom chain of theme parks in the UK also sold post-mix Virgin Cola. This led Virgin Cola to agree a distribution deal with British supermarket retailer Tesco in 1994.

A promotional blimp can be seen saving a woman’s life on the show &quot;Baywatch&quot;, in the episode “The Runaways”, first aired in the U.S. on May 20, 1995. The episode features Richard Branson heavily.

From 1996, the 500ml bottles were marketed as &quot;The Pammy&quot;, as their curves were designed to resemble Pamela Anderson who was at the height of her popularity in the UK at the time. It went on to be launched in France, Belgium and South Africa.

In 1998, Branson attended the USA launch of Virgin Cola driving a T-54/55 tank into New York City&#x27;s Times Square. It subsequently agreed distribution channels with US retailers such as Target. Virgin Drinks USA, the company dealing in Virgin Cola&#x27;s US market, closed in April 2001, having managed to establish just a 0.5% share of the market by volume.

A bottle of Virgin Cola can be seen on the coffee table in Monica and Rachel&#x27;s apartment in the &quot;Friends&quot; episode &quot;The One with Joey&#x27;s Bag&quot; that first aired in the U.S. on 4 February 1999. Branson had previously appeared in an episode and was said to be a fan of the show. A can of Virgin Cola appears in &quot;Ally McBeal&quot; in the title character&#x27;s refrigerator in the episode &quot;Love Unlimited&quot;, first aired on 18 January 1999. In season 4 episode 10 of &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; (&quot;The Hush&quot;), Willow is seen drinking a can of Virgin Cola in a scene with Buffy.

In 2002, a vanilla cola called Virgin Vanilla was launched in the UK, ahead of the launch of a similar product from rival Coca-Cola. In 2004, it was announced that Virgin Vanilla would be discontinued in order to focus on the teenage market.

== Decline ==

According to Branson, a campaign was run by The Coca-Cola Company against Virgin Cola. Originally Coca-Cola did not treat Virgin as a serious competitor, but when Virgin started outselling Coke in the United Kingdom and entered the American market, Coke realised it needed to do something. At the suggestion of a British Coca-Cola executive, Coke assembled teams for an influencing campaign. Its intent was to make deals with retailers that sold Coke and Virgin Cola to get Virgin Cola removed from the shelves. Branson admitted Virgin did not know this was going on and it eventually led to a drop in sales. Branson did become aware that the drink had become discontinued in Tesco, the UK&#x27;s biggest supermarket. Later the Coke executive would work for Lloyds TSB and would become the manager of Virgin Group&#x27;s bank accounts to which Branson, when he found out from her at a dinner, said &quot;I wasn&#x27;t sure whether to strangle her or not&quot; but forgave her for it.

In 2007, Silver Spring acquired the UK licence from Princes Group, who had been operating Virgin Cola in a limited capacity. However, the company stopped producing Virgin Cola by early 2009, though would hold on to the license until it fell into administration in 2012.

In 2014, Global Beverage Company Limited, the final international licensee for Virgin Cola, based in Bangladesh, stopped producing the beverage, leading to its total demise. Branson claimed he decided to pull the plug after seeing that Bangladesh was the only remaining success.

<doc id="768688" wikidata="Q153355" url="?curid=768688" title="Michel Fourniret">
<text>Michel Paul Fourniret (4 April 1942 – 10 May 2021) was a French serial killer who confessed to killing 12 people in France and Belgium between 1987 and 2003. After he was arrested in June 2003 for the attempted kidnapping of a teenage girl in Ciney, Fourniret confessed in 2004 to killing nine people, eight females and one male, having been informed on by his then-wife, Monique Pierrette Olivier (born 31 October 1948). Fourniret was convicted of seven of these murders on 28 May 2008 and sentenced to life imprisonment without possibility of parole, while Olivier was given life with a minimum term of 28 years for complicity.

In February 2018, Fourniret confessed to killing two more women. On 16 November 2018, Fourniret and Olivier were convicted of the murder of Farida Hammiche, the last of the eight women that Fourniret confessed to killing in 2004. Fourniret was given a second life sentence and Olivier was sentenced to a further 20 years of imprisonment. In March 2020, Fourniret confessed to killing Estelle Mouzin, who disappeared from Guermantes in 2003.

==Early life==
Fourniret was born in Sedan, France, the son of a metal worker and a homemaker. Acquaintances remembered him as a quiet, intelligent child who enjoyed chess and classical music. He would later claim to have been sexually abused as a child by his mother. As an adult, he drifted through a series of menial jobs, including forestry worker and school supervisor.

Fourniret was first arrested in 1966 for sexually assaulting a young girl.

While imprisoned in 1984 for sexually assaulting another five young girls, Fourniret started corresponding with Monique Olivier via a prison pen pal programme. He wrote to her of his fantasies of raping and murdering virginal girls; she responded that she would &quot;help&quot; him fulfil those fantasies if he killed her husband, although he never committed this murder. After he was released from prison in 1987, they began a relationship. Soon afterwards, he not only raped but went on to murder young girls, with Olivier as his accomplice.

==Murders==
On 11 December 1987, Fourniret and Olivier drove, in separate vehicles, to Auxerre. Seeing 17-year-old Isabelle Laville walking home from school, a girl the couple had seen a day or two earlier and were targeting, Olivier stopped to ask her to join her in the car and give her directions, which Laville agreed to do. Driving down the road, Olivier reached the spot where Fourniret was standing with his car, pretending it had broken down. After Olivier, as planned, pretended to offer him a lift, he got into her car. Fourniret choked Laville with a piece of rope before Olivier sedated her with Rohypnol. The couple brought the girl to their home in Saint-Cyr-les-Colons, where Fourniret raped and strangled her. They threw Laville&#x27;s body down a disused well in Bussy-en-Othe. Her remains were recovered from the well more than eighteen years later, on 11 July 2006.

In March 1988, Fourniret was contacted by 30-year-old Farida Hammiche. She was the wife of Jean-Pierre Hellegouarch, an imprisoned bank robber with whom Fourniret had shared a cell prior to the latter&#x27;s release in October 1987. She asked Fourniret to help her unearth a haul from a cemetery in Fontenay-en-Parisis, which had been stolen by members of the &quot;Gang des postiches&quot;. After Fourniret and Hammiche managed to retrieve the haul, which consisted of gold ingots and coins, Hammiche gave Fourniret a share worth 500,000 francs for helping her dig it up and hiding it in her apartment in Vitry-sur-Seine. On 12 April, aiming to steal Hammiche&#x27;s share, Fourniret and Olivier lured Hammiche out of her home. They drove her to Clairefontaine-en-Yvelines, where they strangled her and buried her body. The couple then broke into Hammiche&#x27;s home and stole the haul. They used the money they made from it to buy a château called the Château du Sautou in Donchery. Hammiche&#x27;s body was never found.

By August, Olivier was pregnant with Fourniret&#x27;s baby. On 3 August, the couple drove to a supermarket in Châlons-sur-Marne (now Châlons-en-Champagne), and encountered 20-year-old Fabienne Leroy in the car park. With Olivier feigning illness, the couple asked Leroy to join them in their car and give them directions to a doctor&#x27;s surgery. After Leroy got in, the couple drove to a forest near the military camp of Mourmelon-le-Grand. Fourniret ordered Olivier to look at Leroy&#x27;s hymen to see if it was still intact, but Olivier refused. After raping Leroy, Fourniret shot her in the chest.

In January 1989, Fourniret met 21-year-old Jeanne-Marie Desramault on the evening train to Charleville-Mézières. The two conversed before arriving in Charleville, where Desramault was staying at a convent. Desramault met Fourniret and Olivier, who had assumed false identities, at the train station again on 18 March, and the couple invited Desramault to come to their house in Floing, an offer she accepted, and Fourniret promised he would drive her home afterwards. After they got to Floing, Fourniret asked Desramault if she was a virgin, and she told him she was not and that she had a boyfriend. Enraged, he attacked her. She fought back as he attempted to rape her, and as she attempted to escape, the couple gagged her with adhesive bandages before Fourniret strangled her. Fourniret and Olivier drove to Donchery and buried Desramault&#x27;s body in the garden of the Château du Sautou.

Fourniret and Olivier married in July 1989. On the afternoon of 20 December, they drove across the Franco-Belgian border to Saint-Servais, Namur, with their one-year-old son. Fourniret saw 12-year-old Elisabeth Brichet walk to a friend&#x27;s house, and waited outside for her until she left to walk the short distance home just before 7:00p.m. He asked her to give him directions to a doctor&#x27;s surgery for his son. She agreed to do so, and the couple drove back to Floing with her. When Fourniret undressed the girl, he saw that she was menstruating, so Olivier cleaned Brichet&#x27;s genitals. The next day, the couple took Brichet to the château, where Fourniret strangled her after a failed attempt to suffocate her with a plastic bag. Her body was buried in the garden of the château, near to that of Jeanne-Marie Desramault. There were a number of reported sightings of Brichet, in Belgium and abroad, in the years following her disappearance, and a number of people were suspected by police of abducting her, including another serial killer, Marc Dutroux. After Dutroux&#x27;s arrest in 1996, Brichet&#x27;s mother Marie-Noëlle Bouzet helped to organise the White March in honour of Belgium&#x27;s missing and murdered children. The remains of Brichet and Desramault were exhumed from the gardens of the Château du Sautou on 3 July 2004, after Fourniret and Olivier confessed to the killings.

The final known murder Fourniret committed with Olivier&#x27;s help took place on 21 November 1990 near France&#x27;s western coast. The couple drove to a shopping centre in Rezé after leaving court in Nantes, where they had been convicted of burglary. They saw Natacha Danais, a 13-year-old local girl, walking through the car park towards her home, having been sent to fetch her mother&#x27;s forgotten purse. The couple lured Danais into the van, asking her for directions. After driving to a secluded area near the coast, Fourniret stabbed Danais twice in the chest with a screwdriver and strangled her before leaving her body on the beach. Later investigation suggested that the girl&#x27;s body was raped after the murder. Eight days later, Jean Groix, a neighbour of Danais&#x27;s family, was arrested after a white van belonging to him matched the description of the van that Danais&#x27; sister had seen her get into from across the shopping centre&#x27;s car park at the time she disappeared. Groix was found to be lodging suspected members of the ETA in his home; police suspected that Danais had found out about this and that he killed her for that reason. Two months later, Groix committed suicide in his prison cell. He was reported to have been unable to bear the burden of having been accused of murder.

The Fourniret family moved to Sart-Custinne, Gedinne, Belgium, in the early 1990s. Fourniret admitted that he committed two more murders in France between 2000 and 2001, his first in nine-and-a-half-years. He drove alone across the Franco-Belgian border to Charleville-Mézières on 16 May 2000 and lured 18-year-old Céline Saison, who was on her way home from school, into his van in the late afternoon. Driving with her back to Belgium, he raped her before strangling her with a rope and dumping her body in a forest in Sugny, Vresse-sur-Semois. Saison&#x27;s skeletal remains were discovered there by mushroom pickers on 22 July 2000.

On 5 May 2001, Fourniret drove back to Sedan and met Mananya Thumpong, a 13-year-old girl of Thai origin whom he had met and given a lift home a few weeks earlier, outside the local library. He invited her to come to his house and play with his son. Accepting this offer, Thumpong climbed into the van and was driven to Nollevaux, Paliseul, where Fourniret strangled her. Thumpong&#x27;s remains were found on 1 March 2002, having been devoured almost entirely by wild animals.

==Arrest, trial and imprisonment==
Fourniret was arrested at his home in Sart-Custinne, Belgium, on 26 June 2003 after a failed attempt to kidnap a 13-year-old girl. He and Olivier were interrogated extensively but to no avail. A year later, Olivier told the police that her husband had killed a number of people since 1987. Fourniret confessed to killing eight women aged between 12 and 30, and a man who has never been identified. The bodies of four of the identified victims had been discovered in France and Belgium between 1988 and 2002.

Olivier was also arrested, and she and Fourniret were extradited to France, where they helped police find the bodies of three of the four missing victims over the next two years. The trial took place in Charleville-Mézières between 27 March and 28 May 2008. Fourniret was found guilty of the murders of all seven of the victims whose bodies had been found. He was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Olivier was sentenced to life with no possibility of parole for 28 years. Fourniret and Olivier were also ordered to pay €1.5 million in moral compensation to family members of the victims. Neither appealed their sentences.

Fourniret admitted to eight murders prior to his trial in 2008. He was convicted of seven of these and sentenced to life in prison.

In November 2023, the trial of his former wife and accomplice Monique Oliver for three murders, including Joanna Parrish and Estelle Mouzin, began 
== Confessions ==
In February 2018, Fourniret confessed to killing two more women in Auxerre: Marie-Angèle Domèce, an 18-year-old disabled woman, in July 1988, and Joanna Parrish, a 20-year-old British student, in May 1990.

In March 2020, Fourniret confessed to killing Estelle Mouzin, who disappeared from Guermantes in January 2003.

==Known victims==
 indicates victims of whose murders Fourniret was convicted.

== Other supposed crimes ==
Two French journalists have suggested that Fourniret killed former Minister for Labour Robert Boulin (who was involved in a real estate scandal at the time), based on a letter Fourniret wrote to Olivier.

Christian Ranucci was one of the last people executed in France, having been convicted of the abduction and murder, committed on 3 June 1974, of Marie-Dolorès Rambla, aged eight. There were suspicions that Ranucci might not have been the killer, having confessed and later retracted his confession. It was suggested that Fourniret may have been involved, as Fourniret was thought to be in the area at the time and had virtually the same car as Ranucci. Careful analysis by an expert of courtroom photographs taken during Ranucci&#x27;s March 1976 trial, however, suggests that the courtroom observer in the photographs could not have been Fourniret who, unlike this man, did not yet wear glasses and lacked a chin cleft. Furthermore, Fourniret denied having been in the Marseille area when the crime took place on 3 June 1974, claiming he was working in Paris.

==Legacy==
Rachida Dati, the then French Minister for Justice, who advocated legal reforms in France, wanted a more relaxed attitude to preventive custody and parole under supervision. She was heavily criticized by the judiciary. The proximity of the Chateau des Amerois in neighboring Belgium (approximately 30 km) to the Château du Sautou (commune of Donchery) bought by Fourniret was also mentioned.

==Death==
Fourniret died on 10 May 2021 at the age of 79 after being admitted to hospital with respiratory problems.

<text>Donald Howard Menzel (April 11, 1901 – December 14, 1976) was one of the first theoretical astronomers and astrophysicists in the United States. He discovered the physical properties of the solar chromosphere, the chemistry of stars, the atmosphere of Mars, and the nature of gaseous nebulae.

==Biography==
Born in Florence, Colorado in 1901 and raised in Leadville, he learned to read very early, and soon could send and receive messages in Morse code, taught by his father. He loved science and mathematics, collected ore and rock specimens, and as a teenager he built a large chemistry laboratory in the cellar. He made a radio transmitter at a time when kits were rarely available and qualified as a radio ham. He was an Eagle Scout, specializing in cryptanalysis, as well as an outdoorsman, hiking and fly fishing throughout much of his life. He married Florence Elizabeth Kreager on June 17, 1926. They had two daughters, Suzanne Kay and Elizabeth Ina.

At 16, he enrolled in the University of Denver to study chemistry. His interest in astronomy was aroused through a boyhood friend (Edgar Kettering), through observing the solar eclipse of June 8, 1918, and through observing the eruption of Nova Aquilae 1918 (V603 Aquilae). He graduated from the University of Denver in 1920 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in chemistry and stayed on to receive a master&#x27;s degree in chemistry and mathematics from the institution in 1921. He also found summer positions in 1922, 1923, and 1924 as research assistant to Harlow Shapley at the Harvard College Observatory.

At Princeton University he acquired a second master&#x27;s degree in astronomy in 1923, and in 1924 a Ph.D. in astrophysics for which his advisor was Henry Norris Russell, who inspired his interest in theoretical astronomy. After teaching for two years at the University of Iowa and Ohio State University, in 1926 he was appointed assistant professor at Lick Observatory of the University of California in San Jose, California, where he worked for several years. He moved to Harvard University in 1932.

During World War II, Menzel was commissioned as a lieutenant commander in the United States Navy and asked to head a division of intelligence, where he used his many-sided talents, including deciphering enemy codes. Even until 1955, he worked with the Navy improving radio-wave propagation by tracking the Sun&#x27;s emissions and studying the effect of the aurora on radio propagation for the Department of Defense (Menzel &amp; Boyd, p. 60). Returning to Harvard after the war, he was appointed acting director of the Harvard Observatory in 1952, and was the full director from 1954 to 1966. His colleague Dr. Dorrit Hoffleit recalls one of his first actions in the position was asking his secretary to destroy a third of the plates sight unseen, resulting in their permanent loss from the record. The term &quot;Menzel Gap&quot; was used to refer to the 1953–1968 absence of astronomical photographic plates when plate-making operations were temporarily halted by Menzel as a cost-cutting measure. He retired from Harvard in 1971. From 1964 to his death, Menzel was a U.S. State Department consultant for Latin American affairs.

Menzel was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1934, the American Philosophical Society in 1943, and the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1948. He received honorary A.M. and Sc.D. degrees from Harvard University in 1942 and the University of Denver in 1954 respectively. From 1946 to 1948 he was the vice president of the American Astronomical Society, becoming their president from 1954 to 1956. In 1965, Menzel was given the John Evans Award of the University of Denver. In May 2001, the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard &amp; Smithsonian hosted &quot;Donald H. Menzel: Scientist, Educator, Builder,&quot; a symposium in honor of the 100th anniversary of the birth of Donald H. Menzel.

Menzel traveled with several expeditions to view solar eclipses to obtain scientific data. On 19 June 1936, he led the Harvard-MIT expedition to the steppes of Russia (at Akbulak in Orenburg Oblast, southern Ural) to observe a total eclipse. For the 9 July 1945 eclipse, he directed the Joint U.S.-Canadian expedition to Saskatchewan, although they were clouded out. Menzel observed many total solar eclipses, often leading the expeditions, including Catalina, California (10 September 1923, cloudy), Camptonville, California (28 April 1930), Fryeburg, Maine (31 August 1932), Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minnesota (30 June 1954), the Atlantic coast of Massachusetts (2 October 1959), northern Italy (15 February 1951), Orono, Maine (20 July 1963, cloudy), Athens/Sunion Road, Greece (20 May 1966), Arequipa, Peru (12 November 1966), Miahuatlan, south of Oaxaca, Mexico (7 March 1970), Prince Edward Island Canada (10 July 1972), and western Mauritania (30 June 1973), in addition to the other three mentioned above. He proudly held the informal record for greatest number of observed solar eclipses, a &quot;title&quot; later broken by his student, colleague, and co-author Jay Pasachoff.
In the late 1930s he built an observatory for solar research at Climax, CO, using a telescope that mimicked a total eclipse of the sun, allowing him and his colleagues to study the solar corona and to film the spouting flames, called prominences, emitted by the Sun. Menzel initially performed solar research, but later concentrated on studying gaseous nebulae. His work with Lawrence Aller and James Gilbert Baker defined many of the fundamental principles of the study of planetary nebulae. He wrote the first edition (1964) of &quot;A Field Guide to the Stars and Planets&quot;, part of the Peterson Field Guides. In one of his last papers, Menzel concluded, based on his analysis of the Schwarzschild equations, that black holes do not exist, and he declared them to be a myth.

He also believed in the EPH (exploded planet hypothesis), stating, &#x27;Presque toutes ces petites planètes circulent entre les orbites de Mars et Jupiter. On admet qu&#x27;elles représentent les fragments dispersés d&#x27;une grande planète qui se serait désintégrée.&#x27;

Menzel was a science fiction author; his &quot;Fin&#x27;s Funeral&quot; appeared in &quot;Galaxy Science Fiction&quot; in 1965. He was also an artist, creating watercolor paintings of alien creatures and scenes which often featured 3-dimensional &quot;holes&quot; though characters, clouds, and alien spaceships.

==Menzel&#x27;s &quot;Field Guide&quot;==

Menzel wrote the first edition of &quot;A Field Guide to the Stars and Planets&quot;, published in 1975 by HarperCollins, which rapidly became a best-seller. Subsequent editions were prepared after Menzel&#x27;s death by his student Jay Pasachoff; the current version is one of the Peterson Field Guides.

In Chapter IV of the first edition, Menzel apportions all 88 of the modern constellations recognized by the International Astronomical Union into eight broad families, as a way to help observers remember where the constellations are located.

The families are organized by common location or common theme. The Ursa Major, Perseus, Hercules, and Orion families include mainly constellations in the general vicinity of those four constellations. The Zodiac family includes the traditional twelve Zodiac constellations. The Heavenly Waters family includes mostly constellations generally associated with water. The Bayer family includes southern constellations first introduced by Plancius and subsequently included in Johann Bayer&#x27;s &quot;Uranometria&quot; in 1603. The La Caille family includes most of the constellations introduced by Lacaille in 1756 from stars charted during his observations at Cape Town.

==Menzel and UFOs==

In addition to his academic and popular contributions to the field of astronomy, Menzel was a prominent skeptic concerning the reality of UFOs. He authored or co-authored three popular books debunking UFOs: &quot;Flying Saucers - Myth - Truth - History&quot; (1953), &quot;The World of Flying Saucers&quot; (1963, co-authored with Lyle G Boyd), and &quot;The UFO Enigma&quot; (1977, co-authored with Ernest H. Taves). All of Menzel&#x27;s UFO books argued that UFOs are nothing more than misidentification of prosaic phenomena such as stars, clouds and airplanes; or the result of people seeing unusual atmospheric phenomena they were unfamiliar with. He was among the first prominent scientists to offer an opinion on the matter. One of Menzel&#x27;s earliest public involvements in UFO matters was his appearance on a radio documentary directed and narrated by Edward R. Murrow in mid-1950. (Swords, 98)

Menzel claimed to have his own UFO experience on 3 March 1955 while returning from the North Pole on the daily Air Force Weather &quot;Ptarmigan&quot; flight. His account is in both Menzel &amp; Boyd and Menzel &amp; Taves, in which he identified the &#x27;flying saucer&#x27; he observed, as a mirage of Sirius (Steuart Campbell claimed that it was a mirage of Saturn). Menzel often explained that atmospheric hazes or temperature inversions could distort stars or planets, and make them appear to be larger than in reality, unusual in their shape, and in motion.

In 1968, Menzel testified before the U.S. House Committee on Science and Astronautics – Symposium on UFOs, stating that he considered all UFO sightings to have natural explanations.

==Legacy==

In 1922 he discovered the Menzel 3 nebula, informally known as the Ant Nebula. The minor planet 1967 Menzel was named in his honor, as well as a small lunar crater located in the southeast of Mare Tranquilitatis, the Sea of Tranquility.

<doc id="768700" wikidata="Q783591" url="?curid=768700" title="Nacirema">
<text>Nacirema (&quot;American&quot; spelled backwards) is a term used in anthropology and sociology in relation to aspects of the behavior and society of citizens of the United States of America. The neologism attempts to create a deliberate sense of self-distancing in order that American anthropologists might look at their own culture more objectively.

==&quot;Body Ritual among the Nacirema&quot;==

The original use of the term in a social science context was in &quot;Body Ritual among the Nacirema&quot;, which satirizes anthropological papers on &quot;other&quot; cultures, and the culture of the United States. Horace Mitchell Miner wrote the paper and originally published it in the June 1956 edition of &quot;American Anthropologist&quot;.

In the paper, Miner describes the Nacirema, a little-known tribe living in North America. The way in which he writes about the curious practices that this group performs distances readers from the fact that the North American group described actually corresponds to modern-day Americans of the mid-1950s.

Miner presents the Nacirema as a group living in the territory between the Canadian Cree, the Yaqui and Tarahumare of Mexico, and the Carib and Arawak of the Antilles. The paper describes the typical Western ideal for oral cleanliness, as well as providing an outside view on hospital care and on psychiatry. The Nacirema are described as having a highly developed market economy that has evolved within a rich natural habitat.

Miner&#x27;s article became a popular work, reprinted in many introductory textbooks and used as an example of process analysis in the literature text &quot;The Bedford Reader&quot;. The article received the most reprint permission requests of any article in &quot;American Anthropologist&quot;.

Some of the popular aspects of Nacirema culture include: medicine men and women (doctors, psychiatrists, and pharmacists), a charm-box (medicine cabinet), the mouth-rite ritual (brushing teeth), and a cultural hero known as Notgnihsaw (Washington spelled backwards). These ritual purification practices are prescribed as how humans should comport themselves in the presence of sacred things. These sacred aspects are the rituals that the Nacirema partake in throughout their lives.

==&quot;The mysterious fall of the Nacirema&quot;==
In 1972 Neil B. Thompson revisited the Nacirema after the fall of their civilization. Thompson&#x27;s paper, unlike Miner&#x27;s, primarily offered a social commentary focused on environmental issues. Thompson paid special attention to the Elibomotua (automobile backwards) cult and its efforts to modify the environment.

This article is reprinted and appears as the final chapter in an anthology, &quot;Nacirema: Readings on American Culture&quot;. The volume contains an array of scholarly investigations into American social anthropology as well as one more article in the Nacirema series, by Willard Walker of Wesleyan University: &quot;The Retention of Folk Linguistic Concepts and the ti&#x27;ycir (teacher) Caste in Contemporary Nacireman Culture&quot; which laments the corrosive and subjugating ritual of attending &quot;sguwlz&quot; (schools). On phonology, the anthropologist notes:

This refers to the traditional enumeration of the 5 vowel letters in the English alphabet (A, E, I, O, and U), which is in contrast to the much larger number (varying between accents) of distinct vowel sounds in the language (see English phonology#Vowels).

==Nacirema vs. Teamsterville==
Gerry Philipsen (1992) studies what he terms &quot;speech codes&quot; among the Nacirema, which he contrasts with the speech codes of another semi-fictionalized group of Americans, the inhabitants of Teamsterville culture. His Nacirema comprises primarily middle-class west-coast Americans.

<text>New Poets of England and America was a poetry anthology edited by Donald Hall, Robert Pack and Louis Simpson, and published in 1957. In the post-war story about relations between American and British poetry, it represents the moment of closest &quot;rapprochement&quot;, actual or intended. The introduction was written by Robert Frost. The inclusion of a number of British &quot;Movement&quot; poets, as well as others, implies some kind of search for matching figures amongst the Americans. Poets had to be under forty years old to be included.

<text>Robert Ellsworth Pollard Jr. (born October 31, 1957) is an American singer and songwriter. He is the leader of indie rock group Guided by Voices. In addition to this, he has also released 22 solo albums.

He has nearly 3,000 songs registered to his name with BMI. In 2006, &quot;Paste&quot; magazine listed him as the 78th-greatest living songwriter. In 2007, he was nominated for the Shortlist Music Prize.

== Early life and education ==
Pollard was born in Dayton, Ohio, where he has lived all his life. During most of his childhood and adolescence, sports were his main interest. When Pollard began to show interest in music during high school, his father tried to discourage this. Pollard attended Northridge High School in the Dayton suburb of Northridge, followed by Wright State University in Fairborn, Ohio, where he once pitched a no-hitter for the baseball team.

As a teenager Pollard was in a heavy metal cover band called Anacrusis, and went to arena shows which he likens to those featured in the documentary &quot;Heavy Metal Parking Lot&quot;. Pollard has said that much of the inspiration for his songwriting has come from time spent hanging out with his high school friends from Dayton, a group he calls &quot;The Monument Club&quot;. Pollard said of his teenage years:
Growing up, I didn&#x27;t really have any musical talent. I could always sing, but that&#x27;s it. So I started hanging around with all these weirdoes from Northridge who could play guitar. And I would just watch them, &#x27;Wow, I&#x27;ve got to learn how to do that.&#x27; That song &#x27;Hank&#x27;s Little Fingers&#x27; (on Devil Between My Toes) – Hank (Davidson) is the guy that inspired me to play the guitar. He had a deformed hand with these little bitty fingers.

After graduating from high school in 1975, Pollard bought a guitar with his graduation money. In college, he began singing in rock bands. Although throwing a no-hitter in college, he eventually abandoned athletics realizing that he wasn&#x27;t quick enough to be a professional and that his character was too independent to be obedient to the strict athletic program. &quot;I was sick of people snapping their fingers and expecting me to move.&quot; When he heard the news, Pollard&#x27;s father withdrew his financial support, forcing his son to get a job washing dishes. Towards the end of his senior year at Wright State University, Pollard married Kim Dowler, a home-town girl he had been dating for seven years. Dowler did not go to college herself, but started working right out of high school.

After Pollard&#x27;s college graduation, Dowler supported him for a little while, but he then got a job as a school teacher. It was a job with a lot of vacation time and this meant Pollard was able to pursue his music. But the job rubbed off on him, and Pollard has stated that his years as a teacher inspired songs such as &quot;Gold Star For Robot Boy&quot;, &quot;Teenage FBI&quot; and &quot;Non-Absorbing&quot;. Pollard has worked at all levels of primary school, from elementary school to middle school to high school. He found the most difficult assignment to be teaching physical science to junior high schoolers. Eventually he settled on teaching fourth graders.

He said of his teaching years: &quot;I never went to the teachers&#x27; lounge. But the teachers liked me. In elementary school, there aren&#x27;t a lot of male teachers, so they liked the fact I was around. They&#x27;d say, &#x27;Why don&#x27;t you come down and hang out with us in the teachers&#x27; lounge?&#x27; But I would go off and take a nap to try to get rid of my hangover. I had 14 years of that.&quot;

== Career ==
=== Beginnings ===
Pollard started playing music in local cover bands in Dayton, and got involved in a songwriters&#x27; guild, but he longed to be the leader of a band. In 1981, he began playing original songs with fellow Northridge High School alums Kevin Fennell and Mitch Mitchell. For two years they recorded in the basement of Pollard&#x27;s house, and played out under a variety of names (including Instant Lovelies, Acid Ranch and Coyote Call). Then in 1983 Pollard eventually dubbed the project &quot;Guided by Voices&quot;. At the time he was working part-time as an elementary school teacher.

In total, Guided by Voices released 16 full-length original albums between 1987 and 2004, as well as a large number of EPs and compilations. Although known as a lo-fi band that relied on home recordings, in later years the group relied more on professional recording studios and worked with producers such as Ric Ocasek.

Initially, Guided by Voices was a band in name only, its members being a revolving cast of musicians, most of whom Pollard kicked out of the band at one time or another. &quot;In the early days of Guided by Voices, when no one was listening, I was impatient&quot;, Pollard wrote in 2005. &quot;I used to tire of people in the band very quickly. I had physical altercations with them. I even resorted to bullshit tactics, like telling the band I was quitting and we were breaking up, then forming again a month later with new members.&quot;

To finance the band&#x27;s early recordings, Pollard, his brother, and their manager obtained a loan from the Dayton Public Schools credit union. Between 1986 and 1992, they released six records in this way, recording, pressing and distributing them at their own expense. These records got very little response, and although the pressings ran only to between 300 and 1,000 copies of each, the producers were left with many copies on their hands. In 1992, bowing to the lack of support from family and friends, and to the pressure of unpaid debt, Pollard broke up Guided by Voices after releasing &quot;Propeller&quot;, which he felt was their best album to date. He then committed to teaching school full-time.

However, &quot;Propeller&quot; impressed the indie label Scat Records, who signed the band to a recording contract. The result was that Guided by Voices got back together in 1993, and played a show that year at the New Music Seminar in New York City – the band&#x27;s first live date in almost six years. With the release of &quot;Vampire on Titus&quot; (1993), the band was finally able to perform live around the United States.

In August 2004, the band released &quot;Half Smiles of the Decomposed&quot;, which was intended to be their final album. In 2004, on New Year&#x27;s Eve, Guided by Voices performed their last show at The Metro in Chicago. In 2010 the main 1990s line-up reunited for Matador Records&#x27; 21st birthday. A full tour followed and the band remained together until September 2014.

Guided by Voices released its first album in seven years on January 1, 2012, &quot;Let&#x27;s Go Eat the Factory&quot;. On January 3, the band appeared on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; to promote the LP. They released their second post-reunion album, &quot;Class Clown Spots a UFO&quot;, on June 11. A third album, &quot;The Bears for Lunch&quot;, came out on November 13. The fourth post-reunion album (and twentieth Guided by Voices album), &quot;English Little League&quot;, was released on April 30, 2013. &quot;Motivational Jumpsuit&quot; and &quot;Cool Planet&quot; followed in February and May 2014, respectively. In September 2014, the band announced they were disbanding once again and cancelled all remaining dates on their tour.

=== Solo career ===
Pollard began releasing solo records in 1996, alongside regular releases from Guided by Voices. These albums were typically recorded with a small group consisting of current or former Guided by Voices members, and they were generally considered to informally be part of the Guided by Voices canon, as that band would regularly perform selections from the solo releases in concert.

After the dissolution of Guided by Voices in 2004, Robert Pollard launched his official solo career with the release of &quot;From a Compound Eye&quot; in February 2006. Pollard&#x27;s recent studio work has eschewed the live-band format, instead relying on the multi-instrumental talents of Todd Tobias, who produced several Guided by Voices albums. In 2006, Pollard resumed touring with a new band informally dubbed &quot;The Ascended Masters&quot;, which featured Tommy Keene on lead guitar and keyboards, Dave Phillips on guitar, Jon Wurster on drums, and Jason Narducy on bass, but subsequent to the cancellation of some 2006 dates due to a leg injury, Pollard announced his retirement from touring.
Despite this, Pollard performed two shows in support of his new albums. The first show was on November 30, 2007, in Chicago at The Metro. The second was on December 1, 2007, in Newport, Kentucky (across the Ohio River from Cincinnati) at the Southgate House. After releasing &quot;Superman Was a Rocker&quot; in January, he announced that he would be leaving Merge Records to form Guided by Voices, Inc., his own record label that will produce his entire musical library.

=== Other bands and projects ===
Pollard has also issued recordings under a variety of other band names and in collaboration with former GBV colleagues and other musicians. In 2008, he formed a new band, Boston Spaceships, comprising Pollard, John Moen of The Decemberists and Perhapst, and Chris Slusarenko, who played in the final incarnation of Guided by Voices. The band&#x27;s first album, &quot;Brown Submarine&quot;, was released on September 16, 2008, on Guided by Voices, Inc., and was followed by a tour in the fall of that year. A follow-up, &quot;The Planets Are Blasted&quot;, was released on February 17, 2009, with another album &quot;Zero to 99&quot; released in October 2009. &quot;Our Cubehouse Still Rocks&quot; was released in September 2010.
Boston Spaceships released their fifth and final album &quot;Let It Beard&quot; on August 2, 2011

== Other projects ==
=== Fading Captain series ===
During the mid-90s, in addition to GbV albums appearing annually, Pollard&#x27;s prolificacy typically was vented onto innumerable singles, EPs, compilations and other side releases. However, once signed to a major label and constrained to the expectation of producing only a single album per 18 months, Pollard began the self-financed and released Fading Captain Series, a series of releases both under his own name, and a wide variety of pseudonyms. In addition to solo and archival releases, Pollard began collaborating with fellow musicians and friends by mail via a process dubbed &quot;postal rock&quot; – Pollard would receive completed musical backing tracks, and add his own lyrics and vocals. Albums under the Airport 5, Circus Devils, and Go Back Snowball monikers, among others were produced in this fashion.

In December 2006, Pollard announced that the Fading Captain Series was being concluded with the release of &quot;&quot;, a 50-song &quot;best of&quot; collection spanning from 1999 through 2007.

=== Other record labels ===
When Pollard announced that the Fading Captain Series was being concluded he also announced that he was starting up a new record label, then called Record Company Records but later re-titled as Prom is Coming, which is named after a song off his first solo album &quot;Not in My Airforce&quot;. The first (and thus far only) release on Prom is Coming was &quot;Silverfish Trivia&quot;.

In spring 2007, Pollard began a singles collection called the &quot;Happy Jack Rock Records Single Series&quot; in which one 7-inch record was released per month for 12 months starting June 22, 2007. All the records featured an A-side from Pollard&#x27;s dueling Merge releases that year (&quot;Standard Gargoyle Decisions&quot; and &quot;Coast to Coast Carpet of Love&quot;) and a non-album B-side. 1,000 of each 7-inch was pressed.

Pollard&#x27;s album &quot;Superman Was a Rocker&quot; was the first LP released on Happy Jack Rock Records (although the vinyl version of Circus Devils&#x27; &quot;Sgt. Disco&quot; had been released on the same label in 2007). Pollard continues to release 7-inch records on the label. June 2009 will see the first release from a new Happy Jack project Cosmos, a collaboration with Richard Davies titled &quot;Jar of Jam Ton of Bricks&quot;.

In 2008, Pollard announced the forming of yet another new label Guided by Voices Inc. The first album release on Guided by Voices Inc. was &quot;Robert Pollard Is Off To Business&quot;, preceded by the 12-inch EP &quot;Weatherman And Skin Goddess&quot;. Pollard&#x27;s first two Boston Spaceships releases have been on Guided by Voices Inc.

=== EAT and Town of Mirrors ===
In the fall of 2003 Pollard released &quot;EAT&quot;, a literary magazine consisting of original poems and collages by Pollard. As of 2023 &quot;EAT&quot; is on its eighteenth issue. Pollard&#x27;s collage art is featured on many Guided by Voices albums (notable exceptions being the two released on TVT Records).

In 2008, Pollard&#x27;s collages were collected and published in &quot;Town of Mirrors: The Reassembled Imagery of Robert Pollard&quot;. &quot;Town of Mirrors&quot; features Pollard&#x27;s visual art and lyrics/poetry. There are over 175 collages, 20 of which were created specifically for the book&#x27;s release.

== Personal life ==

Pollard had two children with Kim Dowler. He wrote a song about each: &quot;Your Name is Wild&quot; about his daughter Erika and &quot;My Son Cool&quot; being about his son Bryan. However, the success of Guided by Voices in the mid 1990s coincided with the breakdown of their marriage. In 2007 Pollard married Sarah Zade. The couple currently lives in Dayton, Ohio.

&quot;I&#x27;ve never considered myself to be a runaway success at anything I&#x27;ve done, including parenthood&quot;, Pollard wrote in 2005. &quot;But I&#x27;ve at least allowed my children to pursue their own interests without too much interference, and I think they both turned out pretty good.&quot;

<text>The  (; sign: ℛ︁ℳ︁; abbreviation: RM) was the currency of Germany from 1924 until the fall of Nazi Germany in 1945, and in the American, British and French occupied zones of Germany, until 20 June 1948. The Reichsmark was then replaced by the Deutsche Mark, to become the currency of West Germany and then all of Germany after the 1990 reunification. The Reichsmark was used in the Soviet occupation zone of Germany until 23 June 1948, where it was replaced by the East German mark. The Reichsmark was subdivided into 100 (Rpf or ℛ︁₰). The Mark is an ancient Germanic weight measure, traditionally a half pound, later used for several coins; (&quot;realm&quot; in English) comes from the official name for the German state from 1871 to 1945, .

==History==
The Reichsmark was introduced in 1924 as a permanent replacement for the &quot;Papiermark&quot;. This was necessary due to the 1920s German inflation which had reached its peak in 1923. The exchange rate between the old &quot;Papiermark&quot; and the Reichsmark was = 1012 ℳ︁ (one trillion in American English and French, one billion in German and other European languages and British English of the time; see long and short scale). To stabilize the economy and to smooth the transition, the &quot;Papiermark&quot; was not directly replaced by the Reichsmark, but by the &quot;Rentenmark&quot;, an interim currency backed by the &quot;Deutsche Rentenbank&quot;, owning industrial and agricultural real estate assets. The Reichsmark was put on the gold standard at the rate previously used by the German mark, with the U.S. dollar worth .

=== Expansion outside the Reichsmark ===
During this period a number of shell companies were created and authorized to issue bonds outside the Reichsmark in order to finance state projects. Nominally exchangeable at a 1:1 rate for Reichsmarks but then discounted by the Reichsbank this created secret monetary expansion without formally renouncing the gold standard of the Reichsmark.

===World War II===
With the annexation of the Federal State of Austria by Germany in 1938, the Reichsmark replaced the Austrian schilling. During the Second World War, Germany established fixed exchange rates between the Reichsmark and the currencies of the occupied and allied countries, often set so as to give economic benefits to German soldiers and civilian contractors, who were paid their wages in local currency. The rates were as follows:

=== Post-war ===
After the Second World War, the Reichsmark continued to circulate in Germany, but with new banknotes (Allied Occupation Marks) printed in the US and in the Soviet Zone, as well as with coins (without swastikas). Inflation in the final months of the war had reduced the value of the Reichsmark from = $1US to = $1US and a barter economy had emerged due to the rapid depreciation. The Reichsmark was replaced by the Deutsche Mark at a rate of 10:1 (1:1 for cash and current accounts) in June 1948 in the Trizone and later in the same year by the East German mark in the Soviet Occupation Zone (colloquially also &quot;Ostmark&quot;, since 1968 officially &quot;Mark der DDR&quot;). The 1948 currency reform under the direction of Ludwig Erhard is considered the beginning of the West German economic recovery; however, the secret plan to introduce the Deutsche Mark in the Trizone was formulated by economist Edward A. Tenenbaum of the US military government, and was executed abruptly on 21 June 1948. Three days later, the new currency also replaced the Reichsmark in the three Western sectors of Berlin. In November 1945, the Reichsmark was superseded by the Second Austrian schilling in Austria. In 1947, the Saar mark, later replaced with the Saar franc, was introduced in the Saar.

==Coins==

=== Denominations ===
In 1924, coins were introduced in denominations of 1 ℛ︁₰, 2 ℛ︁₰, 5 ℛ︁₰, 10 ℛ︁₰, and 50 ℛ︁₰, and 1 ℳ︁ and 3 ℳ︁.

=== 4 ===
4  coins were issued in 1932 as part of a failed attempt by the Reichskanzler Heinrich Brüning to reduce prices through use of 4 ℛ︁₰ pieces instead of 5 ℛ︁₰ coins. Known as the or (&#x27;poor Heinrich&#x27;), they were demonetized the following year. See . The quality of the Reichsmark coins decreased more and more towards the end of World War II and misprints happened more frequently. Since the 4 ℛ︁₰ coin was only slightly larger than the 1 ℳ︁ coin and the imperial eagle looked similar, an attempt was made to pass it off as a 1-reichsmark coin by silvering the 4 ℛ︁₰ coin.

===10 ===
The zinc 10 coin was minted by Nazi Germany between 1940 and 1945 during World War II, replacing the aluminium-bronze version, which had a distinct golden colour. It is worth or .10 of a Reichsmark. Made entirely of zinc, the 10 ℛ︁₰ is an emergency issue type, similar to the zinc 1 ℛ︁₰ and 5 ℛ︁₰, and the aluminium 50 ℛ︁₰ coins from the same period.

==Mint marks==
Nazi Germany had a number of mints. Each mint location had its own identifiable letter. It is therefore possible to identify exactly which mint produced what coin by noting the mint mark on the coin. Not all mints were authorized to produce coins every year. The mints were also only authorized to produce a set number of coins with some mints allocated a greater production than others. Some of the coins with particular mint marks are therefore scarcer than others. With the silver and coins, the mint mark is found under the date on the left side of the coin. On the smaller denomination Reichspfennig coins, the mint mark is found on the bottom center of the coin.

==Mintage==





==Banknotes==

The first Reichsmark banknotes were introduced by the Reichsbank and state banks such as those of Bavaria, Saxony and Baden. The first Reichsbank issue of 1924 came in denominations of , , , , and . This was followed by a second issue in the same denominations, dated between 1929 and 1936. The second issue commemorated persons who made contributions to German agriculture, industry, economy, science, and architecture: issued in 1929 commemorated agronomist Albrecht Thaer; issued in 1929 commemorated engineer, inventor, and industrialist Werner von Siemens; issued in 1933 commemorated Prussian politician and banker David Hansemann; 100 ℛ︁ℳ︁ issued in 1935 commemorated chemist and &quot;father of fertilizer industry&quot; Justus von Liebig; issued in 1936 commemorated Prussian architect Karl Friedrich Schinkel.

A newer version of note was introduced in 1939, using a design taken from an unissued Austrian S100 banknote type. notes were issued in 1942. Throughout this period, the Rentenbank also issued banknotes denominated in Rentenmark, mostly in RM 1 and RM 2 denominations.

In preparation for the occupation of Germany, the United States issued occupation banknotes dated 1944, printed by the Forbes Lithograph Printing Company of Boston. These were printed in similar colours with different sizes for groups of denominations. Notes were issued for  ℳ︁, 1 ℳ︁, 5 ℳ︁, 10 ℳ︁, 20 ℳ︁, 50 ℳ︁, 100 ℳ︁, and 1,000 ℳ︁. The issuer was the (&#x27;Allied military authorities&#x27;) with (&#x27;in legal circulation in Germany&#x27;) printed on the obverse.

These notes were convertible to US dollars at a rate of 10:1. Seeing an opportunity to procure foreign hard currency, the Soviet Union demanded copies of the engraving plates, ink, and associated equipment in early 1944, and on 14 April 1944 Henry Morgenthau and Harry Dexter White of the U.S. Treasury Department authorized the air transfer of these to the USSR. Using a printing plant in occupied Leipzig, the Soviet authorities printed large runs of occupation marks to fill Soviet coffers with dollars causing inflation and financial instability. An investigation by the United States Congress (Occupation Currency Transactions Hearings before the Committee on Appropriations, Armed Services and Banking and Currency, U.S. Senate, 1947) found that about $380,000,000 &quot;more currency than there were appropriations for&quot; had been circulated.

In 1947 Rhineland-Palatinate issued 5₰ and 10₰ notes with on them.

==Occupation Reichsmark==
Coins and banknotes for circulation in the occupied territories during the war were issued by the &quot;Reichskreditkassen&quot;. Holed, zinc coins in 5 ℛ︁₰ and 10 ℛ︁₰ denominations were struck in 1940 and 1941. Banknotes were issued between 1939 and 1945 in denominations of 50 ℛ︁₰, , , , , and . These served as legal tender alongside the currency of the occupied countries.

The coins were originally planned in great numbers of 100 million and 250 million each of the 5 ℛ︁₰ and 10 ℛ︁₰ coins respectively. The first embossing order, which was issued in April 1940, was about 40 million × 5 ℛ︁₰ and 100 million × 10 ℛ︁₰. The total amount was divided between each of the seven German mints after the embossing key of 1939. The contract was stopped in August 1940 as the Wehrmacht, which had requested the coins for Belgium and France, had no more need of it. When the embossing stopped, only Berlin (&quot;A&quot;) and Munich (&quot;D&quot;) produced significant quantities, but they still came to only a small extent of original production plans. The majority were melted down due to the limited supply of metal and thus, most mint marks are now quite rare (except for 1940 5 A and D, and 1940 10 A).

==Concentration camp and POW Reichsmark currency==
Various special issues of Reichsmark currency were issued for use in concentration and prisoner of war (POW) camps (&quot;Stalag&quot;). None were legal tender in Germany itself. From 1942 to 1943 tokens were struck for use within the Łódź Ghetto.

==Military Reichsmark currency==

Special issues of Reichsmark currency were issued for use by the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; from 1942 to 1944. The first issue was denominated in 1 ℛ︁₰, 5 ℛ︁₰, 10 ℛ︁₰, and 50 ℛ︁₰ and , but was valued at 1 military Reichspfennig = 10 civilian Reichspfennig. This series was printed on only one side. The second issue notes of , , , and were equal in value to the ordinary German Reichsmark and were printed on both sides.

The 5 Mark note pictured, front and back, is Allied military currency (&quot;AMC&quot;) printed at Forbes Lithograph Manufacturing Company in Boston for occupied Germany. There were different AMCs for each liberated area of Europe.

== History ==
The Sagami Railway was established in Chigasaki, Kanagawa, in January 1917, to transport gravel along the Sagami River valley. The first section, between Chigasaki and , was opened in 1919, and the line was gradually extended to in 1931. Sagami Railway started direct operation to , but performance was sluggish during the economic depression, and an outflow disaster of Sagami River severely damaged its gravel pits in 1941. This led to Sagami Railway eventual decision to become a subsidiary of Tōkyū in 1941.

The Jinchū Railway () was established in Seya village (now, Seya-ku, Yokohama) in 1917 and opened its first section from to in May 1926. Jinchū Railway extended to Yokohama Station in 1933, but its management faced financial difficulties, so the company also became a subsidiary of Tōkyū in 1939, prior to Sagami Railway. The two companies&#x27; rail lines were connected at Atsugi Station.

In April 1943, acknowledged by Tōkyū, Sagami Railway took over Jinchū Railway and named the two lines &quot;Sagami Line&quot; (original section) and &quot;Jinchū Line&quot; (acquired section). However, in June 1944 during World War II, the Sagami Line and its Nishi-Samukawa branch line were forcefully acquired by the government to use as a bypass between the Hachikō Line and Chūō Main Line in anticipation of airstrikes on heavy industrial facilities around the area. Sagami Line would never return to the hands of Sagami Railway. At the same time, Imperial Japanese Navy Atsugi Airport was opened, so the ridership and freight traffic increased sharply. As a result, Sagami Railway released all management and delegated it to Tōkyū. Under Tōkyū, the line gained electrification to increase the carrying capacity, and in 1944, all passenger lines were electrified.

In June 1947, Sagami Railway employees bought their own shares from Tōkyū and resolved the commission of the Jinchū Line (renamed as the &quot;Tōkyū Atsugi Line&quot; during Tōkyū&#x27;s operation). Sagami Railway continued to develop the Jinchū/Atsugi Line, which became what is known today as the Sōtetsu Main Line. The whole line was fully double-tracked in 1951. In 1968, Sagami Railway began the construction of the Izumino Line. After completing the first extension of the Izumino Line in 1990, Sagami Railway was recognized as one of the &quot;major private railway companies&quot; (大手私鉄) in Japan by the , which gives Sagami Railway the qualification to participate in cabinet meetings and parliamentary hearings regarding public transportation policies.

In 1952, Sagami Railway purchased the 25,000 m2 of land around Yokohama Station&#x27;s west entrance from Esso, and began to develop to attract department stores.

===Through services to JR and Tōkyū===

The Sōtetsu Shin-yokohama Line is an approximately 6 km link, which is constructed from Nishiya via to . This line enables through services between the JR East Saikyō Line and the Sōtetsu Main Line by late 2019, as well as between the Tōkyū Tōyoko Line, the Tōkyū Meguro Line and the Sōtetsu Main Line by March 2023. This project created a railroad which allows residents and commuters alongside the Sōtetsu railway lines to better access the Tokyo Metropolis as well as Tokaido Shinkansen by interchanging at Shin-yokohama.

One analyst believes that the opening of the Eastern Kanagawa Rail Link will diminish the importance of the section between and of the Main Line, but the convenient through services provided by the new line will attract more passengers and investments to the areas downbound from Nishiya.

<doc id="768734" wikidata="Q7446184" url="?curid=768734" title="Segaki">
<text>The is a ritual of Japanese Buddhism, traditionally performed to stop the suffering of the such restless ghosts/monsters as , and --the dead who have no living relatives)--all ghosts tormented by an insatiable hunger. Alternatively, the ritual forces them to return to their portion of hell or keeps the spirits of the dead from falling into the realm of the gaki. The segaki may be performed at any time, but traditionally performed as part of the yearly &quot;Urabon&#x27;e&quot; ( &quot;Ullambana&quot;) services in July to remember the dead and the segaki ritual for offering alms to specifically hungry gaki or muenbotoke, not for spirits of one&#x27;s ancestor.

The ritual is held at Buddhist temples and there is a custom to place segaki-dana (rack for gaki) or gaki-dana (shelf for gaki) at home, present offerings (traditionally rice and water) for hungry ghosts who are wandering in this world as muenbotoke during Urabon&#x27;e or O-bon.

The segaki began as a way for Moggallana (Maudgalyāna in Sanskrit), on instruction of his master, the Buddha Sakyamuni, to free his mother from gaki-do, the realm of the gaki. Alternatively, Sakyamuni ordered Moggallana to preach the Lotus Sutra or to travel to hell himself, a feat that resulted in the escape of all gaki into the world and necessitating the segaki to force them to return to their realm. Another story says that the student Ananda was told by a gaki that he would become one himself in three days; he thus had to feed strangers to prevent the transformation. In reality, the segaki is likely an adaptation of a Chinese festival to remember the dead.

The ritual is known as &quot;mataka dānēs&quot; or &quot;matakadānaya&quot; in Sri Lanka.

<text>The is a railway line in Japan operated by the East Japan Railway Company (JR East).

The Yokosuka Line connects Tokyo Station with in Yokosuka, Kanagawa. Officially, the name Yokosuka Line is assigned to the segment between and Kurihama stations, but the entire route is commonly referred to as the Yokosuka Line by JR East for passenger service.

==Basic data==

==Route==
The Yokosuka Line runs underground between Tokyo and Shinagawa (parallel to the Tōkaidō Main Line, the Yamanote Line and the Keihin-Tōhoku Line) then branches to the west along the Tōkaidō Shinkansen into the city of Kawasaki. (This alignment, technically known as the Hinkaku Line (, ), was originally built for freight usage; see below.) It rejoins the Tōkaidō Main Line corridor near Tsurumi Station and follows the Tōkaidō Main Line to Ōfuna, where it branches off to the southeast along the original Yokosuka Line toward the Miura Peninsula.

==Services==
Yokosuka Line local trains make all stops. Most trains have 11 cars, with two of those being Green (first class) cars. Other trains between Tokyo and Zushi are made up of 15 cars—an 11-car set joined to a 4-car set. (Due to shorter platform length at stations south of Zushi, only 11-car trains are operated to Kurihama.) Some day-time trains operate between Zushi and Kurihama and these trains are made up of 4-car set without Green Cars.

Shōnan-Shinjuku Line trains enter or exit the Yokosuka Line at Nishi-Ōi. Utsunomiya–Yokosuka Line through services make all stops on the Yokosuka Line between Nishi-Ōi and Zushi, while Takasaki–Tōkaidō Line through services operate Rapid service within the Yokosuka Line, between Nishi-Ōi and Ōfuna, skipping Nishi-Ōi, Shin-Kawasaki, Hodogaya and Higashi-Totsuka.

For information on the &quot;Narita Express&quot; and other limited express services, see their respective articles.

The Yokosuka Line has through service onto the Sōbu Line to and beyond. Some trains travel as far as:
* on the Sotobō Line
* on the Uchibō Line
* via on the Narita Line 
* on the Kashima Line
* on the Sōbu Main Line

== Station list ==
The section between Yokosuka and Kurihama is single-tracked; trains can only pass one another at Kinugasa and Kurihama stations.

Local trains stop at all stations, from Tokyo to Kurihama. Meanwhile, Shōnan–Shinjuku Line (Utsunomiya–Yokosuka Line) stop at all stations between Nishi-Ōi and Zushi.

Shōnan–Shinjuku Line (Takasaki–Tōkaidō Line) operate Rapid service on the Yokosuka Line.

Legends:

* ● : Trains stop
* | : Trains pass
* ▲ : Shōnan–Shinjuku Line (Takasaki–Tōkaidō Line) trains use Tōkaidō Line platforms

==History==
The Yokosuka Line was constructed in response to the request to the Cabinet by the Navy and the Army, dated June 22, 1886, citing the lack of ground transportation to Yokosuka, one of the most important military bases in the country. On April 22, 1887 the Cabinet ordered the Government Railways to build the line with the budget diverted from the fund for the Tōkaidō Line construction. After the survey from July to December 1887, the construction of the railway between Ōfuna and Yokosuka started in January 1888 and completed in June 1889 spending 408,480 yen in total. The operation of the line started on June 16, 1889.

===Hinkaku Line===
The was originally built to divert freight traffic from the busy Tōkaidō Main Line, providing an alternate route between and . After a 1967 explosion, freight trains were banned from portions of the central Tokyo rail network, providing the impetus for the construction of the orbital Musashino Line. The new Musashino Line was connected to the Hinkaku Line roughly north of Tsurumi Station near , siphoning off nearly all freight traffic after its opening in 1975. This left a substantial chunk of the double-tracked, mostly grade-separated Hinkaku Line disused.

In order to put the line back into passenger service, a new track was installed between Tsurumi Station and the Musashino Line, where it was connected to the now-disused portion of the Hinkaku Line. Two new stations were constructed: one () adjacent to the existing Kashimada Station on the Nambu Line in 1980 and another at in 1986. Musashi-Kosugi Station, the third station in this section, opened in 2010; it provides a transfer to the Nambu Line as well as the Tōkyū Tōyoko and Meguro lines.

<text>The Bahr el Ghazal () is a region of northwestern South Sudan. Its name came from the river Bahr el Ghazal. The name translates as &quot;sea of gazelles&quot; from Arabic.

== Geography ==
Bahr el Ghazal borders the Central African Republic to the west. It is an area of swamps and ironstone plateaus inhabited mainly by the Dinka people, who make their living through subsistence farming and cattle herding plus Luwo and Fartit tribes.

=== Administrative divisions ===
Bahr el Ghazal consists of the following states:
* Lakes
* Northern Bahr el Ghazal
* Warrap
* Western Bahr el Ghazal
* &quot;Abyei Area&quot;

Between October 2015 and January 2020, the region consisted of the following states:

* Eastern Lakes State
* Gok State
* Western Lakes State
* Aweil East State
* Aweil State
* Tonj State
* Twic State
* Lol State
* Wau State
* Gogrial State
* &quot;Abyei Area&quot;

== History ==
It was historically subject to raids by the Fur invaders from the neighboring region of Darfur. The khedive of Egypt made Bahr al Ghazal his province in 1864. Powerful native merchants, who set themselves up as princes complete with armies, emerged in the area. The most powerful of them, al-Zubayr, fought and defeated a joint Turkish/Egyptian force sent to Bahr el Ghazal in 1873. The khedive conceded defeat and made Bahr el Ghazal a nominal province of Egypt, with al-Zubayr as its governor. It came under Mahdist control in 1884, when Karam Allāh Muḥammad Kurkusāwī was appointed governor.

The region was visited by the anthropologist E. E. Evans-Pritchard in 1929. The region was later incorporated into Anglo-Egyptian Sudan and became the ninth province after being split from Equatoria in 1948, and later a province, and then state, under the Republic of Sudan. In 1996, the region was divided into the four current districts as part of an administrative reorganization of the country. During the condominium period of joint British-Egyptian rule, the area was administered by British district officers; because of annual flooding and difficult traveling conditions, the area became part of what was known colloquially in the British Sudan Service as &quot;The Bog&quot;, with British District Officers known as &quot;Bog Barons&quot; 

The region has been affected by civil war for many years. It was a scene of fighting in the First Sudanese Civil War. In 1982, the Sudan People&#x27;s Liberation Army (SPLA) was formed there by John Garang to fight the Northerners-dominated government in Khartoum. This was the beginning of what quickly became known as the Second Sudanese Civil War. The subsequent conflict lasted until 2003 and killed more than two million people. A substantial fraction of the population of the region is internally displaced or refugees in neighboring countries.

Under legislation approved by the government of South Sudan in 2011, Bahr el Ghazal could host a planned city at Ramciel intended to serve as the new national capital. If a new capital at Ramciel is built, it would mark a shift away from the power center in Equatoria, though Ramciel is located very close to the border between Lakes state and Central Equatoria.

<text>is a city located in Ehime Prefecture, Japan. , the city had an estimated population of 83,635 in 28876 households and a population density of 200 persons per km². The total area of the city is . Shikokuchūō is the leading producer of paper and paper products in Japan. It is also a port city and one of Ehime&#x27;s major centers of industry.

==Geography==
Shikokuchūō is located in eastern Ehime Prefecture, with the Hoō Mountains to the south and the Gulf of Hiuchi of the Seto Inland Sea to the north. Because the plains are narrow, a local wind called &quot;Yamaji&quot; blows down from the mountains toward the sea. To the south of the Hoō Mountains, the Douzan River, one of the Yoshino River&#x27;s tributaries, flows eastward, and further south are the Shikoku Mountains, which forms the border with Kōchi Prefecture. The Japan Median Tectonic Line runs east-west along the foot of the Hoō Mountains. The city is located 60 kilometers from Kōchi city, 70 kilometers from Takamatsu, 80 kilometers from Matsuyama, Ehime and 100 kilometers from Tokushima.

===Climate===
Shikokuchūō has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen &quot;Cfa&quot;) characterized by warm summers and cool winters with light snowfall. The average annual temperature in Shikokuchūō is 12.5 °C. The average annual rainfall is 2030 mm with September as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in January, at around 23.7 °C, and lowest in January, at around 1.3 °C.

==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Shikokuchūō has decreased slightly since the 1960s.

==History==
The area of Shikokuchūō was part of ancient Iyo Province. Ruins found within the city limits suggest that the area was first inhabited more than 12,000 years ago. People first lived in the hilly areas along the Kinugawa River, and then spread to the coastal plains from the Jomon period to the Yayoi period. In the middle of the Kofun period, Toguyama Kofun, which is said to be the tomb of Prince Kinashi Karu, was constructed. In the late Kofun period, in the 6th century, burial mounds began to be built in hilly areas. In the first half of the 7th century, the Umamukaiyama Kofun, which has one of the largest stone burial chambers in Shikoku, was built. After the Nara period Taika Reforms, this area came to be called Uma District. The city limits of Uma District and modern Shikokuchūō are almost the same. As Uma is centrally located in Shikoku, it was historically a transportation hub between Shikoku&#x27;s major cities. Due to its strategic importance, during the Sengoku period Uma was repeatedly invaded by the neighboring warlords. During the Edo Period, the area as divided between the holdings of Imabari Domain, Saijō Domain and &quot;tenryō&quot; territory administered on behalf of the Tokugawa shogunate by Iyo-Matsuyama Domain. Industry began to flourish in Uma during the Edo period, and the city grew as a port town. The Tosa kaidō offered access to Tosa Province in the south, so Uma was also a stopping spot, or ‘post station,’ for the Tosa daimyō and travelers to and from Tosa. Paper making began in Uma around 1750, and much later grew into the region&#x27;s major industry.

Following the Meiji restoration, the area was divided into 25 villages with the establishment of the modern municipalities system on December 15, 1889. The villages of Mishima and Kawanoe were raised to town status in 1898. The village of Doi was raised to town status in 1954 and the villages of Shinritsu and Kamiyama merged to form the village of Shingū the same year. Late that year, Kawanoe and Mishima were raised to city status, with Mishima renamed Iyomishima.

Shikokuchūō city was founded on April 1, 2004 when the cities of Kawanoe, Iyomishima, the town of Doi and the village of Shingū merged. The name literally means &quot;Shikoku Central City&quot; and was so named in the hopes of becoming the new capital of the island of Shikoku, should the four prefectures be merged into one state. However, this name has been roundly criticized for its unoriginality, and is known as one of the &quot;strange city names&quot; throughout Japan. 

The former cities of Kawanoe and Iyomishima (the two largest of the four municipalities that merged) have fought for political control over the new city. 

==Government==
Shikokuchūō has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city council of 22 members. Shikokuchūō contributes three members to the Ehime Prefectural Assembly.

In terms of national politics, Shikokuchūō is part of Ehime 2nd district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan. Prior to 2022, the city was part of Ehime 3rd district.

==Economy==
Shikokuchūō is one of the major industrial cities in the Ehime and Shikoku regions, and is one of Japan&#x27;s leading paper manufacturing areas.

===Paper industry=== 
The history of the paper industry in Shikokuchūō extends back to around 1750, when &quot;washi&quot; was first produced in the Uma area. The area does not have much flat land, and is ill-suited to rice farming, but as water and paper mulberry (&quot;kōzo&quot;) are plentiful, it is ideal for paper manufacturing. The modern paper industry began to flourish when mechanized manufacturing techniques were developed in the Meiji era. After World War II, the paper industry contributed to the city&#x27;s rapid economic growth.

The city paper museum, Kami no Machi Shiryokan, has exhibits and information on traditional paper making and the modern paper industry.

==Education==
Shikokuchūō has 18 public elementary schools and six public middle schools and one combined public elementary/middle school operated by the city government. The city has three public high schools operated by the Ehime Prefectural Board of Education.

== Transportation ==
=== Railways ===
 Shikoku Railway Company - Yosan Line

=== Highways ===
* Matsuyama Expressway
* Kōchi Expressway
* Takamatsu Expressway
* Tokushima Expressway
* 

===Ports===
* Port of Mishima-Kawanoe

==Local attractions==

===Junshin-do===
The Buddhist monk Junshin dwelt here after he was expelled from Tosa province (modern day Kochi). As is described in the lyrics of the &quot;Yosakoi naruko&quot; dancing song, Junshin had an illicit affair with a comb-maker&#x27;s daughter, and the two of them attempted to elope. After they were caught leaving Tosa without permission, Junshin was permanently expelled from Tosa, and the two of them were separated. Junshin lived in this building for the remainder of his life. 

===Kawanoe Castle===

Kawanoe Castle was built in 1337 at the beginning of the Nanboku-cho period. For the next several hundred years, it was attacked repeatedly by armies from Sanuki, Awa, and Tosa. It fell to the armies of Toyotomi Hideyoshi in 1585, when he conquered Shikoku. The castle was torn down in 1611, and some of it was used for Matsuyama Castle. In 1984, Kawanoe City began a project to rebuild Kawanoe Castle. Construction was completed in 1988.

===Kofun===
Many burial mounds, or &quot;kofun&quot;, were built in the area during the mid to late Kofun period. These include the Toguzan burial mounds, the Kyogaoka burial mounds (circa sixth century AD), and the Umamukaiyama Kofun (early seventh century). The Toguzan kofun is said to be the grave of crown prince Kinashi no Karu no Miko, son of the nineteenth emperor, who in the &quot;Kojiki&quot; was banished to Iyo by his brother.

===Manabe house===
The Manabe house is the oldest extant &quot;minka&quot; (traditional Japanese house) in Ehime, and is designated as a national cultural treasure. The house was built by the Manabe family, who were descended from members of the Heike clan who fled to Shikoku after the Heike&#x27;s defeat in the Genpei War. 

===Tosa Kaidō===
The Tosa Kaidō is a direct route over the mountains between Tosa (modern day Kochi) and Iyo (modern day Ehime) that was used from ancient times to the Edo era. In Shikokuchūō, the road starts in Kawanoe, passes through Shingu, and continues to Sasagamine ridge in Otoyo Town, Kochi. Parts of the road date back to 793, when it was made an official government route of the Daijo-kan (the central government in Kyoto). The road later fell out of use by the government, but continued to be used by travelers and people in Shikoku for the next nine hundred years. From 1718, the Edo shogunate began to use the road for sankinkotai, the policy of forcing the daimyō of every han to move periodically between Edo and his han.

In recent years the Tosa Kaidō has been maintained through the efforts of volunteers. Hikers can walk on a footpath from Kawanoe to Otoyo, Kochi. (The path sometimes joins Ehime prefectural road 5.)

==In popular culture==
===Shodo Girls===
The 2010 movie &quot;Shodo Girls!! Watashi-tachi no Koshien&quot; was filmed in Shikokuchūō. The movie is about a high school calligraphy club which prepares to compete in the &quot;Shodo Girls Koshien&quot;—a performance calligraphy event involving teams drawing on 10m x 12m sheets of paper while performing to music. &quot;Shodo&quot; Girls is based on a true story.

<text>Johann Jakob Balmer (1 May 1825 – 12 March 1898) was a Swiss mathematician best known for his work in physics, the Balmer series of hydrogen atom.

==Biography ==
Balmer was born in Lausen, Switzerland, the son of a chief justice also named Johann Jakob Balmer. His mother was Elizabeth Rolle Balmer, and he was the oldest son. During his schooling he excelled in mathematics, and so decided to focus on that field when he attended university.

He studied at the University of Karlsruhe and the University of Berlin, then completed his PhD from the University of Basel in 1849 with a dissertation on the cycloid. Johann then spent his entire life in Basel, where he taught at a school for girls. He also lectured at the University of Basel. In 1868 he married Christine Pauline Rinck at the age of 43. The couple had six children.

Despite being a mathematician, Balmer is best remembered for his work on spectral series. His major contribution (made at the age of sixty, in 1885) was an empirical formula for the visible spectral lines of the hydrogen atom, the study of which he took up at the suggestion of Eduard Hagenbach also of Basel. Using Ångström&#x27;s measurements of the hydrogen lines, he arrived at a formula for computing the wavelength as follows:

:formula_1

for &quot;m&quot; = 2 and &quot;n&quot; = 3, 4, 5, 6, and so forth; &quot;h&quot; = 3.6456 · 10−7 m = 364.56 nm.

In his 1885 notice, he referred to &quot;h&quot; as the &quot;fundamental number of hydrogen.&quot; Today, &quot;h&quot; is known as the &quot;Balmer constant.&quot; Balmer used his formula to predict the wavelength for &quot;n&quot; = 7:

formula_2

Hagenbach informed Balmer that Ångström had observed a line with wavelength 397 nm. This portion of the Hydrogen emission spectrum, from transitions in electron energy levels with &quot;n&quot; ≥ 3 to &quot;n&quot; = 2, became known as the Balmer series. 

The Balmer lines refer to the emission lines that occur within the visible region of the Hydrogen emission spectrum at 410.29 nm, 434.17 nm, 486.27 nm, and 656.47 nm. These lines are caused by electrons in an excited state emitting a photon and returning to the first excited state of the hydrogen atom (&quot;n&quot; = 2).

Two of Balmer&#x27;s colleagues, Hermann Wilhelm Vogel and William Huggins, were able to confirm the existence of other lines of the Balmer series in the spectrum of hydrogen in white stars.

Balmer&#x27;s formula was later found to be a special case of the Rydberg formula, devised by Johannes Rydberg in 1888:

: formula_3

with formula_4 being the Rydberg constant for hydrogen, formula_5 for Balmer&#x27;s formula, and formula_6.

A full explanation of why these formulas worked, however, had to wait until 18 years after Balmer&#x27;s death with the presentation of the Bohr model of the atom by Niels Bohr in 1913.

Johann Balmer died in Basel, aged 72.

==Honors==
*Balmer formula and Balmer constant &quot;h&quot; are named after him, as well as Balmer lines and Balmer series.
*The Balmer jump is useful in Astronomy for stellar classification.
*The crater Balmer on the Moon is named after him.
*Minor planet 12755 Balmer is named after him.

<text>Michael Wigglesworth (1631–1705) was a Puritan minister, physician, and poet whose poem &quot;The Day of Doom&quot; was a bestseller in early New England.

==Family==
Michael Wigglesworth was born October 18, 1631, in Yorkshire, England.
His father was Edward Wigglesworth, born 1603 in Scotton, Lincolnshire, and his mother was Ester Middlebrook of Wrawby (born in Batley), who married on October 27, 1629, in Wrawby. The family moved to New England in 1638. They originally lived in Charlestown, Massachusetts, then soon moved to New Haven, Connecticut. When Wigglesworth was ten years old his father became bed-ridden, forcing him to leave school to help maintain the family farm.

He graduated from Harvard in 1651 and taught there as a tutor until 1654, sometimes preaching in Charlestown and Malden, Massachusetts. He became a minister at the First Parish in Malden in 1654 but was not actually ordained until 1656.

A daughter Mercy Wigglesworth was born February 21, 1655. With his second wife he had six children, including Samuel Wigglesworth born . His youngest son, with his third wife, Sybil (Avery) Sparhawk, was clergyman Edward Michael Wigglesworth (c. 1693–1765), who had several namesakes. His son, Samuel, had 12 children, including one also named Edward Wigglesworth (1741–1826) who was a colonel in the American Revolutionary War.

==Work==
Wigglesworth believed that he was essentially not worthy of believing in God as a result of his depraved humanity. When he underwent a series of nocturnal emissions in his early life, he was thereafter convinced of his damnation. Through his diaries, he recounts his struggle to remain pure and good, despite continually relapsing into what he viewed as man&#x27;s natural depravity.

At one point, Wigglesworth was overcome with a psychosomatic disorder in which he felt he should not preach. His confused and disappointed congregation elected to find a replacement for Wigglesworth, an unnamed preacher who went on to embezzle funds from the church. Thereafter, Wigglesworth was reinstated and encouraged to take up preaching again.

In his diaries, Wigglesworth expressed an overwhelming sense of inferiority, shown in his refusal to accept the presidency of Harvard due to lack of self-confidence, and again when he married his cousin because, he claimed he was not good enough to find another woman.

Wigglesworth was plagued by his attraction to his male students, many of whom were his close contemporaries in age. The passages in his diary about these attractions are written in a secret code, allowing him to be explicit about his feelings and his fears.

On April 5, 1653, Wigglesworth wrote, &quot;I find my spirit so exceedingly carried with love to my pupils that I can&#x27;t tell how to take up my rest in God.&quot; On July 4, 1653, he struggled with &quot;filthy lust&quot; inspired by &quot;my fond affection for my students while in their presence.&quot; Wigglesworth married in 1655, but his attraction to men continued. The day after his marriage Wigglesworth confessed to his diary: &quot;I feel stirrings and strongly of my former distemper even after the use of marriage --which makes me exceeding afraid.&quot;

Yet he was widowed twice, and married a third time: Mary Reyner in 1655, Martha Mudge in 1679 and Sybil (Avery) Spearhawk in 1691.

In 1662 he published &quot;The Day of Doom or a Poetical Description of the Great and Last Judgment&quot;, a &quot;doggerel epitome of Calvinistic theology&quot;, according to a later anthology, &quot;Colonial Prose and Poetry&quot; (1903), that says it &quot;attained immediately a phenomenal popularity. Eighteen hundred copies were sold within a year, and for the next century it held a secure place in New England Puritan households. As late as 1828 it was stated that &quot;many aged persons were still alive who could repeat it, as it had been taught them with their catechism; and the more widely one reads in the voluminous sermons of that generation, the more fair will its representation of prevailing theology in New England appear.&quot; A less polemic analysis of the work might also show its rich use of dramatic imagery, combining a number of references from both Hebrew and Christian scriptures, and note the interlocked complexity of its double-rhymed octasina (8-syllable) lines. 

Despite the fierce denunciations of sinners and the terrible images of damnation in &quot;The Day of Doom&quot;, its author was known as a &quot;genial philanthropist, so cheerful that some of his friends thought he could not be so sick as he averred. Dr. Peabody used to call him &#x27;a man of the beatitudes&#x27;, ministering not alone to the spiritual but to the physical needs of his flock, having studied medicine for that purpose,&quot; according to &quot;Colonial Prose and Poetry&quot;.

Other works by Wigglesworth include &quot;God&#x27;s Controversy with New England,&quot; &quot;Meat out of the Eater,&quot; and &quot;God&#x27;s Controversy with New England,&quot; (1662). The latter poem was unpublished, yet provides a lengthy commentary on the fears of Puritans that they would be stricken by God for their sin, and persecuted by House of Stuart.

==Salem Witchcraft Trials and Accountability==
=== Cambridge Association ===
Rev. Wigglesworth was among the area ministers invited to join the Cambridge Association when it formed in 1690, organized by the twenty-seven-year-old Rev. Cotton Mather and the elder Rev. Charles Morton. The first order of business was to respond to a letter from the minister at Salem Village, Rev. Samuel Parris, and invite him to come down to meet with them a week later in the college library in Cambridge (see photo). 
During the witchcraft trials in 1692, this group of ministers met often in the library and were solicited for advice regarding witchcraft doctrine. Wigglesworth was in attendance at a number of meetings that year but is not recorded as having had much to say. His famous poem &quot;Day of Doom&quot; published some 30 years prior has only one brief mention of the word &quot;witch.&quot; Unlike the Mathers, witchcraft does not appear to have been a subject of great interest to him. 

On October 3, 1692, Wigglesworth signed his name to Rev. Samuel Willard&#x27;s short and forceful introduction (&quot;It is therefore exceeding necessary that in such a day as this, men be informed what is evidence and what is not.&quot;) of Increase Mather&#x27;s essay &quot;Cases Concerning Evil Spirits.&quot; Increase Mather himself does not appear to have been in attendance at this meeting and his son Cotton Mather famously refused to sign Willard&#x27;s introduction. 

After the trials were ended, churchmembers in Salem Village who had suffered, or lost loved ones, sought a Church Council to hear grievances against their pastor Parris and they were supported in this effort by Willard. Parris stalled for as long as he could and then sought allies, writing to the Mathers, and also inviting Wigglesworth through his church at Malden. It is unclear why Parris would have considered Wigglesworth a possible ally. In any event, Wigglesworth did not attend the Council which took place April 3, 1695. 

=== To Leave My Testimony ===
Finally, feeling that he was near the end of his life, on July 22, 1704, Wigglesworth was compelled &quot;to leave my testimony before I leave the world&quot; and he wrote a passionate letter to Increase Mather which directly addresses the minister&#x27;s culpability in the events of 1692:

&quot;Rev. and Dear Sir, I am right well assured that both yourself, your son, and the rest of our brethren with you in Boston, have a deep sense upon your spirits of the awful symptoms of the Divine displeasure that we lie under at this day...give me leave to impart some of my serious and solemn thoughts. I fear (amongst our many other provocations) that God hath a controversy with us about what was done in the time of the Witchcraft. I fear that innocent blood hath been shed, and that many have had their hands defiled therewith... Paul, a Pharisee, persecuted the Church of God, shed the blood of God&#x27;s Saints, and yet obtained mercy, because he did it in ignorance; but how doth he bewail it, and shame himself for it, before God and men afterwards. I think, and am verily persuaded, God expects that we do the like, in order to our obtaining his pardon: I mean by a Public and Solemn acknowledgment of it and humiliation for it &quot;[emphasis added]&quot;; and the more particularly and personally it is done by all that have been actors, the more pleasing it will be to God... the whole country lies under a curse... til some effectual course is taken by our honored Governor and General Court to make amends and reparation &quot;[to the families of those condemned]&quot; for supposed witchcraft &quot;[and those]&quot; ruined by taking away and making havoc of their estates... I have with a weak body and trembling hand, endeavored to leave my testimony before I leave the world.&quot; 

Wigglesworth also went a step further in exhorting Increase Mather to express a statement of contrition &quot;to the Rev. Samuel Willard.&quot; Increase Mather had lost the presidency of the college to Willard in 1701 and retained a great bitterness about it at this time.

=== The Mathers&#x27; Oblique Response ===
There seems to be no record of a direct response from the Mathers, but judging from their past reactions (see controversy over formation of Brattle Square church, etc) it is unlikely they would have taken Wigglesworth&#x27;s criticisms lightly. Wigglesworth had been astute in believing the end of his life was near and he died within a year (June 10, 1705) of writing the letter. The Mathers quickly began to assert themselves relative to their fellow pastor&#x27;s posthumous legacy. Cotton Mather gained access to his diary and private papers and quoted from them in a sermon preached at Malden on June 24, 1705. The Mathers had this sermon printed in Boston and a copy was signed by Increase Mather and sent to the church at Malden.

==Death==
Wigglesworth died June 10, 1705, in Malden, Middlesex County.
The epitaph on his grave in Bell Rock Cemetery says:

<text>Sydney Chapman (29 January 1888 – 16 June 1970) was a British mathematician and geophysicist. His work on the kinetic theory of gases, solar-terrestrial physics, and the Earth&#x27;s ozone layer has inspired a broad range of research over many decades.

==Education and early life==
Chapman was born in Eccles, near Salford in England and began his advanced studies at a technical institute, now the University of Salford, in 1902. In 1904 at age 16, Chapman entered the University of Manchester. He competed for a scholarship to the university offered by his home county, and was the last student selected. Chapman later reflected, &quot;I sometimes wonder what would have happened if I&#x27;d hit one place lower.&quot; He initially studied engineering in the department headed by Osborne Reynolds. Chapman was taught mathematics by Horace Lamb, the Beyer professor of mathematics, and J. E. Littlewood, who came from Cambridge in Chapman&#x27;s final year at Manchester. Although he graduated with an engineering degree, Chapman had become so enthusiastic for mathematics that he stayed for one further year to take a mathematics degree. Following Lamb&#x27;s suggestion, Chapman applied for a scholarship to Trinity College, Cambridge. He was at first awarded only a partial scholarship as a sizar (meaning that he obtained financial support by acting as a servant to other students), but from his second year onwards he received a full scholarship. He graduated as a wrangler in 1910. He began his research in pure mathematics under G. H. Hardy, but later that year was asked by Sir Frank Dyson to be his chief assistant at the Royal Greenwich Observatory.

==Career and research==
From 1914 to 1919, Chapman returned to Cambridge as a lecturer in mathematics and a fellow of Trinity. He held the Beyer Chair of Applied Mathematics at Manchester from 1919 to 1924, the same position as had been held by Lamb, and then moved to Imperial College London. During the Second World War he was Deputy Scientific Advisor to the Army Council.

In 1946, Chapman was elected to the Sedleian Chair of Natural Philosophy at Oxford, and was appointed fellow of The Queen&#x27;s College, Oxford. In 1953, on his retirement from Oxford, Chapman took research and teaching opportunities all over the world, including at the University of Alaska and the University of Colorado, but also as far afield as Istanbul, Cairo, Prague, and Tokyo. As the Advisory Scientific Director of the University of Alaska Geophysical Institute from 1951 to 1970, he spent three months of the year in Alaska, usually during winter for research into auroras. Much of the remainder of the year he spent at the High Altitude Observatory in Boulder, Colorado.

Chapman&#x27;s most noted mathematical accomplishments were in the field of stochastic processes (random processes), especially Markov processes. In his study of Markovian stochastic processes and their generalizations, Chapman and the Russian Andrey Kolmogorov independently developed the pivotal set of equations in the field, the Chapman–Kolmogorov equations. Chapman is credited with working out, in 1930, the photochemical mechanisms that give rise to the ozone layer.

Chapman is recognised as one of the pioneers of solar-terrestrial physics. This interest stemmed from his early work on the kinetic theory of gases. Chapman studied magnetic storms and aurorae, developing theories to explain their relation to the interaction of the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field with the solar wind. He disputed and ridiculed the work of Kristian Birkeland and Hannes Alfvén, later adopting Birkeland&#x27;s theories as his own. Chapman and his first graduate student, V. C. A. Ferraro, predicted the presence of the magnetosphere in the early 1930s. They also predicted characteristics of the magnetosphere that were confirmed 30 years later by the Explorer 12 satellite.

In 1940, Chapman and a German colleague Julius Bartels published a book in two volumes on geomagnetism, which was to become the standard text book for the next two decades. In 1946 Chapman coined the term: Aeronomy, which is used today to describe the scientific field of high-altitude research into atmosphere/space interaction.

From 1951 to 1954, Chapman was president of the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics (IUGG).

Chapman was President of the Special Committee for the International Geophysical Year (IGY). The idea of the IGY stemmed from a discussion in 1950 between Chapman and scientists including James Van Allen. The IGY was held in 1957–58, and resulted in great progress in fields including Earth and space sciences, as well as leading to the first satellite launches.

=== Honours and awards ===
Chapman was bestowed many honours over his career, including Smith&#x27;s Prize in 1913, election as a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1919, Invited Speaker of the ICM in 1924, Royal Society Bakerian lecturer in 1931, Royal Society Royal Medal in 1934, London Mathematical Society De Morgan Medal in 1944. In 1949, he was awarded the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society and was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1953. In 1964, he was awarded the Copley Medal of the Royal Society and in 1965 the Symons Gold Medal of the Royal Meteorological Society. He was elected to the National Academies of Science of the United States, Norway, Sweden and Finland. He served as president of the London Mathematical Society during 1929–1931 and the Royal Meteorological Society 1932–1933.

The lunar Crater Chapman is named in his honour, as is the Sydney Chapman Building on the campus of the University of Alaska Fairbanks. This building served as the first permanent home of the University of Alaska Geophysical Institute, and it now contains the Department of Computer Science and the Department of Mathematics and Statistics. The American Geophysical Union organises &quot;Chapman Conferences,&quot; which are small, topical meetings intended to foster innovative research in key areas. The Royal Astronomical Society founded the Chapman Medal in his memory.

==Personal life==
In 1970, Chapman died in Boulder, Colorado, at the age of 82. His wife died in 1967.

<doc id="768764" wikidata="Q471229" url="?curid=768764" title="Paulias Matane">
<text>Sir Paulias Nguna Matane (21 September 1931 – 12 December 2021) was a Papua New Guinean politician who served as the eighth Governor-General of Papua New Guinea from 29 June 2004 to 13 December 2010. His memoir &quot;My Childhood in New Guinea&quot; has been on the school curriculum since the 1970s. He was a long-time contributor and columnist for &quot;The National&quot;.

== Biography ==
=== Personal life ===
Matane was born on 21 September 1931 in Viviran village, Vunadidir-Toma Rural LLG, East New Britain Province. He was a Tolai, a native speaker of Kuanua, and a staunch United Churchman. He wrote 44 books which deliberately use extremely simple English, focusing in part on his own overseas travels, including three on the State of Israel. His writing is intended to persuade Papua New Guineans that books are a useful source of information and that they should not regard them as something only for foreigners.

For many years Matane wrote a column in the Malaysian Chinese-owned newspaper &quot;The National&quot;, containing advice for the younger generation. He also founded the United News Agency of Melanesia. He, together with Grand Chief the Right Honourable Michael Somare, made a point of wearing a lap-lap (skirt) rather than trousers.

He was married to Lady Kaludia Matane who served her country with &quot;great distinction&quot; and died on 20 December 2016.

=== Education and early career ===
Matane attended Toma Village Higher (later Tauran Primary) School and then Keravat High School. Beginning in 1956 he studied at Sogeri Teachers&#x27; College and from 1963 he attended Port Moresby Teachers&#x27; College and Mendi for Inspector’s Theoretical and Practical Training. At the end of his training he worked as an inspector of schools.

=== Ambassador to the United States and United Nations ===
Matane served as the first Papua New Guinean Ambassador to the United States in the years 1975–76 following the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries. He was also PNG&#x27;s Ambassador to the United Nations from 1975 and in 1979 was elected as a vice-president of the General Assembly.

In the mid-1980s he was Secretary of Papua New Guinea&#x27;s Foreign Affairs Department and led delegations to Australia to discuss that country&#x27;s foreign aid to PNG and negotiated with Indonesia regarding border incursions and refugee problems.

=== Governor-General ===
Matane was elected Governor-General by Parliament on 27 May 2004, receiving 50 votes, while his opponent, Sir Pato Kakaraya received 46 votes. Attempts to elect a Governor-General had failed repeatedly for six months before Matane&#x27;s election because of constitutional flaws in the nomination process. Following Matane&#x27;s election, Kakaraya brought a petition to the Supreme Court of Papua New Guinea, seeking to invalidate the election.

Matane was sworn in on 29 June 2004, although the legal challenge to his election was still ongoing. He was officially invested as Governor-General by Queen Elizabeth II on 13 October 2004. He was reappointed for a second term in June 2010, under what &quot;The National&quot; called &quot;very controversial circumstances [...], in an act likely to be challenged in court&quot;. Specifically, &quot;The National&quot; reported that there was &quot;conflicting advice from the speaker and the prime minister&quot; regarding the proper procedure for the appointment, and that the government had Matane reappointed by &quot;using section 87(5) of the Constitution, arguing that the absolute majority secured for Sir Paulias meant that the exhaustive secret ballot vote was not required&quot;. The Supreme Court of Papua New Guinea ruled Matane&#x27;s reelection unconstitutional in December 2010.

=== Death ===
Matane died on 12 December 2021, in his native village of Viviran.

<text>The Hounds of Tindalos are fictional creatures created by Frank Belknap Long and later incorporated into the Cthulhu Mythos when it was codified by August Derleth. They first appeared in Long&#x27;s short story &quot;The Hounds of Tindalos&quot;, first published in the March 1929 issue of &quot;Weird Tales&quot;. Lovecraft mentions the creatures in his short story &quot;The Whisperer in Darkness&quot; (1931).
==Description==
In Frank Belknap Long&#x27;s original story, which deals with the main character experimenting in time travel with the help of psychedelic drugs and esoteric artifacts, the Hounds are said to inhabit the &quot;angles&quot; of time, while other beings (such as humankind and all common life) descend from &quot;curves&quot;. 

Though the Hounds are sometimes pictured as canine, probably because of the evocative name, their appearance is unknown, since neither Long nor Lovecraft describe them, arguing they are too foul to ever be described. Long&#x27;s story states that their name &quot;veils their foulness&quot;. It is said that they have long, hollow tongues or proboscises to drain victims&#x27; body-fluids, and that they excrete a strange blue pus or ichor. They can materialize through any corner if it is fairly sharp—120° or less. When a Hound is about to manifest, it materializes first as smoke pouring from the corner, and finally the head emerges followed by the body. It is said that once a human becomes known to one of these creatures, a Hound of Tindalos will pursue the victim through anything to reach its quarry. A person risks attracting their attention by traveling through time.

The Wolves, perennial antagonists of the four-season horror comic series &quot;Witch Creek Road&quot; (2017–2021) and its spin-off &quot;Witch Creek High&quot; (2023; on hiatus) by Garth Matthams and Kenan Halilović, were based on the Hounds of Tindalos.

The Hounds appear briefly as an enemy in The Dresden Files series by Jim Butcher, in the 2020 novel &quot;Peace Talks&quot;.

== History ==

National Taiwan Normal University opened its doors in the early 20th century during Japanese rule in Taiwan. Taiwan&#x27;s Japanese governors established the school as Taiwan Provincial College. Soon after they gave it the name Taihoku College (&quot;Taihoku&quot; is &quot;Taipei&quot; in Japanese). The school&#x27;s purpose was to nurture a native educated class qualified to assist the government in matters of administration. Many buildings on the university&#x27;s main campus date from the Japanese colonial period, including the Administration Building, the Lecture Hall, Wenhui Hall and Puzi Hall. Japanese architects incorporated features of the Neo-Classical, Gothic and Gothic Revival styles often encountered on European university campuses. A room in the Lecture Hall housed the traditional Japanese document that authorizes and formalizes campus construction.

In the 1940s, the university, along with National Taiwan University, Taiwan Provincial College of Agriculture, and Taiwan Provincial College of Engineering, were the only four higher education institutions in Taiwan.

Some school publications still display 1946 as the institution&#x27;s founding date in reference to this regime change. A number of Taiwan&#x27;s leading authors, poets, artists, educators, painters, musicians, linguists, sinologists, philologists, philosophers, and researchers have passed through the university&#x27;s doors as students and faculty. In 1956 the Mandarin Training Center opened its doors as an extension of the college. The school acquired its present name, National Taiwan Normal University, in 1967. By now the school had established itself as a recognized center of learning in arts, literature and the humanities; its fundamental mission, though, remained the preparation of teachers.
As Taiwanese society made its shift from authoritarian rule to democracy in the 1990s, the university saw its role transformed by passage of the 1994 Teacher Preparation Law. The law gave more schools responsibility for teacher training and set NTNU on its present course as a truly comprehensive university. New departments were created, course offerings and majors were expanded, and new faculty were hired. the merger of NTNU with the University Preparatory School for Overseas Chinese Students in 2006. The university became a hub of international activity, enabling Taiwanese students to travel abroad, attracting international students to Taipei, and building exchange programs with dozens of sister institutions around the world.

== Campus ==

NTNU&#x27;s main campus is located in the heart of Taipei, adjacent to the culturally rich and artistic atmosphere of the Yongkang Street Area, and within walking distance are famous attractions such as Daan Forest Park, Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall, Taipei Grand Mosque, Mongolian &amp; Tibetan Cultural Center, etc. Universities affiliated with the NTU System, such as National Taiwan University and National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, are also nearby. The university also has campuses in the Wenshan District of Taipei (Gongguan Campus) and in the Linkou District of New Taipei (Linkou Campus), as well as standalone buildings scattered off-campus. Examples include the Yunhe Teaching Building, Qingtian Teaching Building, and the School of Teacher Education Building.

Due to the merger with the National University of Preparatory School for Overseas Chinese Students (NUPS), NTNU also inherited some land from the original Luzhou Campus in New Taipei City. It is adjacent to the National Open University.

The campus is also home to several special sculpture installations, including the &quot;Liberty Bell,&quot; which was the spiritual symbol of the Taihoku College, and a Tai Chi statue presented by Peking University in honor of NTNU&#x27;s promotion of Tai Chi. NTNU obtained the sole license from the Louvre Museum in 1987 and purchased a batch of officially copyrighted original plaster replica statues.

NTNU possesses several Taipei City-designated historic sites, including the Original Buildings of Taihoku High School, the residence of Liu Chen, the residence of Liang Shih-chiu, and more.

NTNU Library has branches on all three campuses. The main library has established the Gao Xingjian Center.

== Culture ==
The NTNU emblem consists of a circle formed by six wooden bells, symbolizing collective progress and collaborative efforts to achieve &quot;perfection&quot; in education. The colors represent the blue sky and daylight, signifying the fairness and straightforwardness of the educators.

The official school tree of NTNU is the Cassia fistula, chosen because its appearance resembles the traditional teaching whip from ancient times.

Due to the similar pronunciation between the Chinese character &quot;師&quot; (normal) in the school&#x27;s name and &quot;獅&quot; (lion), the mascot of the school is also a lion named &quot;Da Shi Xiong&quot;. In addition to numerous lion-themed memorabilia, the campus features several lion-related sculptures.

== Ranking and reputation ==
The predecessor of NTNU was the Taihoku Higher School under the Government-General of Taiwan (Taihoku Higher School). The school served as the sole pathway for Taiwanese students during the Japanese colonial era to enter universities for further studies. In the 1940s, this university was also one of the only four higher education institutions in Taiwan Province. As a result, admission competition was extremely intense.

NTNU has long been recognized as one of Taiwan’s elite institutions of higher education, especially in the field of humanities and social sciences. NTNU is also the best university within Taiwan&#x27;s normal university system. While Taiwan has other normal and education universities, this is the only university commonly referred to as &quot;Shi Dà” (師大, normal university).  Its affiliated high school is also known as “Shi Dà Fù Zhōng&quot; (師大附中, HSNU).

Due to NTNU&#x27;s excellent development in language education and internationalization, it has been chosen by the Ministry of Education as one of Taiwan&#x27;s four landmark bilingual universities.

== Nomenclature ==
The standard abbreviated reference to National Taiwan Normal University in English is the acronym &quot;NTNU&quot;. The standard abbreviated form in Mandarin Chinese is the portmanteau &quot;Shi1da4&quot;. Romanized as &quot;Shida&quot;, this form appears transliterated in place names associated with the campus: Shida Road, Shida Night Market, Shida Bookstore, and the like.

The word &quot;normal&quot; in the school&#x27;s name perpetuates an English usage of the term that, if archaic in some countries, remains common in Asia. A &quot;normal school&quot; trains future teachers in educational norms.

&quot;MTC&quot; is the standard acronym for the Mandarin Training Center.

<text>George Kingsley Zipf ( ; January 7, 1902 – September 25, 1950), was an American linguist and philologist who studied statistical occurrences in different languages.

Zipf earned his bachelors, masters, and doctoral degrees from Harvard University, although he also studied at the University of Bonn and the University of Berlin. He was chairman of the German department and university lecturer (meaning he could teach any subject he chose) at Harvard University. He worked with Chinese and demographics, and much of his effort can explain properties of the Internet, distribution of income within nations, and many other collections of data.

==Zipf&#x27;s law==

He is the eponym of Zipf&#x27;s law, which states that while only a few words are used very often, many or most are used rarely,

:formula_1

where &quot;Pn&quot; is the frequency of a word ranked &quot;n&quot;th and the exponent &quot;a&quot; is almost 1. This means that the second item occurs approximately 1/2 as often as the first, and the third item 1/3 as often as the first, and so on. Zipf&#x27;s discovery of this law in 1935 was one of the first academic studies of word frequency.

Although he originally intended it as a model for linguistics, Zipf later generalized his law to other disciplines. In particular, he observed that the rank vs. frequency distribution of individual incomes in a unified nation approximates this law, and in his 1941 book, &quot;National Unity and Disunity&quot; he theorized that breaks in this &quot;normal curve of income distribution&quot; portend social pressure for change or revolution.
