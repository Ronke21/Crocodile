<text>The Port Chicago disaster was a deadly munitions explosion of the ship SS &quot;E. A. Bryan&quot; on July 17, 1944, at the Port Chicago Naval Magazine in Port Chicago, California, United States. Munitions being loaded onto a cargo vessel bound for the Pacific Theater of Operations detonated, killing 320 sailors and civilians and injuring at least 390 others.

A month later, the unsafe conditions prompted hundreds of servicemen to refuse to load munitions, an act known as the Port Chicago Mutiny. More than 200 were convicted of various charges. Fifty of these mencalled the &quot;Port Chicago 50&quot;were convicted of mutiny and sentenced to 15 years of prison and hard labor, as well as a dishonorable discharge. Forty-seven of the 50 were released in January 1946; the remaining three served additional months in prison. During and after the mutiny court-martial, questions were raised about the fairness and legality of the proceedings. Owing to public pressure, the United States Navy reconvened the courts-martial board in 1945—that board re-affirmed convictions. Those convictions stood until 2024, when the Navy exonerated all 256 men convicted during the courts-martial, including the Port Chicago 50.

Widespread publicity surrounding the case turned it into a &quot;cause célèbre&quot; among Americans opposing discrimination targeting African Americans; it and other race-related Navy protests of 1944–45 led the Navy to change its practices and initiate the desegregation of its forces beginning in February 1946. In 1994, the Port Chicago Naval Magazine National Memorial was dedicated to the lives lost in the disaster.

== Background ==

The town of Port Chicago was located on Suisun Bay in the estuary of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers, approximately 40 miles by water from the Golden Gate. In 1944, the town was a little more than a mile from a U.S. Navy munitions depot, the Port Chicago Naval Magazine, which was later expanded and renamed the Concord Naval Weapons Station. It is now called the Military Ocean Terminal Concord. The original magazine was planned in 1941 with construction beginning shortly after the attack on Pearl Harbor. The first ship to dock at Port Chicago was loaded on December 8, 1942.

Munitions transported through the magazine included bombs, shells, naval mines, torpedoes, and small arms ammunition. The munitions, destined for the Pacific Theater of Operations, were delivered by rail to the Port Chicago facility and then individually loaded by hand, crane, and winch onto cargo ships for further transport. Most of the enlisted men working as loaders at Port Chicago were African-American. All of the enlisted men had been specifically trained for one of the naval ratings at Naval Station Great Lakes (NSGL), but the men were instead put to work as stevedores at Port Chicago. None of the new recruits had been instructed in ammunition loading.

===Composition of African American personnel===
At NSGL, the enlisted African Americans who tested in the top 30% to 40% were selected for non-labor assignments. Port Chicago was manned by workers drawn from those remaining. The Navy determined that the quality of African American petty officers at Port Chicago suffered because of the absence of high-scoring black men, and that overall levels of competence were further reduced by the occasional requirement for Port Chicago to supply drafts of men with clear records for transfer to other stations. The Navy&#x27;s General Classification Test (GCT) results for the enlisted men at Port Chicago averaged 31, putting them in the lowest twelfth of the Navy. Officers at Port Chicago considered the enlisted men unreliable, emotional, and lacking the capacity to understand or remember orders or instructions.

Black enlisted men at Port Chicago were led by black petty officers who were regarded by some workers as incompetent and ineffective in voicing their men&#x27;s concerns to higher authority. Petty officers were seen as having aims fundamentally different from those of their menthey were described later as &quot;slave drivers&quot; and &quot;Uncle Toms&quot;. They and their men sometimes had an antagonistic relationship.

Captain Merrill T. Kinnecommander of the Port Chicago facility at the time of the explosionhad served in the U.S. Navy from 1915 to 1922 and then returned to the Navy in 1941 to be posted aboard a general cargo ship. Prior to his being sent to command Port Chicago, Kinne had no training in the loading of munitions and little experience in handling them. Loading officers serving underneath Kinne had not been trained in handling munitions until they had been posted to Mare Island Navy Yard, after which they were considered adequate to the task by the Navy.

=== Speed contests and safety training ===
In April 1944, when Captain Kinne assumed command of Port Chicago, the loading officers had been pushing to load the explosive cargoes quickly— per hatch per hour. The desired level had been set by Captain Nelson Goss, Commander Mare Island Navy Yard, whose jurisdiction included Port Chicago Naval Magazine. Most loading officers considered this goal too high. On a chalkboard, Kinne tallied each crew&#x27;s average tonnage per hour. The junior officers placed bets with each other in support of their own 100-man crews—called &quot;divisions&quot; at Port Chicago—and coaxed their crews to load more than the others. The enlisted men were aware of the bets and knew to slow down to a more reasonable pace whenever a senior officer appeared. The average rate achieved at Port Chicago in the months leading up to July 1944 was per hatch per hour—commercial stevedores at Mare Island performed only slightly better at per hatch per hour.

There was no system at Port Chicago to ensure officers and men were familiar with safety regulations. Two formal lectures and several informal lectures were given to the enlisted men by commanding officers, but follow-up confirmation of retained knowledge was not performed. Safety regulations were posted at a single location at the pier, but not in the barracks; Kinne did not think the enlisted men would understand such lists. Later the International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU) responded to word of unsafe practices by offering to bring in experienced men to train the battalion; the Navy leadership declined the offer, fearing higher costs, slower pace, and possible sabotage from civilian longshoremen. No enlisted man stationed at Port Chicago had received formal training in the handling and loading of explosives into ships. Even the officers did not receive training: Lieutenant Commander Alexander Holman, loading officer at Port Chicago whose duties included officer training, had initiated a search for training materials and samples, but did not organize a training class before disaster struck.

=== Winch maintenance ===
Powered winches were used on cargo ships to speed the handling of heavy loads. One winch was operated at each of the ship&#x27;s five cargo holds. During loading operations, the winches were worked hard and required maintenance to remain operable. Winch brakesa safety feature provided for stopping the load from falling if the winch&#x27;s main power was lostwere not often used by skilled winch operators, as loads could be more quickly maneuvered using power settings rather than by application of the brakes. Disused brakes sometimes seized up and stopped working. The winches on the SS &quot;E. A. Bryan&quot; were steam-powered and showed signs of wear, even though the ship was five months old.

On July 13, 1944, when the &quot;E. A. Bryan&quot;, operated by Oliver J. Olson &amp; Company for War Shipping Administration, docked at Port Chicago, the ship&#x27;s winch brakes were found stuck in the &quot;off&quot; position. This meant the winch could be operated freely, but lacked critical stopping capability if steam pressure was interrupted. The ship&#x27;s chief mate and chief engineer examined the winch, but it was not determined whether the brake was made operational. During loading operations on July 15 the winch at hold began making a hammering noise. An application of grease quieted it through the night until its main bearing could be replaced the next morning. On the afternoon of July 17, a bleeder valve on winch required repair. Albert Carr, a civil service plumber from Pittsburg, California, was called to replace it—it was his first day at Port Chicago. Carr pulled a broken nipple out of the bleeder valve and replaced both the nipple and the valve from new stock taken from Port Chicago&#x27;s shop. While at work he witnessed a man accidentally drop a naval artillery shell two feet onto the wooden pier, but there was no detonation. Carr waited until the African-American winch operator tested the repaired winch and then left the pier, thinking that the operation appeared unsafe.

=== Munitions handling ===
The enlisted men were leery of working with deadly explosives, but were told that the larger munitions were not active and could not explodethat they would be armed with their fuzes upon arrival at the combat theater. Handling of larger munitions, such as bombs and shells, involved using levers and, crowbars from boxcars, in which they were packed tightly with dunnagelifting the heavy, grease-coated cylinders, rolling them along the wooden pier, packing them into nets, lifting them by winch and boom, lowering the bundle into the hold, then dropping individual munitions by hand into place. This series of actions was rough enough that damaged naval shells sometimes leaked identification dye from their ballistic caps.

Commander Paul B. Cronk, head of a Coast Guard explosives-loading detail tasked with supervision of the working dock, warned the Navy that conditions were unsafe and ripe for disaster. The Navy did not change its procedures and Cronk withdrew the detail.

== Disaster ==
The Liberty ship SS &quot;E. A. Bryan&quot; docked at the inboard, landward side of Port Chicago&#x27;s single pier at 8:15 a.m. on July 13, 1944. The ship arrived at the dock with no cargo, but was carrying a full load of 5,292 barrels (841,360 liters) of bunker C heavy fuel oil for its intended trip across the Pacific Ocean. At 10 a.m. that same day, seamen from the ordnance battalion began loading the ship with munitions. After four days of loading, about 4,600 tons (4,173 tonnes) of explosives had been stored in its holds. The ship was about 40% full by the evening of July 17.

At 10 p.m. on July 17, Division Three&#x27;s 98 men were loading &quot;E. A. Bryan&quot; with bombs into hold, 40 mm shells into hold and fragmentation cluster bombs into hold. Incendiary bombs were being loaded as well; these bombs weighed each and were &quot;live&quot;they had their fuzes installed. The incendiary bombs were being loaded carefully one at a time into holdthe hold with a winch brake that might still have been inoperative.

A boxcar delivery containing a new airborne anti-submarine depth charge design, the Mark 47 armed with of torpex, was being loaded into hold. The torpex charges were more sensitive than TNT to external shock and container dents. On the pier, resting on three parallel rail spurs, were 16 rail cars holding about of explosives. In all, the munitions on the pier and in the ship contained the equivalent of of TNT.

One hundred and two men of the Sixth Division, many fresh from training at NSGL, were busy rigging the newly built Victory ship (also spelled &quot;Quinalt Victory&quot;) in preparation for loading it with explosives, a task that was to begin at midnight. The &quot;Quinault Victory&quot; had a partial load of fuel oil, some of which was of a type that released flammable vapors as it sat, or upon agitation. The fuel, taken aboard at Shell Oil Company&#x27;s Martinez refinery mid-day on July 17, would normally be sluiced to other fuel tanks in the following 24 hours.

Sixty-seven officers and crew of the two ships were at their stations, and various support personnel were present, such as the three-man civilian train crew and a Marine sentry. In total, nine Navy officers and 29 armed guards watched over the procedure. A U.S Coast Guard fire barge with a crew of five was docked at the pier. An officer who left the docks shortly after 10 p.m. noticed that the &quot;Quinault Victory&quot;′s propeller was slowly turning over and that the men of Division Three were having trouble pulling munitions from the rail cars because they had been packed so tightly.

At 10:18 p.m., witnesses reported hearing a noise described as &quot;a metallic sound and rending timbers, such as made by a falling boom.&quot; Immediately afterward, an explosion occurred on the pier and a fire started. Five to seven seconds later a more powerful explosion took place as the majority of the ordnance within and near the SS &quot;E. A. Bryan&quot; detonated in a fireball seen for miles. An Army Air Forces pilot flying in the area reported that the fireball was in diameter. Chunks of glowing hot metal and burning ordnance were flung over into the air. The &quot;E. A. Bryan&quot; was destroyed and the &quot;Quinault Victory&quot; was blown out of the water, torn into sections and thrown in several directions; the stern landed upside down in the water away. The Coast Guard fire boat CG-60014-F was thrown upriver, where it sank. The pier, along with its boxcars, locomotive, rails, cargo, and men, was blasted into pieces. Nearby boxcarswaiting within their revetments to be unloaded were bent inward and crumpled by the force of the shock. The port&#x27;s barracks and other buildings and much of the surrounding town were severely damaged. Shattered glass and a rain of jagged metal and undetonated munitions caused more injuries among military personnel and civilians, although no one outside the immediate pier area was killed. Nearly $9.9 million worth of damage ($ million in ) was caused to U.S. government property. Seismographs at the University of California, Berkeley sensed the two shock waves traveling through the ground, determining the second, larger event to be equivalent to an earthquake measuring 3.4 on the Richter magnitude scale.

All 320 of the men at the pier died instantly, and 390 or more civilians and military personnel were injured, many seriously. Among the dead were the five Coast Guard personnel posted aboard the fire barge. African-American casualties totaled 202 dead and 233 injured, which accounted for 15% of all African-American casualties during World War II. Naval personnel worked to contain the fires and to prevent other explosions. Injuries were treated, those seriously injured were hospitalized, and uninjured servicemen were evacuated to nearby stations.

== Aftermath ==
After the fires had been contained there remained the task of cleaning upbody parts and corpses littered the bay and port. Of the 320 dead, only 51 could be identified. Most of the uninjured sailors volunteered to help clean up and rebuild the base; Division Two was separated into a group that would stay and clean up and a group that would be moved out. This section of Division Two and all of Divisions Four and Eight were transferred to Camp Shoemaker, about south, where they were assigned barracks duty until July 31, 1944. The men of Divisions One, Five and Seven were reassigned other duty in distant locations and shipped out. The cleanup detail from Division Two dug into the wreckage of the pier and began tearing out the damaged portions. Beginning in August, Divisions Four and Eight and both sections of Division Two moved to the Ryder Street Naval Barracks in Vallejo, California, across a short channel from Mare Island, where they were assigned barracks duties with no ship-loading. The men were in a state of shock; all were nervous. Many of them inquired about obtaining a 30-day &quot;survivor&#x27;s leave&quot; sometimes given by the Navy to sailors who had survived a serious incident where their friends or shipmates had died, but no 30-day leaves were granted, not even to those who had been hospitalized with injuries. White officers, however, received the leave, causing a major grievance among the enlisted men.

A Naval Board of Inquiry was convened on July 21, 1944, to find out what had happened. The official proceeding lasted for 39 days and included interviews with witnesses who were officers, civilians, and enlisted men. Ordnance experts were questioned as well as inspectors who had overseen previous loading procedures. Five African Americans were questioned, none of whom later refused to load ammunition. Captain Kinne&#x27;s posted division tonnage results came to light in the inquiry but Kinne stated that the competition to load the most tonnage did not make for unsafe conditions; he implied that any junior officers who said so did not know what they were talking about.

The inquiry covered possible explosion scenarios involving sabotage, faulty fueling procedures, failure of the moorings of the &quot;Quinault Victory&quot;, defects in munitions, the presence of a super sensitive element in the ordnance, problems with steam winches and rigging, rough handling by loaders, and organizational problems within the base. The Navy determined that the tonnage contest between divisions was not at fault, although the Judge Advocate warned that &quot;the loading of explosives should never be a matter of competition.&quot; The officers in charge were cleared of guilt. The report stated that the cause of the explosion could not be determined, but implied that a mistake made by the enlisted men in the handling of the ordnance was most likely at root. No mention was made of the men&#x27;s lack of training in the handling of explosives.

The Navy asked Congress to give each victim&#x27;s family $5,000. Representative John E. Rankin (D-Miss.) insisted the amount be reduced to $2,000 when he learned most of the dead were black men. Congress settled on $3,000 in compensation. Years later, on March 4, 1949, the heirs of eighteen merchant seamen killed in the explosion were granted a total of $390,000 after gaining approval of their consent decrees in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California.

The government announced on August 23, 1951, that it had settled the last in a series of lawsuits relating to the disaster, when it awarded Sirvat Arsenian of Fresno, California, $9,700 for the death of her 26-year-old son, a merchant marine crewman killed in the blast. She had sought $50,000.

A memorial ceremony was held for the victims on July 31, 1944, at Port Chicago. Admiral Carleton H. Wright, Commander, 12th Naval District, spoke of the unfortunate deaths and the need to keep the base operating during a time of war. He gave Navy and Marine Corps Medals for bravery to four officers and men who had successfully fought a fire in a rail car parked within a revetment near the pier. The remains of 44 of the victims were interred at Golden Gate National Cemetery.

Wright soon began implementing a plan to have two groups of white sailors load ammunition in rotation with black sailors: one division of 100 men at Mare Island and another at Port Chicago. No plan was forwarded to use black officers to command the black sailors, and no plan included any form of desegregation. This was the start of the Port Chicago Mutiny. Wright sent an incident report of this mutiny to Washington, D.C., telling his superior officers that the men&#x27;s &quot;refusal to perform the required work arises from a mass fear arising out of the Port Chicago explosion.&quot; Wright&#x27;s report was passed to President Franklin D. Roosevelt by Secretary of the Navy James Forrestal who added his opinion that it was &quot;mass fear&quot; motivating the work stoppage. Forrestal told Roosevelt that white units of munitions loaders were to be added to the rotation &quot;...to avoid any semblance of discrimination against negroes.&quot; Roosevelt forwarded a copy to his wife Eleanor, knowing of her ongoing advocacy of civil rights for African Americans.

== Port Chicago mutiny ==
=== Initial actions ===
Divisions Two, Four, and Eightreinforced with replacement sailors fresh from training at NSGLwere taken to Mare Island Navy Yard, where there was an ammunition depot and loading piers. On August 8, 1944, the docked to be loaded with naval mines and other munitions. The next day, 328 men were assembled and marched off. When they heard the orders &quot;Column left&quot; and &quot;Forward March&quot; to march toward the ammunition loading dock, the entire group stopped and would not continue. All said they were afraid and that they would not load munitions under the same officers and conditions as before. It was a mass work stoppage, which would have been called a strike if the workers had been civilians.

The Navy would not countenance such conduct. Seventy of the men changed their minds after their officers made it clear that loading ammunition was their duty. The 258 African-American sailors in the ordnance battalion who continued to refuse to load ammunition were taken under guard to a barge that was used as a temporary military prison or &quot;brig&quot;, despite having been built to accommodate only 75 men. Most of the men in the brig had not been given a direct orderthey had simply been asked if they were going to load ships or not, and to step to one side if not. All said they were afraid of another explosion. Civilian stevedore contractors were called to replace the imprisoned men in loading the &quot;Sangay&quot;.

Among the prisoners, Seaman First Class Joseph Randolph &quot;Joe&quot; Small, a winch operator in Division Four, was asked by officers to assemble a handful of reliable men as a team of acting petty officers and to keep the other prisoners on good behavior. On August 10, there had been conflicts between the prisoners and their guards as the prisoners were marched to the mess hall for meals. There was also a brief fight in the mess hall, and some prisoners were seen sharpening spoons into makeshift knives. Small sensed a general air of rebelliousness among the prisoners. To counteract the rising tension and offset the disaster he saw coming, Small convened a short meeting that evening aboard the crowded barge and told the prisoners to &quot;knock off the horseplay&quot;, stay out of trouble and obey the shore patrol guards (who were black) and the officers, because the alternative (white Marines as guards) would be worse. He said to the men, &quot;We&#x27;ve got the officers by the ballsthey can do nothing to us if we don&#x27;t do anything to them. If we stick together, they can&#x27;t do anything to us.&quot;

On August 11, 1944, the 258 men from the prison barge were marched to a nearby sports field and lectured by Admiral Wright, who told them that troops fighting on Saipan desperately needed the ammunition they were supposed to be loading and that continued refusal to work would be treated as mutinous conduct, which carried the death penalty in times of war. Wright, who had seen nearly 400 of his men killed in 1942 in the Battle of Tassafaronga, said that although loading ammunition was risky, death by firing squad was the greater hazard.

After the admiral departed, the men were ordered to separate themselves into two groups, one for those willing to obey all orders and one for those not willing. To a man, Division Eight chose to obey all orders. Divisions Two and Four were split by the decisions of their men: Small and 43 others chose to form a group unwilling to obey every order. These 44 were taken back to the brig and the remaining 214 were sent to barracks. On the morning of August 12, six men from Divisions Two and Four who had put themselves in the obey-all-orders group failed to show up for work call; these six were confined to the brig, making 50 prisoners in all. These 50 were identified by the Navy as mutineers.

Throughout August, all 258 sailors were taken to Camp Shoemaker and questioned. Forty-nine of the 50 mutineers were imprisoned in the camp&#x27;s brig. Joe Small was placed in solitary confinement. Each of was interviewed by officers, sometimes in the presence of an armed guard. Questions focused on identifying &quot;ringleaders&quot; of the work-stoppage and on what was said by whom at the meeting on the prison barge. The men were asked to sign statements summarizing the interrogation, but the officer&#x27;s version rarely matched the enlisted man&#x27;s recollection of the interview. Some men, upon seeing that the written statements did not reflect what they had said, refused to sign. Others felt they had no choice but to signthey were being ordered to do so by an officer. Several men refused to give any statement at all. Others spoke freely, thinking that the officer was their defense counsel.

After the interviews concluded, the 208 men were convicted in summary courts-martial of disobeying orders, Article 4 of the Articles for the Government of the United States Navy (Rocks and Shoals).) Each was subject to forfeiture of three months&#x27; pay. A few of them were held as witnesses for the upcoming mutiny trial. The rest were split into smaller groups and shipped out to the Pacific Theater. Carl Tuggle, one of the 208, said in 1998 that a group of prisoners, including himself. were assigned menial tasks. After returning from active duty, they each received bad conduct discharges, which meant the loss of veterans&#x27; benefits.

=== Port Chicago 50 ===
The 50 remaining mensoon to be known as the &quot;Port Chicago 50&quot;were formally charged in early September 1944 with disobeying orders and making a mutiny.

The Navy held the court-martial on Yerba Buena Island, part of Naval Training and Distribution Center (later &quot;Naval Station&quot;) Treasure Island, halfway between Oakland and San Francisco. Reporters were invited to watch the proceedings; Navy public relations officers gave reporters copies of photographs and press statements describing the trial as the first mutiny trial in World War II and the largest mass trial the Navy had ever convened. Chosen to head the seven-man court was Rear Admiral Hugo Wilson Osterhaus, United States Naval Academy, class of 1900. The prosecution was led by Lieutenant Commander James F. Coakley, who had recently served as deputy chief prosecutor in Alameda County under district attorney Earl Warren. Defending the men were six Navy lawyers, with a leader and one attorney for every 10 men. Lieutenant Gerald E. Veltmann headed the defense.

Veltmann and his team talked to their clients—they discovered that not all of the 50 were experienced ship loaders. Two of the men had never before loaded ammunitionthey were permanently assigned as cooks because of physical conditions making them unsuited to loading. The two cooks had responded &quot;no&quot; when asked if they would load munitions. Another of the 50, who had a broken wrist in a sling, was asked if he would load ammunition, to which he replied that he would not. More importantly, Veltmann sensed that the men had not conspired to seize command from their superior officers. In a pre-trial brief, Veltmann cited the definition of mutiny from &quot;Winthrop&#x27;s Military Law and Precedents&quot; and asked that the mutiny charges be dismissed as the formal charges against the 50 men failed to allege that they conspired together deliberately to &quot;usurp, subvert or override superior military authority&quot;. Coakley opposed with a brief stating that, under military law, a persistent refusal to work by two or more mensomething that might be called a &quot;strike&quot; among civilianswas sufficient proof of a conspiracy to override superior military authority and was equivalent to mutiny. Osterhaus agreed with Coakley and refused Veltmann&#x27;s motion; the trial would proceed as planned.

=== Prosecution ===
The trial started on September 14 with each of the 50 men pleading &quot;not guilty&quot;. Coakley began his prosecution by calling officers from Port Chicago and Mare Island as witnesses. Commander Joseph R. Tobin of Ryder Street Naval Barracks said that he personally ordered six or seven of the men to load munitions on August 9 but was unable to verify if any others were so ordered. He said that the men he had spoken with were willing to follow any order except to load munitions; that each man expressed fear of another explosion. Tobin verified that the men were not aggressive or disrespectful. Lieutenant Ernest Delucchi, Commander of Division Four at Port Chicago, testified that he personally ordered only four of the 50 defendants to load munitions. Delucchi described overhearing men of Division Eight say to his men, &quot;Don&#x27;t go to work for the white motherfuckers&quot; but, under cross-examination, was unable to identify who said it. Veltmann objected to this hearsay but was overruled after Coakley explained it was evidence toward conspiracy.

On September 15, Delucchi continued his testimony, saying that some of his men told him they would obey all orders and perform all work except loading ammunition because they were afraid of it. Delucchi confirmed that a cook and a man with a broken wrist were among the 25 men in his division that now sat among the 50 accused. Delucchi added that the cook and a second man were sailors he did not consider &quot;up to par&quot;; the cook in particular was prone to nervous attacks and was seen as a liability at the pier.

Later in the trial, Lieutenant Carleton MorehouseCommander of Division Eight at Port Chicagotook the stand to say that at the first sign of problems on August 9, he assembled his men and read their names off alphabetically, ordering each man to work. Ninety-six of 104 refused and were sent to the prison barge, but all of these men agreed to work after hearing Admiral Wright&#x27;s speech on August 11; none of Morehouse&#x27;s men were on trial for mutiny. Morehouse confirmed to Veltmann that some of his men had said they were afraid to handle ammunition. Following Morehouse, Lieutenant James E. Tobin, Commander of Division Two, took the stand. Lieutenant Tobin (no relation to Commander Joseph R. Tobin) related that 87 of his men initially refused to work but that number was reduced to 22 after Admiral Wright talked about the firing squad. Tobin said he put three additional men in the brig the next morning when they, too, refused to work, saying they were afraid. Tobin affirmed that one of the accused men from Division Two was permanently assigned the job of cook because he weighed and was considered too small to safely load ammo.

The next few days of testimony were filled with accounts from African-American enlisted men from Divisions Two, Four, and Eight, who were not standing accused of mutiny. Some of these men had already been convicted of disobeying orders in summary courts-martial. The testimony of the men agreed on several points: that there had been talk among them of a mass work-stoppage leading up to August 9, that some men (none of the accused 50) had passed around and signed a petition to avoid loading ammunition, and that Joe Small had spoken at the meeting on the prison barge and had urged the men to obey their officers and to conduct themselves in an orderly fashion. Some men said Small&#x27;s speech included words to the effect of having the officers &quot;by the tail&quot; or &quot;by the ass&quot;. Coakley was challenged by Veltmann when he attempted to bring the men&#x27;s signed statements in as evidence but the court allowed the statements to be used to refresh the men&#x27;s memories of their answers to interrogation.

Coakley summed up his prosecution case on September 22. His aim was to show the court that a conspiracy had taken placethe mass of accounts from officers and men appeared to support the conclusion that ringleaders and agitators had forced a rebellion against authority. Veltmann pointed out that few of the accused had been ordered to load ammunition, meaning that they could not all be guilty of the charge of disobeying orders. Veltmann stressed that much of the testimony was hearsay and failed to establish a conspiracy or a mutiny. The court, however, seemed to side with Coakley on all points, settling each objection in favor of the prosecution.

=== Defense ===
Veltmann scored a victory at the beginning of his defense: he moved and was granted that each officer&#x27;s testimony could be applied only to the men they had specifically named as having been given the order to work. In principle, this ruling was favorable, but in practice it would benefit the men only if the court had been attentively keeping notes for each accused man. Instead, reporters observed the court to be drowsy at times, with one judge regularly nodding off.

Starting on September 23 and continuing for over three weeks, each of the accused men was brought to the witness stand to testify in his defense. The general trend of the men&#x27;s responses was that all of them were willing to obey any order except to load ammunition, all were afraid of another explosion, and none had been approached by &quot;ringleaders&quot; persuading them not to workeach had made his own decision. Each man said that he himself had not coerced others to refuse to work. Some of the men related how, following the official interrogation at Camp Shoemaker, they had been under great pressure to sign statements containing things they had not said. Some men said that, at the meeting on the barge, Joe Small had not urged a mutiny and had not uttered any phrase to the effect of having the officers &quot;by the balls&quot;. On the witness stand, Small himself denied saying any such thing, though he would admit to it decades later in interviews.

Coakley&#x27;s cross-examinations began with an attempt to have the signed statements admitted as evidence. Veltmann objected that each statement was obtained under duress and was not voluntary. Coakley characterized the statements as not being confessions requiring voluntary conditions but merely &quot;admissions&quot; that had no such requirement. Osterhaus ruled that Coakley could not introduce the statements as evidence but that he could ask the defendants questions based on what each man&#x27;s signed statement contained.

Some of the men who had been named as having been given direct orders to work testified that they had not been given any such order. Seaman Ollie E. Greenwho had accidentally broken his wrist one day prior to the first work-stoppage on August 9said that though he had heard an officer in prior testimony name him as one who had been given a direct order, the officer had only asked him how his wrist was doing, to which he responded &quot;not so good.&quot;

At the end of his testimony, Green told the court that he was afraid to load ammunition because of &quot;them officers racing each division to see who put on the most tonnage, and I knowed the way they was handling ammunition it was liable to go off again. If we didn&#x27;t want to work fast at that time, they wanted to put us in the brig, and when the exec came down on the docks, they wanted us to slow up.&quot; This was the first that the newspaper reporters had heard of speed and tonnage competition between divisions at Port Chicago, and each reporter filed a story featuring this revelation to be published the next day. Naval authorities quickly issued a statement denying Green&#x27;s allegation.

Another one of the men gave the surprising testimony that Lieutenant Commander Coakley had threatened to have him shot after he refused to answer some questions during interrogation at Camp Shoemaker. Seaman Alphonso McPherson held fast to his testimony even when faced by Coakley in cross-examination. Coakley denied threatening anyone, exclaiming that such an idea was a personal affront. Veltmann responded that this line of evidence was news to him, too. The next day, Coakley gave the press a statement accusing Veltmann of coaching McPherson.

October 9, 1944, was another in a string of days consisting of accused men testifying on the witness stand. This day, however, Thurgood Marshall, chief counsel for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), sat in on the proceedings. Marshall had flown to the Bay Area on a special wartime travel priority arranged by Navy Secretary Forrestal. The NAACP had given the mutiny trial top importance due to the U.S. Navy&#x27;s policy of putting Negroes into dirty and dangerous jobs with no hope of advancement. Although Marshall was allowed to observe the trial, as a civilian he was ineligible to take an official role in the men&#x27;s defense. After hearing five of the men defend themselves, Marshall spoke to the 50 men and then conferred with Veltmann&#x27;s defense team. The next day, Marshall held a press conference, charging that Judge Advocate Coakley was handling the case in a prejudicial manner. Marshall said, that from a review of the proceedings and his conversations with the accused, he could see these men being tried only for lesser charges of individual insubordination, not mass mutiny.

The defense continued a few more days with testimony from a Navy psychiatrist who verified that the immense explosion would generate fear in each man. A black petty officer under Delucchi testified that he had heard no derogatory remarks or conspiratorial comments and that it had been a surprise to everybody when all of the men suddenly refused to march toward the docks on August 9.

Marshall held another press conference on October 17 to announce that the NAACP was requesting a formal government investigation into the working conditions that had led the men to strike. He called attention to three aspects: the Navy policy that put the great majority of African Americans into segregated shore duty, the unsafe munitions handling practices and lack of training that had led to the catastrophic detonationand the unfair manner in which 50 of 258 men had been singled out as mutineers, when their actions concerning loading ammunition after the explosion were not significantly different from the other 208 men. Marshall pointed to the men of Division One who had refused to load ammunition prior to August 9, but had been shipped out and given other duty, not arrested and court-martialed.

Coakley&#x27;s rebuttal witnesses consisted of officers who had interrogated the prisoners at Camp Shoemaker. The rebuttal fared poorly, as Veltmann was able to elicit from them: that some of the accused men had not been informed they could refuse to make a statement; that some of the interrogations had taken place with an armed sentry standing guard; that very few of the prisoners&#x27; explanations that they had been afraid of another explosion had been included in the statements; and that the officers had emphasized portions of the interrogations that would satisfy Coakley&#x27;s requirement for evidence of conspiracy. Coakley&#x27;s last rebuttal witness testified on October 19, and the whole court took October 20 off to allow both sides to prepare closing arguments.

=== Closing arguments ===
In his closing argument, Coakley described a chronological sequence of mutinous occurrences, beginning at Camp Shoemaker shortly after the explosion when two and a half companies were mixed together for two weeks. Coakley stated that conspiratorial talk among the men about refusing to work and trying to get out of loading ammunition was the root of their August 9 mass refusal. Coakley described how the mutiny continued in the barge when Joe Small spoke to the men and asked them to stick together. Coakley entered into the record his definition of mutiny: &quot;Collective insubordination, collective disobedience of lawful orders of a superior officer, is mutiny.&quot; He gave his opinion that men who admitted in time of war that they were afraid to load ammunition were of a low moral character and were likely to give false testimony.

Veltmann denied that there was a mutinous conspiracy, saying the men were in a state of shock stemming from the horrific explosion and the subsequent cleanup of human body parts belonging to their former battalion mates. He said the conversations at Camp Shoemaker were simply those of men who were trying to understand what had happened, and that these discussions were not mutinous nor could they provide the groundwork for conspiracy. Veltmann argued that Small&#x27;s brief four- or five-minute speech to the men on the barge was given in the performance of his duty to maintain order, a duty placed upon him by his superiors. Veltmann restated that the established legal definition of mutiny was a concerted effort to usurp, subvert or override military authority, and that there had been no such action or intent. Refusal to obey an order was not mutiny.

=== Verdict ===
On October 24, 1944, Admiral Osterhaus and the other six members of the court deliberated for 80 minutes and found all 50 defendants guilty of mutiny. Each man was reduced in rank to seaman apprentice and sentenced to 15 years of hard labor to be followed by dishonorable discharge. The men were held under guard while their sentences were passed to Admiral Wright for review. On November 15, Wright reduced the sentences for 40 of the men: 24 were given 12 years, 11 were given 10 years and the five youngest sailors were given eight-year sentences. The full 15-year sentences remained in place for ten of the men including Joe Small and Ollie Green. In late November, the 50 men were transferred to the Federal Correctional Institution, Terminal Island in San Pedro Bay near the Port of Los Angeles and the Port of Long Beach.

=== Appeal and release ===
During the 12 days that he watched the court-martial proceedings, Thurgood Marshall began to formulate an appeal campaign, having noticed that none of the men&#x27;s grievances had been aired in court. Directly after the court closed the case, Marshall sent a letter to Secretary Forrestal asking why only blacks were assigned the task of loading munitions, why they had not been trained for that task, why they were forced to compete for speed, why they were not given survivor&#x27;s leaves, and why they had not been allowed to rise in rank. Forrestal replied weakly, saying that a predominance of black men were stationed at Port Chicago so of course they would be working there to load munitions. Forrestal pointed out that there was no discrimination because other naval weapons stations were manned by white crews loading munitions. The Navy Secretary said that the men had not been promoted because their time at Port Chicago had been a &quot;trial period&quot;, and that they were not given 30-day leaves because he thought it best for men to get quickly back to duty to prevent them from building up mental and emotional barriers.

Marshallworking as special counsel for the NAACP Legal Defense Funddetermined that the first course of action should be a publicity campaign mounted with the aim of gathering public support for the release of the men. In November 1944, Marshall wrote an incendiary piece for &quot;The Crisis&quot; magazine, published by the NAACP. Pamphlets were printed and distributed, and editorials denouncing the trial appeared from African-American publishers in January 1945. Petitions began to circulate, collecting thousands of names of citizens who demanded a reversal of the mutiny verdict. Protest meetings were held and powerful people in sympathy to the cause were asked to bring pressure to bear. Eleanor Roosevelt sent Secretary Forrestal a copy of NAACP&#x27;s &quot;Mutiny&quot; pamphlet in April 1945, asking him to take special care in this case.

Marshall obtained written permission from each of the 50 convicted men for him to appeal their case when it came up for review in Washington, DC in front of the Judge Advocate General of the Navy. On April 3, 1945, he appeared to present his arguments. Marshall&#x27;s appeal made the case that no direct order was given to all 50 of the defendants to load munitions and that even if orders had been given to certain individuals, disobeying the orders could not constitute mutiny. He said that Coakley deliberately misled the court on the definition of &quot;mutiny&quot; and that the mass of evidence he introduced was hearsay, thus inadmissible. Marshall wrote that &quot;[t]he accused were made scapegoats in a situation brought about by a combination of circumstances. […] Justice can only be done in this case by a complete reversal of the findings.&quot; Marshall said &quot;I can&#x27;t understand why whenever more than one Negro disobeys an order it is mutiny.&quot;

The office of the Secretary of the Navy ordered Admiral Wright to reconvene the courts-martial, this time with instructions to disregard the hearsay testimony. Admiral Osterhaus once again called the court to session for deliberation and on June 12, 1945, the court reaffirmed each of the mutiny convictions and sentences. Admiral Wright stuck by his reduced sentences.

Only two of the 258 men had their convictions set aside during the reviews; one for insufficient evidence against them and one for &quot;mental incompetency&quot; regarding understanding the refusal of orders.

After the surrender of Japan and the cessation of hostilities, the Navy was no longer able to justify such severe sentences as a warning to other potentially dissident servicemen and labor battalions. In September 1945, the Navy shortened each of the 50 mutiny sentences by one year. Captain Harold Stassen recommended in October that the Navy reduce the sentences to just two years for men with good conduct records and three years for the rest, with credit for time served. Finally, on January 6, 1946, the Navy announced that 47 of the 50 men were being released. These 47 were paroled to active duty aboard Navy vessels in the Pacific Theater, where the men were assigned menial duties associated with post-war base detail. Two of the 50 prisoners remained in the prison&#x27;s hospital for additional months recuperating from injuries, and one was not released because of a bad conduct record. Those of the 50 who had not committed later offenses were given a general discharge from the Navy &quot;under honorable conditions&quot;. In all, the Navy granted clemency to about 1,700 imprisoned men at this time.

== Political and social effect ==
The Port Chicago disaster highlighted systemic racial inequality in the Navy. A year before the disaster, in mid-1943, the U.S. Navy had over 100,000 African Americans in service but not one black officer. In the months following the disaster, the &quot;Pittsburgh Courier&quot;, a newspaper with a large, nationwide subscriber base made up primarily of African Americans, related the incident and the subsequent mutiny trial in their Double V campaign, a push for victory over not just the Axis powers but also over racial inequality at home. The mutiny trial was seen as underscoring the tense race relations in the armed forces at the time.

Late in 1944, under conditions of severe racism, a race riot broke out in Guam at a naval base. In March 1945 a Seabee battalion of 1,000 African-American men staged a hunger strike at their base, Naval Base Ventura County in Port Hueneme, California, in protest of discriminatory conditions. In the weeks following the latter incident, Fleet Admiral Ernest King and Secretary Forrestal worked with civilian expert Lester Granger on a plan for total integration of the races within the Navy. The Port Chicago disaster had helped catalyze the drive to implement new standards.

===Exoneration===
Beginning in 1990, a campaign led by 25 U.S. congressmen was unsuccessful in having the convicts exonerated. Gordon Koller, Chief Petty Officer at the time of the explosion, was interviewed in 1990. Koller stated that the hundreds of men like him who continued to load ammunition in the face of danger were &quot;the ones who should be recognized&quot;. In 1994, the Navy rejected a request by four California lawmakers to overturn the courts-martial decisions. The Navy found that racial inequities were responsible for the sailors&#x27; ammunition-loading assignments but that no prejudice occurred at the courts-martial.

In the 1990s, Freddie Meeks, one of the few still alive among the group of 50, was urged to petition the president for a pardon. Others of the Port Chicago 50 had refused to ask for a pardon, reasoning that a pardon is for guilty people receiving forgiveness; they continued to hold the position that they were not guilty of mutiny. Meeks pushed for a pardon as a way to get the story out, saying &quot;I hope that all of America knows about it... it&#x27;s something that&#x27;s been in the closet for so long.&quot; In September 1999, the petition by Meeks was bolstered by 37 members of Congress including George Miller, the U.S. representative for the district containing the disaster site. The 37 congressmen sent a letter to President Bill Clinton and in December 1999, Clinton pardoned Meeks, who died in June 2003. Efforts to posthumously exonerate all 50 sailors continued. In 2004, author Robert L. Allen was reported as saying &quot;...even for today it&#x27;s important to have these convictions set aside.&quot;

On June 11, 2019, a concurrent resolution sponsored by U.S. Representative Mark DeSaulnier was introduced in the 116th United States Congress. The resolution is intended to recognize the victims of the explosion and officially exonerate the 50 men court-martialed by the Navy. The resolution has been reintroduced in later Congresses; it was still marked as introduced in July 2024 when the Navy exonerated those convicted.

On July 17, 2024, the 80th anniversary of the explosion, the United States Navy exonerated the remaining 256 men, including the &quot;Port Chicago 50&quot;. The then General Counsel of the Navy, Sean Coffey determined that multiple errors had occurred during the courts-martial, including that the sailors were denied a meaningful right to counsel. Due to the exoneration, all dishonorable discharges tied to the courts-martial were vacated.

== Port Chicago Naval Magazine National Memorial ==

The Port Chicago Naval Magazine National Memorial was dedicated in 1994 to the lives lost in the explosion. The National Park Service (NPS) was directed to design and maintain the memorial. Congressman George Miller pushed for the memorial to be upgraded to national park status in 2002, in the knowledge that such status would help the site &quot;become more competitive for federal funds to upgrade and enhance facilities and education materials&quot;. This effort did not result in a change of status. In 2006, a local newspaper article highlighted the precarious position of the disused chapel within the grounds of the Concord Naval Weapons Station, a chapel that had been previously dedicated to the memory of those fallen in the explosion. The 1980 chapel was said by local historian John Keibel to be unsalvageable due to lead paint and its dilapidated condition. Keibel called attention to the stained glass windows, which were crafted in 1991 as a tribute to the disaster, noting that they could be dismantled and remounted at the memorial site. In March 2008, NPS was directed by Congress to manage the memorial, after passage of a bill introduced in 2007 by Miller. On July 10, 2008, Senator Barbara Boxer introduced legislation that would expand the memorial site by five acres (two hectares), if the land was judged safe for human health and was excess to the Navy&#x27;s needs. The Port Chicago Naval Magazine National Memorial Enhancement Act of 2008 was not put to a vote. On February 12, 2009, Miller introduced a similar bill, the Port Chicago Naval Magazine National Memorial Enhancement Act of 2009 (H.R. 1044), which, in addition to calling for another five acres, allowed for the City of Concord and the East Bay Regional Park District &quot;...to establish and operate a facility for visitor orientation and parking, administrative offices, and curatorial storage for the Memorial.&quot; President Barack Obama approved and signed the bill in December 2009.

The site is contained within an active military base and requires prior reservation to visit. Visitors with prior reservations are asked to allow 90 minutes per visit and are shuttled to the site in NPS vehicles from the John Muir National Historic Site.

In 2021, a new park was planned to honor Thurgood Marshall&#x27;s invaluable work with the 50 African American sailors. The future &quot;Thurgood Marshall Regional Park – Home of the Port Chicago 50&quot; will be formed from a section of the decommissioned Concord Naval Weapons Station, a short distance from Port Chicago, and will join the park system of the East Bay Regional Park District. A visitor center is planned to describe the dangers of weapons cargo loading, and the racism experienced by African-American dock workers. The regional park will partner with the National Park Service to tell the story of the Port Chicago disaster, providing easier access to the public.

== Media representations ==
In 1990, Will Robinson and Ken Swartz produced the documentary &quot;Port Chicago MutinyA National Tragedy&quot;, about the explosion and trial. They interviewed mutiny convict Joe Small, his defense lawyer Gerald Veltmann, as well as Percy Robinson, a seaman who returned to loading ammunition after the first work-stoppage, and Robert Routh Jr., a seaman who was blinded in the blast. Danny Glover provided narration for the story, which included dramatized scenes depicting events as they might have occurred in 1944. The documentary was nominated for the Peabody Awards and won an Emmy.

In 1996, Dan Collison interviewed Port Chicago sailors for WBEZ radio&#x27;s PRI-distributed program, &quot;This American Life&quot;. The men described how they were initially trained for action on ships and were disappointed when they were not assigned to ocean-going ships. Collison interspersed interviews with contemporary news reports about the explosion.

The story of the Port Chicago 50 was the basis of &quot;Mutiny&quot;, a made-for-television movie written by James S. &quot;Jim&quot; Henerson and directed by Kevin Hooks, which included Morgan Freeman as one of three executive producers. Starring Michael Jai White, Duane Martin and David Ramsey as three fictional Navy seamen, the film aired on NBC on March 28, 1999.

The disaster and the issues involved were featured in &quot;Port Chicago&quot;, a 2002 episode of the CBS drama television series &quot;JAG&quot;.

The disaster featured prominently in the 2011 novel &quot;Blue Skies Tomorrow&quot; by Sarah Sundin. One of the lead characters works in the arsenal and assists the wife of an imprisoned &quot;mutineer&quot; in her fight for justice.

In 2015, award-winning writer Steve Sheinkin&#x27;s &quot;The Port Chicago 50: Disaster, Mutiny, and the Fight for Civil Rights&quot; was a finalist for the 2014 National Book Award in Young People&#x27;s Literature. &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it &quot;just as suitable for adults&quot; and noted that the &quot;seriousness and breadth of Sheinkin’s research can be seen in his footnotes and lists of sources, which include oral histories, documentaries and Navy documents.&quot;

In 2017, the events of Port Chicago were the subject of the short documentary &quot;Remembering Port Chicago&quot;, directed by Alexander Zane Irwin and produced by Daniel L. Bernardi in collaboration with El Dorado Films and the Veteran Documentary Corps.

The September 2022 issue of the &quot;Smithsonian Magazine&quot; had an article on the disaster entitled &quot;A Deadly World War II Explosion Sparked Black Soldiers to Fight for Equal Treatment&quot;, written by historian Matthew F. Delmont. Delmont later expanded the article into his 2022 book, &quot; Half American – The Epic Story of African Americans Fighting World War II at Home and Abroad&quot;; which covers this incident in detail.

<text>USS &quot;Abalone&quot; (SP-208) was a wooden-hulled motorboat that was commissioned in the United States Navy as a section patrol craft during World War I. She was named after the abalone mollusk.

Built at Morris Heights in 1913, &quot;Abalone&quot; was acquired by the Navy on 27 April 1917 under a free lease from Arnold Schlaet of New York City and commissioned on 10 May 1917.

The sparse direct records of &quot;Abalone&#x27;s&quot; day-to-day operations consist merely of a deck log, which does not even cover the craft&#x27;s entire career. Other sources indicate that &quot;Abalone&quot; was attached to the 3rd Naval District local patrol forces and was based at New Haven, Connecticut. From that port, she performed patrol missions with Squadrons 5 and 20. Following the signing of the armistice, she was detached from this duty on 10 December 1918 and was returned to her previous owner a fortnight later, on 24 December 1918.

<text>The first USS &quot;Abarenda&quot; (AC-13/AG-14) was a collier in the service of the United States Navy during World War I.

She was originally a merchant ship built in 1892 at Newcastle, England by the Edwards Shipbuilding Company and was acquired by the Navy on 5 May 1898. She was fitted out as Collier No. 13 and commissioned at the New York Navy Yard on 20 May 1898.

==Service history==

===Spanish–American War, 1898===
&quot;Abarenda&quot; departed New York on 28 May 1898 and stopped at Lamberts Point, Virginia, to load coal and ammunition before sailing for Cuba on the 30th. On 8–9 June, and then from 10 to 26 June, &quot;Abarenda&quot; replenished the bunkers and magazines of American warships at Santiago and Guantánamo Bay, and also provided gunfire support as the occasion demanded (her port bow gun shelled Spanish positions at the mouth of the Guantanamo River on 12 June). That same day, Lt. Cdr. Buford presented the marine garrison ashore at Camp McCalla with a flag pole and, after being given an ensign by Captain Bowman McCalla, of the cruiser , a party of two officers and four men – under Lieutenant Stephen Jenkins – from &quot;Abarenda&quot;, erected the pole and raised the colors over the marine camp. &quot;When the flag was hoisted by our men,&quot; writes Buford, &quot;the Squadron lying off the camp cheered it... the marines... were given new life and some took up the cheering...&quot; &quot;Abarenda&quot; returned to Lamberts Point on 2 July and remained in the Hampton Roads area through the end of the war with Spain in August.

===South America, 1898–1899===
On 18 September, she sailed for South American waters, and reached Bahia, Brazil on 19 October. &quot;En route&quot; home, the ship visited Barbados, and St. Thomas, Danish West Indies, before ultimately reaching Hampton Roads on 8 December. Coaling duties with the North Atlantic Squadron occupied the ship through the early months of 1899.

===Station ship, 1899–1902===
On 21 April 1899, after completing the loading of a cargo of construction materials (steel, corrugated iron, and glass) which belonged to a San Francisco contractor given the contract to build a wharf and a coal shed at Pago Pago, Tutuila, American Samoa, and steel rods and angle irons earmarked for strengthening the foundations of the coal shed at Pago Pago, &quot;Abarenda&quot; shifted to Coal Pier No. 2 at Hampton Roads the following day, and coaled until the 24th. She departed Hampton Roads on 30 April, bound for the Pacific. En route, the ship stopped briefly at Montevideo, Uruguay, and Punta Arenas, Chile; rounded Cape Horn in rough weather (rolling as much as 30° during the passage); and visited Valparaíso, Chile; Bounty Bay, Pitcairn Island; and Tahiti, before sighting Tutuila on 9 August. She anchored in Apia Harbor the following morning, and then shifted to Pago Pago on the morning of the 13th, to soon commence unloading the cargo brought from Norfolk.

Assigned duty as station ship at Samoa, &quot;Abarenda&quot; spent the next two and a half years largely ferrying people and cargo between Apia and Pago Pago, often carrying as many as 50 – or more – Samoan natives each trip. Twice during this period, during the winter of 1899–1900 and the winter of 1900–1901, the ship made a voyage from Samoan waters to New Zealand, where she was drydocked in the Calliope Dock at Auckland for hull work. Relieved of duty as station ship by the gunboat on 24 May 1902, &quot;Abarenda&quot; sailed for the United States that same day, and, after touching at Lundy Point, Chile; Montevideo; St. Thomas and San Juan, Puerto Rico, &quot;en route&quot;, reached the Virginia Capes on 9 August. Shifting to the Norfolk Naval Shipyard at mid-day on the 10th, she underwent preparations for inactivation, and was decommissioned on 4 September.

===Atlantic Fleet, 1903–1909===
Following her recommissioning on 3 November 1903, &quot;Abarenda&quot; sailed to Guantánamo Bay and Pensacola, Florida, to support the Atlantic Fleet.

She was next ordered to carry coal and ammunition to the European Squadron and departed Norfolk on 23 April 1904. She filled the bunkers of the battleships , , , and from 3–20 June, and arrived at Piraeus, Greece on 30 June. After a two-day stop at Gibraltar in mid-July, the collier headed home on 3 August and arrived back at Norfolk where she immediately began loading coal and ammunition to supply the European Squadron. The collier again sailed for the Mediterranean on 14 October, arrived at Gibraltar on 2 November, and soon moved on to Genoa, Italy, to coal more ships. After a brief stop at Gibraltar, she got underway for the United States on 28 November.

&quot;Abarenda&quot; reached Norfolk on 14 January 1905. Late in the month, the ship made another coaling trip to Puerto Rico before again going out of commission at Norfolk on 21 February. At that time, the ship&#x27;s Navy crew was removed; that afternoon, the vessel was placed in service with a merchant crew. For the next three and one-half years, she provided collier service for the Navy along the Atlantic coast until inactivated at Norfolk on 6 October 1909. On 26 November 1907 she collided with steamer in Chesapeake Bay at the lower end of Cut-Off Channel, minor damage to both vessels.

===Asiatic Fleet, 1910–1917===
Placed back in service as a U.S. Naval Auxiliary on 19 May 1910 &quot;Abarenda&quot; began preparing for service in the Far East. Departing Staten Island on 14 July 1910, she proceeded via the Suez Canal to the Philippine Islands, arriving at Cavite on 20 September to begin serving the warships of the Asiatic Fleet.

===World War I, 1917–1918===
After the United States entered World War I, &quot;Abarenda&quot; was placed back in commission on 27 May 1917 when her officers and crew were sworn into the Naval Auxiliary Reserve — in response to an order issued by the Navy Department on 7 May directing that naval auxiliaries, which had previously been manned by civilian officers and crews, be brought fully into the Navy and manned by Navy personnel.

===Asiatic Fleet, 1919–1926===
With the exception of a short time in 1919 when she served as a station ship at Samoa, the collier – designated AC-13 on 17 July 1920 – remained on duty with the Asiatic Fleet for the remainder of her career. It was in the twilight of her naval career that the ship took part in humanitarian relief in the wake of the devastating earthquake that occurred in Japan on 1 September 1923.

The first word received in the Asiatic Fleet was at 11:00 on 2 September, through a telegram to a Japanese newspaper in Dairen, Manchuria, where a detachment of the Fleet had been sent for liberty purposes. Admiral Edwin Anderson, Jr., the Commander in Chief, Asiatic Fleet, immediately set the wheels in motion to offer relief to the stricken land. As part of the movement to gather supplies, &quot;Abarenda&quot; received orders on 5 September to load non-perishable stores and medical supplies at Hankou, China, and proceed immediately to Japanese waters. Ultimately reaching Yokohama on 18 September, the ship remained there for several days unloading, retained there temporarily to assist the American Embassy and the Red Cross in the distribution of relief supplies.

A short time later, on 18 January 1924, &quot;Abarenda&quot;″s duties were changed when she became the receiving ship at Cavite and was assigned to the 16th Naval District; still later that year, she was reclassified as a miscellaneous auxiliary, and was redesignated
AG-14 on 1 July 1924. Reassigned to the Asiatic Fleet, proper, in November 1924, the ship spent the remainder of her career engaged in carrying supplies, mail, and men from Cavite to the ships operating along the coasts of China and Japan.

===Decommissioning and sale===
Decommissioned on 21 January 1926, &quot;Abarenda&quot; was simultaneously struck from the Naval Vessel Register. She was sold to S. R. Paterno on 28 February 1926. The ship was scrapped in 1934.

<doc id="757543" wikidata="Q1076702" url="?curid=757543" title="We will bury you">
<text>&quot;We will bury you&quot; () is a phrase that was used by Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev while addressing Western ambassadors at a reception at the Polish embassy in Moscow on November 18, 1956. The phrase was originally translated into English by Khrushchev&#x27;s personal interpreter Viktor Sukhodrev. The phrase was received very negatively by contemporary Western audiences, but some modern translators have suggested the phrase was misinterpreted or mistranslated.

==History==
While addressing the Western states at the embassy on November 18, 1956, in the presence of communist Polish politician Władysław Gomułka (with Poland being a Soviet-influenced satellite state at the time), Nikita Khrushchev said: 
About the capitalist states, it doesn&#x27;t depend on you whether or not we exist. If you don&#x27;t like us, don&#x27;t accept our invitations, and don&#x27;t invite us to come to see you. Whether you like it or not, history is on our side. We will bury you! 

The speech prompted the envoys from twelve NATO nations and Israel to leave the room.

During Khrushchev&#x27;s visit to the United States in 1959, the Los Angeles mayor Norris Poulson in his address to Khrushchev stated
We do not agree with your widely quoted phrase &#x27;We shall bury you.&#x27; You shall not bury us and we shall not bury you. We are happy with our way of life. We recognize its shortcomings and are always trying to improve it. But if challenged, we shall fight to the death to preserve it. 

Many Americans meanwhile interpreted Khrushchev&#x27;s quote as a nuclear threat.

In another public speech Khrushchev declared: &quot;We must take a shovel and dig a deep grave, and bury colonialism as deep as we can&quot;. In a 1961 speech at the Institute of Marxism–Leninism in Moscow, Khrushchev said that &quot;peaceful coexistence&quot; for the Soviet Union means &quot;intense, economic, political and ideological struggle between the proletariat and the aggressive forces of imperialism in the world arena&quot;. Later, on August 24, 1963, Khrushchev remarked in his speech in Yugoslavia, &quot;I once said, &#x27;We will bury you,&#x27; and I got into trouble with it. Of course we will not bury you with a shovel. Your own working class will bury you&quot;, a reference to the Marxist saying, &quot;The proletariat is the undertaker of capitalism&quot; (in the Russian translation of Marx, the word &quot;undertaker&quot; is translated as a &quot;grave digger&quot;, ), based on the concluding statement in Chapter 1 of the &quot;Communist Manifesto&quot;: &quot;What the bourgeoisie therefore produces, above all, are its own grave-diggers. Its fall and the victory of the proletariat are equally inevitable&quot;. In his memoirs, Khrushchev stated that &quot;enemy propaganda picked up the slogan and blew it all out of proportion&quot;.

Khrushchev was known for his emotional public image. His daughter admitted that:
he was known for strong language, interrupting speakers, banging his fists on the table in protest, pounding his feet, even whistling. ... manner, which suited his goal... to be different from the hypocrites of the West, with their appropriate words but calculated deeds 

==Alternative translations==
Many authors have pointed out that &quot;we will bury you&quot; was misinterpreted as a threat of military violence by the USSR against the USA and other capitalist countries, whereas it basically meant that the communist system would outlast and replace capitalism, as predicted by classical Marxist doctrine, and hence &quot;we will bury you&quot; essentially meant &quot;we will survive you&quot; or &quot;we (communists) will live to see you (capitalists) buried&quot;. Therefore, alternative translations have been suggested to convey this meaning more accurately. A frequently proposed variant is &quot;We shall be present at your funeral&quot;. In the metaphor used by Khrushchev, Russia&#x27;s role was to take care of the funeral arrangements for capitalism after its demise. It has, additionally, been claimed that the overhead hand clasp gesture reportedly used by Khrushchev in conjunction with the phrase contributed to the misinterpretation due to cultural differences.

Mikhail Gorbachev suggested in his book &quot;Perestroika and New Thinking for Our Country and the World&quot; that the image used by Khrushchev was inspired by the acute discussions among Soviet agrarian scientists in the 1930s, nicknamed &quot;who will bury whom&quot;, the bitterness of which can only be understood by the prevalence of Soviet pseudo-scientific Lysenkoist theory at the time.

==In popular culture==
* Khrushchev&#x27;s phrase was used as the title of Jan Šejna&#x27;s book on communist Cold War strategies, and a 1962 documentary called &quot;We&#x27;ll Bury You&quot;.
* The phrase appears in Sting&#x27;s song &quot;Russians&quot; (1985).
* In the opening scene of the 2020 film &quot;The Courier&quot;, Khrushchev closes his speech with the same words.
* In the 2017 film &quot;The Death of Stalin&quot;, Khrushchev declares &quot;I will bury you in history&quot;, at the death of Lavrentiy Beria.
*In the 2024 film &quot;Soundtrack to a Coup d&#x27;Etat&quot;, this phrase (and direct contemporary commentary on the accuracy of its original translation) are featured prominently.

<text>The Harvard Board of Overseers (more formally The Honorable and Reverend the Board of Overseers) is an advisory board of alumni at Harvard University. Unlike the Harvard Corporation, the Board of Overseers is not a fiduciary governing board, but instead &quot;has the power of consent to certain actions of the Corporation.&quot; Formed in 1642, the Board of Overseers predates the Corporation&#x27;s 1650 incorporation.

==Overview and function==
Today, there are 30 overseers, all directly elected by alumni, and in addition, both the President of Harvard University and the treasurer of Harvard serve as &quot;ex officio&quot; members of the board.

Each year, Harvard alumni elect five new overseers to serve six-year terms. Overseer candidates are nominated by the Harvard Alumni Association (HAA), and those not nominated by the HAA (petition candidates) must gather signatures from Harvard alumni to appear on the ballot. 

According to the Harvard website, the Board of Overseers complements the work of the President and Fellows of Harvard College:[T]he Board exerts broad influence over the University’s strategic directions, provides counsel to the University leadership on priorities and plans, and has the power of consent to certain actions of the Corporation. The Board’s chief functions include superintendence of the visitation process, the principal mechanism for periodic external review of the quality and direction of the University’s schools, departments, and selected other programs and activities. The Board carries out this responsibility largely through the operation of more than fifty visiting committees, whose work is overseen by and reported to the Board.

== History ==
Originally the overseers were self-perpetuating, and included, &quot;ex officio&quot;, the public officials and Puritan clergy of Cambridge and the neighboring towns, hence the &quot;honorable and reverend&quot; of the title. From 1851 to 1865, the fellows were appointed by the Massachusetts Legislature.

Ambassador Joseph P. Kennedy Sr. quipped famously of the election of John F. Kennedy, his son, to the board in 1957: &quot;Now I know his religion won&#x27;t keep him out of the White House. If an Irish Catholic can get elected as an Overseer at Harvard, he can get elected to anything.&quot;

=== Petition candidates ===
In the late 1980s, a group calling for a withdrawal of Harvard&#x27;s investments in apartheid South Africa helped nominate petition candidates for overseer elections. Known as the Harvard-Radcliffe Alumni Against Apartheid (HRAAA), this group supported the first petition candidate to win an overseer&#x27;s seat. The HRAAA backed South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu in his successful bid to join the board in 1989, and future U.S. president Barack Obama&#x27;s unsuccessful petition bid in 1991.

In 2020, Harvard Forward, a group calling for increased attention to climate change, including fossil fuel divestment, and representation of younger alumni on the Board, put forward a slate of five petition candidates. Three of the five were elected to the board: environmental scientist Jayson Toweh, civil rights attorney Thea Sebastian, and professional soccer player Margaret Purce. This was despite the efforts of leaders of the Harvard Alumni Association, who circulated a letter calling climate concerns &quot;special interests&quot; and suggesting that it was inappropriate for overseers candidates to state their views on university issues. Following the election of the three Harvard Forward candidates, the Board of Overseers and the Harvard Corporation changed the election rules in order to make it harder for petition candidates to be elected.

<text>The second USS &quot;Abarenda&quot; (IX-131) was a storage tanker, one of many miscellaneous-class Navy vessel crewed by the United States Coast Guard during World War II.

==Design and construction==
&quot;Acme&quot; was an Emergency Fleet Corporation design 1047 tanker laid down by the Union Iron Works in San Francisco, in 1916, for the United States Shipping Board. She was launched 29 April 1916, and commissioned 22 June 1916.

&quot;Acme&quot; was designed for transporting oil in bulk to Far Eastern ports that had been served by British ships before the outbreak of World War I. She, along with four more ships that were to follow her, had been designated &quot;A&quot; boats by the Marine Transportation Department.

==Service history==
===World War I===
During World War I &quot;Acme&quot; filled in for British ship that had been commandeered by the British Admiralty. Her first voyage was to China. She would continue her San Francisco to China route for the next five years with only rare trips to New York for loads to Singapore via the Suez Canal. After the United States entered World War I, only &quot;Acme&quot; and two of her sister ships were available for Standard Transportation to use in the Pacific, this was mainly because on her return trips she would load coconut oil in the Philippines, which because of its 12 percent glycerin content made it a valuable war cargo.

===Post war service===
&quot;Acme&quot; started running a route from the &quot;Texas-oil-coast&quot; to &quot;ports-north-of-Hatteras&quot; in 1925. She changed owners in 1931 and 1935, but she didn&#x27;t change names.

===World War II===

&quot;Acme&quot; was sailing for Corpus Christi, Texas, from New York, on 17 March 1942, about west of Diamond Shoal Light, North Carolina, () when she was damaged by a torpedo from . Eleven of her crew were killed with the surviving 20 abandoning ship. They were rescued by and landed at Norfolk, Virginia, with &quot;Acme&quot; being towed to Lynnhaven Roads, Virginia, and later to Newport News, Virginia, for repairs. The War Shipping Administration (WSA) requisitioned her about a month later while she was still in dock.

After repairs &quot;Acme&quot; served in transatlantic convoys, with deliveries of fuel to Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, on occasion.

In September 1943, the WSA obtained full title to &quot;Acme&quot; when they traded six obsolete tankers for three new tankers.

In anticipation of her acquisition by the Navy, &quot;Acme&quot; was renamed &quot;Abarenda&quot; on 3 November 1943 and simultaneously classified IX-131. She was purchased by the Navy on 26 February 1944 and commissioned on 18 April 1944.

&quot;Abarenda&quot; was assigned to Service Squadron 10 as a floating storage tanker. She served at Manus Island in the Admiralty Islands until 20 February 1945 when she headed for the Philippines. The tanker arrived at Leyte on 13 March and, for the remainder of the War, dispensed fuel to the warships of the 3d/5th Fleet.

===Post war and decommissioning===
Following the end of World War II, &quot;Abarenda&quot; fueled the ships supporting the occupation forces in the Far East and continued that duty until 28 February 1946 at which time she was decommissioned in the Philippines. Returned to the WSA that day, she was berthed with that organization&#x27;s reserve fleet at Subic Bay. Her name was struck from the Navy list on 20 March 1946 and she resumed the name &quot;Acme&quot; while in the WSA reserve fleet.

Sold on 29 January 1948 to the Asia Development Corp., Shanghai, China, along with 15 other vessels, for scrapping, she was delivered to her purchaser on 3 March 1948.

<text>USS &quot;Abatan&quot; (AW-4) was a &quot;Pasig&quot;-class distilling ship built for the United States Navy during World War II, named after the Abatan River located in the southwestern part of Bohol Island in the Philippines.

Originally laid down as SS &quot;Mission San Lorenzo&quot; under a United States Maritime Commission contract on 9 June 1944 at Sausalito, California by the Marinship Corporation, she was renamed USS &quot;Abatan&quot; on 25 July 1944 in anticipation of her acquisition by the Navy and simultaneously designated AO-92 for naval service as an oiler, launched on 6 August 1944, sponsored by Mrs. John A. McCone, transferred to the Navy on 28 November 1944 at the Mare Island Navy Yard, Vallejo, California, converted there for naval service, completed as a distilling ship, redesignated USS &quot;Abatan&quot; (AW-4) on 24 August 1944 and placed in commission on 29 January 1945.

==Service history==
===World War II, 1945===
Late in February, the new distilling ship got underway for shakedown training off the coast of southern California. She left the continental United States on the 28th and shaped a course for the Western Caroline Islands. After pausing en route at Eniwetok, &quot;Abatan&quot; reached Ulithi on 21 March and remained there for more than six months providing potable water to various types of landing craft, patrol vessels, and escort ships. During this period of her service, Japan capitulated in mid-August.

===Post-war activities, 1945–1946===
The ship sailed for Okinawa on 1 October, and stopped en route at Samar, Philippine Islands, to take on fresh water before continuing on to the Ryukyus. She reached her destination on 11 October and began issuing water to various fleet units. The ship left Okinawa on 15 November and set a course for Shanghai, China. She touched at that port on the 18th and remained stationed there through April 1946. The vessel left Chinese waters on 2 May and sailed via Okinawa to the Marshall Islands. &quot;Abatan&quot; reached Eniwetok on 31 May and assumed duties in connection with &quot;Operation Crossroads,&quot; a series of tests conducted to determine the effects of atomic explosions upon warships. She was involved in this project until 27 June, when she weighed anchor and got underway for Kwajalein. The distilling ship arrived there the next day and remained in port providing potable water through 17 July. She then commenced a voyage to the east coast of the United States. The vessel visited Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, in late July; transited the Panama Canal; reported to the Atlantic Fleet in mid-August; and then proceeded to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. She arrived there on 20 August and entered a preinactivation availability phase.

===Decommissioned, 1947 –1962===
&quot;Abatan&quot; was placed out of commission, in reserve, on 27 January 1947 and was berthed at Philadelphia. Her name was struck from the Navy list on 1 July 1960, and the ship was transferred to the Maritime Administration for layup in the James River.

===Water storage ship, 1962–1979===
&quot;Abatan&quot; was reacquired by the Navy and reinstated on the Navy list on 27 September 1962 for use as a backup fresh water storage ship at the Naval Base, Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. She was again struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 May 1970 but was retained as a hulk for storing water at Guantánamo Bay.

Late in 1979 all desirable equipment was removed from the hull, which was expended as a target on 10 March 1980 approximately west of Guadeloupe at 16 N – 62 W.

<text>Leon Edward Panetta (born June 28, 1938) is an American retired politician and government official who has served under several Democratic administrations as secretary of defense (2011–2013), director of the CIA (2009–2011), White House chief of staff (1994–1997), director of the Office of Management and Budget (1993–1994), as well as a U.S. representative from California (1977–1993).

Panetta was a member of the United States House of Representatives from 1977 to 1993. He served under President Bill Clinton as director of the Office of Management and Budget from 1993 to 1994 and as White House chief of staff from 1994 to 1997. He cofounded the Panetta Institute for Public Policy in 1997 and served as a distinguished scholar to chancellor Charles B. Reed of the California State University System and as a professor of public policy at Santa Clara University.

In January 2009, newly elected president Barack Obama nominated Panetta to be director of the Central Intelligence Agency. Panetta was confirmed by the Senate in February 2009. As director of the CIA, Panetta oversaw the operation that killed Osama bin Laden. On April 28, 2011, Obama announced the nomination of Panetta as defense secretary to replace the retiring Robert Gates. In June, the Senate confirmed Panetta unanimously and he assumed the office on July 1, 2011. David Petraeus became CIA director on September 6, 2011.

Since retiring as secretary of defense in 2013, Panetta has served as chairman of the Panetta Institute for Public Policy, located at California State University, Monterey Bay, a campus of the California State University that he helped establish during his tenure as congressman. The institute is dedicated to motivating and preparing people for lives of public service and helping them to become more knowledgeably engaged in the democratic process. He also serves on a number of boards and commissions and frequently writes and lectures on public-policy issues.

Secretary Panetta&#x27;s son, Jimmy Panetta, has held the elder Panetta&#x27;s former seat in the US House of Representatives since 2017.

==Early life, education, and military service==
Panetta was born in Monterey, California, the son of Carmelina Maria (Prochilo) and Carmelo Frank Panetta, Italian immigrants from Siderno in Calabria, Italy. In the 1940s, the Panetta family owned a restaurant in Monterey.

He was raised in the Monterey area and attended two Catholic grammar schools: San Carlos School (Monterey) and Junípero Serra School (Carmel). He attended Monterey High School, where he became involved in student politics, and was a member of the Junior Statesmen of America. As a junior, he was the vice president of the student body, and as a senior, he became its president. In 1956, he entered Santa Clara University and graduated &quot;magna cum laude&quot; in 1960 with a BA in political science. In 1963, he received a Juris Doctor from the Santa Clara University School of Law.

In 1964, he joined the United States Army as a second lieutenant, served as an officer in the Army Military Intelligence Corps, and received the Army Commendation Medal. In 1966, he was discharged as a first lieutenant.

==Political career==

===Early political career===
Panetta started in politics in 1966 as a legislative assistant to Republican senator Thomas Kuchel, the Senate Minority whip from California, whom Panetta has called &quot;a tremendous role model.&quot;

In 1969, he became the assistant to Robert H. Finch, secretary of the United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare under the Nixon administration. Soon thereafter, he was appointed director of the Office for Civil Rights.

Panetta chose to enforce civil rights and equal-education laws over the objection of Richard Nixon, who wanted enforcement to move slowly in keeping with his strategy to gain political support among Southern whites. Robert Finch and assistant secretary John Veneman supported Panetta and refused to fire him, threatening to resign if forced to do so. Eventually forced from office in 1970, Panetta left Washington to work as an executive assistant for John Lindsay, the mayor of New York City. Panetta wrote about his Nixon administration experience in his 1971 book &quot;Bring Us Together&quot;.

He returned to Monterey to practice law at Panetta, Thompson &amp; Panetta from 1971 to 1976.

===U.S. House of Representatives===

====Elections====

Panetta switched to the Democratic Party in 1971, citing his belief that the Republican Party was moving away from the political center. In 1976, Panetta was elected to the U.S. Congress to represent California&#x27;s 16th congressional district, unseating incumbent Republican Burt Talcott with 53% of the vote. He would never face another contest nearly that close, and was reelected eight times.

====Tenure====
During his time in Congress, Panetta concentrated mostly on budget issues, civil rights, education, healthcare, agriculture, immigration, and environmental protection, particularly preventing oil drilling off the California coast. He wrote the Hunger Prevention Act (Public Law 100–435) of 1988 and the Fair Employment Practices Resolution. He was the author of legislation establishing the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary, and legislation providing Medicare coverage for hospice care. Working with chancellor Barry Munitz, he helped establish California State University, Monterey Bay at the former Fort Ord military base.

He also attempted to form the Big Sur National Scenic Area with senator Alan Cranston. The bill would have created a 700,000-acre (280,000-ha) scenic area administered by the U.S. Forest Service. It budgeted $100 million to buy land from private land owners, up to $30 million for easements and management programs, and created a state plan for a zone about long and wide along the Big Sur coast.

The bill was opposed by California senator S. I. Hayakawa, development interests, and Big Sur residents. Local residents mocked the plan as &quot;Panetta&#x27;s Pave &#x27;n&#x27; Save&quot; and raised a fund of more than $100,000 to lobby against the proposal. The legislation was blocked by Hayakawa in the energy committee and did not reach a vote.

====Budget committee====
Panetta was a member of the House Committee on the Budget from 1979 to 1989, and its chairman from 1989 to 1993, Panetta played a key role in the 1990 budget summit.

====Committee assignments====
His positions included:
* Chairman of the U.S. House Committee on the Budget
* Chairman of the Agriculture Committee&#x27;s Subcommittee on Domestic Marketing, Consumer Relations, and Nutrition
* Chairman of the Administration Committee&#x27;s Subcommittee on Personnel and Police
* Chairman of the Task Force on Domestic Hunger created by the U.S. House Select Committee on Hunger
* Vice Chairman of the Caucus of Vietnam-Era Veterans in Congress
* Member of the President&#x27;s Commission on Foreign Language and International Studies.

===Director of the Office of Management and Budget===
Though elected to a ninth term in 1992, Panetta left the House in early 1993 after president-elect Bill Clinton selected him to serve as director of the United States Office of Management and Budget. In that role, he developed the budget package that would eventually result in the balanced budget of 1998.

===White House chief of staff===

In 1994, President Clinton became increasingly concerned about a lack of order and focus in the White House, an issue that stretched from foreign to domestic policy and political matters. Clinton, who had vowed to run a professional operation, asked Panetta to become his new chief of staff, replacing Mack McLarty. According to author Nigel Hamilton, &quot;Panetta replaced McLarty for the rest of Clinton&#x27;s first term—and the rest is history. To be a great leader, a modern president must have a great chief of staff—and in Leon Panetta, Clinton got the enforcer he deserved.&quot; Panetta was appointed White House chief of staff on July 17, 1994, and he held that position until January 20, 1997. He was a key negotiator of the 1996 budget, which was another important step toward bringing the budget into balance.

===Director of the CIA===

====Nomination====
On January 5, 2009, President-elect Barack Obama announced his intention to nominate Panetta to be director of the Central Intelligence Agency.

At the time of his selection, journalists and politicians raised concerns about Panetta&#x27;s limited experience in intelligence, aside from his two-year service as a military intelligence officer in the 1960s. California Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, the chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, expressed concerns that she was not consulted about the Panetta appointment and stated her belief that &quot;the agency is best-served by having an intelligence professional in charge at this time.&quot;

Former CIA officer Ishmael Jones stated that Panetta was a wise choice, because of his close personal connection to the president and lack of exposure to the CIA bureaucracy&quot;.&quot; Also&quot;, Washington Post&quot; columnist David Ignatius said that Panetta did have exposure to intelligence operations as director of the OMB and as chief of staff for President Bill Clinton, where he &quot;sat in on the daily intelligence briefings as chief of staff, and he reviewed the nation&#x27;s most secret intelligence-collection and covert-action programs in his previous post as director of the Office of Management and Budget&quot;.

On February 12, 2009, Panetta was confirmed in the full Senate by voice vote.

====Tenure====

On February 19, 2009, Panetta was sworn in as director of the Central Intelligence Agency by vice president Joe Biden before an audience of CIA employees. Panetta reportedly received a &quot;rock star welcome&quot; from his new subordinates.

As CIA director, Panetta traveled extensively to intelligence outposts around the world and worked with international leaders to confront threats of Islamic extremism and Taliban. In 2010, working with the Senate Intelligence Committee, he conducted a secret review of the use of torture by the CIA (euphemistically referred to as &quot;enhanced interrogation techniques&quot;) during the administration of George W. Bush. The review, which came to be known by 2014 as the Panetta Review, yielded a series of memoranda that, according to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;cast a particularly harsh light&quot; on the Bush-era interrogation program. The &quot;Times&quot; noted: &quot;The effort to write the exhaustive history of the C.I.A.&#x27;s detention operations was fraught from the beginning. President Obama officially ended the program during his first week in office in 2009. The intelligence committee announced its intention to take a hard look at the program, but there was little appetite inside the [Obama] White House to accede to the committee&#x27;s request for all classified C.I.A. cables related to it.&quot; The findings of the Panetta Review reportedly aligned with much of what the Senate Intelligence Committee report on CIA torture found in its factual accounting. Both reports were largely seen as an effort in fact-finding and prevention, but not a governmental path towards some possible project of accountability or punishment for past interrogation or torture.

Panetta supported the Obama administration&#x27;s campaign of U.S. drone strikes in Pakistan, which he identified as the &quot;most effective weapon&quot; against senior al-Qaeda leadership. Drone strikes increased significantly under Panetta, with as many as fifty suspected al-Qaeda militants being killed in May 2009 alone.

As director of the CIA, Panetta oversaw the hunt for terrorist leader Osama bin Laden, and played a key role in the operation in which bin Laden was killed on May 1, 2011.

=== Secretary of defense (2011–2013) ===

====Nomination====

On April 28, 2011, President Obama announced the nomination of Panetta as United States secretary of defense as a replacement for retiring Secretary Robert Gates. On June 21, 2011, the Senate confirmed Panetta in an unusual 100–0 vote. He was inaugurated on July 1, 2011.

====Tenure====
One of Panetta&#x27;s first major acts as defense secretary was to jointly certify with the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff that the military was prepared to repeal &quot;Don&#x27;t Ask, Don&#x27;t Tell,&quot; which triggered final repeal after 60 days.

In August 2011, Panetta publicly warned that deeper cuts in the defense budget risked hollowing out the military and would hamper Pentagon efforts to deal with rising powers such as China, North Korea, and Iran and he urged Congress not to go beyond the roughly $500 billion in defense cuts required over the next decade under the debt reduction bill signed by president Barack Obama. Working with military and civilian leaders at the Department of Defense, Panetta developed a new defense strategy.

Funding the United States military, in the face of tightening budget constraints, became an ongoing theme of Panetta&#x27;s tenure. He also warned that future service members may see changes in retirement benefits, and that the military healthcare system may need reforms, to rein in costs, while also ensuring quality care.

Another major issue during Panetta&#x27;s tenure as defense secretary was the Obama administration&#x27;s diplomatic effort to dissuade Iran from developing nuclear weapons. In January 2012, Panetta stated that nuclear weapons development was a &quot;red line&quot; that Iran would not be allowed to cross—and that the United States was keeping all options, including military ones, open to completely prevent it. He said that Iran would not be allowed to block the Straits of Hormuz.

In January 2013, shortly before his departure from the defense secretary post, Panetta announced that women would be allowed to enter all combat jobs in the military, citing an assessment phase in which &quot;each branch of service will examine all its jobs and units not currently integrated and then produce a timetable for integrating them.&quot;

== Other activities ==
Panetta and his wife Sylvia founded the Panetta Institute for Public Policy in December 1997 and served as co-directors there until 2009, when Panetta was appointed CIA director by Barack Obama while he was president. He has since returned to the institute in the role of chairman, while his wife serves as co-chair and CEO, supervising the institute&#x27;s day-to-day operations. The institute is located at California State University, Monterey Bay, a campus Panetta was instrumental in creating on the site of the decommissioned Fort Ord Army base when he was a Congressman. Coincidentally, Panetta was stationed at Fort Ord in the 1960s during his service as an Army intelligence officer.

Panetta served on the board of the UC Santa Cruz Foundation, as a Distinguished Scholar to the Chancellor of California State University and as a Presidential Professor at Santa Clara University. He was urged to consider running for Governor of California during the recall election in 2003 but declined in part because of the short time available to raise the necessary campaign funds.

Panetta has long been an advocate for the world&#x27;s oceans. In addition to introducing legislation and winning passage of ocean protections measures such as the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary during his time in Congress, he was named chairman in 2003 of the Pew Oceans Commission, which in 2005 combined with the U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy to establish the Joint Ocean Commission Initiative. Panetta now cochairs the Joint Ocean Commission Initiative with Admiral James D. Watkins and continues to serve as a commission member. Panetta also serves as an advocate and information source for other ocean organizations, including the National Marine Sanctuary Foundation and the Monterey Bay Aquarium.

In 2006, Panetta was part of the presidentially-appointed Iraq Study Group, or Baker Commission, which studied potential changes in U.S. policy in Iraq.

In 2014, Panetta published his memoir &quot;Worthy Fights&quot;, in which he recounted his long career in public service. While overwhelmingly positive in his assessment of the Obama presidency, Panetta aired some disagreements in the book with the President&#x27;s policies in Syria and Iraq. The &quot;New York Post&quot; said: &quot;By failing to persuade Iraq&#x27;s leader to allow a continuing force of US troops, the commander in chief &#x27;created a vacuum . . . and it&#x27;s out of that vacuum that ISIS began to breed,&#x27; Panetta said.&quot;

He regularly obtains fees for speaking engagements, including from the Carlyle Group. He is also a supporter of Booz Allen Hamilton.

== Later career (2013–present) ==
Panetta was a speaker on the third day of the 2016 Democratic National Convention in which Hillary Clinton was nominated to run as the Democratic candidate in the presidential election that year. His speech was booed by antiwar supporters of Bernie Sanders who protested his war record.

Panetta told CBS News that Congress releasing the Nunes Memo, which purported to provide intelligence about the open Russia probe, could cause damage to national security.

Panetta serves as an advisor to the COVID-19 Technology Task Force, a technology industry coalition founded in March 2020 collaborating on solutions to respond to and recover from the COVID-19 pandemic.

In October 2020, Panetta and a group of 50 other former senior intelligence officials signed a letter stating the Hunter Biden laptop controversy had “all the classic earmarks of a Russian disinformation operation&quot; because it contained potentially damaging information to the Biden campaign. However, in 2022, several media outlets, including &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, confirmed the laptop&#x27;s authenticity.

Panetta compared the fall of Kabul to the Taliban in August 2021 to the failed Bay of Pigs Invasion of Cuba in 1961, saying that &quot;President Kennedy took responsibility for what took place. I strongly recommend to President Biden that he take responsibility . . . admit the mistakes that were made.&quot;

Panetta, one of ten living former secretaries of defense, published a &quot;Washington Post&quot; op-ed piece in January 2021 telling President Trump not to involve the military in determining the outcome of the 2020 elections.

In October 2022, Panetta joined the Council for Responsible Social Media project launched by Issue One to address the negative mental, civic, and public health impacts of social media in the United States, cochaired by former House Democratic Caucus leader Dick Gephardt and former Massachusetts Lieutenant Governor Kerry Healey.

In August 2024, Panetta was a speaker on the fourth day of the Democratic National Convention.

In September 2024, Panetta referred to Israel&#x27;s pager attack in Lebanon as an act of terrorism.

In June 2002, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops appointed Panetta to their National Review Board, which was created to look into the Catholic Church&#x27;s sexual abuse scandal. This created controversy because of Panetta&#x27;s pro-choice stance on abortion and other views seen as conflicting with those of the church.
* Beacon Global Strategies, Senior Counselor (May 2014 – present)

Panetta is also a member of the Partnership for a Secure America&#x27;s bipartisan advisory board. The Partnership is a non-profit organization based in Washington, DC that promotes bipartisan solutions to national security and foreign policy issues.

<text>The British Doctors&#x27; Study was a prospective cohort study which ran from 1951 to 2001, and in 1956 provided convincing statistical evidence that tobacco smoking increases risk of lung cancer.

==Context==
Although there had been suspicions of a link between smoking and various diseases, the evidence for this link had been largely circumstantial. In fact, smoking had been advertised as &quot;healthy&quot; for many years, and there had been no clear explanation why rates of lung cancer had soared.

To further investigate the link, the Medical Research Council (MRC) instructed its &quot;Statistical Research Unit&quot; (later the Oxford-based &quot;Clinical Trial Service Unit&quot;) to conduct a prospective study into the link. This approach to medical questions was fairly new: in the 1954 &quot;Preliminary report&quot;, the researchers felt it necessary to offer a definition of the &quot;prospective&quot; principle.

The study, when it was published in 1956, heralded a new type of scientific research, showed the relevance of epidemiology and medical statistics in questions of public health, and vitally linked tobacco smoking to a number of serious diseases.

==The study==
In October 1951, the researchers wrote to all registered physicians in the United Kingdom, and obtained responses in two-thirds, 40,701 of them. No further cohorts were recruited. Because of the limited sample size females were excluded from most analyses and publications focused on the male physicians.

The respondents were stratified into decade of birth, sex and their cause-specific mortality, as well as general physical health and current smoking habits, followed up in further questionnaires in 1957, 1966, 1971, 1978, 1991 and finally in 2001.

==Statistical analysis==
Response rates were quite high, making appropriate statistical analyses possible. The result was, that both lung cancer and &quot;coronary thrombosis&quot; (the then-prevalent term for myocardial infarction, now commonly referred to as &quot;heart attack&quot;) occurred markedly more often in smokers.

In the follow-up reports, published every ten years, more information became available. A major conclusion of the study is, for example, that smoking decreases life span up to 10 years, and that more than 50% of all smokers die of a disease known to be smoking-related, although the excess mortality depends on amount of smoking, specifically, on average, those who smoke until age 30 have no excess mortality, those who smoke until age 40 lose 1 year, those who smoke until 50 lose 4 years, and those who smoke until age 60 lose 7 years.

==Impact and personalities==
The true impact of the study is difficult to gauge, as smoking was not considered a public health problem in the 1950s, and the appreciation of the problem would only grow in the ensuing decades. Nevertheless, the &quot;British Doctors&#x27; Study&quot; was to provide conclusive evidence of linkage between smoking and lung cancer, myocardial infarction, respiratory disease and other smoking-related illnesses.

The original study was run by Richard Doll and Austin Bradford Hill. Richard Peto joined the team in 1971 and would, with Doll, prepare all subsequent reports for publication. Doll and Peto are both celebrated epidemiologists, and their fame is largely based on their pioneering work in the study mentioned. They would continue their work on other cardiovascular studies, for example the more recent Heart Protection Study.

<doc id="757602" wikidata="Q2083421" url="?curid=757602" title="The Third Reich 'n Roll">
<text>The Third Reich &#x27;n Roll is the second studio album by the American art rock group the Residents, released on Ralph Records in 1976. The album consists of two side-long suites of &quot;&#x27;semi-phonetic&#x27; interpretations of Top 40 rock and roll from the Sixties.&quot;

The album generated some controversy due to its cover art and Nazi imagery (promotional photos featured the Residents dressed as giant swastikas and wearing oversized swastika glasses). A window display in Berkeley was met with protests and threats of violence. Regardless, it is considered one of the group&#x27;s masterworks along with most of their material from the 1970s.

== Recording ==
In 1974, the Residents were considering making their follow-up to &quot;Meet the Residents&quot; as a cover album. They initially wanted their friend Snakefinger to play guitar on the album but as he was in England at the time, the group instead searched for a local guitarist, and eventually Gary Phillips of Earth Quake was suggested to them. The Residents recorded &quot;Swastikas on Parade&quot; in one week during October 1974. The next year, the Residents returned to the concept and recorded the second track, titled &quot;Hitler Was a Vegetarian&quot;.

== Music video ==
In 1972, whilst on a break from filming &quot;Vileness Fats&quot;, the Residents produced a short film in which they danced and played in a newspaper-covered room, fully dressed in newspaper suits. Later in 1976, in order to promote their third album (the second one having been recorded in secrecy), the Residents synced this short film up with an edited version of &quot;Swastikas on Parade&quot;, and filmed additional scenes on the set of &quot;Vileness Fats&quot;. The resulting video, entitled &quot;The Residents Play the Third Reich &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot;, drew small controversy on the fact the band&#x27;s newspaper suits resembled Ku Klux Klan outfits, but the Residents have insisted it is not an intentional connection. Regardless, the short film is credited as one of the first examples of the music video as an art form, and is included in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York.

== Concept ==
According to the album&#x27;s original liner notes, entitled &quot;Why do the Residents hate the Beatles?&quot; (in reference to the cover art of their previous album &quot;Meet the Residents&quot;), &quot;the Third Reich &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot; is a commentary on how &quot;rock and roll has brainwashed the youth of the world.&quot;

None of the songs are named anywhere on the album; some are obvious, while others are either unrecognizable or played simultaneously. Notable selections include &quot;In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida&quot;, &quot;Land of a Thousand Dances&quot;, &quot;Double Shot (of My Baby&#x27;s Love)&quot;, &quot;Papa&#x27;s Got a Brand New Bag&quot; (sung in German), &quot;Wipe Out&quot;, &quot;96 Tears&quot;, &quot;Yummy Yummy Yummy&quot;, and &quot;Hey Jude&quot; (paired with &quot;Sympathy for the Devil&quot;).

The Residents would later record a cover of another Rolling Stones song, &quot;(I Can&#x27;t Get No) Satisfaction&quot;, and release it as a single to promote the album. Originally a limited edition, it would be re-released in 1978 to capitalize on the group&#x27;s unexpected success on the British new wave charts.

==Release history==
In 1980, a &quot;Third Reich &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Collector&#x27;s Box&quot; was produced in a limited edition of 30 copies, of which 25 were released. These came with a hand-pressed red-marbled vinyl edition of the record with silk-screened sleeve and labels, in a velvet-lined black wooden box with a sliding panel featuring hand-screened version of the cover art. Also enclosed were two lithographs by Irene Dogmatic, signed and numbered. The entire box was enclosed in a drawstring bag made from a piece of Christo&#x27;s &quot;Running Fence&quot;.

The 1993 CD reissue by Euro Ralph included brand new cover art, featuring Adolf Hitler holding a carrot and Madonna holding a Resident eyeball head. All swastikas were eliminated from this version of the cover.

A special-edition hardcover containing all the original artwork and promotional photos was released on Mute Records in September 2005.

The album was reissued in 2018 as part of the Residents&#x27; &quot;pREServed&quot; remaster campaign, featuring contemporary singles, live performances, and a number of previously unheard outtakes. This reissue also featured a newly updated cover design, derived from the censored German version.

== Reception ==

In the December 31, 1977 issue of &quot;Sounds&quot;, Jon Savage described the album as &quot;Funny – and frightening.&quot; Peter Silverton described the album as the Residents&#x27; &quot;one unqualified masterpiece,&quot; and &quot;the best party game of the Seventies.&quot; &quot;Fact&quot; ranked the album at No. 70 on their &quot;Top 100 Albums of the 1970s&quot;, calling it &quot;the precursor for everything from the KLF to Matmos, the Church of the SubGenius to the Fall.&quot;

== Legacy ==
The album is considered by some to be a precursor for mashup music, and the Residents are sometimes credited with popularizing the practice of sampling in commercial music. The album also features what is thought to be the first James Brown sample on a commercially released record, borrowing a horn hit directly from the original King Records 45 of &quot;Papa&#x27;s Got a Brand New Bag&quot; on &quot;Swastikas on Parade&quot;. This sample predates hip-hop&#x27;s adaptations of Brown riffs, beats, and soundbites by about 15 years.

The practice of cover songs went on to be a staple of the Residents&#x27; musical oeuvre. Later notable cover projects include the 1977 single &quot;The Beatles play the Residents and the Residents play the Beatles&quot;, the 1980s American Composers series (spawning two albums: &quot;George &amp; James&quot; and &quot;Stars &amp; Hank Forever&quot;) and &quot;The King &amp; Eye&quot;, a 1989 album of Elvis Presley covers.

The Residents would perform the Swingin&#x27; Medallions&#x27; &quot;Double Shot&quot; in its entirety in 1988 for a single to promote their album &quot;God in Three Persons&quot;, in which the song&#x27;s main riff is a recurring motif. The song would also be referenced on the 1989 Cube E show.

== History ==
This area was the heartland of Armenians, who lived in these areas from the time of Hayk in the 3rd millennium BCE right up to the late 19th century when the Ottoman Empire seized all the land from the natives. In the 9th century BC the Van area was the center of the Urartian kingdom. The area was a major Armenian population center. The region came under the control of the Armenian Orontids in the 7th century BC and later Persians in the mid-6th century BC. By the early 2nd century BC it was part of the Kingdom of Armenia. It became an important center during the reign of the Armenian king, Tigranes II, who founded the city of Tigranakert in the 1st century BC.

=== Seljuks and Ottomans ===
With the victory of the Seljuk Turks at the Battle of Malazgirt in 1071, just north of Lake Van, it became a part of the Seljuq Empire and later the Ottoman Empire during their century long wars with their neighboring Iranian Safavid arch rivals, in which Sultan Selim I managed to conquer the area over the latter. The area continued to be contested and was passed on between the Ottoman Empire and the Safavids (and their subsequent successors, the Afsharids and Qajars) for many centuries until the Battle of Chaldiran which set the borders till this day. During the 19th century it was reorganized as Van Vilayet.

=== Republic of Turkey ===
In 1927 the office of the Inspector General was created, which governed with martial law. The province was included in the first Inspectorate General (&quot;Umumi Müfettişlik,&quot; UM) over which the Inspector General ruled. The UM span over the provinces of Hakkâri, Siirt, Van, Mardin, Bitlis, Sanlıurfa, Elaziğ and Diyarbakır. The Inspectorate General were dissolved in 1952 during the Government of the Democrat Party.

Between July 1987 and July 2000, Van Province was within the OHAL region, which was ruled by a Governor within a state of emergency.

==== Modern history ====
According to the 2012 Metropolitan Municipalities Law (Law No. 6360), all Turkish provinces with a population more than 750 000, will have a metropolitan municipality and the districts within the metropolitan municipalities will be second level municipalities. The law also creates new districts within the provinces in addition to present districts. The current Governor is Mehmet Emin Bilmez.

<doc id="757623" wikidata="Q5526323" url="?curid=757623" title="Gas Works Park">
<text>Gas Works Park is a park located in Seattle, Washington, United States. It has a public park on the site of the former Seattle Gas Light Company gasification plant, located on the north shore of Lake Union at the south end of the Wallingford neighborhood. The park was added to the National Register of Historic Places on January 2, 2013, over a decade after being nominated.

Gas Works Park contains remnants of the sole remaining coal gasification plant in the United States. The plant operated from 1906 to 1956 and was bought by the city of Seattle for use as a park in 1962. The park opened to the public in 1975. It was designed by Seattle landscape architect Richard Haag, who won the American Society of Landscape Architects Presidents Award of Design Excellence for the project. The plant&#x27;s conversion into a park was completed by Daviscourt Construction Company of Seattle. It was originally named Myrtle Edwards Park, after the city councilwoman who had spearheaded the drive to acquire the site, who died in a car crash in 1969. In 1972, the Edwards family requested that her name be removed from that of the park because the design called for the retention of the plant. In 1976, Elliott Bay Park (just north of Seattle&#x27;s Belltown neighborhood) was renamed Myrtle Edwards Park.

==Overview==

Gas Works Park incorporates numerous pieces of the old plant. Some stand as ruins, while others have been reconditioned, painted, and incorporated into a children&#x27;s &quot;play barn&quot; structure, constructed in part from what was the plant&#x27;s exhauster-compressor building. A web site affiliated with the &quot;Seattle Times&quot; newspaper said, &quot;Gas Works Park is easily the strangest park in Seattle and may rank among the strangest in the world.&quot;

Gas Works Park also features an artificial kite-flying hill with a sculptured sundial built into its summit. The park was for many years the exclusive site of a summer series of &quot;Peace Concerts&quot;. These concerts are now rotated among several Seattle parks. The park also has for many years hosted one of Seattle&#x27;s two major Independence Day fireworks events; in 2009, it was the sole such event. The park is the traditional end point of the Solstice Cyclists and the starting point for Seattle&#x27;s World Naked Bike Ride.

The park originally constituted one end of the Burke–Gilman Trail, laid out along the abandoned right-of-way of the Seattle, Lake Shore and Eastern Railway. However, the trail has now been extended several kilometers northwest, past the Fremont neighborhood toward Ballard.

The soil and groundwater of the site was contaminated during its operation as a gasification plant. The 1971 Master Plan called for &quot;cleaning and greening&quot; the park through bio-phytoremediation. Although the presence of organic pollutants had been substantially reduced by the mid-1980s, the US Environmental Protection Agency and Washington State Department of Ecology required additional measures, including removing and capping wastes, and air sparging in the southeast portion of the site to try to remove benzene that was a theoretical source of pollutants reaching Lake Union via ground water. There are no known areas of surface soil contamination remaining on the site today, although tar occasionally still oozes from some locations within the site and is isolated and removed.

Despite its somewhat isolated location, the park has been the site of numerous political rallies. These included a seven-month continuous vigil under the name PeaceWorks Park, in opposition to the Gulf War. The vigil began at a peace concert in August 1990 and continued until after the end of the shooting war. Among the people who participated in the vigil at were former congressman and future governor Mike Lowry, then-city-councilperson Sue Donaldson, 1960s icon Timothy Leary, and beat poet Allen Ginsberg.

Gas Works Park has been a setting for films such as &quot;Singles&quot; and &quot;10 Things I Hate About You&quot;. It has been featured twice on the travel-based television reality show &quot;The Amazing Race&quot;: once as the Finish Line for Season 3 and another time as the starting line for Season 10. The park was the site of the 2021 NHL Expansion Draft for the Seattle Kraken.

The building is a Seattle city landmark and a Washington State landmark.

==History ==
Gas Works Park occupies a promontory between the northwest and northeast arms of Lake Union. Little is known of pre–Euro-American site history, but there were Native American settlements around Lake Union. Native names for Lake Union include &quot;Kah-chug&quot;, &quot;Tenas Chuck&quot;, and &quot;Xa&#x27;ten&quot;. In the mid-19th century Thomas Mercer named it &quot;Lake Union&quot; in expectation of future canals linking it to Puget Sound and to Lake Washington. Dense forests came to the water&#x27;s edge and the lake drained into Salmon Bay through a stream &quot;full of windfalls and brush, impassable even for a canoe&quot;. (Bass 1947, p. 33) Lake Union in the 1860–70s was a popular vacation spot with Seattleites for summer house-boating and picnicking.

Several sawmills were operating on Lake Union&#x27;s shore by the 1850s, taking advantage of the dense forests. Beginning in 1872, Seattle Coal and Transportation Company ferried coal from its Renton Hill mines across the lake for portage across to Puget Sound. In the 1880s came the Denny sawmill at the south end of Lake Union, brick manufacturing, ship building, a tannery, and iron works. Canals with small locks were cut in 1885 from Lake Washington to Lake Union, and from Lake Union to Salmon Bay. These were suitable for transporting logs, but not for shipping. The arrival of the Seattle, Lake Shore and Eastern Railway in 1887 ensured that Lake Union would continue to be a focus for industrial development. In 1900 the Seattle Gas Light Company began to purchase lots on this promontory (Secrist, Title Search) and its coal gas plant went into operation in 1906. At the time the neighborhood was known as Edgewater (see map, :Commons:File:Seattle map 1909.jpg.)

Seattle Gas Light Company purchased lots on the north shore promontory from 1900 to 1909. Despite the fact that the land was being acquired by the gas company, the Olmsted Brothers in 1903 recommended that &quot;...the point of land between the northeast and northwest arms of Lake Union and the railroad should be secured as a local park, because of its advantages for commanding views over the lake and for boating, and for a playground.&quot; (Olmsted Brothers 1903, p. 47)

In 1911, Virgil Bogue produced a civic master plan for Seattle&#x27;s Municipal Plans Commission in which he promoted the idea of Lake Union as an industrial area: &quot;The fact that (Lake Union) is located in the very heart of the city indicates that if properly developed it will become a most important factor in the commercial and business activities of the city.&quot; (Seattle Municipal Plans Commission 1911, p. 78) Completion of the Lake Washington Ship Canal and Ballard Locks in 1917 guaranteed the success of shipping and shipbuilding industries on Lake Union and thus of the Bogue vision, despite the fact that his plan was defeated by voters.
The Lake Station gas manufacturing plant on Lake Union was the largest private utility then existing in Seattle. It operated as &quot;Seattle Lighting Company&quot; until 1930, when the name was changed to &quot;Seattle Gas Company&quot;. Its primary product was illuminating gas (so-called because it was used for lighting) manufactured from coal. The gas was later also used for cooking, refrigeration, and heating homes and water. It was also called city gas to distinguish it from natural gas. The gas was made from coal up to 1937 when the high cost of operating the old coke oven and coal-gas generating sets forced a change-over to oil. A pair of oil-to-gas generators was built in 1937 and the old coal-gas facilities were disassembled. In 1946–47, two more oil gas generator pairs were constructed to keep up with demand for gas. Since by-products from gas manufacturing had strong markets of their own, new equipment was installed at the same time to produce &quot;Gasco charcoal briquets&quot;, toluene, solvent naphtha, sulfur, xylene, and resin tar.

Primary manufacturing and support facilities consisted of storage tanks, boiler house, pump and compressors house, offices, and laboratories. Onsite support included electrical, carpentry, machine, blacksmith, and welding shops. Additional facilities included a stable, first aid stations, and a fire-safe house for storing fire control materials. Running through the north portion of the site was Burlington Northern Railroad&#x27;s -wide right-of-way. Train trestles from the coal days were still in place in front of the laboratories and offices building.

By 1954, the Lake Station plant used of gas main to serve Seattle, Renton, Kent and Tukwila. The plant served approximately 43,198 customers in 1940, decreasing to 36,200 in 1954. The company averaged about 130 employees, with four crews of 23 men per shift, rotating 24 hours a day on a 7-day run. Production of city gas ended in 1956 when Seattle converted to natural gas.

Though gas production ceased in 1956, the buildings and manufacturing structures were still intact in 1962 when the city of Seattle began purchasing the abandoned gas works. The $1.34 million purchase price was provided by Forward Thrust bonds, HUD payments were made from 1962 to 1972, and the debt was retired.

The abandoned gas-production plant and its land were deeded to the city of Seattle in 1975 and Gas Works Park was opened to the public that same year.

==Park development and remediation efforts==
During this period, there was a considerable public discussion about whether the site should be developed or made into a park. Park advocates led by Myrtle Edwards prevailed. In 1970, Richard Haag Associates (RHA) were retained by the Seattle Park Board to perform a site analysis and master plan for a new park at the gas plant site. RHA opened an on-site office to research and analyze the plant site. Richard Haag realized that the site contained the last gas works and a unique opportunity for preservation. Haag recommended preservation of portions of the plant for its &quot;historic, esthetic and utilitarian value&quot;. (Master Plan, April 1971) After an intense public appeal to convince the public of the value of the plant, RHA&#x27;s 1971 master plan for an industrial preservation park was unanimously approved by the Park Board. The proposal centered on recycling the buildings, production structures, machinery, and even the grounds themselves. Through bio-phyto-remediation techniques, the soil and water would be &quot;cleaned and greened&quot;. Through preservation and adaptive reuse of key structures, the rich history of the site and thus of an important aspect of Seattle would be preserved and revealed.

The Washington State Department of Ecology announced plans in 2022 to begin the final efforts in soil and shoreline remediation, comprising an estimated area of surrounding the park. The cleanup is scheduled to begin in 2027 and will help to remove such contaminants as arsenic, carbazole, dibenzofuran and nickel. A successful decontamination may allow users official access to the waters of Lake Union from the park. The cleanup project is estimated to cost $73 million and would be funded by the city government with some costs reimbursed from the Department of Ecology.

===Landscape architect===

Gas Works Park is the work of its designer, Richard Haag, a Seattle landscape architect.

==Features==
The park site consists of of land projecting into Lake Union with of shoreline. The site is bordered by North Northlake Way at the north and abuts Lake Union on the east and south. The Wallingford neighborhood sits to the north. Immediately adjacent to the park are remnants of the industrial development of the area. The industrial dominance is rapidly being replaced by retail development. North of North 40th Street the area is predominantly a residential neighborhood.

The park is entered through a landscaped parking area or through the Burke-Gilman Trail, a bike and walking path that connects Puget Sound to Lake Washington. Dividing the parking area from the park is a grassy berm and rows of trees demarcating the old railroad right of way. The park is composed of seven areas: Earth Mound, North Lawn, Towers, Prow, Picnic Lawn and Shelter, Play Barn, and South Lawn. The Earth Mound, Prow, and Lawns are open areas intended for passive and active recreation and offer magnificent views. The Towers, Play Barn, and Picnic Shelter are adapted from the original manufacturing structures.

GWP was designed to be an urban, intensively used pleasure ground utilizing unique structures. &quot;The traditional escape from the city into the sylvan settings of remote areas has changed for many people into a seeking of a more active encounter. Introspection and retreat are easily accomplished without physical isolation, but facilities for social interaction with persons other than intimate friends are more scarce with respect to population growth. ...new sites should be offered in a vast and varied park system to accommodate experimentation and innovation in both design and program.&quot; (Master Plan, 1971) Because of the Gas Plant structures and the attractive setting, GWP complements the rich heritage of Seattle&#x27;s Post-Victorian parks and offers expanded programs in ways that the latter cannot. Throughout every year hundreds of thousands of people use GWP. They gather to celebrate Independence Day and watch fireworks. Concerts, kite-flying, jogging, public meetings, and the open space and views of the park itself are attractions that keep GWP in constant use.

However, there is no access to Lake Union. The lake’s sediment contains hazardous substances. Therefore, aquatic activities like swimming, boating, fishing and wading are prohibited.

===The earth mound===
Part of the master plan, known as the &quot;Great Mound&quot;, hill was molded out of thousands of cubic yards of rubble from building foundations covered with fresh topsoil. The sundial at the top of the mound was created by two local artists, Chuck Greening and Kim Lazare. Formed out of concrete and delineated with rocks, shells, glass, bronze and many other materials, the sundial tells time by using the body of the visitor as the gnomon. The viewer&#x27;s shadow tells the time of day and the season.

===Lawn areas===

The park contains several lawn areas. Soil has been bioremediated with 18&quot; of sewage sludge and sawdust. This process has decontaminated the soil and allowed for the growth of field grass which makes possible constant, hard use with low maintenance.

===Towers===
There are two groups: 1) six synthetic natural gas generator towers with their attendant processing towers, and 2) oil absorber and oil cooler (between the play barn and the generators). The generators operated in pairs and were built at different times.

(A): Towers 1 and 2 (largest and closest to the lake) are Semet-Solvay–type generators built in 1937–38. Each has a single outer shell made of welded steel lined inside with refractory brick. Tower 1 is and Tower 2 is tall. At their peak they could manufacture 6 million cubic feet (170,000 m3) of gas a day.

B): Towers 3 and 4 were built in 1947, towers 5 and 6 (northernmost), in 1947. They have the same brick inner shell and welded-steel outer shell construction as Towers 1 and 2, but are smaller. All four towers have an outer diameter of and are tall. The brick liner has an inside diameter of and is high. The outer shells are equipped with nozzles for pipe and instrument connections, access doors, air blast doors, gas outlets, and sight holes. The towers rest on concrete pedestals. (Blueprints, 1945–46).

Wash boxes and scrubbers associated with generators 3-6 were also built in 1946–47. The small tanks ( diameter, tall, each mounted on three supporting legs) next to the generators are wash boxes, one per generator. For each pair of wash boxes there is one primary scrubber that rests on a concrete pedestal and stands tall ( diameter). The output from the two primary scrubbers goes into the single secondary scrubber of welded steel construction ( diameter, tall). Farthest from the generators are two small tanks (about tall) that were the original secondary scrubbers. All piping that connects these towers is of plate steel. (Blueprints, 1945–46)

Between the generators and the play barn stand the oil absorber (80 feet) and cooler (40 feet). The cooling towers lowered the temperature of the light oil-gas mixture from the scrubbers, then the oils were separated from the gas in the oil absorber tower. The light oils were the secondary products benzene, toluene and solvent naphtha.

===The prow===

This concrete platform was built in 1936 as an unloading area for coal. The platform was integrated into the park design and handrails placed at the lakeside edges.

===Play barn and picnic shelter===
The buildings date back to the original coal-gas facility (ca 1910) and were constructed of wood. The pump house (also known as the exhauster house) is about and the boiler house is about . The wood frames of both buildings remain intact and in place on concrete slab foundations.

The boiler house, now the picnic shelter, originally housed two boilers. One provided steam for the gasification process; the other provided steam for the steam engines that powered the pump house compressors. The tubes from one boiler remain in place at the eastern end of the building and are an impressive display of seldom-seen industrial technology.

The pump house is now the play barn. Most of the pumps, compressors, and piping are still in place. The compressor&#x27;s flywheel ran continuously to keep the plant operating 24 hours a day. In this building air was compressed for the oxygen-extraction process, the oxygen was then pumped to the generators for the first stage of gas manufacturing, and the final product was compressed and pumped to either the storage tank or down the lines of main to customers.

Outside the play barn, the sole surviving smoke arrestor hood has been refurbished as a play structure for climbing. Designed and built by the company in 1935, three were installed in order to reduce pollutant emissions.

Concrete train trestles now form a part of the GWP entrance. They were part of the original 1906 gas plant and ran along the north side of the office and laboratories building. Nothing remains of this building, but the trestles show where the train tracks ended and coal was delivered. Coal cars would ride up the trestles and release coal into hoppers parked under the trestles.

== Historical significance ==
The original structures qualify as industrial archaeology and are the last remaining examples of a type of technology. The structures have been preserved and are integrated into a park design. Paul Goldberger wrote in the &quot;New York Times&quot; that &quot;Seattle is about to have one of the nation&#x27;s most advanced pieces of urban landscape design. The complex array of towers, tanks and pipes of the gas works forms a powerful industrial still life ... serving both as a visual focus for the park and as a monument to the city&#x27;s industrial past. The park represents a complete reversal from a period when industrial monuments were regarded, even by preservationists, as ugly intrusions on the landscape, to a time when such structures as the gas works are recognized for their potential ability to enhance the urban experience.&quot; (NY Times, 8/30/75) The possibility for National Historic Landmark status was recognized in 1971 when Victor Steinbrueck inventoried the Gas Works and Eric DeLony of the National Park Service wrote: &quot;Gas Works Park will not only be a unique first in the United States, if not the world, but will set an important precedent for the future preservation of industrial structure through an imaginative plan for adaptive use.&quot;

Although not all of the structures were saved, the character defining and prominent group of towers remains. The reuse of the pump house and boiler house has maintained building structure and much of the machinery. The site retains its original boundaries and lake frontage.

The Seattle Gas Company&#x27;s production plant located on Lake Union, now known as Gas Works Park, was co-founded by one of Seattle&#x27;s foremost pioneers, Arthur A. Denny. Throughout the first half of the twentieth century, the Gas Company was a significant participant in and contributor to the growth of Seattle and adjoining communities. Although its primary product was city gas for energy, the plant also manufactured other basic products necessary for urban growth: tar for roofing; lampblack for pigment in tires and ink; charcoal briquets for odor-free and efficient home heating; sulfur for insecticides, ammonium sulfate, and sulfuric acid; and toluene for use in explosives. Toluene was in high demand during World War II, and production of it was essential to the war effort (e.g., for making TNT and various types of gunpowder). Through these products the gas works contributed in an integral way not only to daily commercial and domestic life in Seattle but also to interests at a national level.

The structures and machinery standing in GWP today are remnants of the Industrial Revolution that transformed the face of the world. GWP is the sole survivor of gas works from that era in the United States, preserved as a public park. It is the only site that could be documented with most of the generating equipment intact. During its production era, this gasification plant was only one of 1400 such plants in the U.S. Though obsolete, these towers, machines, and buildings are a monument to humanity&#x27;s inventiveness and offer a visual statement of pioneering technology. As UW Professor of Anthropology Kenneth Read expressed it, &quot;History sits on this little wasteland, not only the parochial history of a given city, but also a fragment of the chronicle of world and culture. It is certainly as valuable a document as anything preserved in the Museum of History and Industry.&quot; (Read 1969, pp. 43–45)

In addition to its early history, the impact of Gas Works Park on land reclamation and industrial preservation attitudes and techniques extends beyond Seattle. GWP has gained national and international standing as a prototype for industrial site conversions. It is studied, cited as an exemplary model, and referenced in educational textbooks and scholarly works. Since opening, GWP has won numerous awards for design excellence, vision, and innovation. The jury for the President&#x27;s Award of Excellence stated: &quot;A remarkably original and attractive example of how to reclaim a seemingly hopeless and obsolete industrial installation. Instead of being destroyed or disguised, it has been transformed into a lighthearted environment ... A project of historical significance for the community. A symbol of American technology preserved.&quot;
&quot;The black shapes of the towers on their grassy point leap out with startling clarity against the bright collage of the shoreline, silhouettes that might be the pictogram for the works of industrial man.&quot; (Landscape Australia, February 1980)

<text>Andreas Karavis is a non-existent Greek poet created by Canadian poet David Solway.

In October 1999, &quot;Books in Canada&quot; published an article titled &quot;Modern Homer&quot; about a supposedly newly discovered Greek poet Andreas Karavis, with an interview, a photograph, and an essay by David Solway. In the piece, Solway claimed that he had hunted the reclusive fisherman-poet for years until he had finally met him in 1991, and that he had begun to translate his poems in 1993.

Solway claimed that Karavis had been born in 1932 in Chania, Crete, and that he lived on the Dodecanese island of Lipsi. After Karavis&#x27;s education on Serifos, disrupted by World War II and the civil war, he became a fisherman and settled on Amorgos, selling his books of poetry in local harbors. Amongst his supposed collections was &quot;White Poems&quot; (1965). After having laboured in obscurity for the greater part of his life, he had become one of the country&#x27;s most acclaimed and admired writers with the 1989 publication of &quot;The Dream Masters&quot;.

In reality, Karavis was the creation of Solway. However, other people joined the joke. In the next issue there was a letter from a self-declared expert on Greek poetry, &quot;Fred Reed&quot;. He did not dispute Karavis&#x27; existence, but claimed that Karavis was in fact a smuggler, not a fisherman, and that the first poems were nothing else than pirated translations from a group of expatriate Canadians.

Later, press attaché Yiorgos Chouliaris of the Greek embassy wrote to Solway to congratulate him for &quot;imaginative effort&quot;. Solway convinced him to join the hoax.

The fame of Karavis spread. There were reports of international conferences about his poetry in Thessaloniki and Coimbra.(Source?) Solway met a writer who claimed that he had admired Karavis for many years, and someone who said that Karavis was more worthy of the Nobel Prize than more famous Greek poets. He even received two postcards signed with Karavis&#x27;s name.(Source?)

In 2000, Chouliaris was one of the hosts at the launch of a translation of Karavis&#x27;s poems, &quot;Saracen Island: The Poetry of Andreas Karavis&quot;. Although Solway claimed to be the translator, the work was entirely his creation. A man who claimed to be Karavis appeared, wearing a fisherman&#x27;s cap and speaking something that at least sounded like Greek.

Soon afterward Matthew Hayes, a columnist of &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; in Toronto, wrote an article entitled &quot;Karavis: Greek god of poetry or literary hoax?&quot;. In a 2001 issue of &quot;Lingua Franca&quot; magazine, Solway finally confessed in public that he had invented the poet, and that the man who had appeared at the book launch, purporting to be Karavis, was actually Solway&#x27;s dentist.

Solway has said that he had created Karavis as an &quot;alter ego and heteronym&quot; to gain new inspiration for his poetry.

<text>Not Available is the fourth studio album by the American band the Residents, released in 1978. The album was allegedly meant to only be released once its creators completely forgot about its existence (adhering to their &quot;Theory of Obscurity,&quot; in which an artist&#x27;s purest work is created without an audience) - however, due to ongoing delays in the release of &quot;Eskimo&quot;, &quot;Not Available&quot; was released to supply the demand for new Residents material, given their unexpected critical and commercial success following the release of the &quot;Duck Stab&quot; EP.

== History ==
It is said that the lyrics and themes of &quot;Not Available&quot; arose from personal tensions within the group, and that the project began as a private psychodrama before being adapted into a possible operetta. While the project never took off theatrically, it was still molded into a sort of concept album, taking use of assorted musical ideas, some of them recorded for the group&#x27;s unfinished film project, &quot;Vileness Fats.&quot; It is unknown if further overdubs were added onto the album predating its release in 1978, though the pREServed single “Not Available (Work In Progress)” would indicate that additional overdubs and edits were made.

It is possible that the album was shelved not to fulfill the &quot;Theory of Obscurity,&quot; but because it was simply too personally revealing.

== Music ==
The music on &quot;Not Available&quot; is fairly different from any other music the Residents recorded in the time period it was supposedly conceived in, both in compositional skill and audio quality. Fans have theorized that the music could have been recorded at a later period.

The album is split into four parts and an epilogue, with the Residents&#x27; characteristic use of drum machines, classical percussion, cartoonish vocals, grand piano and horns, as well as notably the use of string synthesizers. The lyrics and plot of &quot;Not Available&quot; are told in a densely surrealistic manner, notably making use of a Greek chorus and a particular piano composition that is presented as a theme for one of the album&#x27;s characters - the full recording was released in 2010 as &quot;Available Piece.&quot;

A 2011 reissue of the album extended its duration by approximately seven minutes, allegedly its original length. A mix of the album&#x27;s multitrack tapes (originally titled &quot;X is for Xtra&quot;) was released in 2019 on a deluxe edition of the album.

==Critical reception==

The &quot;Spin Alternative Record Guide&quot; labeled the album &quot;free-form avant-gardism.&quot;

== Track listing ==
=== 1987 CD bonus tracks ===
Tracks 6-11 taken from &quot;Title in Limbo&quot;, a 1983 album made in collaboration with Renaldo and the Loaf.
=== 2011 extended edition ===
=== 2018 pREServed edition ===

After 10 minutes of silence following track 19, an unlisted track plays lasting 4:46.

<text>Ford Motor Company of Australia Limited (known by its trading name Ford Australia) is the Australian subsidiary of United States–based automaker Ford Motor Company. It was founded in 1925 as an Australian outpost of Ford Motor Company of Canada. At that time, Ford Canada was a separate company from Ford in the US. Henry Ford had granted the manufacturing rights of Ford motor vehicles in the British Empire (later the Commonwealth) to Canadian investors.

Ford Australia&#x27;s first products were Model T cars assembled from complete knock-down (CKD) kits provided by Ford of Canada. Of the many models that followed, the best known was the Falcon produced from 1972 to 2016, originally a US model introduced in Australia in 1960 and eventually adapted to Australian requirements and road conditions.

== History ==
===Early developments===

On 31 March 1925, Ford announced that its Australian headquarters were to be at Geelong, Victoria. The first Australian-built Ford was a Model T launched on 1 July 1925. The improvised production line was in a disused Geelong wool storage warehouse while construction was in progress of a factory several miles away, in an area later renamed Norlane.

In 1928, the factory switched to the Model A, which was followed in 1932 by the Ford V8.

In 1934, the company released a coupé utility based on the US Model A Ford &quot;Closed Cab Pickup Truck&quot; that had been produced for six years from 1928. The local designer was Ford engineer Louis (Lewis) Bandt. During the Great Depression, banks would not extend credit to farmers to purchase passenger cars, contending they were unnecessary luxuries. However, they would lend money for the purchase of &quot;working&quot; vehicles. The coupé utility fulfilled the need of farmers to have a workhorse which could also be used, as a well-known saying went: &quot;to take the wife to church on Sunday and the pigs to the market on Monday&quot;.

In 1956, the company bought a large tract of land in the northern Melbourne suburb of Campbellfield to build the Broadmeadows Assembly Plant, and in July 1961 announced that the new Melbourne factory would become the company headquarters.

=== End of Australian production ===

In 2009, the parent Ford company, seeking to avoid the Chapter 11 bankruptcy that had already befallen General Motors and Chrysler, began abandoning overseas projects. By about July 2009, Ford Australia had received permission from Detroit to add a new small car to its Falcon production line. On 23 May 2013, Ford Australia announced that it would leave the Australian market after 88 years due to uncompetitive manufacturing costs and lacklustre sales. The carmaker&#x27;s annual financial report, for the previous year, showed a loss of A$141 million (£90m/US$136m) after tax for the 2012 financial year. This followed a loss of A$290m in 2011 and a total loss of A$600m over the preceding five years. As a result, 1200 staff would lose their jobs.

Ford had two main factories, both in Victoria: located in the Geelong suburb of Norlane and the northern Melbourne suburb of Campbellfield. The Ford Discovery Centre, a museum of the history of the Ford Motor Company in Australia that was also located in Geelong, closed; the site was then occupied by Deakin University.

From 1972 to 2016, Ford Falcons were fully Australian designed. The company produced the Territory SUV, which also ended production in 2016. Production of the Falcon ended with the closure of the Broadmeadows (Campbellfield) and Geelong engine and panel stamping plants. The Geelong factory produced its last Australian-made straight-six and V8 engines on 26 September 2016. Assembly at Broadmeadows concluded on 7 October 2016, ending Ford&#x27;s 88-year history in Australia.

Ford Australia was one of Ford&#x27;s five product development centres globally. Since the end of factory operations in 2016, it fully imports cars and trucks for the Asia/Pacific region after the closure of its Australian operations. It was expected to retain about 1300 workers in Australia.

== Facilities ==

Ford Australia was also designated as one of five (worldwide) full-service Regional Product Development Centres, specifically for the Asia Pacific and African regions. Products launched so far include the Ford Ikon and Fiesta in India and the Ford Bantam ute and Ikon (a sedan version of the Fiesta) in South Africa, and has also developed the new Ranger.

On 24 January 2019, engineers and designers were among more than 100 workers to lose their jobs at Ford in Victoria. About 40 salaried workers, 75 hourly workers and 90 contractors across Ford bases in Broadmeadows, Lara and Geelong would be affected, the company confirmed, as the automaker further consolidated its operations. Ford&#x27;s engineering work on its Ranger ute and other models &quot;will be led out of the United States&quot;, the company said in a statement. Remaining Australian-based engineers would have a &quot;strategic role&quot; in developing a new medium-sized pick-up truck for Ford and the German brand, the automaker said.

== Models produced ==
Ford Australia started by assembling Model Ts. As Ford introduced new models, they were assembled in Australia. During World War II, Ford Australia ceased producing cars to commence military production to support the war effort.

After World War II, Ford recommenced assembly of imported Ford models. Initially, they assembled the UK sourced Pilot, then a range of British cars, including the Prefect, Anglia, Consul, Zephyr and Zodiac. Ford also assembled the Canadian Ford V8.

=== Hatchback ===
The Ford Laser was produced in Ford&#x27;s plant at Flemington in Sydney, from 1981 until September 1994 when the plant closed, after which they were fully imported from Japan. The Laser was replaced by the Ford Focus in 2002. It is currently offered in sedan and hatchback variants with a 2.0L engine, which is one of the market leaders in sales. The Fiesta, a global Ford product, has also been offered between 2004 and 2022.

=== Mid-size ===
Mid-size cars formerly assembled in Australia included the Ford Cortina, Capri and Escort, from the UK. These were adapted for the Australian market: for example, from 1972, the Cortina was available with the option of either a 3.3-litre or 4.1-litre six-cylinder engine, and the Escort could be offered across the range with the Cortina&#x27;s 2.0-litre motor. In 1977, lack of capacity required the Cortina wagon to be assembled in Renault&#x27;s (now long since closed) Australian factory in Heidelberg, Victoria.

The Cortina&#x27;s replacement, the Mazda 626-based Telstar, was initially assembled in Australia. In 1989 the Telstar sedan was replaced by the locally assembled Ford Corsair which was essentially a rebadged Nissan Pintara. When Nissan shut down its Australian manufacturing operations in 1992 the Telstar nameplate was reintroduced, and as before it was a rebadged and respecced Mazda 626. In 1995 the Telstar was dropped in favour of the Mondeo, imported from Belgium.

Ford Australia dropped the Mondeo in 2001, arguing at the time that the segment of the market in which it competed was in decline, but in 2007, it announced that it would introduce the new Mk IV model in Australia.

=== Large car ===

The Ford Falcon was manufactured in Australia to a North American design, with the first model rolling off the production line at Ford&#x27;s Broadmeadows plant on 28 June 1960. It differed little from the American design apart from conversion to right hand drive, and the Falcon soon proved unable to cope on harsh Australian roads, sparking a major effort to introduce improvements to its reliability. By the mid-1960s, the car was substantially different from its North American cousin and was offered in sedan, wagon, coupé, utility and panel van styles.

Production of the North American Falcon, on which the Falcon was by then loosely based, ended in 1970, obliging Ford Australia to pursue its design independently. The first true all-Australian Ford Falcon was launched as the XA model in June 1972. The XD and XE generation Falcons (1979-1984) followed the styling trends of Ford Europe&#x27;s Granada II model, but were still purely an Australian design from an engineering standpoint and had virtually no parts commonality with the European product.

The Falcon had been an Australian &quot;automotive icon&quot; for most of its 56 years in production, playing a prominent part in Australian popular culture and motor racing. Falcons have served as taxis, police cars, family runabouts, and transport for tradespeople. They have been winners many times in the Australian Touring Car Championship and at the annual Bathurst 1000 touring car race, where the Falcon&#x27;s reputation for engineering excellence was cemented by the early 1970s through the Falcon GT and GTHO &quot;muscle car&quot; variants.

Ford manufactured more than four million units between 1960 and 2016, and topped sales charts on many occasions. By 2016 the Falcon line-up was offered only in sedan and utility body styles; in the past, panel vans, station wagons and hardtops had been offered. Falcons had been prominent as taxis in Australia and New Zealand, along with sister car, the Ford Fairlane. Performance variants of the Falcon were used extensively for pursuit work for many years.

=== Luxury car ===

Ford Australia produced a range of full-size luxury cars alongside the Falcon for most of its production history. These models were named the Fairlane and the LTD. The first Fairlane, released in 1959, was an Australian-assembled version of the US Fairlane. Assembly of US cars continued until 1967, when Ford Australia designed its own luxury car, the ZA Fairlane. Heavily based on the existing XR Falcon, it had an extended wheelbase, longer boot and modest styling changes.

Ford Fairlanes were often preferred vehicles among politicians and businessmen. In 1972 a new model – the LTD – joined the second generation of Fairlanes the LTD. It was in effect a Fairlane with more features such as retractable headlights, a vinyl roof and an even longer wheelbase. From the third generation of Fairlane onwards, the LTD shared the same wheelbase and body as the Fairlane, being marketed as a more luxurious version of the Fairlane rather than being a completely different car.

The Fairlane topped Australian luxury car sales for two decades before its gradual downfall started in the late 1980s with the rising importation of European models such as BMW and Mercedes Benz. By the turn of the millennium, the Fairlane had been overtaken by the Holden Statesman in sales. In 2007, Ford Australia announced it would be cancelling further production of the Fairlane and LTD beyond the 2007 model year, citing falling sales and an uncertain future in the full-size luxury market. With the backing of large-volume exports to overseas markets, the Holden Statesman and Caprice then became the sole full-size extended wheelbase luxury models until their demise in 2017.

=== SUV ===

Between 2004 and 2016, the Ford Territory had been built on the same production line as the Falcon. The Territory (technically a crossover) had regularly been the most popular SUV in Australia.

<text>Duck Stab!/Buster &amp; Glen, later renamed Duck Stab, is the fifth studio album by American art rock group the Residents, released in November 1978.

It is named after the first side of the album, &quot;Duck Stab!&quot;, a seven-song EP released earlier in 1978; &quot;Buster &amp; Glen&quot;, the B-side of the album, was intended to follow &quot;Duck Stab!&quot;. After the first pressing of &quot;Duck Stab!&quot; quickly sold out, which was an oddity for the band, they decided to re-release it as one side of an album, with the unreleased &quot;Buster and Glen&quot; as side two. This was also in part due to the poor audio quality of the original &quot;Duck Stab!&quot; EP.

The shorter length of the songs made the album more accessible for fans who had recently heard the band&#x27;s cover of &quot;Satisfaction&quot;, and songs like &quot;Constantinople&quot; and &quot;Hello Skinny&quot; helped cement the band&#x27;s cult following. Some noted that the Residents were approaching commercial elements with this EP, but they were purposefully avoiding others, such as a traditional chorus/verse structure. This album features guitar by Philip &quot;Snakefinger&quot; Lithman.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Duck Stab&quot; was included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. In 2018, Andy Gill of &quot;The Independent&quot; wrote that &quot;as nursery rhymes, [the songs on &quot;Duck Stab&quot;] blend the sinister with the simple; and as cartoons, they’re the musical equivalent of Tex Avery, constantly playing with their medium and breaking the frame.&quot;

== Track listing ==
All tracks written and composed by the Residents, except &quot;Sinister Exaggerator&quot; by the Residents and Snakefinger.

<text>Naomi Shemer (; July 13, 1930 – June 26, 2004) was a leading Israeli musician and songwriter, hailed as the &quot;first lady of Israeli song and poetry.&quot; Her song &quot;Yerushalayim Shel Zahav&quot; (&quot;Jerusalem of Gold&quot;), written in 1967, became an unofficial second anthem after Israel won the Six-Day War that year and reunited Jerusalem.

== Early life ==
Naomi Sapir () was born to Rivka and Meir Sapir (Sapirov), Lithuanian Jewish immigrants to Palestine, in Kvutzat Kinneret, a kibbutz in Mandatory Palestine that her parents helped to establish. In 1935, Shemer and her mother visited Vilnius, where they met Meir Sapov&#x27;s sister Berta and her family. Shemer&#x27;s European relatives were later killed during The Holocaust.

Encouraged by her mother, Naomi started playing the piano at the age of six.

After graduating from high school, Shemer postponed her mandatory military service, despite the opposition of some fellow kibbutz members, to study music. Shemer began her music studies at the Israeli Conservatory in Tel Aviv-Yafo before continuing at the Jerusalem Academy of Music and Dance. She studied under notable teachers, including Paul Ben-Haim, Frank Pelleg, Abel Ehrlich, Ilona Vincze-Kraus, and Josef Tal. 

After Shemer completed her music studies, she returned to Kvutzah Kinneret and worked as a children&#x27;s music teacher. Shemer created some of her earliest works during this period, such as &quot;The Mail Arrived Today&quot; and &quot;Our Little Brother&quot; (Yafa Yarkoni recorded them years later on her album &quot;Songs from the Sea of Galilee&quot; about her brother Yankale).

In 1951, after a deferment of about 4 years, she enlisted in the Israeli Defense Forces, where she served as a pianist in The Nahal Band. 

==Songwriting career==
After being released from the army, Shemer wrote songs for the theater. She collaborated with composer on the musical &quot;&quot;, for which she wrote lyrics under the pen name S. Carmel. Her well-known tunes from the musical include &quot;Tarnegol Ben-Gever&quot;, &quot;Rav Ha&#x27;Or VeHa&#x27;Tchelet&quot;, and &quot;Shir HaBar&quot;. Following that, she wrote tunes for &quot;Ha&#x27;Ikar VeBat Ha&#x27;Ikar&quot; (The Farmer and the Farmer&#x27;s Daughter) at the Ohel Theater.

Chaim Topol invited Shemer to write songs for the newly-formed band Batzal Yarok. Her first song for the group, &quot;Mishirei Zener Noded&quot; (better known as &quot;Haderech Aruka Hi Varba&quot;), written in 1957, achieved great success and is considered her first hit. Her autobiographical song &quot;&quot; was also included in the band&#x27;s first revue. For the show &quot;Daber El Hakir&quot;, staged at the Sambation Theater in 1958, she wrote and composed the song &quot;Halayla Holech Ba&#x27;Sderot&quot;, which was performed in the show by Shimon Israeli.

Shemer wrote several successful songs for Israeli military ensembles including &#x27;, and &quot;Hakol Biglal Masmer&quot; (based on For Want of a Nail). During the same period, she wrote the lyrics for the Dudaim songs &quot;Kibui Orot&quot; and &#x27; under the pen name &quot;Alifaz.&quot; Additionally, Shemer wrote &quot;&quot;, performed by the singer Loolik in a short film about Tel Aviv-Yafo.

In 1958, Shemer wrote &quot;Hopa Hey&quot; for an IDF program on Kol Israel. Two years later, the chorus won first prize in a competition in Italy. In 1960, she wrote &quot;Bessadeh Tiltan&quot; for the Northern Command Band, &quot;Leil Emesh&quot; performed by Shaike Levi, and &quot;Shir Hashuk&quot; for the play &quot;Aseret Hatzadikim&quot; which was recorded by HaTarnegolim in 1961. At the end of 1960, Shemer embarked on a nine-month tour in the United States. In 1962, she wrote &quot;Achrei Hashkiaa Basadeh&quot; for the Shiriyon Men&#x27;s Choir. Later, she collaborated with the Nahal Band on songs like &quot;&quot; (Tomorrow), &quot;Mitriyah Beshnayim&quot; (Umbrella for Two), and &quot; (Hide and Seek). 

In 1963, Shemer wrote &quot; (The Eucalyptus Grove) about Kvutzat Kinneret for the musical &quot;Keytzad Shovrim Chamsin&quot;. The same year, she composed the music for the song &quot;Kinneret&quot; (also known as &quot;Sham Harei Golan&quot;) written by Rachel Bluwstein, for the Central Command Band.

In 1964, Shemer wrote songs for the Yarkon Bridge Trio&#x27;s debut album &quot;First Love&quot;, including &quot;Ahavat Poalei Habinyan&quot;, &quot;Serenade Lah&quot;, &quot;Ayelet Ahavim&quot;, and &quot;Layla Bachof Achziv&quot;, which was also featured in the movie &quot;Dalia and the Sailors&quot;. That year, Shemer traveled to Paris with her daughter. There, she wrote songs reflecting prominent chansonnier influences, such as &quot;Ha&#x27;ir Be&#x27;afar&quot; for the Yarkon Bridge Trio, and wrote Hebrew lyrics for French songs such as &quot;Ilu Tziporim&quot; (originally by Jean-Pierre Calvet and Jean Broussolle), &quot;Shilgiya&quot; (originally by Guy Béart), and &quot;Ein Ahavot Smechot&quot; (originally by Georges Brassens). Several of these lyrical adaptations were recorded by Yossi Banai. 

After Shemer returned to Israel, the producer Asher Havaquin approached her in 1966 and suggested forming a female quartet. Shemer established The Shemer Sisters, consisting of Dina Golan, Dalia Oren, Amna Goldstein, and Ruthy Bikal. Batya Strauss served as the musical director. The quartet&#x27;s program included &quot;Begani&quot;, &quot;Zemer&quot;, and &quot;Shiro Shel Aba&quot;. Financial difficulties ultimately caused the quartet to disband.

=== &quot;Yerushalayim Shel Zahav&quot; ===
Shemer wrote one of her best-known songs, &quot;Yerushalayim Shel Zahav&quot; (&quot;Jerusalem of Gold&quot;), in 1967. The song gained immense popularity in Israel after the Six-Day War, with some suggesting it should replace the national anthem.

In May 2005, Haaretz reported that Shemer admitted in a letter to Gil Aldema that she plagiarized Paco Ibáñez&#x27;s cover of the Navarerrese folk song &quot;Pello Joxepe&quot; while composing the melody for &quot;Jerusalem of Gold&quot;. During her lifetime, Shemer denied allegations of plagiarism related to the melody of &quot;Yerushalayim Shel Zahav&quot;, referring to its similarity with &quot;Paco Ibáñez&quot; as an &quot;unfortunate accident.&quot; Shemer stated that the controversy caused her significant distress. Hebrew song researcher Eliyahu Hacohen did not view the resemblance as plagiarism but rather as an acceptable influence in the songwriting process. In 1962, Paco Ibáñez performed &quot;Pello Joxepe&quot; in Israel, when Shemer might have heard it.

Since the release of &quot;Yerushalayim Shel Zahav&quot;, Shemer has been regarded by many as Israel&#x27;s &quot;national songwriter,&quot; seen as embodying Israel&#x27;s spiritual values and sentiments through her music, though she may not have viewed herself in this way.
=== From the Six-Day War to Yom Kippur War ===
At the beginning of 1968, Shemer published her first book, &quot;All the Songs&quot;, featuring 42 of her works, 34 of which were published for the first time.

In March 1968, Shemer received an honorary degree from the Women&#x27;s Organization of Yeshiva University for &quot;Yerushalayim Shel Zahav&quot;, which she received at a festive dinner at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in Manhattan. Following the ceremony, she embarked on a concert tour that lasted several weeks, visiting major cities in the United States and Canada.

Between the Six-Day War and the Yom Kippur War, Shemer continued to write songs, including &quot;Shvachey Ma&#x27;oz&quot; (In Praise of Ma&#x27;oz), and &quot;Be&#x27;eretz Lahad&#x27;am&quot; (&quot;In the Land of Thing-That-Never-Happened&quot;).

The 1967 Nahal Band album, &quot;The Nahal Soldiers Are Coming&quot;, featured the first recording of Shemer&#x27;s song &quot;Valse LeHaganat HaTzomach&quot; (Waltz for the Defense of Vegetation), originally written for the Shemer Sisters. 

Following a 1968 visit to Nahal settlements in the Israeli-occupied Sinai Peninsula, Shemer wrote the song &quot;BeHe&#x27;achzut HaNahal BeSinai&quot; (In the Nahal Stronghold in Sinai) for the Nahal Band. The song was performed by Miri Aloni in the band&#x27;s program &quot;BeHichazut HaNahal BaSinai&quot;, which aired that year. In 1969, the Central Command Band recorded Shemer&#x27;s song &quot;Anachnu Shneynu Me&#x27;otu HaKfar&quot; (We Are Both from the Same Village), which she had written three years earlier. In the same year, she composed the song &quot;Pgisha Le&#x27;ein Ketz&quot; (Endless Meeting) for the band Shlosharim. 

For the program of the Israeli Navy Band&#x27;s 1971 program &quot;Shirat HaYam&quot; (Song of the Sea), Shemer composed the song &quot;Al Em HaDerech&quot; (On the Crossroad) for vocalist Chaya Ard. For Chava Alberstein&#x27;s 1971 program, Shemer wrote the song &quot;Shir Siyum&quot; (A Finalizing Song), based on a melody by Manos Hatzidakis. During Hanukkah of that year, Shemer returned to the Sinai Peninsula. Inspired by the visit, she wrote the song &quot;Shvahei Me’oz&quot; (Praise the Stronghold) for the Southern Command Band. The song&#x27;s opening was based on &quot;Ma&#x27;oz Tzur&quot;.

In 1972, the album &quot;Chavurat Bimot&quot; was released, featuring songs by Shemer such as &quot;Mar Narkis&quot; (Mr. Narcissus), &quot;Shir Eres LeMikreim Meyuchadim&quot; (A Bedtime Song for Special Cases, a lullaby for the children of divorced parents), &quot;Anashim Yafim&quot; (Beautiful People, a track about high society), and &quot;HaMakshefot&quot; (The Witches, about sensationalist journalism), &quot;Lashir Zeh Kmo Lihiyot Yarden&quot; (To Sing This is Like Being in the Jordan, performed by Miri Aloni), &quot;Be&#x27;eretz Lahad&#x27;am &quot;(In the Land of Thing-That-Never-Happened, also performed by Aloni), &quot;Arba&#x27;im&quot;, and &quot;Ani Megadelat Ba&#x27;al&quot;. Shemer refrained from including the latter two in her numerous collections over the years. 

In the artistic section of the 1972 Melody and Song Festival, HaGashash HaHiver performed Shemer&#x27;s song &quot;Yesh Li Chag&quot; (I Have a Holiday). Another Shemer song published in 1972 was a translation of Jacques Brel&#x27;s song &quot;L&#x27;amour Est Mort&quot; (Love is Dead), performed by Yossi Banai.

Shemer continued to adapt popular songs into Hebrew, including &quot;Lu Yehi&quot;, an adaptation of the Beatles song &quot;Let It Be&quot;, which was written shortly before the Yom Kippur War in 1973 and came to symbolize the conflict. Shemer initially wrote new lyrics to accompany the original Lennon-McCartney music, but was encouraged by her husband Mordechai Horowitz, who had fought in the war, to rewrite it with a &quot;Jewish&quot; melody. Shemer rewrote the melody and it became widely recorded, including by HaGashash HaHiver and Chava Alberstein, who featured it as the title track on one of her albums.

=== 1973–1991 ===
Thought the 1970s, Shemer continued to compose songs for a variety of artists including Nathan Alterman (&quot;Pgisha Le&#x27;ein Ketz&quot;, &quot;Sapanei Shalom HaMelech&quot;, &quot;Al Em HaDerech&quot;, &quot;HaEm HaShlishit&quot;), Shaul Tchernichovsky (&quot;Ba&#x27;aliyati Sham Yafati&quot;, &quot;Omrim Yeshna Eretz&quot;), Hayim Nahman Bialik (&quot;Kumi Tzei&quot;) and Avraham Shlonsky (&quot;Betchul HaShamayim&quot;). She translated songs by Itzik Manger (including &quot;Al HaDerech Etz Omed&quot;) and continued writing songs based texts from various sources (for example &quot;Shirat Ha&#x27;Asavim&quot; was inspired by Nachman of Breslov and &quot;Akedat Yitzhak&quot; by the Book of Genesis).

For Yehoram Gaon&#x27;s 1973 album &quot;Ahava Yam Tikhonit&quot; (Mediterranean Love), Shemer composed the song &quot;Kumi Tzei&quot;, originally written by Hayim Nahman Bialik.

In 1974, Shemer released an album of children&#x27;s songs, which included several hits including &quot;Aleph Bet&quot; and &quot;Shlomit Bonah Sukkah&quot;, originally performed by Ilana Rovina and Dudaim three years earlier. Most of the record&#x27;s songs were first performed in a children&#x27;s show presented by Shemer and Oded Teomi. Also in 1974, Yossi Banai recorded Shemer&#x27;s song &quot;Sfirat Mlai &quot; (Cargo Counting) for his solo show &quot;Partzuf Shel Tzo&#x27;ani&quot; (Face of a Gypsy).

In 1976, Shemer wrote the songs for a musical adaptation of The Travels of Benjamin III. Several of the songs gained widespread popularity, including &quot;Perot Chamisha Asar&quot;, &quot;Siman She&#x27;od Lo Heganu&quot;, and &quot;Shirat Ha&#x27;asavim&quot; (The Song of the Grass). For the &quot;Hebrew Melody Celebration&quot; held that year, Shemer wrote the song &quot;HaChagiga Nigmeret&quot; (The Celebration Ends), performed by Hakol Over Habibi. Additionally, in the same year, she wrote the song &quot;Bekol Shana Be&#x27;Setav Giora&quot;, performed by Ruhama Raz, in memory of Yom Kippur War victim Giora Shoham. 

In 1976, Yehoram Gaon recorded Shemer&#x27;s song &quot;Od Lo Ahavti Dai&quot; (I Haven&#x27;t Loved Enough Yet) which became a major hit. The song was initially written for a television program featuring Shemer&#x27;s music and was released as the title track of Gaon&#x27;s album. In a newspaper interview, Shemer revealed that she wrote the song while ill, fearing she might not recover. In a moment of defiance, she remarked, &quot;There are still many things I want to do.&quot;

For a 1976 radio program featuring the songs of Shaul Tchernichovsky, Shemer composed the music for Tchernichovsky&#x27;s poem &quot;Hoy Artzi Moladeti&quot; (Oh My County, My Homeland), which was performed on the program by Shokolad, Menta, Mastik. 

Between 1977 and 1979, Shemer published a personal column in Davar titled &quot;Shavshevet&quot; (שבשבת).

In 1978, she wrote the song &quot;Chevlei Mashiach&quot;, which she performed herself on a Yom Ha&#x27;atzmaut television special.

In 1979, Nurit Galron recorded the song &quot;Atzuv Lamut Be&#x27;emtza Hatamuz&quot;, written by Shemer. The song was later included in her album &quot;Symphatia&quot;, released three years later. Also year, she composed the music for the Avraham Heffner film &quot;Parashat Winshel&quot;. 

For a television program dedicated to Rivka Michaeli in 1980, Shemer wrote the song &quot;Ein Li Rega Dal&quot; which became one of Michaeli&#x27;s most well-known songs. That year she also wrote the song &quot;&quot; and composed the song &quot;Asif&quot; with lyrics by Itamar Prat for the band Batzal Yarok 80.

In 1981, Shemer released a successful album entitled &quot;Al Hadvash Ve&#x27;al Ha&#x27;Okez&quot; (On the Honey and the Sting). The album was named for the opening lyric of &quot;Al Kol Eleh&quot;. The album also included the songs &quot;Anashim Tovim&quot; (Good People) and the Shaul Tchernichovsky track &quot;Omrim Yeshna Eretz&quot;, which she composed for the television program &quot;Yemei Kislev&quot; that same year. In the same year, for the television film &quot;El Borot HaMayim&quot;, she wrote and recorded a song of the same name.

In 1983, Shemer won the Jabotinsky Medal and the Israel Prize. The judging committee for the Israeli Prize stated: &quot;The Israel Prize for Music of Israel is awarded to Naomi Shemer for her songs, which naturally find their way into the hearts of all, due to their poetic and musical quality, the wonderful integration between lyrics and melody, and the expression they give to the whispers of the people&#x27;s hearts.&quot; In addition, she was awarded an honorary degree from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and the Weizmann Institute of Science as well as an honorary citizenship of Tel Aviv-Yafo.

Shemer wrote the title track for Yehoram Gaon&#x27;s 1982 album &quot;Simanei Derekh&quot;. In 1984, she penned the song &quot;Lo Tenatzchu Oti&quot; for his album &quot;Emtza Haderakh&quot;. Also in 1984, she wrote the song &quot;Ha’Ore’ach&quot; (The Guest) for Hakol Over Chavivi.

From the 1970s onward, as Shemer became more outspokenly right-wing, her songs increasingly featured Jewish and traditional themes. While these themes appeared in earlier works such as &quot;Shiro Shel Aba&quot; and &quot;Lo Amut Ki Ehyeh&quot;, they became more prominent in songs like &quot;Shirat Ha’asavim&quot; and &quot;El Borot HaMayim&quot;.

By the mid-1980s, Shemer was increasingly viewed by the Israeli public as right-wing, which led some people to hold a negative public image of her, with various public figures and artists sharply criticizing her.

In 1985, Ofra Haza&#x27;s album &quot;Adamah&quot; was released. Although the original plan was for Haza and Shemer to collaborate on several songs, the album ultimately featured only one song by Shemer, &quot;Hithadshut&quot;. The same year, Shemer wrote the song &quot;Tilbeshi Lavan&quot; for a joint album by the Dudaim and the Parvarim.

For Yehoram Gaon&#x27;s 1986 album &quot;Elef Neshikot&quot;, Shemer wrote and composed two songs, &quot;Dyokan Imi&quot; and &quot;Kmo Chatzav&quot;. In the same year, her song &quot;Kad HaKemach&quot; was performed by the Northern Command Band.

Starting in the mid-1980s, Shemer&#x27;s commercial success began to decline. In 1987, Shemer wrote all the songs for Moshe Beker&#x27;s album &quot;Hafatzim Ishiim&quot;. While some tracks, like &quot;Guy&quot; and &quot;Tut&quot;, received considerable radio play, the album&#x27;s sales were disappointing. Shemer attributed the album&#x27;s lack of success to her association with the right-wing politics.

In 1988, Shemer wrote the song &quot;Or&quot; for Shoshana Damari. Featured on Damari&#x27;s album of the same name, the song was a huge success, helping to bring Damari back into the spotlight and becoming a popular dance hit.

=== Final years ===
In 1991, after rumors circulated that Shemer was seriously ill, a tribute event titled &quot;Encore to Naomi Shemer&quot; was broadcast on Israel&#x27;s Channel 1, produced by Dalia Gutman. The evening featured performances by numerous artists, including Chava Alberstein, Nurit Galron, Yehudit Ravitz, and Moti Kirschenbaum. One of the standout moments was the performance of &quot;Serenada Lach&quot; by Gidi Gov, Moni Moshonov, and Shlomo Baraba, arranged by Yoni Rechter. It was later revealed that Shemer&#x27;s illness was not as severe as initially thought, and fears about her death were unfounded.

In her final years, Shemer&#x27;s commercial successes were infrequent and sporadic. One exception was the song &quot;Hakol Patuah&quot;, written in celebration of the Sea of Galilee. In 1993, Shemer appeared alongside Mickey Kam, Moshe Beker, Chaim Tzinoivitz, and Rina Givon in the children&#x27;s video cassette &quot;Etzelnu BaPsanter&quot;, which was based on her songs. In the video, Shemer performed &quot;Hakol Patuah&quot; with the other participants. A year later, a recorded of the song by Leah Lupatin and Ofer Levi, becoming a hit. Shemer later expressed regret that the recording was done without her knowledge.

In October 1993, for a tribute program on Channel 1 honoring singer Beni Amdursky, Shemer wrote the song &quot;Ani Guitara&quot;. The program was filmed while Amdursky was dying of cancer. After he completed his rendition of the song, Amdursky thanked Shemer for the song, and she struggled to hide her deep emotional reaction.

In 1995, following the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin, Shemer translated Walt Whitman’s poem O Captain! My Captain!—written in memory of Abraham Lincoln after his assassination 130 years earlier—into the Hebrew and composed music for it. Shemer&#x27;s adaptation was performed for the first time by singer Meytal Trabelsi during a commemoration of Rabin&#x27;s assassination.

A tribute evening in Shemer&#x27;s honor was held at the 1998 Israel Festival, directed by Adi Renart and featuring the participation of numerous artists.

From 2000 until her death, Shemer performed in a show of her songs titled &quot;Elef Shirim veShir&quot;, with arrangements, accompaniment, and musical direction by Rami Harel. She co-directed the show with producer and presenter Dudu Elharar, and it featured the singing and playing of Ronit Roland. For the production, Shemer wrote the songs &quot;HaMe’il&quot;, &quot;Plugat Yasmin&quot;, &quot;HaMenagen&quot;, and &quot;Aktualia&quot;.

== Death and legacy ==

Shemer struggled with ill health throughout her life, including being diagnosed with diabetes in the 1970s. She died of cancer on June 26, 2004, the 9th of the Jewish month of Tammuz. Years before her death, Shemer wrote the song &quot;Sad to Die in the Middle of Tammuz&quot; before undergoing necessary surgery.

Shemer was buried in Kinneret Cemetery alongside her parents. At Shemer&#x27;s request, Dudu Elharar sang four songs written by her at her funeral: &quot;Kinneret&quot; (&quot;Sham Harei Golan&quot; by Rachel Bluwstein), &quot;Hurshat HaEcalyptus&quot;, &quot;Lashir Zeh Kmo Lihiyot Yarden&quot;, and &quot;Noa&quot;.

Shortly before her death, Shemer informed producer Dorit Reuveni that she had written a new song titled &quot;Ilan&quot;, in memory of Ilan Ramon. Reuveni met with Shemer and recorded her playing the song. It was first performed during a tribute show for Shemer, held in Yarkon Park thirty days after her death.

After Shemer&#x27;s death, several previously unreleased songs were made public. Ariel Zilber recorded &quot;Hakarish&quot; for his album &quot;Anabel&quot;. Ruhama Raz and the band Parvarim made recordings of &quot;Arvei Nahal&quot;, an English folk song that Shemer had translated. In 2020, Shemer&#x27;s song &quot;Farewell&quot; was composed for the first time by Rami Kleinstein and released as a duet performed by Kleinstein and Tal Sondak as part of Sondak&#x27;s album &quot;Shiratam&quot;.
Streets have been named after Shemer in several cities, including Kiryat Motzkin, Herzliya, Holon, Giv&#x27;at Shmuel, Be&#x27;er Ya&#x27;akov, Kiryat Bialik, Kfar Saba, and Be&#x27;er Sheva, as well as elementary schools. 

In 2005, the Israel Government Coins and Medals Corporation issued silver and gold coins with her likeness.

In 2010, Shemer&#x27;s family handed over her archive and artistic legacy to the National Library of Israel, which committed to making it accessible.

In 2011, a 650 m-long tunnel in Jerusalem from Mount Scopus to the Jordan Valley was renamed to honor her as &quot;Naomi Shemer Tunnel&quot;.

In 2012, Yahaly Gat’s film &quot;The Wind, the Darkness, the Water&quot; aired on Channel 1. The film explores Shemer’s works and their impact on Israeli society and culture.
In 2017, the musical &quot;Simanei Derekh&quot; (Signs of the Way) by Oren Yakobi and Giora Yahalom was staged at the Habima Theatre. The production tells the story of Shemer&#x27;s life.

In 2021, the &quot;Naomi Shemer Trail&quot; was inaugurated in Ramat Gan National Park, with musical stations and explanations about the songs.

In June 2021, the production of the new song &quot;Hagvira Mul HaAgam&quot; (The Lady by the Lake), written by Yair Lapid, was completed. The song, inspired by Shemer&#x27;s life, was created to celebrate her 90th birthday. Composed by Kobi Oshrat, it was performed by Miki Gavrielov and Yigal Bashan.

In June 2022, the cast of Zehu Ze! recorded &quot;Naomi, Ela Mi&quot;, a song dedicated to Shemer, written and composed by Kobi Luria, in commemoration of the 18th anniversary of her passing.

==Personal life==
In 1953, Shemer (then known as Naomi Sapir) met actor Gideon Shemer at a Kibbutz Movement event in Netzer Sereni. They married in 1954 and had a daughter, Lali. The Shemers separated in 1962 and divorced in 1968. In 1969, she married Mordechai Horowitz, a lawyer. Their son is musician Ariel Horowitz.
Shemer was buried at the cemetery in Kvutzat Kinneret, alongside several Labor Zionist settlers from the second and third aliyot. In accordance with her wishes, Shemer was buried near Rachel Bluwstein.

== Political views ==
Shemer was associated with right-wing and pro-Israeli settlement politics, especially after her marriage to Mordechai Horowitz, who had similar beliefs.

Some critics argue that &quot;Jerusalem of Gold&quot; erases the presence of the Palestinians who lived in East Jerusalem at the time it was written. Shemer responded to this over the years: &quot;A world that is devoid of Jews, for me, is like a dead star, and the Land of Israel, which is empty of Jews, is for me desolate and empty&quot;.

In the mid-1970s, Shemer expressed solidarity with the Gush Emunim movement. She wrote &quot;A Strange Man&quot;, which she read at a Gush Emunim assembly to Sebastia, and &quot;Paranoid&quot;, expressing support for the organization&#x27;s members. Shemer&#x27;s 1975 song &quot;The Shark&quot; criticized the Sinai Interim Agreement. These songs ignited public debate and received little radio airplay amidst criticism.

In July 1976, Shemer published a response to her critics claiming she was not affiliated with any political party or movement advocating for a Greater Israel. She emphasized her belief in &quot;the justice of Zionism&quot;.

During Israel&#x27;s withdrawal from the Sinai Peninsula, Shemer expressed support for the Israeli settlers in Yamit. Her song &quot;Al Kol Eleh&quot;, which includes the line &#x27;Al na ta&#x27;akor netu&#x27;a&#x27; (Please do not uproot the planted), became a symbol of the opposition to the withdrawal, although Shemer claimed it was originally written as a personal message of comfort for her sister, Ruth Novasbaum, after the death of her husband. Some claim that the lesser-known verses of the song make it evideng that the song was intended to be against the withdrawal from Sinai. After the evacuation of Yamit, realizing she could no longer have an impact, Shemer refrained from further involvement in public affairs.

==Awards==
In 1983, Shemer received the Israel Prize for Hebrew song (words and melody).

<doc id="757659" wikidata="Q2756369" url="?curid=757659" title="Eskimo (album)">
<text>Eskimo is the sixth studio album by American art rock group the Residents. The album was originally supposed to follow 1977&#x27;s &quot;Fingerprince&quot;; however, due to many delays and arguments with management, it was not released until 1979.

The pieces on &quot;Eskimo&quot; feature home-made instruments and chanting against backdrops of wind-like synthesizer noise and miscellaneous sound effects. The work is programmatic, each piece pairing music with text detailing a corresponding pseudo-ethnographic narrative. While &quot;Eskimo&quot; is officially maintained to be a true historical document of life in the Arctic, the stories are deliberately absurd fictions only loosely based in actual Inuit culture, and the chanting is a combination of gibberish and commercial slogans. The album satirizes ignorance toward and mistreatment of the indigenous peoples of the Americas.

==Diskomo ==

A companion piece, &quot;Diskomo&quot;, was released in 1980 as a 12-inch single, featuring a remix of the songs backed by a disco beat. In 1988, &quot;Diskomo&quot; was covered by Belgian new beat group L&amp;O, and retitled &quot;Even Now&quot;. &quot;Diskomo 2000&quot;, a follow-up EP featuring the original remix, its B-side (&quot;Goosebump&quot;, a collection of children&#x27;s songs played on toy musical instruments), and several other versions, was released in 2000. The EP&#x27;s title track, &quot;Diskomo 2000&quot; redoes &quot;Diskomo&quot; in the style of &quot;Even Now&quot;.

==Critical reception==

The &quot;Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel&quot; wrote that &quot;&quot;Eskimo&quot; is truly a new branch on the rock and roll family tree, truly original music, a new sound.&quot; &quot;Spin&quot; called it &quot;an album-length threnody for wind machine and invented language&quot;.

&quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; deemed &quot;Eskimo&quot; &quot;a dreary and dank concept album.&quot; The &quot;Spin Alternative Record Guide&quot; called it &quot;creepy and funny&quot; and &quot;the Residents&#x27; zenith.&quot;

==Track listing==

<text>List of Irish Victoria Cross recipients lists all recipients of the Victoria Cross (post-nominal letters &quot;VC&quot;) born on the island of Ireland, together with the date and place of their VC action. The Victoria Cross is the highest war honour of the British Empire and the Commonwealth of Nations. The whole island of Ireland was part of the United Kingdom until 1922 when it was partitioned into Northern Ireland and the Irish Free State. On 18 April 1949, the Dominion of Ireland became the Republic of Ireland and left the Commonwealth as a result of the Republic of Ireland Act 1948 coming into effect. Despite this, citizens of the Republic of Ireland still enlist in the British Army and thus are eligible for the Victoria Cross and other British honours.

==Background==

Established in 1856, the Victoria Cross has been awarded to service personnel for extraordinary valour and devotion to duty while facing a hostile force. Between 1858 and 1881 the Victoria Cross could also be awarded for actions taken &quot;under circumstances of extreme danger&quot; not in the face of the enemy. Six people (four Irish, one English and one Canadian) were awarded Victoria Crosses under this clause (one in 1866 during the Fenian raids, five for a single incident in 1867 during the Andaman Islands Expedition), until it was amended in 1881 to only allow acts &quot;in the presence of the enemy&quot;. It was awarded to members of the British Armed Forces which included Irish service personnel until 1922. It is currently available to personnel of any rank in any service, and to allies serving under or with British Forces. It is the highest honour in the Commonwealth honours system, placed before all other orders, decorations and medals.

Both Catholic and Protestant officers and servicemen born in Ireland served alongside each other in the British Military. During the previous two centuries they had a common military background, and irrespective of class or creed many were decorated with the British highest award for valour. 30 Irish VCs were awarded in the Crimean War, 59 Irish VCs in the Indian Mutiny, 46 Irish VCs in numerous other British Empire campaigns between 1857 and 1914, 37 Irish VCs in World War I, and eight Irish VCs in World War II.

<doc id="757670" wikidata="Q6592150" url="?curid=757670" title="List of New Zealand Victoria Cross recipients">
<text>The Victoria Cross is a military decoration awarded for valour of the British and Commonwealth forces. The highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy, it was first instituted by Queen Victoria in 1856 after the Crimean War. Officially there have been 22 Imperial Victoria Crosses awarded to New Zealand military personnel. These awards were bestowed upon 21 individuals, with Charles Upham receiving the award on two occasions.

==Background==
Established in 1856, the Victoria Cross has been awarded to service personnel for extraordinary valour and devotion to duty while facing a hostile force. Between 1858 and 1881 the Victoria Cross could also be awarded for actions taken &quot;under circumstances of extreme danger&quot; not in the face of the enemy. Six people (four Irish, one English and one Canadian) were awarded Victoria Crosses under this clause (one in 1866 during the Fenian raids, five for a single incident in 1867 during the Andaman Islands Expedition), until it was amended in 1881 to only allow acts &quot;in the presence of the enemy&quot;.

In 1999 the Victoria Cross for New Zealand was created as a separate version of the award solely for New Zealand personnel. To date, there has been one recipient of that award – Willie Apiata for actions in Afghanistan in 2004 – although recipients of the Victoria Cross for New Zealand are not included on this list.

==Summary==
The first award to a New Zealander came in 1864 when Charles Heaphy received a Victoria Cross for his actions during the Invasion of Waikato during the New Zealand Wars. Since then there has been one award to a New Zealander serving during the Second Boer War, 11 during World War I, and nine in World War II. There were no awards to New Zealanders for service during the Korean War or the Vietnam War.

In addition to the 22 awards to New Zealand military personnel, there have been seven other awards to New Zealanders serving in overseas forces, which are not included in the official count. Of these, the majority served with the Australian forces during the First World War, including: Alfred Shout, Percy Storkey, Lawrence Weathers, and Thomas Cooke, all of whom are listed as Australian recipients. New Zealand&#x27;s most famous soldier, Bernard Freyberg is sometimes listed as a New Zealand recipient, although he was serving in the British Army when he performed the deeds that led to his award in 1916, and is not included in the official count. William Barnard Rhodes-Moorhouse received the award posthumously for service with the Royal Flying Corps in 1915, while William Edward Sanders, commanding HMS &quot;Prize&quot;, received the award for actions at sea in 1917 while serving in the Royal Navy Reserve. An eighth, Cecil D&#x27;Arcy (born in Wanganui), who served during the Anglo-Zulu War in 1879, is variously listed as a New Zealand or South African recipient, but is not officially included on the list of New Zealanders who received the award in overseas forces.

<text>is a Shinto shrine in the city of Yawata in Kyoto Prefecture, Japan.

==History==
The shrine&#x27;s Heian period connections with the Kyoto and the Imperial family date from its founding in 859 (&quot;Jōgan 1&quot;) when construction on its earliest structures commenced. Shrine tradition explains that Emperor Seiwa ordered the shrine to be built in obeisance to an oracle in which the god Hachiman expressed the desire to be near to Kyoto to watch over the city and the Imperial House of Japan. This vision was reported by a Buddhist monk, Gyōkyō, who had a second vision which led to selecting the Otokoyama location where the shrine now stands. Like other Hachiman shrines, until 1868 Iwashimizu was actually a shrine-temple complex (&quot;jingū-ji&quot;) called dedicated to Buddhism as much as to &quot;kami&quot; worship.

The shrine became the object of Imperial patronage during the early Heian period. In 965, Emperor Murakami ordered that Imperial messengers were sent to report important events to the guardian &quot;kami&quot; of Japan. These &quot;heihaku&quot; were initially presented to 16 shrines including the Ōharano Shrine.

The shrine&#x27;s importance and influence grew in succeeding centuries; and its extensive landholdings led to modest conflicts with Minamoto no Yoritomo during the years in which the Kamakura shogunate was establishing itself. The shrine sought to maintain its traditional exemption from contributing to paying the costs of military forces. In time, the bakufu faded away; and the shrine endured.

&quot;Iwashimizu Hachimangū&quot; and &quot;Ise Shrine&quot; were specified for in the Middle Ages.

* 1456 (&quot;Kōshō 2, 3rd month&quot;): Ashikaga Yoshimasa visited Iwashimizu Shrine; and all the officials of the &quot;Daijō-kan&quot; joined him in going there.

From 1871 through 1946, Iwashimizu Hachimangū was officially designated one of the , meaning that it stood in the first rank of government supported shrines. Other similarly honored Hachiman shrines were Usa Shrine of Usa in Ōita Prefecture and Hakozaki-gū of Fukuoka in Fukuoka Prefecture.

===Imperial progresses to the shrine===
In 979 (&quot;Tengen 2&quot;), Emperor Enyū visited the shrine; and the shrine continued to be visited by nearly all the emperors until the reign of Emperor Go-Daigo, when the sovereigns began to live more secluded lives.

In the &quot;Shōhei&quot; era (1346–1370), Emperor Murakami visited Iwashimizu in person.

After the Ōnin war (1467–1477), Imperial visits were held in abeyance for 200 years.

==Shinto belief==
The shrine is dedicated to the veneration of Hachiman, the Shinto &quot;kami&quot; or spirit guardian of Imperial legitimacy. Since the time of its founding in 859, Hachiman has been recognized as Emperor Ojin.

==Treasures==
A 2005 survey of the treasures at Iwashimizu revealed, among other things, the existence of a &quot;kris&quot;, a jeweled Indonesian dagger, which was exhibited at Kyoto National Museum as part of an exhibit entitled &quot;Famous Swords from Kyoto&#x27;s Temples and Shrines.&quot;

<text>The number 2147483647 is the eighth Mersenne prime, equal to 231 − 1. It is one of only four known double Mersenne primes.

The primality of this number was proven by Leonhard Euler, who reported the proof in a letter to Daniel Bernoulli written in 1772. Euler used trial division, improving on Pietro Cataldi&#x27;s method, so that at most 372 divisions were needed. It thus improved upon the previous record-holding prime, 6,700,417, also discovered by Euler, forty years earlier. The number 2,147,483,647 remained the largest known prime until 1867.

In computing, this number is the largest value that a signed 32-bit integer field can hold.

==Barlow&#x27;s prediction==
At the time of its discovery, 2,147,483,647 was the largest known prime number. In 1811, Peter Barlow, not anticipating future interest in perfect numbers, wrote (in &quot;An Elementary Investigation of the Theory of Numbers&quot;):

Euler ascertained that 231 − 1 = 2147483647 is a prime number; and this is the greatest at present known to be such, and, consequently, the last of the above perfect numbers [i.e., 230(231 − 1)], which depends upon this, is the greatest perfect number known at present, and probably the greatest that ever will be discovered; for as they are merely curious, without being useful, it is not likely that any person will attempt to find one beyond it.

He repeated this prediction in his work from 1814, &quot;A New Mathematical and Philosophical Dictionary&quot;.

In fact, a larger prime was discovered in 1855 by Thomas Clausen (67,280,421,310,721), though a proof was not provided. Furthermore, 3,203,431,780,337 was proven to be prime in 1867.

==In computing==
The number 2,147,483,647 (or hexadecimal 7FFFFFFF16) is the maximum positive value for a 32-bit signed binary integer in computing. It is therefore the maximum value for variables declared as integers (e.g., as codice_1) in many programming languages.

The data type time_t, used on operating systems such as Unix, is a signed integer counting the number of seconds since the start of the Unix epoch (midnight UTC of 1 January 1970), and is often implemented as a 32-bit integer. The latest time that can be represented in this form is 03:14:07 UTC on Tuesday, 19 January 2038 (corresponding to 2,147,483,647 seconds since the start of the epoch). This means that systems using a 32-bit codice_2 type are susceptible to the Year 2038 problem.

On 1 January 2022, a bug was reported for Microsoft Exchange systems where email delivery would fail. An internal malware scanner (enabled by default since 2013) used the date and time as a signed 32-bit integer. The integer would change during the new year to 2,201,010,001 (with the first two digits representing the year), surpassing the maximum value for this data type.

=== In video games ===
The number 2,147,483,647 often becomes a hard limit for various statistics in video games, such as points or money, if they are represented by signed 32-bit integers (rather than floating-point, double-precision or arbitrary-precision). Going over this limit by legitimate means, or by modding or hacking the game, results in many different outcomes caused by integer overflow. The most common outcome is the number &quot;wrapping&quot; into the negatives. Another potential outcome is &quot;game crashing&quot;, thus meaning there was no failsafe implemented in the event the value exceeds the signed 32-bit limit—generally if the underlying engine has undefined behavior, instead of a wraparound behavior, for integer overflow. A well-known example in video games is that of &quot;Old School RuneScape and Grand Theft Auto V,&quot; where the number is used as the maximum amount of coins (or any other item) that a player can hold at once with normal methods, known as a &quot;max cash stack&quot;. In similar cases, where an unsigned instead of signed 32-bit integer is used, the limit might be extended to 4,294,967,295.

<doc id="757690" wikidata="Q3294298" url="?curid=757690" title="Mark of the Mole">
<text>Mark of the Mole is the eighth studio album by American art rock group The Residents, released in 1981 on Ralph Records. The first in what was intended to be a &quot;trilogy&quot; (of six albums) with a narrative centred on a conflict between two rival peoples, the Moles and the Chubs.

== Concept ==
&quot;Mark of the Mole&quot; introduces the Moles (a subterranean society whose gods offer salvation through hard labor) who are forced to abandon their tunnels due to flooding at the start of the album. The Moles enter the land of the Chubs (a vapid, hedonistic culture which resides under the sea), seeking work and a new home.

Initially, the Moles are welcomed with open arms because the Chubs despise hard labor. Conflict arises when a Chub scientist invents a machine that can do the work instead, making the Moles obsolete and sparking a brief war. The short instrumental track &quot;Resolution?&quot; ends the album without giving a clear conclusion to the narrative; the liner notes to the album &quot;The Big Bubble&quot; (billed as &quot;Part Four of the Mole Trilogy&quot;) states that the war ended with no clear winner, and the two ethnic groups live together in uneasy peace into the next generation.

== History ==
&quot;Mark of the Mole&quot; and its follow-up album, &quot;The Tunes of Two Cities&quot;, became the basis for The Residents&#x27; first international touring production, The Mole Show. Penn Jillette, who appeared as MC of the Mole Show, has an uncredited appearance as a weatherman on &quot;Voices of the Air.&quot;

An Atari 2600 game based on the album was being developed by Greg Easter in 1983, but it was later cancelled.

== Track listing ==

=== 1988 CD bonus tracks ===
Tracks 7–11 are taken from the 1982 EP &quot;,&quot; which collected the intermission music that was played from tape between acts of the Mole Show.
=== 2019 pREServed edition (&quot;Mole Box&quot;) ===
A deluxe box set pertaining to the entire Mole Trilogy concept was released in 2019. It contained newly remastered editions of &quot;Mark of the Mole&quot;, &quot;The Tunes of Two Cities&quot; and &quot;The Big Bubble&quot;, as well as recordings of the Mole Show and a sixth disc of miscellaneous recordings related to the project. Discs One and Six are shown here for their relevance.

<text>Crown Castle Inc. is a real estate investment trust and provider of shared communications infrastructure in the United States headquartered in Houston, Texas. Operating with 100 offices worldwide, its network includes over 40,000 cell towers and approximately 85,000 route miles of fiber supporting small cells and fiber systems.

==History==

=== Crown Communications (1980-1997) and Castle Tower (1994-1997) ===
Crown Communications was founded in 1980 by Robert and Barbara Crown, natives of the Pittsburgh suburb of Green Tree. Crown Communications built, sited, owned and maintained cell towers across the United States; within Pittsburgh and its surrounding region, the company had a near monopoly on cell towers.

Castle Tower was founded in 1994, starting with 133 Houston-area towers, and initially backed by two private investment firms. Among its first operational purchases was the transmission sites of the BBC, where Castle and French communications firm TDF Group outbid NTL Incorporated.

In 1997, Crown Communications merged with Houston&#x27;s Castle Tower Corporation to form Crown Castle International. The terms of the merger stipulated that Castle would buy out Crown Communications, though the name of the company would be changed to Crown Castle and that the company would continue to operate with a strong presence in the Pittsburgh area. The merger of the two firms, completed in January 1998, more than doubled the assets of the now-merged Crown Castle.

=== Crown Castle International (1997-2015) ===
On August 31, 2004, Crown Castle completed the sale of its UK subsidiary, Crown Castle UK, to National Grid Transco plc for over $2 billion. National Grid Transco plc was renamed to National Grid plc in July 2005, while Crown Castle UK was renamed National Grid Wireless in October 2005.

On January 12, 2007, Crown Castle completed the acquisition of Global Signal Inc., another U.S. tower operator which was based in Sarasota, Florida.

On December 11, 2011, Crown Castle announced an agreement to purchase NextG Networks, Inc. for nearly $1 billion. NextG had over 7,000 distributed antenna system nodes on-air at the time of the agreement with another 1,500 nodes under construction as well as rights to more than 4,600 miles of fiber optic cables.

On September 28, 2012, Crown Castle entered a tower leasing agreement with T-Mobile US. The deal leases 7,200 wireless towers to the company for a term of 28 years in exchange for $2.4 billion. After the deal ends in 2040, Crown Castle will have an opportunity to purchase the towers for an additional $2.4 billion. Similarly, on October 20, 2013, Crown Castle entered a tower leasing agreement with AT&amp;T Mobility. The deal leases 9,700 wireless towers to the company for a term of 28 years in exchange for $4.85 billion. Crown Castle also gained the right to acquire the towers outright in the future for $4.2 billion. 600 towers will be acquired outright by Crown Castle in the future. AT&amp;T will pay $1,900 a month per site to access the towers with rent rising approximately 2% per year.

In 2015, Crown Castle expanded into small cell technology in order to boost the capability and widen the scope of its network. The acquisition of Quanta Fiber Networks (Sunesys) in 2015 gave the company access to over 10,000 miles of fiber in various metro areas like Los Angeles, Chicago, Silicon Valley and Atlanta. Prior to that, in 2014, the company acquired the 24/7 Mid-Atlantic Network with over 800 miles of fiber along the East Coast of U.S.

=== Domestic-exclusive firm (2015-present) ===
Crown Castle International sold off its Australian assets in 2015, removing its international focus and making the company exclusively operational in the United States. The company sold its last towers to Macquarie Group for $1.6 billion, which after taxes and fees gave a net gain of $1.3 billion to the company. The sale was motivated to boost an expansion to its domestic operations.

On July 19, 2017, Crown Castle signed an agreement to acquire Lightower, a fiber network operator in the northeast U.S., for approximately $7.1 billion. The transaction increased Crown Castle&#x27;s fiber network to approximately 60,000 route miles. The buyout had a significant impact on second-quarter earnings reported in late July. Revenue increased by 3.3% and small cells increased sales by 42%. Crown Castle also announced a $3.25 billion common stock offering as well as a $1.5 billion sale of convertible preferred shares to help finance the Lightower purchase.

Based on its 2019 revenue, in 2020 Crown Castle joined the &quot;Fortune&quot; 500 list for the first time, at number 496.

<doc id="757704" wikidata="Q3523109" url="?curid=757704" title="The Tunes of Two Cities">
<text>The Tunes of Two Cities is the ninth studio album by American art rock group The Residents, released in 1982. It is part two of the &quot;Mole Trilogy&quot;. Rather than forwarding the story of the battle between the Mole People and the Chubs, the record&#x27;s concept is to display the differences between the two cultures through their music. The music of the Chubs is light cocktail jazz, while that of the Moles tends toward industrial hymns. A major feature of this album is that it was one of the first to use the E-mu Emulator, one of the earliest commercial digital samplers.

The Chub track &quot;Mousetrap&quot; bears a noticeable resemblance to Stan Kenton&#x27;s &quot;Eager Beaver.&quot; In one 1998 interview, band spokesman Homer Flynn acknowledged that the band listened to jazz and big band artists including Kenton, as well as Charles Mingus and Sun Ra.

==Track listing==


The 1988 CD release contains three extra tracks that were excluded from the album due to space constraints. These tracks are sequenced between &quot;Praise for the Curse&quot; and &quot;The Secret Seed&quot;, restoring the alternation between &quot;Mole&quot; and &quot;Chub&quot; songs.
*Open Up – 2:18
*Anvil Forest – 2:22
*Scent of Mint – 2:27

=== 2019 pREServed edition (&quot;Mole Box&quot;) ===
A deluxe box set pertaining to the entire Mole Trilogy concept was released in 2019. It contained newly remastered editions of &quot;Mark of the Mole&quot;, &quot;The Tunes of Two Cities&quot; and &quot;The Big Bubble&quot;, as well as recordings of the Mole Show and a sixth disc of miscellaneous recordings related to the project. Disc Two is shown here for its relevance.

<doc id="757705" wikidata="Q425293" url="?curid=757705" title="Fosinopril">
<text>Fosinopril is an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor used for the treatment of hypertension and some types of chronic heart failure. Fosinopril is the only phosphonate-containing ACE inhibitor marketed, by Bristol-Myers Squibb under the trade name Monopril. Fosinopril is a cascading pro-drug. The special niche for the medication that differentiates it from the other members of the ACE Inhibitor drug class is that was specifically developed for the use for patients with renal impairment. This was through manipulation of the metabolism and excretion, and is seen that fifty percent of the drug is hepatobiliary cleared, which can compensate for diminished renal clearance. The remaining fifty percent is excreted in urine. It does not need dose adjustment. 

It was patented in 1980 and approved for medical use in 1991.

==Medical uses==
In congestive heart failure, the ability of the heart to pump enough blood to satisfy the physiological needs of the body is reduced. This condition has a variety of causes, including damaged heart valves, myocardial infarction, hypertension, vitamin B1 deficiency, and genetic mutations. When subsequent blood flow to the kidneys is reduced, the kidneys respond by increasing the secretion of renin from the juxtaglomerular apparatus. Renin converts the inactive angiotensinogen into angiotensin I, which is converted to angiotensin II (AII) by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). AII can have negative effects on the cardiovascular system after events such as heart failure and myocardial infarction. AII causes arterial vasoconstriction and hypertension, resulting in an increase in afterload, increasing the resistance against which the heart works. Additionally, chronic increase in production of AII is associated with structural changes to the myocardium which reduces the functionality of the heart.

In heart failure patients, fosinopril increases exercise tolerance and lowers the frequency of events associated with worsening heart failure, such as dyspnea, the need for supplemental diuretics, fatigue, and hospitalizations.

==Chemistry==
Unlike other ACE inhibitors that are primarily excreted by the kidneys, fosinopril is eliminated from the body by both renal and hepatic pathways. This characteristic of fosinopril makes the drug a safer choice than other ACE inhibitors for heart failure patients with impaired kidney function resulting from poor perfusion as fosinopril can still be eliminated by the liver, preventing accumulation of the drug in the body.

Fosinopril is de-esterified by the liver or gastrointestinal mucosa and is converted to its active form, fosinoprilat. Fosinoprilat competitively binds to ACE, preventing ACE from binding to and converting angiotensin I to angiotensin II. Inhibiting the production of AII lowers peripheral vascular resistance, decreases afterload, and decreases blood pressure, thus helping to alleviate the negative effects of AII on cardiac performance.

<text>Suleiman Shah I ibn Qutalmish (; ; ) founded an independent Seljuk Turkish state in Anatolia and ruled as Seljuk Sultan of Rûm from 1077 until his death in 1086.

==Life==
Suleiman was the son of Qutalmish, who had struggled unsuccessfully against his cousin Alp Arslan for the throne of the Great Seljuk Empire. When Qutalmish died in 1064, Suleiman fled with his three brothers into the Taurus Mountains and there sought refuge with Turkoman tribes living beyond the borders of the empire. Alp Arslan responded by launching a series of punitive expeditions against them. Of the four brothers, Suleiman alone with his brother Mansur survived the raids and was able to consolidate his leadership of the Turkomans living in the Taurus Mountains.

===Founding his realm===
According to the chronicler Al-Azimi, Suleiman captured Nicaea in 1075. Based on this date, some historians accepted that the Anatolian Seljuk State was founded on this date, and others between 1078-1081. Thereupon, sultan Malik-Shah I recognized him as a ruler of Rum, while the Abbasid caliph Al-Qa&#x27;im sent him a firman (edict) and a khalat for his success. There is no single record of him minting coins and delivering a khutbah (sermon) in his own name. For this reason, it can be said that he was still subject to the Great Seljuk Empire. As a matter of fact, there are clear statements in various sources about his subjection to Malik-Shah I.

In 1078, the Byzantine emperor Michael VII sought the help of Suleiman against Nicephorus Botaneiates, the commander of the Anatolic Theme, who had challenged the emperor for the throne. Suleiman intercepted Botaneiates&#x27; small force between Cotyaeum and Nicaea, whereupon the usurper persuaded Suleiman and Mansur to join his rebellion by offering him incentives superior to those of the emperor. Nicephorus&#x27; bid for power was successful, and in return for their support, Suleiman&#x27;s Turkmen were allowed to settle on the Asiatic side of the Bosphorus, near Constantinople itself. Two years later, Suleiman lent his support to another pretender, Nicephorus Melissenus. It was the latter Nicephorus who opened the gates of Nicaea to the Turkmen, allowing Suleiman to establish a permanent base. All Bithynia was soon under Suleiman&#x27;s control, a circumstance which allowed him to restrict communication between Constantinople and the former Byzantine subjects in Anatolia.

In 1084, Suleiman left Nicaea, leaving his kinsman Abu&#x27;l Qasim in charge. That same year, he captured Antakya from the Byzantine governor, Philaretos Brachamios. Following Suleiman&#x27;s capture of Antakya, the Uqaylid Muslim ibn Quraysh demanded tribute. Suleiman refused, which was followed by border raids by both sides. In 1085, Muslim ibn Quraysh marched an army to besiege Antakya, Suleiman intercepted him and defeated Muslim after the latter&#x27;s army suffered the defection of Turkmen under the command of Cubuk bey.

===His death ===
In 1086, Suleiman, seeking to expand his dominion, placed Aleppo under siege and demanded its surrender. The emir of Aleppo sent a message to Tutush I, the Seljuk ruler of Syria, stating he would hand the city over to him. Suleiman, hearing of the approach of Tutush&#x27;s forces, raised the siege and marched to meet him. In the battle of Ain Salm near Aleppo, Suleiman attacked Tutush but his forces fled before Tutush&#x27;s army under Artuk Bey and Suleiman was killed.

Malik-Shah marched to Antakya, where Suleiman&#x27;s vizier surrendered both the city and Suleiman&#x27;s son, Kilij Arslan I. Malik Shah transferred Kilij to Isfahan as a hostage.

Upon the death of Malik-Shah I, Kilij Arslan I re-established the Sultanate of Rûm.

<text>The Hidatsa are a Siouan people. They are enrolled in the federally recognized Three Affiliated Tribes of the Fort Berthold Reservation in North Dakota. Their language is related to that of the Crow, and they are sometimes considered a parent tribe to the modern Crow in Montana.

== Name ==
The Hidatsa&#x27;s autonym is Hiraacá. According to the tribal tradition, the word &quot;hiraacá&quot; derives from the word &quot;willow&quot;; however, the etymology is not transparent and the similarity to &quot;mirahací&quot; ‘willows’ inconclusive. The present name &quot;Hidatsa&quot; was formerly borne by one of the three tribal villages. When the villages consolidated, the name was adopted for the tribe as a whole.

They are called the &quot;Mį́nįtaree&quot; (″to cross the water″) by their allies, the Mandan; in Assiniboine the Assiniboine (called Hidusidi by the Hidatsa) know them as: &quot;wakmúhaza yúde, ȟewáktųkta&quot;

Occasionally they have also been confused with the Gros Ventres in present-day Montana and Prairie Provinces of Canada, which were part of the Arapahoan languages speaking peoples. The nomadic Gros Ventre were called &quot;Minnetarees of Fort de Prairie, Minnetarees of the Prairie, Minnetarees of the Plains&quot; or &quot;Gros Ventres of the Prairie&quot; while the semisedentary Hidatsa were known as &quot;Minnetarees of the Missouri&quot; or &quot;Gros Ventres of the Missouri&quot;.

== History ==
=== Until 1850 ===

For hundreds of years the Knife River area in present North Dakota was the home of the Hidatsa and their ancestors. The first villages date back to the 13th century.

Accounts of recorded history in the early 18th century identify three closely related village groups to which the term Hidatsa is applied. What is now known as the Hidatsa tribe is the amalgamation of these three groups, which had discrete histories and spoke different dialects; they came together only after settling on the Missouri River (Awati /Awáati).

The Awaxawi (&quot;Village on the Hill&quot;) or Amahami (&quot;Broken Land&quot;, &quot;Mountainous Country&quot;) have a creation tradition similar to that of the Mandan, which describes their emergence long ago from the Earth, at Devil&#x27;s Lake (Miri xopash / Mirixubáash / Miniwakan) (&quot;Holy Water there&quot;). Later they moved westward to the Painted Woods (near Square Buttes or Awakotchkesshesh) and settled near a village of Mandan and another of Awatixa.

The Awatixa (&quot;Village of the Scattered Lodges&quot;) or Awadixá (″High Village″) originated not from the earth, but from the sky, led by Charred Body. According to their tradition, their first people lived near Painted Woods, &quot;where they were created.&quot; After that they always lived between the Heart River (Naada Aashi / Naadáashishh) and Knife River (Mee ecci Aashi / Mé&#x27;cii&#x27;aashish) along the Middle Missouri River (Awati / Awáati).

The Hidatsa proper or Hiraacá / Hiratsa (&quot;People of the Willows&quot;), largest of the three, were a confederation of numerous nomadic Hidatsa bands from the north, who separated from the &quot;Awaxawi/Amahami&quot; in what is now western Minnesota. First they settled to the north, then later moved south to Devil&#x27;s Lake. In their travels they met the Mandan (Adahpakoa / Aróxbagua) (sometimes also called: Araxbakua Itawatish) and then moved westward and settled with these distant relatives north of the Knife River, where they adopted agriculture and permanent villages. Later they moved to the mouth of Knife River. Their territory ranged upstream along the Missouri River, its tributary regions to the west, and the Mouse River and Devils Lake regions to the northeast. They were initially part of those who would become the River Crow. The Hidatsa called the Crow Nation &quot;Gixaa&#x27;iccá / Gixáa-iccá&quot; (&quot;Those Who Pout Over Tripe&quot;).

The Hidatsa originally lived in &quot;Miri xopash / Mirixubáash / Miniwakan&quot;, the Devils Lake region of North Dakota, before being pushed southwestward by the Lakota (Itahatski / Idaahácgi). As they migrated west, the Hidatsa came across the Mandan at the mouth of the Heart River. The two groups formed an alliance, and settled into an amiable division of territory along the area&#x27;s rivers.
Prior to the epidemic of 1782, they had few enemies. The Hidatsa hunted upstream from the earthlodge villages at and below the Knife River. Here, between the Knife and Yellowstone River (Mii Ciiri Aashi /Mi&#x27;cíiriaashish), they were numerous enough to withstand attacks of the Assiniboine (Hidusidi / Hirushíiri), who hunted in the area but rarely wintered on the Missouri River, as part of the mighty Iron Confederacy (which was dominated by the Cree (Sahe / Shahíi) and Assiniboine) they were an opponent the Hidatsa had to pay attention to.

A remarkable siege of the village Big Hidatsa by the Sioux around 1790 ended with a major victory for the inhabitants. They killed 100 or more retreating Sioux in a counterattack, according to the sources.

Around 1795, John Tanner was present among the Mandan when they attempted to organize a concerted war against the Hidatsa, with allies from as far away as the Great Lakes, including Tanner&#x27;s adopted Odawa family from Michigan. However, the attack fell apart in its planning stages.

The Hidatsa played a central role in the Great Plains Indian trading networks based on an advantageous geographical position combined with a surplus from agriculture and craft. Historical sources show that the Hidatsa villages were visited by Cree, Assiniboine, Crow, Cheyenne, Arapaho, Kiowa, Plains Apache and Comanche. White traders from the north, like North West Company man David Thompson, began to visit the Hidatsa and Mandan villages during the 1790s.

In 1800, a group of Hidatsa abducted Sacagawea and several other girls in a battle that resulted in death among the Shoshone (Maabúgsharuxbaaga) (&quot;Snake People&quot;) of four men, four women and several boys. She was taken as a captive to a Hidatsa village near present-day Washburn, North Dakota.

In 1804, Lewis and Clark came to the Hidatsa (they referred to them as the &quot;Minnetaree&quot; in their records) in three villages at the mouth of the Knife River, and the Mandan in two villages a few miles lower down on the Missouri River.

In July 1825, the &quot;Grovonters [Hidatsas] came into council &amp; treaties of peace &amp; Trade &amp; friendship were concluded&quot; with the United States. The tribe – in the document called &quot;Belantse-Etoa or Minitaree&quot; – also recognized the supremacy of the United States, whether it understood it or not. The peace treaty was never broken. &quot;We have always been friends to the whites&quot;, emphasized Wolf Chief in 1888, and it never came to fights with the United States Army.

Tribal appearance and customs have been documented by the visits of two artists of the American west. The allied tribes were first visited by American George Catlin, who remained with them several months in 1832. He was followed by Karl Bodmer, a Swiss painter accompanying German explorer Maximilian of Wied-Neuwied on a Missouri River expedition from 1832 to 1834. Catlin and Bodmer&#x27;s works record the Hidatsa and Mandan societies, where were rapidly changing under pressure from encroaching settlers, infectious disease, and government restraints.

In the spring of 1834, the Awaxawi and Awatixa settled in Big Hidatsa by necessity. The Sioux had attacked the Hidatsa villages and reduced &quot;the two lower ones to ashes&quot;. Both before and after the smallpox epidemic in 1837, bloody fights took place between the Hidatsa and foes like the Assiniboine and the Yanktonai Sioux. Each tribe gave and took.

The smallpox epidemic of 1837–1838 reduced the Hidatsa to about 500 people. The remaining Mandan and Hidatsa united, and moved farther up the Missouri in 1845. &quot;Bands of Sioux waylaid hunting parties or came prowling around our villages to steal horses&quot;, explained Buffalo Bird Woman the reason for leaving their native land through centuries along Knife River. They eventually settled at Like-a-Fishhook Village (Mua iruckup hehisa atis, Mu&#x27;a-idu&#x27;skupe-hi&#x27;cec) near Fort Berthold, a trading post. They were joined there by the Arikara (Adakadaho / Aragárahu) in 1862.

=== 1851–1900 ===

The Hidatsa tribe was one party in the Treaty of Fort Laramie, 1851. Along with the Mandan and the Arikara, they got a treaty on land north of Heart River. Eleven years later, the Three Tribes would not inhabit a single summer village in the treaty area. The Lakota had more or less annexed it, although a participant in the peace treaty.
Encouraged by Karl Bodmer, Swiss artist Rudolph F. Kurz traveled the Northern Plains in the early 1850s. He left an account as well as sketches of the village tribes.

Four Bears, outstanding Hidatsa war chief after the smallpox epidemic of 1837, (was one of the people who started Like-A-Fishhook Village for the Hidatsa, Mandan, and Arikara – and is not to be mistaken with the famous Mandan chief Mato-tope (Four Bears)), was killed along with other villagers by attacking Yankton Sioux in 1861. In December 1862, some Sioux burned parts of Like a Fishhook Village and they may have lifted cached corn at the same time.

Attacks made on their homes like this made the Three Tribes call for the United States Army to intervene. Already in 1857, the Hidatsa chief Long Hair had accused the Sioux of trying to be &quot;the strongest and most powerful people on the Earth&quot;. Years later it would be chief Crows Breast&#x27;s turn to raise hard-worded complaints about the Sioux.

The Hidatsas were not idle themselves, at times even raiding Lakotas south of Heart River.

Around 1870 a band of &quot;dissident&quot; Hidatsas led by Bobtail Bull and later Crow Flies High left the orthodox or conservative group in Like a Fishhook Village. For protection, they build a new village just two miles west of the military post Fort Buford. At times the men scouted for the Army. By keeping a low profile while hunting deer and other small game along the Little Missouri, they succeeded as non-reservation Indians until 1894.

The Three Tribes sold a segment of land to the United States in 1870. The last treaty that diminished the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation was signed in 1886 (ratified in 1891). In the next century, the tribes would win a claims case and receive payment for some of the land lost by executive order fifty years before.

The all-overshadowing troubles with the Lakotas faded after the conclusion of a peace agreement in 1875, with Colonel G. A. Custer as mediator. From then on, the Hidatsa would focus more and more on disagreements with the officials in the capital city.

Good Bear performed the Naxpike (Sun Dance of the Hidatsa) in 1879. He was the final Hidatsa to do so.

== Culture ==

The Hidatsa are a matrilineal people, with descent determined through the maternal line. As the early Mandan and Hidatsa heavily intermarried, children were taught to speak the language of their mother, but understand the dialect of either tribe. A short description of Hidatsa-Mandan culture, including a grammar and vocabulary of the Hidatsa language, was published in 1877 by Washington Matthews, a government physician assigned to the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation.

During the early 20th century, Gilbert Livingston Wilson carried out extensive ethnographic work with the elderly Hidatsa woman, Buffalo Bird Woman. He also interviewed members of her immediate family at Fort Berthold. From his information gathered from them, Wilson described traditional economy, ceremony, and day-to-day practices as remembered by Buffalo-Bird Woman, who lived at Like-a-Fishhook Village.

Frances Densmore recorded a number of ceremonial and personal songs of the Hidatsas before 1920.

Archaeological investigations have provided evidence for the presence of multiple genders in Hidats society pre-colonisation.

<text>The Arikara (), also known as Sahnish, Arikaree, Ree, or Hundi, are a tribe of Native Americans in North Dakota and South Dakota. Today, they are enrolled with the Mandan and the Hidatsa as the federally recognized tribe known as the Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara Nation.

==Synonymy==
The Arikara&#x27;s name is believed to mean &quot;horns&quot;, in reference to the ancient custom of wearing two upright bones in their hair. The name also could mean &quot;elk people&quot; or &quot;corn eaters&quot;.

==Language==
The Arikara language is a member of the Caddoan language family. Arikara is close to the Pawnee language, but they are not mutually intelligible. As of 2007, the total number of remaining native speakers was reported as ten, one of whom, Maude Starr, died on 20 January 2010. She was a certified language teacher who participated in Arikara language education programs.

== Early history ==
Linguistic divergence between Arikara and Pawnee suggests a separation from the Skidi Pawnee in about the 15th century. The Arzberger site near present-day Pierre, South Dakota, designated as a National Historic Landmark, is an archeological site from this period, containing the remains of a fortified village with more than 44 lodges.

An Arikara village, near where present-day Pierre, South Dakota developed, was visited in 1743 by two sons of the French trader and explorer La Vérendrye.

In the last quarter of the 17th century, the Arikara came under attack from the Omaha/Ponca and the Iowa near the end of the Omaha/Ponca migration to Nebraska. With peace established later, the Arikara influenced the newcomers. The Omaha still credit the Arikara women for instructing them in the art of building earth lodges.

== Culture and lifestyle ==
The Arikara lived as a semi-nomadic people on the Great Plains. During the sedentary seasons, the Arikara lived primarily in villages of earth lodges. While traveling or during the seasonal bison hunts, they erected portable &quot;tipis&quot; as temporary shelter. They were primarily an agricultural society, whose women cultivated varieties of corn (or maize). The crop was such an important staple of their society that it was referred to as &quot;Mother Corn.&quot;

An early European, a botanist, praised the Arikara women as excellent cultivators. He had not seen finer crops anywhere in America. The surplus corn and other crops, along with tobacco, were traded to the Lakota, the Cheyenne and more southern plains tribes during short-lived truces. The amount of trading items passing through the Arikara villages made them a &quot;trading center on the Upper Missouri&quot;. Before smallpox epidemics hit the three village tribes, they were the &quot;most influential and affluent peoples in the Northern Plains&quot;.

Traditionally an Arikara family owned 30–40 dogs. The people used them for hunting and as sentries, but most importantly for transportation in the centuries before the Plains tribes adopted the use of horses in the 1600s. Many of the Plains tribes had used the &quot;travois,&quot; a lightweight transportation device pulled by dogs. It consisted of two long poles attached by a harness at the dog&#x27;s shoulders, with the butt ends dragging behind the animal; midway, a ladder-like frame, or a hoop made of plaited thongs, was stretched between the poles; it held loads that might exceed 60 pounds. Women also used dogs to pull travois to haul firewood or infants. The travois were used to carry meat harvested during the seasonal hunts; a single dog could pull a quarter of a bison.

The Arikara played a central role in the Great Plains Indian trading networks based on an advantageous geographical position combined with a surplus from agriculture and craft. Historical sources show that the Arikara villages were visited by Cree, Assiniboine, Crow, Cheyenne, Arapaho, Sioux, Kiowa, Plains Apache and Comanche.

===Mythology===

The Arikara creation myth shows similarities with the creation myth of the neighboring Mandan people. It begins with the great sky chief Nishanu creating giants. The giants did not respect Nishanu who had created them and most of the giants were destroyed by a great flood. The good giants who were saved became corn kernels under the earth. Nishanu planted corn in the heavens yielding Mother Corn, who went to the earth to lead the people out of the East into the West, but after a time she returned to Heaven and in her absence the people of the earth began to kill one another. She returned to the earth with a leader who taught them how to fight their enemies rather than one another. This is an &quot;emergence&quot; style creation myth, depicting the &quot;Corn Mother&quot; as giving birth to the planted seeds (the remaining good giants after the flood). The figure of the &quot;Corn Mother&quot; can be found in many Native American mythologies. The myth is said to reflect the migrations of the Arikara from East to West.

== History up to 1850 ==

In the late 18th century, the tribe suffered a high rate of fatalities from smallpox epidemics, which reduced their population from an estimated 30,000 to 6,000, disrupting their social structure.

The smallpox epidemic of 1780-1782 reduced the Arikara villages along the Missouri from 32 to 2.

All-out war hit the weakened and often divided Arikara. In a burned-down village, (later studied as Larson Site), archaeologists found the mutilated skeletons of 71 men, women and children, killed in the early 1780s by unknown Native American attackers. Groups of Sioux were the ones who gained most by the weakening of the Arikara. They attacked the vulnerable Arikara and increased &quot;the pace of Sioux expansion&quot; west of the Missouri.

The Arikara faced many challenges during the first quarter of the 19th century: Reduced numbers, competition from white traders, and military pressure from the Lakota and other groups of Sioux. Alliances shifted constantly. The Arikara joined old foes the Sioux in raids on Mandan and Hidatsa Indians. Later they negotiated for peace with both village tribes.

Due to their reduced numbers, the Arikara started to live closer to the Mandan and Hidatsa in the same area for mutual protection. They migrated gradually from present-day Nebraska and South Dakota into North Dakota. The remainder of the group was encountered in 1804 by the Lewis and Clark Expedition.

The first Arikara delegation left for the capital, Washington, DC, in April 1805, urged by the Lewis and Clark Expedition. Chief Ankedoucharo became ill during his stay and died in Washington. The delegates blamed the whites for the chief&#x27;s death. That was one reason why the Arikara for the next decades were &quot;notoriously hostile to white Americans&quot;.

On June 2, 1823, the Arikara attacked a group of 70 trappers led by William Henry Ashley of the Henry/Ashley Company. The trappers were camped near an Arikara village at the mouth of Grand River (north of present-day Mobridge, South Dakota). Fourteen trappers died and 10 were wounded, including Hugh Glass, memorialized in the 1954 biographical novel &quot;Lord Grizzly&quot; by Frederick Manfred, the 2002 historical fiction novel &quot;The Revenant: A Novel of Revenge&quot; by Michael Punke, and the 2015 film &quot;The Revenant&quot;, an adaptation of Punke&#x27;s book.

Colonel Henry Leavenworth left Fort Atkinson (now in Nebraska) with 220 men. More than 700 Yankton, Yanktonai and Lakota Indians joined him in the United States&#x27; first Indian war west of the Missouri. The Arikara retreated to their fortified village. Soon the disappointed Sioux left the battlefield. The Arikara escaped at night, and angry fur traders set their empty lodges ablaze the next morning. &quot;This was the only time in history that any of the Three Tribes fought in open warfare against the United States&quot;.

The Bloody Hand and other Arikara chiefs signed a peace treaty with the United States (US) on July 18, 1825.

In the winter/spring of 1833 members of the Arikara Tribe ambushed Hugh Glass, Hilain Menard and Colin Rose. &quot;A hand-written notation made on the credit side of Menard&#x27;s account book page states, &#x27;Killed by the Rees near Fort Cass Spring 1833,&#x27;&quot; Landry wrote in his article. &quot;The word &#x27;Rees&#x27; was mountaineer slang for the Arikara tribe.&quot; According to a letter written by John F. A. Sanford, an Indian agent, in a July 1833 letter to William Clark, superintendent of Indian Affairs. Landry includes the excerpt in his article.&quot;They scalped them and left part of the Scalps of each tied to poles on the grounds of the murder[.]&quot;

Years of indecision followed. The rootless Arikara lived near their southern &quot;kinfolk,&quot; the Skidi Pawnee, for some years. They also tried their luck in hostile country far up on the Platte (now Nebraska), where Colonel Henry Dodge met them in 1835. Harassed by the numerous Sioux, the Arikara finally buried old enmity and befriended the Mandan and the Hidatsa in the late 1830s. The manager in the trading post Fort Clark observed in June 1838, how &quot;the Rees, Mandans and Gros Ventres [Hidatsas] started out early&quot; in a common bison hunt.

Smallpox had struck the Upper Missouri tribes the year before (and would again in 1856). It decimated the Mandan. The surviving Arikara took over the almost empty Mandan village &quot;Mitutanka&quot; next to Fort Clark. The earth lodges stood until Yankton Sioux set them on fire in January 1839. The village was rebuilt by the Arikara, who lived there until 1861. Another Sioux attack—and the need for a trading post—made them leave the settlement for good.

== History up to 1900 ==
The goal of the United States in the Laramie Treaty of 1851 was to establish a permanent peace on most of the northern plains and to define tribal territories. The basic treaty area of the Arikara, the Hidatsa and the Mandan was a mutual territory north of Heart River, encircled on the east and north by the Missouri and on the west by Yellowstone River down to the mouth of Powder River. The Lakota had continued to press north after 1823, so they got treaty rights on the area along Grand River as well as other land south of Heart River.

Peace was short-lived. As drawings collected by W. J. Hoffman of Hunkpapa Chief Running Antelope showed, in 1853 he already had killed four Arikara Indians. The next year the Three Tribes called for the U. S. Army to intervene; that request was repeated the next two decades.

Arikara hunters were waylaid and had difficulties securing enough game and hides. A lengthy battle between an Arikara camp on hunt and several hundred Lakota took place in June 1858. The Arikara camp lost ten men, with 34 wounded.

The Arikara built Star Village in the spring of 1862. They had to abandon it after a fierce fight with the Sioux a few months later. The Arikara crossed the Missouri and built new earth lodges and log houses near the common Mandan and Hidatsa village Like-a-Fishhook Village. The village was built outside the Three Tribes treaty area. &quot;We, the Arikara, have been driven from our country on the other side of the Missouri River by the Sioux&quot;, declared chief White Shield in 1864.

Like a Fishhook Village was not safe from devastation, strikes or raids for horses (and neither was the nearby trading post Fort Berthold II). Just before the end of 1862, some Sioux burned a part of the village. The affiliation of the Sioux is not always clear: Lakota, Yanktonai and &quot;refugee&quot; Santee Sioux from the Minnesota uprising sometimes attacked the Three Tribes. As always in intertribal warfare, there were interludes with peace - and conflicts with other Indian foes, as for example the Assiniboine.

In 1869, the Three Tribes asked the United States for guns as protection against hostile Sioux, and they finally received 300 pieces.

The Three Tribes sold a part of their southern treaty land, more or less already annexed by the Lakota, to the United States on April 12, 1870. At the same time, they got treaty on the area where Like a Fishhook Village was located.

In June 1874, Colonel George Armstrong Custer in Fort Abraham Lincoln (now North Dakota) received an order to delay his Black Hills Expedition and stop a large war party of Lakota on its way to attack Like a Fishhook Village. &quot;The Rees and Mandans should be protected same as white settlers&quot;, read the order from General Phil Sheridan. Custer failed and the Lakota killed five Arikara and one Mandan.

During the Great Sioux War of 1876, some Arikara served as scouts for Custer in the Little Bighorn Campaign. The Arikara &quot;supplied some of the most faithful and effective Indian scouts&quot; for the Army during the war against the bands of Lakota roaming other peoples&#x27; territories in 1876-1877. &quot;For tribes subject to Sioux pressure for decades, the combination of revenge and self-defense would constitute a powerful motivation&quot; for joining the whites in actions like that. Custer&#x27;s favorite scout, an Arikara known as Bloody Knife, fell during the Battle of the Little Bighorn in the Crow Indian Reservation (now Montana) in 1876.

&quot;Mandans, Arickarees and Gros Ventres&quot; were among the first Indian children to arrive at Hampton Institute, a historically black college, in Virginia for schooling, in 1878.

The Fort Berthold Indian Reservation got a new shape and size by agreement in 1886 (ratified in 1891). In 1910, the Three Tribes gave their consent to sale of land, so the reservation was reduced once more. The Arikara drifted away from Like a Fishhook Village. They raised and branded cattle instead of hunting buffalo. With the Dawes Act and &quot;allotment in severalty&quot; passed as another attempt at assimilation to European-American culture, each Arikara family was allotted a homestead of 160 acres in the early 1890s. The Arikara Indians were considered citizens of the United States—and no more tribal village dwellers.

The three tribes are settled on the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation in North Dakota.

==In popular culture==
In the 2015 film &quot;The Revenant&quot;, Arikara warriors act as major antagonists in the early part of the film. Trappers refer to them both by their proper name and as Ree, and the 1823 attack on Andrew Henry&#x27;s trapping expedition is accurate. Furthermore, the production was noted for its efforts to reproduce Pawnee and Arikara speech as accurately as possible.

<doc id="757718" wikidata="Q7784916" url="?curid=757718" title="Third Period">
<text>The Third Period is an ideological concept adopted by the Communist International (Comintern) at its Sixth World Congress, held in Moscow in the summer of 1928. It set policy until reversed when the Nazis took over Germany in 1933.

The Comintern&#x27;s theory was based on its economic and political analysis of world capitalism, which posited the division of recent history into three periods. These included a &quot;First Period&quot; that followed World War I and saw the revolutionary upsurge and defeat of the working class, as well as a &quot;Second Period&quot; of capitalist consolidation for most of the decade of the 1920s. According to the Comintern&#x27;s analysis, the current phase of world economy from 1928 onward, the &quot;Third Period&quot;, was to be a time of widespread economic collapse and mass working class radicalization. This economic and political discord would again make the time ripe for proletarian revolution if militant policies were rigidly maintained by communist vanguard parties, the Comintern believed.

Communist policies during the Third Period were marked by pronounced hostility to reformism and political organizations espousing it as an impediment to the movement&#x27;s revolutionary objectives. In the field of trade unions, a move was made during the Third Period towards the establishment of radical dual unions under communist party control rather than continuation of the previous policy of attempting to radicalize existing unions by &quot;boring from within&quot;.

The rise of the Nazi Party to power in Germany in 1933 and the annihilation of the organized communist movement there shocked the Comintern into reassessing the tactics of the Third Period. From 1934, new alliances began to be formed under the aegis of the &quot;Popular Front&quot;. The Popular Front policy was formalized as the official policy of the world communist movement by the Seventh World Congress of the Comintern in 1935.

==Political and theoretic basis==
Although the term &quot;Third Period&quot; is closely associated with Stalin, it was first coined by Bukharin in 1926, at the Seventh Plenum of the ECCI to describe the conditions for further revolutions outside Russia. The view of the Comintern was that after the &quot;First Period&quot; of revolutionary upsurge in 1917 and the following years, a &quot;Second Period&quot; had followed in which capitalism stabilised itself and the international proletariat was pushed onto the defensive. In foreseeing a &quot;Third Period&quot;, Bukharin sketched out the weaknesses inherent in capitalism which would lead to renewed class conflict. Principal among these, he argued, was a struggle for markets which would lead to intense pressures to reduce costs of production. These reductions would involve Taylorism as well as longer shifts and wage-cuts, driving wages down and unemployment up. The consequent lowering of living standards amongst the working class would lead to the intensification of class struggles and greater support for communism.

These periodic distinctions were important to the Comintern&#x27;s work because they entailed different tactics on the part of communist parties outside the USSR. The &quot;Second Period&quot; was characterised by the &quot;united front&quot; policy (1923–28) within which communist parties strove to work together with social democratic parties to defend the wages, jobs and rights of working-class people and build the political basis for the future dictatorship of the proletariat. The Third Period, in contrast, saw a sharp turn against these tactics in favour of &quot;class against class&quot; (1928–34); here communist parties actively rejected collaboration with social democrats, attacking them as &quot;social fascists&quot; or, in Stalin&#x27;s own formulation, &quot;the moderate wing of fascism&quot;.

==Impact on the USSR==
In December 1927, the All-Union Communist Party held its Fifteenth Party Congress; prior to this Congress, the faction of the Party led by Stalin had supported the continuation of the New Economic Policy (NEP). However, in the cities, industry had become undercapitalized, and prices were rising. In the countryside, moreover, the NEP had resulted in an enrichment of certain privileged sections of the Russian and Ukrainian peasantry (the Kulaks) because of deregulation of prices for grain.

These events were leading to growing economic and political instability. The towns were being threatened with a &quot;chronic danger of famine&quot; in 1928-1929. The Left Opposition had opposed the continued marketization of agriculture through the NEP, and, since 1924, had repeatedly called for investment in industry, some collectivization in agriculture and democratisation of the Party. Threatened by the growing power and revolt from the countryside led by the Kulaks and the strengthening bourgeoisie, the Fifteenth Congress of the All-Union Communist Party passed resolutions that supported for some of the planks of the Opposition&#x27;s platform, and on paper, the Congress&#x27; views appeared very left, politically. However, the Left Opposition was expelled.

The new policies of industrialisation and collectivisation now adopted were given the slogan &quot;socialist accumulation&quot;. The Communist party had publicly proposed collectivisation to be voluntary; however, official policy was almost always ignored in practice; threats and false promises were used to motivate peasants into joining the communes. Eventually, in what Issac Deutscher calls &quot;the great change&quot;, the policies of industrialisation and collectivisation were carried out in a ruthless and brutal way, via the use of the security and military forces, without the direct involvement of the working class and peasantry itself and without seeming regard for the social consequences. According to figures given by Deutscher, the peasants opposed forced collectivisation by slaughtering 18 million horses, 30 million cattle, about 45 per cent of the total, and 100 million sheep and goats, about two thirds of the total. Those who engaged in these behaviours, deemed Kulaks, were dealt with harshly; in December 1929, Stalin issued a call to &quot;liquidate the Kulaks as a class&quot;. A distinction was made between the elimination of the Kulaks &quot;as a class&quot; and the killing of the individuals themselves; nevertheless, at least 530,000 to 600,000 deaths resulted from dekulakization from 1929 to 1933, and Robert Conquest has estimated that there could have been as many as five million deaths. Kulaks could be shot or imprisoned by the GPU, have their property confiscated before being sent into internal exile (in Siberia, the North, the Urals, or Kazakhstan), or be evicted from their houses and sent to work in labour colonies in their own district. There is debate amongst historians as to whether the actions of the Kulaks and their supporters helped lead to famine, or whether the policy of collectivisation itself was responsible. (See Collectivisation in the USSR, Holodomor.)

==Impact on communist parties outside the USSR==
In the West, the crisis of capitalism was coming to a head with the beginning of the Great Depression in 1929, and the Communist International&#x27;s Sixth Congress viewed capitalism as entering a final death agony, its &quot;third period of existence&quot; where the first had been capitalism during its rise prior to World War I, and the second was the short period after the crushing of the post-World War I revolutions when capitalism seemed again to have stabilised.

The formal institution of the Third Period occurred at the 9th Plenum of the Executive Committee of the Communist International (E.C.C.I.) in February 1928. This helped in dovetailing the &quot;Left&quot; of the All-Union Communist party with that of the Comintern itself.

To the Comintern, a decisive and final revolutionary upheaval was afoot and all its sections had to prepare for the immediate advent of world revolution. As part of this theory, because the Comintern felt that conditions were strong enough, it demanded that its political positions within the workers&#x27; movement be consolidated and that all &quot;reactionary&quot; elements be purged. Accordingly, attacks and expulsions were launched against social democrats and moderate socialists within labour unions where the local CP had majority support, as well as Trotskyists and united front proponents. The All-Union Communist Party also encouraged armed rebellion in China, Germany, and elsewhere.

Although shortcomings and crippling ideological vacillations brought this Period to an end, the tone of the &quot;Third Period&quot; resonated powerfully with the mood of many militant workers of the time, especially following the Stock Market Crash of 1929 and the ensuing crises of the 1930s. In many countries, including the United States, local Communist Parties&#x27; membership and influence grew as a result of the &quot;Third Period&quot; policies.

==&quot;Social fascism&quot;==

One notable development in this period was that Communists organized the unemployed into a political force, despite their distance from the means of production. Another distinguishing feature of this policy was that Communists fought against their rivals on the left as vehemently as their opponents on the right of the political spectrum, with special viciousness directed at real or imaginary followers of Leon Trotsky. Social Democrats were targeted by Communist polemics, in which they were dubbed &quot;social fascists.&quot;

Trotskyists have blamed Stalin&#x27;s line for the rise of Nazism because it precluded unity between the German communists with the German Social Democrats. Hitler&#x27;s rise to power, consequently, was also a reason for the abandonment of the policy in favor of the Popular Front strategy because Germany became the biggest security threat to the Soviet Union.

==North America==

Historians of the left have debated the contribution made by Communist activism in North America during the Third Period. Some authors like Robin D. G. Kelley and John Manley have penned local histories that portray Communist Party members as effective activists, heroic in many cases because their revolutionary zeal helped them confront extremely adverse circumstances. Despite the shadow of Stalinism, in this perspective, the important positive contributions Communist organizers made in working class history should not be discounted.

Critics of this perspective argue that these histories gloss over or ignore both the horrors of Stalinism and also the devastating consequences of the Third Period inasmuch as it facilitated the rise of Hitler and alienated the working class writ large from the left because of its sectarianism and adventurism.

<doc id="757724" wikidata="Q6596634" url="?curid=757724" title="List of Second Anglo-Afghan War Victoria Cross recipients">
<text>The Victoria Cross (VC) was awarded to 16 members of the British Armed Forces for action during the Second Afghan War of 1878–1880. The Victoria Cross is a military decoration awarded for valour &quot;in the face of the enemy&quot; to members of the armed forces of some Commonwealth countries and previous British Empire territories. The VC was introduced in Great Britain on 29 January 1856 by Queen Victoria to reward acts of valour during the Crimean War, and takes precedence over all other orders, decorations and medals. It may be awarded to a person of any rank in any service and to civilians under military command. The first ceremony was held on 26 June 1857, when Queen Victoria invested 62 of the 111 Crimean recipients in Hyde Park.

The original Royal Warrant did not contain a specific clause regarding posthumous awards, although official policy was to not award the VC posthumously. Between 1897 and 1901, several notices were issued in the &quot;London Gazette&quot; regarding soldiers who would have been awarded the VC had they survived. In a partial reversal of policy in 1902, six of the soldiers mentioned were granted the VC, but not &quot;officially&quot; awarded the medal. In 1907, the posthumous policy was completely reversed and medals were sent to the next of kin of the six officers and men. The Victoria Cross warrant was not officially amended to explicitly allow posthumous awards until 1920, but one quarter of all awards for the First World War were posthumous.

In the 19th century, Afghanistan was seen as an important buffer state to the north-west of British-ruled India. In 1866 Sher Ali Khan came to power and was initially well disposed towards Britain. During the next 10 years, relations between the two countries deteriorated, primarily over the issue of Russian encroachment on Afghanistan. In 1878, Sher Ali reluctantly allowed a Russian mission to Kabul, and refused entry to the Viceroy Lord Lytton. After this refusal, Britain sent him an ultimatum that demanded a British envoy be accepted into Afghanistan; when this was ignored, Britain sent in three columns of British troops. The three British columns proceeded over the Bolan Pass to Kandahar, the Khyber Pass to Ali Masjid and through the Kurram Valley to Kabul. After several large victories for the British in 1878, fighting continued in the harsh mountainous terrain through the early months of 1879. As the British marched on Kabul, Sher Ali fled, leaving Yakub Khan to sign the Treaty of Gandamak on 26 May 1879 which required a British envoy in Kabul and the relinquishing of foreign affairs to the British. When the Afghan army mutinied in late 1879, Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts launched punitive actions and he occupied Kabul on 6 October 1879. After a popular uprising in December, Roberts withdrew to Sherpur where they were besieged for three weeks before launching a major attack on 22–23 December where they returned to Kabul and occupied it once again. Abdur Rahman Khan was instated as Emir in July 1880 but Ayub Khan led a rebel force which defeated the British at the Battle of Maiwand and besieged Kandahar. Roberts led a force from Kabul to Kandahar that defeated the rebels at the Battle of Kandahar on 1 September 1880. British forces withdrew in 1887 after Abdur Khan confirmed the initial Treaty of Gandamak and Britain&#x27;s control over foreign policy.

<text>Baron Hervey is an aristocratic title that has been created three times, once in the Peerage of Ireland and twice in the Peerage of England.

The first creation was in the Peerage of Ireland in 1620, when Sir William Hervey, 1st Baronet, was made Baron Hervey, of Rosse in County Wexford. He had been created Baronet of St. Martin&#x27;s in the Fields on 31 May 1619.

The second creation was in 1628, when the same William Hervey was also made Baron Hervey, of Kidbrooke, Kent, in the Peerage of England. When William Hervey died in 1642, both titles became extinct.

The third creation came in 1703 in the Peerage of England, when John Hervey was made Baron Hervey, of Ickworth, Suffolk. John Hervey was a second cousin thrice removed of William Hervey and was later created Earl of Bristol.

<text>(3 February 1943 – 1 January 2021) was a Japanese actor.

==Biography==
Fukumoto started acting at age 15 in Kyoto, the capital of Japanese cinema. A specialist in film and television jidaigeki set in the Edo period, he most often played a rōnin, but in his hundreds of appearances he took nearly every role. His forte was &quot;kirareyaku&quot;, the person who loses the sword fight. His signature death move was the Ebi-zori, translated into &#x27;prawn bend&#x27;. It is reported he has been killed over 50,000 times on screen. 

In addition, he appeared in modern dramas in roles such as police and yakuza. The American film &quot;The Last Samurai&quot; brought him before an international audience in the role of the Silent Samurai. 

Fukumoto played a lead role for the first time in the film &quot;Uzumasa Limelight&quot;.

==Death==
Fukumoto died on 1 January 2021, at his home in Kyoto, due to lung cancer. He was 77 years old.

<text>Quattro (meaning &quot;four&quot; in Italian and stylized as quattro) is the trademark used by the automotive brand Audi to indicate that all-wheel drive (AWD) technologies or systems are used on specific models of its automobiles.

The word &quot;quattro&quot; is a registered trademark of Audi AG, a subsidiary of the German automotive enterprise, Volkswagen Group.

Quattro was first introduced in 1980 on the permanent four-wheel drive Audi Quattro model, often referred to as the &quot;-Quattro&quot; (meaning &quot;original&quot; or &quot;first&quot;). The term quattro has since been applied to all subsequent Audi AWD models. Due to the nomenclature rights derived from the trademark, the word quattro is now always spelled with a lower case &quot;q&quot; by the manufacturer, in honour of its former namesake.

Other companies in the Volkswagen Group have used different trademarks for their 4WD vehicles. While Audi has always used the term &quot;quattro&quot;, Volkswagen-branded cars initially used &quot;syncro&quot;, but more recently, VW uses &quot;4motion&quot;. Škoda simply uses the nomenclature &quot;4x4&quot; after the model name, whereas SEAT uses merely &quot;4&quot; (&quot;4Drive&quot; more recently). None of the above trademarks or nomenclatures defines the operation or type of 4WD system, as detailed below.

==Longitudinal systems==
 Volkswagen Group has been developing four-wheel drive (4WD) systems almost since its inception during the Second World War. The Volkswagen Kübelwagen, Volkswagen Schwimmwagen, and Volkswagen Kommandeurswagen were all military vehicles which required all four road wheels to be &quot;driven&quot;, the latter being a 4WD Volkswagen Beetle. Their military and four-wheel drive experiences later aided them in designing the Volkswagen Iltis for the German military (&quot;Bundeswehr&quot;) in the 1970s. The Iltis utilized an early form of 4WD, which would later become synonymous with &quot;quattro&quot;.

===Locking centre differential===
In that original quattro system, later found in road-going passenger cars, the engine and transmission are situated in a longitudinal position. Torque is sent through the transmission to a mechanical centre differential (commonly abbreviated to &quot;diff&quot;) which apportions (distributes) the torque between front and rear driven axles. 4WD was permanently active.

===The Torsen T1 centre differential===
After 1987, Audi replaced a manually locking centre differential with the Torsen (torque sensing) Type 1 (&quot;T1&quot;) centre differential. This allowed engine torque to be automatically directed to individual axles as driving conditions and grip warranted. Under &#x27;normal&#x27; conditions (where grip in both front and rear axles is equal), torque is split between front and rear with a &#x27;default&quot; 50:50 distribution in many, though not all, versions. In adverse conditions (i.e., when there is variation in grip between front and rear), a maximum of 90-100% (depending on the transmission, or model of Torsen diff) of the engine&#x27;s torque can be directed to the front or rear axles. The fully automated mechanical nature of the Torsen centre differential helps prevent wheel slippage from occurring, by diverting torque instantly, without any discernible notice to the vehicle occupants, to the axle which has more grip. This method of operation can be described as proactive. Furthermore, unlike the various types of electronically operated differentials, Torsen has no requirement for electronic data from sources such as road wheel speed sensors; it, therefore, has an element of &quot;fail-safe&quot;, unlike designs such as Haldex Traction, should one of the wheel speed sensors develop a fault. In comparison, viscous coupling and electronically controlled centre differentials that are used in other four-wheel drive systems are reactive, since they only redirect torque &quot;after&quot; wheel slippage has occurred. The advantage is felt under hard acceleration, including whilst cornering, since the torque transfer between axles is seamless, thus maintaining stable vehicle dynamics, and considerably reducing the chance of losing control of the vehicle.
The Torsen-based quattro system also offers an advantage in the opposite function of distributing torque to the road wheels, namely engine braking. When engine braking is used to slow the car down, with Torsen-based systems, the resulting &quot;reverse-torque&quot; loads on the front and rear axle are equally stabilized, in exactly the same way that engine &quot;propulsion&quot; torque is apportioned fully mechanically autonomously. This allows the spreading of the engine braking effect to all four wheels and tyres. The Torsen-based quattro-equipped vehicle is able to execute a more stable high-speed turn under deceleration, with less risk of losing control due to loss of grip in the front or rear axles.

This configuration of the quattro system, however, does have some limitations:
# With placement of the engine and transmission assembly in a fore/aft position (longitudinally), the front axle is placed rearwards behind the engine, which leads to the criticism of some Audi vehicles as being nose heavy. This results in a weight distribution of 55:45 (F:R).
# The nature of the Torsen is akin to that of a limited slip differential in that, rather than actively allocating torque (as a computer controlled clutch can do), it supports a torque difference across the differential (the torque bias ratio/TBR), from the side with the least grip to the side with the most. Hence by nature the Torsen is limited in the amount of torque that can be supplied to the axle with the most grip by the torque available at the axle with the least amount of grip. Therefore, if one axle has no grip, regardless of the TBR, the other axle will not be supplied substantial torque. In the extreme, for a centre differential implementation, complete loss of traction on a single wheel will result in very limited torque to the other three wheels. Audi responded to this limitation for the first Torsen-equipped cars by adding a manually locking rear differential and then later replaced this feature with Electronic Differential Lock (EDL), which is the ability to use the individual wheel brakes (monitored by the ABS sensors) to limit individual wheel spin. EDL was implemented across both front and rear (open) differentials to operate at speeds less than 80 km/h. This has the effect of increasing torque from a single low-traction wheel hence allowing more torque to be passed by the Torsen to the remaining high-traction wheels.
# While the standard (Type 1 or &quot;T1&quot;) Torsen supports a static torque ratio of 50:50; i.e., input torque is supported equally across both output shafts, the T1 has a Torque Bias Ratio (TBR) of 2.7–4:1; i.e., it allows about 3 to 4 times the torque to be supplied to the most tractive output shaft than that is available on the least tractive shaft or, a torque split of between 25% and 75%. However, by nature the T1 Torsen is locked under most circumstances (output shafts locked together). Only when the TBR is reached (i.e., there is a greater torque difference across the output shafts than can be supported by the TBR) do the output shafts turn relative to each other, and the differential unlocks. This characteristic results in a relatively free torque movement between both outputs of the (centre) differential, within the limits of the TBR. Thus the static torque distribution of the T1 Torsen in a centre differential installation, rather than being 50:50, will mirror the weight distribution (both static and dynamic) of the vehicle due to the traction available at either (front:rear) output shaft. In a standard car, this is desirable from the perspective of stability, acceleration and traction, but can be undesirable in terms of handling (understeer). While the standard quattro Torsen T1 with 2.7:1 TBR is more than sufficient in most conditions, Torsen T1 differentials with higher TBRs (4:1) are available and can further limit understeer by supporting a wider torque split. A better solution, however, is to apportion a torque split directly between both output shafts (front &amp; rear) and for this reason Audi has adopted the Type 3 (&quot;T3&quot;) Torsen design in the latest generations of quattro.

===The Torsen type &quot;C&quot; (T3)===
The Torsen T3 centre differential combines a planetary gear set with a Torsen differential in a compact package developed for centre differential installations. Unlike the T1 Torsen where the torque split is a nominal 50:50, in the T3 Torsen the torque split, due to the use of the planetary gear set, is an asymmetric 40:60 front-rear torque split (i.e., when grip is equal on both front and rear axles, 40% of torque is sent to the front axle, and 60% to the rear). As with the T1 Torsen, torque will be distributed dynamically depending on tractive conditions, but with an actual (rather than nominal) static bias. The T3 allows handling characteristics and vehicle dynamics more akin to rear-wheel drive cars. This asymmetric Torsen was first introduced in the highly acclaimed 2006-model (B7) Audi RS4. The Type 3 torsen was used in the Audi S4 and RS4 B7 manual transmissions from 2006 to 2008, as well as the S6, S8, and Q7 models from 2007.

The torque split across axles and between left and right wheels has been achieved through the various evolutions of the quattro system, through a driver-selectable manually locking differential (rear axle only), and eventually through open differentials with Electronic Differential Lock (EDL). EDL is an electronic system, utilising the existing anti-lock braking system (ABS), part of the Electronic Stability Programme (ESP), which brakes just the one spinning wheel on an axle, therefore allowing the transfer of torque across the axle to the wheel which does have traction.

===Crown-wheel centre differential===
Audi debuted a new generation of quattro in the 2010 RS5. The key change is the replacement of the Torsen Type &quot;C&quot; centre differential with an Audi-developed &quot;Crown Gear&quot; differential. Whilst this is superficially the same as a normal open differential, adapted for a centre application, it has some key differences:
# The central carrier and associated spider gears interface directly to two crown wheels connected to the front and rear drive shafts
# The two crown wheels interface to the spider gears at different diameters, and so produce different torque when turned by the spider gears. This is engineered to produce a 40:60 static torque split front and rear.
# Each crown wheel interfaces to the respective output shaft directly, whilst the spider carrier interfaces to each output shaft using a clutch pack which gives the unit the ability to control torque distribution over and above the static torque distribution.

If one axle loses grip, different rotational speeds arise inside the differential which result in an increase in axial forces that force the clutch plates to close. Once closed, the output shaft is locked resulting in the diversion of the majority of the torque to the axle achieving better traction. In the Crown Gear differential up to 85% of torque can flow to the rear, and up to 70% of torque can be diverted to the front axle.

The features of the Crown Gear differential provide the following benefits over the Torsen Type &quot;C&quot;

# The ability to set up a more stable torque distribution, with full locking whereas the Torsen can only provide a torque distribution up to the Torque Bias Ratio; i.e., the Crown Gear differential can lock fully, regardless of bias ratio. Unlike the Torsen, the Crown Gear differential does not operate like a limited slip differential and can operate, fully locked, with no traction on one output shaft.
# Easier integration into control electronics allowing four-wheel electronic torque vectoring with or without the active rear sport differential
# Considerable reduction in size and weight (at 4.8 kg, some 2 kg lighter than the Torsen Type C)

The net result of this advance in quattro is the ability of the vehicle electronics to fully manage the vehicle dynamics in all traction situations, whether in cornering, acceleration or braking or in any combination of these.

===Evolutions===
Audi has never officially debuted quattro in specific generations. Changes to quattro technology have generally been debuted with a specific range or model in the range and then brought into other models during appropriate points in the model cycle.

The exception to the above was the debut of the 2010 RS5 which was, amongst other things, heralded by Audi as the debut of a &quot;new generation of quattro&quot;.

====quattro generation I====

Used from 1981 to 1987 in Audi Quattro turbo coupé, Audi 80 B2 platform (1978–1987, Audi 4000 in North American market), Audi Coupé quattro B2 platform (1984–1988), Audi 100 C3 platform (1983–1987, Audi 5000 in North American market). Also, starting from 1984, used on the Volkswagen VW Passat B2 platform (VW Quantum in the US market) where it was known as &quot;Syncro&quot;.

System type: Permanent four-wheel drive.

Open centre differential, manually lockable via switch on centre console.¹

Open rear differential, manually lockable via switch on centre console.¹

Open front differential, no lock.

¹ABS disabled when locked.

How the system performs: When all differentials are unlocked, the car will not be able to move if one wheel (front or rear) loses traction (is on ice or raised in the air). When the center differential is locked with the rear differential unlocked, the car will not be able to move if one front wheel and one rear wheel lose traction. When the rear differential is locked with the center unlocked, the car will not be able to move if both rears or one front loses traction. When both center and rear differentials are locked, the car will not be able to move if both rears and one front lose traction.

====quattro generation II====
Starting from 1988 on older generation Audi 100 C3 platform and Audi Quattro until the end of their production, and on new generation B3 platform (1989–1992) Audi 80/90 quattro, B4 platform (1992–1995) Audi 80, Audi S2, Audi RS2 Avant, C4 platform (1991–1994) Audi 100 quattro, Audi S4, later C4 platform (1994-1997) Audi A6/S6.

System type: Permanent four-wheel drive.

Torsen centre differential, 50:50 &#x27;default&#x27; split, automatically apportioning up to 75% of torque transfer to either axle.

Open rear differential, manually lockable via switch on centre console located next to handbrake.¹

Open front differential, no lock.

¹ABS disabled when locked, automatically unlocks if speed exceeds .

====quattro generation III====
Used only on the Audi V8 starting from 1988 to 1994.

System type: Permanent four-wheel drive.

V8 with &quot;automatic&quot; transmission:

Planetary gear centre differential with electronically controlled multi-plate locking clutch

Torsen type 1 differential rear.

Open differential front.

V8 with &quot;manual&quot; transmission:

Torsen type 1 centre differential.

Torsen type 1 rear differential.

Open front differential.

How does the system perform: In on-road conditions the car will not be able to move if one front and both rear wheels lose traction altogether.

====quattro generation IV====
Starting from 1995 on Audi A4/S4/RS4 (B5 platform), Audi A6/S6/allroad/RS6, Audi A8/S8 with both manual and automatic transmissions. Also on VW Passat B5, where it was initially referred to as &quot;syncro&quot;, but by the time it reached US soil, it had been re-christened 4motion. Also used on the Volkswagen Phaeton and Volkswagen Group D platform sister vehicles. The Volkswagen Touareg used 4Xmotion with a separate transmission, PTUs and front axles.

The manually locking rear differential from the earlier generations was replaced with a conventional open differential, with Electronic Differential Lock (EDL) (which detects wheelspin via ABS road wheel speed sensors, and applies brakes to one spinning wheel, thus transferring torque via open differential to the opposite wheel which has more traction). EDL works at speeds up to , on all quattro models (on non-quattro models: up to ).

System type: Permanent four-wheel drive.

Torsen type 1 centre differential, 50:50 &#x27;default&#x27; split, automatically apportioning up to 75% of torque transfer to either front or rear axle.

Open rear differential, Electronic Differential Lock (EDL).

Open front differential, Electronic Differential Lock (EDL).

====quattro generation V====
Starting with the B7 Audi RS4 and the manual transmission version of the 2006 B7 Audi S4. It was adopted in the entire S4, S6, and S8 lineup in 2007.

System type: Permanent asymmetric four-wheel drive.

Torsen type 3 (Type &quot;C&quot;) centre differential, 40:60 &#x27;default&#x27; split front-rear, automatically apportioning up to 80% of the torque to one axle using a 4:1 high-biased center differential. With the aid of ESP, up to 100% of the torque can be transferred to one axle.

Open rear differential, Electronic Differential Lock (EDL).

Open front differential, Electronic Differential Lock (EDL).

=====Vectoring quattro system =====
Audi&#x27;s new sport differential, debuted &#x27;torque vectoring&#x27; to quattro generation V. The Audi sport differential allowed the dynamic allocation of torque across the rear axle of the debut vehicle: the B7 (2008) S4, and is now an optional addition to all quattro vehicles, which continue to use the 40:60 asymmetric Torsen (Type &quot;C&quot;) centre differential. The sport differential replaces the normal open rear differential while the front axle still rely on an open differential with EDL.

The torque vectoring rear axle differential is designed and manufactured by Magna Powertrain, and is being offered on Audi A4, A5, A6 and their derivatives (including &quot;RS&quot; models). The &quot;Sport Differential&quot; selectively distributes torque to the rear axle wheels thereby generating a yaw moment, which improves handling and also stabilizes the vehicle when it oversteers or understeers, thereby increasing safety.

The sport differential operates by using two superposition (&quot;step up&quot;) gears at the differential, which are operated via multi-plate clutches each side of the differential crown wheel. When required by the software (using lateral and longitudinal yaw sensors, the ABS wheel sensors, and a steering wheel sensor), the control software (located in a control unit close to the rear differential), actuates the relevant clutch pack. This has the effect of taking the output shaft drive through the step-up gear to the attached wheel, while the other shaft continues to drive its wheel directly (i.e., the clutch pack not actuated). The higher speed output shaft produces increased torque to the wheel, producing a yaw (turning) moment. In normal operation increased torque is delivered to the wheel on the outside of the turn thereby increasing the vehicles turning moment, in other words, its willingness to turn in the direction pointed by the steering wheel.

====quattro generation VI ====
Audi debuted the 6th generation of quattro in the 2010 RS5. The key change in generation VI is the replacement of the Torsen Type &quot;C&quot; centre differential with an Audi-developed &quot;Crown Gear&quot; differential. With the new &quot;Crown Gear&quot; center differential, up to 70% of the torque can be applied to the front wheels while up to 85% can be applied to the rear wheels if necessary. The net result of this advance in quattro is the ability of the vehicle electronics to fully manage the vehicle dynamics in all traction situations, whether in cornering, acceleration, braking, snow or in any combination of these. This system was later adopted by the A7, latest generation of the A6 and A8.

===BorgWarner===
The Audi Q7 (First generation), the platform-mate of the Volkswagen Touareg and Porsche Cayenne, does not use the same underpinnings of either previous model. BorgWarner instead provides the 4WD system for this more off-road appropriate SUV. A Torsen Type 3 (T3) differential is used.

===Ultra===
Audi announced &quot;Audi Quattro with Ultra Technology&quot; in February 2016, it is a front-wheel drive biased system for use on platforms with longitudinally mounted engines.

==Transverse systems==

Since Volkswagen Group&#x27;s first mainstream transverse engined vehicle in 1974, four-wheel drive (4WD) has also been considered for their A-platform family of cars. It was not until the second generation of this platform that 4WD finally appeared on the market. The mid-1980s Mk2 Golf syncro, with its transverse engine and transmission positioning, had most of its torque sent primarily to the front axle.

Attached to the transaxle is a Power Transfer Unit (PTU), which is connected to a rear axle through a propeller shaft. The PTU also feeds torque through itself to the front axle. At the rear axle, torque was first sent through a viscous coupling before reaching the final drive gearset. This coupling contained friction plates and an oil just viscous enough so that pressure affected how many plates were connected and active (and therefore, how much power was being delivered to the rear wheels).

Starting with the Mk4 generation A4-platform, the viscous coupling has been dropped in favour of a Haldex Traction electro-hydraulic limited-slip &quot;coupler&quot; (LSC) or clutch. The Haldex Traction LSC unit is not a differential and therefore cannot perform in the true sense like a differential. A Haldex Traction unit may divert up to a maximum 100% of the torque to the rear axle as conditions warrant. Many people are confused with the torque distribution on Haldex-based systems. Under normal operating conditions the Haldex clutch operates a rate of 5% torque transmission. Under adverse conditions where the car&#x27;s road wheel speed sensors have determined that both front wheels have lost traction, the Haldex clutch can lock at 100% clamping force, meaning all torque is transferred to the rear axle. The torque split between left and right wheels is achieved with a conventional open differential. If one side of the driven axle loses grip, then the Electronic Differential Lock (EDL) component of the ESP controls this. EDL brakes a single spinning wheel; therefore, the torque gets transferred across the axle to the opposite wheel via the open differential. On all transverse engine cars with the Haldex-based four wheel drive system, the EDL only controls front wheels, and not the rear.

The main advantages of the Haldex Traction LSC system over the Torsen-based system include: a slight gain in fuel economy (due to the decoupling of the rear axle when not needed, thereby reducing driveline losses due to friction), and the ability to maintain a short engine bay and larger passenger compartment due to the transverse engine layout. A further advantage of the Haldex, when compared to just front wheel drive variants of the same model, is a more balanced front-rear weight distribution (due to the location of the Haldex center &quot;differential&quot; next to the rear axle).

Disadvantages of the Haldex Traction system include: the vehicle has inherent front-wheel drive handling characteristics (as when engine braking, load is only applied on the front wheels, and due to the reactive nature of the Haldex system and slight lag time in the redistribution of engine power), and the Haldex LSC unit also requires additional maintenance, in the form of an oil and filter change every (whereas the Torsen is generally considered to be maintenance-free). Another important disadvantage of the Haldex system is the requirement for all four tyres to be of identical wear levels (and rolling radii), due to the Haldex requiring data from all four road wheel speed sensors. A final significant disadvantage is the reduction in luggage capacity in the boot (trunk), due to the bulky Haldex LSC unit necessitating a raised boot floor by some three inches.

===Viscous coupling===
This 4WD system was used only on Volkswagen branded vehicles, and was never used on any Audi cars except Audi R8 model.

The aforementioned viscous coupling 4WD system was found in the Mk2 generation of transverse-engined A2-platform vehicles, including the Volkswagen Golf Mk2 and Jetta. It was also found on the Volkswagen Type 2 (T3) (Vanagon in the US), Mk3 generation of Golf and Jetta, third generation of Volkswagen Passat B3 (which was based on a heavily revised A-platform), and the Volkswagen Eurovan.

The Vanagon system was RWD-biased, the engine and transaxle were in the rear, whereas the viscous coupling was found in the front axle near the final drive. This 4WD system was known as &quot;Syncro&quot; on all vehicles.

What: Automatic four wheel drive (on demand).

A viscous coupling installed instead of a centre differential, with freewheel mechanism to disconnect the driven axle when braking.

Open rear differential (mechanical differential lock optional on Vanagon).

Open front differential (mechanical differential lock optional on Vanagon).

Normally a front-wheel drive vehicle (except Vanagon, see above). In normal driving conditions, 95% of torque is transferred to front axle. Because viscous coupling is considered to be &quot;slow&quot; (some time is needed for silicone fluid to warm-up and solidify), 5% of torque is transferred to rear axle at all times to &quot;pre-tension&quot; the viscous coupling and reduce activation time. The coupling locks when slipping occurs and up to near 50% of torque is automatically transferred to rear axle (front in Vanagon). In on-road conditions, the car will not move if one front wheel and one rear wheel lose traction.

The freewheel segment, installed inside the rear differential, lets rear wheels rotate faster than front wheels without locking the viscous coupling and preventing ABS from applying brakes to each wheel independently. Because of the freewheel, torque can be transferred to rear axle only when the vehicle is moving forward. For four-wheel drive to work when reversing, a vacuum-actuated &quot;throttle control element&quot; is installed on the differential case. This device locks the freewheel mechanism when in reverse gear. The freewheel mechanism unlocks when the gear-shift lever is pushed to the right, past the third gear. The freewheel is not unlocked immediately after leaving reverse gear on purpose – this is to prevent the freewheel from cycling from locked to unlocked if the car is stuck and driver is trying to &quot;rock&quot; the car by changing from first to reverse and back.

Disadvantages of this four-wheel drive system are related to actuation time of the viscous coupling.
# When cornering under acceleration on a slippery surface, the rear axle is engaged with delay, causing sudden change in the car&#x27;s behaviour (from understeer to oversteer).
# When starting on a sandy surface, the front wheels can dig into the sand before all-wheel drive is engaged.

===Haldex===
Starting from 1998, the Swedish Haldex Traction LSC unit replaced the viscous coupling. Haldex is used by Audi on the quattro versions of the Audi S1, Audi A3, Audi S3, and the Audi TT. It is also used by Volkswagen in the 4motion versions of the Mk4 and Mk5 generations of Volkswagen Golf, Volkswagen Jetta, and the Golf R32, Volkswagen Sharan, 6th generation VW Passat (also based on the A-platform) and Transporter T5. On the Audis, the trademark holds, and are still referred to as quattro, whereas the Volkswagens receive the 4motion name. The Škoda Octavia 4x4 and SEAT León 4 and SEAT Alhambra 4 also used Haldex LSC, being based on Volkswagen Group models. Curiously, the Bugatti Veyron also utilizes Haldex, though with separate transmission, PTU and front and rear axles.

What: Automatic four wheel drive (on demand).

Haldex Traction LSC multi-plate clutch with ECU electronic control, acting as a pseudo center differential.

Open rear differential, no EDL.

Open front differential, EDL.

How: Normally front-wheel drive vehicle. A Haldex Traction LSC unit may divert up to a maximum 100% of the torque to the rear axle as conditions warrant. Many people find the torque distribution on Haldex Traction systems confusing. Under normal operating conditions, the Haldex LSC clutch operates at 5% (divide 5% between front and rear, and 97.5% torque goes to the front, and 2.5% goes to the rear). Under adverse conditions where both front wheels lose traction, the Haldex clutch can lock at 100% clamping force. This means, that since there is no torque transferred to the front axle, all torque (minus losses) must be transferred to the rear axle. The torque split between left and right wheels is achieved with a conventional open differential. If one side of the driven axle loses grip, then the Electronic Differential Lock (EDL) controls this. EDL brakes a single spinning wheel, and therefore torque gets transferred to the opposite wheel via the open differential. On all transverse-engined cars with the Haldex Traction LSC four-wheel drive system, the EDL only controls the front wheels, and not the rear.

In vehicles equipped with EDL on the front wheels only, the car will not move if both front and one of the rear wheels loses traction.

Again, due to limitations of Electronic Differential Lock (see quattro IV description above), in off-road conditions it is enough for one front and one rear wheel to lose traction and the car will not move.

The Haldex Traction system is more than preventative, in that there must be a difference in slip (or rotational speed) of the two axle systems before the Haldex operates and sends torque to the rear axle. This is not the same as wheel spin, as the system can react in less than the full rotation of any wheel on the vehicle. The Torsen&#x27;s permanent &#x27;full-time&#x27; even torque split under non-slipping conditions makes slipping less likely to start.

The Haldex Electronic Control Unit (ECU) disengages the Haldex clutch in the centre coupling as soon as brakes are applied to allow ABS work properly. When performing tight low-speed turns (e.g. parking) the clutch is disengaged by Electronic Control Unit to avoid &quot;wind-up&quot; in transmission. When Electronic Stability Programs (ESP) are activated the Haldex is disengaged to allow the ESP system to effectively control the vehicle, this applies under acceleration and deceleration conditions.

==Marketing==
As part of Audi&#x27;s celebration of quattro All-Wheel Drive technology, a TV commercial titled &#x27;Ahab&#x27; was produced inspired by the American novel, Moby Dick. The ad debuted in the United States during 2012 NFL division playoffs.

<text>The Norwegian Armed Forces () are the armed forces responsible for the defence of Norway. It consists of five branches, the Norwegian Army, the Royal Norwegian Navy, which includes the Coast Guard, the Royal Norwegian Air Force, the Home Guard, and Norwegian Cyber Defence Force as well as several joint departments.

The military force in peacetime is around 17,185 personnel including military and civilian staff, and around 70,000 in total with the current military personnel, conscripts and the Norwegian Home Guard in full mobilization.

Among European NATO members, the military expenditure of US$7.2 billion is the highest per capita.

==History==

An organised military was first assembled in Norway in the 9th century and its early focus was naval warfare. The army was created in 1628 as part of Denmark–Norway, followed by two centuries of regular wars. A Norwegian military was established in 1814, but the military did not see combat until the German occupation of Norway in 1940. Norway abandoned its position as a neutral country in 1949 to become a founding member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). The Cold War saw a large build-up of air stations and military bases, especially in Northern Norway. Since the 2000s, the military has transformed from a focus on defence from an invasion to a mobile force for international missions.

Norway had its combat units withdraw from the War in Afghanistan in 2021. During the war, Norwegian combat forces had been on loan to ISAF, and later on loan to Resolute Support Mission.

==Organisation==
The formal commander-in-chief is King Harald V; however, the &quot;de facto&quot; supreme decision-making is made by the Cabinet, led by the Prime Minister. The Chief of Defence (a four-star general or admiral) is the professional head and leader of the armed forces, and is the principal military adviser to the Minister of Defence. The Chief of Defence and his staff is located at Akershus Fortress in Oslo, while the Norwegian Joint Headquarters, responsible for commanding operations, is located in Bodø. The main naval base is Haakonsvern in Bergen Municipality, the main army camps are located at Setermoen in Bardu Municipality, Bardufoss in Målselv Municipality, and Rena in Åmot Municipality. The main air station is Ørland Main Air Station in Ørland Municipality.

Military branches (in order of seniority):
*Norwegian Army
*Royal Norwegian Navy
*Royal Norwegian Air Force
*Home Guard
*Norwegian Cyber Defence Force
*Norwegian Special Operation Forces (NORSOF)

Other main structures include:

* Defence Staff Norway (DEFSTNOR) in Oslo acts as the staff of the Chief of Defence. It is headed by a three-star general or admiral. DEFSTNOR assigns priorities, manages resources, provides force generation and support activities. Each of the four branches of defence is headed by a two-star general/admiral who are subordinate to DEFSTNOR.
* Norwegian Joint Headquarters (NJHQ) located at Reitan, close to Bodø has operational control of Norwegian armed forces worldwide 24/7. It is headed by the Supreme Commander Norwegian Forces – a three-star general or admiral.
* Norwegian Defence Logistics Organisation (NDLO) at Kolsås in Bærum Municipality (just outside Oslo) is responsible for engineering, procurement, investment, supply, information and communications technology. It is also responsible for the maintenance, repair and storage of materials.

==Conscription==
Conscription was constitutionally established on 12 April 1907 with &quot;Kongeriket Norges Grunnlov § 119&quot;. 
Norway employs a weak form of mandatory military service for men and women. While 62,873 men and women were called in for the examination of persons liable for military service in 2010 (mandatory for men), 9,631 were conscripted. In practice recruits are not forced to serve, instead only those who are motivated are selected. In earlier times, up until at least the early 2000s, all men aged 19–44 were subject to mandatory service, with good reasons required to avoid becoming drafted.

Since 1985, women have been able to enlist for voluntary service as regular recruits. On 14 June 2013, the Norwegian Parliament voted to extend conscription to women. In 2015 conscription was extended to women making Norway the first NATO member and first European country to make national service compulsory for both men and women. In 2020, women made up one-third of new conscripts.

There is a right of conscientious objection.

Students of professional subjects (doctors, psychologists, pharmacists, dentists, etc.) may serve their conscription after completing a six weeks course, receiving lieutenant ranking when they begin their service. This arrangement is called Conscript Academic Officer (Norwegian: Vernepliktige akademikere (VA)).

In 2020, the media said that &quot;several soldiers said that they were informed about additional four months of service; the information was given after military service had started&quot;.

<doc id="757775" wikidata="Q6149847" url="?curid=757775" title="The Living Bible">
<text>The Living Bible (TLB or LB) is a personal paraphrase, not a translation, of the Bible in English by Kenneth N. Taylor and first published in 1971. Taylor used the American Standard Version of 1901 as his base text. 

&quot;The Way&quot;, an illustrated edition, was published shortly thereafter, in 1972. It additionally included short devotional passages. 

== Origin ==
In a 1979 interview by Harold Myra in an issue of &quot;Christianity Today&quot;, Taylor explained the inspiration for preparing &quot;The Living Bible&quot;:

The children were one of the chief inspirations for producing the Living Bible. Our family devotions were tough going because of the difficulty we had understanding the King James Version, which we were then using, or the Revised Standard Version, which we used later. All too often I would ask questions to be sure the children understood, and they would shrug their shoulders—they didn&#x27;t know what the passage was talking about. So I would explain it. I would paraphrase it for them and give them the thought. It suddenly occurred to me one afternoon that I should write out the reading for that evening thought by thought, rather than doing it on the spot during our devotional time. So I did, and read the chapter to the family that evening with exciting results—they knew the answers to all the questions I asked!

== Reception ==
&quot;The Living Bible&quot; was well received in many Evangelical circles. Youth-oriented Protestant groups such as Youth for Christ and Young Life accepted it readily. In 1962 Billy Graham received a copy of &quot;Living Letters&quot; – a paraphrase of the New Testament epistles and the first portion of what later became &quot;The Living Bible&quot; – while recuperating in a hospital in Hawaii. He was impressed with its easy readability, and he asked for permission to print 50,000 paperback copies of &quot;Living Letters&quot; for use in his evangelistic crusades. Over the next year he distributed 600,000 copies of &quot;Living Letters.&quot;

There is also &quot;The Catholic Living Bible&quot;, which only has an &quot;imprimatur&quot; and &quot;nihil obstat&quot; on the deuterocanonical text starting on page 1369, &quot;deuterocanonical books&quot; and an imprimatur on the Introduction Text. The beginning of this book starts with &quot;Why Read The Bible?&quot; by Pope John Paul II. The Catholic Living Bible does not use the word &quot;paraphrased&quot; on the front cover; but earlier editions may instead place the word on the title page, underneath which is written &quot;A Thought-For-Thought Translation&quot;. The added words &quot;A Thought-For-Thought Translation&quot; in the subtitle of the title page are not unique to Catholic editions, they are also in the later printings of the Protestant editions, even though the Bible is a paraphrase.

&quot;The Living Bible&quot; was a best-seller in the early 1970s, largely due to the accessibility of its modern language, which made passages understandable to those with weak reading skills, or no previous background in Bible study. &quot;The Living Bible&quot; was the best-selling book in the U.S.

From the very beginning of its publication, Taylor had assigned the copyright to Tyndale House Foundation, so all of the royalties from sales of &quot;The Living Bible&quot; were given to charity.

== Criticism ==
Reformed writer Michael Marlowe criticized the edition, saying that it was &quot;the dumbing-down of the Biblical text to a grade-school level&quot; done &quot;in keeping with the linguistic and educational trends of the time.&quot; Marlowe further accused Taylor of &quot;wrest[ing] the scripture so as to conform it to Arminian teachings about salvation.&quot;

== Textual characteristics ==
&quot;The Living Bible&quot; uses modern language, which made passages understandable to those with weak reading skills, or no previous background in Bible study, and lingual contractions such as &quot;don&#x27;t&quot; for &quot;do not&quot;.

In the late 1980s, Taylor and his colleagues at Tyndale House Publishers invited a team of 90 Greek and Hebrew scholars to participate in a project of revising the text of &quot;The Living Bible&quot;. After many years of work, the result was an entirely new translation of the Bible. It was published in 1996 as the &quot;Holy Bible:&quot; New Living Translation (NLT).

==Notable passages==
At 1 Samuel 24:3, The Living Bible has &quot;Saul went into the cave to go to the bathroom&quot;, using a contemporary North American euphemism where the original Hebrew (also a euphemism) literally translates as &quot;to cover his feet&quot;. In the British edition of &quot;The Living Bible&quot;, this wording was changed to &quot;to relieve himself&quot;, which is also found in most other non-literal English translations.

<doc id="757797" wikidata="Q285044" url="?curid=757797" title="Angiotensin II receptor blocker">
<text>Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), formally angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1) antagonists, also known as angiotensin receptor blockers, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, or AT1 receptor antagonists, are a group of pharmaceuticals that bind to and inhibit the angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1) and thereby block the arteriolar contraction and sodium retention effects of renin–angiotensin system.

Their main uses are in the treatment of hypertension (high blood pressure), diabetic nephropathy (kidney damage due to diabetes) and congestive heart failure. They &quot;selectively&quot; block the activation of the AT1 receptor, preventing the binding of angiotensin II compared to ACE inhibitors.

ARBs and the similar-attributed ACE inhibitors are both indicated as the first-line antihypertensives in patients developing hypertension along with left-sided heart failure. However, ARBs appear to produce less adverse effects compared to ACE inhibitors.

==Medical uses==
Angiotensin II receptor blockers are used primarily for the treatment of hypertension where the patient is intolerant of ACE inhibitor therapy primarily because of persistent and/or dry cough. They do not inhibit the breakdown of bradykinin or other kinins, and are thus only rarely associated with the persistent dry cough and/or angioedema that limit ACE inhibitor therapy. More recently, they have been used for the treatment of heart failure in patients intolerant of ACE inhibitor therapy, in particular candesartan. Irbesartan and losartan have trial data showing benefit in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes, and may delay the progression of diabetic nephropathy. A 1998 double-blind study found &quot;that lisinopril improved insulin sensitivity whereas losartan did not affect it.&quot; Candesartan is used experimentally in preventive treatment of migraine. Lisinopril has been found less often effective than candesartan at preventing migraine.

The angiotensin II receptor blockers have differing potencies in relation to blood pressure control, with statistically differing effects at the maximal doses. When used in clinical practice, the particular agent used may vary based on the degree of response required.

Some of these drugs have a uricosuric effect.

Angiotensin II, through AT1 receptor stimulation, is a major stress hormone and, because (ARBs) block these receptors, in addition to their eliciting anti-hypertensive effects, may be considered for the treatment of stress-related disorders.

In 2008, they were reported to have a remarkable negative association with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease (AD). A retrospective analysis of five million patient records with the US Department of Veterans Affairs system found different types of commonly used antihypertensive medications had very different AD outcomes. Those patients taking angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) were 35 to 40% less likely to develop AD than those using other antihypertensives.

A retrospective study of 1968 stroke patients revealed that prestroke treatment with ARB may be associated with both reduced stroke severity and better outcome. This finding agrees with experimental data that suggest that ARB&#x27;s exert a cerebral protective effect.

==Adverse effects==
This class of drugs is usually well tolerated. Common adverse drug reactions (ADRs) include: dizziness, headache, and/or hyperkalemia. Infrequent ADRs associated with therapy include: first dose orthostatic hypotension, rash, diarrhea, dyspepsia, abnormal liver function, muscle cramp, myalgia, back pain, insomnia, decreased hemoglobin levels, renal impairment, pharyngitis, and/or nasal congestion. A 2014 Cochrane systematic review based on randomized controlled trials reported that when comparing patients taking ACE inhibitors to patients taking ARBs, fewer ARB patients withdrew from the study due to adverse events compared to ACE inhibitor patients.

While one of the main rationales for the use of this class is the avoidance of a persistent dry cough and/or angioedema associated with ACE inhibitor therapy, rarely they may still occur. In addition, there is also a small risk of cross-reactivity in patients having experienced angioedema with ACE inhibitor therapy.

===Myocardial infarction===
The issue of whether angiotensin II receptor antagonists slightly increase the risk of myocardial infarction (MI or heart attack) is currently being investigated. Some studies suggest ARBs can increase the risk of MI. However, other studies have found ARBs do not increase the risk of MI. To date, with no consensus on whether ARBs have a tendency to increase the risk of myocardial infarction, further investigations are underway.

Indeed, as a consequence of AT1 blockade, ARBs increase angiotensin II levels several-fold above baseline by uncoupling a negative-feedback loop. Increased levels of circulating angiotensin II result in unopposed stimulation of the AT2 receptors, which are, in addition, upregulated. However, recent data suggest AT2 receptor stimulation may be less beneficial than previously proposed, and may even be harmful under certain circumstances through mediation of growth promotion, fibrosis, and hypertrophy, as well as eliciting proatherogenic and proinflammatory effects.

===Cancer===
A study published in 2010 determined that &quot;...meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials suggests that ARBs are associated with a modestly increased risk of new cancer diagnosis. Given the limited data, it is not possible to draw conclusions about the exact risk of cancer associated with each particular drug. These findings warrant further investigation.&quot; A later meta-analysis by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of 31 randomized controlled trials comparing ARBs to other treatment found no evidence of an increased risk of incident (new) cancer, cancer-related death, breast cancer, lung cancer, or prostate cancer in patients receiving ARBs. In 2013, comparative effectiveness research from the United States Department of Veterans Affairs on the experience of more than a million veterans found no increased risks for either lung cancer or prostate cancer. The researchers concluded: &quot;In this large nationwide cohort of United States Veterans, we found no evidence to support any concern of increased risk of lung cancer among new users of ARBs compared with nonusers. Our findings were consistent with a protective effect of ARBs.&quot;

In May 2013, a senior regulator at the Food &amp; Drug Administration, Medical Team Leader Thomas A. Marciniak, revealed publicly that contrary to the FDA&#x27;s official conclusion that there was no increased cancer risk, after a patient-by-patient examination of the available FDA data he had concluded that there was a lung-cancer risk increase of about 24% in ARB patients, compared with patients taking a placebo or other drugs. One of the criticisms Marciniak made was that the earlier FDA meta-analysis did not count lung carcinomas as cancers. In ten of the eleven studies he examined, Marciniak said that there were more lung cancer cases in the ARB group than the control group. Ellis Unger, chief of the drug-evaluation division that includes Marciniak, was quoted as calling the complaints a &quot;diversion,&quot; and saying in an interview, &quot;We have no reason to tell the public anything new.&quot; In an article about the dispute, the Wall Street Journal interviewed three other doctors to get their views; one had &quot;no doubt&quot; ARBs increased cancer risk, one was concerned and wanted to see more data, and the third thought there was either no relationship or a hard to detect, low-frequency relationship.

A 2016 meta-analysis including 148,334 patients found no significant differences in cancer incidence associated with ARB use.

===Kidney failure===
Although ARBs have protective effects against developing kidney diseases for patients with diabetes and previous hypertension without administration of ARBs, ARBs may worsen kidney functions such as reducing glomerular filtration rate associated with a rise of serum creatinine in patients with pre-existing proteinuria, renal artery stenosis, hypertensive nephrosclerosis, heart failure, polycystic kidney disease, chronic kidney disease, interstitial fibrosis, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, or any conditions such as ARBs-treated but still clinically present hypertension that lead to abnormal narrowing of blood vessels to the kidney that interrupts oxygen and nutrient supply to the organ.

==History==
== Structure ==
Losartan, irbesartan, olmesartan, candesartan, valsartan, fimasartan include the tetrazole group (a ring with four nitrogen and one carbon). Losartan, irbesartan, olmesartan, candesartan, and telmisartan include one or two imidazole groups.

==Mechanism of action==
These substances are AT1-receptor antagonists; that is, they block the activation of angiotensin II AT1 receptors. AT1 receptors are found in smooth muscle cells of vessels, cortical cells of the adrenal gland, and adrenergic nerve synapses. Blockage of AT1 receptors directly causes vasodilation, reduces secretion of vasopressin, and reduces production and secretion of aldosterone, among other actions. The combined effect reduces blood pressure.

The specific efficacy of each ARB within this class depends upon a combination of three pharmacodynamic (PD) and pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters. Efficacy requires three key PD/PK areas at an effective level; the parameters of the three characteristics will need to be compiled into a table similar to one below, eliminating duplications and arriving at consensus values; the latter are at variance now.

===Pressor inhibition===
Pressor inhibition at trough level this relates to the degree of blockade or inhibition of the blood pressure-raising (&quot;pressor&quot;) effect of angiotensin II. However, pressor inhibition is not a measure of blood pressure-lowering (BP) efficacy &quot;per se&quot;. The rates as listed in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Package Inserts (PIs) for inhibition of this effect at the 24th hour for the ARBs are as follows:
* Valsartan 30% at 80 mg
* Telmisartan 40% at 80 mg
* Losartan 25–40% at 100 mg
* Irbesartan 40% at 150 mg; 60% 300 mg
* Azilsartan 60% at 32 mg
* Olmesartan 61% at 20 mg; 74% at 40 mg

===AT1 affinity vs AT2===

The ratios of AT1 to AT2 in binding affinities of the specific ARBs are shown as follows. However, AT1 affinity vs AT2 is not a meaningful indicator of blood pressure response.
* Losartan 1000-fold
* Telmisartan 3000-fold
* Irbesartan 8500-fold
* Candesartan greater than 10000-fold
* Olmesartan 12500-fold
* Valsartan 30000-fold
* Saprisartan – ???

===Binding affinities Ki===

===Component===

Nearly all ARBs contain biphenyltetrazole moiety except telmisartan and eprosartan.

===Active agent===

Losartan carries a heterocycle imidazole while valsartan carries a nonplanar acylated amino acid.

== Inhibition of Angiotensin II Type 1 Receptor ==

In one report, to determine the structure and binding mode of AT1R blockers a small molecule antagonist (ZD7155) was used. This antihypertensive compound is a precursor to the drug candesartan, and as such, possess a biphenyl-tetrazole moiety similar to other AT1R blockers. ZD7155 was shown to make several key interactions within the active sight, revealing the binding mode of AT1R blockers.

Through X-Ray Crystallography, one studied showed that there are three key side chains involved in the inhibition of AT1R. Arg167, Trp84, and Tyr35 were shown to interact with AT1R blocker compounds through ionic bonding, hydrogen bonding, and π-π interactions within the active site of AT1R. Then through competitive inhibition these antihypertensive compounds render the AT1R inactive and therefore produce the intended therapeutic effects.

==Pharmacokinetics comparison==


==Research==
===Longevity===
Knockout of the Agtr1a gene that encodes AT1 results in marked prolongation of the life-span of mice, by 26% compared to controls. The likely mechanism is reduction of oxidative damage (especially to mitochondria) and overexpression of renal prosurvival genes. The ARBs seem to have the same effect.

===Fibrosis regression===
ARBs, such as losartan, have been shown to curb or reduce muscular, liver, cardiac, and kidney fibrosis.

===Dilated aortic root regression===
A 2003 study using candesartan and valsartan demonstrated an ability to regress dilated aortic root size.

==Impurities==
===Nitrosamines===
In June 2018, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) found traces of NDMA and NDEA impurities in the angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) drug products valsartan, losartan, and irbesartan. The FDA stated &quot;In June 2018, FDA was informed of the presence of an impurity, identified as N-Nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), from one API producer. Since then, FDA has determined that other types of nitrosamine compounds, e.g., N-Nitrosodiethylamine (NDEA), are present at unacceptable levels in APIs from multiple API producers of valsartan and other drugs in the ARB class.&quot; In 2018, the FDA issued guidance to the industry on how to assess and control the impurities.

In August 2020, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) provided guidance to marketing authorization holders on how to avoid the presence of nitrosamine impurities in human medicines and asked them to review all chemical and biological human medicines for the possible presence of nitrosamines and to test the products at risk.

In November 2020, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the EMA aligned recommendations for limiting nitrosamine impurities in sartan medicines with recommendations it issued for other classes of medicines. The main change concerns the limits for nitrosamines, which previously applied to the active ingredients but now apply instead to the finished products (e.g. tablets). These limits, based on internationally agreed standards (ICH M7(R1)), should ensure that the excess risk of cancer from nitrosamines in any sartan medicines is below 1 in 100,000 for a person taking the medicine for lifelong treatment.

These sartan medicines have a specific ring structure (tetrazole) whose synthesis could potentially lead to the formation of nitrosamine impurities. Other sartan medicines which do not have this ring, such as azilsartan, eprosartan and telmisartan, were not included in this review but are covered by the subsequent review of other medicines.

The FDA issued revised guidelines about nitrosamine impurities in September 2024.

===Azides===

In April 2021, the European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines (EDQM) warned of the risk of contamination with non-nitrosamine impurities (specifically, azido compounds) in tetrazole-containing sartans. In September 2021, the EDQM announced that investigations had revealed a novel azido contaminant which occurs only in losartan (losartan azide or losartan azido impurity) and which was found to be mutagenic on Ames testing.

Later in 2021 and 2022, several cases of contamination with azido impurities were detected in losartan, irbesartan, and valsartan, prompting regulatory responses ranging from investigation to market withdrawals and precautionary recalls in Australia, Brazil, and Europe (including Switzerland).

Teva Pharmaceuticals announced that it would change its losartan manufacturing process to prevent future contamination with these impurities, and the Indian API manufacturer IOL Chemicals and Pharmaceuticals applied for a patent on a new synthesis of losartan designed to be free of azido contaminants.

<doc id="757798" wikidata="Q4866604" url="?curid=757798" title="Baseball color line">
<text>The color line, also known as the color barrier, in American baseball excluded players of black African descent from Major League Baseball and its affiliated Minor Leagues until 1947 (with a few notable exceptions in the 19th century before the line was firmly established). Racial segregation in professional baseball was sometimes called a gentlemen&#x27;s agreement, meaning a tacit understanding, as there was no written policy at the highest level of organized baseball, the major leagues. A high minor league&#x27;s vote in 1887 against allowing new contracts with black players within its league sent a powerful signal that eventually led to the disappearance of blacks from the sport&#x27;s other minor leagues later that century, including the low minors. After the line was in virtually full effect in the early 20th century, many black baseball clubs were established, especially during the 1920s to 1940s when there were several Negro leagues. During this period, American Indians and native Hawaiians, including Prince Oana, were able to play in the Major Leagues.
The color line was broken for good when Jackie Robinson signed with the Brooklyn Dodgers organization for the 1946 season. In 1947, both Robinson in the National League and Larry Doby with the American League&#x27;s Cleveland Indians appeared in games for their teams.

==Origins==
During the 1860s Civil War, baseball rose to prominence as a way to bring soldiers from various regions of the country together. In the aftermath of the war, baseball became a tool for national reconciliation; due to the racial issues involved in the war, baseball&#x27;s unifying potential was mainly pursued among white Americans.

Formal beginning of segregation followed the baseball season of 1867. On October 16, the Pennsylvania State Convention of Baseball in Harrisburg denied admission to the &quot;colored&quot; Pythian Baseball Club.
Major League Baseball&#x27;s National League, founded in 1876, had no black players in the 19th century, except for a recently discovered one, William Edward White, who played in a single game in 1879 and who apparently passed as white. The National League and the other main major league of the day, the American Association, had no written rules against having black players. In 1884, the American Association had two black players, Moses Fleetwood Walker and, for a few months of the season, his brother Weldy Walker, both of whom played for the Toledo Blue Stockings.
The year before, in 1883, prominent National League player Cap Anson had threatened to have his Chicago team sit out an exhibition game at then-minor league Toledo if Toledo&#x27;s Fleetwood Walker played. Anson backed down, but not before uttering the word &quot;nigger&quot; on the field and vowing that his team would not play in such a game again.
In 1884, the Chicago club made a successful threat months in advance of another exhibition game at Toledo, to have Fleet Walker sit out. In 1887, Anson made a successful threat by telegram before an exhibition game against the Newark Little Giants of the International League that it must not play its two black players, Fleet Walker and pitcher George Stovey.
The influence of players such as Anson and the general racism in society led to segregation efforts in professional baseball. On July 14, 1887, the high-minor International League voted to ban the signing of new contracts with black players. By a 6-to-4 vote, the league&#x27;s entirely white teams voted in favor and those with at least one black player voted in the negative. The Binghamton (New York) team, which had just released its two black players, voted with the majority.
Right after the vote, the sports weekly &quot;Sporting Life&quot; stated, &quot;Several representatives declared that many of the best players in the league are anxious to leave on account of the colored element, and the board finally directed Secretary [C.D.] White to approve of no more contracts with colored men.&quot;
On the afternoon of the International League vote, Anson&#x27;s Chicago team played the game in Newark alluded to above, with Stovey and the apparently injured Walker sitting out. Anson biographer Howard W. Rosenberg, concluded that, &quot;A fairer argument is that rather than being an architect [of segregation in professional baseball, as the late baseball racism historian Jules Tygiel termed Anson in his 1983 &quot;Baseball&#x27;s Great Experiment: Jackie Robinson and His Legacy&quot;], that he was a reinforcer of it, including in the National League – and that he had no demonstrable influence on changing the course of events apart from his team&#x27;s exhibition-game schedule.&quot; The year 1887 was also the high point of achievement of black players in the high minor leagues, and each National League team that year except for Chicago played exhibition games against teams with black players, including against Newark and other International League teams.
Some of Anson&#x27;s notoriety stems from a 1907 book on early black players in baseball by black minor league player and later black semi-professional team manager Sol White, who was elected to the Hall of Fame in 2006. White claimed that, &quot;Were it not for this same man Anson, there would have been a colored player in the National League in 1887.&quot;

After the 1887 season, the International League retained just two black players for the 1888 season, both of whom were under contracts signed before the 1887 vote, Frank Grant of the Buffalo Bisons and Moses Fleetwood Walker of the Syracuse franchise, with Walker staying in the league for most of 1889.
In September 1887, eight members of the St. Louis Browns of the then-major American Association (who would ultimately change their nickname to the current St. Louis Cardinals) staged a mutiny during a road trip, refusing to play a game against the New York Cuban Giants, the first all-black professional baseball club, and citing both racial and practical reasons: that the players were banged up and wanted to rest so as to not lose their hold on first place. At the time, the St. Louis team was in Philadelphia, and a story that ran in the &quot;Philadelphia Times&quot; stated that &quot;for the first time in the history of base ball the color line has been drawn.&quot;
Black players were gone from the high minors after 1889 and a trickle of them were left in the minor leagues within a decade. Besides White&#x27;s single game in 1879, the only black players in major league baseball for around 75 years were Fleet Walker and his brother Weldy, both in 1884 with Toledo.
A big change would take place starting in 1946, when Jackie Robinson played for the Montreal Royals in the International League.

==Covert efforts at integration==

While professional baseball was formally regarded as a strictly white-men-only affair, the racial color bar was directed against black players exclusively. Other races were allowed to play in professional white baseball. One prominent example was Charles Albert Bender, a star pitcher for the Philadelphia Athletics in 1910. Bender was the son of a Chippewa mother and a German father and had the inevitable nickname &quot;Chief&quot; from the white players.
As a result of this exclusive treatment of black players, deceptive tactics were used by managers to sign such players. This included several attempts, with the player&#x27;s acquiescence, to sign players who they knew full well were black as if they were American Indian, despite the ban. In 1901, John McGraw, manager of the Baltimore Orioles, tried to add Charlie Grant to the roster as his second baseman. He tried to get around the Gentleman&#x27;s Agreement by trying to pass him as a Cherokee named Charlie Tokohama. Grant went along with the charade. However, his tryout in Chicago was attended by his black friends, giving him away, and he never got an opportunity to play ball in the Major League.
On May 28, 1916, Canadian-American Jimmy Claxton temporarily broke the professional baseball color barrier when he played two games for the Oakland Oaks of the Pacific Coast League. Claxton was introduced to the team owner by a part-American Indian friend as a fellow member of an Oklahoma tribe. The Zee-Nut candy company rushed out a baseball card for Claxton. However, within a week, a friend of Claxton revealed that he had both Negro and Indigenous Canadian ancestors, and Claxton was promptly fired. It would be nearly thirty more years before another black man, at least one known to be black, played organized white baseball.
There possibly were attempts to have people of African descent be signed as Hispanics. One possible attempt may have occurred in 1911 when the Cincinnati Reds signed two light-skinned players from Cuba, Armando Marsans and Rafael Almeida. Both of them had played &quot;Negro Baseball&quot;, barnstorming as members of the integrated All Cubans. When questions arose about them playing the white man&#x27;s game, the Cincinnati managers assured the public that &quot;they were as pure white as Castile soap&quot;.
Regarding the signing of the Cubans, the black newspaper &quot;New York Age&quot; said, &quot;Now that the first shock is over, it will not be surprising to see a Cuban a few shades darker breaking into the professional ranks. It would then be easier for colored players who are citizens of this country to get into fast company.&quot;

==Negro leagues==
The Negro National League was founded in by Rube Foster, independent of the National Baseball Commission (1903–1920). The NNL survived through 1931, primarily in the midwest, accompanied by the major Eastern Colored League for several seasons to 1928. &quot;National&quot; and &quot;American&quot; Negro leagues were established in 1933 and 1937 which persisted until integration. The Negro Southern League operated consecutively from 1920, usually at a lower level. None of them, nor any integrated teams, were members of Organized Baseball, the system led by Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis from 1921. Rather, until professional baseball in the United States was played in two racially segregated league systems, one on each side of the so-called color line. Much of that time there were two high-level &quot;Negro major leagues&quot; with a championship playoff or all-star game, as between the white major leagues.

===Bill Veeck===

The only serious attempt to break the color line during Landis&#x27;s tenure came in , when Bill Veeck tried to buy the then-moribund Philadelphia Phillies and stock them with Negro league stars. However, when Landis got wind of his plans, he and National League president Ford Frick scuttled it in favor of another bid by William D. Cox.
In his 1962 autobiography, &quot;Veeck, as in Wreck&quot;, in which he discussed his abortive attempt to buy the Phillies, Veeck also stated that he wanted to hire black players for the simple reason that in his opinion the best black athletes &quot;can run faster and jump higher&quot; than the best white athletes.
The authors of an article in the 1998 issue of SABR&#x27;s &quot;The National Pastime&quot; argued that Veeck invented the story of buying the Phillies, claiming Philadelphia&#x27;s black press made no mention of a prospective sale to Veeck. The article was strongly challenged by the historian Jules Tygiel, who refuted it point-by-point in an article in the 2006 issue of SABR&#x27;s &quot;The Baseball Research Journal&quot;, and in an appendix, entitled &quot;Did Bill Veeck Lie About His Plan to Purchase the &#x27;43 Phillies?&quot;, published in Paul Dickson&#x27;s 2012 biography, &quot;Bill Veeck: Baseball&#x27;s Greatest Maverick&quot;. Joseph Thomas Moore wrote in his 1988 biography of Doby, &quot;Bill Veeck planned to buy the Philadelphia Phillies with the as yet unannounced intention of breaking that color line.&quot; The Phillies ended up being the last National League team, and third-last team in the majors, to integrate, with John Kennedy debuting for the Phillies in 1957, 15 years after Veeck&#x27;s attempted purchase.

===Branch Rickey===

In 1945, Branch Rickey, general manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers, was anticipating the integration of black players into Major League Baseball. Rickey, along with Gus Greenlee who was the owner of the original Pittsburgh Crawfords, created the United States League (USL) as a method to scout black players specifically to break the color line. It is unclear if the league actually played the 1945 season or if it was only used as a pretense for integration.

=== Sam Nahem ===
During the Second World War, President Roosevelt had the American military establish a formal baseball organization for the soldiers in order to boost morale and eventually in order to help reintroduce the soldiers back into regular civilian life. After the unconditional surrender of the Germans to the Allied Powers in May 1945, the American military expanded their baseball organization to the European Theater of Operations (ETO) with over 200,000 American soldiers participating; among the soldiers who participated were former and current Major League Baseball and Negro league baseball players. Until 1945, black soldiers were forced to play on all-black teams. While stationed overseas in Rheims, France, Sam Nahem, who had MLB experience, was assigned to oversee and manage two baseball leagues in France as well as player-manage his own team: the Overseas Invasion Service Expedition All-Stars (OISE All-Stars). In a shocking decision–by the discriminatory social standards of the time–Nahem insisted on integrating black ballplayers into the All-Stars, recruiting Willard Brown and Leon Day. When Nahem was later asked about this decision and it potentially causing issues for his team he insisted, “[t]here was no problem. I made sure there would be nothing of that sort on my team.” Nahem, who had been heavily discriminated against for his Jewish ancestry and faith, was heavily sympathetic towards black individuals who were experiencing similar treatment. One of the many origins of the Civil rights movement and other efforts at integration in America stemmed from the treatment black veterans received at home versus overseas as well as the juxtaposition of fighting for democracy in Europe while segregation still existed in the United States.

== Media influencers ==

=== Lester Rodney ===
As a writer for the &quot;Daily Worker&quot;, Lester Rodney utilized his role in the media to help integrate Major League Baseball by pressuring the establishment. By the late 1930s, MLB managers including Burleigh Grimes had already admitted to sportswriters at the &quot;Daily Worker&quot; that black ballplayers were of, &quot;Big League Quality,&quot; but no one wanted to put their career in jeopardy by allowing that statement on an official record. Despite general support of this sentiment from many other managers and players like Bill McKechnie, Doc Prothro, Leo Durocher, Ray Blades, Casey Stengel, Pie Traynor, Gabby Hartnett, Ernie Lombardi, Mel Ott, Carl Hubbell, Johnny Vander Meer, Bucky Walters, Al Simmons, Hans Wagner, Paul Waner, Lloyd Waner, Arky Vaughan, Augie Galan, Dizzy Dean, Paul Dean (baseball), and Pepper Martin, all of them went along with the MLB’s official position that baseball would be integrated once the fans were ready. Rodney rejected this notion, explaining in a &quot;Daily Worker&quot; column from July 23, 1939 that the attempt to blame white players and fans was a preposterous excuse which is easily disproven by the large fan turnouts for exhibition games between major-league and Negro League all-star teams. Although his contributions to the breaking of the color line were downplayed at the time due to his communist ties, fellow sportswriting activists such as Wendell Smith (sportswriter) commended Rodney&#x27;s efforts at integrating the sport, reportedly writing to Rodney: &quot;I take this opportunity to congratulate you and the &quot;Daily Worker&quot; for the way you have joined with us on the current series concerning Negro players in the major leagues, as well as all your past great efforts in this respect...I wish you the best of luck and admire you and your liberal attitude.&quot;

=== Paul Robeson ===
A former athlete himself, Paul Robeson was an American political activist who advocated for desegregation in all aspects of American life, including but not limited to the integration of Major League Baseball. Robeson was a part of the December 1943 meeting with MLB Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis to appeal for the breaking of the color line in professional baseball. He publicly argued that the single greatest burden that the United States carried was its policy of racial discrimination. Despite his staunch support for integration, Robeson faced huge criticism from many of his peers for holding communist sympathies. Jackie Robinson was one large critic of Robeson’s political ties and played a significant role in his exit from the public eye. Bill Mardo, a writer for the &quot;Daily Worker&quot; and activist who helped integrate professional baseball, reportedly admonished Robinson for his lack of gratitude towards Robeson&#x27;s efforts to break the color line and concluded at the time that the Brooklyn Dodger&#x27;s, &quot;memory is short indeed.&quot;

==Jackie Robinson and Larry Doby==

The color line was breached when Rickey, with the support of new commissioner Happy Chandler, signed Jackie Robinson in October , intending him to play for the Dodgers. Chandler mentioned that &quot;If a Black boy can make it on Okinawa and Guadalcanal [in fighting World War II], hell, he can make it in baseball.&quot;
After a year in the minor leagues with the Dodgers&#x27; top minor-league affiliate, the Montreal Royals of the International League, Robinson was called up to the Dodgers in . He endured epithets and death threats and got off to a slow start. However, his athleticism and skill earned him the first ever Rookie of the Year award, which is now named in his honor.
In 1947, Larry Doby signed with Bill Veeck&#x27;s Cleveland Indians to become the American League&#x27;s first black player. Doby, a more low-key figure than Robinson, suffered many of the same indignities that Robinson did, albeit with less press coverage. As baseball historian Daniel Okrent wrote, &quot;Robinson had a two year drum roll, Doby just showed up.&quot; Both men were ultimately elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame on the merits of their play. Willard Brown played briefly in 1947 for the St. Louis Browns and was the first black player to hit a home run in the American League. He too was elected to the Hall of Fame based on his career in the Negro leagues.
Prior to the integration of the major leagues, the Brooklyn Dodgers led the integration of the minor leagues. Jackie Robinson and Johnny Wright were assigned to Montreal, but also that season Don Newcombe and Roy Campanella became members of the Nashua Dodgers in the class-B New England League. Nashua was the first minor-league team based in the United States to integrate its roster after . Subsequently, that season, the Pawtucket Slaters, the Boston Braves&#x27; New England League franchise, also integrated its roster, as did Brooklyn&#x27;s class-C franchise in Trois-Rivières, Quebec. With one exception, the rest of the minor leagues would slowly integrate as well, including those based in the southern United States. The Carolina League, for example, integrated in when the Danville Leafs signed Percy Miller Jr. to their team.

The exception was the Class AA Southern Association. Founded in 1901 and based in the Deep South, it allowed only one black player, Nat Peeples of the 1954 Atlanta Crackers, a brief appearance in the league. Peeples went hitless in two games played and four at bats on April 9–10, 1954, was demoted one classification to the Jacksonville Braves of the Sally League, and the SA reverted to white-only status. As a result, its major-league parent clubs were forced to field all-white teams during the 1950s. By the end of the 1950s, the SA also was boycotted by civil rights leaders. The Association finally ceased operation after the 1961 season, still a bastion of segregation. Its member teams joined the International, Sally, and Texas leagues, which were all racially integrated.

==Resistance by the Boston Red Sox==

The Boston Red Sox were the last major league team to integrate, holding out until 1959, a few months after the Detroit Tigers. This was due to the steadfast resistance provided by team owner Tom Yawkey. In April 1945, the Red Sox refused to consider signing Jackie Robinson (and future Boston Braves outfielder Sam Jethroe) after giving him a brief tryout at Fenway Park. The tryout, however, was a farce chiefly designed to assuage the desegregationist sensibilities of Boston City Councilman Isadore H. Y. Muchnick, who threatened to revoke the team&#x27;s exemption from Sunday blue laws. Even with the stands limited to management, Robinson was subjected to racial epithets. Robinson left the tryout humiliated. Robinson would later call Yawkey &quot;one of the most bigoted guys in baseball&quot;.
On April 7, 1959, during spring training, Yawkey and general manager Bucky Harris were named in a lawsuit charging them with discrimination and the deliberate barring of black players from the Red Sox. The NAACP issued charges of &quot;following an anti-Negro policy&quot;, and the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination announced a public hearing on racial bias against the Red Sox. Thus, the Red Sox were forced to integrate, becoming the last pre-expansion major-league team to do so when Harris promoted Pumpsie Green from Boston&#x27;s AAA farm club. On July 21, Green debuted for the team as a pinch runner, and would be joined later that season by Earl Wilson, the second black player to play for the Red Sox. In the early to mid 1960s, the team added other players of color to their roster including Joe Foy, José Tartabull, George Scott, George Smith, John Wyatt, Elston Howard and Reggie Smith. The 1967 Red Sox went on to win the &quot;Impossible Dream&quot; pennant but lost to the St. Louis Cardinals in seven games in that year&#x27;s World Series.
Tom Yawkey died in 1976, and his widow Jean Yawkey eventually sold the team to Haywood Sullivan and Edward &quot;Buddy&quot; LeRoux. As chief executive, Haywood Sullivan found himself in another racism controversy that ended in a courtroom. The Elks Club of Winter Haven, Florida, the Red Sox spring training home, did not permit black members or guests. Yet the Red Sox allowed the Elks into their clubhouse to distribute dinner invitations to the team&#x27;s white players, coaches, and business management. When Tommy Harper, a popular black former player and coach for Boston, then working as a minor league instructor, protested the policy and a story appeared in &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;, he was promptly fired. Harper sued the Red Sox for racial discrimination and his complaint was upheld on July 1, 1986.

 A case has been made for Ernie Banks as the de facto first black manager in the major leagues. On May 8, 1973, Chicago Cubs manager Whitey Lockman was ejected from a 12-inning game against the San Diego Padres. Coach Banks filled in as manager for the final two innings of the 3–2 Cubs win. Prior to the next season, the &quot;Official Baseball Guide&quot; published by &quot;The Sporting News&quot; stated, &quot;he [Banks] became the major leagues&#x27; first black manager—but only for a day&quot;. The other two regular coaches on the team (Pete Reiser and Larry Jansen) were absent that day, opening this door for Banks for the one occasion, but Banks never became a manager on a permanent basis.

<text>Irbesartan, sold under the brand name Aprovel among others, is a medication used to treat high blood pressure, heart failure, and diabetic kidney disease. It is a reasonable initial treatment for high blood pressure. It is taken by mouth. Versions are available as the combination irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide.
Common side effects include dizziness, diarrhea, feeling tired, muscle pain, and heartburn. Serious side effects may include kidney problems, low blood pressure, and angioedema. Use in pregnancy may harm the baby and use when breastfeeding is not recommended. It is an angiotensin II receptor antagonist and works by blocking the effects of angiotensin II.
Irbesartan was patented in 1990, and approved for medical use in 1997. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 200th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 2million prescriptions.

==Medical uses==
Irbesartan is used for the treatment of hypertension. It may also delay progression of diabetic nephropathy and is also indicated for the reduction of renal disease progression in patients with type 2 diabetes, hypertension and microalbuminuria (&gt;30 mg/24 h) or proteinuria (&gt;900 mg/24 h).

===Combination with diuretic===
Irbesartan is also available in a fixed-dose combination formulation with hydrochlorothiazide, a thiazide diuretic, to achieve an additive antihypertensive effect.

== Society and culture ==
=== Brand names ===
It was developed by Sanofi Research (part of Sanofi-Aventis). It is jointly marketed by Sanofi-Aventis and Bristol-Myers Squibb under the brand names Aprovel, Karvea, and Avapro.

===Recalls===

In 2018, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reported that some versions of the angiotensin II receptor blocker medicines (including valsartan, losartan, irbesartan and other &quot;-sartan&quot; drugs) contain nitrosamine impurities. Health Canada also reported nitrosamine impurities.

The FDA issued revised guidelines about nitrosamine impurities in September 2024.

<text>John Wells (born 12 May 1963) is a former captain and coach of Leicester Tigers rugby union team and presently defence coach for Rugby Colorno in Italy; he has previously been forwards coach for and head coach for Newcastle Falcons.

==Career==

Wells was born in Driffield, Yorkshire. He attended Magnus Grammar School and Loughborough University, where he studied sports science and recreation management.

Playing at blindside flanker, he played for England U-16, U-18, Students, U-23 and England &#x27;A&#x27;. He was not capped for England, though he did play in a non-cap international against Italy in Rovigo in 1990.

Wells made his debut for Leicester Tigers in 1982 away against Harlequins, and he went on to play for them over 360 times, captaining the side from 1991 to 1993. He is particularly noted for playing in a back row with England internationals Dean Richards at number eight and Neil Back at openside.

After Director of Rugby Bob Dwyer was sacked, Wells was appointed Leicester&#x27;s forwards&#x27; coach, and deputy to Dean Richards. When Richards was sacked in 2004 after a poor run of results, Wells took over as head coach. He retained this role until the end of the 2004/2005 season, when he left to take up a coaching role at the National Academy.

In 2006 he was appointed as England forwards&#x27; coach to assist then head coach Andy Robinson, alongside attack coach Brian Ashton and defence coach Mike Ford. He remained in this position after first Brian Ashton and then Martin Johnson took charge of the team.

In 2012 Wells joined Newcastle Falcons on a short term contract until the end of the season, taking a permanent role as forwards coach under new Director of Rugby Dean Richards that summer. He was promoted to head coach in the summer of 2014.

In April 2020 Wells moved to Rugby Colorno in Italy to become their defence coach, finishing this role recently.

<text>Rukn al-Dīn Mesud Klada ibn Kilij Arslan or Mesud I (Modern or &quot;Masud&quot; () was the sultan of the Sultanate of Rûm from 1116 until his death in 1156.

==Reign==
Following the defeat and death of his father Kilij Arslan fighting against Ridwan of Aleppo at the battle of Khabur river in 1107, Mesud lost the throne in favor of his brother Malik Shah. With the help of the Danishmends, Mesud captured Konya and defeated Malik Shah in 1116, later blinding and eventually murdering him. Mesud would later turn on the Danishmends and he conquer some of their lands. In 1130, he started construction of the Alâeddin Mosque in Konya, which was later completed in 1221.

In 1146, Mesud successfully fended off a Byzantine attack on his capital and toward the end of his reign, fought against the armies of the Second Crusade, one led by Emperor Conrad III of Germany and the other led by King Louis VII of France. Mesud defeated both of them; the first at the battle of Dorylaeum near modern Eskişehir in 1147 and the second army in Laodicea near modern Denizli in 1148.

Emperor Manuel I Komnenos persuaded Mesud I to attack Thoros II and demand his submission to the Sultan&#x27;s suzerainty. However, the ensuing Seljuk attack, which in fact was provoked by an Armenian raid into Seljuk lands in Cappadocia in the winter of 1154, was routed successfully by Thoros in collaboration with a contingent of the Knights Templar.


When he died, Mesud was succeeded by his son Kilij Arslan II.

Kamero, one of Mesud&#x27;s daughters married John Tzelepes Komnenos, a member of the royal house of Komnenos who had converted to Islam.

<text>Otto Hofmann (16 March 1896 – 31 December 1982) was a German SS-&quot;Obergruppenführer&quot; in Nazi Germany who was the head of the SS Race and Settlement Main Office. He participated in the January 1942 Wannsee Conference, at which the genocidal Final Solution to the Jewish Question was planned. Sentenced to 25 years in prison at the RuSHA Trial in March 1948 for war crimes and crimes against humanity, Hofmann was released in April 1954.

== Early life ==
Hofmann was born in Innsbruck, Tyrol, the son of a merchant. After he moved to Bavaria at age eight, he was educated in the &quot;Volksschule&quot; and the Theresien-&quot;Gymnasium&quot; in Munich but did not complete his studies. At the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914, he volunteered for service with the Royal Bavarian Army at Landsberg am Lech and, from January 1915, saw front-line service with Reserve Field Artillery Regiment 8. In March 1917, he was promoted to &quot;Leutnant&quot; and was assigned as an observer and a liaison officer to an Austro-Hungarian fighter unit. On 20 June 1917, he was shot down over Romania and taken prisoner by the Russians. However, he escaped from captivity after five weeks and returned to the German lines. He completed basic pilot training and was assigned to a reserve pilot unit before he was discharged in March 1919, having earned the Iron Cross, 1st and 2nd class and the Military Merit Order of Bavaria 3rd and 4th class with Swords.

Hofmann saw short-term service as an artilleryman in a &quot;Freikorps&quot; unit at the Bavarian-Czech border between April and October 1919. Married since July 1918, he entered civilian life in 1920 as a salesman in his father-in-law&#x27;s wholesale wine business at Nuremberg. In 1925, after divorcing his wife, he started his own business as an independent representative for several large wine companies from Germany and abroad. In April 1923, Hofmann became an early member of the Nazi Party, which was soon banned in the wake of the Beer Hall Putsch. After the Party was refounded in early 1925, Hofmann did not rejoin until 1 August 1929 (membership number 145,729). However, as an &quot;Alter Kampfer&quot;, he later would be awarded the Golden Party Badge.

On 1 April 1931, Hofmann joined the SS (member number: 7,646). By December, he had been commissioned as an officer and placed in charge of the motorized unit of SS-&quot;Standarte&quot; 3 in Nuremberg. In September of 1932, he advanced to head all the motorized units of SS-&quot;Abschnitt&quot; (District) IX, also in Nuremberg. Shortly after the Nazi seizure of power, he left his wine business in April 1933 when he became a full-time SS functionary, attached to SS-&quot;Gruppe Süd&quot; in Munich as adjutant to the chief of the auxiliary political police. He remained in that post until becoming the chief-of-staff of SS-&quot;Oberabschnitt&quot; (Main District) &quot;Nordwest&quot;, headquartered in Hamburg. On 15 March 1934, he received his own command as &quot;Führer&quot; of SS-&quot;Standarte&quot; 21 in Magdeburg followed by a return to Hamburg as commander of SS-&quot;Standarte&quot; 28 on 2 April 1935. This was quickly followed by promotion to head SS-&quot;Abschnitt&quot; XV in Hamburg from 25 May 1935 to 1 January 1937. During this time, he also unsuccessfully sought to secure a slot for the 29 March 1936 election to the &quot;Reichstag&quot;. He would again fail in his bid to become a &quot;Reichstag&quot; deputy in the election of 10 April 1938.

=== SS Race and Settlement Main Office ===
On 1 January 1937, Hofmann was assigned to the SS Race and Settlement Main Office (RuSHA), becoming its training officer for SS-&quot;Oberabschnitt West&quot; in Düsseldorf. The RuSHA was the section that safeguarded the &quot;racial purity&quot; of the SS by researching the genealogy of SS recruits. On 2 February 1939, Hofmann became head of the Ancestry Office (&quot;Sippenamt&quot;) in RuSHA headquarters in Berlin. In this position, he headed the unit that conducted the investigations into the racial background of SS applicants, as well as of the prospective spouses of SS members prior to granting approvals for marriage. On 17 July, he was made deputy to the RuSHA Chief, SS-&quot;Obergruppenführer&quot; Günther Pancke and, after the outbreak of the Second World War on 1 September, he virtually ran the entire organization due to Pancke being occupied with duties in Poland. On 16 December, Hofmann also took control as head of the RuSHA Race Office (&quot;Rassenamt&quot;). He was named Pancke&#x27;s successor as RuSHA Chief on 9 July 1940, and was appointed to hold the post &quot;for the duration of the war&quot;. Hofmann also assumed the co-editorship of the journal &quot;Der Biologe&quot; (The Biologist), the chief publication of the Reich Biology League.

=== Germanisation and Holocaust Involvement ===
As RuSHA chief, Hofmann played a leading role in the &quot;Germanisation&quot; of the captured territory of Poland and the Soviet Union. This involved the resettling of Germans in the Nazi-occupied eastern territories and ejecting the native families from those lands. Hoffman also was responsible for conducting official race tests on the population of the occupied territories for racial categorization and selection. His office was also responsible for the abduction of certain (chiefly Polish) children who demonstrated &quot;racially acceptable traits&quot;. These children would be taken to Germany to be raised as Germans, or to be used as forced labourers. Hofmann arranged forced household-help arrangements for several friends and Party comrades, and even retained the services of one of these children in his own household, boasting in a letter to a friend: &quot;I myself employ a young Polish girl, a re-Germanization candidate, who we can only keep under control by treating her strictly.&quot;
Hofmann was a participant at the Wannsee Conference on 20 January 1942, called to develop plans for the implementation of the so-called &quot;Final Solution to the Jewish Question&quot;. He knew many of the other attendees, including SS-&quot;Obergruppenführer&quot; Reinhard Heydrich, who chaired the meeting and with whom Hofmann had previously worked on issues of Germanisation in the occupied eastern territories. Moreover, Hofmann&#x27;s RuSHA office for years had compiled and maintained an index of individuals with partly Jewish origins, in order to assist in tracking down such persons not only in Germany but in other areas of Europe. Hofmann was not a passive attendee at the conference but put forward his own suggestions on some issues. On the issue of launching the final solution in Hungary, for example, he offered to send personnel from his office to assist with orientation when the time came. By getting RuSHA involved, he aimed to ensure that the extermination program was conducted as thoroughly as possible from a racial selection perspective. He also advocated sterilization for so-called &quot;first-degree &quot;Mischling&quot;&quot;, that is, individuals with two Jewish grandparents. He also later opposed treating as Germans the so called &quot;second-degree &quot;Mischling&quot;&quot;, that is, individuals with only one Jewish grandparent. Instead, he proposed subjecting them to a racial inspection by RuSHA and, if they displayed what he termed &quot;prominent racial characteristics&quot;, they would be treated as &quot;first-degree &quot;Mischling&quot;&quot;.

=== Higher SS and Police Leader ===
On 21 June 1942, Hofmann was granted membership in the Waffen-SS with the rank of &quot;Generalleutnant&quot;. During the war years, the pressures of increased recruitment for the Waffen-SS meant that RuSHA had to limit its background investigations to officers and their spouses or fiancées. The expanded numbers of settlers to the eastern territories also added an increased burden. When his organization had difficulty keeping up with the volume of racial examinations due to a lack of manpower, Hofmmann was removed as RuSHA Chief by &quot;Reichsführer-SS&quot; Heinrich Himmler on 20 April 1943, and he was transferred to Stuttgart as the chief of SS-&quot;Oberabschnitt Südwest&quot; and the Higher SS and Police Leader (HSSPF) for southwestern Germany (Gau Württemberg-Hohenzollern and Gau Baden-Alsace). He was also made head of the police section in the Württemberg Interior Ministry. In his new positions, he had supervisory custody of all the prisoners of war in &quot;Wehrkreis&quot; (Military District) V. On 21 June 1943, he was promoted to SS-&quot;Obergruppenführer und General der Polizei&quot;, followed on 1 July 1944 by the additional designation of &quot;General der Waffen-SS&quot;. He had now advanced to the highest levels of the SS military and police hierarchy but, on 29 November 1944, he was reprimanded for cowardice by Himmler, who accused him of an overly hasty retreat before the US Army&#x27;s assault on Alsace.

== Post war life and prosecutions ==
In the last weeks of fighting, Hofmann fled from Stuttgart around 19 April 1945, taking refuge with the 19th Army in Pfunds in the Tyrol until it capitulated in the first week of May. He then destroyed his uniform and identity card and, making his way to Munich, went underground where he hid out with the assistance of his father and a family friend. After two months, he turned himself in on 8 July 1945 and was arrested by members of the US Counterintelligence Corps. Hofmann was indicted by the US Military Tribunal on 1 July 1947 and put on trial at Nuremberg on 20 October 1947 at the so called RuSHA Trial. He was charged with crimes against humanity, war crimes and membership in a criminal organization. On 10 March 1948, he was found guilty on all counts and was sentenced to 25 years in prison, which was reduced to 15 years on 21 January 1951 by US High Commissioner John J. McCloy. On 7 April 1954, Hofmann was released from Landsberg Prison. Thereafter, he settled in Künzelsau, Baden-Württemberg and worked as a commercial clerk.

Between 1959 and 1982, Hofmann was questioned several times again during preliminary investigations into crimes of the Nazi era. In two instances, the investigations led to criminal proceedings being initiated against him. The first was a case in 1959–60 brought by the public prosecutor in Heilbronn, charging him with extrajudicial killings in the Natzweiler-Struthof concentration camp when he was HSSPF in Stuttgart. The second was an investigation in 1982 into the Wannsee Conference participants by the Stuttgart prosecutor. However, Hofmann&#x27;s prior convictions prevented the prosecution from trying him again for the same crimes, so he was limited to being questioned as a witness. Both cases were eventually dismissed, and Hofmann died in Bad Mergentheim on 31 December 1982.

== Film portrayals ==
Hofmann was portrayed by Robert Atzorn in the German film &quot;Die Wannseekonferenz&quot; (1984), by Nicholas Woodeson in the BBC/HBO film &quot;Conspiracy&quot; (2001) and by in the German film &quot;Die Wannseekonferenz&quot; (2022).

<doc id="757835" wikidata="Q482621" url="?curid=757835" title="The Blue Danube">
<text>&quot;The Blue Danube&quot; is the common English title of &quot;An der schönen blauen Donau&quot;, Op. 314 (German for &quot;By the Beautiful Blue Danube&quot;), a waltz by the Austrian composer Johann Strauss II, composed in 1866. Originally performed on 15 February 1867 at a concert of the Wiener Männergesang-Verein (Vienna Men&#x27;s Choral Association), it has been one of the most consistently popular pieces of music in the classical repertoire. Its initial performance was considered only a mild success, however, and Strauss is reputed to have said, &quot;The devil take the waltz, my only regret is for the coda—I wish that had been a success!&quot;

After the original music was written, the words were added by the Choral Association&#x27;s poet, Joseph Weyl. Strauss later added more music, and Weyl needed to change some of the words. Strauss adapted it into a purely orchestral version for the 1867 Paris World&#x27;s Fair, and it became a great success in this form. The instrumental version is by far the most commonly performed today. An alternate text was written by Franz von Gernerth, &quot;&quot; (Danube so blue). &quot;The Blue Danube&quot; premiered in the United States in its instrumental version on 1 July 1867 in New York, and in the UK in its choral version on 21 September 1867 in London at the promenade concerts at Covent Garden.

When Strauss&#x27;s stepdaughter, Alice von Meyszner-Strauss, asked the composer Johannes Brahms to sign her autograph-fan, he wrote down the first bars of &quot;The Blue Danube&quot;, but added &quot;Leider nicht von Johannes Brahms&quot; (&quot;Unfortunately not by Johannes Brahms&quot;).

== Composition notes ==

The work commences with an extended introduction in the key of A major with shimmering (tremolo) violins and a horn spelling out the familiar waltz theme, answered by staccato wind chords, in a subdued mood. It rises briefly into a loud passage but quickly dies down into the same restful nature of the opening bars. A contrasting and quick phrase in D major anticipates the waltz before three quiet downward-moving bass notes &quot;usher in&quot; the first principal waltz melody.

The first waltz theme is a familiar gently rising triad motif played by cellos and horns in the tonic (D major), accompanied by the harp; the Viennese waltz beat is accentuated at the end of each 3-note phrase. The Waltz 1A triumphantly ends its rounds of the motif, and waltz 1B follows in the same key; the genial mood is still apparent.

Waltz 2A glides in quietly (still in D major) before a short contrasting middle section in B-flat major. The entire section is repeated.

A more dour waltz 3A is introduced in G major before a fleeting eighth-note melodic phrase (waltz 3B). A loud Intrada (introduction) in G minor is then played. Waltz 4A starts off in a romantic mood (it is in F major) before a more joyous waltz 4B in the same key.

After another short Intrada in A, cadencing in F-sharp minor, sonorous clarinets spell out the poignant melody of waltz 5A in A. Waltz 5B is the climax, punctuated by cymbal crashes. Each of these may be repeated at the discretion of the performer.

The coda recalls earlier sections (3A and 2A) before furious chords usher in a recap of the romantic Waltz 4A. The idyll is cut short as the waltz hurries back to the famous waltz theme 1A again. This statement is also cut short, however, by the final codetta: a variation of 1A is presented, featuring a dialogue with the trilling Flutes, the strings, and the quiet sounding horns, connecting to a rushing eighth-note passage in the final few bars: repeated tonic chords underlined by a snare drum roll and a bright-sounding flourish.

A typical performance lasts around 10 minutes, with the seven-minute main piece, followed by a three-minute coda.

== Choral version ==
The &quot;Beautiful Blue Danube&quot; was first written as a song for a carnival choir (for bass and tenor), with rather satirical lyrics (Austria having just lost a war with Prussia). The original title was also referring to a poem about the Danube in the poet Karl Isidor Beck&#x27;s hometown, Baja in Hungary, and not in Vienna. Later Franz von Gernerth wrote new, more &quot;official-sounding&quot; lyrics:

==In popular culture==
The piece plays in the opening scenes and as background music in several other scenes of the 1932 film &quot;Grand Hotel.&quot;

The specifically Viennese sentiment associated with Strauss&#x27;s melody has made it an unofficial national anthem of Austria.

A condensed version of the piece was used in the Warner Bros. &quot;Merrie Melody&quot; 1943 animated short, &quot;A Corny Concerto&quot;&#x27;s second segment featuring a young Daffy Duck trying to join a family of white swans, but is treated with complete disdain by the mother swan as being unworthy throughout the short as the &quot;ugly duckling&quot; until he bravely saves her three cygnets from a predatory buzzard.

The piece was prominently used in Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s 1968 film &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;. After a leap from humanity&#x27;s prehistoric past to its spacefaring future, the first two-thirds of &quot;The Blue Danube&quot; are heard as a space plane approaches and docks with a space station; it concludes while another spacecraft travels from the station to the Moon. The piece is then reprised over the film&#x27;s closing credits.

The piece was prominently used in the 1994 live-action film &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;.

The piece was featured in the 1997 blockbuster film &quot;Titanic&quot;, when Jack Dawson enters the Grand Staircase in first class on the ill fated liner. It was performed by I Salonisti as the ship&#x27;s famous orchestra.

The piece was used in the 2008 American animated comedy film &quot;Horton Hears a Who!&quot; when Horton has his trunk filled with air and is running across a rickety bridge but nearly falls off the rickety bridge over a gaping chasm with fog and stalagmites at the bottom, which causes a dentist&#x27;s needle to accidentally slip into the Mayor&#x27;s arm while getting a root canal.

The piece is used in the 1984 video game &quot;Elite&quot; and in its sequels, &quot;&quot; (1993) and &quot;Elite Dangerous&quot; (2014), during the automated docking sequence of a player&#x27;s spaceship, a homage to the docking scene in the film &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;.

The piece is used throughout the Netflix series 2021 &quot;Squid Game&quot; to indicate the start of a new game.

The main melody is traditionally sung in Mexico at birthday parties to the lyrics &quot;Queremos pastel, pastel, pastel&quot; (&quot;We want cake, cake, cake&quot;), as a way for the guests to indicate that they want the birthday cake to be served.

<text>In common law, an estate is a living or deceased person&#x27;s net worth. It is the sum of a person&#x27;s assets – the legal rights, interests, and entitlements to property of any kind – less all liabilities at a given time. The issue is of special legal significance on a question of bankruptcy and death of the person. (See inheritance.)

Depending on the particular context, the term is also used in reference to an estate in land or of a particular kind of property (such as real estate or personal estate). The term is also used to refer to the sum of a person&#x27;s assets only.

The equivalent in civil law legal systems is patrimony.

==Bankruptcy==
Under United States bankruptcy law, a person&#x27;s estate consists of all assets or property of any kind available for distribution to creditors. However, some assets are recognized as exempt to allow a person significant resources to restart their financial life. In the United States, asset exemptions depend on various factors, including state and federal law. The estate (or assets) of a bankrupt person is administered by a trustee in bankruptcy. The legal position in all common law countries is similar in this respect.

==Legal estate in land==

In land law, the term &quot;estate&quot; is a remnant of the English feudal system, which created a complex hierarchy of estates and interests in land. The allodial or fee simple interest is the most complete ownership that one can have of property in the common law system. An estate can be an estate for years, an estate at will, a life estate (extinguishing at the death of the holder), an estate &quot;pur autre vie&quot; (a life interest for the life of another person) or a fee tail estate (to the heirs of one&#x27;s body) or some more limited kind of heir (e.g. to heirs male of one&#x27;s body).

Fee simple estates may be either fee simple absolute or defeasible (&quot;i.e. subject to future conditions&quot;) like fee simple determinable and fee simple subject to condition subsequent; this is the complex system of future interests (q.v.) which allows concepts of trusts and estates to elide into actuarial science through the use of life contingencies.

Estate in land can also be divided into estates of inheritance and other estates that are not of inheritance. The fee simple estate and the fee tail estate are estates of inheritance; they pass to the owner&#x27;s heirs by operation of law, either without restrictions (in the case of fee simple), or with restrictions (in the case of fee tail). The estate for years and the life estate are estates not of inheritance; the owner owns nothing after the term of years has passed, and cannot pass on anything to his or her heirs.

Legal estates and interests are called rights &quot;in rem&quot;, and said to be &quot;good against the world&quot;.

==Equitable estates==
Superimposed on the legal estate and interests in land, English courts created &quot;equitable interests&quot; over the same legal interests. These obligations are called trusts which will be enforceable in a court. A trustee is the person who holds the legal title to property, while the beneficiary is said to have an equitable interest in the property.

<text>An estate is a large parcel of land under single ownership, which generates income for its owner.

==British context==
In the United Kingdom, historically an estate comprises the houses, outbuildings, supporting farmland, tenanted buildings, and natural resources (such as woodland) that surround the gardens and grounds of a very large property, such as a country house, mansion, palace or castle. It is the modern term for a manor, but lacks a manor&#x27;s now-abolished jurisdiction.

===Country house estate===
The &quot;estate&quot; formed an economic system where the profits from its produce and rents (of housing or agricultural land) sustained the main household, formerly known as the manor house. Thus, &quot;the estate&quot; may refer to all other cottages and villages in the same ownership as the mansion itself, covering more than one former manor. Examples of such great estates are Woburn Abbey in Bedfordshire, England, and Blenheim Palace, in Oxfordshire, England, built to replace the former manor house of Woodstock.

Before the 1870s, these estates often encompassed several thousand acres, generally consisting of several farms let to tenants; the great house was supplied with food from its own home farm (for meat and dairy) and a kitchen garden (for fruit and vegetables). A dower house may have been present on the estate to allow the widow of the former owner her own accommodation and household when moved out the primary house on the estate.

The agricultural depression from the 1870s onwards and the decline of servants meant that the large rural estates declined in social and economic significance, and many of the country houses were destroyed, or land was parcelled off to be sold.

===The great estates===

An urban example of the use of the term estate is presented by the &quot;great estates&quot; in Central London such as the Grosvenor and Portman, which continue to generate significant income through rent.
Sometimes London streets are named after the rural estates of aristocratic landowners, such as in the case of Wimpole Street.

===Sporting estate===
From the Norman era, hunting had always been a popular pastime with the British royalty and nobility, and dating from the medieval era, land was parcelled off and put aside for the leisurely pursuits of hunting. These originated as royal forests and chase land, eventually evolving into deer parks, or sometimes into the Royal Parks if owned by the royal family. The ownership of these estates for hunting was in practice strictly restricted until the 19th century when legal changes to game hunting meant the nobility, gentry and other wealthy families could purchase land for the purposes of hunting. At the administrative centre of these sporting estates is usually a sporting lodge. These are also often known as shooting or hunting estates.

===Other uses===
In modern British English, the term &quot;estate&quot; has been generalised to any large parcel of land under single ownership, such as a housing estate or industrial estate.

==In the United States==
Large country estates were traditionally found in New York&#x27;s Long Island, and Westchester County, the Philadelphia Main Line, Maine&#x27;s Bar Harbor on Mount Desert Island, and other affluent East Coast enclaves; and the San Francisco Bay Area, early Beverly Hills, California, Montecito, California, Santa Barbara, California and other affluent West Coast enclaves. All these regions had strong traditions of large agricultural, grazing, and productive estates modeled on those in Europe. However, by the late 1940s and early 1950s, many of these estates had been demolished and subdivided, in some cases resulting in suburban villages named for the former owners, as in Baxter Estates, New York.

An important distinction between the United States and England is that &quot;American country estates, unlike English ones, rarely, if ever, supported the house.&quot; American estates have always been about &quot;the pleasures of land ownership and the opportunity to enjoy active, outdoor pursuits.&quot; Although some American estates included farms, they were always in support of the larger recreational purpose.

Today, large houses on lots of at least several acres in size are often referred to as &quot;estates&quot;, in a contemporary updating of the word&#x27;s usage. Most contemporary American estates are not large enough to include significant amounts of self-supporting productive agricultural land, and the money for their improvement and maintenance usually comes from fortunes earned in other economic sectors besides agriculture. They are distinguished from ordinary middle-class American houses by sheer size, as well as their landscaping, gardens, outbuildings, and most importantly, recreational structures (e.g., tennis courts and swimming pools). This usage is the predominant connotation of &quot;estate&quot; in contemporary American English (when not preceded by the word &quot;real&quot;), which is why &quot;industrial estate&quot; sounds like an oxymoron to Americans, as few wealthy persons would deliberately choose to live next to factories.

Traditional American estates include:
*Biltmore, Asheville, North Carolina; estate of George Washington Vanderbilt II
*Hearst Castle, Central Coast of California; estate of William Randolph Hearst
*Castle Hill, Ipswich, Massachusetts; estate of Richard Teller Crane Jr.
*Meadow Farm, East Islip, New York; estate of H. B. Hollins (demolished)
*Westbrook, Great River, New York; estate of William Bayard Cutting
*Coe Hall, Oyster Bay, New York; estate of William R. Coe
*Indian Neck Hall, Oakdale, New York; estate of Frederick Gilbert Bourne
*Inisfada, Manhasset, New York; estate of Nicholas Brady
*Idle Hour, Oakdale, New York; estate of William Kissam Vanderbilt
*Oheka Castle, Cold Spring Harbor, New York; estate of Otto Hermann Kahn
*Harold Lloyd Estate, &#x27;Greenacres&#x27; Beverly Hills, California; estate of Harold Lloyd
*Filoli, Woodside, California; estate of William Bowers Bourn II.
*Riven Rock, Montecito, California; estate of Stanley and Katharine McCormick (demolished)
*Carolands, Hillsborough, California; estate of Harriett Pullman Carolan (daughter of George Pullman)
*Dumbarton Oaks, Georgetown, Washington, D.C.; estate of the Woods—Bliss Family, landscape architecture by Beatrix Farrand

<text>Patrick William Howard (born 14 November 1973) is an ex-head coach at Leicester Tigers and a former Australian rugby union international who played centre or fly-half. He was the General Manager, Team Performance – for the Australia national cricket team.

He was born in Sydney. His father Jake Howard played prop for Australia and his grandfather Cyril Towers also played centre for the Wallabies.

==Early life==
He attended Marist College Ashgrove, Brisbane where he played 1st XV Rugby. He started his career playing for the University of Queensland Football club. Studying pharmacy at the university he was a recipient of a University of Queensland Sporting Scholarship.

==Playing &amp; Coaching career==

Howard started his career in the amateur era playing for the Queensland Reds while at Queensland University, he made his international debut for Australia on 17 July 1993 against New Zealand at Carisbrook, Dunedin. In 1996 Howard signed for the ACT Brumbies in the inaugural Super 12 season. Howard made the last of his 20 test appearances on 22 November 1997 against Scotland at Murrayfield.

In 1998 he signed for Leicester Tigers, displacing Will Greenwood, who was forced to return to Harlequins for first team rugby. Howard became a pivotal part of the Tigers&#x27; championship winning side. Howard started the victorious 2001 Heineken Cup Final for Leicester.

After the departure of Joel Stransky in 2000, he was appointed as the Tigers&#x27; backs coach, however he had his sights set on regaining a Wallaby jersey ahead of the 2003 World Cup so rejoined the Brumbies in 2001, swapping his playing position with Rod Kafer. He was unable to make the squad for the World Cup and returned to Europe, playing for French side Montferrand for one season in 2003/04.

After retiring as a player at the end of the season in 2004, Howard returned to Leicester Tigers, once again becoming backs coach. In 2005 he was appointed as head coach succeeding John Wells.

He guided Tigers to the Guinness Premiership and EDF Energy Cup finals in 2007, winning the domestic double. They also made the final of the Heineken Cup but were denied an historic treble – succumbing to Wasps 25–9.

On 28 December 2006, he announced he would resign as coach of the Tigers at the end of the 2006/7 season. Marcelo Loffreda was named Howard&#x27;s successor, who took up his new role after the 2007 Rugby World Cup.

==Cricket management career==
Howard returned to his native Australia to manage his family&#x27;s pharmaceutical company, however quickly became general manager of the Australian Rugby Union&#x27;s high performance unit. He also worked as Chief Operations Officer at Cromwell Property Group prior to his move to rugby management.

On 13 October 2011, he was announced as the General Manager, Team Performance – for the Australian Cricket Team. This role, created to focus solely on team performance, was one of the key recommendations of the Don Argus led Australian Team Performance Review adopted by Cricket Australia&#x27;s Board in August.

Howard has received some criticism for this role. Shane Warne said in 2013, Cricket Australia should &quot;please put current cricket people in charge to run the game, select teams, not ex rugby or any other sports people&quot; and called Howard a &quot;muppet&quot;.

In March 2013, following being temporarily dropped from the national team Shane Watson said Howard had not been involved in cricket long enough to pass comment on his commitment to the Australian team.

<text>Anders Sandøe Ørsted (21 December 1778 – 1 May 1860) was a Danish lawyer, politician and jurist. He served as the Prime Minister of Denmark in 1853–1854.

==Biography==
He studied philosophy and law at the University of Copenhagen and was admitted to the bar in 1799. He became a noted jurist. An early case overseen by him was that of Hans Jonatan, an escaped slave, which was (at least viewed retrospectively) a major test case in Danish law on slavery; Anders condemned Hans to be returned to the West Indies, where he had been purchased (Hof-og Stadsret: &quot;Generalmajorinde Henriette de Schimmelmann contra mulatten Hans Jonathan 1802&quot;). 

Relatively early, he was connected to the national administration, and from 1825 to 1848, he was “&quot;generalprokurør&quot;” (juridical adviser of the government). He drew up the constitution which was granted in 1831. He was cabinet minister 1842–48, and from October 1853 to December 1854 was prime minister. He was forced to resign from his office as prime minister by his unpopular conservatism, a distinct departure from his earlier politics. In 1855, he was impeached on the charge of breaking the constitution, but he was acquitted and retired to private life.

==Analysis==
He is considered one of the most important jurists in 19th century Danish legal history. He was a pioneer of connecting jurisprudence and practice, and both as a judge and as an author, he successfully worked on making practice the foundation of legislation.

His political career was one of paradoxes. As a royal councillor of the absolute monarchy, he was rather liberal and tolerant and therefore often unpopular with the more conservative elements. As the opposition grew stronger however, he became more conservative and as prime minister, he was considered a full-blood reactionary. His attempt to charter a very conservative constitution led to cooperation between the king and the liberals that forced him to resign. He also was a joker in the England times.

==Literary works==

Throughout his career Ørsted was a prolific writer. Among other things he wrote on Kantian and Hegelian philosophy, on Danish and Norwegian law, on Scandinavian politics (1857) and left an autobiography (1856). He was also the editor of several journals, most notable &quot;Juridisk Arkiv&quot; (1804-1812), &quot;Nyt Juridisk Arkiv&quot; (1812-1830) and &quot;Juridisk Tidsskrift&quot; (1820-1840), as well as the official government periodical publication &quot;Collegial-Tidende&quot; (1815-34 co-edited with Peter Johan Monrad, and exclusively by Ørsted 1834–1848).

==Family==
He was the brother of noted physicist Hans Christian Ørsted (1777–1851), and uncle of the botanist Anders Sandøe Ørsted (1816–1872).
He was married to Sophie Ørsted née Oehlenschläger (1782–1818) and was the brother-in-law of Adam Oehlenschläger.

<text>Max Joseph Oertel (20 March 1835 – 17 July 1897) was a German physician. He developed a system for the correction of respiratory troubles, and invented the laryngeal stroboscope.

==Biography==
Oertel was a native of Dillingen. In 1863 he obtained his medical doctorate from the University of Munich, where he spent the following four years as assistant to Karl von Pfeufer (1806-1869). In 1867 he received his habilitation, attaining a professorship at Munich in 1876.

He is credited with being the first physician to use a laryngeal stroboscope for examination of the larynx. He combined a stroboscopic lamp with a laryngeal mirror in order to study &quot;vocal movements&quot; in different registers. Application of the strobe light allowed him to view the vibrating vocal cords in slow motion, thus enabling detailed views of the larynx in an open or closed position.

Oertel was the author of a number of written works on cardiac, circulatory and obesity disorders, and was an early advocate of the &quot;terrain cure&quot;, a set of therapeutic exercises that involved graduated hiking and climbing.

Oertel made contributions to the study of diphtheria by reproducing the disease in laboratory rabbits.

<text>John Leslie Patrick &quot;Jake&quot; Howard (30 August 194511 December 2015) was an international rugby footballer who played prop for Australia.

Howard was schooled at St. Joseph&#x27;s College, Hunters Hill from 1957 and enjoyed enormous schoolboy sporting success playing in the college&#x27;s 1st XV in four consecutive years 1960–63 and rowing in the 1st VIII for three years. He played his club rugby at Sydney University and took up rowing at the senior level with the Sydney Rowing Club. He stroked a junior VIII for the club in 1964 and stroked a coxed pair to a state championship in the 1964/65 season.

Howard made his international rugby debut on 6 June 1970 against Scotland and went on to make six further international representative appearances between 1970 and 1973. His final Test appearance was on the 1973 tour of Wales and England.

He coached rugby at the Sydney University club, at the University of Queensland&#x27;s rugby club and in assisting roles with the 1991 and 1992 Wallabies focussing on scrum play emphasising the power of the front-row.

His wife Margariete was the daughter of Wallaby Cyril Towers. Their son Pat Howard (born 1973) played centre and fly-half for the Wallabies from 1993 to 1997. Margariete Howard was thus the daughter, wife and mother of a Wallaby.

Jake Howard died on 11 December 2015 at the age of 70.

<text>The Varukers are a British punk rock band formed in 1979 by vocalist Anthony &quot;Rat&quot; Martin. They produced their most influential recordings in the early 1980s. The band play in D-beat, the musical style of Discharge. Also like Discharge, the Varukers&#x27; lyrics carry an anarchist political ideology.

==History==
Initially known as the Veruccas, the band altered the spelling of their name to the Varukers to convey more aggression. When recording in the early 1980s, they were part of a broader trend known as &quot;UK 82&quot;, second generation punk, or UK hardcore. Bands such as the Varukers, Discharge, Chaos UK, Amebix, the Exploited, and Charged GBH took the existing 1977-era punk sound and melded it with the incessant, heavy drumbeats and &quot;wall of sound&quot; distortion guitar sound of new wave of British heavy metal (NWOBHM) bands such as Motörhead. The new, harder-edged style also tended to use much darker, more nihilistic, and more violent lyrics, and vocals were often shouted rather than sung.

While the Varukers split in 1989, vocalist Rat and guitarist Biff put the band back together in 1991. Stylistically their 1990s-era music resembled the traditional UK82 style. Since the band had former members of Discharge, a D-beat sound developed as time went on. The band has gone through many line-up changes over the years with the only constant member being Rat on vocals while guitarist Biff has been with the band since 1985.

Even with Rat splitting his time between the Varukers and Discharge and Biff splitting his time with Sick on the Bus. The Varukers continue to tour. They shared a headlining spot with such acts as Broken Bones, The Adicts, Vice Squad and GBH at the British Invasion 2k6 concert festival in San Bernardino, California, which ended in rioting.

Guitarist Sean is the former manager of the public house The Olde Angel in Nottingham, United Kingdom.

Journalist and Killing Joke biographer Jyrki &quot;Spider&quot; Hämäläinen directed a documentary about the band that was released 2022.

<text>Adam Friedrich Oeser (17 February 1717 in Pressburg – 18 March 1799 in Leipzig) was a German etcher, painter and sculptor.

== Biography ==

Oeser worked and studied in Pressburg (student of Georg Raphael Donner in sculpture) and Vienna at the Vienna Academy (student of Jacob van Schuppen and Daniel Grau in painting). He went to Dresden in Saxony in 1739, where he studied with Mengs and Dietrich, and created portraits and scenes for the Royal Opera, and mural paintings in Schloss Hubertusburg (1749). In 1756 Count Heinrich von Bünau commissioned him to decorate the newly built Schloss Dahlen.

Oeser moved to Leipzig in 1759. Appointed director of the newly founded Academy there in 1764, he zealously opposed mannerism in art. He was a stout champion of Winckelmann&#x27;s advocacy of reform on antique lines. He also befriended Winckelmann, who lived with him and his family in 1754/55.
Oeser&#x27;s chief importance was as a teacher. He was the drawing teacher of Johann Wolfgang Goethe, with whom he kept up friendly relations afterwards at Weimar. Besides a number of decorative works, mostly ceilings, he painted mythological and religious canvases and portraits, among the best being: &quot;The Artist&#x27;s Children&quot; (1766, Dresden Gallery), &quot;Marriage at Cana&quot; (1777) and four others in Leipzig Museum, and &quot;The Painter&#x27;s Studio&quot; (Weimar Museum). His best effort in sculpture is the monument of Elector Frederick Augustus (1780) on the Königsplatz in Leipzig, which he created together with his student and architect Johann Carl Friedrich Dauthe. Today, it is in the garden of the Gohlis Palace in Leipzig. In the ballroom inside the palace is the ceiling painting “Life of Psyche” (1779) by Oeser.

In 1766 Oeser became a member of the Masonic Lodge &quot;Minerva zu den drei Palmen&quot;, Leipzig. In 1776 he became a member of the &quot;Balduin&quot; Lodge, Leipzig.

He resided in Germany. Among his pupils was Sophie Dinglinger.

<text>Heinrich Friedrich Otto Abel (22 January 1824 – 28 October 1854) was a German historian.

==Life==
He was born at Reichenbach Priory in the Kingdom of Württemberg, a Protestant religious house, where his father was a clergyman. Beginning in 1824, Abel visited the universities of Tübingen, Jena, Heidelberg, Bonn and Berlin, studying history. Among his teachers was Friedrich Christoph Dahlmann.

Abel also showed political interest in the revolutions of 1848, and published a tract &quot;Das neue deutsche Reich und sein Kaiser&quot; (&quot;The New German Empire and his Emperor&quot;) n which he enthused about the Kingdom of Prussia. As a result, the Prussian minister of external affairs, Heinrich von Arnim, offered him a place in the Prussian embassy in Frankfurt. However, his high expectations were disappointed many times over. He quit the diplomatic service in 1850 and in the ensuing period devoted his energies to the &quot;Monumenta Germaniae Historica&quot;.

In 1851, Abel inaugurated his formal academic career with his appointment as a lecturer (&quot;Privatdozent&quot;) at the University of Bonn. The best known of his scholars was Heinrich von Treitschke. While travelling in 1853, Abel was affected by pulmonary phthisis and died in 1854 in the care of his uncle in Leonberg.

<text>Cyril Towers (30 July 1906 – 9 June 1985) was an Australian rugby union player, a state and national representative centre who made 57 appearances for the Wallabies, played in 19 Test matches and captained the national team on three occasions in 1937.

==Club career==
Cyril Towers was born in Mansfield, Victoria. His father was killed at Gallipoli when he was nine-years-old. After his mother remarried, his family moved first to Melbourne, then to Roma, Queensland, before they settled in Sydney. Towers attended Randwick Boys High School where he was taught rugby by Oates Taylor, described by former Australian rugby coach Bob Dwyer as a &quot;forward-thinking coach.&quot; Towers was later transferred to Waverley College where he came under the influence of coach Arthur Hennessey and future Wallabies player Wally Meagher, whom he would play with on the 1927–28 New South Wales rugby union tour of the British Isles, France and Canada.

Towers&#x27; club career was with Randwick DRUFC in Sydney for whom he made 233 first grade appearances. Along with Wally Meagher his senior at Randwick, Towers pioneered the application of running rugby tactics at the club. &quot;Attack&quot; was the main credo, setting up the wings the main goal and kicking for touch was frowned upon.

==Representative career==

His representative debut was as a 19-year-old in 1926 when selected for the New South Wales Waratahs to appear against a touring All Blacks outfit. New South Wales won the match 26–20 and Towers was recalled for the fourth encounter which the hosts lost 21–28. With no Queensland Rugby Union administration or competition in place from 1919 to 1929, the New South Wales Waratahs were the top Australian representative rugby union team of the period and these debut matches were in 1986 decreed by the Australian Rugby Union as official Test matches.

Towers was selected for the 1927–28 New South Wales rugby union tour of the British Isles, France and Canada, turning 21 on the ship going over. He played in 25 matches of the tour exceeded only by Wylie Breckenbridge (29), Tom Lawton (27) and Alex Ross (29). With Jack Ford he was the equal top try scorer and the equal second highest point scorer behind Lawton. He played in three Test matches of the tour.

He wrote a travel diary of the 1927–28 tour which was serialised between June and December 1928 for the magazine &quot;Australian Banker&quot;. (Towers worked in banking). His Test match reports are quoted extensively in the tour article.

Towers toured New Zealand in 1928 with the Waratahs under Syd Malcolm as captain. Geoff Bland was the only other veteran from the 1927 World Tour squad and five matches in total were won and five lost. Towers played in all matches, including three Tests and was top scorer with 29 points. Howell quotes Chester and McMillan from &quot;The Visitors&quot;: &quot; &quot;Towers was hailed by many critics as the best centre in the world rugby and was certainly one of the great Australian players of all time&quot;&quot;.

In 1929 the All Blacks toured Australia, Towers was in two of the three Test team captained by Tom Lawton which for the first time in history beat the All Blacks 3–0 in a series whitewash. With the Queensland Rugby Union now back in existence for the first time since 1919 this was the first truly national Wallabies team fielded since 1914.

==National captain==

Great Britain toured Australia in 1930 and Towers played against them in four matches for state and country. Then in 1931 he was a senior in the full Australian team sent to New Zealand with Syd Malcolm as captain. They won three, drew one and lost six matches including the single Test but Towers played in nine matches, was the tour&#x27;s top try-scorer and was honoured for the first time with the national captaincy in a minor match against Seddon Shield Districts.

In 1933, Towers was left out of the squad that made Australia&#x27;s first ever rugby tour of South Africa. It was a controversial omission made by team manager Dr Wally Mathews because of Towers&#x27; forthrightness and perceived disruptiveness. Still he had further representative appearances ahead of him. In 1934 he played in the two match series against the All Blacks in which the Wallabies wrestled away the Bledisloe Cup for the first time. Then in 1937 perhaps his finest hour, as Australia&#x27;s Test captain in the 9–5 defeat against the touring Springboks then hailed as the finest team in the world, in which game Towers scored all of Australia&#x27;s points and inspired the defence to hold out the Boks onslaught.

He retired in 1940 after having again been left out of the 1939 Wallaby team – a blessing since the team travelled to the other side of the world but did not play a match due to the outbreak of World War II. He had played 57 matches for Australia, 19 of them Tests, 2 of those as captain.

==Post-playing and family==
In retirement he was one of the first rugby commentators, becoming known as the &quot;voice of rugby&quot; from his broadcasts for the Australian Broadcasting Commission.

His son-in-law Jake Howard played in the front-row for the Wallabies in the 1970s. Jake&#x27;s son, Cyril&#x27;s grandson Pat Howard, also played centre for Australia in the 1990s. A plaque in the Sydney Cricket Ground&#x27;s Walk of Honour commemorates Towers&#x27; career. In 2006 he was honoured in the second set of inductees into the Australian Rugby Union Hall of Fame

<text>GBH (originally known as Charged GBH) are an English punk rock band which was formed in 1978 by vocalist Colin Abrahall, guitarist Colin &quot;Jock&quot; Blyth, bassist Sean McCarthy (replaced by Ross Lomas after two years) and drummer Andy &quot;Wilf&quot; Williams.

== Background ==
GBH were early pioneers of British street punk, often nicknamed &quot;UK 82&quot;, along with Discharge, Broken Bones, The Exploited, and The Varukers. GBH have gone on to influence several punk rock musicians, but their influence has been especially far-reaching in metal, including the early Bathory albums, Hellhammer/Celtic Frost, Exodus, and each of the &quot;big four of thrash metal&quot; (Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer and Anthrax). Metallica frontman James Hetfield has repeatedly expressed his enthusiasm for GBH and said such bands were the beginning of thrash metal to him. Sascha Konietzko of KMFDM has said he had listened to second-wave punk bands before starting his own band, mentioning GBH as an example. GBH have also influenced 1990s and 2000s rock bands such as Nirvana, Queens of the Stone Age, Green Day, The Offspring, and Rancid.

The band&#x27;s name was originally Charged GBH, then was shortened to GBH. It is widely understood that the name came from then-bassist Sean McCarthy being charged with grievous bodily harm (GBH), though vocalist Colin Abrahall denied this in 2018, claiming it was just a name like UK Subs; and, when pushed, said the initials stood for &quot;Girls, Booze, and Hash&quot;. Though the core line up of Colin, Ross, and Jock has stayed the same throughout their history, the drum stool has been occupied by a number of incumbents following Wilf&#x27;s departure after the &quot;Midnight Madness and Beyond&quot; album and &quot;Oh No It&#x27;s GBH Again&quot; 12&quot; EP. 1989 saw the arrival of German drummer Kai Reder who played on three albums (&quot;No Need to Panic&quot;, &quot;A Fridge Too Far&quot;, and &quot;From Here to Reality&quot;), as well as the &quot;Wot a Bargain&quot; 12&quot;. Kai was replaced by American Joe &quot;Fish&quot; Montanero for one album (&quot;Church of the Truly Warped&quot;); this was the band&#x27;s last release for the Rough Justice label. The drum stool was then occupied from around 1994 by former Bomb Disneyland/Bomb Everything drummer Scott Preece, who has remained to this day and played on all releases since.

Throughout their recording history, the band has often included a cover version on many of their albums. &quot;Boston Babies&quot; originally recorded by Slaughter &amp; the Dogs (on &quot;City Baby Attacked By Rats&quot;), &quot;I Feel Alright&quot; from The Damned and The Stooges (on &quot;City Baby&#x27;s Revenge&quot;), &quot;Avenues and Alleyways&quot; by Tony Christie (on &quot;No Need to Panic&quot;), &quot;Needle in a Haystack&quot; originally by The Velvelettes (appeared on &quot;A Fridge Too Far&quot;), &quot;Destroy&quot; by The Vibrators (on &quot;From Here to Reality&quot;), &quot;I Need Energy&quot; by Zero Boys (on &quot;Church of the Truly Warped&quot;).

== History==

GBH embarked on several English and mainland US tours during the early 1980s, including several gigs at the 100 Club. 1982 saw the release of GBH&#x27;s first LP, &quot;City Baby Attacked by Rats&quot;, which reached No. 17 in the UK Albums Chart, as well as No. 2 in the UK Indie Chart. The band&#x27;s singles had also reached the UK Indie Chart, leading to an appearance on the UK TV programme &quot;The Tube&quot;, where they performed &quot;Give Me Fire&quot; (UK Indie Chart No. 2). Lyrically, the album dealt with criticism of British and European culture, violence, morbidity (especially in reference to the song &quot;Passenger on the Menu&quot;, which describes in graphic detail the experiences of the passengers on the Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571), atheism, nihilism and humour. Musically, the album was loud and fast, with few songs exceeding three minutes. The success of the first album was repeated with their second LP, &quot;City Babys Revenge&quot;, in 1983 and saw more extensive touring in America and Europe and higher profile UK shows, including the Carlisle Punk Festival. With the Carlisle Punk Festival the band co-headlined with fellow UK82 stalwarts The Exploited, and shared the bill with the likes of Toy Dolls, Chelsea, and The Destructors. In 1984, the band dropped the &quot;Charged&quot; from their name and became just GBH (grievous bodily harm).

They and many of their UK82 peers such as The Exploited, Picture Frame Seduction, Discharge, and The Varukers have all enjoyed success among punks in the United States. Although many of their contemporaries have evolved towards other styles over the years, GBH have remained fairly faithful to their original UK82 sound in subsequent releases. However, the band have experimented to some degree with a more speed metal-inflected, inspired and influenced sound particularly those of Motörhead and Tank, notably with their 1992 release &quot;Church of the Truly Warped&quot;, although they have since returned to a more punk sound. 

The band is still active and touring and maintain a strong following both in the UK and the rest of Europe, as well as in the United States and Japan. The band released their twelfth studio album, &quot;Momentum&quot;, on Hellcat Records in 2017.

<text>Seán Proinsias Ó Faoláin (27 February 1900 – 20 April 1991) was one of the most influential figures in 20th-century Irish culture. A short-story writer of international repute, he was also a leading commentator and critic.

==Biography==

Ó Faoláin was born as John Francis Whelan in Cork City, County Cork, Ireland. He was educated at the Presentation Brothers Secondary School in Cork. He came under the influence of Daniel Corkery, joining the Cork Dramatic Society, and increasing his knowledge of the Irish language, which he had begun in school. Shortly after entering University College, Cork, he joined the Irish Volunteers. He fought in the Irish War of Independence. He supported the anti-treaty forces during the Irish Civil War, serving as Censor for the &quot;Cork Examiner&quot; and on publicity issues for the IRA. After the Republican loss, he received M.A. degrees from the National University of Ireland and from Harvard University where he studied for 3 years. He was a Commonwealth Fellow from 1926 to 1928; and was a Harvard Fellow from 1928 to 1929.

He wrote his first stories in the 1920s, eventually completing 90 stories over a period of 60 years. From 1929 to 1933 he lectured at the Catholic college, St Mary&#x27;s College, at Strawberry Hill in Middlesex, England, during which period he wrote his first two books. His first book, &quot;Midsummer Night Madness&quot;, was published in 1932: it was a collection of stories partly based on his Civil War experiences. He afterwards returned to Ireland. He published novels; short stories; biographies; travel books; translations; literary criticism—including one of the rare full-length studies of the short story: &quot;The Short Story&quot; (1948). He also wrote a cultural history, &quot;The Irish&quot;, in 1947.

He served as director of the Arts Council of Ireland from 1956 to 1959, and from 1940 to 1946 was a founder member and editor of the Irish literary periodical &quot;The Bell&quot;. The list of contributors to &quot;The Bell&quot; included many of Ireland&#x27;s foremost writers, among them Patrick Kavanagh, Patrick Swift, Flann O&#x27;Brien, Frank O&#x27;Connor and Brendan Behan.

His &quot;Collected Stories&quot; were published in 1983. He died on 20 April 1991 in Dublin.

==Publishing==
Over the course of a long publishing career, Ó Faoláin wrote eight volumes of short stories, the first of which, &quot;Midsummer Night Madness&quot;, appeared in 1932; his last volume, &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot;, was published over forty years later, in 1976. O’Faoláin also wrote four novels, three travel books, six biographies to include Constance Markievicz, Cardinal Newman, Daniel O&#x27;Connell, and Wolfe Tone, a play, a memoir, a history book, and a so-called &quot;character study.&quot; He produced critical studies of the novel and the short-story form, introduced texts of historical and literary merit, and contributed scores of articles, reviews, and uncollected stories to periodicals in Ireland, Britain, and America. 

Most famously, he co-founded and edited the influential journal &quot;The Bell&quot; from 1940 to 1946. Under O’Faoláin’s editorship, &quot;The Bell&quot; participated in many key debates of the day; it also provided a crucial outlet for established and emerging writers during the lean war years. A recurring thread in Ó Faoláin’s work is the idea that national identities are historically produced and culturally hybrid; an additional thesis is that Irish history should be conceived in international terms, and that it should be read, in particular, in the context of social and intellectual developments across Europe. 

Ó Faoláin was a controversial figure in his lifetime and two of his books were banned for &quot;indecency&quot; in Ireland—his debut collection of short stories and his second novel, &quot;Bird Alone&quot; (1936). His legacy has proved divisive. If some consider him a social liberal cosmopolitan who challenged &quot;proscriptive&quot; definitions of Irish culture, others see him as a chauvinistic snob who paradoxically restricted the development of Irish writing. Proto-revisionist or nascent postcolonial, O’Faoláin has been considered both, sometimes within the same critical survey. Either way, his work was central to the evolution of a post–Literary Revival aesthetic, and his voice was one of the most prominent, and eloquent, in the fight against censorship in Ireland. 

==Personal life==
Ó Faoláin married Eileen Gould, a children&#x27;s book writer who published several books of Irish folk tales, in 1929. They had two children: Julia (1932–2020), who became a Booker-nominated novelist and short story writer, and Stephen (b. 1938).

<text>The 100 Club is a music venue located at 100 Oxford Street, London, England, where it has been hosting live music since 24 October 1942. It was originally called the Feldman Swing Club, but changed its name when the father of the current owner took over in 1964.

==Feldman Swing Club==
In 1942, the venue was a restaurant called Macks, which was hired out beginning 24 October every Sunday evening by Robert Feldman at £4 per night to host a jazz club featuring swing music. The initial line-up of the Feldman Swing Club advertised in &quot;Melody Maker&quot; included Frank Weir, Kenny Baker and Jimmy Skidmore, with guest artists the Feldman Trio, composed of Feldman&#x27;s children, including then eight-year-old jazz drummer Victor Feldman.

The club&#x27;s clientele included American GIs, who introduced jitterbug to the club, banned at most other music venues. Patrons included Glenn Miller, who auditioned young Victor Feldman, and the club hosted many top American jazz acts, including Mel Powell, Ray McKinley, Art Pepper, and Benny Goodman. Bebop as well as swing was featured. British musicians such as Ronnie Scott and Johnny Dankworth performed there. The club became a mecca for black musicians from the British Empire, such as Frank Holder, Coleridge Goode and Ray Ellington.

The club was eventually taken over by Humphrey Lyttelton&#x27;s manager and, during that period, Louis Armstrong appeared at the venue. The lease was sold on to Ted Morton, who promoted it as the Jazz Shows Jazz Club. During this period, jazz fan Roger Horton began working at the club and was promoted to manager in 1964.

==1970s onward==
Following the Trad boom and UK beat scene the club became associated with Punk rock. In September 1976, the 100 Club played host to the first international punk festival, an event which helped to push the then new punk rock movement from the underground into the mainstream. Bands which played at this event included the Sex Pistols, Siouxsie and the Banshees, The Clash, Buzzcocks, The Jam, The Stranglers and The Damned.

Under the promotion of Ron Watts, the venue then booked punk bands like Angelic Upstarts, U.K. Subs and The Adicts, as well as, from 1981 onwards, hardcore punk bands such as The Varukers, Black Flag, Discharge, Charged GBH, Crass, Picture Frame Seduction, Skrewdriver, English Dogs, etc. Several live albums were recorded at the club, including one by the Sex Pistols.

On 31 May 1982, The Rolling Stones played an unannounced show there as a warm-up for their European tour, and returned again on 23 February 1986 to play a tribute show for their recently deceased pianist Ian Stewart, a concert that was their only live performance between 1982 and 1989.

Other nights would see a range of jazz, rhythm-and-blues and soul groups on the stage, including a &quot;duel&quot; between tenor saxophonists Teddy Edwards and Dick Morrissey in the 1980s. Other notable jazz musicians, including Sonny Stitt, Lee Konitz and Archie Shepp, have also appeared at the club.

Manager Roger Horton eventually became a director, and in 1992 took over the ownership, handing it on to his son Jeffrey Horton when he retired in 2001.

==Northern soul==
The 100 Club has been the home to the world longest running Northern soul all-nighters, the 6t&#x27;s Rhythm &#x27;n&#x27; Soul Club, started by Randy Cozens and Ady Croasdell of Kent Records UK. The 6t&#x27;s had their 31st anniversary event on 18 September 2010.

==Modern era==

The decor remains unchanged since the 1970s, although punk bands no longer appear there regularly. Instead there is a busy programme often booked up many months in advance. Occasionally, big-name touring bands will play &quot;secret&quot; or low-key unadvertised gigs there, relying on word of mouth to fill the 350-capacity space. The &quot;Coda Club&quot;, a monthly social gathering of jazz musicians from the Feldman Swing Club era, continues to be held. Limelight changed the venue&#x27;s musical genre once again, providing &quot;classical music in a rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll setting&quot;, hosting new or well-established classical artists once a month, Since 1988, the London Swing Dance Society have held &quot;Stompin&quot; on Monday nights, a swing dancing evening with classes and regular live bands.

In 2009 Feldman&#x27;s Swing Club was named by the Brecon Jazz Festival as one of 12 venues which had made the most important contributions to jazz music in the United Kingdom, for its contributions in the 1942–1954 period.

In September 2010, it was announced that the 100 Club would close at the end of 2010 owing to continuing losses. A campaign was launched, the Save The 100 Club, to keep the venue open, supported by musicians including Paul McCartney, and in February 2011 a partnership with Nike subsidiary Converse was arranged, enabling the 100 Club to remain open.
DEF Digby were the first band to play at the venue in 2012.

Recent acts to headline The 100 Club include Shame, Alice Cooper, Fat White Family, Black Midi, The Specials, Sisteray, Babyshambles, Idles, Dr. Feelgood and Sleaford Mods.

In autumn 2023, veteran punk band the U.K. Subs played a five-night sold out residency at the 100 Club in a culmination of their final British tour. The residency was attended by Stuart Pearce, a lifelong fan of punk rock.
In June 2023, the Buzzcocks headlined at the 100 Club, a warm up gig to their upcoming tour without their guitarist/singer Pete Shelley who passed away earlier the same year.

<text>Arthur Louis Aaron (5 March 192213 August 1943) was a Royal Air Force pilot in the Second World War. He flew 90 operational flying hours and 19 sorties, and was awarded with the Distinguished Flying Medal and (posthumously) the Victoria Cross.

==Early life and wartime service==
Aaron was a native of Leeds, Yorkshire, and was educated at Roundhay School and Leeds School of Architecture. When the Second World War started in 1939, Aaron joined the Air Training Corps squadron at Leeds University. The following year he volunteered to train as aircrew in the Royal Air Force. He trained as a pilot in the United States at No. 1 British Flying Training School at Terrell Municipal Airport in Terrell, Texas. Aaron completed his pilot training on 15 September 1941 and returned to England to train at an Operation Conversion Unit before he joined No. 218 (Gold Coast) Squadron RAF, flying Short Stirling heavy bombers from RAF Downham Market.

His first operational sortie was a mining sortie in the Bay of Biscay, but he was soon flying missions over Germany. On one sortie, his Stirling was badly damaged, but he completed his bombing run and returned to England. His actions were rewarded with a Distinguished Flying Medal.

==VC action==
Aaron, 21 years old, was flying Stirling serial number EF452 on his 20th sortie. Nearing the target, his bomber was struck by machine gun fire. The bomber&#x27;s Canadian navigator (Cornelius A. Brennan) was killed, and other members of the crew were wounded.

The official citation for his VC reads:
The gunfire that hit Aaron&#x27;s aircraft was thought to have been from an enemy night fighter, but may have been friendly fire from another Stirling. Because of that the initial plan was to award him the George Cross, but prime minister Winston Churchill changed it to the Victoria Cross, because he did not want the enemy to know the RAF had shot down one of its own aircraft.

==Memorials==
He was an &#x27;old boy&#x27; of Roundhay School, Leeds (headmaster at the time was B.A. Farrow). There is a plaque in the main hall of the school to his memory incorporating the deed that merited the VC. On 5 March 2022 (Aaron&#x27;s 100th birthday) a Yorkshire Society blue plaque was unveiled at Roundhay School in memory of Aaron.

To mark the new millennium, Leeds Civic Trust organised a public vote to choose a statue to mark the occasion, and to publicise the city&#x27;s past heroes and heroines. Candidates included Benjamin Henry Latrobe and Henry Moore. Arthur Aaron won the vote, with Don Revie beating Joshua Tetley and Frankie Vaughan as runner-up. Located on a roundabout on the eastern edge of the city centre, close to the West Yorkshire Playhouse, the statue of Aaron was unveiled on 24 March 2001 by Malcolm Mitchem, the last survivor of the aircraft. The five-metre bronze sculpture by Graham Ibbeson takes the form of Aaron standing next to a tree, up which are climbing three children progressively representing the passage of time between 1950 and 2000, with the last a girl releasing a dove of peace, all representing the freedom his sacrifice helped ensure. There was controversy about the siting of the statue, and it was proposed to transfer it to Millennium Square outside Leeds City Museum. However, the statue remains on the roundabout.

Aaron&#x27;s Victoria Cross and other medals are kept at Leeds City Museum.

Controversially , he was commemorated at the AJEX Jewish Military Museum in Hendon, London, as one of three known Jewish Victoria Cross recipients of the Second World War (the others being Thomas William Gould, Royal Navy, and John Kenneally, Irish Guards). Aaron may have belonged at school or University to 319 ATC (Jewish) Squadron in Broughton, Salford, where his photograph still hangs, according to Col Martin Newman DL from the HQ Air Cadets archives.

==Genealogical controversy==
Genealogical research carried out in 2018–2019 by David Rattee shows Arthur Louis Aaron was baptised a Roman Catholic on 15 October 1922 at St. Mary&#x27;s Church, Knaresborough, North Yorkshire. The baptism record is held in the archives of Ampleforth Abbey Trust. Aaron&#x27;s father Benjamin gave his own religion as Church of England on his WWI army records. Aaron&#x27;s parents, Benjamin Aaron and Rosalie Marie Aaron ( Marney) were married on 8 February 1919 at Addingham Parish Church, near Ilkley. Benjamin Aaron was born on 29 June 1891 at 29 Dewsbury Road, Hunslet, Leeds, West Yorkshire, and baptised on 2 August 1891 at St Mary the Virgin, Hunslet Parish Church, Leeds. Birth, baptism, marriage, death, census records and other published period documentation trace the paternal surname back to William Aaron (b. 1802 Hillam, near Sherburn-in-Elmet, d. 27 September 1877) and Faith Harrison (27 August 17961 June 1866) of Sherburn, North Yorkshire. Aaron was a common surname in Yorkshire well before Jewish immigration to Leeds began. 

It has been stated that Aaron&#x27;s father was a Russian Jewish immigrant, even though the family denied it after Aaron was killed, giving him a Roman Catholic memorial service; it has also been claimed that he boasted of being Jewish to members of his air training colleagues in the mess in Texas on many occasions. A possible cause of the confusion, of which there is no traceable documentation, is that Aaron may have been taken to be Jewish before his death due to his name, and/or passed himself as Jewish in Leeds, or in the RAF.

<doc id="757953" wikidata="Q833460" url="?curid=757953" title="Trench effect">
<text>The trench effect is a combination of circumstances that can rush a fire up an inclined surface. It depends on two well-understood but separate ideas: the Coandă effect from fluid dynamics and the flashover concept from fire dynamics:

* The Coandă effect is the tendency of a fast stream of gases to bend towards, and adhere to, nearby surfaces. The stream&#x27;s static pressure tends to decrease, which creates a pressure difference between the surface and areas far from it. This bends the stream towards the surface and tends to keep it attached to that surface.
* Flashover is a sudden widespread fire, which occurs when most surfaces in a space are heated until they emit flammable gases hot enough to auto-ignite. Before flashover, flammable gases may be emitted but are too cool to ignite.

The trench effect occurs when a fire burns beside a steeply inclined surface. The flames lie down along the surface, demonstrating the Coandă effect. The flames heat the material farther up: these emit gases that autoignite in a flashover event. The flames from these areas are themselves subject to the Coandă effect and blow a jet of flame up to the end of the inclined surface. This jet continues until the fuel depletes.

==Background==
The trench effect became known because of the scientific investigation of the King&#x27;s Cross fire, which occurred on the London Underground in 1987. The fire started on an escalator (containing wood and years of built-up grease) between the Piccadilly line platforms and the ticket hall at King&#x27;s Cross St Pancras tube station. Many eyewitnesses indicated that early on, the fire in the escalator was of manageable size: officers from the Fire Brigade and British Transport Police indicated that the fire appeared no larger than a large cardboard box burning. Those present were surprised when it suddenly threw a sustained jet of flame into the ticket hall. The Coandă effect alone could not explain the sudden blast that blew some survivors off their feet.

The relatively inconspicuous flames associated with the Coandă effect, hugging the space on and under the inclined trench of the escalator steps, led many travellers to believe they were not in immediate danger. One survivor reported approaching the escalator and noting thick black smoke that suddenly blew up. The main loss of life came from the sudden flashover, rather than the precipitating flames of the &#x27;Coandă effect&#x27; fire itself. The people in the ticket hall at the top of the escalators, whilst avoiding the visible flames, were caught in the path of the flashover. 

In the early stages of the fire, most of the flames were lying down in the escalator trench: only a few visibly protruded above the balustrade. The sides of the trench further enhanced the effect by preventing heat loss by radiation to the side, insulating and concentrating the heat along the narrow trench. Emergency services were not prepared for a major fire, due to the lack of visible flames. When the treads of the escalator flashed over, the fire grew dramatically and ignited most of the ticket hall. The Health and Safety Executive&#x27;s Health and Safety Laboratory in Buxton lit fires in -scale and -scale models of the escalator and ticket hall, which demonstrated that the trench effect was the main cause of the intensity and rapid spread of the King&#x27;s Cross fire. The sudden flashover may be attributed to the wood gas (mainly methane) emitted from the pyrolysis of the wooden escalator itself. When the concentration of gas reaches a critical value, the lower flammable limit, the gas suddenly catches fire in the presence of a flame, resulting in an explosion. 

An episode of the television series &quot;Forensic Files&quot; entitled &quot;Flashover&quot; detailed the King&#x27;s Cross fire, along with the computer modelling and other analyses which discovered the trench effect. An episode of the television series &quot;Seconds from Disaster&quot; entitled &quot;London&#x27;s Subway Inferno&quot; detailed both the King&#x27;s Cross Fire based on eyewitness accounts and the investigation leading up to the discovery of the trench effect.

The trench effect has also been cited as the cause of rapid spread of wildfires up hills, which has led on several notorious occasions to the deaths of multiple firefighters.

They were based in Viera, Florida, and played their home games at Space Coast Stadium. The team left Brevard County after the 2016 season for Kissimmee, Florida, where they began play in 2017 as the Florida Fire Frogs.

The team′s mascot was a manatee. From 1994 to 2001, he was named Hugh Manatee (a pun on &quot;humanity&quot;), and from 2002 to 2016 he was known as Manny Manatee.

==Team history==
In 1994, the Manatees won the East Division title, but lost the Florida State League championship series to the Tampa Yankees in four games. They won the East Division again in 2001, but due to the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks the league championship series was canceled and the Manatees and the West Division champion, the Tampa Yankees, were declared co-champions. In 2007, the Manatees won the North Division title but lost in the league championship series to the Clearwater Threshers in four games.

On August 12, 2009, the Manatees recorded the 1,000th win in franchise history with an 8–2 win over the Dunedin Blue Jays.

The Manatees were affiliated with the Florida Marlins from 1994 to 2001 and with the Montreal Expos from 2002 through 2004. From 2005 through 2016, they were an affiliate of the Milwaukee Brewers.

The Manatees played their last game on September 4, 2016, losing to the Daytona Tortugas 6–4 before a crowd of 1,573 at Space Coast Stadium. After the 2016 season, the team relocated to Kissimmee, Florida, to play its home games at Osceola County Stadium. The name of the team changed to the Florida Fire Frogs and its affiliation switched from the Brewers to the Atlanta Braves.

==Notable promotions==
In April 2007, on &quot;World Record First Pitch Attempt Day&quot; the stadium was opened at 6:00 a.m. for the 7:00 p.m. game to allow each fan to throw a ceremonial first pitch. They were still short of the world record by several hundred pitches.

<text>Rao Abdul Hafiz Khan (4 September 19256 April 1944) was an Indian recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. He was the youngest Indian recipient of the award.

His was one of three World War II VC&#x27;s awarded for action in British India, the others being awarded to John Pennington Harman and John Niel Randle both at the Battle of Kohima.

== Details ==

Rao Abdul Hafiz hailed from Kalanaur, British Punjab, born on the 4th of September, 1925 to Choudhry Nur Mohammed in a Rajput family of the Panwar clan. He was at the age of 18, and serving as Naib Subedar in the 9th Jat Regiment, British Indian Army during World War II, when he performed the deeds for which he was awarded the VC.

On 6 April 1944, during the Battle of Imphal, Naib Subedar Rao Abdul Hafiz Khan was ordered to attack with his platoon a prominent position held by the enemy, the only approach to which was across a bare slope and then up a very steep hill. The Naib Subedar led the assault, himself killing several of the enemy, pressing on regardless of machine-gun fire. He received two wounds, the second of which was fatal; but he had succeeded in routing an enemy vastly superior in numbers, and had captured a most important position.

The citation reads as follows:

== The Medal ==
His VC is on display in the Lord Ashcroft Gallery at the Imperial War Museum, London.

<doc id="757963" wikidata="Q1423499" url="?curid=757963" title="Radiofax">
<text>Radiofacsimile, radiofax or HF fax is an analogue mode for transmitting grayscale images via high frequency (HF) radio waves. It was the predecessor to slow-scan television (SSTV). It was the primary method of sending photographs from remote sites (especially islands) from the 1930s to the early 1970s. It is still in limited use for transmitting weather charts and information to ships at sea.

==History==

Richard H. Ranger, an electrical engineer working at Radio Corporation of America (RCA), invented a method for sending photographs through radio transmissions. He called his system the wireless photoradiogram, in contrast to the fifty-year-old telefacsimile devices which used first telegraphic wires, and then later was adapted to use the newer telephone wires.

On 29 November 1924, Ranger&#x27;s system was used to send a photograph from New York City to London. It was an image of President Calvin Coolidge and was the first transoceanic radio transmission of a photograph. Also that year, AT&amp;T engineer Herbert E. Ives transmitted the first color photograph.

Charles J. Young, son of the RCA founder Owen D. Young, and Ernst Alexanderson, developed a radio facsimile system for General Electric. On 12 August 1931 this system successfully transmitted a copy of the &quot;Union-Star&quot; newspaper of Schenectady, New York to the transatlantic liners and . It took 15 minutes to copy a single page measuring .

Beginning in the late 1930s, the Finch Facsimile system was used to transmit a &quot;radio newspaper&quot; to private homes via commercial AM radio stations and ordinary radio receivers equipped with Finch&#x27;s printer, which used thermal paper. Sensing a new and potentially golden opportunity, competitors soon entered the field, but the printer and special paper were expensive luxuries, AM radio transmission was very slow and vulnerable to static, and the newspaper was too small. After more than ten years of repeated attempts by Finch and others to establish such a service as a viable business, the public, apparently quite content with its cheaper and much more substantial home-delivered daily newspapers, and with conventional spoken radio bulletins to provide any &quot;hot&quot; news, still showed only a passing curiosity about the new medium.

During World War II thousands of photographs were transmitted from Europe, and from the Pacific Islands, to the United States. The major news agencies (AP, UPI, Reuters), maintained their own transoceanic radio facsimile transmitters as close to the action as they could. The iconic flag raising on Iwo Jima was printed in hundreds of American newspapers within a day of being taken, because it was transmitted from Guam to New York City by wireless radiofacsimile, a distance of 12,781 km (7,942 mi).

By the late 1940s, radiofax receivers were sufficiently miniaturized to be fitted beneath the dashboard of Western Union&#x27;s &quot;Telecar&quot; telegram delivery vehicles.

In the 1960s, the United States Army transmitted the first photograph via satellite facsimile to Puerto Rico from the Deal Test Site using the Courier satellite.

==Weatherfax==
A decade after the introduction of radiofax National Weather Service (NWS) began transmitting weather maps using the radiofax technology. The NWS named this new service weatherfax (portmanteau word from the words &quot;weather facsimile&quot;) The cover of the regular NOAA publication on frequencies and schedules states &quot;Worldwide Marine Radiofacsimile Broadcast Schedules&quot;.

Facsimile machines were used in the 1950s to transmit weather charts across the United States via land-lines first and then internationally via HF radio. Radio transmission of weather charts provides an enormous amount of flexibility to marine and aviation users for they now have the latest weather information and forecasts at their fingertips to use in the planning of voyages.

Radiofax relies on facsimile technology where printed information is scanned line by line and encoded into an electrical signal which can then be transmitted via physical line or radio waves to remote locations. Since the amount of information transmitted per unit time is directly proportional to the bandwidth available, then the speed at which a weather chart can be transmitted will vary depending on the quality of the media used for transmission.

Today radiofax data is available via FTP downloads from sites in the Internet such as the ones hosted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Radiofax transmissions are also broadcast by NOAA from multiple sites in the country at regular daily schedules. Radio weatherfax transmissions are particularly useful to shipping, where there are limited facilities for accessing the Internet.

The term weatherfax was coined after the technology that allows the transmission and reception of weather charts (surface analysis, forecasts, and others) from a transmission site (usually the meteorological office) to a remote site (where the actual users are).

== Newspaper fax ==

Radiofax may also be used to transmit pages of newspapers. Stations like JJC use this way of transmitting news by using radio facsimile technology. It can be used to transmitted all kinds of such newspaper pages.
==Transmission details==
Radiofax is transmitted in single sideband which is a refinement of amplitude modulation. The signal shifts up or down a given amount to designate white or black pixels. A deviation less than that for a white or black pixel is taken to be a shade of grey. With correct tuning (1.9 kHz below the assigned frequency for USB, above for LSB), the signal shares some characteristics with SSTV, with black at 1.5 kHz and peak white at 2.3 kHz.

Usually, 120 lines per minute (LPM) are sent (For monochrome fax, possible values are: 60, 90, 100, 120, 180, 240. For colour fax, LPM can be: 120, 240). A value known as the &quot;index of cooperation&quot; (IOC) must also be known to decode a radio fax transmission - this governs the image resolution, and derives from early radio fax machines which used drum readers, and is the product of the total line length and the number of lines per unit length (known sometimes as the &quot;factor of cooperation&quot;), divided by π. Usually the IOC is 576.

==Automatic Picture Transmission format (APT)==

APT format permits unattended monitoring of services. It is employed by most terrestrial weather facsimile stations as well as geostationary weather satellites.

* The start tone triggers the receiving system. It was originally meant to allow enough time for the drum of mechanical systems to get up to speed. It consists of rapid modulation of the video carrier, resulting in a characteristic rasp-like sound.
* The phasing signal, consisting of a periodic pulse, synchronizes the receiver so that the image will be centered on the paper.
* The stop tone, optionally followed by black, marks the end of the transmission.

==Stations==
Today, radiofax is primarily used worldwide for the dissemination of weather charts, satellite weather images, and forecasts to ships at sea. The oceans are covered by coastal stations in various countries.

In the United States, fax weather products are prepared by a number of offices, branches, and agencies within the National Weather Service (NWS) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

Tropical and hurricane products come from the Tropical Analysis and Forecast Branch, part of the Tropical Prediction Center/National Hurricane Center. They are broadcast over US Coast Guard communication stations NMG, in New Orleans, LA, and NMC, the Pacific master station on Point Reyes, California. After Hurricane Katrina damaged NMG, the Boston Coast Guard station NMF added a limited schedule of tropical warning charts. NMG is back at full capability, but NMF continues to broadcast these.

All other products come from the Ocean Prediction Center (OPC) of the NWS, in cooperation with several other offices depending on the region and nature of information. These also use NMG, NMC, and NMF, plus Coast Guard station NOJ in Kodiak, Alaska, and Department of Defense station KVM70 in Hawaii.

Ever since the loss of the RMS &quot;Titanic&quot; highlighted the dangers of icebergs in the North Atlantic, an International Ice Patrol has also originated weather data, and its charts are broadcast by the Boston station during the prime iceberg season of February through September, using the call sign NIK.

CBV, Playa Ancha Radio in Valparaiso, Chile broadcasts a daily schedule of Armada de Chile weather fax for the southeastern Pacific, all the way to the Antarctic. Also in the Pacific, Japan has two stations, as does the Bureau of Meteorology in Australia. Most European countries have stations, as does Russia.

Kyodo News is the only remaining news agency to transmit news via radiofax. It broadcasts complete newspapers in Japanese and English, often at 60 lines per minute instead of the more normal 120 because of the greater complexity of written Japanese. A full day&#x27;s news takes dozens of minutes to transmit. Kyodo has a dedicated transmission to Pacific fishing fleets from Kagoshima Prefectural Fishery Radio, and a relay from 9VF/252, which is said to be located in Singapore. These transmitters are considerably more powerful than others used for this mode.

The German Meteorological Service (Deutscher Wetterdienst, DWD) transmits a regular daily schedule of weather charts on three frequencies 3.855 MHz, 7.88 MHz and 13.8825 MHz from their LF and HF transmitting facility in Pinneberg.

==History==
*1911: The first amplitude modulator for fax machines is patented, permitting transmission via telephone lines.
*1913: Edouard Belin&#x27;s Belinograph

*1922–1925: RCA faxes photos across the Atlantic in six minutes; AT&amp;T, RCA and Western Union develop &quot;high-speed&quot; fax systems. Arthur Korn&#x27;s facsimile system is used to transmit, by radio, a photograph of Pope Pius XI from Rome to Maine, US. The picture is published the same day in the New York World newspaper—a major feat in an era when news pictures crossed the ocean by ship.

<doc id="757965" wikidata="Q2335415" url="?curid=757965" title="Cyril Connolly">
<text>Cyril Vernon Connolly CBE (10 September 1903 – 26 November 1974) was an English literary critic and writer. He was the editor of the influential literary magazine &quot;Horizon&quot; (1940–49) and wrote &quot;Enemies of Promise&quot; (1938), which combined literary criticism with an autobiographical exploration of why he failed to become the successful author of fiction that he had aspired to be in his youth.

==Early life==
Cyril Connolly was born in Coventry, Warwickshire. He was the only child of Major Matthew William Kemble Connolly (1872–1947), an officer in the King&#x27;s Own Yorkshire Light Infantry, by his Anglo-Irish wife, Muriel Maud Vernon, daughter of Colonel Edward Vernon (1838–1913) J.P., D.L., of Clontarf Castle, County Dublin. His parents had met while his father was serving in Ireland, and his father&#x27;s next posting was to South Africa. Connolly&#x27;s father was also a malacologist (the scientific study of the Mollusca, i.e. snails, clams, octopus, etc.) and mineral collector of some reputation and collected many samples in Africa. Cyril Connolly&#x27;s childhood days were spent with his father in South Africa, with his mother&#x27;s family at Clontarf Castle, and with his paternal grandmother in Bath, Somerset, and other parts of England.

Connolly was educated at St Cyprian&#x27;s School, Eastbourne, where he enjoyed the company of George Orwell and Cecil Beaton. He was a favourite of the formidable headmistress Mrs Wilkes but was later to criticise the &quot;character-building&quot; ethos of the school. He wrote, &quot;Orwell proved to me that there existed an alternative to character, Intelligence. Beaton showed me another, Sensibility.&quot; Connolly won the Harrow History Prize, pushing Orwell into second place, and the English prize leaving Orwell with Classics. He then won a scholarship to Eton, a year after Orwell.

==Eton==
At Eton, after a traumatic first few terms, he settled into a comfortable routine. He won over his early tormentor Godfrey Meynell and became a popular wit. In 1919 his parents moved to The Lock House on the Basingstoke Canal at Frimley Green. At Eton, Connolly was involved in romantic intrigues and school politics, which he described in &quot;Enemies of Promise&quot;.

He established a reputation as an intellectual and earned the respect of Dadie Rylands and Denis King-Farlow. Connolly&#x27;s particular circle included Denis Dannreuther, Bobbie Longden and Roger Mynors. In summer 1921, his father took him on a holiday to France, initiating Connolly&#x27;s love of travel. The following winter he went with his mother to Mürren, where he became friends with Anthony Knebworth.

By this time his parents were living separate lives, his mother having established a relationship with another army officer and his father becoming an increasingly heavy drinker and absorbed in his study of slugs and snails. In 1922, Connolly achieved academic success winning the Rosebery History Prize, and followed by the Brackenbury History scholarship to Balliol College, Oxford. In the spring, he visited St Cyprian&#x27;s to report his achievement to his old headmaster before setting off on a trip to Spain with a school friend.

Returning moneyless, he spent the night in a kip at St Martins, London. In his last term at Eton, he was elected to Pop, which brought him into contact with others he respected, including Nico Davies, Teddy Jessel and Lord Dunglass. He established rapport with Brian Howard, but, he concluded, &quot;moral cowardice and academic outlook debarred him from making friends with Harold Acton, Oliver Messel, Robert Byron, Henry Green and Anthony Powell&quot;. Connolly was for years afterwards nostalgic about his time at Eton.

==Oxford==
Connolly undertook a tour of Germany, Austria and Hungary before starting at Oxford University. After his cloistered existence as a King&#x27;s Scholar at Eton, Connolly felt uncomfortable with the hearty beer-drinking rugby and rowing types at Oxford. His own circle included his Eton friends Mynors and Dannreuther, who were at Balliol with him, and Kenneth Clark, whom he met through Bobbie Longden at Kings. He wrote: &quot;The only exercise we took was running up bills.&quot; His intellectual mentors were the Dean of Balliol, Francis Fortescue Urquhart, often referred to as &quot;Sligger&quot;, who organised reading parties on the continent, and the Dean of Wadham, Maurice Bowra.

Connolly&#x27;s academic career languished while his Oxford years were characterised by his travel adventures. In January 1923, he went with Urquhart and other collegers to Italy. In March, he undertook his annual visit to Spain and in September, he went on the annual trip with the college group to Urquhart&#x27;s chalet in French Alps. On his return, he visited his father, now in a hotel in South Kensington, close to the Natural History Museum. At the end of the year, he went to Italy and Tunis. At Oxford, in 1924, he made a new friend Patrick Balfour, in the spring he went to Spain and in the summer of 1924, he went successively to Greece and Crete, Urquhart&#x27;s chalet in the Alps and Naples. He spent Christmas with his parents in a rare get-together at the Lock House in Hampshire and at the beginning of 1925, he went with the college group to Minehead with Urquhart.

In his last year at Oxford, he was cultivating friendships with younger students Anthony Powell, Henry Yorke and Peter Quennell. In spring he was back in Spain, before returning to Oxford to take his final exams.

==Drifting==
Connolly left Balliol in 1925 with a third class degree in history. He struggled to find employment, while his friends and family sought to pay off his extensive debts. In summer he went for his annual stay at Urquhart&#x27;s chalet in the French Alps, and in the autumn went to Spain and Portugal. He obtained a post tutoring a boy in Jamaica and set sail for the Caribbean in November 1925. He returned to England in April 1926 on a banana boat in the company of Alwyn Williams, headmaster of Winchester College. He enrolled as a special constable in the General Strike, but it was over before he was actively involved. He responded to an advertisement to work as a secretary for Montague Summers but was warned off by his friends. Then in June 1926 he found a post as a secretary/companion to Logan Pearsall Smith, who was based in Chelsea and also had a house called Big Chilling near Warsash in Hampshire, overlooking the Solent. Pearsall Smith was to give Connolly an important introduction to literary life, and he influenced his ideas on the role of a writer with a distaste for journalism. Pearsall Smith gave Connolly £8 a week, whether Smith was around or not, and moreover gave him the run of Big Chilling.

==Beginning of literary career==
In August 1926, Connolly met Desmond MacCarthy, who had come to stay at Big Chilling. MacCarthy was the literary editor of the &quot;New Statesman&quot; and was to be another major influence on Connolly&#x27;s development. MacCarthy invited Connolly to write book reviews for the &quot;New Statesman&quot;. Later that year, Connolly made a trip to Budapest and Eastern Europe and then spent the winter of 1926–1927 in London. Pearsall Smith took Connolly with him to Spain in the spring, and Connolly then set off on his own to North Africa and Italy. They met up again in Florence, where Kenneth Clark was working with Bernard Berenson, who had married Pearsall Smith&#x27;s sister.

Connolly departed for Sicily then returned to England via Vienna, :Prague and Dresden. Connolly&#x27;s first signed work in the &quot;New Statesman&quot;, a review of Laurence Sterne, appeared in June 1927. In July he set off to Normandy with his mother and then for his last stay at the chalet in the Alps. In August 1927, he was invited to become a regular reviewer and joined the staff of the &quot;New Statesman&quot;. His first review in September was of &quot;The Hotel&quot; by Elizabeth Bowen. Also in September, Connolly moved into a flat at Yeoman&#x27;s Row with Patrick Balfour. He was working on various works that never saw the light of day: a novel &quot;Green Endings&quot;, a travel book on Spain, his diary and &quot;A Partial Guide to the Balkans&quot;. He approached Cecil Beaton to draw the cover design for the last and he received an advance for the work although it was eventually lost.

However, he started contributing pieces to various publications that appeared under his own name and various pseudonyms. At this time he developed a fascination with low life and prostitution and spent time in the poorer parts of London seeking them out (while other contemporaries were seeking out tramps). At the same time, he had developed an infatuation with Alix Kilroy whom he had met on a train back from the continent and used to wait outside her office for a sight of her. He then made a more positive romantic approach to Racy Fisher, one of a pair of nieces of Desmond MacCarthy&#x27;s wife, Molly. Unfortunately, their father, Admiral Fisher, wanted them to have nothing to do with a penniless writer and, in February 1928, forbade further contact.

Sharing a flat with Balfour, Connolly&#x27;s social circle expanded with new friends like Bob Boothby and Gladwyn Jebb. However, he was ill at ease and in April 1928 set off for Paris, where he met Pearsall Smith and Cecil Beaton and visited brothels posing as a journalist. He went on to Italy, where he stayed with Berenson and Mrs Keppel where he was taken with her daughter Violet Trefusis. Then via Venice and East European cities he made his way to Berlin to meet up with Jebb.

Jebb and Connolly stayed with Harold Nicolson in the company of Ivor Novello and Christopher Sykes and then made a tour of Germany. Connolly returned to Paris in May, borrowing money from Pearsall Smith so he could live cheaply in the rue Delambre. In Paris, he met Mara Andrews, a poetic lesbian who was in love with an absent American girl called Jean Bakewell. On the way back to London, Connolly stayed with Nicolson and his wife, Vita Sackville-West, at Sissinghurst.

In August Connolly set off on his travels again to Germany, this time with Bobbie Longden and Raymond Mortimer and the experience gave rise to the essay &quot;Conversations in Berlin&quot; which MacCarthy published in his new magazine &quot;Life and Letters&quot;. Connolly travelled separately to Villefranche and spent five weeks in Barcelona with Longden before returning to London. Boothby lent him his London flat and he shared Gerald Brenan&#x27;s fascination with working-class prostitutes with experiences that appeared in his fragment for a novel &quot;The English Malady&quot;. He spent Christmas at Sledmere with the Sykes family.

At the beginning of 1929, Connolly went briefly to Paris and just before returning to London, he met Jean Bakewell and stayed an extra night to get to know her. After a while, he was drawn to Paris again and, through Jean and Mara, became acquainted with the bohemian Montparnasse set, including Alfred Perles and Gregor Michonze who was to become the basis for Rascasse in &quot;The Rock Pool&quot;. He also met James Joyce about whom he wrote &quot;The Position of Joyce&quot; which appeared in &quot;Life and Letters&quot;. Connolly and Bakewell went to Spain together where they met up with Peter Quennell. Connolly then went to Berlin to stay with Nicolson until the latter managed to remove him as &quot;not perhaps the ideal guest&quot;.

Unable to return to Big Chilling, he was stuck in Berlin for a month before returning to London. John Betjeman had moved into his room at Yeoman&#x27;s Row, so he went to stay with Enid Bagnold at Rottingdean before visiting Dorset with Quennell. Bakewell had returned to America in the summer and was planning to return to Paris in the autumn to start a course at the Sorbonne. She had agreed before her departure to marry Connolly and Connolly established himself in Paris in September. They spent most of the rest of the year in Paris, and started their collection of pets, first ferrets and then lemurs. Connolly spent Christmas again at Sledmere.

==First marriage==
In February 1930, aged 26, Connolly and Bakewell set off for America. They married in New York on 5 April 1930. Jean Bakewell &quot;was to prove one of the more liberating forces in his life... an uncomplicated hedonist, independent, adventurous, celebrating the moment... An attractive personality: warm, generous, witty and approachable...&quot; She provided modest financial support that enabled him to enjoy travels, particularly around the Mediterranean, hospitality and good food and drink. The newly married couple lived in various spots in England including the Cavendish Hotel, Bury Street, Bath, and Big Chilling, before in July 1930 settling at Sanary, near Toulon, in France. There their close neighbours were Edith Wharton and Aldous Huxley.

Although Connolly admired Huxley, the two men failed to establish a rapport, and the wives fell out. Connolly&#x27;s bohemian home with the disorder of the lemurs was shunned and with debts rising they were forced to scrounge off Jean&#x27;s mother. Sometime in 1931, they left Sanary and toured Provence, Normandy, Brittany, Spain, Morocco and Majorca, before returning to Chagford, Devon. In November, they found a flat near Belgrave Square, and Connolly made his first contribution to the &quot;New Statesman&quot; in two years.

Connolly was also approached by John Betjeman of the &quot;Architectural Review&quot; to act as an art critic. Connolly&#x27;s art critiques appeared in the magazine in 1932, and he visited Betjeman at his home at Uffington. There, he would meet Evelyn Waugh, who delighted in teasing Connolly. The Connollys enjoyed being part of a sophisticated literary social scene in London, but towards the end of the year, Jean had to undergo a gynaecological operation. As a result, she could not have a child, and it was hard for her to control her weight.

In February 1933, Connolly took Jean to Greece to recover, where they met Brian Howard. While they were in Athens there was an attempted coup d&#x27;état, which Connolly later reported in the &quot;New Statesman&quot; as &quot;Spring Revolution&quot;. The Connollys then went with Howard and his boyfriend to Spain and the Algarve. After a row in a bar, they were incarcerated in a police cell and were sent back to England with the help of the British Embassy. In June, encouraged by Enid Bagnold, they rented a house at Rottingdean.

Writing to Bagnold from Cannes in September, Jean complained that their cheques were being bounced and she asked Bagnold to appeal to her husband Sir Roderick Jones of Reuters for help in work. That was dismissed, and in November, the letting agents for the Rottingdean property wrote an appalling report on the state in which the Connollys had left the place.

Early in 1934, the Connollys took a flat at 312A King&#x27;s Road, where they entertained their friends, including Waugh and Quennell. Elizabeth Bowen arranged a dinner with Virginia Woolf and her husband when Connolly and Virginia Woolf took an instant dislike to each other.

During the year, the Connollys went to Mallow and Cork in Ireland. At the end of the year. Connolly met Dylan Thomas at a party and early in 1935 invited him in the company of Anthony Powell, Waugh, Robert Byron and Desmond and Mollie McCarthy. By then, Connolly&#x27;s father was finding himself short of funds and was no longer prepared to bail out his son. However, Mrs Warner, Jean&#x27;s mother, funded an expedition to Paris, Juan-les-Pins, Venice, Yugoslavia and Budapest. In Paris, Connolly spent some time with Jack Kahane, the avant garde publisher, and Henry Miller, with whom he established a strong rapport after an initial unsuccessful meeting. In Budapest, they found themselves in the same hotel as Edward, Prince of Wales and Wallis Simpson.

In 1934, Connolly was working on a trilogy: &quot;Humane Killer&quot;, &quot;The English Malady&quot; and &quot;The Rock Pool&quot;. Only &quot;The Rock Pool&quot; was completed, the others remaining only as fragments.

==First books==
Connolly&#x27;s only novel, &quot;The Rock Pool&quot; (1936), is a satirical work describing a covey of dissolute drifters at an end of season French seaside resort, which was based on his experiences in the south of France. It was initially accepted by a London publishing house but it changed its mind. Faber and Faber was one of the publishers that rejected it and so Connolly took it to Jack Kahane, who published it in Paris in 1936.

Connolly followed it up with a book of non-fiction, &quot;Enemies of Promise&quot; (1938), the second half of which is autobiographical. In it he attempted to explain his failure to produce the literary masterpiece that he and others believed that he should have been capable of writing.

==&quot;Horizon&quot;==
In 1940, Connolly founded the influential literary magazine &quot;Horizon&quot;, with Peter Watson, its financial backer and &quot;de facto&quot; art editor. He edited &quot;Horizon&quot; until 1950, with Stephen Spender as an uncredited associate editor until early 1941. He was briefly (1942–1943) the literary editor for &quot;The Observer&quot; until a disagreement with David Astor. During World War II, he wrote &quot;The Unquiet Grave&quot;, a noteworthy collection of observations and quotes, under the pseudonym &#x27;Palinurus&#x27;.

From 1952 until his death, he was joint chief book reviewer (with Raymond Mortimer) for &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;.

In 1962, Connolly wrote &quot;Bond Strikes Camp&quot;, a spoof account of Ian Fleming&#x27;s character engaged in heroic escapades of dubious propriety as suggested by the title and written with Fleming&#x27;s support. It appeared in &quot;London Magazine&quot; and in an expensive limited edition printed by the Shenval Press, Frith Street, London. It later appeared in &quot;Previous Convictions&quot;.

Connolly had previously collaborated with Fleming in 1952 in writing an account of the Cambridge Spies Guy Burgess and Donald MacLean entitled &quot;The Missing Diplomats&quot;, an early publication for Fleming&#x27;s Queen Anne Press.

==Personal life==
Connolly was married three times. His first wife Jean Bakewell (1910–1950) left him in 1939, moving back to the United States. She later became the wife of Laurence Vail (former husband of Peggy Guggenheim and Kay Boyle) but, following years of health problems, she died of a stroke while on a trip to Paris at the age of 39.

Connolly married his second wife, Barbara Skelton, in 1950. The marriage ended in 1956. His third wife, whom he married in 1959, was Deirdre Craven (1931–2023), a granddaughter of James Craig, 1st Viscount Craigavon, by whom he had two children later in life, including the writer Cressida Connolly (born 1960). Through his daughter Cressida, Connolly is the paternal grandfather of the English actress Nell Hudson. After Connolly&#x27;s death in 1974, his widow married Peter Levi.

In 1967, Connolly settled in Eastbourne, to the amusement of Beaton, who suggested he was lured back by the cakes they had enjoyed in school outings to the town. He died on 26 November 1974, having continued to the end as a &quot;Sunday Times&quot; journalist, and was buried in Berwick churchyard, Sussex. His grave bears the inscription &quot;Intus aquae dulces vivoque sedilia saxo&quot; (&quot;Aeneid&quot; book IX: &quot;Within, fresh water and seats in the living rock.&quot;)

Since 1976, Connolly&#x27;s papers and personal library of over 8,000 books have been housed at the University of Tulsa.

==Assessment==
In &quot;The Unquiet Grave&quot; Connolly writes: &quot;Approaching forty, sense of total failure:... Never will I make that extra effort to live according to reality which alone makes good writing possible: hence the manic-depressiveness of my style,—which is either bright, cruel and superficial; or pessimistic; moth-eaten with self-pity.&quot;

Kenneth Tynan, writing in the March 1954 &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;, praised Connolly&#x27;s style as &#x27;one of the most glittering of English literary possessions.&#x27;

David Mason, in an essay on crime and booksellers, asserts that Connolly had a reputation amongst booksellers as a conniving thief: &quot;That a man so important to modern literature acted so shoddily as to break an honourable code of conduct and steal from booksellers who had trusted him.&quot;

==References in popular culture==

*Cyril Connolly&#x27;s name appears in a coda to the Monty Python song &quot;Eric the Half-a-Bee&quot;, as a mishearing of the words &quot;semi-carnally&quot;. Despite being corrected, the backing vocalists then sing &quot;Cyril Connolly&quot; to the melody of the song. The same comedians made another reference to Connolly in &quot;The Brand New Monty Python Bok&quot;, which includes a facsimile Penguin paperback, &quot;Norman Henderson&#x27;s Diary&quot;, complete with (invented) praise from Connolly.
*The critic and publisher Everard Spruce in Evelyn Waugh&#x27;s &quot;Sword of Honour&quot; trilogy is a satire of Connolly.
*Ed Spain, &quot;the Captain&quot; in Nancy Mitford&#x27;s 1951 novel &quot;The Blessing&quot; is a satire of Connolly.
*Michael Nelson&#x27;s novel &quot;A Room in Chelsea Square&quot; (1958) is a thinly disguised homosexualised account about Connolly&#x27;s time editing &quot;Horizon&quot;.
*Elaine Dundy&#x27;s novel &quot;The Old Man and Me&quot; (1964) is based on her affair with Connolly.
*A film producer in Julian MacLaren-Ross&#x27;s 1964 thriller &quot;My Name is Love&quot; is based on Connolly. MacLaren-Ross repeated many of the descriptions verbatim in his later memoir of Connolly.
*Connolly is quoted as saying &quot;Better to write for yourself and have no public than to write for the public and have no self&quot; in Season 5, Episode 7 of &quot;Criminal Minds&quot;.
*Since the film &quot;A Business Affair&quot; (1994) is adapted from Barbara Skelton&#x27;s memoirs of her marriage to Cyril Connolly, Jonathan Pryce&#x27;s character Alec Bolton in the film is based on Cyril Connolly
*Connolly is also fictionalised in Ian McEwan&#x27;s novel &quot;Atonement&quot;. The principal character, eighteen-year-old Briony Tallis, sends the draft of a novella she has written to &quot;Horizon&quot; magazine and Cyril Connolly is shown as replying at length as to why the novella had to be rejected, apart from explaining to Briony her strong and weak points and also mentioning Elizabeth Bowen.
*Michael Lewis&#x27;s book &quot;&quot; cites Connolly at the top of the first chapter – &quot;Whom the gods wish to destroy they first call promising.&quot; (&quot;Enemies of Promise&quot;)
*Donna Tartt&#x27;s novel &quot;The Secret History&quot; references Cyril Connolly in Chapter 5-&quot;...Cyril Connolly, who was notorious for being a hard guest to please...&quot;.
*In William Boyd&#x27;s James Bond novel &quot;Solo&quot; Bond recalls Connolly&#x27;s description of Chelsea as &quot;that tranquil cultivated &quot;spielraum&quot;... where I worked and wandered&quot; (Connolly, Boyd and the fictional Bond all lived in Chelsea), although Bond can not remember the author of the quote.
*In &quot;An Englishman Abroad&quot; (1983) by Alan Bennett, Guy Burgess keeps asking Coral Browne &quot;How is Cyril Connolly?&quot;
*In &quot;Solomon Gursky Was Here&quot; (1989) by Mordecai Richler, Moses Berger, sorting his books as an excuse for not writing, finds his copy of &quot;The Unquiet Grave&quot; and reads &quot;...the true function of a writer is to produce a masterpiece...&quot; Muttering an imprecation, he throws the book across the room, but immediately retrieves it because of his regard for Connolly.
*Connolly makes an appearance as the 1940s editor of &quot;Horizon&quot; in Ian McEwan&#x27;s 2022 novel, &quot;Lessons&quot;.

<doc id="757967" wikidata="Q7205807" url="?curid=757967" title="Plymouth Gin">
<text>Plymouth Gin is a style and brand of gin that has been distilled on the same premises on the Barbican in Plymouth, Devon, since 1793. The site of production, the Plymouth Gin Distillery, was built in 1431 and is reputed to have once been a monastery of the Dominican Order, widely known as &quot;Black Friars&quot;. For this reason, it has traditionally been called the &quot; Distillery&quot;, and this name appears embossed on the gin bottles. The taste profile of the style has been described as &quot;earthy&quot;, and featuring more citrus notes than the &quot;London Dry&quot; gin style, of which Plymouth Gin is considered an offshoot, or subtype.

Plymouth Gin was the only spirit made in England, and one of only three gins in the world, that carried a geographical indication (GI) designation with the European Union, certifying its traditional origin. In 2015, the distillery&#x27;s owners declined to pursue renewal of the GI, considering its protection was unneeded. This leaves only from Spain and (Vilnius gin) from Lithuania to carry GI status.

==Product==
The Plymouth Original Strength brand of gin is 41.2% alcohol by volume (ABV). While the botanicals used in Plymouth Gin (juniper, coriander, cardamom, orange, lemon, orris and angelica) are common to many gins, its flavour differs from the more common style of gin, London Dry. A higher proportion of root ingredients and other botanicals is used in the Plymouth recipe, which brings what is described as a more &#x27;earthy&#x27; feel to the gin, as well as a softened juniper flavour, and noticeable citrus notes. It is often noted as being &quot;drier&quot; than London Dry (for example by &quot;Bon Appetit&quot;; the beverage website &quot;Cocktail Society&quot;) although some writers note a subtle &quot;sweetness&quot;. At least one reviewer considers it is &quot;less dry&quot; than London Dry. A 47% ABV (94 U.S. proof) version is distributed worldwide.

Plymouth also make a &#x27;navy strength&#x27; variety of Plymouth Gin, which is 57% ABV (100° English proof), being the traditional strength demanded by the British Royal Navy.&lt;ref name=&quot;http://www.plymouthgin.com&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It was a tradition in the Royal Navy that all newly commissioned vessels receive a &quot;Plymouth Gin Commissioning kit&quot;, a wooden box containing two bottles of navy strength Plymouth gin and glassware.

According to the distiller&#x27;s website, Plymouth also produces a sloe gin, a gin fruit cup and a &quot;limited edition&quot; single-origin juniper gin .

==Background==

In the first half of the 18th century, as a result of government policy and economic conditions, gin became a low-cost and readily available alcoholic beverage. It was widely consumed by the poor and was generally believed to be a major contributor to the considerable social problems of the time, in what became known as the Gin Craze. Among those advocating for reforms that would address the situation was William Hogarth, whose 1751 engraving, &quot;Gin Lane&quot;, formed part of his campaign. It illustrated the calamitous social ills ascribed to the use of gin. The negative reputation arising from these circumstances, coupled with the often poor quality, adulterated product of unregulated distilling, positioned gin as an undesirable beverage even decades after &quot;anti-gin&quot; legislation (notably, the Gin Act 1751), along with the reduced economic viability of using grain for alcohol production, had substantially reduced the adverse impacts of the &quot;craze&quot;.

In contrast, Plymouth Gin was viewed more favourably. The product was standardised and reliable, while its distillation occurred far from the slums of London where substandard gin had most often been both made and imbibed. The global deployment of the Royal Navy, who carried it on their ships, led to the renown and wider consumption of the Plymouth product. While use of gin in general declined in England from the 1750s, the Plymouth-style was somewhat insulated from the falling consumption and low regard which distilled grain spirits had acquired in the aftermath of the Gin Craze.

Plymouth Gin was very popular in the first part of the 20th century. Thirty-two gin-based cocktail recipes in the Savoy book of cocktails name Plymouth Gin specifically. Plymouth was the favorite gin of film directors Alfred Hitchcock and Orson Welles, as well as the American President Franklin D. Roosevelt.

==Commercial history==
Today, there is only one brand of Plymouth-style gin, the &quot;Plymouth&quot; brand, which is produced at the Distillery in Devon. It is the only remaining gin distillery in Plymouth. The building, constructed in 1431, has been in operation as a gin distillery since 1793. It opens onto what is now Southside Street.

The established distilling business of Fox &amp; Williamson began the distilling of the Plymouth brand in 1793. Soon the business became known as Coates &amp; Co., which it remained until March 2004. The Plymouth brand of gin has been produced at the same Plymouth distillery using the same original recipe, with only brief interruption, since 1793.

By the 1990s, sales of gin across the board had declined substantially, and Plymouth Gin specifically was doing poorly, with sales down to 7,000 cases a year; its owner, Allied Domecq, was focusing on Beefeater Gin, its one-time rival that was by then owned by the same company. In 1996, the brand was sold by Allied Lyons to a management group headed by Charles Rolls. In March 1998, the new owners initiated a brand re-launch, positioning it as a premium brand with new packaging that recreated the original bottle, including a mock-engraving of its thirsty monk mascot positioned toward the bottom of the bottle, referencing the brand motto &quot;when his feet are dry it&#x27;s time to buy.&quot;

After turning the company around, they sold it in 2005 to the Swedish company V&amp;S Group, which also made Absolut Vodka. The brand is now owned and distributed by the French company Pernod Ricard as a result of its purchase of V&amp;S in 2008.

The European Union (EU) granted Plymouth Gin (i.e., any gin of traditional style made in or near Plymouth), protected designation of origin (PDO) status. Under the GI scheme of the EU, the historical association of a food product with a region, and its traditional production, is codified and regulated. This gives protection from imitators not located within the designated places, or not using the approved methods of production, as such producers are not permitted to use the specified term for their products. Prior to the expiration of the PDO in February 2015, Pernod Ricard announced that they would not be applying for its continuation. The company considers it to be unnecessary for the gin&#x27;s protected status, as they own the tradename, &quot;Plymouth Gin&quot;, and their Distillery has been the sole maker of the style for over 100 years.

===Packaging===

In 1998, the brand was relaunched by the new management team. The new packaging involved a re-creation of the original bottle and included a thirsty monk inside the bottle. It was said that when the monk&#x27;s feet &#x27;got dry&#x27;, it was time for a new bottle. It was also restored to its original strength of 41.2%, and a Navy Strength of 57% introduced to remind drinkers that the brand was the official gin for the Royal Navy.

In mid-2006, the bottle was changed by new owners V&amp;S to an Art Deco style. The front of the bottle depicted the ship, &quot;Mayflower&quot;, based upon the fact that when the Pilgrim Fathers set out for their journey to the New World, bad sea conditions and damage forced them to put into Plymouth harbour for shelter and essential repairs. Local tradition has it that some of them stayed in the monastery, which later became the distillery. In the same way as the monk&#x27;s feet had purportedly indicated the need for re-stocking, it was now said that it was time to get a new bottle when the &quot;Mayflower&quot; &#x27;no longer sails on gin&#x27;.

In January 2012, the packaging was again redesigned, this time returning to a more classical &quot;shaving bottle&quot; shape with a slightly green tint and the words &quot;Est. 1793 – Distillery&quot; embossed on the front.

==Accolades==
Plymouth&#x27;s Original Gin has won several awards over the years, including four double gold, four gold, one silver, and two bronze medals at the San Francisco World Spirits Competition between 2006–2016. In 2016, Plymouth received double gold for its Plymouth Gin (Original Gin) and gold for its Navy Strength gin in this competition.

<text>Giancarlo Peris (born 4 November 1941), an Italian track athlete of Greek descent, was the final bearer of the Olympic torch for the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome, Italy.

==Biography==
Peris was born in Civitavecchia, a port city on the Tyrrhenian Sea 70 kilometers northwest of Rome. The Italian National Olympic Committee decided that the last torchbearer of the Olympic Games would be the winner of a junior Cross country running race. Peris won and was chosen to be the last torchbearer. Peris was also a promising track athlete and few months before the opening of the Olympic games he competed for his country&#x27;s national junior/youth team against Poland.

He later became a teacher of history and Italian at the technical high-school &quot;G. Baccelli&quot; of Civitavecchia. He also coached at a small athletics club.

<text>The United Nations Global Compact is a non-binding United Nations pact to get businesses and firms worldwide to adopt sustainable and socially responsible policies, and to report on their implementation. The UN Global Compact is the world&#x27;s largest corporate sustainability and corporate social responsibility initiative, with more than 20,000 corporate participants and other stakeholders in over 167 countries. 
The organization consists of a global agency, and local &quot;networks&quot; or agencies for each participating country. Under the Global Compact, companies are brought together with UN agencies, labour groups and civil society. 

The UN Global Compact is a principle-based framework for businesses, stating ten principles in the areas of &quot;human rights&quot;, &quot;labour&quot;, &quot;the environment&quot; and &quot;anti-corruption&quot;. 
The declared objectives of the participants and stakeholders are to &quot;mainstream the ten principles in business activities around the world&quot; and to &quot;catalyse actions in support of broader UN goals, such as the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)&quot;. The organization solicits commitments to specific sustainability and social responsibility goals from CEOs and highest-level executives, and in turn offers training, peer-networks and a functional framework for responsibility, taking a &quot;learning model&quot; for corporate change, rather than a regulatory one.

The UN Global Compact was announced by UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan in an address to the World Economic Forum on 31 January 1999 and was officially launched at UN Headquarters in New York City on 26 July 2000. The Global Compact Office works on the basis of a mandate set out by the UN General Assembly as an organization that &quot;promotes responsible business practices and UN values among the global business community and the UN System&quot;. The UN Global Compact is a founding member of the United Nations Sustainable Stock Exchanges (SSE) initiative along with the Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI), the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP-FI), and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD).

==The Ten Principles==
The UN Global Compact was initially launched with the first nine Principles. On 24 June 2004, during the first Global Compact Leaders Summit, Kofi Annan announced the addition of the tenth principle against corruption in accordance with the United Nations Convention Against Corruption adopted in 2003.

The Ten Principles represent a set of core values drawn from major international agreements.
The Ten Principles and the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are considered to be strongly aligned with Pope Francis&#x27; Encyclical , sharing &quot;a common vision for business&quot;. Both call for wide social engagement and the involvement of both business and civil society.

==Facilitation==
The UN Global Compact is not a regulatory instrument, having a &quot;guiding rather than binding character&quot;. It is sometimes referred to as soft law, although it may not fit the conventional understanding of that term as it is used in international law. Rather it is a forum for discussion and a network for communication including governments, companies and labour organisations, whose actions it seeks to influence, and civil society organisations, representing its stakeholders. The UN Global Compact says that once companies declare their support for the principles &quot;This does not mean that the Global Compact recognizes or certifies that these companies have fulfilled the Compact’s principles.&quot; Instead, as mentioned in a 2015 interview with then-Executive Director, Lise Kingo, &quot;we are the guide dogs, not the watchdogs&quot;, with the organization seeking to prioritize providing resources and support instead of attempting to enforce discipline.

The UN Global Compact&#x27;s goals are intentionally flexible and vague, but it distinguishes the following channels through which it provides facilitation and encourages dialogue: policy dialogues, learning, local networks and projects.
The Global Compact creates resources and guides that business and non-profit organizations may use in their efforts to support the Compact&#x27;s overall mission.

One such example is the SDG Compass, developed in collaboration with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBSCD), which is a collection of resources (analysis of the goals, indicators for businesses, tools for stakeholders) that companies can utilize in finding out their role in helping to achieve the SDGs. The Sustainable Ocean Business Action Platform of the UN Global Compact has been actively supporting the launch in June 2020 of the Seaweed Manifesto, the result of a collaborative work of seaweed supporters from private sector, research institutions, UN agencies and civil society, initiated by the Lloyd&#x27;s Register Foundation. Building on the Manifesto&#x27;s recommendations&quot;,&quot; the UN Global Compact, in partnership with the Lloyd&#x27;s Register Foundation and the French Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CRNS), launched the Global Seaweed Coalition in March 2021, a global coalition to support a safe, sustainable and scalable seaweed industry.

Following its creation in 2000 the Global Compact initially focused on support for Ten Principles and the Millennium Development Goals. After the MDG expired in 2015, their top priority became supporting the Sustainable Development Goals, and the SDGs&#x27; accompanying 2030 deadlines. The UN Global Compact hopes to play a critical role in helping signatories and governments to work to achieve the SDGs.

Businesses may be becoming more directly involved in government partnerships and more open to private sector interventions such as carbon pricing and other mechanics to help curb climate effects within the scope of business solutions. However, research shows that global carbon dioxide emissions are 60% higher in 2021 than in 1990, and now require fundamental system-level changes.

==History==
The first Global Compact Leaders Summit, chaired by Secretary-General Kofi Annan, was held in UN Headquarters in New York on 24 June 2004, to bring &quot;intensified international focus and increased momentum&quot; to the UN Global Compact. The second Global Compact Leaders Summit, chaired by Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, was held on 5–6 July 2007 at the Palais des Nations in Geneva. It adopted the Geneva Declaration on corporate responsibility. Marking the 10th anniversary of the Global Compact&#x27;s launch, the Global Compact Leaders Summit 2010 took place on 24–25 June 2010 in New York. On the occasion, the Blueprint for Corporate Sustainability Leadership identifying leadership criteria linked to implementation of the ten principles, efforts to support development objectives, and engagement in the Global Compact was released. In 2009 Rotary International partnered with the UN Global Compact. This was a very friendly partnership since Rotary International played a role in the chartering of the United Nations.

==UN Global Compact – Cities Programme==

In 2001, the City of Melbourne proposed that cities, as well as corporations, should be allowed to join the UN Global Compact, arguing that this would provide a clear statement of a city&#x27;s commitment to positive change, as well as motivating participation in international dialogue. The proposal was accepted, and the UN Global Compact - Cities Programme was launched in 2002. It was formed as an urban-focused component of the Global Compact with its International Secretariat initially located in Melbourne, Australia. The aim of the programme is to improve urban life in cities throughout the world.

Melbourne became the first city to engage in the Global Compact in June 2001.

In April 2003, under the directorship of David Teller, a framework called the Melbourne Model was developed that went beyond the Ten Principles. It begins by drawing the resources of government, business and civil society into a cross-sector partnership in order to develop a practical project that addresses a seemingly intractable urban issue. In 2007, the then Director, Paul James (2007–2014) and his colleagues Andy Scerri and Liam Magee, took this methodology further by integrating the partnership model with a four-domain sustainability framework called &#x27;Circles of Sustainability&#x27;.

In 2007, the Secretariat moved from the Committee For Melbourne to the Global Cities Institute at RMIT University, itself affiliated with UN-HABITAT. There, projects associated with city-based responses to global climate change and globalization became increasingly important. The Melbourne Model was further elaborated, with a sustainability indicators programme developed as a way of assessing and monitoring progress. In 2012, the Circles of Sustainability method was elaborated to guide a city or urban region through a rigorous assessment process. As one of the outcomes, it provides a figurative image of the overall sustainability of that city to illustrate its strengths and weaknesses.

In 2015, RMIT Professor Ralph Horne became the third director of the UN Global Compact Cities Programme and in February 2016 an Urban Thinkers Campus was organised at RMIT Melbourne in collaboration with World Vision International as part of the buildup to UN Habitat III. The theme of the Urban Thinkers Campus was Ethical Cities: Locking in Liveability. This was followed by the organisation of an Urban Innovation Forum on Ethical Cities in July 2016 in Barcelona, Spain as a collaboration between the UN Global Compact - Cities Programme, RMIT Europe and UN-Habitat. In Fall 2016, RMIT University and the UN Global Compact Cities Programme launched a Massive Open Online Course on FutureLearn with the title of Ethical Cities: Shaping the Future of Your City.

 there were 120 participants in the City Network, 85 of them in Latin America and the Caribbean. Milwaukee and San Francisco were the only U.S. member cities. The Cities Programme ended in 2021.

==Local networks==
Local networks of the Global Compact advance the initiative and its ten principles at a country level. Currently, there are approximately 85 Local Networks in total. These networks help companies and non-profit organizations understand what responsible business means within diverse national, cultural, and linguistic contexts. Additionally, there are related programmes for particular topics of interest, such as the Business for Peace initiative, that bring awareness to businesses and other organizations about instability and conflict, such that organizations can help to address these concerns from their own perspective and with the assistance of their local networks. Local connections to supplement the international connections made by the Global Compact at large can help to broaden the engagement and impact of members. Local Networks are independent, self-governed and self-managed entities, and work closely with the UN Global Compact&#x27;s New York headquarters, and coordinate as points of contact for UN Global Compact signatories in their respective countries. The Local Networks of the Global Compact are showcased, but not limited to the interactions chronicled below:

=== Australia===
* The Global Compact Local Network in Australia was established in 2009 by a steering committee drawn from the Australian business community and stakeholder groups. It was formally incorporated in 2011. as the Global Compact Network Australia Limited, and elections were held for the inaugural board of directors. In 2011 it established two business-led leadership groups dealing with human rights and anti-corruption. The GCNA draws its funding directly from members and member-based activities, in contrast to many networks who rely in part on government funding.

=== Bulgaria===
* The Global Compact Local Network in Bulgaria was founded in January 2003, under the auspices of President Georgi Parvanov. The voluntary initiative unites 120 Bulgarian companies, non-governmental organizations and academia into a unique network. All members are united around the idea of applying the ten principles of the UN Global Compact in their daily practices and to be responsible corporate citizens. In 2006, to strengthen and enhance the role of the initiative, a management structure was introduced consisting of an advisory board and a Secretariat. For the period 2006-2010, the network activities were supported by the United Nations Development Programme Bulgaria. With the active participation and financial contribution of its members Global Compact Bulgaria organized numerous initiatives related to environment, health, education and youth. Among them are the projects: &quot;Unleashing Entrepreneurship&quot;; &quot;Love Bridge&quot;; &quot;Sharing Best Practices in Corporate Social Responsibility&quot;.
* With the end of the support from UNDP Bulgaria, the Global Compact Local Network in Bulgaria had to identify and formulate a new strategy for sustainability. So, between 2009 and 2010 the members signed an institutional framework for future organizational development. As a result, on 10 September 2010, a new independent organization was founded – Association Global Compact Network Bulgaria. Its members are 20 leading companies and organizations in Bulgaria, and members of the UN Global Compact as well. The Association is managed by a steering committee and control committee. Their main goals are to learn from each other, to communicate, to generate an advocacy impact and to initiate dialogue or partnerships with other actors such as the government, local authorities, labour organisations and civil society organizations.

=== France===
* The Global Compact Network France was established in 2004. It is the second largest local network of the UN Global Compact after Spain, with more than 1,100 participants in 2017. The main aim of the Global Compact Network France is to add personalized value to the French participants of the Global Compact, in order to help them to make progress in their CSR approach and enlarge the Global Compact network. The local network is entirely financed by its members.

=== Germany ===

* The GCN Germany (DGCN) was created in the year 2000 on the initiative of German companies as one of the first national platforms. Its tasks and obligations as an official local Network are defined in a Memorandum of Understanding with the UN Global Compact; it may only bear the name of the Global Compact Network Germany as long as it carries out these tasks and fulfils these obligations. 
* The GCN Germany brings together all German signatories of the UN Global Compact. The network comprises more than 780 German companies and organizations from civil society, science, and the public sector and serves to provide information on issues of corporate responsibility, exchange ideas, and develop joint practical solutions.

=== India ===
* The Global Compact Network (GCN) India was formed by organizations from India that participate in the Global Compact. It was registered on 24 November 2003, with the Registrar of Societies, NCT, Delhi, as a non-profit body. The main objective of the Network is to provide a forum for various Indian Companies/ Organizations to exchange experiences, network and work together on activities related to CSR. This is expected to promote sustainable growth besides encouraging good corporate citizenship. The Network acts as an Apex-level nodal agency representing various Indian Corporate bodies/ Institutions/ NGOs/ SMEs, who are committed to the UN Global Compact principles.
* The Global Compact Network India has been one of the pioneering local initiatives of the Global Compact. It is one of the first local networks to be set up as a legal entity. Over the last nine years, the network has seen modest growth and has been able to create a niche for itself within efforts by the business community directed towards realising the vision of sustainable development in India. At present Arun Kumar Singh, CMD, ONGC, is the President of the Global Compact Network India for the term 2023–25 and is managed by a Governing Council.

=== Mexico===
* The Global Compact Network in Mexico in December 2014 endorsed the commitment of the private sector towards improving gender equality. Echoing the sentiments of initiatives such as the &quot;HeforShe&quot;, and the large support of individuals in the region for promoting gender equality and empowering women. Much of this progress is being achieved by practical guidelines for how private entities can make a more diverse, inclusive workplace that creates codes of global business.

=== Spain===
* The Global Compact Network Spain is the largest local network of signatories to the UN Global Compact. As an independent legal entity launched in 2004, it is managed by a steering committee with a chairman, deputy chairman, secretary, treasurer and 16 directors elected by the network&#x27;s general assembly. The steering committee includes representatives from large companies, small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), the public sector, educational entities and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). In order to abide by the rules of the Spanish legislature, the general assembly holds a vote each year on budgetary issues and resolutions and nominates the steering committee. The Global Compact Network Spain has been successful in involving SMEs, developing interactive resources and reporting tools and emphasizing human rights through the commitment of the local companies.

=== Syria===
* The Syria initiative aims at enhancing civic engagement and corporate social responsibility of the private sector by promoting the ten principles of the UN Global Compact as well as forging partnerships between private sector organizations, public sector institutions and civil society. This initiative is a partnership between the Syrian Government represented by the State Planning Commission and the UNDP Country Office in Syria. It was launched under the patronage of the Head of State Planning Commission and in the presence of the Deputy Chairperson of the UN Global Compact in July 2008. The Syrian Global Compact Local Network has 26 businesses, five NGOs, and five federations of commerce and industry. It was displayed among 10 selected ones from around the world in the Global Compact Sixth Annual Local Networks Forum. The Syria story was called a &quot;leadership case&quot; and the Syria Network growth ratio was ranked first among the global top ten in 2008. The UNGC National Advisory Council has been formulated and held its founders’ meeting on 15 October 2008, with the participation of leaders from the Syrian private sector, international corporate representatives, local and international civil society organizations, UNDP, the Syrian Government, media and education sectors.

==Criticism==
Criticisms of the Global Compact often hinge on its choice to position itself as a voluntary organization rather than a regulatory one. Critics argue that in the absence of effective monitoring and enforcement provisions, the Global Compact fails to hold corporations accountable. Moreover, these critics argue that companies could potentially misuse the Global Compact as a public relations instrument for &quot;bluewashing&quot;. Bluewashing refers to the alleged practice of companies claiming their membership or participation in philanthropic and charity-based activity as an excuse, and perhaps as an entry door to increase corporate influence upon international organizations. Peter Utting, deputy director of UNRISD, and Ann Zammit emphasize the importance of critically examining UN-Business Partnerships.

Critics have included an informal network known as Global Compact Critics that cited a lack of mechanisms for sanctioning non-compliance or lack of progress. The Global Compact Critics formally disbanded in February 2015. Similarly, the Alliance for a Corporate-Free UN, which also no longer exists, was a campaigning organization led by Corpwatch that highlighted weaknesses in the principles underlying the Global Compact. The Global Compact was also criticized by Maude Barlow, senior adviser on water issues to the President of the United Nations General Assembly in December 2008, for bluewashing.

While the Global Compact does expel members, this is generally done in response to failure to register reports with the organization, rather than in response to an organization&#x27;s broader actions. For example, Leaders of the tribe Ayoreo Indians in Paraguay wrote to the UN Global Compact saying they are &quot;concerned and frustrated&quot; by its inclusion of a controversial Brazilian ranching company, Yaguarete Porá. The company has been charged and fined for illegally clearing the Ayoreo&#x27;s forests and concealing evidence of uncontacted Ayoreo living there. The Ayoreo asked that the company be expelled from the Global Compact. The Brazilian Vale mining company withdrew from the UN Global Compact after civil society groups demanded that it be delisted.

==Support==
The Global Compact provides a list of over 20,000 active participant organizations, composed of roughly 16,000 businesses and 4,000 non-business entities on its website. The site provides a brief overview of each participant, and a link to their Letter of Commitment (if new), Financial Overview and Contributions (if applicable), Communication on Progress (COP), Communication on Engagement (COE, non-business).

=== Notable member organizations ===
Notable companies who have signed on the Global Compact include, but are not limited to, Starbucks, L&#x27;Oreal, Bayer AG, Coca-Cola, 3M, Deloitte, and Zurn. In addition to its signatories, the Global Compact has been repeatedly supported by the UN General Assembly, honoring its 15th anniversary in June 2015 alongside the Secretary-General, Ban Ki-Moon, himself who claims that &quot;Business can be a global force for good&quot; and that &quot;advocacy and example can drive action to achieve a life of dignity for all people&quot;.
