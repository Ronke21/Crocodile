<text>U.S. Route 17 or U.S. Highway 17 (US 17), also known as the Coastal Highway, is a north–south United States Numbered Highway that spans in the Southeastern United States. It runs close to the Atlantic Coast for much of its length, with the exception of the portion between Punta Gorda and Jacksonville, Florida, and the portion from Fredericksburg to Winchester, Virginia, both of which follow a more inland route. Major metropolitan areas served along US 17&#x27;s route include the Punta Gorda, Greater Orlando, and Jacksonville metropolitan areas in Florida, the Brunswick and Savannah metropolitan areas in Georgia, the Charleston and Myrtle Beach metropolitan areas in South Carolina, the Cape Fear and New Bern metropolitan areas in North Carolina, and the Hampton Roads and Winchester metropolitan areas in Virginia.

The highway&#x27;s southern terminus is at Punta Gorda, Florida, at an intersection with US 41. Traveling north, US 17 joins up with US 50 in Paris, Virginia, and the northern terminus of US 17 is in downtown Winchester. This is also the point at which the portion of US 50 called the Northwestern Turnpike begins.

Though US 1 is generally considered to be the highway that runs alongside Interstate 95 (I-95), US 17 runs parallel to I-95 for much of its extent and even shares the same physical road for short spans in Fredericksburg, Virginia, and Ridgeland, South Carolina. As such, US 17 is out of sequence in the U.S. Highway numbering plan (US 17 would, under the plan, run parallel to and between US 15 and US 19; the U.S. Highway following that path is instead marked US 219).

===Florida===

US 17 begins in downtown Punta Gorda at US 41 (Cross Street), just to the west of the Tamiami Trail. After running east, it runs roughly north along the Peace River, through Arcadia, Zolfo Springs (where it crosses the Peace River), and Wauchula. At Fort Meade, it joins with US 98, which follows it northward (westward on US 98) until Bartow. While US 98 goes northwest, US 17 goes northeast.

US 17 begins a long concurrency with US 92 just north of Winter Haven in Lake Alfred (US 92 following eastbound), which takes both highways through Kissimmee, where they join US 192. Like US 92, US 17 roughly parallels I-4 along the overlap. When all three meet US 441, US 192 follows US 441 southbound, while US 17/US 92 follows US 441 north into downtown Orlando. US 17/US 92 then splits from US 441 at State Road 50 (SR 50, Colonial Drive) and jogs east, splitting back north from SR 50 when it meets SR 15 (Mills Avenue).

In Sanford, US 17/US 92 crosses the St. Johns River into Volusia County via the Bill Benedict Bridge.

US 92 then splits away from US 17 north of DeLand, as US 92 continues east to Daytona Beach on International Speedway Boulevard, while US 17 continues north toward Palatka, where it again crosses the St. Johns River.

In Clay County, US 17 runs through suburban Jacksonville. The northern stretch of US 17 in Clay County is known as Park Avenue.

In Jacksonville, the southern portion of US 17 is known as Roosevelt Boulevard. Here, the highway goes past Naval Air Station Jacksonville (NAS Jax). Near downtown Jacksonville, US 17 joins I-10 for approximately , before merging into I-95. US 17 then exits onto Union Street and continues as North Main Street until the Nassau County border. It then continues until it reaches the Georgia state line, crossing over the St. Marys River.

===Georgia===
In Woodbine, US 17 crosses the Satilla River by way of the J. Edwin Godley Bridge. In Brunswick, the route traverses the South Brunswick River over the Sidney Lanier Bridge, then across the Altamaha River bridge between Glynn and McIntosh counties. At the South Carolina state line, US 17 crosses the Savannah River on the Talmadge Memorial Bridge.

===South Carolina===

US 17 enters South Carolina in Jasper County as a two-lane road and within enters Hardeeville, where it becomes a four-lane configuration. US 17 intersects I-95 in Hardeeville and runs parallel to I-95 until Ridgeland, where it merges with the Interstate until Point South. At Point South, US 17 leaves I-95 and heads eastward into northern Beaufort County, sharing a concurrency with US 21 until Gardens Corner. US 21 splits off to Beaufort while US 17 heads northeast into the ACE Basin and Colleton County. This stretch of road has been upgraded from a two-lane to a four-lane configuration, due to safety concerns.

Once in Jacksonboro, the road enters Charleston County, crossing the Edisto River and maintains a four-lane configuration for the remainder of the state. The road passes through several rural communities as it approaches Charleston from the west. In Charleston, the section running from South Carolina Highway 171 (SC 171) to Sam Rittenberg Boulevard has been named the &quot;Charleston Nine Memorial Highway&quot;, in honor of nine Charleston firefighters killed in the line of duty in the Charleston Sofa Super Store fire on June 18, 2007. US 17 passes through the West Ashley community before it traverses the Ashley River Drawbridges to the Charleston Peninsula. From the drawbridges, it is known as the Septima Clark Crosstown Connector and is mostly routed north of the affluent historical areas of the city. Upon reaching the I-26 terminus, US 17 becomes limited-access and above grade as it approaches the Cooper River via the Arthur Ravenel Jr. Bridge. The stretch of US 17 in Charleston is infamous among locals for its traffic congestion, especially on weekday mornings.

Upon crossing the river, the highway enters Mount Pleasant at grade and is signalized for several miles up through the second interchange with I-526 and connecting roads to the Isle of Palms and Sullivan&#x27;s Island. The road leaves the Charleston metro area and enters the Francis Marion National Forest and going through the rural communities of Awendaw and McClellanville, where Hurricane Hugo made landfall in September 1989. US 17 continues on its northeastern journey to Georgetown and crosses the marsh-lined Santee River as it enters Georgetown County. US 17&#x27;s route through Georgetown is a major thoroughfare through the city and skirts the historic district. After going through Georgetown and passing by DeBordieu Colony, Pawleys Island, Litchfield Beach, and Murrells Inlet, US 17 enters Horry County, passes Garden City Beach, and Surfside Beach, and arrives in Myrtle Beach, where it splits between a business route and the mainline route, which remains west of the beach and tourist areas served by US 17 Business. The roads rejoin north of the city and continue as US 17 through Atlantic Beach, North Myrtle Beach, and Little River before crossing into North Carolina.

===North Carolina===
In Wilmington, US 17 (here concurrent with I-140) crosses the Northeast Cape Fear River between New Hanover and Brunswick counties over the Dan Cameron Bridge. Between New Bern and James City, US 17 (concurrent with US 70 and North Carolina Highway 55, or NC 55) crosses the Trent River by way of the Freedom Memorial Bridge. Farther east, between James City and Bridgeton, US 17, still concurrent with NC 55, crosses the Neuse River over the Neuse River Bridge.

In Washington, US 17 crosses the Pamlico River over the Pamlico-Tar River Bridge. Farther along, in Williamston, US 17 (concurrent with US 13) crosses the Roanoke River, then the Cashie River at Windsor. At the Bertie County–Chowan county line, US 17 traverses the Chowan River on the Chowan River Bridge, one of the longest bridges along US 17&#x27;s route. In Perquimans County, US 17 (here concurrent with NC 37) crosses the Yeopim River and the Perquimans River at Hertford. Crossing into Pasquotank County over the Little River, US 17 enters Elizabeth City and begins a short concurrency with US 158. At Morgan&#x27;s Corner, the US 158 concurrency ends, and US 17 crosses the Pasquotank River into Camden County before heading north into Virginia.

===Virginia===
US 17 enters Virginia into the city of Chesapeake, running along the border of the Great Dismal Swamp. It runs through more of the city of Chesapeake and around the cities of Portsmouth and Norfolk before it crosses the James River between Newport News and Isle of Wight County on the James River Bridge concurrent with US 258. The route also crosses the York River between Gloucester and York counties at Yorktown on the George P. Coleman Memorial Bridge. Finally, US 17 traverses the Rappahannock River between Stafford and Spotsylvania counties at Fredericksburg as it overlaps I-95. Then it traverses the Blue Ridge Mountains through Fauquier County and crosses the town of Warrenton. It then merges with I-66 in Marshall and runs concurrently until Delaplane. The highway terminates at a junction with US 11 and US 522 in Winchester.

==History==
===Florida===

From 1956 until 1993, US 17 signs in Florida featured black numbering on a yellow shield. The color coding of U.S. Highways by the Florida Department of Transportation was stopped when the state could only use federal funding for stock black-and-white; a few yellow US 17 signs remain.

===South Carolina===
US 17 has had slight variations over its history in South Carolina. US 17 once traversed the Cooper River on the John P. Grace and Silas N. Pearman memorial bridges before the Arthur Ravenel Jr. Bridge replaced both in 2005. US 17 also ran through downtown Myrtle Beach before the new bypass route was finished in the early 1980’s to alleviate heavy traffic. US 17 Alternate was commissioned as a route between Point South and Georgetown, mostly for trucks who wished to bypass Charleston and the weight restrictions of the former bridges.

===Hurricane Charley Highway===
On August 13, 2004, Hurricane Charley made landfall near the southern terminus of US 17 at Punta Gorda. The hurricane threatened to hit much of the highway, affecting the route in Florida from Punta Gorda to north of Orlando (when Charley followed the route of I-4 out to sea). The Georgia stretch of US 17 was not hit but was under a hurricane warning. When Charley made landfall again in South Carolina, its trail through Virginia was close to US 17.

<text>John Edward Barnard, (born 4 May 1946) is an English engineer and racing car designer. Barnard is credited with the introduction of two new designs into Formula One: the carbon fibre composite chassis first seen in with McLaren, and the semi-automatic gearbox with shift paddles on the steering wheel, which he introduced with Ferrari in .

==Early career==
Barnard gained a diploma from Watford College of Technology in the 1960s and unlike many of his contemporaries he did not follow a lengthy academic career, instead choosing to join General Electric Company. In 1968, Barnard was recruited by Lola Cars in Huntingdon as a junior designer and began working on many of the chassis manufacturer&#x27;s projects, including Formula Vee racers and numerous sports cars. While at Lola, Barnard was introduced to Patrick Head, who later helped Frank Williams found the Williams Formula One team. The two engineers became good friends and Head was best man at Barnard&#x27;s wedding in the early 1970s.

In 1972, Barnard joined the McLaren Formula One team and remained for three years working alongside Gordon Coppuck on the design of the Championship-winning M23 chassis and other McLaren projects, including the team&#x27;s IndyCar. By 1975, Barnard had been hired by Parnelli Jones to work with Maurice Philippe designing the team&#x27;s Formula One racer (the Parnelli VPJ4) which campaigned from 1974 to 1976. The cars best finish was 4th by Mario Andretti at the 1975 Swedish Grand Prix. After Philippe left Vel&#x27;s Parnelli Jones Racing, Barnard modified the design for the Indycar circuit. Further Indycar designs followed and in 1980 the Barnard-designed Chaparral 2K chassis took Johnny Rutherford to the prestigious Indianapolis 500 and the CART drivers title.

===McLaren era===

His success in the United States brought Barnard to the attention of new McLaren team boss Ron Dennis, and in 1980 he joined the team and began working on the McLaren MP4 (MP4/1), the first carbon fibre composite chassis in Formula One, alongside the Lotus 88 designed by Colin Chapman. The chassis itself was built by team sponsor Hercules Aerospace in the US, after former Hercules apprentice and then McLaren engineer Steve Nichols had advised Barnard that the US-based company might be their best choice. Barnard, along with Dennis, had been unsuccessfully searching in England for a company willing to take on the job.

The MP4/1 quickly revolutionised car design in Formula One with new levels of rigidity and driver protection. At the 1981 Italian Grand Prix at Monza, the strength of the MP4/1 was given a very public test when John Watson suffered a massive crash in his MP4/1 coming out of the second Lesmo turn. The strength of the carbon fibre monocoque (which many in F1 had been sceptical of) saw Watson emerge unhurt to the surprise of many, not the least being Watson himself and Barnard. Within months the design had been copied by many of McLaren&#x27;s rivals. In , Barnard pioneered the &#x27;coke-bottle&#x27; shape of sidepods still visible to this day.
During his time with the team, McLaren became the dominant force within Formula One, taking drivers titles for Niki Lauda in , and Alain Prost in and , with the first two seasons seeing constructors honours and the team narrowly missing out to Williams in for a third. The 1984 season also saw McLaren drivers Lauda and Prost win an amazing 12 of 16 races with the TAG-Porsche powered McLaren MP4/2 (Prost won 7, Lauda 5, but Lauda scored in more races and won the championship by only half a point from his teammate). By the time Barnard left McLaren for Ferrari at the end of his cars had won 31 Grands Prix for the team.

The 80° V6 TAG engine had been financed by Mansour Ojjeh of Techniques d&#x27;Avant Garde (TAG) and was built by Porsche to Barnard&#x27;s specification for the MP4/1E and its highly successful replacement the MP4/2. After debuting in Lauda&#x27;s new MP4/1E at the 1983 Dutch Grand Prix with approximately , power steadily rose until the 1.5-litre turbocharged engine named the TTE PO1 produced around at the end of its life in .

===Ferrari years===
By , the working relationship between Barnard and McLaren boss Ron Dennis had deteriorated. This led to speculation that Barnard would leave the team, and it came as no surprise when it was announced before the 1986 German Grand Prix that he would be joining Ferrari in . The Scuderia had not won a Grand Prix since Michele Alboreto had won the 1985 German Grand Prix, and the designer had been able to name his terms. Given a large sum of money by the team to set up a design office in Guildford in England, Barnard founded the Ferrari Guildford Technical Office in early 1988 and began work on returning Ferrari to regular winning (according to Barnard, the name of the Guildford office had been a play on words of one of Ferrari&#x27;s road cars, the GTO). Gerhard Berger won the last two races of the season, and followed this by a lucky victory at the Italian Grand Prix in September 1988, in a season of total domination by McLaren, whose Honda-powered MP4/4 had been designed by former colleague Steve Nichols, with some help from Barnard&#x27;s replacement in the team, long time Brabham designer Gordon Murray. Ferrari finished 4th in the Constructors&#x27; Championship in 1987 and 2nd in 1988.

Of the Gustav Brunner designed Ferrari F1/87 and the updated F1/87/88C used in the 1987 and 1988 seasons, Barnard stated that the car had a different design than he would have chosen given the regulations, but that by the time he arrived at the team work had already begun on the cars&#x27; construction and little could be done to change things without considerable expense. Also, with 1988 being the last year for turbo powered cars, his main focus was on designing the car to conform to the FIA&#x27;s new regulations which required all Formula One cars to use a 3.5-litre naturally aspirated engine.

While at Ferrari, Barnard ruffled a few feathers with his way of doing things. Despite being the team&#x27;s Technical Director, he alienated himself from the team when he decided to set up his office in England and not at the factory in Maranello as had been the tradition even with non-Italian members of the team (like the team&#x27;s chief engineer at the time, fellow Briton Harvey Postlethwaite). Barnard reasoned that it would allow more work to be done on designing the 1989 car without the distractions of the factory and the Italian press who had been known to be scathing on any Ferrari failures. He also put a ban on the team&#x27;s long-standing tradition of having wine at the mechanics&#x27; lunch table during testing, something that proved unpopular with the team&#x27;s mostly Italian mechanics.

In 1989, Barnard pioneered the electronic gear shift mechanism – now known as a semi-automatic gearbox – which was operated via two paddles on the steering wheel. This revolutionary system had proved fragile in testing since early in 1988 and many in F1 were expecting it to fail. However, new team recruit Nigel Mansell took the new V12-powered Ferrari 640 to victory first time out at the Brazilian Grand Prix in Rio de Janeiro. Barnard had instigated his second technical revolution, and by every team was running a copy of the Ferrari gearbox. This would unfortunately be the only finish recorded by either Mansell or Berger until Round 7 when Mansell finished second in the French Grand Prix at Paul Ricard. The new gearbox had been the cause of many DNF&#x27;s for the team but by the time they got to France the problems had been solved (not enough power from the battery that powered the electronic gearbox) and the semi-automatic gearbox started to show its advantages.

One such advantage of the new system was put to good use by Gerhard Berger after he suffered a fiery high speed crash at the San Marino Grand Prix. His car hit the wall at the Tamburello curve at close to and with an almost full fuel load burst into flames, leaving the Austrian (who was knocked unconscious) with burns on his hands. His injuries kept him out of the next race in Monaco, and would normally have kept him out for longer, but being able to make gear changes without his hands leaving the steering wheel he was able to return in Mexico, just two races after his crash. Berger and team boss Cesare Fiorio told the press in Mexico that had the Ferrari not been equipped with Barnard&#x27;s revolutionary gearbox, Berger&#x27;s injuries would not have allowed him to return to racing so soon.

Following Mansell&#x27;s second place in France and the car&#x27;s newfound reliability, results improved dramatically. Podium places were intermixed with Mansell winning the Hungarian Grand Prix, and Berger winning in Portugal. After only scoring 21 points in the first half of the season (all to Mansell), the John Barnard designed 640 rose to the occasion and scored 39 in the second half (21 of them to Berger who scored his first finish of the year with a second place at Monza), giving the team 3rd place behind McLaren and Williams in the Constructors&#x27; Championship.

==1990s==
For Frenchman Alain Prost was signed in an effective swap, sending Ferrari favourite Gerhard Berger to McLaren. Despite his friendship and good past working relationship with Prost at McLaren, Barnard opted to leave the Maranello based team and join Benetton. Seeking a new challenge, and relishing working again for a team based in England, he would be free from the Italian press, where the numerous failures during testing of the semi-automatic gearbox in 1988 had often made headlines, despite being minor.

===Move to Benetton===
As the team&#x27;s new Technical Director, Barnard assisted chief designer Rory Byrne with Benetton&#x27;s challenger, the Ford V8 powered Benetton B190, which debuted at the 1990 San Marino Grand Prix, and late in the season took 2 wins in the hands of triple World Champion Nelson Piquet, which were the last 2 races of the season in Japan and Australia (the Australian Grand Prix was also the 500th World Championship Grand Prix held since the championship had started in ).

Barnard also helped design the Benetton B191 for the season, assisted by the team&#x27;s new designer Mike Coughlan. The B191, which was the first Benetton to use the raised anhedral front profile pioneered by the Tyrrell team in 1990 (the Tyrrell 019 was designed by Harvey Postlethwaite) and has since become standard on nearly all open wheel racing cars, carried Piquet to his 23rd and final Grand Prix win in Canada. After completing the Benetton B192 for the season (with assistance from Rory Byrne and Ross Brawn), in which future 7 time World Champion Michael Schumacher would take his first ever Grand Prix win in Belgium, Barnard left Benetton after a dispute with team boss Flavio Briatore over money.

===Return to Ferrari===
After working for a short time on the stillborn Toyota F1 project, in mid-, Barnard returned to Ferrari, who were once more in a slump, having failed to win a single race since 1990. Once more Barnard was able to name his terms and opened a new technical office in Surrey named Ferrari Design and Development (FDD). From his UK office Barnard began work on the 412T1B which ultimately returned Ferrari to the top of the podium at the hands of old team favourite Gerhard Berger.

Barnard continued to design Ferrari&#x27;s Formula One racers for four seasons, including the 412T2; which took Jean Alesi to his only race win. By however major changes were underway at the Italian team. With Berger and Alesi removed, and reigning world champion Michael Schumacher installed as lead driver, team manager Jean Todt set about building a design office in Maranello. Unwilling to re-locate to Italy, Barnard&#x27;s 1997 F310B was to be his last design when Todt appointed South African Rory Byrne as Chief Designer and Englishman Ross Brawn as Technical Director. In the summer of 1997 FDD was purchased from Ferrari and became B3 Technologies ending Barnard&#x27;s association with Ferrari. Although no longer part of the team, the designer&#x27;s F310B chassis took Michael Schumacher tantalisingly close to the title and his victory at the Japanese Grand Prix was to be the last for a Barnard car.

===Arrows and Prost===
In 1998, B3 Technologies began working for the Arrows Formula One team, but the deal soon descended into dispute when the Prost team also subcontracted the R&amp;D outfit. The Arrows A19 scored the last points for a fully Barnard-designed car when Pedro Diniz placed fifth in the chaotic and rain-soaked 1998 Belgian Grand Prix. Ultimately, Barnard worked as a technical consultant for the Prost team until its demise in 2001 when he chose to move into motorcycle racing, becoming Technical Director of the Team KR Grand Prix motorcycle racing team.

===After racing===
On 29 February 2008, Barnard sold his company, B3 Technologies to 3 people, one of whom had previously worked for him, and moved into furniture design with leading designer Terence Woodgate. B3 Technologies was put into administration in late 2008.

In 2018, Barnard&#x27;s biography &quot;The Perfect Car&quot; was published by writer Nick Skeens, with the close co-operation of Barnard and input from many of his associates, drivers and rivals.

<text>Laser engraving is the practice of using lasers to engrave an object. The engraving process renders a design by physically cutting into the object to remove material. The technique does not involve the use of inks or tool bits that contact the engraving surface and wear out, giving it an advantage over alternative marking technologies, where inks or bit heads have to be replaced regularly.

It is distinct from laser marking, which involves using a laser to mark an object via any of a variety of methods, including color change due to chemical alteration, charring, foaming, melting, ablation, and more. However, the term laser marking is also used as a generic term covering a broad spectrum of surfacing techniques including printing, hot-branding, and laser bonding. The machines for laser engraving and laser marking are the same, so the two terms are sometimes confused by those without relevant expertise.

The impact of laser marking has been more pronounced for specially designed &quot;laserable&quot; materials and also for some paints. These include laser-sensitive polymers and novel metal alloys.

== Laser engraving mechanisms ==

Laser engraving is the process of selectively removing microscopic layers of material, thus creating visible marks on the treated surface. Depending on the materials, the laser-material interactions can be different. On harder surfaces, the mechanism of action is primarily the ablation where the focused beam of laser dislodges microscopic particles from the substrate. Engraving can achieve depth of 100μm and beyond, whereas laser marking is typically shallower.

The choice of lasers is important for the quality of the mark. To create a clean mark, short bursts of high quality laser pulses are preferable, since they are able to transfer large amounts of energy without causing significant heating and melting of the sample. For example, engraving using femtosecond lasers enhances precision, as these lasers emit extremely short pulses that create high-resolution marks without significant heating, avoiding material distortion or alteration. This technology is especially valuable for materials where thermal effects must be minimized, like metals, plastics, and sensitive electronics.

==Laser engraving machines==


A laser engraving machine consists of three main parts: a laser, a controller, and a surface. The laser is a drawing tool: the beam emitted from it allows the controller to trace patterns onto the surface. The controller determines the direction, intensity, speed of movement, and spread of the laser beam aimed at the surface. The surface is chosen to match the type of material the laser can act on.

The point where the laser beam touches the surface should be on the focal plane of the laser&#x27;s optical system and is usually synonymous with its focal point. This point is typically small, perhaps less than a fraction of a millimetre (depending on the optical wavelength). Only the area inside this focal point is significantly affected when the laser beam passes over the surface. The energy delivered by the laser changes the surface of the material at the focal point. It may heat up the surface and subsequently the material, or perhaps the material may fracture (known as &quot;glassing&quot; or &quot;glassing up&quot;) and flake off the surface. Cutting through the paint of a metal part is generally how material is laser engraved.

If the surface material is vaporised during laser engraving, ventilation through the use of blowers or a vacuum pump are almost always required to remove the noxious fumes and smoke arising from this process, and for removal of debris on the surface to allow the laser to continue engraving.

A laser can remove material very efficiently because the laser beam can be designed to deliver energy to the surface in a manner which converts a high percentage of the light energy into heat. The beam is highly focused and collimated—in most non-reflective materials like wood, plastics and enamel surfaces, the conversion of light energy to heat is more than {x%} efficient. However, because of this efficiency, the equipment used in laser engraving may heat up rather quickly. Elaborate cooling systems are required for the laser. Alternatively, the laser beam may be pulsed to decrease the amount of excessive heating.

Different patterns can be engraved by programming the controller to traverse a particular path for the laser beam over time. The trace of the laser beam is carefully regulated to achieve a consistent removal depth of material. For example, criss-crossed paths are avoided to ensure that each etched surface is exposed to the laser only once, so the same amount of material is removed. The speed at which the beam moves across the material is also considered in creating engraving patterns. Changing the intensity and spread of the beam allows more flexibility in the design. For example, by changing the proportion of time (known as &quot;duty-cycle&quot;) the laser is turned on during each pulse, the power delivered to the engraving surface can be controlled appropriately for the material.

Since the position of the laser is known exactly by the controller, it is not necessary to add barriers to the surface to prevent the laser from deviating from the prescribed engraving pattern. As a result, no resistive mask is needed in laser engraving. This is primarily why this technique is different from older engraving methods.

A good example of where laser engraving technology has been adopted into the industry norm is the production line. In this particular setup, the laser beam is directed towards a rotating or vibrating mirror. The mirror moves in a manner which may trace out numbers and letters onto the surface being marked. This is particularly useful for printing dates, expiry codes, and lot numbering of products travelling along a production line. Laser marking allows materials made of plastic and glass to be marked &quot;on the move&quot;. The location where the marking takes place is called a &quot;marking laser station&quot;, an entity often found in packaging and bottling plants. Older, slower technologies such as hot stamping and pad printing have largely been phased out and replaced with laser engraving.
For more precise and visually decorative engravings, a &quot;laser table&quot; (also known as an &quot;X–Y&quot; or &quot;XY&quot; table) is used. The laser is usually fixed permanently to the side of the table and emits light towards a pair of movable mirrors so that every point of the table surface can be swept by the laser. At the point of engraving, the laser beam is focused through a lens at the engraving surface, allowing very precise and intricate patterns to be traced out.

A typical setup of a laser table involves the fixed laser emitting light parallel to one axis of the table aimed at a mirror mounted on the end of an adjustable rail. The beam reflects off the mirror angled at 45 degrees so that the laser travels a path exactly along the length of the rail. This beam is then reflected by another mirror mounted to a movable trolley which directs the beam perpendicular to the original axis. In this scheme, two degrees of freedom (one vertical, and one horizontal) for etching can be represented.

In other laser engraving devices such as flat table or drum engraving, the laser beam is controlled to direct most of its energy a fixed penetration depth into the material to be engraved. In this manner, only a particular depth of material is removed when the engraving takes place. A simple machined stick or angle-iron can be used as a tool to help trained technologists adjust the engraver to achieve the required focusing. This setup is preferred for surfaces which do not vary in height appreciably.

For surfaces that vary in height, more elaborate focusing mechanisms have been developed. Some are known as dynamic auto focus systems. They adjust the lasing parameters in real time to adapt to the changes to the material as it is being etched. Typically, the height and depth of the surface are monitored with devices tracking changes to ultrasound, infrared, or visible light aimed at the engraving surface. These devices, known as pilot beams or pilot lasers (if a laser is used) help guide the adjustments made to the lens of the laser in determining the optimal spot to focus on the surface and remove material effectively.

&quot;X–Y&quot; laser engraving machines may operate in vector and raster mode.

Vector engraving follows the line and curve of the pattern to be engraved, much like a pen-based plotter draws by constructing line segments from a description of the outlines of a pattern. Much early engraving of signs and plaques (laser or otherwise) used pre-stored font outlines so that letters, numbers or even logos could be scaled to size and reproduced with exactly defined strokes. Unfortunately, &quot;fill&quot; areas were problematic, as cross-hatching patterns and dot-fills sometimes exhibited moiré effects or uber-patterns caused by the imprecise calculation of dot spacings. Moreover, rotations of a font or dynamic scaling often were beyond the capabilities of the font-rendering device. The introduction of the PostScript page-description language now allows much greater flexibility—now virtually anything that can be described in vectors by PostScript-enabled software like CorelDRAW or Adobe Illustrator can be outlined, filled with suitable patterns, and laser-engraved.

Raster engraving traces the laser across the surface in a back-and-forth slowly advancing linear pattern that will remind one of the printhead on an inkjet or similar printer. The pattern is usually optimized by the controller/computer so that areas to either side of the pattern which are not to be engraved are ignored and the trace across the material is thus shortened for better efficiency. The amount of advance of each line is normally less than the actual dot-size of the laser; the engraved lines overlap just slightly to create a continuity of engravure. As is true of all rasterized devices, curves and diagonals can sometimes suffer if the length or position of the raster lines varies even slightly in relation to the adjacent raster scan; therefore exact positioning and repeatability are critically important to the design of the machine. The advantage of rasterizing is the near effortless &quot;fill&quot; it produces. Most images to be engraved are bold letters or have large continuously engraved areas, and these are well-rasterized. Photos are rasterized (as in printing), with dots larger than that of the laser&#x27;s spot, and these also are best engraved as a raster image. Almost any page-layout software can be used to feed a raster driver for an X–Y or drum laser engraver. While traditional sign and plaque engraving tended to favour the solid strokes of vectors out of necessity, modern shops tend to run their laser engravers mostly in raster mode, reserving vector for a traditional outline &quot;look&quot; or for speedily marking outlines or &quot;hatches&quot; where a plate is to be cut.

==Materials that can be engraved==

=== Natural materials ===
The marking of organic materials like wood is based on material carbonisation which produces darkening of the surface and marks with high contrast. Directly &quot;burning&quot; images on wood were some of the first uses of engraving lasers. The laser power required here is often less than 10 watts depending on the laser being used as most are different. Hardwoods like walnut, mahogany and maple produce good results. Softwoods can be judiciously engraved but tend to vaporise at less-consistent depths. Marking softwood requires the lowest power levels and enables the fastest cut speeds, while active cooling (e.g. a fan with sufficient airflow) inhibits ignition. Hard papers and fiberboard work well; linty papers and newsprint are like softwoods. Fur is not engraveable; finished leathers though can be laser-engraved with a look very similar to hot-branding. Certain latex rubber compounds can be laser engraved; for example these can be used to fabricate inking-stamps.

Paper masking tape is sometimes used as a pre-engraving overcoat on finished and resiny woods so that cleanup is a matter of picking the tape off and out of the unengraved areas, which is easier than removing the sticky and smoky surround &quot;halos&quot; (and requires no varnish-removing chemicals).

===Plastics===
Each plastic has specific material properties, especially the light absorption spectrum. The laser irradiation can generate direct chemical modifications, melting or evaporation of the material. Plastics are rarely seen in their pure state because several additives are used such as colorants, ultraviolet retardants, release agents, etc. These additives impact the result of laser marking.

Standard cast acrylic plastic, acrylic plastic sheet, and other cast resins generally laser very well. A commonly engraved award is a cast acrylic shape designed to be lasered from the back side. Styrene (as in compact disc cases) and many of the thermoforming plastics will tend to melt around the edge of the engraving spot. The result is usually &quot;soft&quot; and has no &quot;etch&quot; contrast. The surface may actually deform or &quot;ripple&quot; at the lip areas. In some applications this is acceptable; for example date markings on 2-litre soda bottles do not need to be sharp.

For signage and face plates, etc., special laser-marked plastics were developed. These incorporate silicate or other materials which conduct excess heat away from the material before it can deform. Outer laminates of this material vaporise easily to expose different coloured material below.

Other plastics may be successfully engraved, but orderly experimentation on a sample piece is recommended. Bakelite is said to be easily laser-engraved; some hard engineering plastics work well. Expanded plastics, foams and vinyls, however, are generally candidates for routing rather than laser engraving. Plastics with a chlorine content (such as vinyl, PVC) produce corrosive chlorine gas when lasered, which combines with Hydrogen in the air to produce vaporised hydrochloric acid which can damage a laser engraving system. Urethane and silicone plastics usually do not work well, unless it is a formulation filled with cellulose, stone or some other stable insulator material.

Kevlar can be laser-engraved and laser-cut. However, Kevlar does give off extremely hazardous fumes (cyanide gas) when it is vaporised.

===Metals===
Metals are heat resistant and thermally conductive, making them more difficult to engrave than other materials. Due to their thermal conductivity, pulsed, rather than continuous wave lasers, are preferred in laser engraving applications. High peak power, low pulse duration lasers are able to ablate material off a metal engraving surface without delivering enough energy to melt the surface.

Metals can not be easily be engraved with common 10,600nm wavelength lasers, on account of many metals having high reflectivity around this wavelength. Yb:Fiber Lasers, Nd:YVO, both emitting light of approximately 1000nm wavelength, at 1,064nm wavelength, or its harmonics at 532 and 355nm, emit light that is more readily absorbed by most metals. They are thus more suitable for the laser engraving of metals.

===Coated metals===
The same conduction that works against the spot vaporisation of metal is an asset if the objective is to vaporise some other coating away from the metal. Laser engraving metal plates are manufactured with a finely polished metal, coated with an enamel paint made to be &quot;burned off&quot;. At levels of 10 to 30 watts, excellent engravings are made as the enamel is removed quite cleanly. Much laser engraving is sold as exposed brass or silver-coated steel lettering on a black or dark-enamelled background. A wide variety of finishes are now available, including screen-printed marble effects on the enamel.

Anodized aluminum is commonly engraved or etched with laser machines. With power less than 40W this metal can easily be engraved with clean, impressive detail. The laser bleaches the color exposing the white or silver aluminum substrate. Although it comes in various colors, laser engraving black anodized aluminum provides the best contrast of all colors. Unlike most materials engraving anodize aluminum does not leave any smoke or residue.

Spray coatings can be obtained for the specific use of laser engraving metals, these sprays apply a coating that is visible to the laser light which fuses the coating to the substrate where the laser passed over. Typically, these sprays can also be used to engrave other optically invisible or reflective substances such as glass and are available in a variety of colours. Besides spray coatings, some laser-markable metals come pre-coated for imaging. Products such as this transform the surface of the metal to a different color (often black, brown or grey).

===Stone and glass===

Stone and glass do not vaporise or melt easily. As a result, this makes them generally a better candidate for other means of engraving, most notably sandblasting or cutting using diamonds and water. However, when a laser hits glass or stone, it fractures. Pores in the surface expose natural grains and crystalline &quot;stubs&quot; which, when heated very quickly, can separate a microscopic sized &quot;chip&quot; from the surface because the hot piece is expanding relative to its surroundings. One should avoid large &quot;fill&quot; areas in glass engraving because the results across an expanse tend to be uneven; the glass ablation simply cannot be depended on for visual consistency, which may be a disadvantage or an advantage depending on the circumstances and the desired effect. , recent advances in UV laser technology now supply 10W (or greater) of UV lasing energy and produce significantly better engraving results on glass than prior, lower powered iterations of UV laser marking systems (i.e. 3W) or classic laser marking systems. The newer UV systems engrave cleanly and clearly without a high degree of micro-fracturing on the mark surface. Since modern 10W UV laser systems heat the surrounding substrate less than other laser marking systems, glass substrates are significantly less prone to fracturing from the laser marking process. High quality fill engravings on thin glass and crystal substrates are now regularly reproducible at high-volume in full production environments.

== Jewelry ==
The demand for personalized jewelry has made jewellers more aware of the benefits of the laser engraving process.

Jewellers found that by using a laser, they could tackle an engraving task with greater precision. In fact, jewellers discovered that laser engraving allowed for more precision than other types of engraving. At the same time, jewellers discovered that laser applied engravings had a number of other desirable features. These features include the customization, personalization, and sheer beauty of these engravings.

At one time jewellers who attempted to do laser engraving did need to use large pieces of equipment. Now the devices that perform laser engraving come in units. Some entrepreneurs have placed such units in mall kiosks. That has made laser engraving jewelers much more accessible. The makers of machines for laser engraving jewellers have developed some very specialized equipment. They have designed machines that can engrave the inside of a ring. They have also created machines that have the ability to engrave the back of a watch.

A laser can cut into both flat and curved surfaces such as the surfaces on jewelry. That points out the reason why jewellers have welcomed all the adaptations for the creation of laser engraved jewelry.

== Fine art ==
Laser engraving can also be used to create works of fine art. Generally, this involves engraving into planar surfaces, to reveal lower levels of the surface or to create grooves and striations which can be filled with inks, glazes, or other materials. Some laser engravers have rotary attachments which can engrave around an object. Artists may digitize drawings, scan or create images on a computer, and engrave the image onto any of the materials cited in this article.

== Trophies, plaques and awards ==
The relatively low cost of laser engraving, driven by automation and inexpensive materials, makes it an ideal solution for personalization of trophies and awards. Whereas hand engraving may be a viable solution for more expensive champion&#x27;s trophies, laser customization lends itself to team and participation trophies which are often ordered in quantity and carry relatively low margins.

Many also prefer the legibility afforded by a laser, which often delivers a crisper appearance than other methods at a much lower cost.

Laserable materials, whether plastic or FlexiBrass, are available in a variety of colors, adding to the popularity of laser personalization for trophies and plaques. The two most popular combinations are gold lettering on a black background and black lettering on a gold background. While the same color combinations are common for plaques as well, the variety of colors used in plaque engraving is more varied.

== Laser etched mirrors ==

As with regular etched mirrors, the initial focus of laser engraving machines was to etch an image onto the glass surface of the mirror. When power, focus and speed are optimized, similar results to sandblasting or chemical etching can be achieved.

In a new form of mirror engraving the laser pulsates through the reflective silver layer at the rear of the mirror. As a result, the glass side of a laser engraved mirror remains intact, maintaining the full reflective qualities of the original mirror.

After the engraving process in finished, the rear of the mirror needs to be &quot;filled&quot; with a new coating to bring out the lasered detail. When a photograph or text is laser engraved, a rear coating of solid black will lend monochromatic images the greatest definition. Coloured coatings can supply chromaticity.

==Industrial applications==

===Direct laser engraving of flexographic plates and cylinders===
Direct laser engraving of flexographic printing cylinders and plates has been an established process since the 1970s. This first began with the use of a carbon dioxide laser used to selectively ablate or evaporate a variety of rubber plate and sleeve materials to produce a print-ready surface without the use of photography or chemicals. With this process there is no integral ablation mask as with direct photopolymer laser imaging. Instead a high-power carbon dioxide laser head burns away, or ablates, unwanted material. The aim is to form sharp relief images with steep first relief and contoured shoulder supported edges to give a high-standard of process color reproduction. A short water wash and dry cycle follows, which is less complex than in the post-processing stages for direct laser imaging or conventional flexo platemaking using photopolymer plates. After engraving, the photopolymer is exposed through the imaged black layer and washed out in the traditional photopolymer process requiring photography and chemicals.

Before the year 2000, lasers only produced lower-quality results in rubber-like materials due to their rough structure. In the 2000s, fiber lasers were introduced, giving a much-increased engraving quality directly into black polymeric materials. At the Drupa 2004 printing exhibition, the direct engraving of polymer plates was introduced. This had also an effect on the rubber developers who, in order to stay competitive, developed new high quality rubber-like materials. The development of suitable polymeric compounds has also allowed the engraving quality achievable with the fiber lasers to be realized in print. Since then, direct laser engraving of flexo-printing forms is seen by many as the modern way to make printing forms for it is the first truly digital method.

As a competitive process, more recent laser systems have been introduced to selectively engrave the thin opaque black layer of a specially produced photopolymer plate or sleeve.

===Direct photopolymer laser imaging===
Closely related is the direct imaging of a digital flexo plates or sleeves &quot;in the round&quot; on a fast-rotating drum or cylinder. This is carried out on a platesetter integrated within a digital prepress workflow that also supports digital proofing. Again, this is a filmless process, which removes one of the variables in obtaining the fine and sharp dots for screened effects, including process color printing.

With this process, the electronically generated image is scanned at speed to a photopolymer plate material that carries a thin black mask layer on the surface. The infrared laser-imaging head, which runs parallel to the drum axis, ablates the integral mask to reveal the uncured polymer underneath. A main ultraviolet exposure follows to form the image through the mask. The remaining black layer absorbs the ultraviolet radiation, which polymerizes the underlying photopolymer where the black layer has been removed. The exposed digital plate still needs to be processed like a conventional flexo plate. That is, using solvent-based washout with the necessary waste recovery techniques, although some water-washable digital plates are in development. This technology has been used since 1995 and is only now becoming more widely used around the world as more affordable equipment becomes available. Trade sources say there are around 650 digital platesetters installed in label, packaging and trade platemaking houses.

===Laser engraving of anilox rolls===
Prior to 1980, anilox rolls were produced by a variety of mechanical processes. These metal anilox rolls were sometimes sprayed with ceramic to prolong their life in the flexographic printing press. During the 1980s laser engraving systems were produced which used a carbon dioxide laser to engrave the required cell pattern directly into the polished ceramic surface. Since then Q-switched YAG lasers were used for a period as they provided a more focusable laser beam as well as increased pulsing frequencies capable of engraving the finer cell configuration demanded by the ever-evolving flexographic printing process. Since approximately the year 2000 the direct anilox laser engraving process has been dominated by the use of fibre lasers which provide the high powers of the carbon dioxide lasers together with the finely focusable beam of the YAG lasers. Optical systems providing the rapid switching of multiple beams have allowed the fibre laser system to be dominant in this market. This technology has become known as Multi-Beam-Anilox or MBA.

===Sub-surface laser engraving (SSLE)===
Sub-surface laser engraving is the process of engraving an image in a transparent solid material by focusing a laser below the surface to create small fractures. Such engraved materials are of high-grade optical quality (suitable for lenses, with low dispersion) to minimize distortion of the beam. BK7 glass is a common material for this application. Plastics are also used, but with far less desirable results when compared to the engraving done in optical crystal.

Since its commercial application in the late 1990s, SSLE has become more cost-effective with a number of different sized machines ranging from small (~US$35,000–60,000) to large production-scale tables (&gt;US$250,000). Although these machines are becoming more available, it is estimated that only a few hundred are in operation worldwide. Many machines require very expensive cooling, maintenance and calibration for proper use. The more popular SSLE engraving machines use the Diode Pumped Solid State or DPSS laser process. The laser diode, the primary component which excites a pulsed solid state laser, can easily cost one third of the machine itself and functions for a limited number of hours, although a good quality diode can last thousands of hours.

Since 2009, use of SSLE has become more cost effective to produce 3D images in souvenir &#x27;crystal&#x27; or promotional items with only a few designers concentrating on designs incorporating large or monolithic sized crystal. A number of companies offer custom-made souvenirs, called bubblegrams or laser crystals, by taking 3D pictures or photos and engraving them into the crystal.

<text>In warfare, infiltration tactics involve small independent light infantry forces advancing into enemy rear areas, bypassing enemy frontline strongpoints, possibly isolating them for attack by follow-up troops with heavier weapons. Soldiers take the initiative to identify enemy weak points and choose their own routes, targets, moments and methods of attack; this requires a high degree of skill and training, and can be supplemented by special equipment and weaponry to give them more local combat options.

Forms of these infantry tactics were used by skirmishers and irregulars dating back to classical antiquity, but only as a defensive or secondary tactic; decisive battlefield victories were achieved by shock combat tactics with heavy infantry or heavy cavalry, typically charging &quot;en masse&quot; against the primary force of the opponent. By the time of early modern warfare, defensive firepower made this tactic increasingly costly. When trench warfare developed to its height in World War I, most such attacks were complete failures. Raiding by small groups of experienced soldiers, using stealth and cover, was commonly employed and often successful, but these could not achieve decisive victory.

Infiltration tactics developed slowly through World War I and early World War II, partially as a way of turning these harassing tactics into a decisive offensive doctrine. At first, only special units were trained in these tactics, typified by German &quot;Stoßtruppen&quot; (shock troops). By the end of World War II, almost all regular ground forces of the major powers were trained and equipped to employ forms of infiltration tactics, though some specialize in this, such as commandos, long-range reconnaissance patrols, US Army Rangers, airborne and other special forces, and forces employing irregular warfare.

While a specialist tactic during World War I, infiltration tactics are now regularly fully integrated as standard part of the modern maneuver warfare, down to basic fire and movement at the squad and section level, so the term has little distinct meaning today. Infiltration tactics may not be standard in modern combat where training is limited, such as for militia or rushed conscript units, or in desperate attacks where an immediate victory is required. Examples are German &quot;Volkssturm&quot; formations at the end of World War II, and Japanese banzai attacks of the same period.

==Development during World War I==
These tactics emerged gradually during World War I. Several nations modified their existing tactics in ways that supported ideas that were later called infiltration tactics, with the German developments having the most impact, both during the war and afterwards.

===Germany===

As far back as the 18th century, Prussian military doctrine stressed maneuver and force concentration to achieve a decisive battle (&quot;Vernichtungsgedanke&quot;). The German military searched for ways to apply this in the face of trench warfare. Captain Willy Rohr fought in the long Battle of Hartmannswillerkopf (1914–1915), starting with two &quot;Pionier&quot; (combat engineer) companies. Such engineers were often employed in assaulting fortifications, using non-standard weapons and tactics compared to the regular infantry. Rohr&#x27;s initial efforts to use these as special advanced strike teams, to break French trench lines for following troops to exploit, achieved only limited success, with heavy losses. Rohr, working with his superiors, saw equipment improved, including the new &quot;Stahlhelme&quot; (steel helmets), ample supplies of hand grenades, flamethrowers, light mortars and light machine guns. Rohr&#x27;s analysis was that much more training was needed to incorporate the new weapons and to coordinate separate attacks as needed to achieve the overall operational goals. His analysis got the attention of the &quot;Oberste Heeresleitung&quot; (&quot;OHL&quot;, German army high command). In December 1915, Rohr was given the task of training the army in &quot;modern close combat&quot;, and soon promoted to major. During the next two years, special &quot;Stoßtruppen&quot; (stormtrooper) detachments were created in divisions throughout the army; select men were sent to Rohr for training, who became trainers when they returned to their units. These tactics were expanded and refined by many in the German military command, extending the Prussian military doctrine down to the smallest units – specially trained troops maneuvered and organised to strike selected positions, wherever opportunities were found.
German infiltration tactics are sometimes called Hutier tactics, after German General Oskar von Hutier, even though his role in developing the tactics was limited. Hutier, along with his artillery commander Colonel Georg Bruchmüller, improved the use of artillery in ways that suited infiltration tactics. Conventional mass-wave tactics were typically preceded by days of constant bombardment of all defender positions, attempting to gain advantage by attrition. Hutier favoured brief but intense hurricane bombardments that allow the opponent little time to react and reinforce their line. The bombardment targeted the opponents&#x27; rear areas to destroy or disrupt roads, artillery, and command centres. This was done to suppress and confuse the defenders and reduce their capability to counterattack from their rearward defence lines. For maximum effect, the exact points of attack remained concealed until the last possible moment, and the infantry attacked immediately following the short bombardment.

The German stormtrooper methods involve men rushing forward in small but mutually supporting groups, using whatever cover is available, and then laying down covering fire for the other groups as they moved. The tactics aim to avoid attacking any strongpoints directly, by first breaching the weakest points of the defender&#x27;s line, and using those to gain positional advantages on other points. Additionally, they acknowledge the futility of managing a grand detailed plan of operations from afar, opting instead for junior officers on the spot to exercise initiative, expanding the earlier Prussian doctrine of &quot;Auftragstaktik&quot; (mission-based tactics).

Due to the extensive training needed, stormtroopers remained small elite forces. Regular infantry with heavy weapons would follow up, using more standard tactics, reducing isolated and weakened opposing strongpoints with flank attacks, as the stormtroopers continued the advance beyond them. Reserve troops following these had to consolidate gains against counterattacks.
The Germans employed and improved infiltration tactics with increasing success, at first defensively in counterattacks as part of Germany&#x27;s defence in depth and then offensively, leading up to the Battle of Caporetto against the Italians in 1917 and finally the massive German spring offensive in 1918 against the British and French. Initial German successes were stunning; of these, Hutier&#x27;s 18th Army gained more than in less than a week – the farthest advance in the Western Front since the Race to the Sea had ended the war of movement in 1914. This advance would hereafter associate Hutier&#x27;s name with infiltration tactics in Western Europe. The German armies began to stall after outrunning their supply, artillery and reinforcements, which could not catch up over the shell-torn ground left ruined by Allied attacks in the Battle of the Somme in 1916; the offensives failed to achieve a war-winning breakthrough dividing the French and British armies. The exhausted German forces lost the initiative and were soon pushed back in the Allied Hundred Days Offensive, ending in the German surrender.

Though far more successful tactically than traditional attacks, infiltration tactics did not address supporting any resulting advances operationally, so they tended to bog-down over time and allow the defender time to regroup. German artillery, critical during the initial assault, lagged far behind afterwards. The elite stormtroopers took notable casualties on the initial attacks, which could not be readily replaced. German forces lacked mobile forces such as cavalry to exploit and secure deep advances. Most importantly, German logistical capabilities, designed for a static front, failed to sustain troops advancing far into devastated enemy territory.

The German military did not use the term &quot;infiltration tactics&quot; as a distinct new manner of warfare but more as a continuous improvement to their wide array of military tactics. When the &quot;new&quot; German tactics made headlines in Allied nations in 1918, the French published articles on the &quot;Hutier tactics&quot; as they saw it; this focused more on the operational surprise of the start of the attack and the effective hurricane bombardment, rather than the low-level tactics. In post-war years, although information on &quot;Hutier tactics&quot; was widely distributed in France, the US and Britain, most generals were skeptical about these new tactics, given the German defeat. In Germany, infiltration tactics were integrated into the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; and the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot;. Felix Steiner, former officer of the &quot;Reichswehr&quot;, introduced the principle of stormtroopers into the formation of the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot;, in order to shape it into a new type of army using this tactic. When combined with armoured fighting vehicles and aircraft to extend the tactics&#x27; operational capabilities, this contributed to what would be called &quot;Blitzkrieg&quot; in the Second World War.

=== France ===

New French tactics that included an initial step for infiltration were published by the &quot;Grand Quartier Général&quot; (GQG, French General Headquarters) on 16 April 1915, in &quot;But et conditions d’une action offensive d’ensemble&quot; (&quot;Goal and Conditions for a General Offensive Action&quot;), its widely circulated version being &quot;Note 5779&quot;. It states that the first waves of infantry should penetrate as far as possible and leave enemy strongpoints to be dealt with by follow-up &quot;nettoyeurs de tranchée&quot; (trench cleaner) waves. The note covers weapons and close-combat tactics for the trench cleaners, but the tactics and weapons of preceding waves are unchanged, and there is little mention of any additional support for the now-detached advanced waves. The note contains annexes covering different subjects, including artillery, infantry defense, and infantry attacks. For attacks, Note 5779 continued to promote the pre-war French doctrine of &quot;la percée&quot; (the breakthrough), where an offensive is driven by a grand, single plan with continuous waves of reserves targeting the operation&#x27;s distant and static objectives. It does not cover methods of adapting to local success or setbacks, nor the small-unit initiative, coordination and additional training this would require. The tactics were employed with some success on the opening day of the Second Battle of Artois, 9 May 1915, by the French XXXIII Corps; they advanced in the first hour and a half of the attack but were unable to reinforce and consolidate to hold onto all these gains against German counterattacks. The battle was costly and inconclusive, taking a heavy toll in French troops and matériel. Later French infantry tactics moved away from the costly &quot;la percée&quot; towards a more practical &quot;grignotage&quot; (literally &quot;nibbling&quot;, taking in small bits) doctrine, which employed a series of smaller and more methodical operations with limited objectives; each of these were still planned at headquarters, rather than from immediate local initiative. Note 5779 also describes an early form of rolling barrage in its artillery annex; this was employed with success and continued to be developed by the French as well as by most other nations throughout the war.

In August 1915, a young French infantry officer, Captain , put forward additional ideas in a pamphlet titled &quot;Étude sur l’attaque dans la période actuelle de la guerre&quot; (&quot;Study of the Attack in the Current Period of the War&quot;). Laffargue based his proposals in particular on his experiences in the initially successful but ultimately disappointing results of employing the tactics of Note 5779 at the Second Battle of Artois; he commanded a company of the 153rd Infantry Regiment, attacking immediately south of Neuville-Saint-Vaast on 9 May 1915. Laffargue was left wounded on the German front line but his regiment advanced another , only to be held up by two German machine guns. Laffargue&#x27;s pamphlet focused primarily on the small-unit perspective, calling for mobile firepower to deal with local resistance such as machine guns, advocating that the first waves of an attack advance through the intervals or gaps between centres of resistance, which should be temporarily neutralised on the edges by fire or heavy smoke. The points of resistance would then be encircled and dealt with by successive waves. This promotes coordinating local forces to deal with local resistance as it is encountered, an important second step in infiltration tactics. Laffargue suggests that had these methods been followed the attack could have resulted in a complete breakthrough of the German defences and the capture of Vimy Ridge.

The French Army published Laffargue&#x27;s pamphlet in 1915 and the following year a commercial edition found wide circulation, but as informational rather than being officially adopted by the French military. The British translated and published Laffargue&#x27;s pamphlet in December 1915 and, like others, continued to make frequent use of wave attacks. The US &quot;Infantry Journal&quot; published a translation in 1916.

In contrast to the infiltration tactics then under development in the German army, the tactics of Note 5779 and as expanded by Laffargue remained firmly wedded to the use of the attack by waves, despite the high casualties which could ensue. Laffargue maintained that the psychological support of the attack in line was necessary to enable men to advance against heavy fire.

In 1916, captured copies of Laffargue&#x27;s pamphlet were translated and distributed by the German army. How much this may have influenced German infiltration tactics is not known; such influence has been dismissed by Gudmundsson. The Germans had started developing their own infiltration tactics in the spring of 1915, months before Laffargue&#x27;s pamphlet was even published.

=== Russia ===

The vast Eastern Front of World War I, much less confined than the Western Front, was much less affected by trench warfare, but trench lines still tended to take hold whenever the front became static. Still, about a third of all Russian divisions remained cavalry, including Cossack divisions.

General Aleksei Brusilov, commanding the Russian Southwestern Front, promoted large-scale simultaneous attacks along a wide front in order to limit defenders&#x27; ability to respond to any one point, thus allowing the collapse of the entire defending line and returning to maneuver warfare. For the Brusilov Offensive of 1916, he meticulously prepared a massive surprise attack on a very wide front stretching from the Pripet Marshes to the Carpathian Mountains, with the objective of Lemburg, Galicia (now Lviv, Ukraine), behind the well-fortified Austro-Hungarian line. The Austro-German military command was confident that these deep and extensive entrenchments, equal to those of the Germans on Western Front, could not be broken without significant Russian reinforcements.

After a thorough reconnaissance, Brusilov directed preparations for several months. Forward trenches were dug as bridgeheads for the attack, which approached the Austro-Hungarian trench lines as closely as . Select forces were trained and tasked with breaking through the defending lines, creating gaps to be widened by 8 total successive waves of infantry, allowing deep penetration. Brusilov committed all his reserves into the initial assault.

Although Brusilov favoured shorter bombardments, the bombardment preparation for this offensive was more than two days long, from 3am on June 4 (May 22 old style) to 9am on June 6 (May 24). This bombardment disrupted the first defense zone and partially neutralized the defending artillery. The first infantry attacks made breakthroughs at 13 points, which were soon increased in width and depth. Austro-Hungarian response to the unexpected offensive was slow and limited, believing that their existing forces and defenses would prove sufficient; instead, reserve units sent forward to counterattack often found their routes already overrun by the Russians. The Russian 8th Army, commanded by Brusilov himself just a few months before his promotion to command the Southwestern Front, achieved the greatest success, advancing in less than a week. The 7th and 9th Army achieved lesser gains, though the remaining 11th Army in the center made no initial breakthroughs. The performance of individual Austro-Hungarian units during the campaign, each raised from separate diverse societies within the Empire, was highly variable, with some units long standing firm despite the odds, like the Polish Legions at the Battle of Kostiuchnówka, whereas others readily retreated in panic or surrendered, as at the Battle of Lutsk.

Though the campaign was devastating to the Austro-Hungarian Army, Russian losses were very high. German forces were sent to reinforce, and the initial Russian advantages waned. Though Russian attacks continued for months, their cost in Russian men and materiel increased while gains diminished. In the end, much like the bold French tactics of &quot;la percée&quot; at the Second Battle of Artois, these tactics were too costly to maintain. The Imperial Russian Army never fully recovered, and the monumental losses of so many Russian soldiers helped fuel the Russian Revolution of 1917, leading to disbanding the Imperial Russian Army.

Though the Brusilov Campaign impressed the German Army High Command, how this may have influenced their further development of infiltration tactics is not known. Elements of Brusilov&#x27;s tactics were eventually used by the Red Army in developing their Deep Battle doctrine for World War II.

=== Britain ===

The British Army pursued a doctrine of integrating new technologies and updating old ones to find advantages in trench warfare.

At the Battle of Neuve Chapelle, March 1915, a well-planned British attack on German trenches, coordinated with short but effective artillery bombardment, achieved a local breakthrough. Though ammunition shortages and command and control issues prevented exploiting the gains, this demonstrated the importance of a combined infantry-artillery doctrine.

Initial experiences in trench warfare, shared between British and French, led both to increase pre-bombardment (requiring dramatically increased artillery munitions production), and also to supply infantry with more firepower, such as light mortars, light machine guns, and rifle grenades. While the British hoped that this new combination of arms, once improved and properly executed, could achieve decisive breakthroughs, the French moved from their pre-war grand &quot;la percée&quot; doctrine to more limited and practical tactical objectives. At this same time, the Germans were learning the value of deep trenches, defense in depth, defensive artillery, and quick counter-attacks.

This came to a head with the British Somme Offensive on 1 July 1916. Douglas Haig, commanding the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), planned on an ambitious large-scale quick breakthrough, with an extensive artillery bombardment targeting the German front-line defenses, followed by a creeping barrage leading a mass infantry assault. Despite planning, execution was flawed, perhaps resulting from the rapid expansion of the British Army. The British losses on the first days were horrific. British operations improved over the next several months of the campaign, however. Learning the limits of battle planning and bombardment, they abandoned single grand objectives, and adopted a &quot;bite and hold&quot; doctrine (equivalent to the French &quot;grignotage&quot;) of limited, local objectives to what could be supported by available artillery in close cooperation. Combining this with new arms was still promoted; Britain&#x27;s new secret weapon, the tank, made its first appearance midway through the Somme operations. Though not yet effective, their promise of breakthroughs in the future was held out.

The British Third Army employed tactics giving platoons more independence at the Battle of Arras in April 1917 (most notably the capture of Vimy Ridge by the Canadian Corps), following the reorganisation of British infantry platoons according to the new Manual SS 143. This still advocated wave attacks, taking strongpoints and consolidating before advancing, part of &quot;bite-and-hold&quot; tactics, but this did allow for more local flexibility, and set groundwork for low-level unit initiative, an important aspect of infiltration tactics.

=== Hurricane bombardment ===
A new method of artillery use evolved during World War I, colloquially called &quot;hurricane bombardment&quot;. This is a very quick but intense artillery bombardment, in contrast to the prevailing artillery tactic of long bombardments. Various forms of quick bombardments were employed at several times and places during the war, but the most successful use of hurricane bombardment was when it was combined with German infiltration tactics in which local forces take immediate advantage of any enemy weak points they find.

After the start of trench warfare in World War I, and artillery moved from direct fire to indirect fire, the standard use of artillery preceding any friendly infantry attack became a very long artillery bombardment, often lasting several days, to destroy the opponent&#x27;s defences and kill the defenders. But trenches were very soon extended to avoid this; they were dug deeper and connected by deep or even underground passages to bunkers far behind the lines, where defenders could safely wait out bombardments. When the bombardment stopped, this signalled the start of the attack to the defenders, and they quickly moved back to their forward positions. This practice of very long bombardments expanded over the course of the war, in the hopes of at least causing a few casualties, damaging surface defences like barbed wire lines and machine gun nests, and exhausting and demoralizing the defenders by the stress of being forced underground for so long, the noise and the vibrations.

The Allies, led by the British, developed alternative artillery tactics using shorter bombardments; these sought to achieve success by surprise. (This was also to use limited ammunition supplies more efficiently.) The effectiveness of short bombardments was dependent on local conditions: the targets had to be identified and located beforehand, many artillery pieces were needed, each with ample ammunition, and the preparations had to be kept hidden from the defenders.

To further increase the chance of success, these short bombardments were sometimes followed by barrages. Many variations were devised, including moving barrages, block barrages, creeping barrages, standing and box barrages. The goal of an artillery barrage was to target a line of impact points repeatedly so as to impede infantry movement; these lines could be held in position or slowly moved to inhibit movement by the opponent or even force them into poor positions. The barrage plans were often quite complicated and could be very effective.
The Germans also experimented with short bombardments and barrages. German Colonel Georg Bruchmüller tailored these significantly to integrate well with infiltration tactics. He began to perfect this while serving as a senior artillery officer on the Eastern Front in 1916. Hurricane bombardments avoided giving the defender several days&#x27; warning of an impending attack – vital for infiltration tactics. Barrages had to be carefully limited for use with infiltration tactics, as both the barrage movement and infantry advance must keep to a timetable, necessarily very methodical and slow to avoid casualties from friendly artillery; this takes away almost all initiative from the advancing infantry. Barrages with infiltration tactics had to be more intense and precise, and quickly moved to deeper targets. Bruchmüller enforced having artillery aim &quot;from the map&quot;, avoiding the typical practise of firing several &quot;registering shells&quot; before a bombardment to adjust the aim of each gun by trial-and-error, alerting the defenders before the full bombardment. Precise aiming without registering shells requires expertise in ballistics with angles and elevation calculated from accurate maps expressly designed for artillery use, knowledge of the effects of altitude and local weather conditions, and also reliable and consistent manufacturing of guns and ammunition to eliminate uncontrolled variation.

Bruchmüller devised intricate, centrally-controlled firing plans for intense bombardments with minimal delays. These plans typically had several bombardment phases. The first phase might be bombardment against enemy communications, telegraph lines, and headquarters, roads and bridges, to isolate and confuse the defenders and delay their reinforcements. The second phase might be against the defenders&#x27; artillery batteries and the third against their front-line trenches to drive them back just before the infantry assault on those positions. The last phase was typically a creeping barrage that moved forward of the advancing infantry to quickly bombard positions just before they are attacked. The phases were usually much more complicated, quickly switching between targets to catch defenders off guard; each bombardment plan was carefully tailored to local conditions. The type of shells depended on the target, such as shrapnel, high explosive, smoke, illumination, short-term or lingering gas shells. The total bombardment time was usually from a couple hours down to just minutes.

The creeping barrage phase is often held out as a key part of infiltration tactics, but its use in infiltration attacks is limited by the fact that the rate of infantry advance cannot be predicted. The quickness, intensity, accuracy, and careful selection of targets for maximum effect is more important.

Allied and German styles of bombardments could use tricks of irregular pauses and switching suddenly between targets for short periods of time to avoid being predictable to the defenders.

Bruchmüller&#x27;s hurricane bombardment tactics in close cooperation with infiltration tactics matured by the time of the German victory at Riga on 3 September 1917, where he served under General Hutier. These bombardment tactics were disseminated throughout the German Army. Hutier and Bruchmüller were transferred together to the Western Front to take part in the Spring Offensive of 1918, where Bruchmüller&#x27;s artillery tactics had great effect on quickly breaking the British lines for Hutier&#x27;s 18th Army. Following that initial attack, the artillery had less effect, as infantry forces advanced faster than artillery and munitions could keep up.

After World War I, use of radios to quickly redirect artillery fire as needed removed any exclusive reliance on time-table driven artillery bombardment.

==Dien Bien Phu==
At the Battle of Dien Bien Phu (1954), Major Marcel Bigeard, commander of the French 6th Colonial Parachute Battalion (6th BPC), used infiltration tactics to defend the besieged garrison against Viet Minh trench warfare tactics. Bigeard&#x27;s parachute assault companies were supported by concentrated artillery and air support and received help from tanks, allowing two companies (the 1st under Lieutenant René Le Page and the 2nd under Lieutenant Hervé Trapp) numbering no more than 180 men to recapture the important hilltop position of Eliane 1 from a full Viet Minh battalion, on the early morning of 10 April 1954. Other parachute battalion and company commanders also used similar tactics during the battle.

<text>In economics, output is the quantity and quality of goods or services produced in a given time period, within a given economic network, whether consumed or used for further production. The economic network may be a firm, industry, or nation. The concept of national output is essential in the field of macroeconomics. It is national output that makes a country rich, not large amounts of money.

== Definition ==

Output is the result of an economic process that has used inputs to produce a product or service that is available for sale or use somewhere else.

&quot;Net output&quot;, sometimes called &quot;netput&quot; is a quantity, in the context of production, that is positive if the quantity is output by the production process and negative if it is an input to the production process.

== Microeconomics ==

=== Output condition ===

The profit-maximizing output condition for producers equates the relative marginal cost of any two goods to the relative selling price of those goods; i.e.

formula_1

One may also deduce the ratio of marginal costs as the slope of the production–possibility frontier, which would give the rate at which society can transform one good into another.

== Macroeconomics ==

===Relation to income===

When a particular quantity of output is produced, an identical quantity of income is generated because the output belongs to someone. Thus we have the identity that output equals income (where an identity is an equation that is always true regardless of the values of any variables).

Output can be sub-divided into components based on whose demand has generated it – total consumption &quot;C&quot; by members of the public (including on imported goods) minus imported goods (the difference being consumption of domestic output), spending by the government, domestically produced goods bought by foreigners, planned inventory accumulation , unplanned inventory accumulation resulting from incorrect predictions of consumer and government demand, and fixed investment on machinery and the like.

Likewise, income can be sub-divided according to the uses to which it is put – consumption spending, taxes paid, and the portion of income neither taxed nor spent (saving ).

Since output identically equals income, the above leads to the following identity:

:formula_2

where the triple-bar sign denotes an identity. This identity is distinct from the goods market equilibrium condition, which is satisfied when unplanned inventory investment equals zero:

:formula_3
Output is the result of an economic process that has used inputs to produce a product or service that is available for sale or use somewhere else.

Net output, sometimes called netput, is a quantity, in the context of production, that is positive if the quantity is output by the production process and negative if it is an input to the production process.

===Fluctuations in output===
In macroeconomics, the question of why national output fluctuates is a very critical one. And though no consensus has developed, there are some factors which economists agree make output go up and down.
If we take growth into consideration, then most economists agree that there are three basic sources for economic growth: an increase in labour usage, an increase in capital usage and an increase in effectiveness of the factors of production.
Just as increases in usage or effectiveness of factors of production can cause output to go up, anything that causes labour, capital or their effectiveness to go down will cause a decline in output or at least a decline in its rate of growth.

==International economics ==

===Exchange of output among nations===

Exchange of output between two countries is a very common occurrence, as there is always trade taking place between different nations of the world. For example, Japan may trade its electronics with Germany for German-made cars. If the value of the trades being made by both the countries is equal at that point of time, then their trade accounts would be balanced: the exports would be exactly equal to imports in both the countries.

<doc id="763708" wikidata="Q93005" url="?curid=763708" title="Herman Goldstine">
<text>Herman Heine Goldstine (September 13, 1913 – June 16, 2004) was a mathematician and computer scientist, who worked as the director of the IAS machine at the Institute for Advanced Study and helped to develop ENIAC, the first of the modern electronic digital computers. He subsequently worked for many years at IBM as an IBM Fellow, the company&#x27;s most prestigious technical position.

==Early life==
Goldstine was born in Chicago in 1913 to Jewish parents. He attended the University of Chicago, where he joined the Phi Beta Kappa fraternity, and graduated with a degree in Mathematics in 1933, a master&#x27;s degree in 1934, and a PhD in 1936. For three years he was a research assistant under Gilbert Ames Bliss, an authority on the mathematical theory of external ballistics.

==Career==
===Early career===
In 1939 Goldstine began a teaching career at the University of Michigan, until the United States&#x27; entry into World War II, when he joined the U.S. Army.

===BRL and the Moore School===
As a result of the United States&#x27; entering World War II, Goldstine left the University of Michigan where he was a professor in July, 1942 to enlist in the Army. He was commissioned a lieutenant and worked as an ordnance mathematician calculating firing tables at the Ballistic Research Laboratory (BRL) at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland. The firing tables were used in battle to find the appropriate elevation and azimuth for aiming artillery, which had a range of several miles.

The firing table calculations were accomplished by about one hundred women operating mechanical_calculators. Each combination of gun, round and geographical region required a unique set of firing tables. It took about 750 calculations to compute a single trajectory and each table had about 3,000 trajectories. It took a human computer at least 7 hours to calculate one trajectory. To increase production, BRL enlisted the computing facilities of the Moore School of Electrical Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania and Goldstine was the liaison between BRL and the university.

====The ENIAC====
While making some adjustments to the Moore School&#x27;s mechanical differential analyzer, engineer Joseph Chapline suggested Goldstine visit John Mauchly, a physics instructor at the Moore School, who had distributed a memorandum proposing that the calculations could be done thousands of times faster with an electronic computer using vacuum tubes. Mauchly wrote a proposal and in June 1943 he and Goldstine secured funding from the Army for the project. The ENIAC was built in 30 months with 200,000 man hours. The ENIAC was huge, measuring 30 by 60 feet and weighing 30 tons with 18,000 vacuum tubes. The device could only store 20 numbers and took days to program. It was completed in late 1945 as World War II was coming to an end.

====The EDVAC====
In spite of disappointment that ENIAC had not contributed to the war effort, interest remained strong in the Army to develop an electronic computer. Prior even to the ENIAC&#x27;s completion, the Army procured a second contract from the Moore School to build a successor machine known as the EDVAC. Goldstine, Mauchly, J. Presper Eckert and Arthur Burks began to study the development of the new machine in the hopes of correcting the deficiencies of the ENIAC.

====Meeting John von Neumann====
In the summer of 1944 Goldstine had a chance encounter with the prominent mathematician John von Neumann on a railway platform in Aberdeen, Maryland, and Goldstine described his project at the University of Pennsylvania. Unbeknownst to Goldstine, von Neumann was then working on the Manhattan Project, which was aiming to build the first atomic bomb. The calculations needed for this project were also daunting.

====The &quot;First Draft&quot;====
As a result of his conversations with Goldstine, von Neumann joined the study group and wrote a memo called &quot;First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC&quot;. Von Neumann intended this to be a memo to the study group, but Goldstine typed it up into a 101-page document that named von Neumann as the sole author. On June 25, 1946, Goldstine forwarded 24 copies of the document to those intimately involved in the EDVAC project; dozens or perhaps hundreds of mimeographs of the report were forwarded to von Neumann&#x27;s colleagues at universities in the United States and in Great Britain in the weeks that followed. While incomplete, the paper was very well received and became a blueprint for building electronic digital computers. Due to von Neumann&#x27;s prominence as a major American mathematician, the EDVAC architecture became known as the von Neumann architecture.

One of the key ideas in the &quot;first draft&quot; was that the programmer could store a program in the computer&#x27;s electronic memory, rather than program the computer using mechanical switches and patch cables. This and other ideas in the paper had been discussed in the EDVAC study group before von Neumann joined the group. The fact that Eckert and Mauchly, the actual inventors and designers of the ENIAC, were not named as co-authors created resentment that led to the group&#x27;s dissolution at the end of the war.

Eckert and Mauchly went on to form the Eckert-Mauchly Computer Corporation, a company that in part survives today as the Unisys Corporation, while von Neumann, Goldstine and Burks moved on into academic life at the Institute for Advanced Study. In Summer 1946, all of them were reunited to give presentations at the first computer course, which has come to be known as the Moore School Lectures; Goldstine&#x27;s presentations, given without notes, covered deeply and rigorously numerical mathematical methods useful in programs for digital computers.

===Institute for Advanced Study===
After World War II Goldstine joined von Neumann and Burks at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, where they built a computer referred to as the IAS machine. Goldstine was appointed as assistant director of the project and was later its director, after 1954.

The IAS machine influenced the design of IBM&#x27;s early computers through von Neumann, who was a consultant to IBM. When von Neumann died in 1957, the IAS computer project was terminated. Goldstine went on to become the founding director of the Mathematical Sciences Department at IBM&#x27;s Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, New York.

===IBM===
At IBM one of Goldstine&#x27;s most significant roles was in fostering relations between IBM researchers and the academic community. In 1969 he was appointed an IBM Fellow, the company&#x27;s most prestigious technical honor, and a consultant to the director of research. As a fellow Goldstine developed an interest in the history of computing and mathematical sciences. He wrote three books on the topic; &quot;The Computer from Pascal to von Neumann&quot;, &quot;History of Numerical Analysis from the 16th Through the 19th Century&quot; and &quot;History of the Calculus of Variations from the Seventeenth Through the Nineteenth Century&quot;. As the title implies, in &quot;The Computer from Pascal to von Neumann&quot;, Goldstine leaves little doubt that in his opinion von Neumann played a critical role in developing modern theories of computing.

===Later career===
In retirement Goldstine became executive director of the American Philosophical Society in Philadelphia between 1985 and 1997, in which capacity he was able to attract many prestigious visitors and speakers.

==Personal life==
In 1941 he married Adele Katz, who was an ENIAC programmer and who wrote the technical description for ENIAC. He had a daughter and a son with Adele, who died in 1964. Two years later, he married his second wife, Ellen Watson.

==Death==
Goldstine died on June 16, 2004, at his home in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, after a long struggle with Parkinson&#x27;s disease. His death was announced by the Thomas J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, New York, where a post-doctoral fellowship was renamed in his honor.

<text>Middleground (April 22, 1947 – February 16, 1972) was an American Thoroughbred racehorse who won the 1950 Kentucky Derby and Belmont Stakes and came second in the Preakness Stakes. He was named the 1950 American Horse of the Year and Champion Three-Year-Old Male.

==Racing career==
Middleground was ridden throughout his career by 16-year-old apprentice jockey Bill Boland, and he was trained by Max Hirsch, both future U.S. Hall of Fame inductees.

As a two-year-old in 1949, Middleground won the Hopeful Stakes and came third in the Arlington Futurity.

The following year, Middleground started the year with second-place finishes both the Withers Stakes and Wood Memorial.

He then won the Kentucky Derby, only the second horse to win it with an apprentice jockey after his sire Bold Venture who won with jockey Ira Hanford. Five time Kentucky Derby winning jockey Eddie Arcaro had the chance to ride Middleground, but he chose to ride Hill Prince instead, who finished second.

After the Kentucky Derby, Middleground finished second to Hill Prince after a rough trip in the Preakness Stakes, and won the Belmont Stakes.

As a three-year-old he also won the Leonard Richards Stakes.

In the 1950 Jerome Handicap, Middleground broke a bone in his foot and was retired.

==Retirement and stud career==
Middleground was retired to stud at King Ranch in 1951. He sired 101 winners and 7 stakes winners in his stud career, including Resaca, Chistosa, and Here and There.

He died in 1972, and the gravesite is on the King Ranch, in Kingsville, Texas.

In 2000, he was inducted into the Texas Horse Racing Hall of Fame.

<doc id="763721" wikidata="Q1143750" url="?curid=763721" title="The Kovenant">
<text>The Kovenant is a Norwegian industrial metal band from Hamar. The band originally formed as a symphonic black metal act known as Covenant in 1993, but in 1999 were forced to change their name to The Kovenant due to a dispute with a Swedish electronic band of the same name. The band&#x27;s name change also marked a change in sound/style as well, as the band from there on began to focus more on a cyber/industrial metal sound heavily influenced by Europe&#x27;s EBM scene. Despite their style change, The Kovenant did however later reissue their early albums under The Kovenant name.

==History==

===The &quot;Covenant&quot; years (1994–1999)===
The band was formed as Covenant in 1993 by two black metal artists known as Nagash and Blackheart. They both met when Blackheart decided to help Nagash with his one-man project Troll. They garnered little attention after releasing a demo titled &quot;From the Storm of Shadows&quot;, but eventually a record label, Mordgrimm, took notice of them and released their first album &quot;In Times Before the Light&quot; in 1997. This album was recorded two years prior in 1995 and established them a fan base in Norway. It sounds similar to Dimmu Borgir&#x27;s first opus &quot;For All Tid&quot;. Indeed, Nagash is a long-time friend to the lead vocalist of Dimmu Borgir, Shagrath.

Covenant signed with Nuclear Blast, a major German label dedicated to the hard rock scene, in 1998 and recruited four other members to form an actual band. These people were Astennu (of Dimmu Borgir, Carpe Tenebrum), Sverd (of Arcturus), Sarah Jezebel Deva (of Cradle of Filth and others), and Hellhammer (of Mayhem and others). With these new recruits, they released their second album, &quot;Nexus Polaris&quot;. The album also resulted in the band getting a Norwegian Grammy for Best Hard Rock Band and led to Nagash leaving Dimmu Borgir (for which he played bass) in order to concentrate fully on The Kovenant.

===Name change and &quot;Animatronic&quot; era (1999–2002)===
After the release of Nexus Polaris, Sverd, Astennu, and Sarah were fired for what Nagash has said to be &quot;various reasons&quot; in several interviews. Only Nagash, Blackheart, and Hellhammer remained. The band then found themselves being sued by a Swedish band of the same name. The Swedish band argued that they owned the name &quot;Covenant&quot; as they had been known as Covenant before Nagash and Blackheart formed their band. Consequently, they were forced to change their name to The Covenant. Unfortunately, simply adding &quot;The&quot; in front of the name would not suffice, because a Dutch heavy metal band had been named The Covenant since 1988. So they added &quot;The&quot; and also replaced the &quot;C&quot; with a &quot;K&quot; to avoid any future confusions, leading to their permanent name &quot;The Kovenant&quot;.

In 1999, The Kovenant recorded and released &quot;Animatronic&quot;, which portrayed a stylistic change to more industrial sound. Soon the band changed their individual stage names to suit their new direction: Nagash became &quot;Lex Icon&quot;, Blackheart became &quot;Psy Coma&quot;, and Hellhammer became &quot;Von Blomberg&quot;. The new album also afforded them another Norwegian Grammy and they gained a new member, Angel, while touring the USA.

After the &quot;Animatronic&quot; tour, Lex and Psy took a break and decided to re-record &quot;In Times Before the Light&quot;. But Nuclear Blast wanted nothing to do with the album, so they changed labels and released it through Hammerheart Records. A re-release of &quot;Nexus Polaris&quot; took place as well during 2002.

===&quot;SETI&quot; and the wait for &quot;Aria Galactica&quot; (2002–present)===
In 2002, the band found themselves back in the studio, recording &quot;SETI&quot;, their fourth album. The full-length release was preceded by a promotional EP &quot;SETI Club&quot;, and both were issued in 2003. Von Blomberg decided to do more touring and left the band to handle other projects. Two new members were recruited: Küth (of Ram-Zet) on drums and Brat (of Apoptygma Berzerk) on keyboards. They then toured Europe and the United States to promote the album.

Currently the band is working on a DVD and a new album titled &quot;Aria Galactica&quot;. Lex Icon announced recently that they have 14 pieces written so far. The album will come with a second disc consisting entirely of symphonic renditions of the tracks from the primary disc, which suggests a return to the more symphonic style exhibited by the band on their 1998 album Nexus Polaris.

The following announcement has once been seen at Lex&#x27;s blog:

In an interview of August 2007, Psy Coma described &quot;Aria Galactica&quot; as &quot;technical&quot;, with more guitar solos, &quot;much stronger&quot; and different from &quot;SETI&quot;. The estimated release date would be Christmas (2007). He also denied any relations between &quot;Aria Galactica&quot; and the DVD, which would be &quot;completely megalomaniac project of making a documentary of [their] entire band history&quot;.

In 2007, the band re-released their debut album, entitled &quot;In Times before the Light 1995&quot;.

In October 2009, The Kovenant were confirmed to be performing their Nexus Polaris album with the original members at the Inferno Festival in Norway, spring of 2010. The Kovenant, along with Mayhem, Finntroll and Taake, were the first four bands to be on the Festival&#x27;s bill.

In February 2010, Lex revealed on his Myspace page: &quot;Yes, we are working on the new album again. And No, The Kovenant is not disbanded. ... Going according to schedule. Just have to get the business side out of the way. (As in what record company it will be released on etc). And we might start having open try-outs for some new blood in the very near future.&quot;

In December 2010, Lex shared &quot;So many things will happen next year... New Troll album, Razor Runner album++, and if the universe doesn&#x27;t stab us in the back; there shall be a new The Kovenant album. Cold hails from Norway!&quot;, showing that the album (and band) have not yet been abandoned.

On 29 October 2011, Nagash did a one-time only performance of their debut album at the Aurora Infernalis III festival in Arnhem, Netherlands. Except for Nagash, no other members of the current incarnation of the band participated.

On 28 January 2024, Photograve Management, an artist management company, posted a photo on their Facebook page of the band in the studio with the caption &quot;The [K]ovenant are back! More info soon.&quot; The Kovenant shared the post on their Facebook the following day.

On 11 April 2024, The Kovenant posted an poster on their Facebook page saying they will be performing Nexus Polaris live in its entirety, starting in Eindhoven, The Netherlands on 13 and 14 of December. The caption reads &quot;The first of many. Coming soon to a city near you. Nexus set plus songs from In Times Before The Light and Animatronic&quot; teasing more shows coming up in the future.

<doc id="763730" wikidata="Q1587078" url="?curid=763730" title="Virginia-class cruiser">
<text>The &quot;Virginia&quot; class (also known as the CGN-38 class) were four nuclear-powered, guided-missile cruisers that served in the United States Navy until the mid-to-late 1990s. The double-ended cruisers (with missile armament carried both fore and aft) were commissioned between 1976 and 1980. They were the final class of nuclear-powered cruisers completed and the last ships ordered as Destroyer Leaders under the pre-1975 classification system.

The ships had relatively short service lives for surface ships. As nuclear-powered ships, they were expensive to operate. The class was coming up for their mid-life reactor refuelings when the 1994 Defense Authorization Bill was being formulated, which would effect cuts of 38% to the Navy&#x27;s budget compared to the 1993 bill. The $300-million-plus cost of each refueling and other upgrades made the class easy targets for decommissioning. Each ship was therefore retired, starting with &quot;Texas&quot; in July 1993 and ending with &quot;Arkansas&quot; in 1998; all went through the nuclear vessel decommissioning and recycling program.

==Class description==
The ships were derived from the earlier &quot;California&quot;-class nuclear cruiser (CGN-36 class). Three of the four &quot;Virginia&quot;-class ships were authorized as guided-missile frigates (in the pre-1975 definition); they were redesignated as cruisers before commissioning or launching. The last ship, &quot;Arkansas&quot;, was authorized, laid down, launched, and commissioned as a guided-missile cruiser. A fifth member of the class, CGN-42, was canceled before being named or laid down.

With their nuclear power plants and the resulting capability of steaming at high speeds for long periods, these ships were excellent escorts for the fast nuclear-powered aircraft carriers, such as the . They also had superb flagship facilities. Their primary mission was as air-defense ships, while they also had capabilities as anti-submarine warfare (ASW) ships, surface-to-surface warfare (SSW) ships, and in gun and missile bombardment of shore targets.

The &quot;Virginia&quot; class, as designed, carried one LAMPS helicopter aft of the superstructure with a flight deck. In a unique arrangement in the U.S. Navy, the hangars were below deck, with an electro-mechanical elevator covered by a telescopic hatch. This improved over the preceding &quot;California&quot; class, which only had a landing pad aft and basic refueling equipment.
It was found that, while it was possible to mass-produce nuclear-powered warships, the ships were less cost-efficient than conventionally powered warships. Also, the new gas turbine-powered ships then entering the fleet—the s—required much less manpower. While eleven ships of the &quot;Virginia&quot; class were planned, only four were produced, and the remainder were canceled. Following the completion of the final member of the class, &quot;Arkansas&quot;, the U.S. Navy continued conventional destroyer/cruiser production, and it redesignated the DDG-47 class of guided-missile destroyers as the CG-47 s.

===Refit===
In the 1980s, the class received a New Threat Upgrade electronics overhaul to better suit them to modern threats. Their rapid-fire Mk 26 launchers could fire the powerful Standard SM-2MR medium-range surface-to-air missile—earlier decommissioned cruisers used the slower-firing Mk 10 launchers, which required manual fitting of the missiles&#x27; fins prior to launch.
Nevertheless, the CGN-38-class cruisers, with their missile magazines and Mk 26 missile launchers, were incapable of carrying the SM-2ER long-range surface-to-air missile; they were restricted to the SM-2MR medium-range surface-to-air missile. This was a significant limitation in their capabilities.

Each member of the class also received Tomahawk cruise missile armored box launchers. The Tomahawk missiles were installed, even though this meant the removal of the LAMPS helicopter as it was found that the elevator and below-deck hangar proved problematic during aviation operations.

===Early decommissioning===

All four vessels were decommissioned as part of the early 1990s &quot;peace dividend&quot; after the Cold War ended, considered by naval standards an early retirement given their designed service life of 38 years. Despite being of a modern design with a recent refit, what doomed the &quot;Virginia&quot; nuclear-powered cruisers was a lack of resources, as the Navy and other branches of the U.S. military faced major budget cutbacks after the Cold War. The ships of the class were coming due for their first nuclear refuelings, mid-life overhauls, and NTU refittings, which were all budgeted projects, together costing about half the price of a new ship. Further, they required relatively large crews, straining the operating budget. The 1996 Navy Visibility and Management of Operating and Support Costs (VAMOSC) study determined the annual operating cost of a &quot;Virginia&quot;-class cruiser at $40 million, compared to $28 million for a &quot;Ticonderoga&quot;-class cruiser, or $20 million for an , the latter two classes designed with the much more capable Aegis Combat System. Given a lower requirement for cruisers, it was decided to retire the &quot;Virginia&quot; class and other nuclear-powered ships as a money-saving measure, a decision made while &quot;Texas&quot; was in the middle of her refueling overhaul. The early &quot;Ticonderoga&quot;-class cruisers, which lacked the Vertical Launch System, had equally short careers, serving between 18 and 21 years.

<doc id="763732" wikidata="Q2470852" url="?curid=763732" title="William Lygon, 7th Earl Beauchamp">
<text>William Lygon, 7th Earl Beauchamp (20 February 1872 – 14 November 1938), styled Viscount Elmley until 1891, was a British Liberal politician. He was Governor of New South Wales between 1899 and 1901, a member of the Liberal administrations of Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman and H. H. Asquith between 1905 and 1915, and leader of the Liberal Party in the House of Lords between 1924 and 1931. When political enemies threatened to make his homosexuality public, he resigned from office to go into exile. Lord Beauchamp is generally considered to be the model for the character Lord Marchmain in Evelyn Waugh&#x27;s novel &quot;Brideshead Revisited&quot;.

==Background and education==
Beauchamp was the eldest son of Frederick Lygon, 6th Earl Beauchamp, by his first wife, Lady Mary Catherine, daughter of Philip Stanhope, 5th Earl Stanhope. He was educated at Eton College and Christ Church, University of Oxford, where he showed an interest in evangelism, joining the Christian Social Union.
Beauchamp&#x27;s mentors included the Eton master Henry Luxmoore, who encouraged his pupils to &quot;strive after what was best in all things&quot;, and Anglican minister the Rev. James Adderley, who believed in practical Christianity, and devoted his life to philanthropy in London&#x27;s East End.

==Early career==

Beauchamp succeeded his father in the earldom in 1891 at the age of 18, and was mayor of Worcester between 1895 and 1896. A progressive in his ideas, he was surprised to be offered the post of Governor of New South Wales in May 1899. Though he was good at the job and enjoyed the company of local artists and writers, he was unpopular in the colony for a series of gaffes and misunderstandings, most notably over his reference to the &quot;birthstain&quot; of Australia&#x27;s convict origins. His open association with the high church and Anglo-Catholicism caused increased perturbation in the Evangelical Council.

In Sydney, William Carr Smith, rector of St James&#x27; Church was his chaplain. Beauchamp returned to Britain in 1900, saying that his duties had failed to stimulate him.

==Political career==
In 1902, Beauchamp joined the Liberal Party and the same year he married Lady Lettice Mary Elizabeth Grosvenor, the daughter of Victor Grosvenor, Earl Grosvenor. When the Liberals came to power under Henry Campbell-Bannerman in December 1905, Beauchamp was appointed Captain of the Honourable Corps of Gentlemen-at-Arms and was sworn of the Privy Council in January 1906. In July 1907, he became Lord Steward of the Household, a post he retained when H. H. Asquith became Prime Minister in 1908. He entered the cabinet as Lord President of the Council in June 1910, a post that he held until November of the same year, when he was appointed First Commissioner of Works.

Identified with the radical wing of the Liberal Party, Beauchamp also chaired (in December 1913) the Central Land and Housing Council, which was designed to advance Lloyd George&#x27;s Land Campaign. He was again Lord President of the council from 1914 to 1915. However, he was not a member of the coalition government formed by Asquith in May 1915. Lord Beauchamp never returned to ministerial office but was the Liberal leader in the House of Lords from 1924 to 1931, supporting the ailing party with his substantial fortune.

While serving in Parliament, Beauchamp also voiced his support for a range of progressive measures such as workmen&#x27;s compensation, an expansion in rural housing provision, an agricultural minimum wage, improved safety standards and reduced working hours for miners.

==Other public appointments==

Beauchamp was appointed Honorary Colonel of the 1st Worcestershire Royal Garrison Artillery (Volunteers) on 5 November 1902.

He was made Lord Lieutenant of Gloucestershire in 1911, carried the Sword of State at the coronation of King George V, was made Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports in 1913 and a Knight of the Garter in 1914. He was also Chancellor of the University of London and a Six Master (Governor of RGS Worcester).

In June 1901, Beauchamp received an honorary Doctor of Laws (LLD) degree from the University of Glasgow.

==Sexuality and blackmail==
In 1931, Lord Beauchamp was &quot;outed&quot; as a homosexual. Although Beauchamp&#x27;s homosexuality was an open secret in parts of high society and one that his political opponents had refrained from using against him despite its illegality, Lady Beauchamp was oblivious to it and professed a confusion as to what homosexuality was when it was revealed. At one stage she thought her husband was being accused of being a bugler. He had numerous affairs at Madresfield and Walmer Castle, with his partners ranging from servants to socialites, including local men.

In 1930, while on a trip to Australia, it became common knowledge in London society that one of the men escorting him, Robert Bernays, a member of the Liberal Party, was a lover.

It was reported to King George V and Queen Mary by Beauchamp&#x27;s Tory brother-in-law, the Duke of Westminster, who privately disliked Beauchamp and hoped to ruin both him and the Liberal Party through Beauchamp&#x27;s downfall. Homosexual practice was a criminal offence at the time, and the King was horrified, rumoured to have said, &quot;I thought men like that shot themselves&quot;.

The King had a personal interest in the case, as his sons Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester and Prince George, Duke of Kent, had visited Madresfield in the past. George was then in a relationship with Beauchamp&#x27;s daughter Lady Mary, which was cut off by her father&#x27;s outing.

After sufficient evidence had been gathered by the Duke, Beauchamp was made an offer to separate from his wife Lettice, retire on a pretence and then leave the country. Beauchamp accepted and left the country immediately in June 1931, living a nomadic life in the global homosexual hotspots of the time. Shortly afterwards, the Countess Beauchamp obtained a divorce. There was no public scandal, but Lord Beauchamp resigned all his offices. However, he held on to the sinecure of Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports until 1934. Following his departure for the continent, his brother-in-law sent him a note which read. &quot;Dear Bugger-in-law, you got what you deserved. Yours, Westminster.&quot;

Lord Beauchamp&#x27;s last partner was David Smyth (né Glory Smyth-Pigott: son of John Smyth-Pigott, second leader of the messianic sect the Agapemonites), to whom he left a Sydney mansion and share portfolio.

==Literary inspiration==
Lord Beauchamp is generally supposed to have been the model for Lord Marchmain in Evelyn Waugh&#x27;s novel, &quot;Brideshead Revisited&quot;. They were both aristocrats in exile, though for different reasons. In his 1977 book, &quot;Homosexuals in History&quot;, historian A. L. Rowse suggests that Beauchamp&#x27;s failed appointment as Governor of New South Wales was the inspiration for Hilaire Belloc&#x27;s satirical children&#x27;s poem, &quot;&quot;, which has in its final lines a command to Lord Lundy from his aged grandfather: &quot;But as it is!...My language fails! Go out and govern New South Wales!&quot;. Nevertheless, says Rowse, &quot;Lord Lundy&#x27;s chronic weakness was tears. This was not Lord Beauchamp&#x27;s weakness: he enjoyed life, was always gay.&quot;

==Family==

Lord Beauchamp married at Eccleston, Cheshire, on 26 July 1902 Lady Lettice Grosvenor, daughter of Victor Grosvenor, Earl Grosvenor, and Lady Sibell Lumley, and granddaughter of the 1st Duke of Westminster. They had three sons and four daughters:
* William Lygon, 8th Earl Beauchamp (3 July 1903 – 3 January 1979), the last Earl Beauchamp. His widow, Mona, &quot;née&quot; Else Schiewe, died in 1989.
* The Hon. Hugh Patrick Lygon (2 November 1904 – 19 August 1936, Rothenburg, Bavaria), said to be the model for Lord Sebastian Flyte in &quot;Brideshead Revisited&quot;.
* Lady Lettice Lygon (16 Jun 1906–1973), who married 1930 (div. 1958) Sir Richard Charles Geers Cotterell, 5th Bt. (1907–1978) and had children.
* Lady Sibell Lygon (10 October 1907 – 31 October 2005), who married 11 February 1939 (bigamously) and 1949 (legally) Michael Rowley (d. 19 September 1952), stepson of her maternal uncle, the 2nd Duke of Westminster.
* Lady Mary Lygon (12 February 1910 – 27 September 1982), who married 1937 (div.) HH Prince Vsevolod Ivanovich of Russia, and had no children.

Lord Beauchamp died of cancer in New York in 1938, aged 66. He was succeeded in the earldom by his eldest son, William. The children never made peace with their mother for her role in the downfall of their father; Lady Beauchamp, &quot;having always being disliked and now hated by her children&quot; was evicted from Madresfield Court by her daughters and spent the remainder of her life at her brother&#x27;s estate in Cheshire. Lady Beauchamp died in 1936, aged 59, estranged from all her children except her youngest child.

<text>The Queets River is a river in the U.S. state of Washington. It is located on the Olympic Peninsula, mostly within the Olympic National Park and empties into the Pacific Ocean.

The Queets River is long. Its drainage basin is in area. Its main tributaries include the Clearwater River, Salmon River, Sams River, Matheny Creek, and Tshetshy Creek, as well as the Clearwater&#x27;s main tributaries, the Snahapish River and Solleks River.

==History==
According to Queets and Quinault legend, river was originally called &quot;K&#x27;witzqu&quot; or &quot;quitzqu&quot;, pronounced &quot;Kw-ā-tz&quot;, meaning &quot;out of the dirt of the skin&quot;. The legend tells of &quot;Kwate&quot;, the changer, or &quot;s&#x27;qitu&quot;, the Great Spirit and Transformer, came to the mouth of the Queets River. After fording the cold river he rubbed his legs to restore circulation, small rolls of dirt formed under his hand. He threw them into the water and from them a man and a woman came forth, who became the ancestors of the Queets people. Kwate told them they would remain on the river and would be known as &quot;K&#x27;witzqu&quot;, because of the dirt from which your skin was made. According to William Bright the river&#x27;s name comes from the Quinault word &quot;/q&#x27;ʷícx̣ʷ/&quot;, meaning &quot;dirt&quot;.

The name &quot;Queets River&quot; first appeared on the Surveyor General&#x27;s map of Washington Territory and was later applied to other features. The word &quot;Queets&quot; was derived from the name of the &quot;Quai&#x27;tso&quot; tribe (Queets). Despite the name Queets River appearing on official maps, settlers called it Big River for many years, in contrast to its tributary the Clearwater River, which was called the Little River.

==Course==

The Queets River originates at the foot of the Humes Glacier on the southeast side of Mount Olympus in the Olympic Mountains. It is also fed by Jeffers Glacier, on the south side of Mount Olympus, and Queets Glacier, on the north side of Mount Queets. The river flows through a narrow canyon, cascading over Service Falls en route, to a point just below Paull Creek, where the valley opens up a bit. From there the river flows generally west to just below Kilkelly Creek, then south to just below Alta Creek, where the valley width expands once more into a typical U-shaped valley glacial river valley. The Queets then flows generally southwest, collecting numerous tributaries including the Clearwater River, Salmon River, and Sams River before emptying into the Pacific Ocean near the community of Queets.

Nearly all of the river is within Olympic National Park. The last are outside the park, within the Quinault Indian reservation. A short portion of the river near its mouth is within Grays Harbor County while the rest is in Jefferson County.

==Natural history==
The Queets River is unusual in being a large river flowing through a relatively low-gradient, heavily forested alluvial valley. The forests on the western side of the Olympic Mountains have one of the highest rates of biomass production per unit area in North America. Discharge rates in the winter can be very high, sometimes with surges up to or over . This combination results in frequent log jams and new channels. The river is not kept clear of woody debris, making it one of the few North American rivers of its size in which large log jams are common. The USGS operates a stream gage above the mouth of the Queets, downriver from the mouth of the Clearwater River. The mean annual discharge recorded over the lifetime of this gage up to 2009, is . The peak maximum discharge was , recorded on December 15, 1999. The maximum daily mean discharge was , recorded on March 19, 1997. A minimum daily mean discharge of was recorded from September 25–28, 2005.

==Recreation==
There is a primitive National Park Service campground and ranger station (no longer staffed) at the end of the Queets River Road. The Queets River Trail begins on the north bank of the river, across from the campground, and follows the river about upstream. Access to the trailhead requires fording the Queets River, which can be treacherous.
There are primitive campsites along the trail at the Lower Crossing Way Trail junction and Spruce Bottom.

The river is runnable by kayak or canoe from the campground to the Highway 101 bridge (roughly ), but is replete with hazards, mainly in the form of log jams.

<text>The Hoh River is a river of the Pacific Northwest, located on the Olympic Peninsula in the U.S. state of Washington. About long, the Hoh River originates at the snout of Hoh Glacier on Mount Olympus and flows westward through the Olympic Mountains of Olympic National Park and Olympic National Forest, then through foothills in a broad valley, emptying into the Pacific Ocean at the Hoh Indian Reservation. The final portion of the Hoh River&#x27;s course marks the boundary between the south coastal segment of Olympic National Park and the Hoh Indian Reservation.

The Hoh&#x27;s drainage basin is . Its discharge, or streamflow, has considerable seasonal variation, with summer flow averaging about one-third that of winter flows.

The Hoh is a glacial river fed by glaciers on Mount Olympus, such as the Blue Glacier. The glaciers grind rock into a fine glacial flour which turns the Hoh River a milky slate blue color. The river valley is generally broad and relatively flat, causing the glacial sediments to settle out, creating extensive gravel bars, river meanders, and the many side channels characteristic of a braided river.

One of the road entrances to Olympic National Park exits from Olympic Highway 101 twelve miles south of Forks, WA and follows the north bank of Hoh River upstream to the Hoh Rain Forest Visitor Center, campground, and the trailhead for the Hoh River Trail. This hiking trail follows the river 12 miles through the Hoh Rain Forest to the base of Mount Olympus, and then continues to climb steeply another 6 miles to Glacier Meadows campsite, and the start of the primary climbing route for Mount Olympus. Logjams in the river channel are common, resulting in quiet pools and new river braids being formed.

The river&#x27;s name and the name of the Hoh tribe both ultimately come from the Quinault placename /húxw/.

==Course==
The source of the Hoh River is meltwater from Hoh Glacier on the northeast side of Mount Olympus. The river flows north then west, curving around the entire north side of the mountain. It collects headwater tributaries from other glaciers on Mount Olympus including Glacier Creek, which flows from Blue Glacier and White Glacier, and the Ice River, which flows from the nearby Ice River Glacier on Mount Mercury. Mount Tom Creek, a tributary which joins the Hoh farther downstream, has its source in a western arm of the White Glacier as well. Other headwater tributaries include Elkhorn Creek and Cream Lake Creek, both of which originate from the Bailey Range. About a mile below the Glacier Creek confluence, at approximately Hoh river mile 48, the valley broadens and the Hoh begins to take on the braided channel characteristic of a bottomland river. Falls Creek joins from the south, then Slate Creek and Hoh Creek from the north.

Olympus Ranger Station, a National Park Service cabin, is located on the north side of the river at approximately river mile 45, near the junction of the Hoh River Trail and the Hoh Lake Trail. The Happy Four backcountry camping area is located along the river trail a few miles downstream. Below that the tributary Cougar Creek joins from the north, then Mount Tom Creek from the south. Jackson Creek joins from the south at approximately river mile 37 near the Hoh Rain Forest Visitor Center and campground. The Visitor Center is located at the end of Upper Hoh Road and the beginning of the Hoh River Trail. The Upper Hoh Road runs east from U.S. Highway 101, paralleling the Hoh River from Willoughby Creek Campground to the national park. In the region near the national park boundary the Hoh River occupies a U-shaped valley with a flat bottom about one mile across. Mountain slopes rise steeply on either side.

The Hoh River continues flowing west, collecting numerous tributary streams, the most important being the South Fork Hoh River, which joins the main Hoh at about river mile 31. About a mile below the South Fork confluence the Hoh River leaves Olympic National Park. It continues to flow west through a widening valley surrounded by low mountains and foothills. Ranches occupy parts of the valley and land ownership is generally private. Owl Creek and Maple Creek join from the south. The Hoh makes a small northward bend, skirting the edge of, and briefly entering Olympic National Forest. Elk Creek joins from the south, then Alder Creek from the north, then Winfield Creek from the south, after which the Hoh River flows through a large horseshoe bend located at about river mile 15. Hell Roaring Creek joins the horseshoe bend from the north. Three campgrounds are sited along the river upstream from the horseshoe bend, including Minnie Peterson, Willoughby Creek, and Hoh Oxbow. All three are managed by Washington State Department of Natural Resources (DNR). Hoh Ox Bow Campground is located just west of the horseshoe bend near where U.S. Highway 101 crosses the river. Highway 101 follows the river on the south side. The small Oil City Road follows the Hoh River on the north side to the river&#x27;s mouth. Cottonwood Campground, another DNR site, is on the north side of the Hoh River, accessed by Oil City Road.
Below the horseshoe bend the Hoh River begins to meander widely through a broad and flat coastal floodplain. In its final miles the Hoh River collects the tributaries Braden Creek, Fletcher Creek and Fossil Creek. Highway 101 leaves the river at this point and continues south. About two miles from its mouth the Hoh River forms the boundary between the Hoh Indian Reservation on the south bank, and the coastal portion of Olympic National Park to the north. The former settlement of Oil City is located on the north side of the Hoh River about a half mile from its mouth. A large headland peninsula called Hoh Head is located on the Pacific coast a few miles north of the river&#x27;s mouth.

===South Fork===
The South Fork Hoh River originates at , flowing from Hubert Glacier and other small glaciers on the south side of Mount Olympus. It flows generally west through Olympic National Park collecting many tributary streams. At about river mile 11 it enters a broad glacially carved U-shaped valley and becomes braided. The South Fork leaves Olympic National Park at approximately river mile 4, entering Olympic National Forest. It turns slightly northwest and joins the main Hoh River at approximately Hoh river mile 31. South Fork Campground, managed by Washington State DNR, is located on the South Fork. The road to the campground continues up the South Fork Hoh River to the South Fork Hoh Trailhead, just west of the national park boundary.

==History==
The indigenous people of the Hoh River are known as the Hoh but they call themselves &quot;chalat&#x27;&quot;. Their name for the Hoh River is &quot;chalak&#x27;ac&#x27;it&quot;.

The earliest documented encounter between Europeans and the Hoh people occurred in 1787 when the British fur trader Charles William Barkley, captain of the &quot;Imperial Eagle&quot;, dispatched a boat up the Hoh River to trade with the natives. The boat&#x27;s crew of six were killed by the Hoh people, according to European histories. The incident led to the naming of Destruction Island. Barkley named the river Destruction River, but the name became attached to the island instead. The Hoh people deny the story, saying they never massacred ship-wrecked sailors.

In 1808 the Russian American Company set two vessels south from Russian America as part of an effort to expand Russian control south to the Columbia River and beyond. One of the vessels, the schooner &quot;Sv. Nikolai&quot; ran aground at Rialto Beach, north of the Quillayute River. Tension between the crew and the local Hohs led to battle. The Russians fled south along the coast to the mouth of the Hoh River where many were captured and taken captive by the Hoh people. Those who evaded capture fled up the Hoh River. They built a small blockhouse and survived into the winter. In February they surrendered to the Hoh tribe at the mouth of the Hoh River. The captives were exchanged and traded among the coastal tribes, with most ending up with the Makah in the Neah Bay area. In 1810 the &quot;Lydia&quot;, commanded by Captain T. Brown, an American working for the Russian American Company, sailed into Neah Bay. The thirteen surviving captives being held by the Makah were ransomed by Captain Brown, who then returned them to Sitka.

In the 1850s Isaac Stevens, the first governor of Washington Territory, began negotiations with the tribes of the Olympic Peninsula with the goal of obtaining land cessions and creating Indian reservations. In 1855 a treaty was signed by representatives of the Quinault, Queets, Quileute, and Hoh. The negotiations were done in the trade pidgin language Chinook Jargon. The treaty, known as the Treaty of Olympia (or the Quinault River Treaty), was ratified by Congress in 1859. Its terms included the cession of most of the western Olympic Peninsula to the U.S. federal government with a reserve to be determined later. The Quinault Indian Reservation was established in 1863 and the treaty signature tribes were expected to move there. The Hoh, however, refused to move. In 1872 the Indian agent R.H. Milroy explained that the Hoh did not believe they had agreed to cede their land and that the treaty signed had been explained to them as being an agreement about keeping peace with U.S. citizens and allowing them to enter the Hoh&#x27;s territory and trade for furs. In 1893 President Grover Cleveland signed an executive order establishing the Hoh Reservation on the south side of the mouth of the Hoh River.

Early pioneers wishing to settle in the Hoh River valley faced numerous challenges including the dense forest and enormous trees, regular large-scale flooding, isolation from markets, and the impracticality of navigating the Hoh River due to its swift current, floods, and frequent logjams. Nevertheless, land relatively far upriver was settled. The area now within Olympic National Park was never inhabited by non-indigenous people. By 1900 the population in the Hoh River Valley was enough to warrant two post offices, one established in 1897, the other in 1904. Over time the population dwindled. By 1919 there were few people left. Abandoned structures rapidly deteriorated in the wet environment. The few historic structures that used to exist in the Hoh River Valley are entirely gone today.

On the north side of the mouth of the Hoh River, across from the Hoh Indian Reservation, the town of Oil City was established in 1911 by Frank W. Johnson and the Olympic Oil Company. Natives had already discovered the oil, which seeps to the surface. This was to be a deep water oil port. Many of the lots were bought on the hopes of oil prosperity, but some were used for vacation homes. Oil drilling operations were conducted by the Milwaukee Oil Co., the Washington Oil Co., the Jefferson Oil Co. and others in the surrounding areas. No significant commercial oil reserves were found. Later, two-thirds of the platted city were returned to the state which now forms part of the Olympic Wilderness Park. http://www.historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&amp;file_id=7446

==Natural history==

A significant part of the Hoh River flows through the Hoh Rainforest, a relatively rare example of a temperate rain forest. Abundant winter rainfall results in a lush green canopy of coniferous and deciduous trees, often covered with mosses and ferns. Annual precipitation is . According to the National Park Service the Hoh Rain Forest is one of the finest remaining examples of temperate rain forest in the United States. It is one of the most popular destinations of Olympic National Park. Giant Western Hemlock, Douglas-fir, Thuja plicata (Western Red Cedar), and Sitka Spruce trees dominate the landscape, while ferns and mosses cloak the trees and forest floor. Fallen trees often become nurse logs.

When Olympic National Park was created in 1938 one of its primary objectives was to protect the herds of Roosevelt elk. Today about 400 of the park&#x27;s 4,000–5,000 elk live in the Hoh River valley.

The Hoh River supports a variety of salmonid fish, including spring and fall chinook, coho salmon, winter and summer steelhead, and sea-run coastal cutthroat trout. There are also smaller numbers of chum and sockeye salmon. The Hoh River fishery is managed by the Hoh tribe in cooperation with the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife .

==Land use==
Land administration within the Hoh River&#x27;s watershed, approximately, is 57.6% National Park Service (), 24.4% state (), 17.6% private (), 0.22% National Forest (), and 0.21% Hoh Indian Reservation ().

==Recreation==

The Hoh River Trail, managed by the National Park Service, begins at the national park&#x27;s Hoh Rain Forest Visitor Center at the end of the Upper Hoh Road. The trail follows the Hoh River east into the heart of the park. After it reaches Glacier Meadows near Mount Olympus&#x27;s Blue Glacier. The Hoh River Trail begins at an altitude of about and the trail is mostly flat for about , after which it ascends steeply to Glacier Meadows, altitude . The trail passes through the Hoh Rain Forest, a temperate rain forest, and, closer to Mount Olympus, montane forests and subalpine meadows. There are a number of backcountry campsites along the trail. Mountaineers wishing to climb Mount Olympus typically use the Hoh River Trail to reach the mountain. The climb requires experience with glacier travel and crevasse rescue skills.

The Hoh Lake Trail branches off from the Hoh River Trail near the Olympus Ranger Station and ascends to Hoh Lake and Bogachiel Peak, then across High Divide into the Sol Duc River valley.

The Oil City Trail, managed by Olympic National Park, begins on the north side of the mouth of the Hoh River and runs about a mile to the Pacific coast. People can hike north along the coast to Hoh Head and beyond.

<text>Interstate 690 (I-690) is an auxiliary Interstate Highway that extends for through the vicinity of Syracuse, New York, in the United States. It is a spur of I-90 (here part of the New York State Thruway) that travels southeast from Thruway exit 39 in Van Buren to I-481 in DeWitt. In between, I-690 passes through the western suburbs of Syracuse before heading east through the city itself, where it meets I-81 in Downtown Syracuse. The freeway continues northwest of the thruway as New York State Route 690 (NY 690).

==Route description==
I-690 begins at a double trumpet interchange with the New York State Thruway (I-90) in the town of Van Buren. The six-lane, fully-shouldered limited-access highway continues north toward Baldwinsville as NY 690 while I-690 travels east from the junction. Even though I-690 continues north of the thruway as NY 690, the numbering system on I-690 does not continue with the route. The interchange with the thruway is labeled as exit 1A, leaving exits on NY 690 without numbers. Additionally, NY 690 is signed north–south while I-690 is signed east–west. Before physically crossing I-90, it features a partial interchange with John Glenn Boulevard and turns southeast.
After crossing and connecting with State Fair Boulevard at exit 2, I-690 runs along the western shore of Onondaga Lake, passing under many pedestrian bridges. The highway serves the New York State Fairgrounds by way of exits 4 and 5, the former a large directional T interchange with NY 695. Within this interchange was a signalized, at-grade intersection that connected I-690 to a parking area. For 12 days each year, the light was used to allow buses to carry New York State Fair attendees from the parking area across the road to the fair. I-690 was one of only a few Interstate Highways to feature a traffic light. Construction began in 2019 and finished in 2020 of a bridge overpass to this parking area, eliminating the need for a traffic signal.

The freeway continues along the shore and bears toward the downtown area, where the shoulders frequently disappear and the buildings are often situated close to the freeway. It passes over a railroad grade and Hiawatha Boulevard before meeting NY 298 (Bear Street) at exit 7. In the interchange with NY 5 to the east, two lanes of I-690 disappear, and I-81 follows directly after in the center of the city with an incomplete interchange. There is no direct freeway ramp from I-690 east to I-81 north and I-81 south to I-690 west. NY 298, which connects to I-81 at exit 5A west of the I-81/I-690 interchange, must be used to make these connections.

I-690 rewidens to six lanes as it proceeds eastward out of Downtown Syracuse. from downtown, it connects to Burnet and Midler avenues by way of exit 11. The latter is designated as NY 598; however, it is not signed as such from I-690. After a curve to the southeast, NY 635 meets the route at a cloverleaf interchange, utilizing collector–distributor roads to do so. The collector–distributor roads continue to a partial cloverleaf interchange (parclo) with Bridge Street, where they end. Shortly after this interchange, I-690 terminates at I-481.

==History==
The portion of the modern I-690 corridor west of Downtown Syracuse was originally served by NY 48, a route assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. NY 48 followed the length of State Fair Boulevard from Van Buren to Downtown Syracuse, where it followed several local streets to reach NY 5. In the early 1960s, work began on a new freeway extending from the New York State Thruway to Syracuse by way of the western shoreline of Onondaga Lake. The new road, designated as I-690, was completed from the thruway to NY 298 by 1962. I-690 supplanted State Fair Boulevard as the primary highway through the area, and, from NY 297 southeast, State Fair Boulevard was upgraded on the spot. As a result, NY 48 was truncated to its current southern terminus in Van Buren.

The section of I-690 near the New York State Fairgrounds was originally a surface highway. When I-690 was extended eastward through downtown to Midler Avenue (now NY 598) in the mid-1960s, I-690 was moved onto its current, limited-access routing. State Fair Boulevard runs on the former I-690 eastbound right-of-way, while a service road occupies the westbound right of way. State Fair Boulevard continues east along this right-of-way onto a ramp to I-690. The section of I-690 between Midler Avenue and I-481 was completed in the early 1970s. I-690 gained when its western terminus was relocated in 1987. The interchange with the thruway was relocated and completely rebuilt, forcing a complete renumbering of all the exits on the highway.

I-690 follows the former New York Central Railroad (NYC) roadbed through a portion of Downtown Syracuse and actually cuts through the site of the former Syracuse station. A remnant of the former railroad station platforms is visible to the north of the freeway, with plaster statues of people waiting for trains, who are occasionally dressed up for winter by area residents with scarves and other winter apparel. Time Warner Cable, which restored the building as the base of its Central New York operations and Spectrum News 1 Central New York, also has a rail-focussed mural along the back of that building fronting I-690.

In mid-2009, the New York State Department of Transportation posted new milemarkers on both NY 690 and I-690. The mileposts treat the entire length of both routes as a single entity, with mile 0 being at the northern terminus of NY 690 at NY 48 and mile 20 being near the eastern terminus of I-690 at I-481.

There have been plans for decades to extend I-690 eastward from I-481 to Manlius or to the far east suburb of Chittenango; however, these plans have yet to become a reality. Several unused ramps exist at the interchange between I-481 and I-690, intended to connect to an extended I-690.

==Future==
As part of the community grid solution for I-81 in Downtown Syracuse, a section of I-690 around the intersection with I-81 will be rebuilt. Bridges along this section will be replaced, and the rebuilt highway will feature wider lanes and bigger shoulders, and realign to southerly (further south of the former New York Central Railroad station track area). The state is also proposing the elimination of exit 13 (Townsend Street, exit soon to be unnumbered), the restructuring of exits 11 (West Street, soon to be exit 8A) and 12 (West Genesee Street, exit soon to be unnumbered), and the addition of an exit at Crouse Avenue and Irving Avenue to provide better access to Syracuse University. Construction along I-690 is part of Phase Two of the community grid project, which would take approximately three years. The entire project is expected to start mid-2020 and take five years. Also, the existing exit numbers along I-690 will be renumbered to reflect the mile-based exit numbers.

<text>Eliza Amy Forbes Carthy, MBE (born 23 August 1975) is an English folk musician known for both singing and playing the fiddle. She is the daughter of English folk musicians Martin Carthy and Norma Waterson.

==Life and career==
Carthy was born in Scarborough, North Yorkshire, England. She went to school at Fyling Hall School in North Yorkshire.

She grew up on a family farm along with her maternal aunt and uncle&#x27;s families who lived adjacent.

At thirteen, Carthy formed the Waterdaughters with her mother, aunt (Lal Waterson) and cousin Marry Waterson. She has subsequently worked with Nancy Kerr, with her parents as Waterson–Carthy, and as part of the &quot;supergroup&quot; Blue Murder, in addition to her own solo work. When she was 13, Carthy joined the Goathland Plough Stots as a fiddle player. She left school at 17 for a career as a professional touring musician.

She has twice been nominated for the Mercury Music Prize for UK album of the year: in 1998 for &quot;Red Rice&quot;, and again in 2003 for &quot;Anglicana&quot;. Carthy was a guest on the album &quot;Mermaid Avenue&quot; by Billy Bragg and Wilco. Eliza and Billy also recorded together on the song &quot;My Father&#x27;s Mansions&quot; which appeared on the Pete Seeger tribute album called &quot;Where Have All The Flowers Gone&quot; (1998).

In September 2002, Carthy took part in the tribute concert for Kirsty MacColl, &quot;The Song&#x27;s the Thing&quot; along with other artists.

In 2003, Carthy swept the boards at the Radio 2 Folk Awards, winning &#x27;Folk Singer of the Year&#x27;, &#x27;Best Album&#x27; (for &quot;Anglicana&quot;) and &#x27;Best Traditional Track&#x27; (for &quot;Worcester City&quot;, on the album &quot;Anglicana&quot;). She was also the first traditional English musician to be nominated for a BBC Radio 3 Award for World Music in the same year (for &quot;Anglicana&quot;).

In 2004, she was part of Oysterband Big Session, a collaboration with numerous folk artists brought together by Oysterband. They produced an album &quot;The Big Session Volume One&quot;, and the group as a whole were awarded Best Group at the Folk Awards in 2005. On 29 May 2005, Carthy took part in a tribute to Peggy Seeger at the Queen Elizabeth Hall, London. A double CD &quot;Three Score and Ten&quot; (2007) contains highlights of the concert.
In 2006, she contributed three songs (one as lead vocalist, two as backing vocalist) to &quot;Rogue&#x27;s Gallery: Pirate Ballads, Sea Songs, and Chanteys&quot;, produced by Hal Willner. Performing as a duo with Richard Thompson, she contributed &quot;The Coo Coo Bird&quot; to a boxed set called &quot;The Harry Smith Project&quot; (2006) also by Hal Willner. As a duo with Bob Neuwirth, she sang &quot;I Wish I Was a Mole in the Ground&quot; by Bascom Lamar Lunsford on the same boxed set.

&quot;Dreams of Breathing Underwater&quot;, Carthy&#x27;s second collection of self penned songs was released on 23 June 2008. Combining traditional instrumentation with experimental arrangements, and drawing influences from all aspects of her career so far, the album was conceived as the follow-up to 2000s &quot;Angels and Cigarettes&quot; and was the making for the best part of seven years.

Carthy&#x27;s 2008 tour was cancelled in November, as a cyst on her throat made singing inconsistent and painful. Because of her pregnancy, doctors delayed treatment until spring 2009.

She became a mother to her son on 24 December 2008, with her Canadian partner Aidan Curran.

The St George&#x27;s Day Celebrations in Trafalgar Square on 25 April 2009 were opened by Carthy who performed two songs.

In 2010, Carthy released an album of collaborations with her mother entitled &quot;Gift&quot;. A BBC reviewer wrote: &quot;The gift in question here, one gathers, is a handing of talent from generation to generation; Norma Waterson and Eliza Carthy are, after all, the sublimely gifted mother and daughter who make up part of British folk’s great dynasty.&quot; Commenting on the final song, &quot;Shallow Brown&quot;, the reviewer noted: &quot;Backed variously by other family members, including Eliza’s father Martin Carthy on guitar as well as her cousin Oliver Knight on electric guitar, vocals and cello, there is a real sense of congregation and rootedness about this song, and indeed this record as a whole. Long may the dynasty flourish.&quot;

Her daughter was born on 26 November 2010.

In May 2012, a biography of Eliza Carthy written by Sophie Parkes and titled &quot;Wayward Daughter&quot; was published by Soundcheck Books.

In 2014, she was awarded the honour of an MBE for services to folk music in the Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours. The same year she also marked the 50th anniversary of Towersey Festival and the 75th anniversary of Topic Records with a celebratory concert at the festival, for which she was Musical Director. Discussing the event with Folk Radio UK she said: &quot;Me and my family have long been associated with Towersey Festival and Topic Records and I have great affection for both. Towersey gave me my first ever solo gig, as Topic gave me my first ever solo record ...&quot;

<doc id="763753" wikidata="Q290679" url="?curid=763753" title="The Seven Year Itch">
<text>The Seven Year Itch is a 1955 American romantic comedy film directed by Billy Wilder, who co-wrote the screenplay with George Axelrod. Based on Axelrod&#x27;s 1952 play of the same name, the film stars Marilyn Monroe and Tom Ewell, with the latter reprising his stage role. It contains one of the most iconic pop culture images of the 20th century, in the form of Monroe standing on a subway grate as her white dress is blown upwards by a passing train. The titular phrase, which refers to waning interest in a monogamous relationship after seven years of marriage, has been used by psychologists.

==Plot==
Richard Sherman is a middle-aged publishing executive in New York City, whose wife Helen and son Ricky are spending the summer in Ogunquit, Maine to escape the city&#x27;s crippling heat. When he returns home from the train station with the kayak paddle Ricky accidentally left behind, he meets an unnamed woman, who is a commercial actress and former model. She has subleased the apartment upstairs while its owners are away for the summer. That evening, he resumes reading the manuscript of a book in which psychiatrist Dr. Brubaker claims that almost all men are driven to have extra-marital affairs in the seventh year of marriage. Sherman has an imaginary conversation with Helen, trying to convince her, in three fantasy sequences, that he is irresistible to women, including his secretary, a nurse, and Helen&#x27;s bridesmaid, but she laughs it off. A potted tomato plant falls onto his lounge chair; the seemingly unclad attractive young woman upstairs apologizes for accidentally knocking it off her balcony, and Richard invites her down for a drink.
While waiting for her to arrive, he vacillates between a fantasy of her as a femme fatale overcome by his playing of Rachmaninoff&#x27;s Second Piano Concerto, and guilt at betraying his wife. When she appears, she is wearing pink pajamas and turns out to be a naïve and innocent young woman who works as a television toothpaste spokeswoman and recently appeared—&quot;highly enticingly&quot;—in a popular photo almanac. After repeatedly viewing her revealing pose his overactive imagination begins to run wild. On his suggestion, she brings back a bottle of champagne from her apartment and returns in a seductive white dress. Richard, overcome by his fantasies, awkwardly grabs at her while they are playing a &quot;Chopsticks&quot; duet on the piano, toppling them off the piano bench. He apologizes, but she says it happens to her all the time. Guilt-ridden, he asks her to leave.

Richard worries that Helen will find out about his transgression the following day at work, even though she is unaware of it and only wants Richard to send Ricky his paddle. Richard&#x27;s waning resolve to resist temptation fuels his fear that he is succumbing to the &quot;Seven Year Itch&quot;. Dr. Brubaker arrives at his office to discuss the book but is of no help. When Richard keeps hearing of his wife spending time with her attractive, hunky writer friend McKenzie in Maine, he imagines they are carrying on an affair; in retaliation, he invites the young woman out to dinner and a film. They go see &quot;Creature from the Black Lagoon&quot; in air-conditioned luxury. As the two chat while walking home, she briefly stands over a subway grate to enjoy its updraft, creating the iconic Monroe scene in her pleated white halterneck dress, her skirt blowing up in the breeze. He then invites her to spend the night at his air-conditioned apartment so she can rest up and look her best for the next day&#x27;s television appearance, with him on the couch and her in his bed.

In the morning, Richard argues with then assaults the man he imagined was having an affair with his wife in Maine. After knocking him cold, he comes to his senses and, fearing his wife&#x27;s retribution (within his dream), tells the woman she can stay in his apartment while he leaves to catch the train for two weeks in Maine.

== Cast ==
== Production ==
&quot;The Seven Year Itch&quot; was filmed between September and November 1954 and is Wilder&#x27;s only film released by 20th Century-Fox. The characters of Elaine (Dolores Rosedale), Marie, and the inner voices of Sherman and The Girl were dropped from the play; the characters of the Plumber, Miss Finch (Carolyn Jones), the Waitress (Doro Merande), and Kruhulik the janitor (Robert Strauss) were added. Many lines and scenes from the play were cut or re-written because they were deemed indecent by the Hays office. Axelrod and Wilder complained that the film was being made under straitjacketed conditions. This led to a major plot change: in the play, Sherman and The Girl have sex; in the movie, the romance is reduced to suggestion; Sherman and the Girl kiss three times, once while playing Sherman&#x27;s piano together, once outside the movie theater and once near the end before Sherman goes to take Ricky&#x27;s paddle to him. The footage of Monroe&#x27;s dress billowing over a subway grate was shot at two locations: first on location outside the Trans-Lux 52nd Street Theater (then located at 586 Lexington Avenue in Manhattan), then on a sound stage. Elements of both eventually made their way into the finished film, despite the often-held belief that the original on-location footage&#x27;s sound had been rendered useless by the overexcited crowd present during filming in New York. The exterior shooting location of Richard&#x27;s apartment was 164 East 61st Street in Manhattan.

Saul Bass created the abstract title sequence, which was mentioned favorably in numerous reviews; up until that time, it was unheard of for trade press reviews to mention film title sequences.

Monroe&#x27;s then-husband, famed baseball player Joe DiMaggio, was on set during the filming of the dress scene, and reportedly angry and disgusted with the attention she received from onlookers, reporters, and photographers in attendance.
Wilder had invited the media to drum up interest in the film.

George Axelrod later expressed his dislike about changes from the play to the film.
The third act of the play was the guy having hilarious guilts about having been to bed with the girl; but as he had not been to bed with her in the picture, all his guilts were for nothing. So the last act of the picture kind of went down hill.

== Analysis ==
&quot;The New York Times&quot; argued that, while the film lacks in clear definition as per its nature, its principal topic is the dynamic between the main male character and the alluring presence of the Girl, who dominates the film. This is in contrast to Axelrod&#x27;s emphasis on the comical anxieties of Ewell&#x27;s character, as the reviewer observed that Monroe&#x27;s performance overshadows Ewell, making her the focal point of attention. The analysis mentioned the potential monotony in Ewell&#x27;s character&#x27;s struggles and commented on the limitations imposed by the Production Code, preventing the fulfillment of his desires, thus rendering his ardor somewhat absurd.

In 2015, &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; author Micah Nathan similarly criticized the moral restrictions imposed by the Hays Code and discussed the central theme of adultery in the context of Monroe&#x27;s captivating presence. According to Nathan, Monroe compensates for the limitations through her magnetic allure and embodiment of certain archetypes. The vivid description of her character&#x27;s entrance into the film, with her figure-hugging dress and seductive mannerisms, is highlighted as a pivotal moment. Monroe&#x27;s on-screen charisma eclipses the remaining aspects of the film, including secondary characters and subplots. The conclusion reflects on the film&#x27;s underlying theme of boredom rather than lust, with Monroe&#x27;s character serving as a catalyst for harmless flirtation and reflection on familial values.

== Release ==
=== Box office ===

A major commercial success, the film earned $6 million in rentals at the North American box office.

=== Critical response ===
The original 1955 review by &quot;Variety&quot; was largely positive. Though Hollywood production codes prohibited writer-director Billy Wilder from filming a comedy where adultery takes place, the review expressed disappointment that Sherman remains chaste. Some critics compared Richard Sherman to the fantasizing lead character in James Thurber&#x27;s short story &quot;The Secret Life of Walter Mitty&quot;.

On the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, 84% of 32 reviews from critics are positive, with an average rating of 7.2/10.

Years later after its release, Wilder called the film &quot;a nothing picture because the picture should be done today without censorship... Unless the husband, left alone in New York while the wife and kid are away for the summer, has an affair with that girl there&#x27;s nothing. But you couldn&#x27;t do that in those days, so I was just straitjacketed. It just didn&#x27;t come off one bit, and there&#x27;s nothing I can say about it except I wish I hadn&#x27;t made it. I wish I had the property now.&quot;

=== Awards and honors ===
In 2000, American Film Institute included the film as No. 51 in AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Laughs. The film was included in &quot;&quot;The New York Times&quot; Guide to the Best 1,000 Movies Ever Made&quot; in 2002.

<doc id="763755" wikidata="Q717696" url="?curid=763755" title="Lim Kit Siang">
<text>Lim Kit Siang (; born 20 February 1941) is a retired Malaysian politician. Having held the position for a total of 29 years on three separate occasions, he is the longest-serving leader of the opposition, as well the second longest-serving member of parliament in Malaysia. He was also the former secretary-general and national chairman of the Democratic Action Party (DAP), a component party of the Pakatan Harapan coalition, leading it through eight general elections.

==Early life and education==
Lim was born on 20 February 1941 at Batu Pahat, Johor, British Malaya. His father was from Qinying Village, while his mother was from Zhangtang Village, both located in Dongshan County, Zhangzhou, Fujian, in China. The youngest of four children, Lim&#x27;s parents gave their eldest daughter to a farmer in Qinying for adoption before immigrating to Malaya and giving birth to Lim. He had one sister and two brothers. Lim visited his ancestral village of Qinying for the first time in November 2008, meeting his brother-in-law.

Lim spent two years studying at a Mandarin-language night school before transferring to Batu Pahat High School, graduating with 5 As in his Cambridge School Certificate of Education examination. Lim was admitted to the English College Johore Bahru to continue his sixth form studies but dropped out after two months to marry his wife, Neo Yok Tee, at the age of 19. The pair had met when they were 15 but their marriage was not approved by Lim&#x27;s parents, who had wanted him to become a doctor, and disowned him.

He gained employment teaching English at the Senai Chinese Primary School before working as a reporter for The Straits Times and Singapore Radio in Singapore, where he would live until 1965. During this time, he became the secretary-general of the Singapore National Union of Journalists at the age of 22 and came into contact with Devan Nair, then head of the National Trades Union Congress.

He pursued a legal education his at London University, earning a Bachelor of Laws (LL.B), and was called to the bar at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn in 1977.

==Political career==
Upon the separation of Singapore from Malaysia in 1965, Devan Nair, who was also the member of parliament for Bungsar in Malaysia, left Singapore to return to the Malaysian capital city of Kuala Lumpur and offered Lim a position as his political secretary, which he accepted. A founding member of Nair&#x27;s new Democratic Action Party, he was made the editor of the party&#x27;s publication; &quot;The Rocket&quot;, He and appointed National Organising Secretary in 1966.

Lim was elected the member of parliament for Bandar Malacca in the 1969 Malaysian general election, which saw substantial gains made by multi-racial opposition parties such as the DAP. The results of the election and subsequent reaction led to the 13 May incident, a racial riot in Kuala Lumpur. Lim was named by the government as a suspected instigator arrested under the Internal Security Act, which allowed for indefinite detainment. Upon hearing the news of his impending arrest, Lim had initially fled to Singapore but returned on 15 May. He was denied access to a lawyer or his family for the first of two months he was held in solitary confinement, and Lim claimed the authorities tried to break him down psychologically. He was only freed on 1 October 1970 after 16 months.

His election as a member of parliament for Bandar Malacca was initially held to be void because of the ineligibility of an election agent who had previously failed to discharge his duties from standing for election in the future. The Prime Minister of Malaysia, Abdul Razak Hussein, moved a motion in Parliament to prevent Lim from serving as an MP, granting him instead a period of time to request a royal pardon from the Yang di-Pertuan Agong (King). After receiving a royal pardon, Lim was allowed to retain his seat.

In 1979, he was convicted of five charges under the Official Secrets Act for exposing an arms deal between the Malaysian government and a Swiss company.

He led the party as secretary-general until 1999 when he was elected party chairman, succeeding Chen Man Hin. In 2004, he refused re-appointment as the chairman and Karpal Singh was elected to replace him. Lim was then elected to an advisory role as the leader of a newly created body called the &quot;Policy and Strategic Planning Commission&quot;. His son, Lim Guan Eng, became secretary-general of the party during this time.

After winning a parliamentary seat from Ipoh Timor during the 2004 general election, which also saw his party clinching the most seats of any opposition party, Lim became the Parliamentary Opposition Leader.

Lim contested and won in the constituency of Gelang Patah against Barisan Nasional heavyweight and former Menteri Besar of Johor Abdul Ghani Othman in the 2013 general election.

On 22 October 2015, Lim was suspended for six months from parliament for insulting the speaker, Pandikar Amin Mulia. Earlier, he had stated that Pandikar was abusing his powers by ruling that the Parliament&#x27;s Public Accounts Committee (PAC) could not continue its ongoing investigation into 1Malaysia Development Berhad scandal (1MDB) due to the transfer of four PAC members to the Cabinet. Pandikar had insisted that Lim apologize and withdraw his statement against him. However, Lim did not apologise or retract his remarks.

Over the course of his parliamentary career, Lim has represented eight federal constituencies.

* Bandar Malacca, Melaka (1969–1974)
* Kota Melaka, Melaka (1974–1978)
* Petaling, Selangor (1978–1982)
* Kota Melaka, Melaka (1982–1986)
* Tanjong, Penang (1986–1999)
* Ipoh Timor, Perak (2004–2013)
* Gelang Patah, Johor (2013-2018)
* Iskandar Puteri, Johor (2018-2022)

Lim has also served as a state assemblyman in Melaka and Penang during the following periods: Kubu, Melaka (1974–1982); Kampong Kolam, Penang (1986–1990); and Padang Kota, Penang (1990–1995).

=== Leader of the opposition ===
Lim was leader of the opposition for 18 months from January 1973 to July 1974, succeeding Asri Muda, and again from November 1975 to November 1999, before being losing his seat in the 1999 general election. He became opposition leader again from March 2004 to March 2008.

=== Retirement ===

<text>The Wynoochee River is a long river located in the Olympic Peninsula in the U.S. state of Washington. A tributary of the Chehalis River, the Wynoochee River rises in the Olympic Mountains within the Olympic National Park and flows generally south. Its drainage basin is in area. The name Wynoochee comes from the Lower Chehalis placename &quot;/xʷənúɬč/&quot;, meaning &quot;shifting&quot;.

The city of Montesano was a recipient of the installation of flood control measures near Montesano&#x27;s wastewater treatment plant which rests near the river. As part of the Chehalis Basin Strategy, log jacks were placed during 2018-2019 that helped increase the riverbank of the migrating river, which was threatening the plant that during flooding would have inundated the community with sewage runoff. The fortification increased the habitat of aquatic species and extended the operating life of the plant by several decades.

<doc id="763759" wikidata="Q6535585" url="?curid=763759" title="Leviathan (comic strip)">
<text>Leviathan is a comic strip by Peter Blegvad, an American musician, singer-songwriter, and cartoonist. Between 1992 and 1999, appeared in the review section of the British newspaper &quot;The Independent on Sunday&quot; during the 1990s.

==Plot==
The title character, whose name is shortened in the strip to Levi, is drawn as a faceless baby who constantly carries a stuffed toy rabbit called either Bunny or Rabbit. A pet cat called Cat is often around to give advice. The strip describes Levi&#x27;s experiences as he crawls around a surreal and often frightening landscape filled with disjointed words and objects, which perhaps reflect the incomprehensible nature of the world as seen by a baby, but which also raise philosophical questions of interest to adults.

<doc id="763767" wikidata="Q173279" url="?curid=763767" title="René Arnoux">
<text>René Alexandre Arnoux (; born 4 July 1948) is a French former racing driver, who competed in Formula One from to . Arnoux won seven Formula One Grands Prix across 12 seasons.

In 1977, Arnoux won the European Formula Two Championship. His best finish in the World Drivers&#x27; Championship was third in 1983 for Ferrari. Arnoux achieved seven wins, 12 fastest laps and 22 podiums in Formula One. His 18 pole positions is the third most for a non-World Champion.

Outside Formula One, he competed in the inaugural season of Grand Prix Masters in 2005.

==Early life and career==
In 1973, Arnoux enrolled in Winfield Racing School and graduated as the top student with the prestigious Volant Shell Competition Schollership, sponsored by Shell Oil for a free Formule Renault season. He moved into Formula Two in 1974 with Elf, taking fourth place on his debut at Nogaro. In 1975, he moved to Formule Super Renault and won the title. For 1976, Arnoux moved back to Formula Two with an Elf-sponsored, works Martini-Renault, winning three races and narrowly losing the title to Jean-Pierre Jabouille. However, he won the European Championship, again driving a Martini-Renault. Arnoux won races at Silverstone, Hockenheim, Pau and Nogaro, which along with second places at Enna-Pergusa and Estoril saw him finish 12 points clear of American Eddie Cheever who was driving for Ron Dennis&#x27; Project Four Racing, and 14 points clear of teammate Didier Pironi.

==Formula One==
===Martini and Surtees===
Arnoux continued with the Martini team when it made the transition to Formula One in . However, in an organisation with insufficient means to compete in the highest echelon of the sport, he was unable to demonstrate his abilities and Martini abandoned Formula One during the season, having run short of money. Arnoux&#x27;s best finishes for Martini were two ninth places in Belgium and Austria. He failed to qualify in South Africa, and failed to pre-qualify in Monaco and Germany.

Arnoux moved to Surtees for the last two races of the season, but once again found himself in a team on the edge of failure. In his two races for the team, his best finish was his debut where he placed ninth at Watkins Glen for the United States Grand Prix. He qualified the Surtees TS20 in 21st place at Watkins Glen, while teammate Beppe Gabbiani failed to qualify. His last race for the team in Canada saw him qualify 16th but retire just after half distance when the Ford DFV engine failed. Surtees wanted to sign Arnoux on a permanent basis, but he secured a seat with Renault for .

===Renault===
In the season, the factory Renault team entered two cars for the first time since its debut in 1977. The team&#x27;s only victory of the year was taken by Arnoux&#x27;s teammate Jean-Pierre Jabouille at the French Grand Prix at the Dijon-Prenois circuit, but Arnoux took the headlines due to a fierce wheel-banging battle with the Flat-12 Ferrari of Gilles Villeneuve for second place, which Villeneuve won. In the second half of the season, Arnoux took four top-six finishes, including three podium places; Jabouille&#x27;s Dijon victory was his only points finish of the year.

In , Arnoux took his first two Formula One victories, the first being at Interlagos circuit in Brazil. His second win came in the very next race at the Kyalami circuit in South Africa, where the thinner air at high altitude gave the turbocharged Renault RE20 a power advantage over its mostly Cosworth-powered rivals. Following this race, Arnoux was leading the World Championship for the first time. He would not lose the championship lead until Round 6 in Monaco. The season though was punctuated by unreliability from the turbocharged Renault V6 engine. The unit was powerful, producing approximately to be on par with Ferrari (and considerably more powerful than the Ford DFV), but fragile, and the Renaults also lacked ground effects. Although he would later finish second in the Dutch Grand Prix at Zandvoort, he would finish the season in 6th place with 29 points, 38 points behind World Champion Alan Jones.
Arnoux&#x27;s situation was complicated in by the arrival of Alain Prost at Renault. Their rivalry on-track flared up off the track and relations between the two men deteriorated. The conflict reached its peak at the 1982 French Grand Prix at the Circuit Paul Ricard. The drivers took Renault&#x27;s first one-two in Formula One, Arnoux finishing ahead of Prost. Prost was furious, considering that his teammate had not kept to the team orders agreed before the race, according to which he should have ceded the win to Prost, who was better placed in the championship. Arnoux replied that no orders had been given before the race and that he was free to drive his own race. He took one other win at the Italian Grand Prix at the end of the season. He suffered a high speed crash after losing a wheel going into the banked Tarzan corner at the end of the long straight in the 1982 Dutch Grand Prix, though his car&#x27;s momentum was largely stopped by a sand trap and tyre barrier.

===Ferrari===
The pairing of Prost and Arnoux having become unsustainable, Arnoux left Renault at the end of 1982 to join Ferrari in , joining another French driver Patrick Tambay. With three victories, at the Canadian, German, and Dutch Grands Prix, Arnoux was in contention for the world title until the final race of the season, the South African Grand Prix. He retired from that race with engine failure, and finished the season third, behind Nelson Piquet and Prost. Both Arnoux and Tambay became favourites with the Tifosi for their hard-charging styles, and their conjuncted results saw Ferrari win the 1983 Constructors&#x27; Championship. Arnoux&#x27;s win at Zandvoort turned out to be the seventh and final win of his Formula One career.

With the McLarens of Prost and Niki Lauda dominating , Arnoux had a less successful second season at Ferrari, only finishing sixth with 27 points, with his new teammate Michele Alboreto progressively taking the initiative and team leadership from him. After three wins and four pole positions in 1983, Arnoux failed to win or claim a pole position in 1984 (Alboreto won the Belgian Grand Prix from pole with Arnoux starting second and finishing third), though he finished second in San Marino and Dallas where he was forced to start from the pits due to an electrical fault on the warm-up lap and managed to keep his car out of trouble on the crumbling track. The only Grand Prix ever held in Dallas was also the last time Arnoux achieved a Formula One podium finish. As the season progressed, Arnoux appeared to lack motivation, and after finishing 4th in the opening race of the championship in Brazil, he left Ferrari by mutual consent. His place in the team was taken by Swedish driver Stefan Johansson. He was seen in the Brabham pits at Imola in Round 3, sparking rumours that he would join the team then owned by Bernie Ecclestone, but nothing came of it and he was rarely seen at races for the rest of the season.

===Ligier===
Without a drive for the rest of the 1985 season, Arnoux made his return to Formula One in for the French Ligier team who were using turbocharged Renault engines. The Pirelli-tyred Ligiers proved uncompetitive as the season progressed. Arnoux had two teammates in 1986. For the first half of the season his teammate was French driver Jacques Laffite. However, Laffite&#x27;s career ended when he broke both of his legs in a first corner crash at Brands Hatch in the British Grand Prix. From the following race Laffite was replaced with another French driver, Philippe Alliot.

For , Ligier were to have exclusive use of a new, four-cylinder turbocharged Alfa Romeo engine in the new Ligier JS29. However, after Arnoux compared the engine to &quot;used food&quot; during pre-season testing, Alfa&#x27;s parent company Fiat pulled the plug on the project and Ligier were forced into using the four-cylinder Megatron engines for the season, which produced around . Arnoux scored the team&#x27;s only point during the season with a 6th place in Belgium. The race at Spa also saw the best finish for his teammate Piercarlo Ghinzani who finished 7th.

 was to prove the final year for turbos in Formula One and Ligier took the chance to race the new, 3.5-litre Judd V8 engine. The Ligier JS31 proved to be uncompetitive, with both Arnoux and new teammate Stefan Johansson failing to qualify several times. Both drivers complained that even in dry conditions the lack of grip saw them forced to drive with a wet weather technique. Arnoux failed to qualify twice during the season (San Marino and France, while Johansson failed to make the grid six times. Arnoux&#x27;s best finish of the year was 10th place in the Portuguese Grand Prix. It was the first time since his debut season in 1978 that he had failed to score a World Championship point. His DNQ at Imola was the first time he had failed to qualify for a race since the 1981 Belgian Grand Prix. In the final race of the season in Adelaide, he took out race leader Gerhard Berger while being lapped at the 1988 Australian Grand Prix. Arnoux was criticised, but Berger said that he was experiencing a &quot;very long&quot; brake pedal which meant he could not stop to avoid Arnoux, nor pass him as easily as he normally would have. He also said that with his turbo boost turned up to full, the Ferrari would have run out of fuel long before the race ended.

In , the new Ford DFR powered Ligier JS33 showed promise. Arnoux&#x27;s driving had attracted some criticism, and he was frequently accused of not using his mirrors and blocking faster cars in qualifying and when being lapped. During the 1989 Monaco Grand Prix, BBC commentator Murray Walker remarked that Arnoux&#x27;s claimed reason for going so slow at that stage of his career was that he was used to turbo powered cars and that the naturally aspirated cars were &quot;a completely different kettle of fish to drive — he says&quot;. Walker&#x27;s co-commentator, World Champion James Hunt said &quot;And all I can say to that is bullshit&quot;. Arnoux received criticism after the race for holding up faster cars, with former Renault teammate Prost in particular held up by the Ligier which refused to let the McLaren past for a number of laps. This cost Prost some 20 seconds in his pursuit of teammate Ayrton Senna.

Arnoux finished his career with 181 World Championship points, with his last points coming from a 5th place at the 1989 Canadian Grand Prix. His last race was the very wet 1989 Australian Grand Prix in Adelaide. He was second fastest to the McLaren-Honda of outgoing World Champion and pole-sitter Ayrton Senna in the extra half-hour warm-up that was scheduled to let drivers and teams set up their cars for wet conditions after three days of sunny weather, but in the race, his Ligier was pushed into retirement by the Arrows of Eddie Cheever after four laps.

==Post-racing career==
After retiring from driving, Arnoux started an indoor karting business, consisting of four tracks in France. He also owns and manages two factories, and frequently appears and drives in historical events on behalf of Renault.

Arnoux was one of the drivers invited to take part in the Grand Prix Masters championship in 2006 and 2007, restricted to former Formula One drivers. In 2007 and 2008 he drove for the Renault H&amp;C Classic Team, when he presented and drove Alain Prost&#x27;s F1 car from 1983 at World Series by Renault events.

<text>Occupational noise is the amount of acoustic energy received by an employee&#x27;s auditory system when they are working in the industry. Occupational noise, or industrial noise, is often a term used in occupational safety and health, as sustained exposure can cause permanent hearing damage.
Occupational noise is considered an occupational hazard traditionally linked to loud industries such as ship-building, mining, railroad work, welding, and construction, but can be present in any workplace where hazardous noise is present.

== Regulation ==
In the US, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) work together to provide standards and regulations for noise in the workplace.

National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA), Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) have all set standards on hazardous occupational noise in their respective industries. Each industry is different, as workers&#x27; tasks and equipment differ, but most regulations agree that noise becomes hazardous when it exceeds 85 decibels, for an 8-hour time exposure (typical work shift). This relationship between allotted noise level and exposure time is known as an exposure action value (EAV) or permissible exposure limit (PEL). The EAV or PEL can be seen as equations which manipulate the allotted exposure time according to the intensity of the industrial noise. This equation works as an inverse, exponential, relationship. As the industrial noise intensity increases, the allotted exposure time, to still remain safe, decreases. Thus, a worker exposed to a noise level of 100 decibels for 15 minutes would be at the same risk level as a worker exposed to 85 decibels for 8 hours. Using this mathematical relationship, an employer can calculate whether or not their employees are being overexposed to noise. When it is suspected that an employee will reach or exceed the PEL, a monitoring program for that employee should be implemented by the employer.

The above calculations of PEL and EAV are based on measurements taken to determine the intensity of that particular industrial noise. A-weighted measurements are commonly used to determine noise levels that can cause harm to the human ear. There are also special exposure meters available that integrate noise over a period of time to give an Leq value (equivalent sound pressure level), defined by standards.

=== Regulations in different countries ===

These numerical values do not fully reflect the real situation. For example, the OSHA standard sets the Action Level 85 dBA, and the PEL 90 dBA. But in practice, the Compliance Safety and Health Officer must record the excess of these values with a margin, in order to take into account the potential measurement error. And, instead of PEL 90 dBA, it turns out 92 dBA, and instead of AL 85 dBA, it&#x27;s 87 dBA.

== Risks of occupational hearing loss ==

Occupational noise, if experienced repeatedly, at high intensity, for an extended period of time, can cause noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) which is then classified as occupational hearing loss. Most often, this is a type of sensorineural hearing loss.

Noise, in the context of industrial noise, is hazardous to a person&#x27;s hearing because of its loud intensity through repeated long-term exposure. In order for noise to cause hearing impairment for the worker, the noise has to be close enough, loud enough, and sustained long enough to damage the hair cells in the auditory system. These factors have been taken into account by the governing occupational health and safety organization to determine the unsafe noise exposure levels and durations for their respective industries.

Noise can also affect the safety of the employee and others. Noise can be a causal factor in work accidents as it may mask hazards and warning signals and impede concentration. High intensity noise interferes with vital workplace communication which increases the chance of accidents and decreases productivity.

Noise may also act synergistically with other hazards to increase the risk of harm to workers. In particular, toxic materials (e.g., some solvents, metals, asphyxiants and pesticides) have some ototoxic properties that may affect hearing function.

Modern thinking in occupational safety and health further identifies noise as hazardous to workers&#x27; safety and health. This hazard is experienced in various places of employment and through a variety of sources.

== Reduction ==

There are several ways to limit exposure to hazardous occupational noise. The hierarchy of controls is a guideline for reducing hazardous noise. Before starting a noise reduction program, base noise levels should first be recorded. After this the company can start to eliminate the noise source. If the noise source cannot be eliminated, the company must try to reduce the noise with alternative methods. This process is called Acoustic quieting.

Acoustic quieting is the process of making machinery quieter by damping vibrations to prevent them from reaching the observer. The company can isolate the certain piece of machinery by placing materials on the machine or in between the machine and the worker to decreases the signal intensity that reaches the worker&#x27;s ear.

If elimination and substitution are not sufficient in reducing the noise exposure, engineering controls should be put in place by the employer. An engineering control usually changes the physical environment of a workplace. For noise reduction, an engineering control might be as simple as putting barriers in-between the noise source and the employee in order to disrupt the transmission path. An engineering control might also involve changing the machine that produces the noise. Ideally, most machines should be made with noise reduction in mind, but this doesn&#x27;t always happen. Changing the machinery involved in an industrial process may not be possible, but is a good way to reduce the noise at its source.

To decrease an employee&#x27;s exposure to hazardous noise, the company can also take administrative control by limiting the employee&#x27;s exposure time. This can be done by changing work shifts and switching employees out from the noise exposure area. An employer might also implement a training program so that employees can learn about the hazards of occupational noise. Other administrative controls might include restricting access to noisy areas as well as placing warning signs around those same areas. 

If all other controls fail to decrease the occupational noise exposure to an acceptable level, hearing protection should be used. There are several types of earplugs that can be used to attenuate the noise to a safe level. Some earplug types include: single-use earplugs, multiple-use ear plugs, and banded ear plugs. Depending on the type of work being done and the needs of the employees, earmuffs might also be a good option. While earmuffs might not have as high of a noise reduction rating (NNR) as earplugs, they can be useful if the noise exposure isn&#x27;t very high, or if an employee cannot wear earplugs. Unfortunately, the ability of HPDs decrease the risk of health damage is close to zero in practice.

== Initiatives ==
Since the hazards of occupational noise exposure were realized, programs and initiatives such as the US Buy Quiet program have been set up to regulate or discourage noise exposure. The Buy Quiet initiative promotes the purchase of quieter tools and equipment and encourages manufacturers to design quieter machines. Additionally, the Safe-In-Sound Award was created to recognize successes in hearing loss prevention programs or initiatives.

<doc id="763782" wikidata="Q1022172" url="?curid=763782" title="List of English words of Persian origin">
<text>This article is concerned with loanwords, that is, words in English that derive from Persian, either directly, or more often, from one or more intermediary languages.

Many words of Persian origin have made their way into the English language through different, often circuitous, routes. Some of them, such as &quot;paradise&quot;, date to cultural contacts between the Persian people and the ancient Greeks or Romans and through Greek and Latin found their way to English. Persian as the second important language of Islam has influenced many languages in the Muslim world such as Arabic and Turkish, and its words have found their way beyond that region.

Iran (Persia) remained largely impenetrable to English-speaking travelers well into the 19th century. Iran was protected from Europe by overland trade routes that passed through territory inhospitable to foreigners, while trade at Iranian ports in the Persian Gulf was in the hands of locals. In contrast, intrepid English traders operated in Mediterranean seaports of the Levant from the 1570s, and some vocabulary describing features of Ottoman culture found their way into the English language. Thus many words in the list below, though originally from Persian, arrived in English through the intermediary of Ottoman Turkish language.

Many Persian words also came into English through Urdu during British colonialism.
Persian was the language of the Mughal court before British rule in India even though locals in North India spoke Hindustani.

Other words of Persian origin found their way into European languages—and eventually reached English at second-hand—through the Moorish-Christian cultural interface in the Iberian peninsula during the Middle Ages thus being transmitted through Arabic.

==A==
;Algorithm: Etymology: The word &quot;algorithm&quot; is derived from the Latin translation, &quot;Algoritmi de numero Indorum&quot;, of the 9th-century Persian mathematician Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi&#x27;s arithmetic treatise “Al-Khwarizmi Concerning the Hindu Art of Reckoning.” More specifically, it is derived from al-Khwarizmi&#x27;s nisba which is attained from the name of his home town, Khwarazm. The Arab geographer Yaqut al-Hamawi in his &quot;Muʿǧam al-buldan&quot; wrote that the name was a Persian compound of &quot;khwar&quot; (خوار), and &quot;razm&quot; (رزم), referring to the abundance of cooked fish as a main diet of the peoples of this area. C.E. Bosworth, however, believed the Persian name to be made up of &quot;xor&quot; (خور &#x27;the sun&#x27;) and &quot;zam&quot; (زم &#x27;earth, land&#x27;), designating &#x27;the land from which the sun rises&#x27;.

<doc id="763785" wikidata="Q326276" url="?curid=763785" title="Wellcome Trust">
<text>The Wellcome Trust is a charitable foundation focused on health research based in London, United Kingdom. It was established in 1936 with legacies from the pharmaceutical magnate Henry Wellcome (founder of Burroughs Wellcome, one of the predecessors of GSK plc) to fund research to improve human and animal health. The aim of the Trust is to &quot;support science to solve the urgent health challenges facing everyone.&quot; It had a financial endowment of £29.1 billion in 2020, making it the fourth wealthiest charitable foundation in the world. In 2012, the Wellcome Trust was described by the &quot;Financial Times&quot; as the United Kingdom&#x27;s largest provider of non-governmental funding for scientific research, and one of the largest providers in the world. According to their annual report, the Wellcome Trust spent GBP £1.1 billion on charitable activities across their 2019/2020 financial year. According to the OECD, the Wellcome Trust&#x27;s financing for 2019 development increased by 22% to US$327 million.

==Headquarters==

The Wellcome Trust&#x27;s operations are run from two buildings on Euston Road in London. The Wellcome Building, at 183 Euston Road, built in 1932 in Portland stone houses the Wellcome Collection and the adjoining glass and steel building at 215 Euston Road is the Gibbs Building, by Hopkins Architects, which opened in 2004 as the administrative headquarters of the Wellcome Trust. In 2019, the Wellcome Trust also opened an office in Berlin.

==History==
The trust was established to administer the fortune of the American-born British pharmaceutical magnate Sir Henry Wellcome. Its income was derived from what was originally called Burroughs Wellcome, later renamed in the UK as the Wellcome Foundation Ltd. In 1986, the trust sold 25% of Wellcome plc stock to the public. Overseen by incoming Director of Finance Ian Macgregor, this marked the beginning of a period of financial growth that saw the trust&#x27;s value increase by almost £14 billion in 14 years, as their interests moved beyond the bounds of the pharmaceutical industry.

In 1995, the trust divested itself of any interest in pharmaceuticals by selling all remaining stock to Glaxo plc, the company&#x27;s historic British rival, creating GlaxoWellcome plc. In 2000, the Wellcome name disappeared from the drug business altogether when GlaxoWellcome merged with SmithKline Beecham, to form GlaxoSmithKline plc.

== Activities ==

=== Biomedical research ===

==== Major investments ====
The Trust funds or co-funds a number of major biomedical research initiatives:
* Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), a cohort study of children born in England during 1991 and 1992.
* The Cancer Genome Project at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute.
* The Diamond Light Source, the UK&#x27;s national synchrotron science facility in Oxfordshire.
* Developing Excellence in Leadership, Training and Science Initiative (DELTAS), a collaboration with the Department for International Development (DFID) to establish cutting-edge research and training programmes across the African continent.
* The Ebola Emergency Initiative, a fast-tracked research programme with the goal of identifying clinical and public health interventions to counter the West African Ebola Epidemic.
* The Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation/ Wellcome Trust Diabetes and Inflammation Laboratory facilitates research into the genetic component of type 1 diabetes and is based in the Cambridge Institute for Medical Research.
* The Seeding Drug Discovery Initiative.
* The Structural Genomics Consortium, an international organisation focussing on three-dimensional structures of proteins of medical relevance with an emphasis on open data.
* The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, a non-profit, British genomics and genetics research institute.
* UK Biobank.

==== Asia and Africa Programmes ====
* The KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Programme, established in 1989 in partnership with the Kenya Medical Research Institute.
* The Malawi-Liverpool-Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Programme, was established in 1995.
* The Africa Centre for Health and Population Studies in South Africa, established in 1998 in partnership with the South African Medical Research Council.
* The Wellcome Trust-Mahidol University-Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Programme in partnership with the Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University, researching in Thailand and Laos and was established in 1979.
* The Vietnam Research Programme and Oxford University Clinical Research Unit in Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi.

====Seeding Drug Discovery Initiative====
Also known as SDDI, this five-year initiative started in October 2005 with the remit &quot;to facilitate the development of drug-like small molecules that address unmet medical needs.&quot; SDDI was based in London and managed by Richard Davis. Through early 2010, SDDI had provided more than £80 million across 30 projects split between academic institutions and companies. To early 2010, all but one of the company recipients were either start-ups or spin-outs. In May 2010, an additional £110 million was added to the SDDI fund with the intent to extend the initiative for an additional five years.

===== Supporting global research and development in COVID-19 =====
The Wellcome Trust announced the need for at least $8 billion of new funding for research, development, and supply of treatments related to COVID-19. Wellcome Trust collaborated with the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation and Mastercard to fund the COVID-19 Therapeutics Accelerator, launching in March 2020 with an initial $125 million in backing.

=== Improving research culture ===
In September 2019, Wellcome launched an initiative to reimagine research and improve the culture in which research is conducted. Current incentive structures and, as a result, culture and practices, prioritise publication outputs above all else. This is damaging people&#x27;s wellbeing and undermining the quality of research itself.

=== Support for Open Access and Open Data ===
The Wellcome Trust plays an important role in encouraging publication of research in open access repositories such as Europe PubMed Central (EuropePMC). The Wellcome Trust believes that maximising the distribution of these papers – by providing free, online access – is the most effective way of ensuring that the research can be accessed, read and built upon. In turn, this will foster a richer research culture.

In 2016, the Wellcome Trust partnered with the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute to launch the Open Science Prize to &quot;help develop services, tools and platforms that enable open content to be discovered, assessed and re-used in ways that will advance discovery and spark innovation.&quot;

In 2016, Wellcome Trust announced that it would be launching Wellcome Open Research, an open access publication system running on the F1000 Research platform. Article processing charges will be covered directly by Wellcome Trust. Papers from the system are now indexed in PubMed Central.

===Membership in the Global Health Innovative Technology Fund (GHIT)===
In the summer of 2015, the Wellcome Trust joined the Japanese government, 7 Japanese pharmaceutical and diagnostics companies, The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and the United Nations Development Program as funding partner of the Global Health Innovative Technology Fund (GHIT), which funds scientific research and development for anti-infectives and diagnostics for diseases that primarily affect the developing world.

=== Public engagement and the Wellcome Collection ===
In June 2007, the Wellcome Building reopened after refurbishment as a public venue, housing the Wellcome Collection, the Wellcome Trust Centre for the History of Medicine at University College London and the Wellcome Library. The aim of the Wellcome Collection is to enhance public understanding of medical science and history. The building contains gallery spaces, conference facilities, space for debates, drama and workshops, a café and a bookshop. The galleries show a small sample of works from Sir Henry Wellcome&#x27;s collection, and host a programme of events and exhibitions. The Wellcome Collection and exhibitions are open to the public free of charge six days a week.

The Wellcome Collection and Wellcome Library are members of The London Museums of Health &amp; Medicine.

==== Wellcome Photography Prize ====
The Wellcome Trust runs an annual photography prize which aims to explore &quot;the human side of three urgent health challenges&quot;. Judges in 2021 include Dr Dixon Chabanda, Sir Jeremy Farrar, Dr Katerina Srahulkova and Azu Nwagbogu. Winners in each category receive a prize of £10,000.

==== Wellcome Book Prize ====

The Wellcome Trust sponsors an annual book prize, the Wellcome Book Prize, which &quot;aims to excite public interest and encourage debate&quot; around medicine and health.

=== Wellcome Global Monitor ===
In June 2019, Wellcome released the results of the 2018 global survey on public attitudes toward science and health. Topics include trust of scientists, doctors, and nurses; religion and science, and vaccines, among others. It was Wellcome&#x27;s first Global Monitor and was intended to &quot;provide robust evidence on how public attitudes vary across different demographic groups and countries.&quot;

== Investments ==
In August 2014, the Wellcome Trust bought the Co-operative Group&#x27;s farm business (renamed Farmcare) for £249 million. This comprised &quot;15,997 hectares (39,533 acres) of freehold and third party owned land, 15 farms, including three pack houses, over 100 residential properties, and 27 commercial properties.&quot;

In 2015, the trust bought the Premier Marinas group.

== Criticisms ==
It has been reported that the Wellcome Trust has billions of investments in companies related to the problems the philanthropy wants to solve. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the trust has investments in pharmaceutical companies involved in the development and delivery of treatments for COVID-19, which means it has the potential to gain financially where those treatments are monetised.

== Directors ==

<doc id="763788" wikidata="Q91605" url="?curid=763788" title="Abraham Abramson">
<text>Abraham Abramson (1752 or 1754 – 28 July 1811) was a Prussian coiner and medallist. Born into a Jewish family, he later converted to Protestantism.

==Life==
Son of the coiner Jacob Abraham, like him Abramson belonged to the court of Frederick the Great, and he also was the first Jew to be admitted into the Prussian Academy of Arts.

Abramson was a prolific medalist. He depicted among others Immanuel Kant, Gotthold Ephraim Lessing, Moses Mendelssohn, Christoph Martin Wieland, Johann Georg Sulzer and Leonhard Euler.

==Bullion Suppliers to the Berlin Mint==
The Hohenzollern Elector of Brandenberg, Frederick William (1620–88) appointed Israel Aaron as bullion supplier to the Berlin mint and granted the right of striking small coins to Esther Liebmann, wife first of Israel Aaron and then, after Aaron&#x27;s death to the Court jeweller, Jost Liebmann.

As Hohenzollern King of Prussia, Frederick William I (1688–1740) reluctantly appointed Jewish mint suppliers after Christian officials had failed. Levin Veit was succeeded in this function by the Gompertz brothers, the tobacco manufacturers. Frederick the Great (1740–86) shared his father&#x27;s prejudices but found it necessary to lease the state mint to the Jews. In 1751 the Gompertz brothers joined with the banker Daniel Itzig and his brother-in-law Moses Isaak to lease the six state mints. In 1755 they beat competition from the Fraenkel brothers to retain this concession. In 1758 these factions merged and shared the ignominy of the anti-Semitism provoked by Frederick&#x27;s devaluation in order to finance his many wars, although this expedient may have saved the Prussian state.

In the design of medals the celebration of personalities and events was the province of the individual artist or craftsman. However, Frederick the Great imposed restrictions on creativity and the Swiss Hedlinger and his pupil Georgi resigned. The supply of bullion to the Prussian mint at Berlin by Jews since the early 17th century would now pave the way for a highly skilled medallic craftsman and contemporary of Meyer Rothschild.

==Jacob Abraham and Abraham Abramson==
Jacob Abraham (1723–1800) originated in the German duchy of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. He first cut precious gems at the age of thirteen in Polish Lissa. On the death of his father in 1731 the family moved to Sverin and then to Mecklenburg. In 1750 he married Beilchen, daughter of a teacher. His talents were recognised by Frederick the Great who confirmed his appointment at the Berlin mint as a die cutter in 1752 after a two-year apprenticeship. The following year, at the age of 31, he was transferred to Stettin as Royal Medalist to inaugurate a new mint. He also engraved small coins and Polish money before moving to Königsberg in 1755. Abraham fled before the Russian advance in the Seven Years&#x27; War (1756–63) to Danzig in 1758, Dresden in 1759 and Berlin in 1761 where he cut a new Prussian eagle for the thaler and struck medals in honour of Frederick&#x27;s military successes. In his biography Hoffmann describes Abraham as astute, intelligent and industrious; more of a craftsman than an artist. He worked at both the Neue Muntze and Berlin Altmuntze. In the last twenty years of his life his powers declined and much of his work was done collaboratively with his son Abraham Abramson. Forrer catalogued the better known works. Of note is the famous medal of Moses Mendelssohn where the portraiture is the work of the son. In the English series the marriage medal of George III is noteworthy. On his death in 1800, he was, most unusually, granted full civil rights, and laid to rest at the Hamburg Street Cemetery, Berlin (row 28, stone 19!) with many tributes.

Abramson (1754–1811) was the most successful of Abraham&#x27;s three artistic sons. The male children, Abraham, Hirsch and Michel inherited full civil rights, but these were not available to female offspring, Roschen and Yachet. The descendants of Roschen could still be traced in Berlin in Hoffmann&#x27;s time. Abraham officially became his father&#x27;s assistant at the Berlin mint at the age of seventeen. He was appointed Royal Medalist in 1782 after a long apprenticeship and travelled extensively from 1787 to 1791 learning design and modelling techniques, mainly in Italy. He is considered the outstanding medalist of this remarkable period. His output was enormous amounting to over 250 medals. He was fortunate to be at the height of his powers at such a time of artistic, scientific and technological advance, military struggle, political and social reform. His best known medal in the English series is that commemorating the death of Nelson in 1805. Again Forrer lists many of the more outstanding works and Hoffmann gives a remarkably comprehensive catalogue of father and son. Abramson died from overwork at the age of 57.

==Works==
*In the royal court, Abraham Abramson coined two medals, for the marriage in Berlin of Sophie Dorothea of Württemberg and Paul I of Russia, for which the celebrations reportedly were of the most splendid of those years.

<text>In advertising and marketing, foreign branding is the use of foreign or foreign-sounding brand names for companies, goods, and services to imply they are of foreign origin, generally to make them appear to come from a place that seems attractively fitting, or at least exotic. It may also be done if the country of origin has a poor image, in order to make customers believe that a company and/or its products originate from a country seen more favourably.

In non-English-speaking countries, many brands use English- or American-styled names to suggest foreign origin. In non-French- and non-Italian-speaking countries, many cosmetics, toiletry, and apparel brands use French- or Italian-styled names. Names suggesting Japanese, Scandinavian, German, and other origins are similarly used for effect outside their home countries.

==English-speaking countries==
* Au Bon Pain, a bakery cafe with a French name, was founded in Boston. The company was originally owned by a French company but sold later and never operated in France
* Berghaus, a British outdoor equipment company, converted the name of its first premises (LD Mountain Centre) roughly into German to market its own products.
* Caffè Nero is a British-based chain of coffeehouses with Italian branding.
* Dolmio and Kan-Tong sauces have an Italian-sounding name and an Asian-sounding name, respectively, but are both made by Masterfoods in Australia.
* Frusen Glädjé, an ice cream with the misspelt Swedish words for &quot;frozen delight&quot;, was created in the U.S. by Richard E. Smith and later bought by Kraft Foods.
* Ginsu knives have a Japanese-sounding name (&quot;Ginsu&quot;, Kanji: 銀簾; Hiragana: ぎんす), but are made in America by Douglas Quikut.
* Giordano is a Hong Kong-based clothing brand, despite the name sounding Italian.
* Häagen-Dazs ice cream, intended to have a Danish-sounding name, was established by Jewish-Polish immigrants Reuben and Rose Mattus in the Bronx, New York.
* Matsui was the Japanese-sounding brand of the electrical retailer Dixons.
* Möben was the trademark of the English company Moben Kitchens, implying the perceived higher quality of German and Scandinavian kitchens.
* Outback Steakhouse is an American casual dining restaurant chain with an Australian theme.
* Pret a Manger sandwich retail chain is British but its name is French for &quot;ready to eat&quot; (properly spelt &quot;prêt à manger&quot;).
* Røde Microphones is spelt with an &quot;ø&quot; in middle which gives the impression that the company is Danish or Norwegian, when in fact it is Australian.
* Rykä shoes are given a Finnish-looking name, despite being an American company.
* Superdry is a British clothing company that presents itself as being Japanese via the use of grammatically incorrect Japanese language text and Japanese style foreign branding (in Japan &#x27;Super Dry&#x27; is a brand of beer: Asahi Super Dry.)
* Texas de Brazil is an American steakhouse chain founded by a Lebanese immigrant, using a misspelt Portuguese name to portray itself as a Brazilian steakhouse.
* Vasque is a European-sounding brand from Red Wing Shoes, an American company.
* Vichyssoise, a cold potato and leek soup, was recreated at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in New York in the 1910s, but it was given a French name. Its purported inventor, Louis Diat, was, however, a Frenchman who grew up in Vichy (whence the name), and his creation was based on much older French recipes that he recalled from his childhood.

==In non-English-speaking countries==
* Australian Homemade is a Belgian maker of ice cream and candies.
* California Fried Chicken is an Indonesian fast food restaurant chain, principally serving fried chicken.
* Havaianas are Brazilian flip-flops named for the American state of Hawaii.
* HokBen, formerly Hoka Hoka Bento, is an Indonesian fast food restaurant chain, principally served in Japanese style.
* KAIKO was a trademark of the German studio A.U.D.I.O.S., designed as a branding for selling their Japanese-inspired and styled games &quot;Apidya&quot;, &quot;Gem&#x27;X&quot; and &quot;Super Gem&#x27;Z&quot;.
* Lakmé is an Indian cosmetics brand named after the French opera of the same name.
* Miniso, a Chinese discount store, markets itself as Japanese, using Japanese wording on packaging and formerly a logo in Japanese katakana.
* Napapijri, an Italian clothing manufacturer with Finnish and Norwegian-themed branding.
* New Yorker, a German clothing retailer and name sponsor of the New Yorker Lions.
* Fashion accessories company Parfois (a French word meaning &quot;sometimes&quot;) is in fact Portuguese.
* Pull&amp;Bear is a Spanish clothing brand that markets California youth culture. 12 of 864 stores are in Anglophone countries.
* Roland is a Japanese manufacturer of electronic music equipment with the name being chosen with the global market in mind. It is, however, difficult to pronounce for Japanese speakers, for whom it is hard to differentiate &quot;l&quot; and &quot;r&quot; sounds.
* Tous les Jours is a South Korean bakery franchise owned by CJ Foodville, a business group of CJ Group. Tous les Jours means &#x27;every day&#x27; in French.
* A number of Polish sparkling fruit wines are branded in a way alluding to Russia or Soviet Union despite being produced in Poland. The practice stems from Soviet-imported sparkling wines popular in times of the communist rule.

==Foreign orthography==
Foreign letters and diacritical marks (such as the &quot;umlaut&quot;) are often used to give brand names foreign flavor. The heavy metal umlaut is used by a number of rock bands, usually to impart a generally Germanic and Gothic overtone to the band&#x27;s name. Examples include Mötley Crüe, Motörhead, Queensrÿche, and Blue Öyster Cult.

Some fonts, sometimes called simulation typefaces, have also been designed that represent the characters of the Roman alphabet but evoke another writing system. This group includes typefaces designed to appear as Arabic, Chinese characters, Cyrillic, Indic scripts, Greek, Hebrew, Kana, or Thai. These are used largely for the purpose of novelty to make something appear foreign, or to make businesses such as restaurants offering foreign food clearly stand out.

===Characters chosen for visual resemblance===
====Greek characters in Latin contexts====
* The Greek sigma, Σ, is often used for Latin E, although it is the equivalent of Latin S. Examples include the film &quot;My Big Fat Greek Wedding&quot; (stylized as My Big Fat GRΣΣK Wedding), ABC Family&#x27;s college-set series &quot;Greek (TV series) (stylized as GRΣΣK)&quot;, and the slogan WΣ ARΣ HAPPY TO SΣRVΣ YOU on the Anthora coffee cup. Papers Please also uses Sigma to represent E, even though the game takes place in a place based on Russia.
* The lower-case Greek lambda, λ, was used for Latin A in the video game &quot;Hλlf-Life&quot;, apparently in reference to the use of λ as the symbol for the decay constant (related to the concept of half-life), and unlike most uses of foreign branding, not at all representing Greece or its culture.
* Omega is sometimes used as a replacement for O, like in the God of War franchise. 
* Lowercase letter &quot;u&quot; is often substituted for &quot;μ&quot; when the Greek character is not typographically available; for example the unit &quot;microfarad&quot;, correctly &quot;μF&quot;, is often rendered as &quot;uF&quot; or &quot;ufarad&quot; in technical documents.

====Cyrillic characters in Latin contexts====

* Cyrillic Ya, Я, and I, И, resemble the reversed Latin letters R and N, respectively, and are often used as such. Examples include the video game TETЯIS.
* Cyrillic De, Д, is sometimes used in place of the Latin A, as in the film BORДT.

====Other scripts====

* The London-based sushi restaurant YO! Sushi uses a typeface that makes the Y and O look like the Japanese katakana letters リ and ク (romaji: &quot;ri&quot; and &quot;ku&quot;).
* Letters of the Hebrew alphabet can be used to evoke Jewish culture in Faux Hebrew fonts.
* The television series &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; and &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot; use a glyph resembling the greek letter Λ with an overring in place of the letter A in marketing materials, thus &quot;STARGΛ̊TE SG-1&quot; and &quot;STARGATE ATLΛ̊NTIS&quot;, respectively. This usage derives from the symbol representing Earth on the titular Stargate, and is unrelated to the letter Å used in the Swedish, Danish, and Norwegian alphabets (which is pronounced similar to English &quot;o&quot;).

===Diacritics and foreign spellings===
* The name of the French soft drink Pschitt is merely an onomatopoeic rendition of the sound made when the bottle is opened, but the &quot;-sch-&quot; and terminal &quot;-tt&quot; are German, rather than French, clusters.
* A premium-priced ice cream made by a company based in Bronx, New York was dubbed Häagen-Dazs to imply &quot;old world craftsmanship and tradition&quot;. Häagen-Dazs has no meaning in any European language, although it contains several conventions used in European languages, such as the umlaut, and resembles a mixture of German and Hungarian. Häagen-Dazs spawned imitators, such as Frusen Glädjé (&quot;frusen glädje&quot; without the acute accent meaning &quot;frozen joy&quot; in Swedish), another brand of premium ice cream. Häagen Dazs sued unsuccessfully in 1980 to stop them from using a &quot;Scandinavian marketing theme&quot;, despite that the name Häagen-Dazs does not even remotely resemble anything Scandinavian itself. 
* Le Tigre Clothing, an American brand which adopted a French name, has at times used an accent over the final &quot;e&quot; in &quot;tigre&quot; (French for tiger), although the French word itself contains no accent. In fact, with an accent (&quot;tigré&quot;) the word becomes an adjective meaning striped like the coat of a tiger.
* The fashion for the metal umlaut (use of umlauts in the names of heavy metal bands) can also be seen as a form of foreign branding.
* &quot;Ye olde&quot; is often used to represent the Old English language, due to the lack of the letter thorn on the typewriters.

===Characters chosen by keyboard or encoding match===
Where different keyboard layouts or character encodings map different scripts to the same key positions or code points, directly converting matching characters provides an alternative to transliteration when the appearance, rather than the meaning, is desired.
* The cover of Madonna&#x27;s &quot;Greatest Hits Volume 2&quot; contains the Japanese characters モヂジラミミヂ. These characters share the same keys on a dual-layout Japanese/English keyboard as the letters M-A-D-O-N-N-A. The characters are otherwise unrelated and the resulting Japanese text (&quot;mo-dji-ji-ra-mi-mi-dji&quot;) is meaningless.

<text>Russell Irving Tamblyn (born December 30, 1934), also known as Rusty Tamblyn, is an American film and television actor and dancer.

Born and raised in Los Angeles, Tamblyn trained as a gymnast in his youth. He began his career as a child actor for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Tamblyn appeared in the musical &quot;Seven Brides for Seven Brothers&quot; (1954). He subsequently portrayed Norman Page in the drama &quot;Peyton Place&quot; (1957), for which he earned an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. In &quot;West Side Story&quot; (1961), he portrayed Riff, the leader of the Jets gang.

Throughout the 1970s, Tamblyn appeared in several exploitation films and worked as a choreographer in the 1980s. In 1990, he starred as Dr. Lawrence Jacoby in David Lynch&#x27;s television drama &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;, reprising the role during its 2017 revival.

==Early life==
Tamblyn was born December 30, 1934, in Los Angeles, California, to actors Sally Aileen (Triplett) and Edward Francis &quot;Eddie&quot; Tamblyn. His younger brother, Larry Tamblyn, was the organist for the 1960s band the Standells. 

Tamblyn was a hyperactive child with a penchant for gymnastics and performing. He took the stage during intermissions at the local movie theater and gave tumbling performances. When he was 13, Tamblyn lived in North Hollywood, studied dramatics under Grace Bowman and dancing at the North Hollywood Academy, owned and operated by his parents.

==Career==
===1948–1952: Child acting===
Tamblyn wanted to be a circus performer and was skilled in acrobatics and dancing as a child. He developed a musical act that involved singing, dancing, juggling and comedy.

Tamblyn&#x27;s first professional job came when he was ten years old and was cast by actor Lloyd Bridges in a play Bridges was directing called &quot;The Stone Jungle&quot; alongside Dickie Moore. During the play&#x27;s run Tamblyn was seen by several talent scouts and an agent, who signed him. The agent arranged for Tamblyn to audition for a role in &quot;The Boy With Green Hair&quot; (1948), and he was given a small part.

He appeared as young Saul in Cecil B. DeMille&#x27;s 1949 version of &quot;Samson and Delilah&quot;. &quot;That was a big break for me&quot;, he later said. &quot;After that I worked a lot.&quot;

Tamblyn appeared in &quot;Reign of Terror&quot;, then was given a role in &quot;The Kid from Cleveland&quot; (1949), billed third (as &quot;Rusty Tamblyn&quot;) after stars George Brent and Lynn Bari, and in &quot;What Happened to Jo Jo?&quot; (1950).

Tamblyn played the younger Bart Tare (played as an adult by John Dall) in the film noir &quot;Gun Crazy&quot; (1950) and Elizabeth Taylor&#x27;s younger brother in &quot;Father of the Bride&quot; (also 1950) and its sequel, &quot;Father&#x27;s Little Dividend&quot; (1951) at MGM. He appeared in &quot;Captain Carey, U.S.A.&quot; (1950), &quot;The Gangster We Made&quot; (1950), &quot;As Young as You Feel&quot; (1951), &quot;Cave of Outlaws&quot; (1951), &quot;Retreat, Hell!&quot; (1952), and &quot;The Winning Team&quot; (1952).

===1953–1962: MGM and leading roles===

MGM was impressed by Tamblyn&#x27;s performance in &quot;Retreat, Hell!&quot; and signed him to a long-term contract. He called this &quot;the second big break&quot; of his career.

His first role under the contract was as a young soldier in boot camp in &quot;Take the High Ground!&quot; (1953), directed by Richard Brooks. His training as a gymnast in high school, and abilities as an acrobat, prepared him for his breakout role as Gideon, the youngest brother, in &quot;Seven Brides for Seven Brothers&quot; (1954). Tamblyn says the director wanted to cast a Broadway dancer but MGM insisted the filmmakers use some contract talent, leading to him and Jeff Richards being used.

Tamblyn was not a trained dancer and always considered himself an actor who danced rather than the other way around, but the film was a big success and established him at MGM. He said &quot;my career really took off&quot; after the film.

Tamblyn was one of many studio contract players in the musical &quot;Deep in My Heart&quot; (1954). He played Eleanor Parker&#x27;s brother in the Western &quot;Many Rivers to Cross&quot; (1955), and was one of several young MGM actors (others included Jane Powell and Debbie Reynolds) in the musical &quot;Hit the Deck&quot; (1955).
Tamblyn supported older actors in two Westerns: Robert Taylor and Stewart Granger in &quot;The Last Hunt&quot; (1956), a flop; and Glenn Ford and Broderick Crawford in &quot;The Fastest Gun Alive&quot; (1956), a big hit, where he performed an extraordinary &quot;shovel&quot; dance at a hoe-down early in the film. He served (uncredited) as a choreographer for Elvis Presley in 1957&#x27;s &quot;Jailhouse Rock&quot;. MGM loaned Tamblyn to Allied Artists for his first star role, &quot;The Young Guns&quot; (1957). Back at MGM he supported Glenn Ford and Gia Scala in &quot;Don&#x27;t Go Near the Water&quot; (1957), a comedy set among members of the U.S. Navy.

20th Century Fox borrowed Tamblyn to play Norman Page in &quot;Peyton Place&quot; (1957), opposite Lana Turner and Diane Varsi. For his performance he received an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. Immediately after filming that, Tamblyn went to England to play the title role in the musical &quot;Tom Thumb&quot; (1958), made for George Pal. When he returned, MGM immediately cast him as the lead in &quot;High School Confidential&quot; (1958), which was a solid hit.

Tamblyn&#x27;s career momentum was interrupted when he was drafted into the United States Army in 1958. During his service he was given leave to play a prominent supporting part in &quot;Cimarron&quot; (1960). 

Tamblyn&#x27;s best-known musical role came as Riff, the leader of the Jets street gang in &quot;West Side Story&quot; (1961). He then appeared in two MGM Cinerama movies, &quot;The Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm&quot;, again for Pal, and &quot;How the West Was Won&quot; (both 1962). 

Tamblyn played Luke Sannerson in &quot;The Haunting&quot; for Robert Wise, who had made &quot;West Side Story&quot;. Tamblyn said he originally turned down the role as he disliked the part but agreed to do it when MGM threatened to put him on suspension. He then played &quot;Smitty&quot; Smith in MGM&#x27;s &quot;Follow the Boys&quot; (both 1963).

===1963–1976: Television and independent films===
Tamblyn was unable to consolidate his position as a leading man, and later said he &quot;dropped out&quot; after his &quot;West Side Story&quot; success and devoted himself to art, refusing movie roles, as well as the role of Gilligan in the TV series &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot;. 

In the 1960s he appeared in the TV series &quot;The Greatest Show on Earth&quot; (&quot;Silent Love, Secret Love&quot;; 1963), and &quot;Channing&quot; (&quot;The Last Testament of Buddy Crown&quot;; 1963). Tamblyn played a Viking alongside Richard Widmark and Sidney Poitier in &quot;The Long Ships&quot; (1965). Also in 1965 he appeared in &quot;Burke&#x27;s Law&quot; (&quot;Who Killed Rosie Sunset?&quot;) and &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;.

Tamblyn had the starring role in the low-budget MGM Western &quot;Son of a Gunfighter&quot; (1965) and starred in the 1966 Japanese kaiju film &quot;War of the Gargantuas&quot;. He guest starred on &quot;Tarzan&quot; (&quot;Leopard on the Loose&quot;, 1966), and &quot;Iron Horse&quot; (&quot;Decision at Sundown&quot;, 1967). Tamblyn later said he became &quot;bored&quot; with acting around this time and more interested in art.

Tamblyn starred in the notorious biker movie &quot;Satan&#x27;s Sadists&quot; (1969) for Al Adamson. He followed it with &quot;Scream Free!&quot; (1969), &quot;The Last Movie&quot; (1971), &quot;The Female Bunch&quot; (1971), and &quot;Dracula vs. Frankenstein&quot; (1971) for Adamson.

He appeared on TV in &quot;Cade&#x27;s County&quot; (&quot;Ragged Edge&quot;, 1972), &quot;Win, Place or Steal&quot; (1973), &quot;The World Through the Eyes of Children&quot; (1975), &quot;The Quest&quot; (&quot;The Captive&quot;, 1976), &quot;The Life and Times of Grizzly Adams&quot; (&quot;The Skyrider&quot;, 1978), and &quot;Nero Wolfe&quot; (&quot;Before I Die&quot;, 1981). He was also in &quot;Black Heat&quot; (1976).

At the same time he worked in exploitation, Tamblyn also worked in the construction industry and computer software.

===1978–1989: Choreography and film===
Tamblyn played the supporting role in Neil Young&#x27;s 1982 &quot;Human Highway&quot; while also credited for screenplay and choreography. Tamblyn is credited as director, choreographer and actor for Young&#x27;s &quot;Greendale&quot; concert tour. He choreographed a play, &quot;Man with Bags&quot;, in 1983.

Tamblyn appeared in the TV series &quot;Fame&quot;, &quot;Commando Squad&quot; (1987) for Fred Olen Ray, &quot;The Phantom Empire&quot; (1988), &quot;Necromancer&quot; (1988), &quot;B.O.R.N.&quot; (1988), &quot;The Bloody Monks&quot; (1988), and an episode of &quot;Quantum Leap&quot;. He was in &quot;Aftershock&quot; (1990) and &quot;Wizards of the Demon Sword&quot; (1991) for Fred Olen Ray.

===1990–2004: &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; and other work===

In 1990–91, Tamblyn starred as Dr. Lawrence Jacoby on the David Lynch-created series &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; (alongside his &quot;West Side Story&quot; co-star Richard Beymer, who played Ben Horne); his scenes in the 1992 prequel film &quot;Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me&quot; were cut.

He appeared in &quot;Running Mates&quot; (1992), &quot;Little Devils: The Birth&quot; (1993), &quot;Cabin Boy&quot; (1994), &quot;Desert Steel&quot; (1995), and &quot;Babylon 5&quot;. He appeared on stage in Los Angeles in &quot;Zastrozzi&quot;. His work drifted back to straight to video: &quot;Starstruck&quot; (1995), &quot;Rebellious&quot; (1995), &quot;Attack of the 60 Foot Centerfold&quot; (1995) and &quot;Invisible Mom&quot; (1996) for Fred Olen Ray, &quot;Johnny Mysto: Boy Wizard&quot; (1997), &quot;My Ghost Dog&quot; (1997), and &quot;Little Miss Magic&quot; (1998) for Ray.

Tamblyn appeared on another soap opera, &quot;General Hospital&quot;, alongside his daughter Amber in 1997 and 2000. In 2004, he appeared with Amber again, playing God in the form of a man walking dogs, in three episodes of &quot;Joan of Arcadia&quot;. The two also worked together in the films &quot;Rebellious&quot;, &quot;Johnny Mysto: Boy Wizard&quot;, and &quot;The Increasingly Poor Decisions of Todd Margaret&quot;. In Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s film &quot;Django Unchained&quot;, they were billed respectively as &quot;Son of a Gunfighter&quot; and &quot;Daughter of a Son of a Gunfighter&quot;, alluding to his leading role in the 1965 western &quot;Son of a Gunfighter&quot;.

In 2004, the Academy Film Archive preserved the mid-1960s works &quot;First Film&quot; and &quot;Rio Reel&quot; by Tamblyn.

===2005–present: Later roles===

Tamblyn had supporting roles in &quot;Drive&quot; (2011), &quot;Django Unchained&quot; (2012), and &quot;Hits&quot; (2014). He appeared several times in &quot;The Increasingly Poor Decisions of Todd Margaret&quot;, and in the revival of &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; (2017).

==Personal life==
Tamblyn married actress Venetia Stevenson in 1956, but they divorced the next year. In 1960 he married Elizabeth Kempton, a showgirl, in Las Vegas. In later years, Tamblyn discovered he had a daughter from a 1960s relationship with artist and spiritual practitioner Elizabeth Anne Vigil. That daughter, China Faye Tamblyn, is an artist and heavy metal welder who lives in California. Tamblyn did not meet her until she was a teenager and only after the birth of his second child, actress and author Amber Tamblyn, who was born in 1983 to his third wife, Bonnie Murray.

In 2012, it was announced that Tamblyn was working on an autobiography, &quot;Dancing On The Edge&quot;. The book was released in 2024.

Tamblyn underwent open heart surgery in October 2014. There were complications afterward and during his rehabilitation, but his health had reportedly improved by February 2015.

<text>Stagira (, also: Στάγιρα - &quot;Stagira&quot;) is a Greek village lying on a plateau on the Chalcidice peninsula, at the foot of the Argirolofos hill. The village stands approximately 18 kilometers southwest of the ruins of ancient Stageira, the birthplace of Aristotle. 

A modern statue of Aristotle and small theme park is located next to the modern town. It is part of the municipal unit Stagira-Akanthos within the municipality Aristotelis.

==History==
The village of Stagira was built 18 km from the archaeological site of Stagira. In Byzantine times, Stagira was called &quot;Siderokafsia&quot; (which means blast furnace). The sultan&#x27;s mint was located there in the 16th century and many ruins of furnaces can be found close to the village. The historical central church of Stagira was built in 1814, a few years before the Greek War of Independence.

==Population==
The present-day village has approximately 400 inhabitants but including the neighboring village of Stratoniki, with which Stagira virtually merges, the population increases to around 1500.

<doc id="763806" wikidata="Q4743594" url="?curid=763806" title="American Democracy Project (Florida group)">
<text>American Democracy Project is a 527 group. it was headed by Bernie Friedman and based in Broward County, Florida.

ADP was founded during the 2004 Senate election &quot;to investigate the reasons that the University of South Florida became known as &#x27;Jihad University&#x27; in the 1990s during the tenure of then-USF President Betty Castor,&quot; then a candidate for the Democratic nomination. Its investigations have centered on Castor&#x27;s response to USF professors Sami Al-Arian and Ramadan Abdullah Shallah in the mid-1990s. Al-Arian later pleaded guilty to conspiracy to contribute services to or for the benefit of the Palestine Islamic Jihad, a Specially Designated Terrorist organization, and was sentenced to 57 months in prison.

Friedman, a long-time friend of Castor&#x27;s rival for the Democratic nomination, U.S. Rep. Peter Deutsch, has been accused of using the ADP as a &quot;front group&quot; to stage attacks on Castor on behalf of the Deutsch campaign. Deutsch has denied this accusation.

ADP launched a website in July, castortruth.com, outlining several documents and details that were uncovered after ADP filed their request for documents in Betty Castor&#x27;s possession.

On the same day, Castor&#x27;s campaign launched a second website, castorfacts.com, containing documents supporting Castor&#x27;s claim that she did everything possible to deal appropriately with Al-Arian, while simultaneously debunking Friedman and one of castortruth.com&#x27;s contributors, John Loftus. Also, castorfacts.com pointed out that Al-Arian had a relationship with George W. Bush during the 2000 presidential campaign, and for some time leading up to the September 11, 2001 attacks: the point was to &quot;show that Republicans can&#x27;t exploit this issue&quot; in the general election.

==Controversy over ADP&#x27;s tactics==

===Whether ADP was connected to the Deutsch campaign===

527 groups such as ADP are legally barred from coordinating with political campaigns. However, it was reported that Bernie Friedman and Peter Deutsch were close friends who attend the same synagogue and often had lunch together. The &quot;Tampa Tribune&quot; went as far as to criticize Deutsch for &quot;trying to hide behind a phony political action group.&quot;

Deutsch and Friedman both maintained that they were not coordinating with each other. On July 14, Deutsch stated that he did not approve of the ADP&#x27;s tactics, but that he could not make ADP stop its attacks because such a request would constitute illegal coordination. Despite Deutsch&#x27;s statements, several major newspapers in Florida treated ADP as a wing of the Deutsch campaign, and have blamed Deutsch for ADP&#x27;s actions.

===Whether ADP&#x27;s claims were justified===

Several publications and officials defended Castor:

*On June 29, Senator Bob Graham, who had previously remained outside of the Castor-Deutsch infighting, released a statement that &quot;Betty Castor acted appropriately as President of the University of South Florida to deal with Sami Al-Arian.&quot;
*On July 1, the &quot;Jewish Journal&quot; published an editorial titled &quot;Shame on Deutsch – Castor smeared.&quot;
*Also on July 1, the &quot;Tallahassee Democrat&quot; wrote that &quot;Deutsch is indulging in low-down hindsight politics.&quot;
*On July 2, the &quot;Daytona Beach News-Journal&quot; called the charges against Castor &quot;groundless&quot; and a &quot;cheap shot,&quot; comparing ADP&#x27;s practices to red-baiting.
*On July 11, former FBI Tampa bureau chief Al Robinson was quoted in the &quot;St. Petersburg Times&quot; as saying that Castor &quot;asked for more information but was not told anything.&quot;

However, others stated that the ADP&#x27;s allegations are true:

*On July 4, the &quot;Boca Raton News&quot; wrote that &quot;these charges are justified and Deutsch need make no apology for bringing this ugly situation to the forefront of this campaign. Castor should be held accountable for not reacting to the Al-Arian terrorist links with the fervor it deserved. Standing by and watching while the public university you lead becomes a bastion for terrorist activities is not acceptable.&quot;
*On July 11, the &quot;Boca Raton News&quot; wrote that &quot;Jewish Journal&quot; publisher Bruce Warshal, &quot;has become a joke – and his upcoming endorsement of Castor in spite of this ugly affair and comments she has made regarding Israel will be laughed at by readers of his publication.&quot;
*Former federal prosecutor John Loftus states that Castor &quot;...had the full resources of the University to help her. She chose to avoid her duty as a public officer. In an act of moral cowardice, she wrote her staff &#x27;I am deeply concerned by implications that the University should &#x27;investigate&#x27; entities or people and be the arbiter of what political, social or religious ideology is &quot;good&quot; or &quot;evil.&quot;&#x27; Her Vice President agreed that Al Arian&#x27;s organization was an &#x27;important cultural group&#x27; that was &#x27;part of the USF diversity commitment.&#x27;&quot;

<doc id="763813" wikidata="Q2487481" url="?curid=763813" title="Cello Concerto (Elgar)">
<text>Edward Elgar&#x27;s Cello Concerto in E minor, Op. 85, his last major completed work, is a cornerstone of the solo cello repertoire. Elgar composed it in the aftermath of the First World War, when his music had already become out of fashion with the concert-going public. In contrast with Elgar&#x27;s earlier Violin Concerto, which is lyrical and passionate, the Cello Concerto is for the most part contemplative and elegiac.

The October 1919 premiere was a debacle because Elgar and the performers had been deprived of adequate rehearsal time. Elgar made two recordings of the work with Beatrice Harrison as soloist. Since then, leading cellists from Pablo Casals onward have performed the work in concert and in the studio, but the work did not achieve wide popularity until the 1960s, when a recording by Jacqueline du Pré caught the public imagination and became a classical best-seller.

== History ==

Elgar is not known to have begun work on the concerto until 1919. In 1900 the cellist of the Brodsky Quartet, , had obtained the composer&#x27;s agreement to write something for the cello one day. Fuchs and his friend the cellist Paul Grümmer later reminded Elgar of this. The composer&#x27;s biographer Jerrold Northrop Moore speculates that Elgar may have recalled the promise when planning a new concerto in 1919.

In 1918 Elgar underwent an operation in London to have an infected tonsil removed. The night after his return from hospital to his London house he wrote down the melody that would become the first theme of the concerto. He and his wife soon retired to their secluded country cottage &quot;Brinkwells&quot; near Fittleworth, Sussex. During 1918 Elgar composed three chamber works there which his wife commented were noticeably different in style and character from his previous compositions. After their premieres in the spring of 1919, he began realising his idea of a cello concerto. The work is dedicated to Sidney Colvin and his wife, friends of Elgar.

The concerto had a disastrous premiere, at the opening concert of the London Symphony Orchestra&#x27;s 1919–20 season on 27 October 1919. Apart from the concerto, which the composer conducted, the rest of the programme was conducted by Albert Coates, who overran his rehearsal time at the expense of Elgar&#x27;s. Lady Elgar wrote, &quot;that brutal selfish ill-mannered bounder ... that brute Coates went on rehearsing.&quot; The critic of &quot;The Observer&quot;, Ernest Newman, wrote, &quot;There have been rumours about during the week of inadequate rehearsal. Whatever the explanation, the sad fact remains that never, in all probability, has so great an orchestra made so lamentable an exhibition of itself. ... The work itself is lovely stuff, very simple – that pregnant simplicity that has come upon Elgar&#x27;s music in the last couple of years – but with a profound wisdom and beauty underlying its simplicity.&quot; Elgar attached no blame to his soloist, Felix Salmond, who played for him again later. Elgar said that if it had not been for Salmond&#x27;s diligent work in preparing the piece, he would have withdrawn it from the concert entirely.

In contrast with the First Symphony, which received a hundred performances worldwide in just over a year from its premiere, the Cello Concerto did not have a second performance in London for more than a year. Elgar&#x27;s music was by this time widely seen as old-fashioned, less appropriate to the post-war era than to the Edwardian. The American premiere of the concerto was given in Carnegie Hall, New York on 21 November 1922 by Jean Gerardy with the Philadelphia Orchestra conducted by Leopold Stokowski. It was received with little enthusiasm: &quot;The New York Herald&quot; found most of the work &quot;reflective, melancholy and generally depressing&quot;; &quot;The New York Times&quot; thought the thematic material &quot;is not rich; it is spun out, sometimes pretty thin&quot;. Gerardy later introduced the concerto in Poland and Australia. &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; found the work original, musicianly and an admirable addition to the cello repertoire, but &quot;without the qualities that kindle the imagination of the listener&quot;.

Later the concerto gained greater appreciation. In 1955 the authors of &quot;The Record Guide&quot; wrote of &quot;the irresistible appeal of the Cello Concerto&quot;, although &quot;the task of interpreting the solo is extremely difficult&quot;, requiring &quot;a reserved dignity that is peculiarly English&quot;. By 1967, according to the critic Edward Greenfield, Jacqueline du Pré was &quot;convincing audiences from New York to Moscow that Elgar is – on occasion at least – exportable&quot;.

The work has become, along with Dvořák&#x27;s Op. 104, one of the two most frequently performed cello concertos in the international repertoire.

== Music ==
This work is scored for solo cello, 2 flutes, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets in A, 2 bassoons, 4 horns in F, 2 trumpets in C, 3 trombones, tuba, timpani, and strings.

The work typically plays for a little under 30 minutes; it has four movements:

The first movement is in ternary form with an introduction. It opens with a recitative for the solo cello, immediately followed by a short answer from the clarinets, bassoons and horn.
&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
\relative c&#x27; { \set Staff.midiInstrument = #&quot;cello&quot; \clef bass \numericTimeSignature \time 4/4 \key e \minor \tempo &quot;Adagio&quot; 4 = 56 2\downbow\ff-^_&quot;nobilmente&quot; &lt;e g, b, e,&gt;\downbow-^ | \stemDown &lt;d e, g, c,&gt;8\downbow\sf[ c] b[ c] &lt;a fis b, dis,&gt;4\sf }
&lt;/score&gt;

An ad lib modified scale played by the solo cello follows. The viola section then presents a rendition of the main theme in Moderato, and passes it to the solo cello who repeats it. Elgar considered it to be his tune: &quot;if you ever hear someone whistling this melody around the Malvern Hills, that will be me&quot;.
&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; \relative c&#x27; { \set Staff.midiInstrument = #&quot;cello&quot; \clef treble \key e \minor \tempo &quot;Moderato&quot; \time 9/8 fis4(\p g8 fis4 a8 b4 a8) | g4( e8 d4 e8 c4 b8) | a4 } &lt;/score&gt;
The string section plays the theme a third time and then the solo cello modifies it into a fortissimo restatement. The orchestra reiterates, and the cello presents the theme a final time before moving directly into a lyrical E major middle section.
&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; \relative c&#x27; { \set Staff.midiInstrument = #&quot;cello&quot; \clef bass \time 12/8 \key e \major gis8.\mf( a16 gis8) cis4(\&lt; fis8\!) fis4.\&gt; e\! } &lt;/score&gt;
This transitions into a similar repetition of the first section. This section omits the fortissimo modified theme in the solo cello. The slower first movement moves directly into the second movement.
The second movement opens with a fast crescendo with pizzicato chords in the cello. Then, the solo cello plays what will be the main motive of the Allegro molto section.
&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; \relative c&#x27; { \set Staff.midiInstrument = #&quot;cello&quot; \clef bass \key e \minor \tempo &quot;Allegro molto&quot; 4 = 138 \numericTimeSignature \time 4/4 b16-.\pp b-. b-. b-.\&lt; b( d) d\! d d( b) b\&gt; b b( a) a a\! | b4 } &lt;/score&gt;
Pizzicato chords follow. A brief cadenza is played, and sixteenth-note motive and chords follow. A ritardando leads directly to a scherzo-like section which remains until the end.

The slow third movement starts and ends with a lyrical melody, and one theme runs through the entire movement.
&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; \relative c { \set Staff.midiInstrument = #&quot;cello&quot; \clef bass \time 3/8 \tempo &quot;Adagio&quot; 8 = 50 \key bes \major d8(\p\&lt; f) bes\! | f&#x27;\&gt;( fis g^&quot;ten&quot;)\! | r bes,( c) | d4( f8)^&quot;ten&quot;\&gt; | r\! g,( a) | bes4( d8)^&quot;ten&quot;\&gt; | r\! bes-_\pp a-_ | f4 } &lt;/score&gt;
The end flows directly into the finale (again with no pause). The fourth movement begins with another fast crescendo and ends at fortissimo. The solo cello follows with another recitative and cadenza. The movement&#x27;s main theme is noble and stately, but with undertones and with many key-changes.
&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; \relative c&#x27; { \set Staff.midiInstrument = #&quot;cello&quot; \clef treble \time 2/4 \key e \minor \tempo &quot;Allegro, ma non troppo&quot; 4 = 108 e8\ff_&quot;risoluto&quot; r \slashedGrace { e( } g4-^) | \grace { fis16[( g] } fis8-!) e16 fis d8 c16 d | b8-&gt; r \slashedGrace { b( } d4-^) | \grace { c16[( d] } c8)-ł| b16 c a8 b16 c | b8-&gt; } &lt;/score&gt;

Near the end of the piece, the tempo slows into a &quot;più lento&quot; section, in which a new set of themes appears.
&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; \relative c&#x27; { \set Staff.midiInstrument = #&quot;cello&quot; \clef treble \time 3/4 \key e \minor \partial 4*1 ees4\ff | des&#x27;^&quot;ten&quot;\sf c bes8\&gt; g | bes4^&quot;ten&quot;\sf\! aes } &lt;/score&gt;

The tempo slows further, to the tempo of the third movement, and the theme from that movement is restated. This tempo continues to slow until it becomes stagnant, and the orchestra holds a chord. Then, at the very end of the piece, the recitative of the first movement is played again. This flows into a reiteration of the main theme of the fourth movement, with tension building until the final three chords, which close the piece.

== Recordings ==

Elgar and Beatrice Harrison made a truncated recording in 1920, using the acoustic recording process. The first complete recording was made in 1928, by Harrison, Elgar and the New Symphony Orchestra. There were later 78 rpm recordings with W. H. Squire and Pablo Casals as soloists, but the work was infrequently recorded until the LP era of the 1950s to the 1970s.

A key recording was made in 1965 by EMI, with British cellist Jacqueline du Pré as soloist and the London Symphony Orchestra conducted by Sir John Barbirolli. It was this recording that according to one critic &quot;even persuaded the Americans to listen enraptured to Elgar&quot;. Since then there have been more than seventy recordings issued, with soloists including in the 1960s Pierre Fournier and Mstislav Rostropovich, in the 1970s Paul Tortelier, in the 1980s Lynn Harrell, Heinrich Schiff, Yo-Yo Ma and Steven Isserlis, in the 1990s Mischa Maisky, János Starker, Pieter Wispelwey and Truls Mørk, in the 2000s Anne Gastinel and Raphael Wallfisch, and later Sol Gabetta, Paul Watkins, Antonio Meneses and Sheku Kanneh-Mason.

In 1985 Julian Lloyd Webber recorded the concerto with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Yehudi Menuhin. For &quot;BBC Music Magazine&quot; Jerrold Northrop Moore chose this as the finest version to date and it won a Brit Award for &quot;Best Classical Recording&quot; of 1985. The BBC Radio 3 feature &quot;Building a Library&quot; has presented comparative reviews of all available versions of the concerto on three occasions. &quot;The Penguin Guide to Recorded Classical Music&quot;, 2008, has three pages of reviews of the work. The only recording to receive the top recommendation of both the BBC and &quot;The Penguin Guide&quot; is du Pré&#x27;s 1965 recording with the LSO and Barbirolli. Other recordings commended by both the BBC and &quot;The Penguin Guide&quot; are by Beatrice Harrison (1928); Stephen Isserlis (1988); Yo-Yo Ma (1985) and Truls Mørk (1999).

The German periodical &quot;Fono Forum&quot; in a 2022 discographic survey of the work recommends recordings featuring as soloists Harrison, du Pré, Tortelier, Robert Cohen, Michaela Fukačová, Daniel Müller-Schott and Watkins.

<text>Wishbringer: The Magick Stone of Dreams is an interactive fiction video game written by Brian Moriarty and published by Infocom in 1985. It was intended to be an easier game to solve than the typical Infocom release and provide a good introduction to interactive fiction for inexperienced players, and was well received.

==Plot==
The player&#x27;s character is a postal clerk in the small fishing village of Festeron. The cranky postmaster, Mr. Crisp, orders the player to deliver an important envelope to the proprietor of Ye Olde Magick Shoppe. The proprietor asks the player to rescue her cat from a mysterious sorceress known only as The Evil One. Stepping out of the store, the player finds that quaint Festeron has mysteriously been transformed into a more sinister town called Witchville. There are but a few hours to defeat The Evil One.

==Gameplay==
A player can solve &quot;Wishbringer&quot; by using the wishing stone, then play it again without using it to get a higher score. A few Infocom games have puzzles with multiple solutions (for example, the &quot;Loud Room&quot; from &quot;Zork&quot;). However, &quot;Wishbringer&quot; has several such puzzles, many of which can be solved either in a straightforward (that is, non-magical) manner or by using one of the stone&#x27;s wishes. The game can be successfully completed without using any wishes: At the Congratulations screen, the game informs the player of this fact, if the player had used any wishes. Conversely, it is impossible to finish the game using all of the stone&#x27;s wishes (wishing for flight invariably causes the game to be lost.)

==Development==
The work on &quot;Wishbringer&quot; began in 1984 when Infocom marketing requested an easy game to introduce customers to text adventures. Moriarty suggested adding a magic ring, then a magic rock, to the package, then began writing the game based on the rock. Because it sold well, Moriarty mentioned in July 1986 that a sequel was forthcoming, but none appeared.

The relations of the Wishbringer objects to the wishes are described in the feelies, as a form of copy protection. When Infocom games were later repackaged by Activision, the information in the feelies had to be reproduced in printed form. Included in the &quot;Wishbringer&quot; package are several items, which Infocom called feelies: a book, &quot;The Legend of Wishbringer&quot;, that explains how the magic stone came to be (in the Solid Gold release, an in-game object included in the player&#x27;s starting inventory instead of the packaging); the envelope and letter to be delivered to Ye Olde Magick Shoppe; a &quot;postal zone map&quot; of Festeron; and a plastic glow-in-the-dark replica of the stone.

==Reception==
&quot;Wishbringer&quot; was very well received. Infocom sold about 75,000 copies in the first six months; it was the company&#x27;s fifth best-selling game, selling about 150,000 copies in total.

According to &quot;Your Computer&quot;, it is &quot;all great stuff. Like all Infocom adventures, the prose is of the highest quality.&quot; &quot;Commodore Power Play&quot; reviewer called it &quot;without a doubt, one of the top three beginner&#x27;s interactive fiction games.&quot; &quot;The Rainbow Magazine&quot; wrote that it rated it 9.95 out of 10, while &quot;Computer &amp; Video Games&quot; awarded it a perfect 10/10. Other review scores included a 92% from &quot;Amstrad Action&quot;, an 88% from &quot;CU Amiga&quot;, and an overall 85% from &quot;Zzap!64&quot;.

==Legacy==
&quot;Wishbringer&quot; was one of five top-selling titles to be re-released in Solid Gold versions including in-game hints. Craig Shaw Gardner novelized &quot;Wishbringer&quot; in the Infocom Book line.

<text>Triscuit is a brand name of snack crackers which take the form of baked square whole wheat wafers. Invented in 1900, a patent was granted in 1902 and the Shredded Wheat Company began production the next year in Niagara Falls, New York. The Niagara site being chosen due to its proximity to the Niagara Falls Hydraulic Power generating plant which opened in 1895, the first major electric-generating site in the United States.

== History ==
The Shredded Wheat Company began producing Triscuit in 1903 in Niagara Falls, New York. The name &quot;Triscuit&quot; may have come from a combination of the words &quot;electricity&quot; and &quot;biscuit&quot; or the commonly held belief that &quot;tri&quot; is a reference to the three ingredients used (wheat, oil, and salt), but this is disputed due to conflicting adverts and poor records. At least one early advertisement boasted that Triscuits were &quot;Baked by electricity&quot;, claiming they were &quot;the only food on the market prepared by this 1903 process&quot;. Each cracker measured , and remained that size for nearly 21 years. The ovens were then altered and the cracker size changed to squares.

In 1928, the Shredded Wheat Company was purchased by Nabisco.

Beginning in 1935, Triscuits were sprayed with oil and salted. In 1984, additional flavor choices were introduced and the crackers were made crispier.

==Overview==
Triscuits are made from wheat, which is first cooked in water until it reaches about fifty percent moisture content, then tempered to allow the moisture to diffuse evenly in the grain. Slotted rollers form the grain into shredded wheat strands, which are then formed into webs. Several webs are stacked together and the still-moist stack is crimped to produce individual crackers. Oven baking then reduces the moisture content to five percent. The product is currently a square.

<text>Mongo is a fictional planet where the comic strip (and later movie serials) of &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; takes place. Mongo was created by the comics artist Alex Raymond in 1934, with the assistance of Raymond&#x27;s ghostwriter Don Moore. Mongo is depicted as being ruled by a usurper named Ming the Merciless, who is shown as a harsh and oppressive dictator.

The planet is depicted as being inhabited by different cultures, and having a varied ecosystem. The technology of these cultures varies from groups at a Stone Age level, to highly technologically advanced peoples. At the beginning of the comic strip, almost all of these cultures are shown as being under the domination of the tyrant Ming. In all the versions of the &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; story, Flash Gordon is shown as unifying the peoples of Mongo against Ming, and eventually removing him from power. Later stories often depict Mongo under the rule of its rightful leader, Prince Barin.

==Overview==
In the &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; comic strips and comic books, Mongo is usually depicted as Earth-like. Its atmosphere is compatible with Terran life, and the dominant species on Mongo are human-like, such as Ming&#x27;s people and the Arborians. Other peoples of Mongo have evolved into different forms, such as the winged Hawkmen, the tailed Lion Men, and the underwater dwelling Coralians. Mongo is about half the diameter of Earth but is considerably denser, so its gravity is only slightly weaker than the Earth&#x27;s, although it still allows Flash Gordon to put his gymnastics skills to good use. Mongo has a variety of climates, and is inhabited by enormous, dinosaur-like monsters.

In Alex Raymond&#x27;s comic strip and the Flash Gordon movie serials, Mongo was shown as a rogue planet that had drifted into Earth&#x27;s solar system. Later versions of the Flash Gordon story, such as the 1980 film, the 1996 cartoon series, and the Dynamite Entertainment comics, show Mongo as being in another star system or galaxy, and coming into contact with Earth&#x27;s system through a wormhole-like portal.

The demonym of the planet&#x27;s people vary according to different writers. Mongo&#x27;s inhabitants have been referred to as &quot;Mongonians&quot;, &quot;Mongoans&quot;, and &quot;Mongori&quot;.

==Alex Raymond&#x27;s depiction==
Mongo was first introduced in the comic strip as a &quot;rogue planet&quot;, threatening to collide with Earth. After Hans Zarkov abducted Flash Gordon and Dale Arden, they crash-landed Zarkov&#x27;s rocket ship on Mongo near Mingo City, Ming&#x27;s capital. Mingo City is near the equator of the planet. Mingo City is an enormous metropolis from where Ming&#x27;s government rules most of the planet. Mongo&#x27;s political structure is portrayed as exclusively monarchical. Each realm Flash Gordon visits has its own king or queen. At the start of the strip, most of the kingdoms of Mongo are under Ming&#x27;s suzerainty, and their rulers always follow Ming&#x27;s commands. The exceptions are Prince Barin and Thun, ruler of the Lion Men. When Flash Gordon arrives on Mongo, he finds Prince Barin is leading a guerrilla war against Ming from Arboria. Thun, the Lion Man, is also Ming&#x27;s active enemy.

Under Mingo City is a power station where the Power Men of Mongo, a group of electrical engineers led by Ergon, work. Also beneath Mingo City is an abandoned sewer system where a band of rebels against Ming&#x27;s rule,&quot;the Freeman&quot; make their base. The Freeman are led by the eyepatch-wearing Count Bulok. To the west of Mingo City is the Land of the Lion Men, ruled by King Thun. The Lion Men&#x27;s country is rendered by Raymond as a region of rocky hills dotted by bushes. The Lion Men are shown as living in large tents and flying &quot;Space Gyro&quot; aircraft. Bordering the Sea of Mystery is the city of the Shark Men, led by Ming supporter King Kala. Underneath the fog-shrouded Sea of Mystery, is the underwater kingdom of Coralia, ruled by Queen Undina. Northeast of Mingo City is the airborne Sky City of the Hawkmen, governed by Vultan. Sky City hovers above a region of grassland dotted with crags. Between Mingo City and Sky City is the land of the Brown Dwarves. East of Sky City is Flame World, a dusty region of scarps and ravines of basaltic rock. Flame World owes its name to the lava eruptions that regularly occur in the area. East of the Lion Men&#x27;s kingdom are the Magnetic Mountains, which emanate magnetic forces that often interfere with the navigation of aircraft flying over them. Southwards from these Mountains is a &quot;Tournament Arena&quot; where the peoples of Mongo meet once a year for the &quot;Tournament of Death&quot;, a combat to the death between Mongo&#x27;s gladiators. Part of the planet is covered by the forest kingdom of Arboria, ruled by Prince Barin, leader of the Treemen who live there. Arboria has enormous trees resembling giant redwoods. Arboria is also inhabited by two primitive tribes hostile to the Treemen: the blue-skinned, fanged Tusk Men, a group of cannibals, and the warlike Horned Ape Men. To the far north, an area of mountains and caverns makes up the frozen kingdom of Frigia, ruled by Queen Fria. Frigia has enormous, ostrich-like &quot;snowbirds&quot; that the inhabitants ride. Frigia&#x27;s inhabitants are shown as being technologically advanced, using rocket ships, electric heaters, and transparent &quot;snowsuits&quot; capable of protecting their inhabitants from the cold. The Frigians are often attacked by giants three times the size of a normal human. These giants are led by their chieftain, Brukka. A railroad, with rocket-powered passenger trains running on it, links Mingo City and Frigia&#x27;s southern borderland.

Mongo also has extensive underground domains. One of these domains is Kira the Cave World. Kira&#x27;s capital is Syk, ruled by the evil Queen Azura, ruler of the Blue Magic Men. Kira is also inhabited by Lizard Men who capture and eat the other inhabitants of Mongo. South of Kira is &quot;Volcano World&quot;, a realm of mountains and lava flows. In this region dwell the Fire People, who wear suits of asbestos armour and use flamethrowers in combat. The Fire People are led by Ming&#x27;s ally, King Orax, and are known for their ability to build devastating weapons. Westwards is a jungle, home of the Monkey Men. Further west is the Great Desert of Mongo, the largest such region on the planet. The Great Desert is the base for Ming&#x27;s Desert Legion, as well as the home of pastoral nomads who oppose Ming&#x27;s rule. At the planet&#x27;s south pole is the Ice Kingdom of Naquk. Naquk is the ruler of a group of giants aligned with Ming&#x27;s forces. These giants are more technologically advanced than the variety in Frigia, and travel in mechanical &quot;tractor sleds&quot; fitted with artillery guns.

Across the eastern ocean there are two island continents. One is the jungle continent of Tropica, ruled by Queen Desira. Tropica&#x27;s north and western coasts have a warm, Mediterranean-like climate, rich in verdure.
A dense jungle covers the middle of the continent, which contains deadly monsters called Tree Dragons. Beyond this region lies the Fiery Desert of Mongo, a torrid region prone to volcanism. The Fiery Desert is home of Gundar the Desert Hawk and his Bedouin-like tribe. In Tropica, the villain Brazor usurps the rightful ruler Queen Desira and becomes&#x27; the area&#x27;s tyrannical despot. Flash leads a rebellion against Brazor (who briefly replaced Ming as the comic strip&#x27;s main antagonist) and eventually defeats him. To the north-west of Tropica is an &quot;Unexplored Continent&quot;.

==Later depictions==
After Raymond left the &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; strip in 1944, his successors would add new characters and locations to Mongo. Austin Briggs created Kang the Cruel, the son of Ming. Kang would depose Barin and take over Mongo, resulting in Flash leading another rebellion. Mac Raboy created several new elements for the fictional planet&#x27;s mythology, including giving Mongo two moons, Lunita and Exila, as well as the ice kingdom of Polaria, ruled by the tyrant Polon, (who has the power to shrink or enlarge living things). Jim Keefe made the Unexplored Continent the location where the villain Garakahn had his fortress. In some versions of the comic strip, Mingo City is renamed &quot;Alania&quot; after Ming&#x27;s overthrow.

In the 2011 Dynamite Comics &quot;Flash Gordon:Zeitgeist&quot;, Ming opens a portal between dimensions to enable Mongo to attack Earth in the year 1934. This story also describes Mongo as the &quot;Crossroads of the Known Universes&quot;. The prequel, &quot;Merciless:The Rise of Ming&quot; depicts Ming&#x27;s ascent to power over Mongo. In this version Emperor Krang, wishes to unite Mongo&#x27;s five warring realms (Arboria, Ardentia, Aerie, Aquaria, and Frigia). Krang&#x27;s son, Ming, eventually does so by force. In the later Dynamite &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; series, Mongo is the base of Ming&#x27;s empire. Mongo harbours a &quot;Valley of Portals&quot; which contains portals which lead to the other worlds Ming rules, including Arboria and Coralia.

==Cartography==
Arlene Williamson (the first wife of Al Williamson) and Jim Keefe both drew maps of the planet Mongo, based closely on Raymond&#x27;s stories. The game &quot;Flash Gordon &amp; the Warriors of Mongo&quot; (see below), also featured Lin Carter&#x27;s map of the planet, similar to the Arlene Williamson version.

==Mongo in other media==

===Radio===
Starting April 22, 1935, the radio serial &quot;The Amazing Interplanetary Adventures of Flash Gordon&quot;, began airing. The series featured stories set on Mongo, closely following the plot of the comic strip.

===Film===

====&quot;Flash Gordon&quot; (1936 serial)====
The 1936 serial depicts Mongo as a rogue planet drifting towards Earth. The serial&#x27;s Mongo is a wild, rocky planet filled with monsters.

====&quot;Flash Gordon Conquers the Universe&quot;====
The second Flash Gordon serial was set on Mars, but the third returned to Mongo. In &quot;Flash Gordon Conquers the Universe&quot; Flash and his friends travel to Mongo&#x27;s land of Frigia to find a cure for the Purple Death, which is ravishing Earth.

====&quot;Flash Gordon&quot; (1980 film)====
In the &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; film from 1980, Mongo is depicted as a barren world covered with tall, very slender hills that look like spikes, but with a very colorful extended atmosphere that is capable of supporting the weight of various miles-wide chunks of rock that are called &quot;moons&quot;, including Arboria and Frigia. The people of Mongo resemble humans but with slight differences, such as having blue or green blood, or having their bodies undergo rapid disintegration when killed. The novelization of the film by Arthur Byron Cover adds further information about this version of the planet. This Mongo is an enormous rocky plateau that sits at the still centre of &quot;an ancient cosmic whirlpool&quot;, outside the normal flow of time and space. Mongo was settled in &quot;the dim forgotten past&quot; by Ming&#x27;s people. Ming uses a portal called the &quot;Imperial Vortex&quot; to attack planets from Mongo; Dr. Zarkov&#x27;s space capsule travels to Mongo after being sucked into this vortex. The whirlpool often sucks in meteors and makes them crash on the planet; Mongo&#x27;s people often mine these meteors for their minerals.

===Television===

====&quot;The New Adventures of Flash Gordon&quot;====
This 1979 version depicted a planet Mongo similar to Raymond&#x27;s original comic strips, featuring the kingdoms and peoples, and rulers who feature prominently in the 1930s stories. However, some minor changes were made (the Lion Men had the heads of lions in addition to tails, and Brazor was renamed &quot;Braznor&quot;). It also featured a storyline involving the caverns of the Witch Kingdom of Sykland. Queen Azura, the ruler, becomes convinced that Gordan is the reincarnation of Ghor-Dhan, the legendary founder of Syk.

====&quot;Defenders of the Earth&quot;====
The 1986 cartoon showed a frozen planet Mongo where all the natural resources had been exhausted, thus motivating Ming to move to Earth and attack the planet.

====&quot;Flash Gordon&quot; (1996 TV series)====
In this animated version, Flash, Dale and Zarkov arrive on Mongo through a dimensional portal. They are trapped on the planet after sealing the portal to stop Ming using it to invade earth. This version renamed the Hawkmen &quot;Birdmen&quot; and the Lion Men &quot;Leonids&quot;.

====&quot;Flash Gordon&quot; (2007 TV series)====
In the Scifi Channel series &quot;Flash Gordon&quot;, Mongo is a planet, &quot;in another dimension&quot; (i.e. parallel universe). It is explained that &quot;the dimensional shift&quot; is &quot;quite small&quot; and that there is an inherent connection between Earth and Mongo, where the quantum mechanics of Bell&#x27;s theorem and EPR paradox are working on a planetary scale. That is why there are so many similarities between both worlds, including language and Homo Sapiens evolving on both planets. It is theorized that at some point in time and space, the two planets were much closer. Mongo&#x27;s government is called the &quot;United Peoples of Mongo&quot;, ruled by Emperor Ming.

In the episode &quot;Sorrow&quot;, it is revealed that Mongo was once a prosperous blue and green planet; it relied on a glowing red ore called zerilium that was mined on the moon. Mongo&#x27;s inhabitants even built two small artificial moons named Arkaylia and Surd to process zerilium and shelter the miners. An accident on Mongo released poisonous zerilium gas into the air, which caused acid rain, killed wildlife, and contaminated Mongo&#x27;s water. The planet became uninhabitable. A small portion of Mongo&#x27;s people emigrated to Arkaylia. After three generations on the artificial moon, Mongo&#x27;s environment partially repaired itself. As a result, the people returned to the planet. Clean water, known as &quot;source water&quot;, still remained scarce and came from underground. Centuries later, Ming seized power and began his rule.

===Role-playing games===
The 1977 Fantasy Games Unlimited role-playing game &quot;Flash Gordon &amp; the Warriors of Mongo&quot; used the planet Mongo as its setting. The game was designed by science fiction writer Lin Carter and game designer Scott Bizar. Players took the role of rebels attempting to recruit the various peoples of Mongo to rebel against Ming. The game had information describing the various realms of the planet.

In 2018, Pinnacle Entertainment Group (Pinnacle Games) published &quot;The Savage World of Flash Gordon RPG.&quot; The 192 page genre setting was written by Scott Woodard with artwork drawn by the original comic strip artist, Alex Raymond.

==Critical analysis==
Comics historian Ron Goulart suggests that the plot of Mongo threatening to collide with Earth was inspired by the novel &quot;When Worlds Collide&quot; by Philip Wylie and Edwin Balmer, while the societies on the planet were informed by the works of popular science fiction writers Edgar Rice Burroughs and Abraham Merritt. Film historian Michael Benson describes Mongo as &quot;a combination of the futuristic and the primitive. Though their technology is advanced, their Hollywood costumes resemble those of the Roman Empire. Mongonian soldiers, despite their superior arsenal, would prefer to draw swords for battle&quot;. Academic John Cheng identifies themes of yellow peril in depictions of Mongo&#x27;s politics. Cheng calls these themes &quot;different and more radical&quot;, as Ming&#x27;s control of Mongo is absolute and openly acknowledged instead of a secret and shadowy conspiracy. Though they are the invaders, Flash Gordon and his friends are depicted as liberators of planet Mongo. Cheng states that their use of excorporation in order to weaken and ultimately unseat Ming reinforces his nature as &quot;familiarly Asian&quot;.

<text>Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain (born 27 January 1946) is a senior Pakistani politician who previously served as 16th prime minister of Pakistan. Hussain is the party president of the PML(Q) since 2003.

Hailing from the business-industrialist Chaudhry family from the Punjab province of Pakistan, Hussain graduated from the FC College University and the Punjab University. After his graduation, Hussain subsequently joined the family business comprising large numbers of industries, textiles, agricultural farms, sugar and flour mills. He successfully contested in the non-partisan 1985 elections and was appointed as minister of industry in the government of Prime minister Muhammad Junejo, lasting until 1988. Hussain became a leader and influential conservative figure in the Islamic Democratic Alliance (IDA) between 1988 and 1990 and joined the Pakistan Muslim League (PML) under Nawaz Sharif in 1993.

<text>Duncan McDuffie (September 24, 1877 – 1951) was a real estate developer, conservationist, and mountaineer based in Berkeley, California, United States.

==Developer==
McDuffie is best known for developing the Claremont and Northbrae neighborhoods of Berkeley and St. Francis Wood district in San Francisco. His upscale developments were laid out as &quot;residential parks,&quot; with streets following the contours of hills and underground power lines. Like many other developments at the time, his developments included racial covenants to exclude non-whites from home ownership, and he also promoted single-family zoning laws to exclude non-whites.

==Conservationist==

McDuffie was a notable conservationist, and was president of the Sierra Club from 1928 to 1931 and 1943–1946.

===East Bay Regional Park District===
In 1934 McDuffie helped create the East Bay Regional Park District in the Berkeley Hills.

===California state parks===
McDuffie helped establish the California state park system with the help of his friend Governor C. C. Young. He won the Pugsley Medal for his service on the California State Parks Commission.

==Mountaineer==
McDuffie was an accomplished mountaineer in the Sierra Nevada, and made first ascents of Mount Abbot and Black Kaweah.

Along with Joseph N. LeConte and James S. Hutchinson, he pioneered a high mountain route in 1908 from Yosemite National Park to Kings Canyon, roughly along the route of the modern John Muir Trail. In 28 days, they completed a trip of 228 miles through the high mountains, including several previously unexplored sections.

McDuffie suffered from Parkinson&#x27;s disease for nearly 20 years before his death in 1951. The Sierra peak Mount McDuffie is named after him.

<text>The Skagit River ( ) is a river in southwestern British Columbia in Canada and northwestern Washington in the United States, approximately 150 mi (240 km) long. The river and its tributaries drain an area of 1.7 million acres (690,000 hectares) of the Cascade Range along the northern end of Puget Sound and flows into the sound.

The Skagit watershed is characterized by a temperate, mid-latitude, maritime climate. Temperatures range widely throughout the watershed. Recorded temperatures at Newhalem range from a low of −6 °F (−21 °C) to a high of 109 °F (43 °C), with greater extremes likely in the mountains. The highest temperatures are commonly recorded in July; the lowest are in January.

==Course==
The Skagit River rises at Allison Pass in the Canadian Cascades of British Columbia. From there it flows northwest along the Crowsnest Highway, which follows the river into Manning Provincial Park. It turns abruptly south, where it receives Snass Creek from the right, then enters Skagit Valley Provincial Park at the point where it receives the Sumallo River from the right. It receives the Klesilkwa River from the right, and turns southeast to flow into Ross Lake, where it crosses the Canada–United States border and into Washington state.

Ross Lake is formed by Ross Dam and is approximately long, winding south through Ross Lake National Recreation Area. Here the river receives Beaver Creek from the right and Ruby Creek from the left. Spilling out of the dam the river enters Diablo Lake, formed by Diablo Dam, and receives Thunder and Colonial creeks from the left, before it enters the third and final reservoir, Gorge Lake, formed by Gorge Dam. All three dams are part of the Skagit River Hydroelectric Project.

Past Gorge Dam, the river is often dry, as its waters have been diverted to generate hydroelectricity. Water is returned to the river as it passes Newhalem, a company town for Seattle City Light. Copper and Bacon creeks, both flowing from North Cascades National Park, merge into the Skagit from the right as it meanders slowly through an agricultural valley, past Marblemount, where the Cascade River joins from the left, and Rockport, where it receives its major tributary, the Sauk River, from the left.

After receiving the Sauk River, the Skagit turns west, flowing past Concrete and receiving the Baker River, its second-largest tributary, from the right. The river continues to flow west, past Sedro-Woolley, Burlington and then Mount Vernon. It is crossed by Interstate 5, a major national highway, between Burlington and Mount Vernon; the four-lane bridge over the Skagit River collapsed in May 2013 and was reopened a month later.

At the former site of Skagit City, the Skagit River diverges into two forks, a north and south fork. Fir Island lies between the forks in the floodplain. These two forks both empty into Skagit Bay, a branch of Puget Sound.

==Natural history==
The Skagit provides spawning habitat for salmon. It is the only large river system in Washington that contains healthy populations of all five native salmon species – chinook, coho, chum, pink, and sockeye – and two species of trout: steelhead and coastal cutthroat.

The river supports one of the largest wintering bald eagle populations in the contiguous United States. The eagles feed on Chum and Coho salmon that have returned to spawn in the Skagit and its tributaries. The eagles arrive in late October or early November and stay into February. The highest number of eagles is usually seen in January. These eagles come from inland Canada and as far away as Alaska and Montana. When the salmon run is plentiful, as many as 600 to 800 eagles are attracted to the river.
Thousands of snow geese winter in the Skagit River estuary. These geese feed on intertidal marsh plants such as bulrush and they are drawn to nearby farmlands where they find leftover potatoes in the fields. Trumpeter swans are drawn to the estuary habitat as well. There can be several hundred swans in the Skagit valley from October to February.

Historically, the Skagit tidal estuary had beaver dams in the myrtle zone. These were overtopped at high tide, but at low tide their ponds nurtured juvenile salmon.

The Skagit River basin provides habitat for a diverse set of animals. For more information about these animals, see &quot;List of Wildlife of the Skagit River Basin.&quot;

==Geology==

The Skagit River was highly influenced by the repeated advance and retreat of the Puget Lobe of the Cordilleran Ice Sheet. Ice and gravel moraines repeatedly blocked the Skagit, causing it to pool into lakes and forcing it to drain south into the future North Fork Stillaguamish River. After the ice retreated the Skagit breached the moraine dam near Concrete, Washington, finding its present course. The Sauk River and Suiattle River continued to drain into the future North Fork Stillaguamish River until eruptions of Glacier Peak choked the rivers with debris, causing the formation of an alluvial fan near present-day Darrington, Washington. The debris forced the two rivers north to join the Skagit.

Above Newhalem, Washington, the Skagit flows through a deep gorge, contrasting strongly with the glacial valley below Newhalem. One of the several theories about this anomaly is that the upper Skagit once drained northward into Canada and the growth and retreat of successive Cordilleran ice flows brought about the reversal. Each advance blocked the river, forcing it to find new routes to the south, in the process carving deep gorges. Eventually, the Skagit gorge was so deep that even after the Cordilleran ice retreated for good, the river continued flowing south instead of north into Canada.

The Skagit watershed is made up of high peaks and low valleys. The highest points in the basin are two volcanoes: Mount Baker, elevation , and Glacier Peak, elevation . Most of the basin lies above . The river completes its course at sea level where it meets the Puget Sound.

==History==

The river takes its name from the Skagit tribe, a name used by Europeans and Americans for two distinct Native American peoples, the Upper Skagit and Lower Skagit. Native people have lived along the Skagit for thousands of years. Archaeological evidence indicates that ancestors of the Upper Skagit tribe lived in the area now called Ross Lake National Recreation Area at least 8,000 years ago. They quarried chert from Hozomeen Mountain to make blades, which were used across a wide trading area.

Both tribes traditionally spoke dialects of the Lushootseed language, a branch of the Salishan family. The Upper Skagit tribe occupied the land along the Skagit from what is now Newhalem to the mouth of the river at Puget Sound. The Lower Skagit tribe lived on northern Whidbey Island and have come to be known also as the Whidbey Island Skagit. Archaeological evidence reveals that these peoples collected their food from the natural resources, through fishing, hunting, and gathering.

The upper Skagit area was first described in writing in 1859 by Henry Custer, the American topographer for the US Boundary Commission. With two other American government men and ten locals from the Nooksack and Chilliwack bands, he canoed and portaged from the Canada–United States border down to Ruby Creek, a tributary of the upper Skagit River. The party found no native people inhabiting the Upper Skagit area at the time.

Custer later talked about the area with an elder Samona chief named Chinsoloc who had lived there at one time; he drew a detailed map from memory, which the topographer found to be accurate. (Note: It is unclear what tribe this refers to; there is no local tribe called Samona. The Skeetchestn Indian Band, of the Secwepemc (Shuswap) Nation, were located in the area of present-day Savona, British Columbia. Since the 1860s, they have had a reserve there.) Custer documented this encounter and the accuracy of the chief&#x27;s map in his &quot;Report of Henry Custer, Assistant of Reconnaissances, Made in 1859 over the routes in the Cascades Mountains in the vicinity of the 49th parallel&quot;, now in the collection of the National Park Service.

Settlement along the river by European Americans in the late 1800s was inhibited by two ancient logjams that blocked navigation upriver. The settlers first established a village at the tip of the delta which they called Skagit City. The massive logjam was found about upstream from the mouth of the river. Attempts to remove it began in 1874 by a team of loggers, who salvaged the logs. After three years of work, a section of the jam broke free and scattered downriver. Soon thereafter the river became navigable. Mount Vernon was founded at the approximate site of this logjam.

In November 1897, the Skagit River flooded severely; in the aftermath as the floodwaters receded, two new logjams formed and blocked navigation. The largest was near the mouth, and filled the river from bank to bank for about . Using a recently built logjam removal boat named &quot;Skagit&quot;, teams finally cleared this jam in about a month. The years 1909, 1917, and 1921 are the other annual peak discharges of record for the gauging station at Concrete which is at the confluence of the Baker and Skagit Rivers.

November 2017 brought significant flooding to the lower river at Mt. Vernon and Lyman.

==Wild and scenic designation==

In 1978, the United States Congress established the Skagit Wild and Scenic River System. The system includes of the Skagit and its tributaries — the Sauk, Suiattle, and Cascade rivers. This Wild and Scenic designation is meant to protect and enhance the values that caused it to be listed:

* Free-flowing characteristics and water quality of each of the four rivers;
* Outstandingly remarkable wildlife, fish, and scenic qualities.

The Skagit Wild and Scenic River System flows through both public and private lands. Fifty percent of the system is in private ownership, 44 percent is National Forest System land, and 6 percent is owned by the state and other agencies. The Skagit Wild and Scenic River is managed by the U.S. Forest Service as part of the Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest.

==Economy==
The Skagit River Hydroelectric Project is a group of three major dams, constructed in the 1920s and 1930s, which are a primary source of hydroelectric power for Seattle and other area communities. The Skagit River Railway was constructed by the city of Seattle to transport workers and construction materials for the dams. The river today is a popular destination for whitewater rafting and fly fishing.

<text>The Sanguine Fan, Op. 81, is a single-act ballet written by Edward Elgar in 1917. It was composed to raise money for wartime charities, and after two performances in 1917 and a recording of excerpts in 1920, the score was neglected until 1973, when the conductor Sir Adrian Boult revived it for a recording. It was later staged in the theatre by the London Festival Ballet.

==Background and first performance==

Elgar&#x27;s close friend and confidante, Alice Stuart-Wortley (Lady Stuart of Wortley) asked him to compose the music for a one-act ballet to be given at a fund-raising performance in aid of war charities in March 1917. Elgar agreed and wrote the music quickly: within a fortnight he had a complete short score and began the full orchestration.

The scenario was by Ina Lowther (later the founder of the ballet course at the Royal College of Music). Her inspiration came from a decorative fan painted by Charles Conder using mostly the dark red colour sanguine used in heraldry. The fan depicted a glade with on one side the mythical figures of Echo and Pan and on the other mortals in 18th-century costume. Lowther devised a story in which the mortals dance among the trees before one of the men quarrels with his lover and, as they draw apart, he curses the god of love before becoming fascinated by Echo. Pan wakes, strikes the man dead and runs off into the trees with Echo, laughing sardonically as the dead man&#x27;s lover kneels in grief over his body.

For the charity performance leading West End actors took the main roles: Gerald du Maurier played Pan and the two lovers were played by Fay Compton and Ernest Thesiger; Lowther played Echo. The first performance was part of the revue &quot;Chelsea on Tiptoe&quot; at the Chelsea Palace Theatre, London on 20 March 1917, and was conducted by the composer. Afterwards he added a further number, a shepherd&#x27;s dance, which received its premiere at a second charity performance in May.

==Music==
The score, which plays for a little under 20 minutes, is in nine continuous sections: 
*Moderato–maestoso 
*Andantino 
*Piu moderato 
*Allegro molto 
*Grandioso 
*Allegretto moderato 
*Allegro 
*Allegro 
*Moderato
==Recordings==
Elgar conducted parts of the score for an acoustic recording in 1920, and apart from the publication of a piano arrangement of a single number, &quot;Echo&#x27;s Dance&quot;, the work was thereafter neglected for more than fifty years. In 1973 Elgar&#x27;s score was unearthed and the conductor Sir Adrian Boult agreed to record it for EMI with the London Philharmonic Orchestra. Further recordings followed, conducted by Bryden Thomson (1988), David Lloyd-Jones (1998) and John Wilson (2012).

==1976 ballet==
In September 1976, at the instigation of its director, Beryl Grey, the London Festival Ballet revived the score, with a new scenario and choreography by Ronald Hynd. It was set at an Edwardian soirée in Carlton House Terrace during which twin brothers become involved in a mix-up with two elegant ladies, one of whom suspects her sanguine-coloured fan has been stolen by the other. Some of the performances were conducted by Boult, whose last public appearance was conducting a performance on 24 June 1978.

<text>Summer Glau (; born July 24, 1981) is an American actress best known for her roles in science fiction and fantasy television series: as River Tam in &quot;Firefly&quot; (2002) and its continuation film &quot;Serenity&quot; (2005), as Tess Doerner in &quot;The 4400&quot; (2005–2007), as Cameron in &quot;&quot; (2008–2009), and as Isabel Rochev / Ravager in &quot;Arrow&quot; (2013–2014).

==Early life==
Glau was born in San Antonio, Texas, where she grew up with her two younger sisters Kaitlin and Christie. She is of Scots-Irish and German ancestry.

Glau received a scholarship to a ballet company and was homeschooled from grades 3 to 12 to accommodate her ballet training. In addition to her classical ballet training, she has studied tango and flamenco.

When Glau first moved to Los Angeles in the early 2000s, she spent her time as a traveling dancer, living off paychecks from corporate events, weddings, and resort gigs.

==Career==

===Early career: 2002-2008===

Glau&#x27;s first television credit was a guest role on a 2002 episode of the television series &quot;Angel&quot;. In the episode, she was a prima ballerina who danced the titular character Giselle by Adolphe Adam.

Having met director Joss Whedon in &quot;Angel&quot;, Glau was later cast in Whedon&#x27;s critically acclaimed but short-lived TV series &quot;Firefly&quot; as River Tam, a role she later reprised for the show&#x27;s feature film sequel &quot;Serenity&quot;. Her portrayal of River Tam, a girl who was intellectually gifted but mentally unstable due to being subject to government experimentation to create an assassins program, was widely praised and garnered her a Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress in 2006. For her fight scenes in &quot;Serenity&quot;, she underwent 6 months of rigorous wushu training in Alhambra. In an interview, Glau indicated having previously auditioned for the role of a Power Ranger (White Wild Force Ranger Alyssa Enrilé) in &quot;Power Rangers Wild Force&quot; but lost to actress Jessica Rey before meeting Whedon.

After &quot;Serenity&quot;, Glau appeared on the episode &quot;Love Conquers Al&quot; of the TV series &quot;Cold Case&quot;. She had a small role in the film &quot;Sleepover&quot;, in which she played the high school senior Shelly. She also appeared in the &quot;&quot; episode &quot;What&#x27;s Eating Gilbert Grissom?&quot;, and season two of &quot;The Unit&quot; as Crystal Burns (the girlfriend of Jeremy Erhart from Michigan).

In 2006, Glau played Tess Doerner, a paranoid schizophrenic returnee in season two&#x27;s premiere of &quot;The 4400&quot;, and became a recurring character from season three onwards. She also starred in the horror comedy film &quot;Mammoth&quot; and was cast in the ABC Family TV movie &quot;The Initiation of Sarah&quot;.

In &quot;&quot;, a series that debuted in early 2008, Glau played the role of Cameron Phillips, a reprogrammed Terminator infiltration unit sent back by future John Connor to protect John&#x27;s younger self and his mother Sarah Connor from Skynet. The series&#x27; seventh episode, &quot;The Demon Hand&quot;, featured several scenes in which Glau (in character as Cameron) dances ballet, including one set to Chopin&#x27;s Nocturne in C# Minor. Glau also played Allison Young (Cameron&#x27;s human doppelgänger) in the second-season episodes &quot;Allison from Palmdale&quot; and &quot;Born to Run&quot;. In 2008, she won the Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress on Television for her portrayal of Cameron.

===2009-present===

Glau guest starred as herself in a 2009 episode of the CBS situation comedy &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot;. In the episode, she encountered the protagonists on a train ride from Los Angeles to Oakland, and Howard, Raj, and Leonard fought awkwardly for her affections.

On August 26, 2009, Glau joined the cast of Joss Whedon&#x27;s &quot;Dollhouse&quot; for 4 episodes in season two. She portrayed Bennett, the programmer for a rival Dollhouse. She also portrayed the protagonist Lindsey in the 2010 film &quot;Deadly Honeymoon&quot; and supporting character Maggie in the 2011 film &quot;The Legend of Hell&#x27;s Gate: An American Conspiracy&quot;, which was filmed close to her residence in Boerne, Texas. She also guest starred as Greta in a 2010 episode of the TV series &quot;Chuck&quot;, reuniting with her &quot;Firefly&quot; co-star Adam Baldwin.

In 2011, Glau portrayed the leading role of Orwell in NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Cape&quot;, a mysterious blogger who assisted the main character in crime fighting activities. On July 11, 2011, Glau was cast on &quot;Alphas&quot; as Skylar Adams, a recurring alpha with outstanding intellectual ability and mother to Zoe Adams, and a former acquaintance of Dr. Rosen and Nina. Moreover, she voiced Kara Zor-El in the DC Comics original animated movie &quot;Superman/Batman: Apocalypse&quot;.

In 2012, Glau played the main character Christine in the Hallmark film &quot;Help for the Holidays&quot;, an elf who went on a special assignment to help a family regain their Christmas spirit. In 2013, Glau was a female lead in the horror comedy film &quot;Knights of Badassdom&quot;, in which she took up larping. During this time, she also had minor guest appearances on the TV series &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot; and &quot;Hawaii Five-0&quot;.

In the CW superhero series &quot;Arrow&quot;, Glau portrayed the recurring antagonist Isabel Rochev (Ravager) in its second season in 2013. She also guest starred as Olivia Frampton in season 2 of the black comedy series &quot;&quot;. In 2014, Glau appeared in all 12 episodes of the TV series &quot;Sequestered&quot;, portraying a juror who seemed to have been involuntarily brought into larger conspiracy.

Glau rejoined her &quot;Firefly&quot; co-star Nathan Fillion when she guest starred in the web series &quot;Con Man&quot; (2015) as Martina and in &quot;Castle&quot; as Kendall Frost, an aspiring private detective who rivaled Fillion&#x27;s protagonist.

In 2018-2019, Glau was cast in the recurring role of Miss Jones on the Netflix crime drama series &quot;Wu Assassins&quot;. Furthermore, she provided narration in the Realm audio podcast Ctrl-Alt-Destroy, in which the protagonist was a video game designer who discovers that the game she created has been stolen as part of a top secret project.

Glau has also been featured in the short films &quot;Inside the Box&quot; and &quot;Dead End&quot;, as well as in the web series &quot;Jeff 1000&quot; (portraying herself as the friend of a robot named Jeff) and &quot;The Human Preservation Project&quot;.

==Personal life==
Glau has been married to Val Morrison since 2014, whom she met on the set of &quot;Hawaii Five-0&quot;. In January 2015, Glau gave birth to her first daughter. She gave birth to her second daughter in October 2017.

Outside of film and TV, Glau has participated in a wide variety of comic conventions across the United States and the world. She has also been an advocate for the science fiction fan community, such as through a promotional video for the Los Angeles Sci-fi World (to be opened in 2024). She has also supported wind energy in the 175th Anniversary of the Texas Revolution video series directed by Michael Cerny.

In an interview from 2012, Glau has mentioned that one of her favorite movies during childhood was &quot;Camelot&quot;, and that she would be interested in acting in period pieces, such as in those written by Jane Austen.

<doc id="763868" wikidata="Q3474195" url="?curid=763868" title="Sauk River (Washington)">
<text>The Sauk River is a tributary of the Skagit River, approximately long, in northwestern Washington in the United States. It drains an area of the high Cascade Range in the watershed of Puget Sound north of Seattle. The river is a popular destination for fly fishing. It is a National Wild and Scenic River.

Its two forks rise in the Cascades in eastern Snohomish County, in the Glacier Peak Wilderness and join to form the mainstem Sauk River at Bedal Peak. From there the river flows northwest from there through a remote section of the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest to Darrington, then north to join the Skagit River from the south at Rockport. The Sauk River receives the Suiattle River from the east approximately south of Rockport and the White Chuck River just above Darrington. Another important tributary is Clear Creek, which joins the Sauk just above Darrington.

At Darrington the Sauk River comes so close to the head of the North Fork Stillaguamish River that boats used to portage across the divide.

The name &quot;Sauk&quot; comes from the &quot;Sah-kee-ma-hu&quot; (Sauk-Suiattle tribe), a group related to the Skagit tribes, not from the Sauk tribe of the Midwestern U.S.

== South Fork ==

The South Fork Sauk River&#x27;s headwaters flow from a glacier on the northwest side of Columbia Peak. The river flows generally northwest through Seventysix Gulch to Monte Cristo, where it is joined by Glacier Creek. The South Fork continues to flow northwest until it is joined by Weden Creek, where it turns north. It flows just east of Barlow Pass, after which it is paralleled by the Mountain Loop Highway. After several miles the river enters Monte Cristo Lake. A number of camping sites are located along the South Fork Sauk River north of Monte Cristo Lake. Near Bedal Campground the South Fork converges with the North Fork to form the mainstem Sauk River.

A remarkably short and low divide, Barlow Pass, separates the South Fork Sauk River from Palmer Creek, a headwater tributary of the South Fork Stillaguamish River. The unusual geography, orientation, and size of these rivers and their valleys suggests that during the Pleistocene era the Sauk River flowed west through Barlow Pass into what it now the Stillaguamish valley.

===Tributaries===
* Glacier Creek: Joins the South Fork at Monte Cristo.
* Weden Creek: Joins about downstream from Monte Cristo.
* Elliot Creek: Joins just downstream from the outlet of Monte Cristo Lake.

== North Fork ==

The North Fork, the larger of the two forks, starts at the outlet of a small, unnamed lake opposite to Blue Lake near Johnson Mountain. It flows generally northwest for most of its length. Near its confluence with the South Fork it then turns west and rushes through a gorge in which it drops over the North Fork Falls, a powerful plunge at least high. Shortly below it also drops over smaller Lower North Fork Falls. The North Fork converges with the South Fork near Bedal Campground, forming the mainstem Sauk River.

According to Fred Beckey the source of the North Fork could be equally considered to be its tributary Cadet Creek, which joins the North Fork via Sloan Creek.

===Tributaries===
* Sloan Creek: Joins the North Fork about above Lost Creek.
** Cadet Creek: Flows from the northeast side of Monte Cristo Peak.
* Cougar Creek: Flows from Cougar Lake on the east side of Bedal Peak.
* Lost Creek: Joins about above the North Fork&#x27;s mouth.

==History==

In 1890 prospectors exploring north from the Skykomish River basin made discoveries leading to the mining boom at Monte Cristo near the source of the North Fork Sauk River. The difficulty of access from the south led to the 1891 construction of a narrow wagon road along the Sauk River. The Sauk wagon road ran from Sauk City on the Skagit River to the mines at Monte Cristo. A key stop on this road was the trading post at Orient, at the forks of the Sauk River. Today this area is known as Bedal. Today the Mountain Loop Highway follows part of the Sauk River more or less along the route of the old wagon road.

<doc id="763869" wikidata="Q6350082" url="?curid=763869" title="Kalaeloa Airport">
<text>Kalaeloa Airport , also called [[John Rodgers (naval officer, World War I)|John Rodgers]] Field (the original name of Honolulu International Airport) and formerly Naval Air Station Barbers Point, is a joint civil-military regional airport of the State of Hawaii established on July 1, 1999, to replace the Ford Island NALF facilities which closed on June 30 of the same year. Located on the site of the developing unincorporated town of Kalaeloa and nestled between the Honolulu communities of Ewa Beach, Kapolei and Campbell Industrial Park in West Oahu, most flights to Kalaeloa Airport originate from commuter airports on the other Hawaiian islands. While Kalaeloa Airport is primarily a commuter facility used by unscheduled air taxis, general aviation and transient and locally based military aircraft, the airport saw first-ever scheduled airline service begin on July 1, 2014, with Mokulele Airlines operating flights to Kahului Airport on Maui.

It is included in the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2017–2021, in which it is categorized as a regional reliever facility.

==Authority==
Kalaeloa Airport is part of a centralized state structure governing all of the airports and seaports of Hawaii. The official authority of Kalaeloa Airport is the Governor of Hawaii. The governor appoints the Director of the Hawaii State Department of Transportation who has jurisdiction over the Hawaii Airports Administrator.

The Hawaii Airports Administrator oversees six governing bodies: Airports Operations Office, Airports Planning Office, Engineering Branch, Information Technology Office, Staff Services Office, Visitor Information Program Office. Collectively, the six bodies have authority over the four airport districts in Hawaii: Hawaii District, Kauai District, Maui District and the principal Oahu District. Kalaeloa Airport is a subordinate of the Oahu District officials.

==Airlines and destinations==
Mokulele Airlines became the first airline to provide scheduled service at Kalaeloa when it began flights to Kahului Airport on Maui on July 1, 2014. After serving the airport for over two years and finding itself unable to make a profit doing so, the airline ended scheduled service at the airport in September 2016.

==Military usage==

NAS Barbers Point was closed by Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) action in the late 1990s, with the Navy aircraft, primarily P-3C &quot;Orion&quot; maritime patrol aircraft assigned to squadrons of Patrol Wing Two and SH-60B Seahawk helicopters assigned to Helicopter Antisubmarine Squadron Light 37 (HSL-37), relocating to Marine Corps Air Station Kaneohe Bay, now Marine Corps Base Hawaii, on the other side of the island.

CGAS Barbers Point, with its HC-130H &quot;Hercules&quot; and HH-65 &quot;Dolphin&quot; helicopters, was a former tenant command at NAS Barbers Point and continues to operate as the remaining military aviation presence at the airfield.

<text>The Birmingham Mint was a coining mint and metal-working company based in Birmingham, England. Formerly the world&#x27;s largest privately owned mint, the company produced coins for many foreign nations including France, Italy, China, and much of the British Empire during the 19th century.

Beginning life in 1817 as a family-run brass fittings maker, the company later purchased equipment from the defunct Soho Mint to begin its own coin production. Over the subsequent decades the mint won contracts to mint national currencies, and built minting facilities worldwide so that at its height the Birmingham Mint&#x27;s capacity surpassed that of even the Royal Mint.

By the early 2000s disagreement with the Royal Mint over foreign contracts led to a slump in sales, cumulating in the mint&#x27;s eventual closure in 2003 ending its almost 200-year history. According to Companies House, however, as of 2021 a revived mint continues to operate, albeit with little business activity.

== History ==

=== 18th-19th century ===
The history of the Birmingham Mint can be traced back as far as 1794, when local engineer and businessman Ralph Heaton (1755-1832) established his brass foundry on the now-demolished Slaney Street in Birmingham. Against the backdrop of the Industrial Revolution Heaton had already gained a reputation as a capable inventor who worked to manufacturer rose-engines and tools used in the various Birmingham trades of the time, such as metal working. Over the years Heaton&#x27;s sons John (b.1781), William (b. 1784), George (b. 1789), Ralph II (b. 1794), and Reuben (b. 1796) gradually joined their father in the family business. In 1817 Heaton&#x27;s fourth son Ralph Heaton II (1794–1862) established a new company within the premises of his father&#x27;s business, which by then had relocated to nearby Shadwell Street. Like his father, Heaton II focused mainly on producing brass fittings in the foundry of metals, however as a former apprentice die-maker, Heaton II also worked to produce dies. By 1847, Heaton II&#x27;s business was renamed &quot;Ralph Heaton and Son&quot; when Ralph III joined his father. A few years later in 1853 the business became &quot;Heaton and Sons&quot; when his other son George also joined. This name was retained until 1889.
On 1 April 1850. an auction was announced in the &quot;Birmingham Gazette&quot; for the selling of assets from the recently defunct Soho Mint. Included in the sale were lathes, milling machines, dies, and most notably coin presses of a similar type to those used at the Royal Mint in London. Having had experience in the die-making process, and noting a lack of any competition, Heaton made a decision to purchase the necessary equipment in hopes of taking over the contracts left in the wake of the Soho Mint&#x27;s demise. A few weeks later on 29 April, the auction was held on-site in the closed Soho Mint. Although no information regarding the bidding process was recorded, documentation from the time shows that Heaton was successful in his bidding and purchased four steam-powered screw presses and six planchet presses, which he installed on Bath/Shadwell street. Now with the tools needed to start minting coins, all that was required was government permission. Unlike the government-owned Royal Mint, which was generally forbidden from producing coins for foreign powers, private mints could be granted a special license. Heaton II wrote to his MP, Richard Spooner, who in turn vouched for Heaton&#x27;s good character. Subsequently, permission was given and the new venture could begin.

As the British Empire continued its global expansion into new territories across Asia, the government-owned Royal Mint proved unable to effectively supply the coinage needed for the burgeoning colonies. A reason for this was the inability of the Royal Mint to alternate between metals during production, meaning copper coins were passed over for the more lucrative silver and gold. Fortunately for the Birmingham Mint, this left a gap in the market which, when coupled with void left by the defunct Soho Mint, offered the promise of a steady supply of business. The first order received by the mint came in the form of tokens for Britain&#x27;s Australian colony, which had previous made orders from the Soho Mint. After this, a substantial order from Chile saw over nine million copper centavos and half centavos produced; this was the mint&#x27;s first striking of circulating coins. Soon the Royal Mint in London, which was experiencing high demand, was forced to outsource the minting of its domestic copper to the Birmingham Mint by requesting planchets for pennies halfpennies farthings half farthings and quarter farthings.

In October 1852, the mint was presented with a new opportunity outside that of simply supplying coinage. Neighbouring France were in the process of a major re-coining effort, and requested help in operating and re-equipping one of their minting facilities, in Marseille. To oversee the endeavour himself, Heaton II gathered a few of his workers and moved to Marseille for the project&#x27;s duration, while periodically making trips back to England. Upon reaching the French mint, Heaton II found it in a state of disrepair with broken coin presses and rusting milling machines which he later sold for scrap. Replacement machinery was soon ordered from the Paris Mint, and new equipment imported for Birmingham. When all was done Heaton II had spent a total of £3,700 on refurbishment. The Marseille Mint produced over 101 million coins, consisting of 1, 2, 5 and centime pieces, and after five years of production Heaton II&#x27;s involvement in France&#x27;s recoinage was complete. The mint facility was sold off for £1,080 or 27,000 francs. As overseas orders continued to increase, particularly for India, the mint added a new lever press and further equipment, filling the Shadwell Street premises to capacity. So as to accommodate their increased business, in 1860 the firm bought a 1-acre (0.40 ha) plot on Icknield Street and constructed a three-storey red brick factory which opened two years later. The new building housed eleven screws presses and one lever press.

Upon Heaton II&#x27;s death in 1862, responsibility for the company fell to his eldest son, Ralph Heaton III, who had worked alongside his father for over twenty years, and was already well-versed in the business of coin making. It was around this time that the mint began a phase-out of its cumbersome noisy screw press in favour of more modern lever presses which could produce better quality strikes at a greater speed. These lever operated presses used at the mint were developed within the mint&#x27;s own workshops, and so led to opportunities in supplying foreign countries with minting equipment.
The first of these orders for minting equipment came from Burma where the British continued to gain dominance over the Konbaung dynasty. Arriving at the royal capital of Mandalay in 1865 by early November, a mint was in operation producing four denominations of the kyat, namely the silver 1 Mu, 5 Mu, 1 Mat and 1 Kyat coins. To provide for these coins, 1,200 dies featuring the dynasty&#x27;s peacock emblem were produced in Birmingham. Over the next few years the mint continued to receive large orders for coinage including 40 million for British Hong Kong, 50 million for Romania, and over 90 million for the recently formed Kingdom of Italy.
In 1887 the Birmingham Mint was once again contacted by a foreign nation, this time representatives of the Chinese government, requesting help in the construction and operation of a new modernised minting facility in Canton province. Previous attempts by the Empress Dowager Cixi to introduce new machining techniques into China had failed, with mints in Zhili and Nanjing being unable to supplant the well established local cast cash coins. Unlike these regions, Canton was under increased Western influence with foreign merchants dealing primarily in silver. The new Canton Mint opened in 1889, and was equipped with 90 lever coining presses imported from Birmingham. With the ability to produce 2.7 million coins per day, it was the largest mint in the world. To oversee day-to-day operations and train Chinese workers, the chief of the Birmingham Mint Operative Department, Edward Wyon, remained in China for a few years before returning to England.

=== 20th century - present ===
In 1923, the U.K. government&#x27;s Royal Mint reconsidered its position on the potential commercial aspect of its operations. Up until this point, with a few exceptions for friendly countries, the Royal Mint had maintained a policy of not minting coins for foreign powers due to its position as a governmental entity. To not significantly damage the Birmingham Mint, the Royal Mint agreed to offer a third of Royal Mint&#x27;s overseas contracts. Despite this, the Birmingham Mint&#x27;s work was greatly diminished and was required to compete for new contracts. This decision was to have an enormous effect on the future of the Birmingham Mint, and marked the start of the mint&#x27;s gradual decline.

Now having to contend with the Royal Mint as competition, the Birmingham Mint looked to expand its interests outside of normal coin production. One such contract came in the form of a commission by businessman and self-appointed King Martin Coles Harman who in 1929 requested coins with his likeness be minted for use on his privately owned island of Lundy. Two coins were made for Harman, namely the Puffin and Half Puffin, which were based upon the British Penny and Half Penny. A total of 50,000 of each denomination were minted and delivered for use on the island. Subsequently, the legality of coins as a form of legal tender were called into question when they were accused of contravening the Coinage Act 1870. Harman was later brought to court and Birmingham Mint director William Ernest Bromet was ordered to give testimony on the mint&#x27;s involvement. In 1931 Harman was found guilty of breaching the Coinage Act and fined £5. The Mint was ruled to have not been liable.

In 1991, the Birmingham Mint was purchased by engineering firm IMI plc who also owned the nearby IMI Mint in Witton (formerly known as King&#x27;s Norton Mint). Under restructuring plans, the minting facility in Witton closed and operations merged with the plant on Icknield Street in Hockley. The new amalgamated mint was initially renamed the IMI Birmingham Mint, however, it was subsequently renamed to &quot;The Birmingham Mint&quot; when it was sold in 2000 to venture capital firm 3i for £18 million.

Around the same time, the European Union was increasing plans for the launch of the Euro, which over time would replace the currencies of its member states. Although the United Kingdom decided to opted out of the European currency project, the Birmingham Mint attempted to win a contract to produce coin planchets for the new Euros, which consisted of eight denominations. To showcase the mint&#x27;s striking ability and production quality, a series of pattern coins were struck for all eight of the Euro&#x27;s denominated coins. Similar to legal tender Euros, these coins featured the same reverse design, mass, dimensions, and metal composition, however, the obverse was pressed with the Birmingham Mint&#x27;s logo. Sixty-five sets of these coins were sent to mints across Europe, and a few sample pouches were made up for mint salesmen. Upon hearing of these sample coins, the European Commission deemed them illegal counterfeits and ordered their destruction. Apart from helping to supply planchets, this was the mint&#x27;s only involvement in the Euro.

By the early 2000s another financial blow was a dispute with the Royal Mint over an agreement regarding historic rights to profits on overseas contracts. The Birmingham Mint alleged the two parties had had an unwritten agreement since the 1960s that they obtain one-third of all orders the Royal Mint received from outside Europe. The Royal Mint disputed this claim, and on 12 June 2002 the Birmingham Mint filed a claim in the High Court against the Treasury for £5.4 million in damages. Two years prior to the court case, owner 3i sold the mint to former chief executive Roland Vernon, who submitted a memorandum to Parliament suggesting the rights to mint British coins be put out to tender for private companies, pointing to the Royal Mint&#x27;s poor financial performance. Despite recording an operating profit of £5.2 million in 2001; compared with the Royal Mint&#x27;s record loss in the same period of £6.5 million, the loss in business from overseas contracts proved too great, and in 2003 the mint was forced into administration under the purview of KPMG. It was later acquired by JFT Law &amp; Co., Ltd., and its assets retained by liquidators Stirchley Machine Tools, Ltd.

With the help of Birmingham City Council, in 2003 the mint became a museum and in 2011 the remainder of the mint relocated to Kidderminster, just outside Birmingham

== Mint building ==

The purpose-built 19th century Birmingham Mint building is situated on Icknield Street in the North-West of Birmingham&#x27;s Jewellery Quarter. It was constructed in 1860 after the mint&#x27;s former residence on Shadwell Street was outgrown. The building was designated Grade II Listed on 8 July 1982.

Built to encompass a rectangular yard, the works have a symmetrical formal elevation to the street, in an Italianate red brick style. A long range on 3 storeys of 2:5:1:5:2 bays, the end pairs and broader pedimented centre break forward, along with hipped slate roofs. The ground floor has round-headed windows recessed in an arcade, with ashlar impost band and keystones, rising from a basement articulated by brick pilasters set on pedestals in the applied parapet, the first floor sill course broken forward over bases; panelled zones below second floor sills defined by sections of ashlar string course between the pilasters. There is an ashlar bed mould to main entablature with projecting ashlar eaves cornice. The centrepiece has a channelled ashlar ground floor with large rounded archway, the keystone angled out as bracket to support two storey tripartite ashlar bow window with panelled aprons, divided by consoles on second floor; the main entablature is broken forward over the bow. The range along the street is the front range of a quadrangular plan, of which the interior faces of the courtyard have an arcaded treatment.

== Mint operations ==
The Birmingham Mint was best known for its coin production, however, throughout its history it also manufactured machinery and other numismatic-related products such as planchets, tokens, medals, and casino chips.

===Coins===
The mint worked with many nations to produce coins and planchets, often minting them in the Birmingham Mint itself or in one of the mints constructed overseas.

<text>James Jordan (born 1961) is an American political consultant. He has worked in Democratic politics in various capacities at the national, statewide, congressional and local levels since 1996. Jordan is best known as the first campaign manager for John Kerry’s unsuccessful 2004 presidential bid.

==Early political career==
Jordan got his start in politics as Communications Director for then-Congressman Tim Johnson in his successful run for the Senate.

Jordan went on to work as Communications Director for Senators Robert Torricelli and John Kerry. He advised the Democrats on the Senate Government Affairs Committee during the 1997 hearings on the Clinton re-election campaign&#x27;s fundraising practices, and worked with House Judiciary Committee Democrats during the 1998 Impeachment hearings.

Jordan spent the next two election cycles at the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, where he served as communications director, political director and eventually as executive director.

Jordan directed John Kerry&#x27;s political operation for more than five years. This included the lead up to Kerry&#x27;s 2004 presidential bid, which Jordan managed until November 2003 when he was replaced by Mary Beth Cahill.

==Thunder Road Group==
After leaving the Kerry campaign, Jordan founded The Thunder Road Group, a public relations firm.

During the 2008 cycle, he managed the DSCC&#x27;s Independent Expenditure program and served as a consultant for Senator Chris Dodd’s failed presidential run. Jordan signed on with Dodd after working for Governor Mark Warner, who ultimately decided against a bid for the White House.

Jordan spent the 2010 cycle working with Democratic media firm Shorr Johnson Magnus.

<text>The Beach Abort was an uncrewed test in NASA&#x27;s Project Mercury, of the Mercury spacecraft Launch Escape System. Objectives of the test were a performance evaluation of the escape system, the parachute and landing system, and recovery operations in an off-the-pad abort situation. The test took place at NASA&#x27;s Wallops Island, Virginia, test facility on May 9, 1960. In the test, the Mercury spacecraft and its Launch Escape System were fired from ground level. The flight lasted a total of 1 minute, 16 seconds. The spacecraft reached an apogee of and splashed down in the ocean with a range of .Top speed was a velocity of . A Marine Corps helicopter recovered the spacecraft 17 minutes after launch. The test was considered a success, although there was insufficient separation distance when the tower jettisoned. Mercury Spacecraft #1, the first spacecraft off McDonnell&#x27;s production line, was used in this test. Total payload weight was .

Mercury Spacecraft #1 is displayed at the New York Hall of Science, Corona Park, NY. It is displayed indoors, suspended from the ceiling, with an escape tower of unknown provenance attached.

<text>In mathematics, and more specifically in projective geometry, a projective frame or projective basis is a tuple of points in a projective space that can be used for defining homogeneous coordinates in this space. More precisely, in a projective space of dimension , a projective frame is a -tuple of points such that no hyperplane contains of them. A projective frame is sometimes called a simplex, although a simplex in a space of dimension has at most vertices.

In this article, only projective spaces over a field are considered, although most results can be generalized to projective spaces over a division ring. 

Let be a projective space of dimension , where is a -vector space of dimension . Let formula_1 be the canonical projection that maps a nonzero vector to the corresponding point of , which is the vector line that contains .

Every frame of can be written as formula_2 for some vectors formula_3 of . The definition implies the existence of nonzero elements of such that formula_4. Replacing formula_5 by formula_6 for formula_7 and formula_8 by formula_9, one gets the following characterization of a frame:
: points of form a frame if and only if they are the image by of a basis of and the sum of its elements. 
Moreover, two bases define the same frame in this way, if and only if the elements of the second one are the products of the elements of the first one by a fixed nonzero element of .

As homographies of are induced by linear endomorphisms of , it follows that, given two frames, there is exactly one homography mapping the first one onto the second one. In particular, the only homography fixing the points of a frame is the identity map. This result is much more difficult in synthetic geometry (where projective spaces are defined through axioms). It is sometimes called the &quot;first fundamental theorem of projective geometry&quot;.
Every frame can be written as formula_10 where formula_11 is basis of . The &quot;projective coordinates&quot; or homogeneous coordinates of a point over this frame are the coordinates of the vector on the basis formula_12 If one changes the vectors representing the point and the frame elements, the coordinates are multiplied by a fixed nonzero scalar.

Commonly, the projective space is considered. It has a &quot;canonical frame&quot; consisting of the image by of the canonical basis of (consisting of the elements having only one nonzero entry, which is equal to 1), and . On this basis, the homogeneous coordinates of are simply the entries (coefficients) of . 

Given another projective space of the same dimension , and a frame of it, there is exactly one homography mapping onto the canonical frame of . The projective coordinates of a point on the frame are the homogeneous coordinates of on the canonical frame of .

In the case of a projective line, a frame consists of three distinct points. If is identified with with a point at infinity added, then its canonical frame is . Given any frame ), the projective coordinates of a point are , where is the cross-ratio . If , the cross ratio is the infinity, and the projective coordinates are .

<text>Albert Jay Nock (October 13, 1870 – August 19, 1945) was an American libertarian author, editor first of &quot;The Nation&quot; and then &quot;The Freeman&quot;, educational theorist, Georgist, and social critic of the early and middle 20th century. He was an outspoken opponent of the New Deal, and served as a fundamental inspiration for the modern libertarian and conservative movements, cited as an influence by William F. Buckley Jr. He was one of the first Americans to self-identify as &quot;libertarian&quot;. His best-known books are &quot;Memoirs of a Superfluous Man&quot; and &quot;Our Enemy, the State&quot;.

==Life and work==
Throughout his life, Nock was a deeply private man who shared few of the details of his personal life with his working partners. He was born in Scranton, Pennsylvania, the son of Emma Sheldon Jay and Joseph Albert Nock, who was both a steelworker and an Episcopal priest. He was raised in Brooklyn, New York. Nock attended St. Stephen&#x27;s College (now known as Bard College) from 1884 to 1888, where he joined Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity.

After graduation he had a brief career playing minor league baseball, and then attended a theological seminary and was ordained as an Episcopal priest in 1897. Nock married Agnes Grumbine in 1900 and the couple had two children, Francis and Samuel (both of whom became college professors). In 1909, Nock left the ministry as well as his wife and children, and became a journalist.

In 1914, Nock joined the staff of &quot;The Nation&quot; magazine, which at the time was more aligned with liberal capitalism. Nock was an acquaintance of the influential politician and orator William Jennings Bryan, and in 1915 traveled to Europe on a special assignment for Bryan, who was then Secretary of State. Nock also maintained friendships with many of the leading proponents of the Georgist movement.

However, while Nock was a lifelong admirer of Henry George, he was frequently at odds with other Georgists in the left-leaning movement. Further, Nock was influenced by the anti-collectivist writings of the German sociologist Franz Oppenheimer, whose most famous work, &quot;Der Staat&quot;, was published in English translation in 1915. In his own writings, Nock would later build on Oppenheimer&#x27;s claim that the pursuit of human ends can be divided into two forms: the productive or economic means, and the parasitic, political means.

Between 1920 and 1924, Nock was the co-editor of &quot;The Freeman&quot;. &quot;The Freeman&quot; was initially conceived as a vehicle for the single tax movement. It was financed by the wealthy wife of the magazine&#x27;s other editor, Francis Neilson, although neither Nock nor Neilson was a dedicated single taxer. Contributors to &quot;The Freeman&quot; included: Charles A. Beard, William Henry Chamberlin, Thomas Mann, Lewis Mumford, Bertrand Russell, Lincoln Steffens, Louis Untermeyer, Thorstein Veblen and Suzanne La Follette, the more libertarian cousin of Senator Robert M. La Follette. Critic H.L. Mencken wrote:
When the unprofitable &quot;The Freeman&quot; ceased publication in 1924, Nock became a freelance journalist in New York City and Brussels, Belgium.

&quot;The Myth of a Guilty Nation&quot;, which came out in 1922, was Albert Jay Nock&#x27;s first anti-war book, a cause he backed his entire life as an essential component of a libertarian outlook. The burden of the book is to prove American war propaganda to be false. The purpose of World War I, according to Nock, was not to liberate Europe and the world from German imperialism and threats. If there was a conspiracy, it was by the allied powers to broadcast a public message that was completely contradicted by its own diplomatic cables. Along with that came war propaganda designed to make Germany into a devil nation.

In the mid-1920s, a small group of wealthy American admirers funded Nock&#x27;s literary and historical work to enable him to follow his own interests. Shortly thereafter, he published his biography of Thomas Jefferson. When &quot;Jefferson&quot; was published in 1928, Mencken praised it as &quot;the work of a subtle and highly dexterous craftsman&quot; which cleared &quot;off the vast mountain of doctrinaire rubbish that has risen above Jefferson&#x27;s bones and also provides a clear and comprehensive account of the Jeffersonian system&quot;, and the &quot;essence of it is that Jefferson divided all mankind into two classes, the producers and the exploiters, and he was for the former first, last and all the time.&quot; Mencken also thought the book to be accurate, shrewd, well-ordered and charming.

In his two 1932 books, &quot;On the Disadvantages of Being Educated and Other Essays&quot; and &quot;Theory of Education in the United States&quot;, Nock launched a scathing critique of modern government-run education.

In his 1936 article &quot;Isaiah&#x27;s Job&quot;, which appeared in &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot; and was reprinted in pamphlet form in July 1962 by The Foundation for Economic Education, Nock expressed his complete disillusionment with the idea of reforming the current system. Believing that it would be impossible to persuade any large portion of the general population of the correct course and opposing any suggestion of a violent revolution, Nock instead argued that libertarians should focus on nurturing what he called &quot;the Remnant&quot;.

The Remnant, according to Nock, consisted of a small minority who understood the nature of the state and society, and who would become influential only after the current dangerous course had become thoroughly and obviously untenable, a situation which might not occur until far into the future. Nock&#x27;s philosophy of the Remnant was influenced by the deep pessimism and elitism that social critic Ralph Adams Cram expressed in a 1932 essay, &quot;Why We Do Not Behave Like Human Beings&quot;. In his &quot;Memoirs of a Superfluous Man&quot;, Nock makes no secret that his educators:

In 1941, Nock published a two-part essay in &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot; titled &quot;The Jewish Problem in America&quot;. The articles were part of a multi-author series, assembled by the editors in response to recent anti-Semitic unrest in Brooklyn and elsewhere &quot;in the hope that a free and forthright debate will reduce the pressure, now dangerously high, and leave us with a healthier understanding of the human elements involved.&quot;

Nock&#x27;s argument was that the Jews were an Oriental people, acceptable to the &quot;intelligent Occidental&quot; yet forever strangers to &quot;the Occidental mass-man.&quot; Furthermore, the mass-man &quot;is inclined to be more resentful of the Oriental as a competitor than of another Occidental&quot;; the American masses are &quot;the great rope and lamppost artists of the world&quot;; and in studying Jewish history, &quot;one is struck with the fact that persecutions never have originated in an upper class movement&quot;. This innate hostility of the masses, he concluded, might be exploited by a scapegoating state to distract from &quot;any shocks of an economic dislocation that may occur in the years ahead.&quot; He concluded, &quot;If I keep up my family&#x27;s record of longevity, I think it is not impossible that I shall live to see the Nuremberg laws reenacted in this country and enforced with vigor&quot; and affirmed that the consequences of such a pogrom &quot;would be as appalling in their extent and magnitude as anything seen since the Middle Ages.&quot;

The articles were themselves declared by some commentators to be anti-Semitic, and Nock was never asked to write another article, effectively ending his career as a social critic. Against charges of anti-Semitism, Nock answered, &quot;Someone asked me years ago if it were true that I disliked Jews, and I replied that it was certainly true, not at all because they are Jews but because they are folks, and I don&#x27;t like folks.&quot;

In 1943, two years before his death, Nock published his autobiography, &quot;Memoirs of a Superfluous Man&quot;, the title of which expressed the degree of Nock&#x27;s disillusionment and alienation from current social trends. After the publication of this autobiography, Nock was a frequent guest at the Sharon, Connecticut house of oilman William F. Buckley Sr., whose son, William F. Buckley Jr., would later become an influential author and speaker.

Nock died of leukemia in 1945, at the Wakefield, Rhode Island home of his longtime friend, Ruth Robinson, the illustrator of his 1934 book, &quot;A Journey into Rabelais&#x27; France&quot;. He is buried in Riverside Cemetery, in Wakefield.

== Thought ==

Describing himself as a philosophical anarchist, Nock called for a radical vision of society free from the influence of the political state. He described the state as that which &quot;claims and exercises the monopoly of crime&quot;. He opposed centralization, regulation, the income tax, and mandatory education, along with what he saw as the degradation of society. He denounced in equal terms all forms of totalitarianism, including &quot;Bolshevism... Fascism, Nazism, Marxism, [and] Communism&quot; but also harshly criticized democracy. Instead, Nock argued, &quot;The practical reason for freedom is that freedom seems to be the only condition under which any kind of substantial moral fiber can be developed. Everything else has been tried, world without end. Going dead against reason and experience, we have tried law, compulsion and authoritarianism of various kinds, and the result is nothing to be proud of.&quot;

During the 1930s, Nock was one of the most consistent critics of Franklin Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal programs. In &quot;Our Enemy, the State&quot;, Nock argued that the New Deal was merely a pretext for the federal government to increase its control over society. He was dismayed that the president had gathered unprecedented power in his own hands and called this development an out-and-out coup d&#x27;état. Nock criticized those who believed that the new regimentation of the economy was temporary, arguing that it would prove a permanent shift. He believed that the inflationary monetary policy of the Republican administrations of the 1920s was responsible for the onset of the Great Depression and that the New Deal was responsible for perpetuating it.

Nock was also a passionate opponent of war, and what he considered the US government&#x27;s aggressive foreign policy. He believed that war could bring out only the worst in society and argued that it led inevitably to collectivization and militarization and &quot;fortified a universal faith in violence; it set in motion endless adventures in imperialism, endless nationalist ambitions&quot;, while, at the same time, costing countless human lives. During the First World War, Nock wrote for &quot;The Nation&quot;, which was censored by the Wilson administration for opposing the war.

Despite his distaste for communism, Nock harshly criticized the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War following the parliamentary revolution and Bolshevik coup in that country. Before the Second World War, Nock wrote a series of articles deploring what he saw as Roosevelt&#x27;s gamesmanship and interventionism leading inevitably to US involvement. Nock was one of the few who maintained a principled opposition to the war throughout its course.

Despite becoming considerably more obscure in death than he had been in life, Nock was an important influence on the next generation of laissez-faire capitalist American thinkers, including libertarians such as Murray Rothbard, Frank Chodorov, and Leonard Read, and conservatives such as William F. Buckley Jr. Nock&#x27;s conservative view of society would help inspire the paleoconservative movement in response to the development of neoconservatism during the Cold War. In insisting on the state itself as the root problem, Nock&#x27;s thought was one of the main precursors to anarcho-capitalism.

==Anti-Semitism and disillusionment with democracy==
When Albert Jay Nock started &quot;The Freeman&quot; magazine in 1920, &quot;The Nation&quot; offered its congratulations to a new voice in liberal journalism. Nock rebuffed the gesture in a letter to the magazine&#x27;s owner, Oswald Villard, in which he wrote, &quot;I hate to seem ungrateful, but we haint liberal. We loathes liberalism and loathes it hard&quot;, identifying himself with Radicalism. Nock professed allegiance to a detached philosophical objectivity, expressed in his Platonist credo of &quot;seeing things as they are&quot;. He had decried anti-Semitism in his earlier writings, but in his sixties he began giving vent to increasingly anti-Semitic and anti-democratic sentiments, leading Robert Sherrill, writing years later in &quot;The Nation&quot;, to call him &quot;virulently anti-Semitic&quot; and &quot;anti-democratic&quot;.

The historian and biographer, Michael Wreszin, compared Nock&#x27;s disillusionment with democracy and his attacks on the Jewish people to similar feelings held by Henry Adams. Before he died, Nock destroyed all his notes and papers, except a few letters and an autobiographical manuscript published posthumously as &quot;Journal of Forgotten Days&quot; (Nock was so secretive about the details of his personal life that &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot; could not find out his birthdate).

In &quot;Journal of Forgotten Days&quot;, Nock wrote these passages about the Jews of New York City:

Nock took a jaundiced view of American politics and of American democracy itself, and asserted that in all his life he voted in only one presidential election, in which he cast a write-in vote for Jefferson Davis. In an article he wrote for &quot;The American Mercury&quot; magazine in 1933 entitled &quot;What the American Votes For&quot;, Nock claimed, &quot;My first and only presidential vote was cast many, many years ago. It was dictated by pure instinct.&quot;

In &quot;Memoirs of a Superfluous Man&quot; (1943), Nock had this to say about mass democracy in America:

The author Clifton Fadiman, reviewing &quot;Memoirs of a Superfluous Man&quot;, wrote: &quot;I have not since the days of the early Mencken read a more eloquently written blast against democracy or enjoyed more fully a display of crusted prejudice. Mr. Nock is a highly civilized man who does not like our civilization and will have no part of it.&quot; Nock&#x27;s biographer Michael Wreszin wrote concerning Nock&#x27;s reaction to the election of Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1932: &quot;Sailing to Brussels in February 1933, before Roosevelt&#x27;s inauguration in March, he repeated in a journal his appreciation of Catherine Wilson&#x27;s observation that the skyline of New York was the finest sight in America when viewed from the deck of an outbound steamer.&quot;

==In popular culture==
In the fictional &quot;The Probability Broach&quot; by L. Neil Smith, as part of the North American Confederacy Series, in which the United States becomes a Libertarian state after a successful Whiskey Rebellion and the overthrow and execution of George Washington by firing squad for treason in 1794, Albert Jay Nock serves as the 18th President of the North American Confederacy from 1912 to 1928.

<doc id="763919" wikidata="Q5326690" url="?curid=763919" title="Early Modern English Bible translations">
<text>Early Modern English Bible translations are those translations of the Bible which were made between about 1500 and 1800, the period of Early Modern English. This was the first major period of Bible translation into the English language including the King James Version and Douai Bibles. The Reformation and Counter-Reformation led to the need for Bibles in the vernacular with competing groups each producing their own versions.

Although Wycliffe&#x27;s Bible had preceded the Protestant Reformation, England was actually one of the last countries in Europe to have a printed vernacular Bible. There were several reasons for this. One was that Henry VIII wanted to avoid the propagation of heresies—a concern subsequently justified by the marginal notes printed in Tyndale&#x27;s New Testament and the Geneva Bible, for example. Another was the Roman Catholic doctrine of Magisterium which describes the Church as the final authority in the interpretation of the Scriptures; in the volatile years of the Reformation, it was not felt that encouraging private Scriptural interpretation, and thereby possible heresy, would be helpful.

Several of the early printed English Bibles were suppressed, at least temporarily. Henry VIII complained about Tyndale&#x27;s &quot;pestilent glosses&quot;, and only tolerated the Coverdale and Matthew Bibles because the publishers carefully omitted any mention of Tyndale&#x27;s involvement in them. Later, the &quot;authorized&quot; Great Bible of 1539 was suppressed under Mary I because of her Roman Catholic beliefs.

==Process of publication==
In this period the roles of printer and publisher were not necessarily as now, and the accuracy of the information given on title pages cannot be relied on. The person named as translator might at most be an editor, since all Bible versions depended heavily on Tyndale&#x27;s and/or Coverdale&#x27;s work. Printers and others involved in the publication sometimes worked under pseudonyms. Dates and places of publication might also be given incorrectly.

Identification of a particular Bible as belonging to a specific edition is complicated by the flexibility of the whole production process at the time. The text, being set in movable type, could be corrected or changed in the middle of a print run; thus copies of a given edition may differ on some pages. Also, at the binding stage, a title page from one edition might be combined with text from another edition. The exact origins of a Bible can therefore only be determined by detailed examination of the text. Print runs for early Bibles were relatively short by present-day standards; typically perhaps 1000 to 2500 copies.

Editions printed in England required a royal licence. Later the printing of Bibles in England became a monopoly shared between the Oxford University Press, the Cambridge University Press and the &quot;King&#x27;s Printers&quot;. This situation continued into the 20th century, at which time Eyre and Spottiswoode were the King&#x27;s Printers.

Printers&#x27; errors inevitably escaped detection in some editions. Perhaps the most famous faulty edition is the so-called &quot;Wicked Bible&quot;, a 1631 printing of the King James version (Herbert #444) in which Exod. 20:14 read: &quot;Thou shalt commit adultery.&quot; For this the printer, Robert Barker, was fined heavily. Of the 1000 copies of the &quot;Wicked Bible&quot; only 11 survive.

==Versions==
The nine versions summarized below are dealt with in separate articles. With the exception of Tyndale&#x27;s Bible, all are complete Bibles, although usually the New Testament was also issued separately. The Apocrypha were normally included in Bibles of the Reformation period, although sometimes omitted if the book was subsequently re-bound. Psalters and prayer-books were often bound with the Bible.

In addition, there are a number of other translations of individual books. For example, George Joye&#x27;s Protestant translations of the Psalms (1530), Isaiah (1531), Proverbs (1533), Ecclesiastes (1533), Jeremiah (1534) and Lamentations (1534), all executed in Antwerp, were the first printed English translations of these biblical books.

===Tyndale&#x27;s Bible===
William Tyndale was a scholar who graduated at Oxford, was a student in Cambridge when Martin Luther posted his theses at Wittenberg and was troubled by the problems within the Church. In 1523, taking advantage of the recent invention of the printing press, Tyndale began to cast the Scriptures into English. His aims were simple but ambitious (as expressed to an educated man): &quot;I defy the Pope and all his laws: and if God spare my life, ere many years I will cause a boy that driveth the plough shall know more of the Scriptures than thou dost.&quot; Within his lifetime, only his New Testament and part of his Old Testament were published.

He set out to London fully expecting to find support and encouragement there, but he found neither. He found, as he once said, that there was no room in the palace of the Bishop of London to translate the New Testament; indeed, that there was no place to do it in all England. A wealthy London merchant subsidized him with the gift of ten pounds, with which he went across the Channel to Hamburg; and there and elsewhere on the Continent, where he could be hid and where printing facilities were more accessible than in England, he brought his translation to completion. Tyndale was compelled to flee at one time with a few printed sheets and complete his work on another press. Several times copies of his books were solemnly burned, and his own life was frequently in danger; he was eventually executed for his work.

The Church had objected to Tyndale&#x27;s translations because offensive notes (the &quot;pestilent glosses&quot;) and, in their belief, deliberate mistranslations had been included in the works in order to promote anticlericalism and heretical views. It is for this reason that Tyndale&#x27;s earliest editions were so vigorously suppressed that few copies have survived.

There is one story that tells how money came to free Tyndale from heavy debt and prepare the way for more Bibles. The Bishop of London, Cuthbert Tunstall, was set on destroying copies of the English New Testament. He therefore made a bargain with a merchant of Antwerp, to secure them for him. The merchant was a friend of Tyndale, and went to him to tell him he had a customer for his Bibles, The Bishop of London. Tyndale agreed to give the merchant the Bibles to pay his debt and finance new editions of the Bible.

Ironically, Tyndale&#x27;s was perhaps the most influential single translation of the Bible ever made into English. Several immediately subsequent publications, among them the Matthews and Great Bibles, relied heavily on Tyndale&#x27;s wording while softening his radical Protestantism. The original 1611 version of the King James New Testament is reckoned to be nearly 90% unaltered Tyndale. &#x27;A complete analysis of the Authorised Version, known down the generations as &quot;the AV&quot; or the &quot;King James&quot;, was made in 1998. It shows that Tyndale&#x27;s words account for 84 per cent of the New Testament, and for 75.8 per cent of the Old Testament books that he translated.&#x27;

===Coverdale&#x27;s Bible===
The first complete printed translation into English, and the first complete translation into Modern English, was compiled by Myles Coverdale and published in 1535. It was much influenced by Tyndale: Coverdale took Tyndale&#x27;s New Testament and the published portions of his Old Testament, and translated the remainder of the Old Testament himself from Latin and German versions.

===Matthew&#x27;s Bible===
Matthew&#x27;s Bible was produced by John Rodgers, working under the pseudonym &quot;Thomas Matthew&quot; for safety, in 1537. It was based on Tyndale&#x27;s previously published editions with the addition of his unpublished Old Testament material. The remainder used Coverdale&#x27;s translation. It received the approval of Henry VIII.

===Taverner&#x27;s Bible===
Taverner&#x27;s Bible is a minor revision of Matthew&#x27;s Bible edited by Richard Taverner and published in 1539.

===&quot;Great Bible&quot;===
There appeared what is known as the Great Bible in 1539, also compiled by Myles Coverdale. The Great Bible was issued to meet a decree that each church should make available in some convenient place the largest possible copy of the whole Bible, where all the parishioners could have access to it and read it at their will.

The version gets its name from the size of the volume. That decree dates 1538, twelve years after Tyndale&#x27;s books were burned, and two years after he was burned. The installation of these great books caused tremendous excitement as crowds gathered everywhere. Bishop Bonner had six copies of the great volume located throughout St. Paul&#x27;s. The Great Bible appeared in seven editions in two years, and continued in recognized power for thirty years. Much of the present English prayer-book is taken from it.

But this liberty was so sudden that the people naturally abused it. King Henry VIII became vexed because the sacred words &quot;were disputed, rimed, sung, and jangled in every ale-house&quot;. King Henry began to put restrictions on the use of the Bible. There were to be no notes or annotations in any versions, and those that existed were to be blacked out. Only the upper classes were to be allowed to possess a Bible. Finally, the year before his death, all versions were again prohibited except the Great Bible, whose cost and size precluded personal use. The decree led to another great burning of Bibles in 1546—Tyndale, Coverdale, Matthew—all but the Great Bible. The leading religious reformers took flight and fled to European Protestant towns like Frankfurt and Strassburg.

Under Edward VI, the regency cast off all restrictions on translation and publication of the Bible; all the suppressed versions were republished. The order for a Great Bible in every church was renewed, and there was to be added to it a copy of Erasmus&#x27;s paraphrase of the four gospels, in an English translation undertaken in part by Princess Mary, the King&#x27;s Catholic sister. Nearly fifty editions of the Bible, in whole or in part, appeared in those six years. When Mary herself succeeded to the throne in 1553, she maintained her brother&#x27;s policy of encouraging public reading of the Great Bible and Paraphrases; but versions with overtly Protestant notes were once again liable to be burned.

===&quot;Geneva Bible&quot;===
Queen Mary temporarily restored the Church of England to allegiance to Rome. The secret use of Reformed translations of the Bible began again, despite official efforts to restore England to Roman Catholic unity. The only Bible translation published during Mary&#x27;s reign was the &quot;Whittingham New Testament&quot; of 1557 printed in Geneva (Herbert #106). English scholarship was driven into exile, and found its way to Frankfurt and Geneva again. There the spirit of scholarship was untrammeled. They found material for scholarly study of the Bible, and there they made and published a new version of the Bible in English, the &quot;Geneva Bible&quot;. During Elizabeth&#x27;s reign sixty editions of it appeared.

The &quot;Geneva Bible&quot; was first published in 1560 (Herbert #107). It made several changes: for one, the Geneva edition was the first to show the division into verses. The chapter division was made three centuries earlier, but the verses belong to the Genevan version, and are meant to make the book suitable for responsive use and for reader reference. They were taken in large part from the work of Stephanus (Robert Estienne of Paris), who had divided the Greek Testament into verses in 1551, during a journey which he was compelled to make between Paris and Lyon.

The Geneva version was printed both in Roman type and in the older typeface, black letter. It had full &quot;notes on hard passages&quot;, some of which eventually proved controversial to King James and were thus a prompt to a new translation; the King James version. The work itself was completed after the accession of Elizabeth, when most of the religious leaders had returned to England from their exile under Mary.

The &quot;Geneva Bible&quot; was compiled by William Whittingham, who had succeeded John Knox as pastor of the English congregation at Geneva, Switzerland. Whittingham was married to John Calvin&#x27;s sister and the translation was viewed as too Calvinist by the Church of England.

===&quot;Bishops&#x27; Bible&quot;===
During the reign of Elizabeth I of England it was found that two versions of the Bible were in common use, the old &quot;Great Bible&quot; and the new &quot;Geneva Bible&quot;. There could be no way of gaining approval for the Geneva Bible. For one thing, John Knox had been a party to its preparation; so had Calvin. The Queen and many of the bishops detested them both, especially Knox. For another thing, its notes were not favorable to royal sovereignty. Finally, it had been made in a foreign land and was under suspicion on that account.

The result was that Elizabeth&#x27;s Archbishop of Canterbury, Matthew Parker, set out to have another official version made. He selected a revision committee, with instructions to follow closely wherever possible the &quot;Great Bible&quot;, to avoid contentious notes and to make such a version that it might be freely, easily and naturally read. The result is known as the &quot;Bishops&#x27; Bible&quot;. It was issued in Elizabeth&#x27;s tenth year (1568), but there is no record that she ever noticed it, though Parker sent her a copy from his sick-bed. Its publication (as a complete Bible) ceased before the first issue of the new official (though not formally &quot;authorized&quot;) version, the &quot;King James Version&quot; of 1611.

===Douay–Rheims Version===
The Douai (or Douay) version was the work of English Roman Catholic scholars connected with the University of Douai in France. The New Testament was issued at Rheims in 1582, and the Old Testament in two volumes, in 1609 and 1610, just before the King James version. It is made, not from the Hebrew and the Greek, though it refers to both, but from the Latin Vulgate. The result is that the Old Testament of the Douai version is a translation into English from the Latin, which in turn is, mostly, a translation from the Hebrew. Yet scholars are scholars, and it shows some influence of the Genevan version; and, indeed, of other English versions, especially that of Myles Coverdale. Its notes were strongly anti-Protestant, and in its preface it explains its existence by saying that Protestants have been guilty of &quot;casting the holy to dogs and pearls to hogs.&quot;

The version&#x27;s English was not colloquial, but ecclesiastical and highly latinate. In Hebrews 13:17, the version reads, &quot;Obey your prelates and be subject unto them.&quot; In Luke 3:3, John came &quot;preaching the baptism of penance.&quot; In Psalm xxiii:5, where the King James Version reads, &quot;My cup runneth over&quot;, the Douai version, taking its cue from the Greek Septuagint, reads, &quot;My chalice which inebriateth me, how goodly it is.&quot; There is a retention of ecclesiastical terms, and an explanation of the passages on which Protestants tended to differ rather sharply from Roman Catholics, as in the matter of the taking of the cup by the people, and elsewhere. In 1589, the Protestant scholar William Fulke issued a point by point refutation of the notes of the Rheims New Testament, in which he also printed the biblical text both of Rheims and of the Bishop&#x27;s Bible in parallel columns. This work, which sold very widely, had the consequence of making the Rheims New Testament much more accessible than would otherwise have been the case.

The Douai translation was updated in 1750 by Bishop Challoner and while it continued to be known as the Douai version, many consider it to be equivalent to a separate translation. In various updates, this version remained the standard Catholic English-language Bible until 1941.

===King James Version===

The King James Version (KJV), or Authorized Version is an English translation of the Holy Bible, commissioned for the Church of England at the behest of James I of England. First published in 1611, it has had a profound impact not only on most English translations that have followed it, but also on English literature as a whole.

The King James Version was first published in 1611 as a complete Bible (Herbert #309) and a New Testament (Herbert #310). Translated by 47 translators using the widest range of source texts, it became known as the &quot;Authorized Version&quot; in England and is the most widely used of the Early Modern English Bible translations. Its use has continued in some traditions up to the present. Even though modern scholarship continues to claim problems with some of the translation, it is widely admired for its style and use of language.

The edition of the King James Bible found in modern printings is not that of the 1611 edition, but rather an edition extensively modernised in 1769 (to the standards of the mid-18th Century) by Benjamin Blayney for the Oxford University Press.

<text>Propagandhi is a Canadian punk rock band formed in Portage la Prairie, Manitoba in 1986 by guitarist Chris Hannah and drummer Jord Samolesky. The band is currently located in Winnipeg, Manitoba and completed by bassist Todd Kowalski and guitarist Sulynn Hago.

While their earlier work was aligned with the punk rock and skate punk tradition, in later years Propagandhi records have moved towards a heavier and more technical heavy metal-influenced sound. Both in their lyrics and hands-on activism, the band&#x27;s members champion various left wing and anarchist causes and veganism, and have taken a vocal stance against human rights violations, sexism, racism, nationalism, homophobia, imperialism, capitalism and organized religion.

==History==
===Formation, first two records (1986–1997)===
In 1986, Samolesky and Hannah recruited original bassist Scott Hopper via a &quot;progressive thrash band looking for bass player&quot; flyer posted in a local record shop. Hopper was replaced three years later by Mike Braumeister, which completed the first lineup to perform live. After the band established itself through several demos and larger shows, including one with Fugazi, Braumeister moved to Vancouver, and John K. Samson became the band&#x27;s third bassist.

In 1992, Propagandhi played a show with California punk rock band NOFX and included in their set a cover version of Cheap Trick&#x27;s &quot;I Want You to Want Me&quot;. Impressed by their performance, NOFX front man Fat Mike signed them to his independent record label Fat Wreck Chords. The band later accompanied him to Los Angeles, where they recorded their debut album, &quot;How to Clean Everything&quot;, released in 1993. The band spent the next three years touring and issuing several smaller releases, including the &quot;How to Clean a Couple o&#x27; Things&quot; single on Fat Wreck Chords, a split 10-inch record with I Spy, a split 7-inch with F.Y.P, and the double 7-inch &quot;Where Quality is Job #1&quot;, the latter three on Recess Records.

In 1996, they recorded and released their second album, &quot;Less Talk, More Rock&quot;, via Fat Wreck Chords. The title was ironic, as they had become well known for lengthy song explanations and speeches during live performances. The album was more politicized than its predecessor, with such song titles as &quot;Apparently, I&#x27;m a &#x27;P.C. Fascist&#x27; (Because I Care About Both Human and Non-Human Animals)&quot;, &quot;Nailing Descartes to the Wall/(Liquid) Meat Is &quot;Still&quot; Murder&quot;, and &quot;... And We Thought Nation-States Were a Bad Idea&quot;. Ramsey Kanaan, founder of the anarchist publishing company AK Press, appears on &quot;A Public Dis-Service Announcement from Shell&quot; as the voice of the petroleum multinational. Partial proceeds of the album were donated to AK and other activist groups. &quot;Less Talk, More Rock&quot; caused some controversy at the time of its release due to the band&#x27;s pro feminism and &quot;gay positive&quot; stance which, according to Hannah, clashed with the sexist and homophobic culture of the West Coast punk rock scene with which the band had become associated.

===&quot;Today&#x27;s Empires, Tomorrow&#x27;s Ashes&quot; (1997–2005)===
After &quot;Less Talk, More Rock&quot;″s release, Samson departed and formed The Weakerthans. Hannah&#x27;s then-roommate Todd Kowalski, formerly of Propagandhi&#x27;s touring mates I Spy and the political grindcore band Swallowing Shit, replaced him. Hannah and Samolesky also founded the record label G7 Welcoming Committee Records, which also released The Weakerthans&#x27; first album. The label structured itself around the participatory economic proposals of Robin Hahnel and Michael Albert. The band issued &quot;Where Quantity Is Job #1&quot;, a collection of EP and compilation tracks, demos, and live songs.

In 2001, Propagandhi released their third album, &quot;Today&#x27;s Empires, Tomorrow&#x27;s Ashes&quot;. The album was considered by some to be a major departure from their previous works. The song titles and lyrics of &quot;Today&#x27;s Empires, Tomorrow&#x27;s Ashes&quot; furthered the sphere of their political views, bolstered by the addition of Kowalski&#x27;s aggressive songwriting and an increased density of guitar lines. The album includes enhanced content, with political videos and essays concerning such topics as COINTELPRO and the Black Panther Party.

===&quot;Potemkin City Limits&quot;, expansion to four-piece (2005–2008)===

Propagandhi released the album &quot;Potemkin City Limits&quot; on October 18, 2005. Like its predecessor, the album features multimedia content, with a number of PDF files on topics such as participatory economics and veganism, and links to websites of organizations that Propagandhi support. The album&#x27;s opening track, &quot;A Speculative Fiction&quot;, won the 2006 SOCAN Songwriting Prize by online vote. Propagandhi pledged to use the $5000 prize to make donations to the Haiti Action Network and The Welcome Place, an organization in Winnipeg for which they&#x27;d previously done volunteer work which helps refugees start new lives in Manitoba.

Hannah briefly adopted the pseudonym Glen Lambert in the run-up to and immediate aftermath of the release of &quot;Potemkin City Limits&quot;, causing confusion among some fans, reviewers, and commentators; the band concluded the prank by announcing on 14 August 2006 that Glen Lambert had been dismissed and would be replaced by &quot;former&quot; member Chris Hannah. This coincided with the addition of second guitarist David Guillas, marking the band&#x27;s first four-piece lineup in their then-twenty year career. Guillas, nicknamed &quot;The Beaver&quot;, was a former member of two Winnipeg-based rock outfits, Giant Sons and Rough Music. Hannah had previously stated that he had been a fan of, and influenced by, Guillas&#x27; work in Giant Sons.

In 2007, the band released a DVD entitled &quot;Live from Occupied Territory&quot;, which features a recording of their set at The Zoo in Winnipeg on July 19, 2003. Proceeds of the DVD benefit the Grassy Narrows road blockade and the Middle East Children&#x27;s Alliance. Included on the DVD are two full-length documentaries: &quot;Peace, Propaganda and the Promised Land&quot;, and &quot;As Long as the Rivers Flow&quot;.

===&quot;Supporting Caste&quot;, &quot;Failed States&quot; (2008–2015)===
The band spent the following years working on their fifth record, &quot;Supporting Caste&quot;. During the recording sessions, Hannah stated that to his ears the record &quot;resemble[d] a nuclear-powered space-age composite of &quot;Potemkin City Limits&quot;, &quot;Less Talk More Rock&quot;, Giant Son&#x27;s &quot;Anthology&quot; and a carefully measured dose of &quot;Today&#x27;s Empires Tomorrow&#x27;s Ashes&quot;&quot;. The band created a web page giving fans an option to receive two high-quality songs from the album before its release by donating $1 to $10 to one of three activist organizations which they supported. The page also linked to various pre-orders of the album. It was officially released on 10 March 2009.

The digital &quot;Recovered EP&quot; followed on 6 April 2010. It featured old recordings from the &quot;How To Clean Everything&quot; and &quot;Less Talk, More Rock&quot; eras, remastered and with new parts recorded by Hannah. A split 7-inch with Sacrifice followed that December, featuring Propagandhi covering Corrosion of Conformity. In collaboration with their friends and fellow musicians from Sheet Happens Publishing and Protest the Hero, Propagandhi also released a tablature transcription of &quot;Supporting Caste&quot; for guitar and bass in early 2012.

The group began plans for a new record shortly after completing &quot;Supporting Caste&quot;. After several years&#x27; work and pre-release snippets offered through various Internet outlets, &quot;Failed States&quot;, their sixth studio album, was released on 4 September 2012 through Epitaph Records. Early reviews were generally positive: &quot;Revolver&quot; praised the record&#x27;s musical and lyrical accomplishment, while &quot;Exclaim!&quot; identified its improvements upon the standards set by the band&#x27;s recent work. In October 2012, the release of the &quot;Failed States&quot; tab book was announced.

===&quot;Victory Lap&quot; (2015–present)===
David Guillas has not been part of the touring lineup as of September 2015, and the band soon after recruited Floridian musician, Sulynn Hago, as their new touring guitarist. On May 10, 2017, the band announced on their Facebook page that a new studio album has been recorded, ready for release in or after Summer 2017. On July 17, 2017, Propagandhi announced that their new album, &quot;Victory Lap&quot;, would be released on September 29 through Epitaph Records. The announcement was followed by the release of the title track. In that album, Sulynn Hago was credited as a band member and David Guillas a &quot;Propagandhi alumnus&quot; who had contributed additional guitar parts.

<text>Brecon Beacons National Park, officially named Bannau Brycheiniog National Park (), is a national park in Wales. It is named after the Brecon Beacons (), the mountain range at its centre. The national park includes the highest mountain in South Wales, Pen y Fan, which has an elevation of . 

The national park has a total area of . The Brecon Beacons and Fforest Fawr uplands form the central section of the park. To the east are the Black Mountains, which extend beyond the national park boundary into England, and to the west is the similarly named but distinct Black Mountain range. These ranges share much of the same basic geology, the southerly dip of the rock strata leading to north-facing escarpments. The highest peak of the Black Mountains is Waun Fach (), and Fan Brycheiniog () is the highest of the Black Mountain.

The park was founded in 1957 and is the third and most recently designated national park in Wales, after Snowdonia (Eryri) and the Pembrokeshire Coast. It is visited by approximately 4.4 million people each year.

== Toponymy ==
The name &quot;Bannau Brycheiniog&quot; is first attested in the sixteenth century, and &#x27;Brecon Beacons&#x27; first occurs in the eighteenth century as &quot;Brecknock Beacons&quot;. &quot;Bannau Brycheiniog&quot; derives from the Welsh &quot;bannau&quot;, &quot;peaks&quot;, and &quot;Brycheiniog&quot;, the name of an early medieval kingdom which covered the area. The English name is derived from the Welsh one; in the eleventh century the town of Brecon is recorded as &#x27;Brecheniauc&#x27;, which became &quot;Brecknock&quot; and &quot;Brecon&quot;.

In a paragraph on Brecknockshire, John Leland&#x27;s 1536–1539 &quot;Itinerary&quot; notes that:

Leland ascribes the name &quot;Banne Brekeniauc&quot; to the hills surrounding &quot;Artures Hille&quot; (Pen-y-Fan), also calling the range the &quot;Banne Hilles&quot;.

The term &quot;Brecknock Beacons&quot; was used in the eighteenth century and referred to the area around Pen y Fan, which was itself was sometimes called &#x27;the (Brecknock) Beacon&#x27;. For instance, Emanuel Bowen&#x27;s &quot;A New and accurate map of South Wales&quot; (1729) labels the peak as &#x27;The Vann or Brecknock Beacon&#x27;, John Clark&#x27;s 1794 &quot;General View of the Agriculture of the County of Brecknock&quot; refers to &#x27;the Vann, or Brecknock Beacon, the undisputed sovereign of all the mountains in South Wales&#x27;, and an 1839 tithe map of Cantref parish labels the mountain simply &#x27;Beacon&#x27;. A slightly wider definition was used in 1809 by the Breconshire historian Theophilus Jones, who wrote that &#x27;of the lofty summits of the Brecknock Beacons, that most southwards is the lowest, and the other two nearly of a height, they are sometimes called Cader Arthur or Arthur&#x27;s chair&#x27;. This implies that &quot;Brecknock Beacons&quot; referred to only three summits, including Pen y Fan and Corn Du.

To distinguish the Brecons Beacons range from the national park, the range is sometimes called the &quot;Central Beacons&quot;. In April 2023, the national park changed its name to &quot;Bannau Brycheiniog&quot; in English, abandoning the previous English name &quot;Brecon Beacons&quot;.

== Geography ==


The area covered by the national park stretches from Llandeilo in the west to Hay-on-Wye in the northeast and Pontypool in the southeast, covering . It principally consists of three mountain ranges; the Black Mountains in the east, the Brecon Beacons and Fforest Fawr uplands in the centre, and the Black Mountain in the west. The park is entirely within Wales and therefore excludes the Olchon Valley and Black Hill, which are part of the Black Mountains but in the English county of Herefordshire.

The central Brecon Beacons range comprises six main peaks, which from west to east are: Corn Du, ; Pen y Fan, the highest peak, ; Cribyn, ; Fan y Bîg, ; Bwlch y Ddwyallt, ; and Waun Rydd, . These summits form a long ridge, and the sections joining the first four form a horseshoe shape around the head of the Taf Fechan, which flows away to the southeast. To the northeast of the ridge, interspersed with long parallel spurs, are four cirques (Welsh: &quot;cwm&quot;) or four round-headed valleys, which from west to east these are Cwm Sere, Cwm Cynwyn, Cwm Oergwm and Cwm Cwareli.

The Black Mountains in the east are clearly separated from the central Beacons range by the Usk valley between Brecon and Abergavenny. Waun Fach () is the highest mountain in this range.

The Brecon Beacons range, Fforest Fawr, and Black Mountain form a continuous massif of high ground above 300 metres (1000&#x27;). The A470 road forms the approximate boundary between the central Beacons and Fforest Fawr. The highest peak of the Black Mountain is Fan Brycheiniog, at . There are notable waterfalls in this area, including the Henrhyd Falls and the Ystradfellte falls to the south of Fforest Fawr. The Ogof Ffynnon Ddu cave system is on the southwestern edge of Fforest Fawr.

Numerous town and community councils operate within these areas and include the town councils for Brecon and Hay on Wye and the community councils for Cefn-coed-y-cymmer, Llanfihangel Cwmdu with Bwlch and Cathedine, Llangattock, Llangors, Llanthony, Llywel, Pontsticill, Pontsarn and Vaynor, Talybont-on-Usk, Trallong, Trecastle and Ystradfellte.
=== Geology ===

The geology of the national park consists of a thick succession of sedimentary rocks laid down from the late Ordovician through the Silurian and Devonian to the late Carboniferous period. The rock sequence most closely associated with the park is the Old Red Sandstone from which most of its mountains are formed. The older parts of the succession, in the northwest, were folded and faulted during the Caledonian orogeny. Further faulting and folding, particularly in the south of the park is associated with the Variscan orogeny.

== History ==
The area was inhabited during the Neolithic and the succeeding Bronze Age, the most obvious legacy of the latter being the numerous burial cairns which adorn the hills of the centre and west of the National Park. There are remnants of round barrows on Fan Brycheiniog, Pen y Fan and Corn Du. The former was excavated in 2002–4 and the ashes in the central cist dated to about 2000 BCE using radiocarbon dating. A wreath of meadowsweet was probably placed in the burial.

Over twenty hillforts were established in the area during the Iron Age. The largest, and indeed the largest in South Wales, were the pair of forts atop y Garn Goch near Bethlehem, Carmarthenshire – y Gaer Fawr and y Gaer Fach – literally &quot;the big fort&quot; and &quot;the little fort&quot;. The forts are thought to have once been trading and political centres.

When the Romans came to Wales in 43 CE, they stationed more than 600 soldiers in the area. Y Gaer, near the town of Brecon was their main base. During the Norman Conquest many castles were erected throughout the park, including Carreg Cennen Castle. Brecon Castle is of Norman origin.

There are many old tracks which were used over the centuries by drovers to take their cattle and geese to market in England. The drovers brought back gorse seed, which they sowed to provide food for their sheep.

The area played a significant role during the Industrial Revolution as various raw materials including limestone, silica sand and ironstone were quarried for transport southwards to the furnaces of the industrialising South Wales Valleys.

The Brecon Beacons Mountain Centre was opened in 1966 to help visitors understand and enjoy the area. This western half of the national park gained European and global status in 2005 as Fforest Fawr Geopark, which includes the Black Mountain, the historic extent of Fforest Fawr, and much of the Brecon Beacons range and surrounding lowlands. The entire national park achieved the status of being an International Dark Sky Reserve in February 2013.

In 2006 and 2007, controversy surrounded the government decision to build the South Wales Gas Pipeline through the park, the National Park Authority calling the decision a &quot;huge blow&quot;.

=== Natural history ===
Most of the national park is bare, grassy moorland grazed by Welsh mountain ponies and Welsh mountain sheep, with scattered forestry plantations, and pasture in the valleys. Common ravens, red kites, peregrine falcons, northern wheatears, ring ouzels, and the rare merlin breeds in the park.

=== National park ===

The Brecon Beacons National Park was established in 1957, the third of the three Welsh parks after Snowdonia in 1951 and the Pembrokeshire Coast National Park in 1952. It covers an area of , which is much larger than the Brecon Beacons range. Over half of the park is in the south of Powys; the remainder of the park is split between northwestern Monmouthshire, eastern Carmarthenshire, northern Rhondda Cynon Taf and Merthyr Tydfil, and very small areas of Blaenau Gwent, and Torfaen.

The Park as designated in 1957 covered a slightly smaller area than it does presently. A &#x27;Variation Order&#x27; was made in June 1966 to extend it by about at its southeastern extremity. West of the canal, the boundary had previously been drawn along the boundary between the (then) administrative parishes of Llanover and Goytre.

The park is managed by Bannau Brycheiniog National Park Authority, a special purpose local authority with responsibilities to conserve and enhance the natural beauty of the park, aid visitors&#x27; enjoyment of the park, and support the economic and social well-being of local communities. The National Park Authority has 18 members, twelve are appointed by the area&#x27;s local authorities and six by the Welsh Government. Of the local authority members six are appointed by Powys County Council, and one each by the councils of Blaenau Gwent, Carmarthenshire, Merthyr Tydfil, Monmouthshire, Rhondda Cynon Taf, and Torfaen. There is also a standards committee with three members. Between 1995 and 2020 the park authority had 24 members, sixteen appointed by the local authorities and eight by the government.

==Activities==
Outdoor activities in Brecon Beacons National Park include walking, cycling, mountain biking and horse riding, as well as sailing, windsurfing, canoeing, fishing, rock climbing, hang-gliding, caravanning, camping and caving. A long-distance cycling route, the Taff Trail, passes over the Beacons on its way from Brecon to Cardiff, and in 2005 the first walk to span the entire length of the park was opened. The route, called the Beacons Way, runs from Abergavenny via The Skirrid () in the east and ends in the village of Llangadog in Carmarthenshire in the west.

==Brecon Mountain Railway==
A railway with narrow gauge trains is run by the Brecon Mountain Railway. The railway is a narrow gauge tourist railway on the south side of the Brecon Beacons. It climbs northwards from Pant along the full length of the Pontsticill Reservoir (also called &#x27;Taf Fechan&#x27; reservoir by Welsh Water) and continues past the adjoining Pentwyn Reservoir to Torpantau railway station. The railway&#x27;s starting point at Pant is located north of Merthyr Tydfil town centre.

== Mountain rescue ==

Mountain rescue in south Wales is provided by five volunteer groups, with the police having overall command. In serious situations they were historically aided by Royal Navy or Royal Air Force helicopters from RM Chivenor or RAF Valley, but since 2015 this task has been performed by Bristow Helicopters on behalf of HM Coastguard. The five groups are:

* CBMRT – Central Beacons Mountain Rescue Team
* BMRT – Brecon Mountain Rescue Team
* LMRT – Longtown Mountain Rescue Team based in the east
* WBMSART – Western Beacons Mountain Search and Rescue Team
* SARDA South Wales – Search and Rescue Dog Association covering South and Mid Wales

The groups are funded primarily by donations. Their work is not restricted to mountain rescue – they frequently assist the police in their search for missing or vulnerable people in the community.

== Military training ==

The Brecon Beacons are used for training members of the UK armed forces and military reservists. The Army’s Infantry Battle School is located at Brecon, and the Special Air Service (SAS) and Special Boat Service use the area to test the fitness of applicants. An exercise unique to the area is the &#x27;Fan dance&#x27;, which takes place on Pen y Fan. In July 2013 three soldiers died from overheating or heatstroke on an SAS selection exercise. An army captain had been found dead on Corn Du earlier in the year after training in freezing weather for the SAS.

== Use of &quot;Bannau Brycheiniog&quot; in English ==
On 17 April 2023 it was announced that the National Park had officially adopted the name Bannau Brycheiniog in both Welsh and English. The new official English name became &quot;Bannau Brycheiniog National Park&quot;, or &quot;the Bannau&quot; for short. The change took effect on the same day, the 66th anniversary of the park&#x27;s designation.

The authority stated that the change was to promote the area&#x27;s culture and heritage, as well as part of a wider overhaul of how the park is managed and to address environmental issues, such as climate change, and removing references to carbon-emitting beacons. The plan for the park to become net zero by 2035 and to address environmental concerns was supported by Welsh actor Michael Sheen. The change was described by a local as &quot;pride&quot; for Welsh-speakers, while others admitted both names would probably continue to be used. As part of the name change, the park also adopted a different logo, replacing its previous logo showing a lit beacon. Plaid Cymru&#x27;s Welsh language spokesperson supported the move, while the Welsh Liberal Democrats welcomed the decision, with its leader Jane Dodds comparing it to movements in New Zealand. Conservative MP James Evans described the move as &quot;not a priority&quot; for locals and raised concerns over cost, and the local Conservative MP, Fay Jones, argued that the English name could have been kept. Upon the news of the name change the Prime Minister Rishi Sunak stated &quot;I&#x27;m going to keep calling it the Brecon Beacons, and I would imagine most people will do that too.&quot;

Catherine Mealing-Jones, the park authority&#x27;s CEO, stated: &quot;the name Brecon Beacons doesn&#x27;t make any sense – the translation Brecon Beacons doesn&#x27;t really mean anything in Welsh&quot;, adding that &quot;a massive carbon-burning brazier is not a good look for an environmental organisation&quot;. Mealing-Jones admitted that people can refer to the park by either name, and that the change &quot;isn&#x27;t compulsory&quot;, but hoped the emphasis on the Welsh name would encourage people to use the term. She stated: &quot;We’d always had the name Bannau Brycheiniog as the Welsh translation and [...] we wanted to be celebrating Welsh people, Welsh culture, Welsh food, Welsh farming&quot;.

In May 2023 more than 50 local businesses in the national park campaigned for the &quot;Brecon Beacons&quot; name be restored alongside the Welsh name as a dual name. The campaigners say the decision did not respect Wales as a bilingual nation as it did not treat English and Welsh languages equally, and ambassadors of the park were not consulted on the name change. A digital marketer dismissed the campaigner&#x27;s argument, stating tourism would not be impacted, and the national park authority stated they are prioritising Welsh names going forward.

<text>Friedrich Ludwig Abresch (29 December 1699, Homburg - 1782) was a Dutch philologist of German origins.

Born in Homburg, the reasons that led him to move to the Dutch Republic are uncertain. He visited the college in Herborn and the University of Utrecht. He was a scholar of Karl Andreas Duker and Arnold Drakenborch. However he followed rather the teachings of Tiberius Hemsterhuis and engaged in Greek literature as far as his work allowed this.

In 1723 he was appointed co-rector, in 1725 rector in Middelburg. After the death of his first wife, he remarried a rich woman from Zwolle and willingly accepted the offer to take the local rectorate. He remained in office until his death in 1782.

<doc id="763933" wikidata="Q5422134" url="?curid=763933" title="Extra (cricket)">
<text>In cricket, an extra (sometimes called a sundry) is a run scored by, or awarded to, a batting team which is not credited to any individual batter. They are the runs scored by methods other than striking the ball with the bat.

The extras are tallied separately on the scorecard and count only towards the team&#x27;s score. Giving away many extras is often considered as untidy bowling.

There are five types of extra: no-ball (nb), wide (w or wd), bye (b), leg bye (lb), and penalty run (pen).

== Types of extras ==

=== Illegal deliveries ===
These are extras that are awarded because the bowler or fielders have violated certain rules in how they deliver the ball to the batter (i.e. they are not bowling from far away enough, or the ball is out of the batter&#x27;s reach), or where they are positioned in the field. Most methods of dismissal can not occur on an illegal delivery. Illegal deliveries do not count towards the completion of the over they occur in, and thus in limited overs cricket, illegal deliveries do not count toward the maximum number of deliveries to be bowled in the innings.

==== No-ball ====
An umpire may call a &quot;no-ball&quot; when the bowler or fielder commits an illegal action during bowling.

The most common reason for a no-ball is overstepping the popping crease with the front foot. A rarer reason is when the bowler&#x27;s back foot touches or lands outside the return crease. Other reasons include when a bowler throws (or &quot;chucks&quot;) the ball (meaning significantly straightening the elbow during the delivery), or bowls a full toss above waist high (a beamer), or for dangerous or unfair short pitched bowling.

The penalty for a no-ball is one run (or, in some one-day competitions, two runs, and/or a free hit); furthermore, the no-ball does not count as one of the six in an over and an extra ball is bowled.

The run awarded for the no-ball is an extra. Any additional runs scored by the batter, whether by running or by a boundary, are included in the individual&#x27;s score if scored off the bat, or byes or leg byes (whichever is appropriate) if not. These are in addition to the run awarded for the no-ball. If the no-ball would also be a wide, it is only scored once, as a no-ball.

Since the 1980s a no-ball has been scored against the bowler, making the bowling statistics more accurate.

==== Wide ====
A ball being delivered too far from the batter to strike it, provided that no part of the batter&#x27;s body or equipment touches the ball, is called wide by the umpire. A wide scores one run for the batting team as an extra. Additionally, a wide is not counted as one of the six balls in the over and a replacement is bowled. All wides are all added to the bowler&#x27;s score.

=== Bye ===
If the ball is not struck by the batter&#x27;s bat (nor connects with any part of the batter&#x27;s body) the batters may still run if they choose. If the ball reaches the boundary, whether or not the batters ran, four byes are awarded. Any runs scored are scored as extras.

Byes may be scored from no-balls as well as from legitimate deliveries.

In modern cricket, byes are normally scored against the wicket-keeper in their statistics.

=== Leg-bye ===
If the ball hits the batter&#x27;s body, then provided the batter is not out leg before wicket (lbw) &quot;and&quot; the batter either tried to avoid being hit &quot;or&quot; tried to hit the ball with the bat, the batters may run. In this case, regardless of the part of anatomy touched by the ball, the runs scored are known as leg-byes. If (with the same provisos) the ball reaches the boundary, whether or not the batters ran, then four leg-byes are awarded.

Leg-byes can be scored from no-balls or legitimate deliveries and are scored as extras. The hands holding the bat, and any gloves worn on them, are counted as part of the bat when they make contact with the ball; thus, runs scored off them are credited to the batter and are not leg-byes.

Unlike no-balls and wides, byes and leg-byes are not scored against the bowler.

=== Penalty runs ===

Penalty runs are awarded for various breaches of the Laws, generally related to unfair play or player conduct. Many of these penalties have been added since 2000. Penalties are awarded under Law 41 for Unfair Play and, since 2017 under Law 42 for Players&#x27; Conduct.

==Records==

The most extras in a Test match innings is 76 (35 byes, 26 leg byes, 0 wides, and 15 no balls), conceded by India against Pakistan in the 3rd Test in 2007.

The most extras in a One Day International innings is 59, achieved twice against Pakistan: by West Indies in the 9th ODI in 1989 and by Scotland in the 1999 World Cup.

The most extras in a Twenty20 innings is 45, achieved by Philippines against Indonesia in December 2023.

<text>The Nehalem River is a river on the Pacific coast of northwest Oregon in the United States, approximately long. It drains part of the Northern Oregon Coast Range northwest of Portland, originating on the east side of the mountains and flowing in a loop around the north end of the range near the mouth of the Columbia River. Its watershed of includes an important timber-producing region of Oregon that was the site of the Tillamook Burn. In its upper reaches it flows through a long narrow valley of small mountain communities but is unpopulated along most of its lower reaches inland from the coast.

It rises in the northeast corner of Tillamook County, in the Tillamook State Forest. It initially flows northeast, across the northwest corner of Washington County and into western Columbia County, past Vernonia where it receives Rock Creek, it hooks to the northwest and west into Clatsop County, then flows southwest back into northern Tillamook County. It enters Nehalem Bay on the Pacific in an estuary at Nehalem, about west-northwest of Portland. Near its mouth on the Pacific, the river passes under U.S. Route 101.

It receives the Salmonberry River from the east in northern Tillamook County. It also receives the North Fork Nehalem River from the north about northwest of Nehalem, just before entering Nehalem Bay.

In 2007, a major storm caused the Salmonberry Bridge (located at ) to collapse. The bridge was rebuilt and opened to traffic on May 14, 2012.

Nehalem is also used as the codename for Intel&#x27;s first-generation line of Core processors.

<text>Edward Leonard O&#x27;Neill (born April 12, 1946) is an American actor, comedian, and former football player. Over his career, he has earned four Screen Actors Guild Awards as well as nominations for three Primetime Emmy Awards and two Golden Globe Awards.

O’Neill gained stardom for playing a working class father, Al Bundy, on the Fox sitcom &quot;Married... with Children&quot; (1987–1997) for which he was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Television Series Musical or Comedy twice. He had a career resurgence portraying the family patriarch Jay Pritchett on the award-winning ABC sitcom &quot;Modern Family&quot; (2009–2020), for which he was nominated for three Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Actor in a Comedy Series and won four Screen Actors Guild Awards for Outstanding Ensemble in a Comedy Series. He portrayed Governor Eric Baker in the drama series &quot;The West Wing&quot; (2004–2005) and Donald Sterling in the FX on Hulu limited series &quot;Clipped&quot; (2024).

In cinema, O’Neill made his debut in the William Friedkin crime thriller &quot;Cruising&quot; (1980). He has since appeared in the &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World&quot; film series (1991–1992), &quot;Dutch&quot; (1991), &quot;Little Giants&quot; (1994), &quot;Prefontaine&quot; (1997), &quot;The Spanish Prisoner&quot; (1997), &quot;The Bone Collector&quot; (1999), &quot;Sun Dogs&quot; (2017), and &quot;The Last Shift&quot; (2020). He has done voice-work for animated films such as the &quot;Wreck-It Ralph&quot; franchise (2012–present) and &quot;Finding Dory&quot; (2016).

==Early life and education==
Ed O&#x27;Neill was born into an Irish-American Catholic family in Youngstown, Ohio, on April 12, 1946. Both sides of his family are the descendants of Irish immigrants who came to the United States in the 1850s.

His mother, Ruth Ann (née Quinlan) (1924–2017), was a homemaker and social worker, and his father, Edward Phillip O&#x27;Neill (1921–2008), was a steel mill worker and truck driver. O&#x27;Neill attended Ursuline High School where he played football. At 14, he worked in construction, then at a steel mill.

He was awarded a football scholarship to Ohio University, where he majored in history, and was a member of the Mu chapter of the Delta Tau Delta fraternity. He left the university after his sophomore year. He admits he spent more time playing sports and partying than studying. He also feuded with his coach.

He transferred to Youngstown State University, where he lettered as a defensive lineman from 1967 to 1968. As an undergraduate, he pledged Delta Sigma Phi and was initiated into the Delta Sigma chapter there. While at Youngstown State, he played in a game against Roger Staubach, who was playing for the Pensacola Naval Station. O&#x27;Neill said that his team was penalized 15 yards when he hit Staubach out of bounds.

== Professional football career ==
O&#x27;Neill was signed as an undrafted free agent by the Pittsburgh Steelers in 1969 under rookie head coach Chuck Noll but was cut in training camp, having to compete with fellow rookie defensive lineman Joe Greene and L. C. Greenwood for a roster spot. Both became key members of the Steel Curtain defense during the Steelers success in the 1970s. Later, while on &quot;Married... with Children&quot;, O&#x27;Neill played a former high school football star who had failed to make it big and frequently reminisced about his &quot;glory days&quot; at Polk High (&quot;I once scored four touchdowns in a single game&quot;). O&#x27;Neill worked as a substitute social studies teacher at his alma mater Ursuline High School before becoming an actor.

==Acting career==
=== 1979–1986: Early acting roles ===

O&#x27;Neill re-enrolled at Youngstown State after being cut by the Steelers and was one of the first students at the school&#x27;s new theater program. Later, in 1979, he played a boxer opposite Danny Aiello in the Broadway play &quot;Knockout&quot; at the Helen Hayes Theatre. Richard Eder of &quot;The New York Times&quot; described the performance as &quot;chilling&quot; adding, &quot;As Paddy Klonski, the brutal young boxer, Edward O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s towering physique, peaceful smile and empty eyes form a genuinely frightening presence&quot;. It was there that he was seen by director William Friedkin and landed his first movie role, as a police detective in &quot;Cruising&quot;, starring Al Pacino.

In 1985, O&#x27;Neill appeared in a Red Lobster commercial. He made a brief guest appearance in &quot;The Equalizer&quot;. In 1986, he was cast as NYPD detective Jimmy &quot;Popeye&quot; Doyle for the planned television series &quot;Popeye Doyle&quot;. The character had originally appeared in the motion picture &quot;The French Connection&quot; (played by Gene Hackman). The two-hour made-for-television movie/pilot was filmed and shown on network television. O&#x27;Neill received good reviews for his performance, and the pilot received positive ratings, but the series was not picked up for production.

=== 1987–2008: &quot;Married with Children&quot; and other roles ===
In 1984, while playing the role of Lennie in a stage production of John Steinbeck&#x27;s &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; at Hartford Stage in Hartford, Connecticut, he was seen by a casting agent from the Fox television network and was asked to audition for the role of Al Bundy in &quot;Married... with Children&quot;, a proposed sitcom about a dysfunctional family living in Chicago. He won the part because, during the audition, he simply slumped his shoulders and sighed as he was about to walk through the front door of the home. &quot;Married... with Children&quot; led off the first night of Fox&#x27;s primetime lineup on April 5, 1987, concluding after 11 seasons on June 9, 1997.

During this time O&#x27;Neill starred in several films, including the family films &quot;Dutch&quot; (1991) and &quot;Little Giants&quot; (1994). He also had small parts in the comedy films &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World&quot; (1992), and &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World 2&quot; (1993). He appeared as Relish the Troll King in &quot;The 10th Kingdom&quot; (2000). He took roles in the drama films &quot;Prefontaine&quot; (1997), &quot;The Spanish Prisoner&quot; (1997), and &quot;The Bone Collector&quot; (1999). O&#x27;Neill made a brief appearance on the comedy variety show &quot;In Living Color&quot;, playing the &quot;Dirty Dozens&quot; champion who defeats the challenger, played by Jamie Foxx in 1994. He also made a cameo on the sitcom &quot;8 Simple Rules&quot; as the ex-boyfriend of Cate S. Hennessy (played by Katey Sagal, who portrayed O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s wife Peggy Bundy on &quot;Married... with Children&quot;). He appeared in the movie &quot;The Adventures of Ford Fairlane&quot; with Andrew Dice Clay. During the mid-1990s, he had a string of appearances in commercials for 1-800-COLLECT.

&quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; franchise creator Dick Wolf cast O&#x27;Neill as Sergeant Joe Friday in his 2003 update of Jack Webb&#x27;s long-running &quot;Dragnet&quot; media franchise. The series was canceled by ABC in its second season. O&#x27;Neill went on to appear as Governor Eric Baker, a recurring character on the NBC political drama series &quot;The West Wing&quot; from 2004 to 2005. O&#x27;Neill also played Bill on HBO&#x27;s television series &quot;John from Cincinnati&quot;. In 2008, O&#x27;Neill appeared in an advertisement for then-presidential candidate Barack Obama as &quot;Al the Shoesalesman&quot;. In January 2009, O&#x27;Neill reunited with David Faustino (Bud Bundy from &quot;Married... with Children&quot;) for two episodes of Faustino&#x27;s show &quot;Star-ving&quot;. O&#x27;Neill also appeared with the entire cast of &quot;Married... with Children&quot; again when they were honored at the 7th Annual TV Land Award show in 2009.

=== 2009–2020: &quot;Modern Family&quot; ===
For eleven seasons O&#x27;Neill played the role of Jay Pritchett on the ABC sitcom &quot;Modern Family&quot; from 2009 to 2020. Ken Tucker of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; wrote, &quot;O’Neill may have the trickiest job here. A late-middle-ager remarried to a Latina bombshell...his Jay wants to enjoy his overdue-midlife-crisis prize but has to put up with her mope of a son...and do it without seeming like a mean old duffer. O’Neill and the writers pull it off by making Jay both deadpan sarcastic and a genuinely decent guy.&quot; Gina Bellafante of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Mr. O’Neill exquisitely portrays the straight man to the fire engine of Sofia Vergara&quot;. Barry Garron of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; wrote, &quot;O’Neill’s Al Bundy is one of TV’s most unforgettable characters, but this role will let viewers see him in a new light&quot;. The role earned him three Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series nominations—in 2011, 2012, and 2013. O&#x27;Neill won the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Ensemble in a Comedy Series four times from 2010 through 2013.

Since 2012, O&#x27;Neill has done voice-overs in TV advertisements for the over-the-counter form of Zyrtec, along with Walmart&#x27;s store-branded mobile phone service Straight Talk. In 2016, O&#x27;Neill starred as Hank the Octopus in the Pixar animated film &quot;Finding Dory&quot;. According to O&#x27;Neill, he didn&#x27;t realize at first that he had a starring role in the film. As his voice recording sessions continued and most of his interactions turned out to be with Dory, he began to suspect that Hank was a major character in the film.

O&#x27;Neill starred in FX on Hulu miniseries &quot;Clipped&quot; portraying Donald Sterling. Andrew Lawrence of &quot;The Guardian&quot; gave the show a perfect score declaring, &quot;Forty years of playing cranks on screen has given Ed O’Neill a particular understanding for Sterling’s quirks, gripes and foibles that few others in his field can claim&quot;. Daniel Feinberg of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; wrote, &quot;O’Neill leans hard into every aspect of his entitled grotesquerie, from the external — such a bad dye job — to the dazed certainty in his intonations. It’s not a subtle performance, but Donald Sterling’s general grossness wasn’t a secret&quot;. Quinci LeGardye of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; stated, &quot;O’Neill gives a skilled performance as a truly reprehensible human being&quot;.

==Personal life==
O&#x27;Neill is married to actress Catherine Rusoff. As of 2016, they were living in Los Angeles with their two daughters.

After being introduced to Brazilian jiu-jitsu by his friend writer/director John Milius, O&#x27;Neill has trained for 22 years under the mentoring of Rorion Gracie. In December 2007, after 16 years of training, O&#x27;Neill received his black belt. In the 2012 TV documentary &quot;I Am Bruce Lee&quot;, O&#x27;Neill states that he considers getting his black belt &quot;the greatest achievement of my life, apart from my children.&quot;

On May 18, 2013, O&#x27;Neill was the recipient of an honorary Doctor of Arts degree from his alma mater, Youngstown State University. On November 30, 2023, after the controversial hiring of Republican congressman Bill Johnson as the university&#x27;s president, O&#x27;Neill told Ideastream he was going to return his degree, saying, &quot;I don&#x27;t want it... I&#x27;m going to start calling it Trump-U.&quot;
