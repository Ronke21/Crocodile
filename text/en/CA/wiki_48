<text>Reproductive Freedom for All, formerly NARAL Pro-Choice America and commonly known as simply NARAL ( ), is a non-profit 501(c)(4) organization in the United States that engages in lobbying, political action, and advocacy efforts to oppose restrictions on abortion, to expand access to legal abortion and birth control, and to support paid parental leave and protection against pregnancy discrimination.

NARAL is associated with the NARAL Pro-Choice America Foundation, a 501(c)(3) organization, and the NARAL Pro-Choice America PAC, a political action committee. Founded in 1969, NARAL is the oldest extant abortion rights advocacy group in the United States, though it was predated by a few now-defunct groups, including the Society for Humane Abortion and the Association for the Study of Abortion.

==History==
The precursor to NARAL was the Association to Repeal Abortion Laws (ARAL). ARAL was an expansion of the &quot;Army of Three&quot; which was made up of abortion rights activists Pat Maginnis, Rowena Gurner, and financial investor Lana Phelan. The Army of Three organized and distributed referral lists of people performing illegal abortions and held classes on do-it-yourself abortions in California.
Originally called the National Association for the Repeal of Abortion Laws, NARAL was established at the &quot;First National Conference on Abortion Laws: Modification or Repeal?&quot; held February 14–16, 1969, in Chicago. Its formation was announced on the front page of &quot;The New York Times&quot;. The conference, sponsored by 21 organizations and attended by 350 people, included a planning session for NARAL and the report of NARAL&#x27;s pre-formation planning committee: Lawrence Lader of New York City, Garrett Hardin of California, and Dr. Lonny Myers of Chicago. Key conference speakers included obstetrician/gynecologist Bernard Nathanson (who later became an anti-abortion activist), journalist Lawrence Lader, and women&#x27;s rights advocate Betty Friedan. The conference was split between those favoring abortion law &quot;reform&quot; and those favoring &quot;repeal&quot;. The more conservative reform position favored adopting something like the American Law Institute guidelines, which would liberalize existing abortion law by allowing abortion to preserve the physical or mental health of the mother, or in the case of pregnancies resulting from rape or incest. The repeal position, led by Betty Friedan and Conni Bille, favored &quot;ad libitum&quot; abortion rights at the discretion of the mother. The conference voted to adopt the more radical repeal position.

Those agents attending the session elected a 12-person Planning Committee for NARAL&#x27;s formation: Lawrence Lader (Chairman), Ruth Proskauer Smith (Vice-Chair), Ruth Cusack (Secretary), Beatrice McClintock (Treasurer), Constance Bille Finnerty (Secretary), Mrs. Marc Hughes Fisher, Betty Friedan, Norval Morris, Stewart Mott, Dr. Bernard Nathanson, Edna Smith, and Percy Sutton. The committee held its first official meeting in New York on February 25, 1969. It hired Lee Gidding as the first Executive Director; she opened NARAL&#x27;s office in New York City on March 3.

Several founding leaders, including Lader and Proskauer Smith, were previously active in the more conservative, pro-reform Association for the Study of Abortion founded in 1965. A number were also active in groups associated with the population movement, such as the Association for Voluntary Sterilization and Zero Population Growth.

The Planning Committee, meeting regularly between February and September 1969, defined NARAL&#x27;s purpose and program, drafted bylaws to submit to the membership for approval, prepared a slate to run for the Board of Directors, and directed NARAL&#x27;s activities. The Committee defined NARAL&#x27;s purpose as follows:

NARAL, recognizing the fundamental human right of a woman to limit her own reproduction, is dedicated to eliminating all laws and practices that would compel any woman to bear a child against her will. To that end, it proposes to initiate and co-ordinate political, social, and legal action of individuals and groups concerned with providing safe operations by qualified physicians for all women seeking them, regardless of economic status.

The original NARAL program had six parts:

# Assist in the formation in all states of direct political action groups dedicated to the purpose of NARAL;
# Serve as a clearinghouse for activities related to NARAL&#x27;s purpose;
# Create new materials for mass distribution which tell the repeal story dramatically and succinctly;
# Train field workers to organize and stimulate legislative action;
# Suggest direct action projects;
# Raise funds for the above activities.

The Board of Directors, elected by the membership, officially replaced the Planning Committee at the first Board meeting, held on September 27, 1969. The Board elected Honorary Officers (Co-Presidents Dr. Lester Breslow and Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm and Senator Maurine Neuberger as Vice President), Officers (including New York City Councilwoman Carol Greitzer as President), an Executive Committee (Lawrence Lader, Chairman), and a Nominating Committee. In addition, the Board adopted a very specific program of action that focused on winning repeal in New York and other key states. Only one year after NARAL&#x27;s formation, the New York state legislature voted to legalize abortion, and the new law went into effect on July 1, 1970. On that day, NARAL held a medical conference at NYU Medical School to train physicians in non-hospital abortion techniques.

From 1969 until early 1973, NARAL worked with other groups to repeal state abortion laws and oversee the implementation of abortion policies in those few states that had liberalized their laws. On January 22, 1973, in &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;, the U.S. Supreme Court held that, during the first three months of pregnancy, abortion should be a private decision between a woman and her doctor, and that during the second three months, state regulation should be permitted only to protect the health of the woman. To reflect the Court&#x27;s repeal of restrictive laws, NARAL became the National Abortion Rights Action League in late 1973.

In 2003, the organization dropped the long form name in favor of &quot;NARAL Pro-Choice America&quot;. That same year, the organization launched a massive television and print campaign, to make abortion a key issue in the 2004 elections.

From 1987 until 2006, Ann McGuiness was development director of NARAL.

In September 2023 NARAL changed its name to Reproductive Freedom for All. This was done to better reflect how Americans thought of abortion access in the year since the repeal of Roe v. Wade through Dobbs v. Jackson Women&#x27;s Health Organization.

===National executive directors===
Karen Mulhauser served as the first national executive director from 1974 to 1982.The next NARAL leader was Nanette Falkenburg, who served from 1982 until 1985; Kate Michelman became the next director until she announced her retirement in 2004. Nancy Keenan, formerly the Montana Superintendent of Schools, became President of NARAL and served until February 2013. Ilyse Hogue was the group&#x27;s president from 2013 to 2021. In November 2021, NARAL announced the hire of their current president, Mini Timmaraju, who is the first woman of color to lead the organization.

==Activities==

NARAL Pro-Choice America uses numerous tactics to lobby for access to abortion and birth control in the U.S., as well as to promote paid parental leave and stop pregnancy discrimination. They track state and federal legislation, endorse candidates, and run advertising and education campaigns on these issues.

It sponsors lawsuits against governments and hospitals, donates money to politicians supportive of abortion rights through its political action committee, and organizes its members to contact members of Congress and urge them to support NARAL&#x27;s positions. NARAL sponsored the March for Women&#x27;s Lives in 2004. NARAL also sponsors public sex education, and tracks state and national legislation affecting laws regarding abortion, women&#x27;s health and rights. NARAL currently recruits members from the general public through state chapters.

==Criticism==

In 2005, NARAL Pro-Choice America was criticized for an ad campaign that targeted U.S. Supreme Court chief justice nominee John Roberts, and withdrew the ad. The ad featured anti-abortion violence survivor Emily Lyons, and claimed that as U.S. Deputy Solicitor-General, Roberts had supported &quot;violent fringe groups and a convicted clinic bomber&quot;. While Roberts did argue before the Supreme Court that a 19th-century statute directed against the Ku Klux Klan did not apply to protesters outside abortion clinics, the case in question occurred almost seven years before the 1998 bombing shown in the ad. The ad was retracted under pressure from other pro-abortion rights groups, as undercutting the credibility of the abortion rights cause.

In 2006, NARAL was criticized by some other pro-abortion rights political activists for supporting former Republicans Lincoln Chafee and Michael Bloomberg, and for supporting moderate or conservative Democrats.

<doc id="770114" wikidata="Q7987478" url="?curid=770114" title="Western Association of Schools and Colleges">
<text>The Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC ( )) provided accreditation of public and private universities, colleges, secondary and elementary schools in California and Hawaii, the territories of Guam, American Samoa and Northern Marianas Islands, in addition to the Marshall Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Palau, the Pacific Rim, Peru, Czech Republic, Armenia, and East Asia.

Until 2012, WASC was a single organization with three units. In 2012, it separated into three organizations that share the WASC acronym as part of their name: the Accrediting Commission for Schools (ACS WASC), the Accrediting Commission for Community and Junior Colleges (ACCJC), and the WASC Senior College and University Commission (WSCUC).

==Accrediting Commission for Schools==
The Accrediting Commission for Schools (ACS WASC) accredits schools below the college level. Included are elementary, junior high, middle, high and adult schools, whether public, private, or church-related. ACS WASC also accredits not-for-profit, non-degree granting postsecondary institutions.

==Accrediting Commission for Community and Junior Colleges==

The Accrediting Commission for Community and Junior Colleges (ACCJC) evaluates and accredits public and private postsecondary institutions that offer two-year education programs and award the associate degree.

The ACCJC&#x27;s mission is to help member institutions &quot;to advance educational quality and student learning and achievement. This collaboration fosters institutional excellence and continuous improvement through innovation, self-analysis, peer review, and application of standards.&quot;

==WASC Senior College and University Commission==

The WASC Senior College and University Commission (WSCUC) is an institutional accrediting agency for colleges and universities that award bachelor&#x27;s degrees or more advanced degrees. It originally and still primarily accredits institutions in California, Hawaii, and the Pacific, as well as a limited number of institutions outside the U.S. WSCUC is recognized by the U.S. Department of Education as certifying institutional eligibility for federal funding in a number of programs, including student access to federal financial aid.

<text>The Willapa River is a river on the Pacific coast of southwestern Washington in the United States, approximately long. It drains an area of low hills and a coastal plain into Willapa Bay, a large estuary north of the mouth of the Columbia River.

The river rises in the Willapa Hills in southeastern Pacific County, approximately west of Chehalis. It flows northwest in a winding course past the small communities of Willapa and Raymond. It enters the northwest end of Willapa Bay at South Bend.

==Name==
The name is that of the Willapa people, an Athapaskan-speaking people, now extinct, who occupied the valley of the river and also the prairies between the headwaters of the Chehalis and Cowlitz Rivers.

<text>Icaraí is the name of a beach and its surrounding neighborhood in Niterói, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

The origin of the neighborhood dates back to the parish of São João de Carahy and later, with two large estates, the Icaraí estate and the Cavalão estate.

The name &quot;Icaraí&quot; comes from an ancient Tupinambá village called (recorded as by Jean de Léry). It means &quot;river of acarás&quot;, derived from the composition of and .

<text>Philippine Republic Day (), also known as Philippine–American Friendship Day, is a commemoration in the Philippines held annually on July 4. It was formerly an official holiday designated as Independence Day, celebrating the signing of the Treaty of Manila, which granted Philippine independence from the United States of America in 1946.

==Background==
The Philippine Islands were an American possession from 1898 to 1946, first as a territory and then as a commonwealth beginning in 1935. Between 1941 and 1945 during the Second World War, the Empire of Japan occupied the Islands; the Commonwealth government-in-exile headed by President Manuel Luis Quezon was based in Australia and later in the United States.

A campaign to retake the country began in October 1944, when General Douglas MacArthur landed in Leyte along with Sergio Osmeña, who had succeeded to the presidency after Quezon&#x27;s death on August 1, 1944. The battles entailed long fierce fighting; some of the Japanese continued to fight until the official surrender of Japan on September 2, 1945. The country gained complete independence on July 4, 1946.

==Observance==

Initially, the nation&#x27;s Independence Day holiday (Araw ng Kalayaan) was held on July 4. President Diosdado Macapagal moved it to June 12, the date in 1898 on which Emilio Aguinaldo issued the Philippine Declaration of Independence from Spain. Philippine Republic Day was created in its place and kept as a holiday under Macapagal, coinciding with the United States&#x27;s own Independence Day.

In 1955, President Ramón Magsaysay had issued Presidential Proclamation No. 212, s. 1955, which established the observance of Philippine American Day every November 15—the anniversary of the inauguration of the Commonwealth. Sometime under the rule of President Ferdinand Marcos, Philippine–American Day was renamed &quot;Philippine–American Friendship Day&quot; and moved to July 4, overshadowing the observance of the date as Republic Day. After the 1935 Constitution was suspended under martial law and later superseded by the 1972 Constitution, it was impolitic to remind the nation of the old Third Republic. This is why, when President Marcos issued Presidential Proclamation No. 2346 s. 1984, reference was made to Philippine–American Friendship Day, which was relegated to a working holiday without mention of Republic Day.

In 1996, President Fidel V. Ramos celebrated the day as Republic Day.

==Delisting==
The practice of celebrating Philippine–American Friendship Day and Republic Day as a non-working holiday was formally abolished in 1987 under President Corazon C. Aquino. Section 26 of the Administrative Code of 1987 specified a list of regular holidays and nationwide special days that did not include July 4.

== New holiday ==
On January 9, 2013, President Benigno Aquino III issued Proclamation No. 533, declaring January 23 as &quot;Araw ng Republikang Pilipino&quot; (Philippine Republic Day), the anniversary of the proclamation of the First Philippine Republic.

On April 5, 2018, President Rodrigo Duterte signed Republic Act No. 11014, declaring January 23 of every year as &quot;First Philippine Republic Day,&quot; making it a special working holiday nationwide.

<doc id="770126" wikidata="Q204067" url="?curid=770126" title="Swedish hip-hop">
<text>Emerging in the first half of the 1980s, Swedish hip hop originated in the cities of Stockholm and Malmö. Early on, most rappers in Sweden performed in English. Funkalics and The Latin Kings, two very different acts united by their innovative use of the Swedish language, debuted a decade later and paved the way for a second, and bigger, breakthrough for Swedish hip hop. Today, some of the most popular rappers use Swedish, often in different accents.

==History==
===Origins===
Percussionist Per Cussion (of reggae-punk band Dag Vag) and Grandmaster Funk are generally credited with bringing hip hop to Sweden. In 1984 they released the songs &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop&quot;, &quot;Snow Blind&quot; and &quot;Payin´ The Price&quot;. Breakdancing had arrived a year earlier and spread quickly, its forerunners known as Robot Lasse, Mark, Spirio and Perkeles.

In 1984, Jan Fex, from Lund, released an album, &quot;Utanför mitt liv&quot;, on Mercury Records with the first contemporary R&amp;B, rap and EDM songs in Swedish, 5 years before JustD&#x27;s debut. The album came about after Fex had lived in New York in 1982 and 1983. On the album, Fex collaborated with musicians such as Jonas Hellborg and Jesper Elén. The vinyl release never made it to CD and a re-master is expected for digital release in 2024. Fex moved to Copenhagen, Denmark in 1985 and started a Fairlight CMI rental service, thereby becoming one of the first Swedes to work with digital samplers and sequencers.

In the summer of 1984, following a major dance competition, Double M Crew, Abdula &amp; The Rockers, Rock Ski, Almighty T and MC II Fresh joined together to form the hip hop collective Ice Cold Rockers, a crew consisting of rappers, scratchers, dancers and graffiti artists. Broadcaster D and One Eye Que (later recording under the name Ayo) started their collaboration.

Sweden, outside of Stockholm, soon became familiar with hip hop when the popular movie &quot;Stockholmsnatt&quot;, which featured the IC Rockers, came out. Pop-C and Snoopy were on the soundtrack and had a hit in 1986 with their single &quot;Next Time&quot;.

New artists followed in their tracks. Rob&#x27;n&#x27;Raz produced the album &quot;Competition Is None&quot; and introduced Papa Dee&#x27;s dub and dancehall influenced rap to the Swedes. See-Que, from Stockholm, collaborated with the American label Priority Records on their compilation album &quot;Basement Flavor&quot;.

The first real rap song in Swedish &quot;Jag Är Def&quot; came from MC Tim in 1989. The year after, Just D was formed and their decision to rap in Swedish would earn them a huge fan base, and introduce rap to the general populace.

===The first breakthrough===
By the end of the 1980s, hip hop became increasingly more popular in Sweden. The international success of rapper/singer Neneh Cherry&#x27;s crossover album, &quot;Raw Like Sushi&quot;, made the Swedish media take a closer look at the genre in the context of Sweden&#x27;s native artists. The inaugural Swedish Championship in Rap was held in 1989 and the winner was ADL&#x27;s group Sons Of Soul. The runner-up was Ms Melodie, who went on to have a career as Leila K. Briefly picking up the torch of Neneh Cherry, Leila K had an international crossover hit with the rap track &quot;Got To Get&quot;. The third place was taken by the legendary Vasteras rapper Mc Magic Dee and his Thirteen cent Killer. There was now a solid market for rap music and record companies were taking notice.

Just D&#x27;s ironically titled album &quot;Rock N Roll&quot; became popular with many people who had yet to embrace hip hop. Snoopy (aka Quincy Jones III) had moved to the USA to produce acts like Young MC, LL Cool J and Ice Cube. The Sure Shot Groove (MC Stranger and Complicated C) debuted with the 12-inch &quot;Rhymes R Flowin&quot;&#x27;. The collective Infinite Mass won the Swedish qualification finals for the World Rap Competition and released their EP &quot;Da Blackmass&quot;. One of their songs, &quot;Shoot The Racist&quot;, was on the soundtrack for the 1993 movie &quot;Sökarna&quot; and became hugely popular. It was later renamed &quot;Area Turns Red&quot; due to some media controversy over the lyrics.

The Latin Kings ushered in a new wave of Swedish hip hop artists. They used &quot;Rinkeby Swedish&quot;, sometimes described as a kind of a pidgin language, to describe life in the &#x27;Million Programme&#x27; suburbs of Stockholm. Their 1994 debut album &quot;Välkommen till Förorten&quot; (Welcome to the suburb), produced by Gordon Cyrus and founder of first the Swedish Hip Hop label Breakin Bread, was a success in the charts and favorite with the critics. The coming generation of Swedish hip hop artists would be distinguished from the first by their inclusion of Swedish language rhymes, as opposed to the exclusive use of English rhymes by Sweden&#x27;s first generation of rappers.

===The second breakthrough===
In 1998 Petter debuted with the album &quot;Mitt sjätte sinne&quot;, which became an enormous success and started the Swedish hip hop boom of the late 1990s. With him came an array of artists, such as Thomas Rusiak, DJ Sleepy and Eye-n&#x27;-I. Other artists that achieved mainstream popularity following Petter&#x27;s break include Ken Ring and Ayo. Feven released her acclaimed album &quot;Hela Vägen Ut&quot;. Looptroop developed a middle class revolutionary style. Timbuktu, a native of Lund, emerged and went on to gain a reputation as one of Sweden&#x27;s most popular MCs.

===21st century===

Swedish rappers who have achieved nationwide recognition include: Promoe, Snook, Ayesha, Fjärde Världen, Fattaru, Ison &amp; Fille, Advance Patrol, Lazee, Toftgard, and Adam Tensta.

Many of these artists have been exposed to a domestic hip hop culture since they were born, or very young. In a sense the Swedish scene has become less volatile, and also less vulnerable to becoming extinct. Influence from the U.S. culture is no longer as significant; American hip hop is still important but outside influences also come from French, British, Danish, and Japanese hip hop, and other regions around the world with vibrant and innovative music scenes. 
Due to file sharing via the Internet and changing consumer markets, the number of records an artist has sold is not necessarily indicative of how popular or important that artist is. There are Swedish hip hop acts who release records for what they know is going to be an economic loss, in hope of earning their money through concerts and other ventures.

The hip hop genres represented in Swedish hip hop are plentiful. Alternative hip hop is, most likely, bigger than Gangsta and Hardcore combined. There are also many fusion genres such as Neo soul, Grime, and Reggaeton.

Swedish rap often deals with themes of multiculturalism and positive suburban identity. Many rappers affirm their ethnic and racial background, but tend to identify more with their community and with Swedish minorities in general rather than with specific ethnic cultures, or with mainstream Swedish culture. Rapper Adam Tensta, for instance, takes his name from the suburb of Tensta and rhymes in his &quot;Banging on the System&quot;: &quot;Every burb the same man / and we got every color / we all the same man / at least to them we are / we all immigrants&quot;.

2008 is a European Year of Intercultural Dialogue and part of this effort was a hip hop summit in Stockholm called Make it blast!, which took place on 27 May. Chaired by Timbuktu, the festival featured rappers from Sweden and elsewhere in Europe and aimed to create dialogue between artists as well as audiences of the European urban music scene.

==Notable artists==
The list of people who have made a name for themselves in Swedish hip hop can be made very long. With a few exceptions (Feven, Melinda Wrede, Remedeeh) Acts that have had some international success include LE SINNER, Rebstar, Looptroop Yung Lean, Bladee, Thaiboy Digital, Ecco2K, Max Peezay, and Million Stylez.

==Non-commercial hip-hop==
There have always been elements within the Swedish hip hop scene that has reacted against the commercial aspects of the music industry and have tried to find alternative distribution and marketing channels for the music. The Internet has had a significant impact in how media is communicated, and through various online communities people without record deals have also been able to find audiences for their music. Examples of such communities that are centered around Swedish hip hop are Frizon and Whoa.nu.

==Graffiti culture==
Graffiti is, to a large extent, seen as an art form belonging to hip hop. In the early 1980s, the American films &quot;Style Wars&quot;, &quot;Wild Style&quot; and &quot;Beat Street&quot; would have a great impact and influence many would-be artists, as would the Swedish cult classic &quot;Stockholmsnatt&quot; a few years later. The first graffiti artists in the Stockholm area had names such as Disey, Ziggy, Razor, Merley (aka Liam Norberg), Puppet and Zappo.

In 2004, the rapper Promoe had a hit with the track &quot;These Walls Don&#x27;t Lie&quot;, recorded and mixed by Soundism, which dealt with the Swedish graffiti culture, and the dangers of creating illegal art at difficult locations.

<text>Music Box is a 1989 film by Costa-Gavras that tells the story of a Hungarian-American immigrant who is accused of having been a war criminal. The plot revolves around his daughter, an attorney, who defends him, and her struggle to uncover the truth.

The film was written by Joe Eszterhas and directed by Costa-Gavras. It stars Jessica Lange, Armin Mueller-Stahl, Frederic Forrest, Donald Moffat and Lukas Haas. The film won the Golden Bear at the 40th Berlin International Film Festival.

It is loosely based on the real life case of John Demjanjuk.

According to Joe Eszterhas&#x27;s book, &quot;Hollywood Animal&quot;, Eszterhas wrote the screenplay for &quot;Music Box&quot; almost ten years before learning, at age 45, that his father, Count István Esterházy, had concealed his wartime involvement in Hungary&#x27;s Fascist and militantly racist Arrow Cross Party. According to Eszterhas, his father &quot;organized book burnings and had cranked out the vilest anti-Semitic propaganda imaginable.&quot; After this discovery, he severed all contact with his father, never reconciling before István&#x27;s death.

Eszterhas had given his father a copy of the script to read before the movie was made, never thinking that his life would soon reflect his art.

==Plot==
Hungarian immigrant Michael J. Laszlo faces a trial and having his US citizenship revoked after being accused of war crimes during WWII. Laszlo insists it is mistaken identity. His daughter, Ann Talbot, a Chicago defence attorney, resolves to defend her father in court.

Prosecuting attorney Jack Burke of the Office of Special Investigations claims that the supposedly upstanding and affable family man, Laszlo, is &quot;Mishka,&quot; the former commander of an Arrow Cross death squad. During the Siege of Budapest, Mishka&#x27;s unit sadistically tortured, raped, and murdered scores of Hungarian Jews, Roma, and their Gentile protectors. Meanwhile, Laszlo&#x27;s bank accounts reveal large payments to Tibor Zoldan, a fellow Hungarian immigrant. Laszlo claims these were unpaid loans to a destitute friend who had been recently killed in a hit-and-run car accident.

At the hearings the few survivors give grisly testimony describing the crimes committed by Mishka&#x27;s unit. All identify Laszlo as their torturer. Equally damning is an authenticated Arrow Cross identification card bearing Laszlo&#x27;s photograph and the name, &quot;Laszlo Miklos.&quot; Laszlo claims it is a frame-up by Hungary&#x27;s then Communist government and its secret police, the ÁVO. He further claims it is retaliation for his protest against the US tour of a Hungarian dance troupe several years earlier.

Ann locates a Soviet defector who testifies about the KGB&#x27;s program of flawlessly forging documents to frame anti-Communists in the West. The defector further explains that this technique was shared with every secret police service in the Soviet Bloc. He says that the Hungarian ÁVO was interested in this tactic. This revelation, combined with Ann&#x27;s questioning the reliability of witnesses still living under a police state, throws Burke&#x27;s case into serious doubt.

Burke announces a witness will testify that Laszlo is &quot;Mishka.&quot; The infirm witness is unable to leave Budapest, so Ann, Burke, and Judge Irwin Silver travel to Hungary. Laszlo refuses to go, claiming Communists will assassinate him if he returns. Before Ann&#x27;s departure her legal assistant provides more details about Tibor and believes he was blackmailing Laszlo.

In Budapest a mysterious man claiming to be Laszlo&#x27;s friend visits Ann at her hotel and leaves her a folder of documents. The next day, after hearing the witnesses&#x27; damning testimony, Ann produces the documents — signed past affidavits in which witnesses identified three different men as &quot;Mishka.&quot;

Judge Silver then dismisses the prosecution&#x27;s case. A dejected Burke says that, while it is too late to save the victims, it is important to remember what happened to them, and claims Ann is denying the truth. He urges her to visit the bridge where Mishka threw his victims into the Danube River. During that time, the Red Army was storming Berlin and the war was effectively over, yet Hungarians were still massacring Jews. Ann reacts angrily to his suggestion.

As Ann is driven back to her hotel, the taxi crosses the Széchenyi Lánchíd bridge, where Mishka&#x27;s executions took place. Ann asks the driver to stop, then gets out to view the site. Later, she visits Magda Zoldan, Tibor&#x27;s sister, who lives in Budapest. Magda mentions that the Chicago Police Department sent her Tibor&#x27;s wallet. She produces a pawn shop ticket taken from it and implores Ann to retrieve whatever Tibor pawned and send it to her. Before leaving, Ann notices a photo of young Tibor with a characteristic scar on his left face; she realises he was Mischka&#x27;s Arrow Cross partner in the atrocities that the witnesses described.

Back in Chicago, Ann goes to the pawn shop to redeem Tibor&#x27;s music box. Ann switches it on and, as it plays, old black-and-white photographs slowly emerge from the mechanism. The photos depict a youthful Laszlo in an Arrow Cross uniform—sadistically torturing and murdering Jews. Ann, visibly sickened by her father&#x27;s guilt, accuses him of being Mishka and killing Tibor. Laszlo claims the Communists have poisoned Ann against him.

In the film&#x27;s climax, Ann tells her father that she never wants herself or her son, Mikey, to see him again. Laszlo says Mikey will never believe her, then goes outside to play with his grandson. Ann composes a letter to Burke and encloses Tibor&#x27;s photographs and the negatives in the envelope. When the news of Laszlo&#x27;s suspected war crimes is reported in the news, Ann talks to Mikey about his beloved grandfather.

==Production==
This film marked the second collaboration between director Costa-Gavras and screenwriter Joe Eszterhas after 1988&#x27;s &quot;Betrayed&quot;. Both Walter Matthau and Kirk Douglas were in talks with Costa-Gavras to play the part of Mike Laszlo. Ultimately Gavras selected Armin Mueller-Stahl, who had wanted to work with Gavras since being impressed by his craft after seeing &quot;Missing&quot;. Mueller-Stahl, an East-German defector, had difficulty obtaining a U.S. visa, as he was suspected of ties to the Stasi.

Jessica Lange, who is usually a devotée of method acting, whereby you live as the character you&#x27;re playing, chose to approach her character in &quot;Music Box&quot; differently because &quot;there was nothing in my own experiences of betrayal, disappointment and heartbreak that could compare to the character&#x27;s.&quot; Instead she &quot;tried to approach it as a child approaches a game of make-believe. I did do some research into the character&#x27;s Hungarian background and I read a lot of books about the Holocaust but ultimately I relied on my own imagination. There was an ease to working this way, an effortlessness.&quot;

Principal photography for the film started on location in Chicago, then moved to Budapest, Hungary, as Gavras wanted authenticity in some of the key Hungarian scenes.

The final moments of the film feature a song by Márta Sebestyén, &quot;Mária altatója&quot;.

==Critical reception==
Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film a lukewarm two star review. Among his complaints were that the film was &quot;not about guilt or innocence; it is a courtroom thriller, with all of the usual automatic devices like last-minute evidence and surprise witnesses&quot; and that &quot;Nazism is used only as a plot device, as a convenient way to make a man into a monster without having to spend much time convincing us of it.&quot; Foremost was his frustration that little attempt was made to understand Mike Laszlo, and that &quot;the old man, who should be the central character if this movie took itself seriously, is only a pawn.&quot;

Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; was even more critical of the film, doubting it existed for any purpose other than to get Jessica Lange an Oscar nomination, bluntly stating &quot;real-life tragedy has been used to hype cheap melodrama. It&#x27;s more than offensive; it&#x27;s vile.&quot;

Caryn James of &quot;The New York Times&quot; applauded Jessica Lange&#x27;s performance, but had to admit that &quot;Ms. Lange comes as close to inventing a character out of thin air as any screen actor can. Nothing in Joe Eszterhas&#x27;s overblown script or in Costa-Gavras&#x27;s simplistic direction begins to support it. In the end, not even Ms. Lange&#x27;s profuse energy and intelligence can redeem the film&#x27;s unremitting shallowness and mediocrity.&quot; James felt that &quot;Music Box&quot; &quot;finally tells us nothing about wronged innocence or monstrous evil.&quot;

Holocaust survivor and Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel was complimentary of the film; according to the &quot;New York Times&quot; he &quot;found it very moving...a welcome addition to the cinematic literature of the Holocaust.&quot; Wiesel stated that &quot;The television series &#x27;Holocaust&#x27; was kitsch; this is not. This is a good work of art, a good work of sensitizing viewers.&quot;

On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a rating of 76% from 21 reviews.

<text>The Fabulous Baker Boys is a 1989 American romantic comedy drama musical film written and directed by Steve Kloves. The film follows a piano act consisting of two brothers, who hire an attractive female singer to help revive their waning career. After a period of success, complications ensue when the younger brother develops romantic feelings for the singer. Brothers Jeff Bridges and Beau Bridges star as the eponymous Baker Boys, while Michelle Pfeiffer plays lounge singer Susie Diamond.

&quot;The Fabulous Baker Boys&quot; was Kloves&#x27;s directorial debut and second screenplay. He conceived the story based on Ferrante &amp; Teicher, a piano duo he had grown up watching perform on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, which inspired him to write a film about working class musicians who are also siblings. Determined to direct the film himself, Kloves sold the script to producers Paula Weinstein and Mark Rosenberg. It was subsequently rotated among several production companies before it was ultimately obtained by 20th Century Fox in 1986. Pfeiffer underwent several months of voice training to perform all of her character&#x27;s songs, which largely consist of jazz and pop standards. While both Bridges brothers play their instruments on camera, their audio was dubbed by the film&#x27;s composer, Dave Grusin, and musician John F. Hammond, respectively. Although primarily set in Seattle, Washington, the film was shot mostly in Los Angeles, California, from December 1988 to March 1989.

&quot;The Fabulous Baker Boys&quot; was released on October 13, 1989 to critical acclaim, but underperformed at the box office. The National Board of Review named it one of the year&#x27;s 10 best films. Reviewers praised Pfeiffer&#x27;s performance in particular, often selecting her rendition of &quot;Makin&#x27; Whoopee&quot; on top of a grand piano as a standout. The scene is considered to be one of the sexiest in film history, according to several media publications. The film was nominated for four Academy Awards at the 62nd Academy Awards: Best Actress (for Pfeiffer), Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing, and Best Original Score. Pfeiffer won nearly every acting award for which she was nominated during the 1989–1990 awards season, including the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama, but lost the Academy Award to Jessica Tandy.

==Plot==
The Fabulous Baker Boys are a piano duo consisting of brothers Jack and Frank Baker. For 15 years, they have been performing show tunes in bars and lounges throughout Seattle, Washington on a pair of matching grand pianos. While Frank dutifully serves as the duo&#x27;s manager, Jack has grown weary of the hackneyed material they have come to perform over the years, but his complacency leaves him uninspired to pursue his talents further. Apart from occasionally playing the music he enjoys at a local jazz club, Jack&#x27;s personal life largely consists of meaningless one-night stands; caring for his aging Labrador, Eddie; and spending time with Nina, a lonely girl from his apartment building whose single mother neglects her in favor of romantic pursuits.

Concerned about a sudden decrease in stable gigs and loss of income, Frank decides to hire a female singer to revive interest in their act. After auditioning 37 unsuccessful candidates, they meet Susie Diamond, a former escort who demands an audition despite being several minutes late. Although initially at odds with Frank over her boldness and unprofessionalism, Susie impresses both brothers with her audition, and they hire her. Their debut performance as a trio is flawed but ultimately well-received, and the rebranded act gradually receives better gigs and higher salaries in return.

The now in-demand trio is booked for an extended engagement at a luxurious resort. Jack and Susie flirt with each other cautiously in-between gigs, but neither acts upon their feelings. Noticing a growing attraction between them, Frank forbids Jack from pursuing Susie in fear that a relationship between the two would compromise the group&#x27;s stability and newfound success. Frank returns to Seattle prematurely when one of his children suffers a minor injury. Taking advantage of his absence to contemporize their setlist, Susie and Jack deliver a sultry performance of &quot;Makin&#x27; Whoopee&quot; during the hotel&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s Eve festivities, after which they finally succumb to their feelings and sleep together. Susie opens up to Jack about her past as an escort, but Jack remains emotionally distant.

When the couple returns to Seattle, Frank quickly deduces that Jack and Susie have slept with each other; tensions arise when both rebel against Frank&#x27;s creative control and song choices. After spending another night with Jack, Susie tells him she has received a lucrative job offer to record television jingles for cat food, which would require her to leave the group. Jack is quietly heartbroken that Susie would even consider leaving but refuses to admit how he truly feels, instead acting as though her departure is of no concern to him. Susie accepts the job after a final performance with The Fabulous Baker Boys, and the two part ways following a heated argument in which Susie accuses Jack of being a coward in his pursuits of both her and his career.

Jack and Frank quarrel about the increasingly humiliating gigs Frank has been booking them due to Susie&#x27;s departure, which Frank blames Jack for. After nearly breaking Frank&#x27;s hand during a physical altercation, Jack quits the band. He takes his frustrations out on Nina upon returning home but apologizes soon afterward, learning she will rely on him less once her mother marries her newest boyfriend. Now prepared to venture out on his own, Jack visits Frank to make amends. Having opted to offer piano lessons from his home, Frank accepts Jack&#x27;s decision to pursue a solo career and explains he thought he was helping his younger brother live a carefree life, of which he was sometimes jealous. They reminisce about the early days of their act with a final duet.

Jack visits Susie, who is not particularly enjoying her new job, and expresses regret about his behavior towards her. Susie is not quite ready to resume their relationship but the two part as friends, with Jack telling her he has a feeling they will see each other again. Jack watches as Susie walks off to her new job until she is nearly out of sight.

=== Writing and development ===
Screenwriter Steve Kloves was inspired to write &quot;The Fabulous Baker Boys&quot; based on Ferrante &amp; Teicher, a piano duo he had grown up watching perform on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; during the 1960s. He found himself fascinated by &quot;blue-collar entertainment – people who work in the arts in a kind of working class way.&quot; Remembering that during his childhood parents typically enrolled their children in piano lessons simply to &quot;give them culture&quot;, he decided to write a story about piano-playing brothers, citing familial dysfunction as a common theme among his work. Although he felt a story about a waning piano act would provide strong material for a feature-length film, some of Kloves&#x27;s peers warned him &quot;it was a completely bizarre, terrible idea for a movie&quot;, expressing concerns that its dark subject matter and frequent arguments would not translate well on screen. Kloves conducted little research while penning the film, instead opting to write its first draft based on what he learned from spending time in hotels. Kloves recalled that he would sometimes visit hotel bars &quot;and hear some guy play the piano ... and some of them were pretty good. The way my mind tripped off on it was that this guy&#x27;s parents gave him piano lessons to improve his life and give him an opening into culture and there he was, 20 years later, at a Holiday Inn playing &#x27;Feelings&#x27;.&quot; Since Kloves typically writes his films around its characters, he spent six months writing notes about the main characters&#x27; relationships with each other before finalizing the story. He also used index cards to indicate specific scenes and moments which he organized on a board, but found this approach was not always successful.

A first draft of the screenplay was completed as early as April 1985, in which Kloves describes the titular characters as &quot;a poor man&#x27;s version of Ferrante and Teicher.&quot; &quot;The Fabulous Baker Boys&quot; was Kloves&#x27;s directorial debut. Kloves&#x27;s experience writing his previous film, &quot;Racing with the Moon&quot; (1984), motivated him to direct &quot;The Fabulous Baker Boys&quot; himself because the final version of the former &quot;wasn&#x27;t what I saw in my head&quot;. Although Kloves had always aspired to direct the film himself, he considered his prospects unlikely due to his young age (he was 25 years-old when he first started optioning the script to filmmakers) and lack of filmmaking experience, having only written one film prior. Fearing a different director would struggle to fulfill his vision, his determination ultimately delayed the project by several years. Kloves decided to keep the script to himself until he could secure funding that would also allow him to direct his own project. Kloves finally sold &quot;The Fabulous Baker Boys&quot; as a spec script to then-Warner Bros. worldwide production president Mark Rosenberg, after originally selling it to producers Paula Weinstein and Gareth Wigan of WW Productions. Weinstein and Wigan eventually negotiated a deal to share the film rights with Rosenberg.

Kloves attempted to work on the film with director George Roy Hill, but they experienced creative differences. Following the dissolution of WW Productions, Weinstein became an executive consultant at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) under Alan Ladd, Jr., while Rosenberg eventually left Warner Bros to found Mirage Productions with filmmaker Sydney Pollack. Partnering with Mirage, Weinstein briefly relocated &quot;The Fabulous Baker Boys&quot; to MGM, only for the film to move once again to 20th Century Fox following Ladd, Jr.&#x27;s departure from MGM. Kloves attributes his struggles with getting the film made to Warner Bros.&#x27; reluctance to release the film&#x27;s rights to a different studio &quot;and watch it be a success for someone else&quot;, despite Warner Bros. disinterest in producing the film themselves. Pollack was retained as an executive producer. Kloves credits Rosenberg, Pollack, and Weinstein with helping him earn approval to direct the film, having been fans of his previous work. The film&#x27;s development began in 1986, and was completed over the course of four years, the length of which &quot;The New York Times&quot; journalist Bernard Weinraub attributed to the film&#x27;s melancholy nature and Kloves&#x27;s insistence on directing. Kloves&#x27;s final draft of his screenplay is dated November 4, 1988.

=== Casting ===
When casting &quot;The Fabulous Baker Boys&quot; began, Kloves recalled that while studio executives often dismissed his script as &quot;dreary and depressing&quot;, most actors considered for the film found it &quot;funny and moving&quot;. Wallis Nicita was the film&#x27;s casting director. Bill Murray briefly expressed interest in starring while the film was in early development. The studio had also considered casting Murray&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; castmate, comedian Chevy Chase, as either Jack or Frank Baker, despite both actors having little musical experience. Brothers Dennis and Randy Quaid were offered the titular roles but turned them down. Although both Jeff and Pfeiffer were Kloves&#x27;s first choices for their respective roles, he was initially reluctant to cast Beau, despite Jeff&#x27;s suggestion. 
Kloves, Rosenberg, and Weinstein personally visited Jeff Bridges at his home in Montana to offer him the role of Jack Baker. After spending an afternoon asking Kloves various questions about the film, Jeff accepted because &quot;I&#x27;ve had very good luck with first-time directors.&quot; Shortly after being cast, Jeff suggested his own older brother Beau Bridges for the role of Jack&#x27;s older brother Frank. Initially reluctant to entertain the &quot;gimmick&quot; of casting brothers as on-screen siblings, Kloves relented upon meeting Beau for the first time at a restaurant. According to Kloves, &quot;I saw Beau walk into the restaurant, and it just hit me – he was Frank Baker. By the end of the breakfast I decided to embrace it, and it&#x27;s one of the better decisions I made, because at the end of the day it wasn&#x27;t a gimmick – Beau was terrific.&quot; Beau recalled that the studio had wanted a more famous actor to play the elder Baker, but Jeff lobbied for him. After sharing the script with him and insisting that he read it, Beau was worried that the studio&#x27;s resistance to cast him would threaten Jeff&#x27;s prospects. Jeff encouraged Beau to show the studio a Polaroid of both brothers performing street theatre when they were teenagers. Beau believes the photograph solidified his casting. Jeff believes acting opposite his brother helped make their characters&#x27; relationship and chemistry more convincing to audiences. Because Beau&#x27;s character is balding in the script, Jeff shaved a bald patch onto the back of Beau&#x27;s head for the film. &quot;The Fabulous Baker Boys&quot; was the first and only time Jeff and Beau appeared in the same film.

While the film was under Hill&#x27;s direction, Kloves suggested singer Whitney Houston for the female lead. Although Jeff believes he was the first actor cast in the film, Michelle Pfeiffer claims Kloves originally approached her five years before the film was made, but the studio was not interested in casting her at the time. Kloves clarified that although he had been interested in both Pfeiffer and Jeff from the beginning, Pfeiffer proved difficult to contact at the time, therefore he cast Jeff first in the interim. Without an actress secured for the female lead, both the cast and crew were momentarily concerned about the film&#x27;s progress. Several actresses were considered for the role of lounge singer Susie Diamond, including Jodie Foster, Jennifer Jason Leigh, and Debra Winger. Singer Madonna turned down the role because she found the film &quot;too mushy&quot;.

Despite liking the script, Pfeiffer was hesitant to commit to another film due to having just recently completed several prestigious projects in a row. She had originally planned to go on hiatus after filming &quot;Dangerous Liaisons&quot; (1988) until Kloves convinced her otherwise over the course of visiting her at her home for a week. Drawn to the character of Susie, the actress described her as &quot;one of the most alive characters that I&#x27;ve played ... She&#x27;s a purely emotional creature ... She&#x27;s not afraid to take risks, and she doesn&#x27;t lie to herself ... There&#x27;s a purity in her honesty that I really respect.&quot; Kloves recalled that some of his peers were surprised by his choice in Pfeiffer because they doubted her comedic acting abilities, but the director maintains that &quot;she was always funny and adept at doing character humor.&quot; Pfeiffer reminded Rosenberg of Marilyn Monroe&#x27;s performance in &quot;Some Like it Hot&quot; (1959). Pfeiffer was initially worried about working opposite a pair of brothers but admitted her concerns were ultimately unfounded. Kloves wrote the character of Blanche &quot;Monica&quot; Moran, a waitress and aspiring singer, specifically for Jennifer Tilly, which would become her breakthrough role.

=== Filming ===
A two-week rehearsal took place after the film was cast, during which Kloves observed each main cast member discover how they would approach their respective roles. Kloves was particularly impressed with Beau&#x27;s process, explaining, &quot;in the first week of rehearsal he went back and forth between being very high and very low ... [by] ... the second week he suddenly found the sweet spot for the character and stayed there with perfect pitch for the entire shoot.&quot; Kloves and the three main actors visited local bars to study lounge performers, while Kloves directed improvisational sessions at the Bridges&#x27; homes. Both Jeff and Beau had piano keyboards in their dressing rooms and spent several months learning to play the film&#x27;s songs during pre-production, specifically studying how their musical performances should appear to onlookers. Jeff did not attend the 1988 London Film Festival where he was being honored due to his commitment to filming &quot;The Fabulous Baker Boys&quot;. Before production began, Pfeiffer was warned that preparing for Susie would require twice as much effort as a typical acting performance, likening the process to &quot;a musician preparing to do an album.&quot; On camera, Pfeiffer lip-synced to the songs she recorded in the recording studio.

Principal photography began on December 5, 1988, and was completed over the course of two months by March 1989. The film had a production budget of $11.5 million. Although primarily set in Seattle, Washington, &quot;The Fabulous Baker Boys&quot; was mostly filmed in Los Angeles, California. Kloves consulted with production designer Jeffery Townsend to retain the melancholy Seattle atmosphere on the Los Angeles set. Some scenes were shot at the Ambassador Hotel, with its Cocoanut Grove nightclub being used for several nighttime scenes. The hotel itself was permanently closed in 1989, shortly after filming concluded. The Greystone Mansion was used for several exterior shots. The Millennium Biltmore Hotel also served as a location for some of the film&#x27;s interior scenes and musical sequences, including &quot;Makin&#x27; Whoopee&quot;, which was shot in its Crystal Ballroom. Pfeiffer was originally hesitant to film the scene in which her character sings &quot;Makin&#x27; Whoopee&quot; on top of Jack&#x27;s grand piano. Fearing audiences would find her laughable, she attempted to talk her way out of the scene the day before it was shot, but Kloves persisted. The sequence was choreographed by Peggy Holmes, her first solo choreographing job. Pfeiffer received only one choreography lesson in preparation for the musical number, and wore knee and elbow pads during rehearsals. The scene ultimately required six hours to film; trying to appear graceful atop the slippery piano surface proved challenging for Pfeiffer, particularly when she steps down from the piano onto its keys without looking down at her feet. Wanting Susie&#x27;s wardrobe to accurately depict clothes she could realistically afford, costume designer Lisa Jensen sourced most of Pfeiffer&#x27;s costumes from discount and vintage clothing stores throughout California, for less than $100 each. Although Pfeiffer&#x27;s character is intended to appear sexy, Jensen opted not to simply rely on revealing clothing but rather play &quot;hide and seek&quot; with her body, explaining that Susie avoids clothes that are &quot;obviously sexy&quot;. Pfeiffer&#x27;s red evening gown worn during the &quot;Makin&#x27; Whoopee&quot; scene was the only dress Jensen designed herself. Fashion designer Ronaldus Shamask designed the black cocktail dress purchased for Susie&#x27;s first performance, which Jensen tailored to appear skin-tight on Pfeiffer.

Kloves told cinematographer Michael Ballhaus that, aesthetically, he had envisioned the film as an Edward Hopper painting: &quot;I always saw the movie in terms of the burnished red of the booths, a kind of dark crimson with amber light and a slightly threadbare quality, like the surroundings are all going to seed a bit.&quot; Ballhaus also helped determine the actors&#x27; blocking for certain scenes. Ballhaus claims Kloves allowed him &quot;complete freedom&quot; over filming because Kloves does not consider himself to be a visual director. Ballhaus decided to use &quot;deliberately ugly&quot; lighting during the film&#x27;s early scenes in undesirable venues and gradually improve the lighting by the time the characters arrive at the resort. Kloves and Ballhaus also favored simple camera movements and opted to reserve dramatic camera movements for stand-out scenes that required higher energy, such as &quot;Makin&#x27; Whoopee&quot;. Having developed a reputation for filming women, Ballhaus incorporated his signature 360-degree camera rotation into Pfeiffer&#x27;s scene, which he had envisioned upon first reading the script due to its sexually suggestive nature. Feeling the scene warranted a firmer, stronger appearance from Pfeiffer, the cinematographer also prepared by watching several of her films and consulting with her makeup artist. They rehearsed the scene using a video camera prior to filming the final version.

Jeff instructed his makeup artist to paint broken capillaries onto his nose every morning to demonstrate his character&#x27;s alcoholism. Jeff and Beau choreographed their climactic fight scene themselves, drawing inspiration from their father&#x27;s childhood lessons. Much of the fight was improvised, including the moment Jack threatens to break Frank&#x27;s hand so he can no longer play the piano. While Jeff believes they had neglected to choose a safe word should either of them become truly injured while fighting, Beau claims his brother ignored their safe word to the point where Beau visited the hospital because he thought he had really broken his hand. Jeff explained that although he had heard Beau screaming in pain, he thought he was simply acting the scene very well. The actors also suffered discomfort from the barbs of the wire fence they thrashed themselves against, which they had originally thought would be a comfortable material.

=== Music ===

Musician Dave Grusin composed the film&#x27;s original score. The score largely consists of jazz music and pop standards, most of which were performed by Grusin on keyboards with tenor saxophonist Ernie Watts, guitarist Lee Ritenour, trumpeter Sal Marquez, bassist Brian Bromberg, and drummer Harvey Mason. The music was recorded at Sunset Sound Recorders in Hollywood, California in Studio 1. Pfeiffer performed all of her own vocals for her character and the film&#x27;s soundtrack. Kloves described Pfeiffer&#x27;s singing voice as good but not &quot;professionally great&quot;, believing a more professional-sounding singer would have made the film unrealistic. Despite having sung in the musical film &quot;Grease 2&quot; (1982), Pfeiffer was never a professional singer, and found the songs in &quot;The Fabulous Baker Boys&quot; challenging because they are &quot;written to showcase the voice ... so [she] had to retrain the way I listen to music&quot; to sound as though she was singing live, accompanied by only two pianos. Pfeiffer had not sung on camera since &quot;Grease 2&quot; seven years prior. To strengthen her vocal chords, the actress enrolled in voice lessons for two months under vocal coach Sally Stevens. Stevens was personally recruited by Grusin, with whom she had collaborated several times prior.

&quot;The Fabulous Baker Boys&quot; was Stevens&#x27;s first professional vocal coaching job, therefore much of her coaching was instinctual. Stevens believes Grusin &quot;thought that in my career I had done what the Susie Diamond character had done and that Michelle, consciously or unconsciously, would pick up some things.&quot; Observing that Pfeiffer naturally possesses a strong sense of rhythm and phrasing, Stevens worked with Pfeiffer to finesse her pronunciation. The film consists of 27 songs, at least four of which are performed by Pfeiffer, including &quot;More Than You Know&quot;, &quot;Ten Cents A Dance&quot;, &quot;Makin&#x27; Whoopee&quot; and &quot;My Funny Valentine&quot;. The actress was mostly unfamiliar with &quot;The Fabulous Baker Boys&quot;″ selection of Tin Pan Alley standards, thus she studied the works of jazz singers Sarah Vaughan, Dinah Washington, Rickie Lee Jones, Billie Holiday, and Helen Merrill for inspiration. According to Kloves, these songs were selected because he found them accurate to the film&#x27;s time period, lounge setting, and characters. &quot;More Than You Know&quot; required at least 20 takes until Pfeiffer was satisfied with her performance, for which she specifically drew inspiration from singer Linda Ronstadt&#x27;s rendition. Her recording sessions often lasted 10 hours, after which she would study her tapes at home. Despite this, Pfeiffer&#x27;s rendition of &quot;More Than You Know&quot; is not included on the soundtrack album, which only features two of Pfeiffer&#x27;s solos: &quot;Makin&#x27; Whoopee&quot; and &quot;My Funny Valentine&quot;. After the film&#x27;s release, Pfeiffer was offered a recording contract for her musical efforts but declined. Most of Jeff and Beau&#x27;s piano playing was dubbed for the final film, despite both actors knowing how to play the piano. They worked with a teacher to learn all of the film&#x27;s songs in order to film close-ups of their hands and faces. Grusin dubbed Jeff, while John F. Hammond dubbed Beau. Hammond also coached and produced some of Pfeiffer&#x27;s vocals. Jeff said his work on &quot;The Fabulous Baker Boys&quot; has ultimately increased his standards when it comes pursuing future musical projects.

The film&#x27;s motion picture soundtrack was released on January 1, 1989. Reviewing the album, music critic Scott Yanow wrote that Pfeiffer &quot;does a credible job singing&quot; with both of her solos, while Encyclopedia.com contributor Victoria Price said &quot;Grusin successfully mirrors the feel of the sexy standards performed by Michele Pfeiffer&quot;. The soundtrack peaked at 97 on the &quot;Billboard 200&quot;. According to a survey conducted by &quot;Billboard&quot;, &quot;The Fabulous Baker Boys&quot; was the fifth best-selling jazz album of 1989.

== Themes ==
&quot;The Fabulous Baker Boys&quot; is a character study. In the book &quot;Virtue and Vice in Popular Film&quot;, author Joseph H. Kupfer identified sibling love, conflict, artistry, and survival among topics the film explores. In a review of the film, Alan Jones of &quot;Radio Times&quot; described &quot;The Fabulous Baker Boys&quot; as a &quot;salute to family, romance, friends and disillusionment&quot;. According to Pfeiffer, the film is largely about people following their dreams. She identified Susie as an adventurous character who embraces life and is therefore unlikely to &quot;do one thing—including being a singer—for the rest of her life&quot;, whereas Jack &quot;thinks when he turns a corner that a bus is going to run over him&quot;, serving as his &quot;mirror image&quot;. Pfeiffer also identified the character Nina as a clue to Susie&#x27;s own upbringing. Frank Calvillo of Cinapse wrote that Jack, Susie and Frank &quot;have all been through the [w]ringer of life in one way or another and have the scars to prove it. Yet they each retain a mixture of despair and hope throughout in their own quiet ways.&quot;
The group&#x27;s dynamic changes once Susie is introduced and The Fabulous Baker Boys become a trio. According to the film&#x27;s blurb on the Golden Globe Awards website, &quot;Susie becomes the agent that makes them re-evaluate where they are going, and how honest they have been with each other.&quot; Calvillo believes that while Jack and Frank are cynical and optimistic, respectively, Susie is pragmatic. Jack and Frank also have opposing views on their lives, careers, and Susie. Moira Macdonald of &quot;The Seattle Times&quot; wrote that, although Jack and Susie are the film&#x27;s romantic couple, its true love story is between Jack and Frank. &quot;Film Threat&quot; said, with Susie, &quot;there&#x27;s no heart of gold. There&#x27;s just a heart, one that keeps Jack at highway&#x27;s length, merely working with him at first, but soon enough the attraction happens, though in an atypical way because these two are atypical. It&#x27;s not easy and it&#x27;s not love because this isn&#x27;t the kind of movie for that.&quot; Turner Classic Movie&#x27;s biography of Beau reported that several critics perceived his performance as &quot;partly autobiographical&quot;. Film critic Roger Ebert believes &quot;There&#x27;s probably some autobiographical truth lurking beneath the rivalry of the Bridges brothers, old wounds from the 20 years they have both been working in the movies.&quot;

While Macdonald considered Seattle to be as much of a main character as the film&#x27;s cast, Calvillo argues that the city &quot;could be any cold metropolis, and with the exception of cars, hairstyles, and fashion, there&#x27;s really no telling when the movie actually takes place.&quot; Observing that much has changed about the city since the film&#x27;s initial release, Macdonald concluded that &quot;The Fabulous Baker Boys&quot; serves as &quot;a time capsule, for Seattle and for me ... Seattle and I aren&#x27;t the same anymore, but &#x27;The Fabulous Baker Boys&#x27; — elegantly and forever frozen in time — reminds us of who we were.&quot; &quot;Film Threat&quot; credited Ballhaus&#x27;s cinematography with &quot;mak[ing] Seattle as alive as the characters, as active as their desires&quot;, whereas Jack walking through Seattle represents &quot;the feeling of an entire city, of everyone doing whatever they do, and the sun rises, and sets, and the cycle continues, the same cycle for others as it is for Jack.&quot;

Identifying Kloves as an heir to New Hollywood directors Bob Rafelson or Peter Bogdanovich, Paula Vazquez Prieto of &quot;La Nación&quot; described &quot;The Fabulous Baker Boys&quot; as the director&#x27;s attempt to &quot;revitalize the memory of jazz repertoire musicals, the appeal of those characters on the margins of fame, the melancholy of a city like Seattle, the value of the story in the heart of the mainstream.&quot; &quot;Slant Magazine&quot;&#x27;s Chuck Bowen considers the film to be a lesser-known example of the film noir genre due to its depiction of &quot;dream worlds that offer portraits of estrangement and economic frustration&quot;, in which Seattle &quot;is rendered ... as a surreal realm that appears to have been ported in nearly unchanged from the backlots of the thrillers and studio musicals of the 1930s and 1940s.&quot; Similarly, Stefan Milne of the &quot;Seattle Metropolitan&quot; wrote that the film resembles &quot;1940s Hollywood romance and glamour&quot; despite its 1980s setting. Describing &quot;The Fabulous Baker Boys&quot; as potentially &quot;the loneliest mainstream American movie since &quot;In a Lonely Place&quot;&quot;, Bowen credits the director with &quot;fashioning something that&#x27;s conscious of its artistic heritage without scanning as self-conscious, like most neo-noirs. This is the key to the film&#x27;s considerable emotional pull, as you&#x27;re allowed to give yourself over to the narrative&#x27;s purplish pathos without feeling as if you&#x27;re being set up for an elaborate, ironic joke&quot;. The critic likened some of Kloves&#x27;s dialogue to classic Hollywood films &quot;Mildred Pierce&quot; (1945) and &quot;Sweet Smell of Success&quot; (1957).

==Release==

=== Box office ===
Prior to its release, the film received significant press for the idea of Pfeiffer playing a former sex worker and the novelty of the Bridges brothers portraying brothers on-screen. &quot;The Fabulous Baker Boys&quot; was released on October 13, 1989 in 858 theaters, grossing $3,313,815 during its opening weekend. Tickets initially sold well in New York, Chicago and Los Angeles due to strong word of mouth. Originally released in over 800 theatres during its opening weekend, 20th Century Fox head of distribution Tom Sherak informed Kloves the following Monday that the studio would be removing the film from most of these theatres by the following weekend.

&quot;The Fabulous Baker Boys&quot; would go on to earn $18.4 million worldwide against its $11.5 million budget. Despite its mediocre box office performance, the film proved to be a major top-seller once released on home video, for a period trailing behind the &quot;Back to the Future&quot; franchise in terms of popularity. According to a poll conducted by &quot;Billboard&quot;, &quot;The Fabulous Baker Boys&quot; was the second most rented home video in July 1990. AllMovie contributor Aubry Anne D&#x27;Arminio attributes the film&#x27;s home video achievements to positive word-of-mouth following its four Academy Award nominations. The film was released to DVD on August 21, 1998.

=== Critical response ===
&quot;The Fabulous Baker Boys&quot; received widespread acclaim upon release. The film holds a 97% rating on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes based on 29 reviews, with an average rating of 7.7/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;Its story is nothing special, but &quot;The Fabulous Baker Boys&quot; glows beneath luminous performances from its perfectly cast stars.&quot; Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 85 out of 100 based on 25 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.
Pauline Kael of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; said &quot;The Fabulous Baker Boys&quot; defines 1980s glamour. Praising its performances, Ballhaus&#x27; camera work and Grusin&#x27;s score, Jonathan Rosenbaum of the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; wrote that the film demonstrates &quot;plenty of old-fashioned virtues&quot;. &quot;Time&quot; film critic Richard Schickel called the film &quot;a Hollywood rarity&quot;, hailing Susie and Jack&#x27;s relationship as &quot;one of the truest representations of modern romance that the modern screen has offered.&quot; Praising Kloves&#x27;s writing and directing, Schickel deemed &quot;The Fabulous Baker Boys&quot; worth of &quot;the protection only large, enthusiastic audiences can provide.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot;&#x27; Janet Maslin described &quot;The Fabulous Baker Boys&quot; as a &quot;film specializing in smoky, down-at-the-heels glamour, and in the kind of smart, slangy dialogue that sounds right without necessarily having much to say&quot;. Praising its cast, musical numbers and cinematography, Maslin felt the familiarity of its characters &quot;does nothing to make them less dazzlingly attractive&quot;, despite finding some scenes and plotlines unnecessary. Roger Ebert of &quot;The Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film three and a half stars out of a possible four, writing that while the romantic-rivals in showbiz premise had been utilized in film for decades, &quot;intriguing casting&quot; and a &quot;sure hand for the material&quot; elevated &quot;The Fabulous Baker Boys&quot; above cliches. Desson Howe of &quot;The&quot; &quot;Washington Post&quot; was complimentary towards both the leads&#x27; performances and Ballhaus&#x27; lighting. Praising the performances of Pfeiffer and Jeff, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; film critic Sheila Benson called &quot;The Fabulous Baker Boys&quot; &quot;as salty and sexy and unhousebroken a movie as you could hope to find&quot;, while film critic Emanuel Levy lauded Kloves&#x27;s direction, crediting it with bolstering each cast member&#x27;s performance.

Pfeiffer received universal acclaim for her performance, with several reviewers commenting on her physical appearance and sex appeal. Maslin called Pfeiffer an unexpected but &quot;electrifyingly right&quot; choice for the role. Film critic Roger Ebert labeled &quot;The Fabulous Baker Boys&quot; &quot;one of the movies they will use as a document, years from now, when they begin to trace the steps by which Pfeiffer became a great star ... This is the movie of her flowering - not just as a beautiful woman, but as an actress with the ability to make you care about her, to make you feel what she feels.&quot; Ebert also compared Pfeiffer&#x27;s performance to those by actresses Rita Hayworth and Marilyn Monroe. Writing for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Rita Kempley described Pfeiffer as &quot;slinky and cynical, more Bacall than Bacall. Like the sun through a magnifying glass, she burns an image on the screen.&quot; Awarding Pfeiffer the title ”sexiest woman in the movies”, Steve Simels of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; credited her performance with salvaging the film, with which he was otherwise unimpressed. Hailing Pfeiffer as &quot;the sexiest presence in movies today and an exceptional comic and dramatic actress,&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; film critic Peter Travers felt the film would simply &quot;evaporate&quot; without Pfeiffer, concluding, &quot;make no mistake: It&#x27;s Michelle Pfeiffer who puts the &#x27;fabulous&#x27; into Baker Boys.&quot;

Both Jeff and Beau&#x27;s performances were also widely praised. Schickel called the actors &quot;better than fabulous - Jeff not quite falling over the line into unredeemable cynicism, Beau never succumbing to the pull of moral blandness.&quot; Writing for &quot;The Buffalo News,&quot; Jeff Simon said &quot;Pfeiffer is so sensationally alluring [that it] might blind you to how good the Bridges brothers are&quot;, particularly praising Beau&#x27;s performance. Maslin felt Beau was provided with his own &quot;chance to shine&quot;, embodying &quot;the seniority Frank needs to keep the unruly, undependable Jack in line&quot;, while Kempley declared Jeff&#x27;s performance the best of his career. Despite feeling the film is &quot;hardly original&quot;, &quot;Time Out&quot; described the Bridges as &quot;a superb double act&quot;, writing Jeff particularly &quot;manages with very sparse dialogue to convey a wealth of information about a less than sympathetic character&quot;.

Although &quot;Variety&quot; felt nothing is particularly original about the film, they praised the cast and Kloves&#x27;s direction, predicting Pfeiffer&#x27;s performance of &quot;Makin&#x27; Whoopee&quot; will be remembered for years to come. Although Hilary Mantel of &quot;The Spectator&quot; praised the film&#x27;s music, performances and dialogue, she felt the film lacked content and plot, concluding, &quot;its inconsequentiality soon begins to grate on the nerves.&quot; Film critic Andrew Sarris reported that, at the time of its initial release, some pundits criticized the film&#x27;s melancholy tone and ambiguous ending.

In terms of year-end placements, Ebert ranked &quot;The Fabulous Baker Boys&quot; the 19th best film of 1989, while the National Board of Review cited it among the year&#x27;s 10 best. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; declared &quot;The Fabulous Baker Boys&quot; one of the 10 best films of the 1980s.

===Accolades===
&quot;The Fabulous Baker Boys&quot; was nominated for several awards and accolades. The film was nominated for four Academy Awards at the 62nd Academy Awards in 1990: Best Actress for Pfeiffer, Best Cinematography for Ballhaus, Best Original Score for Grusin and Best Film Editing for William Steinnkamp. The film ultimately lost all four awards for which it had been nominated. 
Pfeiffer dominated the 1989-1990 awards season, winning nearly every award for which she had been nominated. In addition to the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama, Pfeiffer won the National Board of Review Award for Best Actress, the National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Actress, the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actress, the Chicago Film Critics Association Award for Best Actress and the Los Angeles Film Critics Association Award for Best Actress. At the time, she was one of only seven actresses to win a Golden Globe and all four major critics&#x27; organizations awards for a single performance. Despite being largely favored to win the Academy Award, she ultimately lost to Jessica Tandy for &quot;Driving Miss Daisy&quot;, becoming the only one of the seven actresses to not win the Academy Award for the same performance. She is also the only actor to lose the Academy Award despite winning all four major critics&#x27; awards. Film critic Emanuel Levy theorized that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences opted to award Tandy due to the actress&#x27; age and the fact that her film, &quot;Driving Miss Daisy&quot; (1989), had been nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture, while Pfeiffer&#x27;s film was not. Several critics at the time deemed Pfeiffer&#x27;s loss a surprising upset. Pfeiffer also lost the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role to Tandy.

Grusin&#x27;s soundtrack won the Grammy Award for Best Album or Original Instrumental Background Score Written for a Motion Picture or Television, while his arrangement of &quot;My Funny Valentine&quot; (sung by Pfeiffer) won the Grammy Award for Best Arrangement, Instrumental and Vocals. The film was also nominated for the Golden Globe and BAFTA Awards for Best Original Film Score, while winning the BAFTA Award for Best Sound. Kloves&#x27;s screenplay was nominated for a Writers Guild of America Award. Ballhaus won the Los Angeles Film Critics Association Award for Best Cinematography and the National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Cinematography. Beau won the National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Supporting Actor.

== Legacy ==
According to Robert Cettl, author of &quot;Sensational Movie Monologues&quot;, critics appreciated &quot;The Fabulous Baker Boys&quot; at the time of its release as an example of dedicated &quot;small picture&quot; filmmaking which they felt Hollywood had abandoned in favor of blockbuster films with high budgets. In 2007, &quot;The Guardian&quot; cited &quot;The Fabulous Baker Boys&quot; among the &quot;1000 films to see before you die&quot;. In 2008, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; named &quot;The Fabulous Baker Boys&quot; the 12th sexiest film of all time. In 2021, &quot;Time Out&quot; ranked &quot;The Fabulous Baker Boys&quot; the sixth-best romance film of all time.

The film is credited with establishing Pfeiffer as a bankable actress and leading lady in Hollywood. Ranking it the best performance of her career, GoldDerby deemed &quot;The Fabulous Baker Boys&quot; as &quot;the movie that really put [Pfeiffer] over the top&quot;, describing her character as &quot;some of the best work ever put on screen by an actress&quot;. Erin Shelly of the &quot;Arizona Daily Sun&quot; believes the film &quot;cemented Michelle Pfeiffer&#x27;s reputation as a movie star.&quot; While naming &quot;The Fabulous Baker Boys&quot; the 24th best romance film of all time, &quot;The Guardian&#x27;s&quot; Jane Graham said the film &quot;made her the biggest female film star in the world, and catapulted her to the top of every Most Desirable Female survey for most of the 90s.&quot;

The sequence in which Pfeiffer performs &quot;Makin&#x27; Whoopee&quot; atop Jeff&#x27;s grand piano has become the film&#x27;s most famous scene. The Berlin International Film Festival said the scene &quot;has gone down in film history&quot;. According to Adam White of &quot;The Telegraph&quot;, the musical number &quot;is arguably one of the most famous scenes in movie history&quot;, while &quot;The Independent&quot; Adam White called it &quot;one of cinema&#x27;s most memorable moments&quot;. The musical sequence has also been named one of the sexiest scenes in film history by several journalists and media publications. In a 2006 article, the &quot;Irish Examiner&quot; ranked it the eighth sexiest film scene. According to HBO contributor Nick Nadel, the scene has &quot;exploded into the pop culture landscape&quot; in the decades following the film&#x27;s release. Writing for Den of Geek, novelist Aliya Whiteley believes the scene &quot;immediately entered into filmic language&quot;, observing its influence on subsequent films such as &quot;Pretty Woman&quot; (1990). The sequence has been parodied and parodied in various media, including &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, &quot;Hot Shots!&quot; (1991), &quot;Shrek 2&quot; (2004), and episodes of &quot;Animaniacs&quot;. A 1992 episode of &quot;The Golden Girls&quot; features actress Rue McClanahan singing &quot;I Wanna Be Loved By You&quot; on top of a grand piano in a performance based on Pfeffer&#x27;s. McClanahan has called the episode her favorite from the sitcom. In a 2012 commercial for Topshop, actress Kate Bosworth based her rendition of &quot;Winter Wonderland&quot; on Pfeiffer&#x27;s performance of &quot;Makin&#x27; Whoopee&quot;.

According to Turner Classic Movies, Tilly&#x27;s brief appearance bolstered her career by &quot;alert[ing] critics and viewers to her comic gifts&quot; for future films. Following &quot;The Fabulous Baker Boys&quot;″ success, Kloves would direct only one more film before returning to screenwriting full-time. He became best known for writing seven films in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; film series, one of the most successful film franchises of all time. J. K. Rowling, author of the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; books, had little authority over whom would adapt her novels, but admitted to being a fan of &quot;The Fabulous Baker Boys&quot;. In the book &quot;Martini&quot;, author David Taylor credited &quot;The Fabulous Baker Boys&quot; with helping revive the appearances of martinis, cocktails, and cocktail lounges in films during the 1990s. MyNorthwest.com&#x27;s Feliks Banel called the film &quot;one of the most critically acclaimed Hollywood movies ever filmed in Seattle&quot;.

== Future ==
One year after the film&#x27;s release, Beau said &quot;there will definitely not be any follow-up&quot; to &quot;The Fabulous Baker Boys&quot;, claiming &quot;There&#x27;s not much more to say about those characters.&quot; However, the actor expressed interest in working with his brother again on a future project. During a 2014 reunion interview, Pfeiffer said she &quot;would love to see where these three people are... I don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;ll ever happen, but yeah, that would be fun&quot;. In 2021, Pfeiffer revealed she and Jeff had been persistently asking Kloves about making a sequel.

<doc id="770156" wikidata="Q1257599" url="?curid=770156" title="But I'm a Cheerleader">
<text>But I&#x27;m a Cheerleader is a 1999 American satirical teen romantic comedy film directed by Jamie Babbit in her feature directorial debut and written by Brian Wayne Peterson. Natasha Lyonne stars as Megan Bloomfield, a high school cheerleader whose parents send her to a residential in-patient conversion therapy camp to &quot;cure&quot; her lesbianism. At camp, Megan realizes that she is indeed a lesbian and, despite the &quot;therapy&quot;, comes to embrace her sexuality. The supporting cast includes Clea DuVall, RuPaul, and Cathy Moriarty.

Inspired by an article about conversion therapy and her childhood familiarity with rehabilitation programs, Babbitt used the story of a young woman finding her sexual identity to explore the social construction of gender roles and heteronormativity. The costume and set design of the film highlighted these themes by using artificial textures in intense blues and pinks.

When it was initially rated as NC-17 by the MPAA, Babbit made cuts to allow it to be re-rated as R. When interviewed in the documentary film &quot;This Film Is Not Yet Rated&quot;, she criticized the MPAA for discriminating against films with homosexual content. While the film has developed a cult following since its release, it was not well received by conservative critics of the time, who compared it unfavorably to the films of John Waters and criticized the colorful production design. The lead actors were praised for their performances, but some of the characters were described as stereotypical.

==Plot==
Seventeen-year-old high school senior Megan Bloomfield loves cheerleading and is dating Jared, a football player, but does not enjoy kissing him, instead preferring to look at her fellow cheerleaders. This, combined with her interests in vegetarianism and Melissa Etheridge, leads her parents, Peter and Nancy, and friends to suspect that she is a lesbian. Aided by ex-gay Mike, they surprise her with an intervention. She is then sent to True Directions, a two-month-long conversion therapy camp intended to convert attendees to heterosexuality via a five-step program in which they admit their homosexuality, rediscover their gender identity by performing stereotypically gender-associated tasks, find the root of their homosexuality, demystify the opposite sex, and simulate heterosexual intercourse. Upon arrival, she meets strict disciplinarian Mary J. Brown, the program&#x27;s director. Mary&#x27;s son Rock is seen throughout the film making multiple sexual overtures towards Mike and the other male campers.

During the program, Megan befriends college student Graham Eaton. Although Graham is more comfortable in her sexuality, she was forced to attend the camp or risk being disowned by her family after her stepmother caught her having sex. Megan meets several other adolescents and young adults trying to cure themselves of their homosexuality. The group&#x27;s prompting forces her to reluctantly admit her lesbianism, which contradicts her traditional religious upbringing and distresses her, so she puts every effort into becoming heterosexual. Early on in her stay, she shockingly discovers retail worker Clayton Dunn making out with a fellow male camper and varsity wrestler named Dolph. After Mike catches them in the act, Dolph is dismissed from the premises and Clayton is punished with isolation and is sent to a doghouse for a week.

Two of Mary&#x27;s former students, ex-ex-gays Larry and Lloyd Morgan-Gordon, encourage the campers to rebel against her by taking them to a local gay bar called Cocksucker, where Graham and Megan&#x27;s relationship becomes romantic. Upon discovering what they did, Mary forces all of them to picket the couple&#x27;s house, carrying placards and shouting homophobic abuse. Megan and Graham sneak away one night to have sex and begin to fall in love. When Mary discovers their escapade, Megan, now unapologetically comfortable with her sexuality, is dismissed from the premises. Graham, afraid that her continued defiance will result in her father potentially disinheriting her permanently, stays behind.

Disowned by her parents and homeless, Megan goes to stay with Larry and Lloyd, discovering that Dolph now also lives with them. The pair plan to rescue Graham and Clayton by infiltrating the graduation ceremony. While Dolph successfully coaxes Clayton away, Graham initially declines Megan&#x27;s invitation to join them. Megan then performs a cheer she composed for Graham declaring her love for her, finally winning her over, and they drive off with Dolph and Clayton. The final scene shows Peter and Nancy uncomfortably attending a PFLAG meeting to come to terms with their daughter&#x27;s homosexuality.

==Cast==
==Production==
===Background===
&quot;But I&#x27;m a Cheerleader&quot; was Babbit&#x27;s first feature film, following two short films, &quot;Frog Crossing&quot; (1996) and &quot;Sleeping Beauties&quot; (1999). Babbit and producer Andrea Sperling secured financing from Michael Burns, vice president of Prudential Insurance, after showing him the script at Sundance festival. Their one-sentence pitch was &quot;Two high-school girls fall in love at a reparative therapy camp.&quot; Burns gave an initial budget of US$500,000 which was increased to US$1 million when the film went into production.

===Conception===
Babbit, whose mother runs a halfway house called New Directions for young people with drug and alcohol problems, had wanted to make a comedy about rehabilitation and the 12-step program. After reading an article about a man who had returned from a reparative therapy camp hating himself, she decided to combine the two ideas. With girlfriend Sperling, she came up with the idea for a feature film about a cheerleader who attends reparative therapy. They wanted the main character to be a cheerleader because it is ... &quot;the pinnacle of the American dream, and the American dream of femininity.&quot; She wanted the film to represent the lesbian experience from the femme perspective, contrasting with several films of the time that represented the butch perspective (&quot;Go Fish&quot; and &quot;The Watermelon Woman&quot;). She also wanted to satirize both the religious right and the gay community. Not feeling qualified to write the script herself, Babbit brought in screenwriter and recent graduate of USC School of Cinematic Arts Brian Wayne Peterson. Peterson had experience with reparative therapy while working at a prison clinic for sex offenders. He has said that he wanted to make a film that would not only entertain people, but also anger them and encourage them to talk about the issues it raised.

===Casting===
Babbit recruited Clea DuVall, who had starred in her short film &quot;Sleeping Beauties&quot;, to play the role of Graham Eaton. She met much of the cast through DuVall, including Natasha Lyonne and Melanie Lynskey. Lyonne first saw the script in the back of DuVall&#x27;s car and contacted her agent about it; having seen and enjoyed &quot;Sleeping Beauties&quot;, she was eager to work with her. Lyonne was not the first choice for the role of Megan. Another actress had wanted to play the part but eventually turned it down due to her religious beliefs and not wanting her family to see her on the poster. Rosario Dawson was also considered for Megan, but her executive producer persuaded her that Dawson, who is Hispanic, would not be right for the All-American character.

A conscious effort was made to cast people of color in supporting roles to combat what Babbit described as &quot;racism at every level of making movies.&quot; From the beginning, she intended the characters of Mike (played by RuPaul), Dolph (Dante Basco) and Andre (Douglas Spain) to be African American, Asian and Hispanic, respectively. She initially considered Arsenio Hall for the character of Mike but Hall was uncomfortable playing a gay role. As Mike, RuPaul made a rare appearance out of drag.
===Set and costume design===
Babbit says that her influences for the look and feel of the film included John Waters, David LaChapelle, &quot;Edward Scissorhands&quot; and Barbie. She wanted the production and costume design to reflect the themes of the story. The progression from the ordinary world of Megan&#x27;s home life, where the dominant colors are muted oranges and browns, to the contrived world of True Directions with intense blues and pinks, is intended to represent the artificiality of heteronormativity. The germaphobic character of Mary Brown represents AIDS paranoia; her clean, ordered world is filled with plastic flowers, fake sky and PVC outfits. The external shots of the colorful house complete with bright pink agricultural fencing were filmed in Palmdale, California.

==Themes==
&quot;But I&#x27;m a Cheerleader&quot; contains themes of sexuality, gender roles and social conformity. Chris Holmlund in &quot;Contemporary American Independent Film&quot; notes this feature of the film and calls the costumes &quot;gender-tuned&quot;. Ted Gideonse in &quot;Out&quot; magazine wrote &quot;the costumes and colors of the film show how false the goals of True Directions are&quot;. The film provides a positive representation of LGBTQ community by casting a diverse range of characters who identify as gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender. This film has become a classic within the LGBTQ community as it helps raise awareness of the harms of conversion therapy.

==Rating and distribution==
When originally submitted to the Motion Picture Association of America rating board, &quot;But I&#x27;m a Cheerleader&quot; received an NC-17 rating. In order to get a commercially viable R rating, Babbit removed a two-second shot of Graham&#x27;s hand sweeping Megan&#x27;s clothed body, a camera pan of Megan&#x27;s body when she is masturbating, and a comment that Megan &quot;ate Graham out&quot;.

Babbit was interviewed by Kirby Dick for his 2006 documentary film &quot;This Film Is Not Yet Rated&quot;. The film argues that films with homosexual content are treated more stringently than those with only heterosexual content, and that scenes of female sexuality draw harsher criticism from the board than those of male sexuality. Babbit stated that she felt discriminated against for making a gay film. The film was rated as M (for mature audiences 15 and older) in Australia and in New Zealand, 14A in Canada, 12 in Germany and 15 in the United Kingdom.

The film premiered on September 12, 1999, at the Toronto International Film Festival and was screened in January 2000 at the Sundance Film Festival. It was shown at other international film festivals including the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras festival and the London Lesbian and Gay Film Festival.

Following its Toronto premiere, Fine Line Features acquired North American distribution rights to the film for &quot;low six figures&quot;, committing $500,000 to prints and advertisement and promising its filmmakers gross participation. However, the deal fell through in February 2000 over doubts regarding home video rights, with Lions Gate Films acquiring North American rights the following month and releasing it theatrically in the United States on July 7, 2000. The film was first released to home video by Universal Studios on October 3, 2000, and by Lions Gate on July 22, 2002. In honor of the film&#x27;s 20th anniversary, the director&#x27;s cut of &quot;But I&#x27;m a Cheerleader&quot; was released via video on demand on December 8, 2020, and on Blu-ray on June 1, 2021.

==Reception==
===Box office and audience reaction===
&quot;But I&#x27;m a Cheerleader&quot; grossed $2,595,216 worldwide. In its opening weekend, showing at four theaters, it earned $60,410 which was 2.7% of its total gross. According to Box Office Mojo, it ranked at 174 for all films released in the US in 2000 and 74 for R-rated films released that year. The film was a hit with festival audiences and received standing ovations at the San Francisco International Lesbian and Gay Film Festival. It has been described as a favorite with gay audiences and on the art house circuit.

===Critical response===
At the time of its initial release &quot;But I&#x27;m a Cheerleader&quot; polarized critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, it has an approval rating of 43% from 91 reviews, with the site&#x27;s critical consensus stating, &quot;Too broad to make any real statements, &quot;But I&#x27;m a Cheerleader&quot; isn&#x27;t as sharp as it should be, but a charming cast and surprisingly emotional center may bring enough pep for viewers looking for a light social satire.&quot; On Metacritic, it has a weighted average score of 39 out of 100 based on 30 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;. Elvis Mitchell of &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised Lyonne and DuVall for their performances. Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; described the movie as having &quot;jaunty, superficial humor&quot; that &quot;tends more to confirm homosexual stereotypes for easy laughter than to skewer the horror of [conversion therapy]&quot;. Emanuel Levy of &quot;Variety&quot; described it as a &quot;shallow, only mildly entertaining satire&quot;. Roger Ebert said &quot;It feels like an amateur night version of itself, awkward, heartfelt and sweet&quot;.

Reviews from gay media were positive, and the film has undergone a critical reassessment over time. &quot;AfterEllen.com&quot; named it &quot;one of the five best lesbian movies ever made&quot;; the site had considered the movie&#x27;s story &quot;predictable&quot; and characters &quot;stereotypical&quot; in its initial 2006 review. &quot;Curve&quot; called the film an &quot;incredible comedy&quot; that &quot;redefined lesbian film.&quot;

===Awards===
The film won the Audience Award and the Graine de Cinéphage Award at the 2000 Créteil International Women&#x27;s Film Festival. It was nominated by the Political Film Society of America for the PFS Award in the categories of Human Rights and Exposé the same year.

==Music==
Pat Irwin composed the score for &quot;But I&#x27;m a Cheerleader&quot;. The soundtrack has never been released on CD. Artists featured include Saint Etienne, Dressy Bessy, April March and RuPaul.

== Legacy ==
The music video for the 2021 song &quot;Silk Chiffon&quot; by musical group Muna with Phoebe Bridgers pays homage to &quot;But I&#x27;m a Cheerleader&quot; and features much of the film&#x27;s iconography. Guitarist Naomi McPherson said they wanted &quot;a song for kids to have their first gay kiss to.&quot;

===Musical===
In 2005, the New York Musical Theatre Festival featured a musical stage adaptation of &quot;But I&#x27;m a Cheerleader&quot; written by lyricist Bill Augustin and composer Andrew Abrams. With 18 original songs, it was directed by Daniel Goldstein and starred Chandra Lee Schwartz as Megan. It played during September 2005 at New York&#x27;s Theatre at St. Clement&#x27;s. The musical was also performed as part of MT Fest UK from February 18 to 20, 2019 at The Other Palace in London, with a cast featuring Bronté Barbé as Megan, Carrie Hope Fletcher as Graham, Jamie Muscato as Jared, Matt Henry as Mike, Ben Forster as Larry, Stephen Hogan as Lloyd and Luke Bayer as Clayton.

A production of the musical played at the Turbine Theatre in London, beginning previews February 18, 2022. It opened on February 23 and ran until April 16. It was directed by Tania Azevedo, choreographed by Alexzandra Sarmiento, and produced by Paul Taylor-Mills and Bill Kenwright in association with Adam Bialow, with lighting by Martha Godfrey. The musical returned to the Turbine Theatre later that year, running from October 7 to November 27.

Within the same year, Tharoor went to the United States to obtain an M.A. in International Relations from The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University in Medford. After obtaining his M.A. in 1976, Tharoor further obtained his Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy in 1977 and his Ph.D. in International Relations and Affairs in 1978. While he was pursuing his doctorate, Tharoor was awarded the Robert B. Stewart Prize for best student and was also the first editor of the Fletcher Forum of International Affairs. At the age of 22, he was the youngest person to receive a doctorate in the history of the Fletcher School.

==Diplomatic career==
===Beginning===
Tharoor&#x27;s career in the United Nations began in 1978 as a staff member of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in Geneva. From 1981 until 1984 he was head of the UNHCR office in Singapore, during the boat people crisis, leading the organisation&#x27;s rescue efforts at sea and succeeding in resettling a backlog of Vietnamese refugees. He also processed Polish and Acehnese refugee cases. After a further stint at the UNHCR headquarters in Geneva, during which he became the first chairman of the staff elected by UNHCR personnel worldwide, Tharoor left UNHCR. In 1989 he was appointed special assistant to the Under-Secretary-General for Special Political Affairs, the unit that later became the Peacekeeping Operations Department in New York. Until 1996, he led the team responsible for peacekeeping operations in the former Yugoslavia, spending considerable time on the ground during the civil war there.

===Assistant Secretary and Under-Secretary-General at the UN===
In 1996, Tharoor was appointed Director of Communications and Special Projects and Executive Assistant to Secretary-General Kofi Annan. In January 2001, Tharoor was appointed as Interim Head of the Department of Public Information (DPI) at the Assistant-Secretary-General level. He was subsequently confirmed as the Under-Secretary-General for Communications and Public Information (UNDPI) with effect from 1 June 2002. In this capacity, he was responsible for the United Nations&#x27; communications strategy, enhancing the image and effectiveness of the organisation. In 2003 the Secretary-General gave him the additional responsibility of United Nations Coordinator for Multilingualism. During his tenure at the UNDPI, Tharoor reformed the department and undertook a number of initiatives, ranging from organizing and conducting the first-ever UN seminar on Antisemitism, the first-ever UN seminar on Islamophobia after the 11 September attacks, and launching an annual list of &quot;Ten Under-Reported Stories the World Ought to Know about&quot;, which was last produced in 2008 by his successor.

On 9 February 2007, Tharoor resigned from the post of Under-Secretary-General and left the UN on 1 April 2007.

===Campaign for UN Secretary-General: 2006===
In 2010, the government of India nominated Tharoor for the post of UN Secretary General. Had he won, the 50-year-old Shashi Tharoor would have become the second-youngest Secretary-General, after the 46-year-old Dag Hammarskjöld. Although all previous Secretaries-General had come from small countries, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and National Security Advisor M. K. Narayanan felt that Tharoor&#x27;s candidacy would demonstrate India&#x27;s willingness to play a larger role at the United Nations.

Tharoor finished second, behind Ban Ki-moon of South Korea, in each of the four straw polls conducted by the UN Security Council. In the final round, Ban emerged as the only candidate not to be vetoed by one of the permanent members, while Tharoor received one veto from the United States. U.S. Ambassador John Bolton later revealed his instructions from Condoleezza Rice: &quot;We don&#x27;t want a strong Secretary-General.&quot; Tharoor was a protégé of the independently minded Kofi Annan, and a senior American official told Tharoor that the US was determined to have &quot;No more Kofis.&quot; After the vote, Tharoor withdrew his candidacy and declined Ban Ki-moon&#x27;s invitation to remain in service beyond the expiry of his term as Under-Secretary-General.

==Post-UN career==

In February 2007, amidst speculation about his post-UN future, the Indian press reported that Tharoor might be inducted into Council of Ministers of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh as Minister of State for External Affairs. In the same month, an American gossip blog reported that Tharoor was a finalist for the position of dean of the USC Annenberg School for Communication in Los Angeles, but he withdrew his name from consideration at the final stage. Instead, Tharoor became chairman of Dubai-based Afras Ventures, which established the Afras Academy for Business Communication (AABC) in Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, the city in which he would go on to win a record four parliamentary elections. He also spoke around the world about India and Kerala, where he spent increasing amounts of time before moving for good to India in October 2008.

Prior to embarking on his political career, Tharoor also served on the board of overseers of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, the board of trustees of the Aspen Institute, and the advisory boards of the Indo-American Arts Council, the American India Foundation, the World Policy Journal, the Virtue Foundation, and the human rights organisation Breakthrough. At the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy in 1976, he founded and was the first chair of the editorial board of &quot;The Fletcher Forum of World Affairs&quot;, a journal examining issues in international relations. Tharoor was an international adviser to the International Committee of the Red Cross in Geneva from 2008 to 2011. He served on the advisory council of the Hague Institute for International Justice and was elected Fellow of the New York Institute for the Humanities during 1995–96. He also supported various educational causes, including as Patron of GEMS Modern Academy in Dubai.

==Political career in India==

=== In Government ===

Tharoor once said that when he began his political career he was approached by the Congress, the Communists, and the BJP. He chose Congress because he felt ideologically comfortable with it. In March 2009, Tharoor contested the Indian General elections as a candidate for the Congress Party in Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala. His opponents included P. Ramachandran Nair of the Communist Party of India (CPI), Neelalohitadasan Nadar of the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), MP Gangadharan of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), and PK Krishna Das of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Despite criticism that he was an &quot;elite outsider&quot;,
Tharoor won the elections by a margin of 99,989. He was then selected as a Minister of State in the Council of Ministers of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. On 28 May 2009, he was sworn in as Minister of State for External Affairs, in charge of Africa, Latin America, and the Gulf, including the Haj pilgrimage, and the Consular, Passports, and Visas services of the Ministry. As Minister of State for External Affairs, he re-established long-dormant diplomatic relationships with African nations, where his fluency in French made him popular with Francophone countries and their heads of state.

Tharoor was a pioneer in using social media as an instrument of political interaction. He was India&#x27;s most-followed politician on Twitter until 2013, when he was overtaken by future Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Some of his Twitter posts have proved controversial in the past and were highlighted negatively by the opposition and press.

Tharoor was also the first Indian minister to visit Haiti after the devastating 2010 earthquake. He reformed the arrangements relating to the conduct of the Haj pilgrimage. He initiated new policy-planning activities on the Indian Ocean and represented India at various global events during his 11-month tenure as minister. In April 2010, Tharoor resigned from the position as Minister of State for External Affairs following allegations that he had misused his office to get shares in an Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket franchise. He denied the charges, and during his resignation speech in Parliament, called for a full inquiry. In a 2014 rejoinder he defended his position: &quot;I was never involved in a scam of any sort in the IPL- I was brought down because...[I had] antagonised some powerful political cricketing interests&quot; and added that he had &quot;cooperated extensively with the detailed investigation conducted by the Enforcement Directorate into the entire issue&quot;, and no wrongdoing had been found.

Between 2010 and 2012, Tharoor remained active in Parliament and was member-convenor of the Parliamentary Forum on Disaster Management, a member of the Standing Committee on External Affairs, of the Consultative Committee of Defence, the Public Accounts Committee, and the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Telecoms. He participated in several important debates of the 15th Lok Sabha, including on the Lokpal Bill, the demand for grants of the Ministry of External Affairs and of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, the black money debate, and so on. In the special debate on the 60th anniversary of the Indian Parliament, Tharoor was one of four members of the Congress Party, including party President Sonia Gandhi, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, and Leader of the House Pranab Mukherjee, to be invited to address the Lok Sabha.

In 2012, Tharoor was re-inducted into the Union Council of Ministers by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh with the portfolio of minister of state for Human Resource Development. In this role, he took special interest in the problems and challenges of adult education, distance education and enhancing high-quality research by academic institutions. He was responsible for the ministry&#x27;s written answers to Parliament&#x27;s questions and responded to oral questions on education during the Lok Sabha&#x27;s Question Hour. He addressed forums and conferences on education, explained a vision of India&#x27;s educational challenges in the context of the country&#x27;s demographic opportunities, and stressed that education was not only a socioeconomic issue, but also a national security issue.

As Member of Parliament for Thiruvananthapuram, Tharoor became the first elected representative in India to issue annual reports on his work as MP, including furnishing accounts of his MPLADS expenditure. In 2012 he published a half-term report followed in 2014 by a full-term report.

=== In Opposition ===

In May 2014, Tharoor won his re-election from Thiruvananthapuram, defeating O. Rajagopal of the Bharatiya Janata Party by a margin of around 15,700 votes, and became a member of the 16th Lok Sabha, sitting in Opposition. He was named Chairman of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on External Affairs. Shashi Tharoor was dropped from the post of Congress spokesperson on 13 October 2014 after he praised statements of his party&#x27;s opponent, Prime Minister Modi.

In regards to Tharoor&#x27;s removal from the post of congress spokesperson, Kolkata&#x27;s &quot;The Telegraph&quot; opined, &quot;For an Opposition MP to have and to exercise the freedom to appreciate a good thing done by the government and for a ruling party MP to speak and vote against the party line is not just legitimate parliamentary practice, it is the very essence of parliamentary democracy. Shashi Tharoor, from the ranks of the Congress has tried to do that; there is not one BJP MP who has matched him. Blind conformism is not loyalty, nor independent thinking, dissent.&quot;

After the BJP victory of 2014, Tharoor was asked to help the treasury benches draft a statement condemning Pakistan for freeing Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi, the Lashkar-e-Toiba commander, who masterminded the 2008 Mumbai attacks that killed 166 people. In January 2015, Tharoor asked not to debunk genuine accomplishments of Ancient Indian Science due to exaggerations of the Hindutva brigade, amid 2015 Indian Science Congress ancient aircraft controversy.

In March 2017, Tharoor called for the Victoria Memorial in Kolkata to be converted into a museum on the effects of British colonial rule in India. Tharoor wrote in an &quot;Al Jazeera&quot; article that the British &quot;conquered one of the richest countries in the world (27 per cent of global gross domestic product in 1700) and reduced it to, after over two centuries of looting and exploitation, one of the poorest, most diseased and most illiterate countries on Earth by the time they left in 1947. ...Nor is there any memorial to the massacres of the Raj, from Delhi in 1857 to Amritsar in 1919, the deaths of 35 million Indians in totally unnecessary famines caused by British [policies]&quot;.

Although there was significant support for Tharoor to contest as the Prime Minister candidate in 2019 General Elections, he has disowned, downplayed, and distanced himself from any such online campaigns run by his large number of followers.

Tharoor has also attempted to introduce a number of Private Members Bills in the Parliament. Notably, his efforts to amend Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code were voted out by the majority of parliamentarians on two occasions. The Apex court of India later ruled in favor of amending the controversial article in 2018, thereby vindicating the position advocated by Tharoor. Tharoor got elected to the AICC Working committee on 20 August 2023. In the Lok Sabha Elections of 2024, he was re-elected to Parliament defeating Rajeev Chandrashekar of the BJP by a decent margin.
While in the Opposition, he was appointed in multiple positions by the Modi-led government. In 2019, he was appointed as the Chairman of Standing Committee on Communications and Information Technology. On 26 September 2024, he was appointed as the Chairman of Committee on External Affairs.

=== Electoral performances ===
== Speeches ==

Tharoor is notable for his eloquence while speaking, as demonstrated by the popularity of his speeches on online platforms such as YouTube. For instance, Shashi Tharoor&#x27;s Oxford Union speech, delivered at the Oxford Union in 2015, supporting the motion &quot;Britain owes reparations to her former colonies&quot; has amassed over 10 million views on one site alone, while simultaneously being praised as ground-breaking in various educational institutions in India. Further speeches such as those explaining the importance of &quot;soft power&quot; and analyzing the impacts of education in India have garnered over one million and two million views respectively.

Additionally, Tharoor is known for his views on a number of topics including economics, history, governance, and geopolitics due to both his well-regarded educational attainment and his broad experience while at the United Nations. He is an outspoken supporter of the Campaign for the Establishment of a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly, an organisation which campaigns for democratic reformation of the United Nations, arguing that &quot;United Nations needs to open its doors to elected representatives&quot; Many note that it is his combination of wit, charm, wry humour, and intelligence that make him accessible and held in high esteem, both in India and abroad.

Tharoor did a one-off stand-up act as part of Amazon Prime Video series One Mic Stand.

==Literary career==
Tharoor has been a columnist in each of India&#x27;s three best-known English-language newspapers, most recently for &quot;The Hindu&quot; (2001–2008) and in a weekly column, &quot;Shashi on Sunday,&quot; in the &quot;Times of India&quot; (January 2007 – December 2008). Following his resignation as Minister of State for External Affairs, he began a fortnightly column on foreign policy issues in the &quot;Deccan Chronicle&quot;. Previously he was a columnist for the &quot;Gentleman&quot; magazine and the &quot;Indian Express&quot; newspaper, as well as a frequent contributor to &quot;Newsweek International&quot; and the &quot;International Herald Tribune&quot;. His op-eds and book reviews have appeared in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot; and the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, amongst other papers. His monthly column, &quot;India Reawakening&quot;, distributed by Project Syndicate, appears in 80 newspapers around the world. As of 2021, Tharoor has written twenty-three books in English.

Tharoor began writing at the age of 6, and his first published story appeared in the Sunday edition of &quot;The Free Press Journal&quot;, in Mumbai at age 10. His World War II adventure novel &quot;Operation Bellows&quot; about a RAF pilot Reginald Bellows, inspired by the Biggles books, was serialised in the Junior Statesman starting a week before his 11th birthday. &quot;The Great Indian Novel&quot; had had 43 reprints as of October 2014, and a Silver Jubilee special edition was issued on the book&#x27;s 25th anniversary in October 2014, by Viking Penguin India. &quot;The Elephant, the Tiger and the Cellphone&quot; has also undergone several hardback re-prints. President Bill Clinton cited Shashi Tharoor&#x27;s book &quot;India From Midnight to the Millennium&quot; in his speech to the Indian parliament in 2000.

Tharoor has lectured widely on India, and is often quoted for his observations, including, &quot;India is not, as people keep calling it, an underdeveloped country, but rather, in the context of its history and cultural heritage, a highly developed one in an advanced state of decay.&quot; He also coined a comparison of India&#x27;s &quot;thali&quot; to the American &quot;melting pot&quot;: &quot;If America is a melting pot, then to me India is a thali – a selection of sumptuous dishes in different bowls. Each tastes different, and does not necessarily mix with the next, but they belong together on the same plate, and they complement each other in making the meal a satisfying repast&quot;.

Shashi Tharoor&#x27;s non-fiction work &quot;An Era of Darkness&quot;, published later in the United Kingdom as &quot;Inglorious Empire: What the British Did to India&quot;, arose out of a speech he made at the Oxford Union, was published in 2016. It has sold over 100,000 copies in hardback reprints and continues to be a bestseller in the country. The British edition rose to Number 1 in the &quot;London Evening Standard&quot; bestseller lists. Since then, he has published two other non-fiction books: &quot;Why I Am A Hindu&quot; (2018) and &quot;The Paradoxical Prime Minister&quot; (2018), both of which have been published in the Indian subcontinent by the Aleph Book Company. The two books, both mega-bestsellers in India, raised very important questions. &quot;Why I Am a Hindu&quot; makes the point that it is precisely because Hindus form the majority that India has survived as a plural, secular democracy, a status that come under threat in the present world. &quot;The Paradoxical Prime Minister&quot; was a critical study of the present Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the effect he has had on India, along with other questions about a leader who is reviled and worshipped in equal measure.

Victor Mallet in the &quot;Financial Times&quot; said Tharoor &quot;wants us to understand the origins of the difficulties that confronted India&quot; after Indian independence. An article by the &quot;New Statesman&quot; said it was especially important for readers in Britain in the light of post-Brexit discussions. Tharoor has called for the British government to pay &quot;colonial reparations&quot; to India.

In September 2019, he published a new book, &quot;The Hindu Way: An Introduction&quot;, in line with his research into Hindu culture and ways of life of late. In 2020 he published &quot;The New World Disorder And the Indian Imperative,&quot; co-authored with Samir Saran, President of the Observer Research Foundation (ORF), one of Asia&#x27;s most influential think tanks. The book is a crucial study on the current state of chaos in international politics and identifies India&#x27;s imminent role, as a non-hegemonic global power, in scripting an equitable ethic for a new international order.

==Personal life==
Tharoor&#x27;s first wife was Tilottama Mukherji, a half-Bengali and half-Kashmiri academic, and the granddaughter of politician Kailash Nath Katju. Tharoor and Mukherji had been college sweethearts and were married in 1981. After their marriage, Tilottama took her husband&#x27;s last name and began teaching English at Ngee Ann Polytechnic and also worked as a freelance writer. Their twin sons, Kanishk and Ishaan, were born prematurely in 1984 at the KK Hospital in Singapore. Ishaan is a former senior editor at &quot;Time&quot; magazine, and now writes on foreign affairs for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. Kanishk is a former editor at Open Democracy and is the author of the highly praised short story collection &quot;Swimmer Among The Stars&quot;. Tilottama is currently a professor of humanities at New York University.

Tharoor and Tilottama were divorced at some point. In 2007, Tharoor married Christa Giles, a Canadian diplomat working at the United Nations. This marriage was short-lived and childless. Tharoor next married Dubai-based businesswoman a Kashmiri Pandit Sunanda Pushkar at his ancestral home in Elavanchery village in Kerala&#x27;s Palakkad district on 22 August 2010. He became her third husband, and step-father to her son Shiv Menon, born of a previous marriage. On 17 January 2014, Pushkar (aged 51) died at The Leela Hotel in Chanakyapuri, New Delhi, under mysterious circumstances. In May 2018, Tharoor was charged with encouraging the suicide of his wife and marital cruelty under sections 306 and 498A of the Indian Penal Code. On 18 August 2021, a court in Delhi discharged Tharoor from all the charges.

Tharoor is a vegetarian and he &quot;abhors the idea of consuming the corpses of animals,&quot; although he claimed that he does not have a problem with those who do. He has stated that he is &quot;very proud of being a Hindu&quot; and that he&#x27;s a &quot;worshipping&quot; and &quot;believing Hindu&quot;. Tharoor also claims to have read a &quot;fair amount&quot; of the Upanishads.

In April 2019, Tharoor had an accident when praying during a Thulabharam ritual at a temple in Thiruvananthapuram. After being discharged, he sought a probe by the government into the incident.

His mother-tongue is Malayalam.

=== Service and philanthropy ===
Shashi Tharoor was one of the first nine celebrities nominated in 2014 by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi to spread awareness regarding cleanliness, hygiene and good sanitation and make Swachh Bharat Mission a people&#x27;s movement. He responded by cleaning the Vizhinjam port on the outskirts of Thiruvananthapuram.

<text>The University of Hawaiʻi Maui College (UHMC) is a public college in Kahului, Hawaii on the island of Maui. It is one of ten branches of the University of Hawaiʻi system and is accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges.

In addition to its main campus in Kahului, UHMC also runs four education centers within Maui County: Lahaina Education Center in Lahaina and Hāna Education Center in Hāna; Molokai Education Center on the island of Molokai; and Lānai Education Center on the island of Lānai.

==History==
The University of Hawaiʻi, Maui College was founded in 1931 as the Maui Vocational School. In 1958 its name was changed to Maui Technical School. The college was incorporated into the University of Hawaiʻi System on July 1, 1965, after the Hawaii State Legislature enacted the Community College Act which established a statewide community college system under the UH System.

In 1966 its name was changed to Maui Community College after the UH Board of Regents authorized the college to confer degrees in Associates in Arts and Associates in Science.

In Spring of 2010, the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC) Accreditation Board approved the name change from Maui Community College to University of Hawaii Maui College. The name change was changed in order to provide a more accurate reflection of UH Maui College&#x27;s three baccalaureate degrees.

<text>:
Company quartermaster sergeant is a military rank or appointment.

==Canada==
A company quartermaster sergeant (CQMS) in the Canadian Forces is the non-commissioned officer in a company who is in charge of supplies. The CQMS also serves as the deputy to the company sergeant major and is the second most senior NCO in the company. This appointment is held by a warrant officer. Historically, before the Unification of the three services, the rank of staff sergeant was generally reserved for CQMS appointees in the former Canadian Army.

Squadron quartermaster sergeant is the equivalent in the Royal Canadian Armoured Corps, Canadian Military Engineers, and in Royal Canadian Corps of Signals. Battery quartermaster sergeant is the equivalent in the Royal Canadian Artillery.

==Ireland==

The rank of company quartermaster sergeant (CQMS) (&quot;ceathrúsháirsint complacht&quot; in Irish) is also used in the Irish Army. It is an actual rank and is subordinate to the company sergeant (equivalent to a company sergeant major). The CQMS is in charge of supplies, transport, stores, weapons, ammunition and accommodation. He or she answers to the company sergeant in matters regarding the physical welfare of the troops, including the issue of kit and the supply of food and water and other stores.

The title of company quartermaster sergeant is used in the infantry and most corps units. However, in the artillery, the rank is known as battery quartermaster sergeant (BtyQMS), not to be confused with the higher rank of battalion quartermaster sergeant (BQMS), which is equivalent to a warrant officer, and in the cavalry it is known as squadron quartermaster sergeant (SQMS). The Air Corps uses the rank of flight quartermaster sergeant.

==Myanmar==
The rank of company quartermaster sergeant (CQMS) is also used in the Myanmar Army. The CQMS is in charge of supplies, transport, stores, weapons, ammunition and accommodation. The CQMS is also the deputy to the company sergeant major and is the second most senior NCO in the company. Its equivalent rank in the Myanmar Air Force is squadron quartermaster sergeant and in the Myanmar Navy is chief petty officer.

==United Kingdom==
The company quartermaster sergeant (CQMS) in the British Army and Royal Marines is the non-commissioned officer in a company who is in charge of supplies. The CQMS also serves as the deputy to the company sergeant major and is the second most senior NCO in the company.

By 1913, there were two colour sergeants in each army infantry company. On 1 October 1913, they were replaced by the two new ranks of company sergeant major and company quartermaster sergeant, with one of each in each company. By the Second World War, CQMS had become an appointment of the rank of staff sergeant (colour sergeant in the Royal Marines and later also in army infantry regiments), and remains so today. In infantry companies, the CQMS continues to be addressed as &quot;colour sergeant&quot; (or &quot;sir&quot; by subordinates in a foot guards regiment) and not as &quot;quartermaster sergeant&quot;, &quot;CQMS&quot;, or just &quot;Q&quot;, which is common in other corps. Quartermaster sergeants are never addressed by the more junior rank of &quot;sergeant&quot;. They have always worn the rank badge of a crown over three chevrons.

Squadron quartermaster sergeant (SQMS) is the equivalent in the Royal Armoured Corps, Special Air Service, Royal Engineers, Royal Corps of Signals, Army Air Corps, Royal Army Medical Service, Royal Logistic Corps, Honourable Artillery Company, and formerly in the Royal Corps of Transport. Battery quartermaster sergeant (BQMS) is the equivalent in the Royal Artillery. Squadron quartermaster corporal (SQMC) is the equivalent in the Household Cavalry (in which it is an appointment of staff corporal).

==United States==

During the American Civil War, beginning on 4 May 1861, each company of Union cavalry was authorised a company quartermaster sergeant. The company quartermaster sergeant was responsible for the company wagon and all the property it contained, including the tents, the company mess gear, the company desk, the company library, the ordnance, the subsistence provisions, and the company tools. He was further charged with overseeing the camp set-up of the tents and picket lines. He inspected the company horses and mules, and reported any problems to the veterinary surgeon of the regiment. He was also responsible for acquiring fuel, forage for the horses, and straw for bedding for the company. These were normally drawn from the supplies of the regimental quartermaster, along with replacements for uniforms and equipment. When they were not available from stores, the company quartermaster sergeant was responsible for forage parties to acquire them. The company quartermaster sergeant was required to sign for the uniforms and equipment that were in his custody and before disbursing these items to a soldier, he required a signature of receipt, countersigned by an officer.

The rank of company quartermaster sergeant was not a command position, although he was required to know the drills, and the duties and responsibilities of the line NCOs. He was the second most senior NCO in the company after the first sergeant. During combat, his place was safeguarding the company wagon and its supplies. He was generally required to fight only in defence of the company property. In an extreme emergency, he could be used to replace a fallen line NCO, but this was extremely rare. The wagons were driven by teamsters, who were usually members of the company. Additionally, each cavalry company was authorized a wagoneer with the rank of corporal.

The company quartermaster sergeant wore three chevrons with a single straight tie in worsted. Although worn by volunteer cavalry from 1862, this rank badge was not incorporated into United States military regulations until 1866. The rank, and insignia, were also used by the Confederate Army during the Civil War.

A battery quartermaster sergeant was also authorised for every artillery battery from 4 May 1861. They began to adopt the same unofficial chevrons as the cavalry from May 1863.

The rank was last used by the U.S. Army during World War I. It was discontinued after the war.

Borg was born in Nässjö. He joined Backyard Babies, a Swedish rock band, in 1989 as lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist. The band was originally formed in 1987 under the name Tyrant with bassist Tobbe (Tobias Fischer) as lead vocals and guitarist Dregen, guitarist Johan Blomqvist, and drummer Peder Carlsson. Borg replaced Tobbe as frontman two years after the formation of the band. Blomqvist switched to bass at the same time. Over the years, they have released eight studio albums and won a Swedish Grammy.

Homeland released the EP &quot;Chapter 1&quot; in 2010, followed by their debut studio album, &quot;Chapter 2&quot;, in 2011. The band released their second studio album, &quot;Ruins of a Riot&quot;, in 2013 and their first live album, &quot;Chapter 3&quot;, in 2014.

==Melodifestivalen==
Borg participated in Melodifestivalen 2011, the competition that determines Sweden&#x27;s representative in the Eurovision Song Contest, where he placed second in the fourth heat with the song &quot;Leaving Home&quot; and qualified for the final at the Stockholm Globe Arena. The song was co-written by Borg with Jojo Borg Larsson, Fredrik Thomander and Anders &quot;Gary&quot; Wikström. In the final, he finished eight among the ten finalists.

<text>An aviator badge is an insignia used in most of the world&#x27;s militaries to designate those who have received training and qualification in military aviation. Also known as a pilot&#x27;s badge, or pilot wings, the aviator badge was first conceived to recognize the training that military aviators receive, as well as provide a means to outwardly differentiate between military pilots and the “foot soldiers” of the regular ground forces.

==Austria-Hungary==

===1913-1920===
Several badges were donated to German aircrew prior, during or after the First World War. The most notable were: 
The Military Pilot Badge was donated on January 27, 1913 by Emperor Wilhelm II. It could be awarded to officers, NCOs and crews who, after completing the two required tests for pilots and after completing their training at a military air base, acquired the certificate as a military pilot issued by the military air and land transportation inspection (Inspektion des Militär-Luft- und Kraft-Fahrtwesens). A similar badge for military pilots was donated on 4 February 1913 by Prince Ludwig from Bavaria.

The badge for navy pilots on seaplanes (Abzeichen für Marine Flugzeugführer auf Seeflugzeugen) was donated on 31 May 1913 by King and Emperor Wilhelm II, for all officers and soldiers, who successfully completed the training on a naval aircraft station and thus received a certificate of qualification as a naval pilot.

The badge for navy pilots on land planes (Abzeichen für Marine Flugzeugführer auf Landflugzeugen) was donated on 23 February 1915 by emperor Wilhelm II for pilots of the Navy, who completed their service in the war on land planes.

The badge for observation officers from airplanes (Abzeichen für Beobachtungsoffiziere aus Flugzeugen) was donated on January 27, 1914 by emperor Wilhelm II. Prerequisites for the award were: 1. a distance traveled of at least 1000 km in an aircraft, 2. a successfully completed technical assistance examination on an aircraft, 3. pass of at least one retake, 4. accomplished exploration missions, and 5. a certification as an observation officer. A similar badge was donated by King Ludwig III. on 3 March 1914 for the Bavarian army.

The airgunner badge (Abzeichen Flugzeug-Fliegerschützen) was founded on January 27, 1918 by emperor Wilhelm II. The soldiers had to demonstrate in-depth knowledge in engine construction and operation, in flight training, in map reading, in the tactics of aerial combat, in theory of bombing, and skills in the operation of machine guns on the ground and in aerial combat.

The commemorative badge for airship crews (Erinnerungsabzeichen für Besatzungen der Luftschiffe) was donated in 1920 by Reichswehr Minister Otto Gessler. There were two versions for Army and Navy airships. Upon request, it was awarded to officers, deck officers, NCOs and crews of former airship crews, who during the war had at least one year of activity on front aircraft.

===1935-1945===

The &quot;Pilotenabzeichen&quot; (Pilot&#x27;s Badge) of the former Luftwaffe had been instituted by Hermann Göring on 12 August 1935. It came in distinct types; nickel silver (changed to zinc during the war) and a variant made of gold. It depicts a silver eagle perched atop a swastika, wings open in a landing pose, and surrounded by a wreath with laurel on the right side and oak branches on the left side, respectively. It was worn in the center of the left breast pocket of the service tunic, underneath the Iron Cross 1st Class if awarded. The badge was awarded after one completed flight training and the flying licence and citation were received.

===After 1955===

In the &quot;Bundeswehr&quot; the aviation badge (&quot;Tätigkeitsabzeichen Militärluftfahrzeugführer&quot;) comes in three grades: bronze (Standard Pilot), silver (Senior Pilot) after 1200 flight hours and gold (Command Pilot) after 1800 flight hours. It depicts the &quot;Bundesadler&quot; surrounded by an oak leaf wreath between two wings. It is worn above the right breast pocket. A total of two &quot;Tätigkeitsabzeichen&quot; may be worn, one of which can be foreign in which case the foreign one would be worn below the German one.
==Hungary==

===1938-1945===
Pilots and navigators of the Royal Hungarian Air Force wore their aviator rating badge sewn on their uniforms right breast above the pocketflap. The Observers Badge was the same, except without the Holy Crown of Hungary. A smaller version of the pilot&#x27;s badge which was worn on the lower left sleeve of the overcoat - observers also worn a small insignia without the crown on their sleeve.
During World War II a gilded bronze pilot and observer badge was also introduced.

===After 1990===
After the withdrawal of Soviet forces from Hungary a new Hungarian Air Force was created. It took on the traditions of the Royal Hungarian Air Force.
There are 4 classes of pilots badges. Gold laurel 1st class aviator; 1st class aviator, 2nd class aviator, and 3rd class aviator.

==Romania==
===1912–1931===
The first military aviator badge of Romania was approved by the Ministry of War in 1912, following the establishment of the first pilot school in Cotroceni. It featured a silver miniature of a Blériot XI worn by pilots and observers on the collar of their tunics. In 1915, after the formation of the Romanian Air Corps, new pilot and observer badges were introduced. The pilot badges featured a silver plated royal eagle holding a bomb in its claws and the royal cypher of King Ferdinand I on its chest. Officers wore the metal badges on the left side of the chest while non-commissioned officers wore a silk badge sewn on the left sleeve. From 1919, NCOs were allowed to wear the same badges as the officers. After the death of King Ferdinand, the badge used the cypher of King Michael I until 1931, when King Carol II introduced new badges.

===1941–present===
At the initiative of General Iosif Iacobici and Air squadron general Gheorghe Jienescu, the military pilot badges, named &quot;war pilot badges&quot;, returned to the World War I aspect in 1941 with the difference being the replacement of the royal cypher with the coat of arms of the Kingdom of Romania. After the abdication of King Michael in 1947, the aviator badges were replaced following the Soviet model. During the communist regime, training levels achieved by the pilots were introduced. These levels, classes 1–3, were displayed on the badges in Arabic numerals. In 1977, an initiative launched by some aviators, with support received from Nicu Ceaușescu, youngest child of Nicolae Ceaușescu, brought back the old-style pilot badges. The new badges copied the model 1941 ones, with the coat of arms of the Socialist Republic of Romania shown instead. After 1989, the decision was taken to issue new badges with the center coat of arms replaced by the Romanian cockade due to the lack of a new heraldic emblem. The present Romanian Air Force pilot badges were adopted in 1996.

==South Africa==
The current aviator badge of the South African Air Force has been in use since 2002, when South Africa adopted a new coat of arms. Like the RAF, the SAAF also has a half-wing version of the badge, in this case for navigators. The aviator and navigator badges comes in three grades: bronze, silver and gold. Reserve force aviator badges have a light blue inlay around the coat of arms as appose to the dark blue of permanent air force aviators.

== Spain ==


==Turkey==
==United Kingdom==

The current aviator badge of the Royal Air Force has been in use since the Second World War. The badge consists of a winged crown and wreath, beneath which are the letters &quot;RAF&quot;. The Royal Air Force also uses a &quot;half wing&quot; version to denote Weapon System Officers (WSOs) and Weapon System Operators (WSOps) as well as various airborne roles such as Airborne Technician.
==United States==
A Military Aviator badge existed from 1912-17 before being replaced by the predecessor of the &quot;wings&quot; badge.

<text>The Grifters is a 1990 American neo-noir crime thriller film directed by Stephen Frears, produced by Martin Scorsese, and starring John Cusack, Anjelica Huston, and Annette Bening. The screenplay was written by Donald E. Westlake, based on Jim Thompson&#x27;s 1963 novel. The film won the Independent Spirit Award for Best Film and was declared one of the Top 10 films of 1990 by The National Board of Review of Motion Pictures.

==Plot==
Lilly Dillon is a veteran con artist. She works for Bobo Justus, a mob bookmaker, making large cash bets at race tracks to lower the odds of longshots. On her way to La Jolla for a race, she stops in Los Angeles to visit her son, Roy, a small-time hustler she has not seen in eight years. She finds him in pain and bleeding internally after one of his marks caught him pulling a petty scam and hit him in the stomach with a bat. When medical assistance arrives, Lilly threatens to have the doctor killed by Bobo if her son dies.

At the hospital, Lilly meets and takes an instant dislike to Roy&#x27;s girlfriend, Myra Langtry, who is slightly older than her son. Lilly urges her son to quit the grift after his con nearly got him killed. Because she leaves late for La Jolla, she misses a race where the winner pays 70 to 1. For this mistake, Bobo punches her in the stomach and insinuates he will beat her with oranges wrapped in a towel, causing permanent damage, but he burns her hand with a cigar instead.

Myra, like Roy and Lilly, is also a con artist. She uses her sex appeal on a jeweler to get what she wants for a bracelet she is trying to pawn, and when her landlord demands payment of late rent, she lures him into bed in lieu of paying him the money.

After leaving the hospital, Roy takes Myra to La Jolla for the weekend. On the train, she sees him conning a group of sailors in a rigged dice game. Myra reveals to Roy that she is also a grifter and is looking for a new partner for a long con. She describes her association with a con man and how they took advantage of wealthy marks in business cons. Roy, who insists on working only short-term cons, resists the proposition, fearing Myra may try to dupe him.

Seeing Lilly&#x27;s power over Roy, Myra accuses him of having an incestuous interest in his mother. Infuriated, Roy strikes her and breaks off their relationship. Thirsty for revenge, Myra finds out Lilly has been stealing from Bobo over the years and stashing the money in the trunk of her car. After
Myra leaks this information to Bobo, Lilly is warned by a friend and flees. Myra follows her to a remote motel, intending to kill her and steal the money for herself.

Later, Roy is called by the Phoenix police to identify his mother&#x27;s body, found in a motel room with the face disfigured by a gunshot wound. Though he tells them it is Lilly, he notices the body lacks the cigar burn that he had noticed on her earlier. He returns home to find Lilly has broken in to steal his money. Lilly reveals she shot Myra in self-defense at the motel while Myra was trying to strangle her. She arranged the scene to appear as though Myra&#x27;s body was her own and that she had committed suicide.

When Roy refuses to let Lilly take his money, she desperately pleads with him, then attempts to seduce him, even claiming that he is not really her son. Roy is disgusted and rejects her. Lilly angrily swings a briefcase at Roy just as he is taking a drink of water, shattering the glass and sending shards into his neck, which cause him to bleed to death. Sobbing over her son&#x27;s body, Lilly gathers up the money and disappears into the night.

==Production==
The project originated with Robert Harris, Jim Painten, and Bruce Kawin, who brought it to Martin Scorsese. Martin Scorsese subsequently brought in Stephen Frears to direct while he produced. Frears had just finished making &quot;Dangerous Liaisons&quot; and was looking for another project when Scorsese approached him. The British filmmaker was drawn to Thompson&#x27;s &quot;tough and very stylistic&quot; writing and described it, &quot;as if pulp fiction meets Greek tragedy&quot;. Scorsese looked for a screenwriter, and filmmaker Volker Schlöndorff recommended Donald Westlake.

Frears contacted Westlake who agreed to reread the Thompson novel but, after doing so, turned the project down, citing the story as &quot;too gloomy.&quot; Frears then phoned Westlake and convinced him that he saw the story as a positive one if considered as a story of Lilly&#x27;s drive to survive. Westlake changed his mind and agreed to write the adaptation. Frears was unsuccessful, however, at convincing Westlake to write the script under his pseudonym &quot;Richard Stark,&quot; a name he had used to write 20 noir-influenced crime novels from 1962 through 1974. Westlake said that &quot;I got out of that one by explaining Richard Stark wasn&#x27;t a member of the Writer&#x27;s Guild. I don&#x27;t think he&#x27;s a joiner, actually.&quot; (Stark&#x27;s name appears in the film, though, on a sign reading &quot;Stark, Coe and Fellows&quot;; Westlake explains in the film&#x27;s commentary track that he has written novels as Richard Stark, Tucker Coe and &quot;some other fellows.&quot;)

Meanwhile, John Cusack had read Jim Thompson&#x27;s novel in 1985 and was so impressed by it that he wanted to turn the book into a film himself. When Cusack found out that Scorsese and Frears were planning an adaptation, he actively pursued a role in the project. Cusack has said that he saw the character of Roy Dillon as &quot;a wonderfully twisted role to dive into.&quot; To research his role, he studied with real grifters and learned card and dice tricks as well as sleight-of-hand tricks like the $20 switch that his character does in the film. He even successfully pulled off this trick at a bar on a bartender he knew well.

For the role of Lilly, Frears originally considered Cher but she became too expensive after the success of &quot;Moonstruck&quot;. Sissy Spacek also read the part of Lilly Dillon.

Frears first contacted Anjelica Huston about playing Lilly in 1989 while she was filming &quot;Crimes and Misdemeanors&quot;, but after reading the script, she was unsure.
Although she was &quot;transfixed&quot; by the story and the character, a scene in the script where Lilly is beaten so violently by Bobo Justus with a sack of oranges that she defecates alarmed her with its explicitness. A few months later, Frears contacted Huston again to see if she was still interested. Still wavering, Huston&#x27;s talent agent Sue Mengers told her bluntly &quot;Anjelica, if Stephen Frears tells you he wants you to shit in the corner, then that&#x27;s what you must do.&quot; The next day Huston auditioned for the role in front of Frears at the Chateau Marmont. Frears&#x27; initial reluctance to cast Huston because she looked too much like &quot;a lady&quot;, was resolved with the decision to cheapen her look with a bleached blond wig and &quot;vulgar clothes.&quot; To research her part, she studied women dealers at card parlors in Los Angeles County, California.

The shoot was emotionally challenging for Huston. After completing the final scene between Lilly and Roy, she was so drained from the experience that she ran from the set and the studio. It took her hours to recover. After shooting the scene where Bobo Justus tortures Lilly for betraying him, Huston was so affected by the rough quality of the scene (which did not make the final cut of the film) that she spent that night throwing up.

Annette Bening explained that she accepted being full frontally nude in this film because she felt the scenes were comedic rather than dramatic. &quot;I thought I could do them because of the context it was in. It made sense to me. It was appropriate to the part, it wasn&#x27;t exploitative,&quot; she said.

==Reception==
&quot;The Grifters&quot; had its world premiere on September 14, 1990, at the Toronto Festival of Festivals at the Elgin Theater. The film had a brief Academy Award-qualifying run in New York City and Los Angeles before opening wide in January.

The film received positive reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes it holds a 92% rating based on 49 reviews. The site&#x27;s consensus reads, &quot;Coolly collected and confidently performed, &quot;The Grifters&quot; is a stylish caper that puts the artistry in con&quot;.

Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave &quot;The Grifters&quot; 4 stars out of 4, praising the lead performances and the script, which he thought more accurately captured the essence of &quot;film noir&quot; better than any in recent memory. He wrote: &quot;This is a movie of plot, not episode. It&#x27;s not just a series of things that happen to the characters, but a web, a maze of consequences.&quot;

===Box office===
The movie was successful in its limited run.

<text>This is a list of protected areas of Ontario that are administered by Government of Ontario. Ontario Parks and the Ministry of the Environment, Conservation and Parks are the provincial bodies responsible for managing these protected areas.

==Creation==

Provincial Parks are authorized under Provincial Parks Act, a Revised Statutes of Ontario created in 1913 and excluded their lands from agriculture or settlement and the park it self is created under unconsolidated Regulations.

==Types==
There are four main types of protected areas in Ontario:
* Provincial parks: Areas containing significant natural and cultural features, and provide opportunities for outdoor recreation, scientific research and environmental monitoring, and education. Provincial parks are further subdivided into six classes:
** Cultural Heritage Class Parks: Parks to protect cultural heritage elements that are distinct in Ontario for intrinsic value, interpretation, education and research purposes.
** Natural Environment Class Parks: Parks to protect provincially significant recreational landscapes and representative ecosystems, as well as to provide recreational and educational experiences.
** Nature Reserve Class Parks: Parks to protect notable and provincially significant natural habitats, landforms and ecosystems for intrinsic value, scientific research and biodiversity purposes.
** Recreation Class Parks: Parks to provide a variety of outdoor recreation opportunities in natural surroundings.
** Waterway Class Parks: Parks to protect recreational water routes and provincially significant terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems to provide recreational and educational experiences. 
** Wilderness Class Parks: Parks to protect large areas for nature, and provide low-impact recreation. Visitors must travel through these parks by foot only.
* Conservation reserves: Areas containing significant natural and cultural features, and provide opportunities compatible traditional activities such as fishing, hunting, and trapping. Scientific research and environmental monitoring also occurs.
* Wilderness areas: Areas preserved to maintain their natural state, and protect flora and fauna. Research and educational activities can occur.
* Dedicated protected areas: Areas identified by First Nations and the Government of Ontario through community-based land use planning in the Far North area of the province. These areas protect the unique ecology and boreal environment of the region, and allow development of resources.

<doc id="770201" wikidata="Q501007" url="?curid=770201" title="Dregen">
<text>Dregen (born Andreas Tyrone Svensson; 12 June 1973) is a Swedish musician best known as the guitarist of The Hellacopters, as well as Backyard Babies. As of March 2014, Dregen has also served as the newest member of Michael Monroe&#x27;s solo band, replacing Ginger as guitarist. He was formerly married to fellow Swedish singer Pernilla Andersson, who is also the mother of their first child, a son named Sixten. The couple officially announced their separation on 1 June 2015.

He is a founding member of Backyard Babies, whom he helped form in 1987. The band announced the start of an indefinite hiatus beginning in 2010. In a 2011 interview with Rocksverige.se, Dregen mentioned the band would eventually come together and be stronger than ever in response to rumours surrounding the band&#x27;s still ongoing hiatus. During this hiatus, Dregen released a personal autobiography, followed by his first solo record in September 2013. Then, after a 5-year absence, Backyard Babies returned in 2015, going on to release Four By Four later that summer. Its release marked the band&#x27;s first album in 7 years.

== Career ==
Dregen formed rock band Backyard Babies in 1987 with his childhood friends Tobias Fischer, Peder Carlsson and Johan Blomqvist in their hometown of Nässjö. The band later moved to Stockholm to pursue wider success. The group signed a record deal and released their debut album &quot;Diesel &amp; Power&quot; in 1994.

Also in 1994, Dregen met singer and guitarist Nicke Andersson who at that time played drums with Swedish death metal outfit Entombed. Together they formed another band, The Hellacopters. The band found success in 1996 with their album &quot;Supershitty to the Max!&quot;, which won a Swedish Grammis award. It was followed in 1997 by the record &quot;Payin&#x27; the Dues&quot;. The band also toured with KISS. That same year, Backyard Babies released their sophomore and Grammis-winning album &quot;Total 13&quot;.

By the end of the 1990s, Dregen decided to leave The Hellacopters and subsequently focused on recording and performing with Backyard Babies.

The album &quot;Making Enemies Is Good&quot; was released in 2001, and Backyard Babies were awarded a second Grammis award. They toured the world several times and opened for AC/DC during a European tour. Since then, the band have released a number of EPs, singles and albums such as &quot;Stockholm Syndrome&quot;, &quot;People Like People Like People Like Us&quot;, &quot;Backyard Babies&quot; and &quot;Them XX&quot;. The latter resulted in an anniversary tour in 2010, following which the band announced an indefinite hiatus.

In May 2011, Dregen joined former-Hanoi Rocks frontman Michael Monroe. Monroe, writing on his website, said

As of July 2011, Dregen was working on his first solo album. The album, titled &quot;Dregen&quot;, was released on 25 September 2013. In 2016, Dregen reunited with The Hellacopters for the 20th anniversary of their debut album. In 2022, the band released their first album in 16 years, &quot;Eyes Of Oblivion&quot;.

<text>Bulova is an American luxury timepiece manufacturing company that was founded in 1875 in New York City. Formally the Bulova Watch Company, it makes watches, clocks and accessories. 

== History ==
===Founding===
Bulova was founded and incorporated as the J. Bulova Company in 1875 by Bohemian immigrant Joseph Bulova. It was reincorporated under the name Bulova Watch Company in 1923, became part of the Loews Corporation in 1979, and was sold to Citizen at the end of 2007.

Bulova started a small jewelry shop in New York City around 1875 on Maiden Lane, which specialized in jewelry and the repair of clocks and the occasional pocket watch. Around 1911, Bulova began producing table clocks and pocket watches. In 1912, Joseph Bulova launched his first plant dedicated entirely to the production of watches in Biel, Switzerland where he began a standardized mass production. The watches were popular with the American public. In 1927, Bulova set up an observatory on the roof of a skyscraper located at 580 Fifth Avenue to determine universal time precisely.

Bulova established its operations in Woodside, New York, and Flushing, New York, where it made innovations in watchmaking, and developed a number of watchmaking tools. Its horological innovations included the Accutron watch that used a resonating tuning fork as a means of regulating the time-keeping function.

During the 1920s and &#x27;30s, Bulova was noted for its art deco watches, typically either rectangular or square. Models from this period included the Breton, the Banker, and the Commodore. All three of these models were modernized in 2020 as the Joseph Bulova Collection, utilizing swiss made Sellita mechanical movements. From 1922 through 1930, Bulova marketed 350 different ladies’ Art Deco watches, with at least an equal number of models for men.

The Westfield Watch Company, Inc. is listed as a Bulova subsidiary at least as early as 1931, but Bulova had trademarked the Westfield name in 1927. Westfields were considered the lower cost options in the Bulova line, since the movements typically had lower jewel counts than mainstream Bulovas, and cases and straps may also not have been of the same quality as other Bulova models. Like the regular Bulovas, the Westfield movements were Swiss made, but the two lines did not use the same movements. Westfield watches were produced at least through the 1950s, with the Caravelle line introduced in the early 1960s. The Bulova trademark of the Westfield name is reported as cancelled in 1989.

===Advertising milestones===
Bulova became a renowned watch company in 1922, starting with an advertising campaign in the Saturday Evening Post. Through the 1960s, Bulova led all American watchmakers in marketing expenditures, and it enhanced its distribution chains from jewelry stores and chains to general merchandising outlets, with over 20,000 U.S. distributors by 1968. 

Bulova produced the first advertisement broadcast on radio in 1926, announcing the first beep in history: ‘At the tone, it’s eight o’clock, Bulova Watch Time’, an announcement heard by millions of Americans. In 1927, Charles Lindbergh became the first solo pilot to cross the Atlantic nonstop. His crossing earned him a Bulova Watch and a check for $1000, and it became an emblem for the brand that created the model &quot;Lone Eagle&quot; in his likeness. Bulova claims to have been the first manufacturer to offer electric clocks beginning in 1931, but the Warren Telechron Company began selling electric clocks in 1912, 19 years prior to Bulova. In the 1930s and 1940s, the brand was a huge success with its rectangular plated watches whose case was strongly curved to better fit the curve of the wrist. In 1932, Bulova ran a &quot;Name the Watch&quot; contest for its new $24.75 timepiece, with a top prize of $1,000 and total prizes of $10,000. By 1940, Bulova sponsored each of the top 20 radio shows in the US.

Bulova produced the world&#x27;s first television advertisement, on July 1, 1941 (the first day that commercial advertising was permitted on television), before a baseball game between the Brooklyn Dodgers and Philadelphia Phillies over New York station WNBT (now WNBC). The announcement, for which the company paid anywhere from $4.00 () to $9.00 (), displayed a WNBT test card modified to look like a clock with the hands showing the time. The Bulova logo, with the phrase &quot;Bulova Time&quot;, was shown in the lower right-hand quadrant of the test pattern while the second hand swept around the dial for one minute.

In the 1940s, Bulova made a few examples of their complex four sided, five-dial per side &quot;sports timer&quot; analog game clock
In 1945, Arde Bulova, chairman of the board, founded the Joseph Bulova School of Watchmaking to provide training for disabled veterans after the Second World War. The school later became a full-fledged rehabilitation facility, an advocate for disabled people nationwide, and one of the founders of wheelchair sports in the United States. The school closed in 1993.

In 1949/50, Bulova entered into a contract with the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for the right to use the words &quot;Academy Award&quot; and &quot;Oscar&quot;, along with the copyrighted image commonly known as the &quot;Oscar&quot;. In 1952, Bulova and the Academy accepted a Federal Trade Commission stipulation that allowed Bulova to continue its use of the trademarked words as long as the company made it clear that such usage was based on a licensing agreement rather than “representative of meritorious award made on the basis of comparative tests with other watches.” From 1950 through 1954, Bulova issued over 25 ladies models and 14 men&#x27;s models identified with the Academy Awards, paying $154,000 in licensing fees.

In the mid-1950s, Bulova sponsored the televised &quot;Frank Sinatra Show&quot;, presenting Sinatra with numerous wristwatches which he, in turn, had engraved with personal notes and gifted to his friends. Bulova later supported the Frank Sinatra School of the Arts. The relationship continued through 2023, with Bulova&#x27;s release of the Rat Pack model, an entry-level dress watch (limited edition of 5,000 pieces), along with a series of models named after Sinatra hits (e.g. &quot;Fly Me to the Moon, My Way&quot;, and others).

The ad campaign for Bulova&#x27;s Accutron watch was profiled in the 7th season of the television series Mad Men, in which a spokesman utters the line: &quot;It&#x27;s more than a timepiece, it&#x27;s a conversation piece&quot;.

In 1967, Bulova bought the Universal Genève company of Geneva, Switzerland, and sold it in December 1977. The factory in Biel was closed in 1983.

In 1973, Gulf and Western Industries acquired a stake in the company, which it sold to Stelux Manufacturing Company, a Hong Kong-based watch components manufacturer, in 1976.

===Accutron===

Bulova&#x27;s &quot;Accutron&quot; watches, first sold in October 1960, use a 360 Hz tuning fork instead of a balance wheel as the timekeeping element. The inventor, Max Hetzel, was born in Basel, Switzerland, and joined the Bulova Watch Company in 1950. The tuning fork was powered by a one-transistor electronic oscillator circuit, so the Accutron qualifies as the second &quot;electronic watch&quot;, following the Hamilton Electric released in 1957. Instead of the ticking sound made by mechanical watches, the Accutron had a faint, high-pitched hum that came from the vibrating tuning fork. A forerunner of modern quartz watches that also keep time with a vibrating resonator, the Accutron was guaranteed to be accurate to one minute per month, or two seconds per day, considerably better than mechanical watches of the time. The Accutron was widely advertised in the print media (including magazines like &quot;Life&quot; and &quot;Ebony)&quot; with the tagline &quot;so revolutionary -- so accurate, it&#x27;s the first timepiece in history that&#x27;s guaranteed 99.9977 accurate on your wrist.&quot; An Accutron was buried in a time capsule at New York&#x27;s 1964–65 World&#x27;s Fair. By 1973, over four million Accutrons had been sold.

===The Apollo 15 watch===
In the 1960s, the company was involved in a rivalry with Omega Watches to be selected as the &#x27;first watch on the Moon&#x27;. In 1971, a Bulova chronograph was carried on board Apollo 15, the fourth mission to land men on the Moon, by mission commander David Scott. All twelve men who walked on the Moon wore standard Omega Speedmaster watches that had been officially issued by NASA. Those watches are deemed to be government property. Transcripts from the Apollo 15 Lunar Surface Journal attest to the fact that during Scott&#x27;s second excursion on the Moon&#x27;s surface, the crystal on his Omega watch had popped off. So, during his third lunar walk, he used his backup Bulova watch. The Bulova Chronograph Model #88510/01 is the only privately owned watch to have been worn on the lunar surface. There are images of Scott wearing the watch, when he saluted the American flag on the Moon, with the Hadley Delta expanse in the background. The watch shows &quot;significant wear from exposure while on the Moon, and from splashdown and recovery.&quot; In 2015, the watch sold for $1.625 million at RR Auction in Boston, which makes it one of the most expensive astronaut-owned artifacts ever sold at auction and one of the most expensive watches sold at auction. The watch is also a unique timepiece as it seems to have been a prototype, only revealed by Scott to Bulova&#x27;s fans in 2014. Therefore, the company released an homage edition of the lunar watch in early 2016, using a modern high frequency quartz movement for the watch that took more than 40 years to make its way into production line.

===Computron===
During the quartz crisis, Bulova followed the lead of other watchmakers creating electronic quartz watches by introducing the Computron watch in 1976. The Computron was Bulova&#x27;s first watch with a LED display and first digital watch. It featured a distinctive trapezoidal steel case profile, with the display located on the side of the case rather than the main face. It was marketed as a beneficial design for drivers so that they could view the watch without needing to roll their wrists or release the steering wheel, but this was mitigated by the need to press a button on the side of the case to wake the display. In later versions, repeatedly pressing the button cycled the display to the seconds, date, day, and a second timezone. The success of the Computron was a significant factor in keeping Bulova financially viable through the next several years.

===21st century===
On January 10, 2008, Citizen bought the Bulova Watch Company from Loews Corporation for $250 million.

Bulova designs, manufactures, and markets several different brands, including: the signature &quot;Bulova&quot;, the stylish &quot;Caravelle&quot; (formerly &quot;Caravelle New York&quot;), the dressy/formal Swiss-made &quot;Wittnauer Swiss&quot;, and the &quot;Marine Star&quot;. In 2014 Bulova ceased the sale of watches under the &quot;Accutron&quot; and &quot;Accutron by Bulova&quot; brand, eliminating some Accutron models and subsuming others under the &quot;Bulova&quot; brand.

In 2010, Bulova introduced the Precisionist, a new type of quartz watch with a higher frequency crystal (, eight times the industry standard ) which is claimed to be accurate to ±10 seconds per year () and has a smooth sweeping seconds hand like automatic watches rather than the typical quartz watch seconds hand that jumps each second.

From 2012 to 2015, Bulova produced a line of Swiss-Made watches known as Accu•Swiss, which took the place of the previously discontinued Accutron line. Accu•Swiss itself was discontinued in 2015 at the direction of Citizen.

In 2019, Bulova reissued the Computron brand, preserving the size and appearance of the originals, but updating the internal electronics. The new Computrons were made available in chrome, gold, and black, the first two colors being what had been used for the originals.

In 2020, the Citizen Group split Accutron off from Bulova and launched it as its own stand-alone brand, highlighting its new electrostatic movement technology and re-introducing vintage inspired &quot;Legacy&quot; models. This continued in 2023 with the re-introduction of the Accutron &quot;Astronaut T&quot;. Accutron has stated its intention to continue to develop a new version of the tuning-fork technology, even though industrial equipment used in the 1960s and 1970s to produce the technology no longer exists.

=== Use by Jewish cantors ===
The Accutron, along with other tuning fork watches, have recently become popular with Orthodox Chazzanim (Jewish cantors). Most rabbis rule against the use of a conventional tuning fork on Shabbat, due to its similarity to a musical instrument. Tuning fork watches are therefore useful as they produce a constant note (360hz being a slightly flat F#) that can be easily heard without breaking the laws of Shabbat, particularly as producing the note is not the primary function of the watch (that being telling the time).

<text>Pancake Bay Provincial Park was established in 1968 by Ontario Parks. It is a recreation-class provincial park created to help preserve the fragile beach dune ecology. There are 325 campsites, including 160 with electricity. There are three comfort stations. Yurt camping is available in the park. Group camping sites are also available.

In 2006 Pancake Bay Provincial Park received an extension as part of Ontario&#x27;s Living Legacy and now comprises .

==Facilities==
===Park office===
The park office is located on Ontario Highway 17 just past of the Agawa Crafts and Store (as coming from Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario). The park is open during the months of May to October. Senior staff, including the superintendent, can be reached at the park office between 9:00 am and 4:00 pm during summer months. The office is open from 8:00 am until 9:00 pm with overnight driving patrol.

===Main campground===
The main campground has approximately 250 sites. Two comfort stations are located in the main campground equipped with showers, laundry facilities and flush toilets. There is an amphitheater located in the campground and presentations by the park naturalists occur every weekend during the summer months. A flyer detailing the weekly events can be found in the park gatehouse. All the campsites in the main camp are within easy walking distance of the beach. The beachfront sites are subject to special premium rates. There are a large number of pull through sites for RVs and motor homes. Permits are obtained at the park gatehouse. Firewood is available for purchase at the gatehouse (seven days a week, 9:00 am to 10:00 pm) and from the park host on their site (Wednesday to Sunday, 4:00 pm to 6:00 pm).

===Hilltop campground===
Approximately 70 of the sites are located on a hill on the western end of the camping area. These are all large sites. They are close to the fen and the in-camp hiking trail but are a 5 to 8 minute walk from the beach. One of the comfort stations is located in the Hilltop campground. This comfort station does not have laundry facilities.

===Group sites===
There are five beachfront group camping sites available, accommodating between 13 and 40 campers. They are located in a separate area beyond the western end of the main campsite below the Hilltop sites.

===Yurts===
There are five yurts at the park. Two of the yurts are in the main campground, three are located on a beachfront location by the administration and day use areas. The yurts have a screened shelter tent and picnic table and a covered area beside the yurt where a propane barbecue grill is located. Each yurt sleeps six people with two bunkbeds (double bed on the bottom and a single on top). The yurt also contains a small fridge.

==Ecology==

&quot;Pancake Bay&quot; is a sheltered, south-facing bay on the eastern shore of Lake Superior, north of Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, Canada. A sand beach lines the bay of which 3.5 km are within the park boundary. The bay is sand filled and shallow, which helps to warm the lake. Ancient beach ridges are visible more inland. The ecology of the region is characteristic of the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence transition forest, but is a northern shelter for more southerly flora and fauna.

The region is home to a number of regionally rare and vulnerable species, including Braun&#x27;s holly fern, maidenhair spleenwort, sand reed and the majestic peregrine falcon. Along the Pancake Bay Nature Trail, you can find evidence of beach ridge succession over the millennia, a large conglomerate boulder believed to have been brought by glaciers, and a beautiful and ecologically sensitive fen (a type of wetland).

While at this park, one can see moose, black bears, sandhill cranes and other wildlife.

== Hiking and cycling ==

There are two marked trails, the 3.5 km Pancake Bay Nature Trail and the 14 km Lookout Trail. From the Lookout Trail one can view a panorama of the Canadian Shield, and from the Edmund Fitzgerald Lake Superior Lookout along that trail one can see to the west the area of Lake Superior where the SS &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; sank in a fierce November storm in 1975.

Biking is also allowed on the Lookout Trail.

<text>The Dal River () is a river in central Sweden that flows from the north of Dalarna and runs into the sea in northern Uppland; it is commonly considered to be the southern border of Norrland, however only the last part correlates with Limes Norrlandicus (the biological Norrland border). The northern part is split into two rivers: Österdalälven (East Dal) and Västerdalälven (West Dal). The two connect in Djurås. It is over long — the second longest river in Sweden, and has a hydropower potential of 1420 megawatts, of which 2/3 is utilized. The largest power plant is located at the Trängslet Dam. Dalälven has been significant historically as a raft transport route.
Nedre Dalälven River Landscape, Sweden, covers with a mixture of wetlands, rivers, lakes, flood plains and productive forests. It includes Lake Hovran and Färnebofjärden Bay Ramsar site.

The region boasts high biodiversity, as the river forms a clear border zone between the northern and southern flora and fauna of Northern Europe. Agriculture and forestry have evolved as a result of changes in the steel and iron industries.

More than 100 ‘Leader+ projects’ designed for sustainable development testify to the high dynamism of the region. The biosphere reserve benefits from a highly participatory governance system as well as numerous partnerships with universities and research centres for environmental monitoring.

==Description==
===Course===
====Sources====
The Dalälven is the southernmost of the big rivers of northern Sweden. It extends between the mountains of Dalarna and the Baltic Sea, which makes it the second longest river in the country after the Göta älv. However, the river changes names several times, and only becomes the &quot;Dalälven&quot; at the confluence of the Västerdalälven (&quot;West Dalälven&quot;) and the Österdalälven (&quot;East Dalälven&quot;), which happens at Djurås.

The principal of these two rivers, Österdalälven, begins where the Storån and Sörälven meet, near Idre. Both the Storån and Sörälven begin in Norway, but soon reach the northwest of Dalarna. After their confluence, the river enters into a series of narrow lakes (Idresjön, Alvrosfjorden, Kringelfjorden, Hedfjorden, Särnasjön, etc.). It then pools into the lake Trängsletsjön, in length, formed by the Trängslet Dam. The river then arrives at Mora where it receives the waters of the Oreälven, one of its major tributaries and empties itself immediately after into the Lake Siljan, the largest lake in the entire catchment area, and the seventh largest in all of Sweden, with a surface area of . This lake is formed by the largest impact crater in western Europe, of a diameter of . The river leaves the lake at Leksand and continues south to its confluence with Västerdalälven.

Västerdalälven is itself born of the confluence of two rivers, the Görälven and Fuluälven. These rivers have their sources not far from each other in Älvdalen Municipality in the Scandinavian Mountains. Fuluälven heads south along the east face of the mountain Fulufjället, while the Görälven flanks Fulufjället to the west, crossing the frontier with Norway where it takes the name &quot;Ljøra&quot;. After the confluence this river continues south, passing Sälen and then Malung and forking east to arrive in Vansbro Municipality. At Vansbro, it is met by the Vanån, its principal tributary. Its course then becomes more sinuous, tracing broad loops. It then enters Gagnef Municipality where it joins Österdalälven.

====From Djurås to the sea====
After the junction of the Österdalälven and Västerdalälven, the river heads east, passing Borlänge, Dalarna&#x27;s largest city, then receiving the waters of the Lillälven, itself fed by the Faluån, a river which goes through Falun, Dalarna&#x27;s second largest city.

The river then continues to Avesta where it strongly changes character. It leaves a deep valley and enters into a flat country, uniquely marked by some eskers. During the remaining that it travels to the sea, the river, now called the Lower Dalälven (&quot;Nedre Dalälven&quot;), alternates between large bays () and rapids. This section is also characterized by regular flooding, sometimes over vast areas. The first rapids are those at Avesta, called Storfors and Lillfors (&quot;big chute&quot; and &quot;little chute&quot;), after which the river forms the lake Bäsingen, then the rapids Näs bruk, then the lake Bysjön. It forms the frontier between Västmanland County to the south and Dalarna County to the north. It then forms the rapids at Tyttbo, and right after, one of its largest fjärds, that of Färnebofjärden National Park, forming the frontier between Uppsala County to the south and Gävleborg County to the north. More than 200 islands are strewn over this fjärd. The river continues to the rapids at Gysinge and then another great fjärd, Hedesundafjärden-Bramsöfjärden. The river passes through the rapids at Söderfors towards Untrafjärden, then by the rapids of Untra towards Marmafjärden, and then the rapids of Lanforsen. Finally, goes through its last rapids at Älvkarleby before rejoining the Baltic Sea.

== History ==

=== First humans and agriculture ===
The first settlers in the region of the Dalälven arrived after the retreat of the ice sheet, 10,000 years ago. At that time, the Lower Dalälven was below sea level and was in the zone corresponding to today&#x27;s Dalarna, which was the first area settled. The first settlers in the region settled the banks of the river and its tributaries, as well as the shore. They were hunter-gatherers. In the Lower Dalälven, which extended bit by bit, the eskers were the best sites for the first permanent settlements. It was easy to nourish oneself, thanks to the river, and these places were also the easiest to defend. Besides this, the river was easiest to cross at this point.

When agriculture developed, the lands south of the basin proved most fertile, and so the rest of the basin was used principally for pasture. There were some fields surrounding the villages, but were not very fertile. The forests were used for pasturing animals and fodder was harvested in the wetlands. Transhumance was adopted. In certain cites, the wetlands and lakes were partially drained to try to recover good-quality agricultural lands.

== Log driving ==
Log driving in River Dalälven is documented from the 1600s onward. An important factor behind it was the 1607 prohibition from Charles IX of cutting wood closer than one Swedish mile from Falun Mine. However, until the &quot;Storskiftet&quot; land amalgamation reform and England&#x27;s abolition of customs on wood products in 1849, the logging stayed small-scale.

Four major sawmill companies dominated the logging in River Dalälven: Korsnäs AB at Lake Runn (Falun), established in 1858; Kopparbergs och Hofors Sågverks Bolag at Lake Hosjön (Falun), which started in 1861 and bought its competitor &quot;Carlfors Sågverksbolag&quot; in 1874; Stora Kopparbergs Bergslags AB, which modernized its mill at the rapids of Domnarvet (Borlänge) in 1863; and the mill in Älvkarleby, which was replaced by Skutskär sawmill in 1870.

Log driving in River Dalälven reached its peak in 1952, when about 30 million logs per year were driven. It ended in most of the river in 1970. However, in the river&#x27;s lower reaches, the driving continued until 1971, with some final emptying of the stocks in 1972. In 1973 the whole river was closed for log driving, and in 1977 all logging installations along River Dalälven were decommissioned.

== In popular culture ==
In &quot;The Wonderful Adventures of Nils&quot;, Swedish author Selma Lagerlöf dedicates a chapter to the river. She describes the formation of the Dalälven as a race between the rivers Storån and Fuluälven from their sources to the sea. During the race, these rivers receive help from many tributaries, but also encounter many obstacles (lakes to fill, hills to pierce, etc.), so that halfway through, upon recognizing each other&#x27;s merits, they unite their efforts.

<text>Larry Di Ianni (born Renzo Pasquale Di Ianni, 1948) is an Italian-Canadian politician and educator who served as the 54th mayor of Hamilton from 2003 to 2006. Prior to his tenure as mayor, he served as a town councillor in Stoney Creek and a city councillor in the amalgamated City of Hamilton.

==Early life==
Di Ianni immigrated to Canada from Abruzzo, Italy in 1956 as a boy. Following his father, who had immigrated years before the family and found work at Stelco, Di Ianni and his family settled in an apartment on Cannon Street. Pressured by his mother, an assembly-line worker in a shoe factory, to receive a university education, Di Ianni graduated from McMaster University with a Bachelor&#x27;s degree in English and went on to receive his Master&#x27;s Degree in Education from the University of Toronto soon after.

After graduating, Di Ianni moved with his wife Janet (Ginetta) and three children, Robert, Paul and Stephanie, to Stoney Creek. There, Di Ianni was hired by the Hamilton-Wentworth Catholic District School Board as a high school teacher and eventually became principal of several high schools.

==Political history==
Di Ianni was first elected to Stoney Creek council in 1982, where he served for six terms until the amalgamation of the town into Hamilton. Following amalgamation, Di Ianni was elected to Hamilton City Council as councillor for Ward Ten, defeating former Stoney Creek deputy mayor Albert Marrone and town councillor Maria Pearson in a hotly contested race. Di Ianni served one term as a Hamilton councillor until November 2003.

In early March 2003, Di Ianni was approached by members of the Ontario Liberals, including then-Premier Dalton McGuinty, in an effort to convince him to run provincially against Labour Minister Brad Clark. Di Ianni ultimately declined the offer, noting that he wished to focus on municipal issues.

In the same month, sitting Hamilton mayor Bob Wade announced he would not seek re-election in the 2003 municipal election. On April 28, 2003, Di Ianni announced he would seek the office of mayor indicating that he believed Hamilton to be at a crossroads with regard to development. Di Ianni&#x27;s main opponent in the race was former provincial NDP cabinet minister David Christopherson and the race focused considerably on the construction of the Red Hill Expressway, of which Di Ianni was in favour and Christopherson was opposed. The candidates sparred frequently on the campaign trail, with Di Ianni promoting his municipal experience and support from the business community while Christopherson highlighted his time in cabinet and support from organized labour and progressive political organizations. On election night, Di Ianni defeated Christopherson by a margin of 52% to 39%. Speaking to reporters, Di Ianni noted he was immensely happy that the voters of Hamilton elected their first Italian-Canadian mayor by such a large margin.

Di Ianni&#x27;s term as mayor saw him attempt to enact his mayoral platform by addressing such issues as the completion of the Red Hill Expressway, business tax reduction, airport development, improving relations among the amalgamated municipalities, and obtaining additional social service funding from the more senior levels of government.

In the 2008 federal election, Di Ianni was the Liberal candidate in the federal riding of Hamilton East—Stoney Creek, losing the race to incumbent MP Wayne Marston of the NDP by a margin of 6,464 votes.

Di Ianni ran unsuccessfully for mayor of Hamilton in October 2010.

<doc id="770215" wikidata="Q17146140" url="?curid=770215" title="Postcards from the Edge">
<text>Postcards from the Edge is a semi-autobiographical novel by Carrie Fisher, first published in 1987. It was later adapted by Fisher herself into a motion picture of the same name, which was directed by Mike Nichols and released by Columbia Pictures in 1990.

==Plot summary==
The novel revolves around movie actress Suzanne Vale as she tries to put her life together after a drug overdose. The book is divided into five main sections:
The prologue is in epistolary form, with postcards written by Suzanne to her brother, friend, and grandmother.
The novel continues the epistolary form, consisting of first-person narrative excerpts from a journal Suzanne kept while coming to terms with her drug addiction and rehab experiences. (&quot;Maybe I shouldn&#x27;t have given the guy who pumped my stomach my phone number, but who cares? My life is over anyway.&quot;) In time Suzanne&#x27;s entries begin to alternate with the experiences of Alex, another addict in the same clinic. This section ends with Suzanne being discharged after successfully completing treatment.
The second section opens with dialogue between Suzanne and film producer Jack Burroughs on their first date. It then changes to alternating monologues from Suzanne (addressed to her therapist) and Jack (addressed to his lawyer, who serves much the same purpose as Suzanne&#x27;s therapist). Their relationship continues in this vein – all dialogue/monologue. 

The last three sections are traditional third-person narrative. 
The third section describes the initial days of the first movie Suzanne made after her treatment. For convenience, Suzanne stays with her grandparents while the movie is made. She is chided for not relaxing herself on-screen, and notes that if she could relax she wouldn&#x27;t be in therapy. This becomes a running gag among the actors and crew. The section ends with the crew mooning her on her birthday, and Suzanne asserts that &quot;there isn&#x27;t enough therapy&quot; to help her with that experience.
The fourth section shows a week of Suzanne&#x27;s &quot;normal&quot; life: working out, business meetings, an industry party, and going with a friend to a television studio for a talk show. She meets an author in the green room and gives him her phone number.
The fifth section encapsulates her relationship with the author, bringing the story to the anniversary of her overdose.
The epilogue consists of a letter from Suzanne to the doctor who pumped her stomach, who had recently contacted her. She notes that she is still off drugs and doing well. She is flattered that he inquires as to whether she is &quot;available for dating&quot;, but she is seeing someone.
The book ends on a bittersweet note: she knows she has a good life, but doesn&#x27;t trust it.

Unlike the movie, most of the conflict in the book is internal, as Suzanne is learning to handle her life without the prop of drugs. Suzanne&#x27;s mother appears in very few scenes, while Suzanne is in rehab:

My mother is probably sort of disappointed at how I turned out, but she doesn&#x27;t show it. She came by today and brought me a satin and velvet quilt. I&#x27;m surprised I was able to detox without it. I was nervous about seeing her, but it went okay. She thinks I blame her for my being here. I mainly blame my dealer, my doctor, and myself, and not necessarily in that order. [...] She washed my underwear and left. 

Later Suzanne talks with her on the phone, but it is not stressful.

==Reception==
A. O. Scott of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote in 2016 that while others before Fisher had written about their struggles with addiction, &quot;Postcards from the Edge&quot; &quot;bristles with a bravery and candor that still feels groundbreaking. She went there, long before that was a catchphrase, and before that particular &quot;there&quot; was such a crowded piece of real estate.&quot;

According to Carolyn See&#x27;s review in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;:

<text>Staff corporal (SCpl or S/Cpl) is the equivalent rank to staff sergeant in the Household Cavalry, ranking between corporal of horse and warrant officer class 2. They may hold an appointment such as squadron quartermaster corporal. A staff corporal wears four point-up rank chevrons on his cuff, surmounted by a crown. Staff corporals are in fact addressed as &quot;Corporal-Major&quot; by superiors and usually as &quot;Sir&quot; by subordinates, a holdover from the fact that the rank was originally called troop corporal-major.</text><links>

<text>Cambridge is a federal electoral district in Ontario, Canada, that has been represented in the House of Commons of Canada since 1979.

==Geography==

The district consists of most of the city of Cambridge, Ontario (the portion of it south of Highway 401), the entirety of the Township of North Dumfries, Ontario, and a portion of northern Brant County.

==History==

The federal electoral district was created in 1976 and consisted of the city of Cambridge and the Township of North Dumfries. In 1987, part of the city of Kitchener was added to the district. In 1996, the boundaries were redrawn again to include a slightly different section of Kitchener. The current boundaries, which are the same as the original definition and contain no parts of Kitchener, were defined in 2003.

This riding lost territory to Kitchener South—Hespeler and gained some territory from Brant during the 2012 electoral redistribution.

Following the 2022 electoral redistribution, Cambridge will lose all of its territory in the County of Brant to Flamborough—Glanbrook—Brant North.

<doc id="770233" wikidata="Q610586" url="?curid=770233" title="Chinookan languages">
<text>The Chinookan languages are a small family of extinct languages spoken in Oregon and Washington along the Columbia River by Chinook peoples. Although the last known native speaker of any Chinookan language died in 2012, the 2009-2013 American Community Survey found 270 self-identified speakers of Upper Chinook.

==Family division==
Chinookan consisted of three languages with multiple varieties. There is some dispute over classification, and there are two ISO 639-3 codes assigned: chh (Chinook, Lower Chinook) and wac (Wasco-Wishram, Upper Chinook). For example, Ethnologue 15e classifies Kiksht as Lower Chinook, while others consider it instead Upper Chinook (discussion), and others a separate language.
* Chinookan
** Lower Chinook (also known as Chinook-proper or Coastal Chinook) †
** Kathlamet (also known as Katlamat, Cathlamet) †
** Upper Chinook (also known as Kiksht, Columbia Chinook) †
==Phonology==
The vowels in the Chinookan languages are . Stress is marked as .

==Morphology==
As in many North American languages, verbs constitute complete clauses in themselves. Nominals may accompany the verbs, but they have adjunct status, functioning as appositives to the pronominal affixes. Word order functions purely pragmatically; constituents appear in decreasing order of newsworthiness. Clauses are combined by juxtaposition or particles, rather than subordinating inflection.

=== Verbs ===
Verbs may contain an initial tense or aspect prefix, ergative pronominal prefix, obligatory absolutive prefix, dative prefix, reflexive/reciprocal/middle prefix, adverbial prefix, directional prefix, and verb stem. The number of tense/aspect prefix distinctions varies among the languages. Kiksht shows six way tense distinctions: mythic past, remote past, recent past, immediate past, present, and future.

The pronominal prefixes are obligatory, whether free nominals occur in the clause or not. Three can be seen in the Kathlamet verb. The ergative refers to the agent of a transitive verb, the absolutive to the patient of a transitive or the single argument of an intransitive, and the dative to the indirect object. Reflexive prefixes can serve as reciprocals and as medio-passives. When the reflexive follows can ergative–absolutive pronoun sequence, it indicates that one indirectly affected is the same as the ergative. When it follows an absolutive–dative pronoun sequence, it indicates that one indirectly affected is associated with the absolutive, perhaps as the whole in a part-whole relationship, or the owner.
Aside from certain secondary irregularities in the third person dual and third person plural, the pronominal subject of the transitive verb differs from the pronominal subject of the intransitive verb only in the case of the third person singular masculine and feminine. The difference between the two sets of forms is for the most part indicated by position and, in part, by the use of a &quot;post-pronominal&quot; particle -g- which indicates that the preceding pronominal element is used as the subject of a transitive verb.

The phonetic parallelism would then be perfect among the absolutive, ergative, and possessive (see below). If we compare the theoretical forms *ag- &quot;she&quot; and *itc- &quot;he&quot; with the remaining subjective forms of the transitive verb, we obtain at once a perfectly regular and intelligible set of forms. Including the &quot;post-pronominal&quot; -g-, the system is as follows:
Verbs stems may be simplex or compound, the second member indicating direction, including motion out of, from water to shore or inland, toward water, into, down or up.

Suffixes include repetitive, causative, involuntary passive, completive, stative, purposive, future, usitative, successful completive and so on.

=== Nouns ===
Nouns contain an initial prefix, pronominal prefix, possessive prefix, inner nominalizer, root, a qualifying suffix, plural, and final suffix. Initial prefixes serve primarily as nominalizers. Masculine prefixes appear with nouns designating male persons, feminine with those denoting female persons. The neuter may indicate indefiniteness. All are used for nouns referring to objects as well. Masculine prefixes appear with the large animals; feminine for small ones. Masculine prefixes also appear with nouns expressing qualities.

The gender-number prefixes are followed by possessive pronominal prefixes. These distinguish possessors by person, clusivity, and number.

The possessive prefix for the third person singular is -ga- when the noun itself is feminine, neuter, dual, or plural. It is -tca- when the noun itself is masculine. It is preceded by the gender-number prefixes:

The possessive prefix for the first person singular (&quot;my&quot;) is –gE (Wishram -g-, -k-; -x̩- before k-stops) when the noun is feminine, neuter, dual or plural, but -tcE-, -tci- (Wishram -tc-) when the noun is masculine.

The possessive prefixes are followed by noun stem, perhaps including another nominalizer. Nominal suffixes indicate emphasis or contrast, specificity, succession in time, definiteness, plurality, and time, location, or similarity.

==Sociolinguistics==

There were Lower and Upper Chinookan groups, but only a single variety of the latter now survives: Wasco-Wishram (Wasco and Wishram were originally two separate, similar varieties). In 1990, there were 69 speakers (7 monolinguals) of Wasco-Wishram; in 2001, 5 speakers of Wasco remained; the last fully fluent speaker, Gladys Thompson, died in 2012.

Chinook-speaking groups were once powerful in trade, before and during early European contact (Lewis &amp; Clark), hence developed the Chinook Jargon – a pre-European contact language, with lexicon from at least Chinook, Chehalis, and Nootka or Nuu-chah-nulth.

Chinook people were quickly diminished by European diseases: Numbered around 800 persons in 1800; they mixed with Chehalis (in fact, the very word &quot;Chinook&quot; is a Chehalis word for those who lived on the south of the river). Most of the language family became extinct as separate groups by 1900, except a few hundreds who mixed with other groups. Around 120 people in 1945, though some 609 were reported in the 1970s, having by then mixed extensively with other groups. Language is now extinct.

Chinook Jargon also flourished from 1790s–1830s, then experienced a flood of English and French new vocabulary. It was used by up to 100,000 speakers of 100 mother tongues in the 19th century. Then declined, was recorded by linguists in the 1930s, and died out by the early 1900s. The Chinook people were finally recognized by the US Govt. in Jan. 2001, but in the 90-day grace period the Quinault Tribe filed an appeal stating that the Chinook Nation made mistakes when applying for federal recognition.

<doc id="770236" wikidata="Q2068331" url="?curid=770236" title="Biker Mice from Mars">
<text>Biker Mice from Mars is an American animated series created by Rick Ungar. The series premiered in syndication the week of September 19, 1993. It consists of three seasons of 65 episodes, with the final episode airing in syndication the week of February 24, 1996.

The show follows three anthropomorphic mice motorcyclists named Throttle, Modo, and Vinnie who escape a war on their home planet Mars before arriving to rebel on the Earth against the species that destroyed their homeland (the Plutarkians) and to one day return to Mars. The mice&#x27;s signature weapons consist of a cestus and a laser pistol (Throttle), a bionic arm with built-in laser blaster (Modo), and flares (Vinnie). Despite the frequent battles, no blood is shown, and many villains are monsters, aliens, and robots.

Ownership of the initial &quot;Biker Mice&quot; TV series passed to Disney in 2001 when Disney acquired Fox Kids Worldwide, which also includes Marvel Productions.

==Plot==
On the planet Mars, there existed a race of anthropomorphic mice who enjoyed motorsports and had a very similar culture and society to that of human beings. At some point in time they were all but wiped out by the Plutarkians, alien fish-like humanoids who plunder other planets&#x27; natural resources because they have wasted all of their own. Three survivors, Throttle, Modo and Vinnie, manage to escape on a spaceship, but are shot down by a Plutarkian warship and crash-land on Earth in the city of Chicago. There they meet a charming female mechanic named Charlene &quot;Charley&quot; Davidson and discover that the Plutarkians have come to Earth to steal its natural resources.

The Biker Mice investigate the crumbling ghetto of the windy city and soon discover that Chicago&#x27;s leading industrialist, Lawrence Limburger, is actually a Plutarkian who disguises himself as a human, plotting to ransack Earth&#x27;s resources to send to his own dying planet. Limburger enlists two henchmen, mad scientist Dr. Karbunkle and the idiotic Greasepit, to help him steal Earth&#x27;s natural resources and send them to Plutark with the help of some supervillains that they transport from another location in the galaxy. The Biker Mice become destined to stop Limburger&#x27;s schemes. The most frequent sign of victory is destroying Limburger&#x27;s tall tower, forcing him to constantly spend money and time to rebuild it by the next episode.

==Characters==
===Protagonists===

* Throttle (voiced by Rob Paulsen) – The tan-furred leader-figure of the trio with a rattail and a quiff. He is the most logical, level-headed, rational and calculating of the three. Throttle lost his sight in an incident on Mars that also caused the losses of Modo&#x27;s right arm and the right side of Vinnie&#x27;s face, and was fitted with faulty bionic eyes while in captivity: as a result, he wears green sunglasses with field spec capabilities, and on his right hand he wears a powered glove called &quot;Nuke Knucks&quot; that was made by Harley. He also carries a holstered laser pistol and sports a leather biker vest, making him the only one of the trio to carry a conventional weapon or wear clothes instead of armor. His right bicep has a tattoo which resembles his bike, a black chopper.
* Modo (voiced by Dorian Harewood) – The gray-furred gentle giant of the trio who sports an eye patch and shoulder pads. He lost his right arm and left eye in the same incident that burned off the right side of Vinnie&#x27;s face and caused Throttle to lose his sight, and Karbunkle replaced his arm with a robotic replacement that has a built-in laser cannon and great strength, as part of Stilton&#x27;s thwarted plans to create an army of bionic warriors. He is prone to fits of rage, particularly when he or his companions are referred to as &#x27;rats&#x27;: when angry, his right eye flashes red. Modo is by far the strongest of the three mice, but despite outwardly looking the most threatening and aggressive, he is the most empathetic and sensitive of the group, frequently referencing what his gray-furred mama used to say. Modo does not want any harm to befall Charley, and as such, she &#x27;mothers&#x27; him in return. His bike, a purple-blue cruiser, is the only one out of the three with a definite name (&quot;Lil&#x27; Hoss&quot;), and the one with the most demonstrated AI capability.
* Vinnie (voiced by Ian Ziering) – The white-furred thrill-seeker and self-proclaimed lady-killer among the trio, a classic example of an egomaniac (with an inferiority complex, especially during his early days as a freedom fighter). The right side of his face was burned off in the same incident where Throttle lost his sight and Modo lost his right arm, thus he wears a flexible face-plate. Vinnie rides a red sport bike in contrast to the others&#x27; choppers, and is the most active of the three, often volunteering for the most dangerous tasks, enjoying the rush and subsequent glory and bragging rights. He wears a green cross-belt on his chest and wields expandable flares that were made by Harley. His bike seems to have the greatest arsenal of weaponry between the three, and he is the best overall biker of the trio. He has a recurring catchphrase, &quot;What a rush!&quot;, and has a signature laugh of triumph. Vinnie is definitely the wildest, most fun-loving and egotistical of the group; all three are adrenaline junkies, but even Throttle and Modo cannot understand how he is still alive, considering the risks he takes. Despite his &quot;hyper-masculinity&quot;, Vinnie is actually a very loving and caring individual. He flirts endlessly with Charley, who constantly rebuffs him, but anytime she does reciprocate, Vinnie can only blush in extreme shyness. Vinnie has a near-pathological loathing for cheese, though he, like the rest of the Biker Mice, enjoys eating hot dogs.

===Supporting characters===
* Charlene &quot;Charley&quot; Davidson (voiced by Leeza Miller-McGee) – The Mice are always backed up by Charley, an auburn haired, green-eyed beautiful girl mechanic who owns the Last Chance Garage in Chicago. She is a headstrong woman and is always ready to go into battle, though the Biker Mice try to keep her out of dangerous situations, never because they think she is incapable or weak, but because they could not bear anything bad happening to her. Aside from being the target of Vinnie&#x27;s affection (which she playfully blows off) and being close with Modo, she is also responsible for repairs and upgrades to the Mice&#x27;s bikes, is a high-tech genius in her own right, and is as skilled a biker as the Mice. Her name is an obvious pun on Harley Davidson.
* Rimfire (voiced by Brian Austin Green) – Modo&#x27;s nephew who is overprotected by his peers on Mars because of his age, despite the fact that he, too, is clearly capable of what it takes to be a worthy Freedom Fighter. He first appeared in the episode &quot;Back to Mars, Part 2&quot; when the three Mice were escaping prison. He appears again in the episode &quot;Stalkers&quot;, where he also crashed into the scoreboard at Quigley Field while escaping from intergalactic rogue bounty hunters (who view the Biker Mice as the big championship stock) that eventually request Limburger&#x27;s permission, and he played a crucial role in their defeat. He also appears in the 3-part episode &quot;Once Upon a Time on Mars,&quot; where the viewers see for the first time how his age led to distrust from some of his peers.
* General Carbine (voiced by Leah Remini) – General Carbine is the de facto leader of the Freedom Fighters, a former Army officer who defected during the Plutarkian-Mars war. She and Throttle are lovers, but their relationship suffers complications owing to her position among the Freedom Fighters.
* Stoker (voiced by Peter Strauss) – The founding father of the Freedom Fighter movement on Mars, and as seen in &quot;Once Upon a Time on Mars&quot;, revealed that Mars was sold, beginning to have doubts over the fight; eventually he continues fighting as part of the rebellion. He plays a more crucial role in the 2006 revival, where he fights to protect his invention from the invading Catatonian Empire.
* Harley (voiced by Kath Soucie) – A mechanic/nurse among the Freedom Fighters. She was involved in a love triangle between Vinnie and Stoker until Vinnie&#x27;s injuries moved her enough to make him the face-plate and cross-belts he wears. Hardly had they come to an understanding, she was abducted by Mace towards the end of the Freedom Fighters&#x27; insurrection. She returns as an antagonist in the 2006 series.
* Four-By (voiced by Michael Dorn) - Another good guy on the block and a friend to the Biker Mice who drives a monster truck.
* &quot;Asphalt&quot; Jack McCyber (voiced by Jason Priestley) - A computer expert and inventor who is an old friend of Charley whose inventions are always targeted by the Plutarkians.

===Antagonists===
* Lawrence Lactavius Limburger (voiced by W. Morgan Sheppard) – The main villain of the series and archenemy of the Biker Mice. Lawrence Limburger is a bloated alien from Plutark and has an odd fascination for Earth&#x27;s criminal society of the 1930s. He is the head of Limburger Industries, the biggest industrial company in Chicago. Wearing a purple business suit and a rubber mask in order to look human at most times, he attempts to mine it and other parts of Earth of various resources including random earth, dirt, rock, snow, metal and oil, which he plans to send back to his own dying planet. He is highly resourceful and cunning, but always failing due to the Biker Mice&#x27;s interventions. His headquarters is a very tall tower called Limburger Plaza. Unfortunately for him, his plans are foiled and his tower is either destroyed, torn down, launched into space or even disappears completely by the Biker Mice or some other misfortune at the climax of almost every episode. During the War of Liberation on Mars, Limburger was a low-ranked and bullied officer, taunted by both his superior Stilton and Karbunkle. Limburger managed to attain his present rank by using Stilton&#x27;s absence during the Biker Mice&#x27;s attack on the Plutarkian base to attain his present rank. Limburger reappears in the 2006 sequel series, initially as a bootlicker for the Pit Boss but later as a co-conspirator alongside the Catatonians.
** Dr. Benjamin Boris Zachary Karbunkle (voiced by Susan Silo) – A thin, sly mad scientist of an indeterminate human-shaped species. Karbunkle used to work for Limburger&#x27;s superior Dominic T. Stilton until Limburger bribed him to cross over. Karbunkle&#x27;s main task is to think of machines and robots to either battle the Biker Mice, gather resources from Earth, or look up the villain of the week with his dimensional transporter. During the War of Liberation on Mars, he gave Modo his bionic arm and eye, Stoker his bionic tail, and Throttle his malfunctioning bionic eyes as part of his experiments to create a bionic army after they were captured by Plutarkian forces. He intended to use one of his inventions, the Mind Bender Beam, to brainwash them into being loyal to the Plutarkians; he was only able to brainwash Stoker before the Biker Mice escapes, and Stoker was later freed from Plutarkian control, while the Beam was destroyed. Karbunkle is a sycophant, often seen admiring Limburger and praising him; however, Karbunkle&#x27;s top priority is Karbunkle. He is often seen torturing Fred the Mutant, cares little about his co-worker Greasepit and has traded Plutarkian employers many times. Karbunkle is very sadistic and is known to enjoy torturing people, wears a white lab coat, high heeled boots, has a green pair of goggles which he never takes off and once in a while, his red underwear is revealed. Also reappears in the 2006 series as well and suffers the same fate as Limburger. 
** Greasepit (voiced by Brad Garrett) – A bungling sidekick usually in charge of whatever project Lawrence Limburger is running at the time. He fails in his endeavors most of the time, which Limburger soon learns to factor into his planning. Greasepit rides a motorized tricycle into battle against the Biker Mice at the head of his goons and wears a pair of gardening trousers like a mechanic&#x27;s. As his name suggests, Greasepit constantly oozes oil and he is consistently clumsy, often falling over or dropping critical pieces of Limburger&#x27;s schemes. Greasepit is the first villain Limburger ever hired though, his advert was &quot;spiced up&quot; to make him seem more capable than the bungling goof he is by his agent (who is possible also his mother). Briefly reappeared in the 2006 series where he also became a henchman for new series villain Ronaldo Rump during the end of the story arc.
** Fred the Mutant (voiced by Rob Paulsen) – A masochistic mutant working for Limburger. He thrills at the thought of receiving pain and that is his one purpose as well, being the subject of many of Karbunkle&#x27;s testings as well as physical abuse by Limburger. He was created back on Mars when Limburger bribes Karbunkle to create a supervillain for him; the procedure somehow went wrong, creating Fred instead. He is a midget with clothing similar to portrayals of Quasimodo, is bald and has three pink eyes with black irises, a bushy tail, duck-like feet, and a tentacle instead of a right arm.
* Napoleon Brie (voiced by Luke Perry) – Limburger&#x27;s unhinged chief Plutarkian rival from Detroit who is far more successful than Limburger in his efforts. He dominates Detroit. Despite this, Brie&#x27;s attempts at taking out the Biker Mice turn out just as futile as Limburger&#x27;s. Brie&#x27;s efforts are not helped by his undermining Limburger at the same time. Small of stature and the owner of a large variety of facial masks although he only ever wears the one with a crazy eye and speaks with an accent very similar to Elmer Fudd.
** Number One (voiced by Mark Hamill in the first appearance, Jeff Bennett in later appearances) - A gun for hire with a big red beard and sunglasses who works for Napoleon Brie.
* Plutarkians – The Plutarkians are a race of fish-like aliens that either plan to obtain Earth&#x27;s resources or conquer Earth. Each of them is named after a cheese. Besides Limburger and Brie, the Plutarkians consist of:
** Lord Camembert (voiced by Jeff Bennett) – The Plutarkians&#x27; supreme ruler and Limburger&#x27;s higher-up. Limburger finds disgusting especially when he makes him do the embarrassing Plutarkian greeting. In some other cases, he will appear with the entire Plutarkian council with Limburger in a panic over what task is current. He often appears on the vidcom or in person to Limburger and berates him for his failure, often at a loud yelling voice. As High Chairman of Plutark, Camembert holds highest power of the planet for four-year term at once.
** Mudfish Murdock (voiced by Jeff Bennett) – A Plutarkian trucker who was hired by Limburger to kill the Biker Mice while he attempted to drain Lake Michigan and deliver it to Plutark.
** Provolone (voiced by Jeff Bennett) – A Plutarkian lawyer.
** Dominic T. Stilton (voiced by Malcolm McDowell) - A Plutarkian who was Limburger and Karbunkle&#x27;s superior on Mars prior to the events of the series. Stilton hates Limburger for his scheming and repeated attempts to usurp him. Unlike other Plutarkians, Stilton is a neat freak who constantly carries around handkerchiefs to wipe dirt and grime off of himself and anything he touches. Stilton&#x27;s plans to destroy the Martian resistance were thwarted by the Biker Mice and Limburger took advantage of the situation to become an equally ranked Plutarkian officer, effectively not having to take orders from Stilton anymore.
** Gerald Guyere (voiced by Jim Cummings) - A Plutarkian operating in New Orleans.
** Jack Monteray (voiced by Jeff Bennett) - A Plutarkian operating in Las Vegas. He is often nicknamed &quot;One-Eyed Jack&quot;.
** Gutama Gouda (voiced by Jim Cummings) - A Plutarkian operating in Los Angeles.
** Romana Parmesana (voiced by Tori Spelling in normal form, Jennie Garth as Angel Revson) - A Plutarkian operating in Cleveland. She used her disguise of Angel Revson to manipulate Jack McCyber in her plot to usurp Lawrence Limburger and Napoleon Brie.
* Pit Boss (voiced by Stu Rosen) – The Pit Boss is the burly ruler of the Pits outside of town. The Pit Boss has an electric whip that he uses to keep his slaves in line.
** Pit Crew – The henchmen of Pit Boss who will come up and rob various places, often taken hostages as well.
* Road Ravens - A gang that was once used by Limburger to steal gasoline from different trucks.
** Jimmy Mac (voiced by Jerry Houser) - The leader of the Road Ravens.
* Stalkers (voiced by Robert Ito and Brad Garrett respectively) - A group of alien bounty hunters.
* Mace (voiced by Jeff Bennett) – Mace is a Nomad Rat who appears to be disguised as a mouse and into intervening with the mice and the Plutarkian war in secret and sometimes coming into conflict with Vinnie, but he escaped by grabbing Harley and teleporting to the Nomad Rat base.

====Supervillains====
In most episodes, Limburger orders Karbunkle to use the transporter to bring into Chicago one of the very powerful supervillains in the universe. Generally each of them have one special ability which is useful for Limburger&#x27;s plan in hand. Most of them seem to use an asteroid station called Black Rock as their main hideout when they are not summoned by those willing to pay for their services. On one notable occasion in the episode &quot;A Scent, a Memory, a Far Distant Cheese&quot;, Limburger and Karbunkle accidentally got sucked into the transporter and appear at the Black Rock where all the villains up to that episode confront him for not paying them as they asked for. The episode &quot;Diet of Worms&quot; shows that the other Plutarkians can use the same supervillains.

The following supervillains are listed in order of appearance:

* X-Terminator (voiced by Dorian Harewood impersonating Arnold Schwarzenegger as the Terminator) – A robotic bounty hunter that rides a customized combat motorcycle. He was the first supervillain that Limburger summoned to destroy the Biker Mice. In the episode &quot;Diet of Worms&quot;, X-Terminator was paired up with Jack Monteray.
* Lectromag (voiced by Mark Hamill) – An electromagnetic supervillain who the Biker Mice often have a hard time defeating.
* Tunnel Rat (voiced by Rob Paulsen) – A rat-like villain who is an expert at driving any digging vehicle.
* The Loogie Brothers (voiced by Neil Ross and Jess Harnell) – Hacka and Honka Loogie are known as the &quot;Scum of the Universe.&quot; They were summoned by Limburger to stink up Chicago, summoned to collaborate with Evil Eye Weevil in a motocross plot, and later summoned to take advantage of Chicago&#x27;s garbage crisis.
* Evil Eye Weevil (voiced by Jess Harnell impersonating Elvis Presley) – An egotistical Martian villain and former stunt performer who can induce hostility in anyone. Limburger summoned him to break the Biker Mice apart. He claims to be Elvis Presley&#x27;s alien brother and dresses like and has similar mannerisms to Presley. Evil Eye Weevil later collaborated with the Loogie Brothers in Limburger&#x27;s motocross plot.
** Pukes of Hazard (voiced by Jeff Bennett and Rob Paulsen) – The aides of Evil Eye Weevil.
* Corroder Cody (voiced by Charlie Adler) – An eyepatch-wearing villain of indeterminate human-shaped species who was hired by Limburger to purloin the oil refineries.
* Munsterella and Gorgonzola (voiced by Elinor Donahue and Eddie Barth) – A towering reptilian humanoid duo.
* Weathermeister (voiced by Russi Taylor) – A female villain of indeterminate human-shaped species and old friend of Karbunkle. She can control the weather by placing her weather stickers on a map.
* Pulverizer (voiced by Jeff Bennett) – A cyborg. He assisted Limburger into stealing a military weapon called the Annihilator.
* Stone Cutter (voiced by CCH Pounder) – A female jackhammer-wielding supervillain. Limburger enlisted her to help steal Mount Rushmore.
* Jet Blaster (voiced by Jeff Bennett) – A robotic villain with no legs who can fly unusual devices. He was hired by Limburger to cut Chicago from Earth so that he can send it to Plutark.
* Catscan (voiced by Jeff Bennett) – A cat-like villain with psychic powers that was used by Limburger in a plot to get the Last Chance garage condemned.
* Slobber the Mutt (voiced by W. Morgan Sheppard) - The leader of the hyena-like Sand Raiders on Mars.
* Billie Monnie (voiced by Susan Silo) – A bird-like bounty hunter. She was originally after Limburger for an unknown client until Limburger paid her to target the Biker Mice.
* Mechanic – A cyborg who can control any mechanical devices. Mechanic doesn&#x27;t speak, but makes different sounds. He once infected the motorcycles of the Biker Mice. In the episode &quot;Diet of Worms&quot;, Mechanic was paired up with Gerard Gruyere.
* Cycletaurs - Creatures created by Karbunkle that are the result of him combining the DNA of the Biker Mice with the molecular structure of three motorcycles. In the episode &quot;Diet of Worms&quot;, a Cycletaur was paired up with Gutama Gouda.
* Icebreaker (voiced by David Warner) – A supervillain who has powers over cold and heat. He assisted Limburger in a plot to retrieve a satellite module that ended up in the North Pole due to interference from the Biker Mice. Modo defeated Icebreaker by deflecting his ice beam back at him with his bionic arm.

The &quot;Biker Mice from Mars&quot; returned to television in 2006. The 2006 &quot;Biker Mice from Mars&quot; series is a continuation of the story, while giving more airtime to another character, General Stoker.

The new 28-episode series began airing in the United Kingdom on &quot;Toonattik&quot; on GMTV on August 26, 2006. However, due to production problems at the studio in the Philippines the series was not finalized until late 2007, resulting in the launch in the United States and many other countries being delayed until 2008 as it still needed to be dubbed.

The series was largely influenced by the major toy line that was manufactured by Italian giant Giochi Preziosi in 2005. GP retained Pangea as developers of the toy line, working in tandem with creator and executive producer, Rick Ungar. Characters, vehicles, and weapons used in the series were first developed by Pangea and turned over to G7 Animation for integration into the series. The team of Ungar, G7, and Pangea collaborated in order to maintain consistency between the intellectual property and the execution of the primary toy range, as the GP licensing monies were utilized to set in motion the series development.

==Reboot==
On July 21, 2023, Ryan Reynolds announced that he and his company Maximum Effort were co-producing a reboot of the series with The Nacelle Company and Fubo.

==Other media==

===Video games===
An LCD game of same name was released for Tiger Electronic Game on 1993.

A &quot;Biker Mice from Mars&quot; video game was released by Konami for the Super NES in 1994. The PAL version features extensive advertisements for Snickers candy bars. A &quot;Biker Mice from Mars&quot; game was also planned for Sega Mega Drive but it was never released.

In 2006, another &quot;Biker Mice from Mars&quot; video game was released based on the 2006 revival in Finland, Australia and the United Kingdom for the Nintendo DS and PlayStation 2 platforms. The game did not receive any major positive ratings although it was a major sales success throughout Scandinavia.

In 2015, a &quot;Biker Mice from Mars&quot; mobile game was released by 9thImpact for iOS and Android devices through the App Store and Google Play Store. The game is divided into episodes, each with a different storyline which unfolds as the player completes the levels. Commenting on the new game, series creator Rick Ungar said that Biker Mice fans would enjoy the snappy banter, classic catchphrases and irreverent satire that they would expect from the series, in addition to the non-stop action.

===Comic books===
Marvel Comics published a three-issue series in the early 1990s. A fourth issue was solicited on the reader&#x27;s page.
Marvel UK published its own series. The whole American series and portions of the British series were published in Germany (also by Marvel UK) in 7 magazine-sized issues from 1994 to 1995.

Oni Press has rebooted the comic series in July 2024 starting with &quot;Biker Mice From Mars #1&quot;

<doc id="770239" wikidata="Q1951409" url="?curid=770239" title="Mr. &amp; Mrs. Bridge">
<text>Mr. &amp; Mrs. Bridge is a 1990 American drama film based on the novels &quot;Mr. Bridge&quot; and &quot;Mrs. Bridge&quot; by Evan S. Connell. It is directed by James Ivory, with a screenplay by Ruth Prawer Jhabvala, and produced by Ismail Merchant.

The film stars real-life couple Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward as the title characters. The character of Mrs. Bridge is based on Connell&#x27;s mother, Ruth Connell.

==Plot==
The film tells the story of a traditionally-minded family living in the Country Club District of Kansas City, Missouri, during the 1930s and 1940s. The Bridges grapple with changing mores and expectations. Mr. Bridge is a lawyer who resists his children&#x27;s rebellion against the conservative values that he holds dear. Mrs. Bridge labors to maintain a Pollyanna view of the world, against her husband&#x27;s emotional distance and her children&#x27;s eagerness to adopt a world view more modern than her own.

==Cast==
* Paul Newman as Walter Gene Bridge

==Production==
Joanne Woodward read the first of Mr. Connell&#x27;s two novels when it was published in 1959, and for many years, she hoped to adapt it into a television production. Originally, she did not intend to play the character of Mrs. Bridge due to the difference in age, but by the late 1980s, when developing the project proved difficult, that was no longer the case.

After a dinner James Ivory first met the Newmans at, they decided to adapt the books into a feature-length film. After a script was finished, Paul Newman agreed to play Mr. Bridge, which brought in enough financing to shoot the film.

Estimated at $7.5 million, with $500,000 immediately earmarked on interest payments for loans, it was considered a very modest budget, but it also granted Merchant and Ivory the freedom to make the film as they wished. The entire crew took very low salaries, while Newman and Woodward both took much lower salaries than to which they were accustomed.

With the exception of a scene in Paris and another that took advantage of an Ottawa snowfall, the film was shot entirely in Kansas City, Missouri, on the same streets that Connell would have traveled as a child and teenager. No sound stages were used as real houses, auditoriums and office buildings were all used as sets. The residence used as the Bridges&#x27; home is just a block west of Loose Park on W. 54th St. There is also a scene set in the vault of the old First National Bank (now the Central Library); the same vault has been repurposed as the Stanley H. Durwood Film Vault.

Much of the film was shot out of sequence to save money. For example, when filming the law office of Mr. Bridge over a single morning, the furniture and Newman&#x27;s makeup and clothes were changed every hour, as the scenes jumped through spring 1932, autumn 1938, winter 1945, and summer 1938.

Budget constraints also prevented the art department from renting their set dressings, forcing them to rely on loans and donations. Brunschwig &amp; Fils donated $100,000 worth of fabrics and wallpaper, Glen Raven Mills of North Carolina donated period awning material, and Benjamin Moore donated 100 gallons of paint. A local law firm lent a dozen Tiffany lamps and paintings by Kansas City artists of the 1930s. Merchant borrowed bridge tables from a local society woman and a desk used by the founder of Hallmark from his son, who was the head of the company at the time.

According to production designer David Gropman, the Bridges&#x27; home was filled with the personal belongings of the Connell family, with Evan Connell&#x27;s sister, Barbara Zimmermann, lending all of her porcelain, her whole collection of silver, Christmas tree ornaments, and coffee urn. A lamp that Evan Connell made as a boy can be seen in Douglas Bridge&#x27;s bedroom, while marble bookends that used to belong to his father were used to dress Mr. Bridge&#x27;s law office.

Costume designer Carol Ramsey also had to borrow the production&#x27;s entire wardrobe, including $4,000 of sashes, merit badges, handcarved neckerchief slides and Boy Scout pins from 1938 for Douglas Bridge&#x27;s Eagle Scout ceremony. The London tailors Gieves &amp; Hawkes agreed to make the entire wardrobe for the film&#x27;s male characters in return for a screen credit.

A native of Klamath Falls, Oregon, Ivory would tell &quot;The New York Times&quot;: &quot;The world of Mr. and Mrs. Bridge is the world I grew up in...It&#x27;s the only film I&#x27;ve ever made that was about my own childhood and adolescence. When we talked about it, that seemed true of Paul and Joanne, too. We talked a lot about manners, about the way things used to be done.&quot;

When Ivory was honored by the Houston Cinema Arts Festival in 2014, he presented the film as a personal favorite, adding that it was the one film that he would most like to see reappraised: &quot;It had a wonderful story, great script and fabulous acting. So the fact that it was not as well received as some of the others was disappointing. Maybe there is something inherently depressing for Americans to think about, to look carefully at Mr. and Mrs. Bridge. When it was released we had focus groups after the film. And there was a gap of at least a couple of generations between the audiences and the family Connell had written about. People couldn&#x27;t understand why Mrs. Bridges was acting the way she did, because they didn&#x27;t know what American life was like in the 1930s and &#x27;40s.&quot;

==Reception==
Jonathan Rosenbaum of &quot;The Chicago Reader&quot; wrote, &quot;I&#x27;m not much of a James Ivory fan, but this 1990 adaptation of Evan S. Connell&#x27;s novels deserves to be seen and cherished for at least a couple of reasons: first for Joanne Woodward&#x27;s exquisitely multilayered and nuanced performance, and second for screenwriter Ruth Prawer Jhabvala&#x27;s retention of much of the episodic, short-chapter form of the books. It&#x27;s true that she and Ivory have toned down many of the darker aspects, but as [&quot;The Village Voice&quot;] critic Georgia Brown has suggested, Woodward&#x27;s humanization of her character actually improves on the original. Connell&#x27;s imagination and compassion regarding this character have their limits, and Woodward triumphantly exceeds them.&quot;

Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised the film, calling it &quot;a vigorous, witty, satiric attempt to give dramatic shape to two aggressively anti-dramatic prose works&quot;. He also commended Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward for &quot;the most adventurous, most stringent performances of their careers&quot;, observing that &quot;there is a reserve, humor and desperation in their characterizations that enrich the very self-conscious flatness of the narrative terrain around them&quot;.

Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a rating of 82%, based on 17 reviews.

<doc id="770242" wikidata="Q3746399" url="?curid=770242" title="Flash Gordon Conquers the Universe">
<text>Flash Gordon Conquers the Universe is a 1940 American black-and-white science-fiction 12-chapter movie serial from Universal Pictures, produced by Henry MacRae and co-directed by Ford Beebe and Ray Taylor. The serial stars Buster Crabbe, Carol Hughes, Charles B. Middleton, Frank Shannon, and Roland Drew. It was written by George H. Plympton, Basil Dickey, and Barry Shipman, and was adapted from Alex Raymond&#x27;s syndicated newspaper comic strip of the same name from King Features Syndicate. Shown theatrically in 12 separate weekly &quot;chapters&quot;, it was the last of the three Universal Flash Gordon serials made between 1936 and 1940.

During the 1950s, all three Flash Gordon serials were syndicated to television by Motion Pictures for Television, along with many of Universal&#x27;s other serial output. To avoid confusion with the imported Flash Gordon TV series airing around the same time, they were retitled &quot;Space Soldiers&quot;, &quot;Space Soldiers&#x27; Trip to Mars&quot;, and &quot;Space Soldiers Conquer the Universe&quot;.

In 1966, &quot;Flash Gordon Conquers the Universe&quot; was edited down by King Features Syndicate into two feature-length films for television syndication: &quot;Purple Death from Outer Space&quot; and &quot;Perils from the Planet Mongo&quot;. In the early 1970s, a third feature version was re-edited for the 16 mm home movie market, using story material taken from the entire serial. It bore the title &quot;Space Soldiers Conquer the Universe&quot; and later appeared on television during the 1980s. Afterward, all three edited feature-length versions became available through various grey market public-domain video labels, first on VHS videotape and later on DVD.

In the mid-1970s, all three complete Universal Flash Gordon serials were shown chapter-by-chapter by PBS stations across the U.S., bringing them to a new generation of science-fiction fans, two years before &quot;Star Wars&quot; and &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot;. From the late 1980s onward, all three serials became available on the home video market under their original theatrical release titles, chapters, and running times.

==Plot==
A deadly plague is ravaging the Earth, known as the Purple Death because of a purple spot left on victims&#x27; foreheads. Flash Gordon learns that Ming the Merciless is behind the plague when he spots one of Ming&#x27;s spaceships spreading the &quot;Death Dust&quot; in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere.

Flash Gordon, along with Dr. Alexis Zarkov and Dale Arden, return to the planet Mongo to find a possible cure, first seeking the assistance of their old friend Prince Barin. The trio continues to battle Ming and his allies, led by henchman Captain Torch, who has been charged with stopping the Earthlings by any means.

The three eventually find an antidote, called Polarite, in Mongo&#x27;s remote northern Kingdom of Frigia. They must now get the cure back to Earth in sufficient quantities to stop the ravaging plague. Ming sends in an army of robot bombs, and he succeeds in capturing Zarkov and Dale. After their capture, Flash must return to Earth to distribute the antidote by rocketship, the same way the original Death Dust was first spread.

Upon his return to Mongo, Flash is able to free Zarkov and Dale. They continue their struggles against Ming, Captain Torch, and his men through a series of close encounters, deadly escapes, and rescues, all the while continuing to thwart Ming and his allies.

Ming and his minions are eventually locked away by one of his men in the high control tower of his castle. Unknown to them, Flash is piloting a rocketship that is speeding directly toward that tower. He parachutes away just in the nick of time, and in a daring aerial maneuver, Flash is successful in boarding Barrin&#x27;s nearby rocketship, which has Dale and Zarkov aboard. Flash&#x27;s unmanned spaceship is actually a flying bomb, having been loaded with highly volatile Solarite. Its rapid forward momentum carries it directly into the castle&#x27;s control tower, where the large explosion that follows ends Ming&#x27;s tyrannical reign forever. Prince Barin soon takes his rightful place as the peaceful ruler of Mongo.

Ming&#x27;s last words to Flash were, &quot;I am the universe!&quot; Zarkov observes that with Ming&#x27;s death, &quot;Flash Gordon has conquered the universe&quot;.

==Production==
Plot points were taken from the preceding serial, &quot;Flash Gordon&#x27;s Trip to Mars&quot;.

The &quot;chamber of the death dust experiments&quot; was previously used in Universal&#x27;s &quot;Buck Rogers&quot; serial. One money-saving device also used was inserting in the serial some exciting mountain climbing search and rescue scenes from the German film &quot;White Hell of Pitz Palu&quot; (1930), as well as using its music score.

Ming is portrayed as a semi-uniformed military dictator in this serial, rather than as a Fu Manchu or Devil-like character as in the two previous Flash Gordon serials.

Co-star billing was given to Anne Gwynne, a Universal ingenue, whose role does not develop until the middle of the serial. This last-minute change in billing status resulted in the complete elimination of actor Donald Curtis, as Ronal, from both versions of the screen credits, despite the fact that he, unlike Gwynne, is in every episode playing Flash&#x27;s primary aide, a major character role.

Jean Rogers, who had played Dale Arden in the two previous Flash Gordon serials, was under contract to 20th Century Fox at that point, and neither she nor Fox wanted her to repeat the Dale Arden role; it was given instead to a recent Universal contract starlet Carol Hughes.

==Critical reception==
According to Jim Harmon and Don Glut, &quot;Flash Gordon Conquers the Universe&quot; &quot;was the most picturesque of the trilogy but surrendered much compelling charm for its cinematic sophistication&quot;.

==Soundtrack==
* &quot;Les préludes&quot; by Franz Liszt
* Excerpts from &quot;The Bride of Frankenstein&quot; soundtrack by Franz Waxman.

==Award nomination==
The entire &quot;Flash Gordon Conquers the Universe&quot; serial was nominated in 2016 for the 1940 Retro Hugo Award, in the category &quot;Best Dramatic Presentation - Long Form&quot;, sponsored by The World Science Fiction Society. The Retro Hugo Awards that year were presented at MidAmeriCon II, the 74th World Science Fiction Convention held in Kansas City, MO.

<text>The Royal Liberty School is a secondary school for boys aged 11 to 16, located in Gidea Park in the London Borough of Havering, England.

The school is situated on Upper Brentwood Road about 400 metres north of Gidea Park railway station, and approximately halfway between Gidea Park and Ardleigh Green to the north-east of Romford. It is in the parish of St. Michael &amp; All Angels, Gidea Park.

==History==

===Grammar school===
The school was founded in 1921 in the buildings at the grounds of Hare Hall and takes its name from the Royal Liberty of Havering. During this period an ornate koi pond was located within its grounds. It was once a traditional English grammar school, and also had a sixth form until 1992. In 2017 the school joined the Success for all Education trust.

The Royal Liberty was the first school in Europe to install an electronic computer (an Elliott 903, similar to the 920 military version) in 1965.

As a grammar school, it operated a squadron of the Combined Cadet Force (CCF), incorporating basic, army, navy, and air cadets (including a training glider).

===Comprehensive school===
* 1974 – In accord with government policy, and in spite of manifest opposition, the school converts from a grammar to comprehensive school.
* 1989 – J. P. Coles, retired as headmaster after 25 years of service, with L. B. Thomas subsequently promoted from deputy head to headmaster.
* 1988 – The sixth form was twinned with the nearby Frances Bardsley Academy for Girls.
* 1992 – The sixth form was abolished.
* 1996 – School was placed into Ofsted special measures. L. B. Thomas left and S. Berwitz was appointed head.
* 2000 – School removed from special measures.
* 2001 – School cited by Ofsted as &quot;one of the most improved schools in the UK&quot;.
* 2003 – Julia Deery was appointed head.
* 2004 – Bid launched for specialist school status, hoping to attract additional government funds.
* 2006 – School wins bid and becomes a Science College.
* 2014 – Julia Deery leaves, with April Saunders becoming head.
* 2017 – School coverts to academy status and joins the Success for all education trust
* 2022 - April Saunders leaves, with Lee Raftery becoming head.

==Houses==
The school&#x27;s houses were previously known as Danes, Normans, Romans and Saxons. Then there was a period when they were known as Darwin, Newton, Rutherford and Salk. They are now known as Discovery, Challenger, Endeavour, Voyager and Apollo to reflect the school&#x27;s status as a Science College. In the academic year of 2023, the names are changing to birds of prey. The plan is to change Apollo to Hawk, Challenger to Eagle, Discovery to Osprey Endeavour to Kestrel and Voyager to Falcon.

<text>Richard Carl Laymon (January 14, 1947 – February 14, 2001) was an American author of suspense and horror fiction, particularly within the splatterpunk subgenre.

==Life and career==
Laymon was born and raised outside of Chicago, Illinois, then lived in Tiburon, California, as a teen. He graduated from Redwood High School, then pursued a BA in English Literature from Willamette University in Oregon and an MA in English Literature from Loyola University in Los Angeles.

His works include more than sixty short stories and more than thirty novels, a few of which were published under the pseudonym Richard Kelly. Twenty of his stories were published as part of the Fastback Mystery series—single short stories released in book form.

Early in his career, Laymon found greater commercial success in the United Kingdom and Europe, despite praise from prominent writers from within the genre, including Stephen King and Dean Koontz. Laymon believed that this was a result of a badly-edited first release of &quot;The Woods Are Dark&quot;, which had had over fifty pages removed. The poor editing and unattractive cover art also stalled his career in America after the success of &quot;The Cellar&quot;. Starting in 1999 and an association with Leisure Books, Laymon found delayed recognition in his homeland. Laymon&#x27;s original version of &quot;The Woods Are Dark&quot; was finally published in July 2008 by Leisure Books and Cemetery Dance Publications after being reconstructed from the original manuscript by his daughter, Kelly.

His novel &quot;Flesh&quot; was named Best Horror Novel of 1988 by Science Fiction Chronicle, and both &quot;Flesh&quot; and &quot;Funland&quot; were nominated for the Bram Stoker Award, as was his non-fiction work &quot;A Writer&#x27;s Tale&quot;. He won this award posthumously in 2001 for &quot;The Traveling Vampire Show&quot;.

Richard was president of the Horror Writers Association (2000-2001).

The tribute anthology, &quot;In Laymon&#x27;s Terms&quot;, was released by Cemetery Dance Publications during the summer of 2011. It featured short stories and non-fiction tribute essays by authors such as Bentley Little, Jack Ketchum, Gary Brandner, Edward Lee, and many others.

==Death==
Laymon died in Los Angeles, California of a heart attack in 2001, aged 54.

<doc id="770260" wikidata="Q1436574" url="?curid=770260" title="For the Boys">
<text>For the Boys is a 1991 American musical comedy-drama film that traces the life of Dixie Leonard, a 1940s actress/singer who teams up with Eddie Sparks, a famous performer, to entertain American troops.

The film was adapted by Marshall Brickman, Neal Jimenez, and Lindy Laub from a story by Jimenez and Laub. It was directed by Mark Rydell and the original music score was composed by Dave Grusin. It stars Bette Midler, James Caan, George Segal, Patrick O&#x27;Neal, Arye Gross, and Norman Fell. A then-unknown Vince Vaughn made his film debut as a cheering soldier in a crowd.

As in &quot;The Rose&quot;, Midler&#x27;s first starring role and also a large budget quasi-biopic, the film is fiction. However, actress and singer Martha Raye believed that Midler&#x27;s character was based on many widely known facts about her life and career with the USO and pursued legal action based on that assumption. After a protracted legal engagement, Raye ultimately lost the case. The Caan character was generally believed to be based on Bob Hope.

For her performance, Midler won a Golden Globe Award and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress. The soundtrack features covers of many classic songs, including &quot;Come Rain or Come Shine&quot;, &quot;Baby, It&#x27;s Cold Outside&quot; by Frank Loesser, &quot;P.S. I Love You&quot;, &quot;I Remember You&quot; and the Beatles&#x27; &quot;In My Life&quot;. Five of the 13 songs have lyrics by Johnny Mercer. The soundtrack&#x27;s first single, &quot;Every Road Leads Back to You,&quot; was an original written by Diane Warren.

Despite a mixed critical reception and box office failure, the film was adapted for the musical stage in 2011 by Aaron Thielen and Terry James and debuted at the Marriott Theatre in Lincolnshire, Illinois.

==Plot==
In the early 1990s, retired entertainer Dixie Leonard has a commitment to attend a Hollywood ceremony being televised live to honor her and her longtime show-biz partner Eddie Sparks. When a young man from the TV show comes to pick her up, Dixie balks and explains what brought Eddie and her together, as well as what drove them apart. The majority of the film is an extended flashback.

Dixie&#x27;s story begins during World War II when she receives an offer to entertain the troops overseas as part of Eddie&#x27;s act. Dixie is an instant hit with the boys in uniform, but Eddie wants her gone, ostensibly because he finds her kind of humor too coarse, but in actuality because she stole the show by topping his jokes. Dixie doesn&#x27;t care for him much, either, but fellow entertainers and her joke-writer uncle Art persuade her to stay.

Eddie wins her over, particularly by reuniting Dixie with her soldier husband on stage. However, later in the war, Dixie&#x27;s husband dies in battle.

Despite her distaste for Eddie, Dixie continues working with him back in the States, mostly to support herself and her son Danny. Eddie is married with daughters, yet he becomes a proud surrogate father to Danny.

As the Korean War breaks out, Eddie announces on stage that he and Dixie will be performing for the U.S. troops there, without having told Dixie of his plans first. In revenge, Dixie announces that Eddie made a $100,000 donation ($ today) to the Red Cross. Reluctantly, she travels to Korea with him. On their way to the camp, they encounter a unit of soldiers that has been ambushed. Dixie cares for a wounded soldier but cannot save him: he is pronounced dead on arrival at the field hospital. Dixie and Eddie appear to spend the night together. At the Christmas dinner, a fight ensues after Art announces to everybody that Eddie has fired him for being a communist sympathizer.

In the meantime, Danny has grown up to be a soldier like his father and is deployed to Vietnam. At Art&#x27;s suggestion, Dixie eventually agrees to perform there for Christmas with Eddie. On their way to the camp, the performers are warned of the camp possibly being attacked, because of which they are to be flown out immediately after their performance. Before going on stage, Dixie and Eddie meet Danny, who reveals to them the barbarity that is spreading among his comrades. The show begins with the performance of a dancer, who starts getting harassed by the soldiers, and only Eddie&#x27;s intervention prevents the situation from getting out of control. Dixie comes on stage and makes some cynical remarks about the soldiers, then sings “In My Life”. While she is still on stage, the camp is attacked in a mortar barrage. Dixie and Eddie find shelter, but Danny is killed right in front of them; both mourn deeply for him.

Dixie has not forgiven Eddie for his part in all this, and they have another heated argument in the dressing room. Eddie goes out on stage alone. But, at the last minute, because he speaks of their joint loss in Vietnam, Dixie joins him on stage for one last song and dance, before appearing to accept their mutual love for one another.

==Cast==
==Reception==
The film received mixed reviews from critics, holding a 44% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 16 reviews, with an average rating of 5/10. John Simon of the &quot;National Review&quot; called &quot;For the Boys&quot; &quot;mindless&quot;.

Produced on a $40 million budget, &quot;For the Boys&quot; was a commercial disappointment upon its original release, returning just $23 million in box office receipts worldwide.

==Awards and nominations==
==Soundtrack==
The soundtrack album is composed largely of popular standards from the era, although several were written after the time period in which the film takes place.

This has become the focus of the company&#x27;s strategy leading to audio systems to support digital music playback of 24bit/192 kHz studio master quality recordings using a digital stream over a home network.

Linn Records was the first to sell DRM-free 24-bit studio master quality tracks downloaded over the internet.

This network approach was extended in 2013 with the introduction of the Linn Exakt technology to retain the 24-bit lossless signal in the digital domain to the active crossover.

In late 2014 Linn announced the integration of TIDAL&#x27;s lossless music streaming service into Linn DS digital players enabling access to over 25 million audio tracks at CD-quality over the Internet.

Originally based in the Castlemilk suburb of south Glasgow (opposite Linn Park), it is now based just outside the city, between Waterfoot and Eaglesham, East Renfrewshire.

==Company history==

===Origins===
Linn was founded by Ivor Tiefenbrun to produce the Sondek LP12 turntable. The company&#x27;s logo is the simple geometric representation of the &#x27;single point&#x27; bearing which was the unique selling point of the LP12 turntable.

Hamish Robertson designed the Ariston RD11 in 1971 with Castle Precision Engineering Ltd machining many of the parts. Robertson left Ariston, which had been taken over by Dunlop Westayr Ltd and reorganised as Ariston Audio Ltd. In February 1973 Linn Products Ltd. was formed to sell turntables made by Castle Precision Engineering. This was officially announced in an advertisement in &quot;Hi-Fi News &amp; Record Review&quot;, with the following text: &quot;The turntable previously available under the name Ariston RD11 is now available under the name Linn LP12.&quot; There were claims, and even patent litigation at the time, that the first Linn Sondek LP12 was a carbon copy of the RD11, and many parts interchangeable. Ultimately, the patent was awarded successfully to Linn.

The company&#x27;s philosophy is as controversial as its founder, who is known for his believing in only two ways of doing things – the Linn way and the wrong way. Whilst many in the industry speak of them in strictly reverential terms, notable critic Ken Kessler accuses the company (with a touch of hyperbole) of being doctrinaire, prone to &quot;propaganda, brainwashing, historical revisionism and other ways of interpreting reality&quot;. As such, and because Linn supposedly design their products within the context of an all-Linn system, they try to ensure that all the variables are covered in a &quot;proper demonstration&quot;.

===Sondek LP12===
The Sondek LP12 is a suspended sub-chassis turntable with a single-point platter bearing. From its introduction in 1973, there have not been any radical changes to the turntable design, which remains in production. However, the LP12&#x27;s sound quality has been improved through retrofittable upgrade kits. The successive upgrades consist mostly of refinements in materials used and improved manufacturing tolerances.

In 2011, some thirty years after the birth of the compact disc, sales of the LP12 and accessories still accounted for 10 percent of the company&#x27;s turnover.

Initially Linn manufactured the LP12 itself, but not any other components such as tonearms and cartridges. This gap was filled with a largely complementary range from, amongst others, Supex cartridges, Grace and Sumiko tonearms, and Naim Audio amplification.

===1975 Speaker===
In 1975, Linn patented its isobaric loading principle, and launched the &quot;Linn Isobarik&quot; loudspeaker.

===1993 Digital compact disc===
Linn&#x27;s first CD player, the Karik, was released in 1993 – 11 years after the CD format itself.

The Sondek CD12, pioneered by Alan Clark, was launched in 1997. In 2005 it was discontinued when Philips ended production of the laser around which the player was designed.

On 20 November 2009, Linn said it would stop making CD players to focus on digital streaming products instead.

===2006 crisis===
In May 2006, Linn announced that founder Ivor Tiefenbrun would relinquish the position of Linn&#x27;s managing director in favour of finance director and company secretary Peter Murphy, an 8-year veteran of the firm. As part of his succession planning, Tiefenbrun had appointed him to the Linn board in November 2004 as &quot;the obvious successor in the short term&quot;, along with his elder son Natan. Ivor&#x27;s other son, Gilad, had already joined the company in 2002 and had, perhaps contentiously, quickly risen to become head of R&amp;D. At around that time, Tiefenbrun executed a share swap with his brother Marcus in exchange for his shares in Castle Precision Engineering, consolidating his stake in Linn to 60%. Marcus was to remain a non-executive director. Ivor Tiefenbrun had given up executive duties after being diagnosed with a serious illness.

The company faced its most significant crisis since its founding when it plunged into the red in 2006, due to escalating costs and weighed down by up to £6.8 million in short term debt. The distribution deal with Loewe television and the partnership to supply Aston Martin with in car entertainment (ICE) systems were terminated. The company&#x27;s turnover declined by £15.5 million. Lloyds TSB, the company&#x27;s bank, put Linn on its &quot;special measures&quot; list, and installed a troubleshooter on the board to redress and restructure the business.

In 2007, the bank ordered asset disposals; all properties except the headquarters was earmarked for sale. Linn shed two-thirds of its staff, including then managing director Peter Murphy and some senior managers. At some point (after March 2007) Linn closed the original factory that was next door to Castle Precision Engineering (run by Ivor&#x27;s brother) on Drakemire Drive. Thus the metalworking and training facility were moved into the Eaglesham facility.

===2007 – DS (digital streaming) becomes new company strategy===

Linn was one of the first audio manufacturers to understand the likely impact of the internet and the future importance of the network, which became the focus of the company&#x27;s new strategy under its DS - Digital Streaming – product development plan. The first product to be introduced under the new strategy was the Klimax DS network music player, Linn&#x27;s first product to support the playback of 24bit/192 kHz studio master quality recordings from a digital stream over a home network. The Linn Records website – www.linnrecords.com - was the first site to sell DRM-free 24-bit Studio Master quality tracks, downloaded over the internet.
The pioneering availability of Studio Master 24bit/192 kHz and introduction of the first Linn DS network music player combined to set the company&#x27;s path for the future.

Ivor&#x27;s son Gilad was promoted from Head of Engineering to managing director in April 2008 and Ivor was brought back with executive responsibilities. In February 2009, Gilad Tiefenbrun was officially named Managing Director of the company. Ivor remains Executive Chairman.

===2010 – DS-I &amp; Label of the year===

The Majik DS-I was launched as the first Linn DS player to integrate a pre-amplifier allowing connected sources to be streamed onto a network and received by any other Linn DS player located throughout the home. As a result, Linn retired the dedicated Knekt multi-room system. In October Linn Records was awarded Label of the Year by &quot;Gramophone&quot; magazine- referencing the company&#x27;s ongoing commitment to improving the quality of the recording process and distributing music online at studio master quality.

===2012 - Kiko System===

Linn launched its first compact lifestyle system called Kiko. Available in five colours but only as a complete system comprising a DSM and dedicated active speakers. Critical reaction confirmed that the combination offered the performance of much larger systems. Kiko was awarded Best Music System £1500+ in both 2012 and 2013 by &quot;What Hi-Fi?&quot; magazine.

=== 2013 - 40th anniversary===
Linn celebrated its 40th anniversary with a limited edition Sondek LP12 launched in partnership with specialist whisky distiller Highland Park. The 40th Anniversary LP12 was produced as limited run of 40 individually numbered units featuring Linn&#x27;s highest Sondek specification and including a plinth sourced from 100-year-old Highland Park whisky barrels. The anniversary Sondeks were also supplied with a dual branded bottle of 40-year-old Highland Park single malt whisky.

=== 2013 - Exakt - the source is in the speaker===
Exakt technology has been described by the company as its most important development since the introduction of the original Sondek turntable. Exakt was designed to eliminate many of the sources of loss inherent in the traditional analogue hi-fi chain by keeping the 24-bit lossless signal in the digital domain all the way to the loudspeaker; and converting to analogue at the latest possible stage.

Exakt effectively turns the speaker into an intelligent, network connected, software upgradeable product. Inside each Exakt loudspeaker is a proprietary digital platform - called the Exakt engine by Linn - that allows the company to claim such performance-enhancing capabilities as the complete elimination of phase and magnitude distortion plus the ability to also offer room optimisation.

Exakt was initially launched as a Klimax (top) level system to the highest critical acclaim.

In 2015 the room optimisation capabilities of Exakt were released as a free software upgrade to all non-Exakt products under the name Space Optimisation.

=== 2014 Exakt range extended===
The Exakt range was extended to include two new systems: Exakt Akubarik and the first stand mount speaker version, Exakt Akudorik which also received the highest critical acclaim.

=== 2014 TIDAL Integration with Linn DS players ===

In late 2014 Linn announced the availability of lossless music streaming service (TIDAL) on Linn DS digital players to provide access to a CD-quality library of over 25 million audio tracks using the Internet.

=== 2008 - 2014 - The return to sustained profitability and growth===
In November 2014 Linn announced its sixth continuous year of profitability with revenue also continuing to grow in five of the previous six years. The company had continued to allocate a significant percentage of its turnover to R&amp;D throughout the previous eight years with the focus on the DS strategy of studio master quality audio delivered over the network, extended more latterly with the development of Exakt technology. All have combined to have a positive impact on turnover and profitability

==Partnerships==
During much of the 1970s and 1980s, Linn adopted a tight working relationship with Naim Audio. It all started in about 1974 when Linn was looking for suitable amplifiers to drive their &quot;Isobarik&quot; loudspeaker and came across Vereker&#x27;s &quot;&quot;. Their product ranges were complementary, and their names were often mentioned together. Linn focused on the electromechanical parts while Naim worked exclusively on the electronics. During this time, the Linn/Naim system was a preferred combination for many audiophiles. The two companies advocated a &#x27;source-first&#x27; philosophy based on the same principle as garbage in, garbage out – that an amplifier that correctly performed its role would only faithfully amplify a signal, but that all things being equal, a superior source component would allow the recorded music to better connect with the listener on an emotive level. It followed that a superior source signal paired with lesser amplification would sound better than an inferior source through high-quality amplification and speakers. This flew in the face of conventional wisdom that had been made prevalent by Edgar Villchur. In line with the philosophy of the comparative demonstration, the companies&#x27; dealers eschewed multi-speaker demonstrations with switched comparators to &quot;single-speaker dem rooms&quot;. The two companies had almost the same sales and marketing strategy, and shared many of the same retailers/dealers. Since many of the principles the two companies subscribed to were thought to be heretical, or flying in the face of conventional wisdom, Linn/Naim aficionados were nicknamed &quot;flat earthers&quot; sometimes affectionately, sometimes derogatorily. The two companies diverged during the 1980s, at the dawn of digital audio.

In 2002 Linn formed a brand partnership to supply audio systems to Aston Martin cars. Linn supplied amplification and loudspeaker systems for the Vanquish and DB9 models but three years later was replaced by Alpine Electronics, the previous supplier.

==Awards and recognition==
*Ivor Tiefenbrun was awarded the MBE by HM Queen Elizabeth II in for &quot;his and his company&#x27;s engineering achievements and outstanding service to the electronics industry.&quot;
*As of 1 January 2002, Linn Products Ltd has been awarded The Royal Warrant of Appointment as a Tradesman to His Royal Highness, Charles, Prince of Wales, as a provider of Entertainment Systems.
*Linn was awarded the Queen&#x27;s Award for Enterprise in Innovation in 2012.

==Products and trademarks==
Linn have a number of trademarks for their products, many of which have the characteristic &quot;k&quot; in place of a hard &quot;c&quot;. Ivor Tiefenbrun has stated that the name of the “Sondek” turntable, the company’s first product, is a contraction of &#x27;sound deck&#x27;, emphasising the (at the time) revolutionary concept that the turntable, the “deck”, was primarily responsible for sound quality, with each following component successively less important. The use of the single “k” in their product naming stuck, as it gave them a slightly mystical touch. Several of the names have Scottish origins, e.g. Kairn, Keltik, Ekos, Keilidh (cairn, Celtic, Ecosse, Ceilidh), some have relevance to the function they perform e.g. Knekt (a system to connect many rooms together) or Klout (a powerful amplifier), more recently some names are derived from descriptives of quality (Exakt, Klimax, Akurate, Dynamik, Kandid). Some products have had relatively simple names, such as the Index loudspeaker.

<text>Indochine () is a 1992 French period drama film set in colonial French Indochina during the 1930s to 1950s. It is the story of Éliane Devries, a French plantation owner, and of her adopted Vietnamese daughter, Camille, set against the backdrop of the rising Vietnamese nationalist movement. The screenplay was written by novelist Érik Orsenna, screenwriters Louis Gardel and Catherine Cohen, and director Régis Wargnier. The film stars Catherine Deneuve, Vincent Pérez, Linh Dan Pham, Jean Yanne and Dominique Blanc. The film won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film at the 65th Academy Awards, and Deneuve was nominated for Best Actress.

==Plot==
In 1930, Éliane Devries, someone born to French parents in colonial Indochina, runs her and her widowed father&#x27;s rubber plantation with indentured laborers and divides her days between her homes there and outside Saigon. She is also the adoptive mother of Camille, whose birth parents were friends of Éliane&#x27;s and members of the Nguyễn dynasty. Guy Asselin, the head of the French security services in Indochina, courts Éliane, who rejects him and raises Camille alone giving her the education of a privileged European through her teens.

Éliane meets young French Navy lieutenant Jean-Baptiste Le Guen when they bid on the same painting at an auction. He challenges her publicly and turns up at her plantation days later, searching for a boy whose sampan he set ablaze on suspicion of opium smuggling. Éliane and Jean-Baptiste begin an affair.

Camille meets Jean-Baptiste by chance one day when he rescues her from a prisoner escape attempt resulting from her being bloodied and knocked unconscious. Believing him to have saved her life, Camille falls in love with Jean-Baptiste, who has no inkling of Camille&#x27;s relation to Éliane. After learning of Camille&#x27;s love for Jean-Baptiste, Éliane uses her connections with high-ranking Navy officials to get him transferred to Haiphong. Jean-Baptiste confronts Éliane about this during a Christmas party, resulting in an argument where he slaps her in front of his fellow officers. For his transgression, Jean-Baptiste is sent to Dragon Islet (Hòn Rồng), a remote French military base in northern Indochina.

Éliane allows Camille to become engaged to Thanh, a pro-Communist Vietnamese boy expelled as a student from France because of his support for the 1930 Yên Bái mutiny. A sympathetic Thanh allows Camille to search for Jean-Baptiste up north. Traveling on foot, Camille reaches Dragon Islet and is imprisoned along with a Vietnamese family she travels with and other laborers. After seeing her traveling companions tortured and murdered by French officers, she attacks an officer and shoots him in the struggle. Jean-Baptiste defies his superiors to protect Camille in the ensuing firefight, and the two escape Dragon Islet.

After spending days adrift in the Gulf of Tonkin, Camille and Jean-Baptiste reach land and are taken in by a Communist theater troupe, who offers them refuge in a secluded valley. Months later, Camille is pregnant with Jean-Baptiste&#x27;s child, but they must vacate the valley out of safety. Thanh, now a high-ranking Communist operative, arranges for the troupe to smuggle the lovers into China.

Guy attempts to use operatives to quell the growing insurrections by laborers and to locate Camille and Jean-Baptiste, without success. Camille and Jean-Baptiste&#x27;s story becomes a legend in tuồng performances by Vietnamese actors, earning Camille the popular nickname &quot;the Red Princess&quot;. When the couple nears the Chinese border, Jean-Baptiste takes his newborn son to baptize him in a river while Camille sleeps. After christening the baby Étienne, he is ambushed and apprehended by French soldiers. Camille evades capture and escapes with the troupe, while Jean-Baptiste is remanded to a Saigon jail and Étienne is handed over to Éliane.

After some days in prison, Jean-Baptiste agrees to talk if he can first see Étienne. The Navy, which has authority over the case and refuses to subject Jean-Baptiste to interrogation by the police, plans to court-martial him in Brest, France to avoid the public outcry that would arise from a trial in Indochina. Jean-Baptiste is allowed a 24-hour visitation with Étienne before being taken to France. He goes to see Éliane, who lets him stay with Étienne at her Saigon residence for the night.

The next day, Éliane finds Jean-Baptiste dead in his bed with a gunshot to his temple, a gun in hand, and an unharmed Étienne. Outraged, Éliane suspects that the police murdered him, but Guy&#x27;s girlfriend says that the Communists may have done it to silence Jean-Baptiste. With no evidence sought for either suspicion, Jean-Baptiste&#x27;s death is ruled a suicide. Camille is captured and sent to Poulo-Condor – a high security prison where visitors are not permitted. After five years, the Popular Front comes to power and releases all political prisoners including Camille. Éliane reunites with Camille, who declines to return to her mother and son, choosing instead to join the Communists and fight for Vietnam&#x27;s independence. Camille does not wish for Étienne to know the horrors she witnessed, and tells her mother that French colonialism is drawing to an end. Taking Étienne with her, Éliane sells her plantation and leaves Indochina.

In 1954, Éliane tells her story to a grown Étienne. They have come to Switzerland, where Camille is a Vietnamese Communist Party delegate to the Geneva Conference. Étienne goes to the negotiators&#x27; hotel intending to find Camille, but it is so crowded that he is not sure how she can find or recognize him. He tells Éliane that he sees her as his mother. The next day, French Indochina becomes independent from France and Vietnam is partitioned into North and South Vietnam.

==Cast==
==Production==
The film was shot mainly in Imperial City, Hue, Ha Long (Ha Long Bay) and Ninh Binh (Phát Diệm Cathedral) in Vietnam. Butterworth in Malaysia was used as a substitute for Saigon, and Éliane Devries&#x27; &quot;Lang-Sai&quot; plantation house was actually Crag Hotel in Penang, Malaysia. Some parts were filmed in Cheong Fatt Tze Mansion, in George Town, Penang. Principal photography began on 8 April 1991 and concluded on 22 August 1991.

==Release==
===Box office===
The film received a total of 3,198,663 cinema-goers in France, making it the 6th most attended film of the year. The film also grossed $5,603,158 in North America.

===Critical reception===
On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Indochine&quot; holds an approval rating of 75%, based on 20 reviews, and an average rating of 6.4/10.

Critics&#x27; reviews praised the film&#x27;s photography and scenery, while citing issues with the plot and character development. Roger Ebert wrote the film &quot;intends to be the French &#x27;&quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;,&#x27; a story of romance and separation, told against the backdrop of a ruinous war&quot;. He continued &quot;&quot;&#x27;Indochine&quot;&#x27; is an ambitious, gorgeous missed opportunity – too slow, too long, too composed. It is not a successful film, and yet there is so much good in it that perhaps it&#x27;s worth seeing anyway…The beauty, the photography, the impact of the scenes shot on location in Vietnam, are all striking.“

Rita Kempley of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; found the transformation of Camille from a naive, pampered innocent to Communist revolutionary to be a compelling plot line, but noted, &quot;The trouble is we never see the fragile teenager undergo this surprising metamorphosis. Director Regis Wargnier seems far more interested in what the white folks are doing back on the plantation&quot;. She commented further, &quot;Wargnier, who learned his craft at the elbow of Claude Chabrol, does expose the geographic splendors of Southeast Asia as well as the common sense of its people, whose sly observations lend &quot;&#x27;Indochine&quot;&#x27; both energy and levity&quot;.

Of the film&#x27;s metaphorical mother-daughter relationship between Éliane and her adopted Vietnamese daughter Camille, Nick Davis said “&quot;Indochine&quot;&#x27;s allegorical intentions actually play much better than the specific dramas enacted among its characters&quot;, adding &quot;While Eliane-as-Establishment, Jean-Baptiste-as-Rebellious-Lower-Class-Youth, and Camille-as-Uneasy Cultural Mixture seem to follow the historical pattern of France&#x27;s relationship with Indochina, their interactions only make sense to the extent they are interpreted as solely symbolic figures&quot;.

<doc id="770279" wikidata="Q1161598" url="?curid=770279" title="The Sounds">
<text>The Sounds are a Swedish indie rock band. Formed in Helsingborg in 1998, the group&#x27;s musical style has been compared to new wave acts such as Blondie, The Cars, the Epoxies and Missing Persons.

Their debut album, &quot;Living in America&quot;, was released in 2002, with the follow-up &quot;Dying to Say This to You&quot; in 2006. Their third album, &quot;Crossing the Rubicon&quot;, was released in 2009, and their fourth, &quot;Something to Die For&quot;, was released in 2011. Their fifth album, &quot;Weekend&quot;, was released in 2013. In 2017, the band released a four-track EP, &quot;The Tales That We Tell&quot;. The Sounds released their most recent album in 2020: &quot;Things We Do for Love&quot;.

== History ==
=== Formation ===
The Sounds were formed in 1998 by classmates Félix Rodríguez, Maja Ivarsson, Johan Bengtsson and Fredrik Blond in Helsingborg, Sweden. The group met Jesper Anderberg, the youngest member, by chance at the Hultsfred Festival, and he was enlisted to play keyboards and guitar. The band&#x27;s name was decided months later during a trip to London. Before becoming the lead singer of the band, Ivarsson had previously played electric guitar in other local bands.

=== &quot;Living in America&quot; ===
Their 2002 debut album, &quot;Living in America&quot;, was recorded in Stockholm and produced by Adel Dahdal and Jimmy Monell. It earned them several &quot;Best Newcomer&quot; awards, a Grammy, a No. 4 position in the Swedish album charts and established the band not only in Sweden but also in the United States. The band has played over 500 gigs since the album&#x27;s release including participating in the 2004 Warped Tour. In 2006 they played again at Warped Tour, this time on a main stage, and have toured with bands such as Foo Fighters, The Strokes, Morningwood, Angels &amp; Airwaves, +44, Mando Diao and Panic! at the Disco.

In the United States, the band has done several TV appearances and magazine articles and has reportedly built up a celebrity fan base that includes Dave Grohl, Pharrell, Quentin Tarantino, Thomas Johnson and Robin Botten, Bam Margera and his ex-wife Missy Margera, David Desrosiers, Ben Khodadad and Britney Spears. The band has stated several times that it relies on word of mouth and concerts to promote its music.

=== &quot;Dying to Say This to You&quot; ===
The second album, &quot;Dying to Say This to You&quot;, was recorded at Studio 880 in Oakland, California, and produced by Jeff Saltzman (producer of The Killers&#x27; &quot;Hot Fuss&quot; and all but two tracks of Blondie&#x27;s &quot;Panic of Girls&quot;). They started the European leg of their tour in September and in October toured with Panic! at the Disco which included dates in London and several other major European cities. Following this tour, The Sounds made another run in the United States, starting with a MySpace secret show in Miami, Florida, on Halloween and then stopping at 10 major cities from coast to coast with supporting act Shiny Toy Guns. Altogether, The Sounds played over 200 shows in 2006, over half of which were in the United States.
In early October 2007, The Sounds wrapped up their worldwide tour in Western Europe and Australia.

One of the band&#x27;s songs, the synthpop-tinged, &quot;Hurt You&quot;, was used in a Geico television commercial that originally aired in September 2008.

Maja Ivarsson was named in &quot;Blender&quot; Magazine&#x27;s &quot;Hottest Women of ... Rock&quot; list.

The Sounds acknowledged and celebrated their tenth anniversary of their album &quot;Dying to Say This to You&quot; with a US tour (and two shows in Canada) from 15 November to 20 December 2016, performing the entire album live in its original track order; they also played their new single, &quot;Thrill&quot; (released 10 November 2016) as well as a few tracks from their earlier albums &quot;Living in America&quot; and &quot;Crossing the Rubicon&quot;.

=== &quot;Crossing the Rubicon&quot; ===
The Sounds released their third studio album &quot;Crossing the Rubicon&quot;, on 2 June 2009, via Original Signal Recordings (US and Canada) and Arnioki Records, their independent label. They collaborated with Mark Saunders as well as James Iha and Adam Schlesinger on the album. The album was mixed by Tim Palmer (Bowie, Pearl Jam, HIM, Cure) at his &#x27;62 Studios. The band performed the song &quot;No One Sleeps When I&#x27;m Awake&quot; on &quot;Last Call with Carson Daly&quot; on 12 February 2009, which was the first single from the album. The song was also included in CW&#x27;s new show &quot;The Vampire Diaries&quot; in the &quot;Haunted&quot; episode. The title of the third album was inspired by Julius Caesar&#x27;s act of defiance of January, 49 BC and refers to the band&#x27;s separation from their previous record label and resultant independence. The album&#x27;s second single, &quot;Beatbox&quot;, was featured on &quot;American Idol&quot;. &quot;Dorchester Hotel&quot; was released as a third single in Germany only.

As of February 2010, two official videos have been released off of &quot;Crossing the Rubicon&quot;. They are &quot;No One Sleeps When I&#x27;m Awake&quot; (directed by Michael Schmelling of A76 Productions) and &quot;Beatbox&quot; (directed by Manuel Concha of Concha Films).

The Sounds was the special guest on the No Doubt Summer Tour in 2009, starting in May 2009 in outdoor amphitheaters and arenas across the US and Canada. The Sounds also played a series of headline shows around the US and Canada in late April and early May prior to joining the No Doubt tour. These headlining shows featured Chicago synth-rockers Hey Champ, who created a remix of &quot;Beatbox&quot;.

On 12 September 2009, The Sounds embarked on a world tour to promote the new album. Foxy Shazam and Semi Precious Weapons joined them as support in the United States and Matt and Kim supported them in Europe.

=== &quot;Something to Die For&quot; ===
The band&#x27;s next album was titled &quot;Something to Die For&quot;, and released on 29 March 2011. Lead singer Maja Ivarsson also appeared on pop punk band All Time Low&#x27;s new album &quot;Dirty Work&quot; as a guest vocalist on the track &quot;Guts&quot;.

The first single from their new album, &quot;Better Off Dead&quot;, was released on 1 February 2011. The track was promoted on their website with a competition, in which anyone could download the sheet music for the song, and submit their own version, to be voted on by fans (the winner&#x27;s version will be included as the B-side on their upcoming 7&quot;). Everyone who downloaded the sheet music also received the track for free 5 days early. The band released their second single, &quot;Something to Die For&quot;, on February 22, 2011, and the single was featured on the &quot;Scream 4&quot; soundtrack along with &quot;Yeah Yeah Yeah&quot;. The band released the official music video for their third single, &quot;Dance With The Devil&quot;, on May 19, 2011. A music video for the fourth single, &quot;Yeah Yeah Yeah&quot;, was released on 16 February 2012.

=== &quot;Weekend&quot; ===

On his official Twitter feed, keyboard player Jesper Anderberg announced that The Sounds were in the studio working on their yet-to-be-named fifth studio album, which should be released around summer of 2013. The Sounds also posted pictures of their in-studio work on Twitter and on their official website, stating that they &quot;are locked up in a studio in Sweden putting the final touches on our 5th studio album&quot;. They also said that the album &quot;is a great reflection of our last 10 years of touring, playing live and making music together!&quot;. They will release new music in the spring, and start touring summer of 2013. On 24 April, they announced via Twitter that they have completed recording the new album.

On 16 May 2013, on their official Twitter, The Sounds posted a preview of their new single &quot;Shake Shake Shake&quot;, the first single off of their new album. &quot;Shake Shake Shake&quot; was subsequently released on 23 May 2013. In June, it was revealed that The Sounds would embark on a European headline tour in November 2013.

On 23 September 2013, title track &quot;Weekend&quot; was released as a free download on the &quot;Nylon&quot; website. On 29 September, the band debuted a new song live, titled &quot;Hurt the Ones I Love&quot;. The band released their fourth album, &quot;Weekend&quot; on 29 October 2013.

After the European headline tour, they returned to the US for a nationwide tour where they were accompanied by opening acts Ghost Beach, Blondfire, and Strange Talk.

=== &quot;Things We Do for Love&quot; ===

On 28 February 2020, The Sounds announced their new studio album &quot;Things We Do for Love&quot;. The band unveiled the title track and US tour that same day. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the band pushed back the album&#x27;s release date, originally 1 May 2020, to 12 June 2020.

<text>Lucius &quot;Tawl&quot; Ross (October 5, 1948 – January 3, 2024) was an American musician. He was the rhythm guitarist for Funkadelic from 1968 to 1971, and played on their first three albums. He left the band in 1971 soon after a debilitating experience with LSD, which is reported to have resulted in brain damage. He moved back home to North Carolina and dropped out of the music scene, but resurfaced in 1995 after a nearly 25-year absence to release a solo album, &quot;a.k.a. Detrimental Vasoline - Giant Shirley&quot;, issued by Coconut Grove Records under the name Tal Ross.

Ross died on January 3, 2024, at the age of 75. His death was reported on the official Facebook page of George Clinton and Parliament Funkadelic.

<text>Amtgard is a battle gaming and live-action fantasy roleplaying and boffer combat game with chapters primarily based in the United States and Canada as well as Germany, Croatia, and South Korea.

== History ==
Amtgard was created by Jim Haren Jr, also known as Peter LaGrue, in El Paso, Texas in 1983. Taking pieces from the rulebooks of both Emarthnguarth and Dagorhir (both of which he had played previously), he advertised in the newspaper for an event known as &quot;Attila the Hun&#x27;s Birthday Brawl.&quot; Though only a few people showed that first day, it was a hit, and soon the game spread throughout the state and then the country. The largest concentrations of Amtgard chapters are in Texas and the Central United States, but groups are found throughout the United States as well as in Canada, Croatia, Japan, Finland, Germany, Korea, and Russia.

Amtgard has given birth to a few splinter groups, notably the High Fantasy Society.

== Ruleset ==
Current version of the rulebook can be found at http://amtgard.com/documents/.

===Classes===
Character creation in Amtgard is class-based; that is, players choose an archetype with pre-established abilities, similar to systems used by &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; and other tabletop roleplaying games. For instance, one player might play an Assassin, and another, a Warrior. Players can increase the abilities of their characters by going up in level; a player&#x27;s level is determined by the length of game time they have played that particular class. Advancement in a class is not tied to a specific character. Players may play different classes at different times, and levels have no relation to in-character deaths.

===Combat===
The primary focus of the rules of the game is combat. The abilities of the classes are generally related to combat. Non-combat oriented talents and attributes are often left up to the imagination and actual capabilities of the players or rules specified in a scenario.

Amtgard combat is resolved with actual physical fighting, though there are some rules in place to enhance safety. The weapons are boffer weapons (with less emphasis on realism and more emphasis on safety) but a player&#x27;s physical ability, rather than game-based attributes as with other LARPs, determines the outcome allowing for a more realistic experience. Injuries are quite rare due to the stringent attention paid to safety. Contact is limited between fighters and non-weapon tactics like grappling or shield bashing are strictly prohibited. The basic combat rules are nearly identical to Dagorhir with a &quot;limb loss&quot; system based on hit location, in contrast to games such as NERO that are hit-point based. A hit from a weapon does not decrease a &quot;hit point&quot; total, but instead disables the location struck. A blow to the arm or leg disables the limb and a blow to the torso kills the player&#x27;s character. Any combination of 2 limb shots also kills the player&#x27;s character. Two limb shots to the same arm is also considered a death, while multiple shots to the same leg have no effect after the first shot. An exception to this rule occurs when a player chooses to &quot;post&quot; instead of kneeling, which is the normal requirement upon being struck in the leg. A player who chooses to post may remain standing, but is not allowed to move the wounded leg, save to pivot. Players may choose to post due to bad knees, rocky or wet terrain, or simply because they do not wish to kneel. Upon the &quot;wounded&quot; player declaring &quot;posting&quot; the leg is once again a valid target. If a player struck in the leg is kneeling and then raises the wounded knee off the ground, it is a valid target. Amtgard fighting tends to be fast and precise, focusing more on accuracy than on power.

===Magic===
Like many boffer LARPs, and unlike Dagorhir, Amtgard uses magic spells. Magic, another important aspect of Amtgard, is handled primarily either by audible incantations or by thrown &quot;spell balls&quot;, small, safely-padded, brightly colored projectiles. Of the 12 Amtgard classes, 4 are considered to be &quot;Magic Casters&quot;. In contrast to the 8 &quot;Melee&quot; classes, Magic Casters receive spell points at each level. Spell points are used to purchase various &quot;Magics&quot; which vary from a healing spell to the ability to turn an ally into an Undead Minion.
If a Magic Caster wishes to use weapons (save daggers or magic staves) or armor, they must purchase them using spell points.

===Armor===
Amtgard also utilizes armor for a number of classes. Armor grants anywhere from 1 to 6 points to a covered hit location. Armor receives a rating based on the type of armor and materials and techniques used to construct it. Each class is able to wear armor ranging from 0 to 6 points. A player may wear armor that is rated higher than the maximum allowed by their class, but it only grants armor up to the class maximum. Regular weapon hits to covered locations remove a single point of armor, however, several classes, spells and creatures are able to remove additional points per blow. Combat involving armor is simple in Amtgard. There are essentially three kinds of damage armor may be subject to. Normal melee attacks remove a single point. Armor breaking attacks will remove one point of armor from a location with more than three points, and all remaining points from a location with 3 or less points. An armor destroying attack will remove all armor from a location struck. Other class abilities enhance all armor worn to &quot;Ancestral Armor&quot;, which is removed one point at a time, regardless of the type of damage it is being struck with. As armor in Amtgard is not physically functional, realism and aesthetics are encouraged with armor in Amtgard, in order to enhance atmosphere and balance the substantial benefits offered by armor. Non-period, modern-looking materials and shoddy construction can reduce the protection granted by the armor.

===Battle games===
Battle games range from one-on-one tournaments to team battles of forty or fifty people to mass warfare with hundreds of players. The largest &quot;grand melees&quot; are held at the major annual events and can incorporate hundreds of members from chapters all over the world. Conversely, scripted &quot;quests&quot; can involve just a dozen or two participants, and may involve puzzles as well as combat. The ditch battle, or trench battle, is a simple form battle that involves weapon use only, not full class play.

== Setting ==
Unlike many other fantasy roleplaying games, Amtgard has no established &quot;backstory&quot; to its world. The setting encourages and incorporates elements of historical Europe and Asia as well as the high and low fantasy genres. Elements from steampunk and post apocalyptic fiction are not unheard of, and the only real rule governing a characters back story is that they be compatible with a swords and sorcery setting.

== Society ==
Amtgard has a cultural side as well, emphasizing various cultural fairs and competitions as well as various forms of creative expression. Amtgarders often create their own garb and equipment.

Two important structures in Amtgard culture are the Fighting Company and the Household, both voluntary memberships. A Fighting Company is essentially a military structure, much like a &quot;clan&quot; in any multi-player video game, whereas a Household is devoted to some cultural or personal goals, such as the arts, benevolence, common interests, etc. Both generally place a high value on contributing to the club as a whole, and often have a specific mission statement.

A number of slang terms have evolved within the Amtgard community, a few of the most common are as follows:
*Battlegame – Any type of game involving more than two players.
*Full Class Battle A game where all players are playing a class, all magic and class abilities may be used. These game generally involve at least 2 teams, and sometimes involve monsters.
*Ditch Battle / Ditch – A melee only form of in-game combat where players line up in opposing sides and engage one another. No classes, no class abilities, no projectile weapons, no armor, and shields are indestructible. Only melee weapons and shields are permitted. When all players on one side are eliminated, the first player to be killed on the winning team switches teams and the next round may begin.
*Trench Battle / Trench – See Ditch Battle.
*Stick Jock – A player whose focus is almost entirely on the combat aspect of the game, many Stick Jocks prefer ditching to battlegames. The term is borrowed from the Society for Creative Anachronism and though originally pejorative, it has been &quot;taken back&quot; in recent years.
*Ditch Monkey (Trench Monkey) – A player that primarily &quot;ditches&quot; (see Ditch Battle and Stick Jock).
*Sluffer (Slougher) – A player who fails to accept a valid hit, intentionally or otherwise. As in to &quot;slough&quot; a hit, as a reptile would slough (shed) its skin. In short – a cheater.
*Ironhide / Rhinohide – A person who ignores hits in combat, cheating (wittingly or not) to avoid taking damage. Also used as a verb as in ironhiding or to rhinohide. A subset of sluffer.
*Flurb – A person who focuses more on the roleplay and fantasy aspect of Amtgard. Players described as Flurbs generally prefer full class battles and are believed to be poor fighters. Originally pejorative.
*Hate Stick – A weapon constructed to pass a cursory weapons inspection, possibly even &quot;legal&quot; by the rules, but utilizing various methods of inflicting more pain than a normal, safe, weapon. These weapons are used to increase the probability of a sluffer accepting hits. The legality of these weapons varies on a case-by-case basis. The use of these weapons as a tool of compliance is generally frowned upon, and instead players are encouraged to communicate with opponents to minimize confusion.

== Awards and honors ==
Amtgard has a system of awards and honors based on past contributions and accomplishments. There are incremental awards for all sorts of arts and crafts, ranging from sewing to singing to armor smithing. By achieving 10 ranks of most awards one might also attain the Masterhood for that award. As an example, someone who is very generous and works hard to benefit the province of Amtgard as a whole may gain Orders of the Rose. After attaining 10 Orders of the Rose, one is eligible to be given the title Master of the Rose. The ruling body of each sub-chapter can also create awards for specific actions or talents that aren&#x27;t included in the standard selection. The inclusion of a standardized awards system that has encouraged and advanced the Arts and Sciences in Amtgard.

Amtgard&#x27;s honor system includes not only awards but titles and ranks as well. Titles such as Lord/Lady, Duke/Duchess, Marquis/Marquise, and Viscount/Viscountess are titles bestowed on members in recognition for work in the game or holding offices.

The most sought after title in Amtgard is that of Knight. Knighthood in Amtgard is broken into five orders: Battle, Sword, Serpent, Crown, and Flame. Each has different criteria, with some minor variations from Kingdom to Kingdom. A player that is a Knight may play the class of Paladin or Anti-Paladin without wearing a sash, instead wearing a prominent symbol of the Phoenix.

A Knight is allowed to choose members to become their pupils. Should a mutual agreement be reached, the member becomes a Squire to the Knight. Squires follow their Knights and assist them to the fullest of their abilities, on the field and off, in exchange for their tutelage. Often a Squire will assist in making garb for their Knight, as well as weapons or armor, and is usually seen assisting their Knight in combat, when they are together. These relationships tend to transcend the game, as much of the mentorship present in the knight/squire relationship is applicable to the outside world. In most kingdoms, when a player becomes qualified for knighthood the knights in that kingdom vote to decide if the player is ready to join the peerage. Knighthood is not guaranteed upon qualifying, as the award is intended to recognize character as well as achievement. A player is not required to be a squire before being knighted, though squiring for a knight in good standing with the kingdoms circle of knights insures that the hopeful player will be well represented.

== Organization ==

A common theme of medieval and fantasy feudalism runs through even the official level. Amtgard sub-chapters are generally organized by size, with smaller groups (called variously a &quot;shire,&quot; &quot;barony,&quot; &quot;duchy,&quot; or &quot;principality,&quot; depending on the number of active members and how long the group has been around) grouped under the larger or older chapters, called &quot;kingdoms.&quot; Each sub-chapter is contractually bound to abide by the official Rules of Play (currently version 8.6.2) and is sponsored and supported by one of the Amtgard kingdoms. Each kingdom is a Not-For-Profit Organization registered in their state of origin.

The kingdoms, along with their primary locations, are:

* The Kingdom of the Burning Lands, El Paso, Texas, Puyallup, Washington
* The Kingdom of the Emerald Hills, Dallas, Texas, Wichita Falls, Texas, Tulsa, Oklahoma, Northwest Arkansas, Arkansas River Valley
* The Celestial Kingdom, Central Texas

<doc id="770286" wikidata="Q487158" url="?curid=770286" title="Armenian Airlines (1991)">
<text>Armenian Airlines () was an Armenian airline company and the state-owned flag carrier of Armenia.

== History ==
Armenian Airlines was established shortly after independence in 1991 from Aeroflot&#x27;s Armenia directorate, and was the sole carrier in Armenia until 2002, when private companies Armenian International Airways and Armavia began to compete with it.

Profitable until 1997, Armenian Airlines began a decline in 1998 which executive director Arsen Avetisian blamed on the 1998 Russian financial crisis. Additionally, technical problems with its sole Airbus A310 helped lead the company towards financial problems. The company began to join forces with Belgian operator VG Airlines (later renamed Delsey Airlines); but the Belgian carrier had to file for bankruptcy on November 5, 2002. Armenian Airlines was reported to be looking for cooperation with Armenian International Airways to continue or restart its flights into Europe. When Armavia (which was owned by Siberia Airlines) entered into an agreement with the Armenian government and was granted most of Armenian Airlines&#x27; flight rights, including the lucrative Yerevan to Moscow route, Armenian Airlines was unable to recover, and officially declared bankruptcy on April 15, 2003.

On May 3, 2006, it was widely reported that an Armenian Airlines Airbus A320 had crashed in the Black Sea. The reports were evidently mistaken, since the airline had ceased operations in 2004. In fact, the airline involved in the crash was Armavia, the successor of Armenian Airlines. All 113 passengers and crew on board died.

== Routes ==
After being established, Armenian Airlines operated old Antonov An-12, Tupolev Tu-134, Tupolev Tu-154, Ilyushin Il-86, Yakovlev Yak-42 airplanes from the Soviet era. But following tightening of environmental regulations, these Ukrainian and Russian-built planes were banned from landing in European airports because they did not meet emissions and noise standards. Because of this, Armenian Airlines began leasing an Airbus A310 in 1998, with an option to buy. The contract stirred controversy among those who questioned why the Government airline was, for the first time, using a non-Russian-built aircraft. But some foreign agencies doing business in Armenia said they could not get life insurance for employees who flew on old Russian planes due to the aircraft history of problems. The Airbus, then, became the European link for the &quot;official airline of Armenia&quot;.Armenian Airlines faced disruption on its European operations following an engine failure on its sole Airbus A310 on January 21, 2002, which caused a Yerevan-Paris flight to turn around mid-air and return to Zvartnots International Airport where the crippled Airbus landed safely (previously, on September 14, 2001, and after taking off towards Paris CDG had the same engine failure returning to Zvartnots where all the emergency means had been activated, after four hours of waiting the flight to Paris was authorized to take place with the IL -86). On January 28 of the same year, representatives of Armenian Airlines visited London to discuss means for getting the Airbus repaired. According to directors of the company, the repair bill could have gone as high as $2 million, the quickest solution being to replace the damaged engine. Otherwise, the engine would have to be sent either to Brussels, Belgium, or Toulouse, France, for repairs. The A310 was the only aircraft in the Armenian Airlines fleet that met European aviation regulations. It flew every day on routes to Paris, Amsterdam or Frankfurt.

==Fleet==
At the time Armenian Airlines ceased its operations, they only operated one Airbus A310 aircraft, often used for travel to European destinations.

Additionally, their other aircraft included:

* Ilyushin Il-86
* Antonov An-12
* Tupolev Tu-134
* Yakovlev Yak-42
* Antonov An-24

However, due to strict European Union regulations, all of their Soviet-era aircraft were barred from flying to and from Europe.

<text>Wonder Bread is an American brand of sliced bread. Established in Indianapolis, Indiana, in 1921, it was one of the first companies to sell sliced bread nationwide by 1930. The brand is currently owned by Flowers Foods in the United States.

==History==
===Taggart Baking Company===
The Taggart Baking Company of Indianapolis, Indiana, began producing Wonder Bread that debuted on May 21, 1921, following a blind promotion with ads that only stated a &quot;Wonder&quot; was coming on that date. The brand was named by vice president for merchandising development Elmer Cline, who was inspired by the International Balloon Race at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. Cline was filled with &quot;wonder&quot; by the scene of hundreds of balloons creating a kaleidoscope of color resulting in the iconic red, yellow and blue balloons featured on the Wonder Bread logo. The logo was designed by commercial artist Drew Miller while he was on staff at a Chicago ad agency.

===Continental Baking Company===
Continental Baking Company purchased Taggart in 1925. This made Wonder Bread a national brand and added &quot;It&#x27;s Slo Baked&quot; to the logo. In the 1930s, Continental Baking began marketing Wonder Bread in sliced form nationwide, one of the first companies to do so; this was a significant milestone for the industry and for American consumers, who, at first, needed reassurance that &quot;wonder-cut&quot; bread would not dry out. The W. E. Long Company of Chicago, which had formed a cooperative of bakeries to market Holsum Bread, had pioneered and promoted the packaging of sliced bread two years prior, in 1928. 

Wonder Bakery Exhibit, in The Food Zone, 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair by Continental Baking Company had a wheat field, the first in 68 years, in New York City.

Unsliced bread returned for a period during World War II due to an industry-wide slicing suspension in 1943. Bread slicers returned two months later.

During the 1940s, Continental Baking began adding vitamins and minerals to Wonder Bread as part of a government-sponsored program of enriching white bread, which was notoriously deficient in vitamin and mineral content, to combat certain diseases. Wonder was also the first national bread brand to feature open dating and nutrition information on its packaging. In the 1950s, Wonder Bread further expanded advertising of its nutrient enrichments. The company sponsored Howdy Doody, with host Buffalo Bob Smith telling the audience, &quot;Wonder Bread builds strong bodies 8 ways&quot; referring to the number of added nutrients. By the 1960s, Wonder Bread was advertised with the slogan &quot;Helps build strong bodies 12 ways,&quot; with a list of health claims. In 1986, Continental introduced the lower-calorie Wonder Light bread.

===Interstate Bakeries/Hostess Brands===
Interstate Bakeries Corporation purchased Continental Baking in 1995. In 2004, Interstate Bakeries declared bankruptcy, putting the future of Wonder Bread in some doubt. In February 2009 Interstate Bakeries emerged from bankruptcy marking a &quot;new beginning&quot; for the baking company.

In 2006, Wonder was one of the first bread brands to introduce whole grain white breads in an effort to appeal to consumers who loved the taste of white bread, but were looking for more nutrition. These breads were made with an albino wheat variety that does not have the more pronounced taste of whole red-wheat flour.
On August 28, 2007, Interstate Bakeries announced it would soon end production of Wonder Bread in the Southern California market, leading to a loss of 1,300 jobs. This was due to a decline in sales, as Southern Californians in particular were partial to whole-grain breads and &quot;premium&quot; loaves. As of September 2009, Wonder Bread and other Hostess Brands breads, such as Home Pride, returned to Southern California supermarkets in response to significant consumer demand. In connection with the re-introduction, the company donated thousands of loaves of bread to the San Diego Food Bank and the Los Angeles Regional Food Bank.

In August 2009, Wonder reformulated its Wonder Classic and Wonder Classic Sandwich bread varieties to include more calcium and vitamin D. Two slices of Wonder Classic and Wonder Classic Sandwich bread then provided 30% of the daily recommended intake of calcium, the same amount as 8 fluid ounces of whole milk. Wonder 100% Whole Wheat (16 oz variety) qualified for the Women, Infants and Children or WIC program in most states. In November 2009, IBC changed its name to Hostess Brands.

In March 2010, Wonder extended its line of bread products with Wonder Smartwhite, which had the taste and soft texture of white bread, but the fiber of 100% whole wheat bread. In 2011, Wonder bread launched its first national advertising campaign in years, titled &quot;Always Wonder&quot;.

On November 16, 2012, Hostess Brands (Old HB) filed a motion in United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York seeking permission to close its business and sell its assets under Chapter 11. The company closed plants and began liquidation proceedings, temporarily ending production of Wonder Bread in the states.

===Flowers Foods===
Flowers Foods, owner of the Mrs. Freshley&#x27;s, Tastykake, and Dave&#x27;s Killer Bread brands, officially acquired Hostess&#x27; bread brands, including Wonder Bread, in March 2013. On July 22, 2013, Flowers Foods completed its $355 million acquisition of several breads, bakeries and other assets from the company previously known as Hostess Brands (Old HB), including Wonder Bread. Flowers Foods announced on September 12, 2013, that Wonder Bread would return to U.S. store shelves, with delivery of Wonder Bread to stores resuming on September 23.

==In other countries==

===Mexico===
Wonder Bread was produced in Mexico by Grupo Bimbo, the largest baking company in the world. Grupo Bimbo acquired the Mexican rights to the brand and factories in 1986 when it purchased the Mexican subsidiary of Continental Baking Company.

In 2013, Grupo Bimbo lost in their bid to acquire Hostess bread brands, including Wonder Bread (U.S.), to Flowers Foods during the liquidation of Hostess Brands (Old HB).

===Canada===
Wonder Bread in Canada was launched by Northern Bakeries Limited, a corporation formed in 1925 by merging six bakeries located across the country and immediately acquired by Continental Bakeries as its Canadian subsidiary. However, Northern Bakeries was taken back into Canadian ownership shortly after Wonder Bread began appearing on Canadian grocery shelves and home delivery routes in March 1927 in Montreal. In 1928, Northern Bakeries Limited registered the &quot;Wonder&quot; trademark with the Canadian Intellectual Property Office. At the end of that year, it was folded into Consolidated Bakeries Limited, controlled by Ogilvie Flour Mills. In 1930, Wonder arrived in Toronto, baked by Nasmiths Limited (founded 1850, a Consolidated subsidiary since 1928). Newspaper ads proclaimed &quot;Great news for the people of Toronto – it&#x27;s here at last – the delicious Wonder Bread.&quot; Made from unbleached flour and &quot;Slo-Baked,&quot; Wonder was said to produce &quot;more slices and thinner slices&quot; when cut, yet would not crumble. By 1934, &quot;Sliced Wonder,&quot; an early version of sliced bread, was being promoted by the Ideal Bread Company Limited of Toronto (another subsidiary of Consolidated), with no fewer &quot;than 26 slices in a loaf&quot;.

By 1940, Wonder Bakeries Limited had become the maker of Wonder Bread in Canada along with Hostess cakes and cookies, after being set up as a subsidiary of Consolidated Bakeries, although the local subsidiary bakery companies continued to be the actual manufacturers. New products were introduced that included Wonder Melior, &quot;a better white bread with natural wheat vitamins,&quot; as well as Wonder Peter Pan Bread, designed to appeal to children. Wonder Bakeries also became the maker of Hollywood Bread, marketed for those &quot;counting calories&quot; and trying to keep their &quot;figure&quot;. 

In January 1968, General Bakeries Limited took over Consolidated Bakeries, becoming the maker of Wonder. Then, in July 1985, Weston Bakeries Limited, a subsidiary of George Weston Limited, acquired certain Ontario assets of General Bakeries, then owned by Dominion Stores Limited, that included not only bread and roll plants but also the trademark for Wonder in Canada. The Canadian packaging, though not identical to the U.S. version, is very similar.

Between 2000 and 2022, Weston Foods added a number of new Wonder products to the brand&#x27;s line-up, many of which were designed to appeal to parents and their concern for their children&#x27;s nutritional needs. In 2011, Weston Bakeries Limited announced that its Wonder Bread brands would henceforth be free of artificial preservatives, artificial colors, or artificial flavors.

In 2022, the brand was sold by Weston Foods to FGF Brands and now operates as Wonder Brands Incorporated.

<text>Passion Fish is a 1992 American drama film written and directed by John Sayles. The film stars Mary McDonnell, Alfre Woodard, Vondie Curtis-Hall, David Strathairn, Leo Burmester, and Angela Bassett. It tells the story of a soap opera star (McDonnell), who after becoming paralyzed from a car crash, is forced by circumstance to return to her family home and rely upon a series of nurses for her basic care. Her anger and alcohol use forces each nurse to leave her employment, until one shows up who guarantees to stay.

Sayles based the screenplay on his experiences working as an orderly in hospitals and nursing homes.

Filming took place in the Acadiana region of Louisiana in May 1992. The film premiered in the United States on December 9, 1992, distributed by Miramax Films. It received widespread critical acclaim for its performances, direction, cinematography, and story. McDonnell received an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress and Woodard won an Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Female.

==Plot==
May-Alice Culhane, a New York actress on a daytime soap opera, lies in a hospital bed, confused and scared because she is unable to sit up. She attempts to press the call button but ends up switching on the TV, which happens to be playing a scene from the soap featuring her.

Culhane has been left paralyzed after an accident on her way to getting her legs waxed. With no other options, she returns to her family&#x27;s old and empty home in Louisiana, where she drinks hard, is dissatisfied with every caregiver, and wallows in self-pity.

Her outlook begins to change with the arrival of Chantelle, a nurse with her own problems. The two gradually find a heartfelt connection with each other, and as a result, their lives subtly change.

==Cast==
== Production ==
Director John Sayles said his inspiration for the story came from the film &quot;Persona&quot;, as well as his own experiences working as a hospital orderly. In recovery for a back injury, Sayles was in the queue for X-rays and observed many of the wheelchair-using patients were women accompanied by their nurses. Sayles said, “A lot of them were really bored with each other and not especially nice to each other. And these are people who spend at least eight hours a day together — sometimes 24 — and they may have nothing in common. So I started thinking about that relationship.&quot;

Sayles wrote the role of May-Alice with Mary McDonnell, whom he had previously collaborated with on &quot;Matewan&quot;, in mind. Filming took place over 34 days in Louisiana, beginning in May 1992.

==Reception==

=== Critical reception ===
On Rotten Tomatoes, it has an approval rating of 100% based on reviews from 25 critics.

Critics praised the film for its exploration of relationship dynamics, female friendship, and character detail. Emanuel Levy noted, &quot;Working again in the &#x27;woman’s picture&#x27; domain, Sayles showed he could deal with material usually seen in &#x27;TV Movie of the Week&#x27; in a mature, non-melodramatic way. Centering on female friendship, &quot;Passion Fish&quot; coincided with a cycle of studio films about female bonding, such as &quot;Thelma and Louise&quot;, &quot;A League of Their Own&quot;, and &quot;Fried Green Tomatoes&quot;.&quot; Levy continued, &quot;On the surface, the heroines play familiar types, but Sayles again shows his forte in etching deft characterizations, detailing the emotional transformation of each woman and the bond they establish once they get to know one another.&quot;

Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave &quot;Passion Fish&quot; four out of four stars and wrote, &quot;There are elements here of a vaguely similar relationship in &quot;&#x27;Driving Miss Daisy&quot;,&#x27; but Sayles has his own film, direct and original, and in the struggle of wills between these two characters he creates two of the most interesting human portraits of the year.&quot; Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; also lauded the film and observed Sayles &quot;refuses to make his characters simple or stupid for the movies.&quot;

Praise for the acting was unanimous. Michael Wilmington of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote, &quot;It’s a critical cliche to talk about Oscar-worthy performances in the flood of year-end candidates, but Woodard and McDonnell deserve a look—from everybody. In the movie, the two show us a developing love and respect that is subterranean, almost unspoken, seeping up beneath a contentious surface. They have the easy, emotion-stretching mastery and limber spontaneity that marks the best screen acting.&quot;

Critic Malcolm Johnson of the &quot;Hartford Courant&quot; also praised the cinematography and setting. He wrote, &quot;as photographed by Roger Deakins, &#x27;Passion Fish&#x27; mirrors May-Alice&#x27;s growing fascination with photographing the reclaimed world of her lost youth, a milieu Mason Daring amplifies with Cajun music. But more than a voyage into the bayous, &#x27;Passion Fish&#x27; is a celebration of sisterhood and rebirth, movingly enacted by two of our finest actresses.&quot;&quot;&quot;

In November 2021, the film was featured as part of The Criterion Channel&#x27;s series &quot;Between Us Girls: Bonds Between Women&quot;.

===Box office===
&quot;Passion Fish&quot; received a limited release on December 9, 1992, running for one week, the minimum required to make it eligible for consideration at the next year&#x27;s Academy Awards. The film earned $36,332 (14,385 of that in the weekend) in the week from showings in two theaters. After receiving Academy Award nominations in February 1993, the film was released to 191 theaters, where it earned over 99% of its gross of $4.8 million.

<text>Eugene Aram (170416 August 1759) was an English philologist, but also infamous as the murderer celebrated by Thomas Hood in his ballad &quot;The Dream of Eugene Aram&quot;, and by Edward Bulwer-Lytton in his 1832 novel &quot;Eugene Aram&quot;.

==Early life==
Aram was born in 1704 to humble parents at Ramsgill in the West Riding of Yorkshire. His father was a gardener on the Newby Hall estate, owned by Sir Edward Blackett. His father had a good knowledge of botany and horticulture.

He had a &quot;fair school education&quot;: reading and arithmetic. At 13 he started working with his father on the Newby estate. Sir Edward allowed him to make use of his library and he taught himself Greek and Latin. In 1720 he went to work as a book-keeper in a counting house in London run by Christopher Blackett, a relative of Sir Edward. He contracted smallpox in London, and became very ill. He decided to return to Yorkshire and found a post as a school teacher in the small village of Netherdale.

Whilst still young, he married &quot;unfortunately&quot; (a term then used for impregnating a woman before marriage) and settled as a schoolmaster at Netherdale, and during the years he spent there, he taught himself Hebrew.

In 1734 he moved to Knaresborough, where he remained as schoolmaster till 1744. In that year a man named Daniel Clark, a shoemaker in Knaresborough, and an intimate friend of Aram, was rumoured to have come into money through his wife. Aram discussed this with a friend Richard Houseman. They told Clark to start purchasing items on credit, as local shopkeepers knew of his sudden wealth. The shoemaker followed this advice and built up debts exceeding his capital.

Then, after obtaining a considerable quantity of goods from some of the tradesmen in the town, and rumours starting to spread that he could not repay the debts, Clark suddenly disappeared on 8 February 1744. The goods included jewellery and silver plates, and were of quite high value. It was first thought he had run off to escape his debts or to sell the goods. Soon after, Aram began clearing all his own debts. Neighbours commented on his new-found wealth and on the additional absence of Houseman. In April 1744 Aram left town and went back to London where he began teaching French.

Suspicions of being concerned in this swindling transaction fell upon Aram. His garden was searched, and some of the goods found there. However, there was not sufficient evidence to convict him of any crime and he was discharged, and soon after set out for London, leaving his wife behind. In London he found employment as an usher in a school at Piccadilly and learned the Syriac language, Chaldee (Aramaic) and Arabic.

==Travels==
For several years he travelled through parts of England, acting as usher in a number of schools, and settled eventually at the Grammar School at King&#x27;s Lynn, in Norfolk. During his travels he had amassed considerable materials for a work he had projected on etymology, entitled &quot;A Comparative Lexicon of the English, Latin, Greek, Hebrew and Celtic Languages&quot;. He was undoubtedly a pioneer in the field of philology, who realised, what was then not yet admitted by scholars, the affinity of the Celtic language to the other languages in Europe, and could dispute the then accepted belief that Latin was derived from Greek.

Aram&#x27;s writings show that he had grasped the right idea on the subject of the Indo-European character of the Celtic languages, which was not established until James Cowles Prichard published his book, &quot;Eastern Origin of the Celtic Traditions&quot;, in 1831.

By 1758 he was living in King&#x27;s Lynn.

==Trial==
In February 1758 a skeleton was dug up at Thistle Hill in Knaresborough, while men were digging to find stone for building. Suspicion arose that it might be Clark&#x27;s body. Aram&#x27;s wife was interviewed and said she thought it was Clark and heavily implied that her husband Eugene may have been involved, having spent much time with Clark and also gave the name of Richard Houseman as a possible accomplice.

Houseman was found and questioned and confronted with the bones that had been found. He protested his innocence and, taking up one of the bones, said, &quot;This is no more Dan Clark&#x27;s bone than it is mine.&quot; His manner in saying this roused suspicion that he knew more of Clark&#x27;s disappearance. When questioned, he contested that he had been present at the murder of Clark by him and another man, Terry, of whom nothing further is heard. Houseman&#x27;s answers however indicated that the reason he knew the skeleton was not Daniel Clark was because he knew where Clark was in fact buried. On being pressed he gave information as to the place where the body had been buried in St Robert&#x27;s Cave, a well-known spot near Knaresborough. He also said that Aram had killed him. 

Aram had made no attempt to change his name and was tracked down in the school at King&#x27;s Lynn and arrested on 21 August 1758. He was sent to York and held at Tyburn Prison. Houseman&#x27;s testimony was admitted as evidence against him. The trial did not begin until 3 August 1759 at York County Court.
Aram conducted his own defence, and did not attempt to overthrow Houseman&#x27;s evidence, though there were some discrepancies in that; but made a skilful attack on the fallibility of circumstantial evidence in general, and particularly of evidence drawn from the discovery of unidentifiable bones. He brought forward several instances where bones had been found in caves, and tried to show that the bones found at St Robert&#x27;s Cave were probably those of some hermit who had taken up his abode there. He correctly pointed out that they had misidentified the first skeleton found, so the second body might equally be anybody.

He claimed that Clark had given him several items for safekeeping—which was certainly possible. However, Houseman claimed to have witnessed Aram kill Clark as they walked to the cave, and this evidence was damning. He said they had split Clark&#x27;s goods. Houseman had buried the items in his garden.

Mrs Aram said she found her husband burning clothes in the garden on the day after Clark&#x27;s disappearance.

==Death==
He was found guilty, and condemned to be executed on 6 August 1759, three days after his trial. While in his cell he confessed his guilt, and threw new light on the motives for his crime, by asserting that he had discovered an affair between Clark and his own wife. On the night before his execution he made an attempt at suicide by opening the veins in his arm with a straight razor.

Aram was hanged at York&#x27;s Tyburn in an area of the Knavesmire on 16 August 1759. His skull is preserved in King&#x27;s Lynn museum.

==Aram in literature==

In Frances Hodgson Burnett&#x27;s memoir &quot;The One I knew the Best of All&quot;, Burnett mentions Aram while describing her own guilty feeling after hiding a parkin (cake) in the cupboard as a child. She says, &quot;[I] was an infant Eugene Aram, and the body of [my] victim was mouldering in the very house with [me].&quot;

Thomas Hood&#x27;s ballad &quot;The Dream of Eugene Aram&quot; centres on Aram&#x27;s activity as a schoolteacher, contrasting his scholarship with his hidden murderous urges. Bulwer-Lytton&#x27;s novel &quot;Eugene Aram&quot; creates a Romantic figure torn between violence and visionary ideals, an image that is also portrayed in W. G. Wills&#x27;s play &quot;Eugene Aram&quot;, in which Henry Irving took the principal role.

There is a reference to the case in Mary Elizabeth Braddon&#x27;s 1879 novel &quot;The Cloven Foot&quot;, when the character Celia claims that John Treverton&#x27;s gloomy moods must mean he committed a murder in his early youth: 

Aram is also referenced in George Orwell&#x27;s 1935 poem &quot;A Happy Vicar I Might Have Been&quot;:

P. G. Wodehouse, in several of his fictional works, references Aram, and often quotes from the last two lines of Hood&#x27;s poem: &quot;And Eugene Aram walk&#x27;d between, / With gyves upon his wrist.&quot;

*In Chapter 21 of his 1905 novel &quot;The Head of Kay&#x27;s&quot;, when the hero Fenn loses his school cap in a possibly incriminating situation, he relates, upon its reappearance, that: 
*In the 1916 story &quot;Jeeves Takes Charge&quot;, Bertie Wooster, who has stolen his uncle&#x27;s manuscript memoir and is worried about hiding it, recalls:

Note: the phrase &#x27;I slew him&#x27;, does not occur in Hood&#x27;s poem.

*&quot;Bill the Conqueror&quot;, published in 1924, contains the reference &quot;It was with all the depression of a Eugene Aram that he strode from the pond and buried himself in a quiet, leafy by-way.&quot;

*In 1929&#x27;s &quot;Summer Lightning&quot;, Ronnie Fish is compared to Aram: 
*In Chapter 8 of his 1946 novel &quot;Joy in the Morning&quot;, Bertie recalls: 

*In Chapter 6 of the 1954 novel &quot;Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit&quot; (American title: &quot;Bertie Wooster Sees it Through&quot;) after being hauled before the Vinton Street Magistrate, Bertie tells his valet: 
Aram is referenced in the eighth chapter of E. Phillips Oppenheim&#x27;s novel, &quot;The Great Impersonation&quot;:
Aram is mentioned by Dr. Thorndyke in Chapter 11 of the R. Austin Freeman 1911 novel &quot;The Eye of Osiris&quot;, where Thorndyke expounds on the difficulty of disposing of the human body:
Aram is referenced in Chapter 6 of the 1947 novel &quot;Love Among the Ruins&quot; by Angela Thirkell : &quot;at which Mr. Marling went so purple in the face that his wife and son, closing in on him, walked him away like Eugene Aram.&quot;

<doc id="770311" wikidata="Q962049" url="?curid=770311" title="Frank Sedgman">
<text>Francis Arthur Sedgman (born 29 October 1927) is an Australian former world No. 1 tennis player. Over the course of a three-decade career, Sedgman won five Grand Slam singles tournaments as an amateur as well as 22 Grand Slam doubles tournaments. He is one of only five tennis players all-time to win multiple career Grand Slams in two disciplines, alongside Margaret Court, Roy Emerson, Martina Navratilova and Serena Williams. In 1951, he and Ken McGregor won the Grand Slam in men&#x27;s doubles. Sedgman turned professional in 1953, and won the Wembley World Professional Indoor singles title in 1953 and 1958. He also won the Sydney Masters tournament in 1958, and the Melbourne Professional singles title in 1959. He won the Grand Prix de Europe Professional Tour in 1959.

Sedgman was ranked as the world No. 1 amateur in 1950 by Harry Hopman and Ned Potter, in 1951 by Pierre Gillou, Hopman and Potter and in 1952 by Lance Tingay, Gillou, Hopman and Potter. Tennis de France magazine ranked Sedgman as the world No. 1 professional tennis player for the 1953 season. Jack Kramer, in his personal ranking lists, ranked Sedgman as the world No. 2 professional behind Pancho Gonzales for the 1958, 1959 and 1960 seasons.

==Career==
===Amateur===

Sedgman was a 180 cm (5&#x27;11&quot;) right-hander who played the serve-and-volley game that had just been popularised by Jack Kramer. He was one of a number of Australian players who used the Continental grip in which the racquet is held the same way for both the forehand and the backhand. He was particularly known for his volleying and speed at the net. When asked in 2005 who was the best player he had ever faced, Mervyn Rose replied, &quot;Hopman&#x27;s pet, Sedgie.&quot;

Sedgman led the Australian Davis Cup team to victory in 1950, 1951, and 1952. In a five-year span from 1948 to 1952 Sedgman won 22 Grand Slam titles in singles, doubles, and mixed doubles. Sedgman and his partner Ken McGregor were the only men&#x27;s doubles team to ever win the Grand Slam in a single year—they won all four majors in 1951. The following year they also won the first three majors, then, at Forest Hills, were upset by a pick-up team of another Australian, Mervyn Rose, and an American Vic Seixas, denying them eight consecutive Grand Slam victories. According to Rose in a 2005 interview, Harry Hopman, the coach of the Australian team, would not talk to him for two months afterwards.

====1945====
Although still playing in the junior events in Australian tournaments in 1945, Sedgman began to enter the men&#x27;s singles events as well. In June, he lost a close match to Jack Harper at the Elsternwick tournament. In December, at the Victorian championships, Sedgman beat Noel Kirkby before losing to Adrian Quist. Writing in &quot;The Melbourne Herald&quot;, renowned coach Harry Hopman called Sedgman a &quot;potential champion&quot;. Hopman also said, &quot;it is about a year ago that I advised him &quot;(Sedgman)&quot; to go to a gymnasium. The work he has done there – about three times a week after his work – has put on a stone in weight and improved him in many ways. His legs, wind and stamina are now first class. His temperament, too, is good&quot;.

====1946====
Sedgman began the year by reaching the final of the South Australian championships in Adelaide, where he lost to John Bromwich. Writing in &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot;, Bromwich said, &quot;Sedgman was not inclined to induldge in long drawn-out-rallies, and after the ball crossed the net three or four times, he either endeavoured to force the play or strived for an outright placement&quot;. Sedgman made his debut at the Australian Championships in 1946. He won his first match against Reg Clements, but lost in the last 16 round, to Geoff Brown in straight sets. Brown played &quot;faultlessly throughout&quot;, whilst Sedgman was &quot;not able to settle down, and did not look comfortable&quot;.

====1947====
In 1947, Sedgman lost in the opening round of the Australian Championships to Patrick Callaghan. It was his second appearance in the singles. He also won the Victorian Hardcourt Championships in June, beating Lionel Brodie in the final. The final was played in a strong wind. It was a &quot;closely contested final, which produced some brilliant tennis under most difficult conditions&quot;. At the Australian hardcourt championships in Toowoomba in November, Sedgman was suffering from strained muscles in his right shoulder in the final against Quist and lost in straight sets.

====1948====
At the 1948 Australian championships, Sedgman beat veteran former champion Jack Crawford before losing to Bromwich in the quarterfinals. At the West Australian championships in March, Sedgman beat Colin Long in straight sets in the final. According to the Melbourne Age, Sedgman&#x27;s success was &quot;due to stronger driving, more powerful service and greater all-court agility&quot;. At the French championships, Sedgman lost in the last 16 to Giovanni Cucelli. In June, Sedgman won the Kent championships, beating fellow Australian Jack Harper in the final. At Wimbledon, he lost in the last 16 to eventual winner Bob Falkenburg. At the U.S. Championships, Sedgman lost in the last 16 to Frank Parker. Sedgman lost in the final of the New South Wales championship to Bromwich.

====1949====
At the Australian Championships in January 1949, Sedgman beat defending champion Quist in the quarter-finals and former champion Bromwich in the final to win his first Grand Slam singles title. Sedgman &quot;gave a flawless exhibition of attacking tennis&quot; in the final against Bromwich. Bromwich was now 30, whilst Sedgman was 21. In the Gold Cup final at Toowoomba in April, Sedgman beat Brian Strohfeldt in the final. At Wimbledon, Sedgman had two match points against Ted Schroeder in the quarterfinals, but lost in five sets. Sedgman lost to Schroeder again in a five set quarterfinal at the U.S. Championships.

====1950====
Sedgman began the year by winning the South Australian championships in Adelaide, beating Jaroslav Drobny in the final in three straight sets, losing only three games. Sedgman won his second Australian Championships men&#x27;s singles title, beating Bromwich, Eric Sturgess and Ken McGregor. Sedgman&#x27;s superior groundstrokes were a key factor in his victory over McGregor. Sedgman won the West Australian Championships beating Clive Wilderspin in the final, showing a &quot;much superior brand of tennis&quot; than he had in earlier rounds. He then won the Australian Hardcourt Championships beating George Worthington in the final. At the French Championships, Sedgman was seeded second, but surprisingly lost in the last 16 to Irvin Dorfman. At Wimbledon, Sedgman was top seeded. He beat Art Larsen and Drobny (both from two sets to love down), before losing the final to Budge Patty in four sets. Sedgman lost in the last 16 of the U.S. Championships to Earl Cochell. In September, Sedgman won the Pacific Southwest Championships in straight sets against Schroeder, though Schroeder was suffering from a knee injury in the latter stages. In November, Sedgman beat reigning U.S. singles champion Larsen in straight sets in the final of the Queensland Championships. Larsen beat Sedgman in the final of the New South Wales Championships, but in December, Sedgman beat Larsen in the final of the Victorian Championships Sedgman was ranked world No. 1 amateur by Harry Hopman and by Ned Potter.

====1951====
Sedgman began the year by winning the South Australian Championships, beating Larsen in the final. He failed in his bid to win a hat-trick of Australian singles titles, when he lost in the semifinals of the 1951 championships to Dick Savitt. Sedgman beat Rose in the final of the MCC championships in Melbourne in March and later in the month was victorious in the Australian hardcourt tournament in Tasmania over Don Candy. Sedgman lost to Drobny in the semifinals of the French Championships. Top-seeded at Wimbledon, Sedgman led by two sets to love against Herbert Flam in the quarterfinals, but lost in five sets. At the Newport championships in August, Sedgman beat Mervyn Rose in the final to become the first overseas winner of the men&#x27;s singles since 1916. At the U.S. Championships, Sedgman beat Bill Talbert, Tony Trabert, Larsen and Vic Seixas to win the title. He then retained his Pacific Southwest title in Los Angeles, beating Trabert in the final, by manoeuvering him out of position. Sedgman beat Ian Ayre in the final of the Queensland championships in November. In December, Sedgman beat three of the best American amateurs Trabert, Seixas and Savitt to win the Victorian Championships. In late 1951, Sedgman was tempted to turn professional for 1952. Harry Hopman, however, led a fund-raising drive via his newspaper column in the &quot;Melbourne Herald&quot; to keep Sedgman an amateur. Enough money was raised to purchase a gasoline station in the name of Sedgman&#x27;s future bride. Sedgman remained an amateur for another year. Sedgman was ranked world No. 1 amateur No. 1 by Pierre Gillou,
Harry Hopman and Ned Potter.

====1952====
Sedgman began the year in January by winning the Manly seaside tournament beating McGregor in the final. Later in the month, Sedgman lost to his doubles partner McGregor in the final of the Australian Championships. Sedgman won the Asian Championships in February beating Tony Mottram in the final. Sedgman won titles in Cannes in March (over Milo Branovic) and in Beaulieu in April (over Philippe Washer). At the French Championships, Sedgman beat Patty and Sturgess before losing in the final to Drobny, but Sedgman had beaten Drobny in the finals of the Monte Carlo tournament and the Italian Championships. Sedgman had a successful tour of Britain, where he won the Sutton event in April, the Harrogate tournament in May beating Sturgess in the final, the Northern tournament in June over Candy and the Queens club tournament over Rose. Sedgman also won his first Wimbledon singles title (it was the third year in a row he had been number one seed). In 2012, Sedgman said &quot;You always wanted to win the Wimbledon title and I had offers to turn professional before I won Wimbledon and I had put it off because I thought, gee, I wanted to win the Wimbledon title to cap your career, really, as an amateur&quot;. To win the Wimbledon title, Sedgman beat Sturgess, Rose and Drobny. Sedgman won the Velbert tournament in July beating Sturgess in the final. Sedgman beat Rose to win the Newport tournament in August. At the U.S. Championships, Sedgman beat Lew Hoad, Rose and Gardnar Mulloy to retain his title. In November, Sedgman (hampered by a blistered hand) beat 18 year old Ken Rosewall in five sets in the semifinals of the Queensland Championships before overcoming Rose in five sets in the final. Sedgman won the New South Wales Championships over McGregor. Sedgman was ranked world No. 1 amateur by Lance Tingay,
Pierre Gillou,
Harry Hopman
and Ned Potter. Sedgman turned professional at the end of the year.

===Professional===
====1953====
Sedgman faced Jack Kramer in the 1953 World Series tour. Sedgman began the tour well and opened up an 11–6 lead (Kramer had been suffering from the flu during several matches). However, by winning in Houston on 11 March, Kramer opened up a 28–19 lead. In the end, Kramer won 54 matches to 41. The tour grossed $860,000. Sedgman won the tournament at Wembley beating Don Budge and Pancho Gonzales (both in straight sets). Sedgman won the tournament in Paris, beating Gonzales in the final. Sedgman beat Dinny Pails and Segura at Vienna and Geneva. Tennis de France magazine ranked Sedgman as the world No. 1 professional tennis player for the 1953 season. This gave Sedgman world number one rankings for both the amateur tennis world and for the contract tennis professionals in his career record.

====1954–1955====
In 1954, Sedgman competed in the World Series alongside Gonzales, Pancho Segura, Budge, Bobby Riggs and Carl Earn. On the opening night of the tour at Madison Square Garden, Sedgman led Gonzales by a set and 5–3, but Gonzales took the second set 11-9 and the third set 13–11 to claim victory. Gonzales went on to win the series. Sedgman was runner-up to Gonzales in the Cleveland version of the U.S. Pro, played under the billed name of Cleveland World Pro Championships. In September and October, Sedgman won a 4-man tour of Asia over Gonzales, Segura, and Kramer. In November, Sedgman won the Australian professional championships in Perth beating Gonzales and then Segura in the final. Sedgman toured Australia in 1954–55 with Gonzales, Segura, McGregor and Ian Ayre. Gonzales won the tour. Sedgman missed approximately four and a half months tennis in 1955 due to an operation for appendicitis.

====1956–1957====
Sedgman missed the first months of 1956.
In September 1956, Sedgman beat Tony Trabert in the semi-finals of the tournament at Wembley, but lost in the final to Gonzales, despite leading by a set and 4–1. Sedgman won round robin tournaments at Brisbane and Kooyong in December against Trabert, Segura, and Hartwig. In 1957, Sedgman won the Perth round robin event in January beating Segura, Rex Hartwig and Trabert. Sedgman beat Ken Rosewall in three straight sets in 57 minutes in their first match against each other as professionals in the semifinals at the Ampol Tournament of Champions at White City, Sydney, in February. Sedgman lost to Segura in the final. Sedgman finished runner-up to Gonzales at the Forest Hills Tournament of Champions (played on a round-robin basis) despite losing his opening match to Hoad, as he won against Rosewall, Trabert, and Segura. He lost the deciding match to Gonzales in five sets, although he led two sets to one.

====1958====
In February 1958, Sedgman won the Ampol Masters Pro at the White City stadium, Sydney, earning him AUS£2,000 in first-prize money. He defeated both Gonzales and Trabert in five set matches to win the tournament. Kramer designated the Sydney Masters of 1958 as one of the four major professional tournaments. At Wembley in 1958, Sedgman beat Gonzales in the semifinals and Trabert in the final to win his second Wembley title, five years after his first. Kramer ranked Sedgman No. 2 in his pro ranking for 1958.

====1959====
Sedgman won the Melbourne event in the Ampol world series in January 1959, defeating Gonzales in the final in three straight sets. The match was played outdoors on a slow wooden court at the Olympic Velodrome. Sedgman reached the final of the Ampol series event at Toronto on red clay, beating Segura and Hoad before losing the final to Gonzales. Sedgman won the Grand Prix de Europe tour in 1959, finishing ahead of Rosewall, Hoad, and Trabert. Sedgman beat Segura and Hoad before losing to Trabert in the final of the French Pro at Roland Garros in September, also an Ampol series event. Sedgman finished fourth in Kramer&#x27;s official Ampol point ranking for the year behind Hoad, Gonzales, and Rosewall.

Jack Kramer ranked Sedgman as the world No. 2 professional player in his personal ranking list (as distinct from Kramer&#x27;s point ranking) for the 1959 season behind Gonzales and ahead of Rosewall and Hoad.

====1960–1965====
By the 1960s, Sedgman&#x27;s career was declining, although Kramer ranked Sedgman as the world No. 2 professional player behind Gonzales and ahead of Rosewall and Hoad for the 1960 season. Sedgman was runner-up to Gonzales at the Cleveland event in 1961. In November 1962, Sedgman won the White City Charity event at Sydney, beating Luis Ayala in the final. Sedgman entered a period of retirement from the professional tour at the end of 1965.

===Open era===
Open tennis arrived in 1968. Sedgman returned to play in Grand Slam events at the 1970 Australian Open, where he lost in five sets in the second round to former champion Bill Bowrey. Sedgman won the Victorian Hardcourt Championships in October 1970 beating John Stephens in the final and won the title again in 1971 beating Neale Fraser in the final, a few days before his 44th birthday (he had won his first Victorian hardcourt title 24 years earlier in 1947). He reached the third round at Wimbledon in 1971. At the 1972 Australian Open, Sedgman beat fifth seed Owen Davidson before losing in the third round to John Cooper. He continued to play professionally until his 1976 retirement. His last appearance in the Australian Championships men&#x27;s singles in 1976 was 30 years after his first appearance (a record span at Australian Championships men&#x27;s singles).

==Broadcasting and promoting==
Sedgman commentated on various Australian TV channels (mainly on broadcasts of Davis Cup matches or Australian championships) from 1960 to 1976. In 1972, the LTAA appointed Tennis Camps of Australia to promote the Australian Open (Sedgman, Jim and Doug Reid and John Brown were the directors). The first year that Tennis Camps promoted the event (the 1973 event which began in December 1972 and concluded in January 1973) was also the first year that Channel Seven televised the event. &quot;I remember we gave the TV rights away (for nothing), so that we could get publicity for the event&quot; said Sedgman. Sedgman was one of the commentators for Channel 7 in the mid-1970s. He commentated on the Newcombe v Connors final of 1975, lost in the second round of the men&#x27;s singles that year and was still involved in promoting the event. Tennis Camps ceased to promote the event in the early 1980s.

==Honours==
Sedgman was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in Newport, Rhode Island and was made a Member of the Order of Australia in 1979; in 1985 he was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame. He received an Australian Sports Medal in 2000. Sedgman was appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia (AO) in the 2019 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours for &quot;distinguished service to tennis as a player at the national and international level, and as a role model for young sportspersons&quot;. In his 1979 autobiography, Jack Kramer, the long-time tennis promoter and player, included Sedgman in his list of the 21 greatest players of all time. In 2019 he was made an Officer in the Order of Australia.

<text>Bemidji State University (BSU) is a public university in Bemidji, Minnesota, United States. Founded as a preparatory institution for teachers in 1919, it provides higher education to north-central Minnesota. It is part of the Minnesota State Colleges and Universities system.

==History==

BSU was founded in 1919 and opened under the name &quot;Bemidji State Normal School&quot;. The first president, Manfred Deputy, was appointed to run the new institution, and the first class consisted of 38 students. The name was changed to &quot;Bemidji State Teachers College&quot; in 1921, then shortened to &quot;Bemidji State College&quot; in 1957. In 1975, it took its current name, Bemidji State University. During the 1998–99 academic year, the Board of Trustees recommended changing the name of the university to Minnesota State University–Bemidji, to reflect a change toward unification within the newly formed Minnesota State Colleges and Universities System after other larger institutions had done so. Prominent vocal and written opposition from students, alumni, and local Bemidji residents forced the board to withdraw the recommendation to change the name.

Current enrollment is about 5,300, with students from 44 US states and 40 countries.

===Presidents===
Faith Hensrud was named Bemidji State University&#x27;s eleventh president on April 20, 2016, and took office on July 1, 2016. She previously worked at the University of Wisconsin-Superior, having served as provost and vice chancellor for academic affairs since 2012. On August 13, 2021, Hensrud announced she would retire effective June 30, 2022.

There have been twelve presidents in the history of Bemidji State University.

==Academics==
Bemidji State University offers 47 different areas of study. Many courses are available online. BSU offers the only BFA in professional and creative writing in the Minnesota State system. The program includes a minor and certificates in electronic writing, consisting of courses in weblogs, wikis, web content writing, web design, digital rhetoric, and teaching writing with technology. Another unique program at Bemidji State University is the Indigenous Sustainability Studies degree; this is the only such program in the United States. Bemidji State also has a 96% rate of social work majors passing their licensing exams compared to the 76% rate for the entire state. In addition, Sattgast Hall is home to a number of natural sciences programs and pre-professional studies.
Bemidji State University accepts approximately 60% of students that apply. They also have an Honors Program which offers classes specific to participating students. Students from their honors program attend regional conferences.

===Foreign programs===
For 16 years BSU has had a relationship with Liaoning University, a university in China. Each year a professor from Liaoning University goes to BSU to teach Chinese and each summer BSU students participate in &quot;Sino-Summer&quot;, a month-long visit to China with half of the time spent at Liaoning University and half touring other parts of China including Beijing, Xi&#x27;an and Guilin.

==Student life==

===Student government===
The Bemidji State University Student Association holds weekly meetings where the student senate influences life on campus. The members of the student senate are from a diverse group of students based on a number of factors including their year in school. They are voted in by the students through popular elections.

===Clubs and organizations===
Bemidji State University provides over 100 clubs and organizations, both on and off campus. 
These clubs include interests in music, art, culture, outdoors, business, engineering, athletics, faith, and select majors and minors for students interested in research. Bemidji State only has two active Greek life organizations on campus, Theta Tau Epsilon fraternity and Delta Theta Kappa sorority.

===Residence halls===
The university has five residence halls (Linden, Pine, Birch, Oak, and Tamarack), as well as Cedar and University Heights apartments. Freshmen are required to live in either Oak Hall or Tamarack Hall, with few exceptions. Linden offers suites that house two to three people. Pine has single-gender floors with single rooms or two person dorms. Birch is the closest dorms to the academic buildings, and has single and double dorm rooms. Cedar Apartments offers single parents a place to live on campus. It provides a fenced outdoor playground and an indoor play area for children. Tamarack Hall is the tallest building in Beltrami County.

===Sustainability===
Bemidji State University is taking steps to reduce their environmental impact and have pledged to be carbon-neutral by 2050. They have an office on campus devoted to sustainability efforts. The sustainability office provides a bike rental service for students called &quot;Bucky&#x27;s Bikes&quot; and a place where items may be donated and are given away to students at no charge. The Sustainability Office is funded by a student &quot;green fee&quot; of $7.50 a semester.

===Homecoming tradition===
In a tradition dating back to the mid-1990s, anytime the team wins homecoming, the players run from the football stadium to nearby Lake Bemidji and dive in. The tradition dates to 1995 when Bemidji State upset the defending conference champion Winona State University in the homecoming game and took their first &quot;victory dip&quot; in the lake. The roots of the tradition date back two years earlier however when, in 1993, an assistant coach attempted to inspire the winless team. He wrote a fictional news story of the upcoming homecoming game. In his account, the team earned an upset homecoming victory and dove into Lake Bemidji in celebration. A real-world victory didn&#x27;t happen in 1993, nor 1994, but when homecoming victory came in 1995 it was time to get wet. Between 1995 and 2012 the Beavers have won twelve of the seventeen homecoming games.

===Student publications and news sources===
Bemidji State University has several student-run publications and news sources. They include &quot;CRE8&quot; magazine, the &quot;Northern Student Magazine&quot;, and KBSU-TV, KBSU FM 90.

&quot;CRE8&quot; showcases creative works by writers and artists from northern Minnesota. &quot;CRE8 accepts&quot; fiction and nonfiction submissions with a word count of 4,000 or less and poetry submissions of 75 lines or less per poem. English instructor Maureen Gibbon created the online magazine.

In 2019, the English department launched the new student publication &quot;Paper Plains&quot;, with Maureen Gibbon in position as the academic advisor.

&quot;The Northern Student&quot; became Bemidji State&#x27;s campus newspaper in 1926. Since its conception, the newspaper has been solely staffed and managed by students, as well as published and distributed weekly at no charge to its readers. In the early 70s, the &quot;Northern Student&quot; merged with the Mass Comm. Dept. at the influence of James McMahon, the public relations director for Bemidji State at the time, who also served as the newspaper&#x27;s adviser. In 1988, the newspaper was produced through Newspaper Production, a three-credit Mass Comm. course taught and advised by Louise Mengelkoch. During this period, the &quot;Northern Student&quot; stopped receiving funds from the Student Activity Fee Allocation Committee, and was produced strictly on advertising revenue. After a lawsuit, the &quot;Northern Student&quot; and Mass Comm. Dept. separated in 1992, and the newspaper relocated to the Hobson Memorial Union. Al Nohner, director of Communications and Marketing, created a media board of faculty, students, and community members to choose future editors-in-chief and advisers, as well as to advise the newspaper. A few years later, the &quot;Northern Student&quot; began receiving funds from the Student Activity Fee Allocation Committee again. For over a decade the &quot;Northern Student&quot; functioned outside the Mass Comm. Dept. In the fall of 2009, the paper was without an adviser. After the paper was threatened with a lawsuit, the media board appointed an adviser, who was forced to retire less than a year later. In May 2010, the newspaper returned to the Mass Comm. Dept., the media board was disbanded, and a new adviser from the Mass Comm. Dept. was appointed. During the following fall, the &quot;Northern Student&quot; briefly partnered with the &quot;Bemidji Pioneer&quot; for advertising and began placing issues of the &quot;Bemidji Pioneer&quot; inside the &quot;Northern Student&quot;. After three months of publication, it was determined that the two newspapers should remain completely separate.

==Athletics==

The school sports teams are called the Beavers. They are members of the Northern Sun Intercollegiate Conference competing in NCAA Division II, with the exception of men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s ice hockey teams, which compete in the Central Collegiate Hockey Association and the Western Collegiate Hockey Association at the NCAA Division I level, respectively.

<text>In molecular biology and genetics, a blot is a method of transferring large biomolecules (proteins, DNA or RNA) onto a carrier, such as a membrane composed of nitrocellulose, polyvinylidene fluoride or nylon. In many instances, this is done after a gel electrophoresis, transferring the molecules from the gel onto the blotting membrane, and other times adding the samples directly onto the membrane. After the blotting, the transferred molecules are then visualized by colorant staining (for example, silver staining of proteins), autoradiographic visualization of radiolabelled molecules (performed before the blot), or specific labelling of some proteins or nucleic acids. The latter is done with antibodies or hybridization probes that bind only to some molecules of the blot and have an enzyme joined to them. After proper washing, this enzymatic activity (and so, the molecules found in the blot) is visualized by incubation with a proper reagent, rendering either a colored deposit on the blot or a chemiluminescent reaction which is registered by photographic film.

==Southern blot==
A Southern blot is a method routinely used in molecular biology for detection of a specific DNA sequence in DNA samples. Southern blotting combines transfer of electrophoresis-separated DNA fragments to a filter membrane and subsequent fragment detection by probe hybridization.

== Western blot ==
A western blot is used for the detection of specific proteins in complex samples. Proteins are first separated by size using electrophoresis before being transferred to an appropriate blotting matrix (usually polyvinylidene fluoride or nitrocellulose) and subsequent detection with antibodies.

== Far-western blot ==
Similar to a western blot, the far-western blot uses protein–protein interactions to detect the presence of a specific protein immobilized on a blotting matrix. Antibodies are then used to detect the presence of the protein–protein complex, making the Far-Western blot a specific case of the Western blot.

==Southwestern blot==
A southwestern blot is based on Southern blot and is used to identify and characterize DNA-binding proteins by their ability to bind to specific oligonucleotide probes. The proteins are separated by gel electrophoresis and are subsequently transferred to nitrocellulose membranes similar to other types of blotting.

== Eastern blot ==
The eastern blot is used for the detection of specific posttranslational modifications of proteins. Proteins are separated by gel electrophoresis before being transferred to a blotting matrix whereupon posttranslational modifications are detected by specific substrates (cholera toxin, concanavalin, phosphomolybdate, etc.) or antibodies.

== Far-eastern blot ==
The far-eastern blot is for the detection of lipid-linked oligosaccharides. High-performance thin-layer chromatography is first used to separate the lipids by physical and chemical characteristics, then transferred to a blotting matrix before the oligosaccharides are detected by a specific binding protein (i.e. antibodies or lectins).

== Northern blot ==
The northern blot is for the detection of specific RNA sequences in complex samples. Northern blotting first separates samples by size via gel electrophoresis before they are transferred to a blotting matrix and detected with labeled RNA probes.

== Reverse northern blot ==
The reverse northern blot differs from both northern and Southern blot in that DNA is first immobilized on a blotting matrix and specific sequences are detected with labeled RNA probes.

== Dot blot ==
A dot blot is a special case of any of the above blots where the analyte is added directly to the blotting matrix (and appears as a &quot;dot&quot;) as opposed to separating the sample by electrophoresis prior to blotting.

==List of blots==
* Southern blot for DNA
* northern blot for RNA
* reverse northern blot for RNA
* western blot for proteins
* far-western blot for protein–protein interactions 
* eastern blot for post-translational modification
* far-eastern blot for glycolipids 
* dot blot

<doc id="770319" wikidata="Q7039129" url="?curid=770319" title="Ninšar">
<text>Ninšar (, dNIN.SAR; also read Nin-nisig) was a Mesopotamian goddess commonly associated with the preparation of meat. The reading of her name remains uncertain, and its possible etymology appears to be unrelated to her role in the Mesopotamian pantheon. She was chiefly worshiped in Nippur, though her original cult center was the settlement AB.NAGAR.

==Name==
The reading of the theonym written in cuneiform as NIN.SAR remains uncertain. Wilfred G. Lambert considered Ninšar to be the correct reading. This option is also accepted by Andrew R. George. Antoine Cavigneaux and Manfred Krebernik instead argue that the correct reading might be Nin-nisig. Ninmu and Ninezenna have also been proposed as alternatives. According to the god list &quot;An = Anum&quot;, the name could also be represented by the logograms dMUḪALDIM (&quot;cook&quot;) or dGÍRI (&quot;knife&quot;). A syllabic spelling, &quot;Nin-nì-si&quot;, might be present in a god list from Mari, but both the restoration of the final sign and the identification of this deity with Ninšar remain uncertain.

The name NIN.SAR is usually translated as &quot;Lady Greenery&quot; or &quot;Lady Greens.&quot; One hymn to Nuska might contain a play on the name and the word SI12, referring to the color green. Antoine Cavigneaux and Manfred Krebernik note that the name&#x27;s meaning shows no direct connection with her well attested functions.

Ninšar should not be confused with Ninšár (&quot;Lady of All&quot;), who alongside the matching male deity Enšár appears in enumerations of ancestors of Enlil in sources such as the god list &quot;An = Anum&quot; and the incantation series &quot;Šurpu&quot;.

==Character==
Ninšar was associated with meat, and was often described as the &quot;butcher of Ekur,&quot; as already attested in texts from the reign of Shulgi. An even earlier text from Lagash from the reign of Urukagina calls her the &quot;butcher of Ningirsu.&quot; She could also be referred to with the epithet &quot;she who makes the food good.&quot; She is also attested in the role of a divine housekeeper. An Early Dynastic text refers to her as an artisan or carpenter (&quot;nagar&quot;). In various documents, she appears in enumerations of the courtiers of Enlil, with the sequence of Ninimma, Ennugi, Kusu, Ninšar, Ninkasi and Ninmada occurring in at least two sources, &quot;An = Anum&quot; and the so-called &quot;Canonical Temple List&quot;.

Her husband was the god Erragal, who like her was associated with knives. He is sparsely attested, and while he was likely distinct in origin from the better known Erra, not much else is possible to determine about him with certainty based on available documents. He might have been associated with the destruction caused by storms.

==Worship==
In the Early Dynastic period, Ninšar was worshiped in multiple cities, for example Nippur and Shuruppak. The &quot;Zame Hymns&quot; refer to AB.NAGAR as her cult center. She also had a temple in the state of Lagash built by Uruinimgina, most likely in Girsu.

Evidence for the worship of Ninšar is also available from Umma from the Ur III period. In the same period Shulgi built a temple dedicated to her in Ur.

In the Kassite and Middle Babylonian periods, a temple of Ninšar existed in Nippur, and it is possible that it can be identified with the E-šuluhhatumma, &quot;house worthy of the cleansing ritual,&quot; which is assigned to her in the so-called &quot;Canonical Temple List&quot; without a location specified. ,

The theophoric name Ur-Ninšar is common in sources from the Early Dynastic and Ur III periods. Other names invoking her are known too and continued to appear in the records from the Old Babylonian period.

==Mythology==
In the myth &quot;Enki and Ninmah&quot;, Ninšar appears as one of the seven assistants of the eponymous goddess, the other six being Ninimma, Shuzianna, Ninmug, Ninmada, Mumudu and Ninniginna. They do not appear together otherwise. However, in this myth they are collectively described as Šassūrātu, a term used to collectively refer to Ninmah&#x27;s helpers.

In &quot;Enki and Ninhursag,&quot; she is the daughter of the eponymous deities, and in turn becomes the mother of Ninkurra.

In a text known as &quot;The First Brick&quot;, which functioned as a formula recited during temple renovations, Ninšar is listed among the deities created by Ea from clay to provide humans with goods they could in turn offer to the gods.

A fragment of a myth known from Abu Salabikh mentions Ninšar slaughtering cattle and sheep while Ninkasi brewed beer.

<text>The Rogue Valley is a valley region in southwestern Oregon in the United States. Located along the middle Rogue River and its tributaries in Josephine and Jackson counties, the valley forms the cultural and economic heart of Southern Oregon near the California border. The largest communities in the Rogue Valley are Medford, Ashland and Grants Pass. The most populated part of the Rogue Valley is not along the Rogue proper, but along the smaller Bear Creek tributary.

The valley forms a relatively isolated enclave west of the Cascade Range along the north side of the Siskiyou Mountains. It is separated from the nearby coast by a high section of the Southern Oregon Coast Range. The valley is characterized by a mild climate that allows a long growing season, especially for many varieties of fruits, nuts and herbs. A regional manufacturing industry is centered in Medford, the most highly populated area of the valley. In recent years the valley has emerged as a wine-growing region and it is the location of the Rogue Valley AVA (American Viticultural Area). The mild climate and relative isolation have made the valley a popular retirement destination. The community of Ashland is famous for the Oregon Shakespeare Festival and Mount Ashland Ski Area. Interstate 5 follows the valley through Ashland, Medford and Grants Pass.

==History==

In the early 19th century the first European Americans began to pass through the valley, inhabited by the Shasta, Takelma, and Rogue River Athabaskan tribes of Native Americans. The early fur traders named this river the &quot;River of the Rogues&quot;. White settlers began to arrive in the valley after the Donation Land Act, which allocated of land to each married couple. Between 1836 and 1856, the valley was the scene of a series of bloody conflicts between European Americans and the Rogue River tribes. In 1850 gold was discovered on the Rogue River; the next year gold was discovered in the nearby mountains. Early mining activity was centered on the lower Rogue River, on Althouse Creek in Josephine County, and near the now-restored town of Jacksonville, west of Medford. During the gold rush some $70 million was extracted from the area.

==Climate==

Unlike the rest of Western Oregon, because of the rain shadow effect resulting from the close range of the Cascades and Siskiyous, the Rogue Valley is relatively dry when compared to the coast and Portland. Most of the valley has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate. Winters are chilly and rainy, but relatively dry and slightly colder when compared to the rest of western Oregon, with frequent fog, and occasional snow. Summers are hot and sunny, but dry, with low humidity. Temperatures surpass , on an average of 10–15 days during the summer. Because of the combination of heat and dry air, wildfires are a problem during the summer, and frequently, smoke will fill up the valley for weeks, reducing visibility and air quality. On average, the first frost occurs October 22, and the last on May 6. The Rogue Valley is in USDA plant hardiness zones 7–9. Sub-zero temperatures are extremely rare in the valley; the Rogue Valley International-Medford Airport has not recorded such extreme cold weather since December 21, 1990, when the temperature dropped to .

Due to the valley&#x27;s generally mild climate, it is used as a region to grow pears, and there are multiple vineyards. Medford has, on average, 175 sunny days per year, compared to 80 on average for the Willamette Valley, and 65 on average for the coast.

<doc id="770348" wikidata="Q1849813" url="?curid=770348" title="Blue Sky (1994 film)">
<text>Blue Sky is a 1994 American comedy drama film directed by Tony Richardson and written by Rama Stagner, Arlene Sarner, and Jerry Leichtling. The film stars Jessica Lange and Tommy Lee Jones, alongside Powers Boothe, Carrie Snodgress, Amy Locane, Chris O&#x27;Donnell, and Mitchell Ryan in supporting roles. It tells the story of a military officer (Jones) who uncovers a nuclear cover-up while grappling with his wife&#x27;s (Lange) erratic behavior, leading to a tense clash between duty and family. The film&#x27;s score was composed by Jack Nitzsche. &quot;Blue Sky&quot; was Richardson&#x27;s final film as director, as he died on November 14, 1991.

&quot;Blue Sky&quot; is based on the relationship between Rama Stagner-Blum&#x27;s parents, Clyde and Gloria Lee Moore-Stagner, during the 1960s when her father was serving in the army. The couple later divorced, and Gloria remarried before her death in 1982. 

&quot;Blue Sky&quot; was released on September 16, 1994 to generally positive reviews from critics, with Lange&#x27;s performance receiving critical acclaim. However, the film emerged as a commercial disappointment at the box office, grossing $3.4 million in the United States and Canada against a budget of $23 million.

&quot;Blue Sky&quot; won Lange the Academy Award for Best Actress, the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama and a nomination for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role. She became the second actress, after Meryl Streep, to win the Academy Award for Best Actress after previously receiving the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress (for &quot;Tootsie&quot; (1982)), an achievement that was not repeated until nearly 20 years later by Cate Blanchett.

==Plot==
In 1962, Major Hank Marshall (Jones) and his wife, Carly (Lange), face marital difficulties due to the pressures of Hank&#x27;s military career and Carly&#x27;s mental health issues. Hank is a nuclear engineer who favors underground nuclear testing, an initiative code-named &quot;Blue Sky,&quot; rather than above-ground, open-air detonations. Carly, a free spirit who appears to be mentally unbalanced, struggles with domestic monotony and her advancing age, causing tension within their family. Their move from Hawaii to a remote base in Alabama worsens Carly&#x27;s erratic behavior and unsettles their eldest daughter, Alex Marshall (Locane).

The day after their arrival, Hank meets with base commander Colonel Vince Johnson (Boothe), who dismisses Hank&#x27;s underground testing proposal despite strong scientific evidence. Meanwhile, Vince&#x27;s wife, Vera Johnson (Snodgress), extends an invitation to Carly for a social event hosted by the base officers&#x27; wives. At the party, Carly becomes intoxicated and performs an exotic dance, prompting Vera to persuade Vince to address Carly&#x27;s behavior, though Vince plans to remove Hank from the equation first.

Alex begins a relationship with Vince&#x27;s son, Glenn (O&#x27;Donnell). On their first date, they find what Alex believes to be a dud grenade, which detonates and reveals their relationship, adding to Vince&#x27;s motivation to remove Hank. Carly is invited by the officers&#x27; wives to participate in a dance recital and dedicates herself to rehearsing. Hank is then sent to the Nevada Test Site to oversee the initial underground test under Lieutenant Colonel Robert Jennings (McClendon).

During the test, Hank observes two cowboys in the testing area and requests that Robert abort the test, but Robert refuses, disregarding the cowboys&#x27; safety and sending Hank back to Alabama. While Hank is away, Alex and Glenn discover that Vince has orchestrated Hank&#x27;s removal to pursue an affair with Carly.

Hank learns of the affair during the dance recital and reacts violently, leading to Carly being pushed out of a window and hospitalized. Hank is subsequently arrested, and Vince presents Carly with a choice: to either have Hank court-martialed or commit him to a psychiatric facility. Hank expresses a preference for court-martialing to publicize the incident with the cowboys but realizes he has been set up by Vince. Before he can act on this realization, MPs (Military police) transport him to the hospital, where he is heavily sedated.

Suspecting foul play, Carly investigates Hank&#x27;s documents and discovers the report on the cowboys. She drives cross-country with her daughters and finds the cowboys suffering from radiation sickness then urges them to expose their story. When they refuse, Carly steals a horse and enters the test site to reenact their experience, attracting media attention. As a result, Robert is forced to release both Carly and Hank.

Carly returns home to find Hank waiting for her, having resigned from his position, and that Vince has been relieved of his duties. Hank announces a new job opportunity in the private sector in California, and the family moves happily to start anew.

==Reception==
===Critical Response===
&quot;Blue Sky&quot; received generally positive reviews from critics, with Lange&#x27;s performance receiving critical acclaim. The film holds an 80% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 25 reviews, with an average rating of 6.4/10.

&quot;The New Yorker&quot; praised Lange, describing her role as &quot;a stunning performance—perhaps the best of [her] remarkable career,&quot; while &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; described her performance as &quot;a fierce, brave, sexually-charged performance, one of the most convincing portrayals I&#x27;ve seen of someone whose behavior flirts with craziness without quite crossing into it.&quot; The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; also lauded her work, calling it &quot;striking&quot; and noting that &quot;Lange&#x27;s acting in &quot;Blue Sky&quot; leaves you awestruck. It&#x27;s a great performance — probably her best.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; highlighted Lange&#x27;s &quot;full-blown star turn&quot; as Carly Marshall, observing that &quot;Brigitte Bardot and Marilyn Monroe are about the only other actresses one can imagine pulling off such a role as well as Lange has... [She] has the showy role, with almost unlimited opportunities to emote and strut her stuff, which she does magnificently and with total abandon.&quot; &quot;The Washington Post&quot; described her portrayal as &quot;a plush, platinum star turn,&quot; noting, &quot;She is what Carly imagines she might have become if only she hadn&#x27;t been a military wife: mostly Monroe with a soupçon of Bardot.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; echoed these sentiments, stating, &quot;It is a lavish role for Ms. Lange, and she brings to it fierce emotions and tact. [It] echoes [her] dazzling role in &quot;Frances&quot; (1982),&quot; while the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; observed, &quot;Lange smolders, storms, rages and whimpers through &quot;Blue Sky&quot;, acting with every muscle in her body.&quot;

<text>Werner Arber (born 3 June 1929 in Gränichen, Aargau) is a Swiss microbiologist and geneticist. Along with American researchers Hamilton Smith and Daniel Nathans, Werner Arber shared the 1978 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for the discovery of restriction endonucleases. Their work would lead to the development of recombinant DNA technology.

==Life and career==

Arber studied chemistry and physics at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zürich from 1949 to 1953. Late in 1953, he took an assistantship for electron microscopy at the University of Geneva, in time left the electron microscope, went on to research bacteriophages and write his dissertation on defective lambda prophage mutants. In his Nobel Autobiography, he writes:

In the summer of 1956, we learned about experiments made by Larry Morse and Esther and Joshua Lederberg on the lambda-mediated transduction (gene transfer from one bacterial strain to another by a bacteriophage serving as vector) of bacterial determinants for galactose fermentation. Since these investigators had encountered defective lysogenic strains among their transductants, we felt that such strains should be included in the collection of lambda prophage mutants under study in our laboratory. Very rapidly, thanks to the stimulating help by Jean Weigle and Grete Kellenberger, this turned out to be extremely fruitful. ... This was the end of my career as an electron microscopist and in chosing genetic and physiological approaches I became a molecular geneticist.
Arber received his doctorate in 1958 from the University of Geneva. He then worked at the University of Southern California in phage genetics with Gio (&quot;Joe&quot;) Bertani starting in the summer of 1958. Late in 1959 he accepted an offer to return to Geneva at the beginning of 1960, but only after spending &quot;several very fruitful weeks&quot; at each of the laboratories of Gunther Stent (University of California, Berkeley), Joshua Lederberg and Esther Lederberg (Stanford University) and Salvador Luria (Massachusetts Institute of Technology). Arber notes that it was in 1963, while he was a researcher in Stent&#x27;s Berkeley lab, when experiments produced the first evidence that modification in &quot;E. coli&quot; B and K is brought about by nucleotide methylation.

Back at the University of Geneva, Arber worked in a laboratory in the basement of the Physics Institute, where he carried out productive research and hosted &quot;a number of first class graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and senior scientists.&quot; including Daisy Roulland Dussoix, whose work helped him to later obtain the Nobel Prize. In 1965, the University of Geneva promoted him to Extraordinary Professor for Molecular Genetics. In 1971, after spending a year as a visiting Miller Professor in the Department of Molecular Biology at Berkeley, Arber moved to the University of Basel. In Basel, he was one of the first persons to work in the newly constructed Biozentrum, which housed the departments of biophysics, biochemistry, microbiology, structural biology, cell biology and pharmacology and was thus conducive to interdisciplinary research.

On 27 occasions since 1981, Werner Arber has shared his expertise and passion for science with young scientists at the Lindau Nobel Laureate Meetings.

Werner Arber is member of the World Knowledge Dialogue Scientific Board and of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences since 1981. In 1981, Arber became a founding member of the World Cultural Council. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1984. Pope Benedict XVI appointed him as President of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences in January 2011, making him the first Protestant to hold the position. In 2017, Arber retired as President of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences and was replaced by German scientist Joachim von Braun.

== Personal life ==
Arber is married and has two daughters, including Silvia Arber.

Arber is a Christian and theistic evolutionist, stating &quot;The most primitive cells may require at least several hundred different specific biological macromolecules. How such already quite complex structures may have come together, remains a mystery to me. The possibility of the existence of a Creator, of God, represents to me a satisfactory solution to this problem.&quot; In addition, he has affirmed: &quot;I know that the concept of God helped me to master many questions in life; it guides me in critical situations, and I see it confirmed in many deep insights into the beauty of the functioning of the world.&quot;

<doc id="770365" wikidata="Q798573" url="?curid=770365" title="Backyard Babies">
<text>Backyard Babies is a Swedish rock band originally from Nässjö and currently based in Stockholm. The band was formed in 1987 and have released eight studio albums, in addition to winning two Swedish Grammy Awards.

They are largely attributed with popularizing sleaze rock in Scandinavia and Sweden. Their single &quot;Minus Celsius&quot; appears as a playable bonus track in &quot;Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock&quot; and &quot;Degenerated&quot; is available as a downloadable song for &quot;Guitar Hero World Tour&quot;.

== History ==
Formed in 1987, Backyard Babies originally consisted of singer/bassist Tobbe (Tobias Fischer), guitarist Dregen, guitarist Johan Blomqvist, and drummer Peder Carlsson. They were then called Tyrant and played several live shows in their local area and recorded a rough demo. Tobbe was soon replaced by frontman Nicke Borg on vocals and guitar, and Blomqvist switched to bass. Fischer went on to be a professional photographer and web designer in Stockholm, continuing to work occasionally with his old bandmates.

In 1989, the band changed their name to Backyard Babies and recorded two more demos and did a national tour of Sweden. The band self-released a debut EP titled &quot;Something to Swallow&quot;. This got them signed in 1993 by Swedish label Megarock Records.

Backyard Babies released their debut album &quot;Diesel &amp; Power&quot; in 1994. The music on it took influences from rock, punk and blues. In addition to the album the band also released the single &quot;Electric Suzy&quot; with a cover of &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; by Hanoi Rocks as the B-side. After touring with former Hanoi Rocks members in Demolition 23 and doing a short headline tour in late 1995, premiering new songs that remain unreleased, the band was put on hiatus, as guitarist Dregen formed the garage rock band The Hellacopters. Dregen appeared on two albums with the Hellacopters&quot; &quot;Supershitty to the Max!&quot; (1996) and &quot;Payin&#x27; the Dues&quot; (1997).
The Backyard Babies reunited in 1997, with a new record contract with MVG Records. They recorded their most-critically acclaimed album, &quot;Total 13&quot;. Critics compared the album favorably to the New York Dolls, Ramones and The Damned. They toured the United Kingdom with good response. A single was released from the album, &quot;Bombed (Out of My Mind)&quot;, with the B-side &quot;Rocker&quot; featuring a duet with Hanoi Rocks frontman Michael Monroe. Their next single was the self-released &quot;Is It Still Alright to Smile?&quot;. The B-side of the single was a cover of the Faster Pussycat track &quot;Babylon&quot; featuring guest appearances from Ginger of the Wildhearts and Nicke Andersson who had played with Dregen in the Hellacopters. In 1998 the band toured the United Kingdom once more, this time in support of Alice Cooper.

After the collaboration on the song &quot;Babylon&quot;, Dregen, Ginger, and Nicke Andersson formed the side project Supershit 666, which released a six-track EP in 1999. Dregen returned to the Backyard Babies soon after as the band took off for another tour of the United Kingdom, this time in support of AC/DC.

The Babies recorded a follow-up to &quot;Total 13&quot;, titled &quot;Making Enemies is Good&quot; which has been described by some critics as a more &quot;controlled chaos&quot; approach than their previous effort. Two of the singles from it were hits &quot;&quot;The Clash&quot; and &quot;Brand New Hate&quot;&quot;, the latter of which was co-written with Ginger. They toured in support of the album with Motörhead.

On 15 October 2002, Backyard Babies guitarist Dregen was on the front pages of Swedish national newspapers. After returning home from a club where he was DJing, he and his friend were assaulted, robbed, and knocked unconscious. Dregen suffered a broken jaw but the band continued recording their next album; &quot;Stockholm Syndrome&quot;. The album, released in 2003, was viewed by some fans as a return towards a more energetic and raw sound. The album won them a Swedish Grammy. The album spawned three singles, &quot;Minus Celsius&quot;, &quot;A Song for the Outcast&quot; and &quot;Friends&quot;.

During 2005, the band toured the United States (with openers The Chelsea Smiles &amp; Crash Kelly) and Europe alongside Social Distortion. The album &quot;People Like People Like People Like Us&quot;, produced by Nicke Andersson of The Hellacopters, was released in 2006. It spawned two singles: &quot;The Mess Age (How Could I Be So Wrong)&quot; and &quot;Dysfunctional Professional&quot;. A self-titled album was released in August 2008. The first single was &quot;Fuck Off and Die&quot;. The second single &quot;Degenerated&quot; is supported by an animated video clip. Their self-titled 2008 album reached number 1 on the Swedish albums chart.

The compilation album &quot;Them XX&quot; was released in 2009 to honor the band&#x27;s 20th anniversary. The accompanying tour was rumored to be their last. After a hiatus, the band reconvened with an announcement in May 2014. Their 2015 album &quot;Four by Four&quot; reached number 2 on the Swedish albums chart. In September 2018 they played at the Hard Rock Hell Sleaze festival in Sheffield, England.

The band released their eighth studio album,&quot;Sliver &amp; Gold&quot;, in 2019.

During an interview with The Sound Lab in 2022, Dregen confirmed that Backyard Babies were on hiatus due to his commitments with The Hellacopters, but stated that were plans to create more music in the future.

<doc id="770370" wikidata="Q7126271" url="?curid=770370" title="Palace of the Fans">
<text>Palace of the Fans was a Major League baseball park located in Cincinnati, Ohio. It was the home of the Cincinnati Reds from 1902 through 1911. The ballpark was on an asymmetrical block bounded by Findlay Street (south), Western Avenue (northeast, angling), York Street (north) and McLean Avenue (west).

The &quot;Findlay and Western&quot; intersection was the home field of the Reds from 1884 through June 24, 1970, when the team moved to Riverfront Stadium. The location of the diamond and consequently the main grandstand seating area was shifted several times during the 86½ seasons that the Reds played there. The Palace of the Fans was actually the second of three parks that stood on the site:

:1884–1901: [[League Park (Cincinnati)|League Park (I and II)]]
:1902–1911: Palace of the Fans aka League Park (III)
:1912–1970: Redland Field, renamed [[Crosley Field]] in 1934

==History==

On May 28, 1900, the southwest grandstand of League Park, the home of the Reds since their days in the American Association, burned to the ground. The Reds were forced to spend most of May and June on the road while League Park was reconfigured to move the diamond back to its old location in the southeast corner.

After a season of playing in the southeast corner, Reds owner John Brush announced the club would build a new grandstand for the next season. The project started ambitiously in the spring of 1901. The term &quot;Palace of the Fans&quot; first appeared in March.[Cincinnati &quot;Post&quot;, March 19, 1901, p. 3] The club hoped to have the new stands ready by summer, but various delays set the opening back to spring of 1902, so the entire 1901 season was also spent at the southeast corner.

The Palace of the Fans, so audaciously named, also presented a striking appearance. Designed in a neo-classic style reminiscent of Chicago&#x27;s World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition of 1893, the Palace featured an extravagant facade, with 22 hand-carved Corinthian columns with elaborate details at the top, and opera-style private boxes in front of the covered grandstand. The grandstand actually sat atop carriage stalls so that the wealthy could simply drive directly to the game, an early precursor of &quot;luxury suites&quot;. It was built mostly of concrete, and was the second park (after Baker Bowl in Philadelphia) to use concrete for the bulk of its construction.

The grandstand was unique: a blend of Roman and Greek styling that had never been used before in a grandstand, and has never been seen since. The 3,000-seat grandstand featured 19 &quot;fashion boxes&quot; along the front railing that could hold 15 or more well-to-do fans. Beneath the grandstand, at field level, was standing room for 640 more spectators in a rowdy section known as &quot;Rooter&#x27;s Row.&quot; This section was so close to the players, the fans could take part in on-field conversations. Rooters Row was also strategically placed by the bar. The facade behind home plate contained the word &quot;CINCINNATI&quot;. This was obviously of no benefit to anyone in attendance, assuming they knew where they were, but it ensured that pictures of the stands would inform viewers. However, the designers of the park forgot to include dugouts or clubhouses for the players.

The original 1884 stand remained as right field seating, having escaped the fire. A less elaborate stand connected the old and the new structures. Both the contemporary club owners and modern baseball historians consider the 1902 structure to be a new ballpark. Cincinnati fans not interested in the hype continued to call the facility League Park, hence the alternate historical name, &quot;League Park III&quot;. Newspapers used the two names interchangeably, along with the occasional variant Fans&#x27; Palace.

On Opening Day, April 17, 1902, some 10,000 spectators crowded into the park and watched the Reds lose to the Chicago Colts (a.k.a. &quot;Cubs&quot;), 6-1.

The Reds had little on-field success during their stay at the Palace, but one event foreshadowed an historic development on this site: night baseball. On June 19, 1909, an exhibition game was held at the Palace under temporary lighting developed by George F. Cahill. This was not the first time night baseball had been attempted, but this experiment was deemed a success. In addition a soccer game between a Cincinnati team and a British touring team and a football game between the Gyms and Christ Church were held on October 14, 1909. Nothing would come of it, though, until the 1930s when night ball came to be seen as a necessity for boosting attendance and keeping ball clubs financially more secure.

When it opened, the Palace had been described as &quot;the handsomest grounds in the country&quot;.[&quot;Cincinnati Enquirer&quot;, March 28, 1902, p. 3] However, as with the original Columbian Exposition buildings, the Palace soon lost its lustre. For one thing, the seating area was too small. Then, over time, the structure fell into a state of disrepair; city inspectors began to note cracked girders, decayed supports and unsafe floors.

The last game played at the Palace was on October 12, 1911, against the Cubs, the same team they played when the park was opened. The day&#x27;s newspapers stated that as soon as the game was completed, workmen would begin demolishing the Palace to make way for new stands.[&quot;Cincinnati Enquirer&quot;, Oct 12, 1911, p. 8] Some sources also state that a fire accompanied that demolition.(Benson, p. 101) In any case, the Palace was done after 10 seasons.

Although the modified original 1884 grandstand (aka the right field seating) had survived various calamities during its 27 years of existence, the Reds had no intention of using it again. The remains of the entirety of the Palace of the Fans were demolished to make room for &quot;a modern and sumptuous stand, the equal of anything in the country.&quot;[&quot;Cincinnati Enquirer&quot;, October 12, 1911, p. 8]

By opening day of 1912, the Reds had an entirely new ballpark waiting for them on the site: Redland Field, which would later become known as Crosley Field. Its right field corner seating and its &quot;sun deck&quot; bleachers stood as an echo of the original 1884 stands.

<text>Reunion Arena was an indoor arena located in the Reunion district of downtown Dallas, Texas, United States. The arena served as the primary home of the National Hockey League&#x27;s (NHL) Dallas Stars and the National Basketball Association&#x27;s (NBA) Dallas Mavericks. The venue&#x27;s capacity held accommodations for 17,000 for ice hockey spectators, and 18,190 for basketball spectators.

Reunion was also a performance venue for some of the biggest names in popular music from the 1980s through the late 2000s including Michael Jackson, Paul McCartney, Prince, Van Halen, Frank Sinatra, Elton John, David Bowie, Madonna, Dire Straits, Gloria Estefan, Phil Collins, Mötley Crüe, Pink Floyd, Queen, Journey, U2, R.E.M. and Radiohead.

Reunion Arena was demolished in November 2009 and the site was cleared by the end of the year.

==History==

Reunion Arena was completed in 1980 at a cost of US $27 million. It was named for the early mid-19th century commune, La Reunion. Reunion Arena was notable for two lasts: it was the last NBA or NHL arena to be built without luxury suites, and it was the last NHL arena to still use an American Sign and Indicator scoreboard (though not the last in the NBA—see Charlotte Coliseum). The color matrix messageboards on that scoreboard were replaced in 1991 with Sony Jumbotron video screens.

===Home teams and sporting events===
The arena was the home of the Dallas Mavericks from 1980 to 2001 and the Dallas Stars from 1993 to 2001. Both teams moved to the new American Airlines Center in 2001. The Dallas Desperados arena football team used the arena for its 2003 season but ultimately returned to American Airlines Center.

The arena&#x27;s last remaining full-time sports tenant was the MISL Dallas Sidekicks, but the club was inactive after the fall of 2004.

Reunion Arena also hosted the WCT Tennis Tournament in the 1980s, including Virginia Slims Invitational Tournament. Due to scheduling conflicts in 1984, the WCT Tennis Tournament forced the Dallas Mavericks to play Game 5 of their first playoff series at Moody Coliseum, against the Seattle SuperSonics. While nearby Southern Methodist University competed in the Southwest Conference, Reunion Arena was known by University of Arkansas Razorbacks fans as &quot;Barnhill South&quot;, due to the big following by the Arkansas fans away from home; the Barnhill Arena was the home to all UA games until 1993. Reunion Arena hosted the Southwest Conference men&#x27;s basketball tournament in 1982–1983 and 1985–1996 as well as the 1986 NCAA Final Four.

Reunion was also a venue that was frequently used by World Class Championship Wrestling in the 1980s, in which the organization held its bi-monthly Star Wars events.

Reunion Arena also served as the venue for WWE&#x27;s December 21, 1999 and November 9, 2000 SmackDown show as well as the Fully Loaded Pay-Per-View event in July of the same year.

===Notable dignitaries===
Reunion Arena was long a hot stop for politicians campaigning in Dallas.

President Ronald Reagan spoke at Reunion Arena at a prayer breakfast of an estimated 10,000 people on Aug. 23, 1984, during the Republican National Convention. That night, he accepted the nomination for a second term at the Dallas Convention Center.

Reunion Arena was the final campaign stop for Ross Perot, the Dallas billionaire, in his 1992 independent run for president. He drew about 5,000 people.

In 1994, U.S. President Bill Clinton visited the arena to watch the University of Arkansas basketball team play in the NCAA tournament.

President George W. Bush headlined a campaign rally before 13,000 on behalf of Gov. Rick Perry on Nov. 6, 2006.

Barack Obama filled the arena to capacity of 17,000 at a presidential campaign rally on February 20, 2008, with many others turned away by the fire department. It was one of the last events at the venue before it was razed.

===Early events===
The arena featured 30,000 ft2 (2,790 m2) of floor space and had great sightlines, making it ideal for a number of events and games, including many high school graduations. Although The Who was widely promoted as the first concert at Reunion on July 2, 1980, the first musical act to perform at the venue was actually Parliament-Funkadelic on May 9, 1980. At least five other concerts including Boz Scaggs, the Commodores, The Oak Ridge Boys, Foghat with the Pat Travers Band, and a triple bill of Ted Nugent, Scorpions, and Def Leppard were all booked before the official opening in July.

===Notable music performances===

Listed below are artists and bands who performed at Reunion arena. They are divided up by the year they played, starting in the 1980s. The 1990s and 2000s are divided up a bit more by genre.

====1980s hitmakers====
This is a list of artists who constantly produced hits, and were considered stars during the 1980s, and performed at Reunion Arena.

==== Hard and classic rock artists ====
Reunion was considered one of the top venues for hard rock and heavy metal artists and in its first five years music videos for Queen&#x27;s &quot;Another One Bites The Dust&quot;, Scorpions&#x27; &quot;Still Loving You&quot; and Mötley Crüe&#x27;s &quot;Home Sweet Home&quot; were all shot in and around the venue.

===== Hard rock =====
===== Classic rock acts =====
Several classic-rock acts played the 18,000-plus seat venue including:
On March 18, 1995 Led Zeppelin principals Robert Plant and Jimmy Page—each of whom had played the venue as headliners and Page with British supergroup The Firm—reunited to play blues covers, songs from their respective solo careers and Zeppelin classics fin the style of their 1994 collaboration &quot;No Quarter&quot;. The duo returned to Reunion Arena September 27, 1998, in support of their follow-up &quot;Walking into Clarksdale&quot;.

===== Country artists =====
Country music superstars also dominated the scene at Reunion Arena in the 1980s beginning with a triple bill of Willie Nelson, Ray Price and Lacy J. Dalton on December 30, 1980. Other country artists of note at Reunion Arena included: 
==== Soul, R&amp;B, funk, rap and hip-hop acts ====
Many top names in soul, R&amp;B and funk played at Reunion including Teddy Pendergrass, Commodores, Diana Ross, Rick James, The Temptations, Ray Parker Jr., The Gap Band, Marvin Gaye, Al Jarreau, The Isley Brothers, Ray Charles, Luther Vandross, Earth, Wind &amp; Fire, Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips, and Kool &amp; the Gang. The Jacksons—brothers Michael, Jermaine, Jackie, Marlon, Randy and Tito—performed on July 11, 1981, as part of the Triumph Tour, performing both a Jackson 5 medley as well as covers of Michael&#x27;s 70s hits including &quot;Off The Wall&quot;, &quot;Rock With You&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop &#x27;Til You Get Enough&quot;, and more. In April 1988, Michael Jackson returned for a three-night engagement in support of his &quot;Bad&quot; album. Janet Jackson headlined Reunion Arena on July 2, 1990, touring behind her smash album &quot;Rhythm Nation 1814&quot;. Prince played two New Year&#x27;s Eve shows at Reunion Arena—on December 31, 1982, with Vanity 6 and The Time, and again on December 30–31, 1984, through January 1, 1985, with Sheila E.

The venue was also host to some of the first large-scale hip-hop and rap concerts in Dallas including Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five on November 29, 1980, and a triple bill with Run-DMC, Beastie Boys and Timex Social Club on June 15, 1986 (the Run-DMC/Beastie Boys pairing proved successful enough to warrant a return engagement on July 24, 1987). In the 1990s and 2000s hip-hop and rap acts as diverse as MC Hammer, Bobby Brown, Method Man and Redman, DMX, Jay-Z, and Eminem would eventually headline the venue.

==== 1990s and 2000 performances ====

=====1980s groups in the 1990s=====
Many 1980s stars played Reunion in the early 1990s including:
* Debbie Harry
* Tears for Fears
* Gloria Estefan
* George Michael

=====Pop acts=====
Top 1990s pop acts also played the venue, including Melissa Etheridge, Jewel, Ricky Martin, Backstreet Boys, NSYNC, Third Eye Blind, The Wallflowers, Everclear, No Doubt, Creed, The Black Eyed Peas, and Gwen Stefani.

Although legacy hard rock acts like Aerosmith and Rush continued to be big draws in the 1990s and 2000s the headliners at Reunion Arena were often aggressive radio-rock acts like Primus, Korn, Incubus, Pantera, Rob Zombie, Limp Bizkit, Staind, Bush, Blink-182, Marilyn Manson, Godsmack, Kid Rock, Rammstein, System of a Down, and Tool.

Alternative rock bands including Sonic Youth, Social Distortion, U2, Pixies, Morrissey, Radiohead, Garbage, The Smashing Pumpkins, Pearl Jam, Alanis Morissette and PJ Harvey all played Reunion Arena in the 1990s and 2000s.

After the Dallas Stars and Dallas Mavericks moved to American Airlines Center in 2001, that newer and larger venue also began to attract sporting and concert events. In early 2002, Reunion Arena booked engagements including Bob Dylan, NSYNC, Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young, and Paul McCartney. But the venue fell out of favor with music promoters that summer and went more than two years without a major concert event. The Black Eyed Peas and Gwen Stefani played on November 11, 2005, the last major act to perform at Reunion Arena.

The final performance at Reunion Arena was Christian hip hop act Group 1 Crew with Phoenix-based pop-punk group Stellar Kart on June 28, 2008.

=== Live recordings and music videos ===
The music video for Queen&#x27;s &quot;Another One Bites The Dust&quot; was filmed at Reunion Arena on August 9, 1980.

The video for the Scorpions&#x27; &quot;Still Loving You&quot; was filmed at Reunion Arena in 1984.

Mötley Crüe shot the video for &quot;Home Sweet Home&quot; partially at Reunion Arena (exteriors and time lapses) on October 2, 1985. The concert footage was shot two days later at Houston concert venue The Summit.

Judas Priest played June 27, 1986, recording the entire show which parts can be found on the &quot;Priest...Live!&quot; album. A full concert DVD was released as well. Pink Floyd played three consecutive shows at Reunion in November 1987. Pop singer Whitney Houston played two sold-out concerts at Reunion in September 1987.

Country music superstar Garth Brooks filmed his first television special, &quot;This Is Garth Brooks&quot;, in the arena on September 20, 1991. The concert became noteworthy after Brooks and guitarist Ty England smashed two guitars on stage.

Country music star Shania Twain filmed her performance for the Come On Over Tour in the arena on September 12, 1998, and later released on her first DVD, &quot;Shania Twain Live&quot;.

Frank Sinatra played Reunion Arena three times: in 1984, 1987 and 1989. His October 24, 1987, concert was recorded and released in 2018 as part of the &quot;Standing Room Only&quot; album.

Metallica&#x27;s February 5, 1989, show at Reunion Arena was broadcast nationally on FM radio and widely bootlegged. An abbreviated version of this recording was eventually released on CD in 2001 as part of the &quot;Fan Can 4&quot; box set.

===Motor racing===
A temporary street circuit at Reunion Arena, known as the Dallas street circuit, was set up around the arena, and used some of the surrounding streets. The track was in length, had 10 turns, and hosted its first event on September 19, 1993, with the Trans-Am Series visiting the circuit. The track hosted the SCCA Dodge Shelby Pro series in 1993, the Trans-Am Series between 1993 and 1994, and in 1996, and the IMSA GT Championship hosted its sole event at the circuit in 1996.

===Lap records===
The fastest official race lap records at the former Dallas Street Circuit (Reunion Arena) are listed as:

===Other uses===
On the morning of September 11, 2001, Reunion Arena was opened to serve as the location for an emergency blood drive.
In late 2005, the arena and the Dallas Convention Center were used as the primary Dallas shelters for evacuees of Hurricane Katrina.

===Closure and demolition===

After a unanimous vote by the Dallas City Council, Reunion Arena officially closed on June 30, 2008. In August 2008, the council said it would implode the arena if it could find an entity willing to foot the bill. The council hoped for the implosion to be part of a movie scene with the film company picking up the tab for the implosion. When no filmmaker seemed interested, the city decided to demolish it using other methods, a process which took several months.

Demolition was officially completed on November 17, 2009, and the site was completely cleared by the end of the year. Post-demolition, the site has seen little use. In 2011, Prince was to perform as part of Super Bowl XLV-related festivities, but the show was canceled due to inclement weather. And in September 2012, Cirque du Soleil&#x27;s &quot;Koozå&quot; took place here. As of October 2013, the adjacent parking garage remained standing and there were no plans for construction on the site. The parking garage is often broken into by the homeless and littered with trash. The trash clogs the water run-off drains often causing streets to flood during heavy rains. The city is aware of this issue and responds with “we are looking into this”.

==Former Reunion Arena site today==
The Reunion Arena site today is now known as Reunion Park with events throughout the year. In 2014, Bruce Springsteen played a concert at the park as the Dallas region played host to March Madness. In 2015, Weezer headlined a concert at the park.

<text>The NCAA Men&#x27;s Tennis Championships are annual tournaments held in the spring to crown team, singles, and doubles champions in American college tennis. The first intercollegiate championship was held in 1883, 23 years before the founding of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), with Harvard&#x27;s Joseph Clark taking the singles title. The same year Clark partnered to Howard Taylor to win the doubles title.

Since 1963, the NCAA organizes separate tournaments for Division I and II. A tournament for Division III was added in 1973. The NCAA discontinued the Division II singles and doubles championships in 1995.

From 1946 to 1976, players&#x27; individual performances were awarded points which were tallied to determine the NCAA &quot;team&quot; champion. In 1977, the NCAA began a dual-match single-elimination team tournament with 16 schools to determine the team championship. Subsequently, expanded to include byes for 12 teams in the first round, the team tournament adopted its current 64-team single-elimination format in 1999.

Texas Christian University won the most recent Division I national team championship in 2024, defeating the University of Texas at Austin in the final. Alabama&#x27;s Filip Planinsek captured the singles championship, and Ohio State&#x27;s JJ Tracy and Robert Cash won the doubles championship. Valdosta State University won the Division II national championship. The University of Chicago won the Division III national team championship.

The 2024–25 school year is the first of a two-year trial in which the Division I men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s championships will operate in a split-season format, with singles and doubles championships held in the fall and team championships in the spring.

<doc id="770418" wikidata="Q6638334" url="?curid=770418" title="List of sexually active popes">
<text>This is a list of sexually active popes, Catholic priests who were not celibate before they became pope, and those who were legally married before becoming pope. Some candidates were allegedly sexually active before their election as pope, and others were thought to have been sexually active during their papacies. A number of them had children. 

There are various classifications for those who were sexually active during their lives. Allegations of sexual activities are of varying levels of reliability, with several having been made by contemporary political or religious opponents. Some claims are generally accepted by modern historians, while other remain more contested.

== Background ==
For many years of the Church&#x27;s history, celibacy was considered optional. Based on the customs of the times, it is assumed by many that most of the Twelve Apostles were married and had families. The New Testament (Mark 1:29–31; Matthew 8:14–15; Luke 4:38–39; 1 Timothy 3:2, 12; Titus 1:6) depicts at least Peter as being married, and bishops, priests and deacons of the Early Church were often married as well. In epigraphy, the testimony of the Church Fathers, synodal legislation, and papal decretals in the following centuries, a married clergy, in greater or lesser numbers, was a feature of the life of the Church. Celibacy was not required for those ordained and was accepted in the early Church, particularly by those in the monastic life.

Although various local Church councils had demanded celibacy of the clergy in a particular episcopal jurisdiction, it was not until the Second Lateran Council (1139) that official made the promise to remain celibate a prerequisite to ordination within the Latin Church (and effectively ended any practice of a married priesthood). Subsequently sexual relationships were generally undertaken outside the bonds of marriage, and each sexual act thus committed would have been considered a mortal sin.

== Popes who were legally married ==

== Fathered illegitimate children before holy orders ==

== Known to or suspected of having fathered illegitimate children after receiving holy orders ==
== Popes alleged to be sexually active during pontificate ==
A majority of the allegations made in this section are disputed by modern historians.

<doc id="770420" wikidata="Q1857419" url="?curid=770420" title="Rice Stadium (Rice University)">
<text>Rice Stadium is an American football stadium located on the Rice University campus in Houston, Texas. It has been the home of the Rice Owls football team since its completion in 1950, and hosted John F. Kennedy&#x27;s &quot;We choose to go to the Moon&quot; speech in 1962 and Super Bowl VIII in early 1974.

Architecturally, Rice Stadium is an example of modern architecture, with simple lines and an unadorned, functional design. The lower seating bowl is located below the surrounding ground level. Built solely for football, the stadium has excellent sightlines from almost every seat. To achieve this, the running track was eliminated so that spectators were closer to the action and each side of the upper decks was brought in at a concave angle to provide better sightlines. It is still recognized in many circles as the best stadium in Texas for watching a football game. Entrances and aisles were strategically placed so that the entire stadium could be emptied of spectators in nine minutes.

In 2006, Rice University upgraded the facility by switching from AstroTurf to FieldTurf and adding a modern scoreboard above the north concourse. Seating in the upper deck is in poor condition, which led the university to move home games for which large crowds were expected to nearby NRG Stadium.

High school football games, especially neutral-site playoff games, are frequently played at Rice Stadium. It can also be used as a concert venue.

==History==
Rice Stadium replaced Rice Field (now Wendel D. Ley Track and Holloway Field), which had a total capacity of less than 37,000, in 1950. The new stadium was subsidized by the City of Houston, and it was designed by Hermon Lloyd &amp; W. B. Morgan and Milton McGinty and built by Brown and Root.

In addition to Rice, the University of Houston Cougars played at Rice Stadium from 1951 through 1964, and the former Bluebonnet Bowl was played there from 1959 to 1967, and in 1985 and 1986. The Houston Oilers of the American Football League (AFL) played in the stadium for three seasons (1965–1967), then moved to the Astrodome in 1968.

In January 1974, the venue hosted Super Bowl VIII, the first played in Texas, in which the defending champion Miami Dolphins defeated the Minnesota Vikings 24–7 with 68,142 in attendance. The game returned to Houston thirty years later in February 2004, for Super Bowl XXXVIII at Reliant Stadium.

===John F. Kennedy speech===
On September 12, 1962, Rice Stadium hosted the speech in which President John F. Kennedy challenged Americans to meet his goal, set the previous year, to send a man to the Moon by the end of the decade. In the Wednesday afternoon speech, he used a reference to Rice University football to help frame his rhetoric:

&quot;But why, some say, the Moon? Why choose this as our goal? And they may well ask, why climb the highest mountain? Why, 35 years ago, fly the Atlantic? Why does Rice play Texas? We choose to go to the Moon. We choose to go to the Moon. We choose to go to the Moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win, and the others, too.&quot;

Kennedy&#x27;s comments implied Rice had a history of losing to Texas; however, the two football teams had split 5–5 in their previous ten meetings and tied the following month. On the other hand, Kennedy&#x27;s comments about Rice-Texas might have been as forward-looking as his statements about going to the Moon (which did occur in 1969): Since 1963, Rice has gone just against Texas, including 28 straight losses between 1966 and 1993 and twenty straight from 1995 to the present.

===Monsters of Rock Tour 1988===

On July 2, 1988, Rice Stadium hosted a stop on the Monsters of Rock tour. The tour was headlined by Van Halen and also featured Metallica, Scorpions, Dokken, and Kingdom Come. This was also the Texas World Music Festival.

==Year by year==
===Capacity reduction===
As originally built, Rice Stadium seated 70,000, the second-largest stadium in the Southwest Conference (behind the Cotton Bowl). Rice Stadium was built before professional football came to Houston and while Rice was still competitive in the Southwest Conference. It was reasonable to expect 70,000 fans to attend a college football game there. However, as Rice declined on the field from the 1960s onward, the Owls found it increasingly difficult to fill the stadium. Even crowds of 30,000 were swallowed up in the environment.

In 2006, the end zone seats were covered with tarps, reducing the regular seating capacity to 47,000. The northern end zone was later demolished. , school continues exploring options for a modern seating arrangement with a reduced capacity.

== Features ==

=== Brian Patterson Sports Performance Center ===

Around July 2015, construction began on the Brian Patterson Sports Performance Center. This building makes up the north end of the stadium, and contain a weight room, a home team locker room, coaching and staff offices. This replaced the north end seating that consisted of crude concrete steps and was unused. The building was named for donor and former Rice University football player and alumnus Brian Patterson.


=== Robert L. Waltrip Training Center ===
On May 9, 2019, the Rice University Board of Trustees approved a proposal for an air-supported multipurpose facility on the west side of Rice Stadium that will offer climate-protected space for varsity athletics training, campus recreation and Rice student events, activities and community partner events. The 80,000 square foot inflatable structure rose up from the infield area of the bike track west of Rice Stadium for the first time in late July 2020, creating a facility to house practices, intramurals and other events when weather put those events in peril.
