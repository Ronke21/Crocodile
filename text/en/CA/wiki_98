<text>Georgios &quot;Giourkas&quot; Seitaridis ( ; born 4 June 1981) is a Greek former professional footballer who played as a right-back and occasionally as a centre-back. He has last played in 2013 for Greek Superleague side Panathinaikos, having played previously at PAS Giannina, Porto, Dynamo Moscow and Atlético Madrid. He is a former member of the Greece national team, for which he made a total of 72 international appearances, scoring one goal. He was part of their team which won Euro 2004, for which he was voted into the Team of the Tournament.

Both his grandfather and father, Dimitris Seitaridis, were footballers and eventually managers.

==Club career==

===PAS Giannina===
Of Pontic Greek heritage, Seitaridis started his professional career with northern Greek side PAS Giannina, nicknamed Ajax of Epirus, in 1997, becoming an important right full-back for the club. Seitaridis helped the team towards the promotion of the Super League 2 in the 1999–2000 at the Greek Superleague. He made a total of 40 league appearances with PAS Giannina, scoring 5 goals.

===Panathinaikos===
He was soon spotted by Athens-based club Panathinaikos, and on 12 January 2001 he signed a 5-year contract with them for a total fee of 300 million drachmas. He quickly established himself as a regular player for the team and at the age of 22 he won his first silverware by helping Panathinaikos do the double at the 2003–04 season, winning the 2003–04 Alpha Ethniki and the Greek Cup against rivals Olympiacos.

He scored his first European goal against Manchester United on 7 March 2001, in a game for the second group stage of the 2000–01 UEFA Champions League. In September of the same year, he was named Greek Young Footballer of 2001, along with Pantelis Kafes and Angelos Charisteas.

===Porto===
On 11 June 2004, a day before the eventually successful UEFA Euro 2004 campaign for Greece, it was rumored that Seitaridis signed for Portuguese side, and at the time Champions League holders, F.C. Porto, for a transfer fee of €3 million. However, the official announcement was made on 26 July 2004, almost a month and a half later, with rumors linking him to Real Madrid in the meantime. He helped the &quot;Dragões&quot; win the Portuguese SuperCup and Intercontinental Cup of that year.

===Dynamo Moscow===
On 23 May 2005, he was sold to Russian side Dynamo Moscow for €10 million, following the footsteps of ex-Porto teammates Derlei, Costinha, Maniche and Thiago Silva, who also moved to the Russian club the same year. Soon however, Seitaridis began to show his discomfort at the club, failing to settle in Moscow, and claimed the reasons he wanted to leave was that the weather was different from his native Greece and that he could not adapt to the cold. In his one-year spell at the club, he only managed to make 8 league appearances before deciding to leave.

===Atlético Madrid===
On 16 June 2006 he was transferred to Atlético Madrid for a fee of €12 million, being the second Greek footballer to play for Atlético after striker Demis Nikolaidis. The latter was the one who convinced him to join the club, together with his ex-Dynamo teammate Costinha who joined Atlético the same year. Seitaridis was sent off in the first half of his debut game, in the La Liga opening match away to Racing Santander on 27 August 2006. On 15 October 2006, he received his second red card only six games into the season, as he was cautioned twice in a home league game against Recreativo Huelva.

He scored his first goal for Atlético the following year, on 21 July 2007, in a game against Gloria Bistriţa for the Intertoto Cup. In November 2007, Seitaridis damaged his achilles tendon in a match against UD Almería, which meant he needed to undergo surgery. His period of absence was initially evaluated at about six weeks, but he was ready two and a half months later, in April 2008. Due to his injury problem, he only managed to make 14 league appearances for Atlético in the 2007–08 season.

The 2008–09 season did not start well for Seitaridis, as he lost his place in the first team to new signings Tomáš Ujfaluši and John Heitinga, and his heavy contract meant that Atlético was looking to sell him. Despite that, Seitaridis was a starter in Atlético&#x27;s opening game, in a 4–0 victory over Málaga CF, and went on to make 14 league appearances that season. On 29 April 2009 however, him and teammate Maniche were suspended by Atlético&#x27;s president Enrique Cerezo because they failed to appear in an Atlético home match against Sporting Gijón despite not being included in the 18-man squad. Two weeks later on 13 May 2009, it was announced that Seitaridis was released by Atlético a year before his contract was to expire, with a statement on the club&#x27;s official website reading &quot;Seitaridis is therefore free to negotiate with other clubs who may be interested in signing him&quot;.

===Return to Panathinaikos===
On 10 September 2009, the last day of the Greek transfer period for free agent players, Seitaridis signed a 4-year deal with Panathinaikos, returning to the team after five years. It soon became apparent that Giourkas was unfit and was struggling to re-establish himself due to frequent injuries, missing most of the 2009–10 season&#x27;s matches. However, on 21 March 2010, he surprisingly returned to the line-up for the big derby against rivals Olympiacos, and despite their defeat, Panathinaikos managed to end the season positively by winning the double. Seitaridis himself didn&#x27;t appear at the 2009–10 Greek Cup final against Aris Thessaloniki due to injury, but made 2 appearances on the road to the final.

The 2010–11 season started well for Seitaridis, being a starter at Panathinaikos&#x27; opening league fixture against Skoda Xanthi on 27 August 2010 and giving a good performance. However, another muscle injury meant that Seitaridis would return at a league game against Panserraikos two months later, on 4 December. Due to the player&#x27;s poor condition he was placed on the transfer list in January 2011, but despite various offers from foreign teams during the summer transfer period, he stayed at Panathinaikos.

The 2011–12 season was even more disappointing for him, as he was only used for 45 minutes in an away game against Atromitos, where he was substituted at half-time due to poor performance. He played for a second time in an away game against Asteras Tripoli, staying on the pitch a full 90 minutes.

The 2012–13 season started well for Seitaridis, playing as a starter in the first three league matches at the beginning of the season. He also contributed with one assist in Panathinaikos&#x27; 2012–13 UEFA Europa League group stage match against Tottenham Hotspur, which ended 1–1.

At the summer of 2013 he didn&#x27;t renew his contract and left the club.

==International career==

===Youth career===
Seitaridis is a former Greece under-21 international, making his debut on 6 October 2000, in a 2002 UEFA Under-21 Championship qualifier against Finland under-21. He participated at the finals of the 2002 UEFA Under-21 Championship in Switzerland, where his team was eliminated from the group stage, having collected one point in three games.

===First steps &amp; UEFA Euro 2004===
Seitaridis made his international debut with the senior team on 13 February 2002, in an international friendly match against Sweden. He helped Greece qualify to the UEFA Euro 2004 in Portugal for the second time in history, and was also one of the key players during Greece&#x27;s successful campaign, a win that shocked the footballing world as Greece were considered outsiders before the tournament started. Seitaridis won a penalty at the first match against Portugal as he was knocked down by Cristiano Ronaldo. In the final, he also won the important corner by playing the ball in the center which was blocked from Cristiano Ronaldo. Overall his contributions for the victorious team were recognised by naming him as part of the 23-man UEFA 2004 All-Star squad, together with fellow Greek players Antonis Nikopolidis, Traianos Dellas, Theodoros Zagorakis and Angelos Charisteas.

===FIFA Confederations Cup 2005===
As a result of the win at Euro 2004, Greece qualified to the 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup in Germany as European champions. Giourkas Seitaridis was a member of the 23-man squad.

===UEFA Euro 2008 &amp; 2010 FIFA World Cup===
He scored his debut international goal on 2 June 2007 against Hungary in a Euro 2008 qualifying match, helping the Greece national team to qualify to the UEFA Euro 2008 championship. He played twice in the disappointing Euro 2008 campaign for Greece, having been injured during the second game against Russia.

Despite concerns about his fitness, Greece national manager Otto Rehhagel called Seitaridis in his 23-man squad for the 2010 FIFA World Cup. He only played for 90 minutes in the first game of the group stage against South Korea, losing 2–0. After this game, Seitaridis played two consecutive European and a World Cup with the Greece national team.

<text>Wynyard () &quot;wi-nyuhd&quot;) is a rural town located on the North West coast of Tasmania, Australia. Wynyard is situated west of Burnie. As of the 2021 census, Wynyard has an estimated population of 6,296. The town is a regional hub servicing the surrounding rural areas. The main council offices for the Waratah-Wynyard local government area are located in Wynyard.

The Burnie Wynyard Airport provides commercial flights to Melbourne and other districts. 

==History==
Three ex-convict Alexander brothers established a settlement, Alexandria, on the west, or Table Cape, side of the Inglis River in the 1850s. They bought large areas of farmland on Table Cape and built several small ships for produce and timber trading. Shortly afterwards, a town was laid on the east side of the river. Originally called Table Cape, it lagged well behind Alexandria which had a church and several shops including a blacksmith and general store. After the Inglis River was bridged in 1861, Alexandria began to fade and Wynyard, with better wharfing, became the district&#x27;s centre of commerce.

Wynyard was probably renamed after Major-General Edward Buckley Wynyard in the early 1850s. Table Cape Post Office opened around 1856 and was renamed &quot;Wynyard&quot; in 1882.

Wynyard handled more shipping than Burnie in the late nineteenth century and its population reached 500 by 1900. However, in the 20th century Burnie flourished and become the dominant regional and industrial hub for the region.

Previously, Wynyard Primary School (located at Gibbons Street) and Inglis Primary School (located at Bowick Street) existed separately. Both were renamed to Table Cape Primary School in 1998. The two school campuses were then merged in 2009, with the closing of the Bowick Street campus.

==Geographical features==

===Freestone Cove===
Freestone Cove is a small sheltered bay on the northern fringes of Wynyard, towards Table Cape.

====Fossil Bluff====

Fossil bluff is a small protrusion of sandstone cliffs rising about from the coastline at Freestone Cove. In the 19th century, it was the discovery site of Australia&#x27;s oldest fossil marsupial, &quot;Wynyardia bassiana&quot;, an extinct possum-like animal from the early Miocene (about 25 million years ago). Also recovered was an extinct genus of whale, Prosqualodon.

====Aboriginal fish traps====

It is believed the Aboriginal Tommeginer clan built tidal fish traps with rocks at Freestone Cove, the rocks are still evident today and are protected under the &quot;Aboriginal Relics Act&quot;. The Tommeginer tribe lived in the region along the coastline around Wynyard and Table Cape until soon after the arrival of Europeans in the 19th century.

A considerable number of tidal fish traps have been found in the north and north-west of the state. This phenomenon is attributed to the mean tidal range of two metres along this stretch of coastline, which is ideal for this type of construction. Whilst some of these traps were certainly built by Europeans, there is good reason to believe others were of Aboriginal construction, such as at Freestone Cove. Three other traps located at nearby Rocky Cape, Sisters Beach and Boat Harbour do not have established European origins, furthermore, all are located within the territory which was occupied by the Tommeginer tribe.

Tidal fish traps must be located close to settlements or camps so that they can be monitored. Because as the tide ebbs, any fish caught in the shallows fall easy prey to scavenging seabirds. The Freestone Cove traps are located a considerable distance from the nearest early European settlement of Alexandria, but were close to known Aboriginal campsites and several middens have been located along the shoreline nearby.

===Inglis River===
Wynyard is located around the mouth of the Inglis River, which extends approximately 61 kilometres to the Campbell Ranges near Takone.

===Table Cape===
Table Cape is a volcanic plug located about north of Wynyard, the northern and eastern faces of the geological feature rise steeply from Bass Strait to a height of approximately 170 metres (560 ft) above sea level. The area is renowned for the annual flowering of tulips during spring and accompanying tulip festival. Situated on the edge of Table Cape is the heritage-listed Table Cape Lighthouse which remains in operation today. The lighthouse stands about tall and has a maximum nautical range of .

== Climate ==
Wynyard has a oceanic climate (Köppen: Cfb), with very mild, relatively dry summers and cool, rainy winters. Average maxima vary from in January and February to in July while average minima fluctuate between in February and in July.
Mean average annual precipitation is moderate: , but is frequent: spread between 179.5 precipitation days. The town is not very sunny, with 147.6 cloudy days and only 45.9 clear days per annum. Extreme temperatures have ranged from on 31 January 2009 to on 6 July 2024. Sunshine data was sourced from Elliott, a rural locality southeast of Wynyard.
==Notable residents==

<text>Highlands or uplands are areas of high elevation such as a mountainous region, elevated mountainous plateau or high hills. Generally, &quot;upland&quot; refers to a range of hills, typically from up to , while &quot;highland&quot; is usually reserved for ranges of low mountains. However, the two terms are interchangeable and also include regions that are transitional between hilly and mountainous terrain.

==Highlands internationally==
Probably the best-known area officially or unofficially referred to as &quot;highlands&quot; in the Anglosphere is the Scottish Highlands in northern Scotland, the mountainous region north and west of the Highland Boundary Fault. The Highland council area is a local government area in the Scottish Highlands and Britain&#x27;s largest local government area. Other highland or upland areas reaching 400 m or higher in the United Kingdom include the Southern Uplands in Scotland, the Pennines, North York Moors, Dartmoor and Exmoor in England, and the Cambrian Mountains in Wales.

Many countries and regions also have areas referred to as &quot;highlands&quot;. These include parts of Afghanistan, Tibet, Ethiopia, Canada, Kenya, Eritrea, Yemen, Ghana, Nigeria, Papua New Guinea, Syria, Turkey and Cantabria.

Similar terms used in other countries include &quot;high country&quot;, used in New Zealand, New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania and Southern Queensland in Australia, and parts of the United States (notably Western North Carolina), highveld, used in South Africa and &quot;Roof of the World&quot;, used for Tibet.

The central Afghan highlands are in the center of Afghanistan, mostly located between 2,000 and 3,000 m above sea level. They have a very cold winter, and a short and cool summer. These highlands have mountain pastures during summer (&quot;sardsīr&quot;), watered by many small streams and rivers. There are also pastures available during winter in the neighboring warm lowlands (&quot;garmsīr&quot;), which makes the region ideal for seasonal transhumance.

The highlands in Australia are often above the elevation of 500 m. These areas often receive snowfall in winter. Most of the highlands lead up to large alpine or sub-alpine mountainous regions such as the Australian Alps, Snowy Mountains, Great Dividing Range, Northern Tablelands and Blue Mountains. The most mountainous region of Tasmania is the Central Highlands area, which covers most of the central-western parts of the state. Many of these areas are highly elevated alpine regions.

The Ozarks cover nearly , making it the most extensive highland region between the Appalachians and Rockies. This region contains some of the oldest rocks in North America.

The spine of the mountains stretches across the island of New Guinea, forming the densely populated highlands of Papua New Guinea, and the Highland Papua, Indonesia.

The Central Highlands of Sri Lanka are rain forests, where the elevation reaches 2,500 m (8,200 ft) above sea level. The Sri Lanka montane rain forests represent the montane and submontane moist forests above 1,000 m (3,300 ft) in the central highlands and in the Knuckles mountain range. Half of Sri Lanka&#x27;s endemic flowering plants and 51 percent of the endemic vertebrates are restricted to this ecoregion. 

The highlands of Iceland cover about 40% of the country and are mostly inhospitable to humans. They are generally considered to be any land above 500 m.

The mountainous natural region of the Thai highlands is found in Northern Thailand.

The Cameron Highlands is a highland area and hill station in Pahang, Malaysia.

Shillong in India in the state of Meghalaya is a hill station that is surrounded by highlands. Officers of the British Raj referred to Shillong as &quot;The Scotland of the East&quot;.

== Other planets ==
Highland continents—or terrae—are areas of topographically unstable terrain, with high peaks and valleys. They resemble highlands on Earth, but the term is applied to much larger areas on other planets. They can be found on Mercury, Venus, Mars, and the Moon.

<doc id="793569" wikidata="Q13422248" url="?curid=793569" title="Donald">
<text>Donald is a masculine given name derived from the Gaelic name &quot;Dòmhnall&quot;. This comes from the Proto-Celtic *&quot;Dumno-ualos&quot; (&quot;world-ruler&quot; or &quot;world-wielder&quot;). The final -&quot;d&quot; in &quot;Donald&quot; is partly derived from a misinterpretation of the Gaelic pronunciation by English speakers, and partly associated with the spelling of similar-sounding Germanic names, such as Ronald. A short form of Donald is Don, and pet forms of Donald include Donnie and Donny. The feminine given name Donella is derived from Donald.

&quot;Donald&quot; has cognates in other Celtic languages: Modern Irish &quot;Dónal&quot; (anglicised as &quot;Donal&quot; and &quot;Donall&quot;); Scottish Gaelic &quot;Dòmhnall&quot;, &quot;Domhnull&quot; and &quot;Dòmhnull&quot;; Welsh &quot;Dyfnwal&quot; and Cumbric &quot;Dumnagual&quot;. Although the feminine given name &quot;Donna&quot; is sometimes used as a feminine form of &quot;Donald&quot;, the names are not etymologically related.

<text>Norvega Esperantista Ligo (&quot;Norsk Esperanto-Forbund,&quot; Norwegian Esperanto League) was founded in 1911. As the Norwegian arm of the Esperanto movement, its aim is to spread knowledge and use of the international language Esperanto. The league has a modest size of a couple of hundred members, and work done within NEL is mostly voluntary. The youth wing of NEL is Norvega Junularo Esperantista.

Affiliated with the largest international Esperanto organization, the Universala Esperanto-Asocio (UEA), the association has a permanent office in Oslo (also used by the Esperanto club of Oslo) and local subgroups scattered around the country. The Grupo Esperantista de Trondheim (Norwegian: Trondheim Esperantoklubb), for example, celebrated its centennial on June 16, 2007.

Since 1985 the NEL has published a magazine, &quot;Norvega Esperantisto&quot; (six issues per year).

==Norwegian Esperanto history==
===Early history to 1911===
The Norwegian Esperanto League was founded January 27, 1911 after earlier groundwork had been laid some years earlier by Haldor Midthus (1841-1906), Norway&#x27;s first Esperantist. In 1886 Midthus, a teacher from Os Municipality in Hordaland, had learned Volapük, another constructed language. Having been active in the Volapük movement for ten years, he came to prefer Esperanto and became an enthusiastic proponent for Esperanto as the ideal international language. Midthus attended the first World Esperanto Congress in 1905 a few months before his death.

In 1906 the first Esperanto club in Kristiania (now Oslo) was established. The first members were students and temperance activists. The International Order of Good Templars, an organization devoted to ending the consumption of alcohol, had established lodges in Scandinavia beginning in 1877. The Swedish parliamentarian Edvard Wavrinski, the international president of the IOGT, wrote a series of articles on Esperanto for the IOGT publication &quot;Goodtemplarbladet&quot;, and several leading members of the alcohol-abstention movement showed interest.

In 1907 the German chemist Wilhelm Ostwald (who was later to win the Nobel Prize) visited the Royal Frederick University (now the University of Oslo). He lectured on Esperanto, which brought many new members to Kristiania&#x27;s Esperanto club.

In the following years several new clubs were founded in Trondheim (1907), Narvik (1907), Bergen (1909) and Stavanger (1910). The club began in 1909 the publication of the journal &quot;Esperanto-bladet&quot;, and some members began to think of a national organization of Esperantists.

===Between the wars===
After the founding of the NEL, Norwegian Esperantists began a comprehensive program of language promotion and instruction. One of the early results (1912) was that Esperanto become an elective course at a business school &quot;(handelsskole)&quot; in Bergen. Esperanto activities broke off during World War I but were revived again in the mid-1920s. By the 1930s the Norwegian Esperanto League had grown to a membership of several thousand, with activities throughout Norway and with many participants in Esperanto courses.

===World War II===
In 1936 Esperanto had been prohibited in Nazi Germany. After the Nazi occupation of Norway beginning on April 9, 1940, the Norwegian parliament met in emergency session at Elverum and unanimously voted to delegate all legislative authority to King Haakon VII and the elected cabinet. With this legitimized government in exile in England, the occupying Nazis vested de facto power in Reichskommissar Josef Terboven and in the puppet government of Vidkun Quisling.

Persecuted Esperantists was forced underground but nevertheless continued with private meetings and study circles. In Vestlandet, in fact, the Norwegian Esperanto League successfully arranged a clandestine meeting in 1942 for 70 NEL delegates.

Certain German soldiers who knew Esperanto sometimes tried to make contact with the underground group but were politely turned away because of the war situation and the danger that Esperantists faced if exposed. In 1942, however, a deserting German Kriegsmarine sailor who spoke Esperanto knocked on the door of the Bergen Esperanto club seeking assistance in fleeing to Sweden. The Bergen club helped him, and he later became a member of the Swedish Esperanto Federation.

===Postwar developments in Norway===
After the war Esperanto flowered again in Norway, and the NEL emerged a relatively strong organization. Esperanto was accepted as a subject for college study. In 1952 the 37th World Esperanto Congress, held in Oslo&#x27;s newly completed city hall, attracted 1,600 delegates. King Haakon VII met the non-Norwegian delegates as they arrived at the Østbane railway station. The king jokingly remarked that the Esperantists were easy to get along with, but it was impossible to understand what they were saying. The 76th Congress, held in Bergen in 1991, drew 2,400 delegates.

In November 2006, Norwegian Esperantists arranged a conference call by telephone among delegates in Oslo, Bergen, Stavanger, Trondheim and Korgen (Hemnes Municipality); the teleconference attendees heard a talk on Esperanto history in Norway delivered by Elna Matland.

Today the NEL has active branches in Bergen, Bryne, Hamar, Kristiansand, Oslo, Sarpsborg, Stavanger, Tromsø and Trondheim. The current president of the NEL is Jardar Eggesbø Abrahamsen. At the same time as the organization continues to publish &quot;Norvega Esperantisto,&quot; the NEL, along with other Esperantist groups, is making more and more information available on the Internet.

==Esperanto dictionaries==
In the 1930s Ragnvald Rian had edited the first Norwegian-Esperanto dictionary. With the collaboration of Erling Anker Haugen, a second edition was published in 1963. As many Esperantists in Norway now complain that this book is old, lacks many ordinary words and has an old-fashioned character that may tend to put Esperanto in a bad light, the Norwegian Esperanto League has made its top priority the publication of a new dictionary. They have delegated the task to an editorial committee from the Grupo Esperantista de Trondheim (GET) consisting of Herman Ranes, Jardar Eggesbø Abrahamsen and Kjell Heggvold Ullestad.

===Erling Anker Haugen&#x27;s notes===
When the 1963 book was published, two copies were bound with extra blank pages sewn between the leaves of the book. The idea had been to complete the books with new words and expressions that could not be found in the printed pages. The notations were to eventually find a new home in a future, revised edition.

The younger of the 1963 edition authors, Erling Haugen, began even before the dictionary was published to collect words and expressions from Esperanto journals and other literature. Those not already in the dictionary were carefully recorded on the blank pages in the specially bound copies. Haugen continued with this labour until his death.

Haugen planned these notations as the basis of an eventual revision of the Esperanto dictionary. Because he planned to make the revision himself, he only noted words and idioms he observed in actual use. He did not evaluate them for inclusion in the printed dictionary, a task he postponed till it was time for a new edition. After some time, however, he realized he would not live to see a new edition.

Towards the end of his life he was encouraged to see young people joining the greybeards of the GET, the Trondheim Esperanto club. He proclaimed jovially, &quot;You have much to learn when it comes to Esperanto.&quot; He donated all his notes to GET, with a plea to handle the materials carefully, as he had not been able to evaluate the quality of the collection he had amassed, a task he left for new generations. On his death in 1989, the tireless lexicographer Erling Haugen left the GET his materials containing over 20,000 words not found in the earlier 1963 dictionary.

===Computerized database===
Already in the time of Erling Anker Haugen, Ulf Lunde had contemplated organizing the word corpus into a database. The Trondheim Esperanto club (GET) had sought funds from the Rolf Uhlen legacy and received a grant of 35,000 kroner to help purchase a computer and to make a usable computer program for entering the data, beginning with the previously typeset book. Haugen&#x27;s handwritten notations would be clarified and transcribed later, which later proved easier said than done.

The work was slow, and the editorial committee saw no end to their task. One of the Esperanto students in Trondheim, Agnar Tore Vaaje, took an interest in the old notes and was also interested in finding a practical technical solution. Together with Nils Utne and Ulf Lunde, he set to work. Vaaje learned Esperanto as he deciphered Haugen&#x27;s handwriting, entered records and kept the computer running. Despite eventually becoming fluent in Esperanto, he did not have sufficient knowledge of Esperanto to revise the materials further. Here the elderly, experienced Nils Utne came into the picture. He systematized the materials, and devised workable technical solutions for ordering the great data corpus to generate a dictionary. It was a major endeavour he devoted years of life to, but did not accomplish, before he died in 1999.

After the death of Utne, the GET tried in several ways to revive the dictionary project. Because carrying out the work required a person possessing both technical knowledge of work methods and subject knowledge in lexicography, it was difficult to proceed efficiently. Those with such expertise had other obligations that demanded most of their time and work capacity. Still, the club had chosen a dictionary committee that was committed to push the project forward. In order that the work would not stagnate, they began proofreading at club meetings and on their days off from work. This attracted many participants for several years, but the corpus was huge, and the feeling of inadequacy had slowed the work when Kjell Heggvold Ullestad came into the picture.

<text>Reculver is a village and coastal resort about east of Herne Bay on the north coast of Kent in south-east England.
It is in the ward of the same name, in the City of Canterbury district of Kent. 

Reculver once occupied a strategic location at the north-western end of the Wantsum Channel, a sea lane that separated the Isle of Thanet and the Kent mainland until the late Middle Ages. This led the Romans to build a small fort there at the time of their conquest of Britain in 43 AD, and, starting late in the 2nd century, they built a larger fort, or &quot;castrum&quot;, called &quot;Regulbium&quot;, which later became one of the chain of Saxon Shore forts. Following the withdrawal of the Western Roman Empire in ca. early C4th, the Brythons again took control of the lands until Anglo-Saxon invasions shortly afterward.

By the 7th century Reculver had become a landed estate of the Anglo-Saxon kings of Kent. The site of the Roman fort was given over for the establishment of a monastery dedicated to the Virgin Mary in 669 AD, and King Eadberht II of Kent was buried there in the 760s. During the Middle Ages Reculver was a thriving township with a weekly market and a yearly fair, and was part of the Cinque Port of Sandwich. The settlement declined, however, as the Wantsum Channel silted up, and coastal erosion claimed many buildings constructed on the soft sandy cliffs. The village was largely abandoned in the late 18th century, and most of St Mary&#x27;s Church was demolished in the early 19th century. Protecting the ruins and the rest of Reculver from erosion is an ongoing challenge.

The 20th century saw a revival as local tourism developed and there are now two caravan parks. The 2021 census recorded about 4,400 people in the Reculver area. The Reculver coastline is within a Site of Special Scientific Interest, a Special Protection Area and a Ramsar site, including most of Reculver Country Park, which itself includes much of Bishopstone Cliffs local nature reserve. While nationally scarce plants and insects are found there, the location is also important for migrating birds and is of significant geological interest.

==History==
===Toponymy===
The earliest recorded form of the name, &quot;Regulbium&quot;, is in Latin and dates from the early 5th century or before, but it had its origin in a Common Brittonic word meaning &quot;at the promontory&quot; or &quot;great headland&quot;. In Old English this became corrupted to &quot;Raculf&quot;, sometimes given as &quot;Raculfceastre&quot;, giving rise to the modern &quot;Reculver&quot;. The form &quot;Raculfceastre&quot; includes the Old English place-name element &quot;ceaster&quot;, which frequently relates to &quot;a [Roman] city or walled town&quot;.

===Prehistoric and Roman===
Stone Age flint tools have been washed out from the cliffs to the west of Reculver, and a Mesolithic tranchet axe was found near the centre of the Roman fort in 1960. This was probably an accidental loss, rather than suggesting a human settlement, evidence for which begins with late Bronze Age and Iron Age ditches. These indicate an extensive settlement, where a Bronze Age palstave and Iron Age gold coins have been found. This was followed by a &quot;fortlet&quot; built by the Romans during their conquest of Britain, which began in 43 AD, and the existence of a Roman road leading to Canterbury, about to the south-west, indicates a Roman presence at Reculver from then onwards. A full-size fort, or &quot;castrum&quot;, was started late in the 2nd century. This date is derived in part from a reconstruction of a uniquely detailed plaque, fragments of which were found by archaeologists in the 1960s. The plaque effectively records the establishment of the fort, since it commemorates the construction of two of its principal features, the &quot;basilica&quot; and the &quot;sacellum&quot;, or shrine, both being parts of the headquarters building, or &quot;principia&quot;:

These structures were found by archaeologists, together with probable officers&#x27; quarters, barracks and a bath house. A Roman oven found south-east of the fort was probably used for drying food such as corn and fish; its main chamber measured about 16 feet (4.9 m) by 15 feet (4.8 m) overall.
The fort was located on a low hill, beyond which a long promontory then projected north-eastwards into the sea and formed the north-eastern extremity of mainland Kent: thus it offered observation on all sides, including both the Thames Estuary and the sea lane later known as the Wantsum Channel, which lay between it and the Isle of Thanet. It was probably built by soldiers of the &quot;Cohors I Baetasiorum&quot;, originally from Lower Germany, who had previously served at the Roman fort of &quot;Alauna&quot; at Maryport in Cumbria at least until the early 180s, since tiles recovered from the fort are stamped &quot;CIB&quot;. The &quot;Notitia Dignitatum&quot;, a Roman administrative document from the early 5th century, also records the presence of the &quot;Cohors I Baetasiorum&quot; at Reculver, then known as &quot;Regulbium&quot;. There must also have been a harbour nearby in Roman times, and, though this has not yet been found, it was probably near to the fort&#x27;s southern or eastern side.

The walls of the fort originally stood about high and were thick at their base, reducing to at the top; they were reinforced internally by an earthen bank. The entrance to the fort&#x27;s headquarters building faced north, indicating that the main gate was on the north side, facing the eponymous promontory and the sea. The north wall has been lost to the sea, along with the adjoining part of the east wall and most of the west wall; the east wall is most complete and includes the remains of the eastern gateway and guard post. Parts of the surviving walls are all that remains of the fort above ground, and all have suffered from stone-robbing, especially near the south-western corner. The walls were originally faced with ragstone, but very little of this remains: otherwise only the cores of the walls are visible, consisting mostly of flint and concrete and standing only high at their highest.
Roman forts were normally accompanied by a civilian settlement, or &quot;vicus&quot;: at Reculver this lay outside the north and west sides of the fort, much of it in areas now lost to the sea, and was extensive, perhaps covering &quot;some ten hectares [25 acres] in all.&quot; In 1936 R.F. Jessup noted that &quot;a Roman building with a hypocaust and tesselated [floor once] stood considerably to the northward of the fort&quot;: this structure had been observed by the 18th-century antiquarian John Battely, and was probably &quot;an external bath relating to [an early phase of] the fort.&quot; In the same area Battely described &quot;several cisterns&quot; between 10 and 12 feet (3–3.7 m) square, lined with oak planks and sealed at the bottom with puddled clay. He believed that these were for storing rainwater, and noted that a Roman strigil, which would have been used in a bath house, had been found in a similar cistern at Reculver; he also observed that &quot;such a multitude [of cisterns] has been discovered, almost in our memory, as proves that the ancient inhabitants of the place were very numerous.&quot; In the 20th century twelve wells of the Roman period were identified to the west of the fort, ten of which were square; all were cut into the hard layer of sandstone below the soft sandstone of the Thanet Beds, thus tapping into the water table. These and other 20th-century finds from the Roman period extend to west of the fort, and date to a period between 170 and 360, roughly coinciding with the period of occupation at the fort itself.

At least 10 infant burials have been found within the fort, all of babies, of which six were associated with Roman buildings: five sets of infant remains were found within the foundations and walls of buildings, as were coins dating from 270 to 300 AD. It was suspected that more such burials might be found in the walls of a building in the south-western area of the fort if it were excavated further. A baby&#x27;s feeding bottle was also found in an excavated floor within of one of the infant skeletons, though it may have been unconnected with the burials. The babies were probably buried in the buildings as ritual sacrifices, but it is unknown whether they were selected for burial because they were already dead, perhaps stillborn, or if they were buried alive or killed for the purpose. A local tale subsequently developed that the grounds of the fort were haunted by the sound of a crying baby.

Towards the end of the 3rd century a Roman naval commander named Carausius, who later declared himself emperor in Britain, was given the task of clearing pirates from the sea between Britain and the European mainland. In so doing he established a new chain of command, the British part of which was later to pass under the control of a Count of the Saxon Shore. The &quot;Notitia Dignitatum&quot; shows that the fort at Reculver became part of this arrangement, and its location meant that it lay at the &quot;main point of contact in the system [of Saxon Shore forts]&quot;. Archaeological evidence indicates that it was abandoned in the 370s.

===Medieval===

By the 7th century Reculver was part of a landed estate of the Anglo-Saxon kings of Kent, possibly with a royal toll-station or a &quot;significant coastal trading settlement,&quot; given the types and large quantity of coins found there. Other early Anglo-Saxon finds include a fragment of a gilt bronze brooch, or &quot;fibula&quot;, which was originally circular and set with coloured stones or glass, a claw beaker and pottery. Antiquarians such as the 18th-century clergyman John Duncombe believed that King Æthelberht of Kent moved his royal court there from Canterbury in about 597, and built a palace on the site of the Roman ruins. However, archaeological excavation has shown no evidence of this; Æthelberht&#x27;s household would have been peripatetic, and the story has been described as probably a &quot;pious legend&quot;. A church was built on the site of the Roman fort in about 669, when King Ecgberht of Kent granted land for the foundation of a monastery, which was dedicated to St Mary.

The monastery developed as the centre of a &quot;large estate, a manor and a parish&quot;, and, by the early 9th century, it had become &quot;extremely wealthy&quot;, but it then fell under the control of the archbishops of Canterbury. In 811 Archbishop Wulfred is recorded as having deprived the monastery of some of its land, and soon after it featured in a &quot;monumental showdown&quot; between Wulfred and King Coenwulf of Mercia over the control of monasteries. In 838 control of all monasteries under Canterbury&#x27;s authority was passed to the kings of Wessex, by the agreement of Archbishop Ceolnoth in exchange for protection from Viking attacks. By the 10th century the monastery at Reculver and its estate were both royal property: they were given back to the archbishops of Canterbury in 949 by King Eadred of England, at which time the estate included Hoath and Herne, and land at Chilmington, about to the south-west, and in the west of the Isle of Thanet.

By 1066 the monastery had become a parish church. However, in 1086 Reculver was named in the Domesday Book of 1086 as a hundred, and the manor was valued at £42.7s. (£42.35). Included in the Domesday account for the manor, as well as the church, farmland, a mill, salt pans and a fishery, are 90 villeins and 25 bordars: these numbers can be multiplied four or five times to account for dependents, as they only represent &quot;adult male heads of households&quot;. At that time, although Domesday Book records that Reculver belonged to the archbishop of Canterbury in both 1066 and 1086, in reality it must again have been lost to him, since William the Conqueror is recorded as having returned it, among other churches and properties, to the archbishop at his death. In the 13th century Reculver was a parish of &quot;exceptional wealth&quot;, and the considerable enlargement of the church building during the Middle Ages indicates that the settlement had become a &quot;thriving township&quot;, with &quot;dozens of houses&quot;. In 1310 Archbishop Robert Winchelsey of Canterbury noted that the population of the whole parish in the time of his predecessor John Peckham ( 1230–1292) had numbered more than 3,000. For this reason, and because the parish was also large geographically, he converted chapelries at Herne and, on the Isle of Thanet, St Nicholas-at-Wade and Shuart into parishes, though the church at Hoath remained a perpetual curacy belonging to Reculver parish until 1960. Records for the poll tax of 1377 show that there were then 364 individuals of 14 years and above, not including &quot;honest beggars&quot;, in the reduced parish of Reculver, who paid a total of £6.1s.4d. (£6.07) towards the tax.

===Decline and loss to the sea===

The thriving medieval township depended partly on its position on a maritime trade route through the Wantsum Channel, already present in Anglo-Saxon times and exemplified by Reculver&#x27;s membership of the Cinque Port of Sandwich later in the Middle Ages. The importance of the Wantsum Channel was such that, when the River Thames froze in 1269, trade between Sandwich and London had to be carried out overland. Historical records for the channel are sparse after 1269, perhaps &quot;because the route was so well known as to be taken for granted [in the Middle Ages], the whole waterway from London to Sandwich being occasionally spoken of as the &#x27;Thames&#x27;&quot;. But silting and inning had closed the channel to trading vessels sailing along it by about 1460 or soon after, and the first bridge was built over it at Sarre in 1485, since ferries could no longer operate reliably across it.

Reculver was also diminished by coastal erosion. By 1540, when John Leland recorded a visit there, the coastline to the north had receded to within little more than a quarter of a mile (400 m) of the &quot;Towne [which] at this tyme [was] but Village lyke&quot;. Soon afterwards, in 1576, William Lambarde described Reculver as &quot;poore and simple&quot;. In 1588 there were 165 communicants – people taking part in services of holy communion at the church – and in 1640 there were 169, but a map of about 1630 shows that the church then stood only about from the shore. In January 1658 the local justices of the peace were petitioned concerning &quot;encroachments of the sea ... [which had] since Michaelmas last [29 September 1657] encroached on the land near six rods ], and will doubtless do more harm&quot;. The village&#x27;s failure to support two &quot;beer shops&quot; in the 1660s points clearly to a declining population, and the village was mostly abandoned around the end of the 18th century, its residents moving to Hillborough, about south-west of Reculver but within the same parish.
Concern about erosion of the cliff on which the church stood, and the possible inundation of the village, had led the commissioners of sewers to install costly sea defences consisting of planking and piling before 1783, when it was reported that the commissioners had adopted a scheme proposed by Sir Thomas Page to protect the church: the sea defences had proven counter-productive, since sea water collected behind them and continued to undermine the cliff. Before this, according to John Duncombe, &quot;the commissioners of sewers, and the occupiers who pay scots, [had] no view nor interest but to secure the level [ground], which must be overflowed when the hill is washed away.&quot; By 1787 Reculver had &quot;dwindled into an insignificant village, thinly decked with the cottages of fishermen and smugglers.&quot;


In September 1804 a high tide and strong winds led to the destruction of five houses, one of which was &quot;an ancient building, immediately opposite the public house, and had the appearance of having been part of some monastic erection&quot;. The following year, according to a set of notes written by the parish clerk John Brett, &quot;Reculver Church and willage stood in safety&quot;, but in 1806 the sea began to encroach on the village, and in 1807 the local farmers dismantled the sea defences, after which &quot;the village became a total [wreck] to the mercy of the sea.&quot;

A further scheme to protect the cliff and church was proposed by John Rennie, but a decision was taken on 12 January 1808 to demolish the church. By March 1809, erosion of the cliff had brought it to within of the church, and demolition was begun in September that year. Trinity House intervened to ensure that the towers were preserved as a navigational aid, and in 1810 it bought what was left of the structure for £100 and built the first groynes, designed to protect the cliff on which the ruined church stands. The vicarage was abandoned at the same time as the church, or a little later, and a replacement parish church was built at Hillborough, opening in 1813.
After the sea undermined the foundations of the Hoy and Anchor Inn at Reculver in January 1808, the building was taken down and the redundant vicarage was used as a temporary replacement under the same name. Although it was reported in 1800 that there were then only five or six houses left in the village, a new Hoy and Anchor Inn was built by 1809, and this was renamed as the King Ethelbert Inn by 1838. Further construction work is indicated by a stone over the doorway to the inn bearing a date of 1843, and it was later extended into the form in which it stands today, &quot;probably ... in 1883&quot;.

Today the site of the church, including the upper part of the sea defences there, is managed by English Heritage, and the village has all but disappeared. The present appearance of the cliff below the church, a grassy slope above a large stone apron, was the work of central government and was in place by April 1867. In 2000 the surviving fragments of an early medieval cross that once stood inside the old church were used to design a Millennium Cross to commemorate two thousand years of Christianity. This stands at the entrance to the car park and was commissioned by Canterbury City Council.

===Bouncing bombs===
During the Second World War, the coastline east of the village was used to test prototypes of Barnes Wallis&#x27;s bouncing bomb. This area was chosen for its seclusion, while the clear landmark of the church towers and the ease of recovering prototypes from the shallow water were probably also factors. Different, versions of the bomb were tested at Reculver, leading to the development of the operational version known as &quot;Upkeep&quot;. This bomb was used by the RAF&#x27;s 617 Squadron in Operation Chastise, otherwise known as the Dambuster raids, in which dams in the Ruhr district of Germany were attacked on the night of 16–17 May 1943 by formations of Lancaster bombers. On 17 May 2003 a Lancaster bomber overflew the Reculver testing site to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the exploit.

Two prototype bouncing bombs, about long and wide, lay in marshland behind the sea wall until about 1977, when they were removed by the Army. Other prototypes were recovered from the shoreline in 1997, one of which is in Herne Bay Museum and Gallery, a little over west of Reculver. Others are on display in Dover Castle and in the Spitfire &amp; Hurricane Memorial Museum at the former RAF Manston, on the Isle of Thanet. Part of an inert Upkeep bomb, consisting mostly of a circular end with some of its filling still adhering, was uncovered during beach maintenance work undertaken at Reculver by the Environment Agency on 29 March 2017.

==Governance==

In the 10th-century charter by which King Eadred gave Reculver to the archbishops of Canterbury, the boundary of the mainland part of the estate was about the same as those for the adjoining parishes of Reculver, Hoath and Herne in the 20th century, and the estate included part of the Isle of Thanet. In 1086, Domesday Book named Reculver as a hundred, meaning that it was probably the meeting-place for the local hundred court. The hundred included Hoath and Herne, and it may also have included the neighbouring area of Thanet. In 1274–75 the local hundred was much larger: it was then named after Bleangate, in a detached part of Chislet parish, and was divided into northern and southern halves; it also included part of Thanet. By 1540 Bleangate hundred no longer included land on Thanet, its members being listed then as Sturry, Chislet, Reculver and Herne for the archaic taxes known as &quot;fifteenths and tenths&quot;, and in 1659 they were listed as Chislet, Herne, Hoath, Reculver, Stourmouth, Sturry and Westbere. In 1808 the members of the northern half-hundred, or &quot;Bleangate Upper&quot;, were listed as Herne, Reculver, Stourmouth and Hoath. The constable for the northern half-hundred was chosen at the court leet of the manor of Reculver, which by 1800 was usually held at Herne.

The parish was represented by two tithings – known in Kent as &quot;borghs&quot; – in the Hundred Rolls of 1274–75 and, 400 years later, for the purposes of the Hearth Tax, levied between 1662 and 1689. In 1274–75 they appear as Reculver borgh and Brookgate borgh; in 1663 they appear as Reculver Street borgh and Brookgate borgh, which were recorded under a parish heading for Reculver, together with Hoath borgh; and in 1673 Reculver borgh and Brookgate borgh were recorded under a heading for Herne parish, while Hoath was recorded under its own parish heading. However, borghs in Kent, and tithings generally, were related to the manorial and administration of a county, rather than to the ecclesiastical parishes in which they lay.

The parishes of Herne and, on the Isle of Thanet, St Nicholas-at-Wade were created from parts of Reculver parish in 1310, although they continued to have a subordinate relationship with their original parish into the 19th century, while Hoath remained a perpetual curacy into the 20th. Thereafter Reculver&#x27;s parish boundary, enclosing an area of about , remained the same for both ecclesiastical and civil purposes until 1934, and included the settlements of Hillborough, Bishopstone and Brook, now Brook Farm. The parish extended west almost to Beltinge, in Herne parish, and to Broomfield in the south-west, where the boundary with Herne parish ran along the centre of the main thoroughfare, now Margate Road; it was bounded in open country on the south-east and east by the parish of Chislet. On 1 April 1934 the civil parish was abolished and merged with of Herne Bay. In 1931 the civil parish had a population of 829.

Reculver is in an electoral ward of the same name that includes Beltinge, Bishopstone, Brook Farm, Boyden Gate, Chislet, Hillborough, Hoath and Maypole. The ward is in the local government district of Canterbury and has one seat on Canterbury City Council; in the local elections of 2019, the seat was won by Rachel Lois Carnac, Conservative. At the national level Reculver is in the English parliamentary constituency of Herne Bay and Sandwich. Sir Roger Gale (Conservative) has been MP for the area since 1983.

==Geography==

The ruins of the Roman fort and medieval church at Reculver stand on the remnant of a promontory, a low hill with a maximum height of , which is the &quot;last seaward extension of the Blean Hills.&quot; Sediments laid down around 55 million years ago are particularly well displayed in the cliffs to the west. Nearby Herne Bay is the type section for the upper part of the Thanet Formation, previously known as the Thanet Beds, consisting of a fine-grained sand that can be clayey and glauconitic and is of Thanetian (late Paleocene) age. It rests unconformably on the Chalk Group, and forms the base of the cliffs in the Reculver and Herne Bay area. Above the Thanet Sand are the Upnor Formation, a medium sandstone, and the sandy clays of the Harwich Formation at the Paleocene–Eocene boundary. The highest cliffs, rising to a maximum height of about to the west of Reculver, have a cap of London Clay, a fine silty clay of Eocene age. The surface consists mainly of flint gravel with some areas of brickearth, both of which are glacial deposits.

Rocks such as these are easily washed away by the sea. It has been estimated that the Roman fort was originally about 1 mile (1.6 km) from the sea to the north, but the cliffs are eroding at a rate of approximately per year. Coastal erosion had washed away most of Reculver village by 1800, leading residents to re-locate to Hillborough, within Reculver parish. A plan is in place to manage this erosion whereby some parts of the coastline such as the country park will be allowed to continue eroding, and others – including the site of the Roman fort and the medieval church – will be protected from further erosion. New sea defences were built in the 1990s, including covering the beaches around the church with boulders.

The warmest time of year in Kent is in July and August, with average maximum temperatures of around , and the coolest is in January and February, with average minimum temperatures of around . Average maximum and minimum temperatures are about 0.5 °C (0.3 °F) higher than they are nationally. Locations on the north coast of Kent, like Reculver, are sometimes warmer than areas further inland, owing to the influence of the North Downs to the south. Average annual rainfall in Kent is about , with the highest rainfall from October to January. This is lower than the national average annual rainfall of . Occasional drought conditions can lead to the imposition of Temporary Use Bans to conserve water supplies, and it was announced in 2013 that a water desalination plant was to be built at Reculver to increase supplies.

==Demography==
In the census of 1801 the number of people present in the parish of Reculver, enclosing an area of about and including the settlements of Hillborough, Bishopstone and part of Broomfield, was given as 252, and this figure remained roughly stable until the 20th century when a dramatic increase was recorded: in the census of 1931, the number was given as 829. But this included holidaymakers, and in 2005 the number of people at Reculver was estimated to increase to &quot;over 1,000 at the height of the [summer] holiday season&quot;.
In the 2001 census, conducted on 29 April, the relevant census area covered and included only Reculver and outlying farms and houses, in which 135 people were found, almost a quarter of whom were in caravans. All were born in the United Kingdom except for three individuals from the Republic of Ireland and three from South Africa. Gender was given as 69 female and 66 male, and the age distribution was 12 individuals aged 0–5 years (8.8%), 16 aged 6–16 years (14%), 30 aged 17–35 years (22.2%), 14 aged 36–45 years (10.3%), 44 aged 46–64 years (32.5%) and 21 aged 65 years and over (15.5%). Half (67) of all the individuals recorded were described as economically active, with 58 of these having employers and nine being self-employed; none were recorded as full-time students or unemployed. Twenty-four people (17.7%) were described as retired. Of those aged 16–74 years, 14 (12.8%) were placed at the highest level for education or qualification. Christianity was the only religion represented, by 99 individuals, with 22 recorded as having no religion and 14 whose religion was not stated. From April 2001 to March 2002 the average gross weekly income of households in the electoral ward of Reculver was estimated by the Office for National Statistics as £560, or £29,120 per year; this was below the average for the south-east of England, excluding London, which was £660, or £34,320.

In the 2011 census the relevant census area was identical to the electoral ward, an area of , and produced information for the area as a whole. Therefore, while the total resident population of the ward at the 2011 census numbered 8,845, detailed information comparable to that of the 2001 census is unavailable.

==Economy==

In the Middle Ages Reculver was one of several members, or &quot;limbs&quot;, of the Cinque Port of Sandwich: possibly originating in a loose association in the 11th century, this status was first recorded in about 1300. Like other limbs at Fordwich, Deal, Sarre and Stonar, it was then involved in maritime trade, and it shared in the Cinque Ports&#x27; duty to supply ships and men for the king&#x27;s use, in return for concessions such as tax exemption. The last surviving record of Reculver as a limb of Sandwich dates from 1377, and its name is absent from Cinque Port records of 1432, probably because of &quot;drastic coastal erosion, and the consequent silting up of the Wantsum Channel between Sarre and the North Mouth [adjacent to Reculver].&quot; In 1220 King Henry III granted the archbishop of Canterbury a market to be held weekly at Reculver on Thursdays, and an annual fair was held there on Saint Giles&#x27;s Day, 1 September.

Oysters from the &quot;Rutupian shore&quot; – the shoreline around Richborough, a little over to the south-east – were noted as a delicacy by the Roman poet Juvenal, and in 1576 oysters from Reculver itself were &quot;reputed as farre to passe those of Whitstaple, as Whitstaple doe surmount the rest of this shyre [of Kent] in savorie saltnesse.&quot; An enclosed area of salt water known as the Dene was leased for the breeding of oysters and lobsters in 1867; as of 2014 there is a hatchery for oysters in saltwater ponds on the eastern side of Reculver belonging to a seafood company that is based there. In May 1914, Anglo-Westphalian Kent Coalfield Ltd drilled a borehole at Reculver in search of coal, since it had found a seam of coal thick at nearby Chislet and was developing a colliery there; possible samples of coal were retrieved from the borehole at a depth of , but it was abandoned, no workable seam having been found.
Today Reculver is dominated by static caravan parks, the first of which appeared after the Second World War. Also present are a country park, the King Ethelbert public house, which is a free house, and a nearby shop and cafe. Reculver was defined as a &quot;key heritage area&quot; in 2008, and there are plans for its development as a destination for green tourism. Canterbury City Council&#x27;s &quot;Reculver Masterplan&quot;, adopted in 2009, envisaged the creation of 100 touring pitches in its caravan park, south-east of the Roman fort, which was then leased to the Camping and Caravanning Club. That caravan park was closed by 2015, when Canterbury City Council undertook a consultation on its incorporation into the country park.

===Community facilities===
Reculver Church of England Primary School is adjacent to the church at Hillborough. The school&#x27;s site also hosts Beltinge Day Nursery and Reculver Breakfast and Afterschool Club. The nearest school for older children is Herne Bay High School.

The nearest post office is in Beltinge, about to the west-southwest. The nearest general practitioner (GP) surgery is about to the south-west, between Bishopstone and Hillborough, with others in Beltinge, Herne Bay, Broomfield and St Nicholas-at-Wade. While the nearest general hospital is the Queen Victoria Memorial Hospital, about to the west in Herne Bay, the closest hospital with an Accident and Emergency (A&amp;E) department is the Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother Hospital, about to the east in Margate. The nearest community centre is Reculver and Beltinge Memorial Hall, about to the west-southwest.

==Landmarks==
===Ruined church of St Mary===
The medieval towers of the ruined church of St Mary are Reculver&#x27;s &quot;most dominant features&quot;. They were added in the late 12th century to a church founded in 669, when King Ecgberht of Kent granted land to Bassa the priest for the foundation of a monastery. The church was sited near the centre of the Roman fort, and was built &quot;almost completely from demolished Roman structures&quot;. In 692 the monastery&#x27;s abbot Berhtwald was elected archbishop of Canterbury, and King Eadberht II of Kent was buried inside the church in the 760s. The church building was considerably enlarged over time, the last additions being made in the 15th century. But it retained many prominent Anglo-Saxon features, including a triple chancel arch and a stone high cross, though this had been removed by 1784.

The church was demolished in 1809, in what has been described as &quot;an act of vandalism for which there can be few parallels even in the blackest records of the nineteenth century&quot;. Archaeological excavations in the 19th and 20th centuries established the building sequence of the church, and areas of missing wall are marked on the ground by concrete edged with flint. The ruins are now in the care of English Heritage. The sea defences protecting them were installed by Trinity House in 1810, but are now maintained by the Environment Agency. Fragments of the stone cross, and two stone columns that had been part of the church&#x27;s triple chancel arch, are on display in Canterbury Cathedral.

A byname for the towers is the &quot;Twin Sisters&quot;, and an account of how this first arose was current about a hundred years after its supposed happening in the late 15th century, but in its usual form, for example in a 19th-century travel guide, it is mostly an invention created around &quot;pseudo-historical detail&quot;. &quot;The Ingoldsby Legends&quot; includes a re-invention of the story in which two brothers, Robert and Richard de Birchington, are substituted for the two sisters. Clive Aslet used the byname in noting that, in Ian Fleming&#x27;s &quot;James Bond&quot; novel &quot;Goldfinger&quot;, the villain Auric Goldfinger &quot;lived at Reculver&quot;.

===Country park===

Reculver Country Park is a nature reserve managed by Canterbury City Council and the Kent Wildlife Trust. It covers and comprises a narrow strip of protected, cliff-top land about long, running from the remaining enclosure of the Roman fort west to Bishopstone Glen. Most of the cliff-top and all of the foreshore in this area are included in the Thanet Coast SSSI, the Thanet Coast and Sandwich Bay SPA and the similarly named Ramsar site; most of the Country Park is also part of the Bishopstone Cliffs local nature reserve, which covers of the coastline between Beltinge and Reculver. In winter brent geese and wading birds such as sanderlings and turnstones may be seen; during the summer months the largest colony of sand martins in Kent nests in the soft cliffs, on top of which fulmars were also reported to have begun nesting in 2013, and wading curlews may be seen at any time. The grasslands on the cliff top are among the few remaining cliff-top wildflower meadows left in Kent, and are home to butterflies and skylarks. Also present are the nationally scarce hog&#x27;s fennel and two species of digger wasp, &quot;Alysson lunicornis&quot; and &quot;Ectemnius ruficornis&quot;. The coastline here forms part of the &quot;key on-land Palaeocene site in the London Basin&quot;, and is the only location in the Woolwich Beds to contain wood. The foreshore displays a &quot;rich invertebrate and vertebrate fossil fauna ... and the section has been extensively studied over many years.&quot; The park first won a Green Flag Award in 2005, and it is estimated that over 200,000 people visit it each year, including up to 3,500 students for educational trips. Canterbury City Council&#x27;s &quot;Reculver Masterplan&quot; envisages purchasing farmland to the south of the country park to replace land lost to the sea through coastal erosion.

In 2011 it was found that the shoreline in the Herne Bay area, including Reculver, had come under threat from an invasive species, the carpet sea squirt (&quot;Didemnum vexillum&quot;), also known as &quot;marine vomit&quot;. First recorded in UK waters in 2008, the carpet sea squirt is indigenous to the sea around Japan, but it has been carried to other parts of the world, including New Zealand and the US, on boat hulls, fishing equipment and floating seaweed. Carpet sea squirt can overgrow other, sessile species, &quot;potentially smothering species living in gravel and affecting fisheries.&quot;

===Centre for renewable energy===
A visitor centre in Reculver Country Park re-opened in 2009 as the Reculver Renewable Energy and Interpretation Centre, &quot;marking 200 years of the moving of Reculver village&quot;. The centre features a log burner fuelled by logs from the Blean woodland, solar and photovoltaic panels provide electrical power, and there are displays describing the history, geography and wildlife of the area.

==Transport==

Reculver is at the end of an unclassified road, Reculver Lane, and is about by road from the nearest major junction of the A299, or Thanet Way. From Roman times there was a connection to Canterbury by road, the presence of which is reflected in parish boundaries for much of its length. An estate map of 1685 shows the Reculver end of this road as &quot;The King&#x27;s highe Way&quot;, which may have been in use until 1875, when it was reported that a public road had been diverted because of a cliff fall near Love Street Farm. Remains of a Roman road leading to the east gate of the fort have also been found, which were &quot;substantial ... consisting of a sandstone platform [10–13 feet (3–4 m)] wide and at least [11 inches (30 cm)] deep.&quot;

In 1817 the nearest access to transport by coach was at Upstreet, about south of Reculver, which lay on a route that ran between London, Canterbury and the Isle of Thanet. In 1839 coaches and vans ran daily from Herne Bay to Canterbury and on to destinations on the southern and eastern coasts of Kent, with access to the English Channel, at Deal, Dover, Sandgate and Hythe. In 1865 transport from Herne Bay was available by &quot;fly&quot; – a type of one-horse hackney carriage. Today, bus services calling at a stop adjacent to the King Ethelbert Inn connect Reculver with Herne Bay, Canterbury, Birchington and Margate.
The nearest railway stations are at Herne Bay, about to the west, and Birchington-on-Sea, about to the east. Both stations are on the Chatham Main Line, running between London&#x27;s Victoria station and Ramsgate, on the south-eastern coast of the Isle of Thanet. The railway first reached Herne Bay from the west in 1861 and was extended to Ramsgate Harbour railway station by 1863, but no provision was made for public access from Reculver, although purchase of land for a station there had been envisaged and a short-lived goods station was opened in 1864. In the same year a passenger station was proposed for Reculver, primarily to serve tourists, but it was not built. In 1884 the South Eastern Railway proposed building a branch line from its station at Grove Ferry on the Ashford to Ramsgate line to join the London, Chatham and Dover Railway&#x27;s Chatham Main Line at Reculver, thereby linking Canterbury and Herne Bay. The Canterbury and Kent Coast Railway Bill was presented to a select committee of MPs in January 1885: the London, Chatham and Dover Railway objected to it, particularly the junction with their main line at Reculver, so the Bill was rejected and the line was not built. Rudimentary houses were erected by the East Kent Railway company on nearby marshland in 1858 for the navvies who constructed the line through the area; these had been taken over by enginemen of the South Eastern and Chatham Railway by October 1904, when they were replaced by cottages.

There is no provision for access to Reculver from the sea, but there were maritime connections from at least the 1st century, when the Roman fort of &quot;Regulbium&quot; had a supporting harbour. The quantity and variety of coins found at Reculver dating from the 7th century to the 8th are almost certainly related to its location on a major trade route through the Wantsum Channel; there was probably still a harbour in Anglo-Saxon times, and the monastery may well have operated a &quot;fleet of ships and its own boatyard.&quot; Details in the 10th-century charter in which King Eadred gave Reculver to the archbishops of Canterbury suggest that there was then an island immediately to the north, creating a &quot;mini-Wantsum [Channel that] could have provided a sheltered channel for beaching and berthing ships&quot;; the present day Black Rock beyond the shoreline may be a remnant of this island.
In the 17th century an inlet to the north-west was described as &quot;anciently for a harber of ships, called now The Old Pen&quot;. In the 18th century there was a place for landing passengers and goods at the village, and the former name of the King Ethelbert Inn, the &quot;Hoy and Anchor&quot;, makes reference to hoys, a local type of merchant sailing vessel. These continued to serve the coastline of northern Kent in the mid-19th century. In 1810 a canal was proposed to run from the coast between Reculver and St Nicholas-at-Wade to Canterbury, with a harbour for sea-going vessels at the northern end, which would be accessible from Reculver by a new road beginning at the inn, but none of this was built. Passenger steamships called at Herne Bay pier on their route between London and destinations along the north coast of Kent from 1832, but this service ceased in the first half of the 20th century. A travel guide of 1865 advised that

Coastguards were stationed at Reculver from the mid-19th century until they were withdrawn in the mid-20th century, but the towers of the ruined church remain a landmark for mariners, both practically and through their use to mark the division between areas covered by Thames Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre (MRCC) and Dover MRCC.

==Religion==
Early in the 19th century a new Anglican parish church was built at Hillborough, about south-west of Reculver, as a replacement for the old church of St Mary. The new church was given the same dedication to St Mary and, standing on a plot of land bought for £30, it was consecrated on 13 April 1813. A &quot;miserable little built in a rough and poverty-stricken style&quot;, it had a leaking roof and was already decaying by 1874, and was replaced by the present structure, begun in 1876 and consecrated on 12 June 1878.

The church begun in 1876 was designed in the Gothic Revival style by the architect Joseph Clarke, who was surveyor for the diocese of Canterbury at the time. It has seating for about 100 people, and is a &quot;simple and relatively plain building&quot;, though it incorporates stonework from the old church at Reculver. The medieval baptismal font in the church is probably from the former chapel of All Saints, Shuart, on the Isle of Thanet, which was demolished in the 15th century. A war memorial stands at the northern edge of the churchyard, facing into the adjacent Reculver Lane, and records the names of 27 parishioners who died fighting in the First World War and the Second World War.

==Notable people==

King Eadberht II of Kent was buried in the church at Reculver in the 760s. His tomb was in the south &quot;porticus&quot; of the church, adjacent to the chancel: this &quot;porticus&quot; later became part of the church&#x27;s south aisle. This was traditionally believed to be the tomb of King Æthelberht I of Kent, and was &quot;of an antique form, mounted with two spires&quot;. John Langton, a chancellor under the kings Edward I and Edward II, was also a rector of Reculver, as was Simon of Faversham, a 14th-century philosopher and theologian: he was given the position but was forced to defend it to the Pope, and died in France, either on his way to the papal curia in Avignon or after his arrival, some time before 19 July 1306.

The first recorded owner of Brook, about south-southwest of Reculver, was Nicholas Tingewick, physician to King Edward I and rector of Reculver until 1310, when he became its first recorded vicar. He was regarded as the &quot;best doctor for the king&#x27;s health&quot;, and there are more records of his medical practice than there are for &quot;most physicians of his time.&quot; Brook subsequently passed to James de la Pine, sheriff of Kent in the early 1350s. His grandson sold it to an ancestor of Henry Cheyne, who was elected knight of the shire for Kent in 1563, and was created &quot;Lord Cheyney&quot; in 1572. He had sold all of his possessions in Kent by 1574 to &quot;finance his extravagance&quot;, and Brook subsequently became the property of Sir Cavalliero Maycote, who was a leading courtier to Elizabeth I and James I. He had a &quot;handsome monument [on the south wall of the chancel in the church at Reculver] representing Sir Cavalliero and Lady Maycote, with their nine children, all in alabaster figures, kneeling&quot;. Brook is now Brook Farm, where there is a remnant of Maycote&#x27;s home in the form of a gateway, which is a &quot;very rustic Elizabethan affair&quot;, all of brick, with .

Thomas Broke, alderman and MP for Calais in the mid-16th century, may have been a son of Thomas Brooke of Reculver, as well as being a &quot;religious radical&quot;. Ralph Brooke, officer of arms as Rouge Croix Pursuivant and York Herald under Elizabeth I and James I, died in 1625 and was buried inside the church, where he was commemorated by a black marble tablet on the south wall of the chancel, showing him dressed in his herald&#x27;s coat.

Robert Hunt, vicar of Reculver from 1595 to 1602, became minister of religion to the English colonial settlement at Jamestown, Virginia, sailing there in the ship &quot;Susan Constant&quot; in 1606, and celebrated probably &quot;the first known service of holy communion in what is today the United States of America on 21 June 1607.&quot; Barnabas Knell was vicar from 1602 to 1646: during the English Civil War his son Paul Knell, born in about 1615, was chaplain to a regiment of Royalist cuirassiers, to whom he preached a sermon, &quot;The convoy of a Christian&quot;, at the siege of Gloucester in August 1643. An estate map of 1685 shows that much of the land around Reculver then belonged to James Oxenden, who spent much of his life as an MP for Kent constituencies between 1679 and 1702.

==In popular culture==

Author Russell Hoban repurposes Reculver as &quot;Reakys Over&quot; in his 1980, post apocalyptic novel &quot;Riddley Walker&quot;.

<doc id="793604" wikidata="Q4761767" url="?curid=793604" title="Aneurysm of sinus of Valsalva">
<text>[[Aneurysm]] of the [[aortic sinus]], also known as the sinus of Valsalva, is a rare abnormality of the aorta, the largest artery in the body. The aorta normally has three small pouches that sit directly above the aortic valve (the sinuses of Valsalva), and an aneurysm of one of these sinuses is a thin-walled swelling. Aneurysms may affect the right (65–85%), non-coronary (10–30%), or rarely the left (&lt; 5%) coronary sinus. These aneurysms may not cause any symptoms but if large can cause shortness of breath, palpitations or blackouts. Aortic sinus aneurysms can burst or rupture into adjacent cardiac chambers, which can lead to heart failure if untreated.

Aortic sinus aneurysms may occur in isolation, or may be seen in association with other diseases of the aorta including Marfan syndrome, Loeys-Dietz syndrome, and bicuspid aortic valve. They can be diagnosed using an echocardiogram or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. Treatment includes blood pressure control but surgical repair may be needed, especially if the aneurysm ruptures.

==Symptoms and signs==
If unruptured, sinus of Valsalva aneurysm (commonly abbreviated SVA or SOVA) is usually asymptomatic and typically goes undetected until symptoms appear or medical imaging is performed for other reasons. If symptoms do occur, the most common are shortness of breath, palpitations, myocardial ischemia, and syncope. Even less common, but more serious, presentations are embolic stroke and myocardial infarction due to blockage of a coronary artery by the aneurysm.

A ruptured aneurysm typically leads to an aortocardiac shunt and progressively worsening heart failure.

An aneurysm of the aortic sinus may rupture due to infective endocarditis involving the aortic wall and tertiary-stage syphilis.

The manifestations appear depending on the site where the sinus has ruptured. For example, if the sinus ruptures in a low pressure area like the right atrium or right ventricle then a continuous type of murmur is heard. The murmur is located in the left parasternal region mainly confined to the lower sternum. It is also accompanied by a superficial thrill. A ruptured Sinus of Valsalva abscess represents a surgical emergency.

==Causes==
This type of aneurysm is typically congenital and may be associated with heart defects. It is sometimes associated with Marfan syndrome or Loeys–Dietz syndrome, but may also result from Ehlers–Danlos syndrome, bicuspid aortic valve, atherosclerosis, hypoplastic left heart syndrome, syphilis, cystic medial necrosis, chest injury, or infective endocarditis.

==Diagnosis==

The first step in diagnosis is typically transthoracic echocardiography. However, if surgery is planned or if the standard echocardiogram lacks sufficient detail, then one or more additional studies are recommended. These studies include transesophageal echocardiography, 3D echocardiography, CT Angiography and aortic angiography. Cardiac MRI may be another option.

==Treatment==
Medical therapy of aneurysm of the aortic sinus includes blood pressure control through the use of drugs, such as beta blockers.

Another approach is surgical repair. The determination to perform surgery is usually based upon the diameter of the aortic root (with 5 centimeters being a rule of thumb - a normal size is 2-3 centimeters) and the rate of increase in its size (as determined through repeated echocardiography).

An alternative to surgical repair or a ruptured aneurysm is percutaneous closure. In this technique, a wire is introduced via a small incision in the groin and advanced through the vascular system to the aneurysm. A closure device is advanced along the wire before being expanded to straddle the site of rupture.

== Prognosis ==
If a sinus of Valsalva aneurysm ruptures, the life expectancy without treatment is approximately four years. Surgery carries a 1% risk of intra-operative death with higher risks associated with infected aneurysms, and 5- to 10-year survival rates following surgery range from 82 to 97%.

== Epidemiology ==
Aneurysms of the sinuses of Valsalva are estimated to affect 0.09% of the population. Rupture of a sinus of Valsalva can occur at any age. Rupture is five times more likely to occur in those of far eastern than western ethnic backgrounds, and is twice as likely to occur in males than females.

== History ==
The first description of sinus of Valsalva aneurysm was made in 1939.

<text>All Lights Fucked on the Hairy Amp Drooling is a cassette released in 1994 by Canadian musician Efrim Menuck, using the name God Speed You Black Emperor!. Given a limited release of 33 cassette copies in December 1994, the album quickly fell into obscurity and was thought lost by the band&#x27;s fans, often described as the &quot;Holy Grail of Post-Rock&quot;. Segments of the tape were leaked online in 2013 and the full recording surfaced in 2022, after which Menuck officially re-released the album on Bandcamp.

== Background ==
According to a 1998 interview with Godspeed You! Black Emperor, the album was published on cassette in 1994 and limited to 33 copies. At that point, the group consisted only of Efrim Menuck, Mauro Pezzente, and Mike Moya. Menuck says the limited release was &quot;because that&#x27;s what I could afford&quot; due to the expense of its handmade inserts. According to &quot;Nashville Scene&quot;, &quot;the tapes were as quickly sold as they were lost; there are no reported copies aside from what their label, Constellation Records, preserved&quot;, and Constellation has never reissued it. In 2013, &quot;FACT&quot; remarked that the release was &quot;thought to be lost forever by the band&#x27;s fans&quot;.

When asked about the subject in a 2010 interview, Menuck stated that &quot;All Lights&quot; is a vocal rock album that bears little relation to the band&#x27;s later work, and that he &quot;keep[s] expecting it&#x27;s gonna pop up [on the internet] but it never does&quot;. In other interviews, Menuck stated that the album was a 4-track Portastudio recording.

Menuck says &quot;I was with a group of people, and we had engagement with each other. We were figuring out how to engage with the world together. That was a big missing piece in my life, and none of it would have happened if I hadn&#x27;t made this goofy little cassette.&quot;

== Reappearances ==
===2013===
In 2013, a Reddit user, who claimed to have purchased a copy of the tape in Moncton, New Brunswick, uploaded photographs of the cassette box and the last two songs on the A-side, &quot;Random Luvly Moncton Blue(s)&quot; and &quot;Dadmomdaddy&quot;. The user&#x27;s Reddit account was deleted shortly afterward, leading some news outlets to suggest the alleged rediscovery could be another hoax.

===2022===
On February 4, 2022, a 4chan user posted a Mega link to the entire album to the site&#x27;s music message board. The album was uploaded to YouTube shortly after by user &quot;naskivik&quot;. Constellation Records, the later label of Godspeed You! Black Emperor, initially declined to comment on the leaked audio.

On February 14, 2022, the band officially released the album on their Bandcamp page without prior announcement, confirming the authenticity of both the 2022 and 2013 leaks and clearing the mystery surrounding the album. The Bandcamp release described the album as a &quot;retirement letter&quot; which was recorded in mid-1993. The sole musician for most of the album was Menuck, with minor bass contributions from Pezzente and two guest musicians, Dano Leblanc on acoustic guitar and Menuck&#x27;s then-partner (credited as &quot;D.C.&quot;) on vocals on &quot;$13.13&quot;. All proceeds from sales are to be donated to the Canadians for Justice and Peace in the Middle East&#x27;s campaign to provide medical oxygen to the Gaza Strip.

Menuck was interviewed in a Kreative Kontrol podcast and stated that although he does not regret its re-release, the album is &quot;not Godspeed&quot;:&quot;I don&#x27;t feel like the cassette was a mistake, I don&#x27;t feel embarrassed by it [...] If I was younger than I am [...], I would have just put it on SoundCloud. [...] I&#x27;m not confused about any of that, you know? It&#x27;s just [that] you&#x27;ve brought up another point, which is it&#x27;s not Godspeed, and it feels disrespectful to my friends who I&#x27;ve played music with for almost 30 years to be presenting this thing that was just me and a tiny room, you know?&quot;

==Track listing==
===Cassette release===
The original 1994 release consisted of 27 tracks split across two sides of a cassette.


===Digital release===
The 2022 digital release through Bandcamp consisted of 4 tracks each comprising a half of one of the original cassette sides.
== Personnel ==
* Efrim Menuck – vocals, all instruments
* Mauro Pezzente – bass
* &quot;D.C.&quot; (Efrim&#x27;s partner at the time) – vocals on &quot;$13.13&quot;
* Dano Leblanc – acoustic guitar, &quot;backwards hash&quot;

<text>Zeehan is a town on the west coast of Tasmania, Australia south-west of Burnie. It is part of the West Coast Council, along with the seaport Strahan and neighbouring mining towns of Rosebery and Queenstown.

== History ==
The greater Zeehan area was inhabited by the indigenous Peerapper and Tommeginne clans of the North West group for over 10,000 years prior to the British colonisation of Tasmania. They were greatly coastal peoples, residing in small numbers on a diet consisting of muttonbirds, seals, swan eggs and cider gum, and constructed bark huts when strong westerly winds brought about rain and icy temperatures.

===European naming===
On 24 November 1642, Dutch explorer Abel Tasman became the first European explorer to sight and document the Heemskirk and West Coast Ranges. Tasman sailed his ships close to the coastal area which today encompasses the Southwest Conservation Area, south of Macquarie Harbour, but was unable to send a landing party ashore due to poor weather and did not make contact with any South West Tasmanian groups. In their circumnavigation of Tasmania between 1798 and 1799, George Bass and Matthew Flinders named the Heemskirk Ranges mountains Mount Heemskirk and Mount Zeehan after Tasman&#x27;s ships, the warship &quot;Heemskerck&quot; (itself named after Jacob van Heemskerck, whose surname means &quot;from Heemskerk&quot;) and the fluyt &quot;Zeehaen&quot; (Old Dutch for &quot;Sea Rooster&quot;) in honour of Tasman&#x27;s voyage of exploration. Although Dutch in origin, Bass and Flinder&#x27;s Anglicised naming of Mount Heemskirk and Mount Zeehan created some of the oldest British place names in Tasmania.

===Mining boom===
Tin was discovered nearby at Mount Bischoff in 1871 and at Mount Heemskirk in 1879. Deposits of silver and lead were discovered in the area by Frank Long in 1882 and Mount Zeehan Post Office opened on 1 August 1888. The township was named Zeehan in 1890 and over the following decades, quickly expanded due to its proximity to the Zeehan mineral field. The peak period for mining was up to the First World War, when 159 companies operated at the town&#x27;s peak and the town stock exchange had 60 members. With a main street over long, the township claimed over 20 hotels, several pubs, a hospital, and two theatres, the Gaiety Theatre and Theatre Royal. It developed a friendly rivalry with Queenstown, and while the silver boom lasted it was known as the &quot;Silver City&quot;. In the first decade of the twentieth century it was the third largest town in Tasmania, after Hobart and Launceston. Sharing a mineral field and railway, the mining locality of Dundas was historically paired with Zeehan. A port was established at Trial Harbour for Zeehan, however its exposure to the Roaring Forties made the site a vulnerable anchorage. After the construction of the Strahan–Zeehan Railway, Strahan became Zeehan&#x27;s favourable port. The mines earned some two hundred thousand dollars per year for two decades, before progressively declining till the 1960s, when the last mines, Montana and Oceana were closed.

===Decline===

The population of Zeehan-Dundas peaked at 10,000 in about 1910, over ten times the current population. In the 1970s it saw increased activity due to operations at the nearby Renison Bell tin mine, and again in the 1990s. It had its own council until the early 1900s, and has since merged with surrounding councils to form the Municipality of West Coast. At the , Zeehan had a population of 728. The town was subject to several acts of arson in the 2010s, one of which saw damage to historic buildings dating back to the 1890s. The township has had its share of criminal characters-with various acts of manslaughter, assault and aggravated burglary in its history both past and present.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, ten parcels of land, some as cheap as $8000, were sold by the West Coast Council as a means to attract new residents. It is hoped tourism will continue to bolster the local economy, with a new takeaway (Wildz Takeaway) open on the main road, and the creation of The Western Echo newspaper. A History of the West Coast model railway and diorama display is now open opposite the museum and is being built as a tourist attraction. The area has also seen an influx of visitors since the establishment in 2022 of several mountain biking trails around Zeehan, Trial Harbour and Queenstown.

==Pollution==
In 2021, a study of the levels of pollution in the lakes of northwest Tasmania found a level of contamination with lead copper, cadmium and arsenic equal to the most severely polluted lakes in the world. Owen Tarn and Basin Lake near Queenstown were the worst, but Dove Lake, Lake Dobson, Lake Cygnus, and Perched Lake were also affected. These lakes are in the mountainous areas up to downwind from Zeehan and Queenstown and have been adulterated by atmospheric pollution mainly caused by open cut mining proceeding uninhibited till finally controlled by the Environment Protection Act of 1973. Recent bushfires have caused an increase in atmospheric mercury levels to three or four times the pre-industrial level due to the release of mercury previously locked in trees. Evidence indicates the area has suffered from dangerous levels of environmental pollution for over a century.

==Roads==
Zeehan is connected with the north coast of Tasmania by the Murchison Highway, to Strahan by the Zeehan-Strahan Road, and Queenstown by the Zeehan Highway.

== Railways ==

Zeehan was an important railway location—the end of the Emu Bay Railway, and the beginning of the government-owned Strahan-Zeehan Railway service that connected to Strahan and Regatta Point, where the Mount Lyell Railway connected to Queenstown. Also at early stages of the town&#x27;s history, a series of timber trams spread out from Zeehan towards the Pieman River as well as a number of other locations.

Some of the smaller railway operations east of Zeehan were unique. One had the honour of having the first Garratt locomotive designed and built for its operations.

After the government rail connection between Zeehan and Strahan closed, the Mount Lyell Company trucked its copper ore to the Emu Bay Railway terminus at Melba Flats, a few kilometres east of Zeehan.

==Newspapers==
The &#x27;Western Echo&#x27; newspaper launched in November 2021, with local residents&#x27; contributing significantly to the content. It represents the West Coast communities of Zeehan, Queenstown, Strahan, Rosebery, Tullah and Waratah. 
The historical &quot;Zeehan and Dundas Herald&quot; ran from 1890 to 1922, with the region being served intermittently by other print newspapers from the 1980&#x27;s. 

== Economy ==
The Zeehan economy relies heavily on the money brought in by local and West Coast Tasmanian regional tourism. 

The mining of base metals and tin are significant contributors to the community. Mines include:
* Bluestone Tin&#x27;s Renison Bell tin mine.
* Mallee Resources Avebury nickel mine.
* Tartana Minerals Limited and Intec Zeehan Zinc Residues - re-treatment of the Zeehan Zinc smelter slag and matte. 
* Australian Hualong Pt Ltd - Comstock Mine.

In 2018, construction began on the $280 million Granville Harbour Wind Farm, Tasmania&#x27;s tallest wind farm, located 35 km north-west of Zeehan. This took Tasmania to 100 percent renewable energy, and in 2020, it was Australia&#x27;s best performing wind farm.

In 2022, the Avebury nickel mine re-opened after an extended period in care and maintenance. In June 2024, due to the falling nickel price, Avebury again entered care and maintenance, with the loss of approximately 180 jobs.

== Tourism features ==
The main streetscape of Zeehan is one significant feature of the town, featuring many boom-time and pre-Federation buildings. Among these attractions is the Gaiety Theatre, Grand Hotel and the West Coast Heritage Centre (formerly known as the &quot;West Coast Pioneers Museum&quot;) located within the former Zeehan School of Mines and Metallurgy building. The West Coast Heritage Centre features examples of Tasmania&#x27;s mineral emblem, the valuable crystal crocoite, as well as other geological specimens and historic mining artefacts.
==Notable people==
The famed concert pianist Eileen Joyce was born in Zeehan, and Eileen Joyce Memorial Park in Zeehan was named in her honour. Reverend Dorothy McRae-McMahon, Australia&#x27;s first openly gay clergy member and human rights activist was born in Zeehan.

==Notable events==
Parts of a 1925 Australian silent film, &quot;Jewelled Nights&quot; were shot on Savage River, north of the town in the Tarkine rainforest.

Bushfires were reported near Zeehan in 1896, 1908, 1977, 1980 and 2006. In November 2012 the town was threatened by bushfires from two directions. However, the alert was later removed.
There were also bushfires in February 1890 (diary of Edward Jennings and this http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article13761103).

Bushfires also threatened Zeehan in 2019- with the fire coming approximately 2 kilometres from the town. Residents were evacuated to Queenstown and Strahan after it was decided that the school was no longer a safe locale for residents to gather.

2023 crime drama, dark comedy series, &quot;Bay of Fires&quot;, starring Marta Dusseldorp was filmed at locations in Zeehan, Queenstown and Strahan in 2022.

==Climate==
Zeehan has a cool, wet oceanic climate (&quot;Cfb&quot;) with cool damp summers and long, chilly, rainy winters. Snow falls on an average of 2.4 days a year.

<doc id="793629" wikidata="Q1435460" url="?curid=793629" title="People's Movement against the EU">
<text>The People&#x27;s Movement against the EU () is a far-left political association in Denmark against the European Union. It was founded in 1972 as a cross-party campaign platform for a &#x27;no&#x27; vote in Denmark&#x27;s referendum on EEC membership. The People&#x27;s Movement was represented in the European Parliament from 1979 until 2019, when it lost its single seat in the European Parliament election.

The movement has approximately 3,500 personal members, as well as collective members such as political parties, NGOs and trade unions (mostly local branches). The individual members are organised in about 100 local branches.

==Policies==
The primary objective of the movement is to withdraw the country from the EU and rejoin the European Free Trade Association, unlike some other Eurosceptic organisations which hope to be able to reform or downgrade the EU. According to the movement, it supports democracy, sustainable development and increased cooperation in organisations like the United Nations, Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, the Council of Europe and the Nordic Council. It strongly opposes the Lisbon treaty and has campaigned for a Danish referendum on the EU Constitution.

The People&#x27;s Movement against the EU is a cross-party movement. It does not regard itself a political party and claims to be non-affiliated to the traditional left/right-scale, hence it does not contest national parliamentary or local elections. Its traditional base is found among left-wingers and trade union members, but there are also non-partisans and non-socialist members, e.g., from the Social Liberal Party, the Social Democrats, the Conservative Party, the Green Party and the small Georgist liberal Justice Party. The movement aims at a cooperation with other political forces, although it has distanced itself from the right-wing eurosceptical Danish People&#x27;s Party.

The term &quot;People&#x27;s Movement&quot; (another possible translation is &quot;Popular Movement&quot;) is common in Denmark and does not hint at socialism, but rather means &#x27;broad movement for a common cause&#x27;. Several Danish parties label themselves people&#x27;s parties (&quot;folkeparti&quot;).

==European Parliament==
In the 2004 election, it gained 5.2% of the national vote, electing one MEP. It has been represented in the European Parliament since 1979 when direct elections were introduced. In every election since 1994, it has been part of an electoral coalition with the euro-sceptic June Movement.
Until 2002, they were part of the EDD group in the European Parliament, but then switched to being associate members of the GUE-NGL group. Ole Krarup stated that the other Danish subgroup of EDD, Jens-Peter Bonde from the June Movement, increasingly aimed at &quot;democratising&quot; or &quot;improving&quot; the EU, according to Krarup making it impossible for the People&#x27;s Movement to pursue their policies within the group. Krarup claimed that the group membership was a primarily technical matter, and that only the GUE-NGL group could secure full political autonomy of the People&#x27;s Movement. He stated that the movement&#x27;s political cross-spectrum position was not affected.

The People&#x27;s Movement is a member of EUdemocrats and TEAM (the European Alliance of EU-critical Movements) and the coordinator of TEAM is currently Jesper Morville from the People&#x27;s Movement.

At the 2019 election, The People&#x27;s Movement lost their single seat, and for the first time since 1979, they are not represented in the parliament. The loss was widely regarded as caused by the Red-Green Alliance, who traditionally have supported the party, but decided to contest the election for the first time, and won a single seat. Incumbent MEP Rina Ronja Kari reacted by saying that the movement would live on, and that &quot;the EU-opposition is not dead&quot;. Henrik Overgaard-Nielsen, formerly of the People&#x27;s Movement was elected in North West England from the Brexit Party. In October 2019 the office as chairman was established, and in November Susanna Dyre-Greensite was elected to the post.

<text>A cancer vaccine, or oncovaccine, is a vaccine that either treats existing cancer or prevents development of cancer. Vaccines that treat existing cancer are known as &quot;therapeutic&quot; cancer vaccines or tumor antigen vaccines. Some of the vaccines are &quot;autologous&quot;, being prepared from samples taken from the patient, and are specific to that patient.

Some researchers claim that cancerous cells routinely arise and are destroyed by the immune system (immunosurveillance); and that tumors form when the immune system fails to destroy them.

Some types of cancer, such as cervical cancer and liver cancer, are caused by viruses (oncoviruses). Traditional vaccines against those viruses, such as the HPV vaccine and the hepatitis B vaccine, prevent those types of cancer. Other cancers are to some extent caused by bacterial infections (e.g. stomach cancer and &quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot;). Traditional vaccines against cancer-causing bacteria (oncobacteria) are not further discussed in this article.

== Method ==
One approach to cancer vaccination is to separate proteins from cancer cells and immunize patients against those proteins as antigens, in the hope of stimulating the immune system to kill the cancer cells. Research on cancer vaccines is underway for treatment of breast, lung, colon, skin, kidney, prostate and other cancers.

Another approach is to generate an immune response &quot;in situ&quot; in the patient using oncolytic viruses. This approach was used in the drug talimogene laherparepvec, a variant of herpes simplex virus engineered to selectively replicate in tumor tissue and to express the immune stimulatory protein GM-CSF. This enhances the anti-tumor immune response to tumor antigens released following viral lysis, creating a patient-specific vaccine.

== Mechanism of action ==
Tumor antigen vaccines work the same way that viral vaccines work, by training the immune system to attack cells that contain the antigens in the vaccine. The difference is that the antigens for viral vaccines are derived from viruses or cells infected with virus, while the antigens for tumor antigen vaccines are derived from cancer cells. Since tumor antigens are antigens found in cancer cells but not normal cells, vaccinations containing tumor antigens should train the immune system to target cancer cells not healthy cells. Cancer-specific tumor antigens include peptides from proteins that are not typically found in normal cells but are activated in cancer cells or peptides containing cancer-specific mutations. Antigen-presenting cells (APCs) such as dendritic cells take up antigens from the vaccine, process them into epitopes, and present the epitopes to T-cells via Major Histocompatibility Complex proteins. If T-cells recognize the epitope as foreign, the adaptive immune system is activated and target cells that express the antigens.

== Prevention vs. treatment ==
Viral vaccines typically work by preventing the spread of the virus. Similarly, cancer vaccines can be designed to target common antigens before cancer evolves if an individual has appropriate risk factors. Additional preventive applications include preventing the cancer from evolving further or undergoing metastasis and preventing relapse after remission. Therapeutic vaccines focus on killing existing tumors. While cancer vaccines have generally been demonstrated to be safe, their efficacy still needs improvement. One way to potentially improve vaccine therapy is by combining the vaccine with other types of immunotherapy aimed at stimulating the immune system. Since tumors often evolve mechanisms to suppress the immune system, immune checkpoint blockade has recently received a lot of attention as a potential treatment to be combined with vaccines. For therapeutic vaccines, combined therapies can be more aggressive, but greater care to ensure the safety of relatively healthy patients is needed for combinations involving preventive vaccines.

== Types ==
Cancer vaccines can be cell-based, protein- or peptide-based, gene-based (DNA/RNA). or live attenuated bacterial- or viral organisms. 

Cell-based vaccines include tumor cells or tumor cell lysates. Tumor cells from the patient are predicted to contain the greatest spectrum of relevant antigens, but this approach is expensive and often requires too many tumor cells from the patient to be effective. Using a combination of established cancer cell lines that resemble the patient&#x27;s tumor can overcome these barriers, but this approach has yet to be effective. Canvaxin, which incorporates three melanoma cell lines, failed phase III clinical trials. Another cell-based vaccine strategy involves autologous dendritic cells (dendritic cells derived from the patient) to which tumor antigens are added. In this strategy, the antigen-presenting dendritic cells directly stimulate T-cells rather than relying on processing of the antigens by native APCs after the vaccine is delivered. The best known dendritic cell vaccine is Sipuleucel-T (Provenge), which only improved survival by four months. The efficacy of dendritic cell vaccines may be limited due to difficulty in getting the cells to migrate to lymph nodes and interact with T-cells.

Peptide-based vaccines usually consist of cancer specific-epitopes and often require an adjuvant (for example, GM-CSF) to stimulate the immune system and enhance antigenicity. Examples of these epitopes include Her2 peptides, such as GP2 and NeuVax. However, this approach requires MHC profiling of the patient because of MHC restriction. The need for MHC profile selection can be overcome by using longer peptides (&quot;synthetic long peptides&quot;) or purified protein, which are then processed into epitopes by APCs.

Gene-based vaccines are composed of the nucleic acid (DNA/RNA) encoding for the gene. The gene is then expressed in APCs and the resulting protein product is processed into epitopes. Delivery of the gene is particularly challenging for this type of vaccine. At least one drug candidate, mRNA-4157/V940, is investigating newly developed mRNA vaccines for use in this application.

Live attenuated, ampicillin-susceptible Listeria monocytogenes strains are part of CRS-207 vaccine.

== Clinical trials ==

The clinicaltrials.gov website lists over 1900 trials associated with the term &quot;cancer vaccine&quot;. Of these, 186 are Phase 3 trials.
* In a Phase III trial of follicular lymphoma (a type of non-Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma), investigators reported that the BiovaxID (on average) prolonged remission by 44.2 months, versus 30.6 months for the control.
* On April 14, 2009, Dendreon Corporation announced that their Phase III clinical trial of sipuleucel-T, a cancer vaccine designed to treat prostate cancer, had demonstrated an increase in survival. It received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for use in the treatment of advanced prostate cancer patients on April 29, 2010.
* Interim results from a phase III trial of talimogene laherparepvec in melanoma showed a significant tumour response compared to administration of GM-CSF alone.
* A 2015 Trial Watch review of peptide-based vaccines summarized the results of more than 60 trials that were published in the 13 months preceding the article. These trials targeted hematological malignancies (cancers of the blood), melanoma (skin cancer), breast cancer, head and neck cancer, gastroesophageal cancer, lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, ovarian cancer, and colorectal cancers. The antigens included peptides from HER2, telomerase (TERT), survivin (BIRC5), and Wilms&#x27; tumor 1 (WT1). Several trials also used &quot;personalized&quot; mixtures of 12-15 distinct peptides. That is, they contain a mixture of peptides from the patient&#x27;s tumor that the patient exhibits an immune response against. The results of these studies indicate that these peptide vaccines have minimal side effects and suggest that they induce targeted immune responses in patients treated with the vaccines. The article also discusses 19 clinical trials that were initiated in the same time period. These trials are targeting solid tumors, glioma, glioblastoma, melanoma, and breast, cervical, ovarian, colorectal, and non-small lung cell cancers and include antigens from MUC1, IDO1 (Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase), CTAG1B, and two VEGF receptors, FLT1 and KDR. Notably, the IDO1 vaccine is being tested in patients with melanoma in combination with the immune checkpoint inhibitor ipilimumab and the BRAF (gene) inhibitor vemurafenib.

The following table, summarizing information from another recent review shows an example of the antigen used in the vaccine tested in Phase 1/2 clinical trials for each of 10 different cancers:
== Approved oncovaccines ==
Oncophage was approved in Russia in 2008 for kidney cancer. It is marketed by Antigenics Inc.

Sipuleucel-T, Provenge, was approved by the FDA in April 2010 for metastatic hormone-refractory prostate cancer. It is marketed by Dendreon Corp.

CimaVax-EGF was approved in Cuba in 2011. Similar to Oncophage, it is not yet approved for use in the United States, although it is already undergoing phase II trials to that end.

Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) was approved by the FDA in 1990 as a vaccine for early-stage bladder cancer. BCG can be administered intravesically (directly into the bladder) or as an adjuvant in other cancer vaccines.

== Abandoned research ==
CancerVax (Canvaxin), Genitope Corp (MyVax personalized immunotherapy), and FavId FavId (Favrille Inc) are examples of cancer vaccine projects that have been terminated, due to poor phase III and IV results.

== Desirable characteristics ==
Cancer vaccines seek to target a tumor-specific antigen as distinct from self-proteins. Selection of the appropriate adjuvant to activate antigen-presenting cells to stimulate immune responses, is required. Bacillus Calmette-Guérin, an aluminum-based salt, and a squalene-oil-water emulsion are approved for clinical use. An effective vaccine should also stimulate long term immune memory to prevent tumor recurrence. Some scientists claim both the innate and adaptive immune systems must be activated to achieve total tumor elimination.

== Antigen candidates ==
Tumor antigens have been divided into two categories: &quot;shared&quot; tumor antigens; and &quot;unique&quot; tumor antigens. Shared antigens are expressed by many tumors. Unique tumor antigens result from mutations induced through physical or chemical carcinogens; they are therefore expressed only by individual tumors.

In one approach, vaccines contain whole tumor cells, though these vaccines have been less effective in eliciting immune responses in spontaneous cancer models. Defined tumor antigens decrease the risk of autoimmunity, but because the immune response is directed to a single epitope, tumors can evade destruction through antigen loss variance. A process called &quot;epitope spreading&quot; or &quot;provoked immunity&quot; may mitigate this weakness, as sometimes an immune response to a single antigen can lead to immunity against other antigens on the same tumor.

For example, since Hsp70 plays an important role in the presentation of antigens of destroyed cells including cancer cells, this protein may be used as an effective adjuvant in the development of antitumor vaccines.

== Hypothesized problems ==
A vaccine against a particular virus is relatively easy to create. The virus is foreign to the body, and therefore expresses antigens that the immune system can recognize. Furthermore, viruses usually only provide a few viable variants. By contrast, developing vaccines for viruses that mutate constantly such as influenza or HIV has been problematic. A tumor can have many cell types of cells, each with different cell-surface antigens. Those cells are derived from each patient and display few if any antigens that are foreign to that individual. This makes it difficult for the immune system to distinguish cancer cells from normal cells. Some scientists believe that renal cancer and melanoma are the two cancers with most evidence of spontaneous and effective immune responses, possibly because they often display antigens that are evaluated as foreign. Many attempts at developing cancer vaccines are directed against these tumors. However, Provenge&#x27;s success in prostate cancer, a disease that never spontaneously regresses, suggests that cancers other than melanoma and renal cancer may be equally amenable to immune attack.

However, most vaccine clinical trials have failed or had modest results according to the standard RECIST criteria. The precise reasons are unknown, but possible explanations include:
* Disease stage too advanced: bulky tumor deposits actively suppress the immune system using mechanisms such as secretion of cytokines that inhibit immune activity. The most suitable stage for a cancer vaccine is likely to be early, when the tumor volume is low, which complicates the trial process, which take upwards of five years and require many patients to reach measurable end points. One alternative is to target patients with residual disease after surgery, radiotherapy or chemotherapy that does not harm the immune system.
* Escape loss variants (that target a single tumor antigen) are likely to be less effective. Tumors are heterogeneous and antigen expression differs markedly between tumors (even in the same patient). The most effective vaccine is likely to raise an immune response against a broad range of tumor antigens to minimise the chance of the tumor mutating and becoming resistant to the therapy.
* Prior treatments may have modified tumors in ways that nullify the vaccine. (Numerous clinical trials treated patients following chemotherapy that may destroy the immune system. Patients who are immune suppressed are not good candidates for vaccines.)
* Some tumors progress rapidly and/or unpredictably, and they can outpace the immune system. Developing a mature immune response to a vaccine may require months, but some cancers (e.g. advanced pancreatic) can kill patients in less time.
* Many cancer vaccine clinical trials target patients&#x27; immune responses. Correlations typically show that the patients with the strongest immune responses lived the longest, offering evidence that the vaccine is working. An alternative explanation is that patients with the best immune responses were healthier patients with a better prognosis, and would have survived longest even without the vaccine.

== Recommendations ==
In January 2009, a review article made recommendations for successful oncovaccine development as follows:
* Target settings with a low disease burden.
* Conduct randomized Phase II trials so that the Phase III program is sufficiently powered.
* Do not randomize antigen plus adjuvant versus adjuvant alone. The goal is to establish clinical benefit of the immunotherapy (i.e., adjuvanted vaccine) over the standard of care. The adjuvant may have a low-level clinical effect that skews the trial, increasing the chances of a false negative.
* Base development decisions on clinical data rather than immune responses. Time-to-event end points are more valuable and clinically relevant.
* Design regulatory into the program from inception; invest in manufacturing and product assays early.

<doc id="793632" wikidata="Q1288405" url="?curid=793632" title="The Anacreontic Song">
<text>&quot;The Anacreontic Song&quot;, also known by its incipit &quot;To Anacreon in Heaven&quot;, was the official song of the Anacreontic Society, an 18th-century gentlemen&#x27;s club of amateur musicians in London. Composed by John Stafford Smith, the tune was later used by several writers as a setting for their patriotic lyrics. These included two songs by Francis Scott Key, most famously his poem &quot;Defence of Fort McHenry&quot;. The combination of Key&#x27;s poem and Smith&#x27;s composition became known as &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot;, which was adopted as the national anthem of the United States of America in 1931.

==The Anacreontic Society==

The Anacreontic Society was a gentlemen&#x27;s club of the kind that was popular in London in the late 18th century. In existence from approximately 1766 to 1792, the Society was dedicated to the ancient Greek poet Anacreon, who was renowned for his drinking songs and odes to love. Its members, who consisted mainly of wealthy men of high social rank, would meet on Wednesday evenings to combine musical appreciation with eating and drinking.

The Society met twelve times a year. Each meeting began at half past seven (i.e., 19:30) with a lengthy concert, featuring &quot;the best performers in London&quot;, who would be made honorary members of the Society.

The Society came to an end after the Duchess of Devonshire attended one of its meetings. Because &quot;some of the comic songs [were not] exactly calculated for the entertainment of ladies, the singers were restrained; which displeasing many of the members, they resigned one after another; and a general meeting being called, the society was dissolved&quot;. It is not clear exactly when this incident occurred, but in October 1792 it was reported that: &quot;The Anacreontic Society meets no more; it has long been struggling with symptoms of internal decay.&quot;

==The original role of the Song==
An early reference to the Anacreontic Song is found in the long-unpublished journals of gentleman-composer John Marsh (1752–1828). Writing of 11 December 1773, he recalls: 

Another reference is found in the long-unpublished &quot;Recollections&quot; of Richard John Samuel Stevens (1757–1837). In this passage, Stevens is speaking of the year 1777:
Parke, writing in the early nineteenth century, recalls: 

The Anacreontic Song served as the &quot;constitutional song&quot; of the Society. After the initial concert and meal, the Song would be sung in order to open the after-supper, more light-hearted part of proceedings. The verses, which are difficult to sing because of their wide range, would be sung by a solo singer, with the entire Society joining in the refrain. Although it is often described as a &quot;drinking song&quot;, Lichtenwanger states that &quot;To Anacreon in Heaven&quot; &quot;was not a barroom ballad, a drinking ditty to be chorused with glasses swung in rhythm&quot;, but &quot;convivial, ... in a special and stately way&quot;.

==Composition and authorship==

===Words===
Early publications of the song ascribe its lyrics to the Society&#x27;s president, Ralph Tomlinson. Tomlinson was baptized in Plemstall, Cheshire, in 1744; by 1766 he was a lawyer working in London. Tomlinson likely became president of the Society following the death of the previous president, George Bellas, in January 1776. He died in March 1778 at the age of thirty-three.

===Music===

While many early publications of the Song attribute the words to Tomlinson, none name the creator of the music. The identity of the composer was a subject of controversy until the discovery, in the mid-twentieth century, of a passage in a then-unpublished manuscript of &quot;Recollections&quot; written by Richard John Samuel Stevens (1757–1837), a member of the Anacreontic Society. Writing of the year 1777, Stevens recalled:

In this passage, Stevens identified the composer as John Stafford Smith (1750–1836). Smith, the son of the organist of Gloucester Cathedral, was sent at a young age to sing in the Chapel Royal, and thereafter soon established himself in the capital. Like Stevens himself, Smith was a young professional musician active primarily in the chapels and churches of London. Smith was a published composer by 1772, subsequently winning two composition prizes from the London Catch Club in 1773. Both Smith and Stevens were likely among the &quot;honorary members&quot; of the Anacreontic Society who played in its concerts without having to pay the subscription fee; Smith is probably the &quot;leader&quot; identified by Marsh in his recollection of 1773 excerpted above.

Smith outlived both Ralph Tomlinson and the Anacreontic Society by several decades before dying in 1836. During his lifetime, the melody of the Song was set to other texts (most notably the &quot;Defence of Fort McHenry&quot; as discussed below) and became extremely popular. Despite this, Smith does not seem to have been eager to publicize the fact that he had composed the Song. The best evidence we have for a claim of authorship occurs in his &quot;Fifth Book of Canzonets&quot; (1799), which included an arrangement of the Anacreontic Song with the ambiguous notation &quot;harmonized by the Author&quot;.

It remains puzzling why Smith did not make more effort to associate himself with the Song. Until the discovery of Stevens&#x27;s &quot;Recollections&quot;, there was some controversy over whether Smith was in fact the composer. However, no alternative story for the music&#x27;s origins (whether as the work of a different composer or as a pre-existing tune) ever gained a consensus among historians. Lichtenwanger suggests that &quot;[p]erhaps Smith composed the song for Tomlinson for money, for a flat fee, which meant yielding his legal rights in it to Tomlinson or the Society&quot;.

===Date===
The date of the composition of the Song is uncertain. It cannot predate the foundation of the Anacreontic Society (around 1766). Lichtenwanger suggests a composition date as late as 1776; but if the Marsh journal is accurate then the Song must have existed by December 1773. The age of John Stafford Smith may also be of interest; Smith was in his mid-teens in 1766, while by 1773 he was in his early twenties and a published, prize-winning composer.

==Publication==
The lyrics of the song were published in &quot;The Vocal Magazine&quot;, 1778, attributed to &quot;Ralph Tomlinson, Esq.&quot;. The music, along with the words, was published in &quot;The Vocal Enchantress&quot;, a collection published in 1783. There are also various undated publications of the music which likely date to the early 1780s. None of these publications name the composer of the music.

Particular interest attaches to the first Longman &amp; Broderip edition of the music, published between 1777 and 1781. This was likely the first publication of the music and the official edition from which others were copied. Broderip, a partner at the firm, is known to have attended meetings of the Society.

== Lyrics ==
The lyrics are &quot;a good-natured takeoff on a bit of pseudoclassical mythology&quot;. The following is taken from the first Longman and Broderip edition:

;1
:To in Heav&#x27;n, where he sat in full Glee,
:A few Sons of Harmony sent a Petition,
:That he their Inspirer and Patron would be;
:When this answer arriv&#x27;d from the 
:&quot;Voice, Fiddle, and Flute,
:&quot;no longer be mute,
:&quot;I&#x27;ll lend you my Name and inspire you to boot,
:&quot;And, besides I&#x27;ll instruct you, like me, to 
:&quot;The Myrtle of with &#x27;s Vine.&quot;
;2
:The news through immediately flew;
:When pretended to give himself Airs.
:&quot;If these Mortals are suffer&#x27;d their Scheme to ,
:&quot;The Devil a Goddess will stay above Stairs.
:&quot;Hark! already they cry,
:&quot;In transports of Joy,
:&quot;Away to the Sons of we&#x27;ll fly,
:&quot;And there, with good Fellows, we&#x27;ll learn to 
:&quot;The Myrtle of with &#x27;s Vine.
;3
:&quot;The and his nine fusty Maids,
:&quot;From &#x27;s banks will incontinent flee,
:&quot; will boast but of tenantless Shades,
:&quot;And the bi-forked Hill a mere will be
:&quot;My Thunder no fear on&#x27;t,
:&quot;Shall soon do Errand,
:&quot;And dam&#x27;me! I&#x27;ll swinge the Ringleaders, I warrant.
:&quot;I&#x27;ll trim the young Dogs, for thus daring to twine
:&quot;The Myrtle of with &#x27;s Vine.&quot;
;4
: rose up, and said, &quot;Pry&#x27;thee ne&#x27;er quarrel,
:&quot;Good King of the Gods, with my Vot&#x27;ries below:
:&quot;Your Thunder is useless&quot;—then his Laurel,
:Cry&#x27;d &quot;&quot;Sic evitabile fulmen&quot;, you know!
:&quot;Then over each head
:&quot;My Laurels I&#x27;ll spread;
:&quot;So my Sons from your Crackers no Mischief shall dread,
:&quot;Whilst snug in their Club-Room, they jovially twine
:&quot;The Myrtle of with &#x27;s Vine.&quot;
;5
:Next got up with his risible Phiz,
:And swore with he&#x27;d join—
:&quot;The full Tide of Harmony still shall be his,
:&quot;But the Song, and the Catch, and the Laugh shall be mine.
:&quot;Then, , be not jealous
:&quot;Of these honest fellows.&quot;
:Cry&#x27;d , &quot;We relent, since the Truth you now tell us;
:&quot;And swear by , that they long shall 
:&quot;The Myrtle of with &#x27;s Vine.&quot;
;6
:Ye Sons of , then join Hand in Hand;
:Preserve Unanimity, Friendship, and Love!
:&#x27;Tis to support what&#x27;s so happily plann&#x27;d;
:You&#x27;ve the sanction of Gods, and the of .
:While thus we agree,
:Our Toast let it be.
:May our Club flourish happy, united, and free!
:And long may the Sons of 
:The Myrtle of with &#x27;s Vine.

===The earlier version of the lyrics===
In the first known version of the lyrics, as published in &quot;The Vocal&quot; magazine of 1778, there are two significant textual discrepancies from later publications.

* In the second verse, &quot;A fig for Parnassus! To Rowley&#x27;s we&#x27;ll fly;&quot; appears in place of &quot;Away to the Sons of Anacreon we&#x27;ll fly&quot;
* In the third verse, &quot;To the hill of old Lud will incontinent flee,&quot; appears in place of &quot;From Helicon&#x27;s banks will incontinent flee,&quot;

The two replaced lines refer to the Society&#x27;s earlier meeting-place at the London Coffee-House, which was situated on Ludgate Hill and seems to have occupied the same premises as Rowley and Leech, a wine merchant.

==Subsequent history==

The song, through its bawdy lyrics, gained popularity in London and elsewhere beyond the Anacreontic Society. New lyrics were also fashioned for it, including several patriotic titles in the United States. The most popular of these at the time was Robert Treat Paine Jr.&#x27;s &quot;Adams and Liberty&quot; (1798).

===&quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot;===

Francis Scott Key wrote &quot;Defence of Fort McHenry&quot; during the War of 1812, while detained on a British ship during the night of 13 September 1814, as the British forces bombarded the American fort. Key specifically wrote the lyrics with this familiar patriotic tune in mind, just as he had done with an earlier set of his lyrics, &quot;When the Warrior Returns&quot;, in which he had made similar use of &quot;star-spangled banner&quot; imagery in praise of Stephen Decatur. Later retitled &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot;, Key&#x27;s lyrics, set to Stafford Smith&#x27;s music, became a well-known and recognized patriotic song throughout the United States, and was officially designated as the U.S. national anthem on 3 March 1931. The setting of new lyrics to an existing tune is called a contrafactum.

<text>Phillip Jon Plowman (born 1953 in Welwyn Garden City, England) is a British television and film producer. He has been a producer at the BBC since 1980, when he produced Russell Harty&#x27;s chat show &quot;Harty&quot;. He moved on to executive producing at the BBC in 1986, working on sketch show &quot;A Bit of Fry and Laurie&quot;, and became Head of Comedy Entertainment in 1994, mainly responsible for sketch shows. He produced the first four series of the BBC comedy show &quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot; between 1992 and 2001, plus the big screen version in 2016.

==Biography==
Plowman was educated in Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire and at University College, Oxford, where was a member of the University College Players and made friends with others who went on to establish successful careers in comedy. One, Mel Smith, directed Plowman in a production of &quot;Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead&quot;. After Oxford, Plowman followed Smith to the Royal Court Theatre, where he met the director Lindsay Anderson. Plowman worked in theatre for a while, then joined Granada TV.

He was responsible for producing and commissioning programmes produced in-house at the BBC, of which the greatest successes include &quot;The Office&quot; and &quot;French &amp; Saunders&quot;. Plowman became Head of Comedy in October 2005, and oversaw the BBC&#x27;s in-house comedy production, but no longer commissioned programmes. In June 2007, Plowman announced he was quitting his post at the BBC after 27 years. He decided to become a freelance producer for other shows and hoped to carry on his relationship with the BBC, continuing to create programmes &quot;for them and elsewhere.&quot;

In December 2003, &quot;The Observer&quot; named him in its list of the &#x27;50 Funniest or Most Influential People in British Comedy&#x27;. On 14 March 2006, he was honoured with the &#x27;Judges&#x27; Award for Outstanding Contribution to British Television&#x27; at the Royal Television Society awards.

Later he moved into the world of theatre. He co-produced &quot;Lucky You&quot;, the Carl Hiaasen best-seller that premiered as a theatre production at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in 2008.

==Honours==
Plowman was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2013 Birthday Honours for services to British comedy.

<doc id="793635" wikidata="Q731470" url="?curid=793635" title="Eoarchean">
<text>The Eoarchean ( ; also spelled Eoarchaean) is the first era of the Archean Eon of the geologic record. It spans 431 million years, from the end of the Hadean Eon 4031 Mya to the start of the Paleoarchean Era 3600 Mya. 
Some estimates place the beginnings of life on Earth in this era, while others place it earlier. Evidence of archaea and cyanobacteria date to 3500 Mya, comparatively shortly after the Eoarchean. At that time, the atmosphere was without oxygen and the pressure values ranged from 10 to 100 bar (around 10 to 100 times the atmospheric pressure today).

==Chronology==
The Eoarchean Era was formerly officially unnamed and informally referred to as the first part of the &quot;Early Archean&quot; Eon (which is now an obsolete name) alongside the Paleoarchean Era.

The International Commission on Stratigraphy now officially recognizes the Eoarchean Era as the
first part of the Archaean Eon, preceded by the Hadean Eon, during which the Earth is believed to have been essentially molten.

The Eoarchaean&#x27;s lower boundary or starting point of 4.031 Gya (4031 million years ago) is officially recognized by the International Commission on Stratigraphy.

The name comes from two Greek words: &#x27; (dawn) and &#x27; (ancient). The first supercontinent candidate Vaalbara appeared around the end of this period at about .

==Geology==

The beginning of the Eoarchean is characterized by heavy asteroid bombardment within the Inner Solar System: the Late Heavy Bombardment. The largest Eoarchean rock formation is the Isua Greenstone Belt on the south-west coast of Greenland, which dates from 3.8 billion years. The Acasta Gneiss within the Canadian Shield have been dated to be 4,031 Ma and are therefore the oldest preserved rock formations. In 2008, another rock formation was discovered in the Nuvvuagittuq Greenstone Belt in northern Québec, Canada, which has been dated to be . These formations are presently under intense investigation. Oxygen isotope ratios show that the hydrological cycle had begun by the early Eoarchaean and possibly earlier. Carbonate precipitation (caused by heating of sea water by hydrothermal vents) acted as an important sink regulating the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere during this era.

==Atmosphere==
3,850 million years old apatite from Greenland shows evidence of Carbon-12 enrichment. This has sparked a debate whether there might have been photosynthetic life before 3.8 billion years ago.

==Proposed subdivisions==
*Eoarchean Era — 4031–3600 Mya
**Acastan Period — 4031–3810 Mya
**Isuan Period — 3810–3600 Mya

<text>Diego de Deza y Tavera (1444 – 9 June 1523) was a theologian and inquisitor of Spain. He was one of the more notable figures in the Spanish Inquisition, and succeeded Tomás de Torquemada to the post of Grand Inquisitor.

==Early life==
Deza was born in Toro, Zamora and entered the Dominican Order at a young age. He held a number of ecclesiastical posts, and also tutored Prince Juan de Aragón y Castilla, also known as John, Prince of Asturias, the only surviving son of King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella.

He was fundamental in granting navigator Christopher Columbus access to Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand.

After first serving as Bishop of Zamora (1487–1494), Bishop of Salamanca (1494–1498), Bishop of Jaén (1498–1500), and Bishop of Palencia (February 1500 – 1504), he became Archbishop of Seville in 1505. Deza was commissioned as Grand Inquisitor for Castile, León, and Granada on 24 November 1498. On 1 September of the following year, his authority was expanded to cover the whole of Spain.

==The Inquisition==
Deza was the successor to Tomás de Torquemada, perhaps the most famous of all inquisitors. Like Torquemada, Deza had a particular dislike of &quot;conversos&quot; – Jews or Muslims who had converted to Christianity but who were often accused of secretly retaining their original faith.

It is reported that shortly after his arrival to Palencia, he managed, on 25 April 1500, to baptize all the &quot;moriscos&quot; established there. As the 25 April was St Mark&#x27;s day according to the calendar, the then-named &quot;Morería&quot; street has since been known as &quot;San Marcos&quot; street. He was commissioned as Archbishop of Seville on 30 October 1504. But, after the death a few days later of Queen Isabella I of Castile, he had to attend urgent meetings with the other two attorneys of the dead queen, King Consort Ferdinand II of Aragon and Cardinal Francisco Ximenez de Cisneros.

Arriving in Seville in October 1505, just one year after his appointment, Deza prepared to perform the same conversions to Christianity as he had &quot;achieved&quot; five years earlier in Palencia. With the help of Martín de Ullate, &quot;numerous&quot; Sevillian Muslims and Jews were thus converted no later than the end of 1505. He also held the inquisitorial enquiries on the new Archbishopric of Granada, conquered in 1492 with truces about respecting the private religious beliefs of Granada Muslims soon to be ignored.

Like Torquemada, Deza was accused of being overzealous in his work, and of showing excessive cruelty – his reputation was sufficient that in 1507, the Pope was forced to publicly request moderation. Accusations were also made that Deza used his position to enrich himself, confiscating the wealth of accused heretics for himself. A complaint about Deza, made to the royal secretary by Captain Gonzalo de Ayora (Ayora being a valuable Valencia town with numerous &quot;moriscos&quot; since before the 13th century), said that Deza and his lieutenants &quot;have no regard either for God or for justice; they kill, steal, and dishonor girls and women to the disgrace of the Christian religion.&quot;

==Downfall==

Deza himself was later accused of secretly practising Judaism, a charge mainly based on the fact that he himself had Jewish blood on his mother&#x27;s side. The accusation was probably political, but nevertheless damaged his standing somewhat. His position was further undermined by several open insurrections against the Inquisition, particularly against his chief lieutenant Diego Rodriguez Lucero. Lucero intensely disliked the &quot;false converted&quot;, and in 1500 handled papers sent to Pope Julius II on the Archbishop of Granada&#x27;s (Hernando de Talavera) Jewish ancestry.

Lucero, the Inquisitor of Córdoba, was more hated than Deza, and in late 1506, had narrowly escaped with his life when an angry mob stormed the Inquisition&#x27;s base in Cordoba and freed all its prisoners. Pope Julius II seems to have had a moderating influence on Deza and Lucero&#x27;s researches.

After King Ferdinand II of Aragon remarried, he decided that Deza had become a liability, and Deza was forced to resign in 1507. Hernando de Talavera would die also in 1507 without knowing the whereabouts of his process in Rome.

In 1517 Diego de Deza founded in Seville the &quot;Colegio de Santo Tomás&quot;, 15 years after Rodrigo Fernández de Santaella, who had founded the Colegio de Santa María de Jesus, initial nucleus of the modern University of Seville.

==Death==
It is likely that Diego de Deza could have returned to his inquisitorial office, because it is known that he was named Archbishop of Toledo (and thus Primate of Spain), but was not able to take up the position due to illness. He died on 9 June 1523.

His tomb in his College of Santo Tomas was opened by Napoleonic troops in 1810 with the aim of stealing his rings, collars and golden paraphernalia. The college, later a Spanish Government military establishment within the Seville Regiments, being visited frequently by the wife of a High Military local boss, aroused an interest in the empty tombstone sarcophagus. She thought it would be useful to set up a bath to look after her beauty.

==Episcopal success==
While bishop, he was the principal consecrator of:
*Alonso Manso, Bishop of Puerto Rico (1512);
*Pedro Suárez de Deza, Bishop of Concepción de la Vega (1512);
*Juan de Quevedo Villegas, Bishop of Santa María de La Antigua del Darién (1514);
and the principal co-consecrator of:
*Pascual Rebenga de Ampudia, Bishop of Burgos (1497).

=== Confidentiality breach on the Special Force soldier letter ===
On 11 March 2022, a special force soldier wrote a letter to President Tsai Ing-wen reporting the insufficient basic logistic supply which has compelled the combatants to purchase from outsider suppliers at their own expense for two years, then being disqualified as non-standard upon inspection, in contrast of the reserve trainees receiving new sets; and appealed to abolish the mandatory diary writing for examination. The classified &quot;2022006470&quot; paper was taken photo illegally from the presidential palace and leaked to the media with his identity exposed on 18 March; hence Minister of National Defense Chiu Kuo-cheng reacted: &quot;I will not let him get away with it&quot;, &quot;Fix the crying baby!&quot;; but later clarified while being questioned by the parliament members in the Legislative Yuan, that he just disgusts the coward behavior behind his back, and the critique unfair to the preparatory staff. The incident raised the broad society concern on the standard operating procedure practice on the data security breach in the presidential office.

<doc id="793667" wikidata="Q642121" url="?curid=793667" title="Relocation service">
<text>Relocation services, employee relocation, military [[permanent change of station]] (PCS) or workforce mobility include a range of internal business processes to transfer employees, their families, and/or entire departments of a business to a new location. Like other types of employee benefits, these processes are usually administered by human resources specialists within a corporation. In the military, these processes are administered by the Transportation Management Office (TMO) and Personal Property Shipping Office (PPSO).

Such business processes can include domestic residential services where an employee moves within a country or state as well as international relocation services which include planning for diplomats, managers, etc. working abroad. An agency providing relocation services directs and manages the process of relocation including arranging necessary documents (visa, long-term stay permissions), finding a new house (accommodation), finding a school for children (education), finding a job for the partner or &quot;trailing spouse&quot;, arranging a teacher for the family (language training) and introduce expatriates to the local culture.

==International relocations==
Dating back to the Dutch East India Company, sending an employee to work in another country (sometimes called a &quot;global assignment&quot; in current HR jargon) has carried considerable costs while theoretically opening the potential for financial returns for the employer.

With tax equalization, housing allowance, cost-of-living adjustment, and other benefits, the typical expatriate compensation package is two to three times the home-country base salary. For example, an expatriate with a €100,000 annual salary will cost the employer €200,000-300,000 per year incl. the relocation costs. Shorter term assignments have lower costs, especially when they avoid taxation thresholds.

Reasons why a company might give an employee a global assignment include filling functional needs, developing the employee for upper management, and developing the company itself. Anne-Wil Harzing of the University of Melbourne further categorizes these employees as &quot;bears,
bumblebees and spiders&quot;. Those playing the role of bears are the long arm of headquarters control.
The bumblebees transfer (cross-pollinate) their corporate culture. Harzing&#x27;s spiders weave the
informal communication networks so important in connecting far-flung branches, subsidiaries and
all strategic partners.

Responding to a 2005 survey of global assignment management practices commissioned by a US-based third-party relocation management company, 31 percent of surveyed employers indicated that they track exceptions on a per-assignment basis for budgetary purposes, 23 percent track exception on an overall basis in order to identify policy components that need review, and 39 percent do not track the cost or type of exceptions granted. (Seven percent were not able to answer the question.)

Depending on the size and organization of a company, different departments, such as finance or human resources, may administer the relocation program. Some may lack any formal programs while others have highly structured processes. Moreover, different operating units may administer different aspects of the program.

Some may manage and execute all of their relocation processes in-house while others outsource them. This is done to save time, focusing internal resources on company workforce strengths, or for providing better service to each transferee.

Of the companies participating in the 2005 Survey of Global Assignment Management Practices, 43 percent indicated that they either outsource or co-source some assignment management services (staffing 1:58 assignees, 7 percent declined to answer).

<doc id="793681" wikidata="Q5092793" url="?curid=793681" title="Cheryl Wheeler">
<text>Cheryl Wheeler (born July 10, 1951) is a Massachusetts-based singer-songwriter of contemporary folk music. She has recorded thirteen folk albums to date and has toured extensively throughout the United States since the mid-1970s.

Heralded as a “folk luminary,” an “unassuming folk star,” and a “folk diva,” Wheeler is known for her well-crafted songs, stellar vocals, and witty on-stage patter. &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; wrote: “Over decades, she’s built a cult following through Boston radio and the New England folk circuit for her uncanny ability, not unlike Tom Rush, to have her audience laughing during one song and silently tearing up with the next.” “If Wheeler never picked up an instrument, she could have easily become a comedian,” said another reviewer. “Fortunately for us, she does both. Because, after the jokes, stories and self-deprecating comments have people rolling in the aisles, she starts singing and her voice is spellbinding.”

== Early life ==
Born and raised in Timonium, Maryland, Wheeler began playing ukulele and guitar in middle school and writing songs in high school, making up melodies to go with the poems in “The Golden Book of Poetry,” a children&#x27;s book. Wheeler completed two years of community college and then transferred to Coker College in South Carolina. She quit in early 1972. “I didn’t quit thinking: Do I embark on a folk music career?” she said. “I quit because I was in 15th grade, and enough was enough already.”

Not long after leaving college, Wheeler was hired at a steakhouse as a waitress. “Within a week, the owners and me, we realized we made a terrible mistake,” she said. “I could never be a waitress. But they needed [a musician], and I thought maybe I could do that, and they were relieved to get me out of waitressing.&quot; Around the same time, Wheeler began performing at clubs in the Washington, D.C., and Baltimore area.

== Career ==
In 1976, Wheeler moved to Providence, Rhode Island, and began playing at folk clubs throughout New England, opening for artists such as Jonathan Edwards, Tom Rush, Jesse Winchester, and Gordon Lightfoot. Her big break came when Edwards asked her to audition for a spot in his band as a bass player. Wheeler didn&#x27;t play bass, but she bought one and auditioned nonetheless. “To my complete astonishment, I got the gig,&quot; Wheeler recalled. &quot;But I knew I didn&#x27;t get it for my bass playing. So I thought I must&#x27;ve got it for my singing. So that was a real shot in the arm because I hadn&#x27;t thought about it before, but I thought I might actually be a good singer if Jonathan Edwards is hiring me.&quot;

In 1983, Wheeler released her first album, a four-song EP called &quot;Newport Songs&quot;, which is now out of print. Her next two releases – a self-titled album in 1986 and &quot;Half a Book&quot; in 1987 – were produced by North Star Records in Providence. The song “Addicted,” from the self-titled album, was recorded by country singer Dan Seals and became a No. 1 hit for him in 1988 on Billboard&#x27;s Top 40 Country chart.

Following the success of her first two full-length albums, Wheeler was signed to Capitol Records and released &quot;Circles and Arrows&quot; in 1990. Suzy Bogguss recorded Wheeler&#x27;s song “Aces” from this album, and it reached #9 on the country charts in 1992. Wheeler&#x27;s next four albums – &quot;Driving Home&quot; (1993), &quot;Mrs. Pinocci&#x27;s Guitar&quot; (1995), &quot;Sylvia Hotel&quot; (1999), and &quot;Defying Gravity&quot; (2005) – were produced by the folk-oriented Philo-Rounder Records in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

In 2003, Wheeler approved the production of a double disc album, &quot;No Previous Record&quot;, which contains songs that never made it onto a commercial recording. Distribution of the album is free, but restricted to members of her e-mail list.

Wheeler&#x27;s two most-recent albums – &quot;Pointing at the Sun&quot; (2009) and &quot;Cheryl Wheeler Live&quot; (2012) – were released by her own record label, Dias Records.

Wheeler&#x27;s songs have been covered by a number of other artists in addition to Dan Seals and Suzy Bogguss. They include Kathy Mattea, Sylvia, Garth Brooks, Peter, Paul, and Mary, Bette Midler, Kenny Loggins, Melanie, Holly Near, and D.C. Anderson. Wheeler has said she doesn&#x27;t purposefully write for other people, but she appreciates when others cover her songs. “[It’s] great. I make money if they do well,” she said. “But more than that, it&#x27;s wonderful to have a singer you respect singing your song.&quot;

Her song &quot;If It Were Up to Me&quot; (which was written shortly after the 1998 Westside Middle School shooting), with the closing line &quot;If it were up to me, I&#x27;d take away the guns&quot; got nationwide attention shortly after the Columbine High School massacre. Wheeler released the recording into the public domain to exempt radio stations from paying royalties (it was being played every hour near the high school), and Rounder Records ran a promotional campaign to donate money to the Brady Campaign each time the song was played on Adult Album Alternative radio stations.

In 2014, Wheeler was inducted into the Rhode Island Music Hall of Fame.

==Performances==
Wheeler has toured extensively throughout her career, and her live concerts include both comedic and serious commentary in addition to the songs themselves. As one reviewer wrote, she “masterfully blends blisteringly on-target observational humor, simple storytelling, gorgeous guitar work, and beautiful, rich songs.” Another commented on her “free-wheeling live concerts” and called Wheeler a “thoughtful, amusing musician and storyteller (and irrepressible social critic)…. [H]er patter is a delicious, folk-flavored blend of Phyllis Diller and Mort Sahl, sometimes puckish, sometimes barbed.”

About half of the songs Wheeler performs in concert are not available on any of her albums. Many never get recorded and eventually fade from her set list. Although she mostly tours alone, she has also toured with Kenny White (who produced a number of her albums). White generally opens for her and then plays and sings harmony during Wheeler&#x27;s set. Wheeler has also toured with the Christine Lavin-inspired tour &quot;On a Winter&#x27;s Night&quot; and occasionally as part of Lavin&#x27;s consortium Four Bitchin&#x27; Babes.

Wheeler participated in a concert with fellow folk singer-songwriters Shawn Colvin and Mary Chapin Carpenter in 1988, the year before Colvin released her debut album. The three performed on two consecutive nights, to critical acclaim, at The Birchmere in Alexandria, Virginia. The two performances were recorded at the soundboard and although never released officially, have been favorites among fans of the three artists.

== Personal life ==
Wheeler is openly lesbian. She and her wife, Cathleen, live in Swansea, Massachusetts. They were married in 2004, ten days after Massachusetts made same-sex marriage legal.

In October 2022, her management announced that her forthcoming concerts were cancelled due to hospitalization for mental health challenges.

She returned to performing in 2023.

<doc id="793703" wikidata="Q3430687" url="?curid=793703" title="Anthony A. Williams">
<text>Anthony Allen Williams (born Anthony Stephen Eggleton; July 28, 1951) is an American politician who was the mayor of the District of Columbia, for two terms, from 1999 to 2007. Williams had previously served as chief financial officer for the district, managing to balance the budget and achieve a surplus within two years of appointment. He held a variety of executive posts in cities and states around the country prior to his service in the D.C. government. Since 2012, he has served as chief executive officer/executive director of the Federal City Council. 

==Early life, education and military service==
Williams, born Anthony Stephen Eggleton in Los Angeles on July 28, 1951, was adopted at age three by Virginia and Lewis Williams (a postal worker), who raised him and seven other children in their home: Lewis IV, Virginia II, Carla, Cynthia, Leif Eric I, Kimberly, and Loris. Williams grew up in the West Adams area of Los Angeles. He later attended Loyola High School in Los Angeles, and then Santa Clara University. There he became active in the anti-Vietnam War movement as well as President of his sophomore class. But his academics suffered and he eventually left school.

Shortly thereafter he joined the Air Force. He volunteered for Vietnam, but was kept in the country to work as an aide in the 354th Tactical Fighter Wing command post. He sought an appointment to the United States Air Force Academy but was instead sent to the academy&#x27;s preparatory school because of his poor grades at Santa Clara. He excelled and earned an appointment to the academy. Instead Williams sought to leave the Air Force as a conscientious objector, and was given an honorable discharge in 1974. After that, he worked giving piano and clay sculpture and other tactile art lessons to blind children and counseling Vietnam War veterans in Los Angeles. In 1975, he enrolled at Yale using his veteran&#x27;s benefits to help pay the bill. He left school to start a map business that failed and returned in 1979. In 1982, he graduated &quot;magna cum laude&quot; with a Bachelor of Arts in Political Science from Yale College, where he was a member of the literary society St. Anthony Hall. In 1987, he earned a J.D. from Harvard Law School and a Master of Public Policy from the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University.

==Career==
Williams served as the Deputy State Comptroller of Connecticut. Williams also served as executive director of the Community Development Agency in St. Louis, Missouri; assistant director of the Boston (MA) Redevelopment Authority; and adjunct professor at Columbia University.

Williams was appointed by President Bill Clinton and confirmed by the United States Senate to serve as the first CFO for the US Department of Agriculture, as well as a founder and Vice Chairman of the U.S. CFO Council.

===Politics===
Williams first ran for office while a student at Yale in 1979 when he was elected to the New Haven, Connecticut, Board of Aldermen. He served until 1982 and during that time served as President Pro-Tempore.

Williams first rose to prominence in Washington, D.C., as the District of Columbia&#x27;s Chief Financial Officer (CFO) during the final term of Mayor Marion Barry, who nominated Williams to the position in September 1995. By that time, however, Washington was in the midst of a fiscal crisis of such proportion that Congress had established a financial control board charged with oversight and management of the District&#x27;s finances. The same legislation had created the position of Chief Financial Officer, which had direct control over day-to-day financial operations of each city agency, and independence from the mayor&#x27;s office; while Barry had the authority to appoint Williams, only the Control Board had the authority to fire him. This gave Williams an unusual level of political strength in dealings with the mayor, with whom he had a number of very public battles; Williams, who had the support of the Control Board as well as Congress, tended to win these battles, even gaining power in 1996 to hire and fire all budget-related city staffers. Given this political clout, Williams began steering D.C.&#x27;s finances toward financial recovery, moving from a $355 million deficit at the end of 1995 to a $185 million surplus in the city&#x27;s fiscal year 1997.

Williams&#x27; financial successes in the District made him a popular figure. In January 1998, local media reported that Williams was considering a run for mayor in that year&#x27;s election; he quickly dismissed the notion, but a &quot;Draft Anthony Williams&quot; movement began building nonetheless. When Barry declined to seek a fifth term as mayor in the spring of 1998, Williams finally entered the race, resigning as CFO to campaign. Williams instantly assumed frontrunner status in the race, and in September won the D.C. Democratic primary with 50% of the vote in a six-person race, then won the November 3 general election by a 2–1 margin despite not having held any elected office since 1982. Upon his election, the Control Board announced that it would begin ceding back to Williams much of the executive authority it had stripped of the mayor&#x27;s office during Barry&#x27;s tenure.

====Mayor first term====

During his first term he restored the city to the financial black, running budget surpluses every year and allowing the control board to terminate itself two years ahead of schedule. He brought some $40 billion of investment to the city. Unprecedented capital investments and service improvements also came to some disadvantaged neighborhoods under Williams&#x27; administration. Controversially, Williams accepted the resignation of aide David Howard, a former Williams campaign worker who handled citizen complaints for the mayor’s office, for using the word &quot;niggardly&quot;.

By 2001, real property values were climbing steadily and Washington, D.C., was experiencing a real estate investment boom in the residential, commercial and retail markets. Congress dissolved the Financial Control Board in September 2001. In 2002 the Association of Foreign Investors in Real Estate (AFIRE) named Washington, D.C., the top global and U.S. city for real estate investment. (It made the top slot again in 2003 and 2004.)

Williams also alienated some lower-income residents. His first term in office was marked by the beginning of a period of gentrification throughout the city. Longtime residents complained of being priced out of their homes and neighborhoods and forced to move to neighboring Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland. In addition, one of Williams&#x27; budget-trimming measures was the closure of inpatient services at D.C. General Hospital, the only public hospital in the District. The D.C. Council voted down Williams&#x27; proposed closure in the spring of 2001, but their decision was overturned by the Control Board soon afterwards.

====Mayor second term====

In 2002, Williams ran for re-election and stumbled into a political scandal. The firm which he hired to collect signatures to put his name on the Democratic Primary ballot had irregularities with hundreds of names on the petitions. As a result of the irregular petitions, the Williams campaign was fined $277,700 by the District of Columbia Board of Elections and Ethics and his name was removed from the Democratic Primary ballot. He was forced to run as a write-in candidate. His chief opponent, minister Willie Wilson, also ran as a write-in candidate. Despite this handicap, Williams won both the Democratic and Republican primaries as a write-in candidate and went on to be re-elected in the general election.

During his second term, Williams continued his record of stabilizing the finances of the District. The city was able to balance its budget for ten consecutive years between the 1997 and 2006 fiscal years; the cumulative fund balance swung from a deficit of $518 million in the 1996 fiscal year to a surplus of nearly $1.6 billion in the 2005 fiscal year. During this same period, the District&#x27;s bond ratings went from &quot;junk bond&quot; status to &quot;A&quot; category by all three major rating agencies.

Williams was instrumental in arranging a deal to move the financially ailing Montréal Expos, a Major League Baseball (MLB) team, to Washington, D.C. Although he faced opposition from much of the D.C. Council, Williams eventually prevailed. In late December 2004, the Council approved by one vote a financing plan for a new stadium. The new team, the Washington Nationals, began playing in April 2005, the first time since 1971 that the nation&#x27;s capital had its own MLB team.

While in office, Williams was elected president of the National League of Cities in December 2004. In January 2005, he was elected Vice Chair of the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments (COG).

Williams was not without detractors. His international traveling was criticized, as was his failure to purchase a home in D.C., despite his aggressive publicity campaign to convince residents to buy homes in the city. Some of his constituents and members of the D.C. Council (including his successor, Adrian M. Fenty) criticized Williams&#x27; deal with Major League Baseball for conceding too much and not providing a spending cap on the public financing of the new baseball park.

Williams was the first sitting mayor of Washington since 1973 to participate in a Presidential funeral in 2004, when he spoke at Ronald Reagan&#x27;s funeral, held at Washington National Cathedral. His final speech as mayor would also come at the Cathedral in 2006.

On September 28, 2005, Williams announced he would not seek re-election in 2006. Williams endorsed Council Chair Linda W. Cropp as a successor; however, Cropp lost to Ward 4 Councilmember Adrian Fenty in the Democratic primary. Fenty went on to win the general election.

===Career after politics===
In 2018, Williams was campaign co-chair for S. Kathryn Allen, a former insurance executive seeking an at-large seat on the Council held by Elissa Silverman. An investigation determined that more than half of Allen&#x27;s signatures were fraudulently collected and her name was not included on the ballot. Williams did not comment publicly about the incident.

==Legacy and honors==

Williams was generally seen as a moderate; he had good relations with Congress and the White House, business and labor, and the community and region. Unlike many Democrats, he said he was &quot;open&quot; to Sam Brownback&#x27;s proposal to implement a flat tax in D.C., and he supported school vouchers. His public persona is that of an intellectual bureaucrat, especially when compared to the colorful Barry. He is known for his signature bow tie.

In 1997, &quot;Governing Magazine&quot; named him &quot;Public Official of the Year&quot;.

Driven by a growth in local revenues, income and sales taxes, Williams managed District resources to improve services, lower tax rates, improve the performance of city agencies and invest in infrastructure and human services. This dramatic turnaround required transformational improvements in cash management, budget execution, and revenue collections. After many years of declining population, the District has had a steady growth in population. In its July 2004 issue, &quot;Black Enterprise&quot; magazine selected Washington, D.C., as the second-best city in the country for African Americans to live and work in because of its housing, jobs, health care and economic development.

Under Williams&#x27; administration, the District&#x27;s crime rate dropped dramatically. By the end of his tenure, hotels reported 2% vacancy rates. Real estate values in the District remained high despite regional and national trends in the opposite direction.

On the eve of Williams&#x27; last day in office in 2006, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; columnist Colbert I. King wrote,

Williams leaves in his wake a city with a good bond rating, sizable cash reserves, a more accessible health-care system for the underserved, several promising neighborhood projects, a major league baseball team, a new stadium under construction and a home town that is no longer the laughingstock of the nation ... On his watch, the District underwent its most profound transformation in generations. Williams promoted an investment climate that led to the sprucing up of a city that had gone to seed.

Williams is credited with laying the foundations for continued improvement by the city. His final day in office coincided with the Washington funeral of Gerald Ford.

==Personal life==
In 1999, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Gene Weingarten interviewed Williams and wrote a feature article titled &quot;A Funny Thing About the Mayor ... He&#x27;s Funny&quot; published in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; Style Section. In October 2016, after bumping into Williams when both men were called for jury duty, Weingarten wrote in an online chat that Williams &quot;had shown a side of himself absolutely no one knew, a sense of humor so shrewd and adroit he was way ahead of me the whole time.&quot; He went on to describe Williams as &quot;an incredibly, organically, wryly funny man who has turned self deprecation into an art form. He also believes deeply in civic responsibility.&quot;

In January 2007, Williams entered into a partnership with the Washington-area investment bank Friedman Billings Ramsey Group, Inc. to form Primum Public Realty Trust, a real estate investment trust (REIT) focused on buying and leasing back government and not-for-profit real estate. In 2009 Williams announced he was stepping down as CEO and that Primum would be dissolved. He joined D.C. law firm Arent Fox on May 14, 2009, as Director of State and Local Practice, assisting governments and municipalities with securing stimulus money and managing their budgets.

Williams has also been actively involved in local education initiatives, including serving on the boards of the nonprofit organizations D.C. Children First and the national nonprofit Alliance for School Choice.

In March 2008, Williams made headlines by purchasing a home in D.C., a condominium on the city&#x27;s revitalizing H Street NE corridor.

Williams served as a member of the Debt Reduction Task Force at the Bipartisan Policy Center. In 2012, Williams joined the board of directors of the Bank of Georgetown.

In April 2012, Williams was appointed the chief executive officer/executive director of the Federal City Council. The private organization, founded in 1954, is a group of business, civic, educational, and other leaders interested in promoting economic development and livability in Washington, D.C. It is considered one of the most influential groups in the city.

Williams is Catholic.

<doc id="793705" wikidata="Q7426667" url="?curid=793705" title="Saturday Night Fry">
<text>Saturday Night Fry is a six-part comedy series on BBC Radio 4 that was broadcast between 30 April and 4 June 1988. The first episode had previously been broadcast as a pilot on 19 December 1987.

A different show of the same name aired on BBC Radio 4 in 1998, again hosted by Fry. This was a series of serious 45-minute debates interspersed with occasional sketches and pieces of music.

== Format ==

Hosted by Stephen Fry—accompanied each week by a selection of guests including Jim Broadbent, Emma Thompson, Phyllida Law, Robert Bathurst, Julia Hills, Alison Steadman and long-time collaborator Hugh Laurie—the show took the form of a round table discussion and sketches which veered tangentially from the sublime to the ridiculous. Parodies of television and radio formats were common (&#x27;Fat Man on a Bicycle&#x27;, and so on).

Snippets of classical music were used to mark breaks between items, usually succeeded by Fry&#x27;s voice saying, &quot;And as the strains of the [name of piece] fade away, we turn to...&quot; On one occasion, in line with a running joke throughout the episode, the last of these in the show was said as &quot; And as the strains of Julia being slapped fades away...&quot;

Certain editions were constructed in complex knots: one edition saw the cast rearranging the script as a practical joke whilst Fry has gone to the toilet, ending up in him reading the part where they do that and so finding them red-handed, whilst the first edition fell in and out of dream sequences caused by a devilish potion.

Although slightly different in format the series could be seen as a direct precursor to &quot;A Bit of Fry and Laurie&quot;, the 1989 television series (piloted in 1987), which employed a very similar style of humour and wordplay: it included the fictional language &quot;Strom&quot;, and the phrase &quot;Mr. Music, will you play?&quot;.

The signature tune opening each episode was &quot;Saturday Night Fish Fry&quot; by Louis Jordan. This would always be preceded by a rather convoluted introduction from Fry.

== Release ==

In 2009, the series was released on a triple compact disc set by BBC Audio in June and reaired the following month on BBC Radio 7.

<doc id="793718" wikidata="Q795383" url="?curid=793718" title="BACnet">
<text>BACnet is a communication protocol for building automation and control (BAC) networks that use the ASHRAE, ANSI, and ISO 16484-5 standards protocol.

BACnet was designed to allow communication of building automation and control systems for applications such as heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning control (HVAC), lighting control, access control, and fire detection systems and their associated equipment. The BACnet protocol provides mechanisms for computerized building automation devices to exchange information, regardless of the particular building service they perform.

==History==
The development of the BACnet protocol began in June, 1987, in Nashville, Tennessee, at the inaugural meeting of the ASHRAE BACnet committee, known at that time as SPC 135P, &quot;EMCS Message Protocol&quot;. The committee worked at reaching consensus using working groups to divide up the task of creating a standard. The working groups focused on specific areas and provided information and recommendations to the main committee. The first three working groups were the Data Type and Attribute Working Group, Primitive Data Format Working Group, and the Application Services Working Group.

BACnet became ASHRAE/ANSI Standard 135 in 1995, and ISO 16484-5 in 2003. The Method of Test for Conformance to BACnet was published in 2003 as BSR/ASHRAE Standard 135.1. BACnet is under continuous maintenance by the ASHRAE Standing Standard Project Committee 135.

BACnet had an almost immediate impact on the HVAC controls industry. In 1996 Alerton announced a BACnet product line for HVAC controls, from the operator&#x27;s workstation to small variable air volume (VAV) controllers. Automated Logic Corporation and Delta Controls soon followed suit. On July 12, 2017, BACnet reached a milestone with the issuance of the 1000th Vendor ID. Vendor IDs are assigned by ASHRAE and are distributed internationally. Those vendor identifiers can be viewed at the BACnet website .

H. Michael (Mike) Newman, Manager of the Computer Section of the Utilities and Energy Management Department at Cornell University, served as the BACnet committee chairman until June, 2000, when he was succeeded by his vice-chair of 13 years, Steven (Steve) Bushby from NIST.

During Steve Bushby&#x27;s four-year term as committee chair the BACnet standard was republished twice, in 2001 and 2004, each time with new capabilities added to the standard. The 2001 version featured, among other things, extensions to support fire / life-safety systems.

In June, 2004, 17 years after the first BACnet meeting and back in Nashville, William (Bill) Swan (a.k.a. &quot;BACnet Bill&quot;) from Alerton began his four-year stint as committee chair. During his term the number of committee working groups grew to 11, pursuing areas such as support for lighting, access control, energy utility/building integration, and wireless communications.

In January 2006 the BACnet Manufacturers Association and the BACnet Interest Group of North America combined their operation in a new organization called BACnet International .

In June 2008, in Salt Lake City, Dave Robin from Automated Logic Corporation took over the reins as the new committee chair after serving 4 years as vice chair. During Dave&#x27;s term, 22 addenda were published for the 135-2008 standard and republished as . Several addenda were published for 135-2010 and the standard was republished as .

In June 2012, in San Antonio, Carl Neilson from Delta Controls took over the reins as the new committee chair after serving 4 years as vice chair. During Carl&#x27;s term, 12 addenda were published for the 135-2012 standard and it was republished as . Carl stepped down as chair in June 2015.

In June 2015, Bernhard Isler, from Siemens, became chair after serving 3 years as vice chair and 4 years as secretary. During Bernhard&#x27;s term, 10 addenda were published for the 135-2016 standard. Once addenda to 135.1-2013 was also published. Bernhard stepped down as chair in June 2018.

In June 2018, Michael Osborne from Reliable Controls, became chair after serving 3 years as secretary and 3 years as vice chair.

==Protocol overview==
The BACnet protocol defines a number of services that are used to communicate between building devices. The protocol services include Who-Is, I-Am, Who-Has, I-Have, which are used for Device and Object discovery. Services such as Read-Property and Write-Property are used for data sharing. As of ANSI/ASHRAE , the BACnet protocol defines 60 object types that are acted upon by the services.

The BACnet protocol defines a number of data link and physical layers, including ARCNET, Ethernet, BACnet/IP, BACnet/IPv6, BACnet/MSTP, point-to-point over RS-232, multidrop serial bus with token passing over RS-485, Zigbee, and LonTalk.

==BACnet testing==
BACnet Testing Laboratories (&quot;BTL&quot;) was established by BACnet International to test products to BACnet standards and support compliance testing and interoperability testing activities and consists of BTL Manager and the BTL working group (&quot;BTL-WG&quot;).
The general activities of the BTL are:
*Publishing the BTL Implementation Guidelines document
*Certifying the products per BACnet testing and BTL guidelines
*Supporting the activities of the BTL-WG
*Maintaining the BTL test packages
*Approving Testing Laboratories for BTL Testing
The BTL also provides testing services through BACnet Laboratories. The BTL Managers and BTL working groups of BACnet International administer the test Laboratories. All BTL-recognized BACnet Test Organizations are ISO 17025 accredited.

In January, 2017, a new BTL certification program was announced. Under this program, the work of the BTL and WSPCert (the European BACnet certification body) is merged. This merger forms a single point of testing for both the BTL Mark and the Certificate of Conformance.

<text>Download Festival is a rock festival created by Andy Copping, held annually at the Donington Park motorsport circuit in Leicestershire, England (since 2003); in Paris, France (since 2016); at Parramatta Park, Sydney (since 2019); Flemington Racecourse in Melbourne (since 2018) and at the Hockenheimring in Baden-Württemberg, Germany (since 2022).

Download at Donington is the most popular and has hosted some of the biggest names, including Iron Maiden, Black Sabbath, Slipknot, Metallica, Linkin Park, Korn, Soundgarden, Motörhead, Aerosmith, AC/DC, Def Leppard, Kiss, Judas Priest, Rammstein, Status Quo, Mötley Crüe, My Chemical Romance, ZZ Top, Whitesnake, Faith No More, Guns N&#x27; Roses, and Fall Out Boy.

== History ==
The Download Festival was conceived as a follow-up to the Monsters of Rock festivals which had been held at the Donington Park circuit between 1980 and 1996. The first Download Festival was created by Stuart Galbraith and co-booked by Andy Copping in 2003 in the same location. Download was initially a two-day event, expanding to three days in 2005.

The name Download was chosen for the festival for two reasons. Downloading was a dirty word in the music industry at the time, due to file sharing, and rock is seen as a rebellious genre of music. Also Download was to be a Monsters of Rock for the 21st century and the internet would provide connectivity with its audience.

The 2003 festival tickets had a code on them, which would allow festival goers to download tracks from bands which had played. Although this idea has been dropped in subsequent years, the festival organisers have nurtured an online community through the Download Festival Forums. Initially a sounding board for the fans (and critics) of the festival, the boards have become an integral part of the festival organisation with regular contributions from festival director John Probyn and promoter Andy Copping. The forums also provide face to face feedback through the Fan Forum meetings (started in 2006) and organise the Boardie BBQ (2006 on) and the Boardie Takeover night (2009), football tournaments and a pub quiz for the R.I.P. campers who arrive on a Wednesday night.

When Download began, it took place on the Donington Park circuit infield as had Monsters of Rock. However, in 2008 developments for Formula One meant that the infield was no longer suitable as a festival site. The festival moved to the &quot;Sunday Markets&quot; site to the west of the circuit. Although adequate, numbers were limited and the location of the campsite meant that getting from tents to the arena was quite a hike. 2009 saw the arena move to a much more suitable location to the south of the circuit and has remained there every year since. In 2019 the capacity was 111,000.
Security for the festival has constantly been undertaken by professional crowd management specialists Specialized Security, although the campsite area has had various contractors throughout.

From 2009 to 2019 and returning in 2021, there has been on-site radio broadcasting from Rock Radio on 87.7FM. This RSL broadcast has aired music from festival bands, interviews and news to the festival site and the surrounding area, with the signal reaching as far as Nottingham.

=== The &quot;Download Dog&quot; ===
The Download Dog is the official mascot of the Download Festival and appears on a wide range of material related to the festival, such as tickets, stage banners, merchandise, marketing, and the official Download website.

==Overview==
Notes:
*DLTV (Download TV) was an online virtual festival that took place on the same days the 2020 Download Festival was due to take place, the event show clips of live performances and interviews from past years and was shown on the Download Festival Youtube and Facebook pages. 
* Download TV returned in 2021 renamed Download Reloaded celebrating the best headliners from the past 10 years, the event was filmed at the Download site in Donington and will be shown on Sky Arts over two nights during 4–5 June.
* The original 2021 event was cancelled due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, however it was announced on 26 May 2021 that Download would take place in 2021 as part in the UK government events research programme to trial large events. The three-day pilot event will have 10,000 fans attending.

== 2003 ==
The first Download was held on 31 May – 1 June 2003. The original headliners were Iron Maiden and Limp Bizkit, although the latter pulled out and were replaced by Audioslave. Metallica attempted to step in as headliners, but were unable to do so, owing to headlining that year&#x27;s Reading and Leeds Festivals. Instead, having performed an exclusive club show in London the night before, they played an unannounced &quot;secret slot&quot; in the afternoon on the second stage, with no soundcheck. &quot;Sunday belonged to Metallica,&quot; wrote Mick Middles in &quot;Classic Rock&quot;. &quot;At 3.15 the band were fired into the heart of the festival. Before me, a nonplussed, earplugged infant was held aloft. Somehow it seemed historical. Debuting selections from &quot;St. Anger&quot;, Metallica swept into a 90-minute frenzy so irresistible that even the Hells Angels were seen clapping in wholehearted appreciation at the end. The coup was complete.&quot;

Chevelle were scheduled to play the Scuzz stage on Sunday but pulled out at the last minute. Instruction, playing their second set of the festival, stepped in as the replacements.

== 2004 ==
===Donington===
The 2004 edition of the festival was held on 5–6 June. Another stage was added to the festival, bringing the total to three. Seventy-two bands played over the two days. The 2004 event was also notable for several last minute hitches. First, SOiL got lost on the way to Donington and missed their main stage appearance on Saturday (they later joined Drowning Pool on stage to perform Drowning Pool&#x27;s &quot;Bodies&quot; and their own song &quot;Halo&quot;). Static-X missed their slot due to a bus breakdown. On Sunday, Slayer arrived on time, but their equipment did not, leading to a slot change from the middle of the afternoon on the main stage to a later slot (and longer set) on the second stage. Slayer were replaced on the main stage by Damageplan, who were scheduled to play the second stage. Their setlist ended with a rendition of Damageplan founders Vinnie Paul and Dimebag Darrell&#x27;s most recognisable song from Pantera, &quot;Walk.&quot;

The biggest news came from the headliners Metallica, when Lars Ulrich was rushed to hospital. Taking to the stage an hour and a half late, James Hetfield explained the situation with Ulrich and the show then began with Slayer drummer Dave Lombardo playing on &quot;Battery&quot; and &quot;The Four Horsemen.&quot; Slipknot&#x27;s Joey Jordison played the rest of the set apart from Fade to Black which was played by Metallica&#x27;s drum technician, Flemming Larsen.

The full line-up included:


===Scotland===

In June 2004 a two-day Download Festival was held on Glasgow Green, several days before the Donington event. This had a limited line up with only nine bands performing over a two-day period. The bands which did play included the headliners, Metallica and Linkin Park. Download Scotland also saw an appearance from the Welsh rock band Lostprophets who did not perform at Donington.

Acts which also appeared over the two days at Download Scotland were Korn, Slipknot, Iggy and the Stooges, Machine Head, the Distillers and HIM.

The running order went as follows:
== 2005 ==


Download 2005 was held again at Donington Park, on 10–12 June 2005. This festival was different from previous years as the Saturday was officially dubbed Ozzfest 2005, as well as an &quot;Indie day&quot; on the first day of the festival.

Billy Idol performed on the Snickers stage on the Friday night, his first UK gig after a lengthy hiatus, performing songs such as White Wedding, Rebel Yell and a cover version of Van Halen&#x27;s anthem, Jump.

Feeder&#x27;s frontman Grant Nicholas was so relieved the band had won the crowd over (there were concerns that they would be received badly by the traditional attendees to the festival), he decided to smash his green Fender Jazzmaster guitar after &quot;Descend&quot; was performed. He later said that he regretted it, but also said he kept the neck and the tremeloes, and might use what was left to make a new guitar. In a July 2010 interview with Kerrang!, it was suggested to Nicholas that he destroyed the guitar as he was frustrated at trying to win the crowd over, as their music was different from the Download demographic, but claimed himself in reply to this that he &quot;Wanted to do the most rock and roll thing after eventually winning over the crowd&quot;. In the same interview, Nicholas said that they were &quot;guinea pigs&quot; at the festival as part of the organisers experiment to make it an alternative festival, but said it was a moment of the band&#x27;s career he is still proud of.

Lemmy also took to the stage, with former MC5 members, and Gilby Clarke, to perform Back in the USA.

Initially, Bert McCracken of the Used and Gerard Way of My Chemical Romance were asked to perform their cover of Under Pressure by Queen and David Bowie, but the former friends refused the offer to perform the cover as they had recently fallen out.

The official line-up included:



== 2006 ==


The 2006 Download Festival was held at Donington Park, England on 9–11 June. The headlining acts (Tool, Metallica and Guns N&#x27; Roses) have sales of approximately 200–250 million albums between them, more than the entire line up of 2006&#x27;s V Festival.

2006 was the first time the festival was mirrored in the Republic of Ireland, as Download Festival Ireland.
2006 was also by far the warmest year Download has ever had.

During the festival Korn vocalist Jonathan Davis was rushed to hospital. Similar to 2004&#x27;s Metallica set, Munky, Fieldy and David Silveria arrived and explained to the fans why Davis could not make it and played with guest vocalists Corey Taylor from Slipknot, Dez Fafara from DevilDriver, Jesse Hasek from 10 Years, Benji Webbe from Skindred, M. Shadows from Avenged Sevenfold, and Matt Heafy from Trivium. Lyrics from the song &quot;Blind&quot; were displayed on the screen for Matt Heafy. Metallica played the album &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; in its entirety in honour of its twentieth anniversary. Guns N&#x27; Roses also performed material from the long forthcoming &quot;Chinese Democracy&quot; album.

Main Stage
The main stage was situated in the centre of the arena with crowd control moving around it, and was the largest of all three stages, the safety barriers used at this stage were in a T shape so as to avoid crowd crush in the middle. The stage was open-air and named in honour of the 25th anniversary of &quot;Kerrang!&quot; magazine. Down played an unannounced set on Saturday (With the laminates showing ??? in their time slot); opening up the Main Stage.

Snickers Stage
The Snickers Stage was situated in a tent, behind the main stage and was the second largest stage at the festival. Access to the stage was via a one-way system which attempted to spread people around the site, rather than all attempting to push through a rather small space.

Soilwork were scheduled to play on Sunday, but were replaced by DevilDriver (playing their second set of the festival).

Gibson/Myspace Stage
The Myspace stage was the smallest of the three and under a smaller tent. It was positioned across from the front of the main stage.



=== Controversy ===
During the Sunday headline set of Guns N&#x27; Roses, bottles were thrown at the band. This caused problems after the band&#x27;s lead singer, Axl Rose, slipped on the wet surface and a bottle hit bassist Tommy Stinson. Stinson threw his bass, hitting one of the cameramen, and left the stage. He returned after the song and apologised, but warned the crowd that if this activity continued, he would leave for good. There were some disturbances but they eventually died down, and later in the set Rose commented &quot;I&#x27;m actually having quite a good time now! I couldn&#x27;t have said that an hour ago!&quot;

On the final night, fires were started by some festival goers and police were called, arresting twelve people. At around 4 am, the fire brigade arrived to put out a large fire at the gold campsite. A number of people had taken the railings that had been used to separate the campsite area from the path and used them to barricade the road to prevent the fire engines from reaching the main fire. At this point a number of police assembled in riot gear stormed the campsite. The festival director, John Probyn, posted a message on the official website stating that &quot;About 150 people spoiled the end of what had been a great weekend for over 75,000 of us.&quot;

== 2007 ==


The 2007 Download Festival took place on 8–10 June 2007.

The three bands that headlined the 2007 festival were My Chemical Romance, Linkin Park and Iron Maiden. Korn&#x27;s Jonathan Davis stated that the reason for the band returning in 2007 was because of his absence due to illness the previous year. He stated on the official Download Festival website, &quot;I am so looking forward to coming to the Download Festival this year. I was heartbroken to pull out last time. So this time I am very happy to be coming back and we promise to rock the place! I will definitely make-up for missing the last one. You can expect an amazing Korn show!&quot;

Download 2007 was Dimmu Borgir&#x27;s first ever festival appearance in England. Hardcore Superstar pulled out of their slot on the Tuborg stage on the Sunday because their tour bus broke down in Germany. Download 2007 featured an Indian band Parikrama. They became the first band from India to make it to Donington.

Download 2007 also featured the first band to officially perform on the Thursday of the festival. Scumface played on the Tuborg Stage during the boardie barbecue.

Lamb of God&#x27;s DVD &quot;Walk With Me in Hell&quot; features the band&#x27;s full performance at the festival.


== 2008 ==

The 2008 festival took place on 13–15 June. It had a significantly different layout to previous years: the arena area was situated in land to the west of the race track instead of the traditional race track infield area. Among numerous changes, the second stage became larger and moved from a marquee to open-air, on a tarmac car park.

&quot;I am looking forward to humiliating those little boys in little bands who think they count,&quot; declared Gene Simmons of Kiss. &quot;We&#x27;re going to blow their shit to pieces... If U2 or Radiohead are on the bill at Download, then I accept these are good bands. But they will still run for cover when Kiss take the stage, for they are in the presence of a transcendent rock force.&quot;

Chris Cornell was scheduled, but cancelled his European tour to focus on a new album. Twin Method, and Finger Eleven were announced but removed from the official website&#x27;s lineup. On the Friday of the festival, Kid Rock was meant to appear between Seether and Disturbed on the Main Stage but pulled out at the last minute. At first it was announced that this was due to illness. Rock later claimed he left the festival grounds after becoming dissatisfied with the amenities. But, the following year, Download&#x27;s booker theorised that it had been due to a broken heart. Rock&#x27;s no-show allowed two bands following him, Disturbed and Judas Priest, to play longer sets.

The 2008 Boardie BBQ took place on the Gibson stage on Thursday 12 June and included a performance by Forever Never.


== 2009 ==

The 2009 Download Festival took place on 12–14 June at Donington Park with an estimated attendance of 120,000 over 3 days. The arena had once again changed location, this time to an open field area south of the race track which was more suitable and a shorter walking distance from the camping areas than last year.

The headliners were Faith No More (Friday), Slipknot (Saturday) and Def Leppard (Sunday). Sunday had a strong classic rock themed line-up on the main stage with bands such as Whitesnake, ZZ Top and Journey, somewhat reminiscent of Monsters of Rock. This would become a recurring feature in future years. Other notable performers included Limp Bizkit, who were playing in the UK with their original line-up for the first time since 2001, Trivium returning for their third appearance and first head lining spot, Anvil, the band featured in the 2008 film &quot;Anvil! The Story of Anvil&quot;, and Steel Panther, who were making their first appearance in the UK on the Tuborg Stage. A fourth stage, the &quot;Red Bull Bedroom Jam Stage&quot;, also made an appearance at this year&#x27;s festival. This stage was also present at other UK festivals, such as T in the Park in Balado, Scotland, and the Underage Festival in Victoria Park, London.

The 2009 Boardie BBQ took place in the Red Bull Bedroom Jam Stage on Thursday 11 June. This year the band was Attica Rage.

The Thursday night of the 2009 festival also saw the Boardie Takeover night. Four bands, three DJ&#x27;s: Cyst, Dave KC and Gabber Fox, solo singers Hevs and TonsO&#x27;Fun, a stand-up and a burlesque dancer – all members of the Download Festival Forums – performed to a full house in the End Tent. These bands were Scumface (returning after a successful appearance at the Boardie BBQ in 2007), Orestea, Echovirus and headliners, Silent Descent.

On Monday 18 May the festival confirmed on its official website that Camping tickets had completely sold out.

On 19 May, it was revealed in an interview with Andy Copping on Music Channel Scuzz that there would be secret sets. It was later revealed the bands would be Enter Shikari and Thunder.

On Wednesday 3 June, one week before the campsite opened, Download released a further 2,500 camping tickets. These limited tickets sold out within 24 hours of being released.

The winners of the &quot;Red Bull Bedroom Jam Competition&quot; was Gravesend-based band After the Ordeal. This set was a &#x27;virtual gig&#x27;, with the band playing live from their bedroom and this footage being streamed live onto the Main Stage at Download Festival, between Pendulum and Marilyn Manson.

The winners of the &quot;Tuborg Battle of the bands&quot; was Leeds punk band Acid Drop and they opened the Tuborg stage on Saturday 13 June.

The Ghost of a Thousand were scheduled to headline the Red Bull Bedroom Jam Stage on Saturday but the band cancelled. the Blackout stepped in to play their slot, thus giving them two slots on the festival&#x27;s bill.

Slipknot&#x27;s performance is available in their new DVD (sic)nesses. It was released on 28 September 2010 and served as a tribute to their late bassist Paul Gray. It was Gray&#x27;s last UK gig with Slipknot before his death in May 2010.



== 2010 ==

The Download Festival was confirmed to return to Donington on the weekend 11–13 June 2010, the campsites opening on 9 June. On 25 January, nine bands were announced at the official Download website, including AC/DC as one of the main stage headliners. On 15 February Rage Against the Machine and Aerosmith were confirmed as the other two main stage headliners, as well as 5 more bands confirmed a few hours later.

Saxon performed their &#x27;Wheels of Steel&#x27; album in its entirety to commemorate its 30th anniversary. Download 2010 was also the 30th anniversary of rock festivals at Donington Park, since the first one – which Saxon performed at – in 1980.

It was announced on 16 May that the second stage would be renamed &quot;The Ronnie James Dio Stage&quot; in tribute to the singer who died of stomach cancer on the same day. It was also announced that the main stage would be called the Maurice Jones Stage after the co-founder of Monsters of Rock who also died the previous year.

28 May saw 15 more bands added, and an official announcement of the Jägermeister-sponsored fifth stage, which would host acoustic acts, including bands also performing regular sets at the festival. The initially announced Sum 41 cancelled, owing to drummer Steve Jocz being involved in an accident. On 30 May 2010 it was announced that Wolfmother had to cancel due to illness. They were replaced by Killswitch Engage.

Aside from Dio, the year was sadly memorable for other deaths. Y&amp;T performed the Pepsi Max Stage to a jam-packed audience, marking the band&#x27;s long-anticipated return to Donington after performing at Monsters of Rock in 1984. Download would be bassist Phil Kennemore&#x27;s last UK show in the UK: he died from lung cancer six months later. Killing For Company drummer Stuart Cable, previously of Stereophonics, died the week of the festival, at which the band were to play.

Ratt were scheduled to play on Sunday, but cancelled due to illness of vocalist Stephen Pearcy. On 9 June, FM were announced as Ratt&#x27;s replacement.

The Boardie Takeover ran for the second year in a row on Thursday 10 June. It featured the bands Silent Descent, Fallen Fate, Jacknife Holiday and Cyster Scalpel, as well as singers, DJs and a burlesque dancer.

AC/DC played on an exclusive stage next to the Maurice Jones stage, allowing the band to utilise their full stadium show, as announced on 28 May. This marked the first time a headlining band brought their own stage to Donington. All headlining bands on the other stages had finished before AC/DC began. The stage was used only by AC/DC; the next day, the runway at the front was dismantled and the stage remained empty. &quot;I took my son to see AC/DC...&quot; recalled Saxon&#x27;s Biff Byford. &quot;Watching Angus from out in the crowd was great, and it was a rite of passage for my son.&quot;

The final day saw torrential rain. &quot;By the time Aerosmith take the stage,&quot; noted &quot;Classic Rock&quot;, &quot;we&#x27;re essentially one amorphous mud blob of an organism blinking through the mire towards the bright lights. They, on the other hand, have Steven Tyler, a man whose dress sense... makes Lady Gaga look like a vicar&#x27;s wife.&quot;



== 2011 ==


The Download Festival was confirmed to return to Donington on the 10, 11, and 12 June 2011. Linkin Park and System of a Down were the two main stage headliners officially announced, with Saturday subheadliners Avenged Sevenfold and Sunday second stage headliner Rob Zombie announced a short while later.

On 22 February, Def Leppard were announced as Friday&#x27;s main stage headliner, with Twisted Sister, Down, Duff McKagan&#x27;s Loaded and Trash Talk also added to the line-up.

15 March saw the Darkness unveiled as the widely speculated Friday subheadliner, with Funeral for a Friend, Plain White T&#x27;s, Framing Hanley and Hyro Da Hero also added. In April, the Red Bull Bedroom Jam stage and Jägermeister Acoustic stage&#x27;s acts were revealed.

Wayne Static was scheduled to open up the main stage on the Sunday, but he pulled out a month prior. Masters of Reality were scheduled to perform but pulled out on 30 March and Karma to Burn were to play the second stage on Sunday but were replaced by Hyro Da Hero, thus giving him three sets over the course of the festival; the most in Download history.

Steward 0836 was manning the main stage at the festival, when he caught the attention of fans waiting for Sunday&#x27;s bands to appear. Some friendly interaction led to cheers from the audience, then one of the giant stage-screens showed him making the &quot;devil horns&quot; gesture, which was applauded by tens of thousands of rock fans. The official Download Festival website even featured him as an artist on their site.



== 2012 ==

On 12 July 2011 it was confirmed via Twitter, and the Download official website that the festival would be staged in 2012 between 8–10 June. Limited early-bird tickets were put on sale on 15 July. It was announced on 10 November via BBC Radio 1 that Metallica would headline the main stage on the Saturday and also that they would be playing their self titled album in its entirety. The next day Black Sabbath were announced to headline the main stage on Sunday 10 June, closing the festival. On 18 November, the Prodigy was announced as the headliner for Friday 8 June.

On 12 April 2012, Download Festival announced on their website, official Facebook page and official Twitter page that the main stage will be named after Jim Marshall who died a week earlier.

Due to the wet and windy conditions on the site, there was a delay in opening the arena on the Friday, resulting in the cancellation/postponement of certain performers.

American heavy metal band Machine Head reportedly broke the festival record for the most circle pits happening during one song, with a reported 29 pits happening at once.

Comedian Bob Slayer, who is a regular on the comedy stage at Download, broke his neck doing a wheelie bin crowd surf stunt whilst entertaining at the festival.

The line-up won an award in the 2012 UK Festival Awards, and festival director John Probyn won a &quot;Lifetime achievement award&quot;.



===Cancellations===

Five Finger Death Punch were scheduled to perform on Sunday on the Main Stage between DevilDriver and Kyuss Lives! but on 5 April they pulled out due to logistical difficulties. Anthrax, who were initially set to play on the Zippo Encore Stage, were brought up to the main stage (later dubbed the Jim Marshall stage) due to Five Finger Death Punch&#x27;s cancellation.

T. Mills was scheduled to perform on Saturday on the Red Bull stage but pulled out in May and also Porter Robinson, who was also set to play on the same stage on the Friday pulled out due to the recording of a new album. He was replaced by Voodoo Six.

===Problems===

Due to the wet and windy weather, Download did not open its Arena gates on Friday 8 June until 14:00 whilst laying down straw in the Arena and removing potentially dangerous signs and banners which could prove hazardous in high winds, meaning some of the bands were shifted around. Cancer Bats were moved from second opening band on the Jim Marshall Stage to a headline slot on the Red Bull Bedroom Jam Stage, with Rise to Remain and Six Hour Sundown missing out on a slot entirely. Fear Factory were also given an additional 10 minutes of performance time due Cancer Bats being relocated to a different stage and Rise to Remain being cancelled. Europe were scheduled to play the Zippo Encore stage on Friday before Little Angels, but it was announced at the last minute that they will not be able to perform due to traffic and transportation issues. Much criticism was aimed at the organisers for not preparing better as the poor weather occurred before the festival goers arrived. Also the conditions in the camping and arena meant that many fans who required disabled access were left stuck in the mud requiring help from their fellow fans to reach their destination, or even the toilets, often with little to no help from organisers.

== 2013 ==
The eleventh annual Download festival was confirmed for 14–16 June 2013. Early bird tickets went on sale 15 June 2012, where a newly implemented deposit scheme was introduced; which allowed customers to pay for their ticket(s) over three payments rather than one. Iron Maiden were announced as the Saturday headliner on 20 September 2012 to commemorate 25 Years since first appearing and headlining Monsters of Rock in 1988 on Seventh Tour of a Seventh Tour . Rammstein let slip on the same day that they will be headlining Download on the Sunday, which was confirmed by the festival organisers the following morning. Seven days later it was confirmed via Andy Copping (festival promoter) that Slipknot would be the Friday headliner. From 5 November, bands started to be announced sporadically via Facebook, Scuzz TV, BBC Radio 1, Kerrang! Magazine and the personal Twitter account of Andy Copping.

Goldsboro were due to be playing at the festival, but on 19 February they confirmed they would not be able to perform. After the Burial were scheduled to perform on the Red Bull Studios stage, but pulled out on 17 May in order to focus on their new album.

On 28 May, Skin and Red, White &amp; Blues cancelled their appearances at the festival. Both acts were to perform twice over the weekend, on the Zippo Encore and Jägermeister Acoustic stages. On 3 June, Andy Copping confirmed that Buckcherry would be pulling out of the festival and that they would be replaced by Black Star Riders.



== 2014 ==
The twelfth annual festival was held 13–15 June 2014. Earlybird tickets went on sale 21 June 2013. Between 4–6 November, all three main stage headliners were confirmed, along with all the sub-headliners. Linkin Park performed their debut album, &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; album in its entirety.

Reactions to Avenged Sevenfold being announced as headliners were very mixed. After a Facebook user suggested that Dying Fetus headline the festival instead, a social media trend titled #WhyNotDyingFetus was started as a joke. However, this actually led to the band being booked to play, although not in a headline slot, and they were officially confirmed on 6 November.

To commemorate its 20th anniversary, the Offspring performed their third studio album, &quot;Smash&quot;, in its entirety. Also, their appearance marked the first time in Download history that a previous main stage headliner returned to play a lower slot (though Limp Bizkit, who were originally scheduled to headline the festival in 2003 would return in 2009 to play a lower slot).

Andy Copping confirmed via Twitter that there would be a Secret Set on the Pepsi Max Stage on the Sunday, performing in the time slot in between Crazy Town and Memphis May Fire. This transpired to be Black Stone Cherry.

On 23 May, the Main stage was renamed the Stephen Sutton stage after Stephen Sutton who died on 14 May.

The Boardie Takeover returned on Thursday 12 June and featured four bands and 2 DJs. The bands playing the Takeover are: Last Edition, Scumface, Dumbjaw &amp; Incinery.

Joe Bonamassa was originally booked to play on the Zippo Encore Stage Saturday before Status Quo but he was moved to the Sunday Main Stage due to a double booking. Trivium were initially confirmed to be headlining the Red Bull Studios Live stage on the Sunday, but following a generally negative response from fans due to the size and limited capacity of the tent, the band was moved to Zippo Encore Stage headliner.

In Flames were scheduled to sub-headline the Zippo Encore stage on Sunday, but they were quietly removed from the line-up poster on 26 February. It was later revealed that they had cancelled all of their Summer shows to finish recording their new album. On 22 March the latest announcement was leaked by &quot;Classic Rock Magazine&quot;. Shortly after the leak, Defeater, who were scheduled to play on the Pepsi Max Stage Sunday, were confirmed to have pulled out due to their lead singer, Derek Archambault, suffering an injury and having to undergo hip replacement surgery. Danger Danger were originally confirmed, but pulled out on 7 April, claiming that bookings had been erroneously made for various dates. September Mourning were confirmed for the Pepsi Max Stage on the Friday but were removed from the lineup on 2 May (as they wished to focus on getting their sophomore album completed), they were replaced by I Am Fire. Cage the Gods also pulled out on 2 May. King 810 pulled out the day before they were due to play because their lead vocalist and bassist were arrested. Upon a Burning Body were scheduled to appear on the Pepsi Max stage on Saturday, but were forced to pull out because singer Danny Leal was taken seriously ill with an inner ear infection that meant doctors would not clear him to fly to the UK.

The unknown band &#x27;Iceman Thesis&#x27; were subtly added to the lineup poster in the buildup to the event.

<text>Jerri Lin Nielsen ( Cahill; March 1, 1952 – June 23, 2009) was an American physician with extensive emergency room experience, who self-treated her breast cancer while stationed at Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station in Antarctica until she could be evacuated safely.

In 1998, during the southern winter, at a time when the station is physically cut off from the rest of the world, she developed breast cancer. Nielsen teleconferenced with medical personnel in the United States and had to operate on herself in order to extract tissue samples for analysis. A military plane was later dispatched to the pole to airdrop equipment and medications. Her condition remained life-threatening, and the first plane to land at the station in the spring was sent several weeks earlier than planned, despite adverse weather conditions, to take her to the U.S. as soon as possible. Her ordeal attracted a great amount of attention from the media, and Nielsen later wrote an autobiographical book recounting her story.
The cancer went into remission, but recurred seven years later, eventually causing her death in 2009 from brain metastatic disease, eleven years after initial diagnosis.

==Early life and education==
Born as Jerri Lin Cahill in Salem, Ohio on March 1, 1952, a suburb of Youngstown, Ohio, Nielsen was the oldest child and only daughter of Philip and Lorine Cahill, who raised their family in a rural area just outside Salem. She graduated pre-med from Ohio University in Athens before entering the Medical College of Ohio in Toledo and graduating with a medical degree.

While at Ohio University she also met Jay Nielsen, whom she subsequently married. They had three children before divorcing in 1998. She continued to work as a physician in various medical fields, mostly as an ER surgeon.

==Antarctic stay==

In 1998, Nielsen was hired for a one-year contract to serve as the medical doctor at the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station on Antarctica. This isolated region experiences almost total darkness for the six months of winter, during which the temperature remains around −60 °C (−76 °F). During this period, the station is completely cut off from the world, as no planes fly there between mid-February and late October. The &quot;winterover&quot; crew is thus stranded and entirely autonomous.

In the course of her work at the research station, Nielsen discovered a lump in her breast. After consulting US physicians via e-mail and video conference, she performed a biopsy upon herself. The results were, however, inconclusive, because the material used on site was too outdated to allow for a precise diagnosis.

The National Science Foundation decided to send a military plane to airdrop supplies and medication for her treatment. Such airdrops had been a yearly event several years earlier, when the station was run by the US Navy, but had later been stopped. The plane did not attempt a landing because its skis would risk sticking to the ice and its fuel and hydraulic lines would rapidly freeze, dooming the craft. South Pole workers lit fires in barrels in the Antarctic night to mark out a drop zone. An Air Force C-141 cargo plane, staged out of Christchurch, overflew the Pole in the darkness and sent six bundles of supplies and medical equipment parachuting toward the station on July 11.

Using the parachuted supplies, Nielsen began her treatment, following the advice of her doctors over the satellite link. She first began a hormone treatment. She trained her South Pole colleagues to form a small team that could assist her in the procedures. A new biopsy performed with the airdropped equipment allowed better scans to be sent to the US, where it was confirmed that the cells were indeed cancerous. With the help of her makeshift medical team, Nielsen then began self-administering chemotherapy.

In October, an LC-130 Hercules was sent several weeks ahead of schedule, despite the risks inherent to flying in such cold weather, to bring Nielsen back home as soon as possible; the plane took off from the base on October 15. Another crew member, who had suffered a hip injury during the winter, was also evacuated.

==After returning to the United States==
Once back in the United States, after multiple surgeries, complications and a mastectomy, Nielsen went into remission. She became a motivational speaker and a scholarship was created in her honor; she also remarried, to Tom Fitzgerald. In 2001, Nielsen was named Irish American of the Year by &quot;Irish America&quot; magazine.

==Metastasis==
After being in remission, the cancer returned in 2005 and metastasized to Nielsen&#x27;s brain, liver and bones, but she continued to give speeches and traveled extensively including to Hong Kong, Vietnam, Australia, Ireland, Alaska, Poland, and she returned to Antarctica several times. In October 2008, Dr. Nielsen announced that her cancer had returned in the form of a brain tumor. She was active and giving talks until March 2009, three months before her death.

She died at her home in Southwick, Massachusetts on June 23, 2009, at age 57. She was survived by her second husband, Tom Fitzgerald; her parents, Lorine and Phil Cahill; her brothers, Scott Cahill and Eric Cahill; and her children from her previous marriage: Julia, Ben and Alex.

==Media depictions==
With ghostwriter Maryanne Vollers, Nielsen&#x27;s story was told in the autobiographical &quot;Ice Bound: A Doctor&#x27;s Incredible Story of Survival at the South Pole&quot;, which became a &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller. The book was later adapted into &quot;Ice Bound: A Woman&#x27;s Survival at the South Pole&quot;, a 2003 CBS-TV movie starring Susan Sarandon, and in 2008 became the inspiration for an episode of Fox Network show &quot;House&quot;, &quot;Frozen&quot;, in which the team must somehow, via teleconference, diagnose and treat a stricken psychiatrist at the South Pole. The story of her rescue was featured on The Weather Channel&#x27;s &quot;When Weather Changed History&quot; in the &quot;Rescue from the South Pole&quot; in January 2008.

Nielsen&#x27;s case shares some similarities with that of Dr. Leonid Rogozov, who had to remove his own appendix while spending the winter at Novolazarevskaya research station in 1961. Since this incident, that station has always been staffed with two doctors.

<text>Bingley Five-Rise Locks is a staircase lock on the Leeds and Liverpool Canal at Bingley (). As the name implies, a boat passing through the lock is lifted or lowered in five stages.

==Description==

In effect the five-rise consists of five locks connected without intermediate &quot;ponds&quot;: the lower gate of each chamber forms the upper gate of the chamber below. There are therefore five chambers, and six gates. As the Leeds Liverpool canal is a wide canal, the chambers are slightly more than wide, and each gate consists of two half-gates, &quot;hinged&quot; from opposite sides of the canal. Each half gate is slightly more than wide, so that the two halves close in a &quot;V&quot; shape (pointing &quot;upstream&quot;). Water pressure on the uphill side of the gate keeps it tightly closed until the water levels on either side are equal, when the gate can be opened and the boat moved to the next chamber (see canal locks for more information on how a lock is constructed and operated).

The five-rise is the steepest flight of locks in the UK, with a gradient of about 1:5 (a rise of over a distance of ). The intermediate and bottom gates are the tallest in the country. Because of the complications of working a staircase lock and because so many boaters (both first-time hirers and new owners) are inexperienced, a full-time lock keeper is employed and the locks are padlocked out of hours. Barry Whitelock, the lock keeper, worked here for almost 30 years, becoming closely associated with the flight. Barry was awarded an MBE in the 2007 New Year Honours List for &quot;Services to Inland Waterways in the North&quot; and retired in 2017 as the country&#x27;s longest-serving lock keeper. The locks also have an overflow &#x27;by-wash&#x27; at the side, which water runs down when the lock is not open. When a descending boat enters each lock chamber the water level rises slightly and the excess flows via an overflow channel at the side which runs into the main by-wash.

The structure is Grade I listed.

==History==

The five-rise opened on 21 March 1774 and was a major feat of engineering at the time. When the locks and therefore the canal from Gargrave to Thackley was opened in 1774, a crowd of 30,000 people turned out to celebrate. The first boat to use the locks took just 28 minutes. The first trip was described in the &quot;Leeds Intelligencer&quot;. The smaller Bingley Three Rise Locks opened at the same time just a few hundred yards downstream.

==Tourism==

The staircase is a tourist attraction in the area. Boats that pass through often attract a crowd of gongoozlers.

==Maintenance==

The staircase underwent extensive restoration in 2004 and again in 2006, when the lock gates and paddles were replaced. As is expected with such a feat of engineering it requires a lot of maintenance and is often on British Waterways&#x27; list of winter stoppages for maintenance.

In January 2012 the locks were drained to allow the installation of new lock gates. The new gates are made of English green oak and, taken together with the balance beam, weigh more than 5 tonnes.

<text>Ercole (Hercules) Dembowski (12 January 1812 – 19 January 1881) was an Italian astronomer.

==Biography==
Dembowski was born in Milan. He inherited the title of &quot;Baron&quot; as the son of Jan Dembowski (Dębowski), one of Napoleon&#x27;s Polish generals. He served in the navy of Austria-Hungary until 1843 when he retired for health reasons to Naples.

He was a tireless observer of double stars and made tens of thousands of micrometer measurements. In particular, he remeasured many double stars from Friedrich Struve&#x27;s &quot;Dorpat Catalogue&quot;, noting how some of them had changed position over the years due to their mutual orbit as binary stars.

He won the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1878.

The crater Dembowski on the Moon is named after him, as well as the main belt asteroid 349 Dembowska.

<doc id="793769" wikidata="Q4860550" url="?curid=793769" title="Bargate stone">
<text>Bargate stone is a highly durable form of sandstone. It owes its yellow, butter or honey colouring to a high iron content. In some contexts it may be considered to be a form of ironstone. However, in the context of stone buildings local to the extraction of Bargate Stone, the term &#x27;ironstone&#x27; is often used to refer to a darker stone, also extracted from the Greensand, which rusts to a brown colour.

==Sources==
This stone was quarried for centuries in the Bargate Member of the Greensand Ridge, particularly where it is widest in south west Surrey, England. It occurs near the surface and was quarried in the hillsides near Godalming. Medieval quarries are still visible in Godalming, at the foot of Holloway Hill.

Bargate stone is rare in current use due to its short supply. Bath stone, Yorkstone and other similar coloured stone is sometimes used as alternatives, or to complement it.

==Petrography==
Bargate stone is typically a mix of sandy bioclastic limestone and bioclastic sandstone. The intergranular cements comprise ferroan carbonate.

==Use==
Bargate Stone is found in many buildings in Surrey, approximately 250 of which are listed, and in two churches in London. It is endemic to older buildings near the Greensand Ridge where it is found.
Its 20th-century use tended towards coursed use of Bargate sandstone with bricks, or concrete, sometimes with ashlar dressings or mortar rendering.

===Examples===

<doc id="793790" wikidata="Q7055995" url="?curid=793790" title="North Loop, Minneapolis">
<text>The North Loop is a neighborhood in the Central community of Minneapolis.

Commonly referred to as The Warehouse District, the neighborhood was Minneapolis&#x27;s main commercial district during the city&#x27;s years as a midwestern shipping hub. Although only a little commercial shipping is still done in the neighborhood, the historic warehouses still dominate the neighborhood. Some of these buildings have been repurposed into restaurants, shops, and apartments.

The neighborhood features the Minneapolis Warehouse Historic District, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

== Geography ==
The North Loop is located northwest of the central business district between downtown Minneapolis and the Mississippi River. Streets in the North Loop are oriented to be parallel to the river, which means that they run at a 45-degree angle relative to the grid of the rest of the city. It is split between Wards 3 and 5 of the Minneapolis City Council, currently represented by Michael Rainville and Jeremiah Ellison respectively.

Although the neighborhood technically extends further to the south, the main residential and commercial area of the North Loop is roughly a rectangle bounded by the railroad tracks as Cedar Lake Trail (in the southeast), Plymouth Avenue (in the northwest), the elevated 4th street freeway entrance/exit in the southwest, and the Mississippi River in the northeast. Washington Avenue is the main thoroughfare through the neighborhood.

The James I. Rice Park, which is in the northeast portion of the neighborhood along the river, is popular with residents during the summer months. The bike trail and West River Parkway that runs through the park are part of the Grand Rounds Scenic Byway. The park added a playground in 2010 located where 4th Ave North intersects with West River Parkway.

==History==
For most of its history, the North Loop was an industrial area. It was home to a large railroad yard and numerous warehouses and factories. Much of the warehouse district (very roughly bounded by Second Street North, First Avenue North, Sixth Street North, and the BNSF Railway tracks, except for the Interstate 394 and Interstate 94 ramps) is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

The warehouses that characterize the district are mostly six to eight stories high, and about 62 structures on seven square blocks contribute to the district. The predominant form of design is the Chicago Commercial style, but many other styles were built, including Italianate, Queen Anne style, Richardsonian Romanesque, Classical Revival, and early 20th century commercial styles. The warehouse district was in turn associated with the railroad transportation network that was under development at the time, which connected Minneapolis with the rest of the Midwest and the rest of the country. These warehouses were used for wholesale and storage of goods related to milling and manufacturing. The nomination for the National Register of Historic Places states that the district, as a whole, comprises a cohesive district of buildings with a common physical appearance, as well as a common age and original use.

In the 1980s, the Warehouse district was the epicenter of the Minneapolis art scene until the area&#x27;s buildings became more commercially desirable in the 1990s. At its peak, the Wyman Building, 400 First Avenue North, was home to more than twenty contemporary art galleries. No Name Gallery was formerly located in the eastern part of the neighborhood, before it moved out of the district and became the Soap Factory .

==Today==

While some industrial tenants remain (particularly in the area southwest of 4th Street), many of the old factories and warehouses have been converted to commercial space or loft condominiums and apartments. The area still retains some feel of its industrial past, as many newer buildings have attempted to replicate the style of the old warehouses. The Hennepin Energy Recovery Center opened in 1989 as a waste-to-energy plant and Metro Transit has two bus garages nearby including the North Loop Bus Garage which opened in 2023.

Since the mid-1990s, when the gentrification of the neighborhood accelerated, thousands of people have moved into the North Loop. The neighborhood is particularly popular with people who work in downtown Minneapolis, whose proximity allows residents to walk, bike, or take a short bus or METRO ride to work. Coffee shops, restaurants, bars, art galleries, and small retail stores have also moved into the neighborhood in recent years.

The Tony Award-winning Theatre de la Jeune Lune (Closed and building sold) and the Traffic Zone Center for Visual Art, a prominent artist cooperative and gallery space, are located in the eastern part of the neighborhood. The largest employer is the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, which is located at the southwest end of the Hennepin Avenue Bridge.

In 2005, the North Loop Neighborhood Association launched a re-branding project led by committee members Lisa Goldson Armstrong and Marybeth George. With the design talents from agency Little &amp; Co, they launched a new logo and style guide for the North Loop which supported the neighborhood transformation.

In September 2006, the North Loop Neighborhood Association received funding to build a dog park for North Loop residents. A temporary dog park has been built on N 3rd St and N 7th Ave.

Target Field, home of the Minnesota Twins, opened in 2010, is on the southwest edge of the neighborhood. Plans call for the construction of condominiums and apartments for several thousand new residents near the stadium. The area is also served by Target Field Station, the terminus for the Northstar Commuter Rail, Metro Transit Blue and Green Lines, and future light rail lines.

<doc id="793798" wikidata="Q2983872" url="?curid=793798" title="Royal Military College Saint-Jean">
<text>The Royal Military College Saint-Jean (), commonly referred to as RMC Saint-Jean and CMR, is a Canadian military college and university. It is located on the historical site of Fort Saint-Jean, in Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Quebec, 40 km south of Montreal. RMC Saint-Jean is an arm of the Canadian Military College (CMC) system that provides two college-level programs in Social Science and Science, which are closely integrated with the undergraduate programs offered by the Royal Military College of Canada. RMC Saint-Jean was granted independent university status in 2021, and it currently offers a bachelor&#x27;s degree in International Studies.

== Responsibilities ==
* Conduct of preuniversity and university programs, as well as military and fitness training and bilingualism.

== Program ==
Intended for students who have obtained their high-school certificates in Quebec or the equivalent elsewhere in Canada, the programs offered at RMC Saint-Jean prepare students to pursue university studies in one of the programs offered at the Royal Military College of Canada in Kingston, Ontario, or in the International Studies program offered at RMC Saint-Jean.

Military education for Canadian officers is focused on the four pillars of achievement unique to the military colleges: the military, physical fitness, bilingualism, and academics.

About 345 students per year receive training at RMC Saint-Jean in the two-year pre-university programs leading to a college diploma or in the International Studies program leading to a baccalaureate:
* 110–120 cadets in the Preparatory Year
* 110–120 in First Year
*25-50 in Second Year
*25-40 in Third Year
*25-35 in Fourth Year

In some instances, RMC Saint-Jean allows Quebecers who have already completed a year of studies at the college level to be admitted directly into First Year.

In preparation for continued university studies at RMC, or RMC Saint-Jean should they choose the International Studies program, students select either the Social Science program (students pursuing a degree in Arts) or the Science program (students pursuing a degree in Engineering or Science). Each program is offered in both official languages. The two programs share core courses: four in literature; three in philosophy; two in Second Language; three in Physical Education. These core courses are supplemented with courses specific to each program. RMC Saint-Jean offers courses in both official languages.

Divided into two semesters, the academic year is composed of 150 teaching days and a final examination period, followed by a supplemental examination period.

== Academics ==

The core courses in both programs include: literature, humanities, second language, and physical education.

The mandate of the preparatory year is to develop in its students good work habits, academic diligence, critical facility, and team spirit.

== Regular Officer Training Program ==

Officer and Naval Cadets at RMC Saint-Jean are eligible for the Regular Officer Training Program. This program is designed for officer candidates to obtain a bachelor degree (which is required to be an officer in the Canadian Armed Forces) while attending either the Royal Military College in Saint-Jean or the Royal Military College of Canada in Kingston, Ontario. For certain degrees, it is possible to do ROTP through a civilian university if it is not offered at one of the military colleges.

== Uniforms ==
Officer/Naval cadets wear a variety of uniforms depending on the occasion and their environment: ceremonial dress (semi ceremonial); full dress (formal occasions); outside sports dress; service dress Air Force; service dress Navy; service dress Navy without jacket; Service dress Air Force without jacket; service dress Army without jacket; and combat dress.

In winter 2009, Royal Military College Officer/Naval cadets returned to wearing a distinctive Dress of the Day (DOD) uniform which consists of a white shirt, black sweater/light jacket, as well as black trousers/skirt with a red stripe down the side. The headdress is a black wedge with red piping.

Mess dress is worn in the Senior Staff Mess for formal occasions such as mess dinners.

== Positions of responsibility ==
To further their leadership skills and abilities, Officer/Naval cadets are appointed to positions of responsibility according to merit or a need for development. Each cadet wears 1-5 of bars to indicate authority. An appointment typically last a semester.
== Awards ==
Awards are granted to outstanding cadets:

== Squadrons of the Cadet Wing ==
The undergraduate body, known as the Cadet Wing, is subdivided into three smaller groupings called &quot;Squadrons&quot;, under the guidance and supervision of senior cadets. The squadrons are currently named in honour of local communities that take their name from historical figures of New France. Squadrons are subdivided into flights and sections. In 2017, another squadron was added named Jolliet. These squadrons have a competition called the &quot;Commandants Cup&quot; which is a competition in the four pillars of the college.

In the 1960s, the three squadrons were named Cartier, Maisonneuve and Champlain in honour of historical figures.

== Routine ==
When they arrive at the Officer Cadets Division, the officer cadets have already chosen their service. They are soon separated into four squadrons (Richelieu, Iberville, Tracy, or Jolliet).

The pre-university program features modern, diversified teaching methods: workshops, introduction to research methods, laboratories, group projects, oral and multimedia presentations. The staff provide academic support in the form of workshops, tutorials, and supplementary courses.

The Officer/Naval cadets live in the Cartier Building or the Champlain Building and eat in the Dextraze Pavilion (completed in 1993). The Officer/Naval cadets cannot leave the campus except on weekends. However, some weekends are used for military training.

During the week, the daily routine consists of inspection, running, breakfast, classes, sports, and studies. The Officer/Naval cadets attend academic classes and undergo military training. The military training is in the form of drill, cartography, compass use, and two major field exercises each year. The Officer/Naval cadets can take roles as cadet squadron leader, deputy cadet squadron leader, cadet flight leader and section commander. Outside classes, bilingualism is promoted by French / English weeks.

On the weekend, with the exception of military training, the students are largely free.

== History ==
In the fall of 2007, the federal government reopened the military college at Saint-Jean. The military college was slated for closure in 1995, but on 9 July 1994, the federal and provincial governments agreed to maintain it as a non-degree-granting college.

The reopened RMC Saint-Jean greatly differs from the original college which opened in 1952 and from the RMC of Canada located in Kingston. The new RMC Saint-Jean encompasses the Canadian Forces Management and Development School, one of the oldest CF training establishments in the country. It is also the home to the Chief Warrant Officer Robert Osside Profession of Arms Institute, which develops the prospective future senior leaders of the Canadian Forces NCM Corps.

Michaëlle Jean, Governor General of Canada, inaugurated the Royal Military College Saint-Jean on 24 May 2008, and she presented the new college coat of arms to the commandant, Colonel François Pion.

The Commandant of Royal Military College Saint-Jean reports to the Commander, Canadian Defence Academy (CDA). RMC Saint-Jean also has its own board of governors. Officer/Naval cadets at RMC Saint-Jean are issued scarlet uniforms. The first-year program at RMC Saint-Jean is freeing up beds at RMC allowing more Regular Officer Training Program (ROTP) cadets to attend RMC rather than civilian universities.


== Features and buildings ==
Richelieu, Jolliet, Tracy and Iberville Squadrons live in the Cartier and Champlain Blocks. The Vanier, DeLéry, Dextraze, Lahaie and Massey Pavillons along with the Old Mess are shared. The campus provides technological support: library, laboratories, learning materials, and Internet access. RMC Saint-Jean infrastructure is currently used by the Canadian Forces located at ASU Saint-Jean and by a non-profit corporation called &quot;Campus du Fort Saint-Jean (Quebec)&quot;, which arranges for the upkeep of many of the educational facilities and leases them out to educational institutions such as the Université du Québec à Montréal (UQAM) for their local program while also renting out others for short events such as large banquets or conventions.
The Register of the Government of Canada Heritage Buildings lists six recognized Federal Heritage Buildings on the Royal Military College Saint-Jean grounds:
=== Museum ===
The museum is located in Fort Saint-Jean on the campus of the Collège militaire royal de Saint-Jean. The museum&#x27;s mandate is to collect, conserve, research and display material relating to the history of the CMR, its former cadets and its site, Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu. Guided tours are offered. The museum contains collections of military memorabilia, military artefacts, maps, models, videos and historical objects. The site has been occupied since 1666 by different garrisons, a shipyard and a military college.
The CMR Ex-Cadet Foundation manages the museum which recognizes more than 325 years (1666–1995) of military history at the fortifications located on the Richelieu River. The flora and centenary trees enhance the site. The RMC Saint-Jean art collection includes a bronze sculpture of a cadet &#x27;Truth Duty Valour (1976)&#x27;, by William McElcheran (Canadian 1927–1999) &quot;Presented to ‘Le Collège Militaire Royal de Saint-Jean’ by the commandant, staff &amp; cadets of R.M.C., Canada on the occasion of the sister College&#x27;s visit, 12–17 May 1976&quot;.

The museum club began as a club for cadets in 1972 with the head of the museum club serving as curator. Officer Cadets were part of the team that converted the old guard house into a proper museum. Office Cadets designed diorama(s) used in the museum and the business card from the museum featured a picture of one of the officer cadet&#x27;s model soldiers on it.

The museum was closed from 1998 to 2003. The Museum Committee of the CMR Ex-Cadet Club Foundation was founded on 22 January 2003. When the museum was accredited a Canadian Forces Museum, the Museum Committee became an independent entity separate from the Foundation.

In 2006, while Hélène Ladouceur served as curator, the museum site moved from the old guardhouse to the entrance of the former Protestant Chapel. LGen (ret.) and Senator Roméo A. Dallaire presided over the official opening, which took place on 29 March 2006.

Eric Ruel became the museum curator in 2006. The museum website museedufortsaintjean.ca was created in June 2007.

In May 2012, while Eric Ruel served as curator, the museum relocated to the historical pavilion &quot;les Forges&quot;. The museum is open Wednesday to Sunday, from 10:00 to 17:00, from 24 May until 1 September.

Archaeology digs have taken place on the site from 2009 to 2013 through the Quebec Archaeo Month, an initiative of Archéo-Québec. Funded by the Directorate of History and Heritage of the Canadian Forces as part of a five-year agreement between the Fort Saint-Jean Museum, Laval University and the Royal Military College Saint-Jean, the Archaeology Digs are supported by the Corporation du Fort Saint-Jean and archaeologists from Parks Canada. The museum is a member of the Canadian Museums Association, Canadian Heritage Information Network (CHIN), Virtual Museum of Canada and the Organization of Military Museums of Canada Inc. The museum is an accredited museum within the Canadian Forces Museum System. The museum has formed a cooperating association of friends of the museum to assist with projects.

<text>Goose bumps, goosebumps or goose pimples are the bumps on a person&#x27;s skin at the base of body hairs which may involuntarily develop when a person is tickled, cold or experiencing strong emotions such as fear, euphoria or sexual arousal.

The formation of goose bumps in humans under stress is considered by some to be a vestigial reflex, though visible piloerection is associated with changes in skin temperature in humans. The reflex of producing goose bumps is known as piloerection or the pilomotor reflex, or, more traditionally, horripilation. It occurs in many mammals; a prominent example is porcupines, which raise their quills when threatened, or sea otters when they encounter sharks or other predators.

== Anatomy and biology ==
Goose bumps are created when tiny muscles at the base of each hair, known as &quot;arrector pili muscles&quot;, contract and pull the hair straight up. The reflex is started by the sympathetic nervous system, which is responsible for many fight-or-flight responses. The muscle cells connected to the hair follicle have been visualized by actin immunofluorescence.

Arrector pili muscle

Arrector pili muscles (APM) are smooth muscles which connect the basement membrane to the hair follicle. When these muscles contract, they increase the trapping of air on the surface of the skin and in turn, causes thermoregulation to the body. It used to be believed that each APM was connected to an individual hair follicle. More recent studies have disproved this and now explain that there can be multiple hair follicles connected to a single APM. In between the hair follicle and the APM there are lobules which form an angular shape. These lobules are sebaceous gland lobules which are supported by the APM.

Hair follicle

Hair follicles have four parts. There is the bulb, supra bulbar area, isthmus and infundibulum. The bulb is to be known as the part that is responsible for the growth of the rest of the hair follicle.

=== As a response to cold ===
In animals covered with fur or hair, the erect hairs trap air to create a layer of insulation. Goose bumps can also be a response to anger or fear: the erect hairs make the animal appear larger, in order to intimidate enemies. This can be observed in the intimidation displays of chimpanzees, some New World monkeys like the cotton-top tamarin, in stressed mice and rats, and in frightened cats.

=== In humans ===
In humans, goose bumps can even extend to piloerection as a reaction to hearing nails scratch on a chalkboard, or feeling or remembering strong and positive emotions (e.g., after winning a sports event), or while watching a horror film.
Some people can deliberately evoke goose bumps in themselves without any external trigger. This is called &quot;voluntarily generated piloerection.&quot; Further research is needed to discover more on such people.

Goose bumps are accompanied by a specific physiological response pattern that is thought to indicate the emotional state of being moved.

In humans, goose bumps occur everywhere on the body, including the legs, neck, and other areas of the skin that have hair. In some people, they even occur in the face or on the head. In humans, goose bumps tends to occur across the whole body, especially when elicited by thermal or emotional stimuli, and only locally when elicited via tactile stimuli. 

Piloerection is also a classic symptom of some diseases, such as temporal lobe epilepsy, some brain tumors, and autonomic hyperreflexia. Goose bumps can also be caused by withdrawal from opiates such as heroin. A skin condition that mimics goose bumps in appearance is keratosis pilaris.

== Causes ==
=== Extreme temperatures ===
Goose bumps can be experienced in the presence of flash-cold temperatures, for example being in a cold environment, and the skin being able to re-balance its surface temperature quickly. The stimulus of cold surroundings causes the tiny muscles (arrector pili muscle) attached to each hair follicle to contract. This contraction causes the hair strands to stand straight, the purpose of which is to aid in quicker drying via evaporation of water clinging to the hair which is moved upward and away from the skin.

=== Intense emotion ===
The emotional correlates of piloerection in humans are not well understood. People often say they feel their &quot;hair standing on end&quot; when they are frightened or in awe. 

=== Music ===
Most research using musical stimuli has focused on self-reported &quot;chills&quot; which is a subjective experience, unlike piloerection which is an objectively quantifiable physiological reaction. However, research has shown that self-reported piloerection does not correspond to observed piloerection. Thus, research on the chills should not be considered to extend to the physiological phenomena of piloerection. 

=== Ingestion ===
Medications and herbal supplements that affect body temperature and blood flow may cause piloerection. For example, one of the common reported side effects of the intake of yohimbine is piloerection.

=== Opiate withdrawal ===
Piloerection is one of the signs of opioid withdrawal. The term &quot;cold turkey&quot; meaning abrupt withdrawal from a drug, may derive from the goose bumps that occur during abrupt withdrawal from opioids; this resembles the skin of a refrigerated plucked turkey.

=== Voluntary control ===
An unknown proportion of people may consciously initiate the sensation and physiological signs of piloerection. The phenomenon is discovered spontaneously, appearing to be innate, and is not known to be possible to learn or acquire. Those with the ability frequently are unaware that it is not possible for everyone. The ability appears to correlate with personality traits associated with openness to experience.
== Etymology ==

The term &quot;goose bumps&quot; derives from the phenomenon&#x27;s association with goose skin. Goose feathers grow from pores in the epidermis that resemble human hair follicles. When a goose&#x27;s feathers are plucked, its skin has protrusions where the feathers were, and these bumps are what the human phenomenon resembles.

It is not clear why the particular fowl, goose, was chosen in English (and German, Greek, Icelandic, Italian, Swedish, Danish, Norwegian, Polish and Czech) as most other birds share this same anatomical feature. Other languages may use a different species. For example, the hen or chicken is used in Vietnamese, Korean, Japanese, Cantonese, Finnish, Dutch, Luxembourgish, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Romanian, and Galician; Irish uses both; Hebrew, the duck; the ants (referred to as &quot;murashki&quot;, alluding to the feeling of ants crawling on one&#x27;s skin) in Ukrainian and Russian; and a variety of synonyms in Mandarin.

Some authors have applied &quot;goose bumps&quot; to the symptoms of sexually transmitted diseases. &quot;Bitten by a Winchester goose&quot; was a common euphemism for having contracted syphilis in the 16th century. &quot;Winchester geese&quot; was the nickname for the prostitutes of Southern London, licensed by the Bishop of Winchester in the area around his London palace.

<doc id="793839" wikidata="Q22980" url="?curid=793839" title="Zwiebelkuchen">
<text> (, ) is a savory German onion cake made of steamed onions, diced bacon, cream, and caraway seeds on either a yeast or leavened dough. It is not to be confused with Flammkuchen, a similar dish that is more dry.

== History ==
Most of Zwiebelkuchen&#x27;s history is unknown, but has been mentioned as early as the 19th century and originates from Baden-Württemberg.

Zwiebelkuchen is a favored autumn dish commonly enjoyed at wine festivals. It is particularly popular in Germany&#x27;s wine-producing regions, including Thuringia, Palatinate, Hessia, Franconia, Swabia, Alsace, and the Rhine and Moselle areas. People enjoy drinking &quot;neuer Wein&quot; with it. &quot;Neuer Wein&quot; is slightly fermented grape juice, before the squeezed grapes turn into proper wine to be bottled. 

== Preparation ==
Instant yeast and sugar are combined with lukewarm milk and left to sit for 10 minutes. In a separate bowl, flour and salt are mixed together, followed by the addition of the yeast-milk mixture and vegetable oil. The resulting dough is kneaded for 5 minutes. The dough is then placed in a large, greased bowl, which is coated with cooking oil or nonstick spray. The bowl is covered with aluminum foil and placed in a warm environment for 45 minutes. Alternatively, plastic wrap or a kitchen towel can be used for covering.

Onions are peeled and sliced into thin rings, while bacon is cut into cubes. Vegetable oil is heated in a frying pan, and the bacon cubes are cooked until crispy. Once the bacon is crisp, the sliced onions are added to the pan. The heat is then reduced to low or medium, allowing the onions to cook until translucent.

Eggs and sour cream are placed in a bowl to be mixed and added to the onion-bacon mix, then seasoned with pepper, salt, and caraway seeds. The oven is preheated to 200 °C, and the baking tray is greased with butter to prepare for the oven. Upon the dough rising, it&#x27;s kneaded again on flour before being rolled into a thin rectangular shape. It&#x27;s then lifted in the baking form and the corners are pressed into, creating rims. The onion mixture is spread over the yeast base and baked in the oven for 35 minutes. After baking, the dish is left to cool slightly before serving. Optional garnishing with freshly chopped chives adds a final touch.

<doc id="793864" wikidata="Q562214" url="?curid=793864" title="Manhwa">
<text> (; ) is the general Korean term for comics and print cartoons. Outside Korea, the term usually refers to Korean comics. 

Modern Manhwa has extended its reach to many other countries. These comics have branched outside of Korea by access to Webtoons and have created an impact that has resulted in some movie, drama and television show adaptations.

==Characteristics==
The author or artist of a is called a (). They take on the task of creating a comic that fits a certain format. is read in the same direction as English books, horizontally and from left to right, because Korean is normally written and read horizontally. It can also be written and read vertically from right to left, top to bottom. Webtoons tend to be structured differently in the way they are meant for scrolling where manga is meant to be looked at page by page. , unlike their manga counterpart, is often in color when posted on the internet, but in black &amp; white when in a printed format.

 art differs from manga and manhua as well with its distinct features. The bodies of characters are often realistically proportioned, while the faces remain unrealistic. also often have very detailed clothing on their characters as well as intricate backgrounds. Webtoons use vertical scrolling to their advantage to demonstrate movement or the passage of time. webtoons are also recognized for having simplified dialogue compared to print.

==Etymology and influence==
Linguistically, , &quot;manga&quot; () and () all mean &#x27;comics&#x27; in Korean, Japanese and Chinese respectively. Manga comes from the Japanese word 漫画, (katakana: ; hiragana: ) which is composed of two kanji 漫 (man) meaning &#x27;whimsical or impromptu&#x27; and 画 (ga) meaning &#x27;pictures&#x27;. The same term is the root of the Korean word for comics, &#x27;manhwa&#x27;, and the Chinese word &#x27;manhua&#x27;. The Korean , the Japanese &quot;manga&quot; and the Chinese phrase are cognates () and their histories and influences intertwine with each other.

Originally the term &quot;manhua&quot; in Chinese vocabulary was an 18th-century term used in Chinese literati painting. The term &quot;manga&quot; () was used in Japan to mean &quot;comics&quot; in the late 19th century, when it became popular. Since then, &quot;manhua&quot; () and &quot;manhwa&quot; () have also come to mean &#x27;comics&#x27; in Chinese and Korean respectively.

Although in a traditional sense, the terms manga// had a similar meaning of comical drawing broadly, in English the terms and generally designate the manga-inspired comic strips. were not culturally isolated, and the influx of manga into the Korean comics market had a strong effect on the art and content of many artists&#x27; .

==History==

The term came into popular use in Korea during the 1920s, when it was applied to cartoons. By the mid 1920s, most newspapers were shut down, and political and social cartoons were abandoned, replaced by humorous illustrations and cartoons geared towards children.

Political cartoon slowly reemerged following the establishment of the Republic of Korea (commonly known as South Korea) in 1948. Popular artist Kim Yong-hwan started Korea&#x27;s first comic magazine, &quot;Manhwa Haengjin&quot;, in 1948, but it was quickly shut down because the authorities disapproved of the cover.

During the Korean war, Manhwa was used with the aim of boosting the morale of the public. The popularity of comics rose during the 1950s and 1960s, creating diversity of styles and subject matter which led to the construction of new genres such as sunjeong (or soonjung), stories containing romance that are aimed at young women. Also around this time another more humorous genre, myeongnyang &quot;or happy comics&quot; had become popular in order to counteract gritty ones. Manhwabang (lit. comics room), comics cafés and stores that allowed readers to pay a set rate to sit and read comics were also introduced to the public, creating a positive atmosphere around the comics. In response to the increasing publication of comics, as well as social and political changes within South Korea, the government began to enforce censorship laws and, by the mid-1960s, created a comics distribution monopoly that further censored .

Around this time was when Manhwa had come up in North Korea as well. Then in the early 2000s, the majority of Manhwa was transferred to online sources due to economic collapse that South Korea had experienced at the end of the millennium. The online publication of Manhwa significantly increased its popularity outside Korea. This led to the South Korean search portal to launch LINE Webtoon, a platform for distributing online Manhwa.

===Webtoons===
The term &quot;Webtoon&quot; () is a portmanteau of the Korean words 웹 meaning web and 카툰 meaning cartoon. The term was first coined on 8 August 2000, by Chollian, one of South Korea&#x27;s oldest and now discontinued internet service engines. Webtoons are the digital form of that first came into popularity in the early 2000s due to their free access and availability on the internet. It was also beneficial to creators because it helped them get around strict South Korean censorship laws. Webtoons encourage amateur writers to publish their own stories for others to read. Since their creation, webtoons have gained popularity around the globe and have even been adopted outside of Korea as another form of comic publication. This is credited to their unique format and pay model.

In 2014 WEBTOON&#x27;s global website and mobile app were launched, revolutionizing the comic world&#x27;s way of reading for entertainment. Also, around this time JunKoo Kim, the person that started LINE Webtoon, had reported that Webtoon was used in 60 countries, had 55 million monthly users, and 100 billion annual views.

== outside of Korea==
 has reached all over the world now. With websites such as TopToon, a webtoon company from Korea that also has a global service in TopToonPlus, people are able to access a wide variety of comics from their phones. There are also places like WEBTOON that not only allow people to read original comics, but make them as well, opening up this aspect of Korean culture for everyone to take part in.

But despite that, the relative obscurity of Korean culture in the Western world has caused the word to remain somewhat unknown in the English-speaking countries. English translations of have achieved success by targeting the manga and anime community, to the extent that were marketed as &quot;manga&quot; by the American publisher Tokyopop.

===United States===
Sanho Kim was the first artist working in the States. During the 1960s and 1970s, he worked for publishers Charlton Comics, Warren Publishing, Iron Horse Publishing, Skywald Publications, DC Comics, and Marvel Comics.

According to journalist Paul Gravett, in 1987 Eastern Comics published the first original in the United States.

Due to the explosion of manga&#x27;s popularity in the Americas, many of the licensed titles acquired for the American market seek to emulate the popular elements of other successful series. Recently, long-running webtoons serialized via Internet portal sites (e.g. by Daum Media), like Lezhin Comics and personal homepages have become both the creative and popular destination among the younger generation in Korea.
With manga proving to be both popular and commercially successful in Europe and the United States, a number of publishers imported and translated titles in the hope of reaching the same audience. The readability and left-to-right orientation of contributed to its growing popularity, as did the realism of the characters and the combination of Eastern and Western styles and mythologies.

==Media franchise==

Animations based on Korean comics are still relatively rare (though there were several major hits in the late 1980s and early 90s with titles such as &quot;Dooly the Little Dinosaur&quot; and &quot;Fly! Superboard&quot;). However, live-action drama series and movie adaptations of have occurred more frequently in recent years. &quot;Full House&quot; in 2004 and &quot;Goong&quot; (&quot;Palace&quot; or &quot;Princess Hours&quot;) in 2006 are prominent examples. Below is a list of manhwa titles adapted into television series, web series, films, etc. Not to be confused to another adapted works of adapted from Webtoons.

<text>was a Japanese astrophysicist. Hayashi tracks on the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram are named after him.

Hayashi was born in Kyoto and enrolled at the Imperial University of Tokyo in 1940, earning his BSc in Physics after 2½ years, in 1942. He was conscripted into the navy and, after the war ended, joined the group of Hideki Yukawa at Kyoto University. He was appointed a professor at Kyoto University in 1957.

He made additions to the Big Bang nucleosynthesis model that built upon the work of the classic Alpher–Bethe–Gamow paper.
Probably his most famous work was the astrophysical calculations that led to the Hayashi tracks of star formation, and the Hayashi limit that puts a limit on star radius.
He was also involved in the early study of brown dwarfs, some of the smallest stars formed.

He retired in 1984 and died from pneumonia at a Kyoto hospital on February 28, 2010.

<doc id="793872" wikidata="Q5153694" url="?curid=793872" title="Commonwealth Bank Trophy">
<text>The Commonwealth Bank Trophy, also referred to as the National Netball League, was the top level national Australian netball league between 1997 and 2007. The league was organized by Netball Australia. Its main sponsor was the Commonwealth Bank. Melbourne Phoenix were the competition&#x27;s most successful team, winning five premierships. Sydney Swifts were the second most successful team, winning four premierships. Between them, Phoenix and Swifts played in every grand final, except in 1999 when Adelaide Thunderbirds won the second of their two premierships. Ahead of the 2008 season, the Commonwealth Bank Trophy league effectively merged with New Zealand&#x27;s National Bank Cup to form the ANZ Championship.

==Teams==

The founding members of the Commonwealth Bank Trophy league included Adelaide Ravens, Adelaide Thunderbirds, Melbourne Kestrels, Melbourne Phoenix, Perth Orioles, Sydney Sandpipers, Sydney Swifts and Queensland Firebirds. The majority of the teams were named after native Australian birds including ravens, kestrels, orioles and sandpipers. Adelaide Thunderbirds were initially going to be named Adelaide Falcons but the name was changed at the request of the rugby union team. In 2003 Ravens were replaced by AIS Canberra Darters and in 2004 Sandpipers were replaced by Hunter Jaegers.

In 2008, when the Commonwealth Bank Trophy league was replaced by the ANZ Championship, Thunderbirds and Firebirds became founders of the new league. Several other Commonwealth Bank Trophy teams were transformed to form ANZ Championship teams. Swifts and Jaegers merged to become New South Wales Swifts, Kestrels and Phoenix merged to become Melbourne Vixens and Orioles were rebranded as West Coast Fever. Meanwhile, the Australian Institute of Sport and Canberra Darters ended their partnership and in 2008 entered two separate team in the Australian Netball League.

<text>The Penguin Book of Contemporary British Poetry is a poetry anthology edited by Blake Morrison and Andrew Motion, and published in 1982 by Penguin Books.

Shortly after its publication, Morrison acknowledged the criticisms made towards the anthology, including that it was &quot;merely &#x27;fashionable&#x27;&quot; and the &quot;committee English&quot; of its introduction. Poets in the 1962 Al Alvarez anthology, &quot;The New Poetry&quot;, were excluded. The inclusion of Seamus Heaney (who, although born in Northern Ireland, held a Republic of Ireland passport) led to him to deliver a riposte in his poem, &quot;An Open Letter&quot; (1983):
&lt;poem&gt;
:&quot;Don&#x27;t be surprised if I demur, for, be advised
:My passport&#x27;s green.
:No glass of ours was ever raised
:To toast The Queen.&quot;
&lt;/poem&gt;

Poets included in the book were Anne Stevenson, Carol Rumens, Christopher Reid, Craig Raine, David Sweetman, Derek Mahon, Douglas Dunn, Fleur Adcock, Hugo Williams, James Fenton, Jeffrey Wainwright, Medbh McGuckian, Michael Longley, Paul Muldoon, Penelope Shuttle, Peter Scupham, Seamus Heaney, Tom Paulin, and Tony Harrison.

<text>Zanskar, Zahar (locally) or Zangskar, is the southwestern region of the Indian union territory of Ladakh. The administrative centre of Zanskar is Padum. Zanskar, together with the rest of Ladakh, was briefly a part of the kingdom of Western Tibet called Ngari Khorsum. Zanskar lies 250 km south of Kargil town on NH301.

In August 2024, the Ministry of Home Affairs announced that Zanskar will become a district in Ladakh by 2028.

==Etymology==
Zanskar ( &quot;zangs dkar&quot;) appears as &quot;“Zangskar”&quot; mostly in academic studies in social sciences (anthropology, gender studies), reflecting the Ladakhi pronunciation, although the Zanskari pronunciation is Zãhar. Older geographical accounts and maps may use the alternate spelling &quot;Zaskar&quot;. An etymological study (Snellgrove and Skorupsky, 1980) of the name reveals that its origin might refer to the natural occurrence of copper in this region, the Tibetan word for which is &quot;Zangs&quot;. The second syllable however seems to be more challenging as it has various meanings: &quot;Zangs-dkar&quot; (white copper), &quot;Zangs-mkhar&quot; (copper palace), or &quot;Zangs-skar&quot; (copper star). Others claim it derives from &quot;zan&quot; = copper + &quot;skar&quot; = valley. John Crook (1994) partly shares this interpretation but suggests that the origin of this name might also be &quot;Zan-mKhar&quot; (food palace), because the staple food crops are so abundant in an otherwise rather arid region. The locally accepted spelling of the name in Tibetan script is zangs-dkar.

Some of the religious scholars of the district, also cited by Snellgrove and Skorupsky (1980) and Crook (1994), hold that it was originally &quot;bzang-dkar&quot;, meaning good (or beautiful) and white. &quot;Good&quot; would refer to the triangular shape of the Padum plain, the triangle being the symbol of Dharma and religion; &quot;white&quot; would refer to the simplicity, goodness, and religious inclinations of the native population.

==History==
The first traces of human activity in Zanskar seem to go back as far as the Bronze Age. Petroglyphs attributed to that period suggest that their creators were hunters on the steppes of central Asia, living between Kazakhstan and China. It is suspected that an Indo-European population known as the Mon might then have lived in this region, before mixing with or being replaced by the next settlers, the Dards. Early Buddhism coming from Kashmir spread its influence in Zanskar, possibly as early as 200 BC. The earliest monuments date from the Kushan period. After this eastward propagation of Buddhism, Zanskar and large parts of the Western Himalaya were overrun in the 7th century by the Tibetans, who imposed their then animistic Bön religion.

Buddhism regained its influence over Zanskar in the 8th century when Tibet was also converted to this religion. Between the 10th and 11th centuries, two Royal Houses were founded in Zanskar, and the monasteries of Karsha and Phugtal (see picture) were built. Until the 15th century Zanskar existed as a more or less independent Buddhist Kingdom ruled by two to four related royal families. In the early 17th century, Zanskar was conquered by Sengge Namgyal and was incorporated into Ladakh. In 1822 a coalition of Kulu, Lahoul, and Kinnaur invaded Zanskar, plundering the country and destroying the royal palace at Padum.

In the mid-20th century, border conflicts between India, Pakistan and China caused Ladakh and Zanskar to be closed to foreigners. During these wars Ladakh lost two thirds of its original territory, losing Baltistan to Pakistan and the Aksai Chin to China. Ladakh and Zanskar, despite a tumultuous history of internal wars and external aggressions, have never lost their cultural and religious heritage since the 8th century. this is also one of the rare regions in the Himalaya where traditional Tibetan culture, society, and buildings survived the Chinese Cultural Revolution. In the last twenty years, the opening of a road and the massive influx of tourists and researchers have brought many changes to the traditional social organisation of Zanskar. In 2007 the valley suffered its third year of a desert locust infestation with many villages losing their crops. The response of the monasteries puja (prayer) to get rid of them, while the government advocated insecticides, which the Buddhists were reluctant to use, but in some cases were forced to try, with as yet undocumented success. In 2008 it was reported that the locusts had left the central Zanskar plains.

People of Zanskar demanded having their own district, separate from the existing Kargil district, for more than 70 years. The Ladakh Buddhist Association also demanded the creation of a Zanskar district. In August 2024, the Ministry of Home Affairs announced that Zanskar will become a district in Ladakh by 2028.

==Geography==
===Topography===

Zanskar covers an area of some , generally at an elevation between . It consists of the country lying along the two main branches of the Zanskar River. The first, the Doda River, has its source near the Penzi La mountain-pass, and then flows south-eastwards along the main valley leading towards Padum, the capital of Zanskar.

The second branch is formed by two main tributaries known as Kargyag river (also known as Kurgiakh river), with its source near the Shinku La , and Tsarap River, with its source near the Baralacha-La. These two rivers unite below the village of Purney to form the Lungnak river (also known as the Lingti or Tsarap river). The Lungnak river then flows north-westwards along a narrow gorge towards Zanskar&#x27;s central valley (known locally as jung-khor), where it unites with the Doda river to form the Zanskar river.

The Zanskar river then takes a north-eastern course until it joins the Indus in Ladakh. High mountain ridges lie on both sides of the Doda and Lingti–kargyag valleys, which run north-west to south-east. To the south-west is the Great Himalayan Range which separates Zanskar from the Kisthwar and Chamba basins. To the north-east lies the Zanskar Range, which separates Zanskar from Ladakh. The only outlet for the whole Zanskar hydrographic system is thus the Zanskar river, which cuts the deep and narrow Zanskar Gorge through the Zanskar range.

These topographical features explain why access to Zanskar is difficult from all sides. Communication with the neighbouring Himalayan areas is maintained across mountain passes or along the Zanskar river when frozen. The easiest approach leads from Kargil through the Suru valley and over the Penzi-La. It is along this track that in 1979 the only road in Zanskar was built to connect Padum with the main road from Srinagar into Ladakh. One of the first Tibetologists to spend an extended period in the region was Hungarian scholar Sándor Csoma de Kőrös who spent over a year living in the region in 1823. After being integrated into the newly formed state of India in 1947, Zanskar and the neighbouring region of Ladakh were both declared restricted areas and only opened to foreigners in 1974.

===Climate===
Zanskar is a high altitude semi-desert lying on the northern flank of the Himalayan Range. This mountain range acts as a barrier protecting Ladakh and Zanskar from most of the monsoon, resulting in a pleasantly warm and dry climate in the summer. Rain and snowfall during this period are scarce, although recent decades have shown a trend towards increasing precipitation. Several water-driven mills were built during ancient periods of drought at a great distance from the villages, but have been abandoned because running water is now available nearer to the settlements. Zanskari houses, though otherwise well built, are not adapted to the recently increasing rainfall, as their roofs leak, catching their surprised inhabitants unprepared. Most of the precipitation occurs as snowfall during the harsh and extremely long winter period. These winter snowfalls are of vital importance, since they feed the glaciers which melt in the summer and provide most of the irrigation water. Parts of Zanskar valley are considered some of the coldest continually inhabited places in the world.

==Demographics==
Zanskar&#x27;s population is small, the 2011 census recorded a population of 13,793 people. The sex ratio was 862 females per 1,000 males. The literacy rate was 59.73%. The majority of Zanskaris are of mixed Tibetan and Indo-European origins; notably Changpa, Dard and Mon. The latter are ethnically Dard, but &quot;Mon&quot; is used in order to distinguish them from later Dard settlers. A small fraction are Sunni Muslims whose ancestors settled in Padum and its environs in the 19th century.

===Religion===
An overwhelming majority of Zanskar is Buddhist. Almost every village has a local monastery, often containing ancient wall-paintings and images. There are two main branches of Tibetan Buddhism here — the Drugpa, including Sani Monastery, Dzongkhul, Stagrimo and Bardan Monastery - all loosely affiliated with Stakna in the Indus valley. The Gelugpa control Rangdum Monastery, Karsha, Stongde and Phugtal Monastery, which all pay allegiance to the Ngari Rinpoche, who has his main seat at Likir Monastery in Ladakh. The present emanation of the Ngari Rinpoche is the younger brother of the Dalai Lama.

===Languages===
People living in Zanskar speak Zanskari language of the Ladakhi-Balti language group. It is written using the Tibetan script. Monks who have studied outside of Zanskar may know Standard Tibetan. Educated people of Zanskar know English as it is a compulsory subject in numerous Indian schools.The population lives mainly in scattered small villages, the largest being the capital Padum, with nearly 700 inhabitants. Most of the villages are located in the valleys of the Zanskar river and its two main tributaries. Given the isolation of this region, the inhabitants tend towards self-sufficiency, and until recently lived in almost complete autarky. External trade has, however, always been necessary for the acquisition of goods such as tools, jewellery, or religious artefacts.

==Flora and fauna==

Much of Zanskar&#x27;s vegetation is found in the irrigated villages, and on the upper slopes, which receive more precipitation and grow alpine and tundra species. Most impressive are the meadows covered with thousands of edelweiss. At the foot of the Gumburanjon mountain, blue poppies can be found. Crops including barley, lentils, and potatoes are grown by farmers at the lower elevations. Domesticated animals such as the yak, dzo, sheep, horse, and dog are found in the region.

Among the wildlife found in Zanskar are the marmot, bear, wolf, snow leopard, bharal, alpine ibex, gray goral, and lammergeier.

==Economy ==
===Livestock===
Livestock, and especially the yak, is of paramount importance in Zanskar. Yaks are used to plough the land, thresh grain, and carry heavy loads (up to 200 kilograms). Their dung not only serves as fertiliser but is also the only heating fuel available in the region. They are a vital source of milk and sometimes, but rarely, of meat. Yak fur is used to make clothes, carpets, ropes, and bed covers.

The Zanskaris&#x27; main occupations are cattle-rearing and farming of land that they almost always own. Cultivable land is scarce, and restricted to alluvial fans and terraces, cultivated fields being rarely found above an altitude of 4,000 metres. The Zanskaris have developed a system of intensive arable agriculture and complex irrigation to produce enough food in these conditions. The scarcity of cultivable land has also resulted in a tendency towards a stable, zero-growth population. An efficient birth-control system in Zanskar has historically been achieved by the common practice of polyandrous marriage, in which several brothers are married to the same wife, and the widespread adoption of a celibate religious life. A high infant mortality rate also contributes to population stability.
In the summer, the women and children stay far away from the villages to tend to the livestock. This system, known as transhumance, is similar to the one found in the Alps where the animals are sent during the summer higher up in the mountains (the alpine meadows) and were kept by the children and women.

===Tourism===
Tourism is probably the major disruption that Zanskar has experienced during recent times. The opening of this region to foreigners has brought changes such as the financing of schools and the restoration of monasteries and roads, but has also taken its toll on the fragile mountain environment and its population. 

== In popular culture ==
The first colour film of life in Zanskar was shot in 1958 by an expedition of three British housewives.

The 2001 movie &quot;Samsara&quot; was entirely shot in Zanskar. In 2010, the American film director Frederick Marx made a documentary called &quot;Journey from Zanskar&quot;. Narrated by Richard Gere, the film tells the story of two monks helping 17 poor children reaching Tibetan schools in India through a difficult and dangerous terrain.

<text>A feeder line is a peripheral route or branch in a network, which connects smaller or more remote nodes with a route or branch carrying heavier traffic. The term is applicable to any system based on a hierarchical network.

In telecommunications, a feeder line branches from a main line or trunk line.

In electrical engineering, a feeder line is a type of transmission line. In addition Feeders are the power lines through which electricity is transmitted in power systems. Feeder transmits power from Generating station or substation to the distribution points. They are similar to distributors except the fact that there is no intermediate tapping done and hence the current flow remains same at the sending as well as the receiving end. In radio engineering, a feeder connects radio equipment to an antenna, usually &quot;open wire&quot; (air-insulated wire line) or twin-lead from a shortwave transmitter. In power engineering, a feeder line is part of an electric distribution network, usually a radial circuit of intermediate voltage.

== In public transport ==
The concept of feeder lines is important in public transportation. The term is particularly used in US air travel and rail transport. Feeder lines play a crucial role in public transportation systems by ensuring connectivity between high-capacity routes and more localized departure and destination points. In this hierarchical network, efficient, high-capacity routes serve as the main arteries, linking significant nodes such as major transit stations or central business districts. Feeder lines, on the other hand, branch off from these main routes, connecting smaller or more remote areas to these hubs. This structure helps facilitate smooth and efficient travel across a region, allowing passengers to transition seamlessly from local to long-distance travel segments. 

For instance, in urban transit planning, bus routes often act as feeders to high-capacity systems like subways or light rail, collecting passengers from various neighborhoods and transporting them to major transit hubs. This setup is essential for optimizing the overall efficiency and accessibility of public transportation networks, ensuring that even areas not directly served by high-capacity routes can still benefit from the broader transit system.

<doc id="793897" wikidata="Q352109" url="?curid=793897" title="Robert Knox (surgeon)">
<text>Robert Knox (4 September 1791 – 20 December 1862) was a Scottish anatomist and ethnologist best known for his involvement in the Burke and Hare murders. Born in Edinburgh, Scotland, Knox eventually partnered with anatomist and former teacher John Barclay and became a lecturer on anatomy in the city, where he introduced the theory of transcendental anatomy. However, Knox&#x27;s incautious methods of obtaining cadavers for dissection before the passage of the Anatomy Act 1832 and disagreements with professional colleagues ruined his career in Scotland. Following these developments, he moved to London, though this did not revive his career.

Knox&#x27;s views on humanity gradually shifted over the course of his lifetime, as his initially positive views (influenced by the ideals of Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire) gave way to a more pessimistic view. Knox also devoted the latter part of his career to studying and theorising on evolution and ethnology; during this period, he also wrote numerous works advocating scientific racism. His work on the latter further harmed his legacy and overshadowed his contributions to evolutionary theory, which he used to account for racial differences.

== Life ==
===Early life===
Robert Knox was born in 1791 in Edinburgh&#x27;s North Richmond Street, the eighth child of Mary (née Scherer) and Robert Knox (d. 1812), a teacher of mathematics and natural philosophy at Heriot&#x27;s Hospital in Edinburgh. As an infant, he contracted smallpox, which destroyed his left eye and disfigured his face. He was educated at the Royal High School of Edinburgh, where he was remembered as a &#x27;bully&#x27; who thrashed his contemporaries &quot;mentally and corporeally&quot;. He won the Lord Provost&#x27;s gold medal in his final year.

In 1810, he joined medical classes at the University of Edinburgh. He soon became interested in transcendentalism and the work of Xavier Bichat. He was twice president of the Royal Physical Society, an undergraduate club to which he presented papers on hydrophobia and nosology. The final recorded event of his university years was his just failing the anatomy examination. Knox joined the &quot;extramural&quot; anatomy class of the famous John Barclay. Barclay was an anatomist of the highest distinction, and perhaps the greatest anatomical teacher in Britain at that time. Redoubling his efforts, Knox passed competently the second time around.

=== Life abroad ===
Knox graduated from the University of Edinburgh in 1814, with a Latin thesis on the effects of narcotics which was published the following year. He joined the army and was commissioned Hospital Assistant on 24 June 1815, after having studied for a year under John Abernethy at St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital in London. He was sent immediately to Belgium to attend the wounded from the Battle of Waterloo and returned two weeks later with the first batch of wounded aboard a hospital ship; during the voyage he successfully employed Abernethy&#x27;s technique of leaving wounds open to the air. His army work at the Brussels military hospital (near Waterloo) impressed upon him the need for a comprehensive training in anatomy if surgery were to be successful. Knox was intelligent, critical and irritable. He did not suffer fools gladly and—in an aside with terrible consequences for his future career—he was critical of the surgical work of Charles Bell with casualties at the Battle of Waterloo. After a further trip to Belgium he was placed in charge of Hilsea hospital near Portsmouth, where he experimented with non-mercurial cures for syphilis.

In April 1817, he joined the 72nd Highlanders and sailed with them to South Africa. There were few army surgeons in the Cape Colony but Knox found the people healthy and his duties were light. He enjoyed riding, shooting and the beauty of the landscape with which he felt in spiritual harmony—an early expression of his transcendental world view. Knox developed an interest in observing racial types, and disapproved of what he saw as the Boers&#x27; contempt for the indigenous peoples. However, after an abortive Xhosa rebellion against the colonial forces, he was involved in a retaliatory raid commanded by Andries Stockenström, a magistrate and future Lieutenant Governor. Relations with Stockenström were marred when Knox accused O. G. Stockenström, Andries&#x27; brother, of theft, a charge apparently prompted by ill feeling between British and Boer officers. A court martial acquitted O. G. of the charge and Andries called Knox&#x27;s conduct shameful. One of Stockenström&#x27;s supporters, a former naval officer named Burdett, challenged Knox to a duel. Knox initially refused to fight, and Burdett &quot;soundly horse whipped him on the parade before every Officer of the Garrison.&quot; Knox then grabbed a sabre and inflicted a slight wound to Burdett&#x27;s arm. Knox&#x27;s promotion to Assistant Surgeon was cancelled and he returned to Britain in disgrace, arriving on Christmas Day 1820. He remained only until the following October, after which he went to Paris to study anatomy for just over a year (1821–22). It was then that he met both Georges Cuvier and Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, who were to remain his heroes for the rest of life, to populate his later medical journalism, and to become the subject of his hagiography, &quot;Great artists and great anatomists&quot;. While in Paris he befriended Thomas Hodgkin, with whom he shared a dissecting room at l&#x27;Hôpital de la Pitié.

=== Career in Edinburgh ===
Knox returned to Edinburgh by Christmas 1822. On 1 December 1823 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. During these years he communicated a number of well-received papers to the Royal and Wernerian societies of Edinburgh on zoological subjects, including a paper suggesting that the &quot;Hottentot&quot; or &quot;Bosjesman&quot; Khoe and San people descended from &quot;Mongolic&quot; Chinese people. Soon after his election he submitted a plan to the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh for a Museum of Comparative Anatomy, which was accepted, and on 13 January 1825 he was appointed curator of the museum with a salary of £100.

In 1825, John Barclay offered him a partnership at his anatomy school in Surgeon&#x27;s Square, Edinburgh. In order for his lectures to be recognised by the Edinburgh College of Surgeons, Knox had to be admitted to its fellowship; a formality, but, at £250, an expensive one. At this time most professorships were in the gift of the town council, resulting in such uninspiring teachers as the professor of anatomy Alexander Monro, who put off many of his students (including the young Charles Darwin who took the course 1825–1827). This created a demand for private tuition, and the flamboyant Knox—in sole charge after Barclay&#x27;s death in 1826—had more students than all the other private tutors put together.

He turned his sharp wit on the elders and the clergy of the city, satirising religion and delighting his students. Knox routinely referred to the Bridgewater Treatises as the &quot;bilgewater treatises&quot; and his &#x27;continental&#x27; lectures were not for the squeamish. John James Audubon was in Edinburgh at the time to find subscribers for his &quot;Birds of America&quot;. Shown round the dissecting theatre by Knox, &quot;dressed in an overgown and with bloody fingers&quot;, Audubon reported that &quot;The sights were extremely disagreeable, many of them shocking beyond all I ever thought could be. I was glad to leave this charnel house and breathe again the salubrious atmosphere of the streets&quot;. Knox&#x27;s school flourished and he took on three assistants, Alexander Miller, Thomas Wharton Jones and William Fergusson.

===Marriage and personal life===
Little is known of Knox&#x27;s wife, Susan Knox, whom he married in 1824. According to Knox&#x27;s friend Henry Lonsdale the marriage was kept secret as she was &#x27;of inferior rank.&#x27; During his time in Edinburgh, Knox lived at 4 Newington Place with his sisters Mary and Jessie, while Susan and his four children lived at Lilliput Cottage in Trinity, west of Leith. They had seven children, but only two of them survived into adulthood.

=== West Port murders ===

Before the Anatomy Act 1832 widened the supply, the main legal supply of corpses for anatomical purposes in the UK were those condemned to death and dissection by the courts. This led to a chronic shortage of legitimate subjects for dissection, and this shortage became more serious as the need to train medical students grew, and the number of executions fell. In his school Knox ran up against the problem from the start, since—after 1815—the Royal Colleges had increased the anatomical work in the medical curriculum. If he taught according to what was known as &#x27;French method&#x27; the ratio would have had to approach one corpse per pupil.

As a consequence, body-snatching became so prevalent that it was not unusual for relatives and friends of someone who had just died to watch over the body until burial, and then to keep watch over the grave after burial, to stop it being violated.

In November 1827, William Hare began a new career when an indebted lodger died on him by chance. He was paid £7.10s (seven pounds &amp; ten shillings) for delivering the body to Knox&#x27;s dissecting rooms at Surgeons&#x27; Square. Now Hare and, his friend and accomplice, William Burke, set about murdering the city’s poor on a regular basis. After 16 more transactions, each netting £8-10, in what later became known as the West Port Murders, on 2 November 1828 Burke and Hare were caught, and the whole city convulsed with horror, fed by ballads, broadsides, and newspapers, at the reported deeds of the pair. Hare turned King&#x27;s evidence, and Burke was hanged, dissected and his remains were displayed.
Knox was not prosecuted, which outraged many in Edinburgh. His house was attacked by a mob of &#x27;the lowest rabble of the Old Town,&#x27; and windows were broken. A committee of the Royal Society of Edinburgh exonerated him on the grounds that he had not dealt personally with Burke and Hare, but there was no forgetting his part in the case, and many remained wary of him.

Almost immediately after the Burke and Hare case, the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh began to harry him, and by June 1831 they had procured his resignation as curator of the museum he had proposed and founded. In the same year he was obliged to resign his army commission to avoid further service in the Cape. This removed his last source of guaranteed income, but fortunately his classes were more popular than ever, with a record 504 students. His school moved to the grander premises of Old Surgeons&#x27; Hall in 1833 but his class declined after Edinburgh University made its own practical anatomy class compulsory in the mid-1830s. Knox continued to purchase cadavers for his dissection class from such shadowy figures as the &#x27;Black Bull Man,&#x27; but after the 1832 Anatomy Act made bodies more available to all anatomists, he quarrelled with HM Inspector of Anatomy over the supply of bodies, and his competitive edge was lost. In 1837 Knox applied for the chair in pathology at Edinburgh University but his candidature was blocked by eleven existing professors, who preferred to abolish the post rather than appoint him. In 1842 he was unable to make payments to the Edinburgh funeratory system, from which bodies were supplied to private schools, and he relocated to Glasgow where, still short of subjects for dissection, he closed his school in 1844. In 1847 the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh found him guilty of falsifying a student&#x27;s certificate of attendance (not an uncommon practice in private schools) and refused to accept any further certificates from him, effectively banning him from teaching in Scotland. In the same year he was expelled from the Royal Society of Edinburgh and had his election retrospectively cancelled.

=== London ===

Knox left for London after the death of his wife (the remaining children were left with a nephew). He found it impossible to find a university post, and from then until 1856 he worked on medical journalism, gave public lectures, and wrote several books, including his most ambitious work, &quot;The Races of Men&quot; in which he argued that each race was suited to its environment and &quot;perfect in its own way.&quot; Additionally, Knox wrote a book on fishing in Scotland, which became his best-selling work. In 1854 his son Robert died of heart disease; Knox tried for a posting to the Crimea but at 63 was judged too old.

In 1856 he became the pathological anatomist to the Free Cancer Hospital, London. He joined the medical register at its inception in 1858 and practiced obstetrics in Hackney. On 27 November 1860 he was elected an Honorary Fellow of the Ethnological Society of London, where he spoke in public for the last time on 1 July 1862. He continued working at the Cancer Hospital until shortly before his death on 20 December 1862, at 9 Lambe Terrace in Hackney. He was buried at Brookwood Cemetery near Woking, Surrey.

==Ethnology and racism==
Knox&#x27;s interest in race began as an undergraduate. His relevant political views were radical: he was an abolitionist and anti-colonialist who criticised the Boer as &quot;the cruel oppressor of the dark races.&quot; Knox is generally considered to be a polygenist; however, some have argued that he was a monogenist, including biographer Alan Bates, who considers such claims to be &quot;exaggerated.&quot; Robert Knox once wrote that he believed all human races to descend from an original &#x27;Caucasian&#x27; race. In his best-selling work, &quot;The Races of Men&quot; (1850), a &quot;Zoological history&quot; of mankind, Knox exaggerated supposed racial differences in support of his project, asserting that, anatomically and behaviourally, &quot;race, or hereditary descent, is everything.&quot; He offered crude characterisations of each racial group: for example the Saxon (in which race he included himself) &quot;invents nothing&quot;, &quot;has no musical ear&quot;, lacks &quot;genius&quot;, and is so &quot;low and boorish&quot; that &quot;he does not know what you mean by fine art.&quot; No race was without its redeeming features, however; Knox described Saxons as &quot;[t]houghtful, plodding, industrious beyond all other races, [and] a lover of labour for labour&#x27;s sake.&quot; Such supposed racial characteristics meant that each race was naturally fitted for a particular environment and could not endure outside it. While Knox maintained that all races were capable of some form of civilized life, he maintained that a vast gulf stood between the limited attainments available to the &#x27;negroid&#x27; and to most &#x27;mongoloid&#x27; races on one hand and the much greater past achievements and future potential of white men on the other. The Black, Knox remarked, &quot;is no more a white man than an ass is a horse or a zebra.&quot; Ultimately however, all races were &quot;[d]estined ... to run, like all other animals, a certain limited course of existence&quot;, it mattering &quot;little how their extinction is brought about&quot;. In 1862 Knox took the opportunity of a second edition of &quot;The Races of Men&quot; to defend the &quot;much maligned races&quot; of the Cape against accusations of cannibalism, and to rebuke the Dutch for treating them like &quot;wild beasts&quot;.

From the perspective of a Lowland Scot Protestant, Knox&#x27;s racist works espoused extreme racial hostility to Celts in general (including the Highland Scots and Welsh people, but particularly the Irish people). Due to what he observed to be a prevalence of the &quot;peculiar Mongol face&quot; in many Highland Scots, Knox once suggested that he considered Highland Scots to descend from an early migration of &quot;Mongol races&quot;. He considered the &quot;Caledonian Celt&quot; as touching &quot;the end of his career: they are reduced to about one hundred and fifty thousand&quot; and that the &quot;Welsh Celts are not troublesome, but might easily become so.&quot; For Knox, &quot;the Irish Celt is the most to be dreaded&quot; and openly advocated their ethnic cleansing around the time that the Great Famine was happening, stating in &quot;The Races of Men: A Fragment&quot; (1850): &quot;The source of all evil lies in the race, the Celtic race of Ireland. There is no getting over historical facts. Look at Wales, look at Caledonia; it is ever the same. [...] The race must be forced from the soil; by fair means, if possible; still they must leave. The Orange club of Ireland is a Saxon confederation for the clearing the land of all Papists and Jacobites; this means Celts. If left to themselves, they would clear them out, as Cromwell proposed, by the sword; it would not require six weeks to accomplish the work. But the Encumbered Estates Relief Bill will do it better.&quot;

== Transcendentalism ==

In his writings Knox synthesised a perspective on nature from three of the most influential natural historians of his time. From Cuvier, he took a consciousness of the great epochs of time, of the fact of extinction, and of the inadequacy of the biblical account. From Étienne Geoffroy St-Hilaire and Henri Marie Ducrotay de Blainville, he gained a spatial and thematic perspective on living things. If one had the skill, all living beings could be arranged in their correct placing in a notional table, and one would see both internally and externally the elegant variation of their organs and anatomy according to the principles of connection, unity of composition and compensation.

Goethe is another crucial addition to the Knoxian way of looking at nature. Goethe thought that there were transcendental archetypes in the living world which could be perceived by genus. If the natural historian were perspicacious enough to examine the creatures in this correct order he could perceive—aesthetically—the archetype that was immanent in the totality of a series, although present in none of them.

Knox wrote that he was concerned to prove the existence of a generic animal, &quot;or in other terms, proving hereditary descent to have a relation primarily to genus or natural family&quot;. This way, he could lay claim to a stability in the natural order at the level of the genus, but let species be extinguished. Man was a genus; not a species.

== Evolution ==
According to Richards, &quot;The Races of Men&quot; advocated &quot;a common material origin of life and its evolution by a process of saltatory descent&quot;; that is to say, new species arose not by gradual change but by sudden leaps due to shifts in embryonic development. Knox tentatively concluded that &quot;simple animals ... may have produced by continuous generation the more complex animals of after ages . . . the fish of the early world may have produced reptiles, then again birds and quadrupeds; lastly, man himself?&quot; Newly formed species survived or perished according to external conditions, which acted as &quot;potent checks to an infinite variety of forms&quot;. For one contemporary reviewer, his claim that &quot;Species is the product of external circumstances, acting through millions of years&quot; was &quot;bold, disgusting, and gratuitous atheism.&quot; In modern terms, he proposed a theory of saltatory evolution, in which &quot;deformations&quot; in embryonic development produced &quot;hopeful monsters&quot; that, if fortuitously suited to the prevailing environmental conditions, gave rise to new species in a single, macroevolutionary leap. In 1857 he wrote: &quot;The conversion of one of these species into another cannot be so difficult a matter with Nature, especially when all or most of the specific characters are already present in the young. Thus a given species may perish, but another of the same consanguinité takes its place in space: it is a question of time... Thus parenté extends from species to genus and from genus to class and order, in characters not to be misunderstood.&quot;

==Legacy==
Knox is commemorated in the scientific name of a species of African lizard, &quot;Meroles knoxii&quot;.

<text>Philip Glenn Whalen (October 20, 1923 – June 26, 2002) was an American poet, Zen Buddhist, and a key figure in the San Francisco Renaissance and close to the Beat generation.

==Biography==
Born in Portland, Oregon, Whalen grew up in The Dalles from age four until he returned to Portland in 1941. He served in the US Army Air Forces during World War II. He attended Reed College on the GI Bill. There, he met Gary Snyder and Lew Welch, and graduated with a BA in 1951. He read at the famous Six Gallery reading in 1955 that marked the launch of the West Coast Beats into the public eye. He appears, in barely fictionalized form, as the character &quot;Warren Coughlin&quot; in Jack Kerouac&#x27;s &quot;The Dharma Bums&quot;, which includes an account of that reading. In &quot;Big Sur&quot; he is called &quot;Ben Fagan&quot;. Whalen&#x27;s poetry was featured in Donald Allen&#x27;s anthology &quot;The New American Poetry 1945-1960&quot;.

Whalen&#x27;s first interest in Eastern religions centered on Vedanta. Upon release from the army in 1946, he visited the Vedanta Society in Portland, but did not pursue this very far, because of the expense of attending their countryside ashram. Tibetan Buddhism also attracted him, but he found it &quot;unnecessarily complicated.&quot; In 1952, Gary Snyder lent him books on Zen by D. T. Suzuki. With Snyder, Whalen attended a study group at the Jōdo Shinshū Buddhist Church in Berkeley. Ultimately, Zen became his chosen path.

Whalen spent 1966 and 1967 in Kyoto, Japan, assisted by a grant from the American Academy of Arts and Letters and a job teaching English. There, he practiced zazen daily, and wrote some forty poems and a second novel.

He moved into the San Francisco Zen Center and became a student of Zentatsu Richard Baker in 1972. The following year, he became a monk. He became head monk of Dharma Sangha, in Santa Fe, New Mexico in 1984. In 1987, he received transmission from Baker, and in 1991, he returned to San Francisco to lead the Hartford Street Zen Center until ill health forced him to retire.

<text>A junction, in the context of rail transport, is a place at which two or more rail routes converge or diverge. The physical connection between the tracks of the two routes (assuming they are of the same gauge) is provided by turnouts (US: switches) and signalling.

==Overview==
In a simple case where two routes with one or two tracks each meet at a junction, a fairly simple layout of tracks suffices to allow trains to transfer from one route to the other. More complicated junctions are needed to permit trains to travel in either direction after joining the new route – for example by providing a triangular track layout.

Rail transport operations refer to stations that lie on or near a railway junction as a &quot;junction station&quot;. In the UK it is customary for the junction (and the related station) to be named after the next station on the branch, e.g. Yeovil Junction is on the mainline railway south of Yeovil, and the next destination on the branch is Yeovil Pen Mill. Frequently, trains are built up and taken apart (separated) at such stations so that the same train can be divided and proceed to multiple destinations. For goods trains (US: freight trains), marshalling yards (US: Classification yards) serve a similar purpose.

==Measures to improve junction capacity==
The capacity of the junctions limits the capacity of a railway network more than the capacity of individual railway lines. This applies more as the network density increases. Measures to improve junctions are often more useful than building new railway lines. The capacity of a railway junction can be increased with improved signaling measures, by building points suitable for higher speeds, or by turning level junctions into flying junctions, where tracks are grade-separated, and so one track passes over or under another. With more complicated junctions such construction can rapidly become very expensive, especially if space is restricted by tunnels, bridges or inner-city tracks.

==Avoiding the need for junctions==

The installation of junctions into a rail system poses many challenges, including increased maintenance costs, and problems in on-time performance. Metro rail systems have a rail network design where the number of junctions is minimized. Passengers, and not trains, move from one train station to another.

<text>Carlo Emilio Gadda (; 14 November 1893 – 21 May 1973) was an Italian writer and poet. He belongs to the tradition of the language innovators, writers who played with the somewhat stiff standard pre-war Italian language, and added elements of dialects, technical jargon and wordplay.

== Biography ==
Gadda was a practising engineer from Milan, and he both loved and hated his job. Critics have compared him to other writers with a scientific background, such as Primo Levi, Robert Musil and Thomas Pynchon—a similar spirit of exactitude pervades some of Gadda&#x27;s books. Among Gadda&#x27;s styles and genres are baroque, expressionism and grotesque.

Carlo Emilio Gadda was born in Milan in 1893, and he was always intensely Milanese, although late in his life Florence and Rome also became an influence. Gadda&#x27;s nickname is &quot;Il gran Lombardo&quot;, The Great Lombard: a reference to the famous lines 70-3 of Paradiso XVII, which predict the protection Dante would receive from Bartolomeo II della Scala of Verona during his exile from Florence: &quot;Lo primo tuo refugio e &#x27;l primo ostello / sarà la cortesia del gran Lombardo/ che &#x27;n su la scala porta il santo uccello&quot; (&quot;Your first refuge and inn shall be the courtesy of the great Lombard, who bears on the ladder the sacred bird&quot;).

Gadda&#x27;s father died in 1909, leaving the family in reduced economic conditions; Gadda&#x27;s mother, however, never tried to adopt a more modest style of life. The paternal business ineptitude and the maternal obsession for keeping &quot;face&quot; and appearances turn up strongly in &quot;La cognizione del dolore&quot;.

He studied in Milan, and while studying at the Politecnico di Milano (a university specialized in engineering and architecture), he volunteered for World War I. During the war, he was a lieutenant of the Alpini corps and led a machine-gun team. He was taken prisoner with his squad during the battle of Caporetto in October 1917; his brother was killed in a plane—and this death features prominently in &quot;La cognizione del dolore&quot;. Gadda, who was a fervent nationalist at the time, was deeply humiliated by the months he had to spend in a German POW camp.

After the war, in 1920, Gadda finally graduated. He practised as an engineer until 1935, spending three of those years in Argentina. Among Gadda&#x27;s less well-known achievements is the construction, as an engineer, of the Vatican Power Station for Pius XI. The country at that time was experiencing a booming economy, and Gadda used the experience for the fictional South American-cum-Brianza setting of &quot;La Cognizione del Dolore&quot;. After that, in the 1940s, he dedicated himself to literature. These were the years of fascism, which found him a grumbling and embittered pessimist. With age, his bitterness and misanthropy somewhat intensified.

In &quot;Eros e Priapo&quot; (1945) Gadda analyzes the collective phenomena that favoured the rise of Italian Fascism, the Italian fascination with Benito Mussolini. It explains Fascism as an essentially bourgeois movement. &quot;Eros e Priapo&quot; was refused in 1945 by a magazine for its allegedly obscene content, and would only be published for the first time in 1967, by Garzanti. The 1967 edition, however, was expurgated of some of what Gadda considered the most heavy satiric strokes. The unexpurgated original 1945 edition will be published in 2013.

In 1946, the magazine &quot;Letteratura&quot; published, in five episodes, the crime novel &quot;Quer pasticciaccio brutto de via Merulana&quot;, which was translated into English as &quot;That Awful Mess on Via Merulana&quot;. It experiments heavily with language, borrowing a great deal from several Italian dialects. It is also notable for not telling whodunnit at the end.

There is some debate amongst scholars as regards Gadda&#x27;s sexual orientation. In his book on the homosexual painter Filippo De Pisis, writer Giovanni Comisso (also gay) described an evening in which he and De Pisis went for a beer with Gadda and philologist Gianfranco Contini, during the course of which Gadda asked De Pisis to summarize the various types of &quot;irregular&quot; love. According to Italo Calvino (Introduction to &quot;That Awful Mess on the Via Merulana&quot;, 1984) Gadda was &quot;a bachelor oppressed by a paralyzing shyness in any female presence.&quot; Certainly, his work demonstrates a strongly subversive attitude towards bourgeois values, expressed above all by a discordant use of language interspersed with dialect, academic and technical jargon and dirty talk. This is particularly interesting as the criticism of the bourgeois life comes, as it were, from the inside, with the former engineer cutting a respectable figure in genteel poverty.

Gadda kept writing until his death, in 1973. The most important critic of Gadda was Gianfranco Contini.

In 2017, the Swedish Academy published after 50 years the secret list of nominations for the 1966 Nobel Prize for Literature. Gadda was nominated for the first time by the Italo-American linguist and polyglot Mario Andrew Pei.

<text>Trump Shuttle, Inc. was an airline owned by Donald Trump from 1989 to 1992. The landing rights and some of the physical assets necessary to operate the shuttle flights were originally part of Eastern Air Lines and known as the Eastern Air Lines Shuttle. It operated hourly flights on Boeing 727 aircraft from LaGuardia Airport in New York City to Boston Logan International Airport in Boston, Massachusetts and Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport in Washington, D.C., as well as charter service to other destinations. Its IATA designator code was TB (later reassigned to Jetairfly, which became TUI fly Belgium).

Trump&#x27;s formal launch in the air business occurred in March 1988 when he acquired three Sikorsky S-61 helicopters that belonged to Resorts International Airlines (RIA) used to shuttle high rollers to the Resorts Casino Hotel in Atlantic City, New Jersey. The three green and orange helicopters were repainted black and red and emblazoned with the Trump Air logo.

== History ==
=== Formation ===
In the late 1980s, both Eastern Air Lines and Pan American World Airways operated air shuttle services in the Northeastern United States, which were highly profitable even though the two airlines, as a whole, were not. As the financial outlook for Eastern became more pessimistic in the late 1980s, the carrier began to sell its routes and aircraft. It organized its profitable shuttle operation into a separate company, headed by Bruce Nobles, with the intent of selling it to raise cash.

Eastern chairman Frank Lorenzo met Donald Trump at a party, and subsequently negotiated the sale of the shuttle to Trump for $365 million, more than the projected cost to start up a similar airline, but justifiable if the airline achieved a high market share. For that price, Trump got a fleet of 17 Boeing 727s, landing facilities in each of the three cities that the shuttle flew to, and the right to put his name on the company and its airplanes. The shuttle had previously been a &quot;no-frills&quot; operation for business travelers, but Trump announced that he would convert it to a luxury airline.

After reaching an agreement with Trump in October 1988, Eastern filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Many passengers switched to the competing Pan Am Shuttle, and the previously profitable Eastern Shuttle began losing money. Trump attempted to use the situation to negotiate a lower price and to acquire additional aircraft from Eastern. America West Airlines submitted a more attractive competing offer on May 10, but failed as its financing was not in place. Trump&#x27;s offer was approved by the bankruptcy court in May 1989. In June 1989 the deal was completed, financed through a loan from a syndicate of banks led by Citibank.

The new Trump Shuttle operation launched on June 8, 1989, and by the end of August had returned to a strong market share of 40-50%. Trump pushed to make the new shuttle a luxury service and a marketing vehicle for the Trump name. Its aircraft were newly painted in white livery and the interiors redecorated with such features as maple wood veneer, chrome seat belt latches, and gold colored lavatory fixtures. The airline also was a leader in the adoption of advanced technologies: It introduced some of the first passenger self-service check-in kiosks, in coordination with Kinetics, at its LaGuardia base; and partnered with LapStop, a startup firm that rented laptop computers to passengers. The airline was also an early adopter of the GTE Airfone in-flight telephone system. Flights offered free meals, including chicken and steak on some flights, as well as complimentary champagne, beer and wine. Both Trump and Pan Am spent millions on advertising campaigns around this time in an attempt to maintain strong competitive positions.

=== August 1989 incident ===
In August 1989, a Trump Shuttle flight arriving in Boston incurred a nose gear failure upon landing due to maintenance errors by Eastern personnel prior to the acquisition. Trump personally flew on the next Trump Shuttle flight to Boston in order to manage the public reaction to the incident.

=== Financial difficulties ===
The company was never profitable. Passenger traffic on the shuttle began to decline in November 1989. In late 1989, the Northeastern United States entered an economic recession which depressed demand, while the August 1990 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait caused jet fuel prices to double. While costs of running the airline rose, many of the corporate customers using the shuttle were cutting travel budgets. Trump&#x27;s casino business was simultaneously encountering serious difficulties, and Trump was forced to cede control over several business holdings to his bankers in June 1990 in order to avoid personal bankruptcy. The airline ran out of cash and defaulted on its debt in September 1990.

Trump Shuttle conducted some charter operations around this time to monetize the shuttle&#x27;s spare aircraft. In June 1990, the airline carried Nelson Mandela on his eight-city tour of the United States. During the Gulf War of 1990–91, the airline received a government contract to ferry U.S. military personnel between the key domestic bases of Dover AFB, Charleston AFB, Travis AFB, McChord AFB, and Kelly AFB.

=== Sale ===
Trump had personally guaranteed $135 million of the shuttle&#x27;s debt. Following the default, Citibank made arrangements for Northwest Airlines to take control of the shuttle in exchange for relieving Trump&#x27;s personal liability on its debt, and all sides were reportedly close to an agreement by April 1991. Delta Air Lines agreed to buy the competing Pan Am Shuttle in July, and Northwest announced that its acquisition of the Trump Shuttle was cancelled in August, reportedly due to the Trump Shuttle&#x27;s unions demanding parity with Northwest employees and Trump refusing to discount the price to reflect this. USAir ultimately reached an agreement in December 1991 to take operational control of Trump Shuttle for up to ten years, with an option to buy it after five years. Bankers involved in the negotiations said that Trump would be relieved of at least $100 million of his guarantee, and possibly as much as $110 million, leaving him owing between $25 and $35 million in the closing out of his ownership of the company.

On April 7, 1992, Trump Shuttle ceased to exist when it was merged into a new corporation, Shuttle, Inc., which began operating as the USAir Shuttle on April 12, 1992. US Airways subsequently purchased the remainder of Shuttle, Inc., on November 19, 1997, and the service subsequently operated under the name US Airways Shuttle. Shuttle, Inc., remained as a subsidiary of US Air Group until July 1, 2000, when it was merged into US Airways. In October 2015, US Airways merged with American Airlines, at which point the shuttle became the American Airlines Shuttle.

== Helicopter service ==
Trump Air operated a scheduled helicopter service between LaGuardia Airport and Wall Street Heliport to provide connections with Trump Shuttle flights at LaGuardia.

Trump Air also operated between New York City and East Hampton Airport from 1989 to 1992, and between West 30th Street Heliport and Steeplechase Pier in Atlantic City to serve Trump&#x27;s casinos. It used a combination of Sikorsky S-61 and Boeing Chinook helicopters. It was established on March 22, 1988, with three Sikorsky S-61 helicopters, which could carry 24 passengers each, with service between the West 30th Street Heliport in Manhattan and Bader Field and the Steeplechase Pier in Atlantic City. Fares were from $49–125, and travel time was 48 minutes. One of the helicopters had already been operating for about a month. Trump had acquired the helicopters, which had been Resorts International Air, as part of his 1988 deal with Merv Griffin following Griffin&#x27;s takeover of Resorts International Inc.

<doc id="793911" wikidata="Q431164" url="?curid=793911" title="Arab Christians">
<text>Arab Christians () are the Arabs who adhere to Christianity. The number of Arab Christians who live in the Middle East was estimated in 2012 to be between 10 and 15 million. Arab Christian communities can be found throughout the Arab world, but are concentrated in the Eastern Mediterranean region of the Levant and Egypt, with smaller communities present throughout the Arabian Peninsula and North Africa.

The history of Arab Christians coincides with the history of Eastern Christianity and the history of the Arabic language; Arab Christian communities either result from pre-existing Christian communities adopting the Arabic language, or from pre-existing Arabic-speaking communities adopting Christianity. The jurisdictions of three of the five patriarchates of the Pentarchy primarily became Arabic-speaking after the early Muslim conquests – the Church of Alexandria, the Church of Antioch and the Church of Jerusalem – and over time many of their adherents adopted the Arabic language and culture. Separately, a number of early Arab kingdoms and tribes adopted Christianity, including the Nabataeans, Lakhmids, Salihids, Tanukhids, ʿIbādī of al-Hira, and the Ghassanids.

In modern times, Arab Christians have played important roles in the Nahda movement, and they have significantly influenced and contributed to the fields of literature, politics, business, philosophy, music, theatre and cinema, medicine, and science. Today Arab Christians still play important roles in the Arab world, and are relatively wealthy, well educated, and politically moderate. Emigrants from Arab Christian communities also make up a significant proportion of the Middle Eastern diaspora, with sizable population concentrations across the Americas, most notably in Brazil, Argentina, Venezuela, Colombia, and the US. However those emigrants to the Americas, especially from the first wave of emigration, have often not passed the Arabic language to their descendants.

The concept of an Arab Christian identity remains contentious, with some Arabic-speaking Christian groups in the Middle East, such as Assyrians, Armenians, Greeks and others, rejecting an Arab identity. Individuals from Egypt&#x27;s Coptic Christian community and Lebanon&#x27;s Maronite community sometimes assume a non-Arab identity.

== History ==
The history of Arab Christians coincides with the history of Christianity and the history of the Arabic language; Arab Christian communities result either from pre-existing Christian communities adopting the Arabic language, or from pre-existing Arabic-speaking communities adopting Christianity. Arab Christians include the indigenous Christian communities of Western Asia who became majority Arabic-speaking after the consequent seventh-century Muslim conquests in the Fertile Crescent. The Christian Arab presence predates the early Muslim conquests, and there were many Arab tribes that converted to Christianity, beginning in the 1st century.

The interests of the Arabs before the 9th century A.D. were focused primarily on the recording and translating of pre-Islamic poetry. The early Arab Christians recorded Syriac hymns, Arabic poetry, ecclesiastical melodies, proverbs, and ḥikam (rules of governance). They did not otherwise record religion, which gave way to conflicting accounts and sparse evidence for specific practices over several centuries.

From classical antiquity to modern times, Arab Christians have played important roles contributing to the culture of the Mashriq, in particular those in the Levant, Egypt and Iraq.

=== Pre-Islamic period ===
The New Testament has a biblical account of Arab conversion to Christianity recorded in the Book of Acts. When Saint Peter preaches to the people of Jerusalem, they ask,And how hear we every man in our own tongue, wherein we were born? [...] Arabians, we do hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of God. (Acts 2:8, 11 KJV)The first mention of Christianity in Arabia occurs in the New Testament as the Apostle Paul references his journey to Arabia following his conversion (Galatians 1: 15–17). Later, Eusebius discusses a bishop named Beryllus in the see of Bostra, the site of a synod c. 240 AD and two Councils of Arabia. The New Testament signals an early entry of Christianity among the Arabs; in addition to what was narrated by al-Tabari, Abu al-Fida, al-Maqrizi, Ibn Khaldun and al-Masoudi, the disciples of Christ (including Matthew, Bartholomew and Thaddeus) were the ones who went to Arabia as preachers of the religion. Sozomen of Gaza said that the Arabs converted to Christianity through the efforts of priests and monks who spread to Arab regions, and the strength of Christianity increased with the conversion of the major tribes. The religion was organised in many dioceses controlled by bishops and archbishops. The Arab bishops were divided into types: urban bishops residing in cities, and “tent bishops” who resided in tents and moved with their tribes from one place to another. The number of Arab bishops among the Nabataeans alone reached forty according to Ibn Durayd. The first Arab bishop of the Arabs, Saint Moses, spent many years in the 4th century as a hermit between Syria and Egypt. His piety impressed Mawiyya, Arab warrior-queen of the Tanukhids, and she made his consecration as a bishop over her people a condition to any truce with Rome. 
The Jordan Valley and the Balqa was under Arab Christian rule by the second century AD. The Nabataeans, natives of the southern Levant, also converted to Christianity in the Late Roman Period. In Palmyra and near al-Qaryatayn there are Christian monuments and the remains of churches and inscriptions that indicate the spread of the religion into Syria proper. The administration of Jordan under Roman rule was given to the Quda&#x27;a tribe. This tribe had embraced Christianity according to Ya&#x27;qubi, and were later succeeded by the Christian Salihids and Ghassanid Kingdom. There are poetic verses by the pre-Islamic poet al-Nabigha in which he praises the kings of Ghassan, congratulating them on Palm Sunday. Bordering Syria, the Sinai was administratively affiliated with the Egyptian Church based in Alexandria. There are documents from the late third century of Dionysius, Pope of Alexandria, in which he mentions his Arab Christian subjects in the Sinai and the persecution they faced during the days of the pagan Roman emperor Diocletian. Later, forty martyrs fell in 309 in Mount Sinai during a raid by pagan Arabs on their hermitages. The monks fortified their new monasteries, and the most fortified is still in use today, Saint Catherine&#x27;s Monastery, built by the commission of Roman emperor Justinian in 565. It has hosted a number of Church bishops and theologians, Ghassanid and Lakhmid kings, and pre-Islamic poets.
The southern Arabian city of Najran was made famous by the religious persecution of Christians by one of the kings of Yemen, Dhu Nuwas, who was an enthusiastic convert to Judaism. The leader of the Arabs of Najran during the period, al-Ḥārith, was canonized by the Catholic Church as Arethas. Aretas was the leader of the Christians of Najran in the early 6th century and was executed during the massacre of Christians by the king in 523. Ibn Khaldun, Ibn Hisham and Yaqut al-Hamawi mentioned that Najran was entirely Christian when Dhu al-Nawas converted to Judaism, and that the people of Najran refused to convert to his faith, so he massacred them. The victims were mentioned by Ibn Ishaq and named in the Quran as the &quot;People of the Ditch&quot;. The Byzantine emperor Justin I was enraged and encouraged Kaleb of Axum to occupy Yemen and eliminate the Jewish king. Dhu al-Nawas was later deposed and killed, prompting Kaleb to appoint a native Christian Himyarite, Sumyafa Ashwa, as his viceroy. The Aksumites thus conquered Himyar and their rule lasted until 575. The Abyssinians spread Christianity and their rulers built an extravagant building in honor of the Martyrs of Najran. It was known by its contemporaries for its beauty, adorned with ornaments, jewels, and prominent archways. Arabs called it the “Kaaba of Najran”. The Yemenis later rebelled against the Abyssinians and demanded independence. History records Christian influence from Ethiopia to Arab lands in pre-Islamic times, and some Ethiopian Christians may have lived in Mecca. 

Yemen had an important share in ancient Christianity. In the second century, the Greek theologian Pantaenus left Alexandria and headed towards Yemen as a missionary after his conversion. Historians such as Rufinus and Orosius mentioned that Matthew the Apostle was the missionary of Yemen and Abyssinia. A special relationship developed between the people of Yemen and the Syrian Church, as inferred by the works of Ephrem the Syrian, the biography of Simeon Stylites, and the historian Philostorgius, who said that some villages and settlements established in Yemen were Syriac-speaking. The famous Al-Qalis Church in Sana&#x27;a was built to serve aderents and to attract pilgrims travelling to the Kaaba of Mecca and Ghamdan Palace. On the organizational level, the Archbishop of Yemen held the title &quot;Catholicos&quot; which follows the &quot;Patriarch&quot;&quot;&quot; in rank. The spread of Christianity amongst Arabs reached Upper Mesopotamia, where Banu Bakr and Banu Mudar lived, both famous for their staunch Christian beliefs and for honoring Sergius the Military Saint. Ibn Khallikan mentioned that all the Yemeni Arabs in Iraq converted to Christianity, including Taym al-Lat, Kalb, Lakhm and Tanukh, and many had moved towards Bahrain by the fourth century.

In Medina there was a Christian sect that was rejected by the official church and considered heretical. They deified the Virgin Mary and gave her offerings. This sect was mentioned by a number of historians, including Epiphanius and Ibn Taymiyya, who called them &quot;The Marians&quot; (&quot;Al-Maryamiyyun&quot;). Likewise, al-Zamakhshari and al-Baydawi referred to this sect in their interpretation of the Qur’an. Another sect called &quot;The Davidians&quot; (&quot;Al-Dāwudiyyūn&quot;) were known for their exaggerations in honoring King David. Some contemporary historians classified it as a Judeo-Christian heresy. In Mecca, the Banu Jurhum embraced Christianity at the hands of their sixth king, Abd al-Masih ibn Baqia, and supervised the service of the Haram for a period of time. Banu Azd and Banu Khuza’a became Christians with them according to Abu al-Faraj al-Isfahani. The earliest indications of Christianity in Mecca is the Christian cemetery outside the Medina towards the well of &#x27;Anbasa, confirmed by al-Maqdisi, as well as the conversion to Christianity by some members of the Quraysh.

=== Islamic era ===

Following the fall of large portions of former Byzantine and Sasanian provinces to the Arab armies, a large indigenous Christian population of varying ethnicities came under Arab Muslim dominance. Historically, a number of minority Christian sects were persecuted as heretic under Byzantine rule (such as non-Chalcedonians). The Islamic conquests set forth two processes affecting these Christian communities: the process of Arabization, causing them gradually to adopt Arabic as a spoken, literary, and liturgical language (often alongside their ancestral tongues), and the much slower, yet persistent process of Islamization. As Muslim army commanders expanded their empire and attacked countries in Asia, North Africa and southern Europe, they would offer three conditions to their enemies: convert to Islam, pay jizya (tax) every year, or face war to death. Those who refused war and refused to convert were deemed to have agreed to pay jizya.

As &quot;People of the Book&quot;, Christians in the region were accorded certain rights under Islamic law to practice their religion (including having Christian law used for rulings, settlements or sentences in court). In contrast to Muslims, who paid the zakat tax, they paid the jizya, an obligatory tax. The jizya was not levied on slaves, women, children, monks, the old, the sick, hermits, or the poor. In return, non-Muslim citizens were permitted to practice their faith, to enjoy a measure of communal autonomy, to be entitled to Muslim state&#x27;s protection from outside aggression, to be exempted from military service, and to be exempted from the zakat. Like Arab Muslims, Arab Christians refer to God as &quot;Allah&quot;. As with the Christians of Malta, this practice is distinguished from the Islamic use of the word &quot;Allah&quot; which refers to the personal name of God in that faith. The use of the term Allah in Arab churches predates Islam.

During the Islamic Golden Age, Christians contributed to the Islamic civilization in various fields, and the institution known as the House of Wisdom employed Christian scholars to translate works into Arabic and to develop new knowledge.

=== Modern Era ===
Arab Christians have always been the go-between the Islamic world and the Christian West, mainly down to mutual religious affinity. The Greek Orthodox share Orthodox ties with Russia and Greece; whilst Melkites and Maronites share Catholic bonds with Italy, Vatican and France. Scholars and intellectuals agree Christians in the Arab world have made significant contributions to Arab civilization since the introduction of Islam, and they have had a notable impact contributing the culture of the Mashriq. Many Arab Christians today are physicians, entertainers, philosophers, government officials and people of literature.

==== Academia ====
Arab Christians throughout history have been noted for their impact on academia and literature. Arabic-speaking Christian scholars wrote extensive theological and philosophical works and treatises in Arabic in which they not only responded to the polemics of their Muslim adversaries, but also provided systematic apologetic discussions of the Christian faith and practice. Notable Lebanese academics in the modern era include Carmelite linguist Anastas al-Karmal, novelist Tawfiq Yusuf &#x27;Awwad, and philologist Ibrahim al-Yaziji, whose Bible translations were among the first in the modern Arabic language. There are many New Testament translations or portions into regional colloquial forms of Arabic. Noted Palestinian physician and ethnographer Tawfiq Canaan&#x27;s academic work serves as valuable resources to researchers of Palestinian history. Jordanian historian Suleiman Mousa was the only author to write about Lawrence of Arabia and show the Arab perspective. Mousa noted that there were many books written to praise Lawrence, and all of them exaggerated his part in the Arab Revolt and failed to do justice to the Arabs themselves. Syrian writers include scholar Francis Marrash and writer Hanna Mina, described in &quot;Literature from the &quot;Axis of Evil&quot;&quot; as the country&#x27;s most prominent.

==== Politics ====

Arab Christians were among the first Arab nationalists. As early as 1877, Maronite leader Youssef Bey Karam proposed to Emir Abdelkader the separation of the Arabic-speaking provinces from the Ottoman Empire using the terms &quot;al-gins al-&#x27;arabi&quot; (&quot;Arab race&quot;) and &quot;gaba&#x27;il al-arabiya&quot; (&quot;Arab tribes&quot;). In the early 20th century, many prominent Arab nationalists were Christians, like the Syrian intellectual Constantin Zureiq, Ba&#x27;athism proponent Michel Aflaq, and Jurji Zaydan, who was reputed to be the first Arab nationalist. Khalil al-Sakakini, a prominent Palestinian Jerusalemite, was Arab Orthodox, as was George Antonius, Lebanese author of &quot;The Arab Awakening.&quot; Grégoire Haddad, known as the &quot;Red Bishop of Beirut&quot;, founded the &quot;Lebanese Social Movement&quot; with Shiite Imam Musa al-Sadr in 1960, and promoted in the following years Islamic-Christian dialogue. The first Syrian nationalists were also Christian. Although both Lebanese, Antoun Saadeh was the founder behind the Syrian Social Nationalist Party and Butrus al-Bustani is considered to be the first Syrian nationalist. Sa&#x27;adeh rejected Pan-Arabism and argued instead for the creation of a &quot;United Syrian Nation&quot; or &quot;Natural Syria&quot;. George Habash, founder of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine was Arab Orthodox, and so was Wadie Haddad, the leader of the PFLP&#x27;s armed wing. Influential Palestinian Christians such as Tawfik Toubi, Daud Turki, Emile Touma and Emile Habibi became leaders of the Israeli and Palestinian communist party. Nayif Hawatmeh is the founder and leader of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, and Kamal Nasser and Hanan Ashrawi were members of the PLO Executive Committee.

==== Media ====
Christians developed Arabic-speaking Christian media, including various newspapers, radio stations, and television networks such as Télé Lumière, Aghapy TV, CTV, and SAT-7, which is a Christian broadcasting network that was founded in 1995; it targets primarily Arab Christians in North Africa and the Middle East. These media networks produce dozens of Arabic-language Christian films, musical works, as well as radio and television programmes.

Syro-Lebanese Melkite Saleem Takla and his brother Beshara founded the &quot;Al-Ahram&quot; newspaper in 1875 in Alexandria; now the most widely circulated Egyptian daily newspaper. Similarly, Lebanese Protestant Faris Nimr co-founded &quot;Al Muqattam&quot; in 1888, a leading Cairo-based newspaper in circulation until 1954. In Palestine, Najib Nassar&#x27;s newspaper &quot;Al-Karmil&quot; was the first anti-Zionist weekly newspaper. It appeared in Haifa in 1908 and was shut down by the British in the 1940s. Likewise, the Arab Orthodox El-Issa family from Jaffa founded the &quot;Falastin&quot; newspaper in 1911. The paper was Palestine&#x27;s most consistent critic of the early Zionist movement. In Lebanon, the influential Greek Orthodox Tueni family founded the &quot;An-Nahar&quot; newspaper in 1933, also one of the leading newspapers today. Shireen Abu Akleh worked as a reporter for the Arabic-language channel Al Jazeera for 25 years.

Popular Lebanese singer Fairuz has over 150 million records sold worldwide, making her the highest selling Middle-Eastern artist of all time. Other Lebanese singers include Majida El Roumi, legendary folk veteran Wadih El Safi, &#x27;Queen of Arab pop&#x27; Nancy Ajram, and Lydia Canaan. Syrian notables include George Wassouf and Nassif Zeytoun. Palestinians include Lina Makhul, Fadee Andrawos, and Israeli singer Mira Awad.

==== Role in Al-Nahda ====

The Nahda (meaning &quot;the Awakening&quot; or &quot;the Renaissance&quot;) was a cultural renaissance that began in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It began in the wake of the exit of Muhammad Ali of Egypt from the Levant in 1840. Beirut, Cairo, Damascus and Aleppo were the main centers of the renaissance and this led to the establishment of schools, universities, theater and printing presses. This awakening led to the emergence of a politically active movement known as the &quot;association&quot; that was accompanied by the birth of Arab nationalism and the demand for reformation in the Ottoman Empire. This led to the calling of the establishment of modern states based on Europe. It was during this stage that the first compound of the Arabic language was introduced along with the printing of it in letters, and later the movement influenced the fields of music, sculpture, history, humanities, economics and human rights.

This cultural renaissance during the late Ottoman rule was a quantum leap for Arabs in the post-industrial revolution, and is not limited to the individual fields of cultural renaissance in the nineteenth century, as the Nahda only extended to include the spectrum of society and the fields as a whole. Christian colleges (accepting of all faiths) like Saint Joseph University, American University of Beirut (Syrian Protestant College until 1920) and Al-Hikma University in Baghdad amongst others played a prominent role in the development of Arab culture. It is agreed amongst historians the importance the roles played by the Arab Christians in this renaissance, and their role in the prosperity through participation in the diaspora. Given this role in politics and culture, Ottoman ministers began to include them in their governments. In the economic sphere, a number of Christian families like the Greek Orthodox Sursock family became prominent. Thus, the Nahda led the Muslims and Christians to a cultural renaissance and national general despotism. This solidified Arab Christians as one of the pillars of the region and not a minority on the fringes.

==== Religious Persecution ====
The Massacre of Aleppo of 1850 often referred to simply as The Events was a riot perpetrated by Muslim residents of Aleppo, largely from the eastern quarters of the city, against Christian residents, largely located in the northern suburbs of the predominantly Christian neighbourhood Judayde (Jdeideh) and Salibeh. The Events are considered by historians to be particularly important in Aleppian history, for they represent the first time disturbances pitted Muslims against Christians in the region. The patriarch of the Syriac Catholic Church Peter VII Jarweh was fatally wounded in the attacks and died a year later. 20–70 people died from rioting and 5,000 died as a result of bombardment.
The 1860 civil conflict in Mount Lebanon and Damascus was a civil conflict and later massacre during Ottoman rule, started by skirmishes occurring between the Maronites and the Druze of Mount Lebanon. Following decisive victories and massacres against Christians, the conflict spilled over into other parts of Ottoman Syria, particularly the city Damascus, where over ten thousand Christian residents of various denominations were killed by Druze and Muslim militiamen. With the connivance of the military authorities and Turkish soldiers, Druze and allied paramilitary groups organised pogroms in Damascus which lasted three days (9–11 July). By the war&#x27;s end, around 20,000 Christians had been killed, and many villages and churches were destroyed. The Christian quarter of old Damascus was destroyed and houses were plundered. Historian Mikhail Mishaqas&#x27; memoir of the massacre is valuable to historians, as it is the only account written by a survivor of a mob attack. Emir Abdelkader al-Jazairi, the exiled Algerian Muslim military leader, ordered his sons and soldiers to protect and shelter Damascene Christians from impending interpersonal violence that was spreading throughout the city, thereby saving thousands, preserving this ancient community from complete devastation.

Melkite Greek Catholic and Maronite Christians suffered negligence from the Ottoman authorities and a naval blockade from France and Britain, resulting in the Great Famine of Mount Lebanon (1915–1918) during World War I, which ran in conjunction with the Armenian genocide, the Assyrian genocide and the Greek genocide. The Mount Lebanon famine caused the highest fatality rate by population during World War I. Around 200,000 people starved to death when the population of Mount Lebanon was estimated to be 400,000 people. The Lebanese diaspora in Egypt funded the shipping of food supplies to Mount Lebanon, sent via the Syrian Island town of Arwad. On 26 May 1916, Lebanese-American writer Khalil Gibran wrote a letter to Mary Haskell that read:
&quot;The famine in Mount Lebanon has been planned and instigated by the Turkish government. Already 80,000 have succumbed to starvation and thousands are dying every single day. The same process happened with the Christian Armenians and applied to the Christians in Mount Lebanon.&quot;
==== Regional Conflicts ====
During the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, a number of Palestinian Greek Orthodox and Melkite communities were ethnically cleansed and driven out of their towns, including al-Bassa, Ramla, Lod, Safed, Kafr Bir&#x27;im, Iqrit, Tarbikha, Eilabun and Haifa. Many Christian towns or neighborhoods were ethnically cleansed and destroyed during the period between 1948 and 1953. All the Christian residents of Safed, Beisan, Tiberias were removed, and a big percentage displaced in Haifa, Jaffa, Lydda and Ramleh. Arab Christian Constantin Zureiq was the first to coin the term &quot;Nakba&quot; in reference to the 1948 Palestinian exodus.

In 1975, the Lebanese Civil War occurred between two broad camps, the mainly Christian &#x27;rightist&#x27; Lebanese Front consisting of Maronites and Melkites, and the mainly Muslim and Arab nationalist &#x27;leftist&#x27; National Movement, supported by the Druze, Greek Orthodox and the Palestinian community. The war was characterized by the kidnap, rape and massacre of those caught in the wrong place as each side eliminated &#x27;enemy&#x27; enclaves – mainly Christian or Muslim low-income areas. In Lebanon, Maronites and Melkites looked to France and the Mediterranean world, whereas most Muslims and Greek Orthodox Christians looked to the Arab hinterland as their political lodestar. In 1982 Israel invaded Lebanon with the aim of destroying the PLO, which it besieged in West Beirut. Israel was later obliged to withdraw as a result of multiple guerrilla attacks by the Lebanese National Resistance Front and increasing hostility across all forces in Lebanon to their presence.

With the events of the Arab Spring, the Syrian Arab Christian community was heavily hit in line with other Christian communities of Syria, being victimized by the war and specifically targeted as a minority by Jihadist forces. Many Christians, including Arab Christians, were displaced or fled Syria over the course of the Syrian Civil War. When the conflict in Syria began, it was reported that Christians were cautious and avoided taking sides, but that due to the increased violence and ISIL&#x27;s growth, Arab Christians showed support for Assad, fearing that if Assad was overthrown, they would be targeted. Christians supported the Assad regime based on the fear that the end of the current government could lead to instability. The Carnegie Middle East Center stated that the majority of Christians were more in support of the regime because they feared a chaotic situation or to be under the control of the Islamist Western and Turkish backed armed groups.

=== Arab Diaspora ===

Millions of people are descended from Arab Christians and they live outside the Middle East, in the Arab diaspora. They mainly reside in the Americas, but many people of Arab Christian descent also reside in Europe, Africa and Oceania. Among them, one million Palestinian Christians live in the Palestinian diaspora and 6–7 million Brazilians are estimated to have Lebanese ancestry. Mass Arab immigration started in the 1890s as Lebanese and Syrian people fled from the political and economic instability which was caused by the collapse of the Ottoman Empire. These early immigrants were known as Syro-Lebanese, Lebanese and Palestinians, or Turks. According to the United States census, there were at least 3.5 million Arabs living in the United States in the year 2000, with around 40% of them originating from Lebanon. The majority of them are members of the Christian faith, making up 63% of the overall Arab American population.

Historical events that caused the mass-emigration of Arab Christians include: 1860 civil conflict in Mount Lebanon and Damascus, 1915–1918 Great Famine of Mount Lebanon, 1948 Palestinian expulsion and flight, 1956–57 exodus and expulsions from Egypt, Lebanese civil war, and the Iraq war.

==== Role in Al-Mahjar ====
The Mahjar (one of its more literal meanings being &quot;the Arab diaspora&quot;) was a literary movement that succeeded the Nahda movement. It was started by Christian Arabic-speaking writers who had emigrated to America from Lebanon, Syria and Palestine at the turn of the 20th century. The writers of the Mahjar movement were stimulated by their personal encounter with the Western world and participated in the renewal of Arabic literature, hence their proponents referred to as writers of the &quot;late Nahda&quot;.

The Pen League was the first Arabic-language literary society in North America, formed initially by Syrians Nasib Arida and Abd al-Masih Haddad. Members of the Pen League included: Kahlil Gibran, Elia Abu Madi, Mikhail Naimy, and Ameen Rihani. Eight out of the ten members were Greek Orthodox and two were Maronite Christians. The league dissolved following Gibran&#x27;s death in 1931 and Mikhail Naimy&#x27;s return to Lebanon in 1932. Naimy was made famous internationally for his spiritual writings, most notably &quot;The Book of Mirdad&quot;.

==== Notable Arab Christians ====
Notable diaspora figures include Swiss businessman of Lebanese Greek Orthodox descent Nicolas Hayek, and Mexican business magnate of Maronite descent, Carlos Slim. From 2010 to 2013, Slim was ranked as the richest person in the world by the &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine. Figures in entertainment include actors Omar Sharif (Melkite-born),Jamie Farr, Salma Hayek, Tony Shalhoub, Vince Vaughn, Danny Thomas, Oscar award winner F. Murray Abraham and film director Youssef Chahine. Figures in academics include plant biologist Joanne Chory, scholar Nassim Nicholas Taleb, cardiac and vascular surgeon Michael DeBakey, inventor of the iPod and co-inventor of the iPhone Tony Fadell, mathematician Michael Atiyah, professor Charles Elachi, intellectual Edward Said, and Nobel Prize winner in Chemistry Elias James Corey and Nobel Prize winner in Physiology or Medicine Peter Medawar. Other notables include legendary White House reporter Helen Thomas, activist and presidential candidate Ralph Nader, judge Rosemary Barkett, and US governor and academic administrator Mitch Daniels.

== Identity ==
=== Denominations ===
Arab Christians mainly belong to the Greek Orthodox Church of Jerusalem, Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch, Melkite Greek Catholic Church, Maronite Church, and Oriental Orthodox Churches, though some are also members of other churches, including the Catholic Latin Church and Protestant Churches, such as the Lutheran, Anglican, and Reformed traditions.
=== Self-identification ===
The issue of self-identification arises regarding specific Christian communities across the Arab world. A significant proportion of Maronites claim descent from the Phoenicians, whilst a significant proportion of Copts claim that they descend from the Ancient Egyptians.

==== Arab ====
The designation &quot;Greek&quot; in the Greek Orthodox Church and Melkite Greek Catholic Church refers to the use of Koine Greek in liturgy, used today alongside Arabic. As a result, the Greek dominated clergy was commonplace serving the Arabic speaking Christians, the majority who couldn&#x27;t speak Greek. Some viewed Greek rule as cultural imperialism and demanded emancipation from Greek control, as well as the abolishment of the centralized structure of the institution via Arab inclusion in decision-making processes.The struggle for the Arabization of the Eastern Orthodox Church against the Greek clerical hegemony in Palestine led Orthodox Christian intellectuals to rebel against the Church&#x27;s Greek dominated hierarchy. The rebellion was divided between those who sought a common Ottoman cause against European intrusions and those who identified with Arab nationalism against pan-Turkic (Ottoman) nationalism. Its main advocates were well known community leaders and writers in Palestine, such as Ya&#x27;qub Farraj, Khalil al-Sakakini, Yusuf al-Bandak (publisher of &quot;Sawtal-Sha&#x27;b&quot;) and cousins Yousef and Issa El-Issa (founders of &quot;Falastin&quot;). The cousins were among the first to elucidate the Arab struggle against the Greek clerical hegemony of the Church of Jerusalem. Both Sakakini and El-Issa argued that the Palestinian and the Syrian (Antiochian) community constituted an oppressed majority, controlled and manipulated by a minority Greek clergy.

There have been numerous disputes between the Arab and the Greek leadership of the church in Jerusalem from the Mandate onwards. Jordan encouraged the Greeks to open the Brotherhood to Arab members of the community between 1948 and 1967 when the West Bank was under Jordanian rule. Land and political disputes have been common since 1967, with the Greek priests portrayed as collaborators with Israel. Land disputes include the sale of St. John&#x27;s property in the Christian quarter, the transfer of fifty dunams near Mar Elias Monastery, and the sale of two hotels and twenty-seven stores on Omar Bin Al-Khattab square near the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. A dispute between the Palestinian Authority and the Greek Patriarch Irenaios led to the Patriarch being dismissed and demoted because of accusations of a real estate deal with Israel. It was later ruled uncanonical by Patriarch Bartholomew.

==== Rūm ====
The homeland of the Antiochian Greek Christians, known as the Diocese of the East, was one of the major commercial, agricultural, religious, and intellectual areas of the Roman Empire, and its strategic location facing the Persian Sassanid Empire gave it exceptional military importance. They are either members of the Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch or the Melkite Greek Catholic Church, and they have ancient roots in the Levant; more specifically, the territories of Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and Hatay, which includes the city of Antakya (ancient Antioch). Antiochian Greeks constitute a multi-national group of people and thus construct their identity in relation to specific historical moments. Analyzing cultural identity as a conscious construction is more helpful than a simple labelling of ethnicity, thus the identity is assumed to accentuate the separate origin unique to the Christian Rūm (literally &quot;Eastern Romans&quot;) of the Levant. Some members of the community also call themselves Melkite, which means &quot;monarchists&quot; or &quot;supporters of the emperor&quot; (a reference to their past allegiance to Macedonian and Roman imperial rule) although in the modern era, that term tends to be more commonly used by followers of the Melkite Greek Catholic Church.

The Orthodox Christian congregation was included in an ethno-religious community, Rum Millet (&quot;Roman nation&quot;), during the Ottoman Empire. Its name was derived from the former Eastern Roman (Byzantine) subjects of the Ottoman Empire, but all Orthodox Greeks, Bulgarians, Albanians, Aromanians, Megleno-Romanians and Serbs, as well as Georgians and Middle Eastern Christians, were considered part of the same millet in spite of their differences in ethnicity and language. Belonging to this Orthodox commonwealth became more important to the common people than their ethnic origins.

==== Chaldean ====

The former Patriarch of the Chaldean Church, Emmanuel III Delly, made the following comment in a 2006 interview:&quot;Any Chaldean who calls himself an Assyrian is a traitor and any Assyrian who calls himself Chaldean is a traitor.&quot;The Chaldean Church, which had been part of the Nestorian Church, or Church of the East, until 1552–3, began in earnest to distance itself from the Nestorians who were now seen as the &#x27;uncouth Assyrians&#x27;. During this period, many Chaldeans began identifying themselves solely by their religious community, and later as Iraqis, Iraqi Christians, or Arab Christians, rather than with the Assyrian community as a whole. The first split for the two groups came in 431, when they broke away from what was to become the Catholic Church over a theological dispute. The reverberation of religious animosity between these communities still continues today, a testament to the machinations of power politics in the nation-building of the Middle East. The Iraqi Chaldeans positioned themselves deliberately as a religious group within the Arab Iraqi nation. The Arab identity of the state was not only acceptable to them, but was even staunchly endorsed. The Arab nationalism they supported did not discriminate according to religion and was therefore also acceptable to them. Today, due to both forced and accepted Arabization, many Chaldeans identify themselves situationally as Arabs.

The Assyrians form the majority of Christians in Iraq, northeast Syria, south-east Turkey and north-west Iran. They are specifically defined as &quot;non-Arab&quot; indigenous ethnic group, including by the governments of Iraq, Lebanon, Iran, Syria, Israel, and Turkey.

== Culture ==
Christianity in the Middle East represents a large part of the region&#x27;s diverse culture mosaic. The region includes the oldest Christian monuments in addition to the liturgy and hymns that have spread since the second century AD throughout the region. Translations of the Bible into Arabic are known from the early Christian churches in the Levant, Egypt, Mesopotamia, Malta, the Maghreb, and Al-Andalus. Christians produced hundreds of manuscripts containing portions of the Bible in Arabic. Christian Arabs celebrate various holy days, including the Feast of the Cross, Eid il-Burbara, Christmas, the Feast of St. George, and the Feast of the Prophet Elijah. In Christian traditions, Sergius and Bacchus are considered the patron saints of Arabs.

There are no major cultural differences between Christian Arabs and the general Arab environment. Some differences arise from religious differences, for example, customs and traditions related to marriage or burial. Also, in social events in which the participants are Christians, alcoholic beverages are often served (apart from those denominations that encourage teetotalism), unlike what is prevalent in most Arab societies because Islamic law forbids strong drink. Christian cuisine is similar to other Middle Eastern cuisines; unlike in Jewish cuisine and Islamic cuisines in the region, pork is allowed among Arab Christians, though it is not widely consumed. Male circumcision is near-universal among Christian Arabs, and they practice it shortly after birth as part of a rite of passage, though the practice of circumcision was dropped in the New Testament, meaning that the mainstream Churches do not oblige their followers to do so. In some Eastern Christian denominations, such as Coptic Christianity, male circumcision is an established practice, and require that their male members undergo circumcision shortly after birth as part of a rite of passage.

== Demographics ==

Arab Christian communities can be found throughout the Arab world.

=== Algeria ===
Christianity came to Algeria in the Roman era, and declined after the arrival of Islam in the 7th century. A notable Berber Christian of Algeria was Saint Augustine and his mother Saint Monica, important saints in Christianity. Prior to independence from France in 1962, Algeria was home to 1.4 million &quot;pieds-noirs&quot; (ethnic Europeans who were mostly Catholic). Arguably, many more Maghrebi Christians live in France than in North Africa, due to the exodus of the &quot;pieds-noirs&quot; in the 1960s.

In 2009, the percentage of Christians in Algeria was less than 2%. In this same survey, the United Nations counted 100,000 Catholics and 45,000 Protestants in the country. A 2015 study estimates 380,000 Muslims converted to Christianity in Algeria. Conversions have been most common in the region of Kabylie. Charles de Foucauld was renowned for his missions in Algeria among Muslims, including Arabs.

=== Bahrain ===
Native Christians who hold Bahraini citizenship number approximately 1,000. The majority of Christians are originally from Iraq, Palestine and Jordan, with a small minority having lived in Bahrain for many centuries; the majority have been living as Bahraini citizens for less than a century. There are also smaller numbers of native Christians who originally hail from Lebanon, Syria, and India. The majority of Christian Bahraini citizens tend to be Orthodox Christians, with the largest church by membership being the Greek Orthodox Church. They enjoy many equal religious and social freedoms. Bahrain has Christian members in the Bahraini government.

=== Egypt ===

The Copts in Egypt constitute the largest Christian community in the Middle East, as well as the largest religious minority in the region, accounting for an estimated 10% of Egyptian population.

Since antiquity, there has always been a Levantine presence in Egypt, however they started becoming a distinctive minority in Egypt around the early 18th century. The Syro-Lebanese Christians of Egypt were highly influenced by European culture and established churches, printing houses and businesses across Egypt. Their aggregate wealth was reckoned at one and a half billion francs, 10% of the Egyptian GDP at the end of the 20th century. They took advantage of the Egyptian constitution that established the juridical equality of all citizens and granted the Syro-Lebanese Christians the fullness of civil rights, prior to the Nasser reforms.

=== Iraq ===
The Arab Christian community in Iraq is relatively small, and further dwindled due to the Iraq War to just several hundred thousand. Most Arab Christians in Iraq belong traditionally to Greek Orthodox and Catholic Churches and are concentrated in major cities such as Baghdad, Basra and Mosul. The vast majority of the remaining 450,000 to 900,000 Christians in Iraq are Assyrians.

Significant persecution of Iraqi Christians in Mosul and other areas held by ISIS occurred from 2014 onwards, with Christian houses identified as &quot;N&quot; for &quot;Nasrani&quot; (Christian).

=== Israel ===

In December 2009, 122,000 Arab Christians lived in Israel, as Arab citizens of Israel, out of a total of 151,700 Christian citizens. According to the Central Bureau of Statistics, on the eve of Christmas 2013, there were approximately 161,000 Christians in Israel, about 2 percent of the general population in Israel. 80% of the Christians are Arab with smaller Christian communities of ethnic Russians, Ukrainians, Greeks, Armenians, and Assyrians. As of 2014 the Melkite Greek Catholic Church was the largest Christian community in Israel, where about 60% of Israeli Christians belonged to the Melkite Greek Catholic Church, while around 30% of Israeli Christians belonged to the Greek Orthodox Church of Jerusalem. The Christian communities in Israel run numerous schools, colleges, hospitals, clinics, orphanages, homes for the elderly, dormitories, family and youth centers, hotels, and guesthouses.The city of Nazareth has the largest Arab Christian community in Israel, followed by the cities of Haifa, Jerusalem and Shefa-Amr. The Christian Arab communities in Nazareth and Haifa tend to be wealthier and better educated than Arabs elsewhere in Israel. Christians live in a number of other towns in Galilee either singly or mixed with Muslims and Druze, such as Abu Snan, Arraba, Bi&#x27;ina, Daliyat al-Karmel, Deir Hanna, Eilabun, Hurfeish, I&#x27;billin, Isfiya, Jadeidi-Makr, Jish, Kafr Kanna, Kafr Yasif, Kisra-Sumei, Maghar, Mazra&#x27;a, Muqeible, Peki&#x27;in, Rameh, Ras al-Ein, Reineh, Sakhnin, Shefa-Amr, Tur&#x27;an, Yafa an-Naseriyye and others have a presence of Arab Christian communities too as do other mixed cities, especially Jerusalem and Tel Aviv-Jaffa, Ramleh, Lod, Acre, Nof HaGalil, and Ma&#x27;alot Tarshiha. It is reported that all the inhabitants of Fassuta and Mi&#x27;ilya are Melkite Christians.
Arab Christians are one of the most educated groups in Israel. Maariv has described the Christian Arab sectors as &quot;the most successful in the education system&quot;. Statistically, Christian Arabs in Israel have the highest rates of educational attainment among all religious communities. According to a data by Israel Central Bureau of Statistics in 2010, 63% of Israeli Christian Arabs have had college or postgraduate education, the highest of any religious and ethno-religious group. Christian Arabs also have one of the highest rates of success in the matriculation examinations &quot;per capita&quot;, (73.9%) in 2016 both in comparison to Muslims, Druze, Jews and all students in the Israeli education system as a group. Arab Christians were also the vanguard in terms of eligibility for higher education. They have attained a bachelor&#x27;s degree and academic degree more than Jewish, Muslims and Druze &quot;per capita&quot;. The rate of students studying in the field of medicine was also higher among the Christian Arab students, compared with all the students from other sectors. Despite the fact that Arab Christians only represent 2.1% of the total Israeli population, in 2014 they accounted for 17.0% of the country&#x27;s university students, and for 14.4% of its college students. Socio-economically, Arab Christians are closer to the Jewish population than to the Muslim population. They have the lowest incidence of poverty and the lowest percentage of unemployment which is 4.9% compared to 6.5% among Jewish men and women. They have also the highest median household income among Arab citizens of Israel and second highest median household income among the Israeli ethno-religious groups. According to study the majority of Christians in Israel (68.2 per cent) are employed in the service sector, i.e. banks, insurance companies, schools, tourism, hospitals etc. Among Arab Christians in Israel, some emphasize pan-Arabism, whilst a small minority enlists in the Israel Defense Forces.

=== Jordan ===
Jordan contains some of the oldest Christian communities in the world, their presence dating back to the first century AD. Today, Christians make up about 4% of the population, down from 20% in 1930. This is due to high immigration rates of Muslims into Jordan, higher emigration rates of Christians to the west and higher birth rates for Muslims. Christians in Jordan are exceptionally well integrated in the Jordanian society and enjoy a high level of freedom. Christians are allotted nine out of a total of 130 seats in the Parliament of Jordan, and also hold important ministerial portfolios, ambassadorial appointments, and positions of high military rank. All Christian religious ceremonies are publicly celebrated in Jordan.

Jordanian Arab Christians (some have Palestinian roots since 1948) number around 221,000, according to a 2014 estimate by the Orthodox Church. The study excluded minority Christian groups and the thousands of western, Iraqi and Syrian Christians residing in Jordan. Another estimate suggests the Orthodox number 125–300,000, Catholics at 114,000 and Protestants at 30,000 for a total 270–450,000. Most native Christians in Jordan identify themselves as Arab, though there are also significant Assyrian and Armenian populations in the country. There has also been an influx of Christian refugees escaping Daesh, mainly from Mosul, Iraq, numbering about 7000 and 20,000 from Syria. King Abdullah II of Jordan has made firm statements about Arab Christians:&quot;Let me say once again: Arab Christians are an integral part of my region&#x27;s past, present, and future.&quot;

=== Kuwait ===

Kuwait&#x27;s native Christian population exists, though is essentially small. There are between 259 and 400 Christian Kuwaiti citizens. Christian Kuwaitis can be divided into two groups. The first group includes the earliest Kuwaiti Christians, who originated from Iraq and Turkey. They have assimilated into Kuwaiti society, like their Muslim counterparts, and tend to speak Arabic with a Kuwaiti dialect; their food and culture are also predominantly Kuwaiti. They makeup roughly a quarter of Kuwait&#x27;s Christian population. The rest (roughly three-quarters) of Christian Kuwaitis make up the second group. They are more recent arrivals in the 1950s and 1960s, mostly Kuwaitis of Palestinian ancestry who were forced out of Palestine after 1948. There are also smaller numbers who originally hail from Syria and Lebanon. This second group is not as assimilated as the first group, as their food, culture, and Arabic dialect still retain a Levant feel. However, they are just as patriotic as the former group, and tend to be proud of their adopted homeland, with many serving in the army, police, civil, and foreign service. Most of Kuwait&#x27;s citizen Christians belong to 12 large families, with the Shammas (from Turkey) and the Shuhaibar (from Palestine) families being some of the more prominent ones.

=== Lebanon ===

Lebanon holds the largest number of Christians in the Arab world proportionally and falls just behind Egypt in absolute numbers. About 350,000-450,000 of Christians in Lebanon are Orthodox and Melkites, while the most dominant group are Maronites with about 1 million population, whose Arab identity is contentiously disputed. Lebanese Christians are the only Christians in the Middle East with a sizable political role in the country. In accordance with the National Pact, the President of Lebanon must be a Maronite Christian, the Deputy Speaker of the Parliament and Deputy Prime Minister a Greek Orthodox Christian and Melkites and Protestants have nine reserved seats in the Parliament of Lebanon. The Maronites and the Druze founded modern Lebanon in the early eighteenth century, through the ruling and social system known as the &quot;Maronite-Druze dualism&quot; in Mount Lebanon Mutasarrifate.

Christians constituted 60% of the population of Lebanon in 1932. The exact number of Christians in modern Lebanon is uncertain because no official census has been made in Lebanon since 1932. Lebanese Christians belong mostly to the Maronite and Greek Orthodox Churches, with sizable minorities belonging to the Melkite Greek Catholic Church and Armenian Apostolic Church. The community of Armenians in Lebanon is politically and demographically significant.

=== Libya ===
Christianity had a presence in Tripolitania and Cyrenaica in Roman times. The Coptic population in Libya is estimated to number 60,000. A 2015 estimates some 1,500 Christian believers from a Muslim background residing in the country.

=== Morocco ===

Christianity in Morocco appeared during the Roman times, when it was practiced by Christian Berbers in Roman Mauretania Tingitana, although it disappeared after the Islamic conquests. Morocco was home to half a million Christian Europeans (mostly of Spanish and French ancestry) prior to Moroccan independence. The U.S. State Department estimates the number of Arab and Berber Christians in Morocco as more than 40,000. Pew-Templeton estimates the number of Moroccan Christians at 20,000. The number of the Moroccans who converted to Christianity (most of them secret worshippers) are estimated between 8,000 and 50,000.

=== Oman ===
=== Palestine ===
Most of the Palestinian Christians claim descent from the first Christian converts, Arameans, Ghassanid Arabs and Greeks who settled in the region. Between 36,000 and 50,000 Christians live in Palestine, most of whom belong to the Orthodox (Including Greek, Syriac and Armenian Orthodox), Catholic (Roman and Melchite) churches and Evangelical communities. The majority of Palestinian Christians live in the Bethlehem and Ramallah areas with a less number in other places. In 2007, just before the Hamas takeover of Gaza, there were 3,200 Christians living in the Gaza Strip. Half the Christian community in Gaza fled to the West Bank and abroad after the Hamas take-over in 2007. However, Palestinian Christians in Gaza face restrictions on their freedom of movement by the Israeli blockade, which has been cited as one of the reasons contributing to their dwindling numbers.
Many Palestinian Christians hold high-ranking positions in Palestinian society, particularly at the political and social levels. They manage the high ranking schools, universities, cultural centers and hospitals, however, Christian communities in the Palestinian Authority and the Gaza Strip have greatly dwindled over the last two decades. The causes of the Palestinian Christian exodus are widely debated and it started since the Ottoman times. Reuters reports that many Palestinian Christians emigrate in pursuit of better living standards. The Vatican saw the Israeli occupation and the general conflict in the Holy Land as the principal reasons for the Christian exodus from the territories. The decline of the Christian community in Palestine follows the trend of Christian emigration from the Muslim-dominated Middle East. Some churches have attempted to ameliorate the rate of emigration of young Christians by building subsidized housing for them and expanding efforts at job training.

=== Saudi Arabia ===
Jubail Church is a 4th-century church building near Jubail. Some parts of modern Saudi Arabia, such as Najran, were predominantly Christian until the 7th to 10th century, when most Christians were expelled, converted to Islam or left the region via the Sea route to Asia, with which merchant trade already existed, others migrated north to Jordan and Syria. Some Arab Christians who remained living as crypto-Christians. Some Arabian tribes, such as Banu Taghlib and Banu Tamim, followed Christianity.

Today, Saudi Arabia&#x27;s Arab Christian population consists mostly of Lebanese and Syrians living in diaspora.

=== Sudan ===
There were approximately 1.1 million Catholics in Sudan, about 3.2 percent of the total population. Sudan forms one ecclesiastical province, consisting of one archdiocese (the Archdiocese of Khartoum) and one suffragan diocese (the Diocese of El Obeid). The vast majority of Sudan&#x27;s Catholics ended up in South Sudan after the partition.

=== Syria ===

The Arab Christians of Syria are predominantly Rūm-Orthodox and Melkite-Catholic, with some Roman-Catholics. Non-Arab Syrian Christians include Assyrians (also known as Chaldeans or Syriacs), Greeks and Armenians. Assyrian refugees fled to Syria after the massacres in Turkey and Iraq during World War I, also known as &quot;Sayfo&quot; in Syriac-Aramaic, and later after the events in Iraq in 2003. Due to the Syrian civil war, a large number of Christians fled the country to Lebanon, Jordan, and Europe. However, a significant portion of the population still resides in Syria, with some being internally displaced. Many Arab Christian militias fought in the Syrian civil war, including the Khabur Guards and the pro-Assad Guardians of the Dawn. Western Aramaic is spoken by Christian and Muslim Arameans (or Syriacs) alike in remote villages in the Qalamoun mountains, including Maaloula, Jubb&#x27;adin and Bakh&#x27;a.

The largest Christian denomination in Syria is the Greek-Orthodox Church, primarily consisting of Arab Christians, followed by the Syriac-Orthodox Church, whose followers often identify as Assyrian or Syriac. The combined population of Syria and Lebanon in 1910 was estimated at 30% in a population of 3.5 million. According to the 1960 census in Syria which recorded just over 4.5 million inhabitants, Christians formed just under 15% of the population (or 675,000). Since 1960 the population of Syria has increased five-fold, but the Christian population only 3.5 times. Due to political reasons, no newer census has been taken since. Most recent estimates prior to the Syrian civil war suggested that overall Christians were about 10% of the overall population of Syrian 23 million citizens, due to having lower birth rates and higher emigration rates than their Muslim compatriots.

Although religious freedom is allowed in the Syrian Arab Republic, all citizens of Syria including Christians, are subject to the Shari&#x27;a-based personal status laws regulating child custody, inheritance, and adoption. For example, in the case of divorce, a woman loses the right to custody of her sons when they reach the age of thirteen and her daughters when they reach the age of fifteen, regardless of religion.

=== Tunisia ===
Christianity came in Tunisia during Roman rule. However, after the arrival of Islam, the population of Christians decreased in the country. Prior to Tunisian independence, Tunisia was home to 255,000 Christian Europeans (mostly of Italian and Maltese ancestry). The International Religious Freedom Report of 2007 reported that the Christian community numbered 50,000 people, 20,000 of whom were Catholics. In the Annuario Pontificio of 2018, the number of Catholics is estimated to have risen to 30,700. However, the number of Tunisian Christians is estimated to be around 23,500.

The Catholic Church in Tunisia operates 12 churches, nine schools and several libraries throughout the country. In addition to holding religious services, the Catholic Church opened a monastery, freely organized cultural activities, and performed charitable work throughout Tunisia. According to church leaders, there are 2,000 practicing Protestant Christians, most of them are Tunisians who converted to Christianity. There is also a small community of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses numbering around 50, only half of which identify as Arab.

=== Turkey ===
Today, there are between 120,000 and 320,000 people of various Christian denominations in Turkey. Antiochian Greek Christians (or Melkites) who mostly live in Hatay Province, are one of the Arabic-speaking communities in Turkey and number approximately 18,000. They are often Rūm-Orthodox, but are sometimes known as &quot;Arab Christians&quot; due to their culture and heritage. Antioch, the capital of Hatay Province, is also the historical center of both the Greek Orthodox Church and Syriac Orthodox Church. Turkey is also home to several non-Arab native minorities, such as Armenians (around 70,000), Greeks (or Hellenes) (around 5,000) and Assyrians in the southeast (around 25,000). The village of Tokaçlı in Altınözü District has an entirely Arab Christian population and is one of the few Christian villages in Turkey.

=== Yemen ===
Christianity was a widespread religion on the territory of contemporary Yemen as early as the sixth century, before the arrival of Islam in Yemen. Today it is a minority religion in Yemen with only a few thousand followers which has greatly been reduced amid the Yemeni Civil War.

<text>Mohawk Airlines was a local service carrier operating in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States, mainly in New York and Pennsylvania, from the mid-1940s until its acquisition by Allegheny Airlines in 1972. At its height, it employed over 2,200 personnel and pioneered several aspects of regional airline operations, including being the first airline in the United States to hire an African American flight attendant, in 1958. The airline was based at Ithaca Municipal Airport near Ithaca, New York, until 1958, when it moved to Oneida County Airport in Whitestown, New York.

==History==
The airline was founded in 1945 as Robinson Airlines by aerial photographer C. S. Robinson as a unit of Robinson Aviation, completing its first passenger flight on 6 April. The operation was based out of Ithaca Municipal Airport near Ithaca, New York, flying single-engine, three-passenger Fairchild F-24s. After the end of World War II, the Fairchilds were supplemented with two Cessna T-50s, and in 1946, the entire fleet was replaced with Beechcraft Model 18s.

To keep the airline flying, Robinson secured investments from a variety of local sources, notably Ithaca Enterprises, a nonprofit organization responsible for bringing new businesses to Ithaca, and the Cooperative Grange League Federation Exchange (now part of Agway), a farmers cooperative that had been organized by members of The Grange, and Cornell University. Most significant was the involvement of Edwin Albert Link, creator of the Link Trainer. Link lent the airline $75,000 to purchase three used Douglas DC-3s— but also removed control of the company from Robinson, making pilot Robert Peach its general manager. In 1948, the Civil Aeronautics Board certified the airline as a local service carrier, awarding a variety of routes in the Mohawk Valley region. The airline adopted the slogan &quot;Route of the Air Chiefs&quot;, and painted a blue and red &quot;air chief&quot; on the tails of its planes.

In 1952 Robert Peach purchased a controlling share of the airline, and Robinson removed himself from day-to-day operations. The board adopted the name Mohawk Airlines; in 1953 it carried 2 million passengers between 15 airports and had revenue of $24.3 million. The following summer it experimented briefly with helicopter service, connecting Newark, New Jersey, and Grossinger&#x27;s Resort in the Catskill Mountains with a Sikorsky S-55. (The July 1954 OAG shows 13 flights a week each way between Newark and Liberty Airport ; fare $18 one way plus tax.) More successfully, the airline introduced Convair 240s on 1 July 1955, becoming the first local service carrier with pressurized aircraft. In 1956, having outgrown its facilities in Ithaca, it moved its corporate offices to Utica.

When hired by Mohawk Airlines in December 1957, Ruth Carol Taylor became the first African-American flight attendant in the United States. Six months after breaking one historic barrier, Ruth Taylor&#x27;s career ended due to another barrier: the airline&#x27;s marriage ban, a common practice among airlines of the day. Airlines often dismissed flight attendants who married or became pregnant.

Mohawk&#x27;s golden age was the late 1950s and early 1960s; it acquired the Convair 440 in 1958, and Martin 4-0-4s in 1960. In 1961, Mohawk was the first airline to use a centralized computer-based reservation service, and in 1965, the first regional airline to use flight simulators. Mohawk upgraded its fleet with the BAC One-Eleven in 1965, becoming the first regional airline to fly jets.

The last DC-3 flights were in 1962; Mohawk ended Convair piston flights in 1969 and mainly flew the BAC One-Eleven and the Fairchild Hiller FH-227 turboprop. Like other local service airlines, Mohawk was subsidized; in 1962 operating &quot;revenues&quot; totaled $23.3 million including $4.6 million &quot;federal subsidy&quot;.

In May 1968, Mohawk served 38 airports, from Boston and Washington, D.C. to Detroit. Between 1968 and 1971, labor and economic issues bled Mohawk financially. Unable to pay creditors at the end of that period, Mohawk began merger discussions with Allegheny Airlines, and merged into Allegheny on 12 April 1972. Allegheny changed its name to USAir in 1979, and later to US Airways. Following bankruptcies and a later merger with America West Airlines in 2005, US Airways purchased American Airlines in 2015 and assumed operations under the American Airlines name and logo.

==Accidents and incidents==
;4 September 1950:A Robinson Airlines DC-3 crashed shortly after taking off from the Oneida County Airport near Utica, New York; 11 passengers and three crew members died.

;16 October 1961:At Bradley Field in Windsor Locks, Connecticut, a Mohawk twin-engine Convair performed a belly landing when the pilot failed to put the wheels down before landing. None of the 12 passengers or 3 crew members were injured.

;2 July 1963:At Rochester, New York, Mohawk Airlines Flight 121 (a Martin 4-0-4) attempted to take off into a thunderstorm. Its wing-tip hit the ground and the aircraft cartwheeled; 7 died, 36 were injured.

;1 March 1964:At Broome County Airport, a Mohawk Airlines twin-engined plane crashed during landing and was heavily damaged when the pilot accidentally retracted the landing gear. The 44 occupants escaped the plane through emergency exits without injury.

;23 June 1967:Mohawk Airlines Flight 40 (a BAC 1-11) flying from Elmira, New York, to Washington, D.C., suffered a fire in the rear of the aircraft that destroyed the vertical tail, causing all loss of pitch control. The cause was a non-return valve failure in the APU unit, resulting in hydraulic fluid igniting. The aircraft crashed near Blossburg, Pennsylvania; all 34 people on board died.

;19 November 1969:Mohawk Airlines Flight 411 (a Fairchild-Hiller FH-227B) crashed into Pilot Knob on the east shore of Lake George, New York, on approach to Warren County Airport, Glens Falls, New York; all 14 on board died.

;26 January 1972: Mohawk Airlines Flight 452 from Albany to LaGuardia Airport in New York City was hijacked and diverted to Westchester County Airport. The hijacker permitted the 42 passengers aboard to disembark there while he negotiated his demand for $200,000 cash. After several hours on the ground with the hijacker holding a flight attendant at gunpoint, Mohawk met his demands and the crew then flew the FH-227 airplane with the hijacker to Dutchess County Airport, landing after 3 a.m. As the 45-year old hijacker attempted to flee the airport in a getaway car, he was killed instantly by a shotgun blast from an FBI agent.

;3 March 1972:Mohawk Airlines Flight 405 (another FH-227) crashed into a house in Albany, New York, on approach to Albany County Airport. The crew had difficulty getting the cruise lock to disengage in one of the engines. While the crew attempted to deal with the problem, the aircraft crashed short of the airfield; 16 of the 48 people in the aircraft, and one person on the ground, died. The lone surviving crew member was a stewardess, Sandra Quinn.

==In popular culture ==

===In music===
*On Chicago&#x27;s album, &quot;Chicago III&quot; (1971), the group recorded the song &quot;Flight 602.&quot; Later that year, on the live album, &quot;Chicago at Carnegie Hall&quot;, the group announced that the title referred to a Mohawk flight from New York to Toronto.
*The photo on the back cover of the supergroup, the Traveling Wilburys&#x27;, first album, &quot;Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1&quot; (1988), depicts five guitar cases with old-fashioned travel stickers. At the bottom of the guitar case on the right is a travel sticker that says &quot;Fly Mohawk.&quot;

===In television===
*During the eighth season of &quot;Bewitched&quot;, in season 8, episode 12, &quot;The Eight Year Itch Witch&quot; (1971), a woman telephones Darrin&#x27;s Albany hotel room posing as a Mohawk Airlines reservation agent and tells him the 11 o&#x27;clock flight is cancelled because of fog.
*Mohawk has been a recurring plot point in the AMC series &quot;Mad Men.&quot; In season 2, episode 1, &quot;For Those Who Think Young&quot; (2008) the fictional Sterling Cooper ad agency worked on a campaign for Mohawk Airlines. In season 2, episode 2, &quot;Flight 1&quot; (2008), Sterling Cooper resigns the account in order to pursue an account with American Airlines, which is considering changing agencies in the aftermath of the crash of American Airlines Flight 1 in New York. Mohawk Airlines returns to the agency in season 5, episode 3, &quot;Tea Leaves&quot; (2012) and in season 6/episode 7, &quot;Man With a Plan&quot;.
*In the animated sitcom &quot;F is for Family&quot;, taking place in the early 1970s, the principal character, Frank, works for a parody of the airline, called Mohican Airways.

<text>The HP-18C is a Hewlett-Packard business calculator which was quickly followed by the very similar but greatly improved HP-19B. The HP-18C is HP&#x27;s first RPL-based calculator internally, even though this was not visible on user-level in this non user-programmable model. The user has a solver (another HP first) available, but only had about 1.5 KB of continuous memory available to store equations.

The calculator has many functions buried in a menu structure. The clamshell design is fairly robust, but the battery door is the shortcoming of this whole line; 18C, 19B, and 28C/S models.

The HP-18C was introduced in June 1986.

<text>Max Adler (May 12, 1866 – November 4, 1952) was an American businessman, musician and philanthropist. 
Adler was born in Elgin, Illinois, to a family of Jewish German origins that emigrated to America in about 1850. He was raised in Elgin and graduated from Elgin High School. As an adult, he was a concert violinist in Chicago before he gave up music to become a vice president at Sears Roebuck &amp; Co. after marrying into the family that controlled the company. His wife was Sophie Rosenwald, the sister of Julius Rosenwald, who founded Chicago&#x27;s Museum of Science and Industry. He retired in 1928 to become a philanthropist and was key to the creation of the first planetarium in the Western Hemisphere, the Adler Planetarium in Chicago, which bears his name.

In 1914, he had a 12,000 square foot mansion built as his house.

<text>Carlo Agostini (22 April 1888 – 28 December 1952) was an Italian prelate of the Catholic Church. He served as Patriarch of Venice from 1949 until his death, and died shortly after the announcement for his elevation to the cardinalate in 1952.

==Biography==
Born in San Martino di Lupari, Carlo Agostini studied at the seminary in Treviso, and was ordained to the priesthood by Bishop Andrea Longhin on 24 September 1910. He then furthered his studies in Rome earning a doctorate in philosophy at the Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas (Angelicum) and a doctorate in theology at Pontifical Gregorian University in 1913. Agostini was a professor (1913–1925) and the rector (1925–1932) of the Treviso seminary, and was raised to the rank of privy chamberlain of his holiness in 1925.

On 30 January 1932, he was appointed Bishop of Padua by Pope Pius XI. Agostini received his episcopal consecration on the following 10 April from Bishop Longhin, with Archbishop Elia Dalla Costa and Bishop Eugenio Beccegato serving as co-consecrators. He was apostolic administrator of Treviso from 8 March to 6 December 1936, and later named Patriarch of Venice on 5 February 1949.

Pope Pius XII announced on 29 November 1952 that he would elevate Agostini and twenty-three others to the College of Cardinals. However, the patriarch died, from Parkinson&#x27;s disease at the age of 64, before the consistory could take place on 12 January 1953. Agostini was initially buried in S. Michele cemetery, but his remains were later transferred to the crypt of St Mark&#x27;s Basilica in November 1957.

The unexpected vacancy in Venice opened the way for the elevation of Angelo Giuseppe Roncalli, the future Pope John XXIII.

<text>Frances Davis Alda (born Fanny Jane Davis; 31 May 1879 – 18 September 1952) was a New Zealand-born, Australian-raised operatic lyric soprano. She achieved fame during the first three decades of the 20th century due to her outstanding singing voice, fine technique and colourful personality, as well as her frequent onstage partnerships at the Metropolitan Opera, New York, with Enrico Caruso.

==Career==
Alda was born Fanny Jane Davis in Christchurch, New Zealand, on 31 May 1879 to David Davis and Leonore Simonsen.

Leonore, a promising singer from a musical family, in September 1880 divorced David and resumed her singing career. Fanny spent her early years traveling with her mother on her operatic tours. After false starts in Australasia, she took Fanny and her younger brother to San Francisco, California in 1883. Leonore Davis remarried but died of peritonitis in San Francisco on 29 December 1884, shortly after remarrying, to Herman Adler. After her mother&#x27;s death, Alda was sent to live with her maternal grandparents, Martin and Fanny Simonsen, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.

She sang in productions of Gilbert and Sullivan in Melbourne before leaving Australia for Europe at the age of 22 in order to undertake additional study and pursue an international singing career like her future soprano rival Nellie Melba. After receiving lessons in Paris from the renowned teacher Mathilde Marchesi, who gave her her stage name, Alda made her debut at the Opéra-Comique in 1904 in Jules Massenet&#x27;s &quot;Manon&quot;. She appeared at the Royal Opera House Covent Garden in 1906, and at La Scala, Milan, during the 1906-08 seasons.

In 1908, the former La Scala impresario Giulio Gatti-Casazza became director of the Metropolitan Opera. On 7 December 1908 Alda made her debut there. On 4 April 1910, Alda and Gatti-Casazza married. According to &quot;American Art News&quot; (New York, 19 March 1910), Adolfo Müller-Ury was painting Alda just before her marriage. It was in New York that Alda furthered her career, appearing to acclaim in such famous operas as &quot;Martha&quot;, &quot;Manon Lescaut&quot;, &quot;Otello&quot;, &quot;Faust&quot;, &quot;Mefistofele&quot; and &quot;La bohème&quot;. She began recording for the Victor Talking Machine Company in 1908 and several of her records became best-sellers. She created the title roles in Victor Herbert&#x27;s &quot;Madeleine&quot; and Henry Hadley&#x27;s &quot;Cleopatra&#x27;s Night&quot; as well as Roxane in Walter Damrosch&#x27;s &quot;Cyrano&quot;. She also sang regularly with Enrico Caruso.

Alda toured Australia and New Zealand in 1927, saying in an interview she loathed the former. She and Gatti-Casazza separated the following year and then divorced. In 1929, she left the Met but continued to give concerts, make radio broadcasts and appear in vaudeville. Alda&#x27;s 1937 autobiography was titled &quot;Men, Women, &amp; Tenors&quot;.

On 14 April 1941 in Charleston, South Carolina, she married Manhattan advertising executive Ray Vir Den; he was a decade younger than she.

She had an affluent retirement in Long Island, and spent much time travelling . She died of a stroke on 18 September 1952 in Venice, Italy, aged 73.
She is buried in All Saints Episcopal Church Cemetery in Great Neck, Long Island.
