<doc id="757970" wikidata="Q5243613" url="?curid=757970" title="Daytona Tortugas">
<text>The Daytona Tortugas are a Minor League Baseball team of the Florida State League and the Single-A affiliate of the Cincinnati Reds. They are located in Daytona Beach, Florida, and play their home games at Jackie Robinson Ballpark. Opened in 1914, the park seats 4,200 people.

The club was previously known as the Daytona Cubs from 1993 to 2014 when they were an affiliate of the Chicago Cubs. The team has won six Florida State League championships: in 1995, 2000, 2004 (co-champions with the Tampa Yankees), 2008, 2011, and 2013.

==History==

===Daytona Beach Admirals===
The last Florida State League (FSL) baseball team to play in Daytona Beach, was known as the Daytona Beach Admirals, the Class A affiliate of the Chicago White Sox. In September 1987, the White Sox decided to move their Class A affiliate to Sarasota. This left Daytona without a major league player development contract, resulting in the Admirals&#x27; owner selling the team to the New York Mets. The Mets moved the team to Port St. Lucie to become the St. Lucie Mets. Daytona did not have professional baseball for five years after the move.

===Chicago Cubs===
Prior to 1993, the Chicago Cubs were affiliated with the Winston Salem Warthogs, a Class A team that played in the Carolina League. At the end of the 1992 season, the Cubs decided to move their Class A affiliate to Florida. The Florida State League originally assigned the transplanted Cubs team to play at Baseball City Stadium in Davenport. However, Jordan Kobritz, the new owner and general manager of the minor league franchise, wanted the team to play in Daytona Beach instead. Negotiations to bring the Cubs to Daytona Beach went on for a couple of months and were completed just in time to start the new season.

The Daytona Cubs opened their first season on the road, sweeping the Vero Beach Dodgers, two games to zero. The home opener was scheduled for April 12. Jackie Robinson Ballpark was sold out on opening night. Chelsea Clinton, President Clinton&#x27;s daughter, was invited to Daytona to throw the opening pitch. The young Ms. Clinton could not attend due to a family medical emergency, and Daytona Beach Mayor Larry Kelly and FSL President Chuck Murphy threw the ceremonial opening pitches instead. The Cubs&#x27; public address announcer led fans to sing &quot;Go, Cubs, Go&quot;, although with slightly altered lyrics (substituting &quot;Daytona&quot; for &quot;Chicago&quot;). The Daytona Cubs won their home opener 5–2 against the Sarasota White Sox, the Class A affiliate of the Chicago White Sox who left Daytona Beach five years earlier.

=== Cincinnati Reds ===
After the 2014 season, the Cubs ended their affiliation with Daytona, and signed a new contract with the Myrtle Beach Pelicans of the Carolina League. Daytona reached an agreement with the Cincinnati Reds following the 2014 season, and announced the team would be rebranded with a new name with a &quot;local angle&quot; in 2015. They chose the name &quot;Tortugas&quot;, Spanish for &quot;turtles&quot;.

On June 3, 2015, Big Game Florida, LLC, headed by Andy Rayburn, sold the team to Tortugas Baseball Club, LLC, headed by Reese Smith III with partners Bob Fregolle and Rick French. Smith plans to keep the team in Daytona.

In conjunction with Major League Baseball&#x27;s restructuring of Minor League Baseball in 2021, the Tortugas were organized into the Low-A Southeast at the Low-A classification, though they remained affiliated with the Reds. In 2022, the Low-A Southeast became known as the Florida State League, the name historically used by the regional circuit prior to the 2021 reorganization, and was reclassified as a Single-A circuit.

===Season-by-season results===


== Ballparks ==

=== Jackie Robinson Ballpark ===

The Daytona Tortugas&#x27; current, and only, ballpark is Jackie Robinson Ballpark. The venue has experienced several expansions and renovations since its completion in 1914, and currently seats 4,200 spectators.

=== Melching Field at Conrad Park ===

In 1999, Daytona Cubs&#x27; owner and General Manager Jordan Kobritz decided to move a home game to Melching Field at Conrad Park, located in nearby DeLand. This ballpark is the home of the Stetson University Hatters baseball team. Kobritz&#x27;s goal was to generate some fan interest in the Cubs, in the western part of Volusia County. The game (vs. the St. Petersburg Devil Rays) was played on June 26, 1999. In August 2004, the D-Cubs had to move several games to Melching Field, due to damage to Jackie Robinson Ballpark, caused by Hurricane Charley. The Cubs paid another visit to Melching Field on June 20, 2007, when they played a double-header against the Palm Beach Cardinals. The game was moved this time to benefit a local charity in DeLand, as well as provide another opportunity to showcase the Daytona Cubs to fans in DeLand.

== Uniforms ==
=== Current ===

The team&#x27;s color scheme consists of blue and green. Jerseys and pants for home games are made of white fabric with green trim, while those for road games are made of gray fabric with blue trim. On home jerseys, the word &quot;Tortugas&quot; is scripted across the chest in green. On road jerseys, the word &quot;Daytona&quot; is written across the chest in blue script. The player&#x27;s number is written on the back in large green characters surrounded by blue.

The team&#x27;s batting practice uniforms, which double as alternate uniforms, are made of green fabric. &quot;Tortugas&quot; is written across the chest in white script, trimmed in blue. There is a Daytona Tortugas logo on the right shoulder. Numbers, in white surrounded by blue, are sewn on the back in block characters.

The official home and road caps were green with Daytona Tortugas logo centered on the front. The batting practice/alternate caps are blue in color, with a white front and blue brim. The alternate Shelldon head logo is in the center of the cap. A green belt is typically worn.

===Past===
From 1993 to 2014 as the Cubs, the team&#x27;s color scheme consisted of red, white, and blue, the same colors used by the Chicago Cubs. The uniforms of the Daytona Cubs were descendants of the Chicago Cubs&#x27; uniforms. Jerseys and pants for home games were made of white fabric with blue pinstripes, while those for road games were made of gray fabric with blue pinstripes. On home jerseys, the Chicago Cubs logo was located on the left chest, and a Daytona Cubs logo was located on the left sleeve. On road jerseys, the word &quot;Daytona&quot; was written across the chest in red script, and a Daytona Cubs logo was present on the left shoulder. The player&#x27;s number was written on the back in large blue characters surrounded by red. Blue T-shirts of varying sleeve lengths were worn underneath the jerseys. The team&#x27;s batting practice uniforms, which doubled as alternate uniforms, were made of light blue fabric with white pinstripes. &quot;Daytona&quot; was written across the chest in red script. There was a Daytona Cubs logo on the left shoulder. Numbers, in blue surrounded by red, were sewn on the back in block characters. The official home and road caps were blue with either the Chicago Cubs or Daytona Cubs logo centered on the front. A blue belt was worn on all the different uniforms along with blue ankle-length socks.

== Mascot ==
The team&#x27;s mascot is an anthropomorphic turtle (&quot;Tortuga&quot;) named Shelldon. Since his first season in 2015, &quot;Daytona&#x27;s favorite party animal&quot; acts as the team&#x27;s Goodwill Ambassador, visiting local schools and charity events when he is not performing at home games.

Shelldon is a green and white sea turtle with a blue shell on his back, dark green spots, and an occasional backwards cap. He sports his white Tortuga jersey almost daily but changes into elaborate costumes for on-field skits and performances. Daytona Tortuga fans have learned to not get attached to any particular players, since the reward for superior play is to be taken away from Daytona and sent up to a higher farm team. Shelldon has been an adequate substitute to represent the team to the public and can constantly be seen tumbling, breakdancing, and generating fun around Daytona.

Shelldon was also named the #1 Florida State League Mascot by The Athletic.

He is also joined by Shelly, a female turtle who supports the Tortugas&#x27; involvement in the community and is Shelldon&#x27;s girlfriend. She debuted as the second team mascot in 2018.

===Past===
Prior to becoming the Tortugas, the Daytona Cubs originally used a version of the Chicago Cubs emblem. In 1994, the Cubs hired Benedict Advertising, a local marketing firm, to develop a new logo. Benedict&#x27;s design department created a bear cub wearing sunglasses and a backwards baseball cap.

As a mascot, Cubby first appeared on the field on May 27, 1994. He had brown fur and wore the same style of uniform as the team, but wearing his hat backwards.

==Memorable events and records==

===Four home runs in a game===
* Ryan Harvey, July 28, 2006, game vs. Clearwater Threshers (Daytona won, 10–9), hit four home runs in one game.
*Javier Báez, June 10, 2013, game vs. Fort Myers Miracle (Daytona won 9–6), hit four home runs in one game.

===Hitting for the cycle===
Five Daytona players have hit for the cycle to date:
* Adam Greenberg, August 17, 2002, game vs. St. Lucie Mets (Daytona won, 17–1)
* Félix Pie, June 27, 2004, game vs. Fort Myers Miracle (Daytona won, 15–14, 10 innings)
* Brett Jackson, June 14, 2010, game vs. Lakeland Flying Tigers (Daytona won, 6–4, 11 innings)
* Albert Almora, July 14, 2014, game vs. Jupiter Hammerheads (Daytona won, 13–8, 13 innings)
*Carlos Jorge, July 21, 2023 vs. Jupiter Hammerheads (Daytona lost, 16–4) First Cycle by a Daytona Tortuga

===No-hitters===
* Matt Loosen, July 8, 2013, at Dunedin Blue Jays (Daytona won 7–0). Loosen allowed no hits over a full nine innings of work, while walking two and striking out nine.
* Ben Wells, Kyler Burke, Zach Cates; Wednesday, August 21 at Dunedin Blue Jays and Tuesday, August 27, 2013, vs. Dunedin Blue Jays (Daytona won 1–0). Ben Wells pitched a hitless first inning in the first game of a scheduled doubleheader on August 21 at Dunedin, until a rainstorm caused the game to be suspended and eventually completed on August 27 at Daytona (where the Cubs were still the road team, despite playing in their home ballpark). In the resumption of the game on August 27, Kyler Burke didn&#x27;t allow a hit in five innings of work and Zach Cates closed the game out with a 1–2–3 seventh inning. The game is more than a baseball rarity, considering the no-hitter was technically thrown in two cities, separated by 163 miles of driving distance.
* Tyler Mahle, June 13, 2016, at Jupiter Hammerheads (Daytona won 4–0). Mahle became the first FSL pitcher to toss a nine-inning solo no-hitter since Loosen did it for Daytona almost three years earlier. The only baserunner was a hit batter in the second inning, as Mahle faced the minimum (due to a doubleplay) and struck out six.
* James Proctor, Vin Timpanelli, Ricky Karcher, Nick Hanson and Carson Spiers combined for a 1–0 no-hitter on May 22, 2021 at home against the Jupiter Hammerheads.

== Managers ==
Thirteen men have managed Daytona baseball teams since the franchise&#x27;s inception in 1993. Six managers have guided the team to win the FSL Championship: Dave Trembley (1995), Richie Zisk (2000), Steve McFarland (2004), Jody Davis (2008), Buddy Bailey (2011), and Dave Keller (2013). Trembley won 290 games from 1995 to 1996 and 2001 to 2002, placing him first on the all-time wins list for Daytona managers. Having managed the team for 545 games, he is also the longest-tenured manager in team history. The manager with the highest winning percentage over a full season or more is Steve McFarland (.556). Conversely, the lowest winning percentage over a season or more is .429 by the team&#x27;s first manager, Bill Hays. Buddy Bailey managed his first Daytona game in 2006, was replaced as manager following the season but returned to Daytona in 2009. Eli Marrero managed the Tortugas from 2015 to 2017. Former shortstop Ricky Gutierrez, who won a World Series with the Boston Red Sox in 2004 and was the Tortugas bench coach in 2017, was named the team&#x27;s full-time manager for the 2018 season.

<text>The Jupiter Hammerheads are a Minor League Baseball team of the Florida State League and the Single-A affiliate of the Miami Marlins. They are located in the town of Jupiter in Palm Beach County, Florida, and play their home games at Roger Dean Chevrolet Stadium. Opened in 1998, the park seats 6,871 people. They share the facility with the Palm Beach Cardinals, also of the Florida State League.

On May 23, 2011, the Hammerheads gained national attention after playing in a 23-inning game against the Clearwater Threshers.

In 2012, the Hammerheads won the 2nd Half Division Title and went on to defeat the St. Lucie Mets in a decisive Game 3 of the Division Championship Series to capture their first ever Division title. Jupiter lost in the FSL Championship in the fifth and final game against the Lakeland Flying Tigers, despite holding a 2–1 lead after Game 3.

In conjunction with Major League Baseball&#x27;s restructuring of Minor League Baseball in 2021, the Hammerheads were organized into the Low-A Southeast at the Low-A classification. In 2022, the Low-A Southeast became known as the Florida State League, the name historically used by the regional circuit prior to the 2021 reorganization, and was reclassified as a Single-A circuit.

<text>USS &quot;Lamberton&quot; (DD-119)/(DMS-2) was a in the United States Navy in commission from 1918 to 1922 and from 1930 to 1946. She saw service during World War II. She was the only ship named for Benjamin P. Lamberton, a rear admiral who served with Admiral Dewey in the Battle of Manila Bay in 1898 during the Spanish–American War.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Lamberton&quot; was laid down on 1 October 1917 by the Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company at Newport News, Virginia. She was launched on 30 March 1918, sponsored by Miss Isabell Stedman Lamberton, Admiral Lamberton&#x27;s granddaughter. The vessel was commissioned on 22 August 1918, Lieutenant Commander Frank Slingluff, Jr. in command.

==Service history==
===Pre-World War II===
After shakedown in the Caribbean Sea, &quot;Lamberton&quot; joined the United States Atlantic Fleet for maneuvers in the Atlantic Ocean off the Azores in early 1919. Reassigned to the newly formed United States Pacific Fleet, she departed Hampton Roads, Virginia, on 19 July 1919 and arrived at San Diego, California, on 7 August 1919.

Based at San Diego, &quot;Lamberton&quot; operated along the United States West Coast from August 1919 until June 1922. She participated in training maneuvers and performed experiments to improve naval tactics. She was decommissioned at San Diego on 30 June 1922.

&quot;Lamberton&quot; recommissioned on 15 November 1930, Lieutenant Commander S. N. Moore in command. Operating along the U.S. West Coast, she performed training exercises for nearly two years. She was reclassified as a &quot;miscellaneous auxiliary,&quot; AG-21, on 16 April 1932 and was converted to a target-towing ship. From 1933 until 1940 she operated from San Diego towing targets for surface ships, submarines, and aircraft. She also engaged in experimental minesweeping exercises off the U.S. West Coast and was reclassified as a &quot;destroyer minesweeper&quot;, DMS-2, on 19 November 1940. The actor Ernest Borgnine served aboard &quot;Lamberton&quot; until his discharge from the Navy in September 1941. After arriving at Pearl Harbor, Territory of Hawaii, on 11 September 1941, &quot;Lamberton&quot; resumed target towing and anti-submarine warfare (ASW) screening operations in the Hawaiian Islands.

===World War II===
&quot;Lamberton&quot; was escorting the heavy cruiser to Oahu in the Hawaiian Islands when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, bringing the United States into World War II. Following the attack, she returned to Pearl Harbor to sweep the harbor for mines. For the next seven months she remained on offshore patrol in the Hawaiian Islands.

Departing Pearl Harbor on 11 July 1942, &quot;Lamberton&quot; steamed north, arriving at Kodiak on Kodiak Island in the Territory of Alaska on 18 July 1942. She performed patrol and escort duty in the North Pacific Ocean during the Aleutian Islands campaign. In mid-May 1943, she escorted the U.S. Navy task group which brought reinforcements for the second amphibious landing at Massacre Bay on Attu Island during the Battle of Attu. &quot;Lamberton&quot; continued patrol operations off Attu until late June 1943, when she departed for Kuluk Bay on Adak Island. She then steamed to San Diego, arriving there on 23 July 1943. For the rest of World War II, she performed target-towing operations off the U.S. West Coast and from Pearl Harbor. &quot;Lamberton&quot; was reclassified as a miscellaneous auxiliary and again redesignated AG-21 on 5 June 1945, and, following the Japanese surrender that ended the war in August 1945, she operated as an auxiliary ship based at San Diego.

On 9 October 1945 &quot;Lamberton&quot; was one of 266 vessels damaged by Typhoon Louise when it struck Okinawa, and was one of 222 ships that ran aground during the typhoon. She later was refloated and returned to duty.

==Decommissioning and disposal==
&quot;Lamberton&quot; was decommissioned at Bremerton, Washington, on 13 December 1946 and was sold on 9 May 1947 to National Metal and Steel Corporation at Terminal Island in Los Angeles, California, for scrapping.

==Awards==
&quot;Lamberton&quot; received one battle star for her World War II service.

<doc id="757980" wikidata="Q991115" url="?curid=757980" title="Brownfield (software development)">
<text>Brownfield development is a term commonly used in the information technology industry to describe problem spaces needing the development and deployment of new software systems in the immediate presence of existing (legacy) software applications/systems. This implies that any new software architecture must take into account and coexist with live software already in situ.

In contemporary civil engineering, brownfield land means a property, the expansion, redevelopment, or reuse of which may be complicated by the presence or potential presence of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant.

Brownfield development adds a number of improvements to conventional software engineering practices. These traditionally assume a &quot;clean sheet of paper&quot;, tabula rasa or &quot;greenfield land&quot; target environment throughout the design and implementation phases of software development. Brownfield extends such traditions by insisting that the context (local landscape) of the system being created be factored into any development exercise. This requires a detailed knowledge of the systems, services and data in the immediate vicinity of the solution under construction.

== Addressing environmental complexity ==

Reliably re-engineering existing business and IT environments into modern competitive, integrated architectures is non-trivial. The complexity of business and IT environments has been accumulating almost unchecked for forty years making changes ever more expensive. This is because: 

*Environmental complexity is often expressed in legacy code. Legacy skills shortages are driving up maintenance and integration costs.
*Existing complex environments must be re-engineered in phases that make operational sense to their associated business function. These phases often default to wholesale, risky replacements of systems as ignorance of existing complexity means that potential incremental changes are too difficult to understand and engineer. 
*Accelerated development methods have left enterprises with modern legacy systems. Complex Java and .NET applications have many of the same problems as older COBOL applications.

As a result, an increasing proportion of the effort of developing new business capabilities is spent on understanding and integrating with the existing complex system and business landscape rather than delivering value. It has been observed that up to 75% of overall project effort is now spent on software integration and migration rather than new functionality. 

The IT industry as a whole has a poor success rate at delivering such large scale change for its clients. The CHAOS survey from the Standish Group has tracked an overall improvement in IT project delivery success over the last twenty years, but even in 2006 large IT projects still failed more often than succeeded. Engineering changes and in such environments has many parallels with the concerns of the construction industry in redeveloping industrial or contaminated sites. They are full of hazards, unexpected complexities and tend to be risky and expensive to redevelop. The accumulated complexity of IT environments has made them “Brownfield” sites.

It is not the complexity of the new function or any new system characteristics that are the root of large project failures – it is our understanding and communication of the overall requirement (as identified in The Mythical Man Month). To succeed, the requirements need to include a precise and thorough understanding of the constraints of the existing business and IT. Current “Greenfield” tooling and methods use early, informal and often imprecise abstractions that essentially ignore such complexity. Early, poorly informed abstractions are usually wrong and are often detected late in construction, resulting in delays, expensive rework and even failed developments. A Brownfield-oriented approach embraces existing complexity, and is used to reliably accelerate the overall solution engineering process, including enabling phased, incremental change wherever possible.

Brownfield takes the standard OMG model/pattern-driven approach and turns it on its head. Rather than taking the conventional approach of starting with a Conceptual model and driving down to Platform Specific Models and code generation, Brownfield starts by harvesting code and other existing artifacts and uses patterns to formally abstract upwards towards the Architecture and Business tier. 

Standard Greenfield techniques are then used in combination to define the preferred business target. This “meet in the middle” technique is familiar from other development methods, but the extensive use of formal abstraction and the use of patterns for both discovery and generation is novel.

The underlying conceptual architecture of all Brownfield tools is known as VITA. VITA stands for Views, Inventory, Transformation and Artifacts. In a VITA architecture, the problem definition of the target space can be maintained as separate (though related) native &quot;headfulls&quot; of knowledge known as Views. The core advantage of a View is that it can be based on pretty much any formal tool. Brownfield does not impose a single tool or language on a problem space – a core tenet is that the headfulls continue to be maintained in their native forms and tools.

Native Views are then brought together and linked into a single Inventory. The Inventory is then used with a series of Transformation capabilities to produce the Artifacts that the solution needs.

Views can currently be imported from a wide variety of sources including UML, XML sources, DDL, spreadsheets, etc. The Analysis and Renovation Catalyst tool from IBM has taken this capability even further via the use of formal grammars and Abstract Syntax Trees to enable almost any program to be parsed and tokenized into a View for inclusion into the Inventory.

The rapid cyclic nature of the discovery, re-engineer, generate and test cycle used in this approach means that solutions can be refined iteratively in terms of their logical and physical definitions as more of the constraints become known and the solution architecture is refined. 

Iterative Brownfield development can allow the gradual refinement of logical and physical architectures and incremental testing for the whole approach, resulting in development acceleration, improved solution quality and cheaper defect removal. Brownfield can also be used to generate solution documentation, ensuring it is always up to date and consistent across different viewpoints.

The Inventory that is created through Brownfield processed may be highly complex, being an interconnected multi-dimensional semantic network. The level of knowledge in the Inventory can be very fine grained, highly detailed and interrelated. Such things are hard to understand and can provide barriers to communication, however. Brownfield solves this problem by abstracting concepts via an artisan’s best guess, using known patterns in its Inventories to extract and infer higher level relationships.

Formal abstractions enable the complexity of the Inventory to be translated into simpler, but inherently accurate, representations for easier consumption by those that need to understand the problem space. These abstracted Inventory models can be used to automatically render multi-layered architecture representations in tools such as Second Life.

Such visualizations enable complex information to be shared and experienced by multiple individuals from around the globe in real time. This enhances both understanding and a sense of a single team.

<text>The Kingston Bridge is a balanced cantilever dual-span ten lane road bridge made of triple-cell segmented prestressed concrete box girders crossing the River Clyde in Glasgow, Scotland.

Carrying the M8 motorway through the city centre, the Kingston Bridge is one of the busiest bridges in Europe, carrying around 150,000 vehicles every day.

== History ==
The bridge was first proposed in 1945 as part of the Glasgow Inner Ring Road scheme. After feasibility studies were carried out, William Fairhurst was appointed consulting engineer for the design of the bridge and its approaches and on 15 May 1967 construction began; this was a joint venture between Duncan Logan (Construction) Ltd and Marples Ridgway. The eventual cost was £2.4m excluding the approach viaducts (or around £11m in total). On 26 June 1970 Kingston Bridge was opened by Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother.

The erstwhile Kingston Dock, which was located on the south bank of the river, was closed to allow for construction of the bridge. It had been completed in 1867 between Windmillcroft Quay and the former headquarters of the Scottish Co-operative Wholesale Society on Morrison Street, adjacent to where the bridge now stands. It was Glasgow&#x27;s first enclosed dock. The dock was eventually closed to navigation in 1966 when work began on the construction of the Kingston Bridge; the basin was subsequently filled in and housing built on the site. At the time of construction, however, the Clyde Port Authority still insisted that the bridge have a clearance height of 18 m (60 ft) in order to allow dredgers to go upstream as far as the King George V Bridge. 

When opened in 1970, the bridge was designed to handle 120,000 vehicles a day. By 1990, the sheer excess volume and weight of traffic, combined with poor design and flaws in construction, resulted in serious structural deterioration. A decade-long repair and renovation programme was initiated to repair and strengthen the bridge. These repairs have involved strengthening the quay walls and jacking-up the 52,000-tonne deck of the bridge, while still operational, to allow the construction of new supporting piers, before lowering the bridge back onto the new, more robust supports. It was described by the contractor Balfour Beatty as one of the most ambitious civil engineering projects to take place in the city. Indeed, the operation involved 128 hydraulic jacks, making it the biggest ever bridge lift, qualifying for the &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot;.

A longer-term attempt to solve the problem of chronic congestion is the M74 motorway northern extension, to act as the southern flank of the unbuilt Glasgow Inner Ring Road first planned in the 1960s. The existing &quot;ski jump&quot; where the Inner Ring was intended to continue on has remained unused; the extended M74 (opened on 28 June 2011) meets the M8 secondary carriageways a few hundred metres further south at Scotland Street giving both access to the northern end of the M77 motorway, but requires M74-to-M8 traffic and vice versa to leave one motorway and navigate through a few urban blocks to access the other. This change of plan from the Scottish Executive was because of the Kingston Bridge&#x27;s inability to handle an increase in traffic: the thinking was that the increased traffic from the new road would not then go straight over the bridge and would enable traffic from the south east (heading west either via the M8 or M77 to Ayrshire, Glasgow International Airport, Glasgow Prestwick Airport, the docks at Greenock and Hunterston or retail / entertainment complexes at Braehead and Silverburn) to bypass the north-eastern Glasgow and city centre sections of the M8. At the Public Inquiry into the road scheme, critics countered that this would mean an increase in ground-level traffic in the Tradeston area as commuters attempted to gain access to the bridge&#x27;s access ramps. Prior to the M74 completion, a solution to the congestion problems was the Clyde Arc or &quot;Squinty Bridge&quot;, which opened in September 2006 – this route was expected to take at least some of the local short-distance traffic away from the Kingston.

There is a dubious urban myth that the fourth man in the Williamwood bank robbery, Archie McGeachy, is buried in the pillars of the bridge. It features in the music video for the Simple Minds single &quot;Speed Your Love to Me&quot;.

The bridge&#x27;s 50th anniversary took place in 2020; at the end of that year it was listed at Category C by Historic Environment Scotland as a &quot;significant – albeit controversial – infrastructure project which transformed the city of Glasgow... also has special architectural interest&quot;.

== Location ==
The name of the bridge refers to the Kingston area on the south of the river.

The bridge connects Anderston and the city centre at Junction 18/19, and Kingston, Tradeston and the Gorbals at Junction 20. It consists of two parallel spans (so technically could be considered to be two separate bridges), each wide, with each supporting a deck with five lanes. The eastern span carries southbound traffic over the river and the western span carries northbound traffic. The approaches to the bridge are also linked with several junctions of their own, including ramps for the city centre, the M77 motorway and the Clydeside Expressway (A814), some of which are two lanes wide. The outer spandrels of the bridge are clad with exposed-aggregate panels showing vertical joints.

<text>The Clearwater Threshers are a Minor League Baseball team of the Florida State League and the Single-A affiliate of the Philadelphia Phillies. They are located in Clearwater, Florida, and have played their home games at BayCare Ballpark since 2004. They previously played at Jack Russell Memorial Stadium from 1985 to 2003.

The team began play in 1985 as the Clearwater Phillies and were named for their Major League Baseball affiliate. Clearwater became the Threshers in 2004 when the team moved to the new Spectrum Field.

In conjunction with Major League Baseball&#x27;s restructuring of Minor League Baseball in 2021, the Threshers were organized into the Low-A Southeast at the Low-A classification. In 2022, the Low-A Southeast became known as the Florida State League, the name historically used by the regional circuit prior to the 2021 reorganization, and was reclassified as a Single-A circuit.

==History==
===As the Clearwater Phillies===
Clearwater city officials approached the Philadelphia Phillies as early as 1981 about locating a Phillies minor league affiliate at Jack Russell Stadium in Clearwater. In July 1982, in a visit to Philadelphia, Clearwater city officials and the president of the Florida State League again asked the Philadelphia Phillies about affiliating with a team to be based in Clearwater. The Amateur Softball Association Clearwater Bombers had long used Jack Russell Stadium during the summer months when the field would be reconfigured for softball. The placement of a minor league baseball team would mean the relocation of the Bombers.

The Florida State League granted the city of Clearwater a franchise on September 26, 1984. The Clearwater Phillies began play in 1985 after the Philadelphia Phillies ended their affiliation with their High Class A minor league team, the Carolina League Peninsula Pilots, based in Hampton, Virginia, and placed their new team at Jack Russell Stadium. The Philadelphia Phillies owned the franchise and named the club the Clearwater Phillies. The Clearwater Phillies played their first game on April 12, 1985, at home, against the Tampa Tarpons.

The club played as the Clearwater Phillies through the 2003 season. The Phillies planned to leave Jack Russell Memorial Stadium after the 2003 season to move into a new ballpark, BayCare Ballpark, adjacent to the Carpenter Complex, the Phillies&#x27; minor league training facility. With the move to the new ballpark, the Clearwater Phillies were renamed the &quot;Threshers&quot; and adopted a new team logo and colors.

===Rebranding as the Threshers and Spectrum Field===

In 2004, the Clearwater Threshers were managed by former Phillies player and Hall of Famer, Mike Schmidt. Greg Legg managed the team in 2005 and 2006. Dave Huppert was the manager in 2007, and Razor Shines in 2008. Ernie Whitt was named the manager for the 2009 season after Shines was promoted to base coach for the New York Mets.

In 2007, the Threshers won the second half in the FSL West Division. They defeated the Sarasota Reds (2–1) in the FSL West Division Playoffs, then defeated the Brevard County Manatees 3 games to 1 in the FSL Championship Series (best-of-five) to win the FSL title. The Threshers were named MiLB.com&#x27;s Class A Advanced Team of the Year.

A single-game attendance record of 9,090 was set on July 3, 2008.

On July 26, 2009, Pedro Martínez made a rehab start for the Threshers against the St. Lucie Mets at Spectrum Field. Martinez pitched 1 innings before rain caused the game to be canceled, wiping out the official record of his start. Martinez subsequently moved to the Lehigh Valley IronPigs for his next start.

On May 23, 2011, the Threshers gained national attention after playing in a 23-inning game against the Jupiter Hammerheads.

<doc id="757991" wikidata="Q12018455" url="?curid=757991" title="Greenfield land">
<text>Greenfield land is a British English term referring to undeveloped land in an urban or rural area either used for agriculture or landscape design, or left to evolve naturally. These areas of land are usually agricultural or amenity properties being considered for urban development.

Greenfield land can be unfenced open fields, urban lots or restricted closed properties. They are kept off limits to the general public by a private or government entity.

Greenfield sites offer a high degree of freedom for a developer, compared to sites with existing developments. For example, a greenfield site is a welcome opportunity for a cable operator to choose equipment based on cost and aesthetic parameters, without considering migration issues related to legacy equipment on the site.

Rather than building upon greenfield land, a developer may choose to redevelop brownfield or greyfield lands, which have been developed but left abandoned or underused.

==Other uses==
The term has broadened in scope to refer to greenfield projects, which are not constrained by compatibility with prior work but also lack the benefit of existing infrastructure or testing.

<text>The Dunedin Blue Jays are a Minor League Baseball team of the Florida State League and are the Single-A affiliate of the Toronto Blue Jays Major League Baseball club. They are located in Dunedin, Florida, and play their home games at TD Ballpark, which opened in 1990 and seats 8,500 people.

Two teams named the Blue Jays, both affiliates of Toronto, have played in Dunedin: the original incarnation, from 1978 to 1979, and the current team, established in 1987. Since their inception they have won six division championships, in 1999, 2000, 2003, 2006, 2017, and 2022. In 2017 they were named co-champions of the FSL.

==History==
The original incarnation of the Dunedin Blue Jays was founded in 1978. They were established as the Class A affiliate of the new Toronto Blue Jays franchise. They played for two seasons in the Florida State League and were one of four Class A teams in Toronto&#x27;s farm system. After the 1979 season the team was disbanded as Toronto expanded its farm system into higher classifications.

Local interests were unable to sign a deal with other major league teams to keep minor league baseball in Dunedin; however Toronto continued to hold its spring training in the city. In 1987, Toronto decided to establish a new Florida State League franchise in Dunedin. They originally played at Grant Field until 1990, when Dunedin Stadium was completed.

When Major League Baseball owners considered locking out the regular players and using &quot;scabs&quot; instead for the 1995 season, Dunedin would have been used as the Toronto Blue Jays&#x27; home field due to Ontario laws concerning replacement workers. The MLB labor dispute was resolved before the plan was implemented, however.

In 2006, the Blue Jays made it to the Florida State League Championship Series, losing to the St. Lucie Mets 3 games to 0.

In 2007, the Dunedin Blue Jays were nominated for the 2007 Corporate Support Award, which is awarded annually by the Florida Recreation &amp; Park Association, to an organization that goes above and beyond to support and fund recreational programming.

On September 6, 2017, Dunedin won their first Florida State League championship by defeating the Tampa Yankees two games to one. Dunedin shared the FSL championship with the Palm Beach Cardinals, as the impending threat from Hurricane Irma forced the cancellation of the championship series.

For the 2019 season, the team played at Jack Russell Memorial Stadium while TD Ballpark underwent renovations.

As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 Minor League Baseball season was initially postponed before being cancelled on June 30 of that year. Due to the pandemic causing restrictions on travel between the United States and Canada, there were plans of the Toronto Blue Jays relocating to Dunedin for the 2020 MLB season. Ultimately the team decided to play the majority of their home games at the stadium of their Triple-A affiliate in Buffalo, New York.

In December 2020, as part of Major League Baseball&#x27;s reorganization of Minor League Baseball, the Dunedin Blue Jays were chosen to remain an affiliate of the Toronto Blue Jays. However, along with the other remaining teams of the Florida State League, the team changed classes from A-Advanced to Low-A and were placed in a league called the Low-A Southeast. In 2022, the Low-A Southeast became known as the Florida State League, the name historically used by the regional circuit prior to the 2021 reorganization, and was reclassified as a Single-A circuit.

<text>Aaron Lufkin Dennison (March 6, 1812 – January 9, 1895) was an American watchmaker and businessman who founded a number of companies.

==Early life==
Dennison was born in Freeport, Maine, after which the family moved to Brunswick, Maine. He was the son of Andrew Dennison, a boot and shoemaker who was also a music teacher. As a child, Aaron earned pocket money by carrying a builder’s hod, working as a herdsman, and as a clerk to a businessman. Later he cut and sold wood and then worked for his father in the cobbler’s shop until the age of 18. While there, he suggested the making of shoes in batches rather than one by one.

==Training in watchmaking==
In 1830, at the age of 18, Aaron was apprenticed to a Brunswick clockmaker, James Cary. During his apprenticeship, he is said to have made an automatic machine for cutting clock wheels, however in his autobiography he merely says he wanted “to cut all the wheels of a corresponding size in each [of a batch of clocks] at once and in other ways facilitate the work”. (Automatic watchmaking machinery was not developed until the 1860s and Dennison’s machine was probably a modification of an ordinary wheel cutting engine).

At age 21, Aaron declined the offer of a partnership with Cary and went to Boston, to work with the most skillful people he could find who were engaged in watch repairing. He worked for three months without pay at the jewelers Currier &amp; Trott and then stayed another five months on wages.

In 1834, he started his own business as a watch repairer, but after two years he gave it up and obtained a position with Jones, Low &amp; Ball and he worked there until 1839 under master watchmaker Tubal Howe. Here he learned the methods used by English and Swiss watchmakers.

In 1839, Dennison moved to New York City, where he spent several months with a colony of Swiss watchmakers engaged in various branches of the watch trade.
Dennison then returned to Boston and set up a business selling watches, tools and materials and doing repair work. During this time he created the Dennison Combined Gauge for measuring mainsprings and other watch parts.

==Marriage==
In 1840, Aaron married Charlotte Ware Foster (1811–1901) of Massachusetts. They had five children: Charlotte Elizabeth (1842), Alice (1845), Edward Boardman (1847), Ethie Gilbert 1850 and Franklin (1854).

==Paper box manufacture==
During the 1830s, Aaron Dennison assisted his younger brother Eliphalet Whorf Dennison to set up in business. Together they set up a jewelry store, but it was a failure. Then silk farming was considered. The third venture instigated by Aaron was to manufacture paper boxes for the jewelry business. This business was a success, but Aaron withdrew from it because of his increasing interest in the possibility of manufacturing watches. Under the supervision of Eliphalet Dennison, the company developed into the Dennison Manufacturing Company, which existed until 1990 when it merged and became the Avery Dennison Corporation with headquarters in Pasadena, California.

==Dennison, Howard &amp; Davis, and the Boston Watch Company==
About 1840, while Dennison was repairing watches, he began to wonder about manufacturing watches. After several years of thought, he conceived a plan to do so, even making a scale model. By around 1845, Dennison had decided to adopt the use of interchangeable parts, rather than crafting every watch by hand.

In 1849, Dennison approached Edward Howard, partner in the company Howard &amp; Davis, with his plan to manufacture watches. Howard agreed to the proposal and, with capital from Howard &amp; Davis and Howard’s father-in-law Samuel Curtis, they started in 1850. Dennison was the only person with knowledge of watchmaking.

A new building was erected adjacent to the Howard &amp; Davis factory in Roxbury, Massachusetts, for the firm Dennison, Howard &amp; Davis.

Dennison went to England to buy parts which could not be manufactured in America, to hire journeymen watchmakers to make the watches, and to learn the art of gilding brass watch plates. On his return, he designed and built machinery and made a model of the first watch to be made. However, the watch (which ran eight days and had a single mainspring barrel) did not keep time accurately enough to be used and the machinery was a failure. (Regarding the machinery, Dennison later admitted he had no ability as a machinist.) In addition, Dennison could not gild the plates successfully.

In 1852, Charles Moseley, a skilled machinist, and N. P. Stratton joined the company. While the machinery was rebuilt, Stratton designed a 30-hour watch and went to England to learn how to gild correctly. After this was done, watches were manufactured and sold.

In 1854, the company moved to a new factory in Waltham, Massachusetts, and took the name of the Boston Watch Company. Aaron Dennison was the factory superintendent. Watches were manufactured there until the company was forced into bankruptcy at the beginning of 1857.

==Tracy Baker &amp; Company, and the Tremont Watch Company==
After the bankruptcy, the company was effectively split into two parts. Most of the machinery and watches, together with some skilled workers, were taken back to Roxbury by Edward Howard, who established the Howard Watch Company. The buildings and large machinery were sold at auction to Royal E. Robbins who restarted watch manufacture under the name of Tracy Baker &amp; Company.

Aaron Dennison remained in Waltham as the superintendent of the mechanical department. In 1861 Robbins dismissed him for neglecting his duties and meddling with other departments.

In 1864, Aaron Dennison and A. O. Bigelow set up the Tremont Watch Company in Boston. The idea was that fine parts (such as escapements and wheel trains) would be made in Switzerland (where journeyman wages were lower than American wages), and the larger parts (such as barrel plates) and assembling would be done in America.

So Dennison went to Zurich, Switzerland, where he organized the manufacture and delivery of parts to Tremont.

In 1866, without the support of Aaron who was not consulted, the directors decided to move the factory to Melrose and make complete watches there, and Dennison withdrew from the company. The Melrose Watch Company failed in 1870.

In February 1871, Aaron moved from Zurich to England where he assembled some watches using parts left over from Zurich and plates from Tremont. He then helped organise the Anglo-American Watch Company in Birmingham, which was to use stock and machinery from the Melrose company. In 1874 the name was changed to the English Watch Manufacturing Company and it appears that Dennison left the company about this time.

==The Dennison Watch Case Company==
In about 1862, Aaron Dennison started a business making watch cases in Birmingham and supplied the London office of the Waltham Watch Company. In 1879, Alfred Wigley joined Aaron to form the firm of Dennison, Wigley &amp; Company. Following Aaron Dennison’s death in 1895, his son Franklin became a partner in the firm. This very successful company continued until 1905 when it was renamed the Dennison Watch Case Company, and that company continued until 1967.

<text>The Fort Myers Mighty Mussels are a Minor League Baseball team of the Florida State League and the Single-A affiliate of the Minnesota Twins. They are located in Fort Myers, Florida, and play their home games at the Lee County Sports Complex at Hammond Stadium, which has a capacity of 7,500 and opened in 1991. The park is also used as the Minnesota Twins&#x27; spring training facility.

The majority owner is Kaufy Baseball, LLC, a privately held company managed by John Martin, who purchased a controlling interest in the club from Andrew Kaufmann in January 2022.

==History==
The Mighty Mussels continue the proud tradition of the Florida State League baseball in Fort Myers that began in 1926 with the Fort Myers Palms. The modern day franchise began in Miami during the 1961–1962 offseason to serve as the Class D affiliate of the Philadelphia Phillies. The team was named the Miami Marlins in honor of the original Marlins of the Triple-A International League who had moved to San Juan, Puerto Rico (and subsequently Charleston, West Virginia), following the 1960 season.
In 1963, there was a restructuring of the classification system of all Minor League Baseball, which resulted in the FSL changing from Class D to Class A-Advanced. They became a Baltimore Orioles affiliate in 1966, and were renamed the Miami Orioles after their MLB parent club from 1971 to 1981. The Orioles owned the franchise until it was sold to an investment group led by then-Class AAA American Association president Joe Ryan on January 30, 1976.

Upon the Baltimore Orioles&#x27; severing of their affiliation with the Miami Orioles following the 1981 season, the franchise reverted to the Marlins name and participated in the 1982 FSL season as an independent entry. Without a Major League affiliate, this team was composed of undrafted players from the area, free agents from various organizations and players on loan from the Baltimore Orioles, San Diego Padres, and Oakland A&#x27;s organizations.

The following season the Miami Marlins became a San Diego Padres affiliate. This partnership lasted two years and the Marlins were without a parent club for the 1985 season. They filled their roster with ten former major leaguers looking to rejuvenate their careers, including Derrel Thomas, who made it back to MLB later that season with the Philadelphia Phillies. The Marlins continued this practice through the 1988 season. One of their signees in 1987, Dennis Martínez, also returned to MLB, signing with the Montreal Expos later that season. In 1987, the team started receiving some players on loan from the Tokyo Giants. This lasted through the 1988 season.

In 1988, the team began the season at Bobby Maduro Miami Stadium, but moved later in the season to the Miami-Hialeah Lakes High School field. The Marlins had per-game attendance totals of approximately 100 fans.

On , the South Florida Baseball Club Limited Partnership purchased the Marlins and were renamed the Miami Miracle. They moved the team from Miami Stadium, which the team had called home for the vast majority of its time in South Florida, to Florida International University&#x27;s University Park with some games to be held at Key West High School. South Florida BC LP consisted of Stuart Revo, managing partner, Marvin Goldklang, South Florida commercial real estate developer Michael M. Adler; Potamkin Television, New Age Broadcasting automobile dealership group Potamkin Companies president Alan Potamkin; Sillerman-Magee Communication Management Corp. CEO Robert Sillerman, actor Bill Murray and recording artist Jimmy Buffett. E.J. Narcise was named general manager. While having a partial affiliation with the Cleveland Indians and the Tokyo Giants of the Japanese league, the Miracle were considered an independent entry in the FSL.

The team received only nine players from the Indians for the 1989 season and had to scramble to find players like pitcher Longo Garcia who was released by the San Francisco Giants organization having been a tenth round draft pick. Jim Gattis was named manager by April 1989.
The Miracle were sold again a year later to the Marv Goldklang Group. Mike Veeck (son of Hall of Fame inductee Bill Veeck, and author of the book, &quot;Fun is Good&quot;) also became part owner of the organization while Murray and Buffett still maintained their shares as well.

In 1990, the team moved again, playing its home games at Pompano Beach Municipal Stadium. The team spent two seasons in Pompano Beach with future big league skipper Fredi González at the helm.

In 1992, with the impending arrival of MLB&#x27;s Florida Marlins, the Goldklang Group relocated the Miracle to Fort Myers. The Miracle operated as a co-op club with the Minnesota Twins that season, and became a full Twins affiliate a year later. The current Player Development Contract runs through 2018.

In December 2019, the franchise announced that it would be rebrand ahead of the 2020 season and become known as the Fort Myers Mighty Mussels.

In conjunction with Major League Baseball&#x27;s restructuring of Minor League Baseball in 2021, the Mighty Mussels were organized into the Low-A Southeast at the Low-A classification. In 2022, the Low-A Southeast became known as the Florida State League, the name historically used by the regional circuit prior to the 2021 reorganization, and was reclassified as a Single-A circuit.

==Mighty Mussels in Fort Myers==

Since moving to Fort Myers for the 1992 season, the Mighty Mussels have qualified for the Florida State League Playoffs eight times. As the Miracle, the club won the FSL West Division first half in 2003 and 2008 and the FSL West second half in 1995, 2000 and 2006. In 2009, the Florida State League adopted a North–South setup of divisions. In that year, the Miracle won both the FSL South first and second half under manager Jeff Smith. Despite a regular season record of 80–58 and winning game one of a best-of-three series on the road, the Charlotte Stone Crabs defeated the Miracle in games two and three.

After a three-season hiatus, the Miracle returned to the FSL Playoffs under first-year manager Doug Mientkiewicz. Guiding a star-studded team of Twins prospects such as Miguel Sano, Kennys Vargas and Eddie Rosario, the Miracle won the first half in the FSL South with a 45–22 record. The 45 wins tied the franchise record for the most in a single half and the winning percentage of .672 marked the best for a half in team history. Posting the best overall record in the Florida State League at 79–56 during the regular season, the Miracle again fell to the Stone Crabs in the FSL South Divisional Playoff. Charlotte held the league-best Fort Myers offense, that included the consensus top prospect in baseball Byron Buxton, to just one run in a two-game sweep.

==2014 championship season==
Entering the 2014 season, the Miracle had appeared in the Florida State League Championship series twice; losing to the Daytona Cubs in 1995 and 2008. For a second consecutive season, Mientkiewicz led the Miracle to a first half title in the FSL South, narrowly edging the St. Lucie Mets by one game in the standings with a final day win, 4–0, over the Bradenton Marauders. Fort Myers finished with a first half record of 41–28 with a roster featuring top prospects José Berríos, Jorge Polanco and Adam Brett Walker. During the 2014 campaign, Walker broke the Miracle franchise record for home runs in a season with 25; previously held by Brock Peterson with 21 in 2006. Walker was also a 2014 FSL All-Star Game MVP and Home Run Derby Champion at the 2014 FSL All-Star Game in Bradenton, at McKechnie Field. In the second half, the Miracle posted a record of 41–29 for an overall mark of 82–57, second-best in team history.

In the FSL South Divisional Playoff, the Miracle faced Bradenton. Trailing 7–3 in the top of the fourth inning, Jason Kanzler hit an opposite field grand slam to tie the game in the first of a best-of-three series. After the fifth inning, play was halted for 58 minutes due to rain. When the game resumed in the top of the sixth, Dalton Hicks drove in the eventual game-winning run with a single. The Miracle won game one, 8–7, and Kanzler had six runs batted in. In game two, the Miracle scored six runs in the bottom of the third inning to take 6–1 lead. Miracle starter D. J. Baxendale earned the win with six innings allowing just one unearned run and five strikeouts. After a two-game sweep of the Marauders, the Miracle advanced to the FSL Championship series for the third time in team history.

Facing the Cubs again, the Miracle hosted the first two games of the best-of-five series at JetBlue Park. The Miracle pitching staff allowed just one run in a pair of wins. Fort Myers took game one, 5–1, and game two, 5–0. With a 2–0 series lead for the Miracle, the Cubs staved off elimination in game three at Jackie Robinson Ballpark in Daytona, Florida After a two-hour, seven-minute delay, the Cubs and Miracle engaged in a back-and-forth battle with Daytona eventually going on to win, 8–7. The Cubs trailed 6–5 in the bottom of the eighth inning, but took the lead on a three-run homer by Wilson Contreras. After the Cubs&#x27; win, the two teams had to wait a day after heavy storms made the field in Daytona unplayable. On Monday, September 8, the Miracle and Cubs played game four. Fort Myers built a 2–0 lead midway through the fourth inning. Daytona tied the game in the sixth. Going into extra innings, Kanzler gave the Miracle a 4–2 lead with a two-run homer in the top of the eleventh. Zack Jones recorded a perfect ninth inning, striking out Contreras for the save. The FSL Championship was the first in team history since moving to Fort Myers in 1992. The series win also marked the first time the Daytona Cubs had lost a FSL Playoff series.

<text>&quot;Tom Dooley&quot; (Roud 4192) is a traditional North Carolina folk song based on the 1866 murder of a woman named Laura Foster in Wilkes County, North Carolina by Tom Dula (whose name in the local dialect was pronounced &quot;Dooley&quot;). One of the more famous murder ballads, a popular hit version recorded in 1958 by The Kingston Trio reached No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 singles chart, was in the top 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B chart, and appeared in the &quot;Cashbox&quot; Country Music Top 20.

The song was selected as one of the American Songs of the Century by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), the National Endowment for the Arts, and Scholastic Inc. Members of the Western Writers of America chose it as one of the Top 100 Western songs of all time.

&quot;Tom Dooley&quot; fits within the wider genre of Appalachian murder ballads. A local poet named Thomas Land wrote a song about the tragedy, titled &quot;Tom Dooley&quot;, shortly after Dula was hanged. In the documentary &quot;Appalachian Journey&quot; (1991), folklorist Alan Lomax describes Frank Proffitt as the &quot;original source&quot; for the song, which was misleading in that he did not write it. There are several earlier known recordings, notably one that G. B. Grayson and Henry Whitter made in 1929, approximately 10 years before Proffitt cut his own recording.

The Kingston Trio took their version from Frank Warner&#x27;s singing. Warner had learned the song from Proffitt, who learned it from his aunt, Nancy Prather, whose parents had known both Laura Foster and Tom Dula. In a 1967 interview, Nick Reynolds of the Kingston Trio recounted first hearing the song from another performer and then being criticized and sued for taking credit for the song. Supported by the testimony of Anne and Frank Warner, Frank Proffitt was eventually acknowledged by the courts as the preserver of the original version of the song, and the Kingston Trio were ordered to pay royalties to him for their uncredited use of it.

== History ==

In 1866, Laura Foster was murdered. Confederate veteran Tom Dula, Foster&#x27;s lover and the father of her unborn child, was convicted of her murder and hanged May 1, 1868. Foster had been stabbed to death with a large knife, and the brutality of the attack partly accounted for the widespread publicity the murder and subsequent trial received.

Anne Foster Melton, Laura&#x27;s cousin, had been Dula&#x27;s lover from the time he was twelve and until he left for the Civil War – even after Anne married an older man named James Melton. When Dula returned, he became a lover again to Anne, then Laura, then their cousin Pauline Foster. Pauline&#x27;s comments led to the discovery of Laura&#x27;s body and accusations against both Tom and Anne. Anne was subsequently acquitted in a separate trial, based on Dula&#x27;s word that she had nothing to do with the killing. Dula&#x27;s enigmatic statement on the gallows that he had not harmed Foster but still deserved his punishment led to press speculation that Melton was the actual killer and that Dula simply covered for her. (Melton, who had once expressed jealousy of Dula&#x27;s purported plans to marry Foster, died either in a carting accident or by going insane a few years after the homicide, depending on the version.)

Thanks to the efforts of newspapers such as &quot;The New York Times&quot; and to the fact that former North Carolina governor Zebulon Vance represented Dula &quot;pro bono&quot;, Dula&#x27;s murder trial and hanging were given widespread national publicity. A local poet, Thomas C. Land, wrote a song titled &quot;Tom Dooley&quot; about Dula&#x27;s tragedy soon after the hanging. Combined with the widespread publicity the trial received, Land&#x27;s song further cemented Dula&#x27;s place in North Carolina legend and is still sung today throughout North Carolina.

A man named &quot;Grayson&quot;, mentioned in the song as pivotal in Dula&#x27;s downfall, has sometimes been characterized as a romantic rival of Dula&#x27;s or a vengeful sheriff who captured him and presided over his hanging. Some variant lyrics of the song portray Grayson in that light, and the spoken introduction to the Kingston Trio version did the same. Col. James Grayson was actually a Tennessee politician who had hired Dula on his farm when the young man fled North Carolina under suspicion and was using a false name. Grayson did help North Carolinians capture Dula and was involved in returning him to North Carolina but otherwise played no role in the case.

Dula was tried in Statesville, North Carolina because it was believed he could not get a fair trial in Wilkes County. He was given a new trial on appeal but he was again convicted and hanged on May 1, 1868. On the gallows, Dula reportedly stated, &quot;Gentlemen, do you see this hand? I didn&#x27;t harm a hair on the girl&#x27;s head.&quot;

Dula&#x27;s last name was pronounced &quot;Dooley&quot;, leading to some confusion in spelling over the years. The pronunciation of a final &quot;a&quot; like &quot;y&quot; (or &quot;ee&quot;) is an old feature in Appalachian speech, as in the term &quot;Grand Ole Opry&quot;. The confusion was compounded by the fact that Dr. Tom Dooley, an American physician known for international humanitarian work, was at the height of his fame in 1958 when the Kingston Trio version became a major hit.

== Recordings ==

Many renditions of the song have been recorded, most notably:

* In 1929, G. B. Grayson and Henry Whitter made the first recorded version of Land&#x27;s song by a group well known at the time, for Victor.
* Frank Warner, Elektra, 1952. Warner, a folklorist, unaware of the 1929 recording, in 1940 took down the song from Frank Proffitt and passed it to Alan Lomax who published it in &quot;Folk Song: USA&quot;.
* On March 30, 1953, the CBS radio series &quot;Suspense&quot; broadcast a half-hour &quot;Tom Dooley&quot; drama loosely based on the song, which was sung during the program by actor Harry Dean Stanton. While not issued as a commercial recording, transcription discs of the broadcast eventually were digitized and circulated by old time radio collectors.
* The Folksay Trio, which featured Erik Darling, Bob Carey and Roger Sprung, issued the first post-1950 version of the song for &quot;American Folksay-Ballads and Dances, Vol. 2&quot; on the Stinson label in 1953. Their version was noteworthy for including a pause in the line &quot;Hang down your head Tom...Dooley&quot;. The group reformed in 1956 as The Tarriers, featuring Darling, Carey and Alan Arkin, and released another version of &quot;Tom Dooley&quot; for &quot;The Tarriers&quot; on the Glory label in 1957.

* The Kingston Trio recorded the most popular version of the song in 1958 for Capitol. This recording sold in excess of six million copies, topping the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart, and is often credited with starting the &quot;folk music boom&quot; of the late 1950s and 1960s. It only had three verses (and the chorus four times). This recording of the song was inducted into the National Recording Registry of the Library of Congress and honored with a Grammy Hall of Fame Award. The Grammy Foundation named it one of the Songs of the Century.
*Neil Young and Crazy Horse recorded an eight-minute version on their 2012 album &quot;Americana&quot;, on which they retitled the song to the proper spelling &quot;Tom Dula&quot; and pronounced it in such a way as to make it a political statement against former Republican House Majority Leader Tom DeLay.
* The French group Les Compagnons de la Chanson recorded a French version titled &quot;Tom Dooley (Fais ta priere)&quot;, which reached No. 1 on the Belgian chart and No. 4 on the French chart in 1959.

Other artists that have recorded versions of the song include Paul Clayton, Line Renaud, Bing Crosby, Jack Narz, Steve Earle the Grateful Dead, Arthur &quot;Guitar Boogie&quot; Smith, and Doc Watson. Lonnie Donegan also recorded the song in the UK. It spent 14 weeks in the British charts from November 1958, reaching its highest ranking at number 3 for 5 weeks.

==References in other songs==
* The third and final verse of country music singer Stonewall Jackson&#x27;s 1958 crossover hit &quot;Waterloo&quot; referenced Tom Dooley with the lyrics, &quot;Now he swings where the little birdie sings, and that&#x27;s where Tom Dooley met his Waterloo.&quot;
* Ella Fitzgerald drops an altered line from the song into a recording of &quot;Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer&quot; on her 1967 album, &quot;Ella Wishes You a Swinging Christmas&quot;.

===Parodies===
&quot;Tom Dooley&quot; prompted a number of parodies, either as part of other songs or as entire songs. For example:
*The Smothers Brothers did a version of the song on their 1961 debut album, &quot;The Smothers Brothers at the Purple Onion&quot;, which referenced the lawsuit against The Kingston Trio by claiming that Dickie Smothers had written it and The Kingston Trio had stolen it.
*The Four Preps used this song and &quot;Worried Man Blues&quot; to make fun of The Kingston Trio in their song &quot;More Money For You and Me&quot;.
*The Incredible Bongo Band recorded the song &quot;Hang Down Your Head Tom Dooley, Your Tie&#x27;s Caught In Your Zipper&quot; (1972).
*The Capitol Steps used this song to make fun of South Dakota Senator Tom Daschle on their 2003 album &quot;Between Iraq and a Hard Place&quot;.

== In popular culture ==
The Kingston Trio&#x27;s hit song was the inspiration for the 1959 film &quot;The Legend of Tom Dooley&quot;, starring Michael Landon as Dooley, and co-starring Richard Rust. A Western set in the immediate aftermath of the Civil War, it was not about traditional Tom Dula legends or the facts of the case, but a fictional treatment tailored to fit the lyrics of the song.

&quot;Tom Dooley&quot; is the name of a season 5 episode of &quot;Ally McBeal&quot;, in which John Cage sings a version of the song with his Mexican band.

The song was parodied in episode No. 702 of &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;. Crow T. Robot, motivated by one actor&#x27;s resemblance to Thomas Dewey, sang a version beginning &quot;Hang down your head, &quot;Tom Dewey&quot;.&quot;

Glada Barn&#x27;s version of Land&#x27;s song closes &quot;Rectify&quot; season 2 episode &quot;Mazel Tov&quot;.

In the 1980 film &quot;Friday the 13th&quot;, the campers in the opening scene start to sing the song. The opening scene is set in 1958, the year the Kingston Trio version of the song debuted.

Episode 10 of Santo, Sam and Ed&#x27;s Total Football Podcast is titled &quot;Hang Down Your Head Tom Dula&quot;. This naming was in reference to a sample of the song generated by Santo Cilauro whereby he jokingly claimed Tiziano Crudeli had performed a version of Tom Dooley with &quot;The Kingstown Trio&quot;. Crudeli&#x27;s bombastic commentary style on Diretta Stadio afforded him celebrity status in Italy, and audio of Crudeli&#x27;s pronunciation of various footballers&#x27; names was a constant running gag throughout the Total Football Podcast.

The Irish comedian Dave Allen did a sketch in which two cowboys with guitars sit by a hangman&#x27;s gallows, trying to compose a ballad. They try to think of a name to incorporate into their song, but have no success. Then Tom Dooley walks past, and they sing, &quot;Hand down your head, Tom Dooley&quot; and think that sounds great, so they hang him.

<text>The Lakeland Flying Tigers are a Minor League Baseball team of the Florida State League and the Single-A affiliate of the Detroit Tigers. They are located in Lakeland, Florida, and play their home games at Publix Field at Joker Marchant Stadium.

==History==

The team was established in 1960 as the Lakeland Indians, an affiliate of the Cleveland Indians. After a one-year hiatus, the team was restarted in 1962 as the Lakeland Giants, an affiliate of the San Francisco Giants. 

The franchise affiliated with the Detroit Tigers&#x27; farm system in 1963 and became known as the Lakeland Tigers before becoming the Flying Tigers in 2007. The relationship with Detroit is one of the two longest unbroken affiliate relationships currently existing.

 In 1997, playing with the Tigers, Gabe Kapler led the Florida State League in doubles and total bases, and tied for first in extra base hits. 

In 2012, the Flying Tigers won their first FSL title in 20 years by defeating the Jupiter Hammerheads, three games to two. It was the fourth league title in club history.

In 2006, the team introduced a new name and colors to pay homage to the Lakeland School of Aeronautics, later the Lodwick School of Aeronautics. The school trained over 8,000 pilots between 1940 and 1945, some of whom later flew with the Flying Tigers in China during World War II, and was actually located at the current site of Publix Field at Joker Marchant Stadium.

In conjunction with Major League Baseball&#x27;s restructuring of Minor League Baseball in 2021, the Flying Tigers were organized into the Low-A Southeast at the Low-A classification. In 2022, the Low-A Southeast became known as the Florida State League, the name historically used by the regional circuit prior to the 2021 reorganization, and was reclassified as a Single-A circuit.

<text>Tutbury is a village and civil parish in Staffordshire, England. It is north of Burton upon Trent and south of the Peak District. The village has a population of about 3,076 residents. It adjoins Hatton to the north on the Staffordshire–Derbyshire border.

== History ==
Tutbury is surrounded by the agricultural countryside of both Staffordshire and Derbyshire. The site has been inhabited for over 3,000 years, with Iron Age defensive ditches encircling the main defensive hill, upon which now stand the ruins of the Norman castle. These ditches can be seen most clearly at the Park Pale and at the top of the steep hills behind Park Lane.

The name Tutbury probably derives from a Scandinavian settler and subsequent chief of the hill-fort, Totta, &quot;bury&quot; being a corruption of &quot;burh&quot; the Anglo-Saxon name for &#x27;fortified place&#x27;.

Tutbury Castle became the headquarters of Henry de Ferrers and was the centre of the wapentake of Appletree, which included Duffield Frith. With his wife Bertha, he endowed Tutbury Priory with two manors in about 1080. It would seem that Tutbury at that time was a dependency of the Norman abbey of St Pierre‑sur‑Dives. 
St Mary&#x27;s Church, Tutbury was used by the local population as well as the priory, and it possibly predates the priory itself. Quarries near Tutbury once produced Nottingham alabaster, used for monumental carvings, and the priory church has a door with an alabaster arch (circa 1160) that is the only such arch known in the country.

One of the Royal Studs was established in the area round the castle by Henry VIII but had to be abandoned after the Civil War. Mary, Queen of Scots, was imprisoned in Tutbury Castle in 1569.

Until the 18th century, Tutbury was the site of an annual Court of Minstrels. There was even a &quot;King of the Minstrels&quot; and an annual Tutbury bull run.

There are some fine Georgian and Regency buildings and the half-timbered Dog and Partridge Hotel. There are antique and craft shops in the village, some of which have been run by the same families for many years.

Tutbury and Hatton railway station was opened by the North Staffordshire Railway on 11 September 1848. It then closed during the 1960s but was reopened in 1989. It is on the Crewe to Derby Line.

Until 2006, Tutbury Crystal, a manufacturer of high-quality cut glass products, was based in the village. However, production was transferred to Stoke-on-Trent as the existing factory was very old and was thought to be too small for the modern company&#x27;s requirements. The old factory was demolished and flats were built on the site, but a factory shop still operates in the village. Despite this, the tourism trade survives thanks to the long history of the church and castle.

== Media ==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC West Midlands and ITV Central. Television signals are received from the Sutton Coldfield TV transmitter. 

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Derby and Capital Mid-Counties (formerly Touch FM).

The town&#x27;s local newspaper is the &quot;Burton Mail&quot;.

&quot;The Natural History of Tutbury&quot;, describing the fauna and flora of the district surrounding Tutbury and Burton on Trent, by Sir Oswald Mosley and Edwin Brown, was published in 1863.

Tutbury was featured in the &quot;Most Haunted&quot; spin-off series &quot;Most Haunted: Midsummer Murders&quot;, in which the team investigated a murder over hidden treasure.

== Notable people ==

* Henry de Ferrers (fl. 1086), Norman magnate and land owner; founded Tutbury Priory where he was buried.
* William de Ferrers, 3rd Earl of Derby (died 1190), an English earl, lived in Tutbury Castle, and Robert de Ferrers, 6th Earl of Derby (1239–1279), one of his descendants, was born there.
* Ann Moore (1761–1813), the notorious &quot;fasting-woman of Tutbury&quot;, claimed to have eaten nothing at all from 1807 to 1813, but her claims were eventually shown to be a hoax; died locally.
* Benjamin Brook (1776–1848), nonconformist minister and religious historian, the first local pastor from 1801.

<text>The Sarasota Reds were a professional minor league baseball team, located in Sarasota, Florida, as a member of the Florida State League. The team originally started play in Sarasota as the Sarasota White Sox in 1989. They remained in the city for the next 21 seasons, going through a series of name changes due to their affiliation changes. They were known as the White Sox from 1989–1993, as the Sarasota Red Sox from 1994–2004, and the Reds from 2004–2009. In Sarasota, the team played in Payne Park (1989) and then Ed Smith Stadium (1990–2009). They won two division championships, in 1989 and 1992, and made playoff appearances in 1989, 1991, 1992, 1994, and 2007.

The roots of the Reds, however, can be traced back even further to the Tampa Tarpons. In the 1980s, rumors arose that a major league team would come to Tampa, which would threaten the viability of the Tarpons and other minor league teams in the Tampa Bay Area. In 1988, the Chicago White Sox replaced Cincinnati as the Tarpons&#x27; affiliate, causing speculation that the White Sox would themselves relocate to the area. Fearing his team would soon be displaced, in 1989, Tarpons owner Mitchell Mick sold his franchise to the White Sox, who moved it to Sarasota, Florida and renamed it as the Sarasota White Sox.

The team&#x27;s Sarasota era produced many notable player who would go on to play in majors. Bo Jackson, Mike LaValliere, Dave Stieb, Hall of Famer Frank Thomas and Bob Wickman all played for the Sarasota White Sox. Meanwhile, Stan Belinda, David Eckstein, Nomar Garciaparra, Byung-hyun Kim, Jeff Suppan, Dustin Pedroia, Jonathan Papelbon, and Kevin Youkilis were alumni of the Sarasota Red Sox. The Sarasota Reds also produced many notable major league players such as Jay Bruce, Johnny Cueto, Joey Votto, Chris Heisey, and Drew Stubbs.

After the Reds&#x27; spring-training departure from Florida&#x27;s Grapefruit League to Arizona&#x27;s Cactus League in 2009, the Reds and Pittsburgh Pirates did an &quot;affiliate-swap&quot;. The Pirates took over the Sarasota Reds, while the Reds became the parent club of the Pirates&#x27; former Class A-Advanced affiliate, the Lynchburg Hillcats of the Carolina League. The Pittsburgh Pirates have had their spring training facilities based in Bradenton, Florida since in 1969, when the city met with Pirates&#x27; general manager Joe Brown and owner John W. Galbreath and both sides agreed to a lease of 40 years, with an option for another 40 years. On November 10, 2009, baseball officials voted to allow the Pirates to purchase and uproot the Sarasota Reds. The Pirates moved the team to Bradenton, where they were renamed the Bradenton Marauders. The Marauders became the first Florida State League team located in Bradenton since the Bradenton Growers folded in 1926.

==Logos and uniforms==
The Sarasota teams&#x27; names, logos and team colors were all closely associated with each&#x27;s parent club. For example, the logos for Sarasota White Sox, Red Sox and Reds were just slightly altered versions of the parent club logos. However, there were attempts to allow some of these teams to find their own unique identities. In 2000, the Sarasota Red Sox introduced their mascot Gordy the Gecko. The Red Sox front office felt that since the team was based in Florida, its mascot should be reflective to the area. Soon Gordy found his way on to the team&#x27;s caps as an alternate logo.

<text> was an organization of filmmakers in France created in 1943. The most well-known members are Jacques Becker, Pierre Blanchar, Louis Daquin, Jean Painlevé, and Jean-Paul Le Chanois. Members of this organization made projects for French cinema for after the War. During the German occupation of France in World War II they made films about the Maquis, such as one showing a Maquis camp in Vercors. During the uprising in Paris, they filmed the documentary &quot;Journal de la Résistance: La Libération de Paris&quot;, (directed by André Zwoboda). Parts of this movie were used in the newsreel &quot;France Libre Actualités&quot;.

The group also created its own underground film journal called L’Ecran français in 1943. After the war, the publication became a place where film critics could debate each other, such as the iconic argument over Citizen Kane between Andre Bazin and Jean-Paul Sartre. The publication ended in 1953.

<text>The Codex Alimentarius Austriacus is a collection of standards, guidelines and product descriptions for a variety of foods. It was originally established by the Austrian-Hungarian Empire in 1891 and is still in use today. The Codex Alimentarius Austriacus standards are primarily the product of a voluntary effort of experts in the food industry and universities. While the standards laid out in the codex were not legally enforceable, they were nonetheless used by the courts to determine the identity and quality of a variety of food products.

== History ==

Until the mid-20th century, the Codex Alimentarius Austriacus was not well-known beyond the German-speaking countries of Europe. It subsequently lent its name to the international Codex Alimentarius Commission, the current international food codex collaboratively worked out by the Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Health Organization. Consisting of three volumes, the Codex was finished sometime between 1910 and 1917 by O. Dafert. It lacked actual integration into Austrian law until 1975. The idea of a Europe-wide Codex Alimentarius based on the Austrian model was actively pursued by Hans Frenzel of Austria between 1954 and 1958. Frenzel&#x27;s work culminated in the creation of the Council of the Codex Alimentarius Europaeus in June 1958, under the joint sponsorship of the International Commission on Agricultural Industries and the International Bureau of Analytical Chemistry. In 1975, the committee for the Codex Alimentarius Austriacus was reorganized to conform with Austrian food laws, which have a reputation of being some of the strictest food laws in the world.

<doc id="758019" wikidata="Q7681741" url="?curid=758019" title="Tampa Tarpons">
<text>The Tampa Tarpons are a Minor League Baseball team of the Florida State League and the Single-A affiliate of the New York Yankees. They are located in Tampa, Florida. The Tarpons play their home games at George M. Steinbrenner Field, which is also the spring training home of the New York Yankees and incorporates design elements from old Yankee Stadium in the Bronx, including identical field dimensions. They competed at the Class A-Advanced level from 1994 to 2020 before being reclassified Low Single-A in 2021. Since their inception, the club has won five league championships, in 1994, 2001, 2004, 2009, and 2010.

The club was established in 1994 as the Tampa Yankees and played for 24 seasons under that name. Before the 2018 season, the team was rebranded as the &quot;Tampa Tarpons&quot;, reviving a name that had been used by an earlier franchise in the FSL for over 30 years.

==History==
Tampa has a long history of amateur and organized baseball, with the first spring training held in the city in 1913 and the Tampa Smokers founded as charter members of the FSL in 1919. In anticipation of a potential Major League Baseball expansion team, the original Tampa Tarpons of the FSL relocated in 1988 and Al Lopez Field was demolished soon thereafter. However, the expected franchise was eventually awarded to nearby St. Petersburg, leaving Tampa without a professional baseball team or venue.

In 1994, the New York Yankees established a new Class A-Advanced FSL team and placed them in Tampa, replacing their previous Class-A Advanced affiliate, the Prince William Cannons. After operating as the Tampa Yankees for 24 seasons, the club was rebranded as the Tarpons in 2018, reviving the name of Tampa&#x27;s longest-lasting minor league ballclub. For the 2021 season, the FSL was reconfigured as a Low-A circuit, and the Florida State League name was retired, with the circuit being called the Low-A Southeast. In 2022, the Low-A Southeast became known as the Florida State League, the name historically used by the regional circuit prior to the 2021 reorganization, and was reclassified as a Single-A circuit.

On January 9, 2022, the Yankees announced that Rachel Balkovec has been hired to manage the Tarpons. She is the first woman to manage a minor league team affiliated with Major League Baseball.

Notable major league players to once play for the Tampa Yankees / Tarpons include Aaron Judge, Derek Jeter, Rubén Rivera, Mariano Rivera, David Robertson, Joba Chamberlain, Ian Kennedy, Phil Hughes, Ramiro Mendoza, Tim Raines, Eric Milton, and Luis Sojo.

==Ballpark==

As part of a deal with the city of Tampa, the Tampa Sports Authority agreed to publicly finance a new ballpark for the New York Yankees to use during spring training and the Tampa Yankees to use during the summer. Legends Field has the same dimensions as Yankee Stadium and includes some design elements of the previous ballpark in the Bronx. The Tampa Yankees played their first two seasons (1994 and 1995) at Red McEwen Field on the campus of the University of South Florida while their permanent home was under construction. In 1996, the New York Yankees held spring training at newly completed Legends Field, moving from their long-time spring facilities at Fort Lauderdale, and the Tampa Yankees played at the new ballpark that summer. In 2008, Legends Field was renamed in honor of ailing long-time Yankees owner George Steinbrenner, who lived in Tampa.

Steinbrenner Field has a baseball capacity of about 11,000 and is located across Dale Mabry Highway from the Tampa Bay Buccaneers&#x27; home of Raymond James Stadium. The facility has an adjacent parking lot that is sufficient for most minor league crowds, and a pedestrian bridge allows for spring training attendees to park at the football stadium&#x27;s much larger parking area and safely cross the busy highway to Steinbrenner Field.

In 2025, the Tampa Bay Rays will play at Steinbrenner Field as a result of hurricane damage to Tropicana Field. As a result, the Tarpons will play their home games at Community Field at GMS Field, a smaller practice field located next to Steinbrenner Field. Community Field has a capacity of 1,000.

<doc id="758026" wikidata="Q6785959" url="?curid=758026" title="Matador (English musical)">
<text>Matador is the title of a 1991 musical by Mike Leander and Eddie Seago, with a book by Peter Jukes, which tells the story of the rise and fall of a fictional matador, loosely based on Manuel Benitez, El Cordobes. The show featured stunning choreography in traditional Flamenco style by Rafael Aguilar, and the show won an Olivier Award as a result. Several dancers were cast directly from Spain, making their West End debuts. The bulls for the fighting sequences were performed by a phalanx of black-clad dancers, moving as one.

The work began life in 1987 as a concept album, starring Tom Jones. Jones was keen to play the lead on stage, and gave up his Las Vegas cabaret shows to return to the UK for that purpose. The musical was initially unable to attract the financial backing required, but Jones did get his first UK top ten hit after a fifteen-year dry spell, with his single, &quot;A Boy From Nowhere&quot;, lifted from the Matador concept album.

Eventually financial backing was secured, and the show opened at the Queen&#x27;s Theatre in London on April 16, 1991. Audiences and most critics were positive, but the 1991 London theatre season was heavily impacted by the Persian Gulf War and the subsequent drop in tourism. The production folded after three months. The London production starred John Barrowman as Domingo Hernandez and Stefanie Powers as American actress Laura Jane Wilding, a character based on actress Ava Gardner. Nicky Henson and Caroline O&#x27;Connor costarred.

After the failure of the London production, the authors returned to America and made revisions to the book and score during productions in regional and college theatres.

==Discography==
A cast recording was planned, but cancelled the day before it was due to be recorded. The show&#x27;s star, John Barrowman, recorded two songs from the score (&quot;I Was Born To Be Me&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;ll Dress You In Mourning&quot;) which were released as 45 RPM and CD singles timed to coincide with the London opening. Barrowman later recorded &quot;A Boy From Nowhere&quot; on his solo CD, Reflections (released by JAY records).

<text>USS &quot;Newcomb&quot; (DD-586) was a in the United States Navy during World War II. She was the only ship named for Commodore Frank H. Newcomb of the United States Revenue Cutter Service, Congressional Gold Medal recipient from the Spanish–American War.

&quot;Newcomb&quot; was laid down on 19 March 1943 by Boston Navy Yard and launched on 4 July 1943, sponsored by Mrs. C. C. Baughman. The ship was commissioned on 10 November 1943.

==History==
&quot;Newcomb&quot; shook down in the West Indies for a month, then made passage to the Marshall Islands, arriving 4 April 1944 for two months duty on antisubmarine patrol off the Japanese held Mille, Wotje, and Jaluit atolls. She next joined the assault on Saipan as flagship for the screen from 29 May until 5 August, serving as fire support and patrol ship at both Saipan and Tinian. On 22 June, while guarding transports, she and sank Japanese submarine , and on 4 July her well-directed fire broke up a Japanese banzai attack north of Garapan on Saipan.

Operating in the Fire Support and Bombardment Group for the assault on the Palaus 6 September to 1 October, &quot;Newcomb&quot; fired 23 separate shore bombardments and also covered underwater demolition teams providing bombardment control spotting. As flagship of Destroyer Squadron 56 (DesRon 56), &quot;Newcomb&quot; joined in the Leyte landings 12 October to 4 December, covering underwater demolition teams and firing preinvasion-bombardment, call-fire, night-harassing and illumination missions.

Her squadron made a night torpedo attack in the Surigao Strait phase of the Battle for Leyte Gulf 25 October. At least one of her five torpedoes struck the battleship , sunk in this action. Closely straddled but not damaged, &quot;Newcomb&quot; went to the aid of the stricken destroyer , providing medical aid and a tow out of the battle area. In this battle, &quot;Newcomb&quot; and her sister ships played a key role in the victory which insured the success of General Douglas MacArthur&#x27;s return to the Philippines, and effectively ended major Japanese naval threats for the remainder of the war.

Often under fire from Japanese aircraft, several of which she destroyed, &quot;Newcomb&quot; continued service in the Philippines, engaging Japanese shore batteries at Ormoc 9 December while screening landing craft, fighting a convoy through heavy enemy air attack to Mindoro 19 through 24 December, and driving off two &quot;kamikazes&quot; during the Lingayen landing on 6 January 1945. She covered operations in Lingayen Gulf through 24 January, then prepared for duty as fire support ship at Iwo Jima from 10 February, where she covered minesweeping for three days prior to the landing. During the invasion the destroyer engaged shore batteries and fired accurate bombardments of in assistance to troops ashore. She again engaged a Japanese submarine on 25 February, with unknown results.

Departing Iwo Jima on 10 March, &quot;Newcomb&quot; put in at Ulithi, where she was assigned to Task Force 54 (TF 54) for the invasion of Okinawa. &quot;Newcomb&quot; again covered underwater demolition and minesweeping operations as well as antiaircraft and shore bombardment until 6 April, when she was screening minesweepers off Ie Shima. At least 40 enemy aircraft were observed in the area during the day, and at 16:00 attacks began. Though handicapped by a low ceiling, her gunners were able to drive off or shoot down several attackers, but over a period of an hour and a half, she was struck five times. With the effort that won them a Navy Unit Commendation, her crew worked furiously to repair engine damage and extinguish fires, while continuing to fight their ship and maneuver to avoid further crashes. Aid was rendered by , herself struck by the fifth &quot;kamikaze&quot; skipping across from &quot;Newcomb&quot;, and . Afloat with fires and power out, the toll for the attack was 18 killed, 25 missing, and 64 wounded; &quot;Newcomb&quot; was towed to Kerama Retto by .
Repairs to her hull were made by under frequent enemy air attack, and on 14 June she left under tow for Saipan, Pearl Harbor, and San Francisco, arriving 8 August.

==Fate==
The end of the war ended further repairs, and &quot;Newcomb&quot; decommissioned on 20 November 1945. Stricken from the Navy List on 28 March 1946, she was scrapped at Mare Island Navy Yard in October 1947.

&quot;Newcomb&quot; received 8 battle stars for World War II service.

<doc id="758034" wikidata="Q1046492" url="?curid=758034" title="Water rocket">
<text>A water rocket is a type of model rocket using water as its reaction mass. The water is forced out by a pressurized gas, typically compressed air. Like all rocket engines, it operates on the principle of Newton&#x27;s third law of motion. Water rocket hobbyists typically use one or more plastic soft drink bottles as the rocket&#x27;s pressure vessel. A variety of designs are possible including multi-stage rockets. Water rockets are also custom-built from composite materials to achieve world record altitudes.

== Operation ==

The bottle is partly filled with water and sealed. The bottle is then pressurized with a gas, usually air compressed from a bicycle pump, air compressor, or cylinder up to 125 psi, but sometimes CO2 or nitrogen from a cylinder are used.

Water and gas are used in combination, with the gas providing a means to store energy, as it is compressible, and the water increasing the propellant mass fraction and providing greater force when ejected from the rocket&#x27;s nozzle. Sometimes additives are combined with the water to enhance performance in different ways. For example: salt can be added to increase the density of the reaction mass, resulting in a higher delta-v. Soap is also sometimes used to create a dense foam in the rocket which lowers the density of the expelled reaction mass but increases the duration of thrust.

The seal on the nozzle of the rocket is then released and rapid expulsion of water occurs at high speeds until the propellant has been used up and the air pressure inside the rocket drops to atmospheric pressure. There is a net force created on the rocket in accordance with Newton&#x27;s third law. The expulsion of the water thus can cause the rocket to leap a considerable distance into the air.

In addition to aerodynamic considerations, altitude and flight duration are dependent upon the volume of water, the initial pressure, the rocket nozzle&#x27;s size, and the unloaded weight of the rocket. The relationship between these factors is complex and several simulators have been written to explore these and other factors.
Often the pressure vessel is built from one or more used plastic soft drink bottles, but polycarbonate fluorescent tube covers, plastic pipes, and other light-weight pressure-resistant cylindrical vessels have also been used.

==Elements==

===Bottle===

Typically a single polyethylene terephthalate (PET) carbonated soft drink bottle serves as the pressure vessel. Multi-bottle rockets are created by joining two or more bottles in any of several different ways; bottles can be connected via their nozzles, by cutting them apart and sliding the sections over each other, or by connecting them opening to bottom, making a chain to increase volume. This adds complexity and the increased volume leads to increased weight - but this should be offset by an increase in the duration of the thrust of the rocket.

Multi-stage rockets are much more complicated. They involve two or more rockets stacked on top of each other, designed to launch while in the air, much like the multi-stage rockets that are used to send payloads into space.

===Gas===
Several methods for pressurizing a water rocket are used including:
* A standard bicycle/car tire pump, capable of reaching at least .
* Water pressure forcing all the air in an empty water hose into the rocket. Pressure is the same as the water main.
* An air compressor, like those used in workshops to power pneumatic equipment and tools. Modifying a high pressure (greater than 15 bar / 1500 kPa / 200 psi) compressor to work as a water rocket power source can be dangerous, as can using high-pressure gases from cylinders.
* Compressed gases in bottles, like carbon dioxide (CO2), air, and nitrogen gas (N2). Examples include CO2 in paintball cylinders and air in industrial and SCUBA cylinders. Care must be taken with bottled gases: as the compressed gas expands, it cools (see gas laws) and rocket components cool as well. Some materials, such as PVC and ABS, can become brittle and weak when severely cooled. Long air hoses are used to maintain a safe distance, and pressure gauges (known as manometers) and safety valves are typically utilized on launcher installations to avoid over-pressurizing rockets and having them explode before they can be launched. Highly pressurized gases such as those in diving cylinders or vessels from industrial gas suppliers should only be used by trained operators, and the gas should be delivered to the rocket via a regulator device (e.g. a SCUBA first-stage). All compressed gas containers are subject to local, state and national laws in most countries and must be safety tested periodically by a certified test center.
* Sublimating carbon dioxide gas from dry ice. Dry ice expands 800 times in volume upon sublimation. A #3 rubber stopper is forcefully inserted into the neck of a two-liter plastic bottle partially filled with water. The pressure builds up enough to pop the stopper out.
* Ignition of a mixture of explosive gases above the water in the bottle; the explosion creates the pressure to launch the rocket into the air.

===Nozzles===
Water rocket nozzles differ from conventional combustion rocket nozzles in that they do not have a divergent section such as in a De Laval nozzle. Because water is essentially incompressible the divergent section does not contribute to efficiency and actually can make performance worse.

There are two main classes of water rocket nozzles:

* Open also sometimes referred to as &quot;standard&quot; or &quot;full-bore&quot; having an inside diameter of ≈22mm which is the standard soda bottle neck opening.
* Restricted which is anything smaller than the &quot;standard&quot;. A popular restricted nozzle has an inside diameter of 9mm and is known as a &quot;Gardena nozzle&quot; named after a common garden hose quick connector used to make them.

The size of the nozzle affects the thrust produced by the rocket. Larger diameter nozzles provide faster acceleration with a shorter thrust phase, while smaller nozzles provide lower acceleration with a longer thrust phase.

===Fins===
As the propellant level in the rocket goes down, the center of mass initially moves downwards before finally moving upwards again as the propellant is depleted. This initial movement reduces stability and can cause water rockets to start tumbling end over end, greatly decreasing the maximum speed and thus the length of glide (time that the rocket is flying under its own momentum).

To lower the center of pressure and add stability, fins or other stabilizers can be added which bring the center of drag further back, well behind the center of mass at all times. Stabilizers of any sort are normally placed near the back of the bottle where the center of mass is found. The increase in stability which well-designed fins give is worth the extra drag, and helps to maximize the height to which the rocket will fly.

===Landing systems===

Stabilizing fins cause the rocket to fly nose-first which will give significantly higher speed, but they will also cause it to fall with a significantly higher velocity than it would if it tumbled to the ground, and this may damage the rocket or whomever or whatever it strikes upon landing.

Some water rockets have parachute or other recovery system to help prevent problems. However, these systems can suffer from malfunctions. This is often taken into account when designing rockets. Rubber , Crumple zones, and safe launch practices can be utilized to minimize damage or injury caused by a falling rocket.

Another possible recovery system involves simply using the rocket&#x27;s fins to slow its descent and is sometimes called &quot;backward sliding&quot;. By increasing fin size, more drag is generated. If the center of mass is placed forward of the fins, the rocket will nose dive. In the case of super-roc or back-gliding rockets, the rocket is designed such that the relationship between center of gravity and the center of pressure of the empty rocket causes the fin-induced tendency of the rocket to tip nose down to be counteracted by the air resistance of the long body which would cause it to fall tail down, and resulting in the rocket falling sideways, slowly.

===Launch tubes===
Some water rocket launchers use launch tubes. A launch tube fits inside the nozzle of the rocket and extends upward toward the nose. The launch tube is anchored to the ground. As the rocket begins accelerating upward, the launch tube blocks the nozzle, and very little water is ejected until the rocket leaves the launch tube. This allows almost perfectly efficient conversion of the potential energy in the compressed air to kinetic energy and gravitational potential energy of the rocket and water. The high efficiency during the initial phase of the launch is important, because rocket engines are least efficient at low speeds. A launch tube therefore significantly increases the speed and height attained by the rocket. Launch tubes are most effective when used with long rockets, which can accommodate long launch tubes.

==Competitions==
The Water Rocket Achievement World Record Association is a worldwide association which administrates competitions for altitude records involving single-stage and multiple-stage water rockets, a flight duration competition, and speed or distance competitions for water rocket–powered cars.

Many local competitions of various sorts are held, including:

* In Scotland, the Oscar Swigelhoffer Trophy is an Aquajet (Water Rocket) competition held at the Annual International Rocket Week in Largs or nearby Paisley, and organized by STAAR Research through John Bonsor. The competition goes back to the mid-1980s, organized by the Paisley Rocketeers who have been active in amateur rocketry since the 1930s. The trophy is named after the late founder of ASTRA, Oscar Swiglehoffer, who was also a personal friend and student of Hermann Oberth, one of the founding fathers of rocketry. The competition involves team distance flying of water rockets under an agreed pressure and angle of flight. Each team consists of six rockets, which are flown in two flights. The greater distance for each rocket over the two flights is recorded, and the final team distances are collated, with the winning team having the greatest distance. The winner in 2007 was ASTRA.
* In the United Kingdom, the largest water rocket competition is currently the National Physical Laboratory&#x27;s annual Water Rocket Challenge. The competition was first opened to the public in 2001 and is limited to around 60 teams. It has schools and open categories, and is attended by a variety of &quot;works&quot; and private teams, some travelling from abroad. The rules and goals of the competition vary from year to year.
* In Germany, the oldest and most popular water rocket competition is the Freestyle-Physics Water Rocket Competition. () The competition is one part of a larger part of a student physics competition, where students are tasked to construct various machines and enter them in competitive contests.
* In the United States, the Science Olympiad also runs water rocket event for elementary school age contestants.
* In Pakistan a water rocket competition is held every year in World Space Week by Suparco Institute Of Technical Training (SITT) in which different schools from all over the Pakistan take part.
* In Ukraine, a Water Rocket Competition is held every year in the Center for Innovative Technology in Education (CITE). and schools from all over Ukraine take part. The design of the rockets is standardized. The competition promotes the selective collection of solid dry waste in schools.
* In Russia, Water Rocket.

===World records===

The Guinness World Record of launching most water rockets is held by Royal College, Colombo when on 10 November 2017, they launched 1950 of them at the same time.

The Guinness World Record for the largest water rocket, measuring tall and in diameter, is held by the NPO Showa Gakuen (Japan). It was presented, measured and launched on 2 June 2022, in Taiki, Hokkaido, Japan. The previous record holder was National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom) with a water rocket measuring tall and in diameter. It was presented, measured and launched on 15 June 2011.

The current record for greatest altitude achieved by a water and air propelled rocket is , held by the University of Cape Town, achieved on 26 August 2015, exceeding the previous 2007 record of held by US Water Rockets. The rocket also carried a video camera as payload as part of the verification required by the competition rules.

== Hot water rockets==
A steam rocket, or &quot;hot water rocket&quot;, is a rocket that uses water held in a pressure vessel at a high temperature, and which generates thrust through this being released as steam through a rocket nozzle.

<doc id="758041" wikidata="Q1324085" url="?curid=758041" title="Pancrase">
<text>is a Japanese mixed martial arts (MMA) promotion company based in Tokyo. It was founded in 1993 by professional wrestlers Masakatsu Funaki and Minoru Suzuki.

The name was based on pankration, a fighting sport in the Ancient Olympic Games. Suzuki and Funaki practiced catch wrestling. They based the promotion and its rules on professional wrestling. The promotion&#x27;s champions were called &quot;King of Pancrase&quot;.

The rules allowed closed-fisted punches, except to the head, and palm strikes to the head. A wrestler must break a submission hold when the opponent reaches the ropes, but a wrestler who claims a rope break loses a point. A wrestler who claims a specified number of rope breaks (between 3 and 5) was disqualified. From 1998 to 2000, the promotion changed its rules to resemble other mixed martial arts promotions.

Beginning in 2007, Pancrase: Legends of Mixed Martial Arts aired weekly on ImaginAsian TV. The network folded in 2011.

In 2008, the Fight Network began airing Pancrase events in Canada and the United Kingdom.

==History==

===Establishment and first event===
In 1993, Masakatsu Funaki, Minoru Suzuki, Ken Shamrock, Takaku Fuke, and others from the shoot-style Fujiwara Gumi wrestling promotion left the company, due to (mentor and promoter) Yoshiaki Fujiwara&#x27;s decision to cooperate with the likes of Universal Lucha Libre and W*ING and favoring showmanship over in-ring work. As suggested by Karl Gotch, Pancrase was formed by Funaki, Suzuki and Fuke, and the promotion would focus on pure shoot-style wrestling with limited gimmicks and no predetermined outcomes.

Funaki and Suzuki were students of wrestler Antonio Inoki. They were inspired by the 1976 Muhammad Ali vs. Antonio Inoki event that pit a boxer against a wrestler.

On May 16, 1993, they established World Pancrase Create Inc. (WPC) with the capital of 30,000,000 Japanese yen.

On September 21, 1993, Pancrase promoted their first event at Tokyo Bay NK Hall. All the matches were finished with knockout and submission.

===Early era===
The first King Of Pancrase Open Weight champion was Ken Shamrock (later becoming famous for his exploits in the Ultimate Fighting Championship), who had previous experience in the newborn UWF and Fujiwara Gumi. Over the years, Funaki and Suzuki held the title alongside other big names, such as Bas Rutten, Frank Shamrock and Guy Mezger.

Pancrase now recognizes King of Pancrase titles in the super heavyweight, heavyweight, light heavyweight, middleweight and welterweight divisions, and there are plans to award new lightweight and featherweight champions in the future. The open weight title was recently restored and is currently held by Josh Barnett, who formerly competed in PRIDE and the Ultimate Fighting Championship. Minoru Suzuki no longer competes for Pancrase, as he returned to regular professional wrestling in 2003 as a freelancer, but he primarily competes in New Japan Pro-Wrestling.

===Founding of Pancrase Korea===
Pancrase Korea is the South Korean subsidiary of the Pancrase Inc. and held several events from 2007 to 2010. The first Pancrase Korea event was an amateur one held on March 10, 2007, in Busan and the last one was the semi-professional &quot;Neo-Blood Tournament 2 &amp; Hybrid Challenge 12&quot; held on September 12, 2010, in Seoul.

===Changes in management===
In May 2008, &quot;Pancrase Inc.&quot; was established as a new management company for Pancrase, and WPC alienated Pancrase Inc. their all of business as on May 27, 2008. When Pancrase Inc. was established, Yasushi Sakamoto, a managing director of WPC, was installed as the executive president.

On October 14, 2008, Pancrase Inc. moved its office to Nishi Ikebukuro in the ward of Toshima in Tokyo.

In September 2009, Pancrase Inc. moved its office from Nishi Ikebukuro to Aobadai in ward of Meguro in Tokyo, and moved again to Kameido in the ward of Koto.

On October 1, 2010, Ryo Kawamura, who was the current mixed martial artist was installed as the executive president. Yasushi Sakamoto, the former president, had become a managing director.

Kawamura held a press conference in Yokohama, Kanagawa, on October 22, and explained about restructuring and announced that &quot;Commission Council&quot; had been established as a third party

On June 1, 2012, Pancrase announced that the promotion had been sold to Masakazu Sakai and his Smash organization, with Sakai taking over as the new president and his partner Yuji Shimada as the event producer of the promotion. As part of the reconstruction of Pancrase, the new owners intend to replace rings with cages, holding events to test the new format in 2013.

Pancrase 257 on March 30, 2014, was the last event where Pancrase used a ring, and by Pancrase 258 on May 11, 2014, Pancrase adopted the decagon or the ten-sided cage of their American partners World Series of Fighting.

===Organizational change===
On March 9, 2022, the Smash Martial Arts Department Pancrase Business Headquarters will be reorganized and operated as the &quot;Pancrase Executive Committee&quot;.

In addition, the King of Pancrase Executive Committee will also be reorganized and operated as the &quot;King of Pancrase Council&quot;.
==Rules==

===Original rules===
Aside from the traditional grappling rules (e.g., no biting, no eye-gouging) the rules were formerly as follows:
* No elbows to the head (neither while standing nor on the ground).
* No closed-fist strikes to the head (neither while standing nor on the ground).
* No knees to the head on the ground.
* No kicks/stomps to the head on the ground.
* If a participant gets too close to the ropes, he is stood back up on the feet. (as opposed to PRIDE&#x27;s re-centering in the middle of the ring)
* Non-title matches consist of one 15 minute round, while title matches consist of one 30 minute round.
* If a participant is caught in a submission and taps out (whether unable to reach the ropes or not), it is a loss.
* Five &quot;escapes&quot; are given to each fighter at the start of every match. An escape can be used when caught in a submission near the ropes, in which case the participant can grab them, be stood back on the feet and have one point deducted. Once a participant has used all of his escapes, it is a loss.
* For knockouts, a ten-count similar to boxing and kickboxing is used. If the participant is unable to answer the ten-count, it is declared a TKO and that fighter has lost the match. However, if the participant is able to answer the ten-count, the fight resumes and one point is deducted.
* If, at the end of regulated time, neither fighter has submitted, been knocked out, or lost all their points, a decision is rendered based on who lost fewer points. If neither fighter lost any points, or both lost the same number of points, the fight is declared a draw.
* In the 1994 King of Pancrase tournament, the rules were slightly different, in that the first round had one 10-minute round and three rope escapes, and the finals had one 20-minute round with three rope escapes.
* For a short period of time when Bas Rutten was the King of Pancrase, heelhooks were banned because of the frequency of injuries.
* Strikes on the ground – whether closed fist to the body or open hand to the head – were discouraged by the fans, but still legal.

===Present-day Japanese rules===
After Pancrase: Breakthrough 1 held on January 19, 1999, Pancrase began to use a ruleset similar to that of Pride FC, but prohibits knees to the head of grounded opponents.

In May 2016, Pancrase adopted the Association of Boxing Commissions and Combative Sports rules, better known as the Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts.

===Weight classes===

==Current Pancrase champions (King and Queen of Pancrase)==

The current weight division system of Pancrase is based upon the Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts since December 4, 2007. At this time, Pancrase also announced establishment of Flyweight and Bantamweight, and abolition of Super heavyweight. On March 18, 2011, Pancrase restructured their weight classes adding several more lower weight classes. In addition, they introduced the Queen Of Pancrase title which will be used for women&#x27;s fights in the future.

<text>The Scotland national rugby union team represents the Scottish Rugby Union in men&#x27;s international rugby union. The team takes part in the annual Six Nations Championship, where they are the current Calcutta Cup and Doddie Weir Cup holders. They also participate in the Rugby World Cup, which takes place every four years.

The history of the team dates from 1871, when the Scottish rugby team played their first official test match, winning 1–0 against England at Raeburn Place. Scotland competed in the Five Nations from the inaugural tournament in 1883, winning it 14 times outright—including the last Five Nations in 1999—and sharing it another eight. In 2000, the competition accepted a sixth competitor, Italy, thus forming the Six Nations. Since this change, Scotland have yet to win the competition. The Rugby World Cup was introduced in 1987 and Scotland have competed in all ten competitions, the most recent being in 2023, where they failed to reach the quarter-finals. Their best finish came in 1991, where they lost to the All Blacks in the third place play-off.

Scotland have beaten all major rugby union playing nations except for New Zealand, the best result being two draws. As of 14 February 2024, Scotland are sixth in the World Rugby Rankings.

== History ==
=== 1871–1924 ===


In December 1870 a group of Scots players issued a letter of challenge in &quot;The Scotsman&quot; and in &quot;Bell&#x27;s Life in London&quot;, to play an England XX at rugby rules. This led to the first-ever rugby international match being played at Academical Cricket Club&#x27;s ground at Raeburn Place, Edinburgh, on Monday 27 March 1871. In front of around 4,000 spectators, the Scots won the encounter by a try (made by Angus Buchanan) and a goal (made by William Cross) to a solitary try scored by England (a points scoring system had not then been devised so only the goal counted towards the 1–0 score). England later won the return match at the Kennington Oval, London in the following year.

The Calcutta Cup was donated to the Rugby Football Union in 1878 by the members of the short-lived Calcutta Rugby Club. The members had decided to disband: the cup was crafted from melted-down silver rupees which became available when the club&#x27;s funds were withdrawn from the bank. The Cup is unique in that it is competed for annually only by England and Scotland. The first Calcutta Cup match was played in 1879 and, since that time, over 100 matches have taken place.

=== Origins of the Nations Championship ===
In 1882 the Home Nations Championship, the fore-runner of the modern Six Nations Championship was founded with Scotland, England, Wales and Ireland taking part. The Scots enjoyed occasional success in the early years, winning their first Triple Crown in 1891 and repeating the feat again in 1895, and vying with Wales for dominance in the first decade of the 20th century. Further Triple Crowns wins for Scotland followed in 1901, 1903 and 1907. However, Scotland&#x27;s triumph in 1907 would be the last for eighteen years as the First World War (1914–1918) and England&#x27;s dominance afterwards would deny them glory.

=== Home ground ===
In 1897 land was purchased by the SFU at Inverleith, Edinburgh. Thus the SFU became the first of the Home Unions to own its own ground. The first visitors were Ireland, on 18 February 1899 (Scotland 3–9 Ireland). International rugby was played at Inverleith until 1925. The SFU bought some land and built the first Murrayfield Stadium which was opened on 21 March 1925.

=== 1925–1945 ===
In 1925 Scotland already had victories over France at Inverleith (25–4), Wales in Swansea (24–14) and Ireland in Dublin (14–8). England, the Grand Slam champions of the two previous seasons were the first visitors to Murrayfield. 70,000 spectators saw the lead change hands three times before Scotland secured a 14–11 victory which gave them their first-ever Five Nations Grand Slam.

In 1926, Scotland became the first Home nation side to defeat England at Twickenham after England had won the Grand Slam five times in eight seasons.

The outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939 brought rugby union in Scotland to a halt. The SRU cancelled all arranged trial and international matches and encouraged the member clubs to carry on as best they could. Some clubs closed down, others amalgamated and carried on playing other local clubs and, sometimes, teams from the armed forces stationed in their various areas.

=== 1946–1987 ===

Internationals resumed in the 1946–47 season, although these were not formally recognised and no caps were awarded to participating players. In January 1946, Scotland played and defeated a strong New Zealand Armed Forces team by 11–6. Scotland resumed full international matches in February 1947, losing 22–8 to Wales at Murrayfield.

The period after World War Two was not a successful one for Scotland. In 1951, the touring Springboks massacred Scotland 44–0 scoring nine tries, a then record defeat. Scotland suffered 17 successive defeats between February 1951 and February 1955, scored only 54 points in these 17 games: 11 tries, six conversions, and four penalties.

The teams from 1955 to 1963 were an improvement. There were no wins over England, but three of the games were drawn. Occasional wins were recorded against Wales, Ireland and France. 1964 was a good year for Scotland. New Zealand were held to a 0–0 draw, the last international match in which no points were scored. The Calcutta Cup was won 15–6, the first time since 1950 and they shared the Five Nations title in 1964 with Wales.

In 1971 the SRU appointed Bill Dickinson as their head coach, after years of avoidance, as it was their belief that rugby should remain an amateur sport. He was officially designated as an &quot;adviser to the captain&quot;. Scotland were the first of the Home Unions to run a truly nationwide club league. This was introduced in 1973 and still flourishes today with several of the country&#x27;s original clubs still very much in evidence, such as Heriots, West of Scotland, Watsonians and the famous &#x27;border&#x27; clubs such as Gala, Hawick, Jed-Forest, Kelso and Melrose. However the advent of professionalism saw Scotland&#x27;s District championship abandoned and two &#x27;Super Districts&#x27; formed, which have resulted in the top players generally being unavailable for their clubs. These teams play in international club competitions such as the Heineken Cup and the Pro14.

On 1 March 1975, around 104,000 spectators watched Scotland defeat Wales 12–10 in a Five Nations match at Murrayfield. The attendance at the time was a World Record for a Rugby Union match, and remains the record attendance at Murrayfield. That win was part of a run of nine successive wins at Murrayfield during the 1970s for the national side, but they were unable to transfer that form outwith Scotland, only managing two away wins during the decade. In 1977 Nairn McEwan succeeded Bill Dickinson as national coach. However, he was only able to win one international in his three years in charge. Nevertheless, rugby in Scotland was clearly developing. The establishment of the national leagues in 1973–74 was beginning to bear fruit; the standard of club and district rugby was higher than ever and players were more accustomed to experiencing pressure in matches where the result really mattered. Fewer players were being selected from English clubs to represent Scotland as the domestic game was producing an adequate number of players of genuine international class for the first time since the First World War.

Jim Telfer became national coach in 1980, inheriting a squad of genuine potential. In March 1982 Scotland won away in Wales for the first time in 20 years. Scotland toured Australia in July 1982 and won the first test, Scotland&#x27;s first away victory against any of the big three Southern Hemisphere sides. After this, the 1983 season was a disappointment; losing their first three Five Nations matches. However, the tournament ended on a high when Scotland recorded only their second victory over England at Twickenham since 1938. Scotland then went on to draw with the All Blacks 25–25 in the late autumn.

Scotland recovered their form in 1984 and achieved their second Grand Slam, and their first since 1925, under the captaincy of Jim Aitken. The team benefited from consistent selection – 12 players took part in all four Five Nations matches, and of the 20 players used in total throughout only two played for clubs outwith Scotland. Jim Telfer stood down after the Grand Slam to concentrate on his professional career as a school master. He was succeeded by his assistant, the former Hawick fly-half, Colin Telfer (not a relative). He lasted just over a year, enduring a whitewash in the 1985 Five Nations, before resigning to concentrate on his business. Derrick Grant was then appointed head coach.

In January 1986, a trial match between &quot;Blues&quot; (players expected to feature for Scotland) and &quot;Reds&quot; (emerging players with a possible international future) resulted in a shock 41–10 win for the &quot;Reds&quot;. The &quot;Reds&quot; team included Gavin and Scott Hastings, Finlay Calder and David Sole, all of whom who would debut for Scotland in the Five Nations that year and feature prominently for side in the years that followed. Scotland went on to share the 1986 Five Nations championship with France, each side winning three out of their four games. The series also saw Scotland thrash England 33–6 at Murrayfield; Scotland&#x27;s record win over the English, at the time one point short of Scotland&#x27;s best score in any rugby union international and England&#x27;s heaviest defeat in over a century.

=== 1987–2000 ===
Scotland went to the first World Cup, played in New Zealand and Australia in the summer of 1987. John Rutherford, the team&#x27;s general and controlling influence, had injured his knee on an unauthorised tour of Bermuda. He broke down after less than a quarter of an hour of the first World Cup match against France and never played for Scotland again. Scotland had been in the lead but the match finished level. Scotland lost to New Zealand in the quarter-final. On 27 June 1988, Ian McGeechan was appointed as head coach to succeed Derrick Grant who had retired after the end of the 1988 Five Nations series.

Their greatest year in the modern era was 1990, when their season came down to one game, a Grand Slam decider at Murrayfield against the &quot;auld enemy&quot;, England. Both sides had won all their Five Nations fixtures, and England were overwhelming favourites despite being the away side. Scotland under the captaincy of prop David Sole went on to win 13–7, and with it their third Grand Slam. The match against England in 1990 was also only the second time that Flower of Scotland was played at Murrayfield, having become Scotland&#x27;s pre-match national anthem that year.

SRU made NO money from sponsorship after their 1990 Grand Slam as their thistle was not registered. As a result, a new logo – a thistle containing a rugby ball – was designed in October 1990 by graphic designer Chic Harper (www.chicharper.com). This was launched on Thursday 22 November at Murrayfield, Edinburgh with a £1M sponsorship deal with Umbro. The new logo was first worn on the nation&#x27;s shirts at Parc des Princes, Paris on Saturday 19 January 1991 with the name &#x27;Scottish Rugby Union&#x27; below the thistle. This was soon replaced with just &#x27;Scottish Rugby&#x27;. In recent times, the wording has been dropped altogether to leave only the thistle as the symbol of the Scottish team.

The second World Cup took place in 1991 with matches shared between the Five Nations. Scotland won their pool, though the game against Ireland was close, and then beat Western Samoa in the quarter-final. They lost to England in the semi-final held at Murrayfield to a Rob Andrew drop goal. In the third place play-off they were beaten by New Zealand. Scotland went through 1994 without a single win, but bounced back in 1995 to win their first three Five Nations matches. This run of wins included a 23–21 win away against France, courtesy of a last minute try and conversion by Gavin Hastings. This was Scotland&#x27;s first win in Paris since 1969. The last Five Nations match was another Grand Slam decider against England; however, this time the English defeated the Scots 24–12, largely due to the kicking prowess of Rob Andrew.

The third World Cup, held in South Africa, came in 1995. Pool play saw a narrow defeat by France, thanks to an injury-time try, and Scotland finished second in the pool. They were eliminated in the quarter-final against New Zealand. Scotland won the last-ever Five Nations Championship in 1999 with a last minute win by Wales over England. However, in the 1999 World Cup they suffered a quarter-final defeat to New Zealand.

=== 2000–2008 ===

Scotland endured a torrid Six Nations in 2000, losing their first four straight games. but won the final game against England 19–13 under captain Andy Nicol.

Australian coach Matt Williams became the first foreigner to coach Scotland in 2003. However his tenure was both controversial and unsuccessful, marred by a string of poor results and fall-outs with coaches and players. In 2004 Williams attempted to introduce a controversial &quot;Fortress Scotland&quot; policy, whereby only those currently playing in Scotland were eligible to play in the national team. Meanwhile, the Scottish Rugby Union (SRU) came under new management, chief executive Phil Anderton (known as &#x27;Firework Phil&#x27; for his pre-match entertainment spectacles) was leading the way back to financial solvency and implementing major reforms to reverse the decline of the game in Scotland, but he resigned in January 2005 after his boss David Mackay was forced to resign by the SRU&#x27;s general committee. By April 2005, Scotland had won only three out of 17 matches under Williams. Following a review by the SRU and public criticism from several of his players, Williams was finally sacked on 25 April 2005.

Frank Hadden, the head coach of Edinburgh Gunners, was appointed interim coach for the 2005 summer internationals against the Barbarians and Romania, winning both. On 15 September 2005, he was appointed national coach of the Scotland team. In the first match of the 2006 Six Nations campaign, against France, Scotland won 20–16, and this was the first time since 1999 that they had beaten France. Scotland also beat England 18–12 at home at Murrayfield to reclaim the Calcutta Cup.

In the 2006 Autumn internationals Scotland won two of three fixtures. They convincingly beat Romania and put up a solid first half performance against the Pacific Islanders. In the final match against Australia, Scotland failed to impress, with Australia winning 44–15.

In 2007, Scotland became the first Six Nations team to lose at home to Italy, 17–37. This was Italy&#x27;s biggest ever victory over Scotland, home or away. Later that year, the side travelled to France for the 2007 Rugby World Cup. They made their way through their group and reached the quarter finals, where they were knocked out by Argentina.

Scotland opened their 2008 Six Nations campaign losing 27–6 to France at home. Pressure on Frank Hadden started to intensify after Scotland lost to Wales and then to Ireland. They then defeated England in the Calcutta Cup with a 15–9 victory before succumbing to Italy, avoiding the wooden spoon only on scoring difference. They then toured Argentina in the summer to play two tests against Argentina. They lost the first test 21–15, but won the second 26–14.

=== 2009–present ===

In a dismal 2009 Six Nations campaign, Scotland won just one match for a second consecutive year (against Italy) and thus, on 2 April 2009 Frank Hadden resigned as head coach of the national side. On 4 June 2009, ex-England, Edinburgh and Bath coach Andy Robinson was named head coach in time for the 2009 Autumn Internationals. Scotland&#x27;s form picked up with a 23–10 victory over Fiji and a memorable 9–8 win against Australia (the first win over the Wallabies for 27 years) at Murrayfield. In the 2010 Six Nations Scotland lost against France, Wales and Italy before drawing with England. Against Ireland, in the final rugby match at Croke Park, Scotland gained their only win of the tournament 23–20 with a last-minute penalty by Dan Parks, denying the Irish the Triple Crown and assuring they themselves would avoid the wooden spoon. That summer, Scotland toured Argentina and recorded their first ever away series victory, beating the Pumas in both tests, 24–16 and 13–9. In the Autumn Internationals of 2010, Scotland lost heavily against New Zealand before recording victories against South Africa, 21–17, and Samoa, 19–16. Scotland had a poor showing in the 2011 Six Nations, winning just one match, a 21–8 victory over Italy. In the 2011 Rugby World Cup, Scotland struggled to beat Romania 34–24 and Georgia 15–6, before losing 13–12 to Argentina. Needing a win going into their final match against England in Auckland, they led 12–3 with a quarter of the game to go, only to lose out to a Chris Ashton try, going down 16–12. This was the first time Scotland had been knocked out in the group stages of the Rugby World Cup.

Scotland&#x27;s performance was weak during the 2012 Six Nations, picking up the wooden spoon and being whitewashed, despite promising moments, and falling to 12th, Scotland&#x27;s lowest ever in the IRB rankings. Even after this whitewash, Scotland defeated Australia 9–6 in the 2012 Scotland rugby union tour of Australia, Fiji and Samoa. This was Scotland&#x27;s first win in Australia since 1982 and the first time in 30 years that Scotland defeated Australia more than once in a row. Scotland also recorded away wins over both Fiji and Samoa. During Scotland&#x27;s 2012 Autumn Tests they suffered a series of defeats, versus the All Blacks, South Africa and most notably Tonga, which caused head coach Andy Robinson to resign. Scott Johnson became interim head coach for the team in December 2012. During the 2013 Six Nations, Scotland won their matches against Italy and Ireland to finish third, their best finish in the competition since 2006. On 3 May 2013, Johnson was named the first ever Director of Rugby for Scotland responsible for overseeing all rugby in the nation. On 27 May 2013, it was announced that Vern Cotter would become head coach of Scotland, but the SRU had to wait until 2014 as club Clermont failed to reach an agreement with the SRU to release Cotter a year early from his contract.

Scotland had a dismal 2014 Six Nations campaign; managing only one win (away in Italy), finishing second bottom and defeated 51–3 by Wales in the final match. Vern Cotter finally assumed his role as head coach, and in June of the same year Scotland won three tests against the top teams of the Americas, before being hammered by South Africa 55–6. The three autumn tests held at Murrayfield during November yielded wins over Argentina and Tonga, and a narrow defeat against New Zealand. The test against Tonga took place at Rugby Park, Kilmarnock, and was the first Rugby Union international to be played on an artificial surface.

The 2015 Six Nations Championship ended in a whitewash for Scotland, despite optimism amongst players and supporters beforehand. However, Scotland displayed improved performances in their World Cup warm-up games over the summer, with two wins over Italy and narrow defeats away in Ireland and France. Scotland played well at the 2015 Rugby World Cup in England; qualifying from their group by beating Japan, USA and Samoa, although they lost to South Africa. Scotland played Australia in the quarter-finals, and with 30 seconds remaining led 34–32. However, referee Craig Joubert then awarded the Wallabies a highly controversial penalty, later judged by the game&#x27;s ruling body to be incorrect, which Bernard Foley scored to give Australia victory.

Scotland lost their first two games in the 2016 Six Nations Championship, extending their losing streak in the Six Nations to nine matches, their worst run in the championship since the 1950s. The Scots finally ended their losing run with a 36–20 win over Italy in Rome; John Barclay, John Hardie and Tommy Seymour all scoring tries. Scotland followed that win up with a victory over France at Murrayfield; Stuart Hogg, Duncan Taylor and Tim Visser scoring tries in a 29–18 win. It was Scotland&#x27;s first victory over France since 2006, and also ended a 10 match losing streak against &quot;Les Bleus&quot;. Scotland had a successful tour of Japan in June (winning both test matches), and during the Autumn Internationals recorded a third consecutive win against Argentina (their seventh recognised win overall against the Pumas).

In the 2017 Six Nations, Scotland saw a marked improvement in performance with three home wins and two away defeats. This was Vern Cotter&#x27;s last tournament as head coach of Scotland, despite them also beating Australia 24–19 on the summer tour of the Southern Hemisphere. In their first 6Ns game, Scotland went in with confidence to win their first opening match for eleven years against Ireland in a close match at Murrayfield Stadium. This followed with a defeat in Paris to France. Scotland secured a win over Wales in their third game, Scotland&#x27;s first since 2007. In the eagerly anticipated Calcutta Cup tie against England at Twickenham, however, Scotland were thrashed 61–21. This was a record defeat against the English, and a result which ended their hopes of winning the Six Nations. In the last week, Scotland defeated Italy at Murrayfield with a 29–0 victory, securing fourth place in the tournament table.

Gregor Townsend took over as head coach in June 2017. His first fixture as head coach was against Italy in Singapore where Scotland won 34–13. A week later Scotland defeated Australia 24–19 in Sydney, the second time in a row Scotland had won on Australian soil. The victory was made more notable by the list of absentees, such as Stuart Hogg and Grieg Laidlaw, who were in New Zealand on Lions&#x27; duty. The tour was concluded by a 27–22 loss to Fiji in Suva. Victory over Samoa in November 2017 was followed by a breathtaking performance against New Zealand at a sold-out Murrayfield. Tries from Jonny Gray and Huw Jones brought Scotland to 17–22 with barely a minute to go, but it took a superb cover tackle from the All Blacks fly-half Beauden Barrett to prevent Stuart Hogg from scoring a winning try. A week later Scotland registered a record win over the Wallabies, who played with 14 men for the majority of the game after Kepu&#x27;s dismissal, inflicting eight tries on the visitors in what was the Australian hooker Stephen Moore&#x27;s final international game. Scotland won 53–24, their biggest ever margin of victory over Australia.

In the 2019 Rugby World Cup, Scotland took an early exit with losses to both Ireland and the hosts. Scotland did however score ninety-five unanswered points across two wins against Samoa and Russia.

On 6 February 2021, Scotland won their first game of that year&#x27;s Six Nations tournament, defeating England 6 – 11 at Twickenham for the first time since 1983 and securing the Calcutta Cup. On 13 February they lost their next match, against Wales, 25–24 at Murrayfield. In 2024 the Scotland Rugby Men&#x27;s Team featured in a Netflix documentary Six Nations: Full Contact.

== Thistle and the anthem ==
The thistle is the national flower, and also the symbol of the Scotland national rugby union team. According to legend the &quot;guardian thistle&quot; has played its part in the defence of Scotland against a night attack by Norwegian Vikings, one of whom let out a yell of pain when he stepped barefoot on a thistle, alerting the Scottish defenders. The Latin Nemo me impune lacessit (&quot;No-one provokes me with impunity!&quot; in English) is an ancient motto of the Kings of Scotland, and also of Scotland&#x27;s premier chivalric order, the Most Ancient and Most Noble Order of the Thistle, and of the Scots Guards (the latter both &quot;belonging&quot; to the monarch).

&quot;Flower of Scotland&quot; has been used since 1990 as Scotland&#x27;s unofficial national anthem. It was written by Roy Williamson of The Corries in 1967, and adopted by the SRU to replace &quot;God Save the Queen&quot;. In the first year of using &quot;Flower of Scotland&quot; as an anthem, Scotland walked onto the pitch at the beginning of the Five Nations Championship deciding match against England. This combination was explosive and Scotland went on to beat England 13–7 and win the Five Nations Championship with a Grand Slam. 
Before &quot;Flower of Scotland&quot; was adopted as national anthem, &quot;Scotland the Brave&quot; was played for Scotland in the 1987 Rugby World Cup. Said song was usually immediately played before &quot;God Save the Queen&quot; when Scotland was playing at home (during the entrance of the teams), as result from a decision of the SRU to defuse any possibility of a &quot;national embarrassment&quot; (which the Scottish press feared) caused by the crowd booing the latter anthem, as the Queen was visiting Murrayfield during the 1976 Calcutta Cup.

== Strip ==

Scotland have traditionally worn navy blue jerseys, white shorts and blue socks. On the occasion that Scotland is the home side and the opposing team normally wears dark colours, Scotland will use its change strip. Traditionally this is a white jersey with navy blue shorts and socks. For a brief period, when Cotton Oxford were the shirt sponsors, the white shirt was replaced by a bright orange one with orange and blue hoops on the sleeves. This was first used against the New Zealand Māori on 14 November 1998. This change strip was replaced by the traditional white one just two years later. Also during this sponsorship deal, purple was introduced to the traditional blue jersey. This was a significant departure from the traditional colours of blue and white, although purple is inspired from the thistle flower.

=== Kit manufacturers and shirt sponsors ===

SRU made NO money from sponsorship after their 1990 Grand Slam as their thistle was not registered. As a result, a new logo – a thistle containing a rugby ball – was designed in October 1990 by graphic designer Chic Harper (www.chicharper.com). This was launched on Thursday 22 November at Murrayfield, Edinburgh with a £1M sponsorship deal with Umbro. The new logo was first worn on the nation&#x27;s shirts at Parc des Princes, Paris on Saturday 19 January 1991 with the name &#x27;Scottish Rugby Union&#x27; below the thistle. This was soon replaced with just &#x27;Scottish Rugby&#x27;. In recent times, the wording has been dropped altogether to leave only the thistle as the symbol of the Scottish team. 
In September 1993, a sponsorship deal was announced with The Famous Grouse, resulting in a sponsors&#x27; name being added to Scottish international players&#x27; kit for the first time in addition to the jersey manufacturers&#x27; emblem. In 1997 a new deal saw the Grouse logo appear on the Scotland jersey. Further deals followed and it became the longest association with a sponsor in world rugby. During this time, when Scotland played test matches in France, The Famous Grouse logo was replaced by the initials &quot;TFG&quot; due to the Evin law that bans any alcohol advertisement (including in sports events) in France. In May 2007, after seventeen years, The Famous Grouse ended its shirt sponsorship with the team. The Famous Grouse did maintain a low profile link to the Scottish Rugby Union by becoming the main spirit sponsor. This deal is thought to be worth a tenth of the original cost and forbids the Scottish Rugby Union from affiliating itself from any other whisky manufacturer.

On 3 September 2007 it was announced that the then Rangers chairman Sir David Murray&#x27;s company would become the new shirt sponsor, in a deal worth £2.7million over three years. In August 2011, the Royal Bank of Scotland took over as main sponsors of Scottish Rugby, after Sir David Murray&#x27;s company decided to end their sponsorship. BT became the primary shirt sponsor as part of the £20 million deal signed in 2014. In the summer of 2021 Peter Vardy Group replaced BT as principal partner and shirt sponsor.

Between the 2007 Rugby World Cup warm up games and the 2013 South African quadrangular tournament, the fonts used for their number kit on the back of their kits were Crillee Extra Bold Italic. But since Macron took over as kit supplier, the number fonts on the back of their kits were Arial rounded MT bold (or Oswald Bold, during the 2015 Rugby World Cup).

== Home stadium ==

Scotland play at Murrayfield Stadium which is the largest sports stadium in Scotland and with a capacity of 67,144 - the fifth largest in the UK. In the early years the Scottish rugby team played at Inverleith in the north of Edinburgh. In 1923 SRU identified 19 acres of land at Murrayfield in the west of the city on which to build a purpose-built stadium, purchasing this from Edinburgh Polo Club. One stand and three embankments were constructed over the following two years with the first international match taking place in 1925 where 70,000 people watched Scotland win 14–11 against England, thereby securing both the championship and a Grand Slam.

The stadium has been developed over the years with the East Stand built in 1983, the new North and South stands in 1993 and a redeveloped West Stand completed in 1994.

Murrayfield&#x27;s record attendance of 104,000 was set on 1 March 1975 when Scotland defeated 12–10 during the 1975 Five Nations Championship. This attendance stood as a world record until 1999 when 107,042 attended the Bledisloe Cup match between Australia and New Zealand in Stadium Australia.

=== Six Nations ===
Scotland competes annually in the Six Nations Championship, which is played against five other European nations: France, England, Ireland, Italy and Wales. The Six Nations started out as the Home Nations Championship in 1883, with Scotland sharing the championship with England in 1886 before winning the title outright for the first time a year later. Scotland have won the title outright 14 times and shared the championship a further eight times. Scotland have won three Grand Slams (including the Triple Crown) in 1925, 1984 and 1990, in addition to a further seven Triple Crowns. They also contest the Calcutta Cup with England as part of the championship. Scotland were the winners of the last Five Nations in 1999, before Italy joined the competition to make it the Six Nations.

==== Trophies within the Six Nations ====

The Triple Crown is awarded to the Scotland, England, Ireland or Wales national side if they can beat the other three &#x27;Home Nation&#x27; sides in the Six Nations tournament of that year. Ireland is the current holder.

The Calcutta Cup is awarded to the winner of the Scotland – England match in the Six Nations tournament. Scotland is the current holder.

The Centenary Quaich is awarded to the winner of the Scotland – Ireland match in the Six Nations tournament. Ireland is the current holder.

The Auld Alliance Trophy is awarded to the winner of the Scotland – France match in the Six Nations tournament. France is the current holder.

The Doddie Weir Cup is awarded to the winner of the Scotland – Wales match in the Six Nations tournament. Scotland is the current holder.

The Cuttitta Cup is awarded to the winner of the Scotland – Italy match in the Six Nations tournament. Scotland is the current holder.

Beating all the sides in the Six Nations is called a Grand Slam but this has no trophy.

=== Individual trophies ===

The Hopetoun Cup is awarded to the winner of Scotland – Australia test matches. Scotland is the current holder.

The Douglas Horn Trophy is awarded to the winner of Scotland – Canada test matches. Scotland is the current holder.

===Rugby World Cup===
Scotland has competed in every Rugby World Cup since the inaugural tournament in 1987. Their best finish was fourth in 1991. In their semi-final on 26 October 1991 Scotland lost 6–9 to England at Murrayfield after Gavin Hastings missed a penalty almost in front of and a short distance from the posts. On 30 October Scotland lost the third-place play-off to New Zealand in Cardiff 13–6. Since then they have qualified for the quarter-finals in all but three occasions, in 2011, 2019 and 2023. In 2015, they came within 30 seconds of a famous win over Australia; however, a last minute penalty sealed the win for the Wallabies.
=== Overall ===
Scotland achieved 100 points for the first time in defeating a Japan side 100–8 on 13 November 2004. The previous record had been 89–0 against Côte d&#x27;Ivoire (Ivory Coast) in the first round of Rugby World Cup 1995. The game versus Japan was played at the home of St Johnstone F.C., McDiarmid Park, Perth. It was the first time that Scotland had ever played &quot;North of the Forth&quot; (i.e. the Firth of Forth) in the Caledonian region. In the same game Chris Paterson moved ahead of Andy Irvine in the list of Scotland&#x27;s all-time points scorers.

== Coaches ==
Before 1971, there was no appointed coach of the Scotland team, the role being assumed by the captain. In 1971, the SRU appointed the first coach as &quot;adviser to the captain&quot;. He was Bill Dickinson, a lecturer at Jordanhill College, and his contribution to Scottish rugby in the 1970s was immense. Nairn McEwan took the reins in 1977 for three years before the team was led by Jim Telfer in 1980. Colin Telfer took over for a year before being succeeded by Derrick Grant in the autumn of 1985. From 1988 onwards, Scotland was coached by Jim Telfer, Richie Dixon or Ian McGeechan until 2003 when the Australian Matt Williams was appointed, becoming the first non-Scot to coach the national side. Scotland have appointed a further three non-Scottish coaches to lead the national side, the others being Scott Johnson, an Australian, Andy Robinson, an Englishman, and Vern Cotter from New Zealand.

Robinson took the reins in 2009 after Frank Hadden stepped down. Robinson was no stranger to Scottish rugby as, like his predecessor Hadden, had been the head coach of Edinburgh Rugby and joint coach of Scotland A before being promoted head coach of the national side. Scott Johnson was Robinson&#x27;s assistant coach when Robinson stood down in 2013, which ended in the result of Johnson being announced as interim head coach for Scotland in 2013, taking the team through the 2013 Six Nations Championship and the 2013 South African Quadrangular Tournament. Vern Cotter was announced as Scottish Head coach but would not take up on the role until June 2014 as he had one year left on his contract with Clermont Auvergne. This meant that Scott Johnson would remain as Interim Coach until the end of that year&#x27;s Six Nations Championship.

In August 2016 it was announced that Gregor Townsend would replace Vern Cotter as Scotland head coach in June 2017 when his contract expired.

<text>Lieutenant General Sir William Babtie, (7 May 1859 – 11 September 1920) was a British Army officer, a physician and a Scottish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth armed forces. His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Army Medical Services Museum in Aldershot.

==Early career==
Babtie graduated from the University of Glasgow with a Bachelor of Medicine and also received the LRCP and LRCS from the University of Edinburgh Medical School in 1880.

==South Africa and the Victoria Cross==
Babtie was 40 years old, and a major in the Royal Army Medical Corps, British Army, during the Second Boer War on 15 December 1899 at the Battle of Colenso when he won his Victoria Cross (VC). He exposed himself to heavy fire to tend to the wounded including going with Captain Walter Congreve to bring in Lieutenant Frederick Roberts, who was lying wounded on the veldt. The full citation was published in the &quot;London Gazette&quot; on 20 April 1900 and reads:
Babtie had previously been made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George in June 1899 for services rendered in the occupation of Crete.

==After South Africa==
Babtie was promoted to lieutenant colonel on 29 November 1900, and was in early January 1901 appointed for temporary duties in the Home District as he returned to the United Kingdom. He was appointed Assistant-Director, Army Medical Service in that June. In 1903 he was made a Knight of the Venerable Order of Saint John. He was promoted to colonel in 1907, and appointed Inspector of Medical Services. In 1910 he was appointed Deputy Director-General of Medical Services and granted the temporary rank of surgeon-general. The rank was made permanent in 1911. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath in the 1912 King&#x27;s Birthday Honours. On 1 June 1914 he was appointed Honorary Surgeon to the King, holding the post until 7 May 1919.

==First World War==
Babtie was appointed Director, Medical Services for the British Indian Army in March 1914. He was responsible for medical provision on both the Mesopotamian campaign and the Dardanelles Campaign. He was Mentioned in Despatches for his services in the Dardanelles. He was appointed Director of Medical Services at the War Office on 18 March 1916. He became Inspector of Medical Services with the temporary rank of lieutenant-general on 1 March 1918.

However, he was severely criticised by the Mesopotamia Commission of Inquiry and received further criticism for similar failings at Gallipoli.

Babtie was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in the 1919 King&#x27;s Birthday Honours.

<doc id="758063" wikidata="Q1547689" url="?curid=758063" title="Holland (album)">
<text>Holland is the 19th studio album by American rock band the Beach Boys, released January 8, 1973 on Brother/Reprise. It is their first album recorded without Bruce Johnston since 1965, their second with Blondie Chaplin and Ricky Fataar, and their final studio album created under the &quot;de facto&quot; leadership of Carl Wilson and manager Jack Rieley. The LP was originally packaged with a bonus EP, &quot;Mount Vernon and Fairway&quot;, which consisted of a 12-minute fairy tale written and produced by Brian and Carl Wilson.

Per its title, &quot;Holland&quot; was recorded over the summer of 1972 at a barn in Baambrugge, near Amsterdam, where the band members and their entourage had decamped for several months in the pursuit of creative inspiration. Recording the album was an unprecedented and extremely costly venture, as the group had commissioned their engineers to renovate the barn, which had housed an existing studio, using components from the band&#x27;s studio in Los Angeles that were dismantled, shipped to the Netherlands in crates, and then reassembled. Ultimately, only the album&#x27;s basic tracks were recorded in the Netherlands, with the band finishing off the record in late 1972 at Village Recorders in Los Angeles. Total expenses were estimated at $250,000 (equivalent to $ in ).

&quot;Holland&quot; received generally favorable reviews and came to be viewed by many fans as the Beach Boys&#x27; last great album. It peaked at number 36 in the US and number 20 in the UK, and it produced two singles: &quot;Sail On, Sailor&quot; and &quot;California Saga/California&quot;. Subsequently, the band recorded little in the studio for the next two years. Instead, they released the live album &quot;The Beach Boys in Concert&quot; (1973), and did not follow up with another studio album until &quot;15 Big Ones&quot; (1976). In 2022, an expanded version of &quot;Holland&quot; was packaged within the compilation &quot;Sail On Sailor – 1972&quot;.

==Background==

In late December 1970, the Beach Boys played three concert dates in Amsterdam as part of a short European tour. On the first date, which had been scheduled to begin at 12:30 a.m., the band arrived four hours late due to a missed flight, and were surprised to find that the concert hall venue, the Concertgebouw, was still packed with attendees. Furthermore, the audience shouted for the group to perform their new songs, rather than their past hits. Carl Wilson told a local magazine, &quot;I love this audience. Our last albums [&quot;20/20&quot; and &quot;Sunflower&quot;] sold poorly in the US, our financial situation is disastrous – and here we have success. I like this country.&quot;

Reports from this period suggested that the group were planning to move from Los Angeles to Britain once their recording commitments were finished. In one report, manager Jack Rieley said they were &quot;definitely leaving Los Angeles because of the smog.&quot; Later, Rieley told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;I wanted to [shift our base] and so did Carl. [Holland] seemed like an interesting place. But most importantly, I felt that The Beach Boys had to do a record outside of California, to get away from that whole scene, find a new scene, and create in that new scene.&quot;

During the recording of &quot;Carl and the Passions – &quot;So Tough&quot;&quot;, in late February 1972, the band returned to the Netherlands to film a promotional clip for their forthcoming single, &quot;Marcella&quot;, and play a televised concert at the RAI Congrescentrum. There, the group decided on the Netherlands as the venue for their next recording project, and where they would set up headquarters for the next several months. A few days later, the band announced drummer Ricky Fataar and guitarist Blondie Chaplin as new additions to their official line-up. Bruce Johnston, who had joined in 1965, resigned from the group in April 1972.

The band had expected to record their Netherlands-based album at a local studio, however, the country&#x27;s few studios were already overbooked. To get around this, the group commissioned their engineer, Steve Moffit, to design and construct a portable mixing desk – something which had never been done before – and have it shipped to their Netherlands base. This meant dismantling the band&#x27;s private studio located in Brian Wilson&#x27;s home. Later, at the end of May, Moffit discovered a barn in Baambrugge, within 10 miles of Amsterdam, that housed an existing recording studio, which he then converted for the band&#x27;s own purposes. The group also tasked their publicist, Bill DeSimone, with finding eleven houses for the Beach Boys&#x27; entourage, unaware that the Netherlands had suffered from a chronic housing shortage. After two weeks, he successfully secured four houses for the group. From May 5 to June 3, the group toured Europe and the UK while using their new homes and offices around Amsterdam as a base.

Members of the group and their entourage – which included several wives, girlfriends, and relatives; Rieley and his dog; engineers Moffitt, Gordon Rudd, and Jon Parks; assistant Russ Mackie, and secretary Carol Hess and her husband – took residence at various locations within a 30-mile radius of central Amsterdam. Carl and Chaplin lived in Hilversum; Fataar lived in Vreeland; and Mike Love and Al Jardine lived in Bloemendaal. Brian, who had long resisted making the trip, ultimately settled in Laren with his wife Marilyn, their two children Carnie and Wendy, Marilyn&#x27;s sister Diane Rovell, and a housekeeper. It took three attempts for Brian to successfully get on the flight from Los Angeles to Amsterdam.

==Production==

The sessions in Holland lasted from June 3 to August 15, 1972, at the BBC 2 Baambrugge studio near Amsterdam. Initially, the studio was in a non-functioning state, as there was not enough time to test the equipment shipped from Los Angeles before the group were due to record. According to biographer Steven Gaines, Moffit &quot;spent eighteen hours a day for the next four and a half weeks trying to get the equipment running. This ruined the touring schedule the Beach Boys expected to keep in Europe, severely limiting the needed income to cover the expense of living in Holland.&quot; Al Jardine remembered, &quot;It was rough being in Holland. We were working 24/7 in a small homemade rebuilt piecemeal little studio in a garage next to a cow pasture. Yeah, it was rough. We didn&#x27;t even have the correct electricity [...] so that kind of affected the sound of our equipment. It was a mixed blessing.&quot;

According to Fataar, &quot;Everybody would come in with a piece of a song or a completed song and kind of play around with it and then figure out how we wanted to record it. It was very casual.&quot; Carl produced every track on &quot;Holland&quot;, except for the songs by Dennis Wilson, which Dennis produced himself. In the middle of recording, Dennis moved to the Canary Islands, opting to return to the studio only for certain sessions. Biographer Jon Stebbins explains that Dennis had not felt &quot;comfortable living in Holland&quot;.

Brian did not join most of his bandmates&#x27; sessions, instead preferring to work alone on late nights. Fataar said, &quot;I can&#x27;t even remember seeing him in the studio in Holland. Everyone had their own family situation and we&#x27;d just go to work and occasionally see each other. It wasn&#x27;t like a one-big-family thing.&quot; Carl recalled, &quot;It was a very creative time for me. Brian had me working on the album very hard so he could have some time for himself. He wasn&#x27;t really up for doing much, as far as going into the studio every day.&quot; Biographer Peter Ames Carlin writes,

At the end of the Holland stay, in early August, the band attended a party hosted by the Dutch record company Bovema Negram, where Rieley announced to local journalists that the Beach Boys&#x27; next release would be a double album titled &quot;Holland&quot;. However, only the album&#x27;s basic tracks were recorded in Holland; the band subsequently returned to California for further recording. Rieley stayed behind, intending from this point onward to manage the group from his office in Amsterdam.

From late September through early October, the band refined the tracks at Village Recorders in Los Angeles, and a master was assembled on October 9. It was expected that the album would be released on November 5, but this motion was halted by Reprise/Warner Bros. executives who felt that the LP was a weak effort and lacked a hit single. The band were displeased; Gaines quoted one Warner Bros. executive as saying, &quot;It was bloodshed. Everybody went wild.&quot; To satisfy the record company, the group recorded one more song, &quot;Sail On, Sailor&quot;, after which the album was remastered and completed in late November. Production expenses for &quot;Holland&quot; totaled $250,000 (equivalent to $ in ). Rieley remarked of the exorbitant cost, &quot;Someday accounting will face a column just titled &#x27;Holland.&#x27;&quot;

==Songs==
===Side one===
&quot;Sail On, Sailor&quot; was written primarily by Van Dyke Parks and Brian Wilson with Rieley, Tandyn Almer, and Ray Kennedy. There are several contradicting accounts of the song&#x27;s origins. Carlin states that the song was essentially co-written by Wilson and Parks in 1971, with Kennedy and Almer&#x27;s contributions dating from impromptu sessions at Three Dog Night singer Danny Hutton&#x27;s house during the epoch. Brian refused to participate on the recording.

&quot;Steamboat&quot; was written by Dennis and Rieley, and sung by Carl. The lyrics reference Robert Fulton, the inventor of the steamboat. Carlin described the song as &quot;a dreamlike journey back to the mythic heart of Mark Twain&#x27;s America, borne by the insistent chug of an actual steam engine, hurtling keyboard glissandos, and a wonderfully bluesy slide guitar break&quot;. Musician Scott McCaughey wrote, &quot;the chugging, almost industrial rhythm bed sounds like a modern sampled tape loop or a latter-day Tom Waits creation.&quot;

&quot;California Saga&quot; is a three-part series of songs – &quot;Big Sur&quot;, &quot;The Beaks of Eagles&quot;, and &quot;California&quot; – that the members of the group produced when they had been feeling homesick. &quot;Big Sur&quot;, an acoustic number about rural life in Northern California, is the first song in which Mike Love wrote both the words and music. It was originally recorded during the &quot;Surf&#x27;s Up&quot; sessions; the version on &quot;Holland&quot; is a rerecording. &quot;The Beaks of Eagles&quot;, composed by Jardine, is partly based on Robinson Jeffers&#x27; poem of the same name. &quot;California&quot; has Brian, who was otherwise barely present at the group&#x27;s sessions, singing the opening line &quot;On my way to sunny Californ-i-a&quot;.

===Side two===
&quot;The Trader&quot; is a two-part composition by Carl, with lyrics by Rieley, who explained, &quot;Carl was speaking out about the fact that it&#x27;s wrong to subjugate a people, as so many have been. The Trader is really about racism; these people who got their orders from the king or queen and colonised Africa, for example. The tender part of the song asks the Africans to reply. I believe it&#x27;s quite touching. I wasn&#x27;t consciously trying to do something political.&quot; According to Carlin, the lyrics explore &quot;Manifest Destiny as seen through the eyes of the conquering and the conquered.&quot;

&quot;Leaving This Town&quot; was written primarily by Fataar, who said, &quot;I had parts of it and Carl came in the studio and suggested other things, so we were just making it up as we went along.&quot; &quot;Only with You&quot; was composed by Dennis, with words by Mike Love, and sung by Carl. &quot;Funky Pretty&quot; was produced by Carl and Brian, and features every member of the group trading the lead vocal.

===Leftover===
Among the outtakes, &quot;We Got Love&quot; is an anti-apartheid song by Blondie Chaplin, Fataar, and Love that was dropped from the album&#x27;s track listing to make way for &quot;Sail On, Sailor&quot;. A live recording of &quot;We Got Love&quot; was included on the album &quot;The Beach Boys In Concert&quot; (1973). &quot;Hard Time&quot; (not to be confused with another song with the title) was written by Chaplin and recorded on October 4. &quot;Pa, Let Her Go Out&quot;, written by Brian, was an alternate set of lyrics for the &quot;Better Get Back in Bed&quot; section of the fairy tale. In 2006, a user on a Beach Boys message board shared a recording of Brian singing &quot;Little Children (Daddy Dear)&quot; and &quot;Susie Cincinnati&quot; at a piano, recorded using a tape machine the user lent to Wilson while in Holland. All the songs listed were released on the 2022 archival box set &quot;Sail On Sailor – 1972&quot;. Only one song from the sessions, &quot;Lazy Lizzie&quot;, remains unreleased to this day.

&quot;Carry Me Home&quot; was written by Dennis, who shared the lead vocal with Chaplin. Stebbins refers to the song as &quot;the most expressive of emotional pain&quot; of any Beach Boys songs. Dennis explained to an interviewer, &quot;I wrote a song intended for &quot;Holland&quot; about Vietnam. I got the image of a soldier—me—dying in a ditch, and I ended up doing a song about it. The soldier began feeling, &#x27;Why the hell am I here?&#x27; Then the coldness started move up his body, from his feet to his legs, to his chest ... until he was dead. See? It was too negative! How could I put that on a Beach Boys album?&quot; The song would have been released on the 2013 box set &quot;Made in California&quot; had there not already been a large number of Dennis songs on the compilation. Brother Records archive manager Alan Boyd said, &quot;We also felt a little uncomfortable with the idea of at this point in time of Dennis singing (recites lyrics), &#x27;Please God don&#x27;t let me die&#x27;.&quot; The song eventually was released fifty years after being recorded, as a teaser single for the &quot;Sail On Sailor&quot; boxset, which it was also included in.
==Packaging and bonus disc==
The front cover depicts (upside down) a tugboat in the Kromme Waal, a canal in central Amsterdam. &quot;Holland&quot; was packaged with a 12-page booklet that provided a historical overview of the album&#x27;s making, plus a bonus EP, &quot;Mount Vernon and Fairway&quot;, that Brian and Carl had produced during the &quot;Holland&quot; sessions. The EP represented a compromise, as Brian had wanted &quot;Mount Vernon and Fairway&quot; featured on the album, a proposal that his bandmates had vetoed.

==Release==
Released on January 8, 1973, &quot;Holland&quot; peaked at number 36 in the U.S. and number 20 in the UK. Despite having a lower chart showing, the record outsold &quot;Carl and the Passions&quot;. Lead single &quot;Sail On, Sailor&quot; (backed with &quot;Only with You&quot;) was issued in February and reached number 79. In the UK, the lead single was &quot;California Saga/California&quot; (backed with &quot;Sail On, Sailor&quot;), reaching number 75. In March, the band remixed and overdubbed new vocals onto &quot;California Saga/California&quot; for a U.S. single release. Released in May, the single (backed with &quot;Funky Pretty&quot;) reached number 84.

From March 7 to May 17, the Beach Boys embarked on a ten-week U.S. tour with a supporting band that included guitarist Billy Hinsche, keyboardist Carlos Munoz, drummer Joe Pollard, bassist Ed Carter, and percussionist Richard &quot;Didymus&quot; Washington. Their set list included &quot;Funky Pretty&quot;, &quot;Leaving This Town&quot;, &quot;California Saga/California&quot;, and &quot;Sail On, Sailor&quot;. According to music historian Keith Badman, critics noted &quot;some unusually long pauses between each song and the group&#x27;s sometimes negative reaction to any audience requests for oldies.&quot; Brian Wilson, who last appeared with his bandmates in concert in 1970, briefly joined them onstage during their encore at the Hollywood Palladium on April 20.

Over the next two years, the group maintained a touring regimen, but recorded very little in the studio. On November 19, Warner/Reprise issued &quot;The Beach Boys in Concert&quot;, a live double album that became the band&#x27;s best-selling release on the label. It included live performances of &quot;Sail On, Sailor&quot;, &quot;The Trader&quot;, &quot;Leaving This Town&quot;, &quot;Funky Pretty&quot;, and the &quot;Holland&quot; outtake &quot;We Got Love&quot;.

==Critical reception==
===Contemporary===

&quot;Holland&quot; received generally favorable reviews at the time of release. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s Jim Miller, who was displeased with &quot;Carl and the Passions&quot;, praised &quot;Holland&quot; for its &quot;occasionally unnerving simplicity of viewpoint [and] its frequently ornate perfection.&quot; The magazine later ranked it among the five best albums of 1973. Robert Christgau of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; praised the sound quality of &quot;Holland&quot;, but believed that the album had strayed too far from what the Beach Boys did best, stating, &quot;I suppose that in time their tongue-tied travelogue of Big Sur may seem no more escapist than &#x27;Fun Fun Fun&#x27;, but who&#x27;ll ever believe it&#x27;s equally simple, direct, or innocent?&quot; In Britain, &quot;Melody Maker&quot;″s Richard Williams wrote, &quot;I expect more from the Beach Boys than from anyone else. &quot;Holland&quot; has the goods.&quot;

===Retrospective===
&quot;Holland&quot; became regarded by many fans as the Beach Boys&#x27; &quot;last, high-quality original album&quot;. Music journalist Peter Doggett opined, &quot;After the false start of &quot;Carl And The Passions&quot;, &quot;Holland&quot; proved that the Beach Boys could function as a creative rock band beyond the self-imposed limits of their 60s hits.&quot; &quot;Mojo&quot;″s Danny Ecleston referred to &quot;Holland&quot; as his favorite Beach Boys album, as well as their &quot;least-heard (and certainly last) great record.&quot;

The album has been included in some opinion polls and rankings.
* In 1999, it was ranked number 21 in &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s list of the &quot;Top 100 Albums That Don&#x27;t Appear in All the Other Top 100 Albums of All Time&quot;.
* In 2000, it was voted number 648 in the third edition of Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;.
* In 2007, it was ranked number 100 in &quot;OOR Magazine&quot;″s list of the &quot;100 Best Albums of All Time&quot;.

Less favorably, AllMusic reviewer John Bush rued that &quot;Holland&quot; was a &quot;surprisingly weak&quot; effort. Douglas Wolk of &quot;Blender&quot; thought that the band &quot;got way self-indulgent, recording poetry, flutes and Moog solos.&quot; Among biographers, Stebbins called the record &quot;a very respectable effort&quot;, though &quot;not of the caliber of &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; or &quot;Sunflower&quot;&quot;. John Tobler praised the &quot;California Saga&quot; trilogy and &quot;The Trader&quot;, but decreed, &quot;some of the [other] tracks were less than exceptional&quot;.

Brian&#x27;s 2016 memoir, &quot;I Am Brian Wilson&quot;, states of &quot;Holland&quot;: &quot;There are some great songs on that record. &#x27;Steamboat&#x27; kicks ass. I really like &#x27;Only with You&#x27; and &#x27;Funky Pretty&#x27;, too. It&#x27;s a damned good album no matter where or how we made it.&quot;

==Influence==
Elvis Costello ranked the album as one of his favorite records of all time. Tom Petty penned liner notes for the 2000 CD reissue, in which he described the album as &quot;beautiful&quot; and singled out &quot;The Trader&quot; as the album&#x27;s &quot;centerpiece&quot;. Primal Scream covered the &quot;Holland&quot; outtake &quot;Carry Me Home&quot;. Camper Van Beethoven stated that &quot;Holland&quot; was an enormous inspiration on their 2013 album &quot;La Costa Perdida&quot;.

<text>A killing jar or killing bottle is a device used by entomologists to kill captured insects quickly and with minimum damage. The jar typically contains gypsum plaster (plaster of paris) on the bottom to absorb a killing fluid. The killing fluid evaporates into the air and gasses the insect. Typically only adult hard bodied insects are killed in a killing jar; other insects require different methods of killing. 

== Jar set-up ==
The jar, typically glass, must be hermetically sealable. One design has a thin layer of hardened plaster of Paris on the bottom to absorb the killing agent. The killing agent will then slowly evaporate, allowing the jar to be used many times before it needs to be refreshed. The absorbent plaster of Paris layer also helps prevent the agent sticking to and damaging insects. Crumpled paper tissue is also placed in the jar for the same reason. A second method utilises a wad of cotton or other absorbent material placed in the bottom of the jar. Liquid killing agent is added until the absorbent material is nearly saturated. A piece of stiff paper or cardboard cut to fit the inside of the jar tightly is then pressed in.

== Killing fluids ==

The most common killing agents are ether, chloroform and ethyl acetate. Ethyl acetate has many advantages and is very widely used. Its fumes are less toxic to humans than those of the other agents, and specimens will remain limp if they are left in an ethyl acetate killing jar for several days and the ethyl acetate is not allowed to entirely evaporate from the specimens. It also preserves the body colors of some insects, such as dragonflies, that would otherwise lose their color, especially if there is a liquid layer to saturate their body tissues. A disadvantage is that, although the insects are quickly stunned by ethyl acetate, it kills them slowly and specimens may revive if removed from the killing jar too soon. Isopropyl alcohol is an easy to find and use killing agent for amateurs. Potassium cyanide or other cyanide compounds, including calcium cyanide, are also used, but only by experts due to its extreme toxicity. It also has the disadvantages that it makes the specimens brittle when left in the jar for several hours and that it may also cause some discoloration of colored specimens. It does kill rapidly, and the cyanide charge will last a long time. A few drops of acetic acid will increase the cyanide gas production. If the jar is not used for long periods it may dry out and produce little gas; a few drops of water will help get the process going again. The potassium cyanide slowly decomposes, releasing hydrogen cyanide. In former times, amateur entomologists commonly used the thick green leaves of the Cherry Laurel (&quot;Prunus laurocerasus&quot; or &quot;Prunus caroliniana&quot;) which, crushed or finely sliced, will similarly release hydrogen cyanide.

== Types of insects ==
Gassing in a killing jar is typically only used on adult hard-bodied insects. Soft-bodied and hard-bodied immature insects, such as the larval stage of many insects, are generally fixed in ethanol at 70–80% concentration in a vial. Dropping them in the vial containing ethanol both kills and preserves them. Higher concentrations of ethanol are not recommend for use with soft bodied insects, as it can distort and harden the body. Parasitic wasps are typically fixed in 95% alcohol to preserve the wing structure. Butterflies and moths are generally killed manually by crushing the thorax, as they can often destroy their wings by beating them against the jar.

<doc id="758079" wikidata="Q904080" url="?curid=758079" title="Pornography (album)">
<text>Pornography is the fourth studio album by English rock band the Cure, released on 4 May 1982 by Fiction Records. Preceded by the non-album single &quot;Charlotte Sometimes&quot;, it was the band&#x27;s first album with new producer Phil Thornalley, and was recorded at RAK Studios from January to April 1982. The sessions saw the band on the brink of collapse, with heavy drug use, band in-fighting, and frontman Robert Smith&#x27;s depression fueling the album&#x27;s musical and lyrical content. &quot;Pornography&quot; represents the conclusion of the Cure&#x27;s early dark, gloomy musical phase, which began with their second album &quot;Seventeen Seconds&quot; (1980).

Following its release, bassist Simon Gallup left the band, and the Cure switched to a much brighter and more radio-friendly new wave sound. Although it was poorly received by critics at the time of release, &quot;Pornography&quot; was the Cure&#x27;s most popular album to date, reaching number eight on the UK Albums Chart. It has since gone on to gain acclaim from critics, and is now considered an important milestone in the development of the style of music known as gothic rock.

== Background and recording ==
Following the band&#x27;s previous album, 1981&#x27;s &quot;Faith&quot;, the non-album single &quot;Charlotte Sometimes&quot; was released. The single, in particular its nightmarish and hallucinatory B-side &quot;Splintered in Her Head&quot;, would hint at what was to come in &quot;Pornography&quot;.

In the words of Robert Smith, regarding the album&#x27;s conception, &quot;I had two choices at the time, which were either completely giving in [committing suicide] or making a record of it and getting it out of me&quot;. He also claims he &quot;really thought that was it for the group. I had every intention of signing off. I wanted to make the ultimate &#x27;fuck off&#x27; record, and then sign off [the band]&quot;. Smith was mentally exhausted during that period of time: &quot;I was in a really depressed frame of mind between 1981 and 1982&quot;. The band &quot;had been touring for about 200 days a year and it all got a bit too much because there was never any time to do anything else&quot;.

The band, Smith in particular, wanted to make the album with a different producer than Mike Hedges, who had produced &quot;Seventeen Seconds&quot; and &quot;Faith&quot;. According to Lol Tolhurst, Smith and Tolhurst briefly met with the producer Conny Plank at Fiction&#x27;s offices in the hopes of having him produce the album since they were both fans of his work with Kraftwerk, however, the group soon settled on Phil Thornalley. &quot;Pornography&quot; is the last Cure album to feature Tolhurst as the band&#x27;s drummer (he then became the band&#x27;s keyboardist), and also marked the first time he played keyboards on a Cure release. The album was recorded at RAK Studios from January to April 1982.

On the album&#x27;s recording sessions, Smith noted &quot;there was a lot of drugs involved&quot;. The band took LSD and drank a lot of alcohol, and to save money, they slept in the office of their record label. The musicians usually turned up at eight, and left at midday looking &quot;fairly deranged&quot;. Smith related: &quot;We had an arrangement with the off-licence up the road, every night they would bring in supplies. We decided we weren&#x27;t going to throw anything out. We built this mountain of empties in the corner, a gigantic pile of debris in the corner. It just grew and grew&quot;. According to Tolhurst, &quot;we wanted to make the ultimate, intense album. I can&#x27;t remember exactly why, but we did&quot;. The recording sessions commenced and concluded in three weeks. Smith noted, &quot;At the time, I lost every friend I had, everyone, without exception, because I was incredibly obnoxious, appalling, self-centred&quot;. He also noted that with the album, he &quot;channelled all the self-destructive elements of my personality into doing something&quot;.

Polydor Records, the company in charge of Fiction, was initially displeased with the album&#x27;s title, which it saw as being potentially offensive.

== Music and influences ==
Regarding the album&#x27;s musical style, &quot;NME&quot; reviewer Dave Hill wrote, &quot;The drums, guitars, voice and production style are pressed scrupulously together in a murderous unity of surging, textured mood&quot;. Hill further described it as &quot;Phil Spector in Hell&quot;. &quot;Trouser Press&quot; said about the track &quot;A Short Term Effect&quot;: it &quot;stresses ephemeralness with Smith&#x27;s echo-laden voice decelerating at the end of each phrase&quot;. Ira Robbins observed that &quot;the song closest to basic pop&quot; is &quot;A Strange Day&quot;: It &quot;has overdubbed backing vocals plus a delineated verse and chorus wrapped in some strangely consonant guitar figures&quot;. The journalist also commented: the song &quot;Cold&quot; &quot;gets the full gothic treatment&quot;, with &quot;grandiose minor-mode organ swells&quot;. Describing the title track, writer Dave McCullough said that it &quot;tries to copy Cabaret Voltaire, all shuddering tape noise&quot;.

Smith said that &quot;the reference point&quot; for &quot;Pornography&quot; was the Psychedelic Furs&#x27; self-titled debut album, which he noted &quot;had, like, a density of sound, really powerful&quot;. Smith also cited Siouxsie and the Banshees as &quot;a massive influence on me [...] They were the group who led me towards doing &quot;Pornography&quot;. They drew something out of me&quot;. In 1982, Smith also said that the &quot;records he&#x27;d take into the bunker after the big bang&quot;, were &quot;Desertshore&quot; by Nico, &quot;Music for Films&quot; by Brian Eno, &quot;&quot; / &quot;Are You Experienced&quot; by Jimi Hendrix, &quot;Twenty Golden Greats&quot; by Frank Sinatra and &quot;the Early Piano Works&quot; by Erik Satie.

== Release and reception ==
&quot;Pornography&quot; was released on 4 May 1982. The album debuted and peaked at No. 8 on the UK Albums Chart, staying on the chart for nine weeks. Fiction owner Chris Parry found &quot;The Hanging Garden&quot; to be the album&#x27;s only potential single, and after being &quot;polished&quot; by Thornalley and Smith, it was released as a single on 12 July, reaching No. 32 on the UK Singles Chart.

Despite the commercial performance of the album, &quot;Pornography&quot; was not well received by most music critics upon its release. &quot;NME&quot; reviewer Dave Hill was ambivalent towards the album, writing that while he found the lyrics &quot;tiresomely self-analytical,&quot; the album &quot;portrays and parades its currency of exposed futility and utterly naked fear with so few distractions or adornments, and so little sense of shame. It really piles it on. The Cure have applied themselves to catching a related collection of the very purest feelings endemic to their age, and holding them right on the spot in their intangible, unspecified, unmanageable and most unpleasantly real form.&quot; Adam Sweeting of &quot;Melody Maker&quot; wrote: &quot;It&#x27;s downhill all the way, into ever-darkening shadows... passing through chilly marbled archways to the final rendezvous with the cold comfort of the slab&quot;. Dave McCullough of &quot;Sounds&quot; felt that despite a &quot;genuine talent still at work&quot;, &quot;Pornography&quot; &quot;has too much music too cluttered a backing for Smith&#x27;s well-intended observance [...] Robert Smith seems locked in himself, a spiralling nightmare that leaves The Cure making a pompous sounding music that is, when all&#x27;s said and done, dryly meaningless&quot;. Robert Christgau, writing in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, derided Smith&#x27;s &quot;glum&quot; lyrics: &quot;Cheer up; look on the bright side. You got your contract, right? And your synthesizers, bet you&#x27;ll have fun with them. Believe me, kid, it will pass.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; critic J. D. Considine commented that the lyrics seem &quot;stuck in the terminal malaise of adolescent existentialism&quot;, concluding, &quot;&quot;Pornography&quot; comes off as the aural equivalent of a bad toothache. It isn&#x27;t the pain that irks, it&#x27;s the persistent dullness&quot;. &quot;Trouser Press&quot;″ Charles McCardell, on the other hand, found that the Cure &quot;imposes an order that at first seems contrary to the basic preconceptions of rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll&quot; – noting that &quot;for them, lyrics are everything&quot; and that instruments had been relegated to &quot;merely creating atmosphere&quot; – and hailed &quot;Pornography&quot; as an &quot;uncompromising and challenging&quot; work.

== Legacy ==
Retrospective views of &quot;Pornography&quot; have been far more favourable. In his biography of the Cure, &quot;Never Enough: The Story of the Cure&quot;, Jeff Apter wrote that it &quot;turned out to be the kind of album—just like Lou Reed&#x27;s &quot;Berlin&quot; or Bowie&#x27;s coke-fueled &quot;Low&quot;—that required some distance and a good few years of music history to be really appreciated&quot;. In 1995, Mark Coleman of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; noted that &quot;Pornography&quot; had come to be &quot;revered by Cureheads as a masterstroke&quot;, while noting that &quot;normal listeners will probably find it impenetrable&quot;. Stewart Mason of AllMusic found it to be &quot;much better than most mainstream critics of the time thought&quot;, but at the same time &quot;not the masterpiece some fans have claimed it to be&quot; and &quot;just a bit too uneven to be considered a classic&quot;. In 2004, Jaime Gill of BBC Music singled out the album&#x27;s &quot;sonic depth and sheer relentless conviction&quot; for praise, adding that without these qualities, its &quot;extraordinary misanthropy would be laughable&quot;. &quot;Uncut&quot; called &quot;Pornography&quot; &quot;a masterpiece of claustrophobic self-loathing.&quot;

In 2000, &quot;Pornography&quot; was voted No. 183 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;. In 2005, &quot;Spin&quot; cited the album as a &quot;high-water mark for goth&#x27;s musical evolution&quot;. &quot;NME&quot; described &quot;Pornography&quot; as &quot;arguably the album that invented goth&quot;. &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; listed the album at No. 79 on its list of the best albums of the 1980s. In 2011, &quot;NME&quot; listed &quot;Pornography&quot; at No. 6 on its &quot;50 Darkest Albums Ever&quot; list. &quot;Mojo&quot; placed it at No. 83 on its list of &quot;100 Records That Changed the World&quot;. In his review for AllMusic, Stewart Mason also described the record as &quot;one of the key goth rock albums of the &#x27;80s&quot;.

According to Apter, &quot;Pornography&quot; would prove to be &quot;enormously influential&quot;, and has been cited as an influence by bands such as Deftones and System of a Down.

In 2017, Damnation A.D. released a cover version of the entire album. Xiu Xiu and Chelsea Wolfe covered &quot;One Hundred Years&quot; on Xiu Xiu&#x27;s 2021 album &quot;Oh No&quot;. Another cover version of the entire album was released by Leaether Strip in 2024.

== Live performances ==
In the period preceding and following the release of &quot;Pornography&quot;, the group started to develop their trademark image of big hair, smudged makeup and black clothes. Smith applied lipstick smeared around the eyes and the mouth. Under the lights, the lipstick melted, making it look, as Smith later put it &quot;like we&#x27;d been smacked in the face&quot;. It was supposed to symbolise the violence of the new material but backstage, another kind of violence had begun to surface from the first dates of the tour.

The group performed in the UK in April 1982. &quot;NME&quot; considered that the show &quot;was all very skillfully deployed: a bruisingly clear sound of scathing force, a clockwork, Pavlovian lightshow, a variegation of light and shade in the song order that builds to the unmitigating force of &#x27;Pornography&#x27; itself as the climax&quot;. However, the mood on stage was not good: The journalist noted that Smith looked &quot;dejected and tired&quot; for his birthday. Behind the scenes, Smith&#x27;s relationship with Gallup was deteriorating. When the tour reached Europe, tensions were so high between the two musicians that they had a fight after a concert in Strasbourg. Tolhurst found out the next day that his two partners &quot;had both gone back to England&quot;. At home, Smith heard his father telling him: &quot;Get right back out on that tour! People have bought tickets!&quot; After two more weeks of touring, the group played their final show in Brussels. Tolhurst later related: &quot;I remember sitting in the dressing room thinking, &#x27;oh well, that&#x27;s the end of the band, then&#x27; [...] I went off to France for a bit. I guess I ran away. Escaping from the reality of The Cure&quot;. Back in England, Smith took a rest with a month&#x27;s camping holiday to the Lake District to &quot;clean up&quot;.

<doc id="758086" wikidata="Q1931742" url="?curid=758086" title="Japanese Whispers">
<text>Japanese Whispers is the second compilation album by British group The Cure. It was released in late 1983 by Fiction Records. The title is a pun on the children&#x27;s game Chinese whispers.

It includes the singles &quot;Let&#x27;s Go to Bed&quot;, &quot;The Walk&quot; and &quot;The Love Cats&quot;. The other tracks are the B-sides of these singles, although &quot;Mr. Pink Eyes&quot; (the second B-side for &quot;The Love Cats&quot;) was not included. The songs were recorded when the band was in a transitional phase after bassist Simon Gallup left following a tour to promote the previous album, &quot;Pornography&quot;. Beginning with these singles, Lol Tolhurst switched from drums to keyboards, a role he kept until his departure in 1989.

For the tracks from the &quot;Let&#x27;s Go to Bed&quot; and &quot;The Walk&quot; singles, the Cure were a duo consisting of Tolhurst and Robert Smith, with the addition of session drummer Steve Goulding (a member of Graham Parker and the Rumour) for the tracks from &quot;Let&#x27;s Go to Bed&quot;. For &quot;The Love Cats&quot; single, a full band was assembled with the addition of bassist/producer Phil Thornalley, who had worked with the band on &quot;Pornography&quot;, and drummer Andy Anderson, a lineup which would continue for the &quot;Concert&quot; live album.

In 1986, the singles&#x27; lead tracks were included on the &quot;Standing on a Beach&quot; compilation album, while all of the B-sides were included on the 2004 B-sides and rarities box set &quot;Join the Dots&quot;.

&quot;Japanese Whispers&quot; was the first Cure album to enter the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in the US, in early 1984.

<doc id="758087" wikidata="Q1934350" url="?curid=758087" title="The Top (album)">
<text>The Top is the fifth studio album by English rock band the Cure, released on 4 May 1984 by Fiction Records. The album entered the UK Albums Chart at number ten on 12 May. Shortly after its release, the Cure embarked on a major tour of the United Kingdom, culminating in a three-night residency at the Hammersmith Odeon in London.

==Background and recording==
After recording psychedelic album &quot;Blue Sunshine&quot; for the one-off project the Glove during summer 1983, Robert Smith finished off the year composing and working on two other studio albums at the same time: &quot;The Top&quot; for the Cure and &quot;Hyæna&quot; for Siouxsie and the Banshees. Smith was still the official guitarist of the Banshees while he wrote &quot;The Top&quot;.

For &quot;The Top&quot;, Smith teamed up with Cure co-founding member Lol Tolhurst, who had given up drums for keyboards, and new drummer Andy Anderson, who had previously performed on the UK top 10 single &quot;The Lovecats&quot;. Porl Thompson was credited for playing saxophone on &quot;Give Me It&quot;. All the songs are credited to Smith but three tracks were co-written with Tolhurst: &quot;The Caterpillar&quot;, &quot;Bird Mad Girl&quot; and &quot;Piggy in the Mirror&quot;.

==Music==
The album&#x27;s style is eclectic, with Smith using various instruments including violin and flute. &quot;Bird Mad Girl&quot; is in a Spanish style, while &quot;Wailing Wall&quot; contains Middle Eastern undertones. &quot;Sounds&quot; critic Jack Barron described the opening track &quot;Shake Dog Shake&quot; as &quot;urbane metal&quot;.

==Promotion, release and reception==
Prior to its release, the Cure had been promoting the forthcoming album, performing live twice on UK television. In late February, they had played two songs on BBC Two&#x27;s Oxford Road Show, &quot;Shake Dog Shake&quot; and &quot;Give Me It&quot; and in early April, they had appeared on Channel Four&#x27;s &quot;The Tube&quot; to perform three other tracks, &quot;Bananafishbones&quot;, &quot;Piggy in the Mirror&quot; and the title track of the record. &quot;The Top&quot; album was released on 4 May 1984 by record label Fiction. It was a commercial success in the UK, peaking at No. 10 on the UK Albums Chart. &quot;The Caterpillar&quot; was the sole single released from the album.

Upon its release, the reaction in the British press was mostly positive. Steve Sutherland of &quot;Melody Maker&quot; praised the album for its &quot;psychedelia that can&#x27;t be dated&quot;, while Andy Strike of &quot;Record Mirror&quot; called it &quot;a record of wicked originality and wit&quot;. In &quot;Smash Hits&quot;, Mark Ellen deemed &quot;The Top&quot; a &quot;weird and wonderful&quot; album with songs that &quot;seem both enticing and faintly dangerous&quot;. In contrast, Barron at &quot;Sounds&quot; noted that &quot;The Top&quot; is &quot;too often not the true bottom line in reflected experience to be indisposable&quot;, but nevertheless prophesied, &quot;In 20 years&#x27; time, when the next generation blush with excitement at the word &#x27;Psychedelic&#x27;, it&#x27;ll be regarded as a classic&quot;. On a more skeptical note, &quot;NME&quot; reviewer Danny Kelly considered it self-indulgent, qualifying it as &quot;an ambitious, difficult record&quot;.

In a retrospective review, &quot;Q&quot; writer Tom Doyle dismissed &quot;The Top&quot; as &quot;a transitional record of forgettable songs&quot;. Thomas Inskeep of &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot; wrote that &quot;The Top&quot; &quot;may well be the nadir of their catalog&quot;, concluding he would call it &quot;a transitional album and leave it at that, for what came subsequently was an honest-to-goodness marvel&quot;. Chris True of AllMusic noted that while it is &quot;an album obviously recorded under stress, drink, and drugs&quot;, Smith&#x27;s ability &quot;to fuse the paranoia and neuroses of former work with his newfound use of pop melody and outside influences&quot; makes the record &quot;a necessary step in the evolution of the band&quot;.

<doc id="758088" wikidata="Q1931734" url="?curid=758088" title="The Head on the Door">
<text>The Head on the Door is the sixth studio album by English rock band the Cure. It was released on 30 August 1985 by Fiction Records. Preceded by the single &quot;In Between Days&quot; which had reached No. 15 on the UK Singles Chart, &quot;The Head on the Door&quot; was described by &quot;Melody Maker&quot; as &quot;a collection of pop songs&quot;. With its variety of styles, it allowed the group to reach a wider audience in both Europe and North America. In the United Kingdom it became their most successful album to date, entering the albums chart at No. 7 on 7 September.

The album is the first to feature drummer Boris Williams. Bassist Simon Gallup, who had previously worked on three major Cure albums of the early 1980s, was called back before the recording. In 1985, the band became a quintet with instrumentalist Porl Thompson as their fifth official member. &quot;The Head on the Door&quot; is the first Cure album where all the songs were composed solely by singer and guitarist Robert Smith.

==History and music==
This album marks the return of Simon Gallup in the group; he had performed and composed with Robert Smith and Lol Tolhurst on the dark trilogy &quot;Seventeen Seconds&quot;, &quot;Faith&quot; and &quot;Pornography&quot;. Guitarist Porl Thompson, who had played guitar during the very early days of the band, and also played keyboards and saxophone during &quot;The Top&quot; tour, became an official member. Drummer Boris Williams, who had previously worked with Thompson Twins, finally joined the ensemble after playing with the band during the US leg of the 1984 tour.

During promotion for the record, Smith stated that &quot;The Head on the Door&quot; was inspired by the albums &quot;Kaleidoscope&quot; by Siouxsie and the Banshees and &quot;Dare&quot; by the Human League. He wanted the album to be eclectic with different styles and moods: &quot;It reminds me of the &quot;Kaleidoscope&quot; album, the idea of having lots of different sounding things, different colours&quot;. &quot;Kyoto Song&quot; contains an oriental hook, while &quot;The Blood&quot; is played in a flamenco style. The piano tune of &quot;Six Different Ways&quot; had been previously used by Smith during his tenure with Siouxsie and the Banshees, for the single &quot;Swimming Horses&quot;. The last song of the album, &quot;Sinking&quot;, was reminiscent of the band&#x27;s &quot;Faith&quot; era, while &quot;Close to Me&quot; (released as the album&#x27;s second and final single) was described as a &quot;disco thing&quot; by critics. The opening track and first single, &quot;In Between Days&quot;, was compared to New Order&#x27;s material. &quot;A Night Like This&quot; contains a saxophone solo by Ron Howe from Fools Dance. The title of the album comes from a line in the chorus of &quot;Close to Me&quot;.

When he was interviewed that year, Smith said that his five favourite albums were at that time &quot;Mirror Moves&quot; by the Psychedelic Furs, &quot;This Year&#x27;s Model&quot; by Elvis Costello, &quot;Low&quot; by David Bowie, &quot;Kaleidoscope&quot; by Siouxsie and the Banshees and &quot;Rattus Norvegicus&quot; by the Stranglers.

==Release, reception and legacy==
Released on 30 August 1985, &quot;The Head on the Door&quot; was the first big international success for the band, notably entering the top 75 in the US and reaching the top 20 in numerous other countries. The album is certified gold in the US, UK and France.

Upon its release, &quot;The Head on the Door&quot; was well received by the British press. In a very favourable review, &quot;Melody Maker&quot;″s Steve Sutherland hailed the &quot;liberty&quot; that Smith took to conceive a multifaceted record. Chris Roberts of &quot;Sounds&quot; said that it &quot;makes you wish more pop stars were hip enough to stay in bed all day&quot;. &quot;Record Mirror&quot; reviewer Andy Strickland wrote that &quot;The Head on the Door&quot; &quot;may lack the swirls of chorused guitar that many adore, but there&#x27;s a wider more mature musical approach&quot;. Mat Snow of &quot;NME&quot; found that the album &quot;is really quite pop&quot;, and that &quot;tunes abound&quot;. In December 1985 it was named the best album of the year by &quot;Melody Maker&quot;.

In 2000 it was voted number 833 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;.

In a retrospective review, AllMusic critic Tim Sendra noted that &quot;The Head on the Door&quot; marked a new musical direction for the Cure in that Smith had managed to make the band&#x27;s trademark &quot;gloom and doom&quot; style both &quot;danceable and popular&quot;; Sendra also found that the album&#x27;s &quot;inventive&quot; arrangements provide &quot;a musical depth previous efforts lacked&quot;. Writing for &quot;Q&quot;, Tom Doyle said that songs such as &quot;In Between Days&quot; and &quot;Close to Me&quot; showed Smith &quot;bridging the brooding of yore with their recent pop highs&quot;. Nitsuh Abebe of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; deemed it the band&#x27;s &quot;most focused pop album&quot; and &quot;a tight, terrific package&quot;. &quot;PopMatters&quot; included &quot;The Head on the Door&quot; on its list of 12 essential alternative rock albums from the 1980s, calling the record &quot;an outstanding example of Smith&#x27;s ability to use pop music as a means to express angst while applying just a hint of the polish&quot;.

A cover version of &quot;A Night Like This&quot; was released on the 1996 reissue of the Smashing Pumpkins&#x27; &quot;Bullet with Butterfly Wings&quot; single.

<text>Galore: The Singles 1987–1997 is the second singles compilation by The Cure and was released on 28 October 1997. It contains singles from the years 1987–1997. The song &quot;Wrong Number&quot; is the only new song on the album.

== Release ==
&quot;Galore&quot; was first released in the US on 28 October 1997 by record label Elektra. It was then released in the UK and Europe by Fiction on 3 November. It spans the singles from the second part of the Cure&#x27;s career, beginning with their seventh album &quot;Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me&quot; and ending with their tenth album &quot;Wild Mood Swings&quot;. The Cure introduced the album with two full-length shows in October 1997 at the American Legion Hall in Los Angeles and Irving Plaza in New York City.

Robert Smith has expressed dissatisfaction with the lack of promotion given by their record labels for the release, he gave insight on the conflict of interest that he had with the record labels in an interview a few years after the release of the compilation, &quot;There was hardly any promotion for this album. There were even people in my family who didn&#x27;t know about this release. The reason for this was a heavy quarrel I had with Polydor and Elektra. They wanted to have songs from &quot;Standing On A Beach&quot; included on this album plus a few songs from the last decade - a normal Greatest Hits compilation because that would appeal to more people. &quot;Boys Don&#x27;t Cry&quot; and stuff like that. I didn&#x27;t want it like this. To me it seemed like an offense to the fans if we included those old songs.&quot; &quot;They didn&#x27;t want to agree to this - they were like naughty little children. If you do it like you want, we won&#x27;t do any promotion. And I thought, fuck it, then there won&#x27;t be any promotion. So they pressed the lowest edition they could. Even if this first edition had sold out in Britain in the first week we hadn&#x27;t cracked the Top 40. There just weren&#x27;t enough records in stores. I was really pissed by that.&quot;

A single, &quot;Wrong Number&quot;, was released in United States on 17 November 1997.

== Reception ==
&quot;Galore&quot; was generally well received by critics. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic praised the album, writing &quot;&quot;Galore&quot; emphatically confirms the Cure&#x27;s status as one of the best and most adventurous alternative bands of the &#x27;80s.&quot; A review in &quot;Cherwell&quot; said &quot;Galore&quot; was &quot;easier, happier and more productive than anything else they&#x27;ve done&quot; and compared it positively to their first album.
Nathan Brackett and Christian Hoard from &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; wrote that &quot;&quot;Galore&quot; collects the best of the late Eighties/early Nineties Cure, plus a load of late filler&quot;, and were more reserved in their praise, describing the record as a &quot;feeble remix album.&quot;

<doc id="758094" wikidata="Q1931761" url="?curid=758094" title="Mixed Up (The Cure album)">
<text>Mixed Up is a remix album by English rock band the Cure, released on 20 November 1990 by Fiction Records. The songs are remixes of some of their hits, reflecting the popularity of remixing of existing songs and dance culture of the late 1980s and early 1990s. In 2018, a sequel was released titled &quot;Torn Down&quot;.

Most of the songs are extended mixes. Several had been previously released on 12&quot; singles, but some are completely remade, with Smith recutting vocals due to the original tapes not being available. The record closes with the extended version of a new single, &quot;Never Enough&quot;. The remix of &quot;Pictures of You&quot; was originally released under the title &quot;(Strange Mix)&quot;. In an interview featured on the &quot;Trilogy&quot; DVD, singer Robert Smith described the remix album as something &quot;fun after the doom and gloom of &quot;Disintegration&quot;&quot;.

The Cure also released some other new mixes as the B-sides of the singles from &quot;Mixed Up&quot;: the first single, &quot;Never Enough&quot;, featured a remix of &quot;Let&#x27;s Go to Bed&quot;, titled &quot;Let&#x27;s Go to Bed&quot; (Milk Mix) on the 12&quot;, cassette and CD versions, as well as a new song, &quot;Harold and Joe&quot;, while the second single, &quot;Close to Me&quot; (Remix) contained &quot;Just Like Heaven&quot; (Dizzy Mix) on all formats and &quot;Primary&quot; (Red Mix) on the 12&quot;, CD and cassette versions as B-sides; the third single, &quot;A Forest&quot; (Tree Mix), contained the original version of the song and &quot;In Between Days&quot; (Shiver Mix) only on 5-inch CD as B-sides.

===LP edition===


===CD edition===
Notes
* CD editions do not include &quot;Why Can&#x27;t I Be You?&quot; (Extended Remix), this was due to the 74-minute (later 80-minute) limit necessary to be compliant with the Compact Disc standard.
*As the original master tapes could not be found, &quot;A Forest&quot; and &quot;The Walk&quot; are not remixes, they are re-recordings.
*Over time, the CD edition has slightly changed. At the time of release, the words &quot;Mixed Up&quot; at the bottom of the cover were white in a box, but have since changed to black in a box. Also, the order of text on the CD disc has slightly been rearranged. Also, the track listing on the back cover, text in the liner notes and the text on the album cover (bar the small &quot;Mixed Up&quot; at the bottom) were originally a metallic. Now they are grey.

===2018 remastered reissue===
On 21 April 2018, &quot;Mixed Up&quot; was released as a remastered deluxe edition. The accompanying statement read: &quot;Robert Smith has remastered The Cure&#x27;s remix album from 1990. Now presented for the first time as double picture disc set in a gatefold sleeve with a download voucher.&quot;

A 3-disc deluxe edition of &quot;Mixed Up&quot; was released on 15 June 2018. The announcement read: &quot;The Mixed Up 3-CD set includes Mixed Up, a second disc of rare remixes from 1981 through 1990, and a third disc of brand new remixes by Robert Smith. All the material has been remastered in 2018, or, with respect to Torn Down, mixed in 2018.&quot;

In an interview with BBC Radio 6, Robert Smith confirmed that this release marks the continuation of The Cure&#x27;s deluxe edition re-release campaign, and that the deluxe edition of &quot;Wish&quot; had been completed and would follow.

<doc id="758096" wikidata="Q2103441" url="?curid=758096" title="Pomorzany, Szczecin">
<text>Pomorzany is a municipal neighbourhood of the city of Szczecin, Poland situated on the left bank of Oder river, south of the Szczecin Old Town. It borders Gumieńce to the west, Turzyn to the northwest, Nowe Miasto to the north, Międzyodrze-Wyspa Pucka to the east, and Gmina Kołbaskowo (Ustowo village) to the south. As of January 2011 it had a population of 21,957.

== History ==
The first traces of human activity in the area of today&#x27;s Pomorzany date from the late Neolithic period. The stabilization of the settlement in this area occurred in the 8th century. The village (under the name of &quot;Pomerenstorp&quot;) was first mentioned in 1253 in document of Barnim I, Duke of Pomerania. It was a suburb of Szczecin, which became the city&#x27;s possession after 1319. 

The northern part of Pomorzany (German: &quot;Pommerensdorfer Anlagen&quot;) was incorporated into the city in 1864, while the southern part in 1939, during the creation of Groß-Stettin (lit. &quot;Great City of Stettin&quot;), when neighbouring municipalities were amalgamated into Stettin.

During World War II, the Germans opened and operated seven forced labor camps in the district, for prisoners of various nationalities, including Poles, Yugoslavs and Russians. Many prisoners died in the camps. Allied air raids destroyed many residential buildings and factories. Following Germany&#x27;s defeat in the war, in 1945, the suburbs along with the city of Szczecin became again part of Poland.

The suburb was eventually incorporated into Szczecin on 5 July 1945.

In 2007, a monument to the victims of the local Nazi German forced labour camps from World War II was erected, unveiled by one of its survivors, Florian Nowacki.

<doc id="758099" wikidata="Q1931030" url="?curid=758099" title="Greatest Hits (The Cure album)">
<text>Greatest Hits is a greatest hits album by English rock band the Cure. It was first released in Japan on 7 November 2001, before being released in the UK and Europe on 12 November and then in the US the day after. The band&#x27;s relationship with longtime label Fiction Records came to a close, and the Cure were obliged to release one final album for the label. Lead singer Robert Smith agreed to release a greatest hits album under the condition that he could choose the tracks himself. The band also recorded a special studio album released as a bonus disc to some versions of the album. The disc, titled &quot;Acoustic Hits&quot;, consists of the eighteen songs from the North American release re-recorded using acoustic instruments.

==History==
&quot;Greatest Hits&quot; features select singles from the Cure&#x27;s then-25 year history, along with the two new tracks &quot;Cut Here&quot; and &quot;Just Say Yes&quot;. All songs were newly remastered by Tim Young at Metropolis Mastering specifically for the collection.

The UK and international editions of the album feature a similar track listing, with the exception of three songs that only appear on one or the other: the international release features &quot;The Walk&quot;, while the UK release excludes it in favour of &quot;The Caterpillar&quot; and &quot;Pictures of You&quot;.

In an effort to provide something new for the hardcore fans who owned the previously released songs, Smith arranged for the band and former member Boris Williams to re-record acoustic versions of the &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;. Only the select first pressings of &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; were bundled with the bonus disc of &quot;Acoustic Hits&quot;.

&quot;Greatest Hits&quot; was also released on VHS and DVD. The video track listing mirrors that of the North American audio CD, with the exception of &quot;The Caterpillar&quot;, &quot;Pictures of You&quot; and &quot;Close to Me (Closest Mix)&quot; which appear as hidden Easter eggs. Six of the acoustic performances also appear on the DVD.

The first vinyl version of this album was released on Record Store Day 2017 (22 April 2017) as two LP picture discs by the label Elektra Catalog Group. A quantity of 3250 were pressed. The release does not include the content of the &quot;Acoustic Hits&quot; disc, which was given its own standalone release on standard black vinyl.
On 5 July 2019, the album reached a new peak of number 19 in the UK Albums Chart following the Cure&#x27;s headline set at that year&#x27;s Glastonbury Festival.

<text>John Campbell Wells (17 November 1936 – 11 January 1998) was an English actor, writer and satirist.

==Early life==
The son of a cleric, Wells was born in Ashford, Kent, in 1936. He was educated at Eastbourne College and St Edmund Hall, Oxford.

==Career==
Wells started in cabaret at Oxford and began his television career as a writer on &quot;That Was The Week That Was&quot;, the 1960s weekly satire show that launched the careers of David Frost and Millicent Martin, among others, and also appeared in the television programme &quot;Not So Much a Programme, More a Way of Life&quot;, as well as in &quot;The Secret Policeman&#x27;s Other Ball&quot;. Besides making cameo appearances in films such as &quot;Casino Royale&quot; (1967) and &quot;Rentadick&quot; (1972), television dramas like &quot;Casanova&quot; (1987), an episode of &quot;Lovejoy&quot; (1991) and comedy shows like &quot;Yes Minister&quot;, he also wrote television scripts and screenplays, such as &quot;Princess Caraboo&quot; (1994).

In 1971, with John Fortune, he published the comedy &quot;A Melon for Ecstasy&quot;, about a man who consummates his love affair with a tree. Wells played the headmaster of Thursgood&#x27;s Preparatory School in &quot;Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy&quot; (1979).

Wells was one of the original contributors to the satirical magazine &quot;Private Eye&quot; and contributed to &quot;Mrs Wilson&#x27;s Diary&quot;, the long-running spoof journal of the wife of Prime Minister Harold Wilson. 

From 1979 he repeated that success with &quot;Dear Bill&quot;, a series of letters (co-written with Richard Ingrams) supposedly sent by Denis Thatcher, husband of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, to Bill Deedes. Wells developed the feature into a stage farce, &quot;Anyone for Denis?&quot;, first performed in 1981, in which he played Denis Thatcher. Co-starring Angela Thorne as Mrs. Thatcher, the play was a major West End hit, toured the UK and was adapted for television.He co-wrote Alice in Wonderland, a musical adaptation of Lewis Carroll’s novel with Carl Davis, which debuted at The Lyric Theatre in the West End, London. 

Wells also played Denis Thatcher in the Bond movie &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot; (1981). In 1991, he and Thorne again played the Thatchers in &quot;Dunrulin&quot;, a one-off TV sitcom-like satirical look at the couple in retirement. He also voiced Arnold the Elephant, Edward the Monkey and Bert in the children&#x27;s TV series &quot;Charlie Chalk&quot;.

In 1988, Leonard Bernstein started working on a new version of his much-revised operetta &quot;Candide&quot;. The author of the original book, Hugh Wheeler, had died, and John Wells was asked to help revise the text. The first production of this &quot;final version&quot;, by Scottish Opera, was followed by a &quot;final revised version&quot; in 1989, performances of which have been released on CD and DVD. An insert in the DVD (&quot;Bernstein and Voltaire&quot;), written by Wells, explained what Bernstein had wanted in this final revised version.

Wells authored &quot;Rude Words&quot; in 1991, a history of the London Library, for the institution&#x27;s 150th anniversary.

In 1997, Wells appeared in the BBC situation comedy &quot;Chalk&quot; as ineffectual headmaster Richard Nixon. His fellow cast members do not recall him being ill on set, but he was too unwell to participate in the second series.

Wells&#x27; last book, &quot;House of Lords&quot;, was a best-seller and published a year before his death in 1998. The book is a historical and humorous study of the British peerage system.

==Personal life==
In 1982, Wells married Teresa Chancellor (daughter of Sir Christopher and sister of Alexander). She had been married to Edward Gatacre, son of Sir William Forbes Gatacre. Their daughter, actress Dolly Wells, was the product of their affair; she was brought up believing Gatacre was her father and Wells was her stepfather.

Wells died of cancer in London in 1998 at the age of 61.

<text>Śródmieście is one of four districts of the city of Szczecin, Poland, situated in central part of the city. In 2022, it had the population of 104 294 people, and an area of 45.9 km² (17.7 square miles).

== History ==
The city had been originally divided into four districts in 1955. Said subdivisions were: Dąbie, Nad Odrą, Pogodno, and Śródmieście. The district of Śródmieście was located in the south-central portion of the city, roughly corresponding with its location to the modern district of Śródmieście, though with different boundaries. The four districts were abolished in 1976. The city was again divided into four districts in 1990, with one of the established subdivisions being Śródmieście.

==Subdivisions==
Śródmieście is divided into 10 municipal neighbourhoods.

<doc id="758111" wikidata="Q2843031" url="?curid=758111" title="American system of watch manufacturing">
<text>The American system of watch manufacturing is a set of manufacturing techniques and best-practices to be used in the manufacture of watches and timepieces. It is derived from the American system of manufacturing techniques (also called &quot;armory practices&quot;), a set of general techniques and guidelines for manufacturing that was developed in the 19th century. The system calls for using interchangeable parts, which is made possible by a strict system of organization, the extensive use of the machine shop, and quality control systems utilizing gauges to ensure precise and uniform dimensions. It was developed by Aaron Lufkin Dennison, a watch repairman who was inspired by the manufacturing techniques of the United States Armory at Springfield, Massachusetts, which manufactured identical parts, allowing rapid assembly of the final products. He proposed using similar techniques for the manufacture of watches. Before the American system of watch manufacturing was developed, watchmaking was primarily a European business. It involved making certain parts under the roof of a factory while obtaining other parts from piece workers who used their own cottages as workshops.

==Beginning of standardized production==
Henry Pitkin and his brother James were jewelry makers in Hartford, Connecticut in the mid-1830s before their business failed as a result of the panic of 1837 and they turned their attention to the manufacture of watches. The brothers were able to construct crude machinery for the production of watches, particularly for the manufacture of pallets. Their first complete movement was completed in 1838; a total of between 800 and 900 watches were completed through 1845. Surviving examples of Pitkin watches showed that the parts were, in fact, interchangeable.

==Waltham Watch Company==
In 1850 Aaron Dennison partnered with Edward Howard, a reputable clockmaker. The two formed plans to construct a line of watches with interchangeable parts based on Dennison’s visit to the Springfield armory. They built a factory in Roxbury, with financial backing provided by Samuel Curtis and DP Davis (a partner of Howard in his clock business). This company initially operated under the name American Horologe Company but was quickly changed to the Warren Manufacturing Company to hide its purpose from foreign suppliers. The company’s initial focus was on the production of an 8-day watch, though this proved to be too expensive and not very accurate. Instead, the attention was turned to a 30-hour watch designed very similarly to what ultimately became the standard for an American 18 size watch. The first such watch was completed in 1852; it carried the serial number of 18, and was marked &quot;Warren.&quot; Approximately 80 &quot;Warren&quot; watches were produced, followed by about 900 marked &quot;Samuel Curtis&quot;, and a further 4000 marked &quot;Dennison, Howard, and Davis&quot;. The factory was moved to Waltham, Massachusetts around 1857 and named the Waltham Watch Company. The basic design of this watch was used for several years as the 1857 model Waltham.

Applying armory practices to the manufacturing of watches carried both opportunity and risk for the Waltham Watch Company. The generally high price of watches allowed for a large investment in research and development, which was aimed toward the reduction of labor costs. At the time, labor costs were a major factor contributing to the high cost of watches; any system that significantly reduced labor costs would provide a substantial increase in profit. Substantial reduction in labor costs proved elusive, however. In 1910, after 40 years of manufacturing improvements, labor still accounted for 80% of the cost of watches, based on data from the Elgin National Watch Company.

Watches require very strict production tolerances and very few manufacturing defects, making labor cost reduction difficult. Other products made via armory practices, such as firearms and sewing machines, generally have much looser tolerances than are necessary for watchmaking, which involves numerous tiny gears that must fit together precisely. The intent of applying armory practices to watchmaking was to emphasize tight tolerances in the manufacturing of the component parts, so that final assembly could be done by lesser-skilled workers without the need for an expert watchmaker to personally oversee each step of manufacture.

In order to achieve strict tolerances, watch manufacturers largely manufactured their own machine tools and machine parts. Elgin, for example, manufactured almost two drill bits for each watch it manufactured. The knowledge of how to manufacture machines that could manufacture watches spread: from Waltham to Elgin and then to dozens of other American watch companies and manufacturers of other products. Techniques such as jigs, stops, and measuring devices on machines were not just refined, but other techniques were also developed.

Statistical methods of parts classification was one example used to reduce waste. If a gear staff (axle) and a jewel bearing hole were designed to be a given size, then the parts that most closely met those design goals were used in the highest grade watches. Accordingly, staffs that were too large would be matched to watch jewels with holes that were too large, and together they would be used on lower grade watches.

<text>( &#x27;mirror(s) in the mirror&#x27;) is a composition by Arvo Pärt written in 1978, just before his departure from Estonia. The piece is in the &quot;tintinnabular&quot; style, wherein a &quot;melodic voice&quot;, operating over diatonic scales, and &quot;tintinnabular voice&quot;, operating within a triad on the tonic, accompany each other. It is about ten minutes long.

==Description==
The piece was originally written for a single piano and violin – though the violin has often been replaced with either a cello or a viola. Versions also exist for saxophone, double bass, clarinet, horn, flugelhorn, flute, oboe, bassoon, trombone, and percussion. The piece is an example of minimal music.

The piece is in F major in 6/4 time, with the piano playing rising crotchet triads and the second instrument playing slow F major scales, alternately rising and falling, of increasing length, which all end on the note A (the mediant of F). The piano&#x27;s left hand also plays notes, synchronised with the violin (or other instrument).

&quot;Spiegel im Spiegel&quot; in German can literally mean both &quot;mirror in the mirror&quot; and &quot;mirrors in the mirror&quot;, referring to an infinity mirror, which produces an infinity of images reflected by parallel plane mirrors: the tonic triads are endlessly repeated with small variations as if reflected back and forth. The structure of the melody is made by a pair of phrases characterized by the alternation between ascending and descending movement with the fulcrum on the note A. This alternation, along with the overturning of the final intervals between adjacent phrases (for example, ascending sixth in the questiondescending sixth in the answer), contributes to give the impression of a figure reflecting on a mirror and walking back and toward it.

In 2011, the piece was the focus of a half-hour BBC Radio 4 programme, &quot;Soul Music&quot;, which examined pieces of music &quot;with a powerful emotional impact&quot;. Violinist Tasmin Little discussed her relationship to the piece.

==Adaptation==

&quot;Spiegel im Spiegel&quot; is featured on the 1999 album &quot;Alina&quot; on the ECM New Series label. The album, which was recorded with the participation of Pärt, includes three versions of &quot;Spiegel im Spiegel&quot;, two for violin and piano and one for cello and piano, alternated with two variations of Pärt&#x27;s piano piece &quot;Für Alina&quot;. The tempo of the first version of &quot;Spiegel im Spiegel&quot; is 69 bpm (larghetto or adagio) and has a more somber feel. The tempo of the second version is faster at 85 bpm (andante) and gives the sense of pushing forward.

<doc id="758130" wikidata="Q212860" url="?curid=758130" title="Man of Many Faces">
<text>is a manga by Clamp about a nine-year-old boy named Akira Ijyuin who steals beautiful and valuable objects to please his two mothers and is known to the public as the dashing, clever thief named the &quot;Man of 20 Faces&quot;. The manga took inspiration from the works of Edogawa Ranpo, most notably from The Fiend with Twenty Faces.

The storyline of &quot;Man of Many Faces&quot; occurs simultaneously with both &quot;Clamp School Detectives&quot; and &quot;&quot;, as demonstrated by a conversation between Nokoru and Suō which also takes place in &quot;Clamp School Detectives&quot;, while in &quot;&quot; Akira and Utako appear at their age as they do in &quot;Man of Many Faces&quot;.

The manga is published in English by Tokyopop (formerly) and Viz Media (currently), retaining its right to left format.

==Plot summary==

By day nine-year-old Akira Ijuyin is a normal student at Clamp School, but at night he becomes the mysterious thief 20 Masks. His thefts are usually subject to the whims of his two mothers, which Akira pulls off without any true objections or interactions. One night Akira ducks into the room of five-year-old Utako Ōkawa in an attempt to hide from the police.

Although the pair shares a four-year age difference, they find themselves quickly falling for each other even as Akira finds himself being increasingly more involved with thefts, some of which include Utako&#x27;s family. This as well as several other obstacles give the young couple&#x27;s budding relationship a fair amount of difficulty.

==Characters==

===Akira Ijyuin===

*Gender: Male
*Age: 9
*Birthday: December 24

He is an elementary-school boy with a double life. During the day, he is a fourth-grader of the elementary division of the CLAMP school campus, and also the Treasurer of the Elementary Division Student Council. At night, he becomes a mysterious thief who steals things in order to please his two mothers.

Although he is only 9 years old at the beginning of the story, he has already mastered the great skills in disguise and thievery. Our protagonist is the successor of the renowned thief 20 Faces, who was also Akira&#x27;s father. After his father disappears, Akira takes his place and inherits the name 20 Faces.

Akira is so pure that he still believes in Santa Claus – this fact really surprises Nokoru and Suō. Akira is also very good at cooking and housework. His cooking is said to be equivalent to the top cooks of the world, while his grace in housework makes him the most wanted bachelor.

He is also said to be the top student in his grade. However good he is, Akira is still an innocent boy in love. Akira proposes to Utako when he is 20 and marries her at the age of 22. He is trying to become a pediatrician like his uncle, who happens to be the doctor at CLAMP school&#x27;s infirmary.

The only time Akira gets angry is the time his mothers try doing something risky in order to help him.

In the two last chapters, and the cover of volume 2, Utako and Akira are shown in their adult form.

===Utako Okawa===

*Gender: Female
*Age: 5

The second daughter of the Zaibatsu Okawa. When she meets Akira at the beginning of the story, she is heartbroken by her kindergarten teacher who refuses her love confession because of their 22 years difference in age. However, she quickly finds herself attracted to the mysterious thief who just breaks into her room to hide from the police. Akira&#x27;s kindness helps ease Utako&#x27;s anger. And that&#x27;s when Utako decides that Akira will be the man of her life.

Utako is not good at cooking and housework – she even mistakes salt for sugar, for example. However, she has been trying her best ever since she met 20 Faces, because she wants to be the best wife in the world.

Utako seems to be more mature than those at her age, even more mature than those that are older than she is. She gets engaged to Akira at her 16th birthday and claims that his proposal is the best birthday present she ever had. She marries Akira at the age of 18.

Her future career is a kindergarten teacher.

In the next-to-last chapter is the only time in any CLAMP manga or anime that Nagisa Azuya – a friend of Utako, and girlfriend of &quot;Clamp School Detectives&quot;&#x27;s Suoh Takamura – is shown in her adult, as opposed to her child form.

===Akira&#x27;s Mothers===
*Gender: Female

They are referred to, when it is necessary to differentiate, as &quot;Mother A&quot; and &quot;Mother B&quot;. They seem to be identical twins. They are said to be extremely wealthy and very beautiful, however, their personalities are childlike. The reason on why Akira has two mothers is still a mystery that Clamp has not yet revealed.

Although seemingly very rich, they have always coerced their husband – the original 20 Faces – and, later, their son Akira – to steal anything they like by claiming that they desperately need it.

Although they seem selfish, they really care about Akira. Once they even attempt to help by arriving at the scene in disguise (as bunny girls); however, they only mess everything up and this results in angering Akira, though their sincere apology makes him unable to remain angry for very long.

They also seem to be playful, and make Akira clean up most of their mess. They also seem to be extremely unskilled, or at least extremely unwilling to do housework, which makes Akira the only one to do all the cooking and cleaning.

===Ryūsuke Kobayashi===

*Gender: Male
*Age: 16

A high school student in Clamp School&#x27;s year 1, Z division. His dream is to be a police detective and to capture 20 Faces. As such, he&#x27;s always at the center of every heist 20 Faces, commanding police officers despite the fact that he is in high school. He is unaware that Akira is in fact 20 Faces, though he gets along with the boy very well otherwise.

In his later years, Ryūsuke succeeds in becoming a detective though his personality did not change much since high school.

===Shigetaka Akechi===

*Gender: Male
*Age: 25

Akira&#x27;s uncle. He works at Clamp School&#x27;s infirmary as a pediatrician. A kind-hearted individual, he seems to be fully aware that Akira is in fact 20 Faces. He will often show up at the crime scenes to give out half-hearted advice to Ryūsuke and the police, but for the most part cheers Akira on.

==Crossovers==
*This is one of Clamp&#x27;s earliest original works and is a predecessor to &quot;Clamp School Detectives&quot;, in which Akira is also one of the three main characters.
*He also makes cameo appearances in &quot;&quot;, &quot;X&quot; and the video &quot;Clamp in Wonderland&quot;.
*Akira also appears as Man of Many Faces in episode 11 and 12 of the &quot;Clamp School Detectives&quot; anime.

==Media==
There were two drama CDs released.


The cast consisted of:

*Akira - Kappei Yamaguchi
*Utako - Chieko Honda
*Ryūsuke - Takeshi Kusao
*Shigetaka - Kōichi Yamadera

&quot;Note:&quot; Akira&#x27;s mothers do not appear in the drama CD.

<doc id="758134" wikidata="Q2907476" url="?curid=758134" title="Bo' Selecta!">
<text>Bo&#x27; Selecta! is a British television sketch show written and performed by Leigh Francis. It was broadcast on Channel 4 from 2002 until 2009 and lampooned popular culture, becoming known for its often surreal, abstract toilet humour. Series 4 was known as A Bear&#x27;s Tail while Series 5 shifted filming to the United States and was called Bo! In the USA. The show consists of comedy sketches of characters played by Francis wearing exaggerated latex masks of various celebrities, with minor support roles over the years played by Craig Phillips, Caroline Flack, Ozzy Rezat, Patsy Kensit, Karen Hayley, Barunka O&#x27;Shaughnessy, Dexter Fletcher, Sean Pertwee, Luis Fernandez-Gil and Robert Stone.

In June 2020, after an agreement between Channel 4 and Francis, the show was taken down from All 4 following backlash over its frequent use of blackface.

==Background==
&quot;Bo&#x27; Selecta!&quot; was broadcast on Channel 4 and ran for three series between 2002 and 2004, spawning several spin-offs. Francis played central character Avid Merrion, a dangerously insane stalker, who is obsessed with celebrities and tracks them down. The show consists of sketches featuring caricatures of British and American celebrities, portrayed by Francis wearing latex facemasks with exaggerated facial features. The most popular sketches involve entertainers such as Elton John, who is portrayed as being angry, aggressive and antisocial (in one episode he says he shops on the internet due to his hatred for society), David Blaine, Kelly Osbourne, who comes off as calm and laid back at first and then begins ranting uncontrollably at the camera, Michael Jackson, a foul mouthed mental patient who has tics in the form of &quot;hee-hees&quot;; Mel B, who has a strong Northern accent; and central character Craig David, an egotistical Yorkshireman who owns a plastic peregrine falcon named Kes, a reference to the 1969 drama film of the same name. Avid Merrion would appear in his own sketches placed throughout each episode. Another recurring character on the show played by Francis is &quot;the Bear&quot;, a perverted teddy bear who interviews genuine celebrity guests, where he will make them read a bedtime story to him. Each story starts off the same way and ends with the celebrity (usually female) saying or doing something sexually suggestive, causing the Bear to have an erection (at which point he would shout &quot;Christine Hamilton! Christine Hamilton!&quot;).

The series title is based on the title of the Artful Dodger and Craig David song &quot;Re-Rewind (The Crowd Say Bo Selecta)&quot;. David is one of the main characters and speaks in catchphrases such as &quot;proper bo I tell thee&quot; and &quot;can I get a reeewind&quot;. Much of the show&#x27;s humour is derived from the deliberate ineptitude of each impersonation and general incongruity; scenes include Avid slapping Justin Timberlake with slices of cold meat, and trying to seduce Patsy Kensit while in character as Mel B.

Despite a loyal following and some strong reviews, the show has been criticised for allegedly promoting narrow-mindedness and puerile behaviour. Nevertheless, it was ranked 19th in &quot;Channel 4&#x27;s 30 Greatest Comedy Shows&quot; as part of its 30th anniversary. The show was re-broadcast by 4Music. Christmas singles were released under the &quot;Bo&#x27; Selecta!&quot; banner, entitled &quot;Proper Crimbo&quot; and the double A-side &quot;I Got You Babe / Soda Pop&quot;. &quot;Proper Crimbo&quot; was released at Christmas 2003, peaking at No. 3 on the UK Singles Chart. &quot;I Got You Babe / Soda Pop&quot; was released at Christmas 2004, peaking at No. 4 on the UK Singles Chart.

==Characters==
===Avid Merrion===
First appearing on &quot;Whatever I Want&quot;, Avid Merrion, played by Leigh Francis, is the main protagonist of the series. He is obsessed with celebrities and stalks them, after he grew up to become the number one celebrity super fan in the world. Originating from the small town of Arachnipuss near Transylvania, Avid was born to a father who was a Dracula-impersonating stripper. Avid lives in a flat in London, with his dead mother, whom he keeps in the cupboard, and Craig Phillips, winner of the first series of &quot;Big Brother UK&quot;, whom he keeps chained up in the toilet. With his slurred and broken English, a ginger mullet, eccentricity, bisexuality, peculiar sexual fetishes, poor social skills and obsession with showbiz figures, he became known as one of the scariest celebrity stalkers. He wears a neck brace which he says is due to an encounter with Liza Tarbuck. He spends most of his time harassing celebrities at functions such as book signings or film premières, highlights of which are shown throughout the first two series. Due to his nature, he became noticed by the media during the third series of &quot;Big Brother&quot;, after he repeatedly attempted to break into the house to get closer to the house mates. By the third series of this show, his newly elevated status in pop culture allowed him to talk one-on-one with celebrities, rather than stalking them. His segments in the series were transformed into his own chat show. In &quot;Bo! in the USA&quot;, Avid has given up his job as a chat show host, and now owns a hotel in Los Angeles, where many celebrities come to stay.

===Craig David===
Craig David is one of the main &quot;Bo&#x27; Selecta&quot; characters. His catchphrases are &quot;Proper Reet Bo&quot; and &quot;Proper Bo, I tell thee!&quot;. He is portrayed as having a very large chin, with a beard made with a pen. Craig has a very strong Yorkshire accent. He is known for always singing his name. He carries around a plastic peregrine falcon on his wrist named &quot;Kes&quot;, possibly as a reference to the film of the same name. Kes was apparently bought off a man in Huddersfield who had a dog with one leg. He calls Kes a &quot;bastard&quot;, often when calling her to return. Craig also wears a beanie hat, and his iconic headphones from his &quot;Born to Do It&quot; album cover. In the first series, a segment entitled &quot;Craig David&#x27;s Life Story&quot; is featured, showing events such as David visiting the doctor to be fitted with a urostomy bag (which he often fails to wear at night and wets the bed), and attempting to break the American market but catches a flight to Mallorca by accident. For the second series, each episode segment follows him on his nationwide UK tour alongside his band (who hate him), in which he meets Michael Jackson, goes dating, goes for a walk, meets the real Craig David (depicted as an impersonator), and performs in front of a live audience. In the third series, he attempts to break America again with his new single &quot;Soda Pop&quot;, which fails to chart. Along the way, he makes a music video and gets himself a makeover from Mel B. He appeared in &quot;Bo! in the USA&quot;, in a weekly segment in which he tries to seduce Holly Valance and earn himself a bronze swimming award. As time went on, Craig&#x27;s fall from fame was chronicled as he started making appearances on shopping channels and in &quot;Cha&#x27;mone Mo&#x27;Fo&#x27; Selecta&quot; he was reduced to working in a call centre. Leigh Francis stated in an interview with &quot;Metro&quot; that the character was based on Billy Casper from &quot;Kes&quot;, rather than the singer Craig David.

===Mel B===
Mel B is portrayed as a drunk, scary, and dirty old woman. She has white skin, red hair, and a massive nose. She speaks in a northern accent, which is apparent when she says the word &quot;fuck&quot; like &quot;fook&quot;, and wears a leopard-print top, revealing a disturbingly hairy chest. Her best known catchphrase is &quot;yer bastard ya!&quot;, whilst often making remarks regarding lesbian sex and her minge, which she describes as smelling like crab paste. In the first series, she features in a segment in which she promotes her new book, which discusses the split of the Spice Girls and her love for her stuffed tiger. In the second series, she becomes a non-weekly character, only appearing three times during the series, appearing in segments when she goes on holiday, shows us her &quot;Crib&quot; and talks about Girls Aloud. In the third series, she becomes a regular character again, and appears in a segment entitled &quot;The Odd Couple&quot;. The segment shows her living with singer and actress Patsy Kensit, whom she is always trying to seduce and with whom she eventually has a drunken one night stand in the final episode. On the music video for Avid Merrion&#x27;s cover for I Got You Babe (which also starred Patsy Kensit), Mel&#x27;s father was revealed to be Jim Bowen. She also appears in &quot;Bo! in the USA&quot;, however, as a non-regular character. The real Mel B appeared a few times during the series.

===Michael Jackson===
Michael Jackson is portrayed as a vulgar mentally ill patient, usually beginning his segment by shouting &quot;Cha&#x27;mone mother fucker!&quot;, which is a reference to the word &quot;shamone&quot; that Jackson often used in his music, pronouncing most words with an &quot;ay&quot; at the end, and always wearing the trademark rhinestone glove. In series one, his segment was titled &quot;The Jacksons&quot;, which featured Michael showing the viewer around his family home, and having an ongoing feud with The Osbournes. In series two, a segment entitled &quot;Michael Jackass&quot; was premièred, which showed Jackson doing dangerous tasks such as wakeboarding drunk, diving in an aquarium tank covered in fish, ice skating naked, diving into a pool with his arms and legs tied up, and skydiving. In the third series, Jackson&#x27;s segment was entitled &quot;Doin&#x27; Porridge&quot;, a parody of the TV series &quot;Porridge&quot;. The segment followed his nine weeks of being in jail (the real Michael Jackson was due to face trial at the time) with his comedy hero Ronnay Barkay. He also appeared in &quot;Bo! in the USA&quot;, appearing in a renewed version of &quot;Michael Jackass&quot;. The character featured in his own special, &quot;Chamone Mo Fo Selecta&quot;, following his real-life death in 2009.

===David Blaine===
David Blaine is portrayed as a sex-obsessed street magician doubling as a pickup artist. Throughout the first two series, Blaine was featured in a self-titled segment, which saw himself perform tricks against unsuspecting female members of the public. However, during the trick, he is seen groping them for &quot;close contact&quot;. In series two, each trick would involve one piece of the woman&#x27;s underwear being removed from their body and worn by Blaine. After the trick, he tells the person that if they want their underwear back, they would have to &quot;get a room&quot; with him. In one of his magic tricks (referencing his &quot;Frozen in Time&quot; stunt), he masturbates in front of the audience while being encased in ice. He didn&#x27;t appear in series three or in &quot;Bo! in the USA&quot;.

===The Osbournes===
Many of the Osbourne family are parodied on &quot;Bo&#x27; Selecta&quot;. They have also appeared on the show as themselves, usually while being stalked by Avid. Ozzy is shown to have very long arms, which are constantly moving in front of his body. He is shown to be always mumbling, which makes it impossible to understand what he is saying, apart from the swear bleeps during his sentence. He sometimes shouts &quot;Sharon!&quot; while he is speaking. Sharon is shown to speak in a high-pitched calm voice, quite opposite to what she is like in real life. She is either always sweeping the floor with a brush, or searching for food, a reference to her real life bulimia, though is obsessed with her dogs and often is portrayed as eating their bowel movements. Kelly is the most core character of The Osbournes. She is portrayed as having something of a split personality, moving suddenly from being upbeat and friendly (despite using the word &quot;douchebag&quot; constantly) to loudly swearing and being extremely hostile and violent. This switch in her personality is marked by a shift in accent from a stereotypical &quot;Valley girl&quot; speech pattern to a hard-edged Cockney accent (a parody of Osbourne&#x27;s real-life Mid-Atlantic accent). Throughout series one, she regularly appeared in &quot;The Week In Bits&quot; segment, often meeting other celebrities or talking about her private life. In series two, she has her own segment, entitled &quot;The Kelly Osbourne Show&quot;, in which she goes shopping, gets a haircut, slags off other celebrities, or does an advice call-in. Jack was not featured in the first series, though briefly appeared in series two during The Kelly Osbourne Show and once during Craig David&#x27;s tour, though he was portrayed as a slow moronic child like adult. In series three, his face and hair is drastically increased and he gains a Yorkshire accent in his own show &quot;Jack Off&quot; in which he interviews several people. His catchphrase was &quot;Brown Bread!&quot;.

===The Bear===
The Bear, played by Leigh Francis with a puppet body, is also one of the main protagonists of the series. During series one, the bear&#x27;s segment, entitled &quot;Showbiz Chat&quot;, featured a regular celebrity guest chatting to The Bear, in a location which is only described as &quot;up a tree, on Hampstead Heath&quot;. In series two, the segment was upgraded, and entitled &quot;Bedtime with the Bear&quot;. The segment featured a similar format, with the exception of the ending, in which the guest would read the Bear a bedtime story, which would feature themselves and other celebrities becoming involved in vulgar activities. The stories would always give the Bear an erection, which he would describe as his tail popping out. He has an extreme hatred of Stephen, a ginger squirrel, who he often calls &quot;a nob jockey&quot;. In series three, &quot;A Bear&#x27;s Showbiz Tail&quot; saw The Bear go on location to interview celebrities. When Avid fails to turn up for the last episode of series three, The Bear is given hosting duties, which resulted in his own Christmas special, &quot;A Bear&#x27;s Christmas Tail&quot;, and the entire fourth series being based around his adventures. In &quot;Bo&#x27; in the USA&quot;, he once again had his own segment in which he interviews celebrities. The sketches featured The Bear alongside Verne Troyer, who was shown to be The Bear&#x27;s agent since his move to America. The Bear later appeared in the 2018 ITV2 series &quot;Keith Lemon - Coming in America&quot; and in the video for Keith Lemon&#x27;s all star charity version of &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas&quot; in 2020, with pop stars like Rick Astley, Emma Bunton, Pixie Lott and Matt Goss.

===Ozzey===
Ozzey is a recurring character played by Ozzy Rezat. Ozzey was Avid Merrion&#x27;s landlord. He used to make T-shirts for Avid downstairs, but after Avid got a talk show Ozzey was made part of the wardrobe department. Ozzey was a refugee who escaped to England for an unknown reason. In the first episode of series three he accidentally said it out loud and was told off by Avid. He was also made gay in series three, leading to a sketch where Avid would say television has changed into a &#x27;blank&#x27;, which would immediately cut to an impersonation of &quot;Blankety Blank&quot;. All the contestants would be gay celebrities, such as Elton John, Boy George and George Michael. After &quot;Bo&#x27; Selecta!&quot; ended and The Bear got his own show, &quot;A Bear&#x27;s Tail&quot;, Ozzey had moved in with Sue Dales and Dave Ian McCall. When Bo&#x27; Selecta! returned as a new form, &quot;Bo! in the USA&quot;, Ozzey was not shown.

==Episodes==

Nearly all of the episodes of the series have been released on DVD. The six main episodes from series one were released under the banner &quot;Bo&#x27; Selecta!: Vol 1&quot;. The eight main episodes from series two were released under the banner &quot;Bo&#x27; Selecta!: Vol 2&quot;. The nine main episodes of series three were released under the banner &quot;Bo&#x27; Selecta!: Vol 3&quot;. All seven episodes from series four were released under the banner of &quot;A Bear&#x27;s Tail&quot;. All seven episodes from series five were released under the banner of &quot;Bo! in the USA&quot;. The two Christmas specials from series two were issued under the banner of &quot;Ho! Ho! Selecta!&quot;, &quot;Cha&#x27;mone Mo Fo Selecta&quot; was issued under the same title as a separate volume, and &quot;Avid Merrion&#x27;s Christmas Premiere&quot; was issued on the DVD wingle of his 2004 Christmas single, &quot;I Got You Babe / Soda Pop&quot;. This leaves only the pilot episode, both parts of &quot;Proper Bo&#x27; Selecta!&quot; and &quot;The Bear&#x27;s Chrimbo Top 20&quot; unreleased.

==Future==
On 24 September 2009, in an interview with the BBC, Leigh Francis said that &quot;Bo&#x27; Selecta!&quot; might return, claiming he became &quot;excited&quot; whilst making the Michael Jackson tribute episode. Francis admitted on Twitter that plans for the series were on hold, as he was working on a script for a possible movie for another project; however, he has since written on numerous occasions, when asked by other Twitter users about the show, that &quot;Bo&#x27; Selecta!&quot; would not be returning.

In 2019, Mel B and Francis in-character as the &quot;Bo&#x27; Selecta!&quot; version of Mel B did a 90 minute special called &#x27;What a Fookin&#x27; Year&#x27;.

In March 2024, an attempted revival was scrapped.

==Controversies==
Speaking to &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; in 2007, Craig David confessed that &quot;Inside it was absolutely pissing me off and hurtful beyond belief. There were times when I thought, ‘I just want to knock this guy out.’&quot; Although David made an appearance himself in the programme, he regretted it even as he was making it: &quot;I didn’t want people to think, &#x27;Craig’s reacting to it,’ because then they would think, &#x27;How can we get up Craig&#x27;s nose even more?’ So, I did it, but I wasn&#x27;t happy about it.&quot; However, in 2015, David dismissed his disappointment with his caricature, explaining that his PR team insisted that he &quot;play hurt&quot; and had since &quot;made peace&quot; with Francis. David did say in 2022 that he felt the show “made cheap shots” of various celebrities including David Beckham and that he felt that the rubber mask portrayal of various black celebrities was racist. He also questioned Francis’ apology over the timing in terms of the George Floyd protests in 2020.

Trisha Goddard did not like the way she was portrayed on the show, feeling her portrayal was &quot;racially over the top&quot; and that she would try to avoid Francis at public events, feeling &quot;sick to her stomach&quot;. She discussed her children being bullied as a result of the show.

In June 2020, after an agreement between Channel 4 and Francis, the show was taken down from All 4 following backlash over its frequent use of blackface. Francis apologised for playing black celebrities in the show.

<text>Świerczewo is a municipal neighborhood of the city of Szczecin, Poland situated on the left bank of Oder river, west of the Szczecin Old Town and Middle Town, in Zachód (West) District. As of January 2011 it had a population of 16,860.

The area became part of the emerging Polish state under its first ruler Mieszko I around 967, and following Poland&#x27;s fragmentation it formed part of the Duchy of Pomerania.

== History ==
The area became part of the emerging Polish state under its first ruler Mieszko I around 967, and following Poland&#x27;s fragmentation it formed part of the Duchy of Pomerania. The town was probably founded in the 13th century.

=== 1200-1600 ===
Warszewo appears for the first time in a document from April 18, 1261, where Duke Barnim I, with the consent of the bishop Hermann von Gleichen, and the collegium of 12 canons in Szczecin, consecrated a church in Warszewo. In 1271, Barnim I donated Warszewo and 48 voloks (approx. 861 ha) to the Cistercian monastery in Szczecin, later 4 voloks (approx. 71 ha) of land purchased from the knight Tomasz were donated to the monastery in 1278. Already during the times of Barnim I, Warszewo became the property of the monastery. In 1280, the Cistercian prior Wolterus granted Wessel, a burgher from Szczecin, 10 voloks (approx. 179ha) of land in Warszewo.

Until 1289, patronage of the church in Warszewo the collegiate church of the Najświętszej Marii Panny in Szczecin administered it to the Cistercian nuns from Szczecin.

In 1362, Henryk Brakel gave the Cistercian nuns 6 lans (approx. 107 ha) of land. In 1400, Dukes Swantibor I and Bogislaw VII approved the purchase of 8 voloks (approx. 143 ha) of land by the monastery from the von Buck family.

In 1529, Hans Bredow became the guardian of the Warszewo church. At that time, mainly barley was grown in Warszewo, and later potatoes. Cattle and pigs were bred.

=== 1700-1900 ===
Due to the very efficient water sources in Warszewo, the king decided to build a waterworks. It was supervised by the Swiss Abraham Dubendorff. The pipeline was put into operation on August 15, 1732. It operated until 1813 when it was destroyed during the siege of Szczecin. In 1779, there were 15 full-scale farms and 2 livestock farms in the village. 5 craftsmen, 2 shepherds, an innkeeper and a teacher.

In the years 1824-1826, became the abolition of serfdom. This resulted in the purchase of a large number of farmsteads by the innkeeper and miller. In 1862, there were 59 residential houses and 58 other buildings in Warszewo. In the second half of the 19th century. Brickworks were built in Warszewo (on today&#x27;s Podbórzańska Street). The machines used there were designed by Max Ritterbant, an engineer from Szczecin. A few years later, another 5 brickworks were built.
The cemetery at today&#x27;s Wapienne Street was established in 1870. In 1887, the cemetery was visited by William I. For this reason, his monument was built there, but it was destroyed in 1945 after the Soviet troops entered Szczecin.

=== 1910-1945 ===
In 1911, a pastor&#x27;s house and a chapel were built at today&#x27;s 125 Rostocka Street. In the same period, small settlements were built, such as Podbórz (German&quot;: Seidel&#x27;s Ruh&quot;), Goślice (&quot;Vogelsang&quot;), Bukowo (&quot;Alt Buchholz&quot;) and Sienno (&quot;Heuershof&quot;)

In 1934, the director of the Szczecin School of Artistic Crafts, Kurt Schwerdtfeger, designed an elephant sculpture. This sculpture still stands in Warszewo and is one of the attractions of this district. In the 1920s and 1930s, Odolany and the area of today&#x27;s Dzierżonia and Perlista Streets were incorporated into Warszewo.

During World War II, Warszewo was not affected by hostilities, but after July 1944, bombs fell on the districts, which destroyed several buildings and caused serious injuries.

On September 19, 1945, Warszewo was included to Szczecin.

<text>Odolany is a residential neighbourhood in the city of Szczecin, Poland, located in the municipal neighborhood of Warszewo, in the city district of Północ.

== Name ==
The current name of the neighbourhood, &quot;Odolany&quot;, was given to it after 1946, when, in the aftermath of World War II, it was incorporated from Germany into Poland. It was named after the neighbourhood of Odolany in the city of Warsaw. It comes from the Slavic male first name, &quot;Odolan&quot;. Prior to that, it was briefly known as &quot;Mściwoje&quot;. Originally, while under German administration, its name was &quot;Wedelshöhe&quot;, which in German means &quot;Wedel&#x27;s Hill&quot;.

The settlement was incorporated into the nearby city of Stettin (now known as Szczecin) on 15 October 1939.

During the Second World War there was located the Polenlager forced labour camp for Polish prisoners captured and deported from the General Government (occupied Poland) to Germany. The settlement was destroyed during the war.

In 1946, in the aftermath of World War II, it, as part of the area known as the Recovered Territories, was incorporated from Germany into Poland. It was then renamed from &quot;Wedelshöhe&quot; to &quot;Mściwoje&quot;. Later it was renamed again, to &quot;Odolany&quot;, after the neighbourhood of Odolany in the city of Warsaw.

<text>Bukowo is a municipal neighbourhood of Szczecin, Poland situated on the left bank of Oder river, in the northern part of the city, south of the town of Police. As of January 2011 it had a population of 3,720.

The area became part of the emerging Polish state under its first ruler Mieszko I around 967, and following Poland&#x27;s fragmentation it formed part of the Duchy of Pomerania. During the Thirty Years&#x27; War, the settlement fell to the Swedish Empire. Later on, it passed to Prussia, and from 1871 to 1945 it was part of Germany, within which it was known as &quot;Buchholz&quot;.

<text>Gunnbjørn Fjeld is the highest mountain in Greenland, Denmark, and north of the Arctic Circle. It is a nunatak, a rocky peak protruding through glacial ice.

==Geography==
Gunnbjørn Fjeld is located in the Watkins Range, an area of nunataks on the east coast, which contains several other summits above 3,500 metres. Its height is often given as , although figures vary slightly.

This is higher than Snæfellsjökull, 530.2 kilometers away on the west coast of Snæfellsnes on Iceland.

Normal straight light rays do not allow one to simultaneously see Gunnbjørn Fjeld and Snæfellsjökull. However, arctic mirages allow seeing long distances by refracting (bending) the light. This effect is caused by a thermal density gradient in the atmosphere. It has been suggested that mutual visibility may exist under hillingar effect or &quot;Arctic mirage&quot; conditions.

==History==
Gunnbjørn Fjeld was first climbed on 16 August 1935 by Augustine Courtauld, Jack Longland, Ebbe Munck and Lawrence Wager. It is named after Gunnbjörn Ulfsson, the first European to have sighted Greenland.

The peak rises in an uninhabited part of the eastern coast of Greenland. The mountain is climbed infrequently due to its remote location. Access is often done with helicopter or ski-equipped plane (normally from Iceland).

<text>Craig David Adams (born 4 April 1962) is an English musician, bass guitarist and songwriter. Over his career he has worked with a variety of rock bands, the most notable being the Sisters of Mercy and the Mission.

== Biography ==
Craig David Adams was born in Otley, Yorkshire, on 4 April 1962, and was brought up in Leeds. Adams left school to pursue a career in music and initially played keyboards in a local band the Expelairs, who released a handful of singles. He left the five-piece due to musical differences and took up bass. Inspired by Motörhead he began to channel his bass through distortion effects. After a short conversation in a local bar with Andrew Eldritch he joined The Sisters of Mercy. Here Adams developed his songwriting abilities, contributing mainly to arrangements and using his higher ranged voice for backing vocals which contrasted with Eldritch&#x27;s melancholic baritone.

When Adams and Hussey tired of the way that the Sisters of Mercy worked, they left and together they formed the Mission (initially the Sisterhood). Adams recorded four albums with the band and two compilations. As one of the co-founders, Adams&#x27; presence was pivotal in its success although his occasionally destructive behaviour brought a level of instability to the line-up. During the first tour of North America, Adams broke his hand while punching the window of the bus and was forced to return to the UK to recover. During the &#x27;Deliverance&#x27; tour of 1990 guitarist Simon Hinkler left, signalling serious problems within the band. After the release of the 1992 album &quot;Masque&quot;, Adams was sacked, with the press reporting Hussey citing personal differences as the main motivation. In the biographical book about The Mission, &quot;Names Are For Tombstones, Baby&quot;, it states that they were on good terms personally, but that they were going in opposite directions musically.

Adams was recruited by Billy Duffy in 1993 to play bass with the Cult on a European tour. The two had first met when the Sisterhood, including Adams, had opened for The Cult throughout Europe in Jan/ Feb 1986. Adams stayed with The Cult to record the self-titled &#x27;Cult&#x27; album in 1994 with producer Bob Rock, and tour extensively throughout Europe, and North and South America. His time with the Cult ended when the group disbanded in March 1995. He temporarily rejoined The Cult for a handful of dates in the United States, in October 2002.

Adams collaborated with Duffy again in 1998, forming Coloursound with Duffy, Mike Peters (of the Alarm), and Scott Garrett, who had also played with the Cult at the same time as Adams. Coloursound released one self-titled album in 1999, on Peters&#x27; own 21st Century Records.

Adams continued with Peters in several touring versions of the Alarm 1999–2005, and played on their 2004 album In the Poppy Fields, produced by Steve Brown.

In 2006, Adams was recruited by Kirk Brandon to join post-punk group Spear of Destiny, playing on several releases, including Imperial Prototype (2007), Omega Point (2010) and 31 (2014). Adams has also contributed to Brandon&#x27;s other ongoing touring project, Theatre of Hate.

In 2012 Adams released the album &quot;Demon King&quot;, produced by Mike Kelly.

In 2014, Adams collaborated with Cuban American dark cabaret singer Voltaire in his tenth album, &quot;Raised by Bats&quot;.

<text>Stołczyn is a municipal neighbourhood of Szczecin, Poland situated on the left bank of the Oder river, in the northern part of the city. As of January 2011 it had a population of 4,459.

The area became part of the emerging Polish state under its first ruler Mieszko I around 967, and following Poland&#x27;s fragmentation it formed part of the Duchy of Pomerania. During the Thirty Years&#x27; War, the settlement fell to the Swedish Empire. Later on, it passed to Prussia, and from 1871 to 1945 it was part of Germany, within which it was known as &quot;Stolzenhagen&quot;.

<doc id="758174" wikidata="Q539675" url="?curid=758174" title="Charles T. O'Ferrall">
<text>Charles Triplett &quot;Trip&quot; O&#x27;Ferrall (October 21, 1840 – September 22, 1905) was a Virginia lawyer, judge and politician who fought as a cavalry officer in the Confederate States Army, then served as a U.S. Representative from 1883 to 1894 and as the 42nd Governor of Virginia from 1894 to 1898.

==Early and family life==
Charles O&#x27;Ferrall was born in Brucetown, Virginia (then in Frederick County, Virginia, now near Berkeley Springs, West Virginia) to John and Jane Laurens Green O&#x27;Ferrall. His father was an innkeeper and former member of the Virginia General Assembly who was elected Clerk of Court of Morgan County in 1851, and trained his son for the job, which as described below, he received at age 17 due to his father&#x27;s unexpected death. Meanwhile, O&#x27;Ferrell received an education appropriate to his class in local private schools, since Virginia had no public schools until after the American Civil War.
==Personal life==

While recovering from one of his wounds in the American Civil War as described below, in Enterprise, Mississippi, O&#x27;Ferrall met Annie Hand, whom he married on February 8, 1865, before returning to active duty. They had two children. After her death, he married Jennie Wickliff Knight in 1881, with whom he had four more children.
==Early career==
When John O&#x27;Ferrall died suddenly in 1855, the local judge thought highly enough of Charles O&#x27;Ferrall to appoint the fifteen-year-old to hold the clerk&#x27;s post until an election could be held. Charles O&#x27;Ferrall later won an election, at seventeen, to a full six-year term as Clerk of Court. However, he only served less than half the term before the Civil War began.

==Confederate cavalry officer==
Although Morgan County and what became West Virginia were predominantly loyal to the United States, O&#x27;Ferrall supported Virginia&#x27;s decision to declare secession and joined the Confederate States Army. Enlisting as a private in the 12th Virginia Cavalry, O&#x27;Ferrall was immediately offered the position of sergeant. He subsequently distinguished himself in several battles, leading to promotion to the rank of major, and was allowed to form a cavalry battalion, the 23rd Virginia Cavalry. Eight times, O&#x27;Ferrall was wounded in battle, twice severely. The first serious wound was a shot near his heart on June 21, 1863 during the Battle of Upperville in Fauquier County. The first surgeon to treat him told him he would die, but his mother (who had been born in Fauquier County) traveled sixty miles to tend to him personally, and with the assistance of Dr. Thomas Settle of Paris, O&#x27;Ferrall survived to fight again. On September 22, 1864, in the Battle of Fisher&#x27;s Hill, O&#x27;Ferrall received a severe wound near his right knee that sidelined him for several months, probably recuperating near New Market.

By the war&#x27;s end, O&#x27;Ferrall held the rank of colonel and commanded all cavalry in the Shenandoah Valley. His regiment engaged in the last fight of the war on Virginia soil, dispersing Federal soldiers encamped at Pugh&#x27;s Run near Woodstock.

==Lawyer, state delegate and U.S. Congressman==
After the war, O&#x27;Ferrall returned to run the family&#x27;s inn. However, he found this both personally and financially unfulfilling. He decided to pursue a law degree at Washington College (later Washington and Lee University). He graduated in 1869 and started a law practice in Harrisonburg. Harrisonburg would remain his residence until 1893, when he moved to Richmond to begin his gubernatorial term. Initially he lived on East Market Street, then moved to the east side of South Main Street, nest to Judge George G. Grattan.

After former Confederates had their civil rights restored, O&#x27;Ferrall quickly returned to politics and successfully ran for the Virginia House of Delegates in 1871. However, the following year, he lost his attempt for a seat in the U.S. Congress. In 1874, fellow legislators elected O&#x27;Ferrall as a judge for Rockingham County. However, he found the job tedious and returned to his private legal practice when his six-year term ended.

After several years of practicing law and assisting various Conservative Democratic candidates, O&#x27;Ferrall challenged the one-term incumbent John Paul (former Rockingham County Commonwealth attorney and state senator who ran as a Readjuster Democrat) for Virginia&#x27;s 7th congressional district in 1883. The initial election vote count showed O&#x27;Ferrall down by 200 votes (out of 24,000 in a three-person race), but he contested the result and eventually won the seat. O&#x27;Ferrall subsequently won reelection five times, serving ten years in the House of Representatives (and Paul became a U.S. District judge). O&#x27;Ferrall&#x27;s congressional career was largely unremarkable, though he did gain a reputation as a staunch advocate for Virginia and of Democratic President Grover Cleveland.

==Governor==
After twice failing to win the Democratic nomination for Virginia&#x27;s governor, O&#x27;Ferrall determined to make a strong push in 1893. With the support of the statewide Democratic organization formed by Virginia&#x27;s U.S. Senator Thomas Staples Martin, O&#x27;Ferrall easily won the nomination. The Republicans decided not to contest the election, so O&#x27;Ferrall&#x27;s only opponent was Populist Party candidate Edmund R. Cocke whom he defeated with 59.71% of the vote. O&#x27;Ferrall benefited from fears of populism and Black equality to win the election with the largest majority that any Virginia governor had ever received.

The first half of O&#x27;Ferrall&#x27;s term as governor was highlighted by his willingness to use strong measures to preserve law and order. He dispatched armed forces to protect nonstriking miners and maintain peace during a miners&#x27; strike and also to drive Coxey&#x27;s &quot;army&quot; of protest marchers out of the state. Despite his public stance as a white supremacist, O&#x27;Ferrall was also quick to send troops to break up mob violence and prevent lynchings. His actions thus defused several high-profile situations, and he remained a generally popular governor through the end of 1895.

In 1896, a Presidential election year, the issue of bimetallism and &quot;Free Silver&quot; dominated Democratic Party politicians, alienating O&#x27;Ferrall, who had always staunchly advocated the gold standard. The silver issue culminated in the selection of William Jennings Bryan as the Democrats&#x27; 1896 presidential candidate. O&#x27;Ferrall became one of a small group of Virginia Democrats who supported the gold standard and opposed Bryan&#x27;s candidacy. This stand undermined O&#x27;Ferrall&#x27;s popularity and political support and ensured that he would be a lame duck with no significant political accomplishments for the rest of his gubernatorial term. Effectively, O&#x27;Ferrall&#x27;s opposition to the silver issue forced his retirement from public life.

==Electoral history==

*1884; O&#x27;Ferrall was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives with 56.37% of the vote, defeating Republican Dr. Joseph B. Webb.
*1886; O&#x27;Ferrall was re-elected with 51.71% of the vote, defeating Independent Democrat John E. Roller.
*1888; O&#x27;Ferrall was re-elected with 54.32% of the vote, defeating now-Republican Roller and Populist John C. Rivercombe.
*1890; O&#x27;Ferrall was re-elected with 89.25% of the vote, defeating Republican I.M. Underwood.
*1892; O&#x27;Ferrall was re-elected with 64% of the vote, defeating Populist Edmund R. Cocke.

==Final years, death and legacy==
Although O&#x27;Ferrall attempted to resume his legal practice, he faced significant health issues, many attributed to his war wounds. In 1904, O&#x27;Ferrall published his autobiography titled, &quot;Forty Years of Active Service&quot;. Shortly after its publication, O&#x27;Ferrall died on September 22, 1905, in Richmond, Virginia, and was buried in the Hollywood Cemetery.

The Library of Virginia maintains his executive papers. His papers are held by the Special Collections Research Center at the College of William &amp; Mary. Additional papers are held by the James Madison University library.

<doc id="758175" wikidata="Q370973" url="?curid=758175" title="Liam O'Flaherty">
<text>Liam O&#x27;Flaherty ( ; 28 August 1896 – 7 September 1984) was an Irish novelist and short-story writer, and one of the foremost socialist writers in the first part of the 20th century, writing about the common people&#x27;s experience and from their perspective. Others are Seán O&#x27;Casey, Pádraic Ó Conaire, Peadar O&#x27;Donnell, Máirtín Ó Cadhain, and Seosamh Mac Grianna all of them Irish language speakers who chose to write either in Irish or English. 

Liam O&#x27;Flaherty served on the Western Front as a soldier in the British army&#x27;s Irish Guards regiment from 1916 and was badly injured in 1917. After the war, he was a founding member of the Communist Party of Ireland. His brother Tom Maidhc O&#x27;Flaherty (also a writer) was also involved in radical politics and their father, Maidhc Ó Flaithearta, was before them. O&#x27;Flaherty wrote almost exclusively in English, except for a play, a notable collection of short stories and some poems in the Irish language.

== Early years ==
O&#x27;Flaherty was born, a son of Maidhc Ó Flaithearta and Maggie Ganley, at Gort na gCapall, Inishmore. Baptised William, he adopted the form &#x27;Liam&#x27; in the 1920s. His family, descendants of the Ó Flaithbertaigh family of Connemara, were not well off. The Irish language was widely spoken in the area, and in the O&#x27;Flaherty household, both English and Irish were used. But according to O&#x27;Flaherty, Irish was not approved at home: &quot;permit me to say that English was the first language I spoke. My father forbade us speaking Irish. At the age of seven I revolted against father and forced everybody in the house to speak Irish.&quot;

In primary school, Liam and his brother Tom were both pupils of David O&#x27;Callaghan, a teacher who had a significant influence on the future writers. Unusually for the times, O&#x27;Callaghan taught his pupils in their native Irish and taught the O&#x27;Flahertys to write Irish. He also instilled in them a strong sense of separatist patriotism and probably added to the radicalism which they took from their father.

O&#x27;Flaherty was an uncle of Gaelic Athletic Association commentator, journalist and writer, Breandán Ó hEithir.

At the age of twelve, in 1908, he moved to County Tipperary to attend Rockwell College. When he was sixteen he won a gold medal from an organisation in Philadelphia for a piece written in Irish. Following a dispute with the college&#x27;s authorities O’Flaherty was transferred, as a lay student, in 1913 to Blackrock College Dublin, where he attempted to form a troop of Irish Volunteers. He studied for a term in Holy Cross College, Clonliffe College. He enrolled for classics and philosophy at University College Dublin, where once again he attempted to form a Volunteer unit.

In 1916 he joined the British Army as a member of the Irish Guards as &#x27;William Ganly&#x27;, using his mother&#x27;s surname, then serving on the Western Front. He found trench life devastating and was badly injured in September 1917 during the Battle of Langemarck, near Ypres in West Flanders. He was discharged on 7 May 1918. The shell shock he suffered profoundly affected his mental health at various times throughout his life.

He returned from the front a socialist. After being discharged, he went travelling including, if his own accounts are to be believed, North and South America, especially Cuba, as well as Europe. He joined the Industrial Workers of the World in Canada and while in New York joined the Communist Party USA, of which his brother Tom was a leading member. He returned to Ireland in late 1921.

Having become interested in Marxism as a schoolboy, atheist and communist beliefs evolved in his 20s and he was a founder member of the first Communist Party of Ireland in 1921, along with James Connolly&#x27;s son Roddy Connolly, and was editor of its weekly paper, the &quot;Workers&#x27; Republic&quot;. In 1922, two days after the establishment of the Irish Free State, O&#x27;Flaherty, as Chairperson of the Council of the Unemployed and other unemployed Dublin workers, seized the Rotunda Concert Hall (the building was later separated from the Rotunda Hospital and is now divided between the Ambassador Cinema and the Gate Theatre) in Dublin and held it for four days flying a red flag, in protest at &quot;the apathy of the authorities&quot;. Free State troops forced their surrender. O’Flaherty went to Cork where a Sinn Féin-Transport Workers&#x27; coalition had been elected but returned to Dublin in June to participate, on the Anti-Treaty Republican side, in the Battle of Dublin.

== Work ==
After the Battle of Dublin, O&#x27;Flaherty left Ireland on 9 July 1922 and moved first to London where, destitute and jobless, he took to writing. In 1923, at the age of 27, O&#x27;Flaherty published his first short story, &quot;The Sniper&quot; and his first novel, &quot;Thy Neighbour&#x27;s Wife&quot;. One of his close associates in London was Carl Lahr, a German socialist, who ran the Progressive Bookshop, in Red Lion Street, and whose circle included many progressive writers, among them D.H. Lawrence and Aldous Huxley. This circle of friends around Lahr was O’Flaherty&#x27;s political home in many respects. It was Lahr and his wife Esther who supported O’Flaherty and published some of his works for the first time, including the play &quot;Darkness&quot; and in 1931 the only recently republished &quot;A Cure for Unemployment&quot;.  He also came to the notice of Edward Garnett, chief editor in the publishing firm of Jonathan Cape, who gave encouragement to many Irish writers at the time.

Back in Dublin in 1924, O’Flaherty co-founded the Radical Club, among whose members were many progressive artists, including Harry Kernoff, and his life-long friend and leading Irish language writer, the socialist and fellow Galway man, Pádraic Ó Conaire, and was involved with the publication of the literary magazine &quot;To-Morrow&quot; (1924). In 1925 O’Flaherty scored immediate success with his best-selling novel &quot;The Informer&quot;, which won him the 1925 James Tait Black Memorial Prize for fiction.  In 1925 he also first met Margaret Barrington, a writer and wife of Trinity College historian Edmund Curtis, whom he later married. The couple had one child, Pegeen (1926-2022) and divorced amicably in 1932. O’Flaherty also had a second daughter with the sister of Rose Cohen, British communist Nellie Cohen, named Joyce Rathbone (1929–2010).

Much of O’Flaherty&#x27;s work in the twenties is clearly influenced by Expressionism, an anti-imperialist art form with origins in Germany. He would have come across this in the Lahr circle, but progressive writers in Ireland were also very familiar with it. The Dublin Drama League staged Ernst Toller&#x27;s &quot;Masses and Man&quot; at the Abbey Theatre in January 1925. Performing the work of this influential German revolutionary and expressionist playwright, opened possibilities for a dynamic relationship between German expressionism and the Irish movement. O’Flaherty&#x27;s only expressionist, Irish language play &quot;Dorchadas/Darkness,&quot; was written in 1925, and staged at the Abbey, in 1926. Apart from &quot;Dorchadas/Darkness,&quot; O’Flaherty&#x27;s expressionist works include &quot;Mr Gilhooley&quot; (1926), which caused an uproar over its &#x27;indecent&#x27; content, &quot;The Assassin&quot; (1928), based on the assassination of the Irish government minister Kevin O&#x27;Higgins in 1927, and &quot;The House of Gold&quot; (1929), which was the first of five O’Flaherty novels to be banned by the Irish State. His fine anti-war novel &quot;Return of the Brute&quot; (1929) is set in the World War I trenches and was published the same year as &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot;. Another text expressing O’Flaherty&#x27;s deep anti-war sentiments was the short story &quot;The Discarded Soldier&quot; written at the request of his brother Tom, for the CPUSA paper &quot;The Daily Worker&quot; (27 June 1925). This was never collected, and republished by the successor to &quot;The Daily Worker&quot;, &quot;People’s World&quot; on the centenary of the end of WWI, 9 November 2018. The atmosphere in 1920s Ireland, leading to the setting up of the Censorship of Publications Board and their banning of many works of literature, including O’Flaherty&#x27;s, inspired the political satire &quot;A Tourist’s Guide To Ireland&quot;, published in 1929.

O’Flaherty left Ireland again for London in early 1930 and from there travelled to the USSR on a Soviet ship on 23 April 1930. Diplomatic relations between Britain and the USSR were newly re-established after collapsing in May 1924. Russian was the first language into which O’Flaherty&#x27;s work was translated, and during the 1920s, he was the most widely translated Irish author in the Soviet Union. He employs a self-declared unreliable narrator in his political satire &quot;I Went to Russia&quot;, published by Cape in 1931, which begins &quot;I set out to join the great horde of … liars who have been flooding the book markets of the world … with books about the Bolsheviks&quot;. O&#x27;Flaherty would later express regret about the way that the book had been misinterpreted as representing a genuine disillusionment on his part, describing the USSR in 1934 as &#x27;that workshop...where the civilization of the future is being hammered out.&#x27;

Victor Gollancz published &quot;Skerrett&quot; in 1932. O’Flaherty spent the best part of a year in the United States, from late April 1934 to June 1935, mostly in Hollywood. It was the year his relative John Ford made the famous film adaptation of O’Flaherty&#x27;s 1925 novel &quot;The Informer&quot;, which premiered on 1 May 1935. The novel had previously been made into a film in 1929, also called &quot;The Informer&quot;, directed by Arthur Robison. Written quite cinematically in the 1920s, when cinema was still a relatively new art form, some of O’Flaherty&#x27;s novels lent themselves easily to film adaptations.

It was in California that O’Flaherty met his future partner Kitty Tailer. A sardonic account of his experience in Hollywood is given in his only novel set outside Ireland, the social satire &quot;Hollywood Cemetery&quot; (1935). He also worked with the French director Jeff Musso in the making of other films based on his novels &quot;Mr Gilhooly&quot; and &quot;The Puritan&quot;. His autobiography &quot;Shame the Devil&quot; appeared in 1934, and in 1937 &quot;The Short Stories of Liam O’Flaherty&quot; as well as the first serious artistic account of the Irish Famine, &quot;Famine&quot;, written uncompromisingly from the people&#x27;s point of view and telling of their resistance.

By 1940 he was living in the United States with Tailer, the couple returned to Ireland in 1952.

Most of O&#x27;Flaherty&#x27;s writing took place in the fourteen years starting with the publication of his first novel, 1923-1937 (between the ages of 27 and 41), when he wrote 14 of his 16 novels as well as many of his short stories, the play, and some non-fiction books, as well as poetry.

== Writing in Irish ==
As well as his play &quot;Dorchadas&quot; and some poetry, O’Flaherty was a distinguished short story writer in Irish. The collection &quot;Dúil&quot;, published in 1953 when his writing activity was coming to an end, contained 18 short stories in Irish which he had written over many years. Some of the stories in &quot;Dúil&quot; are similar to the short stories O&#x27;Flaherty previously published in English. According to Angeline A. Kelly, at least two of the 18, &quot;Daoine Bochta&quot; and &quot;An Fiach&quot;, both written in 1925, were originally written in Irish. The other stories may have begun as unpublished stories written in Irish, but which got their first publication by being reformulated into English before finally being published in their original Irish version in &quot;Dúil&quot;. This was probably the case for &quot;Díoltas&quot;, for example, which became &quot;The Pedlar&#x27;s Revenge&quot;. This collection, now widely admired, had a poor reception at the time and this seems to have discouraged him from proceeding with an Irish language novel he had in hand. In a letter written to &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; years later, he confessed to a certain ambivalence regarding his work in Irish, and spoke of other Irish writers who received little praise for their work in the language. This gave rise to some controversy.

In a letter to the Editor of the &quot;Irish Statesman&quot;, O’Flaherty had commented in 1927 on the issue of his writing in Irish: &quot;I wrote a few short stories for the Gaelic League organ. They printed them … I consulted Pádraic Ó Conaire and we decided that drama was the best means of starting a new literature in Irish … the two of us went to Dublin …[and] put our scheme before them [the Gaeltacht Commission] for a travelling theatre and so on. I guaranteed to write ten plays. They thought we were mad and, indeed, took very little interest in us. In fact, I could see by their looks and their conversation that they considered us immoral persons&quot;. Shortly after this an end was put to the whole idea when the editor of &quot;An Claidheamh Soluis&quot; came to O’Flaherty one day and said that he was forced to tell him that his writings would be no longer welcome in &quot;An Claidheamh Soluis&quot;. O’Flaherty commented &quot;That news disgusted me; but it disgusted Pádraic even more&quot;. The play O’Flaherty wrote, &quot;undaunted&quot; by this reception, and which he gave to Gearóid Ó Lochlainn, was &quot;Dorchadas&quot;, possibly the only expressionist play to be written in Irish. It was performed at the Abbey a few weeks after Sean O’Casey&#x27;s &quot;The Plough and the Stars&quot; at the same theatre. O’Flaherty writes that it was &quot;packed, which rarely happens for these Gaelic plays&quot; and that it was packed with detectives. It first appeared in print in O’Flaherty&#x27;s own translation into English in &quot;The New Coterie&quot;, a magazine edited by Charles Lahr and Esther Archer in the summer of 1926.

In 2020, Mícheál Ó Conghaile published a translation of thirty of O’Flaherty&#x27;s English language short stories into Irish. Seán Ó Ríordáin said of O’Flaherty&#x27;s writing in Irish: &quot;I have read some stories by Liam O’Flaherty and sensed that some living things had been caught between the covers. If you held a robin and felt it quiver in your hands you would know what I felt reading O’Flaherty’s Irish.&quot;

== Censorship in Ireland and republishing by Irish publishers of O’Flaherty&#x27;s work ==
In 1929, at the recommendation of the Committee on Evil Literature, the Censorship of Publications Act established the Censorship of Publications Board to examine books and periodicals, with the authority to prohibit any of these they found to be obscene. Their decision made it illegal to buy, sell or distribute that publication in the Republic of Ireland. The first book to be banned by this Board was O&#x27;Flaherty&#x27;s expressionist Galway novel &quot;The House of Gold&quot; which took to task the gombeen men who seized power in the Irish Free State following independence. The other banned works by O’Flaherty were: &quot;The Puritan&quot; (1932), &quot;The Martyr&quot;, (1933), &quot;Shame the Devil&quot; (1934), &quot;Hollywood Cemetery&quot; (1937). All of O’Flaherty&#x27;s novels were first printed outside Ireland.

It was not until the founding of Wolfhound Press by Seamus Cashman in 1974 that many of O’Flaherty’s works finally found an Irish publishing house. Cashman&#x27;s publishing house re-printed many of O’Flaherty&#x27;s novels and collections of short stories throughout the 1970s and 1980s.

Nuascéalta has reprinted for the first time since their banning the novels that had not been republished since: &quot;The House of Gold&quot; (2013), &quot;Hollywood Cemetery&quot; (2019) and &quot;The Martyr&quot; (2020). In addition, Nuascéalta republished the virtually unknown short story &quot;The Cure for Unemployment&quot; (&quot;Three Leaves of a Bitter Shamrock&quot;, 2014).

== Later years ==

O’Flaherty&#x27;s last novel, &quot;Insurrection&quot;, about the Easter Rising, was published in 1950. Despite his abhorrence of war, O’Flaherty portrays the possibility of fighting for a justified cause, a war of liberation in this novel, written in the immediate aftermath of the Second World War. O’Flaherty&#x27;s last short story appeared in 1958.

O&#x27;Flaherty died on 7 September 1984, aged 88, in Dublin. His ashes were scattered on the cliffs of his native Inis Mór.

In 2012, The Liam &amp; Tom O’Flaherty Society was set up to promote the writings and work of both O’Flaherty brothers, their life and times.

The original publication of these stories was spread between over a dozen journals and magazines. Many collections have also been published, including collections containing selections of stories from previous collections.

<doc id="758177" wikidata="Q202443" url="?curid=758177" title="Sadako Ogata">
<text>, was a Japanese academic, diplomat, author, administrator, and professor emerita at the Roman Catholic Sophia University. She was widely known as the head of the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) from 1991 to 2000, as well as in her capacities as Chair of the UNICEF Executive Board from 1978 to 1979 and as President of the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) from 2003 to 2012. She also served as Advisor of the Executive Committee of the Japan Model United Nations (JMUN).

==Early and academic life==
She was born on 16 September 1927 to a career diplomat father Toyoichi Nakamura (who became in 1943 the Japanese ambassador to Finland) and her original name was Sadako Nakamura. Her mother was a daughter of Foreign Minister Kenkichi Yoshizawa and granddaughter of Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi, who was assassinated when she was four years old, due to his opposition to Japanese militarism, whose assassination marked the end of civilian control over the Japanese military until after World War II.

She was born in Tokyo, Japan and, due to her father&#x27;s profession, she lived in the U.S. (she attended the Catlin Gabel School in Portland) from 4 to 8 years old, also lived in China from 8 to 10 during the Japanese occupation when her father was Japanese consul in Guangzhou and Hong Kong before the family went back to Japan. She stayed in Japan during World War II and after the war, she graduated from the University of the Sacred Heart in Tokyo with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in English Literature. Though it was not common for a Japanese woman to study abroad at that time, she dared to study at Georgetown University and its Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service, earning a master&#x27;s degree in International Relations. She wanted to study the reason why Japan entered a reckless aggression war, which was not put a brake on after the assassination of her great-grandfather, Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi. She was awarded a PhD in Political Science from the University of California, Berkeley in 1963, after she completed a dissertation on the politics behind the foundation of Manchukuo. The study analyzed the causes of the Japanese invasion of China. As for her personal life, in 1960 she married Shijuro Ogata and her name changed from Sadako Nakamura to Sadako Ogata. In 1965, she became Lecturer at International Christian University in Tokyo. After 1980, she taught international politics at Sophia University in Tokyo as a professor and later became Dean of the Faculty of Foreign Studies until her departure to join the UNHCR in 1991.

==Career==
=== United Nations / United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees ===
Ogata was appointed to Japan&#x27;s UN mission in 1968, on the recommendation of Fusae Ichikawa, a female member of the House of Councillors of Japan, who was an activist of the women&#x27;s suffrage in Japan since the 1920s and had a high opinion of Ogata&#x27;s character &amp; ability. Ogata represented Japan at several sessions of the UN General Assembly in 1970. In addition, she served from 1978 to 1979 as Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary for the permanent mission of Japan to the UN, and as Chair of the UNICEF Executive Board.

In 1990, she was appointed as head of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). She was the first woman to be appointed as a head of the UNHCR. She left Sophia University to start her new position at UNHCR. Her presumed term at UNHCR was only three years, which was the remaining term of her predecessor who had left after only one year, but she continued to be assigned. She was re-elected twice (in November 1993 and in September 1998), and served, over a decade, until 2001.

As head of the UNHCR, she implemented effective strategies and helped countless refugees escape from despair, including Kurdish refugees after the Gulf War, refugees in the Yugoslav Wars, refugees in the Rwandan genocide, and Afghan refugees including victims of Cold War. In the face of Kurdish refugees at the border between Turkey and Iraq, Ogata expanded the mandate of UNHCR to include the protection of internally displaced persons (IDPs). She was a practical leader who deployed military forces in the humanitarian operations, for example at the siege of Sarajevo, the Airlift Operations in cooperation with some European air forces during the Bosnian War. During the period, the budget and the staff in UNHCR more than doubled.

Her formidable negotiating skills and petite stature earned her the nickname of &quot;diminutive giant.&quot;

After UNHCR leader, in 2001, she became co-chairperson of UN Human Security Commission.

=== RET International ===
In December 2000, and coinciding with the end of her second term at the High Commission at UNHCR, as well as the 50th anniversary of the agency, Ogata announced the launch of RET International in Geneva, Switzerland. Ogata’s vision for RET was to bridge a massive gap she had witnessed during her tenure as the head of the UN Refugee Agency, specifically in education for youth.

The organization, whose initials stood for &quot;Refugee Education Trust&quot;, would be devoted to secondary education for refugees as Ogata saw this as a critical gap in need of a solution. She believed that if adolescents and youth are not given any opportunities, they will become extremely vulnerable to illegal activities, gangs, underage labor, drug trafficking, sexual abuse, sex trafficking, and violence. RET, therefore, would aim to provide them with the skills to confront these threats, develop their resilience to become self-reliant. 

At inception, RET worked exclusively in refugee camps using education as a tool. However, as refugee migration patterns changed and new crises emerged, the paradigm shifted in different parts of the world and the organization developed methods specifically for refugee camps, proved to be adaptable to young people in fragile environments in general.

As of 2025, the organization remains headquartered in Geneva operates in 15 countries around the world. It has worked directly with a number of UN agencies over the years, including UNHCR, as well as governments, and private foundations to provide opportunities to vulnerable communities.

=== Japanese government / JICA President ===
In 2001, after the September 11 attacks, she was appointed as Special Representative of Prime Minister of Japan on Reconstruction Assistance to Afghanistan. 

The Koizumi government approached Ogata as a candidate to replace Makiko Tanaka as Japanese foreign minister in early 2002, but Ogata refused to accept the position. Although Ogata did not publicly explain her refusal, Kuniko Inoguchi told &quot;The New York Times&quot; that Ogata &quot;would hate to be used as a token or a figurehead because she has fought all her life for the condition of women, and she wouldn&#x27;t help someone who would try to use her for their political purposes.&quot;

Next year, going back to Tokyo, the Japanese government appointed her as President of the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) on 1 October 2003. It was reported that young JICA officials expressed their strong desire for her leadership, even before the formal appointment. She led JICA with her emphasis on ideas from fields and Human Security. She built up peace-building projects on Afghanistan and Mindanao. By adding loan assistance, under her leadership JICA became the world-largest bi-laterial aid organization in 2008. She continued to work as president of JICA for more than two terms (over eight years), retiring in April 2012 to be succeeded by Akihiko Tanaka.

She was a member of The Advisory Council on the Imperial House Law on 27 November 2014. The council was Junichiro Koizumi then-Prime Minister&#x27;s private advisory organ which belonged to the Cabinet Office. The council met 17 times from 25 January 2005 to discuss the Japanese succession controversy and the Imperial Household Act. On 24 November 2005, The Advisory Council&#x27;s recommendation included female members&#x27; right to the throne including the right to be extended to the female lineage, and extension of the primogeniture to female members of the imperial household. Both Ogata and Empress Michiko&#x27;s &quot;alma mater&quot; is the University of the Sacred Heart.

A &quot;Reception for Respecting Mrs. Sadako Ogata&#x27;s Contributions to Our Country and the International Community&quot; was held by Kōichirō Genba, Minister for Foreign Affairs on 17 April 2012, in Tokyo. Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda gave a speech. He said &quot;Because of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, the offers of assistance to Japan from more than 160 countries and more than 40 international organizations were NOT irrelevant to Mrs. Sadako Ogata&#x27;s achievements&quot;.

Ogata was involved in the Sergio Vieira de Mello Foundation.

==Quotes==
*&quot;If we ignore the plight of the refugees or the burden of the countries which have received them, I fear we will pay a heavy toll in renewed violence. Conditions must be created urgently to allow the refugees to go back and live in peace and tolerance in their own country.&quot; — Liberty Medal acceptance speech, 4 July 1995

In 1960, she married Shijuro Ogata (1927–2014), a son of Taketora Ogata, who was also an official of the Bank of Japan and later became its executive director. After the marriage, she changed her name from Sadako Nakamura to Sadako Ogata. She has one son (Atsushi Ogata, a film director) and one daughter. Ogata died on 22 October 2019 at the age of 92.

<text>Załom-Kasztanowe (until 2012: &quot;Załom&quot;) is a municipal neighborhood of the city of Szczecin, Poland situated on the right bank of Oder river, east of the Szczecin Old Town, and Szczecin-Dąbie.

The area became part of the emerging Polish state under its first ruler Mieszko I around 967, and following Poland&#x27;s fragmentation it formed part of the Duchy of Pomerania. During the Thirty Years&#x27; War, the settlement fell to the Swedish Empire. Later on, it passed to Prussia, and from 1871 to 1945 it was part of Germany, within which it was known as &quot;Arnimswalde&quot;.

<text>Adone Alvaro Ugo Natale Camillo Zoli (16 December 1887 – 20 February 1960) was an Italian politician who served as the 35th prime minister of Italy from May 1957 to July 1958; he was the first senator to have ever held the office.

A member of the Christian Democracy, Zoli served also as minister of Grace and Justice, Finance and Budget, during the 1950s.

==Early life==
Adone Zoli was born in Cesena, Emilia-Romagna, in 1887. He grew up in a wealthy and Catholic observant family. In 1907, he graduated in law at the University of Bologna, starting a career as a lawyer first in Genoa, then in Bologna and finally in Florence, where he met Tommaso Brunelli, a Catholic lawyer, elected deputy from Italian People&#x27;s Party (PPI) in 1919, who greatly influenced Zoli&#x27;s political ideology.

During these years he married Lucia Zoli, his cousin, with whom he had three children.

Adone Zoli fought in the World War I as a volunteer, taking part in the battle of Caporetto and obtained, at the end of the conflict, two crosses for war merit and one for military honor. After the war he participated in various congresses of the PPI founded by Don Luigi Sturzo. In 1920, he became a member of party&#x27;s national council, while in October 1921 he was appointed in the national direction, a position that he held until the dissolution of the party in 1926, imposed by the fascist regime of Benito Mussolini. For all his political career, Zoli remained strong anti-fascist.

===Resistance movement===
In 1943, he joined the partisan resistance by setting up the anti-fascist committee in Florence and later joining the National Liberation Committee (CLN), a political umbrella organization and the main representative of the resistance movement fighting against the German occupation of Italy in the aftermath of the Armistice of Cassibile.

In November 1943 he was arrested with two of his children and sentenced to death by the Nazis, but he was freed by his partisan comrades. In February 1944, he avoided another attempt to arrest him, but his wife and three children were arrested instead.

In December 1943, he was among the founders of the Christian Democracy, the new centrist party, heir of the PPI, led by Alcide De Gasperi. After the liberation from the Nazis, Zoli served deputy mayor of Florence in the municipal government chaired by Gaetano Pieraccini.

==Political career==
On 25 September 1945, Zoli was appointed in the National Council, an unelected provisional legislative assembly set up in the Kingdom of Italy after the end of World War II. He remained in office until 1 June 1946, when new election were held, in which Zoli decided not to run.

After the 1948 general election, Zoli was elected to the Senate of the Republic for the constituency of Florence, with nearly 70,000 votes.

===Minister of Justice===

As a close ally of De Gasperi, in July 1951 he was appointed Minister of Grace and Justice in De Gasperi&#x27;s seventh government.

During his ministry he worked to improve conditions of prisoners, which were still subjected to fascist laws and regulations, in accordance with the principle of the re-educational function of the penalty, expressed by the new republican constitution. Zoli implemented important measures that included the abolition of the head shaving for prisoners sentenced to short penalties and the exemption from the obligation to wear prison clothes for prisoners. He also established that the condemned should be called by prison officers by name and no longer by matriculation number. He also increased the courses of education, cinematographic and theatrical performances, and allowed to keep in the cell the necessary to write, as well as the photographs of their families.

In addition, Zoli supported the plan, started by communist leader, Palmiro Togliatti, to grant amnesty for crimes committed &quot;for political ends&quot; from the March on Rome to 18 June 1946. This law, approved by parliament in 1953, increased Zoli&#x27;s popularity.

The 1953 general election was characterised by changes in the electoral law. Even if the general structure remained uncorrupted, the government introduced a superbonus of two-thirds of seats in the House for the coalition which would obtain at-large the absolute majority of votes. The change was strongly opposed by the opposition parties as well as DC&#x27;s smaller coalition partners, who had no realistic chance of success under this system. The new law was called the &quot;Scam Law&quot; by its detractors, including some dissidents of minor government parties who founded special opposition groups to deny the artificial landslide to Christian Democracy.

The campaign of the opposition to the &quot;Scam Law&quot; achieved its goal. The government coalition won 49.9% of national vote, just a few thousand votes of the threshold for a supermajority, resulting in an ordinary proportional distribution of the seats. Technically, the government won the election, winning a clear working majority of seats in both houses. But frustration with the failure to win a supermajority caused significant tensions in the leading coalition. De Gasperi was forced to resign by the Parliament on 2 August. On 17 August, President Einaudi appointed Giuseppe Pella as new prime minister and Zoli was not confirmed at the Ministry of Justice.

===Minister of Finance===

On 12 January 1954, after only five months in power, Prime Minister Pella was forced to resign, after a strong confrontation with many members of DC, regarding the appointment of Salvatore Aldisio as new Minister of Agriculture. President Luigi Einaudi appointed Amintore Fanfani as new head of the government. Fanfani formed a one-party government composed only by members of the Christian Democracy and Zoli was appointed Minister of Finance.

However, the cabinet lasted only 23 days when it failed to win approval in the Parliament, being rejected by the Chamber of Deputies with 260 votes in favor, 303 votes against and 12 abstentions out of 563 present. On 10 February, Mario Scelba sworn in as new prime minister. Fanfani&#x27;s first government was the shortest-lived cabinet in the history of the Italian Republic. Since De Gasperi&#x27;s retirement in 1953 Fanfani emerged as the most probable successor, a role confirmed by his appointment as party secretary in June 1954, a position that he would held until March 1959.

===Minister of Budget===
In April 1955, Giovanni Gronchi was elected new president of the Republic. After the election, a political crisis between Prime Minister Scelba and DC&#x27;s leader Fanfani broke out. In July 1955, Scelba resigned from the office, and Segni received the task of forming a new cabinet. Zoli was appointed Minister of Budget.

In May 1957, the Italian Democratic Socialist Party (PSDI) withdrew its support to the government and on 6 May, Segni resigned.

==Prime Minister of Italy==

President Gronchi gave Zoli the task of forming a new cabinet, and on 20 May, Zoli sworn in as new head of government. He formed a one-party cabinet, composed only by members of the Christian Democracy, in which he kept the &quot;ad interim&quot; Ministry of Budget.

On 4 June 1957, the government obtained the confidence vote in the Senate, with 132 votes in favor and 93 against, and on 7 June in the Chamber of Deputies, with 305 votes in favor, 255 against and 11 abstentions. The government externally supported by the Italian Liberal Party (PLI), the Italian Republican Party (PRI), the PSDI, the monarchist parties and also by the neo-fascist Italian Social Movement (MSI); it was the first time in republican history, that the MSI supported a government. The support of the neo-fascists raised many criticisms and Zoli then simply declared that MSI votes were not necessary for the majority. The next day, however, he realized that the count was wrong and that the MSI&#x27;s support had actually been decisive. Then Zoli, a staunch anti-fascist, resigned on the following 10 June, but he was invited by President Gronchi to withdraw his resignation and to remain in power until the natural dissolution of the Italian Parliament in 1958.

During his premiership, the Parliament approved a law in October 1957 that extended compulsory social security insurance to small farmers, sharecroppers and tenant farmers, while a law of 13 March 1958 extended pension insurance to fishermen. Zoli also approved the request of the MSI to bury the body of Benito Mussolini in Predappio, his hometown; a request that was also supported by Pietro Nenni, leader of the Italian Socialist Party (PSI), who was a personal friend of Mussolini during the 1910s. The Duce&#x27;s body was buried in Predappio on 30 August 1957.

In the 1958 general election, the Christian Democracy gained 42.4% of votes, nearly doubling Palmiro Togliatti&#x27;s Communist Party, which arrived second. However, the poor results of the other small centrist and secular parties kept the same problems of political instability within the centrist coalition, which characterised the previous legislature. As he promised few months before, Zoli resigned after the new general election and, on 1 July 1958, Amintore Fanfani sworn in as new Prime Minister at the head of a coalition government with the PSDI, and a case-by-case support of the PRI.

==Death and legacy==
Adone Zoli died in Rome on 20 February 1960, at the age of 72. He was buried in the family grave in the cemetery of San Cassiano in Predappio, a few meters from the crypt of Mussolini.

In 1963, the President of the Republic Giuseppe Saragat recognized, with a presidential decree, the &quot;Adone Zoli Center for Economic and Social Policy&quot;, an institute founded in memory of the former prime minister.

<text>Wielgowo is a part of the city of Szczecin, Poland situated on the right bank of Oder river, east of the Szczecin Old Town, and Szczecin-Dąbie.

The area became part of the emerging Polish state under its first ruler Mieszko I around 967, and following Poland&#x27;s fragmentation it formed part of the Duchy of Pomerania. During the Thirty Years&#x27; War, the settlement fell to the Swedish Empire. Later on, it passed to Prussia, and from 1871 to 1945 it was part of Germany, within which it was known as &quot;Augustwalde&quot;.

<text>Jacqueline Anne Stallybrass (4 December 1938 – 3 July 2021) was an English actress who trained at the Royal Academy of Music in London. The television roles for which she is best known are Jane Seymour in &quot;The Six Wives of Henry VIII&quot; (1970) and Anne Onedin in &quot;The Onedin Line&quot; (1971–1972). In the 1990s, Stallybrass played Dr Kate Rowan&#x27;s Aunt Eileen in &quot;Heartbeat&quot; (Season 3 episode 5 and Seasons 5–7).

==Biography==
Stallybrass was born in Westcliff-on-Sea, Essex, on 4 December 1938, to Edward Lindsay Stallybrass (1905–1990) and Annie Isobel (née Peacock) Stallybrass (1911–1981), who married in 1933 in Hackney, London. She was educated at St Bernard&#x27;s Convent, Westcliff and spent three years training at the Royal Academy of Music, where she won the Drama Gold Medal. She began her professional acting career by spending several years in repertory, gaining experience in Folkestone Kent, with the Arthur Brough Players, before moving to Nottingham and then to Sheffield.

The television roles for which she is best known are: Jane Seymour in &quot;The Six Wives of Henry VIII&quot; (1970), and Anne Onedin in &quot;The Onedin Line&quot; (1971-1972), written by Cyril Abraham. In 1973 she appeared as a narrator in five episodes of the BBC children&#x27;s television series &quot;Jackanory.&quot; She also appeared as Doreen Haskins, wife of DCI Frank Haskins in the 1970s British police drama &quot;The Sweeney.&quot; She had a minor role at the very end of the Hammer film Countess Dracula.

Other major roles include Anna Strauss in &quot;The Strauss Family&quot; (1972), Susan Henchard in &quot;The Mayor of Casterbridge&quot; (1978 adaptation), and Muriel Thomas in &quot;The Old Devils&quot; (1992). From 1995 until 1998 she played Eileen Reynolds in ITV&#x27;s period police drama &quot;Heartbeat&quot;. She portrayed Queen Elizabeth II, for &quot;&quot; (1993), the made for TV mini-series from Andrew Morton&#x27;s biography. Being a monarchist, she was initially unsure about taking the role, although her family used to tease her for bearing a resemblance to the Queen. She appeared in Midsomer Murders &quot;Strangler&#x27;s Wood&quot; (1999) as Emily Meakham. She was twice nominated for the British Academy Television Award for Best Actress; for her portrayals of Anne Onedin and Anna Strauss.

==Personal life==
Stallybrass married twice and was unable to have children. She described this as &quot;something I have learnt to live with. I take great joy in my three godchildren and have kept in touch with all the &#x27;television children&#x27; I have had. She met her first husband Roger Rowland in Nottingham; the couple married in 1963, separated after nine years of marriage and later divorced. Peter Gilmore&#x27;s second marriage broke up not long after and the friendship between the two &quot;Onedin Line&quot; actors gradually developed. In 1987, after 10 years together the couple married and remained together until Gilmore&#x27;s death in February 2013. They lived in Barnes, London, and owned a cottage, named &quot;Onedin House&quot;, in Dartmouth, which was used as a film location for scenes in &quot;The Onedin Line&quot;.

She died on 3 July 2021, at the age of 82.

<doc id="758200" wikidata="Q715144" url="?curid=758200" title="Pierre Daru">
<text>Pierre Antoine Noël Bruno, Comte de Daru (12 January 1767 – 5 September 1829) was a French soldier, statesman, historian, and poet.

== Early career ==
Born in Montpellier, he was educated at the Oratorian-maintained military school of Tournon, and entered artillery service at an early age. He also took an interest in literature, and he published several minor pieces, until the outbreak of the French Revolution made him concentrate on his military assignments.

In 1793 he became commissary to the army, protecting the coasts of Brittany from projected descents of the British, or of French Royalists. Thrown into prison during the Reign of Terror, on an unsubstantiated charge of friendliness to the Royalists and the British, he was released after the fall of Maximilien Robespierre in the summer of 1794 (during the Thermidorian Reaction), and rose through the ranks until, in 1799, he became chief commissary to the French Revolutionary Army serving under André Masséna in the north of Switzerland.

In that position he won repute for his organizing capacity, capacity of work and probity (the last of which qualities was contrasted with the wave of corruption). He did not however limit himself to his tasks, and found time, even during the campaign, to translate part of Horace and to compose two poems, the &quot;Poème des Alpes&quot; and the &quot;Chant de guerre&quot; – the latter was a condemnation of the murder of the French envoys to the Second Congress of Rastatt.

== Consulate and early Empire ==
The accession of Napoleon Bonaparte to power in November 1799 (the &quot;18 Brumaire coup&quot;) led to the employment of Daru as chief commissary to the Army of Reserve intended for Northern Italy, and commanded nominally by Louis Alexandre Berthier, but really by the First Consul. Conjointly with Berthier and Dejean, he signed the armistice with the Holy Roman Empire which closed the campaign in North Italy in June 1800.

Daru now returned, for a time, mainly to civil life, and entered the tribunate of the French Consulate, where he supported the principles of democracy. On the renewal of war with Great Britain, in May 1803, he again resumed his duties as chief commissary for the army on the northern coasts. It was afterwards asserted that, on Napoleon&#x27;s resolve to turn the army of Great Britain against the Habsburgs after the proclamation of the First French Empire, Daru had set down at the dictation all the details of the campaign which culminated in the battle of Ulm. The story is apocryphal, but Napoleon&#x27;s confidence in him is shown by his being appointed to similar duties in &quot;La Grande Armée&quot;, which in the autumn of 1805 defeated the armies of the Austrian Empire and Russia. After the battle of Austerlitz, he took part in the drafting of the Treaty of Pressburg.

== Prominence ==
At this tune, too, he became intendant-general of the military household of Napoleon. In the campaigns of 1806–1807, Daru served, in his usual capacity, in the army which overthrew the forces of Russia and Prussia; and he had a share in drawing up the Treaty of Tilsit (7 July 1807). After this he supervised the administrative and financial duties in connection with the French army which occupied the principal fortresses of Prussia, and was one of the chief agents through whom Napoleon pressed hard on that land. At the Congress of Erfurt, Daru had the privilege of being present at the interview between Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Napoleon, and interposed tactful references to the works of the great poet.

Daru fulfilled his usual duties in the campaign of 1809 against the Austrians. Afterwards, when the issue of Napoleon&#x27;s divorce from Josephine Beauharnais and the choice of a Russian or of an Austrian princess came to be discussed, Daru, on being consulted by Napoleon, is said to have boldly counselled his marriage with a French lady, and that Napoleon, who admired his frankness and honesty, was not angered by the remark. Still in 1809, he was created a count of the Empire.

In 1811 he became secretary of state in succession to Hugues-Bernard Maret, duc de Bassano, and showed his ability in the administration of the vast and complex affairs of the French Empire, including the arrangements connected with the civil list and the imperial domains. His competent administration was contrasted with the military disasters leading to the fall of the Empire. Late in 1813, he took up the portfolio of military affairs.

After the first abdication of Napoleon in 1814, Daru retired into private life, but aided Napoleon during his return (the Hundred Days). After the Second Bourbon Restoration, he became a member of the Chamber of Peers, in which he again defended the cause of democracy against the attacks of the Ultra-royalists. He died in Meulan.

His son who inherited the title is Napoléon Daru, brother of Viscount Paul Daru. Pierre Daru often appears in the autobiographical works of Stendhal, of whom he was a cousin.

==Legacy==
Several elements of Napoleon III&#x27;s Louvre expansion bear Daru&#x27;s name, including the Louvre&#x27;s most monumental staircase and several exhibition rooms (&quot;escalier Daru&quot;, &quot;galerie Daru&quot;, &quot;salle Daru&quot;).

== Works ==
Besides his translation of Horace, Daru was the author of:
* &quot;Histoire de la République de Venise&quot; (in 7 vols, Paris, 1819)
* &quot;Histoire de Bretagne&quot;, (3 vols, Paris, 1826)
* &quot;Discours en vers sur les facultés de l&#x27;homme&quot; (Paris, 1825)
* &quot;Astronomie&quot; (a didactic poem in six cantos; Paris, 1820)

<text>Kijewo is a municipal neighbourhood of the city of Szczecin, Poland, situated on the right bank of the Oder River, east of the Szczecin Old Town and south-east of Szczecin-Dąbie. As of December 2019, it had a population of 3,515.

The area became part of the emerging Polish state under its first ruler Mieszko I around 967, and following Poland&#x27;s fragmentation it formed part of the Duchy of Pomerania. During the Thirty Years&#x27; War, the settlement fell to the Swedish Empire. Later on, it passed to Prussia, and from 1871 to 1945 it was part of Germany, within which it was known as &quot;Kienwerder&quot;.

<doc id="758206" wikidata="Q870553" url="?curid=758206" title="Venezuelan Summer League">
<text>The Venezuelan Summer League (VSL) was a professional baseball league that operated in Venezuela from 1997 to 2015, primarily in the state of Carabobo. Teams in the league served as academies for Major League Baseball (MLB) organizations, and were classified at the Rookie League level within Minor League Baseball.

==History==
The VSL was created in 1997 as an alternative to the Dominican Summer League (DSL) to improve the development of young prospects from Venezuela in their early years in organized baseball. Besides Carabobo, the states of Aragua, Lara and Yaracuy were represented in the league.

Each team had a roster limit of 35 active players, at least 10 of which had to be pitchers. No player on the active list could have more than four years of minor league service. There were no age limits. The league was closed to all MLB Draft eligible players; that is, players from the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico. Exceptions were made for two players from Puerto Rico. In addition to Venezuela, players in the league came from Argentina, Colombia, Curaçao, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, and Sint Maarten.

The regular season champion and runner-up played a best-of-three-games playoff series for the league championship.

The league had six squads in its first season, 1997, via three teams fielding split-squads. By 1999, the league had grown to 10 individual teams, and had nine teams as late as 2007. The league reduced to four teams in 2012, played the next two seasons with five teams, and was again reduced to four teams in 2015. Political instability in the region led to more teams opting out before the 2016 season, resulting in the league shutting down.

After the suspension of the VSL, the semi-pro Bolivarian League remained as the only summer league in Venezuela (though that would cease operations in 2019). Venezuela would go without a fully-professional summer baseball league until 2021, when the Venezuelan Major League was established.

<text>Klęskowo is a part of the city of Szczecin, Poland situated on the right bank of Oder river, east of the Szczecin Old Town, and south of Szczecin-Dąbie.

The area became part of the emerging Polish state under its first ruler Mieszko I around 967, and following Poland&#x27;s fragmentation it formed part of the Duchy of Pomerania. During the Thirty Years&#x27; War, the settlement fell to the Swedish Empire. Later on, it passed to Prussia, and from 1871 to 1945 it was part of Germany, within which it was known as &quot;Hökendorf&quot;.

<text>Richard Buell Ogilvie (February 22, 1923 – May 10, 1988) was an American attorney and law enforcement officer who served as the 35th governor of Illinois from 1969 to 1973. A wounded combat veteran of World War II, he became known as the mafia-fighting sheriff of Cook County, Illinois, in the 1960s before becoming governor.

==Education and military service==
Ogilvie graduated from high school in Port Chester, New York, in 1940. While attending Yale University, he enlisted in the United States Army in 1942. As a tank commander in France, he was wounded and received the Purple Heart and two Battle Stars. Discharged in 1945, he resumed studies at Yale and in 1947, he earned a Bachelor of Arts majoring in American history. In 1949, he earned a Juris Doctor (J.D.) from Chicago-Kent College of Law. From 1950 to 1954, he practiced law in Chicago and served as an assistant United States Attorney from 1954 to 1955. From 1958 to 1961, he served as a special assistant to the United States Attorney General heading an office fighting organized crime in Chicago and the Chicago Mafia.

==Pre-gubernatorial political career==
Ogilvie was elected sheriff of Cook County, Illinois&#x27; most populous county, in 1962; he served in this position until 1966. While sheriff, he was elected President of the Cook County Board of Commissioners and served from 1966 to 1969, when he resigned upon being elected Governor of Illinois. , he was the last Republican to serve as the chief executive of Cook County. As sheriff, Ogilvie developed a reputation for fighting vice and his office led roughly 1,800 police raids during his tenure. This included the Fun Lounge police raid, which resulted in 109 arrests and is a notable event in the LGBT history of Chicago.

==Governor of Illinois==
In 1968, he was elected governor as a Republican, with 51.2% of the vote, narrowly beating incumbent Democrat Sam Shapiro. His lieutenant governor was Democrat and future U.S. Senator Paul Simon, the only time that Illinois elected a Governor and Lt. Governor of different parties. (However, on at least two other occasions there was an acting Lt. Governor from a different party.)

Bolstered by large Republican majorities in the state house, Ogilvie modernized state government. He successfully advocated for a state constitutional convention, increased social spending, and secured Illinois&#x27; first state income tax. The latter was particularly unpopular with the electorate, and Ogilvie lost a close election to Daniel Walker in 1972, ending his career in elective office.

Ogilvie had many accomplishments during his term as governor. He proposed and successfully pushed for passage of the Illinois state income tax, a vital necessity for rescuing the state from a looming fiscal crisis. He created the Bureau of the Budget to ensure the governor&#x27;s control of the state budgeting process, called for and obtained Illinois General Assembly approval for a record increase in state aid to public education.

Ogilvie campaigned vigorously for successful voter approval of the Illinois Constitution of 1970. He improved management of the Illinois State Fair, and in so doing eliminated irregularities in the handling of concession contracts. Ogilvie established the Illinois Department of Corrections to modernize the state penal system. He directed an expanded role for the Illinois Housing Development Authority, a key agency for combating urban decay. He also established the Illinois Department of Local Government Affairs to assist or advise county and municipal officials in the discharging of their duties. In addition, Ogilvie created the Illinois Department of Law Enforcement to revamp the state&#x27;s policing functions; set up under the Illinois Bureau of Investigation, the state&#x27;s &quot;Little FBI&quot;. He broadened the scope of gubernatorial press conferences by allowing broadcast media to join the print media in coverage of the sessions. He also established the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency to protect air and water resources. One of the first comprehensive environmental protection agencies in the nation, the Illinois EPA became a model for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Ogilvie set up the Illinois Department of Transportation, obtained legislative approval for a major upgrading of the state&#x27;s highway network, and built the east–west toll road linking Chicagoland to Western Illinois.

At Governor Ogilvie&#x27;s request, the General Assembly authorized an experimental junior college in East St. Louis—the State Community College—which did not require a local tax. Also, Ogilvie passed through the Illinois legislature and the City of St. Louis a bi-state airport authority. He significantly upgraded the Illinois Information Service, the state news agency, and revitalized the state General Services Agency.

==Post governorship==
President Richard Nixon considered Ogilvie as a nominee to become Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

In 1979, Governor Ogilvie was appointed as Trustee for the Milwaukee Road, a railroad that had entered bankruptcy. He oversaw its sale to the Soo Line Railroad, a U.S. division of the Canadian Pacific Railway.

Oglivie was the publisher of a revived &quot;Chicago Daily News&quot; in 1979, 18 months after its demise in 1978.

In 1987, he was appointed by then-Secretary of Transportation Elizabeth Dole to chair a committee studying the proposed termination of Amtrak&#x27;s federal subsidy.

Until his death in 1988, he was a partner in the distinguished Chicago law firm of Isham Lincoln &amp; Beale, one of whose founders was Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s son, Robert Todd Lincoln.

==Death and legacy==
After his death in Chicago on May 10, 1988, Governor Ogilvie was cremated and interred in Rosehill Mausoleum, Rosehill Cemetery, Chicago.

In 1997, Chicago &amp; North Western Station, the downtown terminus for Metra commuter trains to many of Chicago&#x27;s northern and western suburbs, was renamed Ogilvie Transportation Center in his honor, two years after the C&amp;NW&#x27;s assets have been purchased and incorporated into Union Pacific. The modern railroad station uses the former C&amp;NW trainshed. Wisconsin Central Ltd. also had an EMD SD45 locomotive named in his honor (WC 7513). Ogilvie had been a longtime supporter of rail transport, and had created the Regional Transportation Authority, Metra&#x27;s parent agency.

==Awards==
Richard B. Ogilvie was inducted as a Laureate of The Lincoln Academy of Illinois and awarded the Order of Lincoln (the State&#x27;s highest honor) by the Governor of Illinois in 1973 in the area of Government.

==In popular culture==

Ogilvie is referenced in the news broadcast that serves as a backdrop for Simon &amp; Garfunkel&#x27;s &quot;7 O&#x27;Clock News/Silent Night,&quot; which reports that Ogilvie, in his position as Cook County Sheriff, asked Martin Luther King Jr. to call off an open-housing march in the Chicago suburb of Cicero. The track was conceived by musician Paul Simon, who coincidentally shares his name with the man who served as lieutenant governor of Illinois under Ogilvie&#x27;s gubernatorial tenure and later represented Illinois in the U.S. Senate.

In the first-season episode &quot;Home Again&quot; of the alternate history science fiction TV series &quot;For All Mankind&quot;, Ogilvie is referenced as being the governor of Illinois in 1974 and that his support for the Equal Rights Amendment plays a role in the state&#x27;s ratification of it.

<doc id="758223" wikidata="Q3566993" url="?curid=758223" title="Webb C. Ball">
<text>Webster Clay Ball (October 6, 1848 – March 6, 1922) was a jeweler and watchmaker born in Fredericktown, Ohio, who founded the Ball Watch Company. When Standard Time was adopted in 1883, he was the first jeweler to use time signals from the United States Naval Observatory, bringing accurate time to Cleveland.

==Personal life==
Born on a farm in Knox County, Ohio, Webb C. Ball was married in 1879 to Florence I. Young, of Kenton, Ohio. They had one son, Sidney Y. Ball (born September 19, 1880), and three daughters, Wilma Ball, Florence Ball, and Alice Ball Andrews. He was the son of Aaron Taylor Ball (born December 19, 1820, in Fredericktown, Ohio) and Sidney Ann Clay (born April 2, 1820, in Frederick, Maryland). His grandparents were Zenas Ball (November 15, 1792, in South Orange, New Jersey – October 3, 1860) and Sarah Taylor (May 24, 1796 – March 30, 1860). He died at his home in Cleveland Heights, Ohio, survived by his wife and children. His grandchildren included Isabel Andrews Burgess, a Nixon appointee to the National Transportation Safety Board.

==Watchmaker history==
After a two-year apprenticeship to a jeweler, Ball settled in Cleveland, Ohio, to join a jewelry store.

In 1891 there was a collision between Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway trains at Kipton, Ohio, which occurred because an engineer&#x27;s watch had stopped. The railroad officials commissioned Webb C. Ball as their Chief Time Inspector, in order to establish precision standards and a reliable timepiece inspection system for railroad chronometers.

He established strict guidelines for the manufacturing of sturdy, reliable precision timepieces, including resistance to magnetism, reliability of time keeping in 5 positions, isochronism, power reserve and dial arrangement, accompanied with record keeping of the reliability of the watch on each regular inspection. 

His original jewelry business in Cleveland grew into the Ball Watch Company (currently headquartered in La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland), which used other watch companies&#x27; movements, perfecting them and then reselling them. Ball Watch Company also ordered watches complete from other watch companies. Ball used movements from the top American manufacturers, Elgin, Hamilton, and Waltham. The company switched to Swiss Avia movements as early as the 1940s. The Waltham Watch Company complied immediately with the requirements of Ball&#x27;s guidelines, later followed by Elgin National Watch Company and most of the other American manufacturers: Aurora, Hamilton, Hampden, E. Howard &amp; Co., Illinois, Seth Thomas, later on joined by some Swiss watch manufacturers: Audemars Piguet, Gallet, Longines, Record Watch, Vacheron Constantin.

Webb C. Ball became the vice president of the Hamilton Watch Company and focused his efforts on developing watches for the railroads. Minutes of Proceedings of Third Triennial Convention of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen held in the B of LE Auditorium, Cleveland, Ohio on May 31, 1921, at 2 pm the convention was called to order by Grand Chief Engineer W.S. Stone, at this afternoon session Webb C. Ball was introduced, he made a speech, and a resolution was passed unanimously, and he was made an Honorary Member of the Brotherhood.

They were the first wrist watch allowed to be used on the railroads, (using a Swiss manual-winding movement) followed quickly by the first American-made wrist watch on &quot;the roads&quot;, Elgin.

The firm was family owned by direct descendants until the 1990s when the right to use the name was sold. The new firm continues the tradition, using Swiss-made (primarily ETA) movements and making watches for sportsmen and even for some small railroads.

At the end of his career, Webb C. Ball was overseeing over of rail tracks in the United States, Mexico &amp; Canada, having greatly contributed to the safety of all railroad systems. The Horological Institute of America celebrated his efforts on October 20, 1921.

<text>State Route 99 (SR 99) is a major north–south state highway in the U.S. state of California, stretching almost the entire length of the Central Valley. From its southern end at Interstate 5 (I-5) near Wheeler Ridge to its northern end at SR 36 near Red Bluff, SR 99 goes through the densely populated eastern parts of the valley. Cities served include Bakersfield, Delano, Tulare, Visalia, Fresno, Madera, Merced, Turlock, Modesto, 
Manteca, Stockton, Sacramento, Yuba City, and Chico.

The highway is a remnant of the former Mexico to Canada U.S. Route 99 (US 99), which was decommissioned in 1972 after being functionally replaced by I-5 for long-distance traffic. The entire segment from Wheeler Ridge to Sacramento has been upgraded as of January 2016 to a freeway at least four lanes wide, and the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) plans to further upgrade the segment to a minimum width of six lanes and also bring it into compliance with Interstate Highway standards as a parallel route to I-5 for Los Angeles–Sacramento traffic. North of Sacramento, the road ranges from a rural two-lane road to a four-lane freeway, with much of it following the route formerly designated as US 99E.

A 2024 study conducted by a Dallas law firm looked at federal data over a five-year span between 2018 and 2022, concluding that SR 99 is the most dangerous highway in California, with 445 deaths (an average of 89 per year) over that five-year period.

==Route description==

SR 99 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System, and except for a small portion north of SR 20 is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country&#x27;s economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration.

===Wheeler Ridge to Sacramento===
From its southern terminus at I-5 in Wheeler Ridge (Wheeler Ridge Interchange) to Sacramento, SR 99 is designated as the Golden State Highway. It passes through the major cities of the San Joaquin Valley, including Bakersfield, Delano, Tulare, Visalia, Fresno, Madera, Merced, Modesto, and Stockton. The entirety of this segment is now built to freeway standards with complete access control, although some older portions are not yet in compliance with Interstate Highway standards. The freeway sections connect and serve the agriculture and industry of the California Central Valley, connecting agricultural production with processing and packing businesses. Most of the freeway also parallels the Union Pacific&#x27;s Fresno Subdivision.
The portion of the highway between Fresno and Madera has also been designated the 100th Infantry Battalion Memorial Highway, honoring the U.S. Army unit that was composed almost entirely with American soldiers of Japanese ancestry when it fought during World War II. Approximately north of Fresno in this segment, a palm tree and a pine tree (replaced with a cedar after storm damage in 2005) were planted in the median to mark the transition between Southern California (the palm) and Northern California (the pine), reputedly in the 1920s. The trees are to be removed in 2025 as part of widening the segment to six lanes, to be replaced by 15 pines and 15 palms to the west of the highway.

The portion between Salida and Manteca is designated the 442nd Regimental Combat Team Memorial Highway, honoring the US Army infantry regiment that, like the 100th Infantry Battalion, was also composed almost entirely of American soldiers of Japanese ancestry during World War II.

In Sacramento, SR 99 joins with I-80 Business as part of the Capital City Freeway, then runs concurrently with I-5. Caltrans route logs for SR 99 do not recognize these concurrencies and lists the route as having two segments. However, the highway is often shown with the concurrencies on maps, as a contiguous highway. Signage exists at the two Sacramento interchanges to direct traffic from one segment to the other.

===North Sacramento to Red Bluff===

SR 99 then splits from I-5 in northern Sacramento, and then heads along the eastern side of the Sacramento Valley through Yuba City, and Chico to its northern terminus at SR 36 near Red Bluff. SR 99 remains a four-lane freeway as the route leaves Sacramento County, but shortly reverts to a four-lane divided expressway as the highway crosses into Sutter County. As SR 99 reaches the junction of SR 70, the route turns northwest by north and becomes an undivided expressway with the exceptions of crossing the Feather River near Nicolaus and the interchange with SR 113, where the route then turns straight north to Yuba City.

As SR 99 crosses SR 20 at a signaled intersection, the highway becomes a four-lane freeway for before reverting to a two-lane road, passing the smaller towns of Live Oak, Fagan, and Gridley. SR 99 briefly is a local four-lane road through Gridley before continuing as a two-lane highway. SR 99 passes by the western side of the Thermalito Afterbay. SR 162 joins SR 99 for before splitting off east towards the northern end of the Thermalito Afterbay. SR 99 then transitions from a two-lane road to a four-lane divided expressway just before the interchange at SR 149 turning northwest and eventually a freeway entering the Chico city limits. As SR 99 leaves Chico, the highway reverts to a 2-lane road before crossing into Tehama County and passing through rural areas and the town of Los Molinos. The route then curves to the west and terminates at the junction with SR 36, approximately from I-5 in Red Bluff.

==History==

===From initial construction to U.S. Route 99===

The first state highway bond issue, approved by the state&#x27;s voters in 1910, included a north–south highway through the central part of the state consisting of Route 3 through the Sacramento Valley from the Oregon state line south to Sacramento, replacing the Siskiyou Trail, and Route 4 through the San Joaquin Valley from Sacramento to Los Angeles. In addition, a second route followed the west side of the Sacramento Valley, using Route 7 from Red Bluff south to Davis and the short Route 8 east along the proposed Yolo Causeway to Sacramento. North of Bakersfield these closely paralleled some of the main lines of the Southern Pacific Railroad, including the Fresno Line, East and West Valley lines, Shasta Line and Siskiyou Line.

By 1920 paving of both routes from Red Bluff to Los Angeles was completed or in progress, including the only mountain crossing south of Red Bluff, the Ridge Route just north of Los Angeles. To the north of Red Bluff, the road was being graded but had not yet been paved over the Siskiyou Mountains into Oregon. Paving was finally completed in mid-1933, when a new alignment (now SR 263) opened through the Shasta River Canyon.

The route from Davis to Oregon via Routes 7 and 3 came to be known as part of the Pacific Highway, an auto trail organized in 1910 to connect Canada and Mexico. The split in the Sacramento Valley was known as the East and West Side highways (the latter also carrying the Pacific Highway). South of Sacramento Route 4 was the Valley Route, but the San Joaquin Valley Tourist and Travel Association held a contest to rename it, selecting Golden State Highway as the winning entry in July 1927. To this day, &quot;Golden State Highway&quot; is SR 99&#x27;s default name in areas not given other names by the Legislature, and the name continues from its end at Wheeler Ridge on I-5 as the Golden State Freeway from there to downtown Los Angeles.

This north–south central highway became part of US 99 in 1926, as part of the new United States Numbered Highway System developed by the American Association of State Highway Officials (AASHO), though signs were not posted in California until 1928. US 99 also continued southeast from Los Angeles along a paved state highway, Route 9 and 26, to US 80 in El Centro. The paved county road south from El Centro to the Mexican border became a state highway in mid-1931, and part of US 99 in mid-1932.
In mid-1929, AASHO approved a split designation between Sacramento and Red Bluff, with US 99W replacing the original western route via Davis, and US 99E following the East Side Highway (Route 3) via Roseville. A short-lived split also existed between Manteca and Stockton in the early 1930s, with US 99E becoming the main route and US 99W becoming an extended SR 120 where not concurrent with US 50.

A third highway heading north from Sacramento was constructed by the Natomas Company in the 1910s for along the Sacramento River levee to provide access to land reclaimed and sold by the company. Sacramento and Sutter counties continued the road alongside the Sacramento River and Feather River to Nicolaus, where an existing county road crossed the river on a drawbridge and ran north to the East Side Highway at Yuba City. This continuous roadway between Sacramento and Yuba City was dedicated in October 1924 as the Garden Highway.

Parts of the present SR 99 alignment between Sacramento and Yuba City were added to the state highway system in 1933, when the legislature added Route 87 (Sign Route 24, later US 40 Alternate) from Woodland north past Yuba City to northwest of Oroville, and in 1949, with the creation of Route 232 (later Sign Route 24) between Sacramento and Marysville. The final piece became Route 245 (no signed number) in 1959, connecting Route 232 near Catlett with Route 87 near Tudor, and following the old Garden Highway across the Feather River to a point east of Tudor. Despite this combined route connecting the same cities as the Garden Highway, the only other piece of the old county road taken for the state highway was a short segment just north of Sacramento, carrying Route 232 between Jibboom Street and El Centro Road.

===As a state route===
When the Interstate Highway System was being planned in the 1950s, there were two proposals as to which way to route a freeway through the San Joaquin Valley. One was to upgrade US 99 to Interstate standards. The other proposed alternative was the West Side Freeway, which would bypass all the Central Valley communities and thus provide a faster and more direct north–south route through the state. The latter route was eventually chosen and ultimately became Interstate 5.

The implementation of the Interstate Highway System and the mid-1964 state highway renumbering ultimately sealed the fate of the U.S. Highway designation on US 99. The Interstates eventually replaced portions of US 99, causing it to be truncated at both of its ends.

US 99 was truncated to Los Angeles, with the old route south to Mexico becoming mainly I-10 and SR 86. At the same time Route 99 was defined legislatively to run from I-5 near Wheeler Ridge to Red Bluff, but it was only marked as SR 99 between Sacramento and Yuba City, since the remainder was still US 99 or US 99E. The southern end of US 99 was moved further north to Sacramento in late 1966 and SR 99 was extended to Wheeler Ridge; the rest of former US 99 to Los Angeles was either I-5 or the locally maintained San Fernando Road. Several years later US 99 and its branches were removed altogether from California, making SR 99 signage match the legislative definition; all of US 99W, and US 99 north of Red Bluff, remained as other routes (I-80, SR 113, and I-5), while US 99E between Roseville and Marysville became SR 65. By 1968, all US 99 signs were removed or replaced with SR 99 signs following the completion of I-5.

During the 20th century, Caltrans gradually widened Route 99 into a four-lane expressway for the length of the entire segment from Wheeler Ridge to Sacramento. The agency did not immediately upgrade Route 99 to a freeway, since the West Side Freeway had already been selected as the preferred alternative for north–south long-distance traffic. As traffic levels along the Route 99 corridor continued to increase, the at-grade intersections on the expressway became extremely dangerous. Drivers on cross-streets who needed to cross the expressway often had to wait for many minutes at those intersections to find suitable gaps in which to dart across heavy through traffic on Route 99 moving at near-freeway speeds. If drivers became impatient or mistimed the speed of through traffic, the result was often a dangerous side collision. Therefore, Caltrans upgraded or replaced those intersections one-by-one with freeway interchanges, and often added frontage roads for access to adjacent parcels. This work proceeded very slowly over several decades, as Caltrans needed to balance the rising level of danger at the rural intersections on Route 99 with other urgent construction priorities in California&#x27;s rapidly growing metropolitan areas.

By 2012, there was only one remaining expressway segment with at-grade intersections on Route 99 between Sacramento and Wheeler Ridge, in Merced County between the cities of Chowchilla and Atwater. On December 11, 2012, Caltrans commenced construction on a project to upgrade that segment to a six-lane freeway with full access control. On January 15, 2016, Caltrans officially opened the Plainsburg Road interchange, which completed the conversion of Route 99 south of Sacramento to a freeway built to near-interstate standards.

==Future==
Caltrans&#x27; long-range plans recommend that SR 99 be upgraded to Interstate Highway standards between its southern end and Sacramento, which would require upgrading some substandard sections. Caltrans once suggested the route could be designated as either I-7 or I-9, in accordance with the Interstate Highway System&#x27;s numbering standards (being just east of and parallel to I-5). However, the freeway is not currently part of the Interstate Highway system.
==Junction list==

































































































==Business loops==
===Bakersfield===
State Route 99 Business (SR 99 Bus.) in the city of Bakersfield follows Union Avenue and Golden State Avenue. Traveling north on SR 99, the business route begins at exit 11 (Union Avenue), and follows the original routing of US 99. Union Avenue is a rural, four-lane road for about until it enters Greenfield at Panama Road. From there, it continues north, passing by the Bakersfield Municipal Airport and the Kern County Fairgrounds. Union Avenue widens to six lanes at Ming Avenue, just a few miles before its intersection with SR 58. At the SR 58 junction, the designation SR 204 is added to the route. SR 99 Bus./SR 204 continues north on Union Avenue until the Union Avenue Y-intersection, where the designation heads northwest on Golden State Avenue. The route passes under SR 178 and over Chester Avenue at Garces Memorial Circle. At F Street, SR 99 Bus./SR 204 becomes a short four-lane freeway that terminates at SR 99 just before the Olive Drive exit.

<text>Richard James Oglesby (July 25, 1824April 24, 1899) was an American soldier and Republican politician from Illinois, who served three non-consecutive terms as Governor of Illinois (from 1865 to 1869, for ten days in 1873, and from 1885 to 1889) and as a United States Senator from Illinois (from 1873 to 1879), and earlier was a member of the Illinois Senate, elected in 1860. The town of Oglesby, Illinois, is named in his honor, as is an elementary school situated in the Auburn Gresham neighborhood of Chicago&#x27;s south side.

He served in the United States Army during the Mexican–American War of 1846–47, and after the war became a prospector during the California Gold Rush and was elected to the Illinois General Assembly. During the American Civil War, Oglesby volunteered for the Union Army and rose to the rank of major general, serving in the Western Theater; he left the army when he was elected Governor of Illinois in 1864.

==Early years==
Oglesby was born in Floydsburg, Oldham County, Kentucky. He was orphaned and moved to live with his uncle in Decatur, Illinois in 1836, where he worked as a farmhand and carpenter.

==Mexican–American War==
With the outbreak of the Mexican–American War, he enlisted as a 1st Lieutenant in Company C, 4th Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment taking part in the battles of Veracruz and Cerro Gordo &quot;where his regiment almost captured Mexican President General Santa Anna, but they had to settle for his cork leg, carriage and $20,000 in gold&quot;.

He might have participated in what may have been the first baseball game ever played outside the U.S., at the end of April 1847, a few days after the Battle of Cerro Gordo, &quot;with the wooden leg captured (by the Fourth Illinois regiment) from General Santa Anna&quot;.

==Entry into politics==
He studied at Louisville Law School in 1848, but traveled to California for the gold rush in 1849, where he tried his hand at gold mining. After two years of traveling in Europe, he returned to Illinois in 1851 Oglesby was one of the earliest advocates for Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s nomination as the 1860 presidential candidate of the Republican Party; it may have been he who applied the moniker &quot;Railsplitter&quot; to Lincoln.

==Civil War==

At the start of the Civil War, Oglesby was appointed colonel of the 8th Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment. He was a well-liked commander, receiving the moniker &quot;Uncle Dick&quot; from his troops. He commanded his brigade at the battles of Fort Henry and Fort Donelson and soon after was promoted to the rank of brigadier general. He commanded troops during the Siege of Corinth. Oglesby sustained severe injuries in the Battle of Corinth in 1862 and was elevated to the status of major general that same year.

After a brief period of recovery, Oglesby resumed military service in 1863. However, at the request of Abraham Lincoln, he abandoned his commission in 1864, successfully running for Illinois governor on the Republican ticket.

He was present in the room at the Petersen House when President Abraham Lincoln died on April 15, 1865.

==Illinois politics==

Oglesby first served as governor of Illinois from 1865 to 1869. During his tenure as governor, he advocated improving the quality of care of the mentally ill and for other groups of disabled citizens. He also signed legislation expanding the State Hospital system from one campus to three. After his term ended, he practiced law until 1872, when he agreed to a scheme in which Oglesby ran again for governor, but turned the office over to the lieutenant governor immediately after inauguration in return for a seat in the U.S. Senate. He served as a Senator from 1873 until 1879. In 1884, he was reelected governor for a third time, becoming the first man in Illinois history to serve three times as governor. At the end of his third term as governor, he tried unsuccessfully to be reelected to his Senate seat. He spent his remaining years in retirement and died at his &quot;Oglehurst&quot; estate in Elkhart, Illinois. He is buried there in Elkhart Cemetery. There is a statue of Richard J. Oglesby in Lincoln Park, Chicago.

His son, John G. Oglesby, was a two time Lieutenant Governor of Illinois.

<text>Rosehearty () is a settlement on the Moray Firth coast, four miles west of the town Fraserburgh, in the historical county of Aberdeenshire in Scotland. The burgh has a population of approximately 1,300 with about 25 per cent of pensionable age. 

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Rosehearty&quot; was documented in 1508 as Rossawarty and is derived from Gaelic &quot;ros&quot;, meaning &quot;cape, headland&quot;, and the personal name &quot;Abhartach&quot;.

== History ==
The settlement which is now Rosehearty was founded by a group of shipwrecked Danes in the 14th century. In 1424 the Fraser family built Pitsligo Castle a few hundred yards inland at Pitsligo; the castle was enlarged by the Forbes family in 1570. The remains of the castle are visible from Rosehearty.

Alexander Forbes, 1st Lord Forbes of Pitsligo re-founded the settlement to encourage fishing, on the condition he was given one-fifth of the catch. Rosehearty did not officially exist until it was granted a charter in the 1680s by King Charles II.

The town thrived from the fishing boom and, prior to the arrival of railways at the Broch, &quot;was set fit to rival it&quot;. Ultimately, however, the railway gave Fraserburgh the edge, and Rosehearty&#x27;s fishing industry ended.

== Geography ==
Rosehearty Beach forms a crescent shape stretching east from the harbour to a group of rocky outcrops. Several rock formations in the area are known as &quot;Long Craig&quot;, &quot;Hungry Hoy&quot;, &quot;The Pen&quot;, &quot;Mounsie Weat&quot;, &quot;Tamhead&quot;, &quot;Warey Craigs&quot; and &quot;Damar&quot;.

==Architecture==
The Lodging House, on the south side of the Square, was built in 1753 for the dowager Lady Pitsligo, while another old house, the &quot;Jam&quot;, bears the date 1573.

The Hill of Rosehearty Church, constructed in 1890, the work of Alexander Marshall Mackenzie, features a loft that was formerly installed in the church of Pitsligo in 1634. Described by Charles McKean as &quot;magnificent&quot;, it was later moved and installed in the Hill Church.

== Facilities ==
There is one shop, a hairdresser and two hotels in the village.

A new modern Rosehearty Primary School was built in 2007 and accommodates seven classrooms, an ICT computer suite and a games hall with retractable theatre seating and complementary acoustics and lighting. The school caters for approximately 140-160 pupils in total.

==Notable people==
Rosehearty is the birthplace of: 
* Hugh Mercer (1726–1777), British/American soldier and physician
* Sir Walter Murdoch (1874–1970), Australian essayist and academic
* Lawrence Ogilvie (1898–1980), plant pathologist

<doc id="758239" wikidata="Q2088786" url="?curid=758239" title="List of WWE Women's Champions (1956–2010)">
<text>The WWE Women&#x27;s Championship was a women&#x27;s professional wrestling championship in the World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) promotion. The championship was generally contested in professional wrestling matches, in which participants execute scripted finishes rather than contend in direct competition. Over the championship&#x27;s fifty-six year history, there were 59 recognized reigns between 29 recognized champions and 4 vacancies (there are 6 reigns and 3 people that are not recognized by the promotion). As recognized by WWE, the inaugural champion was The Fabulous Moolah, who won the title on September 18, 1956, which at that time was the NWA World Women&#x27;s Championship (which still exists today). While she was still champion, it became the WWF Women&#x27;s Championship in 1984.

In May 2002, after the WWF was renamed to WWE, the championship became the WWE Women&#x27;s Championship. At the start of the brand extension that began in March 2002, the Women&#x27;s Championship was defended on any brand until it became exclusive to Raw in September that year. It was the only women&#x27;s championship in the WWE until SmackDown created the WWE Divas Championship as a counterpart title in July 2008. The titles switched brands in April 2009. On September 19, 2010, at Night of Champions, the Women&#x27;s Championship was unified with the WWE Divas Championship, retiring the Women&#x27;s Championship.

The Fabulous Moolah&#x27;s first reign is the longest reign, and is officially recognized to be 10,129 days as part of her first reign, due to WWE not recognizing title changes between 1956 and 1984 (her first reign&#x27;s real number is 3,651 days). Moolah technically also is tied with Trish Stratus for the most reigns at 7, but since WWE does not recognize the title changes between 1956 and 1984, Moolah only has 4 reigns. Mickie James&#x27; third reign is the shortest at less than 1 hour. The Fabulous Moolah is the oldest champion, having won the title at 76 years old, while Wendi Richter is the youngest champion, winning the title at the age of 22. The final champion was Layla, in her first and only reign.

Only four women held the championship for a continuous reign of one year (365 days) or more: The Fabulous Moolah (who achieved the feat on six separate occasions), Sensational Sherri, Rockin&#x27; Robin, and Trish Stratus.

<doc id="758247" wikidata="Q1700111" url="?curid=758247" title="John Francis O'Hara">
<text>John Francis O&#x27;Hara (August 1, 1888 – August 28, 1960) was an American member of the Congregation of Holy Cross and prelate of the Catholic Church. He served as president of the University of Notre Dame (1934–1939) and as the Archbishop of Philadelphia from 1951 until his death, and was elevated to the cardinalate in 1958.

==Biography==

===Early life and education===
The fourth of ten children, O&#x27;Hara was born in Ann Arbor, Michigan, to John O&#x27;Hara and Ella Thornton. His father was a leader of the Irish American Catholic community, published a small newspaper and was active in Republican circles. 

He and his family moved to Bunker Hill, Indiana, two months after his birth, and later to Peru, Indiana, in 1889. He was attending Peru High School when, in 1905, his father was named by President Theodore Roosevelt as the United States consul to Uruguay. The family then moved to the South American country, where young John studied at the Catholic University of Uruguay in Montevideo and served as private secretary to Edward C. O&#x27;Brien, the United States Ambassador to Uruguay.

In 1906, O&#x27;Hara moved to Argentina and spent six months on a cattle ranch. Returning to Uruguay, he conducted market surveys for the United States Department of State. He furthered his studies, and then accompanied his father after the latter was transferred to Brazil.

Upon his return to the United States in 1908, O&#x27;Hara enrolled at the University of Notre Dame in Notre Dame, Indiana, where he also taught Spanish to defray the costs of tuition and board. In 1910, he became a founding officer of Notre Dame Knights of Columbus Council 1477, the first KofC College Council. After earning a bachelor&#x27;s degree and graduating in 1911, he entered the Congregation of Holy Cross on August 8, 1912. He then studied theology at Holy Cross College, South American history under Peter Guilday at the Catholic University of America, and at the Wharton School of Finance and Commerce of the University of Pennsylvania. He made his profession as a member of the Congregation of Holy Cross on September 14, 1914.

===Ordination and ministry===
O&#x27;Hara was ordained to the priesthood by Bishop Joseph Chartrand of Indianapolis on September 9, 1916. He then returned to his &quot;alma mater&quot; of Notre Dame, where he served as prefect of religion and dean of the College of Commerce. O&#x27;Hara greatly fostered the practice of daily reception of Communion, then still a newly approved practice by the Catholic Church. He made national headlines when he arranged for two Notre Dame football players, on their way to a game against West Point, to receive Communion in Albany, New York; the team has since had the opportunity to receive Communion on trips away. He served as the dean of the College of Commerce from 1921 to 1924.

===President of Notre Dame===
O&#x27;Hara was appointed the Vice President of the University of Notre Dame in 1933, and its president in 1934. During his tenure at Notre Dame, he brought numerous refugee intellectuals to campus; he selected Frank H. Spearman, Richard Reid, Jeremiah D. M. Ford, Irvin Abell, and Josephine Brownson for the prestigious Laetare Medal. President Franklin D. Roosevelt named him a delegate to the 1938 Pan-American Conference in Lima, and he was later invited by President Eleazar López Contreras to head a social service mission in Venezuela. O&#x27;Hara concentrated on expanding the graduate school. During his tenure, he made doctorates available in philosophy, physics, mathematics, and politics. O&#x27;Hara also carried forward the building program and led construction of a new laundry, the post office, and the infirmary. He also built the Rockne Memorial, Cavanaugh, Zahm and Breen-Phillips. 
O&#x27;Hara strongly believed that the Fighting Irish football team could be an effective means to &quot;acquaint the public with the ideals that dominate&quot; Notre Dame. He wrote, &quot;Notre Dame football is a spiritual service because it is played for the honor and glory of God and of his Blessed Mother. When St. Paul said: &#x27;Whether you eat or drink, or whatsoever else you do, do all for the glory of God,&#x27; he included football.&quot;

===Apostolic Delegate for the Military Forces===
On December 11, 1939, O&#x27;Hara was appointed by Pope Pius XII as an auxiliary bishop of the United States Military Ordinariate, which served the spiritual needs of the nation&#x27;s armed forces, as well as the titular bishop of &quot;Milasa&quot;. He received his consecration as a bishop on January 15, 1940, from Archbishop Francis Spellman, with Bishops John F. Noll and Joseph Ritter serving as co-consecrators, in Sacred Heart Church in Indiana. A devotee of the Blessed Virgin Mary, he selected as his episcopal motto: &quot;Following her, you will not go astray.&quot;

President Franklin D. Roosevelt later appointed O&#x27;Hara to the board of visitors of the Naval Academy in Annapolis, becoming the first Catholic bishop to be so honored.

===Bishop of Buffalo===
O&#x27;Hara was named the eighth bishop of Buffalo on March 10, 1945, and was installed on May 8 of that year. Succeeding the late John A. Duffy, O&#x27;Hara greatly expanded Catholic education in the diocese, and eliminated racial segregation in schools and churches. In 1946, during the American occupation following World War II, he and Michael J. Ready, the Bishop of Columbus, were sent to Japan to report on the condition of the Catholic Church in that country .

===Archbishop of Philadelphia===
O&#x27;Hara was promoted to the fifth Archbishop of Philadelphia on November 23, 1951. He received the pallium, a vestment worn by metropolitan bishops, from Cardinal Francis Spellman on May 12, 1953.

Differing in style from his predecessor, Cardinal Dennis Joseph Dougherty, he often answered his own doorbell, which he explained by saying &quot;How else can I meet the poor?&quot; During his tenure, O&#x27;Hara oversaw the establishment of sixty-one new schools, three women&#x27;s colleges, and special schools for the mentally challenged, blind, and deaf. Beginning in 1955, he also restored and expanded the Cathedral of Ss. Peter and Paul. He condemned the Supreme Court&#x27;s ruling against banning the films &quot;La Ronde&quot; and &quot;M&quot;. Moreover, not overly favorable of radio and television, he suggested that Catholics sacrifice such entertainment for Lent.

Pope John XXIII created O&#x27;Hara a Cardinal in the consistory of December 15, 1958, and appointed him a Cardinal-Priest with his titular church the Basilica of Ss. Andrea e Gregorio al Monte Celio. O&#x27;Hara was the first member of the Congregation of Holy Cross to be raised to the College of Cardinals. His health failing in his later years, he underwent several operations and took up to twenty-two different pills. O&#x27;Hara died following surgery in Philadelphia, at age 72. He is buried at the Basilica of the Sacred Heart in Notre Dame, Indiana.

==Legacy==
Cardinal O&#x27;Hara High School in Springfield, Pennsylvania, and Cardinal O&#x27;Hara High School in Tonawanda, New York, in the Diocese of Buffalo were named after the cardinal.

<text>Klucz is a part of the city of Szczecin, Poland, situated on the right bank of Oder river, in the southern part of the city.

The area became part of the emerging Polish state under its first ruler Mieszko I around 967, and following Poland&#x27;s fragmentation it formed part of the Duchy of Pomerania. During the Thirty Years&#x27; War, the settlement fell to the Swedish Empire. Later on, it passed to Prussia, and from 1871 to 1945 it was part of Germany, within which it was known as &quot;Klütz&quot;.

<doc id="758252" wikidata="Q1296751" url="?curid=758252" title="Muhammad I Tapar">
<text>Muhammad I Tapar (; 20 January 1082 – 18 April 1118), was the sultan of the Seljuk Empire from 1105 to 1118. He was a son of Malik-Shah I () and Taj al-Din Khatun Safariya.

==Reign==
Muhammad was born in 20 January 1082. He succeeded his nephew, Malik Shah II, as Seljuq Sultan in Baghdad, and thus was theoretically the head of the dynasty, although his brother Ahmad Sanjar in Khorasan held more practical power. Muhammad I probably allied himself with Radwan of Aleppo in the battle of the Khabur River against Kilij Arslan I, the sultan of Rüm, in 1107, in which the latter was defeated and killed. Following the internecine conflict with his half brother, Berkyaruq, he was given the title of &quot;malik&quot; and the provinces of Armenia and Azerbaijan. Dissatisfied by this he revolted again, but had to flee back to Armenia. By 1104, Berkyaruq, ill and tired of war, agreed to divide the sultanate with Muhammad. Muhammad became sole sultan following the death of Berkyaruq in 1105.

In 1106, Muhammad conquered the Ismaili fortress of Shahdiz, and ordered the Bavandid ruler Shahriyar IV to participate in his campaign against the Ismailis. Shahriyar, greatly angered by the message Muhammad sent him, refused to aid him against the Ismailis. Shortly after, Muhammad sent an army headed by Amir Chavli, who tried to capture Sari but was unexpectedly defeated by an army under Shahriyar and his son Qarin III. Muhammad then sent a letter, which requested Shahriyar to send one of his sons to the Seljuq court in Isfahan. He sent his son Ali I, who impressed Muhammad so much that he offered him his daughter in marriage, but Ali refused and told him to grant the honor to his brother and heir of the Bavand dynasty, Qarin III. Qarin III then went to the Isfahan court and married her.

In 1106/1107, Ahmad ibn Nizam al-Mulk, the son of the famous vizier Nizam al-Mulk, went to the court of Muhammad I to file a complaint against the rais (head) of Hamadan. When Ahmad arrived to the court, Muhammad I appointed him as his vizier, replacing Sa&#x27;d al-Mulk Abu&#x27;l-Mahasen Abi, who had been recently executed on suspicion of heresy. The appointment was due mainly to the reputation of Ahmad&#x27;s father. He was then given various titles which his father held (Qewam al-din, Sadr al-Islam and Nizam al-Mulk).

Muhammad I, along with his vizier Ahmad, later campaigned in Iraq, where they defeated and killed the Mazyadid ruler Sayf al-dawla Sadaqa ibn Mansur, who bore the title &quot;king of the Arabs&quot;. In 1109, Muhammad I sent Ahmad and Chavli Saqavu to capture the Ismaili fortresses of Alamut and Ostavand, but they failed to achieve any decisive result and withdrew. Ahmad was shortly replaced by Khatir al-Mulk Abu Mansur Maybudi as vizier of the Sejluq Empire. According to Ali ibn al-Athir (a historian who lived about a hundred years later), Ahmad then retired to a private life in Baghdad, but, according to the contemporary biographer, Anushirvan ibn Khalid, Muhammad I had Ahmad imprisoned for ten years.

Muhammad I died on 18 April 1118 and was succeeded by Mahmud II, although after Muhammad I&#x27;s death Sanjar was clearly the chief power in the Seljuq realms.

==Family==
One of Muhammad&#x27;s wives was Gawhar Khatun, the daughter of Isma&#x27;il, son of Yaquti. She was killed in 1118 on Muhammad&#x27;s order at his death in order to prevent his brother Sanjar from marrying her. Another wife was Qutlugh Khatun. Another wife was Shah Khatun Safiya. She was the mother of Saljuk-Shah. Another wife was Nisandar Jahan, also known as Sarjahan Khatun. She was the mother of Sultan Ghiyath ad-Din Mas&#x27;ud and Fatimah Khatun. After Muhammad&#x27;s death Mengubars, the governor of Iraq, married her. Their daughter Fatimah married Abbasid Caliph Al-Muqtafi in 1137, and died in September 1147. Another of his daughters married Arslan Shah I, son of Kirman Shah, and the grandson of Qavurt.

== Legacy and assessment ==
Muhammad was the last Seljuk ruler to have strong authority in the western part of the sultanate. The Seljuk realm was in a dire state after Muhammad&#x27;s death, according to bureaucrat and writer Anushirvan ibn Khalid (died in 1137/1139); &quot;In Muhammad&#x27;s reign the kingdom was united and secure from all envious attacks; but when it passed to his son Mahmud, they split up that unity and destroyed its cohesion. They claimed a share with him in the power and left him only a bare subsistence.&quot; Muhammad is mainly portrayed in a positive light by contemporary historians. According to the historian Imad ad-Din al-Isfahani (died in 1201), Muhammad was &quot;the perfect man of the Seljuk dynasty and their strongest steed&quot;.

Muhammad&#x27;s ceaseless campaigns inspired one of his poets, Iranshah, to compose the Persian epic poem of &quot;Bahman-nama&quot;, an Iranian mythological story about the constant battles between Kay Bahman and Rostam&#x27;s family. This implies that the work was also written to serve as advice for solving the socio-political issues of the time.

<text>Fernando Tambroni Armaroli (25 November 1901 – 18 February 1963) was an Italian politician. A member of Christian Democracy, he served as the 36th Prime Minister of Italy from March to July 1960. He also served as Minister of the Interior from July 1955 until February 1959, Minister of Budget and Treasury from February 1959 to March 1960, and Minister of the Merchant Navy from August 1953 until July 1955.

Despite having started his political career as a reformist and supporter of centre-left economic policies, while in government he became a right-wing, conservative politician, implementing law and order policies. Moreover, he was accused as Interior Minister of having created his own secret police to produce dossiers on his political opponents. His role as Prime Minister is best remembered for the riots which resulted from the possibility that he might look to the neo-fascist Italian Social Movement for support against the parliamentary left.

==Early life==
Tambroni was born in Ascoli Piceno, Marche, Kingdom of Italy, in 1901. His father, Arturo Tambroni, was the director of a youth re-educational institute, while her mother Amalia Laurenti was a housewife. After attending the classical lyceum, he studied law at the University of Macerata, where he graduated few years later. In those years he became a member of the Italian People&#x27;s Party (PPI), the Christian-democratic party led by Don Luigi Sturzo, of which he was appointed provincial secretary for Macerata. He served also as vice president of the Italian Catholic Federation of University Students (FUCI), under the presidency of Giuseppe Spataro.

===Fascist regime===
In November 1926, after the dissolution of the PPI imposed by the Fascist regime in Italy, Tambroni published an article on the &quot;Corriere Adriatico&quot;, in which he declared that he had &quot;abjured [his] previous political ideals&quot; and that he had become uninterested in any activity contrary to the fascist regime. He described Benito Mussolini as &quot;the man designated by the providence of God&quot;. After a few years, in 1932, he joined the National Fascist Party (PNF). Once the regime had fallen, he declared that he had not written the article willingly but had been forced to do so by PNF bosses&#x27; threats.

Tambroni entered the legal profession in 1923. He started out in the law firm of Augusto Giardini. During the 1920s, he became a rather well-known and appreciated criminal defense lawyer. In 1927, he welcomed his sister Rina, the second female lawyer in Ancona, as a colleague in the firm. After the war, Rina would take over the running of the firm. During these years, Tambroni married Mafalda Giacopelli. Two daughters were born to the couple: Maria Grazia and Gabriella.

The Second World War found Tambroni serving in the Voluntary Militia for National Security (MVSN), commonly known as the Blackshirts, the paramilitary wing of the PNF. His squad was an anti-aircraft battery in the Ancona area. Once the &quot;Duce&quot; had been overthrown in July 1943, Tambroni left the PNF and did not follow Mussolini in the Italian Social Republic, returning instead to more moderate political activity and contributing in December 1943 to the foundation of Christian Democracy (DC), the new centrist and Catholic party led by Alcide De Gasperi. Tambroni soon became one of the main DC figures in the Marche region.

==Political career==
In the 1946 Italian general election, he was elected in the Constituent Assembly of Italy for the constituency of Ancona–Pesaro–Macerata–Ascoli Piceno, receiving almost 20,500 votes. In the Constituent Assembly, he was appointed in the electoral commission and then in the 4th commission for bills&#x27; examination.

In the 1948 Italian general election, he was elected in the Chamber of Deputies with more than 45,000 votes. In these years, he became a vocal critic of De Gasperi&#x27;s policies, advocating for more incisive social reforms. Between June 1948 and January 1950, he served as vice-president of the public works commission of the Chamber, therefore, from January 1950 to July 1953, under-secretary of the Merchant Navy in the sixth and seventh governments chaired by Alcide De Gasperi.

===Minister of Merchant Navy===
In the 1953 Italian general election, the government coalition won 49.9% of national vote, just a few thousand votes of the threshold for a supermajority, resulting in an ordinary proportional distribution of the seats. Technically, the government won the election, winning a clear working majority of seats in both houses, but frustration with the failure to win a supermajority caused significant tensions in the leading coalition, which ended on 2 August, when De Gasperi was forced to resign by the Parliament. On 17 August, President Luigi Einaudi appointed Giuseppe Pella as new Prime Minister, while Tambroni became Minister of Merchant Navy. He would remain in office until July 1955, serving also in the governments of Amintore Fanfani and Mario Scelba.

As minister, he approved the so-called &quot;Tambroni law&quot;, which for the first time attempted to resolve the shipyards situation, with a 10 year concession of tax relief and state aids to encourage the reduction of production costs, promoting their competitiveness in the international market.

===Minister of the Interior===

In July 1955, the newly appointed Prime Minister, Antonio Segni, selected Tambroni as his Minister of the Interior. Tambroni would remain at the Viminale Palace until February 1959, serving also in the cabinets of Adone Zoli and Amintore Fanfani.

During his ministry, he was accused of using prefects in favor of the political interest of the government and his party. In 1956, he sent a confidential note to all Italian prefects inviting them to produce a report that not only illustrated the political ideals of the population, but also indicated measures that &quot;could be implemented before the 1957 local elections to favorably influence voters, with the aim of starting a more effective fight against communism. He also created an &quot;ad hoc&quot; office, with some of his close and trusted advisors. Politicians, militants and citizens with leftist sympathies and ideas ended up in these files, but dossiers were also opened on party comrades and politicians close to the DC, to have instruments of conditioning, if not blackmail, other politicians.

As minister, he organized the electoral campaign of the 1958 Italian general election. He also approved interventions on municipal laws and local finances, prepared plans for reforming public assistance and &quot;Protezione Civile&quot; law and reorganized the Vigili del Fuoco, the Italian firefighters corp. Tambroni authorized also the translation of Mussolini&#x27;s body in the family chapel in Predappio and dissolved the city council of Naples, earning the hostility of mayor Achille Lauro.

During these years, he was ranked among the main supporters of centre-left politics, becoming a close ally of Amintore Fanfani. In 1956, speaking at the party congress in Trento, he openly supported an alliance with the Italian Socialist Party (PSI), calling for an &quot;innovative government program&quot; and describing the centrist policies as &quot;absurd&quot;.

In January 1959, a conspicuous group of Christian Democrats started voting against their own government, forcing Fanfani to resign on 26 January 1959, after only six months in power. On 16 February, Antonio Segni sworn in as new Prime Minister and Tambroni was appointed Minister of Budget and Treasury.

==Prime Minister of Italy==
In March 1960, the Italian Liberal Party (PLI) withdrew its support to his government and Segni was forced to resign. President Giovanni Gronchi gave Tambroni the task of forming a new cabinet. Tambroni formed a one-party cabinet composed only by DC members, with the sole external support of the neo-fascist Italian Social Movement (MSI), a unique case in the history of the Italian Republic.

On 8 April, the Chamber of Deputies gave the confidence vote to government, with the fundamental support of the MSI. However, the neo-fascist vital supported created growing tensions within the DC and with some ministers who threatened their resignations, Tambroni was forced to resign. President Gronchi gave then the task of forming a new cabinet to Fanfani, to verify the possibility of starting a centre-left government. However, he was opposed by an important part of the DC, so Tambroni returned to the Senate, where he received the confidence vote on 29 April.

Tambroni listed among the main focus of his government&#x27;s program the institution of regions with a special statute for Friuli-Venezia Giulia, the reform of local finances, the modernization of public administration, a wide program of social and economic interventions, the reorganization of the state railways and a new foreign policy to improve bilateral relations with emerging countries like China, India and Arab countries.

Since the beginning, Tambroni&#x27;s premiership was characterised by a strong social conservatism on social issues, often pursued with authoritarian manners. On 21 May 1960, a rally led by Communist deputy Giancarlo Pajetta was broken up by the police with the total support from the government, causing riots. While on 15 June, the Minister of Culture, Umberto Tupini announced plans to censor all movies with &quot;scandalous subjects, harmful for the consciousness of Italians&quot;, including Federico Fellini&#x27;s &quot;La Dolce Vita&quot;.

===Anti-fascist riots===

The most controversial decision of his cabinet, was the permission to the MSI to hold its national congress in Genoa, one of the capitals of Italian Resistance against Fascism. This move was considered by the public opinion as a further and unacceptable opening to the neo-fascists, by the government.

On 30 June 1960, a large demonstration summoned by the left-wing CGIL trade union and by other leftist forces in the streets of Genoa was heavily suppressed by the Italian police. Other popular demonstrations in Reggio Emilia, Rome, Palermo, Catania, Licata again saw violent intervention by the police, causing several deaths. On 7 July, while news of the demonstrators killed in Reggio, Emilia arrived in the Chamber; Tambroni only spoke about &quot;unpleasant incidents&quot;, stating the government&#x27;s willingness was to do &quot;its duty to defend the state and the free institutions&quot;. Moreover, the interior minister, Giuseppe Spataro, accused the PCI of having stirred up the riots.

On 8 July, the political situation was so worrying that the President of the Senate, Cesare Merzagora, with an unprecedented practice and not informing the President of the Republic, proposed, finding support also in the President of the Chamber Giovanni Leone, a fifteen-day truce, with the return of the police to the barracks and the consequent stop of anti-fascist protests. This effectively delegitimized the actions of Tambroni and Spataro, and represented the beginning of the government crisis.

On 19 July, when many members of his own party, withdrew their supports to the government, Tambroni was forced to resign, after only 116 days in power.

==Death and legacy==
After his resignation, Tambroni&#x27;s political life was &quot;de facto&quot; concluded and he would never play a key role again. On 18 February 1963, Tambroni died in Rome due to cardiac arrest. A few days earlier, DC&#x27;s secretary Aldo Moro had informed him that he was going to be excluded from the party list in the 1963 Italian general election. On the following day, the newspaper &quot;La Stampa&quot; remembered him on the front page as &quot;a cold man with no cordiality. ... Tambroni had always been a loner, with very few really close friends, even when he reached the top of his political career&quot;.

Due to his authoritarian stances and his alliance with the neo-fascist MSI, Tambroni has often been regarded as one of the least appreciated Prime Ministers in the history of Italian Republic.

<doc id="758259" wikidata="Q455603" url="?curid=758259" title="Norio Ohga">
<text>, also spelled Norio Oga, was a Japanese businessperson who was the president and chairman of Sony Corporation. He is credited with spurring the development of the compact disc (CD) as a commercially viable audio format.

==Biography==

===Early career===
Ohga was born in Numazu, Shizuoka. When he was a child, he suffered tuberculosis that kept him in bed for a long time during which an acquaintance taught him physics and music. As a young man, Ohga aspired to be a professional opera singer, and went on to read at the prestigious Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music, graduating in 1953. 

His relationship with Sony began when he wrote a highly critical letter to Tokyo Tsushin Kogyo KK (also known as Totsuko and later as Sony), complaining about their tape recorder&#x27;s many failings, which got him noticed by Masaru Ibuka, Akio Morita and other Totsuko executives. Because of his insight into music and technology, the company hired him as a part-time consultant. 

Ohga went on to study music in Munich and Berlin, where he formed a friendship with the conductor Herbert von Karajan. 

Ohga&#x27;s knowledge of sound and electrical engineering continued to be an asset to Sony, which led to his appointments as executive director of Sony in 1964 at the age of 34 and president of CBS/Sony Records Inc. (currently Sony Music Entertainment Japan) in 1970, by the age of 40. These youthful appointments were unprecedented in the history of the Japanese company.

=== Later career ===
He was made the president of Sony in 1982, and the CEO of Sony in 1989. That same year, he purchased Columbia Pictures Entertainment (currently Sony Pictures Entertainment) from the Coca-Cola Company for $3.4 billion. A year earlier, Sony acquired the CBS Records Group (currently Sony Music Entertainment) from Columbia Broadcasting System. Ohga also played a key role in establishing Sony Computer Entertainment (currently Sony Interactive Entertainment) in 1993. He supported Ken Kutaragi to develop the PlayStation as a Sony-owned console.

In 1994, he succeeded co-founder Akio Morita as Sony chairman. The next year, he selected Nobuyuki Idei as the company&#x27;s next president, a decision he later told author John Nathan appalled 99 out of 100 people at the company, and it led to a sweeping reorganisation of the company. Idei became co-CEO with Ohga in 1998, and sole CEO in 1999. In 2000, Ohga became semi-retired, staying chairman of the board while Idei became Executive chairman. 

On November 7, 2001, Ohga collapsed onstage due to a cerebral hemorrhage while conducting an orchestra at the closing concert of the 4th Beijing Music Festival in Beijing. He later recovered his ability to speak and move after a three-month coma. 

On his 73rd birthday in 2003, Ohga retired from the board and became Honorary chairman. He served as chairman of the Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra. 

He died of multiple organ failure at a Tokyo hospital on April 23, 2011. He was 81 years old.

== Awards ==
His international recognition included the Japanese Medal of Honor with Blue Ribbon (1988), Grand Cordon of the Order of the Sacred Treasure (2001) and France&#x27;s Legion of Honour.

<text>East Oder () is the eastern arm of the lower Oder near Szczecin, Poland. It flows through Skośnica canal into West Oder and through Regalica into Dąbie Lake in the delta of the Oder river.

The river flows through the Lower Oder Valley forming, along with the Western Oder (), an area called Międzyodrze, part of the Lower Odra Valley Landscape Park. Międzyodrze area is traversed by a network of canals and old riverbeds, linked with East Oder. Between the split of Odra arms to the Regalica, East Oder runs through the Gryfino County.

<doc id="758267" wikidata="Q778792" url="?curid=758267" title="RSO Records">
<text>RSO Records was a record label formed by rock and roll and musical theatre impresario Robert Stigwood and record executive Al Coury in 1973. The letters &quot;RSO&quot; stood for the Robert Stigwood Organisation.

RSO managed the careers of several major acts, the Bee Gees, Yvonne Elliman, Cream, Eric Clapton, and Andy Gibb. The release of the soundtracks of &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; (over 50 million copies sold worldwide) and &quot;&quot; (over 30 million copies sold worldwide), which were two of the best selling albums ever, made RSO one of the most financially successful labels of the 1970s. Additionally, the record label released the soundtracks to &quot;Fame&quot;, &quot;Sparkle&quot;, &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;, &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, &quot;Times Square and&quot; &quot;Grease 2&quot;.

At one point in 1978, the label boasted an unprecedented six consecutive number-one singles on the &quot;Billboard&quot; (US) pop charts, holding the top spot for 21 consecutive weeks. With singles releases from the &quot;Grease&quot; soundtrack album (&quot;You&#x27;re the One That I Want&quot;, and the title track) and another Andy Gibb hit (&quot;Shadow Dancing&quot;), RSO logged a further 10 weeks at the number 1 position, giving the label a record nine in one calendar year. This feat remains unduplicated by any record label to date.

The company&#x27;s main headquarters were at 67 Brook Street, in London&#x27;s Mayfair. RSO Records underwent four distribution stages: by Atlantic Records from March 1973 to December 1975, by Polydor Records from January 1976 to December 1977, as an independent label under the PolyGram Group umbrella from January 1978 to around October 1981, and finally by PolyGram Records from around November 1981 until the label&#x27;s end in 1983.

As well as the label was operating in 1978, the disastrous commercial and critical failure of the &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; soundtrack album crippled the company. The woes of this failure were somewhat offset by the middle of 1979, as the Bee Gees album &quot;Spirits Having Flown&quot; went on to eventually sell over 30 million copies (with the album producing three further number 1 singles that each sold more than one million copies in their own right).

In 1980, the label&#x27;s most famous act, the Bee Gees, filed a $200 million lawsuit against both RSO and Stigwood, claiming mismanagement, which was met with Stigwood&#x27;s own $310 million countersuit alleging libel, defamation of character and extortion. It is still considered to be the largest successful lawsuit against a record company by an artist or group. The lawsuit was subsequently settled for an undisclosed amount, and after a public reconciliation, the band remained with the label until its dissolution.

By 1981, Stigwood had ended his involvement with the label, which was absorbed into PolyGram a few years later. All previous RSO releases were later re-released under the Polydor label, which is now owned by Universal Music Group. Reissues from Polydor are distributed in the U.S. by sister label Island Records.

The &quot;Star Wars&quot; soundtracks passed through several hands before ending up with Sony Classical in the 1990s, and finally, Walt Disney Records after Disney&#x27;s purchase of Lucasfilm Ltd. 
The Bee Gees catalog reverted to the Gibb family, who set up a new distribution arrangement with Warner Music&#x27;s Reprise Records, which reissued their albums and the &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; soundtrack until 2016, when the Bee Gees signed a new deal with Universal&#x27;s Capitol Records.

==Company logo==
Stigwood explained the inspiration for RSO Records&#x27;s akabeko logo in a 2001 interview for &quot;Billboard&quot;:

In the 1978 movie &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;, a similar logo of a pig, rather than a cow, was used as a logo of the fictional Big Deal Records label depicted in the film.

==Label variations==
During its existence, the styling of the RSO circular label changed as it changed its distribution partner.

* Atlantic - distributed label: Peach label with small logo
* Polydor - distributed label: Tan label with large logo, Polydor logo at bottom perimeter of label
* Independently distributed label: Tan label with larger logo
* PolyGram - distributed label: Silver label with large logo
* RSO Top Line - reissue label: White label with gold or silver star, very small logo at top of label between TOP and LINE

<text>The United World College of South East Asia (UWCSEA) is an independent international school in Singapore, and is a member of the United World College (UWC) movement which includes 18 schools worldwide. UWCSEA provides a K–12 education consisting of five interlinking elements: academics, activities, outdoor education, personal and social education, and service. The UWCSEA learning program leads to the IGCSE in Grades 9 and 10 and the IB Diploma in Grades 11 and 12. 

The school has two campuses, with around 3,000 students at the Dover Campus and 2,500 at the East Campus in Tampines. Most students participate in the service program, which involves service to the school community, the Singaporean community, as well as overseas communities.

UWCSEA is different from many of its sister colleges in the UWC movement, most of which are wholly boarding institutions that offer only a two-year International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme for mainly scholarship students of around 16–19 years of age. UWCSEA admits students from the age of 4, and the majority of students are children with parents who are expatriates or immigrants in Singapore. 

There are more than 300 boarders from 76 countries across both campuses, and there are over 100 students from 47 countries in grades 8-12 who are supported by scholarships. Singapore government policy prevents most citizens from attending international schools within the country, and therefore UWCSEA has the smallest percentage of local students of any UWC. There are 30 nationalities represented in the teaching staff, and there are 114 student nationalities.

== History ==
The site on which the Dover Campus now stands was previously occupied by St John&#x27;s School, run by the British Families Education Service for the families of British military personnel. After the British military withdrawal in 1971, the land was repurposed for the creation of a private school. The Singapore International School was officially opened in 1971 by Singapore&#x27;s Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew. 

It was affiliated with the United World College movement, and formally became a member of the movement in 1975, changing its name to the United World College of South East Asia. Originally a secondary-only school, UWCSEA Dover today has a primary section that takes students as young as 4 (starting 1998). The total number of students on the Dover Campus (Kindergarten 1 – Grade 12) is now 3,000+. UWCSEA&#x27;s East Campus opened its doors on 1 September 2008 in a transitional campus in Ang Mo Kio. The East Infant School moved to its permanent home at the Tampines campus in 2010, and the rest of the grades followed. As of 2021, both campuses have a combined student population of 5,609 students from 100 countries.

The Dover campus is one of a few remaining structures in Singapore that was constructed with bricks from the old Alexandra Brick Works, located at the current PSA building. This was confirmed by a student in 2013 during the demolition of the old “English” block, where hundreds of bricks stamped with “Alexandra” were found.

== Campuses ==
The UWCSEA Dover Campus is located at 1207 Dover Road, Singapore 139654 (). It is located near Dover MRT station, next to Anglo-Chinese School (Independent), and is a next-door neighbour to the British-based Dover Court International School. The UWCSEA East Campus is located at 1 Tampines Street 73, Singapore 528704 (). The nearest MRT station is Tampines MRT station.

Both campuses have a campus-wide wireless network and a central IT help desk for students. Interactive whiteboards are present in all classrooms. In Primary School, iPad, and MacBook sets are provisioned in classrooms, and in grades 6–12 laptops are individually owned.

===Academics===
Students from K1 to Grade 10 follow a UWCSEA-designed curriculum. A recent change moved away from the IGCSE program for Grade 9 and 10 students towards a newly UWCSEA-designed program specifically designed with the IBDP specifications in mind.

Grade 11 and 12 students study towards the IB Diploma.

===Activities===
An after-school activities program is offered from K1. The after-school activities program includes activities covering sports, arts (music, drama, visual art), leadership, clubs, and special interests. 
Sports available include athletics, badminton, basketball, climbing, cricket, cross country, football, gymnastics, hockey, netball, rugby, sailing, softball, swimming, tennis, touch and ultimate frisbee. 

There are also other activities like the Radical Math Club and Model UN. The Model UN program, at UWC East in particular – is the largest in South East Asia, and they organise two MUN conferences each year, with delegates flying in internationally. Other notable programs include SEASAC, an annual competition held between High School Students in South East Asia, Project 0, and the Student Council.

===Outdoor education===
The outdoor education program provides students from Grade 1 to Grade 12 with opportunities to develop their independence, teamwork, and resilience.

There is an annual compulsory trip from G1 to grade 10, with a self-designed &#x27;Project Week&#x27; in Grade 11 where small groups of students head to a destination of their choice.

===Personal and social education===
The personal and social education program aims to encourage learning, growth, and social development. Students explore how they are connecting to their learning, friends, family, technology, and the outside world.

The concepts covered are:
* individual well-being
* relationships and community (interpersonal) well-being
* student ability to engage with global issues (global well-being)

===Service===
Students in all grades participate in service projects. There are three categories of service:
* College, within the school community. Examples include peer support, ambassadors, student mentors, sports coaching, student and sports councils, and green campus initiatives.
* Local, within the Singapore community. Students work with groups such as the elderly, the sick, people with learning difficulties and/or physical disabilities, disadvantaged children, and domestic workers.
* Global, which covers:
** Global Concerns, a student-run and led program that partners with grassroots organizations outside Singapore. Students, parents, and staff to contribute to, visit, and see first-hand how the projects operate.
** Initiative for Peace, an action-based program that was founded by a group of students and teachers at UWCSEA in 2001. It offers UWCSEA students the opportunity to promote international understanding and reconciliation in areas of conflict, such as Timor Leste.
** Gap Year programs.

==Foundation==
The UWCSEA Foundation is the fundraising arm of the college. The foundation was established in 2008 and by 2015 had raised $12.4 million. The funds have supported initiatives including scholarships, teacher professional development and curriculum innovation, and environmental &amp; sustainability programs.

<text>West Oder () is the western arm of the lower Oder near Szczecin, Poland along the border with Germany. It flows into the Oder Lagoon.

The river flows through the Lower Oder Valley forming, along with the Eastern Oder (), an area called Międzyodrze, part of the Lower Odra Valley Landscape Park. Międzyodrze area is traversed by a network of canals and old riverbeds, linked with West Oder. Between the split of Odra arms to the Regalica, East Oder runs through the Gryfino County.

<text>Grabowo is a part and historical municipal neighbourhood of Szczecin, Poland, located in the north-central part of the city. It was merged with another historical neighbourhood (Drzetowo) and has formed present Drzetowo-Grabowo neighbourhood.

== History ==
The area became part of the emerging Polish state under its first ruler Mieszko I around 967, and following Poland&#x27;s fragmentation it formed part of the Duchy of Pomerania. During the Thirty Years&#x27; War, the settlement fell to the Swedish Empire. Later on, it passed to Prussia, and from 1871 to 1945 it was part of Germany, within which it was known as &quot;Grabow&quot;.

Later on, it passed to Prussia, and from 1871 to 1945 it was part of Germany, within which it was known as &quot;Stettin-Bredow&quot;, or just &quot;Bredow&quot;. Historically, when part of Germany, the Vulcan iron-works and shipbuilding yards were located here. The liners “Deutschland” (1900), the “Kaiserin Augusta Victoria” (1906), and the “George Washington” (1908), then the largest vessel — long, 27,000 tons — in the German mercantile marine, were built. There were also sugar, cement and other factories. Under Nazi Germany, in 1933, a concentration camp was established in the district.

<text>Valhalla is a Danish comic series, which offers a comedic view of the gods of Norse mythology. Originally commissioned for and published by Interpresse, it has been published by Carlsen Comics since 1978. In 1986, &quot;Valhalla&quot; was adapted into an animated feature film the studio A Film. On October 10, 2019, a more serious and dark live action adaptation was released.

==History==
During 1976 and 1977, Henning Kure and Arne Stenby at Interpresse, a Danish publishing house, were planning to create a comic series based on the world of the Vikings. They offered the place of illustrating the comic to the young cartoonist Peter Madsen, who accepted, and also enlisted Hans Rancke-Madsen. The team set out to draw the first album (similar format as &quot;Tintin&quot; and &quot;Asterix&quot;) in a series of the adventures of the Norse gods, based on the Elder Eddas. Thor would very much be the hero of this series, along with Odin and Loki.

Valhalla started in 1978 as a strip running in the Danish newspaper &quot;Politiken&quot;. The first collected album came out in 1979. It was very well received, with several subsequent albums.

The tone of the albums has focused on humor, but the characters, and much of the plot, are based on the stories and legends in the Elder Eddas, and many albums have often featured deeper human issues. The albums are of high quality, and each took one or more years to produce. The first album was released in 1979, the second in 1982, and the thirteenth in 2006. They are very much in the tradition of finely drawn and well plotted Franco-Belgian comics like &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; or &quot;Asterix&quot;, which also served as inspiration for the Valhalla comics.

On January 5, 2007, Valhalla was published on the Internet for the first time as the Danish paper Jyllands-Posten began publishing the 14th album, &quot;Muren&quot; (&quot;The Wall&quot;), in their online edition. One page was posted weekly in the form of an animated Flash program, in an attempt to transfer the large album pages to a format suitable for the web.

===Creative teams===
Valhalla would become the major breakthrough for illustrator Peter Madsen, who has developed greatly during his work on the series. Apart from doing the art for all the albums, he has been a co-writer for most of them. By far the most high-profile member of the creative team, the series is often referred to as &quot;Peter Madsen&#x27;s Valhalla&quot;.

Hans Rancke-Madsen has been the major writer of the series, together with Peter and other co-writers Per Vadmand and Henning Kure. Rancke-Madsen has written for all albums but eleven and twelve, but will return for the thirteenth album.

The colouring has always been a great part of the art of Valhalla. The first eight albums were coloured by Søren Håkonsson. Peter Madsen did the colours himself for the ninth album, while albums ten to twelve were done by Jesper Ejsing. Håkonsson returned for the thirteenth album, where he did half the pages, the other half being done by Madsen.

==Album titles and summaries==

&quot;All the individual albums that were originally published by Interpresse are now published by Carlsen Comics&quot;.

1. Ulven er Løs (&quot;Cry Wolf&quot;), &quot;Interpresse (1979)&quot;. Thor and Loki visit Midgard, the world of humans, and take on farmer&#x27;s children Þjálfi and Röskva as their servants. At their return to Valhalla, they find that the monstrous Fenris Wolf has escaped its bonds. A flashback tells the story of how Loki and Tyr brought the wolf to Valhalla. An educational edition of this comic received The Danish School Librarians&#x27; Association&#x27;s Children&#x27;s Book Prize in 1982.

2. Thors Brudefærd (&quot;Thor&#x27;s Wedding&quot;), &quot;Interpresse (1980)&quot;. Based on the Þrymskviða. The giant (jötunn) Þrymr has stolen Thor&#x27;s hammer Mjölnir, and will only return it in exchange for marrying the goddess Freyja. Thor and Loki have to dress up like Freyja and her maid to trick the giants and get the hammer back.

3. Odins Væddemål (&quot;Odin&#x27;s Wager&quot;), &quot;Interpresse (1982)&quot;. Odin is disappointed with the warriors the Valkyries bring for his army of Einherjar. He makes a wager with the Valkyries, that he can find better ones in Midgard by himself: three warriors that can best any and all of the Einherjar. The terms of the wager states that he is not allowed to use magic, and he therefore travels to Midgard personally. Odin remains gone for a long time, and rumor has it that he is dead, and his brothers Ve and Vili claim his throne. They change a lot of things in Asgard and become increasingly unpopular. They consolidate their power by stationing jötunn troops in Asgard. Meanwhile, Odin scouts Midgard to find the three warriors he needs. There are a lot of warriors but they all have some flaw: They are either too stupid, anti-authoritarian, Christian or about to get married. He finally finds three warriors called Fander, Hogur and Voldsdag who are indeed fierce warriors. He takes them back to Asgard where they defeat the jötnar, and dethrone Ve and Vili. To Odin&#x27;s great surprise, the three warriors turn out to be Balder, Thor and Loki in disguise. Odin argues that he has won the wager anyway because those three are the mightiest warriors in Asgard. The story is not based on any particular myth alone, it consists of bits and pieces from the Prose Edda, Heimskringla and other sources. Fander, Hogur and Voldsdag are based on Fandral, Hogun and Volstagg (Warriors Three) from Marvel Comics.

4. Historien om Quark (&quot;The Story of Quark&quot;), &quot;Interpresse (1987)&quot;. Loki returns from a visit to Utgard with a jötunn boy named Quark. The boy behaves horribly and becomes disliked by all the gods, Þjálfi and Röskva being the only ones he finally learns to like. (Quark isn&#x27;t based on any original Norse myths, but is an original creation of Peter Madsen.) The story continues in the next album.

5. Rejsen Til Udgårdsloke (&quot;The Journey to Útgarða-Loki&quot;), &quot;Interpresse (1989)&quot;. Thor, Loki, Þjálfi and Röskva travel to Utgard to have a competition with the jötnar led by Útgarða-Loki. The losers of the competition will have to keep Quark.

6. De Gyldne Æbler (&quot;The Golden Apples&quot;), &quot;Interpresse (1990)&quot;. Loki is forced to help the jötunn Thjazi kidnap Idun and her apples of eternal youth. As the gods grow old without the apples, Thor and Loki travel to bring back the apples from the jötunn and his beautiful daughter Skadi.

7. Ormen i Dybet (&quot;The Serpent in the Abyss&quot;), &quot;Carlsen Comics (1991)&quot;. An argument between Thor and Tyr leads them to see if either of them can catch the Midgård serpent that embraces the world. They travel to Utgard and stay with the giant Hymir, where Tyr is forced to face a past he would rather have forgotten. The comic was elected best comic album of 1992 at the Comics Mecca Convention, Ballerup, Denmark.

8. Frejas Smykke (&quot;Freya&#x27;s Necklace&quot;), &quot;Carlsen Comics (1992)&quot;. Freyja, the goddess of love, is bringing springtime to the worlds of men and gods. Odin plots to finally seduce her while Heimdall falls in love for the first time, and Loki gets caught in the middle of the trouble he starts between them all. The jewellery in the title is Brisingamen, and the story is originally a part of the Húsdrápa. The comic was chosen as the best foreign comic album of 1992 in Norway.

9. Den Store Udfordring (&quot;The Big Challenge&quot;), &quot;Carlsen Comics (1993)&quot;. A jötunn boy named Magni appears in Valhalla claiming to be Thor&#x27;s son. Odin is travelling Utgard, and makes a bet with the giant Hrungnir about whether Odin&#x27;s Sleipnir or the giant&#x27;s Guldfaxe is the faster horse. They race to Valhalla where Hrungnir proceeds to terrorise the gods. Thor challenges him to a duel, bringing Þjálfi and Magni along while the giants plot to kill Thor.

10. Gudernes Gaver (&quot;The Gifts for the Gods&quot;), &quot;Carlsen Comics (1997)&quot;. The story of how the young Thor and Sif met, and of how the young Loki was made to travel to the dwarven realm and brought back several fantastic gifts, most notably the hammer Mjølner.

11. Mysteriet om Digtermjøden (&quot;The Magic Mead&quot;), &quot;Carlsen Comics (1998)&quot;. Odin attempts to steal the special mead of poetry from the giants. We are told the story of how the tribes of the aesir and vanir gods made war back in the days, and of how they exchanged members to ensure the peace that was finally reached. The comic is a pastiche of Film Noir featuring Odin as the detective in what starts as a murder case. Peter Madsen won The SAS Prize for Best Nordic for this comic at the Raptus Festival in Bergen, Norway.

12. Gennem Ild og Vand (&quot;Through Fire and Water&quot;), &quot;Carlsen Comics (2001)&quot;. The story is an amalgamation of the Grímnismál and the Þórsdrápa. The human king Geirröd has allied with the jötnar and brought misery to his country. As Odin and Loki travel to his kingdom to see what is happening, Odin is captured, though Geirröd does not know who he has caught. Loki and Thor return in an attempt to free him.

13. Balladen om Balder (&quot;The Ballad of Baldr&quot;), &quot;Carlsen Comics (2006)&quot;. A rather free adaptation about the slaying of Baldr, based both on the accounts of the Poetic and Prose Edda, as well as Saxo Grammaticus&#x27; Gesta Danorum. Since Loki never had been really evil in any earlier books, he isn&#x27;t a deliberate perpetrator, here. In the afterword the authors explain and motivate this that out of the three accounts of the story, it is only in the Prose Edda that Loki actually has any hand in Baldr&#x27;s death. The goddess Hel makes her first and only appearance.

14. Muren (&quot;The Wall&quot;), &quot;Carlsen Comics (2007)&quot;. Mostly based on the myth of Skírnismál. It also includes the myth on how Loki gave birth to Sleipnir, appearing in the Prose Edda. It was released one page at a time on the online edition of the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten as of January 5, 2007.

15. Vølvens syner (&quot;The Sibyl&#x27;s Visions&quot;), &quot;Carlsen Comics (2009)&quot;. The final album in the series contains the story about how Surtr sets off Ragnarok. It was released in 2009.

The albums have also been collected in anthologies in some countries. All albums have been translated into Swedish and Norwegian with the earlier albums also translated into Dutch, German, French, Finnish, Icelandic, Faroese and Indonesian, so somebody who knows these languages or anyone a bit familiar with Norse Mythology can enjoy these renditions of the adventures of Thor and Loki.

==Animated film==

&quot;Valhalla&quot; was made into an animated film in 1986. The story is based on albums one, four and five, focusing on Tjalfe, Røskva and their meeting with Thor, Loki and Quark.

Although the film was in some ways a milestone for Scandinavian animation, it received mixed criticism. The production was hampered by trouble such as changes in the creative team and economic difficulties, and was passed on between studios to end up with Swan Film Production. In the end it cost nearly 30 million Danish kroner (approximately 5 million $), which it had no chance of bringing back in. No follow up to the film was made, although six short spin-off films, featuring Quark, were made by Swan Film Production. Quark is also the protagonist of his own comic series, of which several books have been published. Several more shorts were planned, but the studio collapsed from the troubles the Valhalla film had brought.

Several animators from the project later went together to found the studio A. Film A/S, one of the most successful animation studios in Scandinavia.

In 2003, the movie was released on DVD in Denmark.

==Stamp and playing cards==
In 2002 &quot;Post Danmark&quot; the Danish postal service made four stamps featuring Danish comic book characters. Peter Madsen drew the artwork for the Valhalla stamp and he also made a deck of playing cards with his characters. The other three stamps featured Rasmus Klump, Jungledyret Hugo and Cirkeline.

==Live action film==

In 2017, a live action adaptation of &quot;Valhalla&quot; was announced. It has been said to be serious and dark in tone, but generally follows the story of Tjalfe, Røskva, Thor, Loki and Quark once again, with more focus on Røskva than Tajlfe. A trailer has been released, then the film was released on October 10, 2019.

<text>Mughith al-Dunya wa&#x27;l-Din Mahmud bin Muhammad (b. 1104 – 11 September 1131) known as Mahmud II was the Seljuk sultan of Iraq from 1118–1131 following the death of his father Muhammad I Tapar. At the time Mahmud was fourteen, and ruled over Iraq and Persia.

== Biography ==
During Mahmud&#x27;s early reign, his vassal king Garshasp II, who was a favorite of his father Muhammad I, fell into disgrace. Slander about him spread to the court that made him lose confidence, and made Mahmud send a military force to Yazd where Garshasp was arrested and jailed in Jibal, while Yazd was granted to the royal cupbearer. Garshasp, however, escaped and returned to Yazd, where he requested protection from Mahmud&#x27;s rival Ahmad Sanjar (Garshasp&#x27;s wife was the sister of Ahmad). Garshasp urged Ahmad to invade the domains of Mahmud in Central Persia, and gave him information on how to march to Central Persia, and the ways to combat Mahmud. Ahmad accepted and advanced with an army to the west in 1119, where he together with &quot;five kings&quot; defeated Mahmud at Saveh. The kings who aided Ahmad during the battle were Garshasp II himself, the emirs of Sistan and of Khwarazm, and two other unnamed kings. After being victorious, Ahmad then restored the domains of Garshasp II.

Ahmad then proceeded as far as Baghdad, whereupon Mahmud was married to one of Sanjar&#x27;s daughters, made his uncle&#x27;s heir, and forced to give up strategic territories in northern Persia.

Mahmud&#x27;s younger brother Mas&#x27;ud revolted against him in 1120, but the civil war ended the following year due to the intervention of the atabeg of Mosul, Aqsunqur al-Bursuqi, and Mas&#x27;ud was pardoned. In 1126, al-Bursuqi was murdered by Assassins, believed have been under orders from Mahmud. In 1127, he appointed Anushirvan ibn Khalid as his vizier, but had him removed from the office the following year. In 1129 Mahmud officially recognized the authority of Imad al-Din Zengi, who had supported him against a revolt led by al-Mustarshid, caliph of Baghdad, in Syria and northern Iraq. Mahmud ruled from Isfahan, while his &quot;Shihna&quot; military governors for Iraq were based in Baghdad, except for a campaign which he led personally against the Caliph of Baghdad in 1126.

Mahmud, then aged 27, died on 11 September 1131. His death was followed by a civil war between his son Dawud, and his brothers Mas&#x27;ud, Suleiman-Shah, and Toghrul II. His other son Alp Arslan ibn Mahmud was ruler of Mosul under the protection of &quot;atabeg&quot; Zengi.

==Family==
In around 1116, Mahmud was bethrothed to his cousin Mah-i Mulk Khatun, also known as Mahd-i Maymun, the daughter of his uncle Sultan Ahmad Sanjar. The marriage took place in around 1119. Her dowry was portrayed as a precious treasure transported on elephants from Khurasan to Mahmud in Iraq. The two together had a son. In 1121, a fire consumed the palace that Mujahid al-Din Bahruz had built for Mahmud. The blaze resulted in Mah-i Mulk losing precious possessions, including jewels, ornaments, furnishings, and clothing. She died in 1122, after which Sanjar asked for the return of the gold and jewellery his daughter had, but Mahmud refused to give back the jewellery. In 1124, Sanjar sent another daughter, Amir Sitti Khatun, to be Mahmud&#x27;s wife. They had a daughter, Gawhar Nasab Khatun and a son, Malik-Shah III. She exercised great influence at Mahmud&#x27;s court and supported Mazyadid Dubays bin Sadaqa. In 1129, Vizier Abul-Qasim al-Anasabadhi, who was arrested by Mahmud, but was later freed by Sanjar was appointed as her vizier by Sanjar. She died in 1129. After her death Dubays&#x27; position fell apart. Another wife was Ata Khatun, the daughter of Garshasp II, the son of Ali ibn Faramurz and Arslan Khatun, the daughter of Chaghri Beg. They had a son Ala al-Daula Ata Khan. Another wife, who was the mother of Mahmud&#x27;s son, Alp Arslan, died while living at the residence of Aq Sunqur al-Bursuqi. According to Ann Lambton, Zahida Khatun, the wife of Atabeg Boz-aba was probably the mother of Mahmud&#x27;s son Muhammad. One of his concubines was the mother of his daughter Turkan Khatun, who married Sulaiman Shah, one of the great-grandsons of Qavurt. Some other daughters were Zinat Khatun and Zumurrud Khatun. His sons were Dawud, Malik-Shah III, Muhammad II, Alp Arslan, Farrukh Shah and Ala al-Daula Ata Khan.

<text>Victor Henri Rochefort, Marquis de Rochefort-Luçay (; 30 January 183130 June 1913) was a French writer of &quot;vaudevilles&quot; and politician. He was born in Paris and died in Aix-les-Bains.

==Life==

His father was a Legitimist noble who, as Edmond Rochefort, was well known as a writer of ; his mother&#x27;s views were republican. After experience as a medical student, a clerk at the &quot;Hôtel de Ville&quot; in Paris, a playwright and a journalist, he joined the staff of &quot;Le Figaro&quot; in 1863; but a series of his articles, afterwards published as &quot;Les Français de la décadence&quot; (3 vols., 1866–68), brought the paper into collision with the authorities and caused the termination of his engagement.
In collaboration with different dramatists he had meanwhile written a long series of successful vaudevilles, which began with the &quot;Monsieur bien mis&quot; at the &quot;Théâtre des Folies-Dramatiques&quot; in 1856. On leaving &quot;Le Figaro&quot; Rochefort determined to start a paper of his own, &quot;La Lanterne&quot;. The paper was seized on its eleventh appearance, and in August 1868 Rochefort was fined 10,000 francs, with a year&#x27;s imprisonment.

He then published his paper in Brussels, whence it was smuggled into France. Printed in French, English, Spanish, Italian and German, it went the round of Europe. After a second prosecution he fled to Belgium. A series of duels, of which the most famous was one fought with Paul de Cassagnac &quot;à propos&quot; of an article on Joan of Arc, kept Rochefort in the public eye.

In 1869, after two unsuccessful candidatures, he was returned to the Corps Législatif, (the then lower house of the French Parliament) by the first of Paris. He was arrested on the frontier, only to be almost immediately released, and forthwith took his seat.

He renewed his onslaught on the Empire, starting a new paper, &quot;La Marseillaise&quot;, as the organ of political meetings arranged by himself at &quot;La Villette&quot;. The staff was appointed on the votes of the members, and included Victor Noir and Paschal Grousset. The violent articles in this paper led to the duel which resulted in Victor Noir&#x27;s death at the hands of Prince Pierre Bonaparte. The paper was seized, and Rochefort and Grousset were sent to prison for six months.

The revolution of September was the signal for his release. He became a member of the Government of National Defence, but this short association with the forces of law and order was soon broken on account of his openly expressed sympathy with the Communards. On 11 May 1871, he fled in disguise from Paris. A week earlier he had resigned with a handful of other deputies from the National Assembly rather than countenance the dismemberment of France. Arrested at Meaux by the Versailles government, he was detained for some time in prison with a nervous illness before he was condemned under military law to imprisonment for life.

In spite of Victor Hugo&#x27;s efforts on his behalf, he was transported to New Caledonia. In 1874, he escaped on board an American vessel to San Francisco. He lived in London and Geneva until the general amnesty permitted his return to France in 1880. In Geneva, he resumed the publication of &quot;La Lanterne&quot;, and in the Parisian papers articles constantly appeared from his pen.
When at length, in 1880, the general amnesty permitted his return to Paris, he founded &quot;L&#x27;Intransigeant&quot; in the radical and socialist interest. For a short time in 1885–86 he sat in the Chamber of Deputies, but found a great opportunity next year for his talent for inflaming public opinion in the Boulangist agitation. He was condemned to detention in a fortress in August 1889 at the same time as General Boulanger, whom he had followed into exile. He continued his polemic from London, and after the suicide of General Boulanger he attacked M. Constans, minister of the interior in the Freycinet cabinet, with the utmost violence, in a series of articles which led to an interpellation in the chamber in circumstances of wild excitement and disorder.

The Panama scandals furnished him with another occasion, and he created something of a sensation by a statement in &quot;Le Figaro&quot; that he had met M. Clemenceau at the table of the financier Cornelius Herz. In 1895 he returned to Paris, two years before the Dreyfus affair supplied him with another . He became prominent among the anti-Dreyfusards along with people such as Edouard Drumont and Hubert-Joseph Henry, and had a principal share in the organization of the press campaign. Subsequently, he was editor of &quot;La Patrie&quot;. As a result of his journalistic descent, this aristocratic author is remembered today as &quot;the prince of press controversy&quot; ().

==Personal life==

Henri had a long-standing relationship with editor/translator Anna-Catherine Strebinger, whom he married in May 1878. Anna-Catherine is featured prominently as &quot;Catherine&quot; in Wanda von Sacher-Masoch&#x27;s memoir &quot;Confessions de Ma Vie&quot;. Catherine did translations of many of the works of Leopold von Sacher-Masoch. In her book, Wanda describes Catherine&#x27;s relationship with Henri as being open, with Catherine openly taking many lovers.

His daughter, Noémie de Rochefort-Luçay, was a lifelong friend of British suffragette leader Emmeline Pankhurst, having met whilst at École Normale de Neuilly in Paris. She later married Swiss artist Auguste Frederic Dufaux, known as Frederic, and had three children including aviation pioneers Henri Dufaux and Armand Dufaux. Henri Rochefort financially supported his grandson&#x27;s initial aeronautic experiments. Frederic Dufaux sculpted the bust for his father-in-law&#x27;s grave at the Montmartre cemetery in Paris.

==Works==
Besides his plays and articles in the journals Rochefort published several separate works, among them being:
*&quot;Les Petits Mystères de l&#x27;Hôtel des Ventes&quot; (1862), a collection of his art criticisms
*&quot;Les Dépravés&quot; (Geneva, 1882)
*&quot;Les Naufrageurs&quot; (1876)
*&quot;L&#x27;Évadé&quot; (1883)
*&quot;Napoléon dernier&quot; (3 vols., 1884)
*&quot;Les Aventures de ma vie&quot; (5 vols., 1896)

==Distinctions==
A street in the 17th arrondissement of Paris, Rue Henri Rochefort, is named after him.

<text>Jean Antoine Ernest Constans (3 May 1833 – 7 April 1913) was a French politician and colonial administrator.

==Biography==
Born in Béziers, Hérault, he began his career as professor of law. In 1876 he was elected deputy for Toulouse to the French Third Republic&#x27;s Chamber, and sat in the Left Centre as one of the 363 of 16 May 1877. Re-elected in October 1877, he joined Louis de Freycinet as Minister of the Interior in May 1880, holding this portfolio until November 1881. In 1887–1888, he was the first Governor-General of French Indochina. On 22 February 1889 he assumed the same office in Pierre Tirard&#x27;s cabinet.

He became prominent as a stalwart opponent of the Boulangist party, constituting the Senate as a high court of justice, and taking police measures against the &quot;Ligue des patriotes&quot;. He resigned on 1 March 1890 but his resignation involved the fall of the cabinet, and he resumed his portfolio in the Freycinet cabinet the same month.

On 29 December 1889 he was elected senator by the &quot;département&quot; of the Haute-Garonne. He was violently attacked by the press and the Boulangist deputies but did not resign until the whole cabinet withdrew, on 26 February 1892. In December 1898 he was appointed ambassador to the Ottoman Empire and remained in office until 1909. His attempt to join the Senate in 1912 was unsuccessful.
