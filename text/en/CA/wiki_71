<doc id="779575" wikidata="Q1735037" url="?curid=779575" title="Kaskinen">
<text>Kaskinen (; ) is a town and island in Finland, located on the west coast of the country. Kaskinen is situated in Ostrobothnia, along the Gulf of Bothnia. The population of Kaskinen approximately , while the sub-region has a population of approximately . It is the most populous municipality in Finland.

Kaskinen covers an area of (excluding sea areas) of which is inland water (). The population density is . 

Kaskinen is a bilingual municipality with Finnish and Swedish as its official languages. The population consists of Finnish speakers, Swedish speakers, and speakers of other languages, which is well above the national average.

Kaskinen is the smallest municipality in Finland with town status. The town is located on an island with two bridges to the mainland, and its only border neighbor is the town of Närpes. The townscape of Kaskinen consists of uniform wooden construction. Even though it is planned mainly as a port town, the also runs from the town to the to Seinäjoki. Today, however, the railway is only used for freight traffic, mainly for the Port of Kaskinen.

The paddle appearing in the coat of arms of Kaskinen describes the excellent natural harbor that has influenced the establishment of the town in its place. The laurel leaf may have been intended to refer to flowering, but its origin may also be in the name of the Bladh family (Swedish: &quot;blad&quot;, &quot;leaf&quot;); Two members of the family – father and son – acquired both city rights and township status for the village at that time. The coat of arms has been redrawn by A. W. Rancken (1880–1954) based on the old coat of arms, which was originally confirmed on 9 April 1793.

==Etymology==
The older name forms of Kaskinen island found in the documents are &quot;Kaskisöyen&quot; (1546), &quot;Casköö&quot; (1553), &quot;Kaskisöö&quot; (1573) and the later &quot;Kaskin&quot; or &quot;Kyperäsaari&quot; (1844). Although the oldest known written mention of the name Kaskinen for the town dates back to 1863, the name in Finnish is original. This is also indicated by the fact that in old Swedish island names, the body of the name is &quot;Kaskis&quot;-, to which the explanatory ending &quot;-ö&quot; has been added, which means island in Swedish. The most likely interpretation of the island&#x27;s original name is &quot;Kaskisaari&quot; (&quot;Slash-burn island&quot;), because the slash-and-burn agriculture has therefore been practiced on the island in the early days.

==History==
The town was founded in 1785 on an island by King Gustav III of Sweden and since then it has been one of the most important harbours of Finland. In the 18th century, a town plan with long, straight and wide streets was drawn up for the town, and the plan prepared for a clearly larger population; however, even today, there are still many undeveloped estates in the town, and the urban settlement hardly extends beyond the original zoned area.

The rise of the new town was slow in the 19th century, primarily due to poor transport connections. The bridge to the mainland was completed in 1828. As a maritime town, Kaskinen fell behind Kristinestad and Vaasa. Until the 19th century, fishing and trading were the most important livelihoods. During the heyday of the Finnish sailing fleet on both sides of the middle of the 19th century, especially tar and timber were exported from Kaskinen. The town&#x27;s merchant fleet was at its largest the size of 12 sailing ships. After the era of sailing ships, coastal traffic as well as freight and passenger traffic to Sweden was practiced in the town by steamships.

On 18 November 2019, Kaskinen and Närpes voted for a municipal merger, but Kaskinen&#x27;s town council voted 9–8 to reject the consolidation.

==Economy==
In 2015, there were 479 jobs in the municipality. 5,2% of them were in primary production (agriculture, forestry and fisheries), 39,7% in processing and 53,7% in services. The share of processing was higher than in the whole country (20%). In 2016, the companies that paid the most corporate tax were Oy Sonnfish Ab, Kuivaniemen Kala Oy and Kaskitek Oy.

The town includes the Port of Kaskinen, which deals with cargo transport.

==Demographics==
The following diagram shows the population development of the town every five years since 1990:

==Government==

At the end of 2017, Minna Nikander was elected the town manager of Kaskinen.

===Politics===
The two major parties in Kaskinen are SFP and SDP, which form the majority in elections and in the council. Below are the percentages of support for the parliamentary elections based on the votes cast in the most recent municipal elections:

*Swedish People&#x27;s Party 28.8%
*Social Democratic Party 27.0%
*True Finns 21.4%
*National Coalition Party 12.9%
*Left Alliance 6.7%
*Green League 3.0%

==Culture==
===Food===
&quot;Gubbe ronka&quot; or &quot;gubbe runka&quot;, mashed potato containing salted Baltic herring, served with mashed lingonberry and melted butter, was named as Kaskinen&#x27;s traditional parish dish in the 1980s.

<doc id="779580" wikidata="Q5242911" url="?curid=779580" title="Day of Al'Akbar">
<text>Day of Al&#x27;Akbar is an &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; adventure module written by Allen Hammack and published by TSR inc. in 1986. The module consists of a forty-page booklet with a large color map and an outer folder. It bears the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; code &quot;I9&quot;, &quot;I&quot; meaning &quot;intermediate&quot; and &quot;9&quot; for &quot;module 9&quot; in that series.

== Plot summary ==
The &quot;Day of Al&#x27;Akbar&quot; is an adventure scenario set in a once peaceful desert land reminiscent of the &quot;Arabian Nights&quot;. The module contains two distinct settings, &quot;Khaibar City&quot; and the &quot;Sultan&#x27;s palace&quot;.

Khaibar city is ruled by the bandit leader Al&#x27;Farzikh, and was once ruled by the sultan Al&#x27;Akbar. The people are at risk from a red plague, and the player characters are set on a quest to retrieve the magical artifacts that will save them. The scenario involves player characters searching the sewers underneath Khaibar to find the entrance that leads to the tomb of Al&#x27;Akbar, which contains the Cup and Talisman that they need.

The players&#x27; choices determine whether the search will involve wilderness encounters, a dungeon crawl through a sewer, tomb robbing, or investigating in a desert town, while the final confrontation takes place in the Sultan&#x27;s palace.

=== Table of contents ===
=== Notable non-player characters ===
* Al&#x27;Farzikh: 7th level assassin
* Vahtak: 6th level thief
* The Mad Dog of the Desert: 14th level Magic user/16th level assassin
* The Crescent Witch: 8th level Magic user

==Publication history==
&quot;Day of Al&#x27;Akbar&quot; was published by TSR inc. in 1986 as a 40-page booklet with a large color map and an outer folder. The game module was written and designed by Allen Hammack. Jeff Easley produced the cover art. The city map of Khaibar is A1 size.

The game module was developed by Bruce A. Heard and the adventure was illustrated by Mark Nelson. The map was drawn by Diane and David C. Sutherland III. Typesetting was done by Betty Elmore. The module was edited by Kerry Martin. The module was distributed to the book trade in the United States by Random House, Inc., in Canada by Random House of Canada, Ltd. and in the United Kingdom by TSR UK Ltd. The module&#x27;s product number was 9178.

== Reception ==
Tom Zunder reviewed &quot;Day of Al&#x27;Akbar&quot; for the British magazine, &quot;Adventurer&quot; in January 1987 (issue 6). He first commented on the cover, saying, &quot;Gary Gygax really must have left Lake Geneva at last [as Gygax] was really keen on the &#x27;family&#x27; image - and these playboy lasses on the front cover would certainly not have passed in the old days&quot;. He calls the city map of Khaibar, &quot;a wonderful bundle of colour&quot; and &quot;beautifully done, it has none of those annoying give-away labels, nor does it have the ugly grey squares which obliterated the Lhankmar map. A nice map, backed with useful hexes, and a good start to the package.&quot; He called the first three encounters on the trek to the city of Khaibar &quot;extremely silly and unnecessary&quot;, and the subsequent sewer dungeons &quot;so-so&quot;, but after that he found a &quot;well-detailed city with some real potential for role-playing&quot;. He concluded the review, stating the scenario is &quot;flawed, it doesn&#x27;t explain the city in the best way - as an overall. It presents good material in a depressingly linear dungeons-style [...] It is, however, an excellent scenario for &quot;AD&amp;D&quot;, providing plenty of excitement with a wonderful setting, well detailed and researched. The scenario is not at all bad, and a good referee could easily ignore it and just develop the setting itself, it&#x27;s certainly worth it. &quot;D&amp;D&quot;ers should buy this, others wouldn&#x27;t do badly in investing as well - not at all bad!&quot;

In March 1987, &quot;White Dwarf&quot; (issue 87), Carl Sargent noted that although the town map is moderately useful and the adventure&#x27;s Arabic environment is detailed enough, the module is overall an &quot;uninspired effort&quot;. He called the wilderness encounters pointless and silly and noted the existence of errors in the game statistics. Sargent felt that the only noteworthy thing about the module was Jeff Easley&#x27;s &quot;sexploitation cover&quot;.

<doc id="779584" wikidata="Q6009" url="?curid=779584" title="Kauhava">
<text>Kauhava is a town and municipality of Finland. It is part of the Southern Ostrobothnia region, northwest of Helsinki and by the main railway from Helsinki to Oulu. The town has a population of () and covers an area of of which is water. The population density is .

The popular amusement park, PowerPark, is located in Alahärmä, Kauhava.

The municipality is unilingually Finnish.

==Geography==
The surrounding country is flat and well suited to agriculture, alternating between fields and forests. The town probably takes its name from the small river which passes through it.

===Climate===

==History==
Kauhava was the home of the Finnish Training Air Wing from 1929 until the end of 2014.

The surrounding municipalities of Alahärmä, Kortesjärvi and Ylihärmä were consolidated with Kauhava on 1 January 2009.

==Knife making==
A traditional industry in Kauhava is knife making, and many Finns recognize the name of this small town because of knives made there. At one time, as many as five different knife-making enterprises were underway in the town, but today there is only one – Iisakki Järvenpää Oy, which has been making knives in Kauhava since 1879.

The puukko (one of the styles of Finnish knife) made in Kauhava are sometimes referred to as being in the Ostrobothnian style.

Each June sees the Kauhava International Knife Festival, lasting a couple of days and including knife exhibitions, knife making and knife throwing.

==Museums==
As with many Finnish localities, there are museums in Kauhava (Kauhava-Seura). One in the center of town features both the knifemaking tradition as well as the local textiles. An out-of-place fishing lure is one interesting feature of this museum. Another museum on the outskirts of Kauhava features the 19th century home and farm of Iisakin Jussi. It provides a view of late 19th century life in Western Finland. The Iisakin Jussi House is not open during the winter months.

<doc id="779586" wikidata="Q6142251" url="?curid=779586" title="James Robertson (Trotskyist)">
<text>James Robertson (1928–2019) was the long-time and founding National Chairman of the Spartacist League (US), the original national section of the International Communist League. In his later years, Robertson was consultative member of the ICL&#x27;s international executive committee.

== Biography ==
Born in 1928, Robertson joined the Communist Party in Richmond, California, in December 1946. He was active in its youth organization the American Youth for Democracy. While studying chemistry at the University of California at Berkeley, he left the CP to join Max Shachtman’s Workers Party shortly before it changed to the Independent Socialist League in May 1949. He was active in the WP/ISL’s youth organization, the Socialist Youth League, and its successor, the Young Socialist League (YSL).

Max Shachtman and his supporters then considered themselves Trotskyists, though they had broken with Trotsky’s Fourth International in 1940, abandoning the Trotskyist program of unconditional military defense of the USSR as World War II began. According to Robertson, the Workers Party gave up any perspective of reuniting with the Fourth International in 1948 and moved to the right under the pressure of the Cold War. Robertson fought what he considered this rightward course, co-authoring his first oppositional document in 1951. Along with Tim Wohlforth and Shane Mage, he was a leader of the Left Wing Caucus which developed in the YSL in early 1957 in opposition to Shachtman&#x27;s plan to liquidate the ISL into what had become the Socialist Party-Social Democratic Federation.

Under the impact of the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, members of the Left Wing Caucus became convinced that the Stalinist bureaucracy was not a new ruling “bureaucratic collectivist” class, as Shachtman had insisted, but instead a brittle and unstable caste, as Trotsky had argued. Wohlforth, Mage and Robertson launched the Young Socialist in October 1957 and founded the associated Young Socialist Clubs; they joined the Trotskyist Socialist Workers Party (SWP). In response to the formation of a Tibetan Brigade at the University of California at Berkeley in 1959, Robertson wrote a leaflet enthusiastically supporting the Chinese state’s suppression of what he considered to be a CIA-backed uprising in Tibet, reflecting the Young Socialist Clubs’ adoption of unconditional military defense of China, which they regarded as a deformed workers state, qualitatively similar to the USSR after it underwent its bureaucratic degeneration.

Robertson was a leader of the SWP’s youth group, the Young Socialist Alliance, when it was founded in 1960. Robertson, Mage and Wohlforth opposed what they considered to be an uncritical embrace of Fidel Castro by the SWP leadership, which declared Cuba to be a workers state on a par with the early USSR. Facing a hostile SWP leadership, they founded the Revolutionary Tendency (RT) in 1961. The majority of the RT—which went on to found the Spartacist League—came to regard Cuba, like China, as a deformed workers state, qualitatively similar to the degenerated USSR. The RT considered what they perceived as the SWP’s abandonment of a revolutionary perspective reflected not just in their uncritical support to Castro, but also in the party’s uncritical enthusing for the existing leadership of the civil rights movement. Robertson co-authored several of the tendency’s documents calling for the party to fight for Trotskyism in the civil rights movement.

The SWP was then a member of the International Committee of the Fourth International (IC), which organized the orthodox Trotskyists internationally, including the British Socialist Labour League led by Gerry Healy. The IC opposed the revisionist Trotskyists led by Michel Pablo, who were organized in the International Secretariat (IS). When the SWP declared its intention to reunify with the IS, the RT opposed this. Under Robertson’s leadership, the majority of the RT came to the conclusion that the SWP leadership had become centrist, but Tim Wohlforth, at the behest of Gerry Healy, split the tendency, claiming the SWP leadership could be won back to authentic Trotskyism. Wohlforth went on to lead Healy’s American organization (until he was purged in 1974).

The RT majority was expelled by the SWP beginning in December 1963, just as the SWP’s reunification with the International Secretariat was being consummated. Robertson was the editor of the journal &quot;Spartacist&quot;, which began publication in early 1964. Spartacist supporters looked at first to the IC, which was now under the leadership of Gerry Healy. However, Robertson’s experiences at the IC&#x27;s 1966 London conference led to a definitive break.

Robertson was elected founding national chairman of the Spartacist League/U.S. in 1966. When the international Spartacist tendency was formed in 1974, he was a member of its leading body and the author of the draft of its founding statement, &quot;Declaration for the Organizing of an International Trotskyist Tendency.&quot; The iSt changed its name to the International Communist League (Fourth Internationalist) in 1989. Robertson&#x27;s position as National Chairman of the Spartacist League/U.S. became consultative in 2004. He became a consultative member of the International Communist League’s executive committee in 2007. He died in April 2019 at the age of 90.

<text>Dynamical simulation, in computational physics, is the simulation of systems of objects that are free to move, usually in three dimensions according to Newton&#x27;s laws of classical dynamics, or approximations thereof. Dynamical simulation is used in computer animation to assist animators to produce realistic motion, in industrial design (for example to simulate crashes as an early step in crash testing), and in video games. Body movement is calculated using time integration methods.

==Physics engines==
In computer science, a program called a physics engine is used to model the behaviors of objects in space. These engines allow simulation of the way bodies of many types are affected by a variety of physical stimuli. They are also used to create dynamical simulations without having to know anything about physics. Physics engines are used throughout the video game and movie industry, but not all physics engines are alike. They are generally broken into real-time and the high precision, but these are not the only options. Most real-time physics engines are inaccurate and yield only the barest approximation of the real world, whereas most high-precision engines are far too slow for use in everyday applications.

To understand how these Physics engines are built, a basic understanding of physics is required. Physics engines are based on the actual behaviors of the world as described by classical mechanics. Engines do not typically account for non-classical mechanics (see theory of relativity and quantum mechanics) because most visualization deals with large bodies moving relatively slowly. The models used in dynamical simulations determine how accurate these simulations are.

==Formulation==
===Particle model===
The first model which may be used in physics engines governs the motion of infinitesimal objects with finite mass called “particles.” This equation, called Newton’s Second law (see Newton&#x27;s laws) or the definition of force, is the fundamental behavior governing all motion:

: formula_1

This equation allows us to fully model the behavior of particles, but it is not sufficient for most simulations because it does not account for the rotational motion of rigid bodies. This is the simplest model that can be used in a physics engine and was extensively used in early video games.

===Inertial model===
Bodies in the real world deform as forces are applied to them, so we call them “soft,” but often the deformation is negligibly small compared to the motion, and it is very complicated to model, so most physics engines ignore deformation. A body that is assumed to be non-deformable is called a rigid body. Rigid body dynamics deals with the motion of objects that cannot change shape, size, or mass but can change orientation and position.

To account for rotational energy and momentum, we must describe how force is applied to the object using a moment, and account for the mass distribution of the object using an inertia tensor. We describe these complex interactions with an equation somewhat similar to the definition of force above:

: formula_2

where formula_3 is the central inertia tensor, formula_4 is the angular velocity vector, and formula_5 is the moment of the &quot;j&quot;th external force about the mass center.

The inertia tensor describes the location of each particle of mass in a given object in relation to the object&#x27;s center of mass. This allows us to determine how an object will rotate dependent on the forces applied to it. This angular motion is quantified by the angular velocity vector.

As long as we stay below relativistic speeds (see Relativistic dynamics), this model will accurately simulate all relevant behavior. This method requires the Physics engine to solve six ordinary differential equations at every instant we want to render, which is a simple task for modern computers.

===Euler model===
The inertial model is much more complex than we typically need but it is the most simple to use. In this model, we do not need to change our forces or constrain our system. However, if we make a few intelligent changes to our system, simulation will become much easier, and our calculation time will decrease. The first constraint will be to put each torque in terms of the principal axes. This makes each torque much more difficult to program, but it simplifies our equations significantly. When we apply this constraint, we diagonalize the moment of inertia tensor, which simplifies our three equations into a special set of equations called Euler&#x27;s equations. These equations describe all rotational momentum in terms of the principal axes:

:formula_6

* The N terms are applied torques about the principal axes
* The I terms are the principal moments of inertia
* The formula_7 terms are angular velocities about the principal axes

The drawback to this model is that all the computation is on the front end, so it is still slower than we would like. The real usefulness is not apparent because it still relies on a system of non-linear differential equations. To alleviate this problem, we have to find a method that can remove the second term from the equation. This will allow us to integrate much more easily. The easiest way to do this is to assume a certain amount of symmetry.

===Symmetric/torque model===
The two types of symmetric objects that will simplify Euler&#x27;s equations are “symmetric tops” and “symmetric spheres.” The first assumes one degree of symmetry, this makes two of the I terms equal. These objects, like cylinders and tops, can be expressed with one very simple equation and two slightly simpler equations. This does not do us much good, because with one more symmetry we can get a large jump in speed with almost no change in appearance. The symmetric sphere makes all of the I terms equal (the Moment of inertia scalar), which makes all of these equations simple:

:formula_8

* The N terms are applied torques about the principal axes
* The formula_7 terms are angular velocities about the principal axes
* The I term is the scalar Moment of inertia:
:formula_10
:where
**V is the volume region of the object,
**&quot;r&quot; is the distance from the axis of rotation,
**&quot;m&quot; is mass,
**&quot;v&quot; is volume,
**ρ is the pointwise density function of the object,
**&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;z&quot; are the Cartesian coordinates.

These equations allow us to simulate the behavior of an object that can spin in a way very close to the method simulate motion without spin. This is a simple model but it is accurate enough to produce realistic output in real-time Dynamical simulations. It also allows a Physics engine to focus on the changing forces and torques rather than varying inertia.

==Multiple bodies==
Multibody simulation (MBS) is a method of numerical simulation in which multibody systems are composed of various rigid or elastic bodies. Connections between the bodies can be modeled with kinematic constraints (such as joints) or force elements (such as spring dampers). Unilateral constraints and Coulomb-friction can also be used to model frictional contacts between bodies.
Multibody simulation is a useful tool for conducting motion analysis. It is often used during product development to evaluate characteristics of comfort, safety, and performance. For example, multibody simulation has been widely used since the 1990s as a component of automotive suspension design. It can also be used to study issues of biomechanics, with applications including sports medicine, osteopathy, and human-machine interaction.

The heart of any multibody simulation software program is the solver. The solver is a set of computation algorithms that solve equations of motion. Types of components that can be studied through multibody simulation range from electronic control systems to noise, vibration and harshness. Complex models such as engines are composed of individually designed components, e.g. pistons and crankshafts.

The MBS process often can be divided in 5 main activities. The first activity of the MBS process chain is the &quot;3D CAD master model&quot;, in which product developers, designers and engineers are using the CAD system to generate a CAD model and its assembly structure related to given specifications. This 3D CAD master model is converted during the activity &quot;Data transfer&quot; to the MBS input data formats i.e. STEP. The &quot;MBS Modeling&quot; is the most complex activity in the process chain. Following rules and experiences, the 3D model in MBS format, multiple boundaries, kinematics, forces, moments or degrees of freedom are used as input to generate the MBS model. Engineers have to use MBS software and their knowledge and skills in the field of engineering mechanics and machine dynamics to build the MBS model including joints and links. The generated MBS model is used during the next activity &quot;Simulation&quot;. Simulations, which are specified by time increments and boundaries like starting conditions are run by MBS Software. It is also possible to perform MBS simulations using free and open source packages. The last activity is the &quot;Analysis and evaluation&quot;. Engineers use case-dependent directives to analyze and evaluate moving paths, speeds, accelerations, forces or moments. The results are used to enable releases or to improve the MBS model, in case the results are insufficient. One of the most important benefits of the MBS process chain is the usability of the results to optimize the 3D CAD master model components. Due to the fact that the process chain enables the optimization of component design, the resulting loops can be used to achieve a high level of design and MBS model optimization in an iterative process.

<doc id="779591" wikidata="Q313209" url="?curid=779591" title="Carlos Queiroz">
<text>Carlos Manuel Brito Leal de Queiroz (; born 1 March 1953) is a Portuguese football manager. He has served as the manager of his native Portugal&#x27;s national team, the United Arab Emirates, South Africa, Iran, Colombia, Egypt and Qatar, leading South Africa (2002), Portugal (2010) and Iran (2014, 2018, and 2022) to the FIFA World Cup. At club level, he has also managed Sporting CP, the New York/New Jersey Metrostars in Major League Soccer and Spanish club Real Madrid. He also had two spells as Alex Ferguson&#x27;s assistant manager at English club Manchester United.

Queiroz has won several awards as a coach at junior levels, and has been successful at senior and club levels, mainly as Alex Ferguson&#x27;s assistant manager. In 1998, he authored the &quot;Q-Report&quot;, which detailed plans to enhance footballer development in the United States.

Queiroz is the longest-serving manager in the history of the Iran national team, serving for almost eight years between 2011 and 2019. He returned to the role for Iran&#x27;s 2022 World Cup campaign. He is the only manager in the country&#x27;s history to lead them at three consecutive World Cups.

==Career==
Born in Nampula, Portuguese Mozambique, to Portuguese parents, Queiroz had an undistinguished professional career as a footballer, playing as a goalkeeper in Mozambique before turning to management. He moved to Portugal following Portugal&#x27;s Carnation Revolution on 25 April 1974, and Mozambique&#x27;s declaration of independence in 1975. Queiroz is a graduate of the University of Lisbon. He coached the Portuguese under-20 side to two FIFA World Youth Championship wins, in the 1989 and 1991 tournaments.

===Early senior career===
In 1984, Queiroz was appointed as assistant manager of Estoril-Praia. After that, Queiroz was appointed senior national team coach in 1991. He had a record of 14 wins in 31 matches. Afterwards, he went on to manage the Portuguese Primeira Divisão team Sporting CP in 1994.

He subsequently coached the NY/NJ MetroStars in the United States and the Japanese team, Nagoya Grampus Eight. In between, he found time to author the &quot;Q-Report&quot;, detailing plans to professionalize the development of footballers in the United States. Queiroz returned to coaching national teams in 1999, when he took the job as head coach of the United Arab Emirates, before becoming head coach of South Africa in 2000. Under Queiroz, South Africa qualified for the 2002 FIFA World Cup, but Queiroz resigned in March 2002 before the finals, after falling out with the South African Football Association. Queiroz was part of FIFA XI coaching staff, alongside Brazilian Carlos Alberto Parreira, in a humanitarian friendly match played in war-torn Sarajevo against Bosnia and Herzegovina on 25 April 2000.

Queiroz became a coach at English club Manchester United in June 2002. He began his work at the start of the 2002–03 season, working alongside Alex Ferguson, who had gone without an assistant manager since the departure of Steve McClaren in the middle of 2001.

===Real Madrid===
Queiroz&#x27;s position at Manchester United as assistant manager attracted the attention of Real Madrid, who wanted Queiroz as their manager to replace departing manager Vicente del Bosque in the summer of 2003. It was an opportunity to work with FIFA World Player of the Year award winners Zinedine Zidane, Ronaldo and Luís Figo, an opportunity that Queiroz felt unable to turn down. He was appointed on a two-year contract, only a week after the arrival of Manchester United player David Beckham. In the same summer, Real Madrid lost veteran defender Fernando Hierro, defensive midfielder Claude Makélélé and striker Fernando Morientes.

Real Madrid got off to a good start of the 2003–04 season, defeating Mallorca in the Supercopa de España. By mid-season, the team topped the La Liga table and was in contention for the Copa del Rey and the UEFA Champions League trophies. However, they lost their final five matches and finished in fourth place, with Valencia winning the title. They lost the Copa del Rey final to Real Zaragoza and were eliminated from the Champions League in the quarter-finals by Morientes&#x27;s new team Monaco, after a 4–2 first leg win, ending the season with the Supercopa de España as the only trophy won, the first time in five years without a major trophy. Following ten months at the Santiago Bernabéu, Queiroz was sacked in May 2004.

===Return to Manchester United===

Queiroz returned to United as Ferguson&#x27;s assistant in June 2004. Some sources noted the effect of his absence on the club&#x27;s 2003–04 season, in which they came third in the league and exited early from the Champions League.
In his 2014 autobiography, United captain Roy Keane stated that an argument with Queiroz about loyalty was one of the reasons why the Irishman quit the club in 2005. Keane said during ITV&#x27;s coverage of the 2018 FIFA World Cup that &quot;one of my big regrets is that I probably should have ripped his head off&quot;.

Queiroz was linked with managerial roles with Portuguese side Benfica and the United States national team in 2006, but he remained with Manchester United to help them win the Premier League in 2007. Queiroz was often seen conducting interviews with BBC programmes, such as &quot;Match of the Day&quot;, as at the time Alex Ferguson refused to speak with the BBC after allegations by the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Panorama&quot; programme that Ferguson&#x27;s younger son Jason and Portsmouth manager Harry Redknapp had been involved in corruption regarding cuts in transfer fees. Some of Queiroz&#x27;s post-match opinions on refereeing were controversial. For example, in 2008 Queiroz was – unsuccessfully – charged with improper conduct by the Football Association after describing referee Martin Atkinson&#x27;s performance in a match as &quot;a disgrace&quot;.

In late March 2008, it was reported that Benfica had, once again, approached Queiroz to become their manager and had made a formal request to Manchester United. United were heavily involved in the 2007–08 Premier League title race, five points clear at the top, with just seven games remaining, and also were still competing in the Champions League – being in the quarter-finals at the time of the enquiry. Queiroz did not make any public response to the approach.
Following Benfica&#x27;s approach, and amid rumors of an opening as the Portugal national coach, Ferguson started to push for Queiroz to be his successor as manager at Old Trafford and discouraged any possible suitors from approaching him. However, rumours over the summer of 2008 continued to link Queiroz with the Portugal national team managers&#x27; role, following the departure of Luiz Felipe Scolari. On 11 July 2008, Manchester United agreed to release Queiroz from his contract, and he was appointed manager for the Portugal national team.

===Portugal===
On 11 July 2008, it was announced that Queiroz was leaving Manchester United, having agreed to a four-year contract to become the head coach of the Portugal national team.

Portugal struggled under his management during the qualification for the 2010 World Cup. Despite kick-starting their World Cup qualification campaign with a comfortable 4–0 win against Malta in Ta&#x27; Qali, Queiroz&#x27;s team failed to win any of their subsequent four matches.

Home form was poor, with a 3–2 defeat to Denmark followed by 0–0 draws against Albania and Sweden. Together with another goalless draw in Stockholm against Sweden, these results left Portugal with only six points out of a possible 15 and on the brink of missing a major international tournament for the first time since 1998. Building on an improving reliability in defence, Portugal defeated Albania in Tirana 2–1 with a late goal, tied 1–1 against Denmark on 5 September, beat Hungary 1–0 and again 3–0 in the return match, and finally defeated Malta 4–0. These results, together with a defeat of Sweden to Denmark, enabled Portugal to finish the campaign second in the group with 19 points, one ahead of Sweden, and qualify for the UEFA play-offs. They played Bosnia and Herzegovina in home and away legs. Portugal won 1–0 in Lisbon and followed up with a 1–0 victory in Zenica, and as a result they advanced to the finals of the 2010 World Cup.

At the World Cup, Portugal drew 0–0 with the Ivory Coast but then beat North Korea 7–0, the heaviest victory in the World Cup since Germany&#x27;s 8–0 defeat of Saudi Arabia in 2002. This rout virtually guaranteed Portugal passage to the second round and a second goalless draw with Brazil confirmed qualification. In the second round, they lost to Spain 1–0 and were knocked out having failed to score in three of their four World Cup matches.

Quieroz was suspended for six months by the Portuguese Anti-Doping Authority (Autoridade Antidopagem de Portugal) on 30 August 2010, when he was judged to have disrupted their pre-World Cup procedures; he had been suspended for a month by the Portuguese Football Federation (FPF) for using inappropriate language towards the testers, a lesser charge that he admitted to. He was sacked by the FPF on 9 September. On 23 March 2011, the Court of Arbitration for Sport upheld his appeal against the Anti-Doping Authority, annulling his suspension.

===Iran===
On 4 April 2011, Queiroz agreed to a two-and-a-half-year deal to coach Iran until the end of the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, alongside goalkeeping coach Dan Gaspar and assistant coach Omid Namazi.

Since Queiroz&#x27;s role as manager of the Iran national team, he has been renowned for introducing players from the Iranian diaspora to the national squad. These players include German Iranians Daniel Davari and Ashkan Dejagah, Dutch Iranian Reza Ghoochannejhad, Swedish Iranians Omid Nazari and Saman Ghoddos, and Iranian American Steven Beitashour, among others.

====2014 World Cup====

Iran, under Queiroz, began their World Cup qualification campaign successfully, defeating the Maldives 4–0 in the first leg of their second round of qualifiers. After winning 5–0 on aggregate, Iran advanced to the third round of qualifiers, where they were drawn with Indonesia, Qatar and Bahrain. Iran highlighted their position at the top of their group by defeating Bahrain 6–0 at home in the Azadi Stadium, as well as inviting former German youth international, Ashkan Dejagah, who scored twice on his debut against Qatar. After a 4–1 win at Indonesia, Iran qualified for the final round of direct qualifiers, the fourth round.
In the fourth round, Iran were drawn with South Korea, Qatar, Uzbekistan, and Lebanon in their group. Queiroz made new foreign-based additions to his squad, adding players such as Reza Ghoochannejhad to his team. Iran started their fourth round of Asian qualifiers with a 1–0 win in Uzbekistan. &quot;Team Melli&quot; then drew Qatar and lost in Lebanon before defeating South Korea at the Azadi on 16 October with a goal from captain Javad Nekounam. After a 1–0 loss in Tehran against Uzbekistan, Iran defeated Qatar 1–0 in Doha and Lebanon 4–0 at home. In their last qualification match, Iran defeated South Korea 1–0 in Ulsan Munsu with a goal from European-based Ghoochannejhad, resulting in their qualification to the 2014 World Cup as group winners with 16 points. Thus, Iran became the third team that Queiroz managed to qualify for the World Cup, having reached the 2002 edition with South Africa and the 2010 edition with Portugal, leading the latter to a knockout stage finish.

Iran qualified for the 2014 World Cup as group winners and competed in Group F alongside Argentina, Nigeria, and Bosnia and Herzegovina. On 1 June 2014, Queiroz announced his 23-man squad. Prior to the tournament, they founded the Central Asian Football Association.

In the opening match of the tournament on 16 June, Iran drew Nigeria 0–0, making it their first clean sheet of the FIFA World Cup. In their next match, Iran was defeated by Argentina 1–0 with a late goal from Lionel Messi, and received praise after holding Argentina for 90 minutes while creating some attacking opportunities of their own. Iran was eliminated from the tournament in their next game, a 3–1 defeat to Bosnia and Herzegovina. Iran&#x27;s lone goal was scored by Reza Ghoochannejhad. Based on a &quot;Forbes&quot; report, his salary as an Iranian team manager was US$2,098,060 during the 2014 FIFA World Cup.

After the tournament, Queiroz extended his contract until the 2018 World Cup.

====2015 Asian Cup====

Iran continued their winning streak after 2014 World Cup qualification, securing qualification to the 2015 Asian Cup months later as the highest ranked seed. Iran qualified for the 2015 AFC Asian Cup as group winners, where they were the highest ranked seed. Iran faced Bahrain, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates in Group C.

With the second highest number of fans in the tournament after hosts Australia, the Iranians defeated Bahrain 2–0 with limited preparations. A defensive-minded Iran then defeated Qatar 1–0 thanks to a Sardar Azmoun goal before defeating the UAE by the same scoreline to reach the top of their group.

In the quarter-finals, Iran faced underdog Iraq, who they had beaten weeks prior in a friendly match. Having received a controversial red card in the first half from referee Ben Williams, Iran led a valiant effort with ten men, scoring two goals late in extra time to draw the match 3–3. In the ensuing penalty shootout, Iran lost 7–6 in sudden death.

====2018 World Cup====

Iran began their 2018 World Cup qualification campaign with friendly matches against Chile and Sweden in March 2015. Queiroz resigned from his managerial post thereafter due to disagreements with the Iranian Football Federation. On 14 April 2015, Iran were drawn with Oman, India, Turkmenistan, and Guam in the second round of qualifiers.

On 26 April, Queiroz announced that he would continue as the manager of Iran for their 2018 World Cup campaign. Iran ended their second round qualifying with a 4–0 victory against India and a 2–0 win against Oman. Iran finished top of the group with 20 points from eight games, Queiroz and his team managed to avoid defeat and remain unbeaten in the second round of World Cup qualifying. Iran was placed in Pot 1 alongside Australia for the draw of the third round of World Cup qualifying. They drew with South Korea, Uzbekistan, Qatar, China and Syria. With two games remaining, Iran qualified to the World Cup with defeating Uzbekistan at the Azadi Stadium. They became third team to qualify to the World Cup after host Russia and Brazil.

In April 2018, he was one of the applicants for the vacant Cameroon national team job.

After going undefeated in qualification, Iran beat Morocco 1–0 in their opening match of the tournament thanks to a late own goal from Aziz Bouhaddouz, but lost 1–0 to Spain in their second match. Their final match saw Queiroz come up against his home country, Portugal; after going 1–0 down, goalkeeper Alireza Beiranvand saved a penalty from Cristiano Ronaldo to give Iran hope, but they had to wait until injury time at the end of the second half for an equaliser from Karim Ansarifard. The draw might have been enough to see Iran into the knockout phase for the first time in their history at the expense of the Spaniards, but Spain&#x27;s injury-time equaliser in a 2–2 draw with Morocco meant they qualified with Portugal.

====2019 Asian Cup====
On 23 September 2018, Queiroz extended his contract until the 2019 AFC Asian Cup, hoping to win Iran&#x27;s first continental title since 1976. With wins over Yemen and Vietnam, and a draw with neighbours Iraq, Iran won Group D and progressed to the round of 16, where they met the third-placed team from Group F, Oman. A 2–0 win over Oman set up a quarter-final against China, whom they beat 3–0. However, in his 100th match in charge of Iran, the semi-final against Japan saw Queiroz&#x27;s team concede their first goals of the tournament, all in the second half, losing 3–0,the biggest ever defeat with 3 goals since 1988 asian cup. After the match, he left &quot;Team Melli&quot;.

===Colombia===
On 7 February 2019, Queiroz took over as the new manager of Colombia on a three-year contract. He was the only European and African coaching a South American national team, and was the fourth European manager to be in charge of the Colombian team after Friedrich Donnenfeld, Toza Veselinović and Blagoje Vidinić. His stint with Colombia began with the 2019 Copa América, where Colombia took first place with a perfect nine points, including a 2–0 win over Argentina. However, Colombia was knocked out by Chile in the last eight, where Colombia was saved with two goals for Chile being disallowed but failed bitterly in the penalty shootout.

Colombia also began the 2022 World Cup qualifiers with hope to make it their third in a row for the second time, and Colombia appeared to be on the right path where they beat neighbor Venezuela and held Chile. However, when matches resumed following the COVID-19 pandemic, Colombia&#x27;s performance slipped disastrously, with a 0–3 home loss to Uruguay (its worst ever home loss in 82 years) before being shockingly thrashed 1–6 by Ecuador, the biggest ever defeat, and this finally put the end to Carlos Queiroz&#x27;s reign as Colombia&#x27;s boss.

===Egypt===
On 8 September 2021, the Egyptian Football Association announced the signing of Carlos Queiroz to replace Hossam El Badry.

====2021 Africa Cup of Nations====
At the beginning of the tournament, the Egyptian team suffered a loss against its Nigerian team in the first round of Group D of the African Nations Cup. Egypt defeated Guinea Bissau with a goal scored by Mohamed Salah, giving Egypt the first victory in the second round of Group D. After that, Egypt defeated Sudan with a goal scored by Mohamed Abdel Moneim in the match, to raise the national team’s score to 6 points in the third round of Group D, and Egypt qualified for the round of 16. The Egyptian national team qualified for the quarter-finals by penalty shootout, after defeating Ivory Coast 5–4 in the round of 16. In the quarter-final match, Egypt won 2–1 against Morocco. In the semi-final match, Egypt qualified for the final by defeating the host nation Cameroon 3–1 on penalties. This win marked for the first-time ever Queiroz had guided a national team into the final of a competitive football tournament. However, Queiroz could not achieve the glory when Egypt lost to Senegal after penalty shootouts.

====2022 World Cup qualification====
Egypt qualified for the third round of the World Cup qualifications to face Senegal for a spot in the World Cup in Qatar. However, after a 1–0 win in Cairo, and a 1–0 loss in Dakar, Egypt lost again on penalties; hence, they failed to reach the final competition. He later agreed with the Egyptian Football Association to terminate his contract by mutual consent.

===Return to Iran===
On 7 September 2022, Queiroz was rehired for a second spell as Iran coach ahead of the 2022 FIFA World Cup, his third World Cup with the country. His appointment was promised as part of Mehdi Taj&#x27;s successful campaign for a second spell as president of the Football Federation Islamic Republic of Iran. At the World Cup in Qatar, Iran were eliminated in the group stage, following a 6–2 loss to England the biggest ever defeat at the history of world cup for Iran, a 2–0 win over Wales and a 1–0 defeat to the United States.

The World Cup took place for Iran amidst the backdrop of the Mahsa Amini protests. Queiroz said that his players had the right to protest as long as it conformed with the regulations of the tournament. He took issue with BBC reporter Shaimaa Khalil asking Iran player Mehdi Taremi for his opinion on the protests, and questioned her on whether she would ask the other teams in Iran&#x27;s group about the British and American withdrawal from Afghanistan.

=== Qatar ===
Queiroz was appointed manager of the Qatar national team in February 2023, succeeding Félix Sánchez, who led them at the 2022 FIFA World Cup which they hosted. He signed a contract until the 2026 World Cup.

On 6 December 2023, after twelve matches with Queiroz charge, consisting of four victories, three draws and four losses, the Qatar Football Association announced that his contract had been terminated by mutual agreement, and he had been replaced by Tintín Márquez.

==Controversy==
Prior to the final 2014 World Cup qualification match against South Korea, Queiroz was angered by the comment made from Choi Kang-hee, the head coach of South Korea, who complained that Iran did not provide the training facilities with sufficient qualities during South Korea&#x27;s away qualification match against Iran on 17 October 2012. Choi stated that South Korea would defeat Iran to help Uzbekistan qualify for the World Cup finals with South Korea, and that Iran would have to watch the World Cup on television. In response, Queiroz severely criticized Choi in his official comments and mocked him by wearing a T-shirt displaying Choi&#x27;s face.

After Iran&#x27;s victory against South Korea in their final qualification match, Queiroz showed his anger at the South Korean national coach with a raised fist gesture, which was deemed offensive by the South Korean players and staff, almost causing a fight between the two teams. As a result of the altercations, Sosha Makani was suspended for their opening match of the 2014 World Cup. Queiroz had answered previously to Choi that Iran had fairly shared what they had with the South Korean national team on their visit to Iran.

<doc id="779593" wikidata="Q7744047" url="?curid=779593" title="The Keep on the Borderlands">
<text>The Keep on the Borderlands is a &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; adventure module by Gary Gygax, first printed in December 1979. In it, player characters are based at a keep and investigate a nearby series of caves that are filled with a variety of monsters. It was designed to be used with the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons Basic Set&quot;, and was included in the 1979–1982 editions of the &quot;Basic Set&quot;. It was designed for people new to &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;.

&quot;The Keep on the Borderlands&quot; went out of print in the early 1980s, but has been reprinted twice; a sequel was also made. A novelized version of the adventure was published in 2001. The module received generally positive reviews, and was ranked the 7th greatest Dungeons &amp; Dragons adventure of all time by &quot;Dungeon&quot; magazine in 2004.

==Plot summary==
Player characters begin by arriving at the keep which they can adopt as a base before investigating the series of caverns in the nearby hills that are teeming with monsters. These Caves of Chaos house multiple species of vicious humanoids. Plot twists include a treacherous priest within the keep, hungry lizardmen in a nearby swamp, and a mad hermit in the wilderness. It typifies the dungeon crawls associated with beginning &quot;D&amp;D&quot; players, while permitting some limited outdoor adventures.

When &quot;The Grand Duchy of Karameikos&quot; edition of the Gazetteer series was published, the Keep was given a specific location in the Known World of Mystara, in the Altan Tepe Mountain region in northern Karameikos.

==Original publication==
&quot;The Keep on the Borderlands&quot; was published in 1980. It consists of a 32-page booklet with an outer folder; the module was written by Gary Gygax, with cover art by Jim Roslof and interior illustrations by Erol Otus. It is designed for use with the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons Basic Set&quot;. It was included in printings 6–11 (1979–1982) of the &quot;Basic Set&quot;, although it was also available for sale separately. The cover of the first printing included the notation, &quot;With minor modifications, it is also suitable for use with ADVANCED DUNGEONS &amp; DRAGONS&quot;; this was removed from later printings.

The module&#x27;s cover notes that it is especially designed to help beginning players and Dungeon Masters (DMs). Tips for running encounters appear throughout the text to assist beginning DMs. The module also provides rudimentary rules for wilderness adventures, as these were not included in the &quot;D&amp;D Basic Set&quot;. The structure of the adventure as a series of separate caves allows segmented playing sessions for beginners. The module has been described as a low-level introductory scenario, which leads the player characters from an outpost on the frontier of law into the forces of chaos.

Jon Peterson, for &quot;Polygon&quot;, highlighted that &quot;Keep on the Borderlands&quot; was created after &quot;sales of the &quot;Basic Set&quot; rose dramatically&quot; following the September 1979 disappearance of James Dallas Egbert III. The financial success of Mike Carr, writer of the previous module included in the boxed set, showed that &quot;a module like this [...] could bring significant income to its author&quot;. In early 1980, Carr&#x27;s module was replaced by Gygax&#x27;s in the &quot;Basic Set&quot;.

==Reception==
Anders Swenson reviewed &quot;The Keep on the Borderlands&quot; for &quot;Different Worlds&quot; magazine and stated that &quot;It is well balanced, and suitable for the levels of characters for which it was written. &quot;D&amp;D&quot; is a good introductory set of adventure gaming rules, and &quot;The Keep on the Borderland&quot; is a good introduction to &quot;D&amp;D&quot;.&quot;

Kirby T. Griffis, reviewing the adventure in &quot;The Space Gamer&quot; No. 37, found the module &quot;interesting and full of excitement&quot;, though he considered the map sloppily done. He concluded by stating &quot;on the whole, I enjoyed this module and recommend it.&quot;

Lawrence Schick, in his 1991 book &quot;Heroic Worlds&quot;, described the adventure as &quot;A good start for new players&quot; and speculated that at the time, &quot;There probably have been more copies of B2 printed than of any other role-playing scenario.&quot;

A retrospective review in &quot;Shadis&quot; #29 (1996) said that &quot;&quot;Keep on the Borderlands&quot; was designed with beginners in mind, and may seem quaint to experienced role-players. But that quaintness grows on you as you read through it, and the mix and match quality of the dungeon leaves an impression that&#x27;s hard to ignore. For a Basic D&amp;D nostalgia trip, there&#x27;s very little that can match it.&quot;

To commemorate the 30th anniversary of the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; game, Erik Mona and James Jacobs chose their Top Thirty Greatest &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; adventures of all time, and ranked &quot;The Keep on the Borderlands&quot; in 7th place.

Ken Denmead of &quot;Wired&quot; listed the module as one of the &quot;Top 10 D&amp;D Modules I Found in Storage This Weekend&quot;. According to Denmead, the module &quot;should give a party of low-levels a rather challenging time.&quot;

Writing for &quot;Black Gate&quot; in 2014, Scott Taylor listed the cover art of &quot;Keep on the Borderlands&quot; by Jim Roslof as #8 in The Top 10 TSR Cover Paintings of All Time.

Jon Peterson commented that &quot;Keep on the Borderlands&quot; is &quot;a classic, beloved module, whose Caves of Chaos owe no particular debt to Carr&#x27;s Caverns of Quasqueton, though much of Carr&#x27;s enlightening text about the art of dungeon mastering was effectively paraphrased in Gygax&#x27;s version. [...] Because &quot;Keep on the Borderlands&quot; would ship with the Moldvay &quot;Basic Set&quot;, at the height of the &quot;D&amp;D&quot; boom in 1981, it became one of the most widely known modules in &quot;D&amp;D&quot; history, selling 750,000 copies a year. It might never have served as the gateway to adventure for so many players if it hadn&#x27;t been for a certain legal dispute and its consequences&quot;.

The French RPG magazine &quot;La Gazette du Donjon&quot; gave this adventure a rating of 3 out of 5, saying, &quot;The fortified castle on the borders of the country is a very open introductory module in the sense that it gives free rein to the imagination of the players (and the dungeon master). The context of the castle can serve as a basis for many quests.&quot;

In his 2023 book &quot;Monsters, Aliens, and Holes in the Ground&quot;, RPG historian Stu Horvath noted that this adventure &quot;seems to be the culmination of design experiments that were taking place in the industry at large.&quot; Comparing &quot;Keep on the Borderlands&quot; to contemporaneous rival publications &quot;Tegel Manor&quot; and &quot;Snakepipe Hollow&quot;, Horvath called their simultaneous publications in the same year &quot;a moment of parallel innovation ... perhaps an inevitable destination for RPG design.&quot;

==Later versions and reprints==

=== 1984–2000 ===
The &quot;10th Anniversary Dungeons &amp; Dragons Collector&#x27;s Set&quot; boxed set published by TSR in 1984 included the rulebooks from the &quot;Basic&quot;, &quot;Expert&quot;, and &quot;Companion&quot; sets; modules AC2 &quot;Combat Shield and Mini-adventure&quot;, AC3 &quot;The Kidnapping of Princess Arelina&quot;, B1 &quot;In Search of the Unknown&quot;, &quot;The Keep on the Borderlands&quot;, and M1 &quot;Blizzard Pass&quot;; Player Character Record Sheets; and dice. The set was limited to a thousand copies, and was sold by mail and at GenCon 17.

&quot;The Keep on the Borderlands&quot; went out of print in the mid 1980s. However, the module was partially reprinted in the &quot;supermodule&quot; compilation B1–9 In Search of Adventure (1985), which included the Caves of Chaos but not the keep or surrounding wilderness. A reprinting of the original adventure was made available in the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons Silver Anniversary Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot; boxed set in 1999 to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; game, with slight modifications to make it distinguishable from the original (for collecting purposes).

A sequel was released in 1999, &quot;Return to the Keep on the Borderlands&quot; for 2nd edition &quot;AD&amp;D&quot;. The original B2 publication was generic in terms of setting, while the 1999 &quot;Return&quot; module placed the Keep in Yeomanry, making it a canonical location in the &quot;World of Greyhawk&quot;. The placement of the Keep in Greyhawk did not match many details in the sequel, such as several non-Greyhawk deities, nations, and peoples. At least two of the non-player character descriptions refer to details from the Mystara setting rather than Greyhawk.

=== 2000–2015 ===
In 2001, Wizards of the Coast published &quot;Keep on the Borderlands&quot;, a novelization by Ru Emerson for the Greyhawk Classics series. The novel was also set in the World of Greyhawk with scant references to its location.

A &quot;hacked&quot; version of the module was published for the &quot;HackMaster RPG&quot; in 2005, and entitled &quot;Little Keep on the Borderlands&quot;.

In September 2010, the module was re-released for D&amp;D 4th Edition by Wizards of the Coast for use in the weekly D&amp;D Encounters sessions as &quot;Keep on the Borderlands: A Season of Serpents&quot;. Like the original, this revised module was designed for use with the contemporaneously released &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons Fantasy Roleplaying Game&quot; boxed set for D&amp;D Essentials, which is oriented towards the beginning player. This time, &quot;The Keep on the Borderlands&quot; is set in the &quot;D&amp;D&quot; base world of the Nentir Vale, in an area known as the Chaos Scar. The module is &quot;a multi-week adventure as a set of individual encounters, each of which is meant to be run as a single session lasting 1.5 to 2 hours. [...] &#x27;Season of Serpents&#x27; is the longest Encounters season ever, with five chapters of four encounters each, resulting in 20 total sessions of play. Considerable effort is expended to differentiate the chapters and the overall play experience; thus, PCs adventure in broadly different areas during each chapter of play. Nonetheless, many GMs found the adventure too long—mainly because it made it hard to bring in new players late in the season, something that matters more in an organized play environment&quot;.

A revised edition was released at D&amp;D Expo in January 2012 under the title &quot;Caves of Chaos&quot; as playtest material for the upcoming 5th edition of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;. Players had to sign a non-disclosure agreement before playing the adventure.

=== 2015–present ===
In 2016, the Brazilian publisher &quot;Redbox Editora&quot; released a remake of &quot;The Keep on the Borderlands&quot; called &quot;O Forte das Terras Marginais&quot; for their own retro-clone system &quot;Old Dragon&quot;. The module was translated and adapted by Rafael Beltrame, chief editor of &quot;Old Dragon&quot;.

In March 2017 Mike Mearls, Mike Carr, and Chris Doyle announced that Goodman Games had entered a partnership with Wizards of the Coast to publish a collector&#x27;s edition of &quot;The Keep on the Borderland&quot; and &quot;In Search of the Unknown&quot;. In January 2018 Goodman Games announced that the hardback book would be 380 pages in length and contain digital scans of the originals, 5th Edition conversions, additional new content, and &quot;testimonials&quot;. The Goodman Games reprint entitled &quot;Into the Borderlands&quot; appeared in May 2018 as volume one of &quot;Original Adventures Reincarnated&quot;.

As part of the 2024 revision to the 5th Edition ruleset, a new starter set titled &quot;Heroes of the Borderlands&quot; is scheduled for release in 2025. It is inspired by the original &quot;Keep on the Borderlands&quot; and the set will include three booklets: &quot;Caves of Chaos&quot;, the &quot;Keep on the Borderlands&quot;, and the &quot;Wilderness&quot;.

==In video games==
&quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons Online&quot; released an adaptation of the &quot;Keep on the Borderlands&quot; adventures in 2019.

<text>AS-105 was the fifth and final orbital flight of a boilerplate Apollo spacecraft, and the third and final launch of a Pegasus micrometeoroid detection satellite. It was launched by SA-10, the tenth and final Saturn I rocket, in 1965.

== Overview ==
AS-105 was an Apollo boilerplate spacecraft; boilerplate BP-9A was used for the flight. The spacecraft reentered on November 22, 1975. The Saturn launch vehicle (SA-10) was similar to those of missions AS-103 and AS-104. As on the previous mission, the boilerplate service module was equipped with a test installation of a reaction control engine package.

The primary flight objective was to continue demonstration of the launch vehicle&#x27;s iterative guidance mode and evaluation of system accuracy.

== Launch ==
AS-105 was launched from Cape Kennedy Launch Complex 37B at 08:00 EST (13:00 GMT) on July 30, 1965, on the last Saturn I rocket, SA-10. A planned thirty-minute hold ensured that launch time coincided with the opening of the Pegasus launch window. The launch was normal and the payload was inserted into orbit approximately 10.7 minutes after lift-off. The total mass placed in orbit, including the spacecraft, Pegasus spacecraft, adapter, instrument unit, and S-IV stage, was 34,438 pounds (15,621 kg).

The spacecraft was separated 812 seconds after lift-off and the separation and ejection system operated as planned. The Pegasus 3 spacecraft, which was attached to the S-IV stage of the Saturn I and stowed inside the boilerplate service module, was deployed 40 seconds after command initiation at 872 seconds. Pegasus 3 was a 1423.6 kilogram (3138.6 pound) micrometeoroid detection satellite, which was bolted to the S-IV.

<text>The Lost Island of Castanamir (C3) is an adventure module written by Ken Rolston for the first edition of the &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; fantasy roleplaying game. The adventure was published in 1984 by TSR. As part of the C(ompetition)-series of modules &quot;The Lost Island of Castanamir&quot; contains material first used as a tournament adventure. The adventure is intended for five to eight characters of level 1-4.

==Plot summary==
In this scenario, the adventurers pass through magical portals into a series of interlinked chambers.

The characters are encouraged by a young scholarly mage to voyage into the Sea of Pastures, to explore a mysterious island connected with a number of recent shipwrecks and disappearances. The island is grassy and windblasted, but eventually the characters discover a stone door leading into a subterranean complex. There, they discover 18 rooms linked by secret passages and magical portals. Most of these rooms have been ransacked by a variety of other survivors, human and monstrous. These survivors are likewise trapped within the labyrinth and are either eking out a miserable existence there or else desperately searching for a means of escape.

Also within the building are a number of extraplanar creatures, collectively known as gingwatzim, who can shift between various forms: an energy form (glowing ball of light), an inanimate form (usually a magical weapon), and an animate form (an animal or monster). Eventually the characters may find the exit, and are once again deposited on the dreary islands to await rescue.

==Publication history==
C3 &quot;The Lost Island of Castanamir&quot; was written by Ken Rolston, with art by Jeff Easley, and was published by TSR in 1984 as a 32-page booklet with an outer folder.

The &quot;C&quot; in the module code represents the first letter in the word &quot;competition,&quot; the name of C1 - C6 module series.

==Reception==
Chris Hunter reviewed the module in &quot;Imagine&quot; magazine, giving it a mixed review. He wrote that, as a competition module, it is &quot;so tough that not everyone survives&quot; and thus when used with regular characters Hunter suggested the use of higher level characters. He described the module as disjointed and difficult to DM, as many encounters were not fully thought through by the designers. As this module introduces an &quot;interesting class of creatures&quot;, it could also have major long-term consequences for a campaign. According to Hunter, C3 is &quot;good buy&quot; for those looking for a competition module. However, he did not recommend it for an ongoing campaign.

Lawrence Schick, in his 1991 book &quot;Heroic Worlds&quot;, called &quot;The Lost Island of Castanamir&quot; &quot;a tricky competition module&quot;.

<text>Psychodrama is an action method, often used as a psychotherapy, in which clients use spontaneous dramatization, role playing, and dramatic self-presentation to investigate and gain insight into their lives. Developed by Jacob L. Moreno and his wife Zerka Toeman Moreno, psychodrama includes elements of theater, often conducted on a stage, or a space that serves as a stage area, where props can be used. A psychodrama therapy group, under the direction of a licensed psychodramatist, reenacts real-life, past situations (or inner mental processes), acting them out in present time. Participants then have the opportunity to evaluate their behavior, reflect on how the past incident is getting played out in the present and more deeply understand particular situations in their lives.

Psychodrama offers a creative way for an individual or group to explore and solve personal problems. It may be used in a variety of clinical and community-based settings in which other group members (audience) are invited to become therapeutic agents (stand-ins) to populate the scene of one client. Besides benefits to the designated client, &quot;side-benefits&quot; may accrue to other group members, as they make relevant connections and insights to their own lives from the psychodrama of another. A psychodrama is best conducted and produced by a person trained in the method, called a psychodrama director.

In a session of psychodrama, one client of the group becomes the protagonist, and focuses on a particular, personal, emotionally problematic situation to enact on stage. A variety of scenes may be enacted, depicting, for example, memories of specific happenings in the client&#x27;s past, unfinished situations, inner dramas, fantasies, dreams, preparations for future risk-taking situations, or unrehearsed expressions of mental states in the here and now. These scenes either approximate real-life situations or are externalizations of inner mental processes. Other members of the group may become auxiliaries and support the protagonist by playing other significant roles in the scene, or they may step in as a &quot;double&quot; who plays the role of the protagonist.

A core tenet of psychodrama is Moreno&#x27;s theory of &quot;spontaneity-creativity&quot;. Moreno believed that the best way for an individual to respond creatively to a situation is through spontaneity, that is, through a readiness to improvise and respond in the moment. By encouraging an individual to address a problem in a creative way, reacting spontaneously and based on impulse, they may begin to discover new solutions to problems in their lives and learn new roles they can inhabit within it. Moreno&#x27;s focus on spontaneous action within the psychodrama was developed in his Theatre of Spontaneity, which he directed in Vienna in the early 1920s. Disenchanted with the stagnancy he observed in conventional, scripted theatre, he found himself interested in the spontaneity required in improvisational work. He founded an improvisational troupe in the 1920s. This work in the theatre impacted the development of his psychodramatic theory.

==Methods==
In psychodrama, participants explore internal conflicts by acting out their emotions and interpersonal interactions on stage. A psychodrama session (typically 90 minutes to 2 hours) focuses principally on a single participant, known as the &quot;protagonist&quot;. Protagonists examine their relationships by interacting with the other actors and the leader, known as the &quot;director&quot;. This is done using specific techniques, including mirroring, doubling, soliloquy, and role reversal. The session is often broken up into three phases: the warm-up, the action, and the post-discussion.

During a typical psychodrama session, a number of clients gather together. One of these clients is chosen by the group as the protagonist, and the director calls on the other clients to assist the protagonist&#x27;s &quot;performance,&quot; either by portraying other characters, or by utilizing mirroring, doubling, or role reversal. The clients act out a number of scenes in order to allow the protagonist to work through certain scenarios. This is obviously beneficial for the protagonist, but also is helpful to the other group members, allowing them to assume the role of another person and apply that experience to their own life. The focus during the session is on the acting out of different scenarios, rather than simply talking through them. All of the different elements of the session (stage, props, lighting, etc.) are used to heighten the reality of the scene.

The three sections of a typical session are the warm-up, the action, and the sharing. During the warm-up, the actors are encouraged to enter into a state of mind where they can be present in and aware of the current moment and are free to be creative. This is done through the use of different ice-breaker games and activities. Next, the action section of the psychodrama session is the time in which the actual scenes themselves take place. Finally, in the post-discussion, the different actors are able to comment on the action, coming from their personal point of view, not as a critique, sharing their empathy and experiences with the protagonist of the scene.

The following are core psychodramatic techniques:

* Mirroring: The protagonist is first asked to act out an experience. After this, the client steps out of the scene and watches as another actor steps into their role and portrays them in the scene.

* Doubling: The job of the double is to make conscious any thoughts or feelings that another person is unable to express whether it is because of shyness, guilt, inhibition, politeness, fear, anger, etc. In many cases, the person is unaware of these thoughts or at least is unable to form the words to express how they are feeling. Therefore, the Double attempts to make conscious and give form to the unconscious and/or under expressed material. The person being doubled has the full right to disown any of the Double&#x27;s statements and to correct them as necessary. In this way, doubling itself can never be wrong.

* Role playing: The client portrays a person or object that is problematic to him or her.

* Soliloquy: The client speaks his or her thoughts aloud in order to build self-knowledge.

* Role reversal: The client is asked to portray another person while a second actor portrays the client in the particular scene. This not only prompts the client to think as the other person but also has some of the benefits of mirroring, as the client see themselves as portrayed by the second actor.

==Psychological applications==
Psychodrama can be used in both non-clinical and clinical arenas. In the non-clinical field, psychodrama is used in business, education, and professional training. In the clinical field, psychodrama may be used to alleviate the effects of emotional trauma and PTSD. One specific application in clinical situations is for people suffering from dysfunctional attachments. For this reason, it is often utilized in the treatment of children who have suffered emotional trauma and abuse. Using role-play and story telling, children may be able to express themselves emotionally and reveal truths about their experience they are not able to openly discuss with their therapist, and rehearse new ways of behavior. Moreno&#x27;s theory of child development offers further insight into psychodrama and children. Moreno suggested that child development is divided into four stages: finding personal identity (the double), recognizing oneself (the mirror stage), the auxiliary ego (finding the need to fit in), and recognizing the other person (the role-reversal stage). Mirroring, role-playing and other psychodramatic techniques are based on these stages. Moreno believed that psychodrama could be used to help individuals continue their emotional development through the use of these techniques.

==Related concepts==
=== Sociometry ===
Moreno&#x27;s term sociometry is often used in relation to psychodrama. By definition, sociometry is the study of social relations between individuals—interpersonal relationships. It is, more broadly, a set of ideas and practices that are focused on promoting spontaneity in human relations. Classically, sociometry involves techniques for identifying, organizing, and giving feedback on specific interpersonal preferences an individual has. For example, in a psychodrama session, allowing the group to decide whom the protagonist shall be employs sociometry.

Moreno is also credited for founding sociodrama. Though sociodrama, like psychodrama, utilizes the theatrical form as means of therapy, the terms are not synonymous. While psychodrama focuses on one patient within the group unit, sociodrama addresses the group as a whole. The goal is to explore social events, collective ideologies, and community patterns within a group in order to bring about positive change or transformation within the group dynamic. Moreno also believed that sociodrama could be used as a form of micro-sociology—that by examining the dynamic of a small group of individuals, patterns could be discovered that manifest themselves within the society as a whole, such as in Alcoholics Anonymous. Sociodrama can be divided into three main categories: crisis sociodrama, which deals with group responses after a catastrophic event, political sociodrama, which attempts to address stratification and inequality issues within a society, and diversity sociodrama, which considers conflicts based on prejudice, racism or stigmatization.

=== Drama therapy ===
The other creative arts therapies modality drama therapy, which was established and developed in the second half of the past century, shows multiple similarities in its approach to psychodrama, as to using theatre methods to achieve therapeutic goals. Both concepts however, describe different modalities. Drama therapy lets the patient explore fictional stories, such as fairytales, myths or improvised scenes, whereas psychodrama is focused on the patient&#x27;s real-life experience to practice &quot;new and more effective roles and behaviors&quot; (ASGPP).

==History==
Jacob L. Moreno (1889–1974) is the founder of psychodrama and sociometry, and one of the forerunners of the group psychotherapy movement. Around 1910, he developed the Theater of Spontaneity, which is based on the acting out of improvisational impulses. The focus of this exercise was not originally on the therapeutic effects of psychodrama; these were seen by Moreno to simply be positive side-effects.

A poem by Moreno reveals ideas central to the practice of psychodrama, and describes the purpose of mirroring:

In 1912, Moreno attended one of Sigmund Freud&#x27;s lectures. In his autobiography, he recalled the experience: &quot;As the students filed out, he singled me out from the crowd and asked me what I was doing. I responded, &#x27;Well, Dr. Freud, I start where you leave off. You meet people in the artificial setting of your office. I meet them on the street and in their homes, in their natural surroundings. You analyze their dreams. I give them the courage to dream again. You analyze and tear them apart. I let them act out their conflicting roles and help them to put the parts back together again.&#x27;&quot;

While a student at the University of Vienna in 1913–14, Moreno gathered a group of prostitutes as a way of discussing the social stigma and other problems they faced, starting what might be called the first &quot;support group&quot;. From experiences like that, and as inspired by psychoanalysts such as Wilhelm Reich and Freud, Moreno began to develop psychodrama. After moving to the United States in 1925, Moreno introduced his work with psychodrama to American psychologists. He began this work with children, and then eventually moved on to large group psychodrama sessions that he held at Impromptu Group Theatre at Carnegie Hall. These sessions established Moreno&#x27;s name, not only in psychological circles, but also among non-psychologists. Moreno continued to teach his method of psychodrama, leading sessions until his death in 1974.

From 1980, Hans-Werner Gessmann developed the Humanistic Psychodrama (HPD) at the Bergerhausen Psychotherapeutic Institute in Duisburg, Germany.
It is based on the human image of humanistic psychology All rules and methods follow the axioms of humanistic psychology. The HPD sees itself as development-oriented psychotherapy and has completely moved away from the psychoanalytic catharsist theory. Self-awareness and self-actualization are essential aspects in the therapeutic process. Subjective experiences, feelings and thoughts and one&#x27;s own experiences are the starting point for a change or reorientation in experience and behavior towards more self-acceptance and satisfaction. The examination of the biography of the individual is closely related to the sociometry of the group.

Another important practitioner in the field of psychodrama is Carl Hollander. Hollander was the 37th director certified by Moreno in psychodrama. He is known primarily for his creation of the Hollander Psychodrama Curve, which may be utilized as a way to understand how a psychodrama session is structured. Hollander uses the image of a curve to explain the three parts of a psychodrama session: the warm-up, the activity, and the integration. The warm-up exists to put patients into a place of spontaneity and creativity in order to be open in the act of psychodrama. The &quot;activity&quot; is the actual enactment of the psychodrama process. Finally, the &quot;curve&quot; moves to integration. It serves as closure and discussion of the session, and considers how the session can be brought into real life – a sort of debriefing.

Although psychodrama is not widely practiced, the work done by practitioners of psychodrama has opened the doors to research possibilities for other psychological concepts such as group therapy and expansion of the work of Sigmund Freud. The growing field of drama therapy utilizes psychodrama as one of its main elements. The methods of psychodrama are also used by group therapy organizations and also find a place in other types of therapy, such as post-divorce counseling for children.

<doc id="779610" wikidata="Q7973944" url="?curid=779610" title="Waterdeep and the North">
<text>Waterdeep and the North (product code FR1) is an accessory for the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; campaign setting &quot;Forgotten Realms&quot;. It was written by Ed Greenwood and published by TSR in 1987.

== Contents ==

&quot;Waterdeep and the North&quot; describes the region of northwestern Faerûn, known as &quot;The North&quot;, particularly its leading city and port, Waterdeep. The city of Waterdeep, an integral part of Ed Greenwood&#x27;s house campaign, is situated on the Sword Coast. With a population of over 100,000, it is the most important city in the north of the Forgotten Realms setting. The book provides a detailed description of Waterdeep, including its history, neighborhoods, defenses, sewers, guilds, political factions, noble families, and notable characters. The book also presents seven suggestions for adventure scenarios.

&quot;Waterdeep and the North&quot; comprises a 64-page book and a large color map of the city, wrapped in a removable six-paneled gatefold cover. The outside gatefold contains a map of Waterdeep, the inside front cover has a map of the city&#x27;s known sewers, and the inside back cover has diagrams of basic floorplans that might be found throughout the city.

The book presents a brief geographical overview of the city, followed by its history. The history section describes how Waterdeep was founded by local tribes who benefited from trading timber and furs with southern merchants, and how the settlement&#x27;s deep harbor gave the city its name. These were violent times: a savage human tribe captured the settlement and built defenses to fortify their new home. As tribes of humanoid monsters advanced on Waterdeep, more human tribes converged on the settlement, swelling its size and number of defenders. After savage battles, Waterdeep emerged as a free city ruled by war lords. The mage Ahghairon overthrew the last of the war lords and established a government based on wisdom instead of armed might, and he ruled the city with a group of masked lords who were secretly selected to govern. When Ahghairon died 200 years later, his rule was followed by a period of anarchy in which powerful guildmasters attempted to gain sole control of the city, but Ahghairon&#x27;s surviving fellow lords ultimately reestablished the rule of the lords.

The book describes the laws and customs of the city, as well as its various guilds and factions. The book concentrates on providing a feel for life in the city, and gives descriptions for only a small number its buildings in any great detail. The book does provide a look at the workings of the city, details on its noble families, outlines of its various wards, and details on the services available. The city&#x27;s guilds are detailed, including the locations of their headquarters, their livery, criteria for membership, and various interests and political connections. The book includes a number of NPCs of various levels and classes, all of whom can be used to interact with a band of adventurers as adversaries, friends, or people met during the daily routine of the city.

== Publication history ==

&quot;Waterdeep and the North&quot; (FR1) was written by Ed Greenwood, with cover art by Keith Parkinson, and interior illustrations by Chris Miller. It was published by TSR in 1987 as a 64-page booklet with a large color map and an outer folder. Editing was by Karen S. Martin, and the supplement features heraldic escutcheons by David E. Martin and cartography by Frey Graphics and David Sutherland. The &quot;City System&quot; product is intended as a companion to this volume.

According to Shannon Appelcline, &quot;Waterdeep and the North&quot; started off a long book series about the setting that helped make the Forgotten Realms &quot;the first TSR setting that was truly and exhaustively detailed – thanks to a line of sourcebooks, rather than just adventures.&quot;

== Reception ==

Jim Bambra reviewed &quot;Waterdeep and the North&quot; for &quot;Dragon&quot; magazine #140 (December 1988). Bambra wrote that the &quot;physical quality of this product is high, and color is used to good effect to show contour levels and sea depths&quot;, and that the book&#x27;s descriptions of Waterdeep give an idea of what life is like within its boundaries &quot;in an evocative manner which brings Waterdeep to life and makes it an ideal setting for urban adventures&quot;. He felt that the presentation of the North was less successful than that of Waterdeep, writing that while &quot;the history of the North is colorful, the descriptions of the various settlements are sketchy&quot;, and cited the absence of a wilderness map showing the relationship of the various settlements to Waterdeep and to each other. Bambra stated that although &quot;the section on the North is weak, the sections describing the City of Waterdeep are very strong&quot;, adding &quot;Waterdeep has a rich background which gives the city great character. The laws and customs of the city are colorfully presented, as are the various guilds and factions of the city.&quot; He commented on how few of the city&#x27;s buildings are detailed, which leaves that work up to the DM with the help of included tables and sample floor plans, and that the book instead provides &quot;a useful look at the workings of the city, outline descriptions of its various wards, and details on the services available&quot;. He wrote that the adventure outlines provided &quot;require a bit of work to bring them to life, but they provide a good cross section of the types of adventure available within the city&quot;. Bambra concluded by saying: &quot;With its emphasis on atmosphere and personalities, Waterdeep is a very strong city pack. It lacks any street encounter tables, which is a pity, as this would have added even more to the city&#x27;s feel and given PCs a better handle on life in the city. [...] As it stands, Waterdeep is a good urban location in which to base adventures in the Forgotten Realms setting. DMs will need to add to the provided information to personalize the city and breath life into its daily routines, but the background is provided and contains plenty of ideas just waiting to be developed.&quot;

In his review for &quot;City System&quot; in &quot;Dragon&quot; magazine #156 (April 1990), Ken Rolston also comments on &quot;Waterdeep and the North&quot;. He felt that &quot;Waterdeep and the North&quot; &quot;presents a Forgotten Realms city on a vast scale—too vast a scale for my liking&quot;. He felt that anyone who owns and enjoys &quot;Waterdeep and the North&quot; ought to have &quot;City System&quot; as well, but that if a player had to choose between &quot;Waterdeep and the North&quot; and the more expensive &quot;City System&quot;, &quot;by all means the former is the better deal, and all you really need; &quot;City System&quot; is only a big, colorful, and unnecessary secondary accessory to &quot;Waterdeep and the North&quot;&quot;.

<doc id="779622" wikidata="Q7763128" url="?curid=779622" title="The Secret of Bone Hill">
<text>The Secret of Bone Hill is an adventure module written by Lenard Lakofka for the first edition of &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; and published by TSR in 1981. It is designed for novice and intermediate players with characters of levels 2-4. The module received mixed reviews from critics.

==Plot summary==
The module is described as a low-level adventure scenario that involves evil creatures roaming the unexplored areas of Bone Hill. The campaign setting and scenario featured in the book detail a complete town in the Lendore Isles, along with nearby monster lairs. The player characters adventure in and around the fishing port of Restenford. The module is more of a mini-setting than an adventure, offering several adventure locations, and may require a Dungeon Master to expand it using the &quot;World of Greyhawk&quot; milieu. The module expands upon the basic types of undead creatures found.

==Publication history==

&quot;The Secret of Bone Hill&quot; was written by Len Lakofka and published by TSR in 1981 as a 32-page booklet with an outer folder, and a cover illustration by Bill Willingham. This adventure is continued in L2: &quot;The Assassin&#x27;s Knot&quot;, and L3: &quot;Deep Dwarven Delve&quot;.

==Reception==
The module was reviewed in issue No. 16 of &quot;Different Worlds&quot; magazine, which complained that TSR had abandoned its tradition of using maps as color art &quot;in favor of pretty pictures irrelevant to the text&quot;. The reviewer, Anders Swenson, disliked the randomness of the module&#x27;s encounters, arguing that it was unrealistic for so many monster nests to be found within a day&#x27;s march of a hardy military garrison. His real problem with the adventure, however, was that he believed that too many encounters were compressed into too small of an area. &quot;What deals and pacts have been made to permit the villagers, the clerics, the gnolls and wolves, and the inhabitants of Bone Hill to live in such harmony?&quot;

Robert Kern reviewed &quot;The Secret of Bone Hill&quot; in &quot;Ares Magazine&quot; #12 and commented that &quot;The good news is that TSR is publishing a new module for low level characters. The bad news is that it might require a more experienced DM to overcome it omissions and shotgun method of presenting information. &quot;

The module was positively reviewed by Jim Bambra in issue No. 35 of &quot;White Dwarf&quot; magazine, who rated it 8 out of 10. Bambra felt that the fishing port of Restenford and its surrounding wilderness were given &quot;particularly colourful&quot; descriptions. He wrote that the module provided some very interesting roleplaying situations and an excellent background for a campaign, but &quot;provides little more than this on a long term basis&quot;. He notes that some of the material would not be utilized until &quot;The Assassin&#x27;s Knot&quot; (L2, unreleased at that time) was purchased, and that &quot;trying to run this module on its own could prove to be a frustrating experience as the designer has given little indication of what L2 will contain or how many more modules there are likely to be.&quot; Bambra had hoped that the arrival of L2 would make &quot;The Secret of Bone Hill&quot; an enjoyable adventure.

Lawrence Schick in his book &quot;Heroic Worlds&quot; was critical of the module, calling it &quot;Not one of TSR&#x27;s more sterling endeavors,&quot; and noting that the back cover was &quot;deliberately botched&quot; by the artist (Erol Otus) &quot;who didn&#x27;t care for the product&quot;.

James Maliszewski claimed the module was one of his favorites because it created &quot;a very flexible &#x27;sandbox&#x27; framework for a low-level campaign&quot;.

Scott Taylor of &quot;Black Gate&quot; in 2015 gave the &quot;Lendore isles&quot; series an Honorable Mention in &quot;The Top 10 Campaign Adventure Module Series of All Time, saying &quot;for all its obvious benchmarks, Lendore is a muddle of 1st-5th level adventures without any true coherency.&quot;

<doc id="779628" wikidata="Q364456" url="?curid=779628" title="Michel Serres">
<text>Michel Serres (; ; 1 September 1930 – 1 June 2019) was a French philosopher, theorist and writer. His works explore themes of science, time and death, and later incorporated prose.

==Life and career==
The son of a bargeman, Serres entered France&#x27;s naval academy, the École Navale, in 1949 and the École Normale Supérieure in 1952. He aggregated in 1955, having studied philosophy. He spent the next few years as a naval officer before finally receiving his doctorate (doctorat ès lettres) in 1968 from the University of Paris (with a thesis titled &quot;Le Système de Leibniz et ses modèles mathématiques&quot;), and began teaching in 1969 at the University of Paris I.

As a child, Serres witnessed firsthand the violence and devastation of war. &quot;I was six for my first dead bodies,&quot; he told Bruno Latour. These formative experiences led him consistently to eschew scholarship based upon models of war, suspicion, and criticism.

Serres served as a professor of French at Stanford University. He earned a reputation as a spell-binding lecturer and as the author of remarkably beautiful and enigmatic prose so reliant on the sonorities of French that it is considered practically untranslatable. He took as his subjects such diverse topics as the mythical Northwest Passage, the concept of the parasite, and the explosion of the Space Shuttle Challenger. More generally Serres was interested in developing a philosophy of science which does not rely on a metalanguage in which a single account of science is privileged and regarded as accurate. To do this he relied on the concept of translation between accounts rather than settling on one as authoritative. For this reason, Serres has relied on the figure of Hermes (in his earlier works) and angels (in more recent studies) as messengers who translate (or map) back and forth between domains (i.e., between maps).

He was an influence on intellectuals such as Bruno Latour, Robert Pogue Harrison, and Jonathan Bate. Perhaps his most enduring book is &quot;Le contrat naturel&quot; (1990), a prescient work addressing the need for philosophy to address the climate crisis. 

In an interview with Hans Ulrich Obrist, Serres expressed interest in the emergence of a new political philosophy that addresses the digital context of the 21st century, &quot;I think that out of this place of no law that is the Internet there will soon emerge a new law, completely different from that which organized our old metric space.&quot;

Serres was a vocal enthusiast for freely accessible knowledge, especially Wikipedia.

He died on 1 June 2019, at the age of 88.

==Honours and recognition==
In 1990, Serres was elected to the Académie française, in recognition of his position as one of France&#x27;s most prominent intellectuals. 

In 2012, Serres was awarded the Meister Eckhart Prize and in 2013 he was awarded the Dan David Prize.

<doc id="779636" wikidata="Q678330" url="?curid=779636" title="Bondage Fairies">
<text>is an erotic manga about highly sexual, human-shaped female forest fairies with wings. It was originally a series in publisher Kubo Shoten&#x27;s &quot;Young Lemon&quot; magazine in 1990, where it was titled &quot;Insect Hunter&quot;. The manga is drawn by Teruo Kakuta (pen name &quot;Kondom&quot;). The series was later published in the United States with translated English text. It is among the earliest sexually explicit manga (eromanga) commercially published in the United States where it dates from 1994. Jason Thompson in &quot;&quot; mentions it was &quot;the first hit translated adult manga&quot;.

The series is about two forest fairies, Pfil (pronounced as either p&#x27;fill, or &quot;fill&quot;, like the male name Phil) and Pamila, who work as hunters and police protecting the forest, though not all of the series feature them as main characters. Pfil is more naïve and innocent, whereas Pamila is more sexually mature and open, although both frequently and easily engage in all sorts of sexual acts. The sexual content varies from intercourse to masturbation, lesbian sex, to fetishism, to bondage, to bestiality (with animals, including birds and insects). The stories often involve the two fairies saving the forest whilst engaging in various sexual acts. The comics often include small educational sections titled &quot;Pfil’s Educational Comics Corner&quot;, with topics ranging from insect behavior to human anatomy.

== Series history ==
&quot;Bondage Fairies&quot; was first published in Japan by Kubo Shoten in February 1990 under the title &quot;Insect Hunter&quot; (インセクト・ハンター), a reference to Pamila and Pfil&#x27;s role as police officers in the forest. The title was changed in April 1993. The first English translation in the United States used the title &quot;Bondage Fairies&quot; and was issued by Antarctic Press under their Venus Press imprint in 1994–5.

In the United States, Eros Comix subsequently published four multi-volume series of &quot;Bondage Fairies&quot;:
* &quot;The Original Bondage Fairies Books 1 and 2&quot; (Collecting 7 issue narrative)
* &quot;The New Bondage Fairies Books 1 and 2&quot; (Collecting 16 issues of short stories)
* &quot;The New Bondage Fairies: Fairie Fetish&quot; (Collecting 8 issues of short stories)
* &quot;Bondage Fairies Extreme Books 1 and 2&quot; (Collecting 15 issues), with translations by Toren Smith and Studio Proteus.
Translations also have been made into Swedish (Epix Förlag), German (BD Erotix), French (Bdérogène), and Italian (E.F. edizioni). A further short story (&quot;Nest Massacre&quot;) was published by Kubo Shoten in Kondom&#x27;s 2005 short story collection &quot;Hontō wa Eroi Otogi Banashi&quot; (&quot;Truly An Erotic Fairy Tale&quot;). In 2006, a collection of short stories entitled &quot;Cruel Sisters&quot; was published in Japan containing &quot;The Original Bondage Fairies&quot; and seven re-edited short stories from &quot;Fairy Fetish&quot;.

<doc id="779637" wikidata="Q76968" url="?curid=779637" title="Henry I, Landgrave of Hesse">
<text>Henry I of Hesse &quot;the Child&quot; (German: &quot;Heinrich das Kind&quot;) (24 June 1244 – 21 December 1308) was the first Landgrave of Hesse. He was the son of Henry II, Duke of Brabant and Sophie of Thuringia.

==Life==
In 1247, as Heinrich Raspe, Landgrave of Thuringia, died without issue, conflict arose about the future of Thuringia and Hesse. The succession was disputed between Heinrich Raspe&#x27;s nephew and his niece: Sophie was the daughter of Heinrich Raspe&#x27;s brother Ludwig IV and claimed the territories on behalf of her son Henry, while Henry the Illustrious, margrave of Meissen, was the son of Heinrich Raspe&#x27;s sister Jutta. Another competitor were the Archbishops of Mainz, who could claim Hesse was a fiefdom of the archbishop and now, after the extinction of the Ludowingians, demanded its return to them. Sophia, supported by the Hessian nobility, succeeded in retaining Hesse against her cousin, who in 1264 accepted the division of the Ludowingian inheritance: Henry of Meissen received Thuringia, while Sophia&#x27;s son Heinrich would inherit Hesse. In the following year, the Archbishop Werner II von Eppenstein acceded to this outcome in the Treaty of Langsdorf, accepting Henry as his liege-man and Landgrave of Hesse.

At this time, the landgraviate of Hesse consisted of the region between Wolfhagen, Zierenberg, Eschwege, Alsfeld, Grünberg, Frankenberg and Biedenkopf. In the same year, Henry acquired a part of the county of Gleiberg with Gießen from the Counts palatine of Tübingen. The landgraviate was centred on the towns of Kassel, where Henry took up his residence since 1277, and Marburg, where his grandmother Saint Elisabeth was buried and where Henry built the Castle Marburg.

===Struggle for possession of Naumburg===
Henry again got into conflict with his liege-lord, the Archbishop, about the possession of Naumburg. On behalf of the Archbishop, Henry was outlawed in 1274 by King Rudolf I of Habsburg, but after Henry had supported Rudolph in the war against Otakar II of Bohemia and had helped to conquer Vienna 1276, Rudolph reinstated Henry. In 1290 Henry defeated the Archbishop in the battle of Fritzlar and could henceforth maintain his territory.

Though Henry never relinquished his own claim on Brabant, he supported his nephew John of Brabant against Guelders and Luxembourg in the Limburg succession war.

===Elevation to prince of the realm===
On 12 May 1292, Henry was made a &quot;Reichsfürst&quot; (prince of the realm) by King Adolf of Nassau, freeing Hesse of the supremacy of the Archbishop of Mainz. Henry was bestowed with Eschwege and the Boyneburg (with Sontra), strengthening his position in Hesse. By skillful diplomacy he gained the cities of Sooden-Allendorf, Kaufungen, Witzenhausen, Immenhausen, Grebenstein, Wanfried, Staufenberg, Trendelburg and Reinhardswald.

In 1263 Henry had married Adelheid of Brunswick, daughter of Duke Otto of Brunswick, who bore him four daughters and the sons Henry (&quot;the Younger&quot;) and Otto. After Adelheid&#x27;s death in 1274, Henry had married Mechthild, daughter of Dietrich VI, Count of Cleves, who bore him another four daughters and the sons John and Louis.

===Uncertainty over succession===
In 1292 internal conflict arose about the question of Henry&#x27;s successor. Mechthild of Cleves demanded on her sons receiving a share of the heritage, while Henry and Otto, Henry&#x27;s sons by his first wife, insisted on excluding their half-brothers from the inheritance. This led to civil war lasting throughout the rest of Henry&#x27;s lifetime.

Henry died in Marburg during the conflict, and was buried there in St. Elisabeth&#x27;s Church, which became the gravesite of the succeeding Landgraves for several more centuries. After his death, the inheritance was divided between Otto, who received Upper Hesse (&quot;Oberhessen&quot;) around Marburg, and John, who received Lower Hesse (&quot;Niederhessen&quot;), centred on Kassel. John&#x27;s younger brother Ludwig had entered the clergy and became bishop of Münster in 1310.

<doc id="779642" wikidata="Q7549443" url="?curid=779642" title="So Much for the Afterglow">
<text>So Much for the Afterglow is the third studio album by American alternative rock band Everclear, released on October 7, 1997, through Capital Records. It contained the singles &quot;Everything to Everyone&quot;, &quot;I Will Buy You a New Life&quot;, &quot;Father of Mine&quot;, &quot;So Much for the Afterglow&quot;, and &quot;One Hit Wonder&quot;. &quot;Everything to Everyone&quot;, &quot;I Will Buy You A New Life&quot;, and &quot;Father of Mine&quot; received heavy rotation on MTV&#x27;s &quot;Total Request Live&quot; and launched Everclear into mainstream popularity in the late-90s. &quot;So Much for the Afterglow&quot; provided Everclear with their only Grammy nomination to date, a Best Rock Instrumental nod in 1998 for &quot;El Distorto de Melodica.&quot; The album is considered a departure from the band&#x27;s earlier punk rock and grunge sound for a more pop-oriented sound.

&quot;So Much for the Afterglow&quot; debuted at number 33 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, selling 34,000 in its first week of release. It stayed on the chart for 88 weeks, and was certified 2× Platinum by the RIAA in 1998. It remains Everclear&#x27;s best selling album, having sold 2.2 million copies in the United States by July 2004.

==Production==
It was originally going to be called &quot;Pure White Evil&quot;, however, the title was changed to &quot;So Much for the Afterglow&quot; in March 1997.

Early on, singer Art Alexakis wanted to create &quot;a combination of even heavier songs, more punk songs, and then kind of more melodic stuff.&quot; By the time touring for &quot;Sparkle and Fade&quot; ended and recording began, the direction of the album shifted. Alexakis remarked to MTV that, &quot;the fact is, &quot;Sparkle and Fade&quot; was a rock record with pop influences; this time we tried to make a pop record with rock influences.&quot; Regarding the recording process, Greg Eklund reflected, &quot;We rented a room in a warehouse, oddly enough by Esco Steel, where I used to work, in Northwest Portland. We were literally around the corner from where I used to work in a steel foundry. I don&#x27;t know how we found it, but it was in a really dilapidated warehouse down there. And Craig got, like, shingles and some weird flu that put him in the hospital or something. So I remember when we started working on Art&#x27;s new songs it was just him and me.&quot; He also noted there was pressure to follow up the success of the song &quot;Santa Monica&quot;, commenting &quot;We&#x27;d had some success with &quot;Santa Monica&quot; but there was a really big question mark whether we&#x27;d be able to continue that. You know what everybody says—you have 10 years to write your first record and six months to write your second. Art was a good songwriter, so I knew we had good songs, but it was sorta like, &#x27;Wow, if this doesn&#x27;t go, this might all end right here.&#x27;&quot;

Pro Tools were utilized during the recording, including on the song &quot;El Distorto de Melodica&quot;, which was composed in Pro Tools by associate producer Lars Fox, using techniques he&#x27;d developed while with his band, Grotus. On earlier Everclear releases, Alexakis sped up the tapes of songs to make them faster and more energetic. Due to Pro Tools, he was able to speed up songs without having his pitch altered. Fox recalled that &quot;Everything to Everyone&quot; was sped up by ten percent. He remarked, &quot;If he&#x27;d sung it and sped it up that much he&#x27;d sound like Mickey Mouse. He&#x27;d sound like a chipmunk. So he sung it with the track already sped up some percentage.&quot;

The final mixes for &quot;So Much for the Afterglow&quot; were completed in June 1997.

===Promotion===
Following a run of shows in the US during late 1997, Everclear had a troubled tour of Australia, which saw the band temporarily break up, with bassist Craig Montoya eventually leaving the tour. At the time, MTV News stated, &quot;Media reports from down under reveal that Montoya&#x27;s bass was stolen at the Extreme Games concert on the Gold Coast; a firecracker or pipe bomb was thrown on the stage in Melbourne; and that Alexakis was hit in the face by a shoe in Wollongong. [Australian music industry columnist Christie] Eliezer&#x27;s column also reports that following the theft of the guitar, Alexakis swore at the audience and made a reference to &#x27;the worst kind of **** convicts&#x27; and dropped his pants and dedicated the final song to the cursed thief.&quot; Alexakis later claimed the behaviour of the Australian fans didn&#x27;t lead to friction, saying &quot;The problem wasn&#x27;t with me. The problem was that the other people were having a hard time. Look, I love Australia! Especially Melbourne. Every time I go down there, I almost don&#x27;t wanna come back. I love it there.&quot; Eklund also elaborated, &quot;That&#x27;s complete bullshit. That&#x27;s a retelling of what happened. I love Australia, too. It&#x27;s one of my favorite places in the world. That&#x27;s not what happened.&quot;

==Reception==
&quot;So Much for the Afterglow&quot; received a mostly positive reaction from critics. The &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot; observed in their review that, &quot;It almost seems that Everclear is writing a soundtrack for their lives by singing about the &#x27;girl next door&#x27;, poverty, egotistical snobs and a father who abandons his family. Though Everclear does tackle some depressing subjects, their songs don&#x27;t become Pearl Jam-like depress-fests because of the band&#x27;s positive outlook and upbeat music.&quot; &quot;Spin&quot; claimed the album explored &quot;oddly grown-up topics for alt-rock&quot;, also noting similarities with the band&#x27;s previous work, stating &quot;On &quot;Sparkle and Fade&quot;, the centerpieces &#x27;Santa Monica&#x27; and &#x27;Summerland&#x27; deal expressly with escaping to begin a new life in a new place, west of here, beside the ocean if at all possible. Now in &#x27;Amphetamine&#x27;, Miss Perfect-in-a-Fucked-Up-Way comes &#x27;out West to find the sun&#x27;&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; gave the album a mixed review, stating &quot;the songs on &quot;So Much for the Afterglow&quot; manage only to present a series of victims, objects of leadman Art Alexakis&#x27; confused contempt or peculiarly mopey brand of compassion: the neglectful ne&#x27;er-do-well of &#x27;Father of Mine&#x27;; the people-pleasing nymphet of the first single, &#x27;Everything to Everyone&#x27;; the two-dimensional &#x27;magazine girl&#x27; of &#x27;Amphetamine&#x27;. Alexakis seems incapable of irony, depicting these people in a manner that&#x27;s never less than heavy-handed.&quot;

===Legacy and accolades===
&quot;The New York Times&quot; included &quot;So Much for the Afterglow&quot; on their &quot;Best of &#x27;97&quot; list in January 1998, writing &quot;With loud, obnoxious songs that confront the crisis of the family, monogamy&#x27;s perils and the vise grip of money, from the perspective of a punk trying not to self-destruct for a change, Everclear is perfecting rebel rock for adults.&quot; In 2017, &quot;The Dallas Morning News&quot; included &quot;So Much for the Afterglow&quot; in an article titled &quot;Flash back to 1997: 5 albums that were as good 20 years ago as they are today&quot;, noting that it took the band from &quot;one-hit wonder to modern rock headliner.&quot;

Everclear toured the US and Australia in 2017 to celebrate the album&#x27;s 20th anniversary.

<doc id="779645" wikidata="Q70868" url="?curid=779645" title="Otto I, Landgrave of Hesse">
<text>Otto I (17 January 1328) was Landgrave of Upper Hesse from 1308 and then Landgrave of Lower Hesse from 1311 until his death.

Otto was born in Marburg, a son of Henry I, Landgrave of Hesse and his first wife Adelheid of Brunswick-Lunenburg. Following the death of his father in 1308, he inherited Upper Hesse, the &quot;Land on the Lahn&quot;, which included Marburg, Giessen, Grünberg and Alsfeld. After his half-brother John died in 1311, he also became landgrave of Lower Hesse. This included the area below the Fulda, Eder, Schwalm, Werra, and the upper reaches of the Weser, with the residence of Kassel, as well as the towns of Homberg (Efze), Melsungen, and Rotenburg an der Fulda.

After Otto inherited the whole Landgraviate, he resided alternately in Kassel and Marburg. Otto had a long conflict with the Archbishop of Mainz, Matthias von Bucheck. In 1324 Mainz won the battle in the Lahnberg with help from troops from Amöneburg. In 1327, Mainz adopted Giessen with the help of troops from the Electorate of Trier, but the citizens of the town quickly enabled Otto to regain control. Only after Otto&#x27;s victory at Wetzlar and with the mediation of King John of Luxembourg in 1328 was conciliation made possible.

Otto died on 17 January 1328 in Kassel, and was buried in the Ahnaberg monastery.

==Family and children==
He was married 1297 in Saint Elisabethkirche, Marburg to Adelheid of Ravensberg, daughter of Count Otto III of Ravensberg and had the following children:
# Henry II the Iron (d. 3 June 1376, Kassel).
# Otto (1301–1361, Wolmirstedt), Archbishop of Magdeburg.
# Louis the Junker (d. 2 February 1345). Father of Hermann II of Hesse.
# Herman I the Elder (d. 1368/70).
# Elisabeth (d. 30 May 1373), married before 8 May 1336 to Duke Rudolf II of Saxony.

<text>Automobile handling and vehicle handling are descriptions of the way a wheeled vehicle responds and reacts to the inputs of a driver, as well as how it moves along a track or road. It is commonly judged by how a vehicle performs particularly during cornering, acceleration, and braking as well as on the vehicle&#x27;s directional stability when moving in steady state condition.

In the automotive industry, handling and braking are the major components of a vehicle&#x27;s &quot;active&quot; safety. They also affect its ability to perform in auto racing. The maximum lateral acceleration is, along with braking, regarded as a vehicle’s &quot;road holding&quot; ability. Automobiles driven on public roads whose engineering requirements emphasize handling over comfort and passenger space are called sports cars.

== Design factors that affect automobile handling ==

=== Weight distribution ===
==== Centre of mass height ====
The centre of mass height, also known as the centre of gravity height, or CGZ, relative to the track, determines load transfer (related to, but not exactly weight transfer) from side to side and causes body lean. When tires of a vehicle provide a centripetal force to pull it around a turn, the momentum of the vehicle actuates load transfer in a direction going from the vehicle&#x27;s current position to a point on a path tangent to the vehicle&#x27;s path. This load transfer presents itself in the form of body lean. In extreme circumstances, the vehicle may roll over.

Height of the centre of mass relative to the wheelbase determines load transfer between front and rear. The car&#x27;s momentum acts at its centre of mass to tilt the car forward or backward, respectively during braking and acceleration. Since it is only the downward force that changes and not the location of the centre of mass, the effect on over/under steer is &quot;opposite&quot; to that of an actual change in the centre of mass. When a car is braking, the downward load on the front tires increases and that on the rear decreases, with corresponding change in their ability to take sideways load.

A lower centre of mass is a principal performance advantage of sports cars, compared to sedans and (especially) SUVs. Some cars have body panels made of lightweight materials partly for this reason.

Body lean can also be controlled by the springs, anti-roll bars or the roll center heights.
==== Centre of mass ====
In steady-state cornering, front-heavy cars tend to understeer and rear-heavy cars to oversteer (Understeer &amp; Oversteer explained), all other things being equal. The mid-engine design seeks to achieve the ideal center of mass, though front-engine design has the advantage of permitting a more practical engine-passenger-baggage layout. All other parameters being equal, at the hands of an expert driver a neutrally balanced mid-engine car can corner faster, but a FR (front-engined, rear-wheel drive) layout car is easier to drive at the limit.

The rearward weight bias preferred by sports and racing cars results from handling effects during the transition from straight-ahead to cornering. During corner entry the front tires, in addition to generating part of the lateral force required to accelerate the car&#x27;s centre of mass into the turn, also generate a torque about the car&#x27;s vertical axis that starts the car rotating into the turn. However, the lateral force being generated by the rear tires is acting in the opposite torsional sense, trying to rotate the car out of the turn. For this reason, a car with &quot;50/50&quot; weight distribution will understeer on initial corner entry. To avoid this problem, sports and racing cars often have a more rearward weight distribution. In the case of pure racing cars, this is typically between &quot;40/60&quot; and &quot;35/65&quot;. This gives the front tires an advantage in overcoming the car&#x27;s moment of inertia (yaw angular inertia), thus reducing corner-entry understeer.

Using wheels and tires of different sizes (proportional to the weight carried by each end) is a lever automakers can use to fine tune the resulting over/understeer characteristics.

==== Roll angular inertia ====
This increases the time it takes to settle down and follow the steering. It depends on the (square of the) height and width, and (for a uniform mass distribution) can be approximately calculated by the equation: formula_1.

Greater width, then, though it counteracts center of gravity height, hurts handling by increasing angular inertia. Some high performance cars have light materials in their fenders and roofs partly for this reason

==== Yaw and pitch angular inertia (polar moment) ====
Unless the vehicle is very short, compared to its height or width, these are about equal. Angular inertia determines the rotational inertia of an object for a given rate of rotation. The yaw angular inertia tends to keep the direction the car is pointing changing at a constant rate. This makes it slower to swerve or go into a tight curve, and it also makes it slower to turn straight again. The pitch angular inertia detracts from the ability of the suspension to keep front and back tire loadings constant on uneven surfaces and therefore contributes to bump steer. Angular inertia is an integral over the &quot;square&quot; of the distance from the center of gravity, so it favors small cars even though the lever arms (wheelbase and track) also increase with scale. (Since cars have reasonable symmetrical shapes, the off-diagonal terms of the angular inertia tensor can usually be ignored.) Mass near the ends of a car can be avoided, without re-designing it to be shorter, by the use of light materials for bumpers and fenders or by deleting them entirely. If most of the weight is in the middle of the car then the vehicle will be easier to spin, and therefore will react quicker to a turn.

=== Suspension ===

Automobile suspensions have many variable characteristics, which are generally different in the front and rear and all of which affect handling. Some of these are: spring rate, damping, straight ahead camber angle, camber change with wheel travel, roll center height and the flexibility and vibration modes of the suspension elements. Suspension also affects unsprung weight.

Many cars have suspension that connects the wheels on the two sides, either by a sway bar and/or by a solid axle. The Citroën 2CV has interaction between the front and rear suspension.

==== Spring rate ====
The flexing of the frame interacts with the suspension. The following types of springs are commonly used for automobile suspension, variable rate springs and linear rate springs. When a load is applied to a linear rate spring the spring compresses an amount directly proportional to the load applied. This type of spring is commonly used in road racing applications when ride quality is not a concern. A linear spring will behave the same at all times. This provides predictable handling characteristics during high speed cornering, acceleration and braking. Variable springs have low initial springs rates. The spring rate gradually increases as it is compressed. In simple terms the spring becomes stiffer as it is compressed. The ends of the spring are wound tighter to produce a lower spring rate. When driving this cushions small road imperfections improving ride quality. However once the spring is compressed to a certain point the spring is not wound as tight providing a higher (stiffer) spring rate. This prevents excessive suspension compression and prevents dangerous body roll, which could lead to a roll over. Variable rate springs are used in cars designed for comfort as well as off-road racing vehicles. In off-road racing they allow a vehicle to absorb the violent shock from a jump effectively as well as absorb small bumps along the off-road terrain effectively.

==== Suspension travel ====
The severe handling vice of the TR3B and related cars was caused by running out of suspension travel. Other vehicles will run out of suspension travel with some combination of bumps and turns, with similarly catastrophic effect. Excessively modified cars also may encounter this problem.

=== Tires and wheels ===
In general, softer rubber, higher hysteresis rubber and stiffer cord configurations increase road holding and improve handling. On most types of poor surfaces, large diameter wheels perform better than lower wider wheels. The depth of tread remaining greatly affects aquaplaning (riding over deep water without reaching the road surface). Increasing tire pressures reduces their slip angle, but lessening the contact area is detrimental in usual surface conditions and should be used with caution.

The amount a tire meets the road is an equation between the weight of the car and the type (and size) of its tire. A 1000 kg car can depress a 185/65/15 tire more than a 215/45/15 tire longitudinally thus having better linear grip and better braking distance not to mention better aquaplaning performance, while the wider tires have better (dry) cornering resistance.

The contemporary chemical make-up of tires is dependent of the ambient and road temperatures. Ideally a tire should be soft enough to conform to the road surface (thus having good grip), but be hard enough to last for enough duration (distance) to be economically feasible. It is usually a good idea having different set of summer and winter tires for climates having these temperatures.

=== Track and wheelbase ===
The axle track provides the resistance to lateral weight transfer and body lean. The wheelbase provides resistance to longitudinal weight transfer and to pitch angular inertia, and provides the torque lever arm to rotate the car when swerving. The wheelbase, however, is less important than angular inertia (polar moment) to the vehicle&#x27;s ability to swerve quickly.

The wheelbase contributes to the vehicle&#x27;s turning radius, which is also a handling characteristic.

=== Unsprung weight ===
Ignoring the flexing of other components, a car can be modeled as the sprung weight, carried by the springs, carried by the unsprung weight, carried by the tires, carried by the road. Unsprung weight is more properly regarded as a mass which has its own inherent inertia separate from the rest of the vehicle. When a wheel is pushed upwards by a bump in the road, the inertia of the wheel will cause it to be carried further upward above the height of the bump. If the force of the push is sufficiently large, the inertia of the wheel will cause the tire to completely lift off the road surface resulting in a loss of traction and control. Similarly when crossing into a sudden ground depression, the inertia of the wheel slows the rate at which it descends. If the wheel inertia is large enough, the wheel may be temporarily separated from the road surface before it has descended back into contact with the road surface.

This unsprung weight is cushioned from uneven road surfaces only by the compressive resilience of the tire (and wire wheels if fitted), which aids the wheel in remaining in contact with the road surface when the wheel inertia prevents close-following of the ground surface. However, the compressive resilience of the tire results in rolling resistance which requires additional kinetic energy to overcome, and the rolling resistance is expended in the tire as heat due to the flexing of the rubber and steel bands in the sidewalls of the tires. To reduce rolling resistance for improved fuel economy and to avoid overheating and failure of tires at high speed, tires are designed to have limited internal damping.

So the &quot;wheel bounce&quot; due to wheel inertia, or resonant motion of the unsprung weight moving up and down on the springiness of the tire, is only poorly damped, mainly by the dampers or shock absorbers of the suspension. For these reasons, high unsprung weight reduces road holding and increases unpredictable changes in direction on rough surfaces (as well as degrading ride comfort and increasing mechanical loads).

This unsprung weight includes the wheels and tires, usually the brakes, plus some percentage of the suspension, depending on how much of the suspension moves with the body and how much with the wheels; for instance a solid axle suspension is completely unsprung. The main factors that improve unsprung weight are a sprung differential (as opposed to live axle) and inboard brakes. (The De Dion tube suspension operates much as a live axle does, but represents an improvement because the differential is mounted to the body, thereby reducing the unsprung weight.) Wheel materials and sizes will also have an effect. Aluminium alloy wheels are common due to their weight characteristics which help to reduce unsprung mass. Magnesium alloy wheels are even lighter but corrode easily.

Since only the brakes on the driving wheels can easily be inboard, the Citroën 2CV had inertial dampers on its rear wheel hubs to damp only wheel bounce.

=== Aerodynamics ===
Aerodynamic forces are generally proportional to the square of the air speed, therefore car aerodynamics become rapidly more important as speed increases. Like darts, airplanes, etc., cars can be stabilised by fins and other rear aerodynamic devices. However, in addition to this cars also use downforce or &quot;negative lift&quot; to improve road holding. This is prominent on many types of racing cars, but is also used on most passenger cars to some degree, if only to counteract the tendency for the car to otherwise produce positive lift.

In addition to providing increased adhesion, car aerodynamics are frequently designed to compensate for the inherent increase in oversteer as cornering speed increases. When a car corners, it must rotate about its vertical axis as well as translate its center of mass in an arc. However, in a tight-radius (lower speed) corner the angular velocity of the car is high, while in a longer-radius (higher speed) corner the angular velocity is much lower. Therefore, the front tires have a more difficult time overcoming the car&#x27;s moment of inertia during corner entry at low speed, and much less difficulty as the cornering speed increases. So the natural tendency of any car is to understeer on entry to low-speed corners and oversteer on entry to high-speed corners. To compensate for this unavoidable effect, car designers often bias the car&#x27;s handling toward less corner-entry understeer (such as by lowering the front roll center), and add rearward bias to the aerodynamic downforce to compensate in higher-speed corners. The rearward aerodynamic bias may be achieved by an airfoil or &quot;spoiler&quot; mounted near the rear of the car, but a useful effect can also be achieved by careful shaping of the body as a whole, particularly the aft areas.

In recent years, aerodynamics have become an area of increasing focus by racing teams as well as car manufacturers. Advanced tools such as wind tunnels and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) have allowed engineers to optimize the handling characteristics of vehicles. Advanced wind tunnels such as Wind Shear&#x27;s Full Scale, Rolling Road, Automotive Wind Tunnel recently built in Concord, North Carolina have taken the simulation of on-road conditions to the ultimate level of accuracy and repeatability under very controlled conditions. CFD has similarly been used as a tool to simulate aerodynamic conditions but through the use of extremely advanced computers and software to duplicate the car&#x27;s design digitally then &quot;test&quot; that design on the computer.

=== Delivery of power to the wheels and brakes ===
The coefficient of friction of rubber on the road limits the magnitude of the vector sum of the transverse and longitudinal force. So the driven wheels or those supplying the most braking tend to slip sideways. This phenomenon is often explained by use of the circle of forces model.

One reason that sports cars are usually rear wheel drive is that power induced oversteer is useful to a skilled driver for tight curves. The weight transfer under acceleration has the opposite effect and either may dominate, depending on the conditions. Inducing oversteer by applying power in a front wheel drive car is possible via proper use of &quot;left-foot braking”, and using low gears down steep hills may cause some oversteer.

The effect of braking on handling is complicated by load transfer, which is proportional to the (negative) acceleration times the ratio of the center of gravity height to the wheelbase. The difficulty is that the acceleration at the limit of adhesion depends on the road surface, so with the same ratio of front to back braking force, a car will understeer under braking on slick surfaces and oversteer under hard braking on solid surfaces. Most modern cars combat this by varying the distribution of braking in some way. This is important with a high center of gravity, but it is also done on low center of gravity cars, from which a higher level of performance is expected.

=== Steering ===
Depending on the driver, steering force and transmission of road forces back to the steering wheel and the steering ratio of turns of the steering wheel to turns of the road wheels affect control and awareness. Play—free rotation of the steering wheel before the wheels rotate—is a common problem, especially in older model and worn cars. Another is friction. Rack and pinion steering is generally considered the best type of mechanism for control effectiveness. The linkage also contributes play and friction. Caster—offset of the steering axis from the contact patch—provides some of the self-centering tendency.

Precision of the steering is particularly important on ice or hard packed snow where the slip angle at the limit of adhesion is smaller than on dry roads.

The steering effort depends on the downward force on the steering tires and on the radius of the contact patch. So for constant tire pressure, it goes like the 1.5 power of the vehicle&#x27;s weight. The driver&#x27;s ability to exert torque on the wheel scales similarly with his size. The wheels must be rotated farther on a longer car to turn with a given radius. Power steering reduces the required force at the expense of feel. It is useful, mostly in parking, when the weight of a front-heavy vehicle exceeds about ten or fifteen times the driver&#x27;s weight, for physically impaired drivers and when there is much friction in the steering mechanism.

Four-wheel steering has begun to be used on road cars (Some WW II reconnaissance vehicles had it). It relieves the effect of angular inertia by starting the whole car moving before it rotates toward the desired direction. It can also be used, in the other direction, to reduce the turning radius. Some cars will do one or the other, depending on the speed.

Steering geometry changes due to bumps in the road may cause the front wheels to steer in different directions together or independent of each other. The steering linkage should be designed to minimize this effect.

=== Electronic stability control ===

Electronic stability control (ESC) is a computerized technology that improves the safety of a vehicle&#x27;s stability by attempting to detect and prevent skids. When ESC detects loss of steering control, the system applies individual brakes to help &quot;steer&quot; the vehicle where the driver wants to go. Braking is automatically applied to individual wheels, such as the outer front wheel to counter oversteer, or the inner rear wheel to counter understeer.

The stability control of some cars may not be compatible with some driving techniques, such as power induced over-steer. It is therefore, at least from a sporting point of view, preferable that it can be disabled.

=== Static alignment of the wheels ===
Of course things should be the same, left and right, for road cars. Camber affects steering because a tire generates a force towards the side that the top is leaning towards. This is called camber thrust. Additional front negative camber is used to improve the cornering ability of cars with insufficient camber gain.

=== Rigidity of the frame ===
The frame may flex with load, especially twisting on bumps.
Rigidity is considered to help handling. At least it simplifies the suspension engineers work.
Some cars, such as the Mercedes-Benz 300SL have had high door sills to allow a stiffer frame.

== Driver handling the car ==
Handling is a property of the car, but different characteristics will work well with different drivers.
=== Familiarity ===
The more experience a person has with a car or type of car the more likely they will be to take full advantage of its handling characteristics under adverse conditions.

=== Position and support for the driver ===

* Having to withstand g forces in his/her arms interferes with a driver&#x27;s precise steering. In a similar manner, a lack of support for the seating position of the driver may cause them to move around as the car undergoes rapid acceleration (through cornering, taking off or braking). This interferes with precise control inputs, making the car more difficult to control.
* Being able to reach the controls easily is also an important consideration, especially if a car is being driven hard.
* In some circumstances, good support may allow a driver to retain some control, even after a minor accident or after the first stage of an accident.

== External conditions that affect handling ==

=== Weather ===
Weather affects handling by changing the amount of available traction on a surface. Different tires do best in different weather. Deep water is an exception to the rule that wider tires improve road holding. 

=== Road condition ===
Cars with relatively soft suspension and with low unsprung weight are least affected by uneven surfaces, while on flat smooth surfaces the stiffer the better. Unexpected water, ice, oil, etc. are hazards.

== Common handling problems ==
When any wheel leaves contact with the road there is a change in handling, so the suspension should keep all four (or three) wheels on the road in spite of hard cornering, swerving and bumps in the road. It is very important for handling, as well as other reasons, not to run out of suspension travel and &quot;bottom&quot; or &quot;top&quot;.

It is usually most desirable to have the car adjusted for a small amount of understeer, so that it responds predictably to a turn of the steering wheel and the rear wheels have a smaller slip angle than the front wheels. However this may not be achievable for all loading, road and weather conditions, speed ranges, or while turning under acceleration or braking. Ideally, a car should carry passengers and baggage near its center of gravity and have similar tire loading, camber angle and roll stiffness in front and back to minimise the variation in handling characteristics. A driver can learn to deal with excessive oversteer or understeer, but not if it varies greatly in a short period of time.

The most important common handling failings are;
* Understeer – the front wheels tend to crawl slightly or even slip and drift towards the outside of the turn. The driver can compensate by turning a little more tightly, but road-holding is reduced, the car&#x27;s behaviour is less predictable and the tires are liable to wear more quickly.
* Oversteer – the rear wheels tend to crawl or slip towards the outside of the turn more than the front. The driver must correct by steering away from the corner, otherwise the car is liable to spin, if pushed to its limit. Oversteer is sometimes useful, to assist in steering, especially if it occurs only when the driver chooses it by applying power.
* Bump steer – the effect of irregularity of a road surface on the angle or motion of a car. It may be the result of the kinematic motion of the suspension rising or falling, causing toe-in or toe-out at the loaded wheel, ultimately affecting the yaw angle (heading) of the car. It may also be caused by defective or worn out suspension components. This will always happen under some conditions but depends on suspension, steering linkage, unsprung weight, angular inertia, differential type, frame rigidity, tires and tire pressures. If suspension travel is exhausted the wheel either bottoms or loses contact with the road. As with hard turning on flat roads, it is better if the wheel picks up by the spring reaching its neutral shape, rather than by suddenly contacting a limiting structure of the suspension.
* Body roll – the car leans towards the outside of the curve. This interferes with the driver&#x27;s control, because they must wait for the car to finish leaning before they can fully judge the effect of his steering change. It also adds to the delay before the car moves in the desired direction. It also slightly changes the weight borne by the tires as described in weight transfer.
* Excessive load transfer – On any vehicle that is cornering, the outside wheels are more heavily loaded than the inside due to the CG being above the ground. Total weight transfer (sum of front and back), in steady cornering, is determined by the ratio of the height of a car&#x27;s center of gravity to its axle track. When the weight transfer equals half the vehicle&#x27;s loaded weight, it will start to roll over. This can be avoided by manually or automatically reducing the turn rate, but this causes further reduction in road-holding.
* Slow response – sideways acceleration does not start immediately when the steering is turned and may not stop immediately when it is returned to center. This is partly caused by body roll. Other causes include tires with high slip angle, and yaw and roll angular inertia. Roll angular inertia aggravates body roll by delaying it. Soft tires aggravate yaw angular inertia by waiting for the car to reach their slip angle before turning the car.

== Compromises ==
Ride quality and handling have always been a compromise - technology has over time allowed automakers to combine more of both features in the same vehicle. High levels of comfort are difficult to reconcile with a low center of gravity, body roll resistance, low angular inertia, support for the driver, steering feel and other characteristics that make a car handle well.

For ordinary production cars, manufactures err towards deliberate understeer as this is safer for inexperienced or inattentive drivers than is oversteer. Other compromises involve comfort and utility, such as preference for a softer smoother ride or more seating capacity.

Inboard brakes improve both handling and comfort but take up space and are harder to cool. Large engines tend to make cars front or rear heavy. Fuel economy, staying cool at high speeds, ride comfort and long wear all tend to conflict with road holding, while wet, dry, deep water and snow road holding are not exactly compatible. A-arm or wishbone front suspension tends to give better handling, because it provides the engineers more freedom to choose the geometry, and more road holding, because the camber is better suited to radial tires, than MacPherson strut, but it takes more space.

The older Live axle rear suspension technology, familiar from the Ford Model T, is still widely used in most sport utility vehicles and trucks, often for the purposes of durability (and cost). The live axle suspension is still used in some sports cars, like the Ford Mustang (model years before 2015), and is better for drag racing, but generally has problems with grip on bumpy corners, fast corners and stability at high speeds on bumpy straights.

== Aftermarket modifications and adjustments ==
Lowering the center of gravity will always help the handling (as well as reduce the chance of roll-over). This can be done to some extent by using plastic windows (or none) and light roof, hood (bonnet) and trunk (boot) lid materials, by reducing the ground clearance, etc. Increasing the track with &quot;reversed&quot; wheels will have a similar effect, but the wider the car the less spare room it has on the road and the farther it may have to swerve to miss an obstacle.

Stiffer springs and/or shocks, both front and rear, will generally improve handling on close to perfect surfaces, while worsening handling on less-than-perfect road conditions by &quot;skipping&quot; the car (and destroying grip), thus making handling the vehicle difficult. Aftermarket performance suspension kits are usually readily available.

Lighter (mostly aluminum or magnesium alloy) wheels improve handling as well as ride comfort, by lessening unsprung weight.

Moment of inertia can be reduced by using lighter bumpers and wings (fenders), or none at all.

Fixing understeer or oversteer conditions is achieved by either an increase or decrease in grip on the front or rear axles. If the front axle has more grip than a similar vehicle with neutral steer characteristics, the vehicle will oversteer. The oversteering vehicle may be &quot;tuned&quot; by hopefully increasing rear axle grip, or alternatively by reducing front axle grip. The opposite is true for an understeering vehicle (rear axle has excess grip, fixed by increasing front grip or reducing rear grip). The following actions will have the tendency to &quot;increase the grip&quot; of an axle. Increasing moment arm distance to cg, reducing lateral load transfer (softening shocks, softening sway bars, increasing track width), increasing tire contact patch size, increasing the longitudinal load transfer to that axle, and decreasing tire pressure.

== Cars with unusual handling problems ==
Certain vehicles can be involved in a disproportionate share of single-vehicle accidents; their handling characteristics may play a role:
* Early Porsche 911s – suffered from treacherous lift off oversteer (where the rear of the car loses grip as the driver lifts off the accelerator); also the inside front wheel leaves the road during hard cornering on dry pavement, causing increasing understeer. The roll bar stiffness at the front is set to compensate for the rear-heaviness and gives neutral handling in ordinary driving. This compensation starts to give out when the wheel lifts. A skilled driver can use the 911&#x27;s other features to his/her advantage, making the 911 an extremely capable sports car in expert hands. Later 911s have had increasingly sophisticated rear suspensions and larger rear tires, eliminating these problems.
* Triumph TR2, and TR3 – began to oversteer more suddenly when their inside rear wheel lifted.
* Volkswagen Beetle – (original Beetle) senstitivity to crosswinds, due to the lightness of the front of the rear engine car; and poor roll stability due to the swing axle suspension. People who drove them hard fitted reversed wheels and bigger rear tires and rims to ameliorate.
* Chevrolet Corvair - poor roll stability due to the swing axle rear suspension similar to that used in the Volkswagen Beetle, and cited for dangerous handling in Ralph Nader&#x27;s book Unsafe at Any Speed. These problems were corrected with the redesign of the Corvair for 1965, but sales did not recover from the negative publicity and it was discontinued.
* The large, rear-engine Tatra 87 (known as the &#x27;Czech secret weapon&#x27;) killed so many Nazi officers during World War II that the German Army eventually forbade its officers from driving the Tatra.
* Some 1950s American &quot;full size&quot; cars responded very slowly to steering changes because of their very large angular inertia, softly tuned suspension which made ride quality a priority over cornering, and comfort oriented cross bias tires. &quot;Auto Motor und Sport&quot; reported on one of these that they lacked the courage to test it for top speed.
* Dodge Omni and Plymouth Horizon – these early American responses to the Volkswagen Rabbit were found &quot;unacceptable&quot; in their initial testing by Consumer Reports, due to an observed tendency to display an uncontrollable oscillating yaw from side to side under certain steering inputs. While Chrysler&#x27;s denials of this behaviour were countered by a persistent trickle of independent reports of this behaviour, production of the cars was altered to equip them with both a lighter weight steering wheel and a steering damper, and no further reports of this problem were heard.
* The Suzuki Samurai – was similarly reported by &quot;Consumer Reports&quot; to exhibit a propensity to tipping over onto two wheels, to the point where Consumer Reports claimed they were afraid to continue testing the vehicle without the attachment of outrigger wheels to catch it from completely rolling over. In its first set of tests, the Samurai performed well. R. David Little, Consumers Union&#x27;s technical director, drove the light SUV through several short, hard turns, designed to simulate an emergency, such as trying to avoid a child running in front of the car. An article published several years later in a Consumer Reports anniversary issue prompted Suzuki to sue. The suit was based on the perception that Consumer Reports rigged the results: &quot;This case is about lying and cheating by Consumers Union for its own financial motives,&quot; George F. Ball, Suzuki&#x27;s managing counsel, said Monday. &quot;They were in debt [in 1988], and they needed a blockbuster story to raise and solicit funds.&quot; Entrepreneur Magazine reported that &quot;Suzuki&#x27;s case centered on a change CU made while testing the vehicle. After the Samurai and other SUVs completed the standard course without threatening to roll over, CU altered the course to make the turns more abrupt. The other vehicles didn&#x27;t show a problem, but the Samurai tipped up and would have rolled over but for outriggers set up to prevent that outcome&quot; After eight years in court the parties consented to a settlement which did not include monetary damages nor a retraction. Commenting on the settlement, Consumer Union said,&quot;Consumers Union also says in the agreement that it &quot;never intended to imply that the Samurai easily rolls over in routine driving conditions.&quot; CU Vice President of Technical Policy further stated: &quot;There is no apology. &quot;We stand fully behind our testing and rating of the Samurai.&quot; In a joint press statement Suzuki recognized &quot;CU&#x27;s stated commitment for objective and unbiased testing and reporting.&quot;
* Mercedes-Benz A-Class – a tall car with a high center of gravity; early models showed excessive body roll during sharp swerving manoeuvres and rolled over, most particularly during the Swedish moose test. This was later corrected using Electronic Stability Control and retrofitted at great expense to earlier cars.
* Ford Explorer – a dangerous tendency to blow a rear tire and flip over. Ford had constructed a vehicle with a high center of gravity; between 68 and 74 cm above ground (depending on model). The tendency to roll over on sharp changes in direction is built into the vehicle. Ford attempted to counteract the forces of nature by specifying lower than optimum pressures in the tires in order to induce them to lose traction and slide under sideways forces rather than to grip and force the vehicle to roll over. For reasons that were never entirely clear, tires from one factory tended to blow out when under inflated, these vehicles then rolled over, which led to a spate of well publicized single-vehicle accidents.
:Ford and Firestone, the makers of the tires, pointed fingers at each other, with the final blame being assigned to quality control practices at a Firestone plant which was undergoing a strike. Tires from a different Firestone plant were not associated with this problem. An internal document dated 1989 states
::&quot;Engineering has recommended use of tire pressures below maximum allowable inflation levels for all UN46 tires. As described previously, the reduced tire pressures increase understeer and reduce maximum cornering capacity (both &#x27;stabilising&#x27; influences). This practice has been used routinely in heavy duty pick-up truck and car station wagon applications to assure adequate understeer under all loading conditions. Nissan (Pathfinder), Toyota, Chevrolet, and Dodge also reduce tire pressures for selected applications. While we cannot be sure of their reasons, similarities in vehicle loading suggest that maintaining a minimal level of understeer under rear-loaded conditions may be the compelling factor.&quot;
:This contributed to build-up of heat and tire deterioration under sustained high speed use, and eventual failure of the most highly stressed tire. Of course, the possibility that slightly substandard tire construction and slightly higher than average tire stress, neither of which would be problematic in themselves, would in combination result in tire failure is quite likely. The controversy continues without unequivocal conclusions, but it also brought public attention to a generally high incidence of rollover accidents involving SUVs, which the manufacturers continue to address in various ways. A subsequent NHTSA investigation of real world accident data showed that the SUVs in question were no more likely to roll over than any other SUV, after a tread separation.
* The Jensen GT (hatchback coupe) – was introduced in attempt to broaden the sales base of the Jensen Healey, which had up to that time been a roadster or convertible. Its road test report in &quot;Motor Magazine&quot; and a very similar one, soon after, in &quot;Road &amp; Track&quot; concluded that it was no longer fun enough to drive to be worth that much money. They blamed it on minor suspension changes. Much more likely, the change in weight distribution was at fault. The Jensen Healey was a rather low and wide fairly expensive sports car, but the specifications of its suspension were not particularly impressive, having a solid rear axle. Unlike the AC Ace, with its double transverse leaf rear suspension and aluminium body, the Jensen Healey could not stand the weight of that high up metal and glass and still earn a premium price for its handling. The changes also included a cast iron exhaust manifold replacing the aluminium one, probably to partly balance the high and far back weight of the top. The factory building was used to build multi-tub truck frames.
* The rear engined Renault Dauphine earned in Spain the sobriquet of the &quot;widow&#x27;s car&quot;, due to its bad handling.
* Three-wheeled cars/vehicles have unique handling issues, especially considering whether the single wheel is at the front or back. (Motorcycles with sidecars; another matter.) Buckminster Fuller&#x27;s Dymaxion car caused a sensation, but ignorance of the problems of rear-wheel-steering led to a fatal crash that destroyed its reputation.

<text>A strategist is a person with responsibility for the formulation
and implementation of a strategy.
Strategy generally involves setting goals, determining actions to achieve the goals,
and mobilizing resources to execute the actions. A strategy describes how the ends (goals) will be achieved using the means (resources). Organizations generally task senior leaders with determining strategy. Strategy can be intended or can emerge as a pattern of activity as the organization adapts to its environment or competes. It involves activities such as strategic planning and strategic thinking.

==Types of strategists by field==
The strategy role exists in a variety of organizations and fields of study.

In large corporations, strategic planners or corporate financial planning and analysis (FP&amp;A) personnel are involved in the formulation and implementation of the organization&#x27;s strategy. The strategy is typically set by business leaders such as the chief executive officer and key business or functional leaders and is reviewed by the board of directors.

An AI strategist uses evidence and reason to make circumstance-dependent decisions that shape the development of AI towards a set of desired outcomes. The scope of AI development can range from within small organizations to global landscape.

A design strategist has the ability to combine the innovative, perceptive and holistic insights of a designer with the and systemic skills of a planner to guide strategic direction in context of business needs, brand intent, design quality and customer values.

An economic strategist is a person who can create a sustainable commercial advantage by applying innovative and quantitative ideas and systems at a sell side financial institution.

A political strategist is a multi-discipline strategist who works within political campaigns. Also known as political consulting, the political strategist will advise a campaign on a range of activities such as media, resourcing, opposition research, opinion polling and engagement strategy.

A sport strategist is a professional that performs scouting and analysis of the players involved in an upcoming competitive match. Sports strategists typically analyze film footage, organize video libraries, and recommend attacks and defensive strategies in order to capitalize on an opponent&#x27;s weaknesses. 
Working closely with investment managers, a principal investment strategist contributes revenue by providing principal investment analytics and alternative product structuring.

A sales strategist develops innovative trade ideas and assists in the marketing of those trades to buy side clients.

A banking strategist partners with investment bankers and capital market experts on corporate finance and capital structure analyses to identify and execute banking transactions.

A trading strategist contributes revenue to the business in which his team is embedded by developing and delivering innovative trade ideas, models and analytic systems to the trading desk.

Within the financial services industry, strategists are known as “strats”.

A military strategist develops strategies in the field of warfare with the objective of outmaneuvering their opponent.

An IT Strategist develops an IT strategy that is aligned with the business strategy to implement systems to give business processes efficiency and productivity gains and therefore a possible competitive advantage.

==Strategist as a personality type==
Strategists are known to have an INTJ personality trait , based on the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI). The MBTI was derived from Psychiatrist Carl Jung theory of psychological types enabling us to have a better understanding of people&#x27;s personality traits and what their strengths are as a person, although the research shows MBTI to be an unreliable measure of categorising personality types. It is commonly found that strategists are more prone to possess a combination of 4 specific personality traits, which includes Introversion, Intuition, Thinking and Judgment (forming the acronym INTJ). However, this combination of personality traits is known to be very rare among people , making strategists to be very sought after especially by major firms. Dr. Vladimir Kvint defined strategist as a wise, disciplined, and optimistic professional with a strategic mindset, a vision of the future, and intuition. It is possible at times to find that the vision or ideas of a strategist may not be align with conventional ideas which can make it difficult for others to accept or envision.

==Career paths==
People who possess a strategist mindset are generally capable of doing well in any possible field due to the various traits that they own. Strategists tend to follow a career path that challenges them mentally in terms of development, and seek to work with people who are in the same caliber in terms of intelligence and competency. As it is highly likely that people with a strategist mindset tend to be more single-minded and may not be appreciative of others&#x27; effort, it is crucial for them to work in a suitable working environment.

Common careers that strategists tend to choose are:
# Academia
# Computing 
# Engineering
# Sciences
# Project Management
# Research and development
# Management
Strategists can have a variety of backgrounds such journalism, speech writing, data analyzing, or telemarketing. People with a background of public relations or advertising can be hired as strategists because of their experience in market research and message delivery.

<text>The Commodore RAM Expansion Unit (REU) is a range of external RAM add-ons.

At the time of introduction of the Commodore 128 home computer, two REUs were announced for that model; the 1700 (128 KB) and 1750 () REUs. Later, Commodore introduced a third model, for their Commodore 64 model: the 1764 ()

The need for the REU came about when Commodore management decided to not use the final version of the custom Memory Management Unit (MMU) which then limited the size of memory in spite of early discussion of a larger memory map. Engineers traveling to the 1985 Consumer Electronics Show (CES) were confronted with flyers and billboards advertising a memory size that was no longer supported and finally the top management asked where the additional memory (up to ) would plug in.

By the time of the 1985 CES show in Chicago, the engineers were able to display a spinning globe of the earth as a demonstration of Direct Memory Access (DMA) by the new REU units.

The REU hardware was designed by Frank Palia and the dedicated RAM Expansion Controller (REC) integrated circuit (IC) was designed by Victor Andrade. Fred Bowen and Terry Ryan adapted the C128&#x27;s KERNAL and BASIC to accommodate the REU natively and Hedley Davis wrote the globe spinning demo which was an impressive display of animation in the mid-1980s.

==Hardware description==

Although the C128 could access more than of RAM through bank switching, the memory inside the REU could only be accessed by memory-transfers (STORE/LOAD/SWAP/COMPAREs) between the main memory and the REU memory. Additionally, the C128&#x27;s built-in BASIC 7.0 had three statements, codice_1, codice_2, and codice_3, for storing and retrieving data from the REU.

Officially, only the 1700 and 1750 were supported on the C128. The model, the 1764, was released for the C64 at the same time. There were only minor differences between the three models. The original C64 power supply could not support the additional load presented by the 1764 so a 2.5 ampere C64 power supply was included.

The 1700 uses sixteen 4164 64kx1 DRAM ICs, the 1764 has eight 41256 256kx1 DRAMs, and the 1750 has sixteen 41256 DRAMs.

In practice, the difference between the 1764 and the earlier units had little effect on compatibility, and people used 1700s and 1750s successfully with the C64, and 1764s successfully with the C128, although the C64&#x27;s stock power supply was inadequate to reliably handle the power load of any of them. Some dealers unbundled the 1764 and the power supply in order to sell the power supply to C64 users, and/or upgrade the 1764 to .

The REU model 1750 can be modified to support up to 2MB on memory by installing 2 additional ICs for bank switch. There is only one source of software incompatibility in this modification: software that doesn&#x27;t set the bits at $DF06 to the same value at all times, or sets the bits to a bank of 512 kb that isn&#x27;t installed yet, won&#x27;t work.

During the late 1980s, there was a shortage of DRAM thus 1750s were rare and expensive. However it was comparatively easy to upgrade a 1700 or 1764 to . Several firms did this commercially, either selling upgraded units or upgrading customer-supplied units.

In the early 1990s, DIY modification schemes to increase the capacity of an REU to one megabyte or higher appeared on various online services.

==Model differences==
The 1700s circuit board was identical to that of the 1750, and a trace marked J1 indicated the size of the chips used. On the 1750 and 1764, this trace was cut.

The 1700 and 1750 had a resistor at position R4 that, according to Commodore engineer Fred Bowen, compensated for subtle timing differences in the expansion port on the C64 and C128. The 1764 lacked that resistor. Bowen and other CBM engineers recommended against using a 1764 with a C128 unless the resistor was added, or a 1700/1750 with a C64 unless the resistor was removed.

It was possible to check for the presence of a 1750 by reading memory address codice_4&#x27;s bit 4, which was 1 on a 1750, and 0 on a 1700 or 1764. However, since this procedure would not distinguish between a 1700 and a 1764. To solve this, programmers wrote to, then read from, the REU&#x27;s RAM to find out the amount of memory installed.

==REU software support==
A small percentage of software made use of the REUs. Like other add-on products from Commodore, their relatively small installed base relative to the huge number of C64s &amp; C128s made software developers hesitant to invest much time and effort in supporting REUs. The lack of commercial support kept sales lower than they otherwise might have been. Due to its high speed relative to Commodore&#x27;s floppy drives or even the commercially available hard drives, REUs did see support in the Commodore BBS community. Programs such as Color64 required a REU to minimize load times when switching between sections of the BBS.

The REUs came with software to use the extra memory as a RAM disk, but the RAM disk&#x27;s compatibility with commercial software varied as some commercial software relied heavily on various quirks of the Commodore 1541 floppy drive. Additionally, many commercial programs simply overwrote the memory space occupied by the RAM disk software.

The GEOS operating system had built in support for the REU as a RAM disk, as did the C128&#x27;s version of CP/M, and some disk copy programs used the REU to facilitate high-speed copying with a single disk drive. GEOS as well as other programs even used the REU for quick memory transfers within the host machine&#x27;s main memory by storing a memory block into the REU and then fetching it back to another location. Using this method, only the actual data to be transferred needed to travel on the machine&#x27;s data bus—unlike the ordinary method, which had the computer&#x27;s CPU do the transfer, thus spending at least three quarters of the bus capacity on instruction fetches and only one quarter or less on payload data.

<text>Sam Houston Math, Science, and Technology Center (SHMSTC), formerly known as Sam Houston High School is a high school located in the Hawthorne Place and Timber Garden subdivisions, in Houston, Texas, United States. Sam Houston Math, Science, and Technology Center handles grades nine through twelve and is part of the Houston Independent School District. Before 1955, it was located in Downtown Houston.

Established in 1889, Sam Houston operates the oldest high school newspaper in Texas, the &quot;Aegis&quot;. Additionally, the school boasts the world&#x27;s first female-only military drill squad initially known as the &quot;Black Battalion&quot; but now called the &quot;Tigerettes&quot;.

The school is often referred to simply as &quot;Sam&quot; by students, alumni, and faculty.
Sam Houston High School Baseball Field is located at .

==History==
SHMSTC was founded in Downtown Houston in 1878 as Houston Academy. Since then, it has had several name changes.
* Houston Academy: 1878 to 1881
* Clopper Institute: 1881 to 1886
* Houston Normal School: 1886 to 1895
* Houston High School: 1895 to 1926
* Central High School: 1926 to 1955
* Sam Houston High School: 1955 to 2008 (also referred to as Sam Houston Senior High School)
* Sam Houston Math, Science, and Technology Center: 2008 to now

Until the 1950s, the block bordered by Austin, Capitol, Caroline, and Rusk in Downtown Houston housed the institutions that make up what is now Sam Houston High School. Houston Academy was there in the 1850s. In 1894 Central High School was built. J.R. Gonzales of the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; said that the school was &quot;[d]escribed as one of the finest high schools in this part of the country&quot; and &quot;also attracted negative attention for its incredible cost.&quot; The school had a price tag of $80,000, $1.9 million in 2010 dollars. In March 1919 the school burned down. A new Sam Houston opened two years later.

According to a 1936 &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; article, Sam Houston was to be renamed after Dick Dowling, while the Sam Houston name would be taken by a new high school in southwestern Houston. This did not occur, and the school remained named after Sam Houston.

In 1955, Houston High School moved from its Capitol Street location in Downtown to its current location. The previous Sam Houston High School became the Houston Independent School District administrative headquarters. In July 1970 the first Hattie Mae White Administration Building became the new HISD administrative offices. The Downtown Sam Houston building was demolished. As of 2011, a parking lot owned by HISD now occupies that site. A historical marker is on the south side of that block. In meetings, it had been proposed as a new location for the High School for the Performing and Visual Arts.

Sam Houston has Texas&#x27; oldest high school newspaper, the &quot;Aegis&quot;, started in 1889. In addition, the world&#x27;s first girls&#x27; military drill squad (formerly known as the Black Battalion, but now called the Tigerettes) originated at the school.

Sam Houston was previously reserved for white children, with Hispanics being categorized as white prior to 1970, but it desegregated by 1970.

Today, it has a mostly Hispanic student body.

The names of the individual schools currently occupying the Sam Houston campus were chosen in 2008.

On Saturday February 12, 2011, a state historic marker was dedicated at SHMSTC. The Oran M. Roberts Chapter 440 of the United Daughters of the Confederacy organized the event. Lynna Kay Shuffield, the president of the chapter, wrote a historical narrative about the school and its former location in Downtown.

Renovation of the campus started in late 2016 was completed in 2019.

The Sam Houston Tiger football team holds the distinction of having both the longest active and all time district game losing streak in the entire state of Texas with 100 consecutive losses in district play as of 2022.

The school has been characterized as being a place where discipline issues are rampant, soliciting police involvement. Neighbours allege illegal activity is rampant when students convene after school, and engage the sale and consumption of narcotics, as well as openly carry firearms and engage in shootings. There have been reports of students bringing firearms to campus.

==Rating==

Sam Houston High School, with Jack Yates High School and Kashmere High School, were the three high schools in Houston ISD that were consistently low-performing in test scores from 2001 to 2004. Because of this problem, there were movements to have the state or another organization take over the schools for a period so the test scores will be at acceptable levels. While Yates received an acceptable rating in 2005, SHMSTC and Kashmere continued to receive unacceptable ratings. Abelardo Saavedra, then superintendent of HISD, described SHHS was &quot;close&quot; to receiving an acceptable rating. In August 2006, the school learned that it again got an unacceptable rating from the Texas Education Agency. HISD threatened to close SHHS. SHHS was not closed and it received another unacceptable rating from the TEA in 2007. Houston ISD, stated that the board would consider spending $300,000 to find a method to improve Sam Houston&#x27;s marks from the TEA.

In 2008 the Texas Education Agency Commissioner Robert Scott ordered the closure of SHHS; the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; said that HISD would likely replace 75% of the teachers and change the name of the school. The campus housed Sam Houston Math, Science, and Technology Center beginning 2010–2012 and a ninth grade academy. The administration hopeds that the changes would help the school achieve an acceptable rating.

In 2007, an Associated Press/Johns Hopkins University study referred to Sam Houston as a &quot;dropout factory&quot; where at least 40% of the entering freshman class does not make it to their senior year.

==Student body==
During the 2005–2006 school year, the school had 2,678 students.
* 91% were Hispanic American
* 6% were African American
* 3% were White American
* Less than 1% were Asian American

No Native Americans were enrolled during that school year.

Approximately 89% of the students qualified for free/reduced lunch.

==Neighborhoods served by Sam Houston==
Several areas of Houston outside of the 610 Loop that are far north of Downtown and south of Aldine are zoned to Sam Houston.

Neighborhoods include Melrose Park, Hardy Acres, Hardy Heights, Assumption Heights, Roos Acres, Virginia Acres, Sunnyland Farms, Oakwood, and Northline Terrace.

Two Houston Housing Authority public housing complexes, Heatherbrook Apartments and Oxford Place, are zoned to the school.

Some small sections of unincorporated Harris County are zoned to Sam Houston High School.

<text>Anamur is a municipality and district of Mersin Province, Turkey. Its area is 1,430 km2, and its population is 66,846 (2022). It is the westernmost district of that province, bordering on Antalya Province. Anamur contains Anatolia&#x27;s southernmost point, It is a coastal resort known for its bananas and peanuts.

==Etymology==
Anamur has mutated from the Ancient Greek &quot;Anemourion&quot; (), Latinized as &quot;Anemurium&quot;, meaning &quot;windmill&quot;.

==History==

Anemurium was in an area dominated by the Hittites and the Assyrians.

===Late Bronze===
During the Hittite period in the twelfth century BC, the ruler Tuthalia IV, granted Anemurium to Mattuvata who had taken refuge in his kingdom. Mattuvata took advantage of the Hittites’ weakness, establishing his own kingdom with Anemurium as its capital. His rule extended as far as Afyon, in central Anatolia.

===Iron Age===
At the end of the twelfth century the area was occupied by a nomadic tribe that had come from across the Caucasus mountains. The tribe was called by the ancient Greeks the &quot;Wind people&quot; (Ἀνέμου γένος) after whom the city was named. The exact reasons behind this name are lost in time. The most probable explanation however, is that they worshiped a god of wind, perhaps similar to the Greek Aeolus, as their main deity. Then the city came under the control of the Phoenicians, and later Persians. In 333 BC Alexander the Great brought this coast within his Macedonian Empire, and he was succeeded by Seleucids and then Ancient Romans. The coast was given by Mark Anthony to Cleopatra as a wedding present and Roman coins have been discovered in the course of excavation, dating to the years between Emperors Titus (AD 79–81) and Valerian (AD 253–259).
The Romans were succeeded by the Byzantines.

The city was first occupied by an Islamic Army in the time of Umar ibn al-Khattab.

In XI - XIII centuries it was a part of Cilician Kingdom.

Turkish people reached the city in the eleventh and twelfth centuries. In the thirteenth century, the Karamanids, a clan in Central Anatolia, expanded their borders towards the city, building the Alaköprü bridge (which can still be seen on the road to Ankara) and conquering the city in 1290 from Cilicia Armenians. It was also ruled by Sultanate of Rum between 1075 and 1099 and again between 1228 and 1246.

==Climate==
Anamur has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Csa&quot;) with long, hot and dry summers and cool and rainy winters.

==Anamur today==

The local economy depends on agriculture, especially bananas and strawberries. The summers are hot and this is the only part of Turkey that can sustain the growing of bananas. Greenhouses for growing bananas are found everywhere; other tropical fruits such as papaya, pineapple and avocado are grown here now too. Anamur produces 40% of Turkey&#x27;s strawberries. A traditional local specialty is taro (known locally as &quot;&quot;).

Although there are places of historical interest, long beaches and a clean sea, there is no large scale tourism on this part of the coast, as the coast road in both directions is winding and really slow to drive. But there are major road works now into the direction of Mersin and Antalya. Many kilometers have four lanes now. It takes 5 hours to get here by bus from either Mersin or Antalya. Gazipasa Airport (near Alanya) opened in mid-2011 with Direct charter flights from Amsterdam (Netherlands) take place twice a week. German airliners will fly to this airport in 2012. There are other airports in Antalya and Adana. Although some people from central Anatolia as well as foreigners from Europe (Germans/Austrians/Dutch) have holiday homes here, Anamur itself is a quiet, isolated town with no night life, and in winter is very quiet. Anamur Iskele is a beach resort in this area. A lot of holiday flats and villa&#x27;s are situated near the beach or more inland. Plenty of small and some bigger hotels offer good quality as well as the restaurants near the small boulevard. The beaches are important nesting grounds for the sea turtle caretta caretta and the rocky areas of coastline are inhabited by the Mediterranean monk seal. The Turkish military has a base on the coast. The island of Cyprus is a way offshore and there are no sea crossings to Kyrenia/Girne anymore. The Taşucu Ferryboat companies blocked it. Now Taşucu, 2 hours east from Anamur by car, is the closest ferry terminal offering ferry service to Cyprus. The silhouette of the island of Cyprus is visible if there is no sea fog. It is just 40 miles away from Anamur.

== Sites to visit ==

* Mamure Castle, the medieval castle, well-preserved, about south east of Anamur. Originally built by the Romans in the third or fourth century AD, it was enlarged by the Byzantine Empire and the Crusaders. After the Seljuk Turkish Sultan `Ala&#x27; ad-Din Kay-Qubad captured the castle in 1221, he had it rebuilt in its present form. It consists of three courtyards with 39 towers, surrounded by a moat. In one courtyard there is an ancient mosque with a minaret – built by Mahmud Bey of Karaman in 1300-1308 – which is still open for prayer. There are the ruins of a bathhouse on the opposite side. The castle is in two sections with two lines of ramparts between them, a walkway along the ramparts links the two sides.
* Anemurium, the remains of the ancient city, built between BC and AD 600 southwest of Anamur, on the coast. The stone walls of the city are still partly intact and there are many mosaics. The small theatre or odeion is still largely intact across from the more poorly preserved large theatre and there are several bath buildings. Enough left of the city&#x27;s two-storey Roman bathhouse to give a good impression of what it was in its heyday, with changing rooms, a hot section, a warm section, and a hall with a pool. On the entrance gate a sign written Latin says “Welcome to the baths, have a good bath.” The city had an elaborate water supply system, as illustrated by the remains of the aqueducts. There is also an acropolis containing the ruins of a palace, which had its own private water supply. Around the city walls there are many Roman built tombs, which even have small entrance halls for visitors. The site has been excavated by Canadian teams from the University of Toronto and the University of British Columbia.
* Many caves including Çukurpınar, one of the longest in the world, (1420 m) and Köşekbükü (the air is said to be treatment for asthma or malaria).

<text>Uninett AS is a state-owned company responsible for Norway&#x27;s National Research and Education Network. The organization develops and operates the national research network in Norway. The center of operations in located at Teknobyen Innovation Centre in Trondheim. Uninett has approximately 100 employees. All Norwegian universities and most of the public colleges are connected to Uninett. Any non-commercial research or educational institution such as libraries, archives and schools may be connected for a yearly fee. The CEO of Uninett is Tom Røtting.

== History ==
Uninett was established in 1976 as a project based on funding from the Royal Norwegian Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, and was headquartered at SINTEF in Trondheim. The work was continued as a research project in SINTEF, before Uninett was established as an operating organization for the academic data network in Norway. Uninett has been responsible for the administration of the .no domain on the internet ever since it was established as the top-level domain in 1987. After five years as a project organization, the joint-stock company Uninett AS was founded in 1993.

In 1999, parts of Uninett&#x27;s operations were separated as a separate company, Uninett FAS (Joint Administrative Systems). FAS was to develop technical solutions for efficient operation of administrative services for the higher education sector. In 2002 and 2003, two more subsidiaries were established, Uninett ABC and Uninett Norid. ABC was to use Uninett&#x27;s competence and experience for web development for the other educational institutions in Norway, with emphasis on primary and secondary schools. Norid was to continue the administration of domain names under the .no domain. The subsidiary Uninett Sigma, was established in 2004. Sigma has later changed its name to Uninett Sigma2, and coordinates heavy computing and storage in the higher education sector. 

Following a request from the Ministry of Education and Research to pool the state resources within ICT in basic education, Uninett ABC was separated from the group at the turn of the year 2009/2010. 

Uninett FAS was wound up as a separate company on 31 December 2011.

On February 4, 2021, the Solberg government announced a reorganization of knowledge management under the Ministry of Education. This included merging Uninett into the new agency Sikt, which began operations on January 1, 2022, led by Roar Olsen, former director of Uninett and Unit.

<doc id="779665" wikidata="Q139225" url="?curid=779665" title="Þorgerður Katrín Gunnarsdóttir">
<text>Þorgerður Katrín Gunnarsdóttir (born 4 October 1965) is an Icelandic politician, who has been chairwoman of Viðreisn since 2017.

Þorgerður was deputy chairwoman of the Independence Party from 2005 to 2010. She was the Minister of Education, Science and Culture from 31 December 2003 to 1 February 2009. From 2006, Þorgerður served as acting Prime Minister in the absence of Geir Haarde, including during his 2009 cancer treatment. She left the Independence Party in 2016 and joined the newly founded Viðreisn and became its chairman the following year. She was Minister of Fisheries and Agriculture in 2017.

== Education ==
Þorgerður Katrín took stúdentspróf from Menntaskólanum við Sund in Reykjavík 1985. In her final year she was elected Chairman (Ármaður) of the School Association as the second woman to serve in this position. She subsequently studied law at the University of Iceland and served as a board member in Orator, the Law Students&#x27; Society.

== Business career ==
After graduating with a Master of Law degree in 1993 Þorgerður Katrín began her career as a solicitor in a law firm at Höfðabakki. From 1997 to 1999 she was director of the Social and Current Affairs Department at the National Broadcasting Service. She worked for the Icelandic Chamber of Commerce during her break from politics 2013 to 2016.

== Political career ==
During her time at university she served as a board member in Stefnir, the local Independence Party youth organization in Hafnarfjörður, and vice-president of the executive committee of the Board of Representatives of the Independence Party in Hafnarfjörður.

She was elected to the Althing in 1999 for the constituency of Reykjanes and from 2003 (when the Reykjanes constituency was abolished) for the Southwest constituency.

Þorgerður Katrín was Minister of Education in Geir Haarde&#x27;s government from 2003 to 2009 and functioned as de facto Prime Minister during the crash due to his illness. She served as deputy chairman of the Independence Party 2005 to 2010. Þorgerður Katrín resigned as deputy chairman on 17 April 2010 after being criticised for the handling of her and her husband Kristján Arason&#x27;s debts in Kaupthing Bank, which collapsed in October 2008. She subsequently took leave of absence from parliament and chose not to run for reelection in the 2013 election.

She joined Viðreisn shortly after it was founded in 2016 and was elected to the Althing for them in the 2016 election. Þorgerður Katrín subsequently became Minister of Fisheries and Agriculture in the short-lived government of Bjarni Benediksson. During the 2017 election campaign her party fell below the threshold in multiple polls and its founder Benedikt Jóhannesson therefore decided to step down as chairman in favour of Þorgerður.

===Ministry of Foreign Affairs===
Following the 2024 snap election, her party formed a government with the Social Democratic Alliance and the People&#x27;s Party, in which she was appointed minister for foreign affairs.

== Personal life ==
Þorgerður&#x27;s father was Gunnar Eyjólfsson, an actor, who was born on 24 February 1926 and died on 21 November 2016. Her husband is Kristján Arason who was CEO of Retail Banking at Kaupthing Bank and previously one of Iceland&#x27;s most successful handball players. Þorgerður Katrín and Kristján have three children, Gunnar Ari (1995), Gísli Þorgeir (1999) and Katrín Erla (2003).

At the time of the Icelandic financial crisis her husband owed Kaupthing bank just under 900 million ISK which he had borrowed to purchase shares in the bank. The debt was never repaid, as the board of Kaupthing allowed their executives to transfer their loans and shares into private holding companies a few months before the bank was taken over by the Icelandic authorities. These companies subsequently defaulted.

Þorgerður played handball in the 1980s, first with ÍR and later with FH where she won the Icelandic Cup in 1984. She later played for Gummersbach in Germany. Following her playing career, she became a handball referee. In November 1993, she became the first female referee to referee a match in the Icelandic top-tier women&#x27;s league. In February 1994, she became the first woman to referee in the Icelandic top-tier men&#x27;s league.

<doc id="779669" wikidata="Q3313261" url="?curid=779669" title="Mike Catt">
<text>Michael John Catt OBE (born 17 September 1971) is a South African-born former rugby union player who played for the England national rugby union team. He played professionally for the clubs London Irish and Bath. He earned 75 international caps for England and played in two World Cup Finals, in 2003 (when England won) and 2007. With his appearance in the October 2007 final, at age 36 years 1 month, he became the oldest ever player to play in a Rugby World Cup final. Since 2008, Catt has coached various rugby teams, and from 2019 to 2024 was assistant coach for the Ireland national rugby team. He is currently Attack Coach for the NSW Waratahs.

==Early life==
Catt was born on 17 September 1971 in Port Elizabeth, South Africa. He attended Grey High School in Port Elizabeth until 1989 and represented Eastern Province at rugby union. His mother Anne was English, through whom he qualified to play for England later on, and as a student he toured England. At the time, South Africa was banned from international competition because of the country&#x27;s apartheid policy. He moved to England after leaving school.

==Club career==
Catt joined Bath in 1992 as understudy to Stuart Barnes and made his debut as a 21-year-old against Nottingham R.F.C. later the same year. He started for Bath in the victorious 1998 Heineken Cup Final as they defeated Brive. He had a testimonial year with Bath in 2004, but at the end of the 2003–04 season, Bath decided not to renew his contract and he moved to London Irish.
At the start of the 2007–08 season, he announced he was going to be backs coach for London Irish as well as a player.
Whilst with the Exiles, he enjoyed a fruitful twilight of his career and in May 2006 was named Guinness Premiership Player of the Season.
He is the oldest ever player to play in an English Premiership final (May 2009), aged 37, when he was a player / coach at London Irish.

On 8 May 2010 he played the final competitive club match of his career. Already a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE), he was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2011 New Year Honours for services to rugby.

==International career==
A utility back, Catt played for England at fullback, fly-half, inside centre and even wing, and was part of the England side that won the 2003 Rugby World Cup.

His international debut came against Wales as a replacement for Rob Andrew. His breakthrough performance, however, came in England&#x27;s following match against Canada at Twickenham Stadium, where he came on as an injury-replacement for the incumbent England fullback Paul Hull. England&#x27;s emphatic victory, Hull&#x27;s untimely injury, and Catt&#x27;s impact in the late stages of the game cemented Catt as the new darling of English rugby that season.

Playing at full back, Catt was part of England&#x27;s 1995 Grand Slam winning side, and played in the 1995 Rugby World Cup. In that event, he was memorably &quot;posterised&quot; by a young Jonah Lomu, who ran over him on the way to one of his four tries for the All Blacks in their semifinal win over England.

Catt was called up as an injury replacement in the 1997 British Lions tour to South Africa and played in the final test. At the time the England squad (excluding the substantial number who were with the Lions) were touring Argentina, where Catt was showing excellent form. 

For some of his international career, his inclusion was questioned in some quarters. He was booed when he missed a penalty against Australia in 1998 at Twickenham that could have won the match; Australia won by 1 point. Ultimately though his natural ability as a rugby player has provided more positive career notes than negatives.

In 2000, with the retirement of centres after the 1999 World Cup, his career was revived when he stepped into midfield. Acting as an inside centre, with Jonny Wilkinson his kicking and distribution was responsible for the high try counts of that year.

Catt was selected for the 2001 British &amp; Irish Lions tour to Australia but was injured and replaced by Scott Gibbs.

Catt was selected in the squad that won the 2003 World Cup; a move some saw as the one surprise selection in Clive Woodward&#x27;s squad. After featuring in pool games against Samoa and Uruguay, Catt was brought on as a half time substitute in England&#x27;s quarter-final against Wales, with England trailing 10–3. As a tactical substitution to improve England&#x27;s kicking options and reduce the pressure on Jonny Wilkinson, Catt&#x27;s performance was seen by many as key to England&#x27;s improved second half showing and eventual 28–17 victory. In the semi-final against France, Catt was selected to start at inside centre as a tactical move, and due to his performance against Wales. He played in the extra-time period in the final as a replacement for Mike Tindall, alongside Wilkinson and Will Greenwood in England&#x27;s midfield. Catt made several breaks in the extra-time period, and kicked the ball into touch to bring about the final whistle, ending the game and confirming England as world champions.

In 2006 he received an England recall, making his first Test appearances for two years on the summer tour to Australia, cementing his place in England&#x27;s top ten most capped players. He had been in international exile until he was called up to captain England in the 2007 Six Nations game against France at Twickenham. England, with regular captain Phil Vickery and fly-half Jonny Wilkinson out to injury, won the match 26–18. He also captained England in the Six Nations defeat to Wales at the Millennium Stadium and again in England&#x27;s pre-World Cup defeat to France at Twickenham in August 2007.

Catt was included in Brian Ashton&#x27;s England squad for the 2007 Rugby World Cup, where he helped England reach a second successive final. Catt brought out his own autobiography after the World Cup &quot;Landing on My Feet: My Story&quot;.

Catt confirmed his retirement from international rugby on 27 October 2007, the week after England lost to South Africa in that year&#x27;s World Cup.

==Coaching career==
Catt&#x27;s coaching career began in 2008, where he replaced Brian Smith as attack coach at London Irish; he acted as a player-coach for the 2008–10 season. When he fully retired from playing at the end of the 2009–10 season, he remained with the London Irish set-up until Smith returned to the club in 2012.

In 2012, Catt joined the England national set-up as backs/attack coach for their 2012 tour to South Africa. On 15 December 2015, following the resignation of head coach Stuart Lancaster on 11 November 2015, newly appointed head coach Eddie Jones sacked the whole coaching team.

On 25 March 2016, Catt was announced as part of the newly appointed Italy coaching staff, sharing duties with Conor O&#x27;Shea and Stephen Aboud.

On 24 June 2019, it was confirmed after the 2019 Rugby World Cup, Catt will be joining former England player and coach Andy Farrell&#x27;s coaching team at Ireland; after Joe Schmidt, the current head coach, steps down. Catt said: &quot;I am looking forward to RWC in Japan and seeing the group of players we have here in Italy fulfil their potential and achieve the objectives we have set for ourselves. Obviously it is an honour to be given this future opportunity with Ireland but I will focus on that challenge only after I have given my all for Italy and this group of players&quot;.

As of February 2023, England&#x27;s coaching group during the 2015 Rugby World Cup are all employed in Ireland – Andy Farrell (Ireland head coach), Stuart Lancaster (Leinster Rugby senior coach), Graham Rowntree (Munster Rugby head coach) and Mike Catt (Ireland attack coach).. Catt left Ireland after the 2024 Summer Tour to South Africa. 

On 5th August 2024 it was announced Catt was joining the NSW Waratahs as Attack Coach.

== History ==
The remains of three Dacian fortifications were found in the Jigodin neighbourhood of Miercurea Ciuc; they belong to the Dacian culture of the 1st century. In the Middle Ages it was the capital of &quot;Csíkszék&quot; (Csik seat). Between 1876 and 1918, Csíkszereda was the seat of Csík County of the historical Szeklerland in the Kingdom of Hungary. After the Treaty of Trianon in 1920, it became part of Kingdom of Romania, and was the seat of Ciuc County between 1927 and 1938.

Miercurea Ciuc became part of Hungary again between 1940 and 1944 as a result of the Second Vienna Award. In September 1944, the Romanian Army and the Soviet Red Army captured the town. It was returned to Romania in March 1945, a move confirmed by the Paris Peace Treaties of 1947. Between 1952 and 1960, the town was part of the Magyar Autonomous Region, later named the Mureș-Magyar Autonomous Region between 1960 and 1968. In 1968, Miercurea Ciuc became the county seat of Harghita County.

In the post-World War II period, the town was industrialized; among other projects, a tractor factory, a textile factory and, in the 1960s, a beer factory were built here. The factory is now owned by Heineken. The Ciuc Beer products have gained an increasing popularity in Romania.

==Climate==
Miercurea Ciuc has a cool continental climate (Köppen climate classification: Dfb - without a dry season, although summer is wetter than winter and with a cold summer).
At an average temperature of , July is the hottest month of the year. January has the lowest average temperature of the year: . Between the driest and wettest months, the difference in precipitation is .

Miercurea Ciuc is one of the coldest cities in Romania, with temperatures plummeting towards much more often than anywhere in the country, sometimes as early as November. Snow falls as early as October and as late as April.

== Education ==
In 2001, the Sapientia Transylvanian Hungarian University opened in the building of the former Harghita Hotel. The privately run institution is the first Hungarian university in modern Romania. Other cities in Transylvania also have Sapientia University faculties. Since the university opened, it has been attracting growing numbers of young people and intellectuals.

The Early Music Festival takes place every year in July, from 1980 onwards, mainly in the court of the castle. From 2008 it joins a Summer Music University for early music. Its concerts, held by the most important ensembles for early music in Romania and by the most famous ensembles of Europe, are with free admission.

==Sports==
Miercurea Ciuc is one of the coldest cities in Romania, with winter temperatures often going under , making the city ideal for winter sports. The Vákár Lajos Ice Hall annually hosts the national ice hockey championships, often won by the best-supported local team, HSC Csíkszereda. In 2006 the ice rink hosted the world junior championship in short track speed skating. The only long track speed skating oval in Romania is situated just outside the ice hockey rink.

==Main sights==
Petőfi Street (named after Sándor Petőfi) is the main pedestrian street in the city. It houses numerous restaurants and cafés. Their Székely specialties conjure up images of a small city in Western Europe. During the summer, the street is a popular destination for afternoon and evening recreational activities.

Miercurea-Ciuc is home to the Baroque church at Șumuleu Ciuc and, in the city center, the Mikó Castle, built in a late Renaissance style. The original more decorative castle was raised in the 17th century on the orders of Ferenc Mikó Hídvégi, the personal advisor of Gabriel Bethlen, then prince of Transylvania. Much of the castle was destroyed in 1661 during the Tatar raids, but it was rebuilt at the beginning of the 18th century and was mainly used as a barracks; today it houses the Csík Székely Museum. Behind the castle is a small &quot;Skanzen&quot; (museum village), consisting of a few traditional Csíki houses and wooden gates. Across the road from the castle is the city hall built in 1886, originally the county hall of the old Hungarian Csík County. Beside the castle is the 1904 Courthouse. The latest significant addition to the architectural landscape is the controversial 2001 Millennium Church, designed by Hungarian architect Imre Makovecz and located next to the Baroque Church of the Holy Cross. There is a large Romanian Orthodox church (1929–1939) in the city center. The Orthodox Church has Neo-Byzantine characteristics. It was built in the former administrative center of Miercurea Ciuc, the Castle Square.
==Șumuleu/Csíksomlyó Pentecost Pilgrimage ==

A few kilometres to the east of the city centre is the Franciscan monastery of Șumuleu Ciuc, known in Hungarian as &quot;Csíksomlyó&quot;. A wooden-sculpture figure of the Virgin Mary, known as the Weeping Mary, can be found in the monastery church, which is the destination of a traditional pilgrimage of Roman Catholic Székely held since 1567, called the &quot;Csíksomlyó Pilgrimage&quot; (Romanian: &quot;Pelerinajul de la Sumuleu&quot;; Hungarian: &quot;Csíksomlyói Búcsú&quot;). The event, held on the Saturday before Pentecost, attracts several hundred thousand people every year. The mass for the pilgrims is held on a meadow near the church. This traditional gathering is not only attended by Székely and Csángó Hungarians living in the region, but also by a great number of mostly Hungarian Catholics from other parts of Transylvania region, Hungary and all over the world. Beside its religious importance, the pilgrimage has also become a demonstration of the awareness and solidarity of Catholic Hungarian people living in and outside the historical region of Transylvania.

== Politics ==

Miercurea Ciuc is a municipality with a mayor–council form of government. The mayor and council members are elected to four-year terms. The present mayor is Attila Korodi from the Democratic Alliance of Hungarians in Romania (UDMR/RMDSZ). He was elected in September 2020 with over 73% of the vote. The local council has 19 members with the UDMR holding the majority of the seats:

<text>A skerry ( ) is a small rocky island, or islet, usually too small for human habitation. It may simply be a rocky reef. A skerry can also be called a low sea stack.

A skerry may have vegetative life such as moss and small, hardy grasses. They are often used as resting places by animals such as seals and birds.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;skerry&quot; is derived from the Old Norse &#x27;, which means a small rocky island in the sea (which in turn derives from the Proto-Indo-European root *&quot;sker&quot;-, &quot;cut&quot;, in the sense of a rock cut off from the land). The Old Norse term &#x27; was brought into the English language via the Scots language word spelled or . It is a cognate of the Scandinavian languages&#x27; words for &quot;skerry&quot; – Icelandic, , , , , found also in , , , , and (). In Scottish Gaelic, it appears as &quot;&quot;, e.g. Sula Sgeir, in Irish as &quot;,&quot; in Welsh as &quot;,&quot; and in Manx as &quot;.&quot;

==Formation==
Skerries are most commonly formed at the outlet of fjords where submerged glacially formed valleys at right angles to the coast join with other cross valleys in a complex array. In some places near the seaward margins of fjorded areas, the ice-scoured channels are so numerous and varied in direction that the rocky coast is divided into thousands of island blocks, some large and mountainous, while others are merely rocky points or rock reefs that menace navigation.

==Examples==
The island fringe of Norway is such a group of glacially formed skerries, called a &quot;&quot; (sometimes translated into English as archipelago, but specifically one near the coast of the mainland). Many of the cross fjords are so arranged that they parallel the coast and provide a protected channel behind an almost unbroken succession of rocky islands and skerries. By this channel one can travel through a protected passage almost the entire route from Stavanger to North Cape, Norway. The Blindleia is a skerry-protected waterway that starts near Kristiansand in southern Norway and continues past Lillesand.

The Inside Passage provides a similar route from Seattle, Washington, to Skagway, Alaska, United States. Another such skerry-protected passage extends from the Straits of Magellan north for along the west coast of the South American continent.

The Swedish coast along Bohuslän is likewise guarded by skerries. Even the east coast of Sweden, in the Baltic Sea, has many big (archipelagos), notably Stockholm Archipelago.

The southwestern coast of Finland also has a great many skerries; so many, in fact, that they form an archipelago. This area is experiencing post-glacial rebound that connects the rising islands as they break sea level, revealing till deposits and eventually clay bottoms. The skerries exist as small rocky islands before uplift of adjacent terrain changes the classification of this landform into a tombolo.

In the Russian Federation, the best examples are the Minina Skerries, located in the Kara Sea, in the western shores of the Taymyr Peninsula, and the Sumsky Skerries, located in the White Sea.

The United Kingdom has a large number of skerries including Staple Island (an outer Farne Island) in England; a small rocky outcrop near the Fowlsheugh in northeast Scotland; numerous reefs in the Hebrides such as Dubh Artach and Skerryvore; and The Skerries, located off the Antrim coast of Northern Ireland.

Skerries is the name of a coastal area of Dublin, Ireland, with many skerries offshore, including Rockabill, Shenick Island, Colt Island and St Patrick&#x27;s Island.

<text>Tyree Washington (born August 28, 1976) is a retired American sprinter.

Born in Riverside, California, Washington attended both La Sierra High School and San Bernardino Valley College.

His coach during 2003 was Antonio Pettigrew, who ran alongside Washington, Michael Johnson and Jerome Young in breaking the 4 × 400 metres world record in 1998 with a time of 2:54.20. However, both Young and Pettigrew were later found to have violated doping regulations during their careers, and the IAAF now list the 1993 US quartet of Andrew Valmon, Quincy Watts, Butch Reynolds and Michael Johnson as the world record holders.

At the 2003 World Championships, Washington originally finished first in the 4 × 400 metres relay with Young, Calvin Harrison and Derrick Brew; and second in the 400 m behind Young. Calvin Harrison was found guilty of a doping violation (modafinil) in June 2003, leading to the quartet being stripped of the 4 × 400 m medals. Young was given a lifetime ban for a second offence in 2004; this was applied retrospectively to 1999 (Young&#x27;s first failed test) in 2008, leading to Washington being awarded the gold medal.

His last major win was at the 2006 world indoor championships. He retired in 2008 after failing to qualify at the US Olympic trials.

<text>John Erskine of Carnock (4 November 1695 – 1 March 1768) was a Scottish jurist and professor of Scottish law at the University of Edinburgh. He wrote the &quot;Principles of the Law of Scotland&quot; and &quot;An Institute of the Law of Scotland&quot;, prominent books on Scots law.

==Background==

A member of Clan Erskine, Erskine was the eldest surviving of the six sons and single daughter of John Erskine of Cardross (1662–1743) and his second wife, Anne Dundas (&quot;d&quot;. 1723), heiress of Sir William Dundas of Kincavel. His father made his fortune by joining the army of William of Orange which invaded England in 1688. His grandson was David Erskine, 2nd Lord Cardross.

==Legal career==
Erskine studied law and joined the Faculty of Advocates in 1719 and followed the career of an Advocate for some years, apparently with no obvious distinction. However, the post of Professor of Scots Law at the University of Edinburgh became vacant in 1737, with the death of its incumbent Alexander Bain. The University is a modern (that is, a post-Reformation) foundation, so the appointment of professors lay with the Town Council, which asked the Faculty of Advocates to suggest two names. The second was normally one who was certain to refuse, so the fact that John Erskine was the other nominee shows the esteem in which he was now held in the profession (though no doubt his connections in the Erskine and Dundas families also played their part).

Erskine was allowed £100 per annum along with student fees. Seemingly, his lectures were very popular and he decided to produce an up-to-date text for his students to replace James Dalrymple, 1st Viscount of Stair&#x27;s much used &quot;Institutions of the Law of Scotland&quot;. Erskine wished to expand on the brevity of Mackenzie&#x27; work, fill in gaps and bring it up to date. Erskine&#x27;s own work, &quot;Principles of the Law of Scotland&quot;, bore the imprint of Mackenzie&#x27;s book in its organisation.

Erskine retired from the professorship in 1765 and devoted himself to a new work &quot;An Institute of the Law of Scotland.&quot; He had substantially completed this when he died on 1 March 1768, but had not brought it to full completion. This was done by &quot;a legal friend&quot; in consultation with other advocates. It was obviously part of one of the great Enlightenment Projects - namely the systematisation of the law. This was no mean task, but its success can be judged from the fact that it has never been out of print - though always revised - since its publication in 1773. It had, and has, its critics - there are places where its posthumous publication is all too apparent, and many felt it was far too academical (with a poor feel for the daily practice of law) but it quickly gained a reputation as a reliable reference point and, probably, no book has been cited as frequently in Scottish courts.

==Family==
Erskine was twice married. He married as his first wife Margaret, daughter of James Melville, in 1719. Their son was the influential theologian John Erskine. He married as his second wife Anne, daughter of James Sterling of Keir, in 1729. Several descendants of his son from this marriage, James Erskine, gained distinction, including John Erskine, Sir David Erskine, Sir Arthur Erskine, Sir James Erskine and Sir George Erskine. Erskine died in March 1768, aged 72.

<text>Mehmet Nuri Ersoy (born 1968) is a Turkish businessman and current Turkish Minister of Culture and Tourism.

Ersoy was born in Istanbul, Turkey, in 1968. After completing his secondary education in the Deutsche Schule Istanbul, he studied Business Administration in the English language at Istanbul University. In 1991, he founded the tourism company &quot;Ersoy Turistik Servisleri&quot; (ETS), together with his twin brother Murat. More companies in the tourism branch followed with &quot;Voyage Hotels Group&quot; in 1999, &quot;Didim Tur&quot; as part of the ETS in 2001, and the airline company AtlasGlobal, known as Atlasjet, joining the group of companies in 2004.

On July 9, 2018, the newly elected president of Turkey Recep Tayyip Erdoğan announced his cabinet. Ersoy was appointed Minister of Culture and Tourism.

After the 2025 Kartalkaya hotel fire killed at least 79 people, Ersoy stated that the fire department found &quot;no negative situation regarding fire competence&quot; at the hotel during inspections in 2021 and 2024. Countering Ersoy&#x27;s statements, Bolu city mayor Tanju Özcan said that the fire department had not certified the hotel since 2007 which is when Bolu was an AKP-run municipality, adding that: 

 The Minister is personally responsible for this incident. To evade responsibility, he dares despicably accuse our municipality. The hotel is outside Bolu&#x27;s city limits, so the Ministry of Tourism is in charge. ... We are forced to respond to slander from the incompetent Minister.

<doc id="779692" wikidata="Q316443" url="?curid=779692" title="Mehmet Akif Ersoy">
<text>Mehmet Akif Ersoy (20 December 1873 – 27 December 1936) was a Turkish poet, writer, academic, politician, and the author of the Turkish National Anthem. Widely regarded as one of the premiere literary minds of his time, Ersoy is noted for his command of the Turkish language, as well as his patriotism and role in the Turkish War of Independence.

A framed version of the national anthem by Ersoy typically occupies the wall above the blackboard in the classrooms of every public as well as most private schools around Turkey, along with a Turkish flag, a photograph of the country&#x27;s founding father Atatürk, and a copy of Atatürk&#x27;s speech to the nation&#x27;s youth.

==Biography==
Mehmet Akif Ersoy was born Mehmed Ragîf in Constantinople, Ottoman Empire in 1873 to İpekli Tahir Efendi (1826–1888), an Albanian from the village Shushica near Istog, nahiyah of Ipek and Emine Şerife Hanım with Turkish and Uzbek origins from Bukhara (modern-day Uzbekistan). His father was a tutor at the Fatih Madrasah, at a time when all institutions of the state were in terminal decline, and major crises and regime changes were underway. He grew up in the Fatih district of Constantinople and learned Arabic and memorized the Quran under the mentorship of his father. As he was about to complete his education at the Fatih Merkez Rüştiyesi, his father&#x27;s death and a fire that destroyed his home forced Ersoy to discontinue his education and to start working to support his family. He wanted to start a professional career as soon as possible, and he entered the Mülkiye Baytar Mektebi (Veterinary School), and graduated in 1893.

In the same year, Mehmet Akif Ersoy joined the civil service and conducted research on contagious diseases in various locations in Anatolia. During these assignments, in line with his religious inclination, he gave sermons in mosques, and tried to educate the people and to raise their awareness. Following its success in the Young Turk revolution, he joined the Committee for Union and Progress in 1908. Along with fellow men-of-letters Recaizade Mahmud Ekrem, Abdülhak Hâmid Tarhan and Cenap Şahabettin, which he had met in 1913, he worked for the publication branch of the Müdafaa-i Milliye Heyeti. In his sermons in the mosque, he urged for the union of the different ethnicities in the Ottoman Empire. He was dismissed from his post at the Darülfünün in Constantinople in late 1913 due to his criticism on how the Ottoman Government acted during the Balkan wars. He soon resigned from his government position and other occupations, and wrote poems and articles for the publication Sırat-ı Müstakim.

During the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, Mehmet Akif Ersoy was a fervent patriot. He made important contributions to the struggle for the declaration of the Turkish Republic, and advocated patriotism through speeches that he delivered in many mosques in Anatolia. On 19 November 1920, during a famous speech he gave in Kastamonu&#x27;s Nasrullah Mosque, he condemned the Treaty of Sèvres, and invited the people to use their faith and guns to fight and wage jihad (&quot;holy war&quot;) against the Western colonialists. When the publication Sebilürreşat, which was then operating out of Ankara, published this speech, it spread all over the country and was even made into a pamphlet distributed to Turkish soldiers.
However, Mehmet Akif Ersoy earned himself his significant place in the history of the Republic of Turkey as the composer of the lyrics of the Turkish National Anthem. During the session of 12 March 1921, the Turkish Grand National Assembly officially designated his ten-quatrain poem as the lyrics of the national anthem.

Ersoy moved to Cairo in 1925 and taught the Turkish language at a university there during his 11-year stay. He caught malaria during a visit to Lebanon and returned to Turkey shortly before his death in Istanbul in 1936.

He was interred in the Edirnekapı Martyr&#x27;s Cemetery in Istanbul and was the first person in the history of the Republic of Turkey to have the national anthem performed at his funeral ceremony.

==Legacy==
Mehmet Akif Ersoy is an important national figure in the history of modern Turkey and has left an immortal trace in its history. During the republican period, Mehmet Akif Ersoy taught history and literature at various universities. Ersoy agreed to translate the Quran into the Turkish language for the Directorate of Religious Affairs, but eventually didn&#x27;t deliver his version. He was worried the Kemalists would further separate Islam from the Arabic language, after they had imposed a Turkish call to prayer instead of the one in Arabic. A university in Burdur was named after him. Ersoy&#x27;s portrait was depicted on the reverse of the Turkish 100 lira banknotes of 1983–1989.

==Works==

Mehmet Akif Ersoy had abundant knowledge concerning traditional eastern literature. In addition, he also studied the works of authors such as Victor Hugo, Alphonse de Lamartine, Émile Zola, and Alphonse Daudet.

He is best known for his 1911 work entitled Safahat. This volume is a collection of 44 poems of various lengths by Mehmet Akif Ersoy. The earliest work that appears in this book is dated 1904, but this is unattested, and it is highly likely that the poet, who was 32 on that particular date, composed poems prior to that date.

He is further noted for writing the lyrics of Turkish National Anthem, İstiklâl Marşı (&quot;The March of Independence&quot; in English) – which was adopted in 1921, and is accepted by many Turks as their &quot;National Poet&quot;. The lyrics were originally written as a poem in a collection of his writings. Paradoxically, one of his most famous works, a book called &quot;Safahat&quot;, was not widely read or published until recently. He studied veterinary science at the university.

<text>Giles Fletcher (also known as Giles Fletcher, The Younger; 1586? – 1623 in Alderton, Suffolk) was an English cleric and poet chiefly known for his long allegorical poem &quot;Christ&#x27;s Victory and Triumph&quot; (1610).

==Life==
Fletcher was the younger son of Giles Fletcher the Elder (Ambassador to Russia of Elizabeth I and brother to Bishop Richard Fletcher of London, chaplain to Queen Elizabeth I), and the brother of the poet Phineas Fletcher, and cousin of the dramatist John Fletcher. Educated at Westminster School and Trinity College, Cambridge, he remained in Cambridge after his ordination, becoming Reader in Greek Grammar in 1615 and Reader in Greek Language in 1618. In 1619 left to become rector of Alderton in Suffolk. Fletcher enjoyed the patronage of the Puritan philanthropist Anne Townshend at or before 1623.

His principal work has the full title &quot;Christ&#x27;s Victorie and Triumph, in Heaven, in Earth, over and after Death&quot;, and consists of four cantos. The first canto, &quot;Christ&#x27;s Victory in Heaven&quot;, represents a dispute in heaven between justice and mercy, using the facts of Christ&#x27;s life on earth; the second, &quot;Christ&#x27;s Victory on Earth&quot;, deals with an allegorical account of Christ&#x27;s Temptation; the third, &quot;Christ&#x27;s Triumph over Death&quot;, covers the Passion; and the fourth, &quot;Christ&#x27;s Triumph after Death&quot;, covering the Resurrection and Ascension, ends with an affectionate eulogy of his brother Phineas as Thyrsilis. The meter is an eight-line stanza in the style of Spenser; the first five lines have the rhyme scheme ABABB, and the stanza concludes with a rhyming triplet. Milton borrowed liberally from &quot;Christ&#x27;s Victory and Triumph&quot; in &quot;Paradise Regained&quot;.

<text>Romain de Tirtoff (23 November 1892 – 21 April 1990), known by the pseudonym Erté (from the French pronunciation of his initials: ), was a Russian-born French artist and designer. He worked in several fields, including fashion, jewellery, graphic arts, costume, set design for film, theatre, and opera, and interior decor.

==Early life==
Tirtoff was born Roman Petrovich Tyrtov (Роман Петрович Тыртов) in Saint Petersburg, to a distinguished family with roots tracing back to 1548, to a Tatar khan named Tyrt. His father, Pyotr Ivanovich Tyrtov, served as an admiral in the Russian Fleet. 

Early in life Erte became interested in a career in the theater or dance. But eventually, as he remembered years later, &quot;I came to the conclusion that I could live without dancing but could not give up my passion for painting and design.&quot;

==Career==

&quot;Demoiselle à la balancelle&quot; is one of Erté&#x27;s first sculptures, if not the first; it was made in 1907 at the age of 15 years while he studied in Paris. This work is less precise than his other sculptures, but still Art Nouveau. Erté considered this work so minor and uninteresting that it does not appear in his official biography, but the cartouche on the back indicates &#x27;ERTE PARIS 1907&#x27;, in a triangle.

In 1910–12, Romain moved to Paris to pursue a career as a designer. In Paris he lived with Prince Nicolas Ouroussoff (December 17, 1879 – April 8, 1933) until the prince&#x27;s death in 1933. The decision to move to Paris was made despite strong objections from his father, who wanted Romain to continue the family tradition and become a naval officer. Romain assumed his pseudonym to avoid upsetting his family. He worked for Paul Poiret from 1913 to 1914. In 1915, he secured his first substantial contract with &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot; magazine, and thus launched an illustrious career that included designing costumes and stage sets. During this time, Erte designed costumes for Mata Hari. Between 1915 and 1937, Erté designed over 200 covers for &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;, and his illustrations would also appear in such publications as &quot;Illustrated London News&quot;, &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot;, &quot;Ladies&#x27; Home Journal&quot;, and &quot;Vogue.&quot;

Erté is perhaps most famous for his elegant fashion designs which capture the art deco period in which he worked. One of his earliest successes was designing apparel for the French dancer Gaby Deslys who died in 1920. His delicate figures and sophisticated, glamorous designs are instantly recognisable, and his ideas and art still influence fashion into the 21st century. His costumes, programme designs, and sets were featured in the Ziegfeld Follies of 1923, many productions of the Folies Bergère, Bal Tabarin, Théâtre Fémina, Le Lido, and George White&#x27;s Scandals. On Broadway, the celebrated French chanteuse Irène Bordoni wore Erté&#x27;s designs.

In 1925, Louis B. Mayer brought him to Hollywood to design sets and costumes for the silent film &quot;Paris&quot;. There were many script problems, so Erté was given other assignments to keep him busy. Hence, he designed for such films as &quot;Ben-Hur&quot;, &quot;The Mystic&quot;, &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;The Comedian&quot;, and &quot;Dance Madness&quot;. In 1920 he designed the set and costumes for the film &quot;The Restless Sex&quot; starring Marion Davies and financed by William Randolph Hearst.

By far, his best-known image is &quot;Symphony in Black&quot;, depicting a somewhat stylized, tall, slender woman draped in black holding a thin black dog on a leash. The influential image has been reproduced and copied countless times.

Erté continued working throughout his life, designing revues, ballets, and operas. He had a major rejuvenation and much lauded interest in his career during the 1960s with the Art Deco revival. He branched out into the realm of limited edition prints, bronzes, and wearable art.

Two years before his death, Erté created seven limited edition bottle designs for Courvoisier to show the different stages of the cognac-making process, from distillation to maturation. In 2008, the eighth and final set of the remaining Erte-designed Courvoisier bottles, containing Grande Champagne cognac dating back to 1892, was released and sold for $10,000 apiece.
His work may be found in the collections of several well-known museums, including the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA); as well, a sizable collection of work by Erté can be found at Museum 1999 in Tokyo.

<doc id="779698" wikidata="Q344758" url="?curid=779698" title="Gig Young">
<text>Gig Young (born Byron Elsworth Barr; November 4, 1913 – October 19, 1978) was an American stage, film, and television actor.

He was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performances in &quot;Come Fill the Cup&quot; (1952) and &quot;Teacher&#x27;s Pet&quot; (1959), finally winning that award for &quot;They Shoot Horses, Don&#x27;t They?&quot; (1969).

In 1978, Young murdered his 31-year-old wife three weeks after their wedding before turning the gun on himself and committing suicide at the age of 64.

==Early life==
Born Byron Elsworth Barr in St. Cloud, Minnesota, he and his older siblings were raised by his parents, John and Emma Barr, in Washington, D.C., where his father was a reformatory chef. He attended McKinley High School, where he developed his first love of acting appearing in school plays.

==Career==

===Theatre===
After graduating from high school he worked as a used car salesman and studied acting at night. He moved to Hollywood when a friend offered him a ride if he would pay for half the gas. After some amateur experience he applied for and received a scholarship to the acclaimed Pasadena Playhouse. &quot;I had two jobs to support me, never rested, but it was great training and when I landed the part at Warner Bros., I was ready for it&quot;, he said.

Barr made early appearances in &quot;Misbehaving Husbands&quot; (1940), credited as &quot;Byron Barr&quot;, and in the short &quot;Here Comes the Cavalry&quot; (1941). While acting in &quot;Pancho&quot;, a south-of-the-border play by Lowell Barrington, he and the leading actor in the play, George Reeves, were spotted by a Warner Brothers talent scout. Both actors were signed to supporting player contracts with the studio.

===Warner Bros. as Byron Barr===
His early work was uncredited or as Byron Barr (not to be confused with another actor with the same name, Byron Barr) or Byron Fleming. It included appearances in &quot;Sergeant York&quot; (1941), &quot;Dive Bomber&quot; (1941), &quot;Navy Blues&quot; (1941), and &quot;One Foot in Heaven&quot; (1941). Barr had a bigger part in a short, &quot;The Tanks Are Coming&quot; (1941) which was nominated for an Oscar.

He was also in &quot;They Died with Their Boots On&quot; (1941) and &quot;You&#x27;re in the Army Now&quot; (1941). He had an uncredited bit part in the 1942 Bette Davis film &quot;The Man Who Came to Dinner&quot;, saying, in his distinctive voice, &quot;How&#x27;s the ice?.&quot; He was also in &quot;Captains of the Clouds&quot; (1942), and &quot;The Male Animal&quot; (1942). Warners loaned him to Fox for &quot;The Mad Martindales&quot; (1942).

===&quot;The Gay Sisters&quot; and becoming Gig Young===
In 1942, six months into his Warner Brothers contract, he was given his first notable role in the feature film &quot;The Gay Sisters&quot; as a character named &quot;Gig Young&quot;. Preview cards praised the actor &quot;Gig Young&quot; and the studio determined that &quot;Gig Young&quot; should become Barr&#x27;s stage and professional name. About the name change, Young later admitted to having &quot;some hesitancy... but I weighed the disadvantages against the advantages of having it stick indelibly in the mind of audiences. There&#x27;d be no confusion with some other actor called Gig.&quot; His parts began to get better: a co-pilot in Howard Hawks&#x27;s &quot;Air Force&quot; (1943); and Bette Davis&#x27; love interest in &quot;Old Acquaintance&quot; (1943).

Young took a hiatus from his movie career and enlisted in the U.S. Coast Guard in 1941 where he served as a pharmacist&#x27;s mate until the end of World War II, serving in a combat zone in the Pacific. On Young&#x27;s return from the war, he was cast as Errol Flynn&#x27;s rival for Eleanor Parker in &quot;Escape Me Never&quot; (1947). The film was directed by Peter Godfrey who also helmed Young and Parker in &quot;The Woman in White&quot; (1948), after which Young left Warners, unhappy with his salary.

===Post-Warner Bros.===
Young began freelancing at various studios, eventually obtaining a contract with Columbia Pictures before returning to freelancing. He came to be regarded as a popular and likable second lead, playing the brothers or friends of the principal characters. In a 1966 interview he said, &quot;Whenever you play a second lead and lose the girl, you have to make your part interesting yet not compete with the leading man. There are few great second leads in this business. It&#x27;s easier to play a lead – you can do whatever you want. If I&#x27;m good it always means the leading man has been generous.&quot;

Young was Porthos in Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer&#x27;s successful &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; (1948). Then he supported John Wayne in &quot;Wake of the Red Witch&quot; (1948) at Republic Pictures and Glenn Ford in Columbia&#x27;s &quot;Lust for Gold&quot; (1949). Also at Columbia, he supported Rosalind Russell and Robert Cummings in &quot;Tell It to the Judge&quot; (1949). Young had his first lead in a feature film at RKO in &quot;Hunt the Man Down&quot; (1951), a film noir. He went back to support roles for &quot;Target Unknown&quot; (1951) a war film at Universal; and &quot;Only the Valiant&quot; (1951), a Gregory Peck western.

Young began to appear in TV on shows such as &quot;The Silver Theatre&quot;, &quot;Pulitzer Prize Playhouse&quot; and &quot;The Bigelow Theatre&quot;.

===&quot;Come Fill the Cup&quot; and first Oscar nomination===
Young received critical acclaim for his dramatic work as an alcoholic in the 1951 film &quot;Come Fill the Cup&quot; with James Cagney, back at Warner Brothers. He was nominated for both an Oscar and Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor. Young later gave Cagney a great deal of the credit for his performance.

===Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer===
Young supported Van Johnson in the MGM comedy &quot;Too Young to Kiss&quot; (1952). The studio liked Young so much that he was signed to a term contract. After supporting Peter Lawford in &quot;You for Me&quot; (1952), Young was promoted by MGM to leading man for &quot;Holiday for Sinners&quot; (1952). The film was a box office failure, however. More popular was &quot;The Girl Who Had Everything&quot; (1953) where Young lost Elizabeth Taylor to Fernando Lamas.

MGM loaned Young to Republic Pictures for &quot;City That Never Sleeps&quot; (1953), where he had the starring role as a disillusioned cop. In 2008, Martin Scorsese selected this film to open a Republic Pictures retrospective that he curated at New York&#x27;s Museum of Modern Art, citing the movie&#x27;s amazing energy and creativity. Back at MGM, Young had the lead in a 3-D Western, &quot;Arena&quot; (1953), which was a hit. He was a second male lead again – to Michael Wilding – in the Joan Crawford vehicle &quot;Torch Song&quot; (1953). Quickly after finishing filming both &#x27;Arena&#x27;, where he had the Top Leading Role, and &#x27;Torch Song&#x27;, where he had the 3rd Leading Role, both completed in first half of 1953, on June 22, 1953, the trade magazine Hollywood Reporter told its readers that MGM had just assigned its Actor Gig Young to the 4th Leading Role in their future successful Family Viewing hit film of 1954, Gypsy Colt. Likely noticing that his MGM roles were now moving in the wrong direction, he left MGM. &quot;I played terrible parts there&quot;, he later said. He decided to relocate to New York.

===Broadway===
Young said he rarely performed in comedies, until he appeared on Broadway in &quot;Oh Men! Oh Women!&quot; (1953–54) which ran for 382 performances. Young recalled, &quot;It was a big smash hit but never helped change my type in Hollywood for quite some time. I still played dull, serious parts like Errol Flynn&#x27;s brother. Yet on Broadway, they offered me nothing but comedies.&quot;

During this time Young appeared on TV shows shot in New York such as &quot;Robert Montgomery Presents&quot;, &quot;Schlitz Playhouse&quot;, &quot;Producers&#x27; Showcase&quot; and &quot;Lux Video Theatre&quot;.

===Return to Warner Bros.===
When &quot;Oh Men! Oh, Women&quot; ended its run, Young went back to Warner Bros where he lost Doris Day to Frank Sinatra in &quot;Young at Heart&quot; (1955). In 1955, Young became the host of &quot;Warner Bros. Presents&quot;, an umbrella title for three television mini-series (&quot;Casablanca&quot;, &quot;Kings Row&quot;, and &quot;Cheyenne&quot;) that aired during the 1955–56 season on ABC Television. He played a supporting role the same year in the Humphrey Bogart thriller &quot;The Desperate Hours&quot; and lost Katharine Hepburn to Spencer Tracy in &quot;Desk Set&quot; (1957). He continued to appear on TV in such shows as &quot;The United States Steel Hour&quot;, &quot;Climax!&quot;, &quot;Goodyear Theatre&quot; and &quot;Studio One in Hollywood&quot; (the latter starring Elizabeth Montgomery, whom he married in 1956).

Young is remembered by many James Dean fans for the &quot;driving safety&quot; interview made shortly before Dean&#x27;s fatal car accident in September 1955. Dean wears a cowboy outfit as he was taking a break during shooting of the 1956 film &quot;Giant&quot; while playing with a lasso and counseling the audience to drive carefully.

===&quot;Teacher&#x27;s Pet&quot; and second Oscar nomination===
George Seaton saw Young on Broadway and cast him as a tipsy but ultimately charming intellectual in &quot;Teacher&#x27;s Pet&quot; (1958) starring Clark Gable and Doris Day. It earned Young a second Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination. Young was promptly reunited with Day in an MGM comedy, &quot;The Tunnel of Love&quot; (1958), though still the second male lead – after Richard Widmark. Also at MGM, he appeared with Shirley MacLaine and David Niven in &quot;Ask Any Girl&quot; (1959). Young had a change of pace in a Clifford Odets drama starring Rita Hayworth, &quot;The Story on Page One&quot; (1959), although he was still second male lead, to Anthony Franciosa.

On TV he appeared in a 1959 Twilight Zone episode titled &quot;Walking Distance&quot;. He had some excellent parts – all male leads – in TV adaptations of &quot;The Philadelphia Story&quot; (1959), &quot;The Prince and the Pauper&quot;, &quot;Ninotchka&quot; (1960) and &quot;The Spiral Staircase&quot; (1961). He guest-starred on &quot;The Alfred Hitchcock Hour&quot; and &quot;Kraft Suspense Theatre&quot;.

Young returned to Broadway with &quot;Under the Yum-Yum Tree&quot; (1960–61) which ran for 173 performances, originating the role later played by Jack Lemmon on film. Some announced film projects fell through, so he instead played second lead in another movie with Day, &quot;That Touch of Mink&quot; (1962), as Cary Grant&#x27;s best friend. He was Elvis Presley&#x27;s boxing promoter in &quot;Kid Galahad&quot; (1962), and lost Sophia Loren to Anthony Perkins in &quot;Five Miles to Midnight&quot; (1962). After supporting Kirk Douglas in &quot;For Love or Money&quot; (1963), he was given a rare male lead in MGM&#x27;s &quot;A Ticklish Affair&quot; (1963), as Shirley Jones&#x27; love interest.

===&quot;The Rogues&quot;===

On the 1964–65 NBC TV series &quot;The Rogues&quot;, he shared appearances on a rotating basis with David Niven and Charles Boyer, although in practice Young helmed the greater number of episodes since Niven and Boyer were both busy with other film projects. The charming con man he played on that show was one of Young&#x27;s favorite roles, and raised his profile with the television viewing public. He later said, &quot;I loved it, the public loved it, only NBC didn&#x27;t love it.&quot; Despite its popularity and critical acclaim, &quot;The Rogues&quot; was cancelled after one 30-episode season.

During the filming of &quot;The Rogues&quot;, Young&#x27;s alcoholism was starting to take a toll on his career; Larry Hagman had to be brought in as a substitute for the final two episodes. After &quot;The Rogues&quot; ended, Young went on tour as Harold Hill in &quot;The Music Man&quot;, his first stage musical. He supported Rock Hudson in the comedy &quot;Strange Bedfellows&quot; (1965), had the lead in a British horror film, &quot;The Shuttered Room&quot; (1967), and starred in a TV mystery movie, &quot;Companions in Nightmare&quot; (1968). He enjoyed a successful return to Broadway in the hit comedy from Britain &quot;There&#x27;s a Girl in My Soup&quot; (1967–68), which ran for 322 performances.

===&quot;They Shoot Horses Don&#x27;t They?&quot;===
Young won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role as Rocky, the alcoholic dance marathon emcee and promoter in the 1969 film &quot;They Shoot Horses, Don&#x27;t They?&quot;. Young had not been the choice of director Sydney Pollack, but his casting was mandated by the head of ABC Pictures, Marty Baum, Young&#x27;s former agent. According to his fourth wife, Elaine Williams, &quot;What he was aching for, as he walked up to collect his Oscar, was a role in his own movie—one that they could finally call &#x27;a Gig Young movie.&#x27; For Young, the Oscar was literally the kiss of death, the end of the line.&quot;

Young himself had said to Louella Parsons, after failing to win in 1951, &quot;so many people who have been nominated for an Oscar have had bad luck afterwards.&quot; However, when he finally won Young called the Oscar &quot;the greatest moment of his life.&quot;

Young had a good part in the popular &quot;Lovers and Other Strangers&quot; (1970), also from ABC Pictures, and toured in &quot;Nobody Loves an Albatross&quot; (1970) in summer stock. He was in the TV movie &quot;The Neon Ceiling&quot; (1971), his performance earning him an Emmy nomination. A profile of Young around this time said &quot;The well-established image of the boozy charmer Gig plays on and off camera fools you. That armour surrounds an intense dedicated artist, constantly involved with his profession.&quot;

===Career decline===
Young&#x27;s worsening alcoholism began to cost him roles. Originally cast as The Waco Kid, Young collapsed on the set of the comedy film &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot; during his first day of shooting due to alcohol withdrawal, and was fired by director Mel Brooks. Brooks replaced him with Gene Wilder. Young had a supporting role in &quot;Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia&quot; (1974), directed by Sam Peckinpah, and was in a horror movie, &quot;A Black Ribbon for Deborah&quot; (1974). He was in the TV movies &quot;The Great Ice Rip-Off&quot; (1974) and &quot;The Turning Point of Jim Malloy&quot; (1975); Peckinpah used him again in &quot;The Killer Elite&quot; (1975). In 1976, Aaron Spelling cast Young as the offscreen Charlie in his new action show &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;. However, Young&#x27;s alcoholism prevented him from performing the role, even only as a voice actor, and he was replaced at the last minute by John Forsythe.

Young was one of several names to star in &quot;The Hindenburg&quot; (1975). He guest-starred on &quot;McCloud&quot;, had a support role in &quot;Sherlock Holmes in New York&quot; (1976) and was a semi-regular in the TV series &quot;Gibbsville&quot; (1976–77), a spinoff from the TV movie &quot;The Turning Point of Jim Malloy&quot;. His last role was in the 1978 revised version of &quot;Game of Death&quot;, which was released nearly six years after the film&#x27;s original star, Bruce Lee, died during production in 1973.

==Personal life==
Young was married five times. His first marriage to Sheila Stapler, a Pasadena Playhouse classmate, lasted seven years, ending in 1947. &quot;We were too young, it couldn&#x27;t have lasted&quot;, he later said. In 1950, he married Sophie Rosenstein, the resident drama coach at Paramount, who was several years Young&#x27;s senior. She was soon diagnosed with cancer and died just short of two years after the couple&#x27;s wedding. For a time, he was engaged to actress Elaine Stritch.

Young met actress Elizabeth Montgomery after she appeared in an episode of &quot;Warner Bros. Presents&quot; in 1956, and the two married later that year. In 1963, Montgomery divorced Young because of his alcoholism. Young married his fourth wife, real estate agent Elaine Williams, nine months after his divorce from Montgomery was final. Williams was pregnant at the time and gave birth to his only child, Jennifer, in April 1964. After three years of marriage, the couple divorced. During a legal battle over child support with Williams, Young denied that Jennifer was his biological child. After five years of court battles, Young lost his case.

On September 27, 1978, Young, age 64, married his fifth wife, a 31-year-old German magazine editor named Kim Schmidt. He met Schmidt in Hong Kong while working on &quot;Game of Death&quot;.

==Death==
On October 19, 1978, three weeks after his marriage to Schmidt, the couple were found dead in their apartment at The Osborne in Manhattan. Police surmised that Young shot his wife and then himself. Young was found face down on the floor of his bedroom, a .38 caliber Smith &amp; Wesson pistol in his hand. His wife was found face down beside him. Young had apparently shot himself in the mouth and the bullet exited the back of his head. His wife had been shot in the back of the head. No suicide note was found. 

A motive for the murder of his wife, and Young&#x27;s suicide, was never discovered. Police said there was a diary opened to September 27 with &quot;we got married today&quot; written on it. The couple appear to have died around 2:30 p.m., when shots were heard by a building employee, and their bodies were found five hours later. Young was at one time under the care of the psychologist and psychotherapist Eugene Landy, who later had his professional California medical license revoked amid accusations of ethical violations and misconduct with patients. Author Stephen King wrote the short story &quot;1408&quot; inspired by King&#x27;s stay in room 1402 at New York&#x27;s Park Lane Hotel, which was misrepresented by a hotel bellman as the location of Young&#x27;s murder/suicide.

Young&#x27;s remains were taken to Beverly Hills for his funeral service, but he was later buried in the Green Hill Cemetery in Waynesville, North Carolina, under his birth name, Byron E. Barr, in his family&#x27;s plot along with his parents, siblings and an uncle. Young&#x27;s will, which covered a $200,000 estate, left his Academy Award to his agent, Martin Baum, and Baum&#x27;s wife, Bernice. Young&#x27;s daughter Jennifer launched a campaign in the early 1990s to get the award back from his agent, and struck an agreement that she would get the award back upon the agent&#x27;s death, which occurred in 2010. For his contribution to the television industry, Young has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6821 Hollywood Boulevard.

<text>Henry Lee Lucas (August 23, 1936 – March 12, 2001), also known as the Confession Killer, was an American convicted serial killer. Lucas was convicted of murdering his mother in 1960 and two others in 1983. He rose to infamy as a claimed serial killer while incarcerated for these crimes when he falsely confessed to approximately 600 other murders to Texas Rangers and other law enforcement officials. Many unsolved cases were closed based on the confessions and the murders officially attributed to Lucas. He was convicted of murdering eleven people and condemned to death for a single case with a then-unidentified victim, later identified as Debra Jackson. 

An investigation by the &quot;Dallas Times-Herald&quot; showed that it was impossible for Lucas to have committed many of the murders he confessed to. While the Rangers defended their work, a follow-up investigation by the Attorney General of Texas concluded Lucas was a fabulist who had falsely confessed. Lucas&#x27;s death sentence was commuted to life in prison in 1998. Lucas later recanted his confessions as a hoax with the exception of his confession to murdering his mother. He died of congestive heart failure in 2001.

Lucas&#x27;s case damaged the reputation of the Texas Ranger Division, caused a re-evaluation in police techniques, and created greater awareness of the possibility of false confessions. Investigators did not consider that the apparently trivial comforts such as steak dinners, milkshakes, and access to television in return for &quot;confessions&quot; to crimes of extreme seriousness might encourage prisoners such as Lucas, who had little to lose, to make false confessions. Investigators also let Lucas see the case files so he could &quot;refresh his memory&quot;, making it easy to seemingly demonstrate knowledge of facts that only the perpetrator would know. The police also did not record their interviews, making it impossible to know for sure how much information interviewers gave Lucas unprompted.

== Early life and criminal history ==
===Background===
Henry Lucas was born the youngest of nine children on August 23, 1936, in a one-room log cabin in Blacksburg, Virginia to parents Nellie Viola Lucas (1888–1960) and Anderson Lucas (1901–1951), a double amputee. Lucas&#x27;s father earned the nickname &quot;No Legs&quot; after losing both of his legs in a freight train accident. &quot;My daddy didn&#x27;t do anything,&quot; Lucas later said. &quot;He just sold pencils.&quot; When Lucas was eight, he was beaten by his mother about the head with a wooden plank which caused him to spend three days in a coma. Lucas developed an infection in his left eye at age ten, when one of his brothers struck him with a knife. His mother ignored the injury for several days until a teacher swiped him over his eye with a steel-tipped ruler and the eyeball burst; it had to be surgically removed and it was replaced with a glass prosthetic.

Lucas&#x27;s mother was a prostitute who would force her son to watch her having sex with her clients. &quot;First thing I can remember was when my mom was in bed with another man in the house, and she made me watch it,&quot; Lucas said. &quot;I just couldn&#x27;t stand there and watch. I had to turn my back and walk out of the house, and after I did that, she beat me, &#x27;cause I didn&#x27;t watch it.&quot; Nellie would also make him cross-dress in public, purportedly so she could later pimp him out to men and women alike. Eventually, Lucas&#x27;s schoolteachers complained about the cross-dressing, and a court order put an end to it. Despite this, Nellie continued to abuse and torment Lucas by shooting and killing a mule given to him by an uncle and proceeding to beat him because she had to pay to have the animal carcass removed. Lucas was frequently bullied as a child and later cited the mass rejection by his peers as a cause for his misanthropy. Commenting on his childhood, Lucas stated:
Lucas&#x27;s father died of pneumonia after spending the night outside in the cold. While in the sixth grade, Lucas dropped out of school and ran away from home, drifting around Virginia. As an adolescent, Lucas began an incestuous sexual relationship with his half-brother and started engaging in bestiality, often capturing small animals and performing sexual acts on them before killing them. On June 10, 1954, Lucas was convicted on over a dozen counts of burglary in and around Richmond, Virginia, and was sentenced to four years in prison. He escaped in 1957, was recaptured three days later, and was subsequently released on September 2, 1959.

===First murder===
Lucas claimed to have committed his first homicide in 1951, when he strangled 17-year-old Laura Everlean Burnsley. Burnsley disappeared from a bus stop in Lynchburg, Virginia, in March 1951; Lucas confessed to her murder on February 15, 1984. According to Lucas, he picked her up near Lynchburg, Virginia, and after she refused his sexual advances and resisted an unsuccessful rape attempt, he killed her and buried her body in a secluded wooded area near Harrisburg, Virginia. &quot;It scared me quite a bit,&quot; Lucas said. &quot;Because the first girl I killed was when I was 14 years old. I wanted to try the sex I&#x27;d been watching.&quot; &quot;I got to playing too rough with her,&quot; he said. &quot;The pressure of seeing my mom hit and my emotions more or less took over, and I couldn&#x27;t quite handle it.&quot; As with most of his confessions, Lucas later retracted this claim. Burnsley has never been found.

=== Matricide ===
In late 1959, Lucas traveled to Tecumseh, Michigan to live with his half-sister, Opal Retta Jennings. Around this time, he was engaged to marry a pen pal, Stella Curtis, with whom he had corresponded while incarcerated. When Lucas&#x27;s mother, 71-year-old Nellie Viola Lucas, visited him for Christmas, she disapproved of her son&#x27;s fiancée and insisted he move back to Blacksburg, Virginia to take care of her as she grew older. When he refused, they argued repeatedly. These arguments escalated until January 11, 1960 when she struck him over the head with a broom, at which point he stabbed her in the neck. Lucas then fled the scene. &quot;I was pretty well drunk when she started arguing with me, wanting me to go back to live with her to Virginia, but I told her I didn&#x27;t want nothing to do with her,&quot; Lucas remembered. He elaborated:

Opal returned later and discovered their mother alive on the bedroom floor, but in a pool of her own blood. She called an ambulance, but it arrived too late. The official police report stated that Lucas&#x27;s mother died of a heart attack precipitated by the assault. Lucas was soon arrested in Ohio on the outstanding Michigan warrant. He claimed to have killed his mother in self-defense; Lucas said, &quot;I&#x27;ve got gashes in the back of my head. I&#x27;ve got black and blue marks on my body from being beaten every day. If I didn&#x27;t do something she wanted, I got beaten.&quot; But his claim was rejected and he was sentenced to up to 40 years imprisonment in Jackson State Penitentiary in southern Michigan for second-degree murder. Lucas attempted suicide several times by slashing his wrists and stomach with a razor. 

Henry was then transferred to the Ionia State Hospital where he was subjected to electric shocks, behavior therapy, and heavy doses of anti-depressants. Henry spent four years at Ionia State Hospital before returning to prison in 1966, where a social worker met Lucas while he was incarcerated and described him as &quot;a very inadequate individual with feelings of insecurity and inferiority.&quot; After serving 10 years in prison, he was released on June 3, 1970, due to prison overcrowding.

== Murders ==
===Claimed killing spree===
In December 1971, he was charged and sentenced to four or five years in prison for attempting to abduct a 15-year-old girl at gunpoint. He was also in violation of his probation by having a handgun in his possession. While serving his sentence for the crime, he established a relationship with a family friend and the widow of a cousin, Betty Crawford, who had written to him. After being released from prison in August 1975, he moved to Port Deposit, Maryland where he married Crawford and moved in with her and her two daughters in Pennsylvania on December 5, 1975, and began working at a mushroom farm. Their marriage ended in 1976 when Betty accused Lucas of molesting her daughters. 

Lucas then went to Jacksonville, Florida in 1976 and ended up at a soup kitchen where he met Ottis Elwood Toole, a part-time transvestite, and struck up a friendship with him. In 1978, he moved in with Toole&#x27;s mother in Springfield, Florida and became close to Toole&#x27;s niece, 11-year-old Frieda Lorraine &quot;Becky&quot; Powell, who had a mild intellectual disability and had escaped from a juvenile detention center. A period of stability followed, with Lucas and Toole working together in a roofing company between 1979 and 1981. 

According to Lucas, during this time they engaged in a multi-state killing spree in which they targeted hitchhikers, sex workers, and migrants. He also claimed that Toole enjoyed crucifying their victims, then barbecuing and eating them. After their arrest, they were caught discussing cannibalism over a prison phone. &quot;Remember how I liked to pour some blood out of them?&quot; Toole asked Lucas. &quot;Some tastes like real meat when it&#x27;s got barbecue sauce on it.&quot; Powell would also occasionally travel with the men as well and may have even helped Lucas and Toole lure potential victims. When interviewed about his crime spree, Lucas stated:

=== Arrest, confession to murders of Powell and Rich ===
On January 20, 1982, Lucas convinced Powell to run away with him to avoid child welfare authorities and they lived on the road, eventually traveling to California, where an employer&#x27;s wife asked them to work for her infirm mother, 82-year-old Katie Pearl &quot;Kate&quot; Rich. Three weeks later, Kate Rich went missing and so did Lucas and Powell. Apparently, her relatives had called him out for not holding up his end of the bargain, accusing them of failing to do their jobs and writing checks on Rich&#x27;s bank account. 

While hitchhiking, Lucas and Powell were picked up by the minister of a Pentecostal religious commune called The House of Prayer, located in Stoneburg, Texas. 
Believing Lucas and the 15-year-old Powell were a married couple, the minister found Lucas a job as a roofer while allowing the couple to stay in a small apartment on the commune where they even attended church services. However, Powell became argumentative and homesick for Florida; when she turned up absent, Lucas claimed that she left at a truck stop in Bowie, Texas.

On June 10, 1983, Lucas was arrested on charges of unlawful possession of a firearm by Texas Ranger Phil Ryan. While in jail he wrote a letter to the sheriff; 
&quot;I have killed for the past 10 years and no one will believe me. I cannot go on doing this. I also killed the only girl I ever loved.&quot; 

Later, he confessed to the murders of Powell and Rich, and led the police to their purported remains, although forensic evidence alone was inconclusive and the coroner stopped short of positively identifying either of them. 

Lucas claimed he had lured Powell to an isolated field in Denton, Texas on August 23, 1982, stabbed her in the chest, engaged in necrophilia with her corpse before he dismembered and decapitated her post-mortem, and scattered her body pieces. 

In Ringgold, Texas on September 16, 1982, he reportedly lured Rich to join him in a search for Becky on a camping ground. He then stabbed her in the chest, carved an inverted cross on her chest post-mortem, and engaged in necrophilia with her corpse before stuffing her body into a drainage pipe. 

Lucas&#x27;s participation in the investigation would serve to boost his credibility in later confessions to other crimes. Lucas later denied involvement, but the consensus is that he did murder Powell and Rich.

=== False confession spree ===
In November 1983, Lucas was transferred to a jail in Williamson County, Texas. He reported that he attempted suicide after receiving rough treatment by the inmates, and claimed that police stripped him naked, denied him cigarettes and bedding, held him in a cold cell, mutilated his genitalia, and did not allow him to contact an attorney. After four days in jail, Lucas pleaded guilty to the two murders of Powell and Rich in court but then also claimed to have committed over a hundred additional murders. In interviews with law enforcement personnel, Lucas confessed to numerous additional unsolved killings. It was thought that there was positive corroboration with Lucas&#x27;s confessions in twenty-eight unsolved murders, so the Lucas Task Force was established by James B. Adams, the director of the Texas Department of Public Safety. 

The task force officially cleared hundreds of previously unsolved homicides as a result of Lucas&#x27;s confessions. Lucas received preferential treatment that was extremely lax for someone supposedly thought to be a mass murderer. He was frequently taken to restaurants and cafés, rarely handcuffed, allowed to wander police stations and jails, and he even knew codes for security doors. Later attempts at determining Lucas&#x27;s involvement in his confessed crimes were complicated when it was discovered he had been given access to information in the files of cases he was confessing to. There were suggestions that the interview tapes showed that Lucas would read the reactions of those interviewing him and alter what he was saying, thereby making his confessions more consistent with facts known to law enforcement.

===Discredited===
Journalist Hugh Aynesworth and others investigated the veracity of Lucas&#x27;s claims for articles that appeared in &quot;The Dallas Times Herald&quot;. They calculated that Lucas would have had to use his 13-year-old Ford station wagon to cover in one month to have committed the crimes police attributed to him. After the story appeared in April 1985 and revealed the flawed methods of the task force, law enforcement opinion began to turn against their claims that crimes had been solved.

The bulk of the Lucas Report was devoted to a detailed timeline of Lucas&#x27;s claimed murders. The report compared his claims to reliable, verifiable sources for his whereabouts; the results often contradicted his confessions, thus casting doubt on his participation in most of the crimes he had confessed to. Texas Attorney General Jim Mattox wrote that &quot;when Lucas was confessing to hundreds of murders, those with custody of Lucas did nothing to bring an end to this hoax... we have found information that would lead us to believe that some officials &#x27;cleared cases&#x27; just to get them off the books.&quot; 

Lucas&#x27;s case damaged the reputation of the Texas Ranger Division, caused a re-evaluation in police techniques, and created greater awareness of the possibility of false confessions. Investigators did not consider that the apparently trivial comforts such as steak dinners, milkshakes, and access to television in return for &quot;confessions&quot; to crimes of extreme seriousness might encourage prisoners such as Lucas, who had little to lose, to make false confessions. Investigators also let Lucas see the case files so he could &quot;refresh his memory&quot;, making it easy to seemingly demonstrate knowledge of facts that only the perpetrator would know. The police also did not record their interviews, making it impossible to know for sure how much information interviewers accidentally gave Lucas unprompted.

=== Incarceration and death ===

Lucas was ultimately convicted of 11 homicides including those of his mother along with Powell and Rich. He had been sentenced to death for one, a then-unidentified woman dubbed as &quot;Orange Socks&quot;, whose body was found in Williamson County on Halloween 1979, despite a time sheet recording his presence at work in Jacksonville, Florida on that day. Lucas was granted a stay on his death sentence after it was discovered that details in his confession came from the case file which he had been given to read. The sentence was commuted to life imprisonment in 1998 by then-Governor George W. Bush. On March12, 2001, at 11:00p.m., Lucas was found dead in prison from congestive heart failure at age 64. He is buried at Captain Joe Byrd Cemetery in Huntsville, Texas.

== Victims ==
===Differing opinions===
Lucas&#x27;s credibility was damaged by his lack of precision: he initially admitted to having killed sixty people, a number he raised to over one hundred victims, which police accepted, and then to a figure of six hundred that led to him not being taken seriously. DNA evidence has verified that Lucas did not kill twenty of his supposed victims. Of more than three thousand murder cases in which he was a suspect, police believed more than two hundred cases were committed by him. However, he remained publicized as America&#x27;s most prolific serial killer, despite denials such as stating, &quot;I am not a serial killer.&quot;

Some continue to believe, nonetheless, that Lucas was responsible for a massive number of killings. Criminologist Eric Hickey cites an unnamed &quot;investigator&quot; who interviewed Lucas several times and concluded that he had probably killed about forty people. Such assertions were given little credence, with the lawmen involved refusing to corroborate these claims. An experienced Texas Ranger to whom Ryan&#x27;s team allowed access to Lucas said that although it was obvious to him that Lucas often lied, there was an instance where he demonstrated guilty knowledge. &quot;I remember him trying to cop to one he didn&#x27;t do, but there was another murder case where I&#x27;ll kiss your butt if he didn&#x27;t lead us right to the deer stand where the murder took place. Ain&#x27;t no way he could&#x27;ve guessed that, and I damn sure didn&#x27;t tell him. I think he did that one.&quot; Other Rangers had similar experiences with Lucas.

===Convicted===
In total, Lucas was convicted of 11 murders including the deaths of Viola Lucas, Becky Powell, and Kate Rich. The eight other victims that Lucas was convicted of murder for are as follows:
* 26-year-old schoolteacher Linda Jane Phillips disappeared on August 8, 1970, in the Dallas suburb of Richardson, Texas, while returning from a party to her parents&#x27; home in Kaufman County. Her mutilated body was found on August 10. She sustained twenty-six stab wounds and had been sexually abused. Lucas confessed to the murder and claimed he forced Phillips&#x27;s car off the road at about 2:30 a.m. Lucas then allegedly forced her into his car at gunpoint, made her disrobe, and then stabbed her in the throat, chest, and stomach. 
* The body of Patrolman Clemmie Everett Curtis, 30, was found on August 3, 1976, handcuffed near his patrol car in a wooded area just outside of the Huntington, West Virginia, city limit. He had been shot through the chest once. Lucas confessed that he and Toole had killed Curtis. 
* Lillie Pearl Darty, 18, accepted a ride with Lucas on November 11, 1977, at a gas station in Harrison County and later was sexually assaulted and shot in the head. Her decomposing body was found three weeks later in a wooded area north of Marshall, Texas.
* 23-year-old Debra Louise Jackson, informally known as &quot;Orange Socks&quot; when unidentified, is believed to have been murdered on October 30 or 31, 1979, in Georgetown, Texas. Her body was found naked, except for the pair of orange socks from which the nickname was derived. She had been strangled, and was believed to have died only hours before the discovery.
* On April 26, 1981, Lucas allegedly broke into the apartment of 17-year-old babysitter Dianna Lynn Bryant in Brownfield, Texas, with the intent of robbing it. He then took a knife he carried to cut loose the cord on a vacuum cleaner and used it to strangle Bryant. Dianna&#x27;s father was satisfied with Lucas&#x27;s confession and the case was closed.
* Glenna Fay Biggers, 65, was found by a neighbour on December 20, 1982, in Hale County, Texas. A butcher knife had been thrust into her stomach and a fork into her throat. According to Lucas, he broke into her home, killed her, and then stole $180. 
* Laura Marie Purchase, 26, was discovered on March 17, 1983, dead in a burning wooded area near League Line Road in Montgomery County, Texas. Purchase had been reported missing from Houston on March 5. An autopsy determined that she had been sexually assaulted and strangled. In 2008, DNA testing ruled Lucas out as suspect in Purchase&#x27;s case. In 2021, another man was charged with her murder.
* On April 16, 1983, 16-year-old Laura Jean Donez skipped school in Houston, Texas, but was never seen again. On April 18, 1983, an oilfield worker spotted a fire burning in a wooded area near a logging road in Montgomery County, Texas. Donez had been strangled, raped, beaten about the head, and her body burned after death. Lucas confessed to Donez&#x27;s murder and was able to lead police to where her body was discovered.

===Suspected===
Although almost all of Lucas&#x27;s confessions have been discredited or entirely proven false, both he and Toole still remain credible suspects in the deaths of several women based on compelling circumstantial evidence. Cases in which they are both seen as viable suspects are as follows:
* On June 27, 1977, detectives responded to a wooded area off Old Union Church Road outside of Townsend, Delaware, after the remains of 50-year-old Marie Petry Heiser were discovered in an open field. She had suffered blunt-force trauma to her head and had fought back against her assailant. Lucas lived in Elkton, Maryland at the time near to where Heiser&#x27;s remains were found. Investigators also found that writings Lucas made had many similarities to the crime scene.
* 45-year-old Stella Ellen McLean disappeared from a restaurant in Scottsbluff, Nebraska, on February 7, 1978. On April 15, 1978, her headless body was discovered near Interstate 25 in Platte County, Wyoming. She had been raped and strangled; her head was never recovered. In September 1984, Jim Larson, an investigator for the Scotts Bluff County Sheriff&#x27;s Department in Nebraska, questioned Lucas about Stella&#x27;s murder. Larson asked deceptive questions to test Lucas, but apparently, Lucas offered compelling testimony to support his claims of killing McLean.
* 40-year-old Janet Lee Callies was last seen at the Sandbar, a bar near Interstate 80 in Grand Island, Nebraska, on November 15, 1978. In 1984, Lucas confessed to Callies&#x27;s murder and stated that he and Toole had strangled Callies and buried her body &quot;somewhere between the north edge of Grand Island and the South Dakota border.&quot; Lucas managed to recall personal details about Callies, such as how she had three children.
* 19-year-old Cheryl Anne Scherer was last seen working her shift at the Rhoades Rhodes Pump-Ur-Own Station self-service gas station in Scott City, Missouri, on April 17, 1979, at 11:45 a.m. Toole and Lucas both admitted to authorities that they had killed and abducted a young woman nearby about the time that Scherer vanished. Scherer was the only girl reported missing in the region at the time, despite Lucas&#x27;s claims to the contrary when police showed him a photo of her. Even though it was proved that Toole&#x27;s niece and nephew, as well as Lucas and Toole, were present in Scott City, Missouri at the time of Scherer&#x27;s disappearance, there was never enough evidence to bring charges against them.
* A highway worker discovered the body of an unidentified woman on October 29, 1981 in Iola, Texas. Her cause of death was blunt force trauma to the head. The victim, known as the Grimes County Jane Doe, was also wrapped in a plastic bag. Lucas confessed to her murder, stating that he drove the victim to the area from Durham, North Carolina, and claiming that her name may have been &quot;Cheryl.&quot; He then strangled her while Toole beat her in the head with a tire iron. He was able to lead police to the area in which her body had previously been found.

==Media==
There have been several books on the Lucas case. Four narrative films have been made based on his confessions: &quot;Confessions of a Serial Killer&quot; (1985); &quot;&quot; (1986), in which the title role is played by Michael Rooker; &quot;&quot; (1996); and the 2009 film &quot;Drifter: Henry Lee Lucas&quot;. Two documentary films were released in 1995: &quot;The Serial Killers&quot; and &quot;Henry Lee Lucas: The Confession Killer.&quot; In 2019, Netflix released a five-part serialized documentary &quot;The Confession Killer&quot; focusing on the far-reaching consequences of the investigation. &quot;Wild Crime: Murder in Yosemite&quot; season two (2022) focuses on Lucas.

<doc id="779715" wikidata="Q4823128" url="?curid=779715" title="Stephen F. Austin High School (Houston)">
<text>Stephen F. Austin High School is a secondary school located at 1700 Dumble Street in Houston, Texas, United States. The school handles grades nine through twelve and is a part of the Houston Independent School District. In 2013, the school was rated &quot;Met Standard&quot; by the Texas Education Agency.

The school, named after Stephen F. Austin, the &quot;Father of Texas&quot;, is located in the East End. The neighborhood was developed in the 1920s, and the school&#x27;s Art Deco architecture reflects this. The school has HISD&#x27;s magnet program for Teaching Professions. The Port of Houston Maritime Academy was scheduled to come to Austin High School in August 2009.

The school is about southeast from Downtown Houston.

==History==
Austin was first built in 1936. Austin was previously reserved for white children (Hispanics being categorized as white prior to 1970) but it desegregated by 1970. The three-story building was designed for every room to have windows for ventilation in Houston&#x27;s humid climate. Air conditioning was installed circa 1970. Among other notable architectural features, Austin had a swimming pool in the basement below the gymnasium.

In 1984 Mimi Swartz of the &quot;Texas Monthly&quot; wrote that Austin High School was &quot;not considered particularly dangerous&quot; in comparison to other HISD schools.

=== 21 Jump Street Incident ===
By 1989 the school had experienced issues related to student absenteeism and dropouts. On Monday, October 16, 1989 two students, 16-year-old Alma Rincon and 18-year-old-Cedric Smith watched an episode of &quot;21 Jump Street&quot; about students who protest and walk out of school. The following day the two discussed the show during an American history class; Austin High School had a lack of textbooks and scheduling conflicts. The students decided that a protest could help change this. Before the walkout, the administration learned that there would be a walkout on Monday, October 23 and principal Otila Urbina warned students to not participate. The organizers tricked the administration by rescheduling the walkout to Friday. On Friday, October 20, 1989 up to 1,000 students walked out of class and talked to reporters. One week later, on Friday October 27, HISD superintendent Joan Raymond announced that Urbina would be reassigned to administrative duties. After the incident, students received additional books. Macario Garcia, a spokesperson for the students, said that he believed that school officials may &quot;review everything but are not going to take immediate action.&quot;

=== 1990s ===
In September 1991, Austin was one of 32 HISD schools that had capped enrollments. The school was filled to capacity and excess students had to attend other schools. In December 1991, Austin was one of the largest high schools in Texas, with 2,669 students. Due to the overcrowding, by that month Houston ISD trustees approved a plan to open a new high school in 1995 instead of in 1997.

In 1992 superintendent Frank Petruzielo asked Jose Treviño to become the principal of Austin High. Carol E. Vaughn of the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; stated that for Treviño, who had served as principal of others schools, &quot;it was the &quot;principalship&quot; at Austin High School where he emblazoned his name.&quot;

In 1996 the school used eighteen temporary buildings, and the enrollment had increased to 3,000.

By 1997, the new high school had not been constructed; area community leaders and parents anticipated the construction of César Chávez High School, as Austin and Milby were still overcrowded. Prior to 1997 residents zoned to Furr High School also had the option to attend Austin and Milby high schools; in 1997 the school district canceled the option.

=== 2000s ===
In the fall of 2000, Chávez opened and took most of Milby&#x27;s traditional neighborhoods. In turn Milby absorbed some students from Austin. Areas that were zoned to Austin in 1998 were rezoned to Milby, In turn, Austin absorbed areas previously zoned to Furr and Yates high schools.

In 2002 Treviño was promoted to the southeast district regional superintendent. In 2003 Linda Llorente, an Austin High alumna, became the principal.

In 2005, the administration decided to open a new music program. A new Band Director was hired to build a new band which was given the nickname &quot;Sonic Boom&quot;. In 2010, the Sonic Boom was selected out of more than 80 applicants nationwide to compete in the Home Depot Center Battle of the Bands, sponsored by Vh1 Save the Music Foundation. At the end of the day, the Grand Champion of the Battle of the Bands in Los Angeles was Stephen F. Austin&#x27;s Sonic Boom who also headlined the HEB Holiday (Thanksgiving Day) Parade in Downtown.

In 2007, a Johns Hopkins University study commissioned by the Associated Press included Austin in a &quot;dropout factory&quot; list of 42 Houston-area high schools; a &quot;dropout factory&quot; school is where at least 40% of the entering freshman class does not make it to their senior year.

In the 2000s, property values around the school increased. This created the large student population decrease as gentrification made the surrounding area more expensive. This led to the demotion of the school from 5A to 4A as per the University Interscholastic League ranking.

By 2018 a reconstruction project began where much of the building, except for historically significant sections, was rebuilt. The Temporary Learning Center (TLC) accommodated students during the process.

As of 2020 Orlando Reyna was the principal.

==Academic performance==

In 1995 the Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills (TAAS) passing rate was 19.8%. In the 1990s the school&#x27;s reported dropout rate declined from 14% to 0.3%, and because of that the Texas Education Agency gave the school an &quot;exemplary&quot; rating. In 2001 the TAAS passing rate was 90.5% and the official dropout rate was about 12%. The TEA gave Austin High a &quot;low-performing&quot; rating in late 2003. By 2003 accusations had been made that Austin High&#x27;s dropout rate data was falsified.

==Demographics==
For the 2022-23 school year: 
*African American: 5.8%
*Hispanic: 92.6%
*White: 1.0%
*American Indian: 0.0%
*Asian: 0.1%
*Pacific Islander: 0.1%
*Two or More Races: 0.4%
*Economically Disadvantaged: 97.4%

In 2007 the school had 304 12th grade (senior students). That year a counselor estimated that 250 of them had permission to leave Austin High during the school day, and many of those students had outside jobs.

In 1940 less than 1% of the student body of the school was of Mexican origin.

==Campus==
In 2012 Richard Connelly of the &quot;Houston Press&quot; ranked Austin as the most architecturally beautiful high school campus in Greater Houston. Connelly said that &quot;Another in the classic mode, with an entrance that just says &quot;high school.&quot; And we don&#x27;t mean the gate.&quot;

==Neighborhoods served by Austin==
Several areas inside the 610 Loop that are east of Downtown, including the area known as the East End, are zoned to Austin; several East End subdivisions such as the Second Ward, Eastwood, Idylwood, East View, Riverview, Forest Hill, Hampshire Oaks, Simms Woods, Houston Country Club Place, Woodleigh, Sunnylan, Broadmoor, Central Park, and some of Magnolia Park, are zoned to Austin. In addition a section of East Downtown is zoned to Austin.

==Academics==
The school is ranked 72 by U.S News in the state due to its offered AP courses and supportive staff.

===Magnet program===
Dr. Ronald McIntire and Dr. Mark Ginsburg developed Austin&#x27;s magnet program, the High School for Teaching Professions. Due to a lack of Hispanic teachers in HISD at the time, HISD established the magnet program at Austin High School in order to have more Hispanic teachers in the schools; in 1984 7% of HISD&#x27;s teachers were Hispanic even though 31% of its students were Hispanic. As of 1984 the magnet program required four years of English, three years each of social studies, science, and mathematics, and two years each of a foreign language and physical education. The classes sizes had numbers of students below the HISD class average of 30.

In 1984 Swartz reported that in the magnet school many students chose not to take liberal arts electives but instead those related to vocational studies, such as speech class. Swartz also reported difficulties with trying to balance out the demands of brighter students with those who had more difficulty with the course material. She concluded that &quot;there are signs that all is not well&quot;.

==Dress code==
As of 2015 Austin students no longer wear uniforms.

Austin High School students previously wore school uniforms. As of the 2009-2010 school year each student wore a polo shirt of a color depending on the student&#x27;s year of estimated graduation. Freshmen wore black, Sophomores wore blue, Juniors wore maroon, and Seniors wore green. All students had khaki bottoms.

The Texas Education Agency specified that the parents and/or guardians of students zoned to a school with uniforms may apply for a waiver to opt out of the uniform policy so their children do not have to wear the uniform; parents must specify &quot;bona fide&quot; reasons, such as religious reasons or philosophical objections.

==Transportation==
Houston ISD provides school buses for students who live more than two miles away from the school or who have major obstacles between their houses and the school. Students are eligible if they are zoned to Austin or are in the Austin magnet program.

Three METRO bus stops (Polk Street @ Dumble Street, Telephone Road @ Dumble Street, and Ernestine Street @ Coyle Street) are located near the school. Bus line 36 stops at Polk @ Dumble, and bus line 40 stops at Telephone @ Dumble. Bus line 42 stops at Ernestine @ Coyle. Telephone @ Dumble is the stop closest to the school.

<text>St John Greer Ervine (28 December 1883 – 24 January 1971) was an Irish biographer, novelist, critic, dramatist, and theatre manager. He was the most prominent Ulster writer of the early twentieth century and a major Irish dramatist whose work influenced the plays of W. B. Yeats and Sean O&#x27;Casey. &quot;The Wayward Man&quot; was among the first novels to explore the character, and conflicts, of Belfast.

==Biography==
Ervine was born as John Greer Irvine in Ballymacarrett in east Belfast, in the shadow of the shipyards, to deaf-mute parents. Every member of his family had been born in County Down for 300 years. His father, a printer, died soon after his birth and the family moved in with Ervine&#x27;s grandmother who ran a small shop. Ervine became an insurance clerk in a Belfast office at the age of 17 and shortly after he moved to London.

In London Ervine met George Bernard Shaw and began to write journalism as well as his first plays, adopting the name St John Ervine &quot;as more fitting for his ambitions&quot;. His first full-length play, &quot;Mixed Marriage&quot;, was produced by Dublin&#x27;s Abbey Theatre in 1911. It had several runs as one of the Abbey&#x27;s most profitable plays. Yeats praised Ervine&#x27;s plays for depicting the real life experienced by the people of the north of Ireland as Synge&#x27;s work had done for those of the west of Ireland.

In June 1913, Ervine was standing beside Emily Davison at The Derby and witnessed her being fatally injured by King George V&#x27;s horse.

In 1915 Yeats appointed Ervine as the Abbey&#x27;s general manager. Ervine&#x27;s tenure was a commercial success. The production of several successful comedies restored the theatre&#x27;s finances. But Ervine&#x27;s demands on the actors, combined with his outrage at the Easter Rising of 1916, led to open conflict. Ervine resigned from the Abbey in 1916 and enlisted in the Household Battalion. On 1 January 1917 he was commissioned as a temporary second lieutenant in the second reserve of the Royal Dublin Fusiliers, and was transferred to a regular battalion on 1 August 1917. After being wounded in Flanders one of his legs had to be amputated. He was promoted to lieutenant on 1 February 1919 and relinquished his commission due to his wounds on 5 December 1919.

Through the 1920s and 1930s Ervine wrote drawing-room comedies that were box-office successes. Several had West End runs of up to two years, among them &quot;Anthony and Anna&quot; (1926) and &quot;The First Mrs. Fraser&quot; (1929). In 1936 Ervine&#x27;s &quot;Boyd&#x27;s Shop&quot;, &quot;the play that defined Northern Irish drama for decades&quot;, was produced. Arnold Bennett hailed him as a playwright &quot;unequalled&quot; in England, with plays that &quot;combined great skill, fine ideals, and perfect sincerity with immense popular success&quot;. From 1919 to 1939 Ervine was also a theatre reviewer for &quot;The Observer&quot;.

Alongside his plays Ervine wrote a number of novels. Of these the most successful, &quot;The Wayward Man&quot; (1927), was reprinted in 1936 as one of Allen Lane&#x27;s first Penguin paperbacks (Penguin 32). He also produced several major biographies, including of the Unionist leaders Craigavon and Carson, of William Booth, of Oscar Wilde and of George Bernard Shaw. &quot;Bernard Shaw: His Life, Work, and Friends&quot; (1956) was awarded the James Tait Black Memorial Prize in 1956.

Explaining the determination of his character Robert &quot;Darkie&quot; Dunwoody in his novel, &quot;The Wayward Man&quot;, to leave the city despite the ties that bind him, Ervine wrote &quot;I have never met anyone who was not depressed by Belfast&quot;. Sean O&#x27;Faolain accounted Ervine &quot;the only Belfast writer who has tried at all to bottle the &#x27;realism&#x27; of the city&quot;. He suggested, however, that, &quot;lacking poetry&quot;, Ervine &quot;only succeeded in making it taste like reboiled mutton gone cold&quot;.

As &quot;part of what might be called a programme for the reinstatement of certain neglected Northern Irish novelists&quot;, &quot;The Wayward Man&quot; was republished in 2014. Patricia Craig proposes that it is an exemplar of &quot;a kind of Edwardian realism nurtured in the shade of Arnold Bennett and John Galsworthy, and embodying a distinctive Ulster Protestant strain&quot;.

By the 1940s St John Ervine was Northern Ireland&#x27;s leading writer but also a controversial figure with “a remarkable antipathy to southern Ireland&quot;.

== Personal life ==
In 1911 Ervine married Leonora Mary Davis (d. 1965), a teacher, actress and playwright from Birmingham. They settled in Seaton, Devon in the 1940s.

Ervine died on 24 January 1971 in Fitzhall, Iping, Sussex.

In 1862, the railway between Helsinki and Hämeenlinna was opened, which quickly brought industry to agricultural Kerava; the carpentry factory in Kerava was established in 1908, and the wood industry became an important factor in the development of the town.

However, from 1954 onwards, the entire Korso was annexed to the then Helsinki Rural Municipality. During the peak periods of the late 1960s and 1970s, the population almost doubled due to immigration and good transport connections, and new suburbs were created in Kurkela, Kilta and Untola.

<text>Kerimäki is a former municipality of Finland. It was consolidated with the town of Savonlinna on January 1, 2013.

It is located in the province of Eastern Finland and is part of the Southern Savonia region. The municipality was unilingually Finnish.

The Kerimäki Church, built between 1844 and 1847, is the largest wooden church in the world ( long, wide and high). There are over 3,000 seats inside the structure, which can hold 5,000 people at a time.

Lake Puruvesi, which lies less than a kilometre away from the church, is one of the clearest lakes in the world. The water is pure enough to be potable.

<doc id="779724" wikidata="Q57755" url="?curid=779724" title="Matthias Erzberger">
<text>Matthias Erzberger (20 September 1875 – 26 August 1921) was a politician of the Catholic Centre Party, member of the Reichstag and minister of finance of Germany from 1919 to 1920.

Erzberger was first elected to the Reichstag of the German Empire in 1903. During the early years of World War I he supported Germany&#x27;s position enthusiastically but later became a leading opponent of unrestricted submarine warfare and proposed the successful 1917 Reichstag peace resolution, which called for a negotiated peace without annexations. In November 1918 he headed the German delegation to negotiate an end to the war with the Allies and was one of the signatories of the Armistice of 11 November 1918.

He was elected to the Weimar National Assembly in 1919 and served as minister of portfolio in Philipp Scheidemann&#x27;s cabinet. When Scheidemann resigned as minister president in protest over the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, Erzberger – who supported the treaty because he saw no alternative to it – became finance minister and vice-chancellor under Gustav Bauer. He pushed through the &quot;Erzberger reforms&quot; that transferred supreme taxing authority from the states to the central government and redistributed the tax burden more towards the wealthy. Under attack for corruption from a member of the right-wing German National People&#x27;s Party, he was forced by the Centre Party to resign in March 1920 but was elected to the Reichstag of the Weimar Republic later in the year.

Both his role in ending the war and his financial policies earned him the enmity of the political right. On 26 August 1921, he was assassinated by two members of the right-wing terrorist group Organisation Consul.
==Early career==

He was born on 20 September 1875 in Buttenhausen (today part of Münsingen) in the Kingdom of Württemberg, the son of Josef Erzberger (1847–1907), a tailor and postman, and his wife Katherina (née Flad; 1845–1916). In his early life he gained massive weight, which he lost in the course of thirty years. He attended the seminaries in Schwäbisch Hall and Bad Saulgau, where he graduated in 1894, and started a career as a primary school (&quot;Volksschule&quot;) teacher. While teaching, he also studied constitutional law and economics at Fribourg, Switzerland. Two years later, he became a journalist working for the Catholic Centre party&#x27;s publication in Stuttgart, where he also worked as a freelance writer. Erzberger joined the Centre Party and was first elected to the German Reichstag in 1903 for Biberach. By virtue of unusually varied political activities, he took a leading position in the parliamentary party. He became a specialist in colonial policy and financial policy, contributing to the financial reforms of 1909. In 1912, Erzberger became a member of the leadership of the parliamentary party. He supported a significant military build-up in Germany in the years 1912–13.

In 1900, he married Paula Eberhard, daughter of a businessman, in Rottenburg am Neckar. They had three children (a son and two daughters).

==World War I==

Like many others in his party, he initially supported Germany&#x27;s involvement in World War I and was carried along by a wave of nationalistic enthusiasm. In September 1914, he wrote a memorandum in which he laid out his view on Germany&#x27;s war aims, advocating the annexation of Belgium and parts of Lorraine, among other territories. By this stage he was secretary to the Reichstag&#x27;s Military Affairs Committee, and the &quot;right-hand man&quot; of the Chancellor Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg. He was in charge of foreign propaganda, especially relating to Catholic groups, and set up a system of information gathering using the resources of the Holy See and of the Freemasons. Erzberger was also involved in some diplomatic missions. For example, he worked with Bernhard von Bülow in a failed attempt to keep Italy from entering the war in 1915. He wrote letters to leading military authorities, later published, with extravagant plans for German annexations. Seen as an opportunist, he was said to have &quot;no convictions, but only appetites&quot;.

On 25, 27, and 28 November, Erzberger spoke on modernizing the administration. He won widespread socialist support for attempting through the Bundesrat to protect the civil rights of citizens. In December 1916 he successfully used the Budget Committee of the Reichstag to navigate the Auxiliary Services Act into law. It required all men not in the military or working in certain areas of the economy to be employed in a job vital to the war effort and, in return, recognized trade unions as equal negotiating partners with employers.

Apart from Karl Liebknecht (a member of the Reichstag for the Social Democratic Party (SPD) until 1916), Erzberger was the only German politician who is known to have tried to stop the Armenian genocide, the persecution of the Greeks, and the Assyrian genocide in the Ottoman Empire. He travelled to Constantinople in February 1916 for negotiations with the Young Turks rulers allied with Germany, met Enver Pasha and Talaat Pasha on 10 February 1916, and at their request prepared a memorandum on the measures to be taken in favour of Christians in Turkey. It explicitly referred only to Catholic Armenians and was never answered or considered by the Ottoman government. The general failure of his mission in Turkey filled Erzberger with indignation and disappointment.

By 1917, with the armies stalemated on both fronts, Erzberger changed his political stance, becoming one of the leading opponents of unrestricted submarine warfare. In April 1917 he met a Russian envoy in Stockholm to discuss peace terms. He expounded his views on the war in a speech in the Reichstag on 6 July in which he called on the government to renounce territorial ambitions and conclude a negotiated end to the war. The speech was remarkable at the time in the way he carefully delineated the extent of German military weakness. That same day, leading deputies from the Majority Social Democrats (MSPD), the Centre, and the liberal Progressive People&#x27;s Party agreed to form an Inter-Party Committee as a coordinating body, which was seen as the prelude to the parliamentarization of Germany and accordingly interpreted by conservatives as the &quot;beginning of the revolution&quot;. The Committee, with the help of Ebert&#x27;s oratory, galvanized moderate opponents of the &#x27;war party&#x27; and served to pacify the working class. 

On 9/10 July Bethmann Hollweg obtained a promise from the Crown Council and Emperor Wilhelm II that equal manhood suffrage would be introduced in Prussia after the war to replace the Prussian three-class franchise which apportioned votes based on taxes paid. The promise became known to the public on 12 July.

Erzberger&#x27;s actions during the first half of July helped to bring about the fall of Bethmann Hollweg. He hoped to have him replaced by Bernhard von Bülow. Instead, Georg Michaelis, the largely unknown and party-unaffiliated nominee of General Erich Ludendorff, became chancellor.

On 19 July Erzberger called a vote on the Reichstag peace resolution which embodied all the points he had made in his speech, calling for a peace without annexations or indemnities, freedom of the seas and international arbitration. The resolution passed 212 to 126. It received the support of Chancellor Michaelis, but when he spoke of supporting it in his inaugural address, he added the proviso &quot;as I interpret it&quot;, which he then used as an excuse to ignore it. Erzberger nevertheless succeeded in his main purpose in proposing the resolution, namely to persuade the Social Democrats to continue voting for war loans while a negotiated peace was sought. At the same time, the annexationists, especially those of the nascent German Fatherland Party, began a &quot;wild agitation&quot; against Erzberger. The fact that he succeeded in creating a majority consisting of the Centre, the Progressive Party, and the Social Democrats is considered one of his greatest achievements, since this represented a fundamental upheaval in German domestic politics. Parliament had become involved in matters of foreign policy and warfare that under the constitution were reserved for the emperor, the military leadership and the government. Erzberger emerged from the proceedings surrounding the peace resolution as Germany&#x27;s most powerful deputy. His attempt to end the war with an amicable peace contributed to his great popularity, especially among the underprivileged classes. On the other hand, he became the most hated man among large sections of the upper classes and in circles that did not want to renounce annexations and rejected demands for a change in Germany&#x27;s social and political structure.

That same July, at a closed conference in Frankfurt, Erzberger revealed the content of a pessimistic secret report from Austria-Hungary&#x27;s Foreign Minister, Count Ottokar Czernin, to Austrian Emperor Karl I regarding the state of the war effort. The report also came into the possession of the Allies. Although it has never been proven that Erzberger was responsible, it led to the extreme right seeing him as a traitor to his country.

In March 1918, Erzberger was the most influential supporter in government of the candidacy of Wilhelm, Duke of Urach for the proposed throne of the stillborn Kingdom of Lithuania. Both were Catholics from Württemberg. He tabled a question in the Reichstag on 3 March to General Wilhelm Groener on whether a memorandum had been prepared for the reform of the War Contracting System.

Erzberger&#x27;s political attempts at peace failed, but his public attack on the war effort and dissemination of information about the fragility of the German military created a climate in which the government found it increasingly difficult to maintain the belief that the war could be won. When, towards the end of the war, the German Navy mutinied at Kiel, the sailors informed their officers that what they wanted was &quot;Erzberger&quot;, by then synonymous with &quot;peace&quot;. 

==Signing the Armistice==

On 3 October 1918, Erzberger entered the government of Prince Max von Baden as a state secretary (equivalent to a minister) without a specified portfolio. On 6 November 1918, a reluctant Erzberger was appointed chairman of the Armistice Commission sent to negotiate with the Allies in the Forest of Compiègne. Prince Max supposed that Erzberger, as a Catholic civilian, would be more acceptable to the allies than a Prussian military officer; in addition, he believed that Erzberger&#x27;s reputation as a man of peace was unassailable.

Against hopes that Erzberger would be able to obtain better conditions from the Allies, Marshal Ferdinand Foch, the chief Allied negotiator, was unwilling to make any concessions, with the exception of a slight extension of the time allotted to the German army to withdraw. Erzberger was unsure whether he should hold out for further changes in Germany&#x27;s favour. On 10 November, Paul von Hindenburg himself telegraphed back that the armistice should be signed, with or without modifications, and a while later the new Chancellor, the Social Democrat Friedrich Ebert, telegraphed Erzberger to authorize him to sign.

As the head of the German delegation, he signed the armistice ending World War I at Compiègne on 11 November 1918 with the French representative, Marshal Foch. He made a short speech on the occasion, protesting the harshness of the terms, and concluded by saying that &quot;a nation of seventy millions can suffer, but it cannot die.&quot; Foch ignored Erzberger&#x27;s attempt to shake his hand and is said to have replied, &quot;Très bien&quot; (&quot;very well&quot;).

==After the war==

Returning to Berlin, Erzberger agreed to remain Chairman of the Armistice Commission, a difficult and humiliating task. He fell out with Ulrich von Brockdorff-Rantzau, first Foreign Minister of the Weimar Republic, in early 1919 for advocating the handing over of Karl Radek, the Bolshevik diplomat and agitator, to the Entente following the collapse of the German Revolution.

After the elections for the Weimar National Assembly in January 1919, Erzberger entered the government of the German Republic led by Philipp Scheidemann, again as minister without a specified portfolio, but responsible for matters relating to the armistice. When Scheidemann resigned over the harsh terms of Treaty of Versailles and a new government led by Gustav Bauer took over on 21 June 1919, Erzberger became finance minister and vice chancellor. After the Weimar Constitution came into force in August 1919, Erzberger remained in that position. He supported the Treaty of Versailles, as he saw no military or political alternatives. He was treated with particular contempt by the nationalist right wing as the man who had signed what was coming to be viewed as a humiliating and unnecessary surrender.

However, he succeeded in pushing new taxation measures through the National Assembly. In July 1919, Erzberger introduced what became known as &quot;Erzberger finance reform&quot;. The reform pursued two goals. First, it was to give the German federal government supreme authority to tax and spend and thus end the dependence of the central government on the constituent states, as in the former German Empire. Second, Erzberger aimed for a significant redistribution of the tax burden, lightening the burden on low- to moderate income households. In July 1919, war levies on income and wealth were introduced, as well as the first German inheritance tax. In December 1919, an additional a one-time &quot;emergency&quot; tax on wealth was levied, causing outrage among the better-off. In March 1920, a federal income tax followed. Its high tax rates made Erzberger even more unpopular with many on the right.

The German tax code still bears Erzberger&#x27;s imprint. He stabilized national finances, although they remained strained by the burden of war reparations. He also reformed and unified the previously independent state railway administrations into the German Reichsbahn, which began to make a profit for the first time and helped pay the war reparations.

In his disputes with the political right, Erzberger set himself in particularly sharp opposition to the German National People&#x27;s Party (the old conservatives), on whom he laid the responsibility for the war; the result was a personal dispute with the leader of the Nationalists, the war-time state secretary for the treasury, Karl Helfferich, who published a brochure titled &quot;&quot; (&quot;Get rid of Erzberger!&quot;), and Erzberger was ultimately compelled to bring an action against Helfferich for slander. The case was heard in a Berlin court from 19 January to 12 March 1920. The action resulted in a small fine for Helfferich (German law did not make provision for any damages or penalties for slander). The court, however, in its judgment of 12 March 1920, took the line that Helfferich&#x27;s allegations regarding Erzberger&#x27;s corrupt business practices and untruthful statements were partly justified. Erzberger was consequently compelled by his party to resign his ministerial office and to give up his seat in the National Assembly in March 1920.

=== Erzberger assassination attempt ===
During the trial, Erzberger was wounded in an assassination attempt by a young army ensign named Oltwig von Hirschfeld as he left the court on 26 January 1920. Hirschfeld, &quot;recently subjected to compulsory demobilisation and determined to &#x27;deal with&#x27; the most prominent of the &#x27;Versailles traitors&#x27;&quot;, fired two shots at Erzberger, the first of which &quot;inflicted a shoulder wound, while the second was deflected by the minister&#x27;s watch chain.&quot; Although he was immediately apprehended, Hirschfeld was convicted &quot;not of attempted murder but of &#x27;dangerous bodily harm&#x27; [...] and sentenced to a mere eighteen months in prison, then paroled after four months on &#x27;health grounds&#x27;&quot;.

Erzberger was once more returned to the Reichstag (which replaced the National Assembly) at the general election of June 1920, but in accordance with the wish of his party, he abstained from immediate participation in politics, as proceedings had been instituted against him on a charge of evading taxation. In 1920, he published a memorandum endeavouring to justify his position during the war, and he followed it up with disclosures regarding the attitude of the Holy See in 1917 and the mission of the papal legate in Munich, Eugenio Pacelli (later Pope Pius XII).

Erzberger&#x27;s power in German politics was based on his great influence with the Catholic working classes in the Rhineland, Westphalia, central Germany and Silesia. In the industrial regions of these districts, the Catholic workers were organized in their own trade unions on lines of very advanced social policy, and Erzberger became the leading exponent of their views in the Reichstag and on public platforms. On the other hand, he incurred the strong opposition of the conservative and landed section of the Catholics, some of the higher clergy such Cardinal Archbishop Felix von Hartmann of Cologne, and the Bavarian agricultural interests as represented by the Catholic Bavarian People&#x27;s Party in the State Diet at Munich and in the Reichstag in Berlin. Erzberger also was the leader of the left-wing of the Centre Party with Joseph Wirth. At a Reich party committee meeting, he said that &quot;Left is life, Right is death.&quot;

Erzberger continued to be pursued by the relentless animosity of the reactionary parties, the conservatives and the national liberals of the German People&#x27;s Party. This hostility, which amounted to a vendetta, was based not so much upon Erzberger&#x27;s foreign policy – his negotiation of the Armistice terms and the decisive influence which he exercised in securing the acceptance of the Treaty of Versailles – as upon his financial policies. He was suspect for his activities as finance minister in 1919, as the supporter of liberal Catholic trade unions and, it was said, as political adviser of the Catholic Chancellor of the Reich, Joseph Wirth, who prepared a fresh scheme of taxation designed to impose new burdens upon capital and upon the prosperous landed interests in the summer of 1921.

==Assassination==

The denunciations of the conservative and national liberal press went beyond the ordinary limits of party polemics. The observed, in allusion to Erzberger&#x27;s appearance, &quot;he may be as round as a bullet, but he is not bullet-proof&quot;. These attacks climaxed in Erzberger&#x27;s murder on 26 August 1921 in Bad Griesbach, a spa in the Black Forest (Baden), while he was out walking with his friend and Centre Party colleague Carl Diez. The pair were accosted in broad daylight by two men armed with revolvers who &quot;fired shots at Erzberger&#x27;s head and chest. Erzberger leaped down the slope by the road, but three further shots hit him in his lung, stomach, and leg. The murderers then ran down the slope themselves and fired more shots at him. Diez was also hit in the chest, but was able to return, bleeding, to the hotel and relate what had happened.&quot; Because Erzberger signed the armistice of 1918, many on the political right regarded him as a traitor. Manfred von Killinger, a leading member of the &quot;Germanenorden&quot;, masterminded his killing by recruiting two members – Heinrich Tillessen and Heinrich Schulz – of the ultra-nationalist death squad Organisation Consul. The assassins were former Imperial German Navy officers and members of the disbanded &quot;Marinebrigade Ehrhardt&quot;. Erzberger&#x27;s assassins were later smuggled into Hungary and were prosecuted only after World War II. His funeral turned into a political rally, at which one of the speakers was Joseph Wirth. Erzberger is buried in the Catholic cemetery of Biberach an der Riss.

==Legacy==

Erzberger was instrumental in preparing the German nation for peace and in ensuring that the Catholic Centre Party, the predecessor of today&#x27;s Christian Democratic Union, retained a modicum of power in an increasingly radicalized Germany. His financial, federal, and rail reforms transformed Germany. Erzberger, with his optimism and sense of responsibility, never retreated even in the face of the most difficult tasks. In fact his greatest, and most tragic legacy, was the signature on the Armistice. Despite military pressure on him to sign as soon as possible, this was pointed out for decades afterwards as evidence for the &quot;Dolchstoßlegende&quot; (stab-in-the-back myth), which portrayed the surrender as betrayal by the civilians on the home front, especially by Socialist politicians for personal gain, undermining the German Army&#x27;s will to fight. Later the stab-in-the-back legend helped propel to power Adolf Hitler, who made it an integral part of Nazi propaganda. For his role, Erzberger was branded as one of the &quot;November Criminals&quot;.

In the 2022 film &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front,&quot; Erzberger is portrayed by Daniel Brühl.

<text>The red deer (Cervus elaphus) is one of the largest deer species. A male red deer is called a stag or [[Hart (deer)|hart]], and a female is called a doe or hind. The red deer inhabits most of Europe, the Caucasus Mountains region, Anatolia, Iran, and parts of western Asia. It also inhabits the Atlas Mountains of Northern Africa; being the only living species of deer to inhabit Africa. Red deer have been introduced to other areas, including Australia, New Zealand, the United States, Canada, Peru, Uruguay, Chile and Argentina. In many parts of the world, the meat (venison) from red deer is used as a food source.

The red deer is a ruminant, characterized by a four-chambered stomach. Genetic evidence indicates that the red deer, as traditionally defined, is a species group, rather than a single species, though exactly how many species the group includes remains disputed. The ancestor of the red deer probably originated in central Asia.

Although at one time red deer were rare in parts of Europe, they were never close to extinction. Reintroduction and conservation efforts, such as in the United Kingdom and Portugal, have resulted in an increase of red deer populations, while other areas, such as North Africa, have continued to show a population decline.

==Description==

The red deer is the fourth-largest extant deer species, behind the moose, elk, and sambar deer. It is a ruminant, eating its food in two stages and having an even number of toes on each hoof, like camels, goats, and cattle. European red deer have a relatively long tail compared with their Asian and North American relatives. Subtle differences in appearance are noted between the various subspecies of red deer, primarily in size and antlers, with the smallest being the Corsican red deer found on the islands of Corsica and Sardinia and the largest being the Caspian red deer (or maral) of Asia Minor and the Caucasus Region to the west of the Caspian Sea.

The deer of central and western Europe vary greatly in size, with some of the largest deer found in the Carpathian Mountains in Central Europe. Western European red deer, historically, grew to large size given ample food supply (including people&#x27;s crops), and descendants of introduced populations living in New Zealand and Argentina have grown quite large in both body and antler size. Large red deer stags, like the Caspian red deer or those of the Carpathian Mountains, may rival North American elk in size. Female red deer are much smaller than their male counterparts.
===Size===
The male (stag) red deer is typically long from the nose to the base of the tail and typically weighs ; the female (hind) is long and often weighs . The tail adds another and shoulder height is about . In Scotland, stags average in head-and-body length and high at the shoulder and females average long and tall. Based on body mass, they are likely the fourth largest extant deer species on average, behind the moose, the elk and the sambar deer.

Size varies in different subspecies with the largest, the huge but small-antlered deer of the Carpathian Mountains (&quot;C. e. elaphus&quot;), weighing up to . At the other end of the scale, the Corsican red deer (&quot;C. e. corsicanus&quot;) weighs about , although red deer in poor habitats can weigh as little as .

===Neck mane===
The males of many subspecies also grow a short neck mane during the autumn. The male deer of the British Isles and Norway tend to have the thickest and most noticeable manes. Male Caspian red deer (&quot;C. e. maral&quot;) and Spanish red deer (&quot;C. e. hispanicus&quot;) do not carry neck manes. Male deer of all subspecies, however, tend to have stronger and thicker neck muscles than female deer, which may give them an appearance of having neck manes. Red deer hinds (females) do not have neck manes.

===Antlers===
Only the stags have antlers, which start growing in the spring and are shed each year, usually at the end of winter. Antlers typically measure in total length and weigh , although large ones can grow to and weigh . Antlers, which are made of bone, can grow at a rate of a day. While an antler is growing, it is covered with highly vascular skin called velvet, which supplies oxygen and nutrients to the growing bone.

The antlers are testosterone-driven and as the stag&#x27;s testosterone levels drop in the autumn, the velvet is shed and the antlers stop growing. With the approach of autumn, the antlers begin to calcify and the stags&#x27; testosterone production builds for the approaching rut (mating season).

European red deer antlers are distinctive in being rather straight and , with the fourth and fifth tines forming a &quot;crown&quot; or &quot;cup&quot; in larger males. Any tines in excess of the fourth and fifth tines grow radially from the cup, which are generally absent in the antlers of smaller red deer, such as Corsican red deer. Western European red deer antlers feature &quot;bez&quot; (second) tines that are either absent or smaller than the brow tines. However, bez tines occur frequently in Norwegian red deer. Antlers of Caspian red deer carry large bez tines and form less-developed cups than western European red deer, their antlers are thus more like the &quot;throw back&quot; top tines of the North American elk (&quot;C. canadensis&quot;), known as maraloid characteristics. A stag can (exceptionally) have antlers with no tines, and is then known as a switch. Similarly, a stag that does not grow antlers is a hummel.

===Coat===
European red deer tend to be reddish-brown in their summer coats, and some individuals may have a few spots on the backs of their summer coats. During the autumn, all red deer subspecies grow thicker coats of hair, which helps to insulate them during the winter. Autumn is also when some of the stags grow their neck manes. The autumn/winter coats of most subspecies are most distinct. The Caspian red deer&#x27;s winter coat is greyer and has a larger and more distinguished light rump-patch (like wapiti and some central Asian red deer) compared with the Western European red deer, which has more of a greyish-brown coat with a darker yellowish rump patch in the winter.

By the time summer begins, the heavy winter coat has been shed; the animals are known to rub against trees and other objects to help remove hair from their bodies. Red deer have different colouration based on the seasons and types of habitats, with grey or lighter colouration prevalent in the winter and more reddish and darker coat colouration in the summer.

==Distribution==
=== Europe and North Africa===
The European red deer is found in southwestern Asia (Asia Minor and Caucasus regions), North Africa, and Europe. The red deer is the largest nondomesticated land mammal still existing in Ireland. The Barbary stag (which resembles the western European red deer) is the only living member of the deer family native to Africa, with the population centred in the northwestern region of the continent in the Atlas Mountains. As of the mid-1990s, Morocco, Tunisia, and Algeria were the only African countries known to have red deer.

In the Netherlands, a large herd (about 3000 animals counted in late 2012) lives in the Oostvaardersplassen, a nature reserve. Ireland has its own unique subspecies. In France, the population is thriving, having multiplied five-fold in the last half-century, increasing from 30,000 in 1970 to around 160,000 in 2014. The deer has particularly expanded its footprint into forests at higher altitudes than before. In the UK, indigenous populations occur in Scotland, the Lake District, and the south west of England (principally on Exmoor). Not all of these are of entirely pure bloodlines, as some of these populations have been supplemented with deliberate releases of deer from parks, such as Warnham or Woburn Abbey, in an attempt to increase antler sizes and body weights. The University of Edinburgh found that, in Scotland, extensive hybridisation with the closely related sika deer has occurred.

Several other populations have originated either with &quot;carted&quot; deer kept for stag hunts being left out at the end of the hunt, escapes from deer farms, or deliberate releases. Carted deer were kept by stag hunts with no wild red deer in the locality and were normally recaptured after the hunt and used again; although the hunts are called &quot;stag hunts&quot;, the Norwich Staghounds only hunted hinds (female red deer), and in 1950, at least eight hinds (some of which may have been pregnant) were known to be at large near Kimberley and West Harling; they formed the basis of a new population based in Thetford Forest in Norfolk. Further substantial red deer herds originated from escapes or deliberate releases in the New Forest, the Peak District, Suffolk, Lancashire, Brecon Beacons, and North Yorkshire, as well as many other smaller populations scattered throughout England and Wales, and they are all generally increasing in numbers and range. A census of deer populations in 2007 and again in 2011 coordinated by the British Deer Society records the red deer as having continued to expand their range in England and Wales since 2000, with expansion most notable in the Midlands and East Anglia.

=== Iran ===
Caspian red deer are found in the Hyrcanian Forests.

===New Zealand===

In New Zealand, red deer were introduced by acclimatisation societies along with other deer and game species. The first red deer to reach New Zealand were a pair sent by Lord Petre in 1851 from his herd at Thorndon Park, Essex, to the South Island, but the hind was shot before they had a chance to breed. Lord Petre sent another stag and two hinds in 1861, and these were liberated near Nelson, from where they quickly spread. The first deer to reach the North Island were a gift to Sir Frederick Weld from Windsor Great Park and were released near Wellington; these were followed by further releases up to 1914. Between 1851 and 1926, 220 separate liberations of red deer involved over 800 deer. In 1927, the State Forest Service introduced a bounty for red deer shot on their land, and in 1931, government control operations were commenced. Between 1931 and March 1975, 1,124,297 deer were killed on official operations.

The introduced red deer have adapted well and are widely hunted on both islands; many of the 220 introductions used deer originating from Scotland (Invermark) or one of the major deer parks in England, principally Warnham, Woburn Abbey or Windsor Great Park. Some hybridisation happened with the closely related American elk (&quot;Cervus canadensis nelsoni&quot;) introduced in Fiordland in 1921. Along with the other introduced deer species, they are, however, officially regarded as a noxious pest and are still heavily culled using professional hunters working with helicopters, or even poisoned.

=== Australia ===
The first red deer to reach Australia were probably the six that Prince Albert sent in 1860 from Windsor Great Park to Thomas Chirnside, who was starting a herd at Werribee Park, south west of Melbourne in Victoria. Further introductions were made in New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, and Western Australia. Today, red deer in Australia range from Queensland south through New South Wales into Victoria and across to South Australia, with the numbers increasing. The Queensland, Victorian and most New South Wales strains can still be traced to the early releases, but South Australia&#x27;s population, along with all others, is now largely recent farm escapees. This is having adverse effects on the integrity of wild herds, as now more and larger herds are being grown due to the superior genetics that have been attained by selective breeding.

Wild red deer are a feral pest species in Australia, do considerable harm to the natural environment, and are a significant road traffic hazard.

=== Argentina and Chile ===
In Argentina and Chile, the red deer has had a potentially adverse impact on native animal species, such as the South Andean deer or &quot;huemul&quot;; the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources has labelled the animal as one of the world&#x27;s 100 worst invaders.

===Migration===
Red deer in Europe generally spend their winters at lower altitudes in more wooded terrain. During the summer, they migrate to higher elevations where food supplies are greater and better for the calving season.

==Taxonomy and evolution==
Until recently, biologists considered the red deer and elk or wapiti (&quot;C. canadensis&quot;) the same species, forming a continuous distribution throughout temperate Eurasia and North America. This belief was based largely on the fully fertile hybrids that can be produced under captive conditions.

Genetic evidence clearly shows the wapiti and red deer form two separate species.

Another member of the red deer group which may represent a separate species is &quot;C. corsicanus&quot;. If so, &quot;C. corsicanus&quot; includes the subspecies &quot;C. e. barbarus&quot; (perhaps a synonym of &quot;C. e. corsicanus&quot;), and is restricted to Maghreb in North Africa, Corsica, and Sardinia.

A 2014 mitochondrial DNA study showed the internal phylogeny of &quot;Cervus&quot; to be as follows:

&quot;Cervus elaphus&quot; appeared in Europe by the beginning of the Middle Pleistocene around 800,000 years ago. These earliest forms belonged to the palaeosubspecies &quot;Cervus elaphus acoronatus&quot;. Other palaeosubspecies are known, including those belonging to &quot;C. elaphus rianensis&quot; from the Middle Pleistocene of Italy, &quot;C. elaphus siciliae&quot; from the late Middle and Late Pleistocene of Sicily.

The International Union for Conservation of Nature originally listed nine subspecies of red deer (&quot;Cervus elaphus&quot;): three as endangered, one as vulnerable, one as near threatened, and four without enough data to give a category (Data Deficient). The species as a whole, however, is listed as least concern. However, this was based on the traditional classification of red deer as one species (&quot;Cervus elaphus&quot;), including the wapiti. The common red deer is also known as simply red deer.

Selected members of the red deer species group are listed in the table below. Of the ones listed, &quot;C. e. hippelaphus&quot; and &quot;C. e. scoticus&quot; may be junior synonyms.

==Behaviour==
Mature red deer (&quot;C. elaphus&quot;) usually stay in single-sex groups for most of the year. During the mating season, called the rut, mature stags compete for the attentions of the hinds and will then try to defend the hinds they attract. Rival stags challenge opponents by belling and walking in parallel. This allows combatants to assess each other&#x27;s antlers, body size and fighting prowess. If neither stag backs down, a clash of antlers can occur, and stags sometimes sustain serious injuries. Red deer are among the mammals exhibiting homosexual behavior.

Dominant stags urinate on themselves and follow groups of hinds during the rut, from August into early winter. The stags may have as many as 20 hinds to keep from other, less attractive males. Only mature stags hold harems (groups of hinds), and breeding success peaks at about eight years of age. Stags two to four years old rarely hold harems and spend most of the rut on the periphery of larger harems, as do stags over 11 years old. Young and old stags that do acquire a harem hold it later in the breeding season than those stags in their prime. Harem-holding stags rarely feed and lose up to 20% of their body weight. Stags that enter the rut in poor condition are less likely to make it through to the peak conception period.
Male European red deer have a distinctive roar during the rut, which is an adaptation to forested environments, in contrast to male American elk stags which &quot;bugle&quot; during the rut in adaptation to open environments. The male deer roars to keep his harem of females together. The females are initially attracted to those males that both roar most often and have the loudest roar call. Males also use the roar call when competing with other males for females during the rut, and along with other forms of posturing and antler fights, is a method used by the males to establish dominance. Roaring is most common during the early dawn and late evening, which is also when the crepuscular deer are most active in general.

===Breeding, gestation and lifespan===
Female red deer reach sexual maturity at 2 years of age. Red deer mating patterns usually involve a dozen or more mating attempts before the first successful one. There may be several more matings before the stag will seek out another mate in his harem. Females in their second autumn can produce one or very rarely two offspring per year. The gestation period is 240 to 262 days, and the offspring weigh about . After two weeks, calves are able to join the herd and are fully weaned after two months. The offspring will remain with their mothers for almost one full year, leaving around the time the next season&#x27;s offspring are produced. The gestation period is the same for all subspecies.

All red deer calves are born spotted, as is common with many deer species, and lose their spots by the end of summer. However, as in many species of Old World deer, some adults do retain a few spots on the backs of their summer coats.

Red deer live over 20 years in captivity and in the wild they live 10 to 13 years, though some subspecies with less predation pressure average 15 years.

===Protection from predators===

Male red deer retain their antlers for more than half the year, and are less gregarious and less likely to group with other males when they have antlers. The antlers provide self-defence, as does a strong front-leg kicking action performed by both sexes when attacked. Once the antlers are shed, stags tend to form bachelor groups which allow them to cooperatively work together. Herds tend to have one or more members watching for potential danger, while the remaining members eat and rest.

After the rut, females form large herds of up to 50 individuals. The newborn calves are kept close to the hinds by a series of vocalizations between the two, and larger nurseries have an ongoing and constant chatter during the daytime hours. When approached by predators, the largest and most robust females may make a stand, using their front legs to kick at their attackers. Guttural grunts and posturing is used with all but the most determined of predators with great effectiveness. Aside from humans and domestic dogs, the grey wolf is probably the most dangerous predator European red deer encounter. Occasionally, the brown bear will prey on European red deer.

==Red deer in folklore and art==
Red deer are widely depicted in cave art found throughout European caves, with some of the artwork dating from as early as 40,000 years ago, during the Upper Paleolithic. Siberian cave art from the Neolithic of 7,000 years ago has abundant depictions of red deer, including what can be described as spiritual artwork, indicating the importance of this mammal to the peoples of that region (Note: these animals were most likely wapiti (&quot;C. canadensis&quot;) in Siberia, not red deer). Red deer are also often depicted on Pictish stones (&quot;circa&quot; 550–850 AD), from the early medieval period in Scotland, usually as prey animals for human or animal predators. In medieval hunting, the red deer was the most prestigious quarry, especially the mature stag, which in England was called a hart.

==Red deer products==
Red deer are held in captivity for a variety of reasons. The meat of the deer, called venison, was until recently restricted in the United Kingdom to those with connections to the aristocratic or poaching communities, and a licence was needed to sell it legally, but it is now widely available in supermarkets, especially in the autumn. The Queen followed the custom of offering large pieces of venison to members of the Cabinet of the United Kingdom and others. Some estates in the Scottish Highlands still sell deer-stalking accompanied by a in the traditional way, on unfenced land, while others operate more like farms for venison. Venison is widely considered to be both flavourful and nutritious. It is higher in protein and lower in fat than either beef or chicken.

The red deer can produce of antler velvet annually. On ranches in New Zealand, China, Siberia, and elsewhere, this velvet is collected and sold to markets in East Asia, where it is used for holistic medicines, with South Korea being the primary consumer. In Russia, a medication produced from antler velvet is sold under the brand name Pantokrin (; ). The antlers themselves are also believed by East Asians to have medicinal purposes and are often ground up and used in small quantities.

Historically, related deer species such as Central Asian red deer, wapiti, Thorold&#x27;s deer, and sika deer have been reared on deer farms in Central and Eastern Asia by Han Chinese, Turkic peoples, Tungusic peoples, Mongolians, and Koreans. In modern times, western countries such as New Zealand and United States have taken to farming European red deer for similar purposes.

Deer hair products are also used in the fly fishing industry, being used to tie flies.

Deer antlers are also used for decorative purposes and have been used for artwork, furniture and other novelty items. Deer antlers were and still are the source material for horn furniture. Already in the 15th century trophies of case were used for clothes hook, storage racks and chandeliers, the so-called &quot;Lusterweibchen&quot;. In the 19th century the European nobility discovered red deer antlers as perfect decorations for their manors and hunting castles. This fashion trend splashes over to upper- and middle-class households in the mid of the 19th century.
At the increasingly popular World Expositions, producers of horn furniture, mainly in Germany, Austria and the United States, such as and Friedrich Wenzel, showed their horn furniture and a kind of series manufacturing began. In recent times deer antler home decors can be found in home styling magazines.

<text>In the Battle of Aspern-Essling (21–22 May 1809), Napoleon crossed the Danube near Vienna, but the French and their allies were attacked and forced back across the river by the Austrians under Archduke Charles. It was the first time Napoleon had been personally defeated in a major battle, as well as his first battle defeat in 10 years since the Siege of Acre, and his first battle defeat as head of state. Archduke Charles drove out the French but fell short of destroying their army. The Austrian artillery dominated the battlefield, firing 53,000 rounds compared to 24,300 French. The French lost over 20,000 men including one of Napoleon&#x27;s ablest field commanders and closest friends, Marshal Jean Lannes.

==Background==
On 10 April 1809, Austrian troops under Archduke Charles had crossed the border into Bavaria, a French client state; thus beginning hostilities without a declaration of war. The French, initially taken by surprise, were able to defeat the Austrians at Eckmühl Abensberg and Ratisbon. The Archduke, fearing that his army might be destroyed, retreated towards Bohemia. After these victories the way to Vienna for Napoleon was eventually open. By 13 May Napoleon had entered the City.

==Prelude==
Considering the French army need to rest at Vienna, Carl decided to march towards the Capital joining Hiller at the Marchfeld. When he arrived there he had an army of 115,000 men at his disposal. Napoleon only could muster 82,000 troops. The 8th and 9th Corps, numbering 38,000, were back on the River Traun. They were observing Kollowrath&#x27;s 25,000 Austrian troops who were entrenched on the north bank of the Danube near Linz. At the same time, they were safeguarding Napoleon&#x27;s communications with France and his current centre of operations. They were also dealing with the inconvenience posed by local risings, which were becoming a constant source of concern. Davout, having previously crossed his corps to the south bank of the Danube via Straubing and Enns, was engaged on similar duties with 35,000 men near St. Polten on the River Traisen, approximately 40 miles west of Vienna. Meanwhile, Le Febvre&#x27;s 7th Corps, comprising 22,000 personnel, was engaged in monitoring the movements of Archduke John&#x27;s forces, specifically 8,000 troops stationed in Innsbruck and 7,000 more under Jellacic on the higher reaches of the River Enns, from the vicinity of Salzburg. In addition, the remaining 30,000 Austrians of Johns army was responsible for maintaining a watch on the 57,000 Frenchmen of Eugene’s Army of Italy in Carinthia and Carniola.

Outnumbering the French Emperor, Francis urged the archduke to take immediate offensive action but Charles had no wish to venture a major attack across the Danube. Carl argued that by remaining on the left bank of the river, the army would retained freedom of manoeuvre. Napoleon wanted an early battle and he was aware that a decision was required urgently. He was concerned about the potential for unrest in his rear, the approach of John&#x27;s army and the possibility of Prussian intervention and a reversal of Russia&#x27;s position. Furthermore, he held the Austrians in low regard and believed that the main army was retreating into Moravia. He did not believe that it was in a position to deliver a significant battle on the northern bank of the Danube.

The French wanted to cross the Danube. A first crossing attempt on the Schwarze Lackenau was repulsed with some 700 French losses. Lobau, one of the numerous islands that divided the river into minor channels, was selected as the next point of crossing. Careful preparations were made and on the night of 19–20 May the French bridged all the channels on the right bank to Lobau and occupied the island. By the evening of the 20th many men had been collected there and the last arm of the Danube, between Lobau and the left bank, had been bridged. Masséna&#x27;s corps at once crossed to the left bank and dislodged the Austrian outposts. Undeterred by the news of heavy attacks on his rear from Tyrol and from Bohemia, Napoleon ferried all available troops to the bridges, and by daybreak on the 21st, 25,000 men in three infantry and two cavalry divisions were collected on the Marchfeld, the broad plain of the left bank which was also to be the scene of the Battle of Wagram.

The Archduke did not resist the passage. It was his intention as soon as a large enough force had crossed to attack it before the rest of the French army could come to its assistance. Napoleon had accepted the risk of such an attack but he sought at the same time to minimize it by summoning every available battalion to the scene. His forces on the Marchfeld were drawn up in front of the bridges facing north with their left flank in the village of Aspern (Gross-Aspern) and their right in Essling. Both places lay close to the Danube and could not therefore be turned; Aspern, indeed, is actually on the bank of one of the river channels. The French had to fill the gap between the villages and also move forward to give room for the supporting units to form up.

==Order of battle==
===Austrian===

&quot;Kaiserlich-Königliche Hauptarmee&quot;, under the command of Charles of Austria:
* 1st Column (VI Corps), Hiller:
** Vanguard: Nordmann
** Div. Kottulinsky
** Div. Vincent
* 2nd Column (I Corps), Bellegarde:
** Div. Fresnel
** Div. Vogelsang
** Div. Ulm
** Div. Notitz
* 3rd Column (II Corps), Hohenzollern-Hechingen:
** Advance Guard
** Div. Brady
** Div. Weber
* 4th Column (IV Corps), Rosenberg/Dedovich:
** Div. Klenau
** Div. Dedovich
* 5th Column (a part of IV Corps), Rosenberg/Hohenlohe:

** Div. of grenadiers, d&#x27;Aspre

Total: 99,000 men; 84,000 infantry, 14,250 cavalry, 288 guns

The corps led by Johann von Hiller (VI), Heinrich Graf von Bellegarde (I) and Prince Friedrich of Hohenzollern-Hechingen (II) were to converge upon Aspern, while Prince Franz Seraph of Rosenberg-Orsini (IV) was to attack Essling. Prince Johann of Liechtenstein&#x27;s Austrian reserve cavalry was in the center, ready to move out against any French cavalry attacking the heads of the columns. During the 21st the bridges became more and more unsafe, owing to the violence of the current, but the French crossed without intermission all day and during the night.

===French===
&quot;Armée d&#x27;Allemagne&quot;, under the command of Napoleon I:

* Imperial Guard:
** Div. 1 (Young Guard): Curial
** Div. 2 (Old Guard): Dorsenne
** Div. 3 (cavalry): Arrighi
* II Corps, Lannes † :
** Div. Tharreau
** Div. Claparède
** Div. Saint-Hilaire †
** Div. of reserve, Demont (unengaged)
* IV Corps, Masséna:
** Div. Legrand
** Div. Carra Saint-Cyr
** Div. Molitor
** Div. Boudet
** Brig. Marulaz (cavalry)
** Div. Lasalle (cavalry)
* Cavalry Reserve Corps, Bessières:
** Div. Nansouty
** Div. Saint-Sulpice
** Div. d&#x27;Espagne †

Total: 77,000 men; 67,000 infantry, 10,000 cavalry, 152 guns

Following the overnight redeployment of Molitor&#x27;s division between Aspern and Essling, the division is now fully concentrated in Aspern. The recently arrived divisions of Legrand and Boudet have been assigned to Aspern and Essling, respectively. Bessiéres&#x27; cavalry occupied the area between the two villages, along a slightly banked east-west road. Lannes, the official commander of II Corps, was given temporary control of Boudet&#x27;s division and charged with defending Essling, the most vulnerable part of the French position. 

==Battle==
===First day===

Napoleon had not anticipated a significant engagement on the northern bank. The significant deployment of light cavalry at the head of the crossing schedule suggests that he still anticipated the necessity to locate Charles&#x27; army. At 4:00 p.m. on the 21st, the Emperor convened a meeting with his senior military officers to review the latest intelligence and plan the next steps. Despite the expectation that Bessières&#x27; advanced cavalry patrols would have discovered the presence of the main Austrian army so close to the bridgehead, they sent back no such information. This suggests that the French reconnoitering cavalry proved ineffective on this occasion. As there were no reports of the enemy, Lannes stated that he believed the army would encounter no more than 8,000 Austrians on the 21st, at the very outside. Only the cautious Duc de Rivoli made an estimation that the enemy might already be nearby in force, but this was not agreed with by the others.
At approximately 1:00 p.m., the leading units of the Austrian 1st Corps successfully repelled Molitor&#x27;s outposts and drove them back into Aspern. The French were caught off-guard by the unexpected attack, which was disguised by the combination of a low ridge and a convenient dust storm until the last moment. Fortunately, Molitor was able to respond effectively to the challenge. By exerting considerable effort, he was able to repel the initial Austrian attack and gain sufficient time to bring all four of his regiments into the town. Despite repeated Austrian attacks throughout the afternoon, the French defence held firm. However, by 5:00 p.m. the Austrian forces had formed a half-circle around Aspern, and Archduke Charles ordered a general assault. General Molitor was now facing significant challenges in maintaining his position, with the enemy launching simultaneous attacks from three directions and overwhelming his forces. In the hours that followed, Aspern changed hands no less than six times. However, Molitor was determined not to concede defeat and continued to hold his position until he could be reinforced by General Legrand and subsequently Carra St. Cyr. This enabled the vital bridge to be opened to traffic once more.
Meanwhile, in a strategic centerpiece, the 7,000 sabers of Bessières engaged in a prolonged battle against Austrian cavalry and neighboring corps. The garrison at Essling was holding its own on the extreme right. Here, the French forces were only effectively attacked by Rosenberg&#x27;s 4th Corps from 6:00 p.m. onwards. Due to Lannes&#x27; strategic deployment of Boudet&#x27;s troops positioned within the town, the French successfully repulsed three successive Austrian attacks, maintaining control of their position and preventing any losses. 
Just before 7:00 p.m., the last new personnel arrived on the scene. St. Germain&#x27;s brigade from Nansouty&#x27;s division and St. Sulpice&#x27;s cuirassiers were present for Bessiéres&#x27; final assault on the enemy centre, but there were no significant outcomes. With the onset of darkness, the majority of combat ceased, and the two armies settled into a state of relative calm, with the exception of the ongoing engagement at Aspern, where a narrow distance separated the French and Austrian forces. At his new headquarters in Breitensee, Archduke Charles was engaged in planning the next day&#x27;s operations. Meanwhile, on the nearby island of Lobau, Napoleon was sending urgent messages to Davout in Vienna and mobilising all available troops in the bridgehead.
The bridge remained open for the majority of the night, allowing Lannes&#x27; command, comprising St. Hilaire&#x27;s division and Oudinot&#x27;s corps of grenadiers (Tharreau and Claparéde&#x27;s divisions), to safely reach the bridgehead by 4:00 a.m. This contingent was accompanied by additional cavalry and artillery units. The new troops were immediately deployed to secure the central sector of the position, while Bessiéres&#x27; cavalry was redeployed to a local reserve position. Boudet&#x27;s troops were still in control of Essling, with a contingent on their right occupying the open ground. On the left flank, Aspern and its surrounding area were under the control of Legrand and Carra St. Cyr. However, Molitor&#x27;s depleted regiments, which had been the primary focus of the previous day&#x27;s fighting, were relocated to a reserve position to the south. In addition, two divisions of the Guard were positioned to defend the bridgehead, and General Demont&#x27;s division was preparing to cross from Lobau Island. This brought the French forces to around 50,000 infantry, 12,000 cavalry and 144 guns. They were facing over 100,000 Austrian troops supported by at least 260 artillery pieces. 

===Second day===
Despite the cessation of hostilities in Aspern earlier that evening, sporadic fighting continued throughout the night. At approximately 5:00 A.M., the Austrian 1st and 5th Corps initiated a new full-scale assault on the town and the nearby wooded area known as Gemeinde-Au. This was conducted under cover of darkness and a thick mist. The fortunes of the struggle fluctuated, but a particularly successful counterattack by Massena at approximately 7:00 a.m. resulted in the French recapturing the entirety of Aspern. Meanwhile, Dedovich and Rosenberg leading the fourth and fifth columns, respectively launched a new attack on Essling. Despite making some progress, they were unable to gain the upper hand and were held back by Boudet&#x27;s forces. 
This meant that Napoleon was in a position to contemplate a breakout from the bridgehead. There is a strong possibility that he had intended Davout to provide support for this operation, but due to a lack of available bridges, Davout&#x27;s corps was not involved in the battle. Notwithstanding this, Napoleon remained confident and ordered an attack from the centre of his position, perhaps with the expectation that Davout would still arrive. 
Shortly after 7:00 a.m. Lannes&#x27; corps began to advance in echelons, with Saint-Hilaire leading on the right and Oudinot following in the centre and on the left with Claparéde&#x27;s and Tharreau&#x27;s divisions. They marched into a sustained bombardment, but the Austrians at the front wavered, forcing Charles to send his reserve grenadier divisions forward, bringing the French advance to a halt. Napoleon then tried to salvage the situation by sending Bessiéres&#x27; cavalry through in a series of charges, but they too were driven back. At this point, Napoleon was becoming seriously concerned by reports from another quarter. 
Shortly after eight o&#x27;clock he learned that the bridge had broken down again, meaning that Davout&#x27;s corps could not cross. This, together with the fact that Lannes failed to bring the Austrian center down, left Napoleon with no alternative but to order a gradual withdrawal to Aspern and Essling. When Archduke Charles heard of the new collapse of the bridge at 10 a.m., he ordered his troops to attack again. All the while, fighting raged on the flanks. The first and second Austrian columns attacked Aspern again and another desperate battle ensued until an artillery barrage drove the defenders back. Shortly after 1:00 p.m., with no reserves left and exhausted after a day of almost non-stop fighting, the French finally abandoned the village. 
At approximately two in the afternoon, Charles initiated a strategic withdrawal of his units, positioning approximately 150 cannons to engage the French centre. During this intense period of bombardment, Lannes was struck by a cannonball that resulted in a fatal injury to his leg. Napoleon was also subject to enemy fire and, at the insistence of his personal guards, withdrew to the Lobau. Subsequently, Rosenberg&#x27;s IV Corps, supported by Merville&#x27;s Grenadier Brigade, led by Charles, forced Boudet out of Essling. However, the general and a few hundred Grenadiers were able to hold out in the granary. It was imperative that Essling be held, and thus Napoleon dispatched General Mouton with some Young Guard battalions to retake the village.
Mouton advanced into Essling but was at risk of being isolated by Austrian reinforcements. General Rapp was dispatched with two additional battalions of Middle Guard Fusilier Grenadiers to reinforce Mouton. Rapp advised Mouton to disregard Napoleon&#x27;s orders and launch a counterattack against the Austrian troops in Essling. The French battalions advanced, charged, repulsed and dispersed the enemy at the point of the bayonet. Rosenberg lost his nerve and fell back towards Gross-Enzersdorf. It was evident that Napoleon&#x27;s position was untenable. With no reinforcements or ammunition, his only viable option was to abandon the bridgehead and retreat to Lobau, where he could await the reestablishment of the bridge. Deciding that enough had been achieved Charles did not pursue. The decision not to pursue allowed Napoleon to withdraw his army from the north bank of the Danube, and by 23 May the last French troops had left.

==Aftermath==
At Aspern-Essling, the Emperor&#x27;s reputation for invincibility was significantly damaged. The total number of casualties was estimated to be between 20,000 and 23,000 killed and wounded, along with 3,000 captured. Among them were one of Napoleon&#x27;s ablest field commanders and closest friends, Marshal Jean Lannes. The Austrian losses were comparable, with 19,000 killed and wounded, though only 700 captured. In his subsequent bulletin, Napoleon acknowledged 4,100 killed and wounded, characterising the battle of Aspern-Essling as a new memorial to the glory and inflexible firmness of the French army. This was the closest he could come to an admission of defeat.
The Austrians had also suffered similar casualties but had secured the first major victory against the French for over a decade. When Emperor Francis I learnt of this victory, he was relieved. He then wrote a letter to his brother:

The victory demonstrated both the progress the Austrian army had made since the string of catastrophic defeats in 1800 and 1805, and the fact that Napoleon&#x27;s army was in decline and could now be defeated in battle. The loss of Marshal Lannes was an especially severe blow to Napoleon, as he lost one of the few marshals who was capable of independent command, something that would haunt him dearly in the future.

==Accounts==
Patrick Rambaud, a French author, wrote a fictionalized account of the conflict entitled &quot;The Battle&quot; using many first-hand sources. Just looking from the French perspective, the novel provides a rather realistic description of combat in the Napoleonic era, as well as detailed depictions of famous commanders such as Napoleon, Massena, and Lannes. The concept and notes for the book originally came from noted French author Honoré de Balzac. Marcellin Marbot, one of Marshal Lannes aide-de-camps, wrote in his memoirs of the battle, in which he had to observe the last moments of his close friends, and describes the amount of bloodshed and sadness which came to the Grande Armée after the crossing of the Danube. The army surgeon Dominique-Jean Larrey also described the battle in his memoirs and mentions how he fed the wounded at Lobau with a bouillon of horse meat seasoned with gunpowder. Larrey is quoted in French by Dr Béraud

The municipality was unilingually Finnish. The municipality was also known as &quot;Kesälax&quot; in Swedish. The Swedish name is now considered outdated according to the Institute for the Languages of Finland.

== History ==
Kesälahti was first mentioned in 1589 as a part of the Uukuniemi parish (originally pogost). The Uukuniemi parish was sometimes called &quot;Kesälahti&quot; as the main church was occasionally in the village, but Uukuniemi was a more common name for the parish. Kesälahti became a chapel community in 1700.

In 1721 according to the Treaty of Nystad, which ended the Great Northern War, Uukuniemi was among the territories ceded to Russia (Old Finland), but Kesälahti was not included in the concessions. Kesälahti became an official parish in 1728.

Kesälahti was consolidated with Kitee in 2013.

<text>Keuruu (; ) is a town and municipality of Finland. It is located in the province of Western Finland and is part of the Central Finland region. The municipality has a population of () and covers an area of of which is water. The population density is . The town center and Haapamäki village are both the most populated places in Keuruu.

The municipality is unilingually Finnish. The municipality of Pihlajavesi was consolidated with Keuruu in 1969.

==Geography==

Neighbouring municipalities are Jämsä, Multia, Mänttä-Vilppula, Petäjävesi, Virrat and Ähtäri.

There are 316 lakes in Keuruu such as Keuruun Kaituri, Hallinjärvi, and Kolonjärvi, but the largest of which are Keurusselkä-Ukonselkä, Pihlajavesi, and Liesjärvi.
== History ==
Keuruu was originally known as &quot;Keuru&quot;. This name is first mentioned in 1552 as a wilderness used for hunting by the people of Sääksmäki. The northern part of the modern municipality was held by the people of Kangasala instead. Savonians settled the area in 1564, but some Tavastians also moved to their hunting grounds in the same area. At the time, it was possible to distinguish Savonians and Tavastians just by their names: Savonians had surnames usually ending in &quot;-nen&quot;, while that was not the case with the names of Tavastians. Out of the eleven original settlers, six were Savonians (surnames &quot;Karjalainen, Koponen, Manninen, Pynnänen, Ruoranen, Tiusanen&quot;), and five Tavastians.

The village was first mentioned in 1567 as &quot;Köyris&quot;. It was a part of the Ruovesi parish since 1571 and until 1636. By 1571, 31 new Savonian settlers had moved into the area while only two Tavastians remained, but more Tavastians came in the 17th century. The Savonians mostly came from Rautalampi and Laukaa. The Savonians and Tavastians later mixed, the local Savonian dialect is a relic of this. The southern part held by Sääksmäki was added to the new Keuruu parish in 1640.

Multia and Pihlajavesi were originally parts of the Keuruu parish. Multia was split off in 1872 and Pihlajavesi in 1910. However, Pihlajavesi rejoined Keuruu in 1969. The villages of Kivijärvi and Niemisvesi in Ähtäri were originally villages of the Keuruu parish.

== Culture ==
=== Sights and events ===
The old church in Keuruu is a wooden church built in the 18th century. It now serves as a museum. The summer Keuruu Market is a popular summer event. Over the years, performers have seen e.g. Matti Nykänen and Danny. Every summer, the Pentecostal Midsummer Conference in the Great Book brings together Christians from all over Finland and the world. The home port of the MS &quot;Elias Lönnrot&quot; paddle steamer is in Keuruu. The science space is a permanent exhibition space established in Keuruu for the former Karimo school, where technology is presented mainly to young people.

=== Food ===
In the 1980s, Keuruu&#x27;s traditional parish dishes were the &quot;gutter meat&quot; fried in a wooden trough, a sweetened potato casserole, and bread called &quot;varituinen&quot; or &quot;varilimppu&quot;.

<doc id="779743" wikidata="Q434529" url="?curid=779743" title="Baldomero Espartero">
<text>Baldomero Fernández-Espartero y Álvarez de Toro (27 February 17938 January 1879) was a Spanish marshal and statesman. He served as the Regent of the Realm, three times as Prime Minister and briefly as President of the Congress of Deputies. Throughout his life, he was endowed with a long list of titles such as Prince of Vergara, Duke of la Victoria, Count of Luchana, Viscount of Banderas and was also styled as &quot;the Peacemaker&quot;.

A &quot;self-made man&quot;, Espartero was an exceptional case of social mobility. With a humble origin, son of a cart-maker from a small village, he was originally destined to the priesthood yet he finally opted for a military career, taking part in the Peninsular War. He would become a champion for the Liberals after taking credit for the victory in the First Carlist War and replaced Maria Christina as regent of Spain in 1840.

Associated with the Progressive Party, he was one of the so-called &quot;espadones&quot; (&quot;big swords&quot;), general-politicians who dominated much of the political life of the country during the reign of Isabella II. He was ousted from the regency in 1843, temporarily distancing from politics. He was called to government after the 1854 revolution, opening the two-year period known as the &quot;Bienio Progresista&quot;.

Despite retiring from political life after his exit from government in 1856, Espartero maintained a cult following largely nurtured by the popular classes throughout the 1860s and, following the 1868 Glorious Revolution and subsequent overthrow of Isabella II, he emerged as popular candidate to become the head of state of the country, either as president of a republic or as king.

==Early life==

Espartero was born at Granátula de Calatrava, a village of the province of Ciudad Real. He was the ninth child of Manuel Antonio Fernández-Espartero y Cañadas, a master carpenter, who wanted him to become a priest, and wife Josefa Vicenta Álvarez de Toro y Molina.

In November 1809, age 16, Espartero enlisted in the Regiment of Infantry &quot;Ciudad Rodrigo&quot; in Seville, seat of the Central Supreme Junta. Barely 9 days after his enlisting, he took part in the Battle of Ocaña, in which the French Imperial Army defeated the Spanish. He joined the Military Academy of the Island of León in September 1810, and he was poised to join the Corps of Engineers thanks to his skills in mathematics, technical drawing, fortification and military tactics, but following a failed examination, he was returned to the infantry in 1813.

During 1815 he went to South America as a captain serving with General Pablo Morillo, who had been made commander-in-chief to quell the rebellions of the colonies on the Spanish Main. For eight years, Espartero distinguished himself in the struggle against the colonists. He was wounded several times and was made major and colonel on the battlefields of Cochabamba and Sopahuy.

Espartero returned to Spain, and, like most of his companions in arms, was socially discredited for some time. He was sent to the garrison town of Logroño, where, on 13 September 1827 he married , an orphan since 16 raised by her maternal grandfather, the most important landowner in Logroño. The marriage did not have issue, but they went on to adopt Espartero&#x27;s niece, Eladia, who was designated as their principal heir. Thenceforth, Logroño became the home of the most prominent of the Spanish political generals of the 19th century.

==Carlist War==
Espartero became, on the death of King Ferdinand VII during 1833, an ardent defender of the claim of his daughter, Isabella II, to the Spanish throne. With the beginning of the First Carlist War, the government sent him to the front as commandant of the province of Biscay, where he decisively defeated the Carlists in many encounters. He was quickly promoted to a divisional command and then made a lieutenant-general. At times he showed qualities as a &quot;guerrillero&quot; quite equal to those of the Carlists, such as Zumalacarregui and Ramón Cabrera, by his daring marches and surprise maneuvers. When he had to move large forces he was greatly superior to these men as an organizer and a strategist, and he never disgraced his successes by cruelty or needless severity. Twice he obliged the Carlists to end the siege of Bilbao before he was appointed commander-in-chief of the northern army on 17 September 1836. At this time the course of the war seemed to favor the pretender in the Basque provinces and Navarre, even though Infante Carlos had lost his ablest lieutenant, the Basque Zumalacarregui.

==Defeat of the Carlists==
His military duties as commander of the principal national army did not prevent Espartero from showing for the first time his political ambition. He displayed such radical and reformist inclinations that he became popular among the lower and middle classes; his popularity lasted more than a quarter of a century. During this time, the Progressives, Democrats and Liberals considered him their adviser. In November 1836, he once again forced the Carlists to end the siege of Bilbao. His troops included the British Legion commanded by Sir George de Lacy Evans. This success turned the war against Carlos, who vainly attempted a raid on Madrid, but was defeated in the Battle of Aranzueque. Meanwhile, on 18 June 1837 Espartero was nominated for the first time as the 7th Premier of Spain, until 18 August 1837.

Espartero pursued the enemy and obliged him to hurry northwards, after several defeats. Espartero won the Battle of Ramales on 12 May 1839, earning him the title of &quot;Duque de la Victoria&quot;.

During 1839, Espartero carefully began negotiations with Maroto and the principal Carlist chiefs of the Basque provinces. These ended with the commanders&#x27; acceptance of the general&#x27;s terms as part of the convention of Vergara, which secured the recognition of the ranks and titles of almost 1,000 Carlist officers. Twenty thousand Carlist volunteers surrendered at Vergara; only the irreconcilables commanded by Cabrera persevered for a while in the central provinces of Spain. However, in 1840, the pro-Isabelle general defeated the last forces of the Carlist insurgency, which had lasted seven years. He was styled &quot;El pacificador de España&quot;, was made a grandee of the first class, and received two dukedoms.

==Political life==
Espartero&#x27;s political opponents, the moderates, desired to amend the progressive Constitution of 1837. In particular, the moderates&#x27; proposal to abolish democratically elected local councils threatened to destroy the power base of the progressives. This threat was checked by the radical revolution of 1840, after which the conservatives became marginal and Espartero became the master of the destiny of Spain.

During the last three years of the war, Espartero, who had been elected a deputy, exercised from his distant headquarters such influence over Madrid politics that he twice hastened the end of the cabinet, and obtained office for his own friends. At the end of the war the queen regent and her ministers attempted to eliminate Espartero and his devotees, but a &quot;pronunciamiento&quot; ensued in Madrid and other large towns which culminated in the marshal&#x27;s accepting the post of prime minister. He soon became virtually a dictator, as Queen Christina became offended by his popularity and resigned, leaving the kingdom very soon afterwards. The Cortes Generales met and elected Espartero regent by 179 votes to 103 over Agustín Argüelles, who was appointed guardian of the young queen.

Forcing the regent, Maria Cristina, into exile for her conspiracy with the moderates, Espartero himself became regent with the intention of remaining so until the future Queen Isabella II became of age. Espartero&#x27;s popularity enabled him to defeat moderate military rebellions across Spain during 1841. Yet his ruthless execution of dozens of the conspirators, including many popular fellow war heroes like Diego de Leon, as well as his hasty and ungrateful dissolution of the radical &quot;&quot; that had ended the rebellions, decreased the popularity of his regency (Maria Cristina told him, &quot;I made you a duke, but I could not make you a gentleman.&quot;).

==Rule of Espartero==
While continuing as regent, Espartero ruled Spain as its 18th Prime Minister for two years from 16 September 1840 to 21 May 1841, in accordance with his radical and conciliatory dispositions, giving special attention to the reorganization of the administration, taxation and finances, declaring all the estates of the church, congregations and religious orders to be national property, and suppressing the &quot;diezma&quot;, or tithe. He suppressed the Republican rebellions with as much severity as he did the military &quot;pronunciamientos&quot; of Generals Concha and Diego de León. The latter was shot in Madrid.

Espartero defeated a rebellion in Barcelona, but on his return to Madrid was welcomed so weakly that he perceived that his prestige was decreasing. An economic slump and rumours of a free-trade deal with the United Kingdom provoked a popular rebellion by workers and the bourgeoisie of Barcelona in 1842. Espartero&#x27;s ruthless bombardment of the city ended this revolutionary threat. But a second rebellion in 1843 combined with moderate conspiracies and military uprisings. The rebels declared Queen Isabella of age, and, commanded by General Ramón María Narváez y Campos, marched on Madrid, advancing as far as the city&#x27;s gates. From this position Narváez issued an ultimatum in a dispatch to Espartero, who, deeming resistance useless, embarked at Cadiz on 30 July 1843 for England, and lived quietly until 1848, when a royal decree restored to him all his honors and his seat in the senate. Dubbed public enemy number one by the moderates, and directed by their leader Narváez, Espartero was unable to return to his estates in northern Spain until an amnesty was decreed later in the 1840s.

Although Espartero&#x27;s regime (1840–1843) in reality had done little for Spain&#x27;s poor, the anti-radical reaction of the moderates made the former regent a folk hero to many workers. Therefore, it was logical that he should become director of the short-lived &quot;progressive Biennium&quot; of 1854–1856, thus becoming the 43rd Prime Minister of Spain on 19 July 1854. But, as Karl Marx observed, the progressive &quot;caudillo&quot; was a man whose time had passed.

The old marshal vainly endeavoured to keep the demands of his own Progressists reasonable in the Cortes of 1854–1856 and in the great towns, but their excessive demands for reforms and liberties played into the hands of a clerical and reactionary court and of the equally retrograde governing classes. The growing ambition of General O&#x27;Donnell constantly clashed with the opinions of Espartero, until the latter, in sheer disgust, resigned his premiership and left for Logroño, after warning the queen that a conflict was imminent between O&#x27;Donnell and the Cortes, backed by the Progressist militia. O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s &quot;pronunciamiento&quot; in 1856 ended the Cortes, and the militia was disarmed, after a struggle in the streets of the capital. Spanish political power was assumed again by the moderates in 1856.

He was the 42nd Grand Cross of the Order of the Tower and Sword.

==Retirement==

After 1856 Espartero resolutely refused to identify himself with active politics but was frequently asked to become involved. On 14 July 1858, he resigned as Premier. He refused to allow himself to be named as a candidate when the Cortes of 1868, after the Revolution, sought a ruler. Espartero, strangely enough, adopted a laconic phrase when successive governments on their advent to power invariably addressed themselves to him. To the Revolution of 1868, the Constituent Cortes of 1869, King Amadeo, the Federal Republic of 1873, the nameless government of Marshal Serrano during 1874, the Bourbon restoration during 1875, he simply said: &quot;Cúmplase la voluntad nacional&quot; (&quot;Let the national will be accomplished&quot;).

King Amadeo made him Prince of Vergara. Along with Manuel Godoy, Espartero has been the only person other than the Prince of Asturias to have held the title of prince in the Kingdom of Spain, traditionally reserved for the heir to the throne.

The Restoration caused a statue to him to be built near the gate of the Retiro Park in Madrid. A magnificent statue and fountain was raised in his memory at Logroño. Spaniards of all political factions, except Carlists and Ultramontanes, paid homage to his memory when he died in La Rioja on 8 January 1879. He was a typical Spanish soldier-politician, but he sometimes had difficulty accommodating himself to courtiers and professional politicians.

<text>Julian Martin White MBE (born 14 May 1973) is an English Landowner, best known for his time playing professional rugby union as a prop for Leicester Tigers and England. White was regarded as an aggressive tighthead prop, one of the most powerful forwards in the game, and for his destructive scrummaging.

== Biography ==
White was born 14 May 1973 in Plymouth, Devon. As a child he played mini and junior rugby for Salcombe and had played in the same senior side as his father, a former Plymouth Albion player. He served his rugby union apprenticeship with Okehampton and Plymouth Albion and had a spell in New Zealand with Hawke&#x27;s Bay and Canterbury Crusaders. He made his debut for Hawke&#x27;s Bay in August 1996 and appeared in the NZ Provincial Championship. He made his only Super 12 appearance as a replacement for the Crusaders against Natal in Christchurch in April 1997.

His time in New Zealand ended in tragedy; he was involved in an auto accident in which a young woman was killed and he suffered a broken leg. As he remembers it,

He returned to the UK when a Welsh coach who had worked with White at Hawke&#x27;s Bay told him that Bridgend desperately needed a tighthead. White played for Bridgend in 1998–99 before moving to Saracens in 1999. He swiftly made his Premiership debut in the 28–23 defeat of London Irish at Vicarage Road, Watford on the opening weekend of the season.

White made his England debut against South Africa on England&#x27;s Summer 2000 tour there. He appeared in his first Twickenham Test against Argentina in November 2001, playing until half time when he was replaced by Phil Vickery.

He toured North America in the summer of 2001, forming a solid front row with Graham Rowntree and Dorian West.

At the start of the 2001–02 season he transferred back to the West Country with Bristol Shoguns. This occurred after a protracted affair where White had attempted to get out of the contract he had signed with Bristol. White did not endear himself to Bristol supporters as he had tried to break out of his contract to join bitter local rivals Bath. In the event, White did become a Bristol player. Along with teammate Daryl Gibson, he joined Leicester Tigers for the 2003–04 season after Bristol were relegated. Replacing the retiring Darren Garforth, his Leicester debut was held over as he was in Australia on duty with England at the 2003 Rugby Union World Cup.

During the World Cup he was in the starting line up against Samoa and came on as a replacement against Uruguay. As part of the victorious squad, White was awarded an MBE.

In 2004, White took the opportunity to demonstrate his scrummaging skills in the England front row during the Six Nations and the summer tour to the Southern Hemisphere.

He was one of the players named in the 2005 British &amp; Irish Lions squad to tour New Zealand, and started in all three tests.

Prior to the 2007 Rugby Union World Cup, White made himself unavailable for selection and did not feature in another England game. In January 2009, it was announced that he had been selected for the England Saxons squad. Later that year, following the suspension of Matt Stevens, he was called up to the full England squad as a replacement.

White was part of the Leicester squads that won the 2007 and 2009 Premiership finals.

==Personal life==
White met his Welsh wife, Sara, in a Cardiff bar in 2004. The couple have two daughters and a son.

<text>John Capel Jr. (born October 27, 1978) is an American former track and field athlete who was a world champion sprinter. Capel played college football for the University of Florida, where he was also a member of the Florida Gators track and field team.

== Early years ==

Capel attended Hernando High School, while there he was considered one of the nation&#x27;s top wide receivers and was also one of the nation&#x27;s top prep sprinters (winning the 100 and 200 meters at the prestigious National Scholastic Championships in the summer of 1997). He was named to several prep All-American teams. He rated as the nation&#x27;s top receiver prospect by &quot;National Recruiting Advisor&quot; and received All-American honors from the publication. He was named to the &quot;Parade&quot; All-American Team. He ranked among the nation&#x27;s top 35 prep players by &quot;The Sporting News&quot;. He played mostly running back, where he rushed for 1,229 yards in 1997 (9.1 avg) with 12 touchdowns and also recorded 28 receptions for 434 yards (15.5 avg) and three touchdowns. He was named to Florida&#x27;s Super Seniors Team. He won the state 4A championship as a junior in 1997 in both the 100 (10.49) and 200 (21.01) meters.

== College career ==

Capel accepted an athletic scholarship to attend the University of Florida, where he played for coach Steve Spurrier&#x27;s Florida Gators football team in 1998 and 1999.

Capel played in every game as a true freshman in 1998, earning his only career start when the team opened with a three-receiver formation against South Carolina. He had two receptions for four yards and rushed the ball 11 times for 80 yards (7.3 avg) and a touchdown. He returned eight punts for 77 yards (9.6 avg) and 10 kickoffs for 274 yards (27.4 avg). Against Georgia he scored his first career touchdown, an eight-yard run. Against Syracuse in the Orange Bowl he returned three punts for 29 yards and two kickoffs for 37 yards.

As a sophomore in 1999, Capel again played in every game, listed third on the depth chart at flanker. He did not participate in spring football drills due to schedule conflicts with his commitments to the school&#x27;s track team. He recorded nine receptions for 84 yards (9.3 avg) and 63 yards on nine carries (7.0 avg). He returned nine kickoffs for 141 yards (15.7 avg) and two punts for -3 yards. Against Alabama in the SEC Championship Game he rushed the ball twice for seven yards. Against Michigan State in the Citrus Bowl he recorded 109 yards on five kickoff returns with a long of 38 yards.

Capel did not play football in 2000, while he was competing as a sprinter on the U.S. Olympic team. After the Olympics, he decided to forgo his remaining NCAA college eligibility and entered the 2001 NFL draft.

== Amateur track career ==

Capel was a standout sprinter in high school, he arrived on the world competition stage in 1999. He withdrew from Florida in April 2000 to concentrate on track.

In 1997, Capel won the National Scholastic 100 (10.49) and 200 (21.01) meter dash titles while attending Hernando High School. In 1998, he ran a personal best 10.40 in the 100 meters at Florida. In 1999, he won the NCAA Outdoor 200-meter championship (19.87). He finished second in the NCAA Outdoor 100 meters (10.03), fourth in the USA Outdoor 200-meter finals (20.29). He ran on the winning 4 x 100-meters relay at World University Games. He ran a 10.12 100 meters, a mark that ranks second best in University of Florida history, behind only Olympic medalist Dennis Mitchell. He won the Southeastern Conference Outdoor 200m dash title in a Florida record 19.99 (the time ranked as the top American mark and the second fastest time in the world when run). He was named Florida&#x27;s Most Valuable Track Athlete.

== Professional football career ==

Capel tested positive for marijuana use at the 2001 NFL Combine, and was arrested a few months later for possession of marijuana. He was selected in the seventh round (208th overall) of the 2001 NFL draft by the Chicago Bears, but was released during training camp. He then spent part of training camp in 2002 with the Kansas City Chiefs, but was again released before the season.

== Professional track career ==

Capel won the 200-meter sprint at the 2000 U.S. Olympic Trials with a personal-best of 19.85 seconds; he finished eighth in the 200-meter final with a time 20.49 at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia. He finished second in the 200-meter sprint at the NCAA indoor track championships, running the distance in 20.26 seconds and breaking the American indoor record. He finished fourth at the Pontiac Grand Prix Invitational (10.13). He finished second at the Adidas Oregon Track Classic 100 (10.21), third in 200 (20.42). He had bests of 10.12 in a heat at the Olympic Trials and 19.85.

Capel&#x27;s major athletic highlight came in winning the 200-meter gold medal at the 2003 World Championships, held at the Stade de France in Saint Denis, Paris, France. In August 2005, he won the bronze medal in the 200-meter at the 2005 World Championships.

=== Ban and return to track ===

Capel tested positive in 2004 and then again at the IAAF Norwich Union Indoor Grand Prix in February 2006, that time for a cannabinoid, which resulted in a two-year ban from track. Since his two-year ban for testing positive in 2006, he has become clean, and returned to competition, which he attributes to his then 7-year-old daughter searching for his name online and learning of his past troubles.

In June 2008, Capel traveled to Eugene, Oregon to compete to make the American Men&#x27;s Olympic Sprint team, which would represent the United States of America in the 2008 Summer Olympics, in Beijing, China. He failed to advance out of the semifinals, but recorded a time of 10.06 seconds: a strong performance after two years away from track competition.

== Life after sports ==

When not competing in track meets, Capel worked for Flagstone Pavers in Brooksville, Florida, driving a forklift and picking defective blocks from outgoing orders. He also served as a coach for track and field and football at his alma mater, Hernando High School in Brooksville, Florida. As of 2013, he was working as an assistant at Oak Hill Hospital. He is married to his high school sweetheart, with whom he has four children.

== Personal bests ==
*
As of August 2024, Capel holds three track records for 200 metres including Athens, Georgia, USA (19.99, 1999), Boise, Idaho (19.87, 1999) and Sacramento, California (19.85, 2000).

<doc id="779751" wikidata="Q656629" url="?curid=779751" title="William Penn (Royal Navy officer)">
<text>Sir William Penn (23 April 1621 – 16 September 1670) was an English admiral and politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1660 to 1670. He was the father of William Penn, founder of the colonial Province of Pennsylvania, which is now the US Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.

== Early life ==
Penn was born in St Thomas Parish, Bristol to Captain Giles Penn, English militar and consul of Salé and his wife Joan Gilbert. He served his apprenticeship at sea with his father.

==Career==
===Naval career===
In the First English Civil War of 1642–1646, he fought on the side of the Parliament, and commanded a ship in the squadron maintained against the king in the Irish seas. The service was arduous and called for both energy and good seamanship. In 1648, he was arrested and sent to London, but was soon released, and sent back as rear-admiral in the &quot;Assurance&quot;. The exact cause of the arrest remains unknown, but it may be presumed that he came under suspicion of corresponding with the king&#x27;s supporters. It is highly probable that he did so, for, until the Restoration of 1660, he was regularly in communication with the Royalists, while serving the parliament, or Cromwell, so long as their service was profitable, and making no scruple of applying for grants of the confiscated lands of the king&#x27;s Irish friends.

After 1650, Penn served as commander-in-chief of the southern fleet in the Atlantic and in the Mediterranean in pursuit of the Royalists under Prince Rupert. After an action at Macroom in County Cork, Ireland he was awarded Macroom Castle. He was so active on this service that when he returned home on 18 March 1651 he could boast that he had not put foot on shore for more than a year.

In the First Anglo-Dutch War (1652–1654), he served in the navy of the Commonwealth of England, commanding squadrons at the battles of the Kentish Knock (1652), Portland, the Gabbard and Scheveningen (1653). In this last battle, a sniper from his ship killed Dutch admiral and fleet commander Maarten Tromp on the Dutch flagship &quot;Brederode&quot;.

In 1654, he offered to carry the fleet over to the king, but in October of the same year he had no scruple in accepting the naval command in the expedition to the West Indies sent out by Cromwell. In 1655, he commanded the fleet that launched a bungled attack on La Hispaniola. He was not responsible for the shameful repulse at San Domingo, which was due to a panic among the troops. Jamaica was ruled by the heirs of Christopher Columbus, until gradually the Catholic Church grew to dominate the island. The crypto-Jewish population following the strengthening of the church aided the English who seized the less desirable island for the Commonwealth régime, and Penn established the Jamaica Station there. On their return, he and his military colleague, Robert Venables, were sent to the Tower. He made a humble submission, and when released retired to the estates of confiscated land he had received in Ireland. On 20 December 1658, Penn was knighted by Henry Cromwell at Dublin Castle, but the Protectorate honour passed into oblivion at the Restoration in May 1660.

===Political career===
In April 1660, Penn was elected as one of the Members of Parliament for Weymouth and Melcombe Regis and sat in the Convention Parliament. He played a small part in the Restoration: in May 1660 he was on the Earl of Sandwich&#x27;s ship, the &quot;Naseby&quot;), which was sent to bring King Charles II home to England from his exile at Amsterdam in the Dutch Republic. During the voyage, Penn made himself known to the Duke of York, who was soon to be appointed Lord High Admiral, and with whom he had a lasting influence.

In 1661, Penn was re-elected as a member for Weymouth and Melcombe Regis in the Cavalier Parliament. In the Second Anglo-Dutch War, he was flag captain at the Battle of Lowestoft (1665), serving under James, Duke of York, and later in the same year was admiral of one of the fleets sent to intercept Ruyter, despite suffering from gout.

Although Penn was not a high-minded man, he is a figure of considerable importance in English naval history. As admiral and General at Sea for Parliament, he helped in 1653 to draw up the first code of tactics provided for the English navy, &quot;Duties of a Commander at Sea, 1664, Instructions by Sir W. Penn&quot;. It became the basis of the &quot;Duke of York&#x27;s Sailing and Fighting Instructions&quot;, which continued for long to supply the orthodox tactical creed of the navy. Penn was an early proponent of fighting in line ahead, so as to bring as much firepower as possible to bear.

===Legacy===

A key source for the adult life of Penn is the diary of his colleague at the Navy Board, and next door neighbour in Seething Lane, Samuel Pepys. However, Pepys&#x27;s assessments have to be tempered by the jealousy that he evidently held for Penn.

In 1660, Penn was appointed a Commissioner of the Navy Board, where he worked with Pepys, Clerk of the Acts. The character of &quot;mean fellow&quot;, or &quot;false knave&quot;, given him by Pepys is borne out by much that is otherwise known of him. He also was an excellent seaman and a good fighter. Like Pepys and the Earl of Sandwich, Penn was a &quot;moderate&quot; Roundhead who succeeded in maintaining his position at the Restoration. Penn appears several times in Pepys diary. A typical entry from 5 April 1666 reads, &quot;To the office, where the falsenesse and impertinencies of Sir W. Pen would make a man mad to think of.&quot;

He is also referenced in an entry from 1665, which states, &quot;At night home and up to the leads [roof], were contrary to expectation driven down again with a stinke by Sir W. Pen&#x27;s shying of a shitten pot in their house of office&quot;.

The diary entry for 4 July 1666 includes a long account of Penn&#x27;s analysis of what was to be learned from the Four Days&#x27; Battle, which ended with the statement, &quot;He did talk very rationally to me, insomuch that I took more pleasure this night in hearing him discourse then I ever did in my life in anything that he said.&quot;

As a native of the West Country, Sir William Penn is buried in the church of St Mary Redcliffe in Bristol. His helm and half-armour are hung on the wall, together with the tattered banners of Dutch ships that he captured in battle. His portrait by Lely, part of the Flagmen of Lowestoft series, is in the Painted Hall at Greenwich. After his death, his son, William, accepted the grant of land in the American colonies in lieu of money owed by the Crown to his father. William Penn had wanted to call the land &quot;New Wales&quot;, which was objected to by the Secretary of State, Privy Council member and Welshman Leoline Jenkins. Penn instead put forward the name &quot;Sylvania&quot;. The Council then chose to tweak this new name a bit by adding the prefix &quot;Penn&quot; to honour the late Admiral, William Penn&#x27;s father. After some protestation from William Penn, he reluctantly accepted it.

==Personal life==

On 6 June 1643, he married Margaret Jasper, a daughter of John Jasper, a wealthy Dutch merchant from Rotterdam. They had three children:
*William Penn (1644–1718), who married Gulielma Maria Springett (1644–1694), and later, Hannah Margaret Callowhill (1671–1726) 
*Margaret &quot;Pegg&quot; Penn, who married Anthony Lowther
*Richard Penn

<text>The Second Congress of Rastatt, which began its deliberations in November 1797, was intended to negotiate a general peace between the French Republic and the Holy Roman Empire, and to draw up a compensation plan to compensate those princes whose lands on the left bank of the Rhine had been seized by France in the War of the First Coalition. Facing the French delegation was a 10-member Imperial delegation made up of delegates from the electorates of Mainz, Saxony, Bavaria, Hanover, as well as the secular territories of Austria, Baden, Hesse-Darmstadt, the Prince-Bishopric of Würzburg, and the imperial cities of Augsburg and Frankfurt. The congress was interrupted when Austria and Russia resumed war against France in March 1799 at the start of the War of the Second Coalition, thus rendering the proceedings moot. Furthermore, as the French delegates attempted to return home, they were attacked by Austrian cavalrymen or possibly French royalists masquerading as such. Two diplomats were killed and a third seriously injured. The congress was held at Rastatt near Karlsruhe.

==Rastatt==
Widespread disagreement among the German delegates precluded the drawing up of a compensation plan but two important results were nevertheless achieved during the first months of the congress: the official recognition of the loss of the entire left bank to France, and the recognition that any compensation plan should be based on the secularization of the ecclesiastical states of the Empire. It is on this basis that deliberations on a compensation plan will resume after the signing of the Treaty of Lunéville in February 1801.

As the three French representatives were leaving the town in April 1799 they were waylaid by a group of Hungarian hussars. Two of them were assassinated, while Jean Debry received thirteen sabre slashes but escaped. The origin of this outrage remains shrouded in mystery, but the balance of evidence seems to show that the Austrian authorities had commanded their men to seize the papers of the French plenipotentiaries in order to avoid damaging disclosures about Austria&#x27;s designs on Bavaria, and that the soldiers had exceeded their instructions. On the other hand, some authorities think that the deed was the work of French Émigrés, or of the party in France in favour of war.

Since it was expected that a major territorial reorganization of the Empire would result from the congress, it was followed with considerable interest, even passion, throughout Germany. Although indecisive from a diplomatic point of view the Congress brought high society to the area of Baden and was responsible for resurgence of interest in the spa town of Baden-Baden.

<text>Rastatt () is a town with a Baroque core, District of Rastatt, Baden-Württemberg, Germany. It is located in the Upper Rhine Plain on the Murg river, above its junction with the Rhine and has a population of around 51,000 (2022). Rastatt was an important place of the War of the Spanish Succession (Treaty of Rastatt) and the Revolutions of 1848 in the German states.

==History==
Until the end of the 17th century, Rastatt held little influence, but after its destruction by the French in 1689, it was rebuilt on a larger scale by Louis William, Margrave of Baden, the Imperial General in the Great Turkish War known popularly as &quot;Türkenlouis&quot;.

It then remained the residence of the Margraves of Baden-Baden until 1771. It was the location of the First and Second Congress of Rastatt, the former giving rise to the Treaty of Rastatt while the second ended in failure in 1799. In the 1840s, Rastatt was surrounded by fortifications to form the Fortress of Rastatt. For about 20 years previous to 1866, it was occupied by the troops of the German Confederation.

The Baden revolution of 1849 began with a mutiny of soldiers at Rastatt in May 1849 under Ludwik Mieroslawski and Gustav Struve, and ended there a few weeks later with the capture of the town by the Prussians. (See The Revolutions of 1848 in the German states and History of Baden.) For some years, Rastatt was one of the strongest fortresses of the German empire, but its fortifications were dismantled in 1890.

In the same year, the town&#x27;s railway station was relocated closer to the centre of Rastatt, from a location formerly outside the town walls, in what is now an industrial area.

Between 1946 and 1954, about twenty major criminal proceedings (known as the Rastatt Trials) for crimes against foreign workers and prisoners in smaller camps in the National Socialist camp system in south-west Germany took place in front of the French Military Administration&#x27;s Tribunal Général on the basis of Control Council Law No. 10, along with more than 2000 defendants.

In 1992, a new Mercedes-Benz car factory started production in Rastatt.

The municipality borders on (from the north clockwise): Marktsteft, Obernbreit, Martinsheim, Oberickelsheim, Ochsenfurt, Frickenhausen am Main and Segnitz.

==History==
===Roman settlement===

Near Markbreit, the site of a large Roman legionary fortress (or &quot;castrum legionarium&quot;) known locally as the &quot;Römerlager Marktbreit&quot;, was discovered in 1985 and celebrated as a minor scientific sensation because it was never suspected that a legionary fortress was built so far northeast in enemy territory. It was built in Augustan times in enemy territory beyond the &quot;Limes&quot; frontier in preparation for an invasion of the rest of Germany.

It was identified on aerial photos in 1985, and archaeologists were active in 1986-1992. The palisade (2¼ km long, using 21,000 trees) appeared to be finished and several buildings were complete. The surface area of 37 ha suggested that the base was built for two legions or one legion and many auxiliary troops. There were no traces of actual occupation and it took some time to conclude that this was not the result of erosion, but from the fact that the base had been prepared but was never used.

The headquarters (&quot;praetorium&quot;), the residences of three centurions, store rooms (&quot;horrea&quot;), and kilns had already been finished before the settlement was abandoned. There are no traces of violence, and precious objects appear to have been taken away, which suggests that the Marktbreit &quot;castrum&quot; was evacuated when strategic realities had changed and made it unnecessary.

However, a rebellion in Pannonia delayed the execution of the invasion plan, and the defeat of Varus in the Teutoburg Forest put an end to all Roman ambitions east of the Rhine, and the base was never used.

===Later history===

Gnodstadt was first mentioned in a document in 1124. Marktbreit was first mentioned as &quot;broite inferior&quot; in a document of the Count of Castell in 1258. From 1351 Gnodstadt was ruled by Hohenlohe-Brauneck. In 1557, King Ferdinand granted Marktbreit the right to hold markets, thus the name &quot;Markt&quot;breit that has since been used.

In the 17th and 18th century Marktbreit was an important marketplace because the shortest way to the Danube from the Main (which flows into the Rhine) starts in Marktbreit.

In 1806, Marktbreit came to the Kingdom of Bavaria.

Gnodstadt became a part of Marktbreit on 1 May 1978.

==Government==

<text>James Pollard Espy (or the Storm King) (May 9, 1785 – January 24, 1860) was a U.S. meteorologist. Espy developed a convection theory of storms, explaining it in 1836 before the American Philosophical Society and in 1840 before the French Académie des Sciences and the British Royal Society. His theory was published in 1840 as &quot;The Philosophy of Storms&quot;. He became meteorologist to the War (1842) and Navy (1848) departments and developed the use of the telegraph in assembling weather observation data by which he studied the progress of storms and laid the basis for scientific weather forecasting.

==Life and career==

Espy had an ardent desire for knowledge and commenced teaching school as a means to obtaining a classical education at Transylvania University, Lexington, Kentucky. After leaving the University in 1808 he taught an academy at Cumberland, Maryland. He studied law and practiced that profession four years at Xenia, Ohio. In 1812 he married Miss Margaret Pollard and took her last name as his middle name. In 1817 he became a teacher of classics in Philadelphia where he lived for 20 years. He soon, however, had his attention drawn to natural science and about 1828 he began his studies and investigations into the cause of storms which made him, at that time, the foremost American meteorologist. In 1833 he wrote a summary of his theory of the upward movement of the air in storms (convection) and of their self-sustaining power from the evolution of latent heat.

In 1834 Espy became meteorologist for both the Franklin Institute and the American Philosophical Society (APS) of Philadelphia. As chair of a joint committee, he established a network of weather observers to study storms. He convinced the Pennsylvania legislature to appropriate $4,000 to equip an observer in each county with barometer, thermometers, and rain gage. One result is the first appearance of meteorology in the records of Congress. For this work, he was elected a member of the APS in 1835.

In 1836 he abandoned the profession of teaching and began lecturing before scientific bodies and popular audiences. These lectures caused him to be popularly known as the Storm King. In 1840 he visited Europe and presented his theory of storms before the British Science Association and the French Academy of Science. It was during the discussion that followed the presentation of his theory before the French Academy that the French physicist and astronomer, Francois Arago said: “France has its Cuvier, England its Newton, America its Espy.” 

In 1841 his &quot;The Philosophy of Storms&quot; was published in Boston. In this book Espy proposed to burn Appalachian forests to make it rain, is perhaps the earliest idea for climate engineering.
In 1843 he was appointed the first meteorologist of the U.S. Government and was assigned to duty, first under the Surgeon General of the Army, next under the Secretary of the Navy and finally in 1848 under the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.

His work in Washington, D. C. was concluded in 1859 and he then spent some time in visiting his relatives and friends in Ohio and Pennsylvania. While on a visit to Cincinnati, Ohio, Professor Espy was stricken with paralysis January 17, 1860 and died at the residence of his nephew, John Westcott, January 24. He was buried in the cemetery at Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, by the side of his wife who had passed on ten years earlier.

<text>Alphonso Michael Espy (born November 30, 1953) is an American lawyer and politician who served as the 25th United States secretary of agriculture from 1993 to 1994. He was both the first African American and the first person from the Deep South to hold the position. A member of the Democratic Party, Espy previously served as the U.S. representative for Mississippi&#x27;s 2nd congressional district from 1987 to 1993.

In March 2018, Espy announced his candidacy for the United States Senate seat being vacated by Thad Cochran. Espy placed second in the November 6 nonpartisan special election before facing Republican Cindy Hyde-Smith in a November 27 runoff. Espy lost the runoff, but garnered more than 46% of the vote in what was the closest U.S. Senate election in Mississippi since 1988. He was the Democratic nominee again in the 2020 election and lost to Hyde-Smith by ten percentage points.

==Early life and education==
Espy was born in Yazoo City, Mississippi. He is the grandson of Thomas J. Huddleston Sr., founder of the Afro-American Sons and Daughters, a fraternal society that operated the Afro-American Hospital, a leading provider of health care for black people in the state from the 1920s to the 1970s. Espy attended Howard University in Washington, D.C., and was active in student politics, holding several elective positions. He earned his Juris Doctor from Santa Clara University School of Law in California in 1978. He currently serves on the board of directors of the Mississippi Center for Justice.

==Career==

===Early years===
Espy was an attorney with Central Mississippi Legal Services between 1978 and 1980 and was later the Assistant Secretary of State to Mississippi Legal Services. From 1980 to 1984, he was the Assistant Secretary of the State to the Public Lands Division.

Espy was an Assistant State Attorney General from 1984 to 1985.

===Congress and the Secretary of Agriculture===

In November 1986, Espy was elected as a Democrat to the 100th Congress from . He defeated two-term Republican Webb Franklin to become the first African-American to represent Mississippi at the federal level since the Reconstruction era, a position once held by Mississippi Republican Senator Hiram Revels in 1870-1871. Espy was reelected three times.

In December 1992, Espy was chosen by President-elect Bill Clinton to be the Secretary of Agriculture in the new administration. Following his confirmation by the Senate in late January 1993, Espy resigned from his seat in the House of Representatives.

The first African American and first person from the Deep South to hold the position, Espy served as Secretary of Agriculture from 1993 to 1994. He announced his resignation in October 1994, following questions from the White House over his use of government perks and acceptance of gifts. He was indicted in 1997 for receiving improper gifts, but acquitted of all 30 charges in 1998.

In October 2007, Espy crossed party lines to endorse Republican Mississippi Governor Haley Barbour&#x27;s reelection campaign.

===Private law career===
In 2008, Espy became an attorney at Morgan &amp; Morgan, a nationwide law firm, where he handles general plaintiff&#x27;s law, mass tort, bond and governmental finance, and international relations cases. One of his notable cases was the Pigford lawsuit, where Espy worked in conjunction with a black farmers&#x27; advocacy group, the National Black Farmers Association, to represent those farmers.

===Senate campaigns===
====2018====

On March 5, 2018, Republican Senator Thad Cochran announced he would resign as of April 1 for health reasons, triggering a special election. Espy announced his intention to run for the seat that same day, becoming the first declared candidate in the race. “It’s official. I’m running to be Mississippi’s next U.S. Senator. Too many people here can’t find a decent job, rural hospitals are closing, and the price for education is just too high,” Espy said in a tweet on Tuesday. He called Cochran &quot;a person I admire and respect, and who has done so much for Mississippi over his tenure.&quot;

In 2018, CBS described Espy as a conservative Democrat. He has identified his positions as moderate, making a centrist pitch for his Senate campaign. &quot;The Clarion Ledger&quot; wrote that Espy sought to &quot;play up his bipartisan credentials, like endorsing former Republican Gov. Haley Barbour. Steer the conversation away from anything controversial, even race, and back to health care.&quot; When asked by MSNBC&#x27;s Chris Matthews to comment on President Trump&#x27;s criticism of several African-American journalists, Espy &quot;refused to bite&quot;, instead redirecting the interview to health care.

A nonpartisan special election took place on November 6, 2018, the same day as the regularly scheduled U.S. Senate election for the seat held by Roger Wicker, who was running for reelection. Party affiliations were not printed on the ballot. After no candidate gained a simple majority of the vote, a runoff election between Espy and Republican Cindy Hyde-Smith was held on November 27. Espy lost the runoff with 46% of the vote.

====2020====

Three days after losing the Senate special election runoff to Hyde-Smith, on November 30, 2018, his 65th birthday, Espy filed with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) to run for the seat again in 2020. He lost the general election again with 44% of the vote.

==Political positions==
===Economy===
&quot;National Journal&quot; noted that his liberal social views are mixed with his support for cutting the federal budget and protecting Mississippi&#x27;s defense and agricultural industries. In 2018, Espy said that he wanted to cut the government&#x27;s budget and that he supports free trade. He said he probably would have voted for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 but that he wants to &quot;make sure people see the benefits&quot;.

===Guns===
Espy supports gun ownership and received the National Rifle Association of America&#x27;s (NRA) Silver Rifle Award in 1988 for supporting its positions on gun laws. In 2018, the NRA endorsed Espy&#x27;s opponent, Cindy Hyde-Smith, for the U.S. Senate, and did not give Espy a rating. In 2019, Espy, who had announced his candidacy for Hyde-Smith&#x27;s seat, said that her objection to a unanimous consent motion to adopt a House gun control bill, causing the bill to go through the usual committee process, was &quot;a failure of leadership that puts our children&#x27;s lives in danger.&quot;

===Health care===
Espy believes that the decision by Republicans to deny an expansion of Medicaid is why so many rural hospitals in Mississippi have closed.

=== Immigration ===
Espy opposes a border wall, citing cost concerns. He opposes the Trump administration&#x27;s family separation policy.

=== Social issues ===
In 1986, running for Congress, Espy was considered pro-choice on abortion. In 2018, he said he was moderate on abortion; he supports &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; but opposes abortion personally. Espy said during his Senate campaign that he would work with anyone regardless of race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, or disability.

==Corruption trial and acquittal==
On August 27, 1997, Espy was indicted on charges of receiving improper gifts, including sports tickets, lodging, and airfare. Espy refused to plea bargain and on December 2, 1998, he was acquitted of all 30 criminal charges in the trial. Independent Counsel Donald Smaltz presented more than 70 witnesses during the trial and spent more than $20 million preparing and trying the case.

During testimony before the jury, the prosecution&#x27;s star witness told Smaltz: &quot;God knows, if I had $30 million, I could find dirt on you, sir.&quot; During the trial, Smaltz protested that the defense was injecting race into the trial in what he saw as an appeal to a mostly black jury.

The defense rested without calling any witnesses, arguing simply that the prosecution had not proved its case. The jury deliberated less than 10 hours before finding Espy not guilty on all charges. One of the jurors said, &quot;This was the weakest, most bogus thing I ever saw. I can&#x27;t believe Mr. Smaltz ever brought this to trial.&quot; At least four other jurors echoed this view, though less pointedly. Barbara Bisoni, the only white juror, said Smaltz&#x27;s case &quot;had holes&quot; and that race never entered into the deliberations.

===Related cases===
In 1996, Sun-Diamond Growers was fined $1.5 million for giving Espy $6,000 in gifts; in March 1998 it won a reversal at the Court of Appeals level. Independent Counsel Smaltz appealed that ruling to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the Court of Appeals, finding that the gratuities statute requires a link between a gift and an official act. Unable to make such a link, Smaltz dismissed the gratuities charge against Sun-Diamond. The court&#x27;s unanimous April 1999 opinion, by Justice Antonin Scalia, stated that the prosecutor&#x27;s interpretation of the law was so broad that even a high school principal could be in legal trouble for giving a souvenir baseball cap to a visiting Secretary of Education. The Sun-Diamond decision played a pivotal role in Espy&#x27;s later acquittal because Smaltz was unable to link gifts he received to any official act.

In a separate case during the same investigation, Espy&#x27;s Chief of Staff, Ronald Blackley, was convicted in late 1997 on three counts of making false statements and sentenced to 27 months in prison.

Controversy also arose in 1994 from a White House discovery that a foundation run by Tyson Foods had given Espy&#x27;s then girlfriend, Patricia Dempsey, a $1,200 scholarship. Administration officials said that the discovery of this scholarship was what forced Espy to resign as Secretary of Agriculture. In December 1997, Tyson Foods pleaded guilty to felony charges of giving Espy gifts.

==Personal life==
He married Sheila Bell, with whom he had two children before they divorced. Espy married Portia Ballard in 1999.

<text>Willard Richardson Espy (December 11, 1910February 20, 1999) was an American editor, philologist, writer, poet, and local historian. Raised in the seaside village of Oysterville, Washington, Espy later studied at the University of Redlands in California before becoming an editor in New York City, as well as a contributor to &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot;, &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, &quot;Punch&quot;, and other publications.

In the 1960s, he began publishing books on philology as well collections of poetry collections, and became the best-known collector of and commentator on word play of his time. In 1977, he published the national bestseller &quot;Oysterville: Roads to Grandpa&#x27;s Village&quot;, a semi-autobiographical novel about his familial heritage in the Oysterville community. Espy died at New York Hospital in Manhattan in 1999, and was interred at Oysterville Cemetery.

== Early life ==
Espy was born in Olympia, Washington in 1910, the sixth of seven children, to Harry Albert Espy (1876–1959) and Helen Medora Espy ( Richardson; 1878–1954). His father, a one-time Washington state senator, was of Scots-Irish descent. His mother was from San Francisco, the daughter of a local preacher.

He and his siblings were raised in the coastal village of Oysterville, Washington, which had been founded in 1854 by his grandfather, R. H. Espy, a settler who arrived in Oregon Territory via The Oregon Trail. Espy graduated from the University of Redlands in 1930 with a B.A. after which he spent a year abroad, enrolling at the Sorbonne in Paris, planning to study philosophy. He returned to the United States in 1932, working as a newspaper editor in California, later moving to New York City where he was eventually hired by &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; in 1941. Espy spent next sixteen years working for &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; in various positions, including as promotion director.

==Career==
Espy&#x27;s writing career took off in the late 1960s; he eventually authored fifteen books on language, and his poetry and articles regularly appeared in &quot;Punch&quot;, &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot;, &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot;, &quot;The Nation&quot;, and &quot;Word Ways: The Journal of Recreational Linguistics&quot;. Espy earned praise from contemporary critics such as Louis Untermeyer and John Chancellor. Summarizing Espy&#x27;s writing, critic Alistair Cooke wrote:

Later in life, Espy divided his time between Manhattan and his home in Oysterville, and wrote nationally bestselling books on local history, including &quot;&quot; (1977) and &quot;Skulduggery on Shoalwater Bay&quot; (1998). Two of his books on wordplay, &quot;The Game of Words&quot; and &quot;An Almanac of Words at Play&quot;, were honored at the Governor&#x27;s Writers Day Awards (now the Washington State Book Awards), and the latter was a national bestseller. He was also a contributing writer for &quot;The New Yorker&quot; and other publications.

==Death==

Espy died aged 88 at New York Hospital in Manhattan on February 20, 1999. He is interred in a family plot in Oysterville Cemetery. His second wife Louise, a native of New York, died in November 2011, and was interred beside him.

==Legacy==
The Espy Foundation was established in 1998; the non-profit foundation, based out of Espy&#x27;s home in Oysterville, Washington, served as a retreat space for artists and writers in the Pacific Northwest. In December 2010, the foundation officially closed.

Espy&#x27;s light verse has been compared to that of Lewis Carroll, W. S. Gilbert, Ogden Nash and Cole Porter.

<text>Darvis &quot;Doc&quot; Darell Patton (born December 4, 1977) is a retired American track and field athlete who competed in sprinting events. He is a two-time US Champion in the 200-meter dash and won the silver medal in the event at the 2003 World Championships. He is a three-time Olympian and a four-time participant at the World Athletics Championships.

Patton has had much success with the American 4×100-meter relay team, being a world gold medallist in 2003 and 2007, as well as an Olympic silver medallist (2004). He has also had misfortune in the relay, having been involved in the American team&#x27;s disqualification at the 2008 Summer Olympics, the 2009 World Championships, and the 2011 World Championships.

A multi-talented athlete in the horizontal jumps and sprints, he initially focused on the 200 m but, after missing 2005 and 2006 due to injury, he switched to the 100-meter dash. He won the 100 m silver medal at the 2007 Pan American Games and reached the finals of the event at the 2008 Summer Olympics and the 2009 World Championships. He has broken the 10-second barrier and his personal record of 9.89 seconds places him within the top-ten fastest Americans in the event. He also has bests of 20.03 for the 200 m, 8.12 m for the long jump, and 6.50 seconds for the 60-meter dash (a masters record for over-35 runners).

==Career==

===Early career and college===
Born in Dallas, Texas, the son of William Johnson and Dorrise Patton, Darvis Patton was a very versatile athlete from a young age and he competed in the long jump, triple jump and sprint events at Lake Highlands High School and TCU days. At the AAU Junior Olympic Games in 1998 he won the long jump, was runner-up in the triple jump and placed fourth in the 200-meter dash. He graduated from Garden City Community College that year and won an athletic scholarship at Texas Christian University. While there he began to focus more on the 100-meter dash and 200 m under the coaching of Monte Stratton. He was a finalist at both those distances at the 2000 NCAA Men&#x27;s Outdoor Track and Field Championship. He ended the year with personal records of 6.64 seconds for the 60-meter dash, 10.22 for the 100 m, 20.29 for the 200 m and for the long jump. He was also a semi-finalist in the 200 m at the 2000 United States Olympic Trials.

In his second year of competition at Texas Christian he set lifetime indoor bests of 20.73 for the 200 m and for the long jump. He was a finalist in both events at the NCAA Men&#x27;s Indoor Track and Field Championship. He improved outdoors too, setting personal records of 10.16 seconds for the 100 m and for the long jump in Arlington, Texas. The 2001 NCAA Outdoor Championships saw him earn four All-American honours in one meet: he was sixth in the 100 m, fourth in the long jump, third in the 200 m and won the 4×100-meter relay with the TCU Horned Frogs. He began to establish himself nationally at that year&#x27;s USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships, where he came fourth in the 200 m as well as seventh in the long jump. Patton was later upgraded to third in the 200 m after Ramon Clay was banned for doping.

===First World and Olympic medals===
He had his first successes as a senior in 2002 when he was runner up in the 200 m at both the Indoor and Outdoor US Championships. The retrospective disqualification of Ramon Clay meant he was the American outdoor 200 m champion that year. There were no global track championships that year so he mainly competed on the international circuit. He won the 200 m races in Glasgow and London and was runner-up at the Golden Gala and Memorial Van Damme meets. He improved his 200 m best to 20.12 seconds in Brussels.

The following season saw him reach the global podium for the first time: he became the national champion in the 200 m and went on to win the silver medal in that event at the 2003 World Championships in Athletics behind teammate John Capel. He also won a gold medal as part of the American men&#x27;s 4×100 m relay team including Capel, Bernard Williams and J. J. Johnson. Moving entirely away from the long jump, Patton&#x27;s sprinting times all improved that year: he had a personal record of 6.58 seconds in the 60 m, ran ten seconds flat at the Weltklasse Zürich meeting and ran 20.03 in the World Championships 200 m semi-finals. On the circuit he was runner-up at the Athletissima and Meeting Gaz de France 200 m races and placed fourth at the 2003 IAAF World Athletics Final.

After a fourth-place finish in the 200 m at the 2004 US Olympic Trials, he was nominated as the substitute for the 4×100 m relay at the 2004 Summer Olympics. Patton helped the American team ease through the heats, recording a time of 38.02 seconds. He was substituted for the newly crowned 100 m Olympic champion Justin Gatlin for the final race, but the move backfired for the team as they finished a little slower (38.08) and had to settle for the silver medal behind Great Britain – who they had easily beaten in the heats. Patton&#x27;s 2005 and 2006 seasons were wrecked by significant groin and hip injuries and he only returned to major competitions in 2007.

===Return from injury===

Patton returned to action and focused on the shorter sprint distance that year. He finished eighth in the 100 m final at the 2007 US Championships and withdrew from the 200 m competition. Based on his performance, he was selected to represent the United States at the 2007 Pan American Games. He finished second in the 100 m behind Churandy Martina and anchored the relay team to a bronze medal. He was chosen as part of the relay team for the 2007 World Championships and this time made the final after qualifying. The American team (with Wallace Spearmon, Tyson Gay, and Leroy Dixon) became the world champions in a world-leading time of 37.78 seconds, fending off the Jamaican challengers who set a national record.

At the 2008 United States Olympic Trials, Patton achieved his lifetime best performance in the 100 m, running 9.89 seconds in the quarter-finals. He went even quicker in the wind-assisted (+3.1 m/s) final, clocking 9.84 seconds, and came in third place behind Tyson Gay and Walter Dix. He broke the 10-second barrier legally for the second time at the Herculis meet in Monaco, placing second behind Asafa Powell in 9.98 seconds. During the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing he was the slowest qualifier for the 100 m final. In the final itself he ran 10.03 seconds and was again the slowest and thus the eighth placed athlete. Together with Rodney Martin, Travis Padgett and Tyson Gay he also competed at the 4 × 100 m relay, but they did not finish due to a mistake in the baton exchange between Patton and Gay and they were eliminated.

The following year Patton came second to Michael Rodgers in a close 100 m race at the 2009 US championships in June, running a windy 9.92 seconds. This won him a place on the American team for the 2009 World Championships in Athletics. Prior to the event, he was runner-up in Monaco and in Stockholm – running a wind-assisted 9.95 seconds behind Tyson Gay at the latter. He managed to reach the final of the men&#x27;s 100 meters after scoring a season&#x27;s best of 9.98 in the semi-finals. He performed poorly in the final however, finishing last with a slow time of 10.34 seconds due to an injury. The hopes of the American men&#x27;s relay team were again dashed by an illegal baton exchange, this time between Patton and Shawn Crawford. Patton ended his season on a high: he ran a series of sub-10 runs including 9.95 for third at the Weltklasse, 9.94 to win the Hanžeković Memorial, and a personal record-equalling run of 9.89 seconds for third at the Shanghai Golden Grand Prix, behind Tyson Gay and Asafa Powell. He also placed third in the 100 m at the Memorial Van Damme and the 2009 IAAF World Athletics Final.

===Second Olympic medal===
Patton&#x27;s 2010 season was brought to an end in May due to another injury. He returned in 2011 and began racing more frequently in the 200 m. At the 2011 USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships he was sixth in the 100 m but managed second place to Walter Dix in the 200 m. The 2011 World Championships in Athletics was one of his less successful global outings. He was eliminated in the 200 m semi-finals and in the relay final he clashed with Britain&#x27;s Harry Aikines-Aryeetey and failed to pass the baton successfully. He had season&#x27;s bests of 9.94 seconds for the 100 m and 20.25 seconds for the 200 m.

The 2012 United States Olympic Trials he placed fifth in both the 100 m and 200 m. Although he had failed to gain an individual spot, he was chosen for the relay team. At the 2012 London Olympics he ran as a substitute runner in the qualifiers but even the weaker American team of Jeff Demps, Patton, Trell Kimmons, and Justin Gatlin broke the national record of 37.38 seconds. The American team for the final (bringing in Tyson Gay and Ryan Bailey) improved that record further to 37.04 seconds but was still second behind the world record-breaking Jamaican team. Patton received his second Olympic silver medal in the relay as a result.

He began 2013 with quick times, running 6.50 for the 60 m (a world record for over-35 athletes) and a wind-aided 100 m time of 9.75 seconds.

== USATF Athlete&#x27;s Advisory Committee &amp; Board of Directors ==
Patton announced his retirement in 2013 on Instagram and went on to pursue coaching. Before hanging up his spikes, Patton served as the Men&#x27;s Sprints Event Leader on the USATF Athlete&#x27;s Advisory Committee. In this role, he advocated for elite sprint athletes and was the primary point of contact for competition issues, questions regarding tier privileges, benefits, and provided the men&#x27;s constituency with updates on competition site selections and changes to USATF rules and regulations.

Thereafter, the veteran sprinter&#x27;s peers elected him to a four-year term as a member of the USATF Board of Directors, again representing the Athlete&#x27;s Advisory Committee. There, he reviewed event constituent budgets as member of the budget committee to ensure efficient, appropriate use and allocation of funds in accordance with USATF policy. He also helped ensure athletes in all track and field disciplines had access to unified representation in various aspects of USATF, including staff selections, drug testing and competition rules.

== Coaching ==
In 2015, Darvis served as the assistant sprint and hurdles coach for the USA Track and Field delegation for the IAAF World Relay Championship and NACAC Senior Championship relay teams, bringing home ten medals in the process and an additional four medals from Penn Relays. 
He also served as the head track coach at All Saints Episcopal School in Fort Worth from 2019 to 2022, where the program broke school records in the high jump, 4x100 meter race, placed fourth in the 2015 state championship – the highest place finish in the school&#x27;s 70-year history – and produced the school&#x27;s first state champion in the men&#x27;s 100m dash.

Patton joined the Texas Wesleyan University staff in March 2022 as the assistant track and field coach where he specializes in short sprints and jumps. In his first two years, Patton helped lead the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s track team to their first conference titles in school history and produced Texas Wesleyan&#x27;s first national track and field champion in the 400m, 60m hurdles and 110m hurdles. In 2023, the United States Track &amp; Field and Cross Country Coaches Association named Darvis Patton the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics Assistant Coach of the Year for Women&#x27;s Outdoor Track &amp; Field in the South Central Region. He was promoted to associate head coach for the Texas Wesleyan track and field program in 2024.

==Personal life==
He and his wife Crystal have a daughter, Dakota, and son, Darvis II. He is a proud former member of Big Brothers Big Sisters of America and serves as a youth mentor.

<doc id="779772" wikidata="Q388216" url="?curid=779772" title="Deee-Lite">
<text>Deee-Lite was an American house and dance music group formed in New York City. The group&#x27;s single &quot;Groove Is in the Heart,&quot; which was released in 1990 from their debut studio album, &quot;World Clique&quot; (1990), was a top-ten hit in multiple countries. In December 2016, &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked them as the 55th most successful dance artists of all time.

==History==
===1986–1989: Background and early history===
The band began in 1986 as a duo, in New York City, with Lady Miss Kier (born Kierin Magenta Kirby, primarily on vocals) and Supa DJ Dmitry (born in USSR as Dmitry Brill) as DJ. The two then became a trio when Korean-Japanese DJ Towa Tei joined the group in 1988.

Beginning in 1986, Kier and Dmitry performed their songs monthly at various downtown New York nightclubs; in 1987, Kier bought an Akai S900 sampler, which influenced their sound tremendously. She also bought a Casio FZ-series sampler, which was used almost exclusively on their debut album. Indeed, sampling played such an important role in their music that they named their production company &quot;Sampladelic&quot;. From the band&#x27;s inception, Kier designed their promotional posters and club fliers, and was also the graphic designer for all three of their albums and 12&quot; singles. The group played at hip hop and house clubs, at both gay clubs and straight establishments, and at the New York drag festival &quot;Wigstock&quot;. They also opened for Native Tongue Movement&#x27;s De La Soul and Jungle Brothers. As described by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;they were drawing vivid, multiracial, pan-sexual crowds...&quot;. Part of the band&#x27;s appeal was their inclusivity, as noted by &quot;Mademoiselle&quot; magazine: &quot;as a group, they&#x27;re a festival of individuality; as a band, they&#x27;re a party anyone can attend.&quot; These live shows garnered a steady following, and attracted future third member Towa Tei as a fan.

In 1988, Towa sent Kier and Dmitry a bedroom demo tape he had made, and they realised he, like them, also enjoyed a fusion of funk and techno. Towa and Dmitry began jointly-programming the band&#x27;s computer. Although Towa did not play any instruments, he was a record collector and added various sounds and samples. Kier and Dmitry invited him to join the group that year, and together the three produced their first album. Kier wrote all the lyrics and melodies, and also asked bass guitarist Bootsy Collins to join-in on recording sessions. Dmitry played guitar, keyboard, and bass, while Towa gathered samples for fill-ins and grooves. Collins introduced the trio to The Horny Horns, Fred Wesley, Maceo Parker, Mudbone Cooper, and Bernie Worrell, and also helped assemble their touring ensemble. Together, Deee-Lite would produce their first and second albums under their own production company, Sampladelic.

===1990–1997: Album releases and fame===
In 1990, the group released their first album, &quot;World Clique&quot;, preceded by the debut single &quot;Groove Is in the Heart&quot;, which became a hit in many countries, including No. 1 in Australia and topping the &quot;Billboard&quot; US Dance Club Songs chart. The song features vocals from Q-Tip (of A Tribe Called Quest) as well as a bass guitar loop sampled from Herbie Hancock&#x27;s &quot;Bring Down The Birds&quot; (1967), with additional vocals by collaborator and funk musician Bootsy Collins. In 1992, they released their politically-charged second album, &quot;Infinity Within&quot;. The album failed to chart as high as their debut, but they still managed two Top 10 dance hits in the US with &quot;Runaway&quot; and &quot;Pussycat Meow&quot;.

Towa ultimately did not join the group on their world tours, for which they had assembled a nine-piece band, as he had desired to start working on the second Deee-Lite album (&quot;Infinity Within&quot;) from the comfort of his own home, where his records and samples were kept. As expressed to MTV News: &quot;...a reason I left Deee-Lite was that I hated the touring—playing the same songs over and over again every night,&quot; Towa said. &quot;I&#x27;m not that type of person. I don&#x27;t like being in front of the people.&quot; After extensively touring, Kier and Dmitry were not given funding for &quot;Infinity Within&quot;, as originally promised by their Warner contract. Upon the release of the album, Kier and Dmitry wondered if Deee-Lite&#x27;s overall sound was &quot;losing touch&quot; with the dancefloor crowds, and thus they began creating the dancefloor album &quot;Dewdrops in the Garden&quot; (1994). At the time, creative differences were intensifying with Towa and Kier and Dmitry. Speaking again to MTV News, Towa explained: &quot;When I made a big decision to take a break, I started to listen to different types of music again—bossa nova, soundtracks. I started getting materials that went beyond the Deee-Lite concept. For me it fit, but for them it didn&#x27;t really fit.&quot; Prior to the release of &quot;Dewdrops in the Garden&quot;, Towa abruptly left the band (appearing only on the track &quot;Call Me&quot;), and was replaced by DJ Ani. Kier was determined to keep the band together, and offered Towa the chance to remix a song of his choice so he&#x27;d have a presence on the third Deee-Lite album. Even with a lineup change and minimal record label support, Deee-Lite managed to tour for another year after the release of the album, selling even more records than their sophomore release. In 1994, Kier and Dmitry&#x27;s increasingly turbulent relationship came to an end, as did the group.

In total, the group scored six No. 1 hits on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Dance Club Play chart over the five years they were together. In the years since the band&#x27;s dissolution, financial problems due to bad management impacted both Kier and Dmitry; however, they persevered and are both still in-business as writers, producers and DJs. Kier is still primarily a singer-songwriter and DJ, having traveled extensively and recorded on numerous albums with internationally acclaimed artists. She is often regarded as a style &quot;icon&quot; by publications, such as &quot;Vogue&quot;, for her distinctive style of dress and perpetual influence on the international fashion scene. Dmitry continued working as a DJ, everywhere from Hong Kong to Jerusalem, from Berlin&#x27;s Love Parade to Brazil&#x27;s Rock In Rio. He was given the &quot;DJ of the year&quot; award in Ibiza, and has remixed with post-editing by Marty Munsch on several versions, for many artists including Arthur Russell, Jungle Brothers, Sinéad O&#x27;Connor, Ziggy Marley, Nina Hagen, Ultra Naté, and others. He collaborated with Julee Cruise (of &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;/David Lynch fame) to release the album &quot;My Secret Life&quot; (2011). Dmitry is currently based in Berlin, where he continues to DJ, compose, produce and remix. 

Towa Tei has recorded several albums as a solo artist, and was featured in the Japanese supergroup METAFIVE. In a 2011 interview, Tei denied the possibility of Deee-Lite reuniting, even fleetingly, citing the creative and personal differences that prompted him to depart in the first place.

<text>The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex, for a time also entitled Elizabeth the Queen, is a 1939 American historical romantic drama film directed by Michael Curtiz and starring Bette Davis, Errol Flynn, and Olivia de Havilland. Based on the play &quot;Elizabeth the Queen&quot; by Maxwell Anderson—which had a successful run on Broadway with Lynn Fontanne and Alfred Lunt in the lead roles—the film fictionalizes the historical relationship between Queen Elizabeth I and Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex. The screenplay was written by Norman Reilly Raine and Aeneas MacKenzie.

It was the fifth of nine films that Flynn and de Havilland starred in, while it was the second of his three with Davis.

The supporting cast included Donald Crisp, Henry Daniell, Henry Stephenson, and Vincent Price. The score was composed by Erich Wolfgang Korngold, who later used a theme from the film in his Symphony in F sharp major. The Technicolor cinematography was by Sol Polito, and the elaborate costumes were designed by Orry-Kelly.

The film was a Warner Bros. Pictures production, and became the hit the studio had anticipated and returned a handsome profit. Among the film&#x27;s five Academy Award nominations was a nomination for Best Color Cinematography. Bette Davis was tipped to receive an Academy Award nomination for her role; however, she was nominated for &quot;Dark Victory&quot; (also from Warner) instead.

==Plot==
The Earl of Essex returns in triumph to London after having dealt the Spanish a crushing naval defeat at Cadiz. In London, an aging Queen Elizabeth awaits him with love, but also with fear, because of his popularity with the commoners and his consuming ambition. His envious rivals include Sir Robert Cecil, Lord Burghley, and Sir Walter Raleigh. His only friend at court is Francis Bacon.

Instead of the praise he expects, Essex is stunned when Elizabeth criticizes him for his failure to capture the Spanish treasure fleet as he had promised. When his co-commanders are rewarded, Essex protests, precipitating a break between the lovers. He leaves for his estates.

Elizabeth pines for him but refuses to degrade herself by recalling him. But when Hugh O&#x27;Neill, 2nd Earl of Tyrone revolts and routs the English forces in Ireland, the Queen has the excuse she needs to summon Essex. She intends to make him Master of the Ordnance, a safe position at court. However, his enemies goad him into taking command of the army to be sent to quash the rebellion. 
Essex pursues Tyrone, though his letters to Elizabeth begging for much-needed men and supplies go unanswered. Unbeknownst to him, his letters to her, and hers to him, are being intercepted by Lady Penelope Grey, a lady-in-waiting who loves him too. Finally, Elizabeth, believing herself to be scorned, sends him orders to disband his army and return to London.

Furious, Essex ignores the order, orders a night march, and thinks he has finally cornered his foe. However, at a parley, Tyrone points out the smoke rising from the English camp, signifying the destruction of the food and ammunition the English army needs. Essex accepts Tyrone&#x27;s terms; he and his men disarm and sail back to England.

Thinking he has been betrayed, he leads his army in a march on London to seize the crown for himself. Elizabeth offers no resistance to his forces, but once alone with him, convinces him that she will accept the kingdom&#x27;s joint rule. He then naively disbands his army, and he is quickly arrested and condemned to death.

The day of his execution, Elizabeth can wait no longer. She summons him, hoping he will abandon his ambition in return for his life (which she is eager to grant). However, Essex tells her that he will always be a danger to her and walks to the chopping block.

==Production==
===Sources===
The film was based on the stage play by Maxwell Anderson, &quot;Elizabeth the Queen&quot;, which had premiered on Broadway in 1930 starring Lynn Fontanne and Alfred Lunt.

===Film re-titling===
The title of the film was originally to be the same as the play, but Flynn demanded his presence be acknowledged in the title. However, the new title, &quot;The Knight and the Lady,&quot; upset Davis, who felt it gave the male lead more importance than her and was, to her mind, essentially &quot;a woman&#x27;s story.&quot; She sent at least two telegrams in April and June 1938 to studio president Jack L. Warner demanding that the title include the character of Elizabeth by name and before the character of Essex, or she would refuse to make the film. &quot;Elizabeth and Essex,&quot; one of Davis&#x27;s preferred titles, was already under copyright as the title of a book written by Lytton Strachey. In the end, the studio acquiesced and gave the film the title it bears today, mirroring the titles of earlier historical films such as &quot;The Private Life of Henry VIII&quot; and &quot;The Private Life of Don Juan&quot;.

===On-screen partnership of Davis and Flynn===
Davis recounted later in life her difficulties in making the film. She had been very enthusiastic about the challenge of playing Elizabeth (in 1955, she would play her as an old woman in &quot;The Virgin Queen&quot;). She had lobbied for Laurence Olivier to play the part of Essex, but Warner Brothers, nervous at giving the part to an actor who was relatively unknown in the United States, instead cast Errol Flynn, who was at the height of his success. Davis felt he was not equal to the task, and also believed from past experience that his casual attitude to his work would be reflected in his performance.

For her own part, Davis studied the life of Elizabeth, worked hard to adopt a passable accent, and shaved her hairline to achieve a greater resemblance. Many years later, however, Davis viewed the film with her friend, Olivia de Havilland. At the film&#x27;s end, Davis turned to de Havilland and admitted, &quot;I was wrong, wrong, wrong. Flynn was brilliant!&quot;

Flynn and Davis, born respectively in 1909 and 1908, were almost the same age (30 and 31 in 1939), in contrast to the age gap of more than 30 years between Elizabeth and Essex in real life. Davis was also less than half the age the real Elizabeth had been at the time of the events depicted, which was 63.

A final scene of Essex on the execution block was cut after previews.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film made a profit of $550,000.

According to Warner Bros figures the film earned $955,000 domestically and $658,000 foreign.

===Critical===
The public liked Flynn&#x27;s charming rogue of a character, his undisguised Tasmanian accent notwithstanding, but the critics found him to be the weak link in the production, with &quot;The New York Times&quot; writing, &quot;Bette Davis&#x27;s Elizabeth is a strong, resolute, glamour-skimping characterisation against which Mr. Flynn&#x27;s Essex has about as much chance as a beanshooter against a tank.&quot;

Footage from the movie was re-used in &quot;The Adventures of Don Juan&quot; (1948).

In the years between Flynn&#x27;s death and the release of the film on videocassette and its first showings on cable television, the title was changed to &quot;Elizabeth the Queen.&quot; The current title was restored some years later.

==Awards==
The film was nominated for five Academy Awards:
* Best Art Direction (Anton Grot)
* Best Cinematography (Color) (Sol Polito, W. Howard Greene)
* Music (Scoring) (Erich Wolfgang Korngold)
* Sound Recording (Nathan Levinson)
* Special Effects (Byron Haskin, Nathan Levinson)

The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:
* 2002: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Passions – Nominated
* 2005: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years of Film Scores – Nominated

<text>U.S. Route 4 (US 4) is a United States Numbered Highway that runs from East Greenbush, New York, in the west to Portsmouth, New Hampshire, in the east, traversing Vermont.

In New York, US 4 is signed north–south to reflect its alignment in the state. In Vermont and New Hampshire, the route is signed east–west, the conventional direction for even-numbered U.S. Routes.

===New York===

In the state of New York, US 4 begins at the concurrency of US 9 and US 20 in East Greenbush. Heading northward, it has an interchange with Interstate 90 (I-90), continuing northward into Troy. In Troy, it passes by Hudson Valley Community College as well as the headquarters of the 42nd Infantry Division. US 4 then heads downhill, passing the historic South End Tavern as Burden Avenue, named for the historic Burden Iron Works. Later, US 4 assumes Fourth Street, which splits into parallel one-way streets (Third Street handles southbound traffic). Once through Troy&#x27;s historic downtown, the streets meet and pass by the Green Island Bridge, later passing under the Collar City Bridge and into Lansingburgh.

After Lansingburgh, US 4 turns left to cross the Hudson River on the Troy–Waterford Bridge, entering Waterford, joining with New York State Route 32 (NY 32) to head north together west of the Hudson. After Mechanicville, US 4 and NY 32 split, and US 4 passes by the Battles of Saratoga and Gerald B. H. Solomon Saratoga National Cemetery. NY 32 joins again to pass through Schuylerville, after which US 4 splits off to cross the Hudson River one last time.

Running parallel to the Champlain Canal, US 4 passes through villages including Fort Edward, Hudson Falls, Fort Ann, and Whitehall. After a concurrency with NY 22, US 4 heads eastward into Vermont.

===Vermont===

In the state of Vermont, US 4 immediately becomes a four-lane divided expressway. The historic routing of US 4 runs nearby as Vermont Route 4A (VT 4A), which later becomes US 4 Business as it enters Rutland. South of Rutland, US 4 meets US 7 and overlaps it into downtown, meeting the east end of its business route. East of Rutland, US 4 is a two-lane highway, meandering through the Green Mountains, passing by Killington, going through Woodstock and Quechee, crossing the Quechee Gorge, and meeting US 5, I-89, and I-91 at White River Junction. Crossing the Connecticut River, US 4 enters New Hampshire.

===New Hampshire===

In the state of New Hampshire, US 4 passes through Lebanon, meeting I-89 again. It then heads southeast to Boscawen, where it briefly overlaps US 3 before joining I-93 into Concord. Turning east, US 4 briefly overlaps I-393 and for a longer stretch with US 202. Passing through Durham, US 4 joins the Spaulding Turnpike at Dover Point and travels southeast to its eastern terminus in Portsmouth at the Portsmouth Traffic Circle.

==History==
 Prior to being designated US 4, the road from Whitehall, New York, eastward through Vermont was New England Route 13 (Route 13). From the Vermont–New Hampshire state line to Franklin, New Hampshire, it was the eastern extension of Route 14. From Franklin to Concord, New Hampshire, it used Route 6 (now US 3), and, from Concord to Northwood, New Hampshire, it used Route 9 (now New Hampshire Route 9 [NH 9]). Between Northwood and Dover, New Hampshire, it used a road that was previously not numbered. From Dover to its eastern terminus at Portsmouth, New Hampshire, the road used to be known as Route 16 (now NH 16).

===History of the terminuses===
1926–1930: Glens Falls, New York, at the point where US 9 split into US 9W and US 9E, to Portsmouth, New Hampshire.&lt;br&gt;1930–: East Greenbush, New York, following former US 9E, through its former west terminus, to Portsmouth, New Hampshire.

<text>Count Hans Henric von Essen (26 September 1755 – 28 June 1824) was a Swedish officer, courtier and statesman.

==Biography==
Hans Henric von Essen was born at Kavlås Castle in Tidaholm Municipality, Västra Götaland County, Sweden. He was a member of the Essen family. He was educated at Uppsala University. He entered the army, becoming a cornet at age 18. He accompanied Gustav III in his travels and campaigns. He accompanied Gustav III at the 1792 masquerade ball at the Royal Opera House in Stockholm on 16 March 1792, where the king was shot and mortally injured. Hans Henrik von Essen was credited with immediately ordering the doors to the ballroom to be locked, in order not to let the assassin getaway.

In 1788, Hans Henric von Essen was the center of a scandal at the royal court. He had for about ten years been involved in a relationship with the famous lady-in-waiting Augusta von Fersen. In 1788, however, he proposed to Charlotta Eleonora De Geer (1771-1791) and was accepted. His proposal was met with great dislike within the royal court because of sympathy with the popular Augusta von Fersen, and he was challenged to a duel by captain count Adolph Ribbing. Ribbing had also proposed to De Geer but had been declined by her father, which he refused to accept as he believed he had reasons to think that De Geer preferred him and that Essen had proposed because of economic reasons, as De Geer was very wealthy, and as von Essen&#x27;s proposal and marriage plans were commonly disliked within the court. The duel took place in the royal riding house in the presence of several officers and led to the defeat of von Essen, who was slightly injured. The duel was regarded as a scandal and a crime against the King.

Hans Henrik von Essen was appointed Colonel in 1787, Major General in 1795, and Field Marshal in 1811. He served as the Governor of Stockholm from 1795 to 1797 and as the Governor-General of Pomerania from 1800 to 1809. Upon the revolution of 1809, he received the title of count and a place in the Council of State. In 1810 he was sent as Ambassador to Paris by Charles XIII, and his negotiations with Napoleon&#x27;s ministers restored Pomerania to Sweden.

In 1814, Hans Henrik von Essen served as the commander of the Swedish military forces at the border with Norway. By the Treaty of Kiel, the King of Denmark had to cede Norway to the King of Sweden, due to the alliance of Denmark-Norway with France during the later phases of the Napoleonic Wars. This treaty was however not accepted by the Norwegians. The Norwegian-Swedish War of 1814 was fought in the summer of 1814. Subsequently, the Convention of Moss was signed resulting in the Union between Sweden and Norway. Hans Henrik von Essen served as the Governor-general of Norway until he was succeeded by Count Carl Carlsson Mörner during 1816.

<doc id="779790" wikidata="Q5351810" url="?curid=779790" title="Highway Patrolman (film)">
<text>Highway Patrolman (Spanish: El patrullero) is a 1991 Mexican crime drama film by the British director Alex Cox. It was produced by Lorenzo O&#x27;Brien, who also wrote the screenplay, and stars Roberto Sosa, Bruno Bichir, Zaide Silvia Gutiérrez and Vanessa Bauche. The cinematography is by Miguel Garzon and the production designer was Cecilia Montiel, who went on to work on &quot;The Mask of Zorro&quot; as well as on Cox&#x27;s Alan Smithee film &quot;The Winner&quot;. Cox considers &quot;El Patrullero&quot; to be his best work while a number of prominent film critics have expressed the same opinion as well.

==Plot==

The film tells the story of a young man, Pedro Rojas (Roberto Sosa) starting his career as a Highway Patrolman in the rural north. He refuses to take part in the corruption in the police force, unlike his friend Anibal Guerrero (Bruno Bichir) who quickly starts taking bribes and peddling contraband.

Gradually, Pedro&#x27;s high principles are eroded by the hardships of his life. Eventually he takes his first bribe. He is shot in the leg, nagged by his father&#x27;s ghost and beats up the governor&#x27;s son. His wife Griselda (Zaide Silvia Gutiérrez), tolerates his relationship with a prostitute, Maribel (Vanessa Bauche), provided it doesn&#x27;t reflect badly on herself and the money keeps coming in. When Anibal is murdered by drug dealers, Pedro&#x27;s moral sense re-emerges and he takes revenge. The film ends with Pedro resigning from the Highway Patrol, trying to maintain two families.

==Reception==

Though the film premiered in Mexico in 1991, U.S. distribution was considerably limited. Kevin Thomas of &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote over two years later that it was &quot;a sad commentary on the state of foreign-language film distribution that &quot;Highway Patrolman&quot;...is only now being released [in Los Angeles].&quot; Nevertheless, he adds that &quot;we can be only be grateful that it has arrived at last&quot; as he considered the film to be &quot;maverick director Alex Cox’s finest film to date.&quot; Thomas observed that &quot;working in a foreign language has given Cox the necessary freedom and detachment not to worry about being hip and to take the plunge into classic screen storytelling, backed by O’Brien’s superbly structured script.&quot;

Jonathan Rosenbaum of &quot;The Chicago Reader&quot; concurred that &quot;in some ways it’s [Cox&#x27;s] best work to date – a beautifully realized tale about the life of a Mexican highway patrolman who’s neither sentimentalized nor treated like a villain.&quot; He later included it in his year-end top-ten list, observing that &quot;working in a virtuoso long-take style, Cox mixes comedy with tragedy and social critique with straight-ahead action.&quot; Jim Hoberman would also hail it as &quot;Cox’s most impressive comeback&quot; many years later in a retrospective review published in &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

==Influence and legacy==

The musician James Rutledge released his early music under the name Pedro in reference to the film. Damián Alcázar, who had a small role in the film would go on to star in the Luis Estrada films Herods Law (1999) and A Wonderful World (2006), which have Cox in supporting roles.

<doc id="779791" wikidata="Q5926544" url="?curid=779791" title="Leeann Tweeden">
<text>Leeann Tweeden is an American radio broadcaster, model and sports commentator. She is co-host of &quot;Dr. Drew Midday Live&quot; on Radio 790 KABC in Los Angeles.

== Early life ==
Tweeden was born in Manassas, Virginia, to Bill Tweeden, a retired Air Force Chief Mechanic, and his wife Catherine. She is of Filipino descent on her mother&#x27;s side. After graduating from Osbourn Park High School in 1991, Tweeden moved to Hollywood to pursue a career in modeling.

== Career ==
In 1992, while working as a hostess at a Hooters restaurant in Colorado Springs, Colorado, she won first place in the Venus International Model Search. This break led to national exposure, including a regular role as a fitness model on the TV show &quot;Fitness Beach&quot;. Tweeden modeled for promotional work for Hooters (which included an appearance in the restaurant&#x27;s 1994 calendar), Venus International, and Frederick&#x27;s of Hollywood. In the early 2000s, Tweeden hosted many segments of the Fox Sports Net show, &quot;Bluetorch TV&quot;. Tweeden was a correspondent for Fox Sports Networks&#x27; &quot;The Best Damn Sports Show Period&quot; from 2001 to 2007. In 2008, Tweeden became the third hostess of the NBC late night television series &quot;Poker After Dark&quot;. She has also appeared on the political discussion series &quot;Hannity&quot; in 2011 and 2012. She was a member of the &quot;Great American Panel&quot; and also occasionally appeared on the panel of &quot;Red Eye w/ Greg Gutfeld&quot;. Tweeden was seen in pre- and post-game coverage of the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim on Fox Sports West and on Fox Sports 1&#x27;s &quot;UFC Tonight&quot;, with Kenny Florian and Ariel Helwani.

On February 7, 2017, Tweeden joined the cast of the Los Angeles morning radio show &quot;McIntyre in the Morning&quot; on KABC, 790 AM as the news anchor.

On January 7, 2019, Tweeden became the co-host of &quot;Dr. Drew Midday&quot; on KABC, 790 AM.

=== Appearances ===
In August 1996, Tweeden appeared on the cover of &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine and as part of a fitness model pictorial for that issue. She did not appear nude. In December 2011, at 38 years old, she again appeared on the cover of &quot;Playboy&quot;, and in that issue was featured in a nude pictorial.

In 2002, she was a guest character in the motocross video game &quot;Freekstyle&quot; as a motocross rider. The March 2007 issue of &quot;FHM&quot; (the final U.S. issue ever printed) featured Tweeden as the cover girl. As part of Hooters&#x27; 25th anniversary in 2008, she was named among &quot;The Top Hooters Girls of all time&quot;.

Since 2002, Tweeden has participated in 16 tours with the USO including 12 to Afghanistan and Iraq.

==Allegations against Al Franken==
On October 30, 2017, California Congresswoman Jackie Speier was interviewed by the McIntyre show about a sexual assault that occurred when she was in her 20s and was a congressional staffer for Representative Leo Ryan. She alleged that Ryan&#x27;s chief of staff &quot;kissed me and stuck his tongue in my mouth&quot;. According to the show&#x27;s host Doug McIntyre, that led to a conversation with Tweeden about an alleged incident of sexual harassment between her and Minnesota U.S. Senator Al Franken. With McIntyre&#x27;s assistance, Tweeden prepared to make a public statement about her allegations.

Ahead of Tweeden&#x27;s public statements, a Fox news executive tipped off conservative political consultant Roger Stone. Stone circulated news of the allegations to right-wing media and made Twitter posts referring to the allegations, including a statement that &quot;It’s Al Franken&#x27;s &#x27;time in the barrel.. Following the posting of Tweeden&#x27;s story, far-right radio show host and prominent conspiracy theorist Alex Jones broadcast that Stone had told him, in advance, &quot;Get ready. Franken’s next&quot;. 

On November 16, 2017, Tweeden went public with the allegations in a blog post and radio interview. According to Tweeden, Franken kissed her on a 2006 USO tour during a rehearsal for a comedy skit in which they kissed. She wrote that he &quot;came at me, put his hand on the back of my head, mashed his lips against mine and aggressively stuck his tongue in my mouth.&quot; She said she pushed him away, feeling &quot;disgusted and violated&quot;. Tweeden&#x27;s post alleged that Franken &quot;wrote that sketch just to kiss me&quot;. Tweeden wrote that Franken also posed for a photograph with her while she was asleep on the C-17 cargo plane flying home. According to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, the photograph &quot;shows Franken looking into a camera, his hands either over or on Tweeden’s chest as she slept&quot;. 

Franken disputed Tweeden&#x27;s version. In a long-form article covering the allegations for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, Jane Mayer wrote that, according to Franken, Tweeden&#x27;s &quot;accusations appropriated jokes from comic routines that they’d performed together&quot;. Franken denied writing the skit solely to kiss Tweeden; he had performed similar skits involving kissing in 2004 and 2005. These were intended as references to the &quot;frankly lascivious&quot; Bob Hope/Raquel Welch USO skits of the Vietnam era. The photograph may have been taken as a parody of a skit that had been used in the USO show&#x27;s comedy routine. In the skit, Franken appears as a doctor who informs Tweeden&#x27;s character that &quot;a woman your age should have a complete breast examination every year&quot;; Franken then approaches her with his arms outstretched and his hands aimed at her chest.

CNBC&#x27;s John Harwood defended Franken by pointing out that Tweeden had been filmed on a 2004 USO tour &quot;humping&quot; comedian Robin Williams: &quot;[T]hat pic was obviously a joke, not groping, just like Leeann Tweeden wrapping her leg around Robin Williams and smacking his butt; entertainment for soldiers deployed overseas is raunchy like that.&quot; 

Franken responded, saying: &quot;I certainly don&#x27;t remember the rehearsal for the skit in the same way, but I send my sincerest apologies to Leeann. [...] As to the photo, it was clearly intended to be funny but wasn&#x27;t. I shouldn&#x27;t have done it.&quot; He issued a longer apology later, which Tweeden accepted. Other accusations of sexual misconduct—including grabbing a woman&#x27;s bottom while posing for a photo—followed Tweeden&#x27;s. Franken resigned from the Senate on January 2, 2018.

==Personal life==
Tweeden met her husband, Chris Dougherty, a pilot for the California Air National Guard, during a USO tour. They married in 2010. They have two children, son Kane and daughter Kaia.

She considers herself fiscally conservative and said that she voted twice for President George W. Bush.

Tweeden made an appearance on the season 10 finale of &quot;That Metal Show&quot;.

<doc id="779795" wikidata="Q203990" url="?curid=779795" title="Marie Taglioni">
<text>Marie Taglioni, Comtesse de Voisins (23 April 1804 – 22 April 1884) was a Swedish-born ballet dancer of the Romantic ballet era partially of Italian descent, a central figure in the history of European dance. She spent most of her life in the Austrian Empire and France. She was one of the most celebrated ballerinas of the romantic ballet, which was cultivated primarily at Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre in London and at the Théâtre de l&#x27;Académie Royale de Musique of the Paris Opera Ballet. She is credited with (though not confirmed as) being the first ballerina to truly dance &quot;en pointe&quot;.

==Early life==
Taglioni was born in Stockholm, Sweden, to the Italian choreographer Filippo Taglioni and the Swedish ballet dancer Sophie Karsten, maternal granddaughter of the Swedish opera singer Christoffer Christian Karsten and of the Polish opera singer and actress Sophie Stebnowska. Her brother, Paul (1808–1884), was also a dancer and an influential choreographer; they performed together early in their careers.

==Marriage==
Taglioni was married to &quot;Comte&quot; Auguste Gilbert de Voisins in 1835, but separated in 1836. She later fell in love with Eugene Desmares, a loyal fan, who had defended her honour in a duel. Desmares and Taglioni gave birth to an (illegitimate) child in 1836. Three years later Desmares died in a hunting accident. In 1842 she gave birth to her second child. It is unknown who the father is even though the birth certificate states the father as Gilbert de Voisins. Taglioni&#x27;s children&#x27;s names were Count Georges Philippe Marie Gilbert de Voisins and Eugenie-Marie (Edwige) Gilbert de Voisins. Later Georges Gilbert de Voisins married Sozonga Ralli, heiress of wealthy Greek-born Ralli family, while Eugenie married Russian Prince Alexander Trubetskoy, with whom he had five children and settled between their villa on the shores of Lake Como and their residence in Paris. A granddaughter of Marie Taglioni, Princess Sophia Trubetskoy married a scion of Greek-born prominent Recanati banking family. 

==Training==
Taglioni moved to Vienna with her family at a very young age where she began her ballet training under the direction of Jean-Francois Coulon and her father. After Filippo was appointed the ballet master at the court opera in Vienna there was a decision that Marie would debut in the Habsburg capital. Even though Marie had trained with Coulon, her technique was not up to the standards that would impress the Viennese audiences. Her father then created a rigorous six-month training regimen for his daughter where she would hold positions for 100 counts. The training was conducted daily and consisted of two hours in the morning with difficult exercises focusing on her legs and two hours in the afternoon focusing on adagio movements that would help her refine poses in ballet. Taglioni had a rounded back that caused her to lean forward and had &quot;slightly distorted proportions&quot;. She worked hard to disguise her physical limitations by increasing range of motion and developing her strength. Taglioni focused her energy on her shape and form to the audience and less on bravura tricks and pirouettes. In Vienna, Marie danced her first ballet choreographed by her father titled &quot;La Reception d&#x27;une Jeune Nymphe à la Cour de Terpsichore&quot;.

==Career==
Before joining the Paris Opéra, Taglioni danced in both Munich and Stuttgart, and at age 23 debuted in another ballet choreographed by her father called &quot;La Sicilien&quot; that jump-started her ballet career. Taglioni rose to fame as a &quot;danseuse&quot; at the Paris Opéra when her father created the ballet &quot;La Sylphide&quot; (1832) for her. Designed as a showcase for Taglioni&#x27;s talent, it was the first ballet where dancing &quot;en pointe&quot; had an aesthetic rationale and was not merely an acrobatic stunt, often involving ungraceful arm movements and exertions, as had been the approach of dancers in the late 1820s.

==&quot;Pas de Quatre&quot;==

In 1837 Taglioni left the Ballet of Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre to take up a three-year contract in Saint Petersburg with the Imperial Ballet (known today as the Kirov/Mariinsky Ballet). It was in Russia after her last performance in the country (1842) and at the height of the &quot;cult of the ballerina&quot;, that a pair of her pointe shoes were sold for two hundred rubles, reportedly to be cooked, served with a sauce and eaten by a group of s.

In July 1845, she danced with Lucile Grahn, Carlotta Grisi, and Fanny Cerrito in Jules Perrot&#x27;s &quot;Pas de Quatre&quot;, a ballet representing Taglioni&#x27;s ethereal qualities that was based on Alfred Edward Chalon’s lithographic prints. &quot;Pas de Quatre&quot; was originally choreographed to be presented to Queen Victoria, who attended the third performance.

==Retirement, last years and death==

Taglioni retired from performing in 1847; for a time she took up residence at the Ca&#x27; d&#x27;Oro on the Grand Canal in Venice. When the ballet of the Paris Opéra was reorganized on stricter, more professional lines, she was its guiding spirit. With the director of the new &quot;Conservatoire de danse&quot;, Lucien Petipa, and Petipa&#x27;s former pupil, the choreographer Louis Mérante, she figured on the six-member select jury of the first annual competition for the corps de ballet, held on 13 April 1860.

Her only choreographic work was &quot;Le papillon&quot; (1860) for her student Emma Livry, who is remembered for dying in 1863 when her costume was set alight by a gas lamp used for stage lighting. Johann Strauss II composed the &quot;Marie Taglioni Polka&quot; (Op. 173) in honour of Marie Taglioni&#x27;s niece, Marie &quot;Paul&quot; Taglioni, also known as &quot;Marie the Younger&quot;. The two women, having the same name, have often been conflated, or confused with each other.

Later in England, she taught social dance and ballroom to children and society ladies in London; she also took a limited number of ballet pupils. She resided at #14 Connaught Square, London from 1875 to 1876.

==Death==
Taglioni died poor in Marseille on 22 April 1884, the day before her 80th birthday. Her body was moved to Paris. There is some debate over whether she is buried in Montmartre or in Père Lachaise, or if the grave Montmartre site belongs to her mother. The local dancers began leaving their worn pointe shoes on the Montmartre grave as a tribute and thanks to the first pointe dancer.
