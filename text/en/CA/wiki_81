<text>The Cursor Mundi (or ‘Over-runner of the World’) is an early 14th-century religious poem written in Northumbrian Middle English that presents an extensive retelling of the history of Christianity from the creation to the doomsday. The poem is long, composed of almost 30,000 lines, but shows considerable artistic skill. In spite of the immense mass of material with which it deals, it is well proportioned, and the narrative is lucid and easy.

The &quot;Cursor Mundi&quot; is more or less completely unknown outside of medievalist and lexicographical circles. Yet, the poem is one of the texts that provides the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) with over 1,000 new words, i.e. words that were unknown before they appeared for the first time in the &quot;Cursor Mundi&quot;. The poem has also provided over 11,000 quotations for the published Dictionary, making it the second most heavily quoted work in OED1/2 after the Bible and the fifth most quoted source altogether.

The first modern edition of the &quot;Cursor Mundi&quot; was published in six volumes by the Reverend Richard Morris between 1874 and 1892 in the Early English Text Society series.

== About the Cursor Mundi ==
The &quot;Cursor Mundi&quot; (or ‘&quot;Over-runner of the World&quot;’) is an early 14th-century religious poem written in Northumbrian Middle English that presents an extensive retelling of Christian history from the Creation to Doomsday. A number of manuscripts of the poem are extant, but none of them is the original composition attributed to an unknown author from the north of England. According to the philologist James Murray, the poem originated near Durham, about 1275–1300.

The author of the Cursor Mundi brings all his events under seven periods or “Seven ages of the world”:
# Creation to the time of Noah;
# Flood to the confusion of tongues;
# Time of Abraham to the death of Saul;
# Reign of David to the Captivity of Judah;
# Parentage of the Virgin Mary to the time of John the Baptist;
# Baptism of Jesus to the Finding of the Cross. This is called &quot;the time of Grace.&quot;
# Day of Doom and the state of the world after Doomsday.

Special prominence is given throughout the work to the history of the Cross. This may be because St. Helena, the mother of Constantine, was reputed to have been of British birth and was exceptionally popular in England.

The &quot;Cursor Mundi&quot; occupies a unique place, because of its length, its scope, and its author&#x27;s broad and eclectic knowledge of the traditions of exegesis in his time.

== Origins and structure ==

=== Title ===
As explained by the author, because the book overruns almost all the course of the world&#x27;s history, it was to be called ‘cursur o werld’ i.e. over-runner of the world, hence &quot;Cursor Mundi&quot;.

=== Authorship ===
The Cursor Mundi is not signed, and no author&#x27;s name is given anywhere in the text. However, the author does reveal that he is a “pastor” and, according to the Rev. Morris (1892), was evidently a cleric “as modest as he was learned”. Heinrich Hupe&#x27;s theory, that his name was John of Lindebergh, which place he identifies with Limber Magna in Lincolnshire, is based on a misreading of an insertion in one of the manuscripts by the scribe who copied it.

=== Source material ===
The &quot;Cursor Mundi&quot; was founded on the works of late 12th-century Latin writers who wrote various pseudo-histories made up of hagiographic, legendary, and biblical material. It borrows heavily from pre-existing Latin and French biblical versions with additional material drawn primarily from the &quot;Historia Scholastica.&quot;

It was translated and compiled gradually and incrementally from such sources, perhaps over a single writer&#x27;s lifetime. Over the course of the 200-year period during which it was successively recopied, the text was adjusted to suit the changing circumstances in which it was being disseminated and read, losing many of the original features that mark the earliest extant texts as a work intended for oral-didactic performance.

In consideration of one particular segment of the poem (lines 12713–17082), it is virtually impossible to complete an exhaustive survey of the poet&#x27;s source materials. However, several works may be cited with certainty regarding their influence upon it.
* Vulgate Bible 
* Herman de Valenciennes Bible
* The Old French Cross story
* Vita Prothoplausti Ade (also known as Legende)
* Historia Scholastica Evangelica
* Le Chateau d’Amour (by Robert Grosseteste)
* Legenda Aurea

=== Structure ===
The Cursor Mundi poem consists of almost 30,000 lines. The short verse form is generally that of the eight-syllabled couplet, but when writing of the passion and death of Christ, the poet uses alternately rhyming lines of eight and six syllables. The discourse between Christ and man, which follows the account of the crucifixion, consists largely of six-lined mono-rhymed stanzas.

== Extant manuscripts ==

A total of nine complete or fragmentary manuscripts of the poem are extant although none of them is the original composition attributed to the unknown poet:
# (C) – Cotton MS. Vespasian A.iii in the British Library.
# (F) – Fairfax MS. 14, Bodleian Library. West Midland version written in the late 14th century in Lancashire. Although the Fairfax manuscript contains about 6,000 lines less than the Cotton manuscript, it has also some unique additions.
# (G) – Göttingen MS. Theol. 107, Göttingen University Library.
# (T) – Trinity MS. R.3.8, Trinity College Library, Cambridge.
# (E) – Edinburgh, Library of the Royal College of Physicians.
# (H) – Heralds’ College of Arms, MS Arundel 57, British Library, London. Late 14th century consisting of &quot;Cursor Mundi&quot; and Richard of Hampole&#x27;s Prick of Conscience.
# (L) – MS. Laud Misc. 416, Bodleian Library, Oxford.
# (B) – Bedford MS or alternatively Additional 36983, British Library, London. 15th century (1442) manuscript containing a number of devotional texts in addition to the &quot;Cursor Mundi&quot; (e.g. the Prick of Conscience, the Abbey of the Holy Ghost and the Three Kings of Cologne).
# Additional 31042, British Library, London. Mid 15th Century manuscript copied by Robert Thornton.

== Modern editions ==

=== Northern ===

The first modern edition of the Cursor Mundi was published in six volumes by the Reverend Richard Morris between 1874 and 1892 under the auspices of the Early English Text Society series. Morris and his associates transcribed five manuscripts, four of which represent Northern or North Midland dialects, hence becoming known as the &#x27;Northern&#x27; edition. Different segments of the poem were presented in volumes 1 to 5, with additional materials in volume 6.
#1874: Part 1, lines 1-4954
#1875: Part II, lines 4955-12558
#1876: Part III, lines 12559-19300
#1877: Part IV, lines 19301-23826
#1878: Part V, lines 23827-29527 (end).
#1892: Part VI, Preface, Notes, Glossary, Index of names etc.

According to Morris, publishing the four manuscripts (C, F, G and T) together meant “quadrupling the value of the text, not only as a subject for linguistic study, but also as an instance of how scribes dealt with their early originals”. Also, because the manuscripts are presented side by side (i.e. four columns across two pages, allowing a line-by-line comparison), “the four texts give an opportunity for comparison of form and word such as no other existing English book affords, except perhaps some editions of parts of the Bible”.

In addition to the four main manuscripts, the Northern edition cites most, but not all, of the other manuscripts listed above. It also cites &quot;Cotton Galba E 9&quot;, but this is not included in the manuscripts listed the Southern edition.

=== Southern ===
The Northern edition of the &quot;Cursor Mundi&quot; was the only one available until publication of the &quot;Southern Version of the Cursor Mundi&quot; almost a century later. The Southern edition has been described as &quot;an attempt to tailor an older text to a changing market&quot;.

The Southern edition was published in five volumes between 1978 and 2000.
#1978: Volume 1, lines 1-9228
#1990: Volume II, lines 9229-12712
#1985: Volume III, lines 12713-17082
#1986: Volume IV, lines 17289-21346
#2000: Volume V, lines 21845-23898

According to Horrall, a new edition of the &quot;Cursor Mundi&quot; was needed because the transcriptions in Morris&#x27; Northern version &quot;were accompanied by a sketchy, inaccurate critical apparatus which is now out of date&quot;. In particular, Morris and his collaborators had considered the southern manuscripts (H, T, L, B) to be &quot;hopelessly corrupt&quot; copies of the original (C) poem. Horrall disagreed with Morris&#x27; assumptions and argued that someone in the south central Midlands came across a copy of the Cursor Mundi similar to the extant G manuscript. This copy was systematically revised and &quot;as a result, southern England acquired not a corrupt copy of a northern poem, but a new poem, substantially changed in language and scope from its original&quot;.

== Key source of words and quotations ==
The &quot;Cursor Mundi&quot; is one of the Late Medieval texts that provides the OED with over 1,000 new words, i.e. words that were unknown before they appeared for the first time in the poem. Examples of the words include: anyway, anywhere, backward, blister, brimstone, chastise, chess, virginity, weakness, wickedness, willing, written, yonder, and zealot. It has also provided over 11,000 quotations for the published Dictionary, making it the second most heavily quoted work in OED1/2 after the Bible and the fifth most quoted source altogether. According to recent (2021) OED data, the figures are 1,433 words and 11,901 quotations respectively. However, the &quot;Cursi Mundi&quot; is less frequently quoted in the more recent &#x27;OED3&#x27; because the latter relies on the Middle English Dictionary, which favours Chaucer as a quotation source.

<text>The Initial D (D) video game series, known in Japan as Initial D Arcade Stage, is an arcade racing game series developed by Sega, based on the anime and manga series &quot;Initial D&quot;. In the United States and Europe, the game series is simply known as &quot;Initial D&quot;.

== Premise ==
In the &quot;Initial D&quot; video game franchise, players race against different opponents through various mountain passes featured in the manga. Vehicles that are featured in the game are mostly Japanese cars, such as the Nissan Skyline GT-R, Mazda RX-7, Subaru Impreza, Honda Civic, as well as the Toyota AE86. Using the optional magnetic card system (arcade instalments from &quot;Arcade Stage Zero&quot; and later utilize Amusement IC, Banapassport or Aime cards rather than dedicated magnetic cards), players can save a customized car as well as their progress for future sessions; otherwise, their game progress is deleted. Players can continue growth with their cards on another &quot;Initial D&quot; cabinet of the same version. However, the card must be renewed every 50 plays.

Resuming from another version is subject to the following conditions:
* There is no backward compatibility (i.e., a version 2 card cannot be used on version 1 machine).
* Upgrading the card to a more recent machine is permanent.
* When upgrading from one version to another, remaining plays will be carried over, and 50 plays will be credited to the card.

This feature was not present from Arcade Stage Zero to The Arcade however. Players with a save data on Arcade Stage Zero were rewarded with continued play benefits which included full tune tickets based on the number of cars owned that were fully tuned, up to 56 cars, titles based on the player&#x27;s level, and avatar pieces, dressup tokens and avatar tokens based on the player&#x27;s mileage.

Players with a save data from Sega World Driver Championship were rewarded with a full tune ticket and avatar pieces based on the driver level.

There are 13 games in the series; 10 for arcades and 3 for home consoles.
* &quot;Initial D Arcade Stage Ver.1&quot; (Arcade)
* &quot;Initial D Arcade Stage Ver.2&quot; (Arcade)
* &quot;Initial D Arcade Stage Ver.3&quot; (Arcade)
* &quot;Initial D Arcade Stage 4&quot; (Arcade)
* &quot;Initial D Arcade Stage 5&quot; (Arcade)
* &quot;Initial D Arcade Stage 6 AA&quot; (Arcade)
* &quot;Initial D Arcade Stage 7 AAX&quot; (Arcade)
* &quot;Initial D Arcade Stage 8 Infinity&quot; (Arcade)
* &quot;Initial D Arcade Stage Zero&quot; (Arcade)
* &quot;Initial D The Arcade&quot; (Arcade)
* &quot;Initial D Special Stage&quot; (PlayStation 2)
* &quot;Initial D Street Stage&quot; (PSP)
* &quot;Initial D Extreme Stage&quot; (PS3)

==Game modes==
; Legend of the Streets
: In the main story mode, players race with opponents from the manga with their opponents increasing in difficulty during the progression of the game. In the English versions of the game, until the release of &quot;Arcade Stage 4&quot;, their names are derived from the Tokyopop manga.

; Time attack
: Players race in a timed game to rank highest against other players at their current machine or online. From &quot;Arcade Stage Ver.2&quot;/&quot;Special Stage&quot; to &quot;Arcade Stage 6 AA&quot;, players could change stages&#x27; weather conditions. This feature was removed from &quot;Arcade Stage 7 AAX&quot; to &quot;Arcade Stage 8 Infinity&quot;.

; Bunta Challenge
: First started in &quot;Arcade Stage Ver.2&quot; to &quot;Arcade Stage Ver.3&quot;/&quot;Street Stage&quot; the player races against Bunta Fujiwara, the legendary street racer in the Initial D series. Each time Bunta is defeated, the player will gain a level, and difficulty increases. In &quot;Arcade Stage Ver.3&quot;, the player loses 1000 points upon defeat. Regardless, the end credits still roll if you win or lose to Bunta. Bunta&#x27;s car differs across levels, levels 1-6: AE86 Trueno, levels 7-11: AE86 Trueno w/TRD 20-Valve 4AGE Racing Engine levels 12-15: GC8V Subaru Impreza WRX STi Version V. This model was discontinued and removed in &quot;Arcade Stage 4&quot;/&quot;Extreme Stage&quot;. However, Bunta appeared as a final boss in Akina. It later returned in &quot;Arcade Stage 7 AAX&quot; (Only in Legend mode after clearing Rebirth mode). And soon returned in Initial D The Arcade in an update during the 20th anniversary which can be unlocked at Street Racer Grade C9.

; Online Battle
: This was introduced in &quot;Arcade Stage 4&quot;/&quot;Extreme Stage&quot;, this mode allowed players to race against others located in the same continent.

; Racer&#x27;s Event
:Introduced in &quot;Arcade Stage 5&quot; to &quot;Arcade Stage 8 Infinity&quot;. Only two modes are included in-game, such as online battle and time attack.

;Tag Battle
: Introduced in &quot;Arcade Stage 6 AA&quot; through to &quot;Arcade Stage 8 Infinity&quot;, this mode allows players in the same location to team up. One player drives uphill and the other downhill to race with rivals. Matches are made based on past racing results, pitting drivers with similar levels against each other. When there is a difference in the level with your tag partner, the stronger driver will match with a stronger driver and a weaker driver with a weaker driver. The team with the highest score wins.

;Project Kanto&#x27;s Fastest/Operation Kanto
: First introduced in &quot;Arcade Stage 7 AAX&quot;, this mode is similar to tag battle mode, where players race against the rival characters based in the manga from Gunma to Kanagawa area. In races against Project D&#x27;s Ace, courses are random. In &quot;Arcade Stage 8 Infinity&quot;, new rivals include Tohru and Atsuro in Momiji Line, Sakamoto and Wataru in Sadamine Rain, and The Lan Evo Teams in Tsuchisaka.

;Theory of Streets
: Introduced in a content update for The Arcade, this mode allows the players to verse up to 2-3 other bots based on real players around the world on Sega&#x27;s official servers. Players can choose their mentor to build their friendship with and earn rewards by beating the bots, and choose their opponents ranging from different street racer grades.

===Stage 5===
Released on 25 February 2009 in Japan, &quot;Initial D Arcade Stage 5&quot; was the second game in the series released on the Sega Lindbergh hardware. A few notable differences include massive physics changes. Compared to &quot;Arcade Stage 4&quot;/&quot;Extreme Stage&quot;, which used &quot;drifting&quot; physics, &quot;Arcade Stage 5&quot; featured more realistic driving physics, which included tire and brake wear down. Although the tire and brake wear are not displayed anywhere in the game, experienced players can notice the difference in the change in physics as they progress in races.

New characters that appeared for the first time in the game are Kobayakawa, Satoshi Omiya, Imposter Project D, Kai Kogashiwa (R.T. Katagiri S.V.), and Hideo Minagawa.
New courses such as Happogahara, which used from &quot;Arcade Stage Ver.1&quot; to &quot;Arcade Stage Ver.3&quot;/&quot;Street Stage&quot; (only daytime used is night) and only &quot;Extreme Stage&quot; appeared with full daytimes between day and night and Nagao, R.T.

A new mode, Tag Battle, was introduced. Unlike its predecessor, it was released for the Sega RingEdge hardware for the first time. The game saw a change in its driving physics. Unlike &quot;Initial D Arcade Stage 5&quot;, a drift gauge and an updated tachometer were introduced to help inform players when they were drifting. The &#x27;Legend of the Street&#x27; mode also introduced a &quot;Rolling Start&quot; since the story mode in &quot;Initial D Special Stage&quot;. The tachometer now informed players whether or not their speed was below the gear range. Online network was extended to support regions in which earlier versions of the game was known to be popular in, finally achieving both nationwide and international matches. New cars and courses were added to the game through online updates without upgrade kits like IDAS4 1.5. The game also added a mileage system to show players their total driven mileage. Mileages could be used to redeem exclusive cars that were later available in updates. New characters that appeared for the first time in the game include Ryuji Ikeda, Hiroya Okuyama, Go Hojo, and Rin Hojo. New course such as Usui, which used from &quot;Arcade Stage Ver.1&quot; to &quot;Arcade Stage Ver.3&quot;/&quot;Street Stage&quot; appeared with new layout, Tsubaki Line, Sadamine and Akina Snow, also appeared before in &quot;Arcade Stage Ver.3&quot; which daytime is night change into the day.

The game added a new feature, &quot;1 Day 1 Time Continue,&quot; to allow players to have a free continue per day without inserting credits. New courses such as Momiji Line, for the first time in &quot;Special Stage&quot;, appeared with new layout and Hakone, the place for a battle between Ryosuke&#x27;s F.C. and Rin Hojo&#x27;s R32. &quot;Arcade Stage Ver.3&quot;/&quot;Street Stage&quot; characters such as Miki, Atsuro Kawai, and The Lan Evo Teams also return. This is the last game with Japanese voice actors before &quot;Arcade Stage Zero&quot;, which does not feature voice anymore.

Online services for &quot;Stage 8 Infinity&quot; and Initial D.net services have been concluded since April 27, 2017.

===Stage Zero===
Released for the Sega Nu2 arcade system board on 7 March 2017. Unlike its predecessors, this game now uses a 6-speed gear shifter (similar to the ones found in the Wangan Midnight Maximum Tune games) as opposed to the sequential ones. The character designs are taken from &quot;New Initial D the Movie&quot; with entirely new BGMs that are rock songs from the films such as Backdraft Smiths, Clutcho, The Hug Me, The Valves, and Gekkou Green. A small number of Eurobeat songs from previous games are also featured but have to be unlocked. Rain condition was removed as the New Initial D movies featured no race in such condition.

As like Stage 4 (which arcade system board has changed too), a number of vehicles and tracks are unavailable upon launch, but later added back through free updates later in the year. Although most of the opponents are from &quot;New Initial D the Movie&quot; series, some rivals who didn&#x27;t appear in the film such as Daiki Ninomiya, Kai Kogashiwa, Kyoichi Sudo, Kyoko Iwase, and Tomoyuki Tachi also appeared (with films&#x27; design). As well as Kanata Katagiri, protagonist of Initial D&#x27;s sequel &quot;MFGHOST&quot;.

As collaboration which was used by Japanese Auto Magazine &quot;Hot Version&quot; (formerly known as &quot;Best Motoring&quot;), &quot;Gunma Cycle Sports Center&quot;, where the magazine&#x27;s most Touge challenges was filmed at, is added along with four pre-tuned cars appeared in the challenges.

The Version 2 update was released on 18 April 2019, and featured Shun Aiba and NISMO GT-R&#x27;s 2017 Model, which appeared in &quot;MFGHOST&quot;

=== The Arcade ===
Released on the Sega ALLS MX2.1 arcade system and as upgrade kits for Initial D Arcade Stage Zero and Sega World Driver Championship on 25 February 2021, and later 29 July 2021 outside of Japan as an export version. The game had run a location test period on 23–24 July 2020 which allowed players to play the game in its beta phase. The location test gave out an Initial D The Arcade themed Aime card and an Initial D The Arcade tachometer in the style of Arcade Stage 8 Infinity for use in Initial D Arcade Stage Zero. The game is powered by Unreal Engine 4 instead of Sega&#x27;s proprietary engine used for the previous titles. Unlike the previous arcade stage games, the story mode cutscenes are presented with a manga style filter with manga panels shown as the voice acting is absent aside from the countdown used in the story mode and when the cabinets are set to 2 player or 4 player vs mode. Certain character models like the ones used in the Theory of streets, associated with the cars and used on the game&#x27;s season splash screen are reused from previous arcade stage titles. In 2023, Sega worked along with Wahlap to bring Initial D The Arcade to mainland China with full localisation.

Players who had a save file from Initial D Arcade Stage Zero or Sega World Driver Championship on their Aime card were given continued play benefits rewards which included avatar items from those games, avatar and dress-up tokens, full tune tickets depending on the number of full tuned cars the player had owned in Arcade Stage Zero or driver level in Sega World Driver Championship, and titles based on the player level in Arcade Stage Zero.

Like Arcade Stage Zero, the game launched with a small number of courses and cars with more to be added over the course of its live service. Certain collaboration events have made their return like MF Ghost, the Touhou Project featuring extra characters for the events and Hot Version. New collaboration events have occurred with Wangan Midnight, Lifeguard, Sega&#x27;s Hatsune Miku&#x27;s Project Diva, Chunithm New, Pop Team Epic, and Quintessential Quintuplets.

On 14 April 2022, a promotion was held for Sega&#x27;s Initial D series 20th Anniversary. In an update, Bunta&#x27;s Challenge was reintroduced. And play stamp cards distributed included keychains, start screen background, and tachometers that reminiscent the previous Arcade Stage titles, under neon, avatar pieces and background musics two of which were made by Dave Rodgers and one from Sega that debuted from Arcade Stage 6 AA. The three background music were brought back two times in the next two play stamp cards rerun.

===Special Stage===
&quot;Initial D Special Stage&quot; was released on 26 June 2003, for the PlayStation 2 and was re-released on 26 February 2004, under the &quot;PlayStation 2 the Best&quot; label. &quot;Initial D Special Stage&quot; is based on &quot;Initial D Arcade Stage Ver.2&quot; with additional Japanese voices for the first time and contains many features exclusive to this game. &quot;Initial D Special Stage&quot; is also the first home-console Initial D game published by Sega.

This version contains a story mode that allows the player to reenact racing scenes from the &quot;Initial D&quot; manga series (up to Vol. 25 at the time of publication), as well as several new courses then not seen in the arcade versions of the game. In one of these courses, Shomaru went on to appear in &quot;Initial D Arcade Stage Ver.3&quot;/&quot;Street Stage&quot;. Real Myogi was later added back in &quot;Initial D Arcade Stage 4&quot;/&quot;Extreme Stage&quot;. Momiji Line would not return until &quot;Initial D Arcade Stage 8 Infinity&quot;. Bunta&#x27;s Challenge is noticeably absent in the game. Additional features, including replays for saved time-attack records and Iketani&#x27;s car introduction.

Due to PlayStation 2&#x27;s hardware limitations, the graphics of the game was downgraded from its arcade counterpart. The game is compatible with Logitech&#x27;s Driving Force wheel series, and other wheel controllers made for PlayStation 2. Sega also balanced all the cars in-game due to the overpowering Integra DC2 from &quot;Initial D Arcade Stage Ver.2&quot;.

===Street Stage===
&quot;Initial D Street Stage&quot; is a PSP-exclusive game based on &quot;Initial D Arcade Stage Ver.3&quot;. This game features Dogfight by M.o.v.e. as its intro theme, which also used as the first opening theme of &quot;Initial D Fourth Stage&quot;. The legend of the street mode, which pits players against the rival characters are the same as the arcade game, but Akina (Snow) is removed, meaning the battle with Miki is also removed, although his theme can be found in the game&#x27;s BGM files.

===&quot;Initial D Extreme Stage&quot;===

&quot;Initial D Extreme Stage&quot; is a PlayStation 3 game based on &quot;Initial D Arcade Stage 4&quot;.

==Reception==
&quot;Initial D Arcade Stage&quot; (2001) sold 2,534 hardware units in Japan up until 2004. &quot;Initial D Arcade Stage Ver. 3&quot; sold 673 units between April 2004 and March 2005. Combined, both versions of the game sold approximately units up until March 2005. At a price of $2,130, the game grossed approximately in hardware sales up until March 2005.

&quot;Initial D Arcade Stage 4&quot; sold 3,904 units in 2007, including 3,056 units by March 2007, and 848 during April–September 2007. At a price of $4,250, the game grossed approximately in hardware sales up until 2007.

In total, the &quot;Initial D Arcade Stage&quot; series has sold approximately 7,111 hardware units in Japan up until 2007, grossing approximately in hardware sales.

In 2014, Patrick Michael, Sega Amusements&#x27; head of local R&amp;D, explained &quot;Initial D&quot;″s lack of popularity in Europe: &quot;Games like Initial D, which is a fantastic driving game but it&#x27;s a one-on-one race where you&#x27;re either in first place or last place. In Japan it&#x27;s very popular, but in Europe no-one wants to be in last place, really - you want a much more open road, more AI cars and more of a feeling of achievement.&quot;

<doc id="782905" wikidata="Q7716400" url="?curid=782905" title="The Bell Telephone Hour">
<text>The Bell Telephone Hour, also known as The Telephone Hour, is a concert series broadcast on NBC Radio Network from April 29, 1940 to June 30, 1958. Sponsored by Bell Telephone as the name implies, it showcased the best in classical and Broadway music, reaching eight to nine million listeners each week. It continued on television from 1959 to 1968. Throughout the program&#x27;s run on both radio and television, the studio orchestra on the program was conducted by Donald Voorhees.

==Synopsis==
After early shows featuring James Melton and Francia White as soloists, producer Wallace Magill restructured the format on April 27, 1942, into the &quot;Great Artists Series&quot; of concert and opera performers, beginning with Jascha Heifetz. The list of talents heard over the years includes Marian Anderson, Bing Crosby, Margaret Daum, Nelson Eddy, Benny Goodman, Josef Hofmann, José Iturbi, Fritz Kreisler, Gregor Piatigorsky, Oscar Levant, Ezio Pinza, Lily Pons, Gladys Swarthout, and Helen Traubel.

The series returned to radio in 1968-69 as &quot;Encores from the Bell Telephone Hour&quot; featuring highlights and interviews from the original series.

The Bell Telephone Hour Orchestra included clarinetist and saxophonist Joe Allard, who is well known as a saxophone teacher at the Juilliard School and the New England Conservatory of Music. His list of students includes Stan Getz, Eric Dolphy, Dave Liebman, Ricky Ford, Bob Hanlon, Dave Tofani, Mike Brecker, Roger Rosenberg, John Coltrane, and Steve Grossman.

Warner Anderson was the program&#x27;s announcer, and Floyd Mack the narrator.

==Television==

The TV show, seen on NBC from January 12, 1959, to April 28, 1968, was one of the first TV series to be telecast exclusively in color, using the color TV system perfected by RCA in 1954. It aired every week on Friday evenings at 10:00 pm, then was switched to Tuesday evenings at 10:00 pm in 1963. It was noted for its Christmas specials, frequently featuring opera stars and stars of musical theater and ballet. In the fall of 1965, the show was switched to an earlier time, Sundays at 6:30 pm.

In 1960, the program alternated weeks with &quot;Sing Along with Mitch&quot;. Beginning in 1965, the program sometimes had to share its time slot with an NBC news series called &quot;Actuality Specials&quot; on NBC, and was telecast every other week. In the fall of 1963, the program alternated with &quot;The Andy Williams Show&quot;.

During its last season, 1967–1968, the program was switched back to its old Friday-night time slot and the format changed from a videotaped and mostly musical presentation to filmed documentaries about classical musicians made on location. By this point, &quot;The Bell Telephone Hour&quot; was seen as a relic of a bygone era in television history.

One of the most notable of the &quot;Bell Telephone Hour&quot; documentary programs combined a tour of the Museo del Prado in Madrid, with performances by such noted Spanish musicians as Andrés Segovia, Alicia de Larrocha, and Victoria de los Ángeles. Another was a profile of Cleveland Orchestra conductor George Szell. This one was not a biography of Szell, but a documentary showing how he worked with the orchestra.

One of the last, and most notable episodes done in the videotape format, was &quot;First Ladies of Opera&quot;, featuring Joan Sutherland, Leontyne Price, Renata Tebaldi, and Birgit Nilsson, all on one program. In 1976, footage from the TV series was edited into a 90-minute retrospective TV special entitled &quot;The Bell Telephone Jubilee&quot;, hosted by Bing Crosby and Liza Minnelli.

NBC staff announcer Mel Brandt was the series announcer. ABC staff announcer Scott Vincent hosted the 1962 season finale, &quot;Till Autumn&quot;.

==Reissues on DVD==
Beginning in 2001, DVDs of performances from the television series have been released by Video Artists International. To date, VAI has issued more than two dozen DVD compilations, and a number of complete telecasts, most notably the episode of April 29, 1960, which presented a lavishly staged production of &quot;The Mikado&quot; starring Groucho Marx. The stunning array of performers who appeared on &quot;The Bell Telephone Hour&quot; television program includes:

• Singers: Barbara Cook, Franco Corelli, Régine Crespin, Victoria De Los Angeles, Giuseppe Di Stefano, Eileen Farrell, Nicolai Gedda, Dolores Gray, Mahalia Jackson, Carol Lawrence, George London, Thomas Hayward, Gordon MacRae, Ethel Merman, Robert Merrill, Anna Moffo, Birgit Nilsson, Roberta Peters, Leontyne Price, John Raitt, Dinah Shore, Risë Stevens, Joan Sutherland, Renata Tebaldi, Richard Tucker, Leslie Uggams, Jon Vickers, Mildred Miller and Gretchen Wyler

• Pianists: Claudio Arrau, Jorge Bolet, Robert Casadesus, Alicia de Larrocha, Van Cliburn, Philippe Entremont, Lorin Hollander, Byron Janis, Grant Johannesen, and José Iturbi

• Violinists: Mischa Elman, Zino Francescatti, Yehudi Menuhin, Erica Morini, David Oistrakh, Michael Rabin, Ruggiero Ricci, and Isaac Stern (Also, famed cellist Gregor Piatigorsky and master of the guitar Andrés Segovia)

• Dancers: Alicia Alonso, Erik Bruhn, Jacques d&#x27;Amboise, Carla Fracci, Rudolf Nureyev, Matt Mattox, Edward Villella, Violette Verdy, and Maria Tallchief

*Musical groups: Jefferson Airplane, The New Christy Minstrels

==Awards==
The series won two Emmys and was nominated for seven others.

==&quot;Rehearsal: The Telephone Hour&quot;==
In 1947, a 27-minute, black-and-white short subject entitled &quot;Rehearsal: The Telephone Hour&quot;, was released to theaters. Originating in NBC&#x27;s Studio 6B at 30 Rockefeller Plaza, the film featured, in addition to Voorhees and the orchestra, operatic bass Ezio Pinza and opera mezzo-soprano Blanche Thebom singing arias. It simulated a rehearsal of the popular program, complete with a commercial announcement, and then, near the end, segued to what was presumably the actual radio broadcast.

<text>Wilhelm Friedrich Ernst Bach, also known as &quot;William Bach&quot; (24 May 1759 – 25 December 1845) was the eldest son of Johann Christoph Friedrich Bach and the only grandson of Johann Sebastian Bach to gain fame as a composer. He was music director to Frederick William II of Prussia. He said, &quot;Heredity can tend to run out of ideas.&quot;

Ernst Bach received training in music from his uncle, Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach, and from another uncle in England, Johann Christian Bach. He was in London when Johann Christian Bach died there on New Year&#x27;s Day, 1782. Ernst Bach remained in England until 1784 before returning via Holland to Germany. He held a few positions, namely those of &quot;Kapellmeister&quot; of Minden in 1786, and from 1788 to 1811 as &quot;Kapellmeister&quot; in Berlin with the blessing of King Friedrich Wilhelm II. Ernst Bach retired from his position after Prince Heinrich, the brother of the Prussian King Friedrich Wilhelm III granted him a pension.

At the unveiling of the Bach Monument in Leipzig on 23 April 1843, Ernst Bach met Robert Schumann. Schumann later described Ernst Bach as &quot;a very agile old gentleman of 84 years with snow-white hair and expressive features.&quot;

One of Ernst Bach&#x27;s most remarkable compositions was &quot;Dreyblatt,&quot; a concerto for piano involving six hands. He wrote it in such a way in that it was to be performed with one large male in the middle with a petite female on either side of him. Ernst Bach indicated that the man was to stretch his arms around the ladies to play the outside parts, while the ladies performed the middle parts.

He is buried at the Friedhof II der Sophiengemeinde Berlin. Ernst Bach married twice. His only son (by his second wife) died in infancy. The first born of his three daughters, Caroline Augusta Wilhelmine, lived the longest. She died in 1871 – the very last of the Bachs.

<text>Joanna Trollope ( ; born 9 December 1943) is an English writer. She has also written under the pseudonym of Caroline Harvey. Her novel &quot;Parson Harding&#x27;s Daughter&quot; won in 1980 the Romantic Novel of the Year Award by the Romantic Novelists&#x27; Association.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Trollope was born on 9 December 1943 in her grandfather&#x27;s rectory in Minchinhampton, Gloucestershire, England, daughter of Rosemary Hodson and Arthur George Cecil Trollope. Her father was an Oxford University classics graduate who became head of a small building society. Her mother was an artist and writer. Her father was away for war service in India when she was born; he returned when she was three. The family settled in Reigate, Surrey. Trollope has a younger brother and sister. She was educated at Reigate County School for Girls, gaining scholarship to St Hugh&#x27;s College, Oxford in 1961. She read English.

Her father was of the same family as the Victorian novelist Anthony Trollope; she is his fifth-generation niece, and is a cousin of the writer and broadcaster James Trollope. Of inheriting the name, she has said:

===Career===
From 1965 to 1967, she worked at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. While a civil servant, she researched Eastern Europe and the relations between China and the developing world. From 1967 to 1979, she was employed in a number of teaching posts before she became a writer full-time in 1980.

Trollope began writing historical romances under the pseudonym of Caroline Harvey, the first names of her father&#x27;s parents. She formed the view that: &quot;It was the wrong genre for the time.&quot; Encouraged by her second husband, Ian Curteis, she switched to the contemporary fiction for which she has become known. &quot;The Choir&quot;, published in 1987, was her first contemporary novel. &quot;The Rector&#x27;s Wife&quot;, published in 1991, displaced Jeffrey Archer from the top of the hardback bestseller lists. As an explanation, she said in 2006: &quot;except for thrillers there was nothing in the middle ground of the traditional novel, which is where I think I am.&quot; In 1992, only Jilly Cooper&#x27;s &quot;Polo&quot; and Archer&#x27;s &quot;As the Crow Flies&quot; were stronger paperback bestsellers. &quot;I think my books are just the dear old traditional novel making a quiet comeback&quot;, she told Geraldine Bedell in a 1993 interview for &quot;The Independent on Sunday&quot;.

Often described as Aga sagas, for their rural themes, only two of Trollope&#x27;s novels (by 2006) actually feature an Aga. The term&#x27;s entry in &quot;The Oxford Companion to English Literature&quot; (2009) states that &quot;by no means all her work fits the generally comforting implications of the label&quot;. Rejecting the label as not being accurate, Trollope told Lisa Allardice, writing for &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2006: &quot;Actually, the novels are quite subversive, quite bleak. It&#x27;s all rather patronising isn&#x27;t it?&quot; Allardice disputed the &quot;cosy reputation&quot; Trollope&#x27;s books had acquired as her novels had &quot;tackled increasingly thorny issues including lesbianism, broken families and adoption, the mood growing darker with each novel.&quot; Terence Blacker, who coined the term for Trollope&#x27;s fiction in &quot;Publishing News&quot; in 1992, admitted a decade later that he &quot;felt terribly guilty&quot; for lumbering Trollope with the phrase. Trollope told Bedell in 1993 that her fiction does &quot;the things the traditional novel has always done&quot; by mirroring reality and exploring &quot;people&#x27;s emotional lives&quot;. Bedell observed that her novels until then were: &quot;never suburban, which is the real condition of most of England. Trollopian action takes place in large village houses, at vast kitchen tables; her doctors, vicars, solicitors and craft-gallery owners may worry about money, as her own parents did, but they don&#x27;t have any social anxieties: they are invited for drinks at the big house as a matter of course. The books are as economically prestigious, and quite as aspirational in their own way, as the glitter blockbusters of the Eighties.&quot;

In 2009, she donated the short story &quot;The Piano Man&quot; to Oxfam&#x27;s &#x27;Ox-Tales&#x27; project, four collections of UK stories written by 38 authors. Trollope&#x27;s story was published in the &#x27;Water&#x27; collection.
She has written the first novel in Harper Collins updating of the Jane Austen canon, &quot;The Austen Project&quot;. Her version of &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; was published in October 2013 with limited success.

An adaptation of &quot;The Rector&#x27;s Wife&quot; (1994), produced for Channel 4, starred Lindsay Duncan and Ronald Pickup. &quot;The Choir&quot;, adapted by Ian Curteis, was a five-episode BBC television miniseries in 1995. It starred Jane Asher and James Fox. Of her other novels, &quot;A Village Affair&quot; and &quot;Other People&#x27;s Children&quot; have also been adapted for television.

==Reviews==
&quot;A Spanish Lover&quot;: In &quot;The New York Times&quot; Betsy Groban wrote, ″Her story is filled with lively, astute and always affectionate insights into the abiding issues of marriage, motherhood and materialism, not to mention the destructive power of envy and the importance of living one&#x27;s own life. ″

&quot;Marrying the Mistress&quot;: ″With its sharp eye, light tone and sly, witty pace, Joanna Trollope&#x27;s ninth novel delivers all the ingredients of romantic comedy, yet ends with a subtle, dark twist.″

&quot;Friday Nights&quot;: Heather Thompson of &quot;The Guardian&quot; called &quot;Friday Nights&quot; &quot;a light but insightful look at a rather conventional cast of characters.&quot;

Charlie Lee-Potter, in an article for &quot;The Independent&quot;, wrote that &quot;Brother &amp; Sister&quot;:
==Personal life==
On 14 May 1966, Trollope married a city banker, David Roger William Potter; the couple had two daughters, Louise and Antonia, divorcing in 1983. In 1985, she married the television dramatist Ian Curteis and became a stepmother of his two sons; she and Curteis divorced in 2001. After her second divorce, Trollope moved to West London. She is a grandmother.

Trollope appeared on a 1994 edition of &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;. Trollope remarked that men often suggested her books were trivial, to which she liked to respond: &quot;It is a grave mistake to think there is more significance in great things than in little things&quot;, paraphrasing Virginia Woolf.

<text>August Oetker (; January 6, 1862 – January 10, 1918) was a German inventor, food scientist and business person. He is known as the creator of baking powder as a ready-to-use product, and also as the founder of the Dr. Oetker company. He was the patriarch of the Oetker family.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Oetker was born on January 6, 1862, in Obernkirchen, Electorate of Hesse, the oldest of eight children, to August Adolph Oetker (1834–1890) and Bertha Oetker (née Westphal; 1836–1902). He completed a doctoral thesis on the shape of pollen grains in 1888.

===Career===
In 1891, he bought the Aschoffsche pharmacy in Bielefeld and developed a baking agent, which was designed to ensure the success of the baking process. Prior to Oetker, a British chemist, Alfred Bird, had already invented baking powder, and American scientist Eben Norton Horsford had developed a ready-made &#x27;double-acting&#x27; baking powder.

From 1890, he distributed his invention under the brand name &quot;Backin&quot;, thus laying the basis for the family-owned company, called Oetker-Gruppe. The company still uses the very same recipe to produce baking powder. On September 21, 1909, Oetker filed a patent for his &quot;Procedure for making long-lasting baking powder or ready-to-bake flour&quot;.

Due to successful marketing, his products sold quite well and soon the old pharmacy had turned into a successful company. In 1900, Oetker built his first manufacturing plant and, by 1906, had sold 50 million packages of Backin.

===Death and legacy===
Oetker died on January 10, 1918, in Bielefeld, Germany. Later, his grandson, Rudolf August Oetker, took over the company.

Motto: (&quot;A bright mind always uses Oetker&quot;).

<text>Coors Light is a 4.2% ABV light American lager beer sold by Coors (currently Molson Coors) of Chicago, Illinois. It was first produced in 1978 by the Coors Brewing Company. They had briefly produced a different low-alcohol beer by the same name in 1941.

It is brewed in Golden, Colorado; Albany, Georgia; Elkton, Virginia; Fort Worth, Texas; Irwindale, California; and Milwaukee, Wisconsin, among other locations in the USA. The Canadian version of Coors Light is 4.0% ABV and brewed by Molson Coors Canada Inc. in Moncton, New Brunswick; St.John&#x27;s, Newfoundland; Longueuil, Quebec; Toronto, Ontario and Chilliwack, British Columbia. In Australia, the United Kingdom and Ireland, Coors Light is labeled as &quot;Coors&quot;.

Coors Light&#x27;s primary competitors are Miller Lite and Keystone Light, both also owned by Molson Coors, and Bud Light, owned by AB InBev, Molson Coors&#x27;s rival and fellow global beer giant.

==History==
In 1941 Coors introduced a lower-alcohol beer called Coors Light. The beer was discontinued after one year on the market. Coors Light was reintroduced in 1978 to compete with Miller Lite as a &quot;diet beer&quot;. 

Coors markets its other product, Coors Banquet Beer as &quot;America&#x27;s fine light&quot; because it was lighter in body and color than other beers when it was introduced. This has created confusion between the Coors beers, despite the beers being of different recipes and calorie levels. This confusion has been aggravated by the marketing of Coors Light simply as Coors in Europe.

==Marketing and advertising==

The beer has a &quot;Cold Certified&quot; label which turns the mountains on the label from white to blue when the beer&#x27;s temperature is lowered to . The success of this packaging gimmick has led to the phrase &quot;Mountains are Blue&quot; becoming a popular saying among working-class Western Americans. Coors Light has a &quot;mountain icon&quot; to represent the beer as part of the logo. As of 2020, the icon is a stylized drawing of a mountain with two peaks, along with the removal of their famous &#x27;cold lined&#x27; can conditioning blue liner.
Coors Light advertising highlights the quality of the beer as &quot;the most refreshing place on earth&quot;. Additionally, Coors Light ads are designed to target young demographics. The stories behind the ads seek to capture the attention of young people, situating them in cool places they would like to be. The Cavalry advertising agency of Chicago, IL was responsible for the &#x27;Reach For The Cold&#x27; Campaign featuring the Coors Light Explorers. In April 2013, the agency produced a Digital Video for Coors Light ad known as &quot;Coors Light the brewer ambushes a summer pool party with the frosty taste of winter&quot;. The television ad was considered the ad of the week in the Adweek publication.

The brewery introduced the tagline &quot;perfect shot of refreshment&quot; under the slogan of a “Silver Bullet”, a symbol of the silver can that holds the beer.

==Containers and packaging==

In May 2013, the Coors Light aluminum pint, featuring Ball Corporation&#x27;s Alumi-Tek bottle, was awarded a Gold Award from The Packaging Association (PAC) and was chosen as the Canadian Packaging Consumers Voice Award winner at the recent PAC Leadership Awards. The Coors Light aluminum pint was selected for its eye-catching graphics, recyclability and the convenience of the bottle&#x27;s wide mouth and resealable closure.

==Controversial can advertising claims==

In August 2013, the advertising industry&#x27;s self-regulatory unit referred Coors Light ad claims to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). The claims that the FTC considered ad challenging included, “the world&#x27;s most refreshing can&quot;, &quot;beer on the inside, science on the outside&quot; and &quot;smoother, more refreshing pour&quot;, implying that the can was somehow technologically superior to other beer cans and provides a more refreshing beverage experience.
According to the National Advertising Division (NAD), Coors declined to provide a substantive response to the challenge. Coors defended the claims as either puffery or truthful. The company also told NAD that the television, radio and digital campaigns would be permanently discontinued by the end of September 2013.

==International markets==
In order to expand Molson Coors brand portfolio outside of its major markets (US, UK, Canada), Molson Coors established Molson Coors International in 2008. MCI operates in three primary regions; Asia, Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean. Coors Light, as a signature brand of Molson Coors, was introduced in the new markets. The world&#x27;s sixth-largest brewer, which also makes Molson Canadian, Carling and Blue Moon, was trying to diversify beyond its core markets.

== Awards and sponsorship ==
Since 1998, Coors Light has sponsored numerous LGBT pride parades and events. MillerCoors is the primary sponsor of the Coors Light Denver PrideFest.

In 2005, Coors Light was awarded with a silver medal in the Great American Beer Festival in the American-Style Light Lager category.

Title sponsorship of the newly created Coors Light National Hockey League Stadium Series. Coors&#x27; sponsorship of the stadium series is part of the beer company&#x27;s seven-year, $375M deal signed with the NHL in February 2011, the league&#x27;s most financially lucrative sponsorship ever.

In 2013, Coors Light signed a year-long deal with Turner Broadcasting, which includes a sponsorship of the NASCAR Mobile applications. Coors Light uses the sponsorship with in-application banners and content to connect with NASCAR&#x27;s core demographic of sports fans. The initiative builds on Coors Light&#x27;s previous mobile initiatives to target consumers by demographic.

== Promotions ==

In the 1990s, Coors Light sponsored what was then America&#x27;s most dominant domestic professional cycling team, which included Olympians Alexi Grewal, Roy Knickman, and Davis Phinney.

In 2008, Coors Light became known as the &quot;Official Beer of NASCAR&quot;, succeeding Budweiser.

In 2009, a Coors Light koozie depicting scenes from the 2010 Winter Olympics was offered in a limited number of cases that contained 28 bottles instead of 24. That same year, the Hillside Chalet Contest was created. The winner was given a 6-night stay in Whistler, British Columbia, during the 2010 Winter Olympics.

During 2012 and 2013, Coors Light partnered with Ice Cube for the Coors Light Search for the Coldest National Tour and Talent Search.

Prior to the 2019 college football season, Coors struck a deal with ESPN and their College GameDay broadcast to become &quot;The Official Beer of Saturday Morning.”

<text>Rustam Kasimdzhanov (born 5 December 1979) is an Uzbek chess grandmaster and former FIDE World Champion (2004-05). He was Asian champion in 1998.

In addition to his tournament play, Kasimdzhanov was a longtime second to Viswanathan Anand, including during the 2008, 2010 and 2012 World Championship matches. He has also trained World Championship candidates Sergey Karjakin and Fabiano Caruana.

==Early career==
His best results include first in the 1998 Asian Chess Championship, second in the World Junior Chess Championship in 1999, first at Essen 2001, first at Pamplona 2002 (winning a blitz playoff against Victor Bologan after both had finished the main tournament on 3½/6), first with 8/9 at the HZ Chess Tournament 2003 in Vlissingen, joint first with Liviu Dieter Nisipeanu with 6/9 at Pune 2005, a bronze-medal winning performance (score of 9½/12 points) on board one for his country at the 2000 Chess Olympiad and runner-up in the FIDE Chess World Cup in 2002 (losing to Viswanathan Anand in the final). He has played in the prestigious Wijk aan Zee tournament twice, but did not perform well either time: in 1999 he finished 11th of 14 with 5/13, in 2002 he finished 13th of 14 with 4½/13.

==FIDE World Chess Champion 2004==

In the FIDE World Chess Championship 2004 in Tripoli, Libya, Kasimdzhanov unexpectedly made his way through to the final, winning mini-matches against Alejandro Ramírez, Ehsan Ghaem Maghami, Vasyl Ivanchuk, Zoltán Almási, Alexander Grischuk and Veselin Topalov to meet Michael Adams to play for the title and the right to face world number one Garry Kasparov in a match.

In the final six-game match of the Championship, both players won two games, making a tie-break of rapid games necessary. Kasimdzhanov won the first game with black, after having been in a difficult position. By drawing the second game he became the new FIDE champion.

==Other world championship results==

Kasimdzhanov&#x27;s 2004 championship victory earned him an invitation to the eight-player FIDE World Chess Championship 2005, where he tied with Michael Adams for 6th–7th places.

The 2004 championship also earned him one of sixteen places in the Candidates Tournament for the FIDE World Chess Championship 2007. His first round opponent was Boris Gelfand.

<text>General Sir James Kempt, ( – 20 December 1854) was a British Army officer, who served in the Netherlands, Egypt, Italy, the Peninsula, and British North America during the Napoleonic Wars. He led a British brigade at the Battle of Waterloo and later became Governor General of Canada.

==Early career==
Born in Edinburgh around 1765, he was the son of Gavin Kempt of Batley Hall, Hampshire.

Kempt was gazetted to the 101st Grenadiers in India in 1783, but on its disbandment two years later was placed on half-pay. It is said that he took a clerkship in Greenwoods, the army agents (afterwards Cox &amp; Co.). He attracted the notice of the Duke of York, through whom he obtained a captaincy (very soon followed by a majority) in the newly raised 113th Foot. But it was not long before his regiment experienced the fate of the old 101st; this time however Kempt was retained on full pay in the recruiting service.

In 1799 Kempt accompanied Sir Ralph Abercromby to the Netherlands, and later to Egypt as an aide-de-camp. After Abercromby&#x27;s death, Kempt remained on his successor&#x27;s staff until the end of the campaign in Egypt. In April 1803 he joined the staff of Sir David Dundas, but next month returned to regimental duty, and a little later received a lieutenant colonelcy in the 81st Foot. With his new regiment he went, under Craig, to the Mediterranean theatre of operations, and at the Battle of Maida on 4 July 1806, he led the light infantry brigade which bore the heaviest share of the battle.

==Peninsular War==
Employed from 1807 to 1811 on the staff in North America, Brevet-Colonel Kempt at the end of 1811 joined Arthur Wellesley, Marquess of Wellington&#x27;s army in Spain with the local rank of major general, which was, on 1 January 1812, made substantive. As one of Thomas Picton&#x27;s brigadiers, Kempt took part in the great assault on Badajoz and was severely wounded. On rejoining for duty, he was posted to the command of a brigade of the Light Division (43rd Regiment of Foot, 95th Rifles, and 3rd Portuguese Light Infantry) in time to fight at the Battle of Vitoria on 21 June 1813. He also led his brigade at the Battle of the Pyrenees at the end of July, and at the Battle of the Bidassoa, where his troops stormed French defenses near Mont La Rhune on 7 October. While still commanding his brigade at the Battle of Nivelle on 10 November, he was again wounded. In 1814, he led his brigade at the battles of Orthez and Toulouse.

==Canada and Waterloo==
After the first abdication of Napoleon Bonaparte, Kempt was transferred once again to North America, where the Anglo-American War of 1812 was still being fought. He commanded a brigade which was intended to attack the vital American post of Sackets Harbor, New York, but logistical problems prevented the attack being made before winter brought an end to campaigning in Canada. News of peace between Britain and America reached Canada early in 1815, and Kempt returned to Europe.

Kempt was appointed to lead the 8th British Brigade in the army Wellington assembled in Belgium to invade France. The 8th Brigade consisted of the 1/28th, 1/32nd, 2/79th Highland and 1/95th Rifles in Sir Thomas Picton&#x27;s 5th Division. At the Battle of Quatre Bras, Kempt&#x27;s brigade was involved in heavy fighting and suffered 638 killed and wounded. At the Battle of Waterloo on 18 June, his brigade was again in the thick of combat and lost 681 killed and wounded. On Picton&#x27;s death, Kempt succeeded to the command of the division. Early in 1815 he was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath, and in July for his services at Waterloo, a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath.

The Dutch King made him a Knight in the Military Order of William. He became Lieutenant-Governor of Portsmouth and General Officer Commanding South-West District in August 1819.

From 1828 to 1830 he was Governor of British North America, and at a critical time displayed firmness and moderation. He was afterwards Master-General of the Ordnance. At the time of his death at his home in South Audley Street, London in 1854 he had for some years been a full general and left a personal fortune of some £120,000.

<text>Mount Arvon ( ) at , is the highest natural point in the U.S. state of Michigan. Located in L&#x27;Anse Township, Baraga County, Mount Arvon is part of the Huron Mountains. It rises about south of Lake Superior (elevation ). On the list of highest natural points in each U.S. state, Mount Arvon ranks 38th. It is the highest natural point in the East North Central states.

Mount Arvon is a few miles from Mount Curwood, which for years had been designated as Michigan&#x27;s highest spot until a resurvey in 1982 with modern technology determined that Mount Arvon is taller than Mount Curwood. Mount Arvon is about east of L&#x27;Anse, although it is about a drive from the city; much of it lies on winding logging roads.

The soils of Mount Arvon are classic podzols which have developed on sandy loam glacial till locally overlain with a loamy or silty mantle. The Munising sandy loam-Michigamme silt loam complex is dominant.

The property is owned by the MeadWestvaco paper company but public access is allowed.

In 2018, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported that the highest surface elevation in Michigan was the top of the Tilden Mine waste pile in Marquette County near Ishpeming. At the time, the top of the pile was at slightly above , more than higher than the summit of Mount Arvon.

<text>Leonard George (born 1957) is a Canadian psychologist and schizophrenia researcher based in Vancouver, British Columbia, best known for his writing and lectures on varieties of anomalous phenomena, spirituality, psychology and history. In the 1990s he was a noted broadcaster in Canada, appearing on radio and television in that country and in the United States where he appeared on national programs such as a highly rated NBC special hosted by actor Peter Graves in October 1994.

He is the author of two extensively annotated reference works on paranormal experience and religious history. The &quot;Washington Post&quot; included his &quot;Crimes of Perception: An Encyclopedia of Heresies and Heretics&quot; in a 1995 round-up of notable religion themed books. This volume also appeared in British (London: Robson Books, 1995; Northam: Roundhouse, 2001) and several Spanish-language editions published in Spain and Mexico (Barcelona: Robinbook, 1998; Barcelona: Editorial Oceano, 1999; Mexico: Oceano, 1999). His second reference work, &quot;Alternative Realities: The Paranormal, The Mystic and the Transcendent in Human Experience&quot; (1995) was republished in a Book-of-the-Month Club edition in 1996.

George completed his B.Sc. in psychology at the University of Toronto in 1979. He earned his M.A. (1980) and Ph.D. (1985) in clinical psychology at the University of Western Ontario. He completed a one-year postdoctoral residency in 1986 at Victoria Hospital in London, Ontario, and completed licensing requirements and became a Registered Psychologist in both Ontario (1986) and British Columbia (1990). In addition to his clinical career, George is noted for his early experimental work and publications on the cognition of schizophrenia. He also conducted some of the earliest research on practice effects in mental imagery enhancement training His summaries of the relationship of cognitive variables such as mental imagery enhancement training, altered states of consciousness and expectancy to psi were also among the first reviews of the experimental literature on these topics. In recent years George has made contributions to the cognitive science of religion through his application of findings from experimental research to interpretations of Neoplatonic texts through publications and presentations at the annual conferences of the International Society for Neoplatonic Studies (in 2003, 2005, 2009, and 2016), the Association for the Study of Esotericism (2014) and the American Academy of Religion (2015).

From 1980 to 1981 George was a Research Fellow at the Foundation for Research on the Nature of Man in Durham, North Carolina. This was parapsychologist J.B. Rhine&#x27;s Institute for Parapsychology, now renamed the Rhine Research Center.

Between 2013 and 2017 he was Chair of the Department of Psychology at Capilano University. In 2017 he became Chair of the School of Social Sciences at Caplilano University. George retired from full-time teaching at Capilano in April 2018.

George has offered seminars across North America and Europe and in places as diverse as Alexandria, Egypt, and Iceland. Many of these were part of the eleven Esoteric Quest programs of the New York Open Center he has served as a presenter or advisor beginning in 2000.

In July 2017 George delivered an invited presentation at the Institute of Philosophy, the Mongolian Academy of Sciences, in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. He was invited to do so by Chuluunbaatar Gelegpil, Mongolia&#x27;s Minister of Education and Culture. Accompanied by American psychologist and historian of medicine Richard Noll, George also conducted anthropological fieldwork among Mongol shamans and Buddhist lamas in areas outside Ulaanbaatar and in the eastern Gobi near Sainshand in Dornogovi province. Seven short videos of Mongol shamans performing a summer solstice ritual (Ulaan Tergel) on 21 June 2017 are available online.

<text>Captain Thomas Brown FRSE FLS (1785 – 8 October 1862) was a British naturalist and malacologist.

Brown was born in Perth, Scotland, and educated at the Royal High School, Edinburgh.

When he was twenty, he joined the Forfar and Kincardine Militia, rising to the rank of captain in 1811. When he was quartered in Manchester, he became interested in nature, and edited Oliver Goldsmith&#x27;s &quot;Animated Nature&quot;. After his regiment was disbanded he bought the Fifeshire flax mill. That, however, burned down before Brown had the opportunity to insure it. He then started to write books about nature for a living.

He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1818, one of his proposers being James Jardine.

In 1840 he became curator of the Manchester Museum, where he served for twenty-two years.

He wrote several natural history books, a few dealing with conchology. He became a fellow of the Linnean Society, a member of the Wernerian, Kirwanian and Phrenological Societies, and president of the Physical Society. Material from his books was used by United States naturalist Thomas Wyatt for his book &quot;Manual of Conchology&quot;.

A species of sea snail, a marine gastropod, was named after him: &quot;Zebina browniana&quot; d&#x27;Orbigny, 1842.

<doc id="783023" wikidata="Q1479333" url="?curid=783023" title="Orange roughy">
<text>The orange roughy (Hoplostethus atlanticus), also known as the red roughy, slimehead and deep sea perch, is a relatively large deep-sea fish belonging to the slimehead family (Trachichthyidae). The UK Marine Conservation Society has categorized orange roughy as &quot;vulnerable to exploitation&quot;. It is bathypelagic, found in cold (), deep () waters of the Western Pacific Ocean, eastern Atlantic Ocean (from Iceland to Morocco; and from Walvis Bay, Namibia, to off Durban, South Africa), Indo-Pacific (off New Zealand and Australia), and in the eastern Pacific off Chile. The orange roughy is notable for its extraordinary lifespan, attaining over 200 years. It is important to commercial deep-trawl fisheries. The fish is a bright, brick-red color, fading to a yellowish-orange after death.

Like other slimeheads, orange roughy is slow-growing and late to mature, resulting in a very low resilience, making them extremely susceptible to overfishing. Many stocks (especially those off New Zealand and Australia, which were first exploited in the late 1970s), became severely depleted within 3–20 years, but several have subsequently recovered to levels that fisheries management believe are sustainable, although substantially below unfished populations.

== Description ==

The orange roughy is not a vertically slender fish. Its rounded head is riddled with muciferous canals (part of the lateral line system), as is typical of slimeheads. The single dorsal fin contains four to six spines and 15 to 19 soft rays; the anal fin contains three spines and 10 to 12 soft rays. The 19 to 25 ventral scutes (modified scales) form a hard, bony median ridge between the pelvic fins and anus. The pectoral fins contain 15 to 18 soft rays each; the pelvic fins are thoracic and contain one spine and six soft rays; the caudal fin is forked. The interior of the mouth and gill cavity is a bluish black; the mouth itself is large and strongly oblique. The scales are ctenoid and adherent. The lateral line is uninterrupted, with 28 to 32 scales whose spinules or &#x27;ctenii&#x27; largely obscure the lateral line&#x27;s pores. The eyes are large.

The orange roughy is the largest known slimehead species at a maximum standard length (a measurement that excludes the tail fin) of and a maximum weight of . The average commercial catch size is commonly between in length, again, varying by area. The orange roughy also has many predators, like bigger sharks such as goblin sharks and megamouth sharks, and larger fish. Oilfish also sometimes scoop up orange roughy on the ocean floor. 

== Life history ==

Orange roughy are generally sluggish and demersal; they form aggregations with a natural population density of up to 2.5 fish per m2, now reduced to about 1.0 per m2. These aggregations form in and around geologic structures, such as undersea canyons and seamounts, where water movement and mixing is high, ensuring dense prey concentrations. The aggregations are not necessarily for spawning or feeding; the fish are thought to cycle through metabolic phases (active or feeding and inactive or resting) and seek areas with ideal hydrologic conditions to congregate during each phase. They lose almost all pigmentation while inactive, when they are very approachable. Predators include large, deep-roving sharks, cutthroat eels, merluccid hakes, and snake mackerels.

When active, juveniles feed primarily on zooplankton such as mysid shrimp, euphausiids (krill), mesopelagic and benthopelagic fish, amphipods, and other crustaceans; mature adults consume smaller fish, predominantly of the Butterflyfish and Lanternfish families, and squid, which make up to 20% of their diet. The diet of the orange roughy is depth-related, with adult diets inversely related to that of juveniles. For example, juvenile consumption of crustaceans is lowest at but increases with depth, while crustaceans in the adult diet peak at and decrease with depth. The consumption of fish is the opposite: juvenile consumption decreases with depth while adult consumption increases. This inverse feeding pattern may be an example of resource-partitioning to avoid intraspecific competition for the available food at depths where prey is less abundant. The orange roughy&#x27;s metabolic phases are thought to be related to seasonal variations in prey concentrations. The inactive phase conserves energy during lean periods. Orange roughy can live for over 200 years.

=== Reproduction ===
Orange roughy are oceanodromous (wholly marine), pelagic spawners: that is, they migrate several hundred kilometers between localized spawning and feeding areas each year and form large spawning aggregations (possibly segregated according to gender) wherein the fish release large, spherical eggs in diameter, made buoyant by an orange-red oil globule) and sperm &quot;en masse&quot; directly into the water. The fertilized eggs, (and later larvae) are planktonic, rising to around to develop, with the young fish eventually descending to deeper waters as they mature. Orange roughy are also synchronous, shedding sperm and eggs at the same time. The time between fertilization and hatching is thought to be 10 to 20 days; fecundity is low, with each female producing only 22,000 eggs per kg of body weight, less than 10% of the average for other species of fish. Females rarely produce more than 90,000 eggs in a single spawning event. Spawning may last up to three weeks and starts around June or July. Orange roughy are very slow-growing and do not begin to breed until they are at least 20 years old, when they are around in length.

The maturation age used in stock assessments ranges from 23 to 40 years, which limits population growth/recovery, because each new generation takes so long to start spawning.

===Lifespan===
When commercial fishing of orange roughy began in the 1970s, they were thought to live for only 30 years. Since the 1990s, however, there is clear evidence that this species lives to an exceptional age. Early estimates of 149 years were determined via radiometric dating of trace isotopes found in an orange roughy&#x27;s otolith (ear bone); counting by the growth rings of orange roughy otoliths gave estimated ages of 125 to 156 years. One specimen caught 1500 km east of Wellington in 2015 was estimated to be over 230 years old. Orange roughy caught near Tasmania have been aged at 250 years. The orange roughy is the longest-lived commercial fish species, and does not breed every year, which has important implications for its conservation status.

==Consumption==
The flesh is firm with a mild flavour; it is sold skinned and filleted, fresh or frozen. This species was first given the common name &quot;Orange Roughy&quot; by scientists in New Zealand in 1975 following the discovery of large aggregations during a deep-water research cruise. A large scale fishery for orange roughy subsequently developed around New Zealand, and imports into the United States increased where it was renamed from the less gastronomically appealing &quot;slimehead&quot; through a U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service program during the late 1970s that identified underused species that should be renamed to make them more marketable.

Historically, the United States has been the largest consumer of orange roughy, however, in recent years, the market for orange roughy in China has increased significantly. In 2014, the U.S. imported around 1,455 tonnes (4.4 million lb) (mainly fillets) from New Zealand, China, Peru and Indonesia. In 2015, China imported at least 4,000 tonnes (8.8 million lb) (mainly whole fish).

A number of major food retailers have established seafood sustainability policies to reassure customers that they are stocking sustainable seafood. These policies often involve partnering with non-governmental organizations to define criteria for seafood that may be stocked. In addition, a number of ecolabels exist to help retailers and consumers identify seafood that has been independently assessed against a robust, scientific standard. One of the best known such programmes is that of the Marine Stewardship Council.

In 2010, Greenpeace International added orange roughy (deep sea perch) to its seafood red list, which contains fish generally sourced from unsustainable fisheries.

A 2003 joint report by the TRAFFIC Oceania and World Wildlife Foundation Endangered Seas Program argues, &quot;probably no such thing [exists] as an economically viable deep-water fishery that is also sustainable.&quot; However, others have argued that deepwater fisheries can be managed sustainably provided that it is recognized that sustainable yields are low and catches are set accordingly.

Because of its longevity, the orange roughy accumulates large amounts of mercury in its tissues, having a range of 0.30–0.86 ppm compared with an average mercury level of 0.086 ppm for other edible fish. Based on average consumption and the recommendations of a National Marine Fisheries Service study, in 1976 the FDA set the maximum safe mercury level for fish at 1 ppm. Regular consumption of orange roughy can have adverse effects on health. Compared to most edible fish, orange roughy is a very poor source of omega-3 fatty acids, averaging less than 3.5 g/kg.

==Fisheries==
Orange roughy fisheries exist in New Zealand, Australia and Namibia. Annual global catches began in 1979 and increased significantly to a high of over 90,000 tonnes in the late 1980s. These high catch levels quickly decreased as stocks were fished down. For many stocks, the lack of understanding of the biological characteristics meant that they were overfished. By the end of the 1990s, three of the eight New Zealand orange roughy fisheries had collapsed and were closed. Because of its longevity, late maturation and relatively low fecundity, orange roughy stocks tend to recover more slowly than most other species.

A number of orange roughy stocks live outside the jurisdiction of any particular nation, making it more challenging to limit overall catches. The South Pacific Regional Fisheries Management Organisation (SPRFMO) and the South Indian Ocean Fisheries Agreement have orange roughy stocks that are managed within their jurisdictions. These organizations have made progress toward collecting better information on total orange roughy catches and also with setting catch limits for fisheries on the high seas. For example, SPRFMO limited orange roughy catches and effort from 2007.

Orange roughy is fished almost exclusively by bottom trawling. This fishing method has been heavily criticized by environmentalists for its destructive nature. This, combined with heavy commercial demand, has focused criticism from both environmentalists and media.

=== New Zealand fisheries ===
New Zealand currently [when?] operates the largest orange roughy fisheries in the world, with a total catch of over 8,500 tonnes in the 2014 calendar year. This accounts for 95% of the total estimated catch of orange roughy. Exports of orange roughy provided an estimated revenue to New Zealand of NZ$53 million (US$37M) in 2015.

Fisheries in New Zealand are managed through the Quota Management System (QMS), under which individuals or companies own quota shares for a stock of a particular species or species group. For each stock, a Total Allowable Catch (TAC) is set that maintains the stock at or above a level that can produce the maximum sustainable yield or that will move the stock toward that level. Orange roughy has been managed within the QMS since 1986.

The Ministry for Primary Industries is responsible for the implementation of the QMS and its enabling legislation, the Fisheries Act 1996.

==== Historical ====
Fishery farming of orange roughy was initiated in the mid-1970s, but full exploitation did not begin until 1979. There was no regulation of these early catches, and records indicate that they were very high. For many fisheries, management settings allow for a &quot;fishing down&quot; period during which the biomass is reduced to a level that will provide the maximum sustainable yield. For example, a fishery with a hypothetical unfished biomass of 100,000 tonnes will be allowed to be fished down to a biomass of 40,000 tonnes (assuming that this is the biomass that provides for the maximum sustainable yield) over a number of years. The rate of this &quot;fish-down&quot; can vary depending on the objectives of the fishery, but catches would then be more strictly controlled to maintain the biomass at around 40,000 tonnes.

For the New Zealand orange roughy fisheries, productivity parameters and resulting estimates of unfished biomass were incorrectly estimated in the first decade of the fishery. Catch limits exceeded recommended estimates of sustainable yields for a subsequent decade and catches were estimated to have exceeded those catch limits because of burst nets, escape windows in nets and lost gear. Catch limits were reduced in the mid-1990s, although they were increased again following indications that stocks had begun to rebuild. This was later found not to be the case and a number of fisheries were closed completely or had catch limits reduced to one tonne to allow the stocks to rebuild.

In one New Zealand fishery, the Total Allowable Catch (TAC) was reduced in 2008 from 1,470 tonnes to 914 tonnes, but this reduction was challenged in court. In February 2008, the High Court overturned the new quota, ruling that the Minister of Fisheries did not have the legal power to set quotas for ORH1. This was because of a strict interpretation of the Fisheries Act that required an accurate estimation of the biomass that could support the maximum sustainable yield. As a result of this decision, the Fisheries Act 1996 was amended to allow TACs to be set based on the best available information in the absence of an estimate of the biomass that could support the maximum sustainable yield.

==== Current situation (2016) ====
The New Zealand fishing industry contracted a pre-assessment of selected orange roughy fisheries against the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) Fisheries Standard in 2009. Following the pre-assessment, the industry representative body (Deepwater Group Ltd) put four orange roughy fisheries into Fishery Improvement Plans (FIPs) to deliver improvements in the fisheries that would enable them to meet the certification requirements of the MSC. These FIPs are public and have been monitored by the Sustainable Fisheries Partnership.

In 2014, Bayesian model-based stock assessments were completed for four of New Zealand&#x27;s main orange roughy stocks, one of which had been closed to fishing since 2000. The stock assessments used data collected by research surveys carried out by research organizations and the fishing industry. A key factor was the use of new acoustic technology, developed by the fishing industry, in recent surveys. The multi-frequency acoustic optical system (AOS) enables scientists to differentiate the types of fish acoustically ‘seen’ during the survey and works on slopes that previously made effective surveying impossible in some areas. The AOS also has the potential to allow scientists to see in real-time video, what is being measured by the survey. Other research-derived data were also critical to the success of the stock assessments, notably age-frequencies from improved ageing methods.

The 2014 stock assessments, which were subject to a robust peer review process, indicated that three of the stocks had recovered enough to sustain increased catches. The TACs for these stocks were subsequently increased. The fourth stock was estimated to be at a low stock status and the TAC was reduced by over 40% to allow the stock to rebuild.

In addition, an industry sponsored Management Strategy Evaluation was completed that provided an estimate of the biomass that could support the maximum sustainable yield (≈25–27% of the unfished biomass). Based on this output, the fishing industry agreed to aim to maintain the orange roughy stocks within a management target range of 30–50% of the unfished biomass. Further to this, a Harvest Control Rule was agreed that would define what catch limits should be given an estimate of stock status. Catch limits for those fisheries are currently consistent with the outputs of the agreed Harvest Control Rule.
In May 2014, three orange roughy fisheries entered full assessment against the Marine Stewardship Council Fisheries Standard.

===Australian fisheries===
The Australian orange roughy fishery was not discovered until the 1970s, but by 2008, the biomass of some stocks remained high while others was estimated to be down to 10% of the unfished level after years of commercial fishing. It was the first commercially sought fish to appear on Australia&#x27;s threatened species list because of overfishing. By late 2017, a number of Australian orange roughy fisheries had been re-opened.

In July 2020, a leading US-based MSC consultancy (conformity assessment body or CAB) acting for a group of Australian eastern zone orange roughy quota holders, released a scoring report recommended that the orange roughy eastern zone stock be given Marine Stewardship Council accreditation, scoring the fishery and its management highly (289/300) in each of the three assessment principles. However, environmental groups the Australian Marine Conservation Society and World Wildlife Fund raised late objections. MSC&#x27;s decision to allow objections from these two eNGOs who did not engage in the more than year long process in contravention of the MSC Standard is seen by many as raising questions about the independence and credibility of the standard itself.

The Arbitrator issued her decision in three iterations in early 2021 each following representations from the Appellants, CAB and Fishery Client. During the process the Australian Minister for fisheries wrote to the MSC explaining that although orange roughy was listed under Australia&#x27;s EPBC Act (1999) that it was also managed under the Fisheries Management Act(1991) and Fisheries Administration Act (1991) and that the commercial take of orange roughy allowed continued recovery and that it is listed in a section of the EPBC Act that allowed this commercial take. However, the Arbitrator found that her view was that the standard could not have intended threatened species to be certified and that the goal for threatened species should be zero catch. Further, that because orange roughy was listed under the EPBC Act that it should be considered as an endangered, threatened and protected (ETP) species as part of MSC Principle 2 and could therefore not also be considered as a target or subject stock under Principle 1.

In her second decision (February 2021) the Arbitrator summarised her decision by stating, &quot;This particular stock is, according to the CAB and I have no reason within my limited remit, to disagree with this view, well managed and currently sustainably fished in terms of the prevailing science. I do acknowledge therefore that the remand decision will be all the more unwelcome by the CAB and the fishery client. However, the difficulty, in my view, lies in the narrow terms of the Standard when read against the Australian ETP legislation. It is not open to me to go beyond my interpretation, in light of any views I might have on the otherwise sustainability of the stock and the suitability of the unit of assessment for certification. The remedy to this lies outside of this process in seeking a change either to the Australian legislation or clarity in the Standard.

The Fishery Client subsequently withdrew the stock from assessment. Documents from the objection process can be found here https://fisheries.msc.org/en/fisheries/australia-orange-roughy-eastern-zone-trawl/@@assessments.

The precedent set by this decision has raised questions about the future of MSC in Australia given that a number of fish species involved in existing MSC certificates are listed under the EPBC Act. The current apparent incompatibility of the MSC Standard and Australian legislation is one reason why the MSC system has been so slow to develop in Australia and that Australian consumers have little recognition of the MSC brand.

<text>Club Atlético San Lorenzo de Almagro, commonly known as San Lorenzo de Almagro, is an Argentine professional sports club based in the Boedo neighborhood of Buenos Aires. It is best known for its football team, which plays in the Primera División, the first tier of the Argentine football league system. San Lorenzo is also considered one of the &quot;Big Five&quot; of Argentine football, along with Independiente, River Plate, Boca Juniors, and Racing Club.

San Lorenzo plays its home games at Estadio Pedro Bidegain, popularly known as &quot;Nuevo Gasómetro&quot;. The stadium and sports facilities are located in the Bajo Flores neighborhood of Buenos Aires. The club&#x27;s previous stadium was the &quot;Viejo Gasómetro&quot;, located in Boedo. In 1979, the &quot;Gasómetro&quot; was expropriated by the de facto Government of Argentina and then sold to supermarket chain Carrefour. The club currently has six locations: three in Boedo, one in Monserrat, one at Bajo Flores, and one in Villa Gesell. San Lorenzo also plans to expand its main seat on La Plata Avenue, while a 15-hectare campus in Ezeiza is projected to develop an Olympic football program.

San Lorenzo&#x27;s historical rival is Huracán, located in Parque Patricios. The two clubs play one of the older derbies in Argentina. Some supporters consider this derby as the third-most important after Superclásico and Clásico de Avellaneda, in addition to being one of the most uneven derbies of Argentine Football.

Other sports practised at the club are artistic roller skating, basketball, field hockey, futsal, handball, martial arts, roller hockey, swimming, tennis, and volleyball. Some years ago, San Lorenzo had also opened a rugby union section, but it is no longer active. San Lorenzo gained international recognition in March 2013 with the election of Pope Francis, a supporter and &quot;socio&quot; (member) of the club. The players played with the Pope&#x27;s photo on their shirts during a league match against Colón on 16 March 2013.

==History==

===Origins of the club===

The roots of the institution are a team formed by a group of children that played football in the corner of México and Treinta y Tres Orientales streets of Buenos Aires. Due to increasing traffic in the city, playing football in the streets became a risky activity for the boys. Lorenzo Massa, the Catholic priest of the neighbourhood&#x27;s church, saw how a tram almost knocked down one of the boys while they were playing in the streets. As a way to prevent more accidents, he offered the boys to play in the church&#x27;s backyard, under the condition they go to mass on Sundays.
On 1 April 1908, an assembly was held in the Almagro district of Buenos Aires with the purpose of establishing a club. During the meeting, several names were proposed. The first option was &quot;Los Forzosos de Almagro&quot; (&quot;The Strongmen of Almagro&quot;, the name used by the boys for their street football squad), which did not sound good to Father Massa (who was present). The other proposal was to name the club &quot;San Lorenzo&quot; as an homage to Massa, but he declined to be so honoured.

Nevertheless, the name was finally accepted by the priest, explaining that the name would not honour himself but both Lawrence of Rome (&quot;San Lorenzo&quot; in Spanish) and the Battle of San Lorenzo, one of the most significant combats for the Independence of Argentina. Another founding member, Federico Monti, suggested to add the name of the neighbourhood, Almagro where most of the members lived, which was accepted by the assembly.

Due to the team not having its own a stadium, San Lorenzo began to play its home games in a field of the Club Martínez, placed in the nearby town of the same name. The squad played its first match on 26 April 1914. At the end of the season, San Lorenzo had to play a final match against Excursionistas to declare a champion. San Lorenzo won the series (the results were 0–0 and 5–0). This title allowed San Lorenzo to enter the playoffs in for promotion to the Argentine Primera División, which was finally obtained after beating Club Honor y Patria by 3–0.

===First years in Primera===
San Lorenzo began to play in the Argentine Football Association tournaments on 26 April 1914 in the second division, where the team finished sharing first place with Excursionistas. As a result, both teams played a two-match series to determine which team would proceed to the playoffs. San Lorenzo won the series after thrashing Excursionistas 5–0 in the second game. In playoffs, San Lorenzo eliminated other teams before playing the final against Honor y Patria, winning 3–0 and being promoted to Primera División.´

San Lorenzo made its debut in Primera on 4 April 1915, losing to Platense by 5–1. The first match won in the top division was the 7th fixture, when the team defeated Floresta by 3–1. San Lorenzo finished 12th at the end of the season, tied with Gimnasia y Esgrima de Buenos Aires. On 7 May 1916, the club inaugurated its first stadium (popularly known as &quot;Viejo Gasómetro&quot; during a match against Estudiantes de La Plata, which San Lorenzo won by 2–1. That same year, the team finished 7th in the Primera División championship. In subsequent tournaments the team did not wage good campaigns, finishing 12th and 13th. In 1919 the Argentine league split into two leagues, the official Asociación Argentina and dissident Asociación Amateur (AAm), in which San Lorenzo took part, along with Racing Club, River Plate and Independiente, among other teams. San Lorenzo finished 9th.

===The success begins===

In 1920 and 1922, San Lorenzo finished third, finally winning its first title in 1923. The squad won 17 of 20 games, only losing 2. San Lorenzo scored 34 goals in 20 fixtures, conceding 13. That same year the squad also won its first international title, The Copa Campeonato del Río de la Plata after beating Montevideo Wanderers 1–0 in the final.

San Lorenzo won its second consecutive Primera División title one year later. The team played 23 matches winning 18 with 2 losses, with a total of 48 goals scored and 15 conceded. In the following two seasons (1925 and 1926) San Lorenzo would make great performances finishing 2nd to Racing Club and Independiente respectively finally achieving its 3rd title in 1927, when both leagues AAF and AAm had joined again. The squad totaled 57 points in 33 matches played with an outstanding mark of 86 goals scored (2,60 per game) and conceding only 26.
Apart from winning the domestic league, in 1927 San Lorenzo won its first and only Copa Aldao, after defeating Uruguayan team (Rampla Juniors) by 1–0. The club soon became one of the most popular institutions in Argentina, increasing its number of followers and being counted in the top five (&quot;cinco grandes&quot;) together with Boca Juniors, Independiente, River Plate and Racing Club.
In the 1930s, Isidro Lángara and other players of Basque descent endeared San Lorenzo to the Basque community. The team also relied on players from the provinces, known as &quot;los gauchos&quot;. San Lorenzo returned to success in 1933, when the team won its 4th league championship. The squad totaled 50 points with 22 wins, 6 losses and 6 draws. San Lorenzo scored 81 goals and conceded 48. Boca Juniors was the runner-up while Racing Club finished 3rd.

In 1936, there were two championships within the year, in a format of single-robin tournaments. San Lorenzo won the first round (named &quot;Copa de Honor&quot; for the occasion) while River Plate won the second round (&quot;Copa Campeonato&quot;). Although titles were recognised as official by the Association, both champions, San Lorenzo and River Plate, had to play a match (named &quot;Copa de Oro&quot;) in order to define which team would play the Copa Aldao match v. the Uruguayan Primera División champion. Finally, River Plate won the game by 4–2 and qualified to play Peñarol.

===The 1940s: &quot;The best team in the world&quot;===

In 1943, San Lorenzo won the national cup, the Copa General Pedro Ramírez, named in honor of Pedro Pablo Ramírez, the &quot;de facto&quot; president of Argentina by then. San Lorenzo won the trophy by defeating General Paz Juniors 8–3.

After the 1936 success, San Lorenzo would not win a league title for ten years, when in 1946 proclaimed champion with a total of 46 points (the runner-up, Boca Juniors, finished 2nd. with 42). San Lorenzo also scored a record of 90 goals in 30 games played, only conceding 37.

That same year (1946), the team went on to a tour of Spain and Portugal that was one of the highlights of the club&#x27;s history. The team debuted playing Atlético Aviación winning 4–1. San Lorenzo played a total of 10 matches in Europe, with some extraordinary victories over the Spanish national team (7–5 and 6–1). The Spanish crowd at the stadium acclaimed San Lorenzo as &quot;Son els millor del mon&quot; (&quot;You are the best in the world&quot; in Catalan). San Lorenzo then moved to Portugal where the squad showed its skilled play, thrashing Porto (9–4) and the Portugal national team by 10–4. The only team that defeated San Lorenzo was Real Madrid by 4–1.

As a result of the successful tour, player René Pontoni was offered a contract with Barcelona, but declined to leave Argentina (Barcelona then drafted River Plate&#x27;s Alfredo Di Stéfano). Fellow player Rinaldo Martino did stay in European football and would later become a star with Juventus.

====European tour details====


===The 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s===
In the 1960s, a generation of players known as &quot;carasucias&quot; (literally: dirty faces) were the darling of Argentine fans because of their offensive, careless playing and their bad-boy antics off the pitch. The 1968 team was nicknamed &quot;los matadores&quot; as it won the championship without losing a single game. This team was recognized as the best team in the world by many journalists. In the years 1968–1974 San Lorenzo won four league titles, its best harvest ever. In 1972, the club became the first Argentine team to win two league titles in one year.

Poor administrations, however, led San Lorenzo to a huge economic crisis. Argentina&#x27;s military government coerced the club into selling the historic stadium located in Boedo. The team was relegated in 1981, only to return to the top division with great fanfare in the 1982 season, which set all-time attendance records for the club.

===The 1990s===
By that time, the club had no stadium and was plagued by debt and irregularities. Controversial president Fernando Miele (1986–2001) delivered both the new stadium and two league titles: the Clausura 1995 (after 21 years without winning a first division title) and the Clausura 2001 (in which the team achieved 11 consecutive victories). San Lorenzo finished the Clausura 2001 with 47 points in a tournament of 19 matches, setting the record for the highest points haul since the inception of the Apertura and Clausura system in 1990.

===The New Millennium===
In late 2001, San Lorenzo won their first international title: the Copa Mercosur 2001, becoming the only Argentine team to win that international cup, because the others champions were all from Brazil.

San Lorenzo also won the first edition of the Copa Sudamericana, the 2002 edition, beating Colombian club Atlético Nacional in the finals. This was their second international title, which gave them the opportunity to play the Recopa against the Copa Libertadores champion, Paraguayan club Olimpia. In the 2003 Recopa played in Los Angeles, United States, San Lorenzo lost to Olimpia 2–0 and finished runner-up.

In June 2007, San Lorenzo won the Clausura 2007 league title, beating Boca Juniors in the race for the title by 6 points, even though Boca had beaten them 7–1 in the Apertura 2006. Led by manager Ramón Díaz, San Lorenzo secured the title after the 17th round of fixtures, with two games still left. They finished the tournament with 45 points.
Six years later, and only one year after being relegation-threatened, the club managed to win their 15th league title, Torneo Inicial 2013.

In 2014, San Lorenzo won their first Copa Libertadores. They began their campaign by finishing second in its group. In the knockout stage, they beat Gremio on penalties, Cruzeiro, and Bolivar with a very one sided 5–1 aggregate victory in the semi-finals. In the finals, they defeated Nacional of Paraguay 2–1 on aggregate, concluding their championship run with a 1–0 victory in the second leg at Estadio Pedro Bidegain. This earned the club a berth in the 2014 FIFA Club World Cup in Morocco, their first trip to FIFA&#x27;s premier club tournament. They would ultimately lose in the finals to Real Madrid, and finish as runners-up.

==Stadium==

The Viejo Gasómetro stadium in what nowadays is known as Boedo was a venue of great renown, where many international games were held. During the military government in 1979 San Lorenzo was forced to sell the stadium for a small amount of money, and a few years later the supermarket chain Carrefour bought it. The price had mysteriously surged eightfold, but the Club did not get any extra money.

After 14 years of renting the stadium, San Lorenzo, with the help of fans, inaugurated the new stadium, Estadio Pedro Bidegain (nicknamed &quot;Nuevo Gasómetro&quot;), which opened in December 1993 at the intersection of the Perito Moreno and Varela avenues in the Bajo Flores neighborhood. The fans, however, never forgot the old stadium, and its former lot is claimed by San Lorenzo and its fans to this day. On 8 March 2012, there was a demonstration attended by over 100,000 people in favour of reclaiming the place for the club, and on 15 November the Buenos Aires City Legislature passed a bill stipulating that, in the course of six months, Carrefour should negotiate a deal with San Lorenzo in order to share the land lot, and if no accommodation was reached then the city would expropriate it with San Lorenzo&#x27;s funds. First, an extension was agreed to and one-and-a-half years later, it signed an agreement establishing that the multinational retailer will build a smaller new store on a corner of its current property, financed by funds provided by San Lorenzo. The rest of the lot will be handed over to the club, and there are plans to build another new stadium there.

The current stadium has a capacity of 47,964 and the pitch size is 110 x 70 m, among the biggest in Argentina.

==Nicknames==

*&quot;Los Gauchos de Boedo&quot; (Boedo&#x27;s Gauchos): In 1932, San Lorenzo brought players from different provinces from Argentina (principally from Santa Fe Province). Among them are, Alberto Chividini, Gabriel Magán y Genaro Cantelli.
* &quot;Los Santos&quot; (The Saints): The nickname emerged because the club used The San Antonio&#x27;s Oratory for soccer activities.
* &quot;Los Cuervos&quot; (The Crows): Was called so, because of the attire of the priests (black)
* &quot;El Ciclón&quot; (The Cyclone): San Lorenzo&#x27;s historical rival is Club Atlético Huracán, which means &quot;hurricane&quot;. The nickname is adopted since cyclones are stronger than hurricanes.
* &quot;Los Azulgrana&quot; (The Blue and Red): The color of the club (Blue and Red).
* &quot;Los Matadores&quot; (The Killers), originally used for the unbeaten 1968 champions.
* The fans&#x27; collective calls itself &quot;La Gloriosa&quot; (The Glorious).

<text>The Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE; , ADLE) is a transnational alliance between two European political parties, the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party and the European Democratic Party. ALDE has political groups in the European Parliament, the EU Committee of the Regions, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe and the NATO Parliamentary Assembly. There are assorted independents in these groups as well as national-level affiliate parties of the European-level parties.

The pro-European platform of ALDE espouses liberal economics, and support for European integration and the European single market.

==European Parliament==
==Committee of the Regions==
===Foundation===
Following the creation of the ALDE group in the European Parliament, which occurred half-way during the third mandate of the Committee of the Regions (CoR), the members of the ELDR Group in the CoR rapidly entered into talks with the CoR members belonging to the EDP Party with a view to replicating a similar arrangement within the CoR. Under the presidency of Kent Johansson, Executive Member of the Swedish Region of Västra Götaland, the ELDR Group of the Committee of the Regions unanimously agreed in February 2005 to change its name to the ALDE Group and to accept the EDP members to the group. In doing so, the group adopted a new mission statement (see below). The current president of the group is Bart Somers, Mayor of Mechelen and leader of the liberal group in the Flemish Parliament.

<doc id="783036" wikidata="Q3630434" url="?curid=783036" title="Autoconfig">
<text>Autoconfig is an auto-configuration protocol of Amiga computers which is intended to automatically assign resources to expansion devices without the need for jumper settings. It is analogous to PCI configuration through ACPI.

Autoconfig is integrated within the Amiga&#x27;s Kickstart firmware, usually stored in ROM.
When the system is switched on, AmigaOS interrogates each expansion device in turn and assigns address space or resources as needed. For example, in the case of a memory card, the OS can dynamically add the memory to the system. Through Autoconfig the OS can access firmware on expansion devices, for example, to boot from a disk connected to a hard disk controller.

== Protocol ==
Expansion devices respond to certain fixed memory addresses starting at hexadecimal (or for Zorro III) if the /CFGIN signal is asserted and the device is not already configured. The CPU reads nibbles of configuration information (usually supplied by a PAL) such as manufacturer ID, product ID, and the amount of address space the device requires. The CPU then writes a base memory address to the device (or tells it to &quot;shut up&quot; if for some reason it can&#x27;t be configured), and the device asserts /CFGOUT.

The /CFGIN of the first device is tied to ground. The second device&#x27;s /CFGIN is controlled by the first device&#x27;s /CFGOUT, and so on.

In a backplane design such as the Amiga 2000, connecting the /CFGOUT of one slot directly to the /CFGIN of the next would create the problem that an unoccupied slot would break the configuration chain. To solve this, the backplane ORs the /CFGIN and /CFGOUT signals to form the /CFGIN for the next slot (/CFGOUT is pulled low if undriven), which allows empty slots to be bypassed. This requires one 74LS32 (quad OR gate) on the Amiga 2000, which is the only motherboard hardware required by Autoconfig.

== Hardware specifications and bus connections ==
Autoconfig is part of the Zorro II and Zorro III expansion bus specification for configuring expansion devices in Amiga systems. Zorro II was first used in the Amiga 2000, though a similar expansion bus is present on the Amiga 1000. Zorro II is a relatively straightforward extension of the 68000 bus. Autoconfig requires the 68000 data and address bus to be available to all devices on the bus. In theory, a virtual address system, as used in PCI, would require a minor revision to Autoconfig.

The Amiga 2000 can accommodate five Zorro expansion cards, such as, RAM expansions, SCSI controllers and graphic cards. However the standard does not put a limit on the number of devices. In the A2000, two Zorro II slots are aligned with ISA slots. The Zorro bus and ISA bus can be connected by means of a &quot;bridgeboard&quot;, such as, the Janus Hardware Emulator, which allows emulation of Intel 80286 or 80386 systems.

Zorro III is the 32 bit auto-configuring expansion bus of Amiga 3000 and Amiga 4000 systems. From the A3000 design onwards, it was deemed desirable for all enumerable hardware expansions to use Autoconfig. It is OS-legal for non-Autoconfig hardware to be completely ignored and the standard was adopted in AmigaOS 3.1.

==Notation==
In early Commodore documents it was styled &quot;Auto Configuration&quot;, &quot;auto-config&quot; or &quot;AutoConfig&quot;, whereas in later documents it was styled &quot;AUTOCONFIG&quot;.

<text>Orpah ( &quot;ʿOrpā&quot;, meaning &quot;neck&quot; or &quot;fawn&quot;) is a woman mentioned in the Book of Ruth in the Hebrew Bible. She was from Moab and was the daughter-in-law of Naomi and wife of Chilion. After the death of her husband, Orpah and her sister-in-law Ruth wished
to go to Judea with Naomi. However, Naomi tried to persuade both Ruth and Orpah to return to their people and to their gods. Ruth chose to remain with Naomi, but Orpah chose to return to her people and her gods. (Ruth i. 4 et seq.).

== In rabbinicism ==
In rabbinic literature, the treatment of Orpah is almost entirely negative. Orpah is identified with Harapha, the mother of the four Philistine giants (2 Samuel 21:16), one of whom was Goliath. These four sons were said to have been given her for the four tears which she shed at parting with her mother-in-law (Babylonian Talmud, Sotah 42b). The name Harapha stems from the word for threshing; she allowed herself to be &quot;threshed&quot; by many men, as one would thresh wheat (Babylonian Talmud, Sotah 42b).

Tractate Sanhedrin in the Talmud says that David&#x27;s general, Abishai, the son of David&#x27;s sister Zeruiah, killed her with her own spindle.

== Namesakes ==
Orpah was the name originally given to Oprah Winfrey by her mother.

<text>St Mirren Football Club is a Scottish professional football club based in Paisley, Renfrewshire, that competes in the Scottish Premiership after winning the 2017–18 Scottish Championship. Founded in 1877, the team has two nicknames: &quot;The Buddies&quot; and &quot;The Saints&quot;.

St Mirren have won the Scottish Cup three times, in 1926, 1959 and 1987, and the Scottish League Cup in 2013. They have played in European competition five times: in the UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup in 1987–88, the UEFA Cup in 1980–81, 1983–84 and 1985–86 and the 2024–25 UEFA Conference League, which saw the club return to Europe for the first time in 37 years. They are the only Scottish team to win the Anglo-Scottish Cup, beating Bristol City 5–1 over two legs in 1979–80.

The club&#x27;s home ground since 2009 is St Mirren Park, an all-seater stadium on Greenhill Road, Paisley. It has a capacity of 7,937. The club&#x27;s former home from 1894 until 2009 was also officially named St Mirren Park, but was more commonly known as Love Street.

== History ==
St Mirren Football Club was originally a gentlemen&#x27;s club which was formed in the second half of the 19th century and played, among other sports, cricket and rugby. The increasing popularity of football ensured that by 1877 the members had decided to play association football and 1877 is the football club&#x27;s official foundation date. They are named after Saint Mirin, the founder of a church at the site of Paisley Abbey and Patron Saint of Paisley. There is also a street in Paisley named St Mirren Street. The team&#x27;s first strip was scarlet and blue but, after one season, the club changed to the current black and white striped shirts, which have been worn every season bar one in the 1900s, when cream tops were used.
St Mirren played their first match on 6 October 1877, defeating Johnstone Britannia 1–0 at Shortroods. Two years later, the club moved to another ground named Thistle Park at Greenhills. St Mirren&#x27;s first Scottish Cup match was on 4 September 1880, a 3–0 victory over Johnstone Athletic. The following year, St Mirren reached their first cup final but were beaten 3–1 by Thornliebank in the Renfrewshire Cup. In 1883, the scores were reversed with St Mirren winning the Renfrewshire Cup, 3–1 against Thornliebank. It was in 1883 that the club moved to its third home, that of West March (early maps indicate the area as West March rather than the commonly used Westmarch), defeating Queen&#x27;s Park in the first game there. In 1885, St Mirren played their first match against Morton, resulting in a defeat.

The 1890 season was a historic season for St Mirren, as they became founder members of the Scottish Football League along with fellow Paisley club Abercorn. Of the eleven founder clubs, only five survive in the current league system. It was during the match against Morton at Cappielow in 1890 that St Mirren played one of the first night games under light from oil lamps. The club moved to Love Street in 1894 and the team reached their first Scottish Cup final in the 1907–08 season but were defeated 5–1 by Celtic. St Mirren went on to lift the trophy in 1926, 1959 and 1987.
In 1922, St Mirren were invited to play in the Barcelona Cup invitational tournament to celebrate the inauguration of Les Corts, the then home of Barcelona. They won the tournament by beating Notts County in the final.

In the 1979–80 season, St Mirren achieved their equal highest-ever finish in the top-flight finishing third behind Aberdeen and Celtic. That season Saints also became the first and last Scottish club to win the Anglo-Scottish Cup, defeating Bristol City in a two-legged final. The following season, St Mirren competed in European competition for the first time and won their initial game 2–1 vs. IF Elfsborg in Sweden, followed by a 0–0 draw in the second leg. The next round saw them play French team Saint-Étienne. Although St Mirren&#x27;s home leg ended up a 0–0 draw, Saint-Étienne pulled off a 2–0 victory in the second leg to put St Mirren out of the cup.

The club have been relegated from the Scottish Premier League twice (2000–01) and (2014–15) and the Premier Division of the Scottish Football League once (1991–92) having escaped relegation from the latter in 1991 after league re-construction. In 2001, St Mirren finished bottom of the Premier League despite losing only one of their final seven matches. The Saints however managed promotion after clinching the First Division title in 2005–06, a season which also saw St Mirren win the Scottish Challenge Cup, defeating Hamilton Academical 2–1 in the final at Airdrie United&#x27;s ground, the Shyberry Excelsior Stadium, with goals from Simon Lappin and John Sutton.

In 2010, they reached the final of the Scottish League Cup where they were defeated 0–1 by Rangers despite having a two-man advantage. However, three days later, they recorded a famous win over Celtic, a match that &quot;The Buddies&quot; won 4–0 with doubles from Andy Dorman and Steven Thomson. In March 2013, St Mirren won the Scottish League Cup beating Heart of Midlothian 3–2 at Hampden to win their first cup since 1987.

In the 2010s the club drew praise for their youth development, bringing through several players from their academy (despite it not being listed among the &#x27;elite&#x27; group assessed by the SFA in 2017) including Stevie Mallan, Jack Baird, Kyle Magennis, Jason Naismith, Kyle McAllister, Sean Kelly and full Scotland internationals Kenny McLean, Lewis Morgan and John McGinn.

== Stadium ==

St Mirren played at four different venues before moving to their ground at St Mirren Park, or Love Street, in 1894. The record attendance for the ground was 47,438 versus Celtic in 1949. Love Street saw extensive redevelopment in the late 90s to comply with both the recommendations of the Taylor Report and SPL regulations and the ground eventually became a 10,866 seater venue. The ground had four stands of which the most recent, the West or Reid Kerr Family Stand, was built in 2000 in order for Love Street to meet the criteria for entry to the Scottish Premier League. The oldest stand was the main stand which had a basic wooden construction. The north bank was popular with the hardcore St Mirren fans while the largest stand, the steeply raked West Stand, housed a sporting facility underneath.

On 24 May 2005, Renfrewshire Council granted permission for the club to develop their old ground. This involved the sale of the ground to a supermarket chain, and the construction of a ground in Ferguslie Park, Paisley (through a separate planning permission). The sale of their old ground allowed the club to finance the new stadium as well as clear their debts. In April 2007 it was announced that a deal had been struck with supermarket giant Tesco and on 15 January 2009 St Mirren moved to a new 8,000-seat stadium, also called St Mirren Park.

The opening game finished as a 1–1 draw with Kilmarnock, with Killie&#x27;s Kevin Kyle scoring the first goal, and Dennis Wyness equalising. St Mirren&#x27;s first notable win at the new stadium came on 7 March 2009 in a 1–0 victory over Celtic in the Homecoming Scottish Cup Quarter Final.

The stadium had a total seating capacity of 8,023 which was reduced in 2017 to 7,937 following the installation of a new disabled access platform.

The stadium was known as The Simple Digital Arena after the club agreed a four-year, six-figure deal with Simple Digital Solutions on 13 June 2018.

It is currently known as The SMiSA Stadium.

== Colours and sponsors ==
The traditional home colours of St Mirren are black and white stripes, however for the first season the colours were scarlet and blue. There is some dispute as to why the colours black and white were chosen. A popular theory is that the stripes represent the Black and White Cart rivers which run through Paisley. In recent years there has been evidence unearthed that the Monks in the local abbey wore black and white striped habits. The team strips have varied very little in the long history of the club, however the thickness of the stripes have often varied. Some years have seen horizontal stripes used.

Having first played in black and white vertical stripes in 1884, Saints were the first club in the world to do so, six years before Notts County.

Away tops are traditionally red or all black, but in some cases strips have varied from orange to light blue, as seen on the 2010–11 strip. From 2007 to 2011, the Danish firm, Hummel International, replaced Xara as kit manufacturers. After spells with Carbrini (2011–2012, 2015–2017), Diadora (2012–2014) and Joma (2017–2023) the club signed a deal with kit manufacturers Macron.
St Mirren has had several main sponsors, mainly in the transport industry, with several local bus companies and car dealerships like Arriva and Phoenix Honda sponsoring in the club. St Mirren were sponsored by Braehead Shopping Centre, a local shopping centre four miles away in Renfrew from 2005 to 2017. They are currently sponsored by Consilium Contracting Services.
In August 2010, the club confirmed Barrhead company Compass Private Hire would have their name displayed on the back of the first team players&#x27; shirts as well as on their shorts. Compass Private Hire were co-owned by former St Mirren player, captain and manager, Tony Fitzpatrick.



== Mascots ==
In recent years, St Mirren have been represented by three mascots, the Pandas. They are Paisley Panda, Junior P and Mrs Panda. The regular mascots are Paisley Panda and Junior P.

== Rivalries ==

The club has a fierce rivalry with neighbours Greenock Morton, a rivalry which sees a large amount of animosity between the two sets of fans.

== Other sports ==
Robert Mitchell of St Mirren F.C. won the Scottish 880 yards title five times between 1889 and 1894, missing only in 1893, and shares with Duncan McPhee (West of Scotland H., 1914 to 1923) the most wins in this event in Scottish AAA history. He also set Scottish records at two distances. At the St Mirren FC Sports, at West March, Paisley, on 19 July 1890 he ran 2:00 2/5 to establish a new Scottish All-comers record for 880 yards, beating a record set by Thomas Moffat at the Scottish championships in 1883. And at the Rangers Sports at Ibrox Park, Glasgow, on 3 August 1889 he ran 1:15 3/5 to establish new Scottish All-comers and Native records for 600 yards. In 1898 he was permanently suspended from amateur athletics for collaborating with betting on races.

<text>Mäntsälä () is a municipality in the province of Southern Finland, and is part of the Uusimaa region. It has a population of 
() and covers an area of of
which 
is water. The population density is
. The municipality is unilingually Finnish. Mäntsälä is one of three municipalities in the Uusimaa region that do not have a Swedish name; the others are Nurmijärvi and Askola.

Mäntsälä lies about north of Helsinki, the capital of Finland. During the last few years, the population of Mäntsälä has been one of the most rapidly increasing in Finland. A new railway, the Kerava–Lahti railway line, was built between Kerava and Lahti with passenger traffic starting on 4 September 2006 from Mäntsälä railway station. Helsinki is about 40 minutes away, and Lahti even closer. Highway 4 (E75) connecting both cities passes through Mäntsälä.

The coat of arms of Mäntsälä has its theme in the region&#x27;s traditional livelihoods; the head of the moose refers to the hunting lands of the region, and the clovers symbolizes local agriculture. The coat of arms was designed by Olof Eriksson and approved by the Mäntsälä Municipal Council on 16 December 1950. The coat of arms was officially approved by the Ministry of the Interior on 20 February 1951.

==History==
Mäntsälä is considered to have been founded in 1585, when the community&#x27;s first church was built. The current church was completed in 1866 after delay. The Crimean War affected also Mäntsälä: funds for building the church were spent on war efforts. All of the churches were located on Kirkonmäki (&quot;Church Hill&quot;) at about the same spot.

The first common school was founded in 1870 by way of a testament of clergyman Abraham Ehnroos. To his credit is the founding of a public library already in 1840. An intermediate school was not founded until 1945 with a high school following in 1954, previously facilities in Porvoo, Järvenpää and Helsinki were used.
In 1854 the first town hall was built on Kirkonmäki. Today a museum is operating in the building, having also served as a morgue, school kitchen and lesson space, and a dormitory. It is deteriorating severely and the museum is only opened upon request.

The second town hall was built in 1935, also on Kirkonmäki. It served until the completion of the present town hall in 1992. Now it houses an open college.

There is a total of 15 manors in Mäntsälä, 4 of which are open to the public, the rest being private residences. Russian czar Alexander I visited as guest of Ulla Möllersvärd in 1809 in the Mäntsälä manor lying in the town center. The manors emerged in the 17th century as noblemen feoffs. Traditionally the land belonged to the manors. There were many crofts in Mäntsälä and new legislation in 1918 enabled the crofters to claim the land for themselves. In the 1920s the manors were still a sizable land owner in the parish.

Mäntsälä is especially known for the Mäntsälä rebellion. About 400 civil guards went shooting to a Social Democratic party rally at Ohkola community hall, interrupting it. In the course of a few days leaders of Lapua Movement and armed civil guards from all over the country arrived to Mäntsälä. The government ordered them arrested, and after a speech by president Svinhufvud on 2 March the situation gradually settled down. The movement disbanded early in spring.

World War II brought about 2000 refugees evacuated from Karelia to Mäntsälä. They came mainly from Kirvu and Koivisto. Land was cut from the manors again for the arrivals, reducing manor estate considerably. In 1985 a museum about the Kirvu parish was opened next to the church in the city center.

In 1992 an apartment trade fair was held in Mäntsälä. The area is being expanded and since 2006, a train depot lies next to it.

A discount chain Tokmanni&#x27;s head office, logistics center and warehouse, founded in 1989, are in Mäntsälä. Also, Yandex built one of its data centers in Mäntsälä in 2015, with a second data center expected to be built in 2020 by Lehto.

==Demographics==
The population of Mäntsälä has stayed quite level for decades, but the building of a motorway up to Järvenpää in the 1970s and the extension to Lahti in 1999 have brought new residents from the metropolitan area. By the middle of the 2000s the new railroad to Lahti has been central in municipality population growth. Many people moved to Mäntsälä because of the railroad, that offered quick commuting to Helsinki.

<doc id="783106" wikidata="Q6954197" url="?curid=783106" title="NHS trust">
<text>An NHS trust is an organisational unit within the National Health Services of England and Wales, generally serving either a geographical area or a specialised function (such as an ambulance service). In any particular location there may be several trusts involved in the different aspects of providing healthcare to the local population. , there were altogether 217 trusts, and they employ around 800,000 of the NHS&#x27;s 1.2 million staff.

==History==
NHS trusts were established under the National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990 and were set up in five waves. Each one was established by a statutory instrument.

NHS trusts are not trusts in the legal sense but are in effect public sector corporations. Each trust is headed by a board consisting of executive and non-executive directors, and is chaired by a non-executive director. There were about 2,200 non-executives across 470 organisations in the NHS in England in 2015. Non-executive directors are recruited by open advertisement. All trusts (foundation trusts and those which have yet to reach foundation trust status) are regulated by NHS England and the Care Quality Commission. Board members are, from November 2014, subject to a fit and proper person test.

All trust boards are required to have an audit committee consisting only of non-executive directors, on which the chair may not sit. This committee is entrusted not only with the supervision of financial audit, but of systems of corporate governance within the trust. Hospital board members have a duty to act on signals of poor performance on quality and safety data, and yet many of the papers presented to them have been found to be lacking good data visualisations.

The High Court of Justice decided in December 2019 that NHS trusts were not charities for the purposes of the Local Government Finance Act 1988, so they have to pay business rates at the full rate.

A study by the University of Exeter in 2020 found that in 70 out of the 213 trusts all the board members were white. Overall BAME representation at board level was 8.9%. Medical directors of BAME ethnicity accounted for 19.4%, about the same as the overall percentage of BAME doctors. 

==Future development==
In September 2015 Jeremy Hunt was reported as saying &quot;I think we do have too many trusts as independent organisations&quot; in a context where mergers between trusts and the establishment of chains of hospitals were being discussed. Subsequently Simon Stevens made it clear that he did not expect the remaining NHS trusts to become foundation trusts, saying &quot;We are frankly kidding ourselves if we think the non-FTs are going to pass the kinds of criteria that have been set by Monitor.&quot;

==Types==
There are several types of NHS trusts:

*Hospital trust (also known as an acute trust), which provides secondary care services
*Mental health trust
*Ambulance services trust
*Community health trust

Over time the distinction between different types has eroded, and both hospital and mental health trusts have taken on responsibility for various community services. Sustainability and transformation plans all propose to move services out of hospitals into the community and the hospital trusts are generally planning to follow these initiatives.

===Foundation trusts===

Foundation trust status may be applied for by the above categories of NHS trust. Successive governments have announced that all NHS trusts should become foundation trusts, and deadlines have been set for this transformation, which have repeatedly been missed.

===Former types===

*Primary care trust (PCT) (abolished 1 April 2013), which provided primary care services, public health functions and commissioned secondary care services
*Care trust (abolished 1 April 2013), provided/commissioned health and social care services, usually with responsibilities of both a PCT and a local authority

==Other types of NHS organisation==
Several special health authorities, organised on a national basis, deal with NHS-wide issues. An example is NHS Blood and Transplant.

The summer houses or cottages located in the countryside are part of the culture of Finland where most Finnish families spend their summer holidays. Mäntyharju is the municipality which has the fifth most summer houses in Finland.

The municipality also has a direct, high-speed train connection to the capital area. Because of the many summer houses, the population of Mäntyharju more than triples during the most popular summer holiday times. Art Centre Salmela in Mäntyharju hosts one of Finland&#x27;s largest cultural events in July–August.

;Notes:
== History ==
The modern Mäntyharju municipality is on the border between the historical Tavastia, Savonia and Karelia regions. The parish of Mäntyharju was formed in 1595 out of Iitti, Sysmä, Pellosniemi (see Mikkeli, Mikkelin maalaiskunta) and Taipalsaari. Before that, there was already a chapel in the village of Kyttälä, at the time part of Iitti.

After the Treaty of Turku in 1743, western Mäntyharju remained Swedish while the eastern part, including the church, was ceded to Russia. The parts were reunited in 1821, when Old Finland was added to the Grand Duchy. Pertunmaa became a separate parish in May 20th of 1924 and a municipality in 1926, also including smaller parts of Hartola and Joutsa.

<doc id="783118" wikidata="Q503862" url="?curid=783118" title="Naantali">
<text>Naantali (; ) is a town in Southwest Finland, and, as a resort town during the summer, an important centre of tourism in the country. The municipality has a population of 
(), and is located west of Turku.

The town has a land area of . Most of this area is located on the islands, but the majority of the population lives on the mainland. Most of the islands are covered with forest and farmland, while the mainland consists chiefly of residential areas.

== History ==
One of the oldest towns in Finland, Naantali was founded around the medieval Brigittine convent &quot;Vallis gratiae&quot; (or Nådendal Abbey), the church of which still dominates its skyline. The charter was signed by King Christopher of Bavaria, the then ruler of Finland, in 1443. The convent got trading rights and other privileges, and the town around it began to grow. It also became an important destination for pilgrimage.

In the 16th century, as Catholicism gave way to Protestantism as the official religion of Sweden (which Finland was part of at the time), the convent was closed, and the town plunged into a depression. This lasted until the mid-18th century, when the town got a tollgate and a customs chamber. In the two centuries of economic stagnation before that the town had become famous for its knitted stockings, a craft carried on from the times of the convent.

The year 1863 saw the founding of the spa at Cape Kalevanniemi, which raised the town&#x27;s status as a holiday venue. In 1922, the Kultaranta estate on Luonnonmaa was made the official summer residence for the President of the Republic, after Finland had gained its independence five years earlier.

The municipalities of Merimasku, Rymättylä and Velkua were consolidated with Naantali on January 1, 2009.

The per capita tax income of the town is the second highest of all towns in Finland, and the highest in the province of Southwest Finland.

==Name==
The name &quot;Naantali&quot; is the fennicised version of the Swedish name of the town, . The Swedish name was given as a direct translation from the Latin &quot;Vallis Gratiae&quot; which literally means &quot;The Valley of Grace&quot;.

== Tourism and points of interest ==
The proximity of both Turku, the region&#x27;s administrative centre and largest city, and of the archipelago both contribute to the area&#x27;s popularity with tourists.

Other points of interest in the city include Moomin World, a theme park on the island of Kailo, and Naantali’s medieval convent stone church. The area also includes the official summer residence of the President of Finland, the Kultaranta estate which is located on Luonnonmaa.

The Archipelago Sea boat traffic is handled by S/S Ukkopekka. Old steamship cruise Naantali-Turku-Naantali.

Naantali hosts an international music festival every June, and the traditional Sleepyhead Day carnival in July.

== Culture ==
Every July 27, Naantali celebrates the National Sleepy Head Day (; ). The old tradition is to throw a chosen &quot;sleepy head&quot;, an usually Finnish celebrity, in the sea from the city&#x27;s port at 8 a.m. The identity of the sleeper is kept secret until the event. People who are chosen have usually done something to the benefit of the city.

== Other industries ==
In addition to tourism, the city&#x27;s main industries are electricity production, oil refining, manufacturing, and services. The Port of Naantali is the third largest in Finland in terms of goods traffic, and the city is home to a power plant and an oil refinery owned by the government-controlled company Fortum and Neste.

<doc id="783124" wikidata="Q369576" url="?curid=783124" title="Nastola">
<text>Nastola is a former municipality of Finland. It was merged with the city of Lahti on 1 January 2016.

In the province of Southern Finland, Nastola is part of the Päijät-Häme region. The municipality had a population of (30 June 2015) and covered an area of of which was water. The population density was . Nastola is located between two major cities: Lahti and Kouvola. Kausala, the administrative center of Iitti, is away from Nastola in the direction of Kouvola.

The municipality was unilingually Finnish.

== History ==
Ornamental items, presumed to date back to the 1200s, have been found in the village of Ruuhijärvi. Although the items are of Karelian design, scholars agree that they are not necessarily indicative of Karelian settlement in Nastola. Additionally, English, German and Scandinavian coins have been found in Immilä. Etymologic research indicates that the earliest settlers in Nastola originated from contemporary Asikkala and Hollola, in addition to the surroundings of lake Vanajavesi; indeed, Ruuhijärvi, then covering most of what is now known as Nastola, became one of the quarters of the administrative parish of Asikkala in the 1500s.

The name of Nastola may be of Karelian origin, referring to a Karelian male name &quot;Nasto&quot; (folk form of Anastasios). The first administrative center over the area was Uusikylä (), which was also the name of an administrative unit within the Hollola and later the Asikkala parish in the 15th century. The first church in the area was built in the village of Nastola (first mentioned in 1478), which gave its name to the chapel community and the later parish. Nastola became an independent parish in 1860.

Nastola was consolidated with Lahti in 2016.

== Geography ==

Nastola is wedged between the first and second Salpausselkäs, the former being a prominent feature in the terrain and landscape of the southern part of the municipality. In the west, it splits in two distinct ridges around the village of Villähde, and reaches it highest point in the parish village at above sea level. Moving further east towards Iitti, the ridge becomes narrower and its ridgelines steepen in the surroundings of Uusikylä. The area between the Salpausselkäs is characterized by its eskers and valleys. The esker of Vahteristonmäki, reaching past lake Kymijärvi further north into Heinola, peaks at above sea level in Nastola.

Till is the dominant type of soil in central and northern Nastola, with clay deposits mostly being concentrated to the south of the first Salpausselkä, as well as around the lakes of Ruuhijärvi, Sylvöjärvi and Oksjärvi. The till areas are dotted with bedrock protrusions, such as the high Ukonvuori hill in the east. The rocks on the south side of the Salpausselkäs tend to be lower and more rounded, and the majority of the bedrock consists of granite. All of the lakes of Nastola, which are also all part of the Kymijärvi drainage basin, are situated to the north of the first Salpausselkä; to its south are several smaller streams of water.

<doc id="783127" wikidata="Q203512" url="?curid=783127" title="Nagu">
<text>Nagu (; ) is a former municipality and parish of Finland. On 1 January 2009, it was consolidated with Houtskär, Iniö, Korpo and Pargas to form the new town of Väståboland. On 1 January 2012 the name Väståboland was changed to Pargas.

Nagu consists of two main islands (Lillandet and Storlandet) and 1500–3000 smaller islands and skerries located south of Turku in the province of Western Finland in the region of Southwest Finland. The Nagu archipelago is part of the world&#x27;s largest brackish water archipelago with 100 000 islands, islets and skerries in Sweden, Finland and Estonia. The total area of Nagu is 1 698,44 km2, of which the land area is only , or less than 15%.

Nagu has a population of approximately 1 400 persons, but during the summer over 10 000 more reside in the area.

Most of the islands belonging to the Nagu archipelago can be reached by a network of roads, bridges and cost-free connection boats covering the vast archipelago area and reaching also the most remote islands in the south, where Nagu shares borders with the international waters of the Baltic sea.

== Population ==

Nagu has a population of approximately 1 400 inhabitants (1 428 as of 31 December 2008 ). 
Nagu is bilingual, with the majority (71%) being Swedish and the minority Finnish speakers.

The number of other minority languages is large with approximately 20 nationalities residing in Nagu. In 2015 a temporary refugee centre for asylum seeking families from Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria and Somalia was opened in Nagu by the Red Cross. The story of the successful integration of refugees in Nagu, also known as the ”Nagu model”, made it into international news when photographer Giles Duley visited Nagu during the winter of 2015–2016 as part of a series of photo articles for the UNHCR. Mr. Duley&#x27;s visit was covered by the Guardian among other media. Out of the circa 120 persons staying that first winter in the premises of Hotel Strandbo, a couple of families have chosen to stay in Nagu after receiving residential permits. Through the addition of two Syrian refugee families receiving homes in Nagu in 2018 the Arabic language probably now holds third place among mother tongues spoken in Nagu.

=== Dialect ===
The Nagu dialect is a typical dialect of Finland Swedish. 

A sample of the dialect recorded in 1958 by (see file for transcription) 

== Services ==

Nagu is among the biggest service and tourism centres of the archipelago region. All across the Nagu archipelago there are several leisure boat harbours, the biggest of which is situated in the centre of Nagu, a village called Kyrkbacken (Swedish for ’Church hill’). Besides the harbour and the 15th century church of Nagu the village offers two grocery stores, two banks, gas stations for both cars and boats, a post office, several daily coach connections in both directions (to Turku and Houtskär), several hotels and a large number of restaurants and souvenir shops. The souvenir shops and some of the restaurants are open during summer only.

=== Churches and chapels in Nagu ===

The Nagu church, a medieval stone church from the middle of the 15th century, stands in the middle of the village Kyrkbacken (Eng: Church hill), the centre of Nagu. The Schwan organ from 1791 is the oldest organ in Finland still in use, that still mostly consists of original parts and sounds like it did in the 18th century.

The Nötö church, the Abraham chapel, was inaugurated on the 2nd of July in 1757. Before this there has been two previous chapels on the island. The Nötö church was decorated by Gustaf Lucander, whose altar piece still fills the wall around the altar window. Lucander also painted the apostles along the gallery. His self portrait can also be found in the church.

The Själö church was built in 1733. One part of the church hall is still enclosed by a barrier. This used to be where the lepers of Själö sat during service.

=== Kyrkbacken - the centre of Nagu ===

The Maritime House offers exhibitions about the naval history of Nagu from the early 19th century til&#x27; today. .

The Nagu-nalle Teddy&#x27;s walk in the woods closest to the centre of Nagu is a popular walk among families with small children. The trail features the characters from the books about the Nagu-nalle Teddy, by Henrika Andersson.

The Westerholm trail is a 3 km long walk that starts from the market place in the South harbour in the centre and goes through the woods of nearby Ernholm. The Westerholm trail is not a traditional nature trail, but more of a cultural trail, telling its hikers about Victor Westerholm, a Finnish landscape artist, who spent part of his childhood on the island of Ernholm.

The Nagu harbour marina has been popular among sailors since the 1980. It was named &quot;Harbour of the year&quot; in 1984, but has since been improved and enlarged continuously. Besides jetties, harbour office, saunas, laundry facilities and a gas station for boats the harbour also offers restaurants and small shops.

The labyrinth in Finby is a Troy Town labyrinth located on a walking distance from the centre (approx. 2 km). Follow the road Parkvägen west from the marina, past the sports and football fields and continue west on Norrstandsvägen. There are signs by the road marking the beginning of the track leading into the forest and up the labyrinth hill.

The island of Själö is not a part of the centre, but it can be visited on foot from the centre by those who take the connection boat (only during high-season, subject to a charge) or the (outside the summer season, free of charge) from the harbour.

=== The rest of Nagu ===
The Estonia memorial in Pärnäs was erected in memory of the 852 deceased in the M/S Estonia disaster on the 28 of September 1994. A track leads to the memorial from the ferry harbour in Pärnäs.

The Fagerlund traktor museum is a privately owned museum in Tackork, about 10 km from the centre towards Korpo. The museum shows around 30 veteran tractors that have been completely restored.

The Kasberget hill in Prostvik is the highest hill (62 m. above sea level) in Nagus. A 4,4 km long trail leads to the hill from the Parola area, situated right by the main road. The hill offers a nice view over the northern parts of Nagu.

The Smörasken hill (Eng: the butter box hill) is a hill on the island of Högsar with a large glacial erratic resting on the top. Smörasken offers a nice view to the south.

The Vargberget hill in Mattnäs has a turret with a view over the southern parts of the island Storlandet. It is situated at the end of a 2,4 km long trail starting from Petsorvägen.

Nötö is an island community in the south of Nagu. During the summer Nötö offers a small marina, a store, a bed &amp; breakfast and a café. Among places to visit there are the Nötö church (mentioned above) and nature trails leading the visitors to the &quot;singing rock&quot; and prehistoric grave sites.

Brännskär is a small island south of Kirjais with a marina, a café and rental cottages.

== Connections ==

The main islands and the islands closest to them can be reached by car thanks to roads, bridges and smaller ferries. Cost-free connection boats go to the small islands further off the main islands. The main ports of the connection boats are the centre of Nagu, the harbour at the eastern sided of the island of Kirjais and the harbour at Pärnäs in the western part of the main island of Storlandet.

The centre of Nagu, Kyrkbacken, is a hub when it comes to transport and travelling in the archipelago. The Archipelago Road, the main road connecting the Turku area with Pargas and the rest of the islands in this part of the archipelago crosses the main islands and the centre of Nagu on its way to Korpo and Houtskär and from Korpo onwards to the Åland islands. Apart from stretching over a large number of bridges the Archipelago Road includes several ferry passages. To get to Nagu from Turku you need to cross one ferry, taking you from the islands of Pargas to the Nagu main islands. The ferry ride is free of charge and it takes approximately 8 min to cross. The Pargas–Nagu ferry crosses 2–4 times per hour in each direction during the day and around once an hour during the night.

There are several daily coach connections by the Archipelago Bus between Turku and Nagu. The Archipelago Bus operates year-round.

The Archipelago Trails

During the summer season two scenic tourist routes that can be travelled by car, bus, motorcycle or bike open in the region. Both of these so-called trails connect Turku with the archipelago area and both of them go through the centre of Nagu. Each trail includes one ferry passage that is not free of charge. The Archipelago Trail covers a big part of the Turku area archipelago, while the Small Archipelago Trail makes a short cut over the island of Själö in Nagu. Besides the centre of Nagu itself, the beautiful small island of Själö, with its tragic and touching history as a disclosed island for lepers and the mentally ill, has grown into the main touristic site of Nagu. The ferry from the central harbour of Nagu to Själö takes 20 minutes.

St Olav Waterway

Nagu is situated by the St Olav Waterway route, a part of the Scandinavian St Olav pilgrimage trails that end in Trondheim, Norway. St Olav Waterway is the first route in Finland to have been accepted as a Cultural Route of the European Council (from 6.12.2018) and it is most probably the world&#x27;s first water based pilgrimage route (another was under process in Northern Portugal as a part of el Camino to Santiago de Compostela in 2017). All the water-based transportation that Nagu has to offer: kayaking, yachting, motor boating and island hopping can be implemented into a trip along the St Olav Waterway – besides walking across the islands.

<text>A Table Alphabeticall is the abbreviated title of the first monolingual dictionary in the English language, created by Robert Cawdrey and first published in London in 1604.

Although the work is important in being the first collection of its kind, it is not a large work. At only 120 pages, it listed a total of 2,543 words accompanied by very brief (often single-word) definitions. In most cases, it was little more than a list of synonyms. The words chosen by Cawdrey might seem arbitrary and obscure, yet the purpose was for understanding uncommon words which were circulating due to the advent of the printing press, and the English language Bible.

The dictionary&#x27;s claimed purpose was &quot;for the benefit and help of unskillful persons&quot;. Within a few decades, many other English dictionaries followed.

==Details==
The full title of &quot;A Table Alphabeticall&quot; is &quot;A Table Alphabeticall, containing and teaching the true writing, and vnderſtanding(understanding) of hard uſuall(usual) Engliſh(English) words, borrowed from the Hebrew, Greek, Latin, and French, &amp;c. With the interpretation thereof by plain writing acts and Engliſh(English) words, gathered for the benefit and help of ladies, gentlewomen, or any other vnskilfull(unskillful) persons. Whereby that they may speak more eaſily easily and fluently, have a better vnderſtand (understanding) many hard Engliſh(English) words, vvhich(which) they ſhall(shall) hear or read in Scripture, Sermons, or elſe(else) vvhere,(where) and alſo(also) be made able to vſe(use) at the same aptitude themſelues.(themselves)&quot;

Transliterated into modern English, the title becomes &quot;A table [in] alphabetical [order], containing and teaching the true writing, and understanding of hard usual English words, borrowed from the Hebrew, Greek, Latin, or French, etc [languages]. With the interpretation thereof by plain English words, gathered for the benefit and help of ladies, gentlewomen, or any other unskillful persons. Whereby they may the more easily and better understand many hard English words, which they shall hear or read in scriptures, sermons, or elsewhere, and also be made able to use the same aptly themselves.&quot;

&quot;A Table Alphabeticall&quot; was published in London. The 1604 edition was printed by &quot;I. R.&quot; (I. Roberts) for Edmund Weaver (listed as &quot;Edmund Weauer&quot;). The books are marked with a note that they &quot;are to be sold at his shop at the great North dore of Paules Church, 1604&quot;.

&quot;A Table Alphabeticall&quot; proved fairly popular. There was a second edition in 1609, a third edition in 1613, and a fourth edition in 1617. The second and third editions were printed by &quot;T. S.&quot; in London for Edmund Weaver. The third edition was &quot;Set forth by R.C. and newly corrected, and much inlarged with many words now in use&quot; and includes the inscription &quot;Legere, et non intelligere, neglegere est&quot; (&quot;To read, and to not understand, is to neglect&quot;).

As before, these newer editions were &quot;to be sold at his shop at the great North doore of Paules Church.&quot;

The first edition listed 2,543 headwords. The dictionary increased in size with every succeeding edition, until the fourth edition in 1617 defined 3,264 words. The only surviving copy is found at the Bodleian Library in Oxford.

The editors of the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) reference Cawdrey&#x27;s Table Alphabeticall, but not by name, in the first paragraph of the Historical Introduction. &quot;To set Cawdrey&#x27;s slim small volume of 1604 beside the completed Oxford Dictionary of 1933 is like placing the original acorn beside the oak that has grown out of it.&quot;

<doc id="783135" wikidata="Q644147" url="?curid=783135" title="IEEE 802.11i-2004">
<text>IEEE 802.11i-2004, or 802.11i for short, is an amendment to the original IEEE 802.11, implemented as Wi-Fi Protected Access II (WPA2). The draft standard was ratified on 24 June 2004. This standard specifies security mechanisms for wireless networks, replacing the short &quot;Authentication and privacy&quot; clause of the original standard with a detailed &quot;Security&quot; clause. In the process, the amendment deprecated broken Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP), while it was later incorporated into the published IEEE 802.11-2007 standard.

== Replacement of WEP ==
802.11i supersedes the previous security specification, Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP), which was shown to have security vulnerabilities. Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) had previously been introduced by the Wi-Fi Alliance as an intermediate solution to WEP insecurities. WPA implemented a subset of a draft of 802.11i. The Wi-Fi Alliance refers to their approved, interoperable implementation of the full 802.11i as WPA2, also called RSN (Robust Security Network). 802.11i makes use of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) block cipher, whereas WEP and WPA use the RC4 stream cipher.

== Protocol operation ==
IEEE 802.11i enhances IEEE 802.11-1999 by providing a Robust Security Network (RSN) with two new protocols: the four-way handshake and the group key handshake. These utilize the authentication services and port access control described in IEEE 802.1X to establish and change the appropriate cryptographic keys. The RSN is a security network that only allows the creation of robust security network associations (RSNAs), which are a type of association used by a pair of stations (STAs) if the procedure to establish authentication or association between them includes the 4-Way Handshake. 

The standard also provides two RSNA data confidentiality and integrity protocols, TKIP and CCMP, with implementation of CCMP being mandatory since the confidentiality and integrity mechanisms of TKIP are not as robust as those of CCMP. The main purpose to implement TKIP was that the algorithm should be implementable within the capabilities of most of the old devices supporting only WEP.

The initial authentication process is carried out either using a pre-shared key (PSK), or following an EAP exchange through 802.1X (known as EAPOL, which requires the presence of an authentication server). This process ensures that the client station (STA) is authenticated with the access point (AP). After the PSK or 802.1X authentication, a shared secret key is generated, called the Pairwise Master Key (PMK). In PSK authentication, the PMK is actually the PSK, which is typically derived from the WiFi password by putting it through a key derivation function that uses SHA-1 as the cryptographic hash function. If an 802.1X EAP exchange was carried out, the PMK is derived from the EAP parameters provided by the authentication server.

===Four-way handshake ===
The four-way handshake is designed so that the access point (or authenticator) and wireless client (or supplicant) can independently prove to each other that they know the PSK/PMK, without ever disclosing the key. Instead of disclosing the key, the access point (AP) and client encrypt messages to each other—that can only be decrypted by using the PMK that they already share—and if decryption of the messages was successful, this proves knowledge of the PMK. The four-way handshake is critical for protection of the PMK from malicious access points—for example, an attacker&#x27;s SSID impersonating a real access point—so that the client never has to tell the access point its PMK. 

The PMK is designed to last the entire session and should be exposed as little as possible; therefore, keys to encrypt the traffic need to be derived. A four-way handshake is used to establish another key called the Pairwise Transient Key (PTK). The PTK is generated by concatenating the following attributes: PMK, AP nonce (ANonce), STA nonce (SNonce), AP MAC address, and STA MAC address. The product is then put through a pseudo-random function. The handshake also yields the GTK (Group Temporal Key), used to decrypt multicast and broadcast traffic. 

The actual messages exchanged during the handshake are depicted in the figure and explained below (all messages are sent as EAPOL-Key frames):
# The AP sends a nonce-value (ANonce) to the STA together with a Key Replay Counter, which is a number that is used to match each pair of messages sent, and discard replayed messages. The STA now has all the attributes to construct the PTK. 
# The STA sends its own nonce-value (SNonce) to the AP together with a Message Integrity Code (MIC), including authentication, which is really a Message Authentication and Integrity Code (MAIC), and the Key Replay Counter which will be the same as Message 1, to allow AP to match the right Message 1.
# The AP verifies Message 2, by checking MIC, RSN, ANonce and Key Replay Counter Field, and if valid constructs and sends the GTK with another MIC.
# The STA verifies Message 3, by checking MIC and Key Replay Counter Field, and if valid sends a confirmation to the AP.

=== Group key handshake ===
The Group Temporal Key (GTK) used in the network may need to be updated due to the expiration of a preset timer. When a device leaves the network, the GTK also needs to be updated. This is to prevent the device from receiving any more multicast or broadcast messages from the AP.

To handle the updating, 802.11i defines a &quot;Group Key Handshake&quot; that consists of a two-way handshake:
# The AP sends the new GTK to each STA in the network. The GTK is encrypted using the KEK assigned to that STA, and protects the data from tampering, by use of a MIC.
# The STA acknowledges the new GTK and replies to the AP.

== CCMP overview ==
CCMP is based on the Counter with CBC-MAC (CCM) mode of the AES encryption algorithm. CCM combines CTR for confidentiality and CBC-MAC for authentication and integrity. CCM protects the integrity of both the MPDU Data field and selected portions of the IEEE 802.11 MPDU header.

== Key hierarchy ==
RSNA defines two key hierarchies:

# Pairwise key hierarchy, to protect unicast traffic
# GTK, a hierarchy consisting of a single key to protect multicast and broadcast traffic

The description of the key hierarchies uses the following two functions:

* L(Str, F, L) - From Str starting from the left, extract bits F through F+L–1.
* PRF-n - Pseudo-random function producing n bits of output, there are the 128, 192, 256, 384 and 512 versions, each of these output these number of bits.

The pairwise key hierarchy utilizes PRF-384 or PRF-512 to derive session-specific keys from a PMK, generating a PTK, which gets partitioned into a KCK and a KEK plus all the temporal keys used by the MAC to protect unicast communication.

The GTK shall be a random number which also gets generated by using PRF-n, usually PRF-128 or PRF-256, in this model, the group key hierarchy takes a GMK (Group Master Key) and generates a GTK.

== MAC frame formats ==

=== Frame Control field ===
=== Protected Frame field ===
&quot;The Protected Frame field is 1 bit in length. The Protected Frame field is set to 1 if the Frame Body field contains information that has been processed by a cryptographic encapsulation algorithm. The Protected Frame field is set to 1 only within data frames of type Data and within management frames of type Management, subtype Authentication. The Protected Frame field is set to 0 in all other frames. When the bit Protected Frame field is set to 1 in a data frame, the Frame Body field is protected utilizing the cryptographic encapsulation algorithm and expanded as defined in Clause 8. Only WEP is allowed as the cryptographic encapsulation algorithm for management frames of subtype Authentication.&quot;

<doc id="783138" wikidata="Q662485" url="?curid=783138" title="California State Route 24">
<text>State Route 24 (SR 24) is a heavily traveled east–west state highway in the U.S. state of California that serves the eastern side of the San Francisco Bay Area. A freeway throughout its entire length, it runs from the Interstate 580/Interstate 980 interchange (just east of the MacArthur Maze) in Oakland, and through the Caldecott Tunnel under the Berkeley Hills, to the Interstate 680 junction in Walnut Creek. It lies in Alameda County, where it is highly urban, and Contra Costa County, where it passes through wooded hillsides and suburbs. SR 24 is a major connection between the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge/MacArthur Maze complex and the inland cities of the East Bay.

==Route description==
SR 24 begins at the four-level stack interchange with Interstate 580 and Interstate 980 in Oakland; this interchange is located on top of Grove Shafter Park. SR 24 initially heads north before turning east near the Berkeley city limits. Route 24 rises from near sea level in downtown Oakland past its interchange with State Route 13, which is a freeway south of SR 24 (upgraded August 1999) and a surface street north of SR 24. After this, SR 24 crosses the Contra Costa County county line through the four-bore Caldecott Tunnel and offers some attractive views of the hilly terrain through which it passes. Some protection of the views comes from the highway&#x27;s designation as a California Scenic Highway.

On the other side of the tunnel, SR 24 travels through unincorporated Contra Costa County before entering Orinda. SR 24 crosses the Mokelumne Aqueduct soon after entering the city of Lafayette. SR 24 terminates at the intersection with Interstate 680 just inside the city limits of Walnut Creek.

The of the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) system runs in the freeway&#x27;s center median, excepting the vicinity of the Caldecott Tunnel and the approach to the interchange with Interstate 680.

SR 24 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System, and is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country&#x27;s economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. SR 24 is eligible to be included in the State Scenic Highway System; however, Caltrans has only designated it as a scenic highway between the eastern end of the Caldecott Tunnel and I-680, meaning that it is a substantial section of highway passing through a &quot;memorable landscape&quot; with no &quot;visual intrusions&quot;, where the potential designation has gained popular favor with the community. SR 24 is designated as both the Grove Shafter Freeway, after streets the route travels along (Grove Street was later renamed Martin Luther King Jr. Way), and the William Byron Rumford Freeway, honoring the first African American elected to a state public office in Northern California, from the Caldecott Tunnel to the I-580 interchange segment of the MacArthur Maze, continuing henceforth as I-980 to the terminus with I-880.

==History==
Highway 24 was designated in 1932 in conjunction with the ongoing construction of the Broadway Low Level Tunnel (renamed the Caldecott Tunnel in 1960) which opened in 1937, connecting with the new Eastshore Highway and the approaches to the new Bay Bridge by way of Tunnel Road and Ashby Avenue through Berkeley west of the Berkeley Hills, and routed along Mount Diablo Boulevard through Contra Costa County east of the hills. Before either the bridge or the tunnel were completed, Highway 24 was provisionally routed starting from downtown Oakland at the major intersection of San Pablo and Broadway, which was also the terminal point of US 40 and State Highway 17. From this point, Highway 24 proceeded northward along Broadway to College Avenue, then along College to Claremont Avenue, up Claremont to Tunnel Road, then up into the Berkeley Hills on Tunnel Road to the old Intercounty Tunnel (also called the Kennedy Tunnel), through the tunnel into Contra Costa County.

Highway 24 remained along Ashby Avenue until completion of the Grove-Shafter Freeway in the late 1960s. This new freeway, which ran from the Caldecott Tunnel through downtown Oakland to the MacArthur and Nimitz Freeways, was designated Route 24 and Ashby was re-designated Route 13.

Route 24 used to extend much further east. The section of Interstate 680 between the current terminus of SR 24 and State Route 242 was dual-signed I-680 and SR 24 until ; State Route 242 which runs primarily in Concord was signed as Route 24 until the same time. Older maps show routes for 24 which continue along State Route 4 from the current intersection of 242 to the Antioch Bridge, continuing along the river road to Sacramento, currently State Route 160, then continuing north to Woodland, Marysville, Oroville, along the North Fork of the Feather River to a junction with State Route 89 (this segment is currently State Route 70), where it continued dual-numbered with 89 through Quincy. Highway 24 split from 89 near Graeagle, and continued east through Portola east until its terminus at U.S. Route 395. Parts of the same route were also sometimes designated as State Route 84. 
At least one published map from the 1960s incorrectly showed Route 24 extending eastward from Interstate 680 in Walnut Creek to Route 4 in Pittsburg that followed the Ygnacio Valley Road-Kirker Pass Road-Railroad Avenue corridor, presumably as a future extension that never materialized. A 1970 State Highway Map shows this corridor as a future Route 24 bypass.

A 1956 version of Thomas Brothers maps shows Mount Diablo Boulevard where present day Northgate Road is and labeled as Route 24, winding and climbing the mountain.

==Exit list==
Mileage is measured from SR 24&#x27;s original western terminus, now part of Interstate 980.

<text>Bundelkhand (, ) is a geographical and cultural region and a proposed state and also a mountain range in central &amp; North India. It corresponds to the Post-Vedic Chedi kingdom. The hilly region is now divided between the states of Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh, with the larger portion lying in the latter state.

Jhansi is the largest city in Bundelkhand. Another major city of Bundelkhand is Sagar being second largest city of Bundelkhand and headquarter of Sagar Division.

== Etymology ==

Bundelkhand means &quot;Bundela domain&quot;. The region was earlier known as Jejabhukti or Jejakabhukti (&quot;Jeja&#x27;s province&quot;). According to the inscriptions of the Chandela dynasty, this name derived from Jeja, the nickname of their ruler Jayashakti. However, it is possible that the name derives from an even earlier name of the region: &quot;Jajhauti&quot; or &quot;Jijhoti&quot;. After the Bundelas replaced the Chandelas around 14th century, the region came to be known as Bundelkhand after them.

==History==

The Chandelas were a powerful dynasty in Central India, ruling from the 9th to the 12th century. They are best known for constructing the temples of Khajuraho, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Chandelas ruled over a vast territory, and their influence gradually diminished until their eventual fall in 1182 CE.

After the decline of the Chandela, the Khangar community, an ancient Kshatriya clan, established their rule over parts of present-day Bundelkhand from the late 12th century until the mid-14th century. The Khangar dynasty had its seat of power at Garh Kundar, a fort built by Khet Singh Khangar. Their rule over Jujhauti, a region in Bundelkhand, began after the fall of the Chandels in 1182 CE.

By the 14th century, the Bundela dynasty emerged and supplanted the Khangar rulers. Before the advent of British colonial rule in India, the region of Bundelkhand also included several princely states, such as Orchha, Datia, and Samthar. Also, kingdoms such as Damoh, Ramgarh were ruled by Lodhi Rajputs.

==Proposed Bundelkhand state==

Bundelkhand comprises parts of Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh. While Bahujan Samaj Party government under Mayawati had proposed in 2011 creation of Bundelkhand from seven districts of Uttar Pradesh, organizations such as Bundelkhand Akikrit Party and Bundelkhand Mukti Morcha (BMM) want it to include six districts from Madhya Pradesh as well. Uma Bharati of Bharatiya Janata Party has promised separate state of Bundelkhand within three years if her party voted to power, during campaign for Loksabha Election, 2014 at Jhansi. Similar promise was made by Congress leader Pradeep Jain Aditya during Loksabha Election, 2014.

Since the early 1960s there has been a movement for establishing a Bundelkhand state or promoting development of the region. Bundelkhand is geographically the central part of India covering some part of Madhya Pradesh and some part of Uttar Pradesh. (At Sagar is the exact centre of the original undivided India: the granite bench mark by British surveyors indicating this is placed in the compound of a church in Sagar Cantonment.) In spite of being rich in minerals, the people of Bundelkhand are very poor and the region is underdeveloped and underrepresented in state and central politics. There are several local parties and organisations, some promoting further development of the region and some seeking statehood. The agrarian crisis and farmers&#x27; suicides are also cited as reasons for separate statehood.

In November 2011, the Uttar Pradesh Council of Ministers proposed to split the state into four parts, with one part being Bundelkhand.

==In art and literature==

An engraving of a picture by Henry Melville entitled &quot;Scene near Chillah Tarah Ghaut, Bundelkhund&quot; was published in Fisher&#x27;s Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1835 alongside a poetical illustration by Letitia Elizabeth Landon, &quot;Scene in Bundelkhund&quot;, which alludes to the desperate conditions in the district due to the famine then prevailing.

The &quot;nearly independent territory of Bundelcund&quot; is featured in Jules Verne&#x27;s 1872 novel &quot;Around the World in Eighty Days&quot;, as the scene where Phileas Fogg and Jean Passepartout rescue the Princess Aouda.

<doc id="783212" wikidata="Q7773022" url="?curid=783212" title="The Voice of Firestone">
<text>The Voice of Firestone is a radio and television program of classical music. The show featured leading singers in selections from opera and operetta. Originally titled The Firestone Hour, it was first broadcast on the NBC Radio network on December 3, 1928 and was later also shown on television starting in 1949. The program was last broadcast in 1963.

==Radio==
The program was sponsored by the Firestone Tire and Rubber Company and aired on the &quot;Blue Network&quot; of NBC Radio on Monday nights at 8:30 p.m. Eastern Standard Time from its 1928 inception. In 1948, &quot;The Voice of Firestone&quot; was the first commercial radio program to be carried simultaneously on both AM and FM radio stations. Firestone&#x27;s 25th anniversary program was broadcast November 30, 1953, and it continued to be heard on radio until 1957.

Regular performers on the series included James Melton, Eleanor Steber, Richard Crooks, Rise Stevens, Robert Merrill, Thomas Heyward, Igor Gorin, Nadine Conner, Dorothy Warenskjold, and Thomas L. Thomas, among many others. Hugh James was the announcer.

NBC dropped the program after the June 7, 1954, broadcast, but ABC immediately began to air it beginning with the following week&#x27;s installment.

==Television==
Firestone sponsored a related television series, The Voice of Firestone Televues, one of the first television series with programming other than news or sports coverage, and according to researchers of television history, may have been the first regularly scheduled series in U.S. television history broadcast beyond New York on a network of multiple stations. It began on November 29, 1943, on New York&#x27;s WNBT, when there were only a few thousand sets in existence. First seen on the rudimentary NBC television network in April 1944 (New York, Schenectady and Philadelphia), it continued until January 1947 with special interest topics in a documentary film format. &quot;The Voice of Firestone&quot; radio-TV programs were known not only for classical music, but for their support of organizations such as 4-H and the United Nations.

When &quot;The Voice of Firestone&quot; arrived on television in the fall of 1949, NBC simulcast the show on radio and TV, one of the first programs to use that technology. Thanks to the appearance on the show of famous classical-music soloists, some from the New York Metropolitan Opera, along with Broadway musical stars, the show was considered quite prestigious, but the ratings always remained low. In an era when successful programs were capable of garnering as many as half the viewers available in a given time slot, &quot;The Voice of Firestone&quot; typically only had three million viewers, a comparatively small number for what was rapidly becoming the nation&#x27;s most influential mass medium. In 1954, NBC asked Firestone&#x27;s permission to move the program to a different night or time period. Firestone refused and NBC canceled the program which then moved to ABC.

The program continued to air at 8:30 on Mondays until 1959, when ABC insisted on moving the show to a later time period. Firestone refused, and the show was canceled entirely. Although the ratings were low at the time of its cancellation, the fan outcry was loud, with some writing their congressmen. ABC tried to appease the fans with Music for a Summer Night, a copy of the show minus Firestone, but the results were not favorable. The 30th anniversary show was telecast November 24, 1958.

In 1962, &quot;The Voice of Firestone&quot; returned, airing at 10pm on Sunday nights. The same relatively small number of viewers tuned in, and the show was permanently canceled in May 1963.

The Firestone Orchestra was conducted by Hugo Mariani (192831), William Daly (1931–36), Alfred Wallenstein (193643) and Howard Barlow (1943 on). Featured among the eight regular singers of the Firestone Chorus were Lorraine Donahue, William Toole (baritone), Russell Hammar (tenor), Donald Craig (bass), and Bill Metcalf. Hugh James was the announcer.

==Cast==
* Howard Barlow as Conductor
* Mary Costa as Marguerite

==Theme songs==
Idabelle Firestone (Mrs. Harvey S. Firestone) was the composer and lyricist of the program&#x27;s opening and closing theme songs. She wrote &quot;In My Garden&quot; in 1933 which became the Firestone Hour&#x27;s opening theme until 1940. In that year &quot;In My Garden&quot; was banned from use by ASCAP due to a composers&#x27; dispute. Mrs. Firestone then introduced the popular &quot;If I Could Tell You&quot; which became the show&#x27;s opening theme song for all its remaining years. &quot;In My Garden&quot; became the closing theme later when the dispute was resolved. Tenor Richard Crooks, the longtime host of the radio broadcasts (from 1928 to 1945), recorded &quot;If I Could Tell You&quot; for RCA Victor. Soprano Eleanor Steber, a frequent Firestone host following Crooks, also recorded both of Idabelle Firestone&#x27;s songs.

<text>Third Lanark Athletic Club was a Scottish football club based in Glasgow. Founded in 1872 as an offshoot of the 3rd Lanarkshire Rifle Volunteers, the club was a founder member of the Scottish Football Association (SFA) in 1872 and the Scottish Football League (SFL) in 1890. Third Lanark played in the top division of the SFL for the majority of the club&#x27;s existence, and won the league championship in 1903–04. The club also won the Scottish Cup twice, in 1889 and 1905. Third Lanark went out of business in 1967, as a result of mismanagement, six years after having finished in third place in the SFL. Third Lanark&#x27;s former ground, Cathkin Park in Crosshill, is still partially standing and is used for minor league football.

In 1996, an amateur football club called Third Lanark was founded, with intentions of restoring the club&#x27;s name to senior football, and returning to play regularly at Cathkin Park. In 2008, the club was reformed again as &quot; Third Lanark AFC&quot; and currently has an amateur team and four youth teams. The chairman of the reformed club is Simon Weir.

==History==
===Foundation and expansion===

Third Lanark started as the football team of the Third Lanarkshire Rifle Volunteers (3rd LRV), part of the Volunteer Force. The team was formally founded on 12 December 1872 at a meeting of the Third Lanarkshire Rifle Volunteers in the Regimental Orderly Room in Howard Street, Glasgow. The soldiers, inspired by the first ever international friendly which had taken place two weeks previously, decided to form their own team. Several of the Scotland team in that match, made up solely of Queen&#x27;s Park players, had been part of the regiment: including Billy Dickson, Billy MacKinnon and Joseph Taylor. In its early years, the club was successful in shooting competitions, with members winning the prestigious &#x27;Queen&#x27;s Prize&#x27; (still contested today as an event within the Commonwealth Games).

A later meeting decided that the playing kit should be: &quot;A cowl – one end blue, the other yellow, a scarlet guernsey. Blue trousers or knickerbockers with blue stockings.&quot; It was later decided that all guernseys should have the number three on them, and at the first AGM in March 1873, the constitution was amended to allow members of Queen&#x27;s Park to become office bearers of Thirds. The players first used an old drill field on Victoria Road (north of the village of Strathbungo, close to today&#x27;s Govanhill Park, roughly on the site of Hutcheson&#x27;s Grammar School&#x27;s Primary department), to train. The club soon moved a short distance to a new ground, Cathkin Park situated at the junction of Allison Street and Hollybrook Street.

Having joined the newly formed Glasgow Football Association in 1883, the club was a founder member of the Scottish Football League in 1890. By then, Third Lanark had already won the Scottish Cup in 1889, having fallen at the final in 1876 and 1878. The name was changed to Third Lanark AC in 1903, when official links with the military were severed. In the same year, the club moved to the second Hampden Park which had been vacated and deconstructed by Queen&#x27;s Park who themselves had relocated to a new third Hampden. Third Lanark had to play much of the 1903–04 at this new Hampden while their own ground, renamed New Cathkin Park, was rebuilt for their use. Despite this upheaval, they won their only Scottish League championship in that season, as well as the Scottish Cup again in 1905 (they were losing finalists in 1906). In that pre-World War I period they also claimed the minor Glasgow Merchants Charity Cup in 1890, 1898, and 1900 and the Glasgow Cup in 1903, 1904 and 1909.
In 1921, Third Lanark organised a tour of North America inviting several guest players to join them and thus being billed in some press reports and marketing as a &#x27;Scotland XI&#x27;. Indeed, only four of the players were actually registered with Third Lanark. During the tour they played 25 matches, winning 24 and drawing the other game. Two years later the club (again with some guest players) made a tour over South America, playing a total of eight friendly matches in Buenos Aires and Montevideo, including a game against the Argentina national side on 24 June. They dropped out of the top division for the first time in 1925 and spent a period as a &#x27;yo-yo club&#x27;, with three relegations and three promotions in total over the next decade. As well as consolidating in Division One until the interruption of World War II, the club also reached another Scottish Cup Final in 1936, going down 1–0 to Rangers.

After being relegated in 1953, Third Lanark beat Rangers 1–0 to lift the Glasgow Charity Cup in 1954, and captured the same trophy two years later against Partick Thistle, then returned to the top tier in 1957.

After losing to Hearts in the 1959 Scottish League Cup Final, the last day of the 1960–61 season saw the club reach a historic landmark. Third Lanark beat Hibernian 6–1 at Cathkin Park to reach 100 goals for the season, and the win secured third place in Scotland&#x27;s top division. The following season saw &quot;Thirds&quot; take part in European competition for the only time when the club faced Rouen of France home and away in the Anglo-Franco-Scottish Friendship Cup (Rouen won 4–0 at Cathkin on 7 November 1961 and 2–1 in France on 9 May 1962). Third Lanark won its final senior trophy, the Glasgow Cup, on 8 April 1963, beating Celtic 2–1 in the final at Hampden Park.

===Decline===

Only four years after that successful 1960–61 season, the club&#x27;s decline began. The 1965–66 season found Thirds in Division Two, having been relegated as a consequence of the club&#x27;s most unsuccessful season ever, with only three wins and a single draw from 34 matches in the league in 1964–65 (the final 21 fixtures were all lost).

There followed another two seasons of mediocrity and discontent. On 8 January 1966, the &quot;Glasgow Herald&quot; announced in a front-page story that the board was investigating the possibility of moving Third Lanark to the new town of East Kilbride and selling Cathkin Park for housing. That season, Third Lanark played 36 league matches, winning 12, drawing 8 and losing the other 16, thus gaining 32 points to finish fourteenth out of nineteen clubs. 55 goals were scored and 65 conceded.

Third Lanark recorded its lowest-ever home League attendance of 297 spectators on Saturday 15 April 1967 (on the same day as the England-Scotland international at Wembley) for the visit of Clydebank. Third Lanark won 1–0 with a goal from forward John Kinnaird; it would be the team&#x27;s final competitive victory. The last Third Lanark home game against Queen of the South on Tuesday 25 April 1967 ended in a 3–3 draw; Brian McMurdo scored twice for Queens in the second half, including the last goal in senior football at Cathkin Park (the Thirds goals came from John Kinnaird (2) and Hugh McLaughlan; they were 3–1 up at half time). The final attendance at the ground was given as 325 spectators.

The final Thirds game was a humiliating defeat at Boghead Park when hosts Dumbarton won 5–1 on Friday 28 April 1967 in front of 581 spectators (the last Thirds goal was scored by future Airdrie and Hearts star Drew Busby). The line-up in that final game at Boghead was: Bob Russell; Tony Connell and Gerry Heaney; Hugh McLaughlan, Jim Little and Gordon McEwan; Hugh Rundell, Bobby Craig, Drew Busby, Don May and John Kinnaird. The manager was former Rangers captain Bobby Shearer, assisted by former Scotland international John McKenzie as trainer.

This game ended Third Lanark&#x27;s participation in senior football in Scotland. In the club&#x27;s final season of existence in Division Two of the Scottish Football League, Third Lanark played 38 League games, winning 34 points out of a possible 76 to finish eleventh out of twenty clubs. They won 13 games, drew 8 and lost the remaining 17; 67 goals were scored and 78 conceded. In the 1960–61 season, home and away, Thirds had attracted 555,489 paying customers to their matches; in the final season of 1966–67, just 55,543 spectators attended their matches.

About a fortnight after the final match at Boghead Park, it was announced that Glasgow Corporation had received an offer from the Third Lanark board to sell it the land at Cathkin for housing. The club&#x27;s board acknowledged that a lack of funds had made this move inevitable. Around the same time, the board also announced that it was negotiating with an estate company to build a new stadium at Bishopbriggs, to the north of Glasgow. In the end, the stadium was never built.

A subsequent Board of Trade investigation into Third Lanark&#x27;s affairs - which was published in November 1968 - revealed constant player squabbles and bitter internal struggles for power, as well as the fact that the corruption at Cathkin extended to defrauding the club lottery (which rarely paid out the weekly £200 prize). It was also disclosed that players were paid late and often in coins rather than notes, they had to make their own way to away matches, hot water was not available after matches and every appointment in the club&#x27;s management was made personally by club chairman Bill Hiddleston. This may have been a disincentive for anyone who was not close to Hiddleston to remain working for, or remain as a shareholder of, the club.

All of these events finally took their toll; on 7 June 1967, Lord Fraser in the Court of Session in Edinburgh issued a winding-up order and appointed an official liquidator. The petition to wind up the club had been brought by a Glasgow building company which claimed that the club owed it more than £2000 for work done on the new stand at Cathkin Park. The judge accepted figures submitted on behalf of the provisional liquidator which showed that the club&#x27;s liabilities exceeded its liquid assets by £40,000 in preference to those presented by the club and, with no sign of that position changing any time soon, he was left with no alternative but to issue an order to wind up the club.

On 26 June 1967, it was announced that Third Lanark&#x27;s membership of the Scottish Football League had ceased and that the club&#x27;s remaining players were up for transfer.

On 1 July 1968, four former directors of Third Lanark were found guilty of contravening the Companies Act 1948 by failing to keep proper books of account during the two years preceding the liquidation of Third Lanark, and fined £100 each. The investigation by the Board of Trade accused club chairman Bill Hiddleston of blatant corruption and found that &quot;the circumstances (merited) police inquiry&quot;. Hiddleston had died of a heart attack in Blackpool on 16 November 1967.

The role of chairman Hiddleston in the club&#x27;s liquidation was, and remains, the subject of debate among those close to Third Lanark. He may have wished to profit personally from the sale of Cathkin Park for property development. Cathkin Park was sold for housing during the 1967 close season, but Glasgow City Council refused planning permission. On the other hand, he built a new grandstand for the club in 1963, an unlikely thing to do if Hiddleston had intended to put the club out of business. Another allegation was that Hiddelston wanted to force the club to move to either Cumbernauld or East Kilbride, the then booming New towns in the Glasgow commuter belt, which at that time had no senior sides of their own.

===After liquidation===
After Third Lanark went into liquidation, some Third Lanark fans began supporting other local clubs such as Queen&#x27;s Park or Clyde, and others began supporting the Old Firm. The nearby Junior club Pollok also received many new fans. Although most other Scottish teams that went into liquidation were later reformed as amateur sides, there was no such resurrection for Third Lanark for many years. It has been suggested that this was because there was such a prolonged period of downfall for Third Lanark that many fans felt too tired of what had gone on at the club to try to bring it back.

A youth team later adopted the name &quot;Third Lanark Athletic&quot; (playing at Rosebank Park), as did a ladies&#x27; team. Occasionally exhibition matches were staged at Cathkin with a scratch Third Lanark team. Former Glasgow MP Sir Teddy Taylor bought the company name &quot;Third Lanark Athletic Club Ltd&quot; from the sequestrators in 1967, when there remained the possibility of the club continuing in another form.

===Rebirth as an amateur side===
Third Lanark returned to its now dilapidated Cathkin Park home, playing in the Greater Glasgow Amateur League.

On 9 June 2008, a four-man delegation from the club made a surprise announcement to the press, stating that Third Lanark AC would be interested in returning to the Scottish Football League, after SPL team Gretna decided to withdraw from the SFL. The other contenders for the vacant league place were Spartans, Cove Rangers, Annan Athletic, Preston Athletic and Edinburgh City. However, there was no formal application from Third Lanark to enter the SFL, and the club remained in Division 3 of the Greater Glasgow Amateur League. The vacant senior League place finally went to Annan Athletic.

In recent times, there have been moves towards reviving the senior club.

Third Lanark A.F.C. is an amateur team who, as of the 2018–19 season, play in the Central Scottish Amateur Football League. The team previously competed in the West of Scotland AFL and the Greater Glasgow Premier AFL. As of 2018, the team is playing its home games at the Toryglen Regional Football Centre (a modern facility a short distance from Cathkin Park) and at the Barlia Football Centre in Glasgow&#x27;s Castlemilk district, having played at Fullarton Park (home of Vale of Clyde F.C.), in prior seasons.

==Nickname==
Third Lanark was known as Thirds, the Warriors, the Redcoats, and the Hi Hi. The last nickname was rumoured to have started during a match in the late 1890s, when a defender kicked the ball so high out of the ground that the crowd started screaming &quot;High High High&quot; and that nickname stayed with the club ever since. The fans invariably started to sing &quot;Hi Hi Hi!&quot; as a battle cry to encourage the team to victory during the club&#x27;s matches. There was a public house called The Hi Hi Bar at the southern end of Crown Street in the Gorbals area of Glasgow, about one mile from the club&#x27;s Cathkin Park stadium.

==Ground==
Third Lanark played at the original Cathkin Park from their foundation until 1903, at which time they took over Queen&#x27;s Park&#x27;s Hampden Park ground, renaming it New Cathkin Park, while Queen&#x27;s Park moved to a new Hampden Park in Mount Florida. New Cathkin Park is currently owned by Glasgow City Council, and large areas of the terracing remain intact on three sides of the ground.

==Ownership and finances==
Third Lanark was incorporated in 1903. Its initial shareholders were mostly middle-class fans who were wealthy enough to invest in the club. Very few of them were business people or entrepreneurs.

<text>Benjamin Wadsworth (February 28, 1670 – March 16, 1737) was an American Congregational clergyman and educator. He was trained at Harvard College (B.A., 1690; M.A., 1693). He served as minister of the First Church in Boston; and as president of Harvard from 1725 until his death.

==Wadsworth House==

Built in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1726 for the president of Harvard, Benjamin Wadsworth, and his wife, Wadsworth House has had a long and illustrious history. It is the second oldest building at Harvard (the first being Massachusetts Hall), built on the site where Harvard&#x27;s earliest building, the Peyntree House, had previously stood. General George Washington, with the assistance of his second-in-command Charles Lee, set up his first headquarters in the house. It was used as Washington&#x27;s headquarters from July 2 to July 16, 1775, before transferring to the larger John Vasall House (now the Longfellow House) on Brattle Street.

In Wadsworth House nine Harvard presidents lived from 1726 to 1849. In 1849, when Jared Sparks decided to stay in his nearby home, Harvard presidents ceased to live in Wadsworth House. After that time, Wadsworth House took in student boarders (including Ralph Waldo Emerson &#x27;21) and visiting preachers, among others. The Wadsworth House lost its front yard when Massachusetts Avenue was widened.

Today, the building houses the Office of the University Marshal, the Commencement Office, Prof. Robert Darnton the University Librarian, the Harvard Office for Scholarly Communication (headed by Peter Suber), and several professors.

==Anti-abortion writings==

In 1712, Wadsworth was one of the first to write about abortion in America, saying those involved either directly or indirectly were guilty of, &quot;murder in God&#x27;s eyes&quot;.

<doc id="783242" wikidata="Q1142007" url="?curid=783242" title="Labour Party (Lithuania)">
<text>The Labour Party (, DP) is a populist centre-left political party in Lithuania. The party was founded in 2003 by the Russian-born millionaire businessman and member of Seimas Viktor Uspaskich.

== History ==
===Foundation and first government (2003–2006)===

In its first electoral test, the 2004 European parliamentary elections, it was by far the most successful party, gaining 30.2% of the vote and returning five MEPs. It joined the European Democratic Party and thus the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE) Group.
At the legislative elections of 2004, the party won 28.4% of the popular vote and 39 out of 141 seats, making it the largest single party in the Parliament of Lithuania. After the election, Labour formed a coalition government with the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania, New Union and Lithuanian Peasant Popular Union.

After the 2004 Lithuanian parliamentary election, sociologist Vladas Gaidys speculated that the Labour Party supporters had previously voted for New Union (Social Liberals) between 2000 and 2004.

===The &quot;dark accounting&quot; case===
On 17 May 2006, a pre-trial investigation of the Labour Party began after information from the State Security Department of Lithuania revealed that the party may be funded from illegal activities. During the period from its foundation to 2006, the party&#x27;s bookkeeping did not report 7 million Euros of additional income. Allegations were first raised on the party&#x27;s accounting and secretaries, but on 29 June, it was declared that the party will be tried as a juridical person.

Uspaskich resigned from party leadership and fled to Moscow. After a European Arrest Warrant was given to arrest him, he was arrested on 15 August and extradited to Lithuania on 27 August. While in Moscow, Uspaskich organized press conferences where he declared Lithuania to be a &quot;undemocratic state&quot;, and described the case as a politicized attempt to destroy the Labour Party.

The Labour Party was acquitted on 2013, as it united with the Labourist Party, a satellite party established in 2008, and was no longer the same legal entity. Though the Supreme Court of Lithuania made a ruling that this reorganization should have been ignored and the case should have been continued, it was not renewed due to an expired statute of limitations. Individual party leaders received fines and prison terms - however, they were acquitted in 2016, on the leadup to the 2016 parliamentary election.

===Opposition (2006–2012)===
Because of the ongoing &quot;dark accounting&quot; case, the party was expelled from the ruling coalition and moved to opposition in June 2006, while some of its members (including Speaker of the Seimas Viktoras Muntianas) founded the Civic Democratic Party and joined the new coalition led by Gediminas Kirkilas. At the legislative elections of 2008 the party lost heavily, retaining only 10 seats in the Seimas from its previous 39 and obtaining 9% of the national vote.

In 2011, the New Union (Social Liberals) merged with the party. In May 2012, the Labour Party joined the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE) party.

===Second government and opposition (since 2012)===
At the 2012 parliamentary election the party had considerable success, obtaining 19.82% of the votes (+11.83% compared with the 2008 election) in the proportional representation quota and a total tally of 29 seats.
Following the results, the Labour Party joined the coalition cabinet led by Algirdas Butkevičius, with four portfolio ministers out of 15. In 2013, the Christian Party merged with the party.

At the 2016 parliamentary election, the party obtained just 4.88% of the votes in the proportional representation quota (5% of the votes are needed for representation) and won only two seats in single member constituencies. In 2017 the party started to lose its members (including long–time members like former chairman Živilė Pinskuvienė) en masse, which formed various movements in local government or joined the Social Democratic Labour Party of Lithuania in 2018.

On 15 April 2018, former chairman Viktor Uspaskich was selected as the new chairman of the party. After this, the party made speedy recovery – in the 2019 municipal election, the party obtained 5.09% of the votes and in 2019 European Parliament election it won nearly 9% of the votes. At the 2020 parliamentary election, the Labour Party won about 10% of the votes. This gain of support was attributed to votes&#x27; shedding of Electoral Action of Poles in Lithuania – Christian Families Alliance, which by itself failed to reach 5% threshold in nationwide constituency.

In 2021, the party&#x27;s board decided to withdraw from its affiliation of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party. This came following the expulsion of party leader MEP Viktor Uspaskich from the Renew Europe group at the European Parliament due to his homophobic comments.

== Ideology ==
In the 2010s, the Labour Party was considered to be one of the main left-wing parties in Lithuania, together with the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania. However, it is also considered a personalistic populist party with an unclear ideological orientation. It describes itself as a &quot;party of the centre open to everyone.&quot; The party owes its success and existence to the wealth and charisma of millionaire Russian-born businessman Viktor Uspaskich, who promoted a populist platform of opposing the elite and taking care of &quot;the common man&quot;. The Centre for Eastern Studies and Center for Strategic and International Studies place the party left of center. The party is opposed to austerity policies and is known for its ambitious plans of social support. Its populism revolves around mobilizing dissatisfaction with established politicians for neglecting the poor social groups of Lithuania. The party&#x27;s rhetoric has been described as &quot;basically social democratic&quot;. At the same time, the party is also connected with major businesses in Lithuania, and it has been described as the political arm of the Lithuanian Confederation of Business Employers (Lithuanian: &quot;Lietuvos verslo darbdavių konfederacija&quot;), which Uspaskich was the president of from 1997 to 2003 and which was the origin of several of the party&#x27;s founding members, including Romualda Kšanienė, Dangutė Mikutienė, Vitalija Vonžutaitė, Viktoras Muntianas, Šarūnas Birutis and Antanas Bosas.

During electoral campaigns, it generally advertises itself by promising raw increases to pensions and minimum wages, often beyond the country&#x27;s ability to accomplish such promises; in the electoral campaign for the 2016 parliamentary elections, the Labour Party manifesto called to double minimum wages immediately after election, setting them at 60 percent of the average wage, a balance higher than in any European country. During the European migrant crisis, the Labour Party embraced anti-migrant rhetoric. The party&#x27;s leader Valentinas Mazuronis called for Lithuania to block the distribution of refugees among EU member states. The party focuses on protecting and improving workers&#x27; rights in Lithuania, but also supports improving business conditions and boosting private investment, especially in the country&#x27;s rural regions.

According to studies, the Labour Party garners support from voters with a positive judgment of the Soviet period and voters who see Russia as a potential partner to Lithuania rather than a threat, as well as non-Lithuanian voters. The party is commonly described as pro-Russian, though it has resented such claims, and officially supports membership in EU and NATO. The party&#x27;s founder, Viktor Uspaskich, has led the party directly or indirectly ever since its foundation in 2003. According to Member of the Seimas and former Labour Party member Antanas Guoga, it is a &quot;cult with a spiritual leader&quot;. Professor of the Institute of International Relations and Political Science in Vilnius University Tomas Janeliūnas described the party as &quot;a collection of conformists&quot;, unified by Uspaskich. These descriptions came in the aftermath of a scandal in December 2020, in which Viktor Uspaskich used his Facebook account to advertise &quot;ŪPAS&quot; mineral water, which, according to him, provides a person with immunity against COVID-19, without the need of vaccination. Guoga was the only Labour Party MP to condemn the action, and it was either defended or unaddressed by other members of the party.

<text>Oravais () is a former municipality of Finland. It is located in the province of Western Finland and is part of the Ostrobothnia region. The municipality had a population of 2,189 (31 October 2010) and covered a land area of . The population density was . The municipality was consolidated with Vörå-Maxmo to form the new municipality of Vörå on 1 January 2011.

The municipality was officially bilingual, with the majority speaking Swedish (81%) and the minority Finnish (10%). Most of the remaining 9% live in &quot;Oravais Reception Centre for Refugees&quot;, and speak several other languages.

==Trade and industry==
Farming forestry and fur farming employs 18.8% of the population, industry etc. 33.4%, the service sector 46.8% and unclassified sectors 1%. Traditionally, Oravais has been dominated by farming, with notable elements of industry. The structural transformation of farming has been considerable; today 118 farmers and about 40 fur farmers are still active. 

Among the larger employers we find companies working with construction, manufacturing of sandpaper, packing and equipment. There are many small businesses. The location at a main road has furthered restaurant enterprise. Tourism has been enhanced since the 1990s.

== History ==
Oravais was detached from Vörå as a semiautonomous entity with their own chapel in 1676 and became an independent parish in 1859.

The Battle of Oravais was a critical event during the Finnish War 1808–09 between Russia and Sweden, and took place on September 14, 1808. The Russian troops won the battle, which became the turning point in the war. After the defeat of Sweden in the war, Finland became a Grand Duchy under Russia.

In the village Kimo (, ) the ironworks &quot;Kimo bruk,&quot; (Kimo works) was founded in 1703 by the Stockholm businessman Petter Heijke, who already ran Orisberg works in the neighbouring municipality Storkyro. Several helve hammers were built at the works; they were actuated by water power from the Kimo river. The ruins of the forge, which was built at the works in 1791, still remain. The enterprise came to an end in the 1860s; after that water mills were set up in the building. The mill was closed in 1979. Since 1986, the old mill is the scene for an outdoor theater every summer. Historical plays, written by playwrights with local association, are often performed.

The iron ore was shipped to Oravais and worked up at &quot;Oravais blast furnace&quot; before it was transported to Kimo works. In the same place, &quot;Oravais factory&quot; was established after the ironworks era was over; for many years it was an important textile industry. The factory contributed to the character of Oravais by giving the municipality some mobility of inhabitants and a presence of casual labourers – otherwise an alien phenomenon on the Finnish countryside – and the corollary occurrence of socialist ideas. The vast majority of the inhabitants, however, were farmers until modernity progressed in the 20th century.

<doc id="783279" wikidata="Q939701" url="?curid=783279" title="Orimattila">
<text>Orimattila () is a town in Päijänne Tavastia region, Finland. The southern part of Lahti is connected to the village of Pennala, which is located in the northern part of the Orimattila municipality. Its neighboring municipalities are Hollola, Iitti, Kärkölä, Lahti, Lapinjärvi, Mäntsälä, Myrskylä and Pukkila.

Orimattila has a population of (), and it covers an area of 814.01 square kilometers of which 28.87 square kilometers is water. The municipality is also unilingually Finnish. Its per-capita population is around 20.14.

The subject of the coat of arms of Orimattila, &quot;a stallion horse carrying a scythe&quot;, refers to both the name of the municipality and local agriculture. The name itself comes from a house called &quot;Orhimattila&quot;, hosted by Henrich Mattzsson Orhimattila, which was already written in a 1573 book of judgment. The coat of arms was designed by Ahti Hammar and approved by the Orimattila Municipal Council at its meeting on 15 September 1956. The Ministry of the Interior approved the use of the coat of arms on 17 December of the same year.

Results of the 2021 Finnish municipal elections, resulted in the True Finns being the largest group on Orimattila council, in Orimattila.

==History==
The area of Orimattila contains Finland&#x27;s oldest known settlement.

Orimattila gets its name from a local farm, established by &quot;Matti Laurinpoika&quot; in 1539. His estate was known as &quot;Orih-Mattila&quot;. As a village, Orimattila was first mentioned in 1561 as &quot;Orihmattila&quot;. A chapel community was established in the late 1500s, and it became an independent parish after it was separated from the neighboring parish of Hollola in 1636. The parish and its main settlement were still known as &quot;Orihmattila&quot; until the 19th century. &quot;Orih&quot; is an older pronunciation of the word &quot;ori&quot; meaning &quot;stallion&quot;, though the loss of the h in place names was prevented by the element after it, in this case &quot;-mattila&quot; (cf. Orivesi, also called &quot;Orihvesi&quot; until the 19th century).

During the Great Northern War, which was caused by the Russian occupation of Finland, the parishes of Orimattila and Hollola were temporarily united. The following year, the bishop of Orimattila was forced to collect taxes from the neighboring parish of Hollola, which was then taken over by the bishop of Stockholm. 

Many immigrants from the Kirvu region were settled in Orimattila as a result of the Continuation War. Orimattila became a town in 1992. In 2009, the municipality decided not to participate in the merger negotiations between the municipalities of Artjärvi and Orimattila, and on 22 March 2010, the two municipalities merged.

<doc id="783295" wikidata="Q2121753" url="?curid=783295" title="Qlippoth">
<text>In the &quot;Zohar&quot;, Lurianic Kabbalah, and Hermetic Qabalah, the qlippoth (, originally , plural of &quot;qəlīppā&quot;; literally &quot;peels&quot;, &quot;shells&quot;, or &quot;husks&quot;), are the representation of evil or impure spiritual forces in Jewish mysticism, the opposites of the Sefirot. The realm of evil is called Sitra Achra () in Kabbalistic texts.

==In the Zohar==

The qlippoth are first mentioned in the &quot;Zohar&quot;, where they are described as being created by God to function as a nutshell for holiness. The text subsequently relays an esoteric interpretation of the text of Genesis creation narrative in Genesis 1:14, which describes God creating the moon and sun to act as &quot;luminaries&quot; in the sky. The verse &quot;Let there be luminaries ( &quot;məʾoroṯ&quot;),&quot; uses a defective spelling of the Hebrew word for &quot;luminaries,&quot; resulting in a written form identical to the Hebrew word for &quot;curses.&quot; In the context of the &quot;Zohar&quot;, interpreting the verse as calling the moon and sun &quot;curses&quot; is given mystic significance, personified by a description of the moon descending into the realm of Beri&#x27;ah, where it began to belittle itself and dim its light, both physically and spiritually. The resulting darkness gave birth to the qlippoth. Reflecting this, they are thenceforth generally synonymous with &quot;darkness&quot; itself.

Later, the &quot;Zohar&quot; gives specific names to some of the qlippoth, relaying them as counterparts to certain sephirot: Mashchith () to Chesed, Aph () to Gevurah, and Hema () to Tiferet. It also names Avon (), Tohu (), Bohu (), Esh (), and Tehom (), but does not relate them to any corresponding sefira. Though the &quot;Zohar&quot; clarifies that each sefira and qlippa is 1:1, even with equivalent partzufim, it does not give all their names.

==In Hermetic Qabalah==

===Mathers&#x27; interpretation===

Christian Knorr von Rosenroth&#x27;s Latin &quot;Kabbala denudata&quot; (1684) (translated &quot;The Kabbalah Unveiled&quot; by Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers) equates these forces with the Kings of Edom and also offers the suggestion they are the result of an imbalance towards Gedulah, the Pillar of Mercy or the merciful aspect of God, and have since been destroyed. In subsequent Hermetic teachings, the qlippoth have tended, much like the sefiroth, to be interpreted as mystical worlds or entities, and merged with ideas derived from demonology.

In most descriptions, there are seven divisions of Hell; Sheol or Tehom; Abaddon or Tzoah Rotachat; &quot;Be&#x27;er Shachat&quot; or Mashchit; Bor Shaon () or &quot;Tit ha-Yaven&quot; (); Dumah or Sha&#x27;are Mavet (); Neshiyyah () or Tzalmavet; and Eretz Tachtit (), twelve qlippothic orders of demons, three powers before Satan, and twenty-two demons which correspond to the 22 letters of the Hebrew alphabet.

===Regardie and Crowley===

According to Aleister Crowley, the three evil forms (before Samael), are said to be Qemetial, Belial, and Othiel.

Crowley (who calls them &quot;Orders of Qliphoth&quot;) and Israel Regardie list the qlippoth and their associated sephiroth on the tree of life as:

#Thaumiel, associated with Kether
#Ghogiel, associated with Chokmah
#Satariel, associated with Binah
#Agshekeloh, associated with Chesed
#Golohab, associated with Geburah
#Tagiriron, associated with Tiphareth
#Gharab Tzerek, associated with Netzach
#Samael, associated with Hod
#Gamaliel, associated with Yesod
#Lilith, associated with Malkuth.

===Kenneth Grant===
Kenneth Grant, founder of the Typhonian Order, provided extensive teachings on the Qlippoth, the shadow side of the Kabbalistic Tree of Life, which represent the chaotic, negative counterparts to the ten sefirot. Grant emphasized the importance of understanding and integrating these darker aspects for a holistic spiritual perspective.

In &quot;Nightside of Eden&quot;, Grant explores the Tunnels of Set, pathways corresponding to the Qlippothic Tree. These tunnels symbolize hidden paths filled with transformative energies beneath the surface of consciousness. Traversing these tunnels involves confronting and integrating darker aspects of the psyche and the universe, which Grant views as crucial for spiritual development.

Grant advocated for balancing light and dark forces, believing that engaging with Qlippothic energies can lead to significant spiritual growth. He often linked the Qlippoth to sexual magic and Tantric practices, suggesting these could harness primal energies for transformation.

Additionally, Grant suggested that H. P. Lovecraft&#x27;s description of Yog-Sothoth as a conglomeration of &quot;malignant globes&quot; may have been inspired by the Qlippoth. This connection underscores the view that Qlippothic forces are integral to both ancient and contemporary esoteric thought.

Grant&#x27;s writings incorporate mythological and symbolic references, including Lovecraftian mythology and ancient Egyptian deities, to provide deeper insights into the Qlippothic entities. His works, such as &quot;Nightside of Eden&quot; and &quot;The Magical Revival&quot;, are essential for understanding his esoteric teachings and their implications for modern occult practice.

<text>Edward Holyoke (June 26, 1689 – June 1, 1769) was an American Congregational clergyman, and the 9th President of Harvard College.

==Biography==

Edward Holyoke was the son of a wealthy and influential businessman, Elizur Holyoke Jr, who held several local town offices and served in the legislature. He is also the grandson of Elizur Holyoke Sr., of Springfield, Massachusetts notable due to the fact Mount Holyoke and Holyoke, Massachusetts are attributed to him.

Edward was educated at North Grammar School, Boston, and then went directly to Harvard College, graduating in 1705 at age 16, he also gave the class&#x27; Bachelor&#x27;s Oration. While at Harvard, Holyoke &quot;had had the distinction, as an undergraduate, of having more fines and black marks recorded against his name for breaches of discipline than any student of his day. In 1708, he received his M.A from Harvard College. From 1709-1712 he was the Librarian at Harvard and between 1712-1716 he was a tutor (instructor), and (1713 - 1716) he was a Fellow of the Corporation (Harvard).

In 1714 he also became a candidate for colleague pastor with Rev. Samuel Cheever of Marblehead, but the majority of the church favored another candidate. The minority that favored Holyoke withdrew and formed a second church which Edward was ordained as Congregational pastor for the Second Church of Marblehead on April 25, 1716, and he served the Second Church of Marblehead for 21 years.

In 1736, he was appointed and then approved by Governor Belcher as the choice as President of Harvard College. The General Court agreed to pay Marblehead Society 140 pounds &quot;to encourage and facilitate the settlement of a minister there...&quot; Holyoke became the 9th President of Harvard College (1737–1769), succeeding after Benjamin Wadsworth death. Holyoke&#x27;s administration began during the religious revivals of the Great Awakening and lasted until the revolutionary controversy with England was entering its final phase. He immediately gained notoriety with his election-day sermon delivered before the Governor and General Court in which he boldly declared:

All forms of government originate from the people ... As these forms have originated from the people, doubtless they may be changed whensoever the body of them choose, to make such an alteration.

and as a liberal in politics, Holyoke was also an eloquent spokesman of new spirit of toleration that was softening the strict tenets of New England Calvinism. To minister or pastors, he had insisted on occasions, that governments

should have no hand in making any laws with regard to the spiritual affairs of their people ... [and] have no right to impose their interpretations of the laws of Christ upon their flocks ... Every Man therefore is to judge for himself in these things.

At first, there were about 100 students at Harvard being taught by the president and four tutors. As president, Holyoke was essentially the chairman of the Harvard Corporation, for which he is responsible to the day-to-day operation of the college, but he was also expected to teach. During Holyoke&#x27;s administration several reforms were undertaken to improve the intellectual climate at the College. The ancient system of each tutor taking a college class through all the subjects in a curriculum was ended, and by 1767 tutors had become specialists instructing students in particular subjects. Moreover, merit, rather than solely birth and social standing, became the criteria for entrance to Harvard College. College history prizes were offered for scholarships, and the custom of flogging students for college offenses was abandoned. Apparently, teaching was not limited to the college, but included studies at his home;

&quot;The Harvard that John Adams went to in 1750 was undergoing one of its periodic reformations, this time under the presidency of Edward Holyoke, class of 1705.&quot; &quot;Through John Adams&#x27; four years at Harvard, the first Saturday &quot;was given over to the study of theology under President Holyoke&#x27;s supervision.&quot;

Holyoke encouraged broader intellectual exploration beyond curriculum and disciplinary changes. In 1755, the Dudleian Lecture was given for the first time by the College President. In 1756, in order to improve English oratory, a system of public exhibitions was introduced. Lasting for over a century, selected students participated in debates, orations, and dialogues in the English language. In 1761, John Winthrop, the Hollis Professor of Mathematics and Natural Philosophy, arranged the first American astronomical expedition to observe Venus&#x27;s transit over the Sun. While not considered an intellect by his contemporaries, Holyoke did strengthen Harvard&#x27;s academic program in mathematics and science, and during his tenure Harvard established the first laboratory for experimental physics in North America.

Holyoke&#x27;s presidency was not without some controversy. In the early 1740s, the revivalist George Whitefield came to Cambridge to preach. Although Holyoke at first welcomed Whitefield to Harvard College, he eventually turned against him because Holyoke perceived Whitefield&#x27;s religious views as excessive, inspiring division among families and local churches. Moreover, Holyoke took exception to Whitefield&#x27;s labeling of Harvard College as a house of impiety and sin. In 1744, Holyoke and other members of the faculty defended the college and warned the local churches against Whitefield&#x27;s views in The Testimony of the President, Professors, Tutors and Hebrew Instructor of Harvard College, Cambridge, Against the Reverend Mr. George Whitefield, And His Conduct. This rebuttal to Whitefield sparked a yearlong pamphlet war between both sides. Despite Holyoke&#x27;s differences with George Whitefield, when a fire destroyed the College&#x27;s original library twenty years later in 1764, Whitefield came to the College&#x27;s aid and donated books and money to help rebuild the library collection.
&quot;The fact that Harvard had moved a long way from the strict faith of the fathers, under Edward&#x27;s &quot;catholic temper&quot; all manner of heresies flourished, or if they were not encouraged, were not firmly suppressed. Yale was the only stronghold of orthodoxy.&quot; &quot;Much was said, both in approval and censure of the President&#x27;s &quot;catholic temper,&quot; which soon affected the intellectual climate of the college. He had, moreover, &quot;a good spirit of government.&quot;
While at times he was a firm disciplinarian, many considered him a kindly man &quot;of a noble commanding presence.&quot; In his company students must stand or uncover. His girth won him the irreverent student nickname of &quot;guts.&quot; He was characterized as an honest man of sound judgment and zealous in the performance of his duties. He had an ability to deal with a society of scholars, Holyoke&#x27;s leadership led Harvard College through turbulent and changing times. Under his administration, Harvard College prospered and flourished. The number of students increased, gifts and endowments were added to the treasury, and intellectual training was improved. During Holyoke&#x27;s tenure the College itself also expanded. Holden Chapel (1744) and Hollis Hall (1763) were built.

Edward Holyoke was President of Harvard College for thirty-two years, which included teaching all but one Massachusetts Revolutionary leaders Samuel Adams (A.B. 1740), James Otis (A.B. 1743), Jonathan Mayhew (A.B. 1744), Thomas Cushing (A.B. 1744), James Bowdoin (A.B. 1745), John Hancock (A.B. 1754), John Adams (A.B. 1755), Joseph Warren (A.B. 1759) and Josiah Quincy Jr. (A.B. 1763). Other notable New England names were John Wentworth, Samuel Quincy, Moses Hemmenway, Charles Cushing, Nathan Webb, William Browne, Philip Livingston, David Sewall, Daniel Treadwell, Tristam Dalton. His long tenure as president was the longest in Harvard&#x27;s history, until Charles Eliot began his record-setting forty-year presidency a century later. However, Holyoke is still considered the oldest person to occupy the presidency of Harvard.

<text>Craig Andrew Moore (born 12 December 1975) is an Australian former professional footballer who played as a centre-back. His 2006 FIFA World Cup profile describes him as being &quot;tough-tackling and uncompromising but also calm and composed under pressure.&quot;

Moore, born and raised in the western Sydney suburb of Doonside, where he attended Crawford Public School and Doonside High while playing for the Doonside Hawks Soccer Club, is best known for his two spells with Scottish Premier Division / Scottish Premier League club Rangers. Having graduated through their youth system, Moore made 252 appearances for the Glasgow based club from 1993 to 2005, punctuated with a season in England with Crystal Palace in the 1998–99 First Division. In his time at Rangers, he became team captain and won numerous domestic league and cup honours, including making 44 appearances and scoring four goals in their 2002–03 Treble-winning season. Moore became an important player at the centre of Rangers defence up until 2004 over two spells.

After leaving Rangers on a free transfer in January 2005, Moore spent a half-season at German Bundesliga club Borussia Mönchengladbach, before moving to English Premier League club Newcastle United. Released by Newcastle after an injury hit two seasons, Moore returned to Australia signing with Queensland Roar (later renamed Brisbane Roar) in the Australian A-League, as their captain and Marquee player. After three seasons with the Roar, in January 2010 Moore moved to Greek Super League side AO Kavala, only to leave in March.

In international football, Moore has made over 50 appearances for the Australia national team, including at the 2006 and 2010 World Cups in Germany and South Africa. Having made his debut in 1995, he has been Australia national team captain a number of times.

==Early life==
Moore was born in Canterbury, New South Wales and raised in Doonside, New South Wales. He played junior football with Brisbane club North Star after his family relocated north when he was thirteen, before a scholarship with the Australian Institute of Sport. While progressing through the Australian Institute of Sport, Moore was friends with Mark Viduka, having known each other since they were teenagers.

While making his way to become a professional footballer, Moore was taught and mentored by Eddie Thomson and was responsible for helping him play in the centre–back position, a position he played throughout his whole career. Manager Walter Smith agreed on playing Moore in the centre–back position, saying: &quot;Centre half is his natural position, although I have used him mostly at full back and in midfield. He is mobile and clever, although his aggressive style of play tends to earn him more bookings than any of us would wish.&quot;

==Club career==
===Rangers (first spell)===
Moore joined Rangers youth system from the Australian Institute of Sport in 1993 and was assigned to the development squad for a year. He made his Rangers debut, starting the whole gamein a 0–0 draw against Dundee United on 5 April 1994. Local newspaper The Herald said: &quot;Most of the Rangers supporters among the 11,048 crowd were unaware of the existence of Moore.&quot;

Moore was included in the first team by manager Walter Smith in the 1994–95 season and successfully dispatched a right–back position from Gary Stevens, who left the club. He provided two goals, including one for Duncan Ferguson, who scored a hat–trick, in a 6–1 win against Arbroath on 17 August 1994. Moore then scored his first goal for Rangers, in a 2–2 draw against Aberdeen on 24 September 1994. However, he was sent–off on two occasions by the end of the year, coming against Motherwell on 22 October 1994 and Hearts on 9 November 1994 that saw him served a combination of three matches. Moore’s contributions at the club saw Rangers win the league for the seventh-consecutive time, as well as, the Glasgow Cup. After scoring an own goal in a 3–0 lost against rivals, Celtic on 8 May 1996, he scored on a last game of the season, in a 1–1 draw against Partick Thistle. Despite facing sidelined due to the league’s the three-foreigner rule and injuries in the 1994–95 season, Moore finished his first full season at the club, making twenty–five appearances and scoring two times in all competitions.

At the start of the 1995–96 season, Moore continued to make himself available in the first team under the management of Walter Smith. He scored the only goal of the game, in a 1–0 win against Aberdeen on 7 October 1995. Despite losing 4–1 against Juventus on 18 October 1995, Moore’s performance was praised, having stepped in the starting line–up for the suspended Alan McLaren. During a 4–1 win against Hearts on 21 October 1995, he was elbowed in the face by Alan Lawrence in an off-the-ball incident but was not noticed by the referee. After the incident, Lawrence was eventually suspended for one match and the linesman, who did not see the incident, was demoted by the Scottish Football Association. By March, Moore made history by becoming the first victim of an on-field offence to give evidence to the SFA disciplinary committee. During a 1–1 draw against Celtic on 17 March 1996, he suffered a foot injury and had to be substituted after just 34 minutes. After the match, it was announced that Moore was out for the rest of the 1995–96 season. However, his season was already marred by injuries and international commitment with Australia, resulting in him making sixteen appearances and scoring once in all competitions. Despite this, his contributions at the club saw Rangers win the league for the eighth-consecutive time and the Scottish Cup.

The start of the 1996–97 season saw Moore continue to recover from a foot injury. It wasn’t until on 18 September 1996 when he made his return from a foot injury, starting a match and played 67 minutes before being substituted, in a 4–0 win against Hibernian in the quarter–finals of the Scottish League Cup. Since returning from injury, he regained his first team place and began rotating in playing either the centre–back position and midfield position. Moore started in the Scottish League Cup final against Hearts and helped Rangers win 4–3 to win the final. After suffering a hamstring injury during a 3–1 win against Dunfermline Athletic on 14 December 1996, he returned to the starting line–up and played 75 minutes before being substituted, in a 3–1 win against Celtic on 2 January 1997. After being sidelined throughout February, Moore scored his first goal of the season, in a 2–2 draw against Aberdeen on 1 March 1997.

After not playing for a month, he made his return to the starting line–up and helped the club kept a clean sheet, in a 3–0 win against Motherwell on 16 September 2001. Moore regained his first team place, reuniting with his centre–back partner, Amoruso despite facing injuries and international commitment along the way.

On the last game of the season, Moore helped Rangers win the league after beating Dunfermline Athletic 6–1. Six days later on 31 May 2003, he helped the club win the Scottish Cup final by beating Dundee 1–0, achieving a domestic treble. Reviewing his performance, The Herald said: &quot;Moore often an unsung hero but he was sorely missed in defence when he was out injured. A consistent and powerful defender, he always tries to do the simple things well.&quot; At the end of the 2002–03 season, Moore went on to make forty–four appearances and scoring four times in all competitions.

Ahead of the 2003–04 season, Moore was expecting to make himself available in the first team under the management of Alex McLeish and also appointed as a new captain following the departure of Barry Ferguson. However, he suffered a hamstring injury during a 1–1 draw against Copenhagen in the first leg of the UEFA Champions League third round, and was sidelined for a month. On 27 September 2003, Moore made his return from injury, coming on as a second half substitute, in a 3–1 win against Dundee. He captained his first match for Rangers against Panathinaikos in the UEFA Champions League match and helped the club drew 1–1. However, Moore, once again, suffered another hamstring injury and was substituted in the 68th minute; in a 3–0 lost against Manchester United on 5 November 2003. It wasn’t until on 28 December 2003 when he made his return from injury, coming on as a second half substitute, in a 3–1 win against Dundee. Having been suspended twice in the beginning of 2004, Moore then scored his first goal of the season, in a 2–0 win against Kilmarnock on 11 February 2004. His second goal of the season then came on 13 March 2004, in a 1–1 draw against Hearts. However, he suffered a knee injury that saw him sidelined for the rest of the 2003–04 season. Despite this, Moore went on to make twenty–five appearances and scoring two times in all competitions.

Ahead of the 2004–05 season, Moore’s future at Rangers was in doubt after McLeish stated that he &quot;may leave the club if the player’s ambition didn&#x27;t match the manager&quot; and still maintain that he need to fight for his first team place. This came after his contract negotiation have been stalled with the club, to the point that his relationship with McLeish to &quot;have deteriorated, perhaps beyond repair&quot;. However, his involvement in the &quot;Olyroos&quot;, the Australian Olympic Football team, angered Rangers manager McLeish as it forced him to miss the start of the Scottish league season, resulting in Moore being stripped of the club’s captaincy and was placed on a transfer list. Following, he was linked with a move away from Rangers in the summer transfer window, with Real Sociedad and Blackburn Rovers interested in signing Moore. His move to Blackburn Rovers collapsed after failing a medical. He ended up staying at the club and made his first appearance of the season, starting the whole game, in a 1–1 draw against CSKA Moscow in the UEFA Champions League play–offs that saw Rangers eliminated from the tournament. Following this, Moore was forced to the fringes of the team and never played for Rangers again. It was reported on 22 December 2004 that he’s expecting to leave the club, with Everton and Borussia Mönchengladbach interested in signing him. By the time Moore left Rangers, he made six appearances in all competitions in the 2004–05 season.

Moore won twelve major honours with Rangers including five league championships and a domestic treble in 2003.

===Borussia Mönchengladbach===

Since joining Borussia Mönchengladbach, Moore became a first team regular, playing in the centre–back position. However, he received a red card for a second bookable offence, in a 2–1 lost against Bayern Munich on 9 April 2005. When Advocaat was sacked after a short time in charge, Moore left the German club after falling out with the club management. By the time he left Borussia Mönchengladbach, Moore made thirteen appearances and scoring once in all competitions.

Shortly after his sacking, it was emerged that the club sacked him after he attended training drunk, a claimed that was denied by Moore. This also led Moore to take legal action against Borussia Mönchengladbach.

===Newcastle United===
On 30 July 2005, Moore signed a two-year deal at Newcastle United to play for the first time in the Premier League.

Moore made his competitive Newcastle United debut on 22 March 2006 against Chelsea in the FA Cup quarter-final, becoming the second Australian to play for the Magpies after Dave Mitchell who had a loan spell at St James&#x27; Park in the 1990–91 season. Moore&#x27;s actual first game came at home to Yeading in which he scored one of five goals. Following this, he started in the remaining matches of the 2005–06 season, playing in the centre–back position. However, Injuries ruined Moore&#x27;s Newcastle career, and he only made eight premiership appearances in the 2005–06 season. Due to injuries when Moore started out at the club, newspaper The Northern Echo branded him as the &#x27;Invisible Man&#x27;.

He then captained his first match at Newcastle United, helping the club win 1–0 against Palermo in the UEFA Cup match on 2 November 2006. However, Moore was then injured with a torn hamstring in November 2006 and was ruled out for several months. He previously suffered a knee injury earlier in the 2006–07 season, but recovered quickly. Moore returned but he struggled to get back into the team, with Peter Ramage, Steven Taylor, and Bramble keeping him out. After Bramble&#x27;s dip in form, Moore returned to the first team, appearing four times. However, his return was short–lived when he suffered another injury that eventually saw him sidelined for the rest of the 2006–07 season. Moore made 17 premiership appearances in the 2006–07 season.

On 16 May 2007, it was announced that Moore&#x27;s contract would not be renewed, and he was released by the club. He made 31 appearances for Newcastle.

It was rumoured on 25 July 2007 that Moore had signed with Queensland Roar (now Brisbane Roar), to become the Roar&#x27;s Marquee signing for the 2007–08 Hyundai A-League Season and the 2008–2009 season. This was confirmed with an announcement by Queensland and Moore on 25 July 2007 with Moore signing to be Queensland&#x27;s marquee player for two years. Upon joining the club, he was given a captain ahead of the new season.

Moore&#x27;s career with the Queensland Roar did not start well when he was sent off in the 69th minute in the first game of the season against Adelaide United for a second yellow card.

After missing the start of the 2008–09 season due to injury, Moore scored his first goal for the Queensland Roar in their 2008–09 season round four clash with Perth Glory, as the club went on to win 3–0. However, his season was interrupted after being diagnosed with testicular cancer.

He began to regain his first team place for the club, playing in the centre–back position until his departure. Moore left the Roar in December 2009, after falling out with the coach Ange Postecoglou and wanting a move to Europe to increase his chances of 2010 FIFA World Cup selection. Following his release, a European club was keen to sign Moore, which turns out to be Scottish Premier League side St Johnstone, where he could rejoin his former teammate Derek McInnes.

Despite leaving Brisbane Roar on bad terms, Moore’s time at the club was remembered fondly by players and the club, who even selected him in Brisbane Roar Ultimate Eleven.

===Kavala===
In January 2010, he moved to Greek side AO Kavala on an eighteen-month contract. He debuted for Kavala on 10 January 2010 in a 1–0 lost against Asteras Tripolis.

It was reported on 31 March 2010 that his contract with Kavala had been terminated after an off-field incident. Moore later denied there had been an off-field incident, stating he had left over fears that he could experience burnout or serious injury, endangering his 2010 World Cup place, had he stayed at the Greek side, having played 15 games in all, 13 of those in just five weeks, on top of his games at the Roar earlier in the season.

===Later career===

Having represented the Socceroos levels, Moore made his debut for the Australia national team and started the whole game, in a 1–0 win against Ghana on 21 June 1995. He played in both legs of the FIFA World Cup qualification against Iran, as the Socceroos failed to qualify for the FIFA World Cup after drawing 3–3 on aggregate through away goal.

It wasn’t until on 23 February 2000 when Moore made his first appearances for Socceroos in three years and scored his first goal for the national team, as well as, setting up the first goal of the game, in a 3–0 win against Hungary. A year later on 28 March 2001, he and his then Rangers teammate, Tony Vidmar were called up to the Socceroos squad for the World Cup qualifying matches. The decision to call-up both players angered manager Advocaat before and during Australia’s World Cup qualifying matches. Moore played all four matches for the national team, including a 22–0 win against Tonga and a 31–0 win against American Samoa. A month later, he was called up to the Socceroos squad for the FIFA Confederations Cup.

In the quarter–finals, the &quot;Olyroos&quot; was eliminated after losing 1–0 against Iraq.

A year later, Moore was called up to the national team squad for the FIFA Confederations Cup. Around this time, he was planning to retire from playing international football. Moore played all three matches for the Socceroos, as the national team were eliminated in the group stage. 

In May 2006, Moore represented the Socceroos in the FIFA World Cup, which was the first time since 1974 that the national team last played in the tournament. Prior to the start of the tournament, he said: &quot;You look at our squad, there&#x27;s going to be competition for all places. That&#x27;s a good thing, a nice headache for the manager, but I&#x27;m confident if I&#x27;m fit that I can get back into the team.&quot; Moore made his World Cup debut, forming a centre–back partnership with Lucas Neill and Scott Chipperfield, and played 61 minutes before being substituted, in a 3–1 win against Japan. He then scored a penalty kick against Croatia in the 39th minute of the game, in a 2–2 draw enabling Australia to progress to the round of 16. However, Moore started the whole game, as Socceroos lost 1–0 against Italy in the knockout stage and saw Australia eliminated from the tournament.

Following the World Cup, Moore spoke about on choosing to represent club over country should he received a call–up. However, he was in a row with Football Federation Australia after arriving late for the Socceroos’ assembly in Brisbane in time for training and other commitments, therefore breaching the National Team Players Agreement and Code of Conduct. This led manager Graham Arnold to suspend him. A month later on 14 November 2006, Moore’s suspension was lifted and played 45 minutes before being substituted, in a 1–1 draw against Ghana. He announced his international retirement on 6 February 2008 after Australia&#x27;s 3–0 win over Qatar in their first FIFA World Cup Qualifier at Telstra Dome.

In September that year, Moore announced his return to come out of retirement for the Socceroos’ International call ups. On 1 October 2008, Australian coach Pim Verbeek announced that he was part of the 35-man squad for the upcoming World Cup Qualifiers. On 14 October 2008, Moore made his first appearance for the national team, coming against Qatar, the last team he played against, and helped Socceroos win 4–0. In May 2010, he represented the Socceroos in the FIFA World Cup in South Africa. Moore played two matches in the World Cup against Germany and Ghana.

==Personal life==
In November 2008, Moore was diagnosed with, and underwent surgery for, testicular cancer. Six weeks later, he was given the all-clear to resume his playing career, having caught it early. After being given the all-clear, Moore said that he undergoes tests every three to four months.

In January 2005, Moore was questioned by police on an accusation on racially abusing a taxi driver on New Year’s Day but he did not face charges after questioning. On 16 September 2010, Moore was arrested in Dubai after being in alterations with a taxi driver. After making a court appearance, he was fined for 1,000 dirhams (about $283) on Sunday for consuming alcohol.

Moore is married to his wife, Heather. Together, they have two children.

In December 2008, Moore was fined for lodging bets totalling $600 on two matches involving A-League teams with betting exchange Betfair. These matches did not include his own side, and because of this, it was deemed a fine was a satisfactory punishment, with the Roar labelling it as an &quot;honest mistake&quot;. In response to the fine, he said: &quot;That&#x27;s been dealt with and it was an honest mistake. I put my hand up and I accepted the punishment, so for me, it&#x27;s been dealt with and we move on.&quot;

<text>Kevin Max Smith (born August 17, 1967) is an American singer, songwriter, and poet. He is best known for being a member of the Christian pop group dc Talk. As a solo artist following the band going on hiatus, he has recorded 12 full-length studio albums, including a Christmas album. From 2012 until 2014, he was the lead singer of the band Audio Adrenaline.

==Early life==
Adopted as a baby to Max and Elaine Smith, Kevin Smith was raised in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Kevin went to high school at Grand Rapids Baptist (now Northpointe Christian). He went to college at Liberty University in Lynchburg Virginia. Kevin Max Smith legally changed his name to &quot;Kevin Max&quot; in 1997 as a tribute to his adoptive father, Max Smith.

==Career==
===dc Talk years (1989–2001)===
While at Liberty University, he met fellow dc Talk bandmates Toby McKeehan (&quot;tobyMac&quot;) and Michael Tait. They formed DC Talk in 1988 and went on to achieve great success in both Christian and mainstream music, winning numerous Dove Awards and Grammys. The band went on to win four Grammy Awards and 16 GMA Dove Awards. The band went on hiatus in 2000 as each member pursued their own solo careers.

===Going solo (2001–2012)===
Max&#x27;s first solo album, &quot;Stereotype Be&quot;, released on August 28, 2001, was praised by Allmusic for &quot;[combining] pop, rock, and world music to create a versatile and intriguing project.&quot;. Artists Adrian Belew and Tony Levin of King Crimson, Larry Norman and drummer Matt Chamberlain contributed to the album along with Max&#x27;s collaborator Erick Cole. It became a turning point in Max&#x27;s career, as the project was a foreshadowing of Max&#x27;s own brand of alternative music.

While &quot;Stereotype Be&quot; has developed a considerable cult following, it was not well received in the Christian music market. Soon after its release, Max was dropped from his Christian label, ForeFront Records. Undeterred, Max began to slowly build his solo career through live shows and word-of-mouth. He released independent albums via his website, including &quot;Between the Fence &amp; the Universe&quot; and a spoken-word collaboration with Adrian Belew, &quot;Raven Songs 101&quot;, both in 2004.

In fall of 2004, Max&#x27;s word-of-mouth strategy finally began to pay off. He played the title role in the Visalia Theatre Company / Hutson-Cavale Productions revival of the classic Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber musical &quot;Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat&quot;. Later that year, he signed a new deal with Northern Records and released a second full-length album, &quot;The Imposter&quot; on October 11, 2005. He released a Christmas album, &quot;Holy Night&quot;, in time for the 2005 Christmas season.

In April 2007, Infinity Music announced that Max had been signed to their label for his next project. &quot;The Blood&quot; was released on December 26, 2007. According to Max, &quot;The Blood is not a classic hymns cover project or a white/homogenized version of black gospel or soul music. It&#x27;s a sensitive and stylized adaption of the music that was at the root of rock and roll, blues and popular culture.&quot;

Max has attempted to create a name for himself apart from DC Talk. While he does not shy away from vocally defending his faith, he has expressed a desire to create art with a universal appeal. He insists, &quot;My music is for a Christian and a Buddhist to pick up and still enjoy, as well as for an atheist. But it is there to prod and ask questions: What is my worldview? What do I believe in, and why do I believe it?&quot;

In February 2008, Max starred in the independent film &quot;The Imposter&quot;. In the film, Kevin plays a character named &quot;Johnny C&quot;, a singer who becomes addicted to OxyContin and loses his family and job as a Christian music star. The movie also features Tom Wright and Troy Baker.

In 2009, Max released Crashing Gates through dPulse records. It was critically praised as returning to his experimental side in the rock and pop genres.

In February 2011, Max formed a supergroup with Broadway singer Tony Vincent and longtime collaborator David Larring. The band was tentatively named &quot;Bad Omens&quot;. The three were writing songs when Vincent decided to drop out to pursue theater interests, leaving the new band in a state of pause. A song, &quot;Control&quot;, can be heard on Max&#x27;s SoundCloud.

On February 27, 2012, Max released &quot;Fiefdom of Angels-Side One&quot;, the first of two albums to coincide with the forthcoming novel series of the same name. The overall project were chosen covers of well known 80&#x27;s rock songs, with one Kevin Max original and a Muse cover set to lush orchestration. Ology Magazine describes the work as &quot;a new wave mix-tape played at full volume through the Sistine Chapel&quot;.

===Audio Adrenaline years (2012–2014)===
In August 2012, Max became the new lead vocalist in a reunited Audio Adrenaline. He continued with the band until June 2014, when the band opted to take a different creative direction.

Max has also contributed vocally to other artists projects including Mark Heard, Jonathan Thulin, Marc Martel, Michael McDonald, 3kStatic, and many others.

===Return to solo career (2014–present)===
In late 2014, Max released two singles, &quot;Infinite&quot; and &quot;Light Me Up&quot;. On March 10, 2015 the album &quot;Broken Temples&quot; was released.

In 2015, Max released another studio album of covers of pop standards &quot;Starry Eyes Surprise&quot;. Max released &quot;Playing Games With the Shadow&quot; in 2016, &quot;Serve Somebody&quot; in 2017, and both &quot;AWOL&quot; and &quot;Romeo Drive&quot; in 2018.

In 2020, Max released spoken word album &quot;Radio Teknika&quot; with electronic pioneers 3Kstatic and in the same summer released &quot;Revisiting This Planet&quot; a tribute to legendary rock artist Larry Norman. Later that year, Max announced a new indie rock band called Sad Astronauts.

In 2022, Max released the album &quot;FANTASY&quot; with co-production by Old Bear Records, Chris Hoisington. Singles &quot;Pure Imagination&quot; and David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;As The World Falls Down&quot; were also released. 

A Kickstarter campaign was successful in supporting the new album &quot;Winter Woods&quot; to be released before December 25, 2022. 

In a statement made on his Facebook page, Max announced that he would be creating an album with Father John Misty Bassist, Eli Thomson in the spring of 2023. Elijah Thomson was also featured on Max&#x27;s album The Imposter.

== Personal life ==
In 1997, Max married Alayna Bennett. They divorced in 2003. In April 2005, he married Amanda Lynn MacDonald, but stated in an interview that earlier the two had &quot;a secret wedding and marriage vows were spoken and we had binding agreement together in front of a spiritual leader, but we decided to go with the public ceremony a little bit later.&quot; They have four children. In August 2010, Max and family moved back to Grand Rapids, Michigan. In 2016, Kevin Max bought a farm an hour southwest of Nashville in Centerville, Tennessee, and called it &quot;Blind Thief Farm and Studio&quot;. In 2018, the Max family moved to the Westhaven community in Franklin, Tennessee. The Max family frequently tours the states in a Winnebago/Mercedes RV titled &quot;Bilbo Waggons&quot;. 

Max became vocal on social media about his politics and spiritual deconstruction in 2019 and 2020 during the pandemic. On the song &quot;Shock Ra&quot; from his 2020 album &quot;Radio Teknika&quot;, he proclaims himself a &quot;gothic, hippie, inclusive, Jesus freak wanting peace&quot;, alongside other political commentary on the album&quot;.&quot; Politically, Max has identified as an anarchist and expressed support for a number of left-wing causes. By 2021, he specifically identified as an &quot;exvangelical&quot;, though he rejected claims that he was no longer a Christian and said that he followed &quot;the Universal Christ&quot;.

<doc id="783318" wikidata="Q514404" url="?curid=783318" title="Right to work">
<text>The right to work is the concept that people have a human right to work, or to engage in productive employment, and should not be prevented from doing so. The right to work, enshrined in the United Nations 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, is recognized in international human-rights law through its inclusion in the 1966 International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, where the right to work emphasizes economic, social and cultural development. 

The Human Rights Measurement Initiative measures the right to work in countries around the world, based on their level of income.

==Definition==
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights states in Article 23.1:

The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights states in Part III, Article 6:

The African Charter on Human and Peoples&#x27; Rights also recognises the right, emphasising conditions and pay, i.e. labor rights. Article 15, states:

==History==
The phrase &quot;the right to work&quot; was coined by the French socialist leader Louis Blanc in light of the social turmoil of the early 19th century and rising unemployment in the wake of the 1846 financial crisis which led up to the French Revolution of 1848. The right to property was a crucial demand in early quests for political freedom and equality, and against feudal control of property. Property can serve as the basis for the entitlements that ensure the realisation of the right to an adequate standard of living and it was only property owners which were initially granted civil and political rights, such as the right to vote. Because not everybody is a property owner, the right to work was enshrined to allow everybody to attain an adequate standard of living. Today discrimination on the basis of property ownership is recognised as a serious threat to the equal enjoyment of human rights by all and non-discrimination clauses in international human rights instruments frequently include property as a ground on the basis of which discrimination is prohibited (see the right to equality before the law).

The right to work, but also a duty, was placed in constitutions of the Soviet Union.

==Criticism==
&quot;The Right to Be Lazy&quot; (1883) by Paul Lafargue, a French Marxist, criticized the concept of a right to work. He wrote: &quot;And to think that the sons of the heroes of the Terror have allowed themselves to be degraded by the religion of work, to the point of accepting, since 1848, as a revolutionary conquest, the law limiting factory labor to twelve hours. They proclaim as a revolutionary principle the Right to Work. Shame to the French proletariat! Only slaves would have been capable of such baseness.&quot;

<text>Samuel Langdon (January 12, 1723 – November 29, 1797) was an American Congregational clergyman and educator. After serving as pastor in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, he was appointed president of Harvard University in 1774. He held that post until 1780.

==Life==
Born in Boston, Massachusetts in 1723, to Samuel Langdon (1687–1723) and Esther Osgood. Langdon attended Boston Latin School and graduated from Harvard in 1740. While teaching in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, he studied theology, and was licensed to preach. In 1745, he was appointed chaplain of a regiment, and was present at the capture of Fortress Louisbourg. On his return, he was appointed assistant to Reverend James Fitch of the North Church of Portsmouth. He was ordained as pastor in 1747, and continued in that charge till 1774, when he became president of Harvard.

At Harvard, his ardent patriotism led him to adopt measures that were obnoxious to the Tory students, and although he endeavored to administer the government of the college with justice, his resignation was virtually compelled in 1780. The following year, he became pastor of the Congregational church at Hampton Falls, New Hampshire.

In 1788, he was a delegate to the New Hampshire convention that adopted the Constitution of the United States, often led its debates, and did much to remove prejudice against the Constitution.

Langdon was distinguished as a scholar and theologian, and exerted a wide influence in his community. The University of Aberdeen gave him the degree of Doctor of Divinity in 1762. He was a charter member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He published &quot;Summary of Christian Faith and Practice&quot; (1768); &quot;Observations on the Revelations&quot; (1791); &quot;Remarks on the Leading Sentiments of Dr. Hopkins&#x27;s System of Doctrines&quot; (1794) and many sermons. In 1761, in connection with Colonel Joseph Blanchard, he prepared and published a map of New Hampshire.

Langdon died in Hampton Falls, New Hampshire on November 29, 1797.

<text>Stefan Klos (born 16 August 1971) is a German former professional footballer who played as a goalkeeper.

His seventeen-year career was spent with Borussia Dortmund and Rangers. He won 16 major trophies in total, including four Scottish Premier League titles and the 1997 Champions League.

==Club career==
===Borussia Dortmund===
Born in Dortmund, Klos arrived at Borussia Dortmund in the summer of 1990, from neighbouring TSC Eintracht Dortmund. He made his Bundesliga debut on 4 May 1991 at only 19, in a 2–2 home draw against SG Wattenscheid 09.

Klos became first choice in 1991–92, relegating Wolfgang de Beer to the bench. He totalled 31 games for the campaign as his team finished runners-up, going on to win back-to-back national championships during his spell.

As well as playing every match in 1996–97 for the third-placed side, Klos added 11 in that season&#x27;s UEFA Champions League as they won the tournament for the first time. He left the club with 339 competitive appearances, and 114 clean sheets.

===Rangers===
On 24 December 1998, Klos signed with Scottish club Rangers on a contract that made him one of the highest-earning players in Europe. He replaced Lionel Charbonnier as starter and was nicknamed &#x27;Der Goalie&#x27;, a play on Andy Goram&#x27;s nickname &#x27;The Goalie&#x27;. He won his first Scottish Premier League title that season.

Rangers won the treble in 2002–03, with Klos again the starter. He did not concede a single goal in the league between 25 August and 28 September 2002. 

Klos was appointed team captain in July 2004. Six months later, he picked up a knee ligament injury in training, missing the remainder of the season and being replaced by Ronald Waterreus; the Dutchman retained his place after he regained full fitness.

Klos looked set to challenge new signing Lionel Letizi after Paul Le Guen&#x27;s arrival at the start of 2006–07, but he suffered a biking injury which gave long-term third choice Allan McGregor the chance to play. On 22 February 2007, he made his first appearance of the season for the first team against Hapoel Tel Aviv FC in the round of 32 of the UEFA Cup, after McGregor was sent off in a 4–0 home win.

Klos left Ibrox Stadium at the end of the campaign after eight and a half years, having played 298 matches in all competitions. He retired at the age of 36, and subsequently settled in Switzerland.

In 2009, Klos was inducted into the club&#x27;s Hall of Fame.

<text>The Barbary falcon (Falco peregrinus pelegrinoides) is a non-migratory subspecies of the peregrine falcon found from the Canary Islands eastwards across some parts of North Africa to the Middle East. It was formerly often treated as a distinct species &quot;Falco pelegrinoides&quot;; when so treated, it also included the central Asian peregrine falcon subspecies &quot;Falco peregrinus babylonicus&quot; as a subspecies (&quot;Falco pelegrinoides babylonicus&quot;).

==Description==
The Barbary falcon is a bird of semi-desert and dry open hills. It typically lays its eggs in cliff-ledge nests.

It is similar to other subspecies of the peregrine falcon, but smaller at length with a wingspan of . It has characteristic plumage, and adults can be recognised from peregrines. Some regard it as a distinct species since it is specialised to a desert environment. Recently, it has been found to be genetically similar to other subspecies of the peregrine falcon, so it is now considered a subspecies of that.

The female is larger than the male. It resembles its relative in general structure. Female Barbary falcons are as large as male peregrine falcons.

Adults have paler grey-blue upperparts than the peregrine falcon and often have a buff wash to the barred underparts, whereas the larger species has a whiter background colour. The nape is rufous, but this is difficult to see.

Sexes are similar, apart from size, but the young birds have brown upperparts and streaked underparts. The streaking is lighter than in the juvenile peregrine falcon.

The call is a high-pitched &quot;rek-rek-rek&quot;.

The Barbary falcon also bears some resemblance to the lanner falcon, but can be distinguished from that species at rest by its size and in the head-pattern, flight, flight action and underwing pattern.

==Distribution==
The Barbary falcon is native to parts of North and East Africa (Algeria, the Canary Islands, Egypt, Eritrea, Libya, Morocco, Niger, Nigeria, Sudan, Somalia and Tunisia), Palestine, Syria, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia. Birds formerly included in the barbary falcon in central and southwest Asia, particularly in Afghanistan, westernmost China, the far north of India, Iran, Iraq, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Oman, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, the United Arab Emirates and Uzbekistan are of the closely similar peregrine falcon subspecies &quot;F. p. babylonicus&quot;.

It is a vagrant in Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Djibouti, Greece, Italy, Kenya, Lebanon, Mali, Malta, Nepal, Portugal, Qatar, Senegal and Turkey.

==Taxonomy==
The Barbary falcon differs in appearance from the peregrine falcon according to Gloger&#x27;s rule. The genetic distance is slight and the species form a close-knit and somewhat paraphyletic group in DNA sequence analyses, and all the major taxonomic authorities now consider it conspecific. They differ more in behaviour, ecology and anatomy than usual for conspecifics. They are able to produce fertile hybrids, but they are generally allopatric and only co-occur during breeding season in small areas such as the Maghreb, the Punjab, Khorasan and possibly the Mongolian Altai and there is clear evidence of assortative mating, with hybridization hardly ever occurring under natural conditions. In short, though they occupy adjacent territories, they breed at different times of the year and Barbary falcons virtually never breed with peregrine falcons in nature.

Assuming a genetic distance of 2% in hierofalcons corresponds to a divergence roughly 200,000–130,000 years ago, the 0.6–0.7% genetic distance in the peregrine falcon-Barbary falcon (&quot;peregrinoid&quot;) complex suggests its current taxa evolved in the Late Pleistocene some 100,000 years ago or less, but before the Upper Paleolithic. The presumed time of divergence between peregrine falcons and Barbary falcons approximately coincides with the start of the last ice age, when desertification was prominent in North Africa and the Middle East and the Persian Gulf became a landlocked inland sea that slowly dried up. Populations of ancestral &quot;peregrinoid&quot; falcons living in marginal habitat at the fringe of the African-Middle Eastern desert belt either adapted (and might have become isolated; e.g., in the Persian Gulf region, which turned into semiarid habitat surrounded by vast deserts), left for better habitat, or became extinct. During interstadials, deserts receded and the aridland and humidland populations could expand to contact again, causing some limited gene flow. This scenario, by and large, parallels the proposed evolutionary history of the saker falcon in relation to the other hierofalcons; indeed, that group shows similar patterns of molecular paraphyly though it is of somewhat earlier origin.

The fossil record adds little to the issue. A humerus some 9,000 years old (i.e., after the last ice age) from the Aswan area in Egypt, where &quot;Falco peregrinus minor&quot; occurs today, was identified as belonging to the peregrine falcon. The Barbary falcon is one of the rare cases that may arguably be considered a species under the biological species concept, but certainly not under the phylogenetic species concept, rather than the other way around as usual. This case demonstrates that what makes a &quot;species&quot; is not only its descent, but also what happens to a population in the course of evolution, how it adapts and how this affects its reproductive isolation (or lack thereof) from sister taxa.

==Conservation and threats==
The population of Barbary Falcons was once considered endangered but is now increasing. In the Canary Islands the population of breeding pairs increased from seven breeding pairs in 1988, restricted to the eastern islands, to 75 breeding pairs in 2006 across the entire archipelago. The species was thought to be extinct in Tenerife but a 2007 study found 26 breeding pairs on the island with potential for further increase indicated by suitable, unoccupied cliffs on the island. This increase has been attributed to increased urbanisation as the falcons primary food source is the domestic pigeon. Pigeon racing is a popular sport on the Canary Islands, leading the falcons to be persecuted by local pigeon racers. This human-wildlife conflict is exacerbated by misinformation such as the widespread belief that the falcons are not native to the islands.

In 1552 king Gustav Vasa gave an order in which the areas of the Lake Oulu were to be inhabited. 140 families left there. In 1555 it was counted that there were 133 families living in Paltamo. The picture church of Paltamo was built in 1726 by Johan Simonpoika Knubb. It was the fourth church on the site. One of the most important persons in the Finnish history of literature – Eino Leino – was born in Hövelö in 1878. Today Paltamo is one of the slowly declining municipalities of Finland.

The name &quot;Paltamo&quot; comes from the Finnish word &quot;palta&quot; &quot;coastal slope&quot;.

==Heraldry==
The word &quot;paltamo&quot; means a tar boat in the Kainuu dialect, which is the reason the coat of arms of Paltamo has three black tar boats on a golden background.

<text>Joseph Willard (December 29, 1738 – September 25, 1804) was an American Congregational clergyman and academic. He was president of Harvard from 1781 until 1804.

==Biography==

Willard was born December 29, 1738, in Biddeford, York County (at that time part of the Province of Massachusetts Bay, but subsequently the state of Maine) into one of the most illustrious families in Colonial Massachusetts. His parents were Reverend Samuel Willard (1705-1741) and Abigail Willard (&quot;née&quot; Sherman). One of his great-grandfathers was another Reverend Samuel Willard, and his great-great-grandfather was Major Simon Willard.

Joseph&#x27;s father died when he was two years old and one year later his mother remarried to a Rev. Richard Elvins. Joseph was educated at the Dummer Academy (now known as The Governor&#x27;s Academy). Through the generosity of friends he entered Harvard College, where he received a B.A. in 1765, and an M.A. in 1768. He was a tutor at Harvard until 1772, when he began serving as pastor at the First Congregational Church in Beverly, Massachusetts. In 1780 he was a charter member and first corresponding secretary of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 1785, he was awarded a Doctor of Divinity degree from Harvard and in 1791, a Doctor of Laws degree from Yale University.

In 1781, he became president of Harvard, in which he served until his death. His tenure was marked by his institution of a dress code (due to his disapproval of the brightly colored silk garments often worn by pupils) consisting of blue-gray coats, and breeches and waistcoats in four approved colors. In 1789, he was recorded as owning an enslaved man named Cesar. When delivering the 1799 commencement address, Willard broke with tradition and delivered it in English, rather than the customary Latin. In 1804, Willard was elected a member of the American Philosophical Society in Philadelphia.

Joseph Willard died in New Bedford, Massachusetts on September 25, 1804.

His great-grandfather Samuel Willard had served as Acting President of Harvard from 1701 until his own death in 1707.

Willard was the father of Cambridge Mayor Sidney Willard.

==Works==
He published a few sermons, a Latin address on the death of George Washington, prefixed to David Tappan&#x27;s &quot;Discourse&quot; (Cambridge, 1800), and mathematical and astronomical papers in the &quot;Memoirs&quot; of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the &quot;Transactions&quot; of the American Philosophical Society. He was a sound Greek scholar, and left a Greek grammar in manuscript.

<doc id="783340" wikidata="Q240086" url="?curid=783340" title="Parikkala">
<text>Parikkala () is a municipality of Finland located in the province of Southern Finland and is part of the South Karelia region, from Lappeenranta and from Joensuu. The town center of Parikkala is about from the Russian border. The municipality has a population of () and covers an area of of which is water. The population density is .

Parikkala is located around lake Simpele and it is a part of a countryside rich with hills and chains of ridges. The municipality is unilingually Finnish.

==History==

Settlements and artifacts dated to the Stone Age and Bronze Age have been found in Parikkala. A permanent settlement was established around the 15th century.

Many demarcations had a significant impact to Parikkala&#x27;s development from the Treaty of Nöteborg on August 12, 1323, to peace treaties signed in 1947 with the Soviet Union; for example, in the Treaty of Nystad from 1721, which in practice defined roughly Finland&#x27;s current border with Russia, Parikkala remained the only current Finnish municipality on the Russian side before the formation of the Grand Duchy of Finland. After World War II, one third (199.3 km2) of Parikkala&#x27;s area was handed over to the Soviet Union. The Orthodox Church has been very influential in this area since the Middle Ages. Later, Parikkala has become known for its many dairies. Parikkala became independent in 1617.

In 2004, three municipalities (Parikkala, Saari and Uukuniemi) merged to form one municipality called Parikkala.

==Education==
A comprehensive school, one of the first rural schools in Karelia of Ladoga, was founded in 1907. In 1910 the first three-class school building was built; later it expanded to include a gymnasium, hall and kitchen. A grand piano was provided in the hall, and Finnish artists Toivo Kuula and Oskar Merikanto held their concerts there when visiting Parikkala. Upper secondary school started in the year 1940 and the first class graduated in 1943. The largest number of pupils was in the 1950s, when over 500 pupils attended school there.

==Traveling and routes==
Parikkala is located on the main railway line from Helsinki to Joensuu. A railway station is located in the middle of Parikkala village center.

<text>Clinton is a community in the Canadian province of Ontario, located in the municipality of Central Huron. Clinton was established in 1831, when Jonas Gibbings and brothers Peter and Stephen Vanderburg cleared out a small area to start. Clinton started to grow in 1844 when William Rattenbury laid out the plans to begin making a village. In 1954, Clinton&#x27;s population was 2,625 people. Today, it has an estimated population of 3,203.

Clinton is known as Canada&#x27;s home of radar and there is a large radar antenna in the downtown because of its association with RCAF Station Clinton during World War II. Clinton was known as &quot;The Corners&quot; or &quot;Rattenbury Corner&quot; in its earlier days.

==History==

Clinton was established in 1831, when Jonas Gibbings and brothers Peter and Stephen Vanderburg cleared out a small area to start. It was named after Sir Henry Clinton, who distinguished himself during the Peninsular War. Clinton started to grow in 1844 when William Rattenbury laid out the plans to begin making a village. Soon after, people began buying land from Rattenbury as well as the Gibbings.

Clinton was the home of the highly influential 19th-century ethnologist and anthropologist Horatio Hale, who involved himself locally in real estate development and other business and educational endeavours. Several of the streets in the centre of the town were personally named by him. Hale is interred in the municipal cemetery north of the community.

In 1858, the Buffalo and Lake Huron Railway set up a stop in Clinton. The station was dismantled and moved to 196 Dunlop Street as a private residence.

In 1863, the first fire department was set up, with 40 men volunteering for duty.

In 1868, William Doherty established the W. Doherty Piano and Organ Co, which manufactured a substantial number of pianos and reed organs in Clinton until the 1930s. Doherty operated a storefront on the main street until 1875, when the company opened a large factory in the town. The factory burned down in 1898 and was quickly rebuilt in time to manufacture organs for the year&#x27;s CNE.

The population in 1869 was 1,500.

In 1875, Clinton was incorporated as a town. 

In 1879, Clinton&#x27;s original town hall burned, destroying the town&#x27;s library and other municipal facilities.

In 1907, a fire burned a substantial business section of the town - with the town&#x27;s first hotel going up in flames, along with a threshing company, a barn and 20 houses.

In 1959, the Clinton area was shocked by the murder of 12-year-old Lynne Harper. Her remains were discovered in a local woodlot near RCAF Station Clinton on June 11, 1959. A local youth, Stephen Truscott (aged 14 years at the time), was falsely convicted of the crime and sentenced to be executed. After a 48-year struggle to clear his name, Truscott was finally acquitted by the Ontario Court of Appeal on August 28, 2007.

In 1978, a protest by church members demanded that three titles be censored from high-school reading lists: Margaret Laurence&#x27;s &quot;The Diviners&quot;, J. D. Salinger&#x27;s &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot;, and John Steinbeck&#x27;s &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot;. A meeting with the Huron County Board of Education, based in Clinton, was attended by prominent Canadian writers including the local resident Alice Munro along with local church members. The school board voted to ban &quot;The Diviners&quot; from the five high schools within its jurisdiction because of sexual references and objectionable language. This event prompted the Book and Periodical Council of Canada to form a Freedom of Expression Committee later that year and was the driving factor behind a library-driven Freedom to Read week, which continues to occur across Ontario libraries.

==Demographics==
==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===
Clinton is at the junction of Highway 4 (Victoria Street), Highway 8 (Huron Street and Ontario Street) and County Road 4 (Albert Street).

Catholic education is the responsibility of the Huron-Perth Catholic District School Board, who manage St. Anne&#x27;s Catholic Secondary School and St. Joseph&#x27;s Catholic School (elementary). Due to Clinton&#x27;s central location in the county, most students are bused into the schools from surrounding areas. Huron Christian School is a private school offering Christian education for students from kindergarten to grade eight.

The School On Wheels, a school car that visited remote Northern Ontario communities to educate children who would otherwise not have access to school, is permanently on display in Clinton as a museum about education.

<doc id="783378" wikidata="Q500101" url="?curid=783378" title="The Wonder Stuff">
<text>The Wonder Stuff are a British alternative rock band. Originally based in Stourbridge in the West Midlands, England, the band&#x27;s first lineup released four albums and nearly 20 singles and EPs, enjoying considerable chart and live success in the UK. The band have continued to tour and record since 2000.

Largely the vehicle for the songwriting of Miles Hunt, the band split up with a farewell performance as headliners of the 1994 Phoenix Festival, but reformed in 2000 and have toured and recorded since then, with Hunt the anchor member of all line-ups.

Known for their catchy songs and Hunt&#x27;s sharp lyrics, the band&#x27;s sound evolved from guitar pop to include sampling and elements of folk and country. The band - and Hunt in particular — were favourites of the UK music press, and were often associated with fellow Black Country acts Ned&#x27;s Atomic Dustbin and Pop Will Eat Itself, with whom they have toured throughout their careers.

The band scored one UK number 1 single, their release of &quot;Dizzy&quot; with comedian Vic Reeves, 17 top-20 single hits, and three top-10 albums in the UK. The band also toured internationally, and achieved some success in the United States, where they had six songs on the Billboard Alternative Songs Chart.

==History==

===Origins and &quot;The Eight Legged Groove Machine&quot; (1986–1989)===
The original line-up of Miles Hunt (whose uncle Bill Hunt was keyboard player with ELO and Wizzard) on vocals and guitar; Malcolm Treece on guitar and vocals; bassist Rob &quot;The Bass Thing&quot; Jones (died July 1993); and Martin Gilks (died April 2006) on drums grew from Hunt and Treece&#x27;s collaboration with future members of Pop Will Eat Itself in a band called From Eden that featured Hunt on drums.

The Wonder Stuff were formed on 19 March 1986 (their name reportedly came from a remark made about a very young Hunt by John Lennon) and in September that year recorded a self-financed debut EP, &quot;A Wonderful Day&quot;. After finding management with Birmingham promoter Les Johnson and signing with Polydor Records for £80,000 in 1987, the group released a series of singles including &quot;Unbearable&quot;, &quot;Give Give Give, Me More More More&quot;, &quot;A Wish Away&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s Yer Money I&#x27;m After Baby&quot; (their first Top 40 entry) that featured on their debut album &quot;The Eight Legged Groove Machine&quot;, which was released in August 1988 (UK No. 18). This preceded a first headlining nineteen-date national tour, &#x27;Groovers on Manoeuvres&#x27;.

A non-album single, &quot;Who Wants to Be the Disco King?&quot; was released in March 1989 and was followed by UK, European, and United States tours and appearances at the Reading and Glastonbury festivals.

&quot;Melody Maker&quot; made &quot;The Eight Legged Groove Machine&quot; one of their albums of the year for 1988, judging it, &quot;A rollicking debut from the only band with enough wit, energy, charisma and acumen to cross over from loutish grebo into raffish pop.&quot;

===&quot;Hup&quot; (1989–1990)===
In September 1989, &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Me Down, Gently&quot;, with its slick, American-shot video, became the Wonder Stuff&#x27;s first Top-20 hit, heralding the release of second album, &quot;Hup,&quot; in October (UK No. 5). The album saw the introduction of new band member, Martin Bell, a multi-instrumentalist who contributed violin and banjo, most notably on &quot;Golden Green&quot; (the second single from the album), &quot;Unfaithful&quot; and &quot;Cartoon Boyfriend&quot;. Several shows during the band&#x27;s 1989 tour featured fellow Black Country acts Ned&#x27;s Atomic Dustbin and The Sandkings as opening acts.

Jones left the band in December 1989, moving to the United States.

A single, &quot;Circlesquare&quot;, was released shortly afterwards, just before Paul Clifford replaced Jones on the bass in the Spring of 1990. This led to a string of live outings for the renewed line-up in mid-1990.

With only one single release in 1990 and no album yet ready, the band put out &quot;Eleven Appalling Promos&quot;, a collection of video promos, with home video footage showing Hunt, Treece and Gilks giving their (usually critical) commentary between each song. In December the group celebrated their Brit Award nomination by turning down an invitation to the awards show at Wembley Arena, to play at Minsthorpe High School in South Elmsall in response to a fan&#x27;s letter: a cover version of John Lennon&#x27;s &quot;Gimme Some Truth&quot;, recorded at the show, was included on the &quot;Caught in My Shadow&quot; single.

===&quot;Never Loved Elvis&quot; and chart success (1990–1992)===
Recording for a third album was started in late 1990 and completed early the following year. The first single from the new album was &quot;The Size of a Cow&quot;. Released in March 1991 it became the band&#x27;s first Top-10 hit, reaching No. 5, (and being nominated for a Brit Award for its video). It was swiftly followed by &quot;Caught in My Shadow&quot; (UK No. 18) in May, before the release of the album &quot;Never Loved Elvis&quot; in May 1991 (UK No. 3).

After the album release, the band performed a first headlining stadium show at Walsall&#x27;s Bescot Stadium, attracting 18,000 fans, before embarking on a world tour taking in the UK, Europe and the US. For the tour, the band was augmented by keyboardist Peter Whittaker.

Just after the third single from the album, &quot;Sleep Alone&quot; in September, the group scored a commercial success when they covered Tommy Roe&#x27;s &quot;Dizzy&quot; with Vic Reeves in 1991, reaching the top of the UK Singles Chart for two weeks in November. The band carried on touring into 1992. They released the single &quot;Welcome to the Cheap Seats&quot; (UK No. 8) in February, which was also the title of their video rockumentary released that Spring after eighteen months of filming on the road with the band.

Touring continued through the latter part of the year, with more dates in the United States (both as headliners and supporting Siouxsie and the Banshees) backed by an appearance on &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot;, performing &quot;Welcome to the Cheap Seats&quot;. A further UK tour was complemented with a headlining slot at the 1992 Reading Festival.

===&quot;Construction for the Modern Idiot&quot; (1993–1994)===
After previewing their new material at a few European summer festivals, a new single &quot;On the Ropes&quot; (UK No. 10) was released in September 1993 followed by the album &quot;Construction for the Modern Idiot&quot; in October 1993 (UK No. 4). Another single &quot;Full of Life (Happy Now)&quot; came out just before Christmas. The band toured Europe before going to the United States in February 1994. A third single &quot;Hot Love Now&quot; (UK No. 19) was released in time for the UK tour in March and, by the time the tour - called &#x27;Idiot Manoeuvres&#x27; - came to an end, it was the longest in the band&#x27;s history with seventy eight dates since the album&#x27;s release.

===Band split and solo projects (1994–2000)===
A planned tour of the Far East and Australia in May was cancelled. The band made no public announcement at that time but a split was announced in June in a fanclub newsletter.

The Wonder Stuff performed the final contracted show on 15 July 1994 as headliners at the Phoenix Festival near Stratford-on-Avon in front of an audience of 30,000. In September, an 18-song compilation &quot;If The Beatles Had Read Hunter...The Singles&quot; (UK No. 8), a re-issue of the &quot;Unbearable&quot; single (UK No. 16), and a video of their farewell performance from July were released. The &quot;Live in Manchester&quot; album (recorded in December 1991) was released in July 1995.

During the hiatus between 1994 and 2000, Hunt was involved in several projects. He hosted MTV Europe&#x27;s &quot;120 Minutes&quot; show. He then put together another band, Vent 414, with ex-Senseless Things bassist Morgan Nicholls and later Clash, Eat and Wonder Stuff drummer Peter Howard. They released a self-titled debut album in October 1996, but were soon dropped by Polydor prior to the release of the second album. Hunt started to tour as a solo artist, travelling to the US with Malc Treece, and releasing two albums: &quot;Miles Across America&quot;, an album of new material, Wonder Stuff tracks and Vent 414 material all reworked for the acoustic guitar, and a live acoustic album &quot;By the Time I Got to Jersey&quot; (1998). A full studio album, &quot;Hairy on the Inside&quot; (again featuring Treece and another fellow Wonder Stuff member Martin Bell) was released in April 1999, followed by &quot;The Miles Hunt Club&quot; in April 2002.

Meanwhile, Treece, Clifford and Gilks formed We Know Where You Live (originally titled WeKnowWhereYouLive), with Ange Dolittle from Eat. They gigged extensively throughout 1995 and 1996 and released two EPs before splitting.

===Reformation and &quot;Escape from Rubbish Island&quot; (2000–2005)===

Hunt, Treece, Gilks, Bell and Whittaker, together with new bassist Stuart Quinell, reformed for a one-off concert at London&#x27;s Forum in December 2000. This soon became five sold-out nights, preceded by two nights of shows at JB&#x27;s in Dudley (the site of their debut gig). The group&#x27;s previous four studio albums were reissued with bonus tracks, and a compilation of b-sides, demos and live tracks, &quot;Love Bites &amp; Bruises&quot; was released in November.

More live performances continued into 2001 with the release of a live album &quot;Cursed with Insincerity&quot; in June, and more concerts came in 2002. A DVD release, &quot;Construction for the Modern Vidiot&quot;, in May 2003 featured highlights from the 2000 to 2002 shows, and then a further tour was announced in December 2003.

In early 2004, Hunt was informed that Gilks and Bell would no longer work with him, and thus The Wonder Stuff (in the eyes of Gilks and Bell) were defunct. As a result, Quinell and Whittaker were informed the band had split, and Hunt began work on a new record with Mark McCarthy (ex-Radical Dance Faction) and Luke Johnson (ex-Amen and son of one-time Wonder Stuff manager, Les Johnson). Sessions for this new solo record were later joined by Malc Treece. The result of this was The Wonder Stuff&#x27;s first new album for over a decade, &quot;Escape from Rubbish Island&quot;, which was released in September 2004 with &quot;Better Get Ready for a Fist Fight&quot; and the title track becoming singles. Andres Karu (who had previously worked with Miles as part of The Miles Hunt Club) replaced Luke Johnson on drums. The band toured the UK and US in 2004 and 2005, and were joined by violinist Erica Nockalls in March 2005.

===&quot;Suspended by Stars&quot; and anniversary tours (2006–2011)===
This line-up continued into 2006 for the release of their new album &quot;Suspended by Stars&quot; in March and the single &quot;Blah Blah La Di Dah&quot; available as a download. The band toured in March 2006 to support the record and in conjunction with their twentieth anniversary.

In April 2006, original Wonder Stuff drummer Martin Gilks was killed in a motorcycle accident in London. An album of We Know Where You Live&#x27;s demo recordings and live tracks was released in December 2006, with all profits being donated to a charitable concern at the request of Gilk&#x27;s parents. In 2006, Miles Hunt&#x27;s acoustic shows were recorded for a live album, titled &quot;Interloper&quot; and released in October 2006. The Wonder Stuff also began mixing a live record documenting the 2006 concerts and played several UK outdoor shows. The band finished the year by touring the UK again, performing their final show of the year on 8 December at the Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Empire.

Following this, the band went on hiatus due to Treece starting a family. Hunt released the solo album &quot;Not an Exit&quot; in 2007, which featured Nockalls and Karu; Hunt toured the UK twice, and the US later in the year. Before recording the album, he expected the band to be working on their own album at some point during the year.

In 2008, the Wonder Stuff entered into a deal with the Carling Academy Group where the band would play their first two studio albums, &quot;The Eight Legged Groove Machine&quot; and &quot;Hup&quot;, in full over the course of several shows. Hunt and Treece were confident about the prospect, while the other members of the band who didn&#x27;t play on either album, had a large workload ahead of them. Hunt came up with the idea of having the band re-recording both albums, which were later released as &quot;The Eight Legged Groove Machine: 20th Anniversary Edition&quot; (2008) and &quot;Hup: 21st Anniversary Edition&quot; (2010). In between the two releases, Hunt and Nockalls released the album &quot;Catching More Than We Miss&quot; in early 2009.

Karu left the band in late 2010 to focus on being a cameraman; he was forced to turn down several opportunities in the US while touring the UK with the band. As Hunt lived in South Shropshire, he would often see Fuzz Townshend of Pop Will Eat Itself at local pubs. Hunt asked him if he would drum for the Wonder Stuff, which he agreed to. In 2011, the band toured the UK to celebrate the 20th anniversary of their third studio album &quot;Never Loved Elvis&quot; (1991). Prior to the shows taking place, Treece left the band after an argument between himself and Hunt. Hunt&#x27;s main concern with Treece was due to him making zero effort to write potential new song ideas; Jerry DeBorg of Jesus Jones filled in his position.

===&quot;Oh No It&#x27;s... The Wonder Stuff&quot; to &quot;Better Being Lucky&quot; (2012–present)===
Hunt and Townshend both had home studios, the former&#x27;s centred around programming and rock instruments, while the latter&#x27;s was focussed on recording drums. The pair planned to record drums at Townshend, and record other instruments and vocals at Hunt&#x27;s. With a lack of new material at their disposal, the pair opted to do a covers album of artists from the Midlands, dubbed &quot;From the Midlands with Love&quot;. The cover recordings were released in three instalments between April and November 2012. The project gave Hunt and Townshend a lot of experience when it came to recording at home; Hunt was adamant about producing the band&#x27;s next album. &quot;Oh No It&#x27;s... The Wonder Stuff&quot; was recorded at The Wain House and The Beeches in South Shropshire, with Hunt acting as producer. The band also toured the UK in April 2013, summer shows, and a Sleigh the UK set of shows in December 2013.

In December 2013 the band&#x27;s track &quot;A Wish Away&quot; was used in a TV commercial for the holiday company Hoseasons.

Following a successful Australian tour in early 2014, drummer Fuzz Townshend left the group to concentrate on his work with The Beat. In May 2014 the band announced a new line-up with Hunt, Nockalls and McCarthy being joined by Dan Donnelly on guitar and Tony Arthy on drums, with Arthy having parted company with Jesus Jones. Arthy had previously worked with Hunt in an earlier, but unreleased incarnation of The Miles Hunt Club in 2001.

In March 2016, a PledgeMusic-funded album, &quot;30 Goes Around the Sun&quot;, was released to celebrate 30 years since the band&#x27;s very first rehearsal in the heart of The Black Country. This coincided with a UK tour during March and April. This album became their first studio release to enter the Top 40 since 1994.

In 2019, the band announced a new lineup, with founder member Malc Treece returning on guitar replacing Donnelly, Pete Howard of The Clash replacing Arthy on drums, and former The Mission guitarist Mark Thwaite replacing McCarthy on bass. After a short tour at the start of the year, the group announced they would be releasing a new album &quot;Better Being Lucky&quot; towards the end of 2019, featuring several songs co-written by Thwaite on guitar, which would be followed by a tour where the group would play &quot;The Eight Legged Groove Machine&quot; and &quot;Hup&quot; albums in full alongside other tracks from their back catalogue and the new album. Thwaite moved to guitar on the live shows promoting the new album with Tim Sewell taking over bass duties.

<text>State Road 13 (SR 13) is a north–south state road in the US state of Indiana. The southern terminus is at an intersection with U.S. Highway 36 (US 36) and SR 67, in the town of Fortville, and its northern terminus is at the Michigan state line. At its northern end, signage for SR 13 ends at the interchange with the Indiana Toll Road; the highway continues unsigned for an additional running concurrently with US 131 to the state line. The state road runs through six counties in central and north-central Indiana mostly through rural farm fields and small towns.

Dating back to the early days of the state road system, SR 13 was first signed in the eastern and northeastern part of the state. It was moved to its modern routing in 1931, running in two segments with the southern end in Indianapolis and the northern end at the Michigan state line. During the late 1930s, SR 13 was moved onto its modern routing in far southern Elkhart County. The southern end was moved from Indianapolis to Greenfield in the late 1930s or early 1940s. The north–south concurrency with US 33 was added in the early 1970s and the southern terminus was moved to Fortville in the mid-to-late 1970s.

==History==
SR 13 originated with an old Indian trail. This was part of the route that Eastern settlers, having crossed the lakes to Detroit, used after they disembarked to travel south into Indiana. In the early days, SR 13 was called the &quot;Logansport–White Pigeon Road&quot;.

SR 13 prior to 1926 was designated between SR 3, now US 40, and the Michigan state line, north of Angola. Between 1926 and 1931 the SR 13 designated went unused, but during this time frame the modern route of SR 13 between Wabash and North Manchester was part of SR 15. In 1931 SR 13 was commissioned in two segments with the first routed between Indianapolis and SR 2, now US 33, near Benton. The second segment at that time went from US 20, in Middlebury, to Michigan state line, north of Middlebury. During 1932 SR 13 was routed southeast on SR 2 and north on a newly designated roadway, passing through Millersburg, to US 20. This made SR 13 one continuous from Indianapolis to the Michigan state line. Between 1932 and 1933 SR 15 was moved west to its modern route with the small segment between SR 13 and SR 114 west of North Manchester becoming SR 213. SR 13 moved onto its modern route following US 6 and a new north–south road, now the US 33 concurrency, between 1938 and 1939. Also in this time frame the former route of SR 13 between US 6 and US 33, became part of SR 313. Between 1939 and 1941 the road between Indianapolis and the south end of the modern SR 13 and SR 37 concurrency was renumber to SR 37. During this time frame SR 13 was extended south from the south end of the modern SR 13 and 37 concurrency to Greenfield. SR 13 was rerouted on its modern route bypassing North Manchester between 1947 and 1948, replacing SR 213 and along a new roadway. The last segment of roadway to be paved was the segment of SR 13 between I-69 and SR 132 and it was completed between 1969 and 1970. US 33 was rerouted onto its modern concurrency with SR 13, between 1970 and 1971. The southern end was moved to Fortville from Greenfield between 1976 and 1977.

Situated conveniently by the coast, and engulfing also a small river, the lands of Pernå were attractive at a time when waterways rather than proper roads provided the means of transport. There are a number of manor houses in the Pernå area - most notably Sarvlaks manor, which dates back to the 1450s - at a time when Finland was a part of Sweden.

The origin of the name &quot;Pernå&quot; is uncertain; some think it links with the Uralic word &quot;Pern&quot; meaning lime- or lindentree. &quot;Å&quot; is Swedish for a small river, i.e. the name then being Lindenriver if translated.

On 1 January 2010 Pernå was amalgamated with Loviisa, Ruotsinpyhtää and Liljendal to form a new municipality of Loviisa.

<text>Pertunmaa () is a former municipality of Finland located in the Southern Savonia region. The municipality was merged to the municipality of Mäntyharju on 1 January 2025.

The municipality had a population of 1,541 and covered an area of 454.20 km2 (175.37 sq mi) of which 79.7 km2 (30.8 sq mi) was water. The population density was 4.12/km2 (10.7/sq mi). The language of the municipality was Finnish.

Neighbour municipalities were Hartola, Heinola, Hirvensalmi, Mäntyharju and Joutsa. Pertunmaa became an independent municipality in 1926 when it was separated from Mäntyharju. Hartola&#x27;s old wooden church was moved to Pertunmaa and it was inaugurated in 1927.

Due to the long-lasting economic difficulties, Pertunmaa was incorporated into Mäntyharju on January 1, 2025.

==Culture==

It&#x27;s said that Pertunmaa&#x27;s culture is mixed with two regions: Southern Savonia and Päijänne Tavastia. Also, &quot;Itä-Häme&quot; (literally &quot;East Tavastia&quot;) newspaper is also distributed in Pertunmaa.

According to a common legend in the locality, Pertunmaa is named after a man called Perttu, who once ruled the whole of Pertunmaa (literally the &quot;land of Perttu&quot;) alone. The coat of arms of the municipality, the explanation of which is “a golden flame in a red field with a black ear,” has its origins in the slash-and-burn cultivation in ancient times. The coat of arms, designed by Tapio Vallioja, was approved at a meeting of the Pertunmaa Municipal Council on April 14, 1965, and the coat of arms was officially approved for use by the Ministry of the Interior on July 1 of that year.

In the 1980s, blodpalt called &quot;Kisko&quot;, and &quot;Rieska&quot; breads baked from rye flour, cream and sour cream, which are baked with cabbage leaves, were named Pertunmaa&#x27;s traditional dishes.
==Villages==
Pertunmaa&#x27;s church village (&quot;Pertunmaan kirkonkylä&quot;) and Kuortti are the largest and most populous villages of the municipality.

Other smaller villages are Hartosenpää, Hölttä, Joutsjärvi, Karankamäki, Kirkonkylä, Koirakivi, Kuhajärvi, Kälkyttä, Lihavanpää, Mansikkamäki, Nipuli, Ruorasmäki, Ruuttila, Sydänmaa and Vastamäki.

<text>The Alliance of Free Democrats – Hungarian Liberal Party (, , SZDSZ ) was a liberal political party in Hungary.

The SZDSZ was a member of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party and of Liberal International. It drew its support predominantly from Budapest among the middle classes, liberal intellectuals and entrepreneurs, with an ideological basis in social and economic liberalism. SZDSZ provided the first freely elected President for the Third Hungarian Republic, Árpád Göncz. The SZDSZ High Mayor of Budapest, Gábor Demszky was in office continuously since 1990 till 2010, when he was replaced by István Tarlós (who himself was a member of SZDSZ in the 1990s).

==History==
The party&#x27;s origins lay in the illegal democratic opposition under the communist rule of János Kádár. This gave rise to the loosely organized Network of Free Initiatives (&quot;Szabad Kezdeményezések Hálózata&quot;) on 1 May 1988 and to the foundation of the SZDSZ as an opposition political party on 13 November 1988. Its founding leaders included János Kis, Márton Tardos, Gáspár Miklós Tamás, and Miklós Haraszti.

The party initially suggested a radical agenda for changing the political, social and economic system in the country. It suffered a close defeat at the first free general elections of the Third Republic in 1990, thus becoming the leading opposition force in the first free National Assembly (Hungary&#x27;s parliament).

After the fall of the conservative Hungarian Democratic Forum-led government at the following 1994 parliamentary election, SZDSZ surprised many by entering into a coalition with the Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP), the legal successor party to the communist Hungarian Socialist Workers Party. Thus began a strategic alliance between the two parties that lasted for 14 years, ending only in 2008. The coalition successfully defeated Orbán&#x27;s Fidesz in 1994, 2002 and 2006.

The heyday of the SZDSZ may be thought to have ended when it suffered heavy losses in the 1998 parliamentary election. In 2002 parliamentary election, it gained only 5.5 percent of the vote, returning 20 deputies to the National Assembly.

Until its withdrawal from the coalition in May 2008, the SZDSZ had three portfolios. It also had a delegation in the European Parliament, receiving 7.7 percent of the Hungarian vote and two MEPs in the 2004 European Parliament election.

In the 2006 parliamentary election, it gained no directly elected seats, but 6.5 percent of the list votes, thus securing 20 members in Hungary&#x27;s 386-seat National Assembly. This was the first time that the party managed to increase its support compared with a previous general election. The MSZP–SZDSZ coalition had a small majority in the new National Assembly intake.

On 31 March 2008, various reform-related disagreements between the MSZP and SZDSZ led the SZDSZ leader János Kóka to announce that his party would exit the coalition by 1 May 2008. This also meant that the MSZP would have to form the first minority government in Hungary since the change of regime in 1989.

However, the legitimacy of Kóka&#x27;s position as party president became questioned when it was discovered that some signatures of the delegates to the assembly electing him had been forged. Since he had won his position by a very small margin over Fodor, these votes might have changed the outcome. So a new leadership election was held in June and Fodor was returned.

In the 2009 European Parliament election, SZDSZ retained none of its seats with just 2.2 percent of the total vote, less than half of the minimum five percent needed to secure representation. The party did not even receive five percent in Budapest, its traditional stronghold. Party president Fodor offered his resignation as soon as the official tally was announced at 10:00 p.m.

In the 2010 parliamentary election, SZDSZ won only 0.25 percent of the vote and was shut out of the legislature altogether for the first time since the change of regime. The party was even unable to gain parliamentary seats in Budapest. The Alliance of Free Democrats officially ceased to exist in October 2013. A few months prior their official dissolution the Hungarian Liberal Party was formed.

==Political positions==

The party has been described as fiscally moderate and socially compassionate. It supported same-sex marriage, euthanasia, the legalization of marijuana, higher taxes on corporations and the top 1%, lower taxes for the working class and middle class, creation of a universal basic income, increasing the minimum wage, stronger borders and eliminating illegal immigration, increasing legal immigration by 2% and ending compulsory military service.

<doc id="783447" wikidata="Q246632" url="?curid=783447" title="Oswaldtwistle">
<text>Oswaldtwistle ( &quot;ozwel twizzel&quot;) is a town in the Hyndburn borough of Lancashire, England, southeast of Blackburn, contiguous with Accrington. The town has a rich industrial heritage, being home to James Hargreaves, inventor of the spinning jenny, and Robert &quot;Parsley&quot; Peel of calico printing fame. The Leeds and Liverpool Canal passes through the town and was responsible for the export of much of the area&#x27;s cotton produce.

At the 2011 census, it had a population of 11,803. In 2021 the population had decreased to 10,815 

==History==
The name is derived from &quot;Oswald&quot; and &quot;Twistle&quot;. The word &quot;twistle&quot; is an old English word meaning &quot;brooks meet&quot;. Legend has it that Saint Oswald, King of Northumbria passed through, giving the area its full title of Oswald&#x27;s Twistle, which in time came to be Oswaldtwistle. However, it is more likely derived from the name of the Anglo-Saxon who farmed the land.

===The Peel family===
Robert Peel was born at Peelfold (within the township) in 1723, and laid the family fortunes by innovations in calico printing. A particularly successful pattern featured a sprig of parsley, so Robert Peel became known as &quot;Parsley Peel&quot;. Robert Peel went into business with his Brother-in-law, Jonathan Haworth in 1760, establishing the Brookside Mill Calico Works, the remnants of which are still visible in Bury Meadow Nature Reserve.

The soubriquet helps distinguish him from his son also Robert Peel, who was born at Peelfold in 1750 and went on to become a successful cotton mill owner (with large works at Bury and Burton on Trent), a very rich man, an MP and a Baronet.

Sir Robert&#x27;s son (Parsley Peel&#x27;s grandson), born at Bury, was yet another Robert Peel and in due course Sir Robert Peel; he was a full-time politician and rose to be Prime Minister. Another historical figure associated with the textile industry was James Hargreaves, inventor of the Spinning Jenny.

===Power loom riots===

The people of Oswaldtwistle were involved in the power loom riots of 1826. The mechanisation of the textile industry (with the introduction of looms powered by steam engines from the 1820s onwards) resulted in redundancies, low wages, and hunger. On 26 April, a large number of cotton workers attacked the factory in White Ash (Brookside Mill) in Oswaldtwistle, about a mile from Hargreaves&#x27; workshop, destroying looms and other equipment. The riots went on for three days, extending to all cotton towns in central Lancashire.

===Coal===
Oswaldtwistle is part of the Burnley Coalfield and had a number of coal mines such as Aspen Colliery next the canal and the East Lancashire line, having both a canal basin and railway siding. Mining here is thought to have commenced in the early 19th century and the colliery closed in 1930. The remains of the site which includes two stone-built engine beds and a bank of 24 beehive type coke ovens are protected as a scheduled monument.

Others in the hills to the south, include: Broadfield Colliery which in the 1840s had a surface tramroad connected to the printworks at Foxhill Bank via Moscow Mills; Sough Lane Colliery which had a tramroad connecting it to Knuzden; And Town Bent Colliery .

===PoW camps===
During World War II, a number of PoWs (particularly Italians) were interned in camps near Oswaldtwistle.

==Governance==

Oswaldtwistle was once a township in the ancient parish of Whalley, covering Oswaldtwistle Moor in the south and with Knuzden Brook forming the boundary with Blackburn, and as far as the village of Belthorn. The township became a civil parish in 1866.

Between 1894 and 1974, the area was administered by an urban district. It has since become an unparished part of the borough of Hyndburn. Oswaldtwistle Town Hall was completed in 1891.

==Economy==
It is important to note the contribution of Alfred N. Waterhouse in Oswaldtwistle. In the 1940s, he created what became Shopfitters Lancashire Ltd and in the 1950s, the firm moved from Accrington to Rhyddings Mill, Oswaldtwistle. He was a very successful entrepreneur who manufactured the shopfittings. At its peak in the 1960s, Shopfitters (Lancashire) Ltd employed over 80 salesmen nationally, and had an annual turnover measured in millions, in an age when a new house cost about £3,000. The firm closed in the 1980s.

The town centre is home to a number of high street multiples. There are a number of independent businesses in the town. Other stores include an appliance repairs/sales, numerous takeaways, numerous barbers, estate agents, off licences, bakers, butchers, funeral directors and many more shops. There are several Boys&#x27; Brigade/Girl&#x27;s Brigade groups in the town, along with groups for Scouts, Beavers and Cubs. Additionally, &quot;Hyndburn Comets&quot;, a group of majorettes, exists in the town.

==Landmarks==
===Oswaldtwistle Moor===

Oswaldtwistle Moor (adjacent to Haslingden Moor) is an extensive area of moorland to the south of Oswaldtwistle, with Haslingden Grane bordering the moor&#x27;s southern edges, Belthorn to the west and Haslingden to the east. The area forms part of the West Pennine Moors.

The moors are used for annual fell running events: Ossy Moors Fell Race and Stanhill Fell Race, which has been run since 1995.

In May 2007, plans were made to build a wind farm consisting of twelve wind turbines on the moors. This attracted both support and opposition, but the plan was approved by councillors in March 2010. In October 2012, the project was officially completed, and was called the &quot;Hyndburn Wind Farm&quot;.

===Oswaldtwistle Mills===
Oswaldtwistle Mills is a notable attraction; a textile mill converted into a craft fair and with an exhibition about life in the mill a hundred years ago. It is also home of the world&#x27;s largest pear drop, made by Stockley&#x27;s Sweets.

===Civic Arts Centre and Theatre===

Also of note is the 457 capacity, recently refurbished, Civic Theatre, known as the &quot;Friendly Theatre&quot; and the brand new Civic Arts Centre. The ground floor was refurbished, and in August 2010, it opened as the &quot;Civic Arts Centre&quot;.

The first production performed at the Arts Centre was &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, directed by young producer, Joanne Haworth. Since then, there have been many productions, with something different happening every week. There are workshops, and drama sessions most evenings, plus projects and new plays, being written, and performed, with at least four plays in production, at any one time. The Centre is now home to a number of theatre groups, including ReAct Academy, Dramatic Annie, Sparks, Oswaldtwistle Players and St Mary&#x27;s Panto among others. The theatre now has a professional production company that produces shows that are toured around Lancashire.

The Civic Arts Centre is involved in local heritage projects, and organises outdoor festivals. From 1 April 2015, the &quot;Arts Centre&quot; &amp; &quot;Theatre&quot; merged, and the building is now known as the Civic Arts Centre and Theatre. It is home to Manford&#x27;s Comedy Clubs. Jason Manford and John Bishop have both performed there at Manford&#x27;s Comedy evenings.

===Rhyddings Park===
Rhyddings Park is the only formal park within Oswaldtwistle. It was originally the grounds of a private house belonging to a local mill owning family. It has been a public park since 1909. More information about Rhyddings Park can be found on the website of its active community group. 

===Oswaldtwistle Carnival===
The carnival is held every two years. The committee was formed in June 2014, after a sixteen year gap, and the first event was successfully held that summer.

==Education==
Oswaldtwistle is home to Rhyddings (secondary school), Hippings Methodist Primary School, St. Mary&#x27;s RC Primary School, St. Paul&#x27;s CE Primary School, Moor End Primary School, St. Andrew&#x27;s CE Primary School, West End Primary School, Oswaldtwistle School (a PRU), and White Ash Specialist School.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC North West and ITV Granada. Television signals are received from the Winter Hill TV transmitter and the local relay TV transmitter located in the Forest of Pendle.

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Lancashire, Capital Manchester and Lancashire (formerly 2BR), Heart North West, Smooth North West, Greatest Hits Radio Lancashire, and Central Radio.

The town is served by the local newspaper, &quot;Lancashire Telegraph&quot;.

==Sport==
Oswaldtwistle Rovers F.C. were a football team in the late 19th century; they managed to reach the second round of the FA Cup in 1885.

<doc id="783466" wikidata="Q1255425" url="?curid=783466" title="Paul Dresser">
<text>Paul Dresser (born Johann Paul Dreiser Jr.; April 22, 1857 – January 30, 1906) was an American singer, songwriter, and comedic actor of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Dresser performed in traveling minstrel and medicine-wagon shows and as a vaudeville entertainer for decades, before transitioning to music publishing later in life. His biggest hit, &quot;On the Banks of the Wabash, Far Away&quot; (1897), was the best selling song of its time. Although Dresser had no formal training in music composition, he wrote ballads that had wide appeal, including some of the most popular songs of the era. During a career that spanned nearly two decades, from 1886 to 1906, Dresser composed and published more than 150 songs. Following the success of &quot;Wabash&quot;, many newspapers compared Dresser to popular composer Stephen Foster. &quot;On the Banks of the Wabash, Far Away&quot; became the official song of Indiana in 1913. The Paul Dresser Birthplace in Terre Haute is designated as a state shrine and memorial. Dresser was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1970.

Dresser grew up in a large family (including his brother, novelist Theodore Dreiser) and lived in Sullivan and Terre Haute, Indiana. He had a troubled childhood and spent time in jail. Dresser left home at age sixteen to join a traveling minstrel act and performed in several regional theaters before joining John Hamlin&#x27;s Wizard Oil traveling medicine-wagon show in 1878. Dresser composed his first songs while working for Hamlin. He settled in Evansville, Indiana, for several years while continuing to work as a traveling performer and musician. Eventually, he became a nationally known talent and participated in several traveling acts, including &quot;The Two Johns&quot;, &quot;A Tin Soldier&quot;, and &quot;The Danger Signal&quot;. Dresser&#x27;s songwriting talent developed during his years as a performer; he began by writing songs featured in his shows and later wrote and sold songs to others&#x27; acts. Dresser moved to New York City, and in 1893 Dresser joined Tin Pan Alley&#x27;s Howley, Haviland and Company, a New York City sheet music publisher, as a silent partner. At the height of his success, Dresser was a nationally known entertainer, successful songwriter, and sheet music publisher. He was generous, especially to family and friends, and a lavish spender. The turn of the century brought him financial distress when his music fell out of style. In 1905 his music publishing business declared bankruptcy. He died the following year.

==Early life==

===Family background===
Paul Dresser was born Johann Paul Dreiser Jr. on April 22, 1858, in Terre Haute, Indiana, the fourth son of Johann Paul and Sarah Mary Schanab Dreiser. By the age of twenty he had changed his surname to Dresser. His father, a German immigrant from Mayen, was a weaver and dyer who eventually became the manager of a woolen mill in Indiana. Dresser&#x27;s mother, born near Dayton, Ohio, was a Mennonite who was disowned after her elopement and marriage. After Dresser&#x27;s three older brothers died in infancy, he became the eldest of the family&#x27;s ten surviving children. One of Dresser&#x27;s sisters nicknamed him &quot;Pudley&quot; because of his &quot;chubbiness.&quot; Dresser&#x27;s younger brother, Theodore Dreiser, would become a noted author.

In July 1863 the family moved to Sullivan, Indiana, where Dresser&#x27;s father became foreman of the newly opened Sullivan Woolen Mills. Although his father worked in other woolen mills in Ohio and Indiana, he was not a successful businessman or manager of a mill. During Dresser&#x27;s youth the family struggled with periods of poverty and misfortune. In 1865 Dresser&#x27;s father temporarily lost his job after a fire destroyed the Sullivan mill; a year later he suffered a work-related head injury. In 1867 his father and two partners purchased and operated a new mill, but the business lost its roof in a storm and the men sold it for a loss. As a young boy living in Sullivan, Dresser may have seen his first minstrel groups and medicine-wagon shows. The town was frequented by bands that played many of the era&#x27;s popular and patriotic songs at numerous carnivals, festivals, circuses, and fairs. By 1871 Dresser&#x27;s family had returned to Terre Haute, where his father secured a job in another woolen mill.

===Education and rebellion===
About 1870, Dresser&#x27;s father, a devout Catholic and known for his &quot;religious zealotry&quot; according to his son Theodore, sent his eldest son to St. Meinrad Seminary in southern Indiana to study for the priesthood. While living with his family in Sullivan, Dresser was befriended by Father Herman Joseph Alerding, a local priest who was a St. Meinrad graduate. Alerding may have taught Dresser to play brass musical instruments and influenced the decision to send Dresser to seminary school. Dresser quickly found the Benedictine seminary too strict and confining and decided to leave. Dresser would later claim to have gotten into trouble with the priests for teaching the younger boys &quot;tricks of various kinds.&quot;

Although his family had moved to Terre Haute, Dresser returned to Sullivan after he left St. Meinrad. He stayed with family friends while working on local farms during the summer of 1871 through the summer of 1872. The fourteen-year-old Dresser then returned to Terre Haute and worked a series of odd jobs to help support his family. Dresser continued his education at the St. Bonaventure Lyceum academy in Terre Haute and took piano lessons from a local music teacher, his only formal musical training. During this time the relationship between Dresser and his father quickly deteriorated and the teen may have had run-ins with the local police. Whatever the reason, Dresser returned to Sullivan to work on a friend&#x27;s farm, away from the city.

After his return to Terre Haute in 1874, Dresser and his father resumed their hostile relationship. Dresser also resumed to his old habits of spending time with delinquents and drinking. At age sixteen Dresser took a job as a teacher and musician at a Catholic church in Brazil, Indiana, but left after less than a year. Shortly thereafter, Charley Kelly, a traveling minstrel, hired Dresser to join his act as a piano player. The two traveled around southern Indiana, playing wherever they could to earn a meager income. After a few months, Kelly disappeared with their money during a show, leaving Dresser with no funds to pay their lodging or food bills. Dresser spent two days in jail as punishment. After his release Dresser went to Indianapolis in search of work and was reunited with his mentor, Father Alerding, who had been recently moved to the city. Although Dresser was only a teen, Alerding gave him a job as a teacher at St. Joseph Catholic Church. In 1876, after he had taught for a full year, Dresser returned to his family in Terre Haute. Almost immediately he resumed his old way of life and spent most of his savings on liquor at a local bar. As his money ran low, Dresser turned to crime, robbing two saloons of whiskey and cash after they had closed for the night. Dresser was jailed for ten weeks before his trial, convicted, fined, and sentenced to another month of jail time. Released in June 1876, Dresser, who was not yet twenty years old, returned to his parents&#x27; home in disgrace.

==Musical career==

===Early career===
In 1876 Dresser secured a job as an organist and singer with the Lemon Brothers, a traveling minstrel group from Marshall, Illinois. Dresser stayed with the group for more than a year, performing as an actor and singer, before they disbanded near the end of 1877. Next, Dresser went to Chicago, where John Austin Hamlin hired him to sing and perform in his traveling shows marketing Wizard Oil, a patent medicine.&gt; Dresser composed his first songs while working for Hamlin. They were marketed as the &quot;Paul Dresser Songster&quot; (a songbook of sheet music) and sold to audiences after his performances.

Few details are known of Dresser&#x27;s life between 1878 and 1880. Around 1878 Dresser may have taken a job with Barlow, Wilson, Primrose, and West, a prominent traveling minstrel group that was among the most famous in the nation at the time. After traveling with minstrel shows, Dresser went to New York City around 1879. According to an 1898 interview, he hoped to find work in Augustin Daly&#x27;s theatre. By 1881 Dresser had returned to Indiana and took a job at the Apollo Theatre in Evansville. At the Apollo he occasionally acted, but normally provided music for the plays.

===Growing popularity===
In Evansville, Dresser honed his skills as a musician and eventually became a nationally renowned talent. He also wrote a &quot;humor-and-advice&quot; column for a local newspaper, the &quot;Evansville Argus&quot;. By the time he left Evansville in 1886 he was &quot;a local favorite&quot; who toured the country giving performances. In March 1881 Dresser went to Chicago, where he headlined his own act. He also starred as one of the featured acts in a benefit concert for Daniel Decatur Emmett (the composer of &quot;Dixie&quot;) at the Chicago Academy of Music. Dresser&#x27;s act was a success and he was able to secure appearances in Boston, Philadelphia, and New York City as well as a number of smaller cities, including Indianapolis, Louisville, Cincinnati, and Pittsburgh.

Between shows Dresser returned to Evansville, where he had purchased a home. In 1882 he visited his family, whom he had not communicated with in more than three years. Through correspondence, Dresser learned they were in a desperate financial situation. His father and the family&#x27;s older children were living in Terre Haute, while his mother and the younger children worked on a farm in Sullivan. Known for his generosity, Dresser sent his mother a substantial sum of money and arranged for his three youngest siblings to move into his Evansville home and took care of their needs.

Because Dresser kept no diary, most of what is known about his personal life came from his brother, Theodore. While living in Evansville, Dresser began a long-term relationship with a local woman, whom Theodore identified as Annie Brace, the proprietor of Evansville&#x27;s most prominent brothel. Her professional name was Sallie Walker and she may have been the subject of one of Dresser&#x27;s most famous songs, &quot;My Gal Sal&quot;. Historians believe that Annie Brace and Sallie Walker may have both been aliases for Minnie Holland, although this has not been confirmed. The relationship continued for several years, but the couple never married. In 1889 they had a falling out because of Dresser&#x27;s frequent affairs with other women, including prostitutes.

In the early 1880s Dresser worked with a group of vaudeville performers, including James Goodwin, John Leach, and Emma Lamouse. Their shows in Chicago attracted very large audiences, in part because the theater&#x27;s owner kept admission fees low. In 1883 Dresser had his first songs published as sheet music since his time working with Hamlin. &quot;Essie, over the Sea&quot;, &quot;See That No One Plucks the Flowers from My Grave&quot;, and &quot;My Mother Taught Me How to Pray&quot; were supposedly published by Arthur P. Schmidt; however, one of Dresser&#x27;s biographers reported that &quot;1886 is the first year in which a published Dresser song can be documented.&quot;

Few details are known of the period from late 1883 to the summer of 1886. In 1884 Dresser claimed to have an undisclosed illness. For two years he remained in the &quot;south&quot;, away from his family and career. His brother Theodore speculated that Dresser may have had an affair and possibly fathered a child or he contracted syphilis. Dresser&#x27;s song “The Curse”, written in 1887, may have referred to this period in his life. Its lyrics refer to a dead child and a lover turned enemy. Whatever the case, Dresser did not return to his family or resume performing for the public until 1886, when John Stewart Crossy approached him to act and sing music in his comedy, &quot;The Two Johns&quot;. Dresser agreed and resumed traveling the show circuit.

Dresser continued to compose music during the height of his performing career. Between 1886 and 1893 he published nearly fifty songs, including &quot;The Letter That Never Came&quot; (1886), &quot;I Believe It for My Mother Told Me So&quot; (1887), and &quot;The Pardon that Came Too Late&quot; (1891). These early successes may have encouraged Dresser to pursue songwriting rather than performing. In addition, he may have realized that publishing music would provide even more financial success than composing or performing.

==National fame==

===Move to Tin Pan Alley===
By 1888 Dresser believed his songs would have popular appeal to a national audience. He stopped selling his songs through midwestern publishers, moved to New York City, and turned to Willis Woodward and Company, a New York City music publisher located in the area that later became known as Tin Pan Alley. Woodward and Company printed &quot;nearly three dozen&quot; of Dresser&#x27;s songs. Dresser continued traveling with &quot;The Two Johns&quot; show until the end of 1889 and composed music after the show season ended. In 1890 Dresser began performing in &quot;A Tin Soldier&quot;. Managed by Frank McKee, the Charles Hale Hoyt production was in its fourth season when Dresser joined the twelve-member cast. Dresser, who had been large since his youth and weighed nearly , performed as a jolly plumber in the nationally acclaimed show. &quot;Days Gone By&quot; and other Dresser songs were included in the show. He began to have a dispute with Hoyt over the use of his songs, and Hoyt&#x27;s refusal to acknowledge him as the composer. Dresser left the act in April 1891 and traveled the country performing in &quot;The Danger Signal&quot;. Dresser also began to sell his songs to other acts for use in their performances. After they made his songs famous, Dresser would then publish the sheet music and sell them through the firms on Tin Pan Alley. Dresser&#x27;s songs and acts were usually sad and melodramatic, but a few were romantic and silly.

===Howley, Haviland and Company===
At the height of the Panic of 1893, Dresser formed a partnership with Frederick Haviland and Patrick Howley as a silent partner in Howley, Haviland and Company. The New York City firm published Dresser&#x27;s works, while he recruited new songwriters and encouraged singers to perform the company&#x27;s songs. Dresser stopped traveling and performing during the summer so he could focus on composing music and promoting the new company. In 1894 he invited his younger brother Theodore to join him in New York. Theodore went to work for Howley, Haviland and Company as editor of the firm&#x27;s trade journal, &quot;Ev&#x27;ry Month&quot;, which promoted their newest songs. Theodore later became a nationally known novelist. During their time together in New York, the brothers frequented Broadway theaters, popular restaurants, and hotel bars as well as the city&#x27;s brothels and saloons.

In the mid-1890s Dresser began composing his most famous songs, including &quot;Just Tell Them That You Saw Me&quot; (1895). Dresser&#x27;s songs, along with others published by Howley, Haviland and Company, were included in the top minstrel acts and shows around the country. Dresser&#x27;s success continued with &quot;We Were Sweethearts for Many Years&quot; (1895), &quot;Lost, Strayed or Stolen&quot; (1896), and his most famous hit, &quot;On the Banks of the Wabash, Far Away&quot; (1897), which took Dresser&#x27;s career to its pinnacle. In &quot;Wabash&quot; Dresser reminisced about his childhood home in Indiana, which was near the Wabash River. With the success of &quot;Wabash&quot;, many newspapers compared Dresser to popular music composer Stephen Foster. When asked what inspired him to compose the song, Dresser replied, &quot;The same sweet memory that inspired that other Hoosier, James Whitcomb Riley, to sing the &#x27;Old Swimmin&#x27; Hole.&quot; The location of where the song was written is referenced in a short story in The Atlantic by Elizabeth Stuckey-French. She wrote, &quot;Paul Dresser wrote &#x27;On the Banks of the Wabash&#x27; at Mudlavia.&quot;

For a period Dresser was the most famous composer in the nation. Wabash was the best selling song of its time in terms of sheet music sold; over one million copies had been sold in the first year. The &quot;Chicago Record&quot; reported that &quot;Wabash&quot; &quot;has had the most enormous sale of any popular song.&quot; Newspapers reported that Dresser earned over $50,000 ($ in 2020 dollars) in the first year of sales; Dresser boasted that he made far more than their estimates. Popularity of the song continued for several years. In August 1898, the song was still selling over 10,000 copies a week. One music historian attributed &quot;Wabash&quot;&#x27;s success to the &quot;perfect marriage of words and music&quot;, where the flow of the music matches the words in a perfect fashion. Millions of people sang this popular song in the U.S. It was a featured song in music halls, on vaudeville stages, and in male quartet performances across the country. In addition, the song&#x27;s popularity spread internationally to places frequented by American travelers. Other songwriters wrote comic parodies of Dresser&#x27;s songs as well. For example, at the outbreak of the Spanish–American War, a folk version of &quot;Wabash&quot; with different lyrics began circulating. &quot;On the Banks of Havana, Far Away&quot; ridiculed the war. In 1902 the song was so well known that after power outage at the arena on Coney Island left thousands of people in the dark, the entire crowd sang &quot;Wabash&quot; to prevent a panic while repairmen fixed the lighting. In 1913 &quot;Wabash&quot; became the official state song of Indiana.

In 1900, with selling sheet music copies &quot;Wabash&quot; still selling &quot;extremely well&quot;, Howley, Haviland and Company opened a new and larger office in New York City. In addition, the firm had offices in Chicago and San Francisco and representation in Toronto and London. Dresser also contributed to a book on composing music, &quot;Hits and Hitters: Secrets of the Music Publishing Business&quot;.

==Later life==

===Fall from fame===

As the nineteenth century ended, American taste in popular music turned to less sentimental fare: patriotic songs, ragtime (more syncopated African-American styles than the minstrel songs and cakewalks), union and labor songs, and songs created for and derived from the more recent ethnic immigrant communities. At the same time, a new group of writers and composers began to dominate Tin Pan Alley and the explosive growth in recorded music soon dwarfed sheet music sales. Despite these changes Dresser continued to write in his own genre, known as &quot;mother-and-home&quot; songs to later generations. In 1900 Dresser published one of his last hit songs, &quot;The Blue and the Gray&quot;. Although Dresser&#x27;s songs were popularized by Richard Jose and others, his music was falling out of style. Sales of his music quickly decreased.

In 1900, although he was not a competent businessman, Dresser became an acting partner in his publishing business, which was renamed Haviland, Howley, and Dresser. His partners hoped Dresser&#x27;s name would help spur more business, but the enterprise was not a success. Haviland left the partnership in 1903. Dresser continued to write songs, but none brought the financial success that the business needed to survive. In 1905 the Howley and Dresser partnership declared bankruptcy. Determined to continue as a music publisher, Dresser established the Paul Dresser Company with money borrowed from his brother, Ed, but this venture failed as well.

According to one biographer, Dresser&#x27;s generosity &quot;had few limits&quot;. In December 1900, Dresser&#x27;s father died. Although the two had not been close, Dresser wrote a poem in his father&#x27;s honor. In addition, Dresser gave money to &quot;tramps, hangers-on, and to those who were simply down on their luck.&quot; He also helped support his siblings, including his brother, Theodore. Dresser began giving out money to his friends to help them. Despite his falling income, Dresser continued to spend liberally. He gave away large sums of money to his friends and family, spent vast sums at the city&#x27;s brothels and saloons, and by 1903 he was nearly impoverished. Without the means to support himself, Dresser was unable to continue his lifestyle in New York City. In addition, his obesity made it difficult for him to attract women, leaving him depressed and alone.

===Death===
Dresser&#x27;s health began to deteriorate rapidly at the end of 1905, when he wrote to his sister that he was ill, but gave no details. After his finances finally gave out, Dresser was forced to leave the hotel where he was living and move to his sister&#x27;s and brother-in-law&#x27;s home in New York City. Dresser died at their home on January 30, 1906, at 6:23 p.m., from a brain hemorrhage. He also suffered from alcoholism, obesity, and depression. A funeral was held in New York City on February 2, but because Dresser died penniless, his remains were held at Calvary Cemetery on Long Island until his funeral bill was paid. On March 19 Dresser&#x27;s remains were moved to St. Boniface Cemetery in Chicago, where a funeral and final burial took place on November 23, 1907. With no funds to purchase a memorial stone, Dresser&#x27;s grave remained unmarked until 1922, when the Indiana Society of Chicago had a boulder from the banks of the Wabash River brought to Chicago to mark his burial site.

==Legacy==

Dresser&#x27;s most significant legacy is his music. Although Dresser had no formal training in music composition, he wrote ballads that had wide popular appeal, especially home-and-mother songs and songs of lost sweethearts and dead heroes. Warm and &quot;genuinely tender&quot;, they represented a middle-class perspective. While Dresser&#x27;s melodies and lyrics were often sad, they could also be &quot;spirited and bubbly&quot; or &quot;emotional and sentimental&quot; with a &quot;wide and enduring appeal&quot;. Newspaper and magazine columnist H. L. Mencken remarked that it is a &quot;high honor to write songs that a hundred million people all know and all love&quot; in a reference to Dresser&#x27;s work.

The Indiana General Assembly named his most famous song, &quot;On the Banks of the Wabash&quot;, as the state song on March 14, 1913. In total, Dresser composed and published more than 150 songs and also left behind several unpublished compositions. His last work was &quot;The Judgment Day is Coming&quot;, published posthumously in 1906. Dresser was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1970 and is described as one of the &quot;most important composers of the 1890s.&quot;

The Paul Dresser Memorial Association was established in 1922, but their plans for an elaborate memorial in Vigo County, near Terre Haute, were never fully realized. In Terre Haute, Paul Dresser Drive is named in his honor. The Paul Dresser Birthplace is maintained at Henry Fairbanks Park in Terre Haute by the Vigo County Historical Society. In 1967 the Indiana General Assembly designated the home as a state shrine and memorial. The property is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and the National Music Council lists the home as &quot;A Landmark of American Music&quot;. The village of Dresser, also called Taylorville, is situated on the west bank of the Wabash River in Vigo County and was also named for the songwriter.

Dresser Drive, a street in the Forest Hills neighborhood of Anderson, Indiana, is named for him, as is the Dresser Bridge, which crosses the Wabash River, near Attica, Indiana.

Actor Victor Mature portrayed Dresser in the musical film &quot;My Gal Sal&quot; (1942). The plot bears little resemblance to Dresser&#x27;s life, and songs actually written by Dresser are mingled with songs attributed to him in the film but written for the movie by Harry Dacre, Ralph Rainger and Leo Robin. Dresser&#x27;s works in the film include: &quot;Come Tell Me What&#x27;s Your Answer, Yes or No&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;se Your Honey If You Wants Me, Liza Jane&quot;, &quot;On the Banks of the Wabash&quot;, &quot;The Convict and the Bird&quot;, &quot;My Gal Sal&quot;, and &quot;Mr. Volunteer (You Don&#x27;t Belong to the Regulars, You&#x27;re Just a Volunteer)&quot;.

Theodore Dreiser wrote a biographical sketch of his elder brother&#x27;s life in &quot;Twelve Men&quot;, published in 1919. An academic study of Dresser&#x27;s life, &quot;On the Banks of the Wabash, Far Away: The Life and Music of Paul Dresser&quot; by Clayton W. Henderson, was published by the Indiana Historical Society Press in 2003.

<doc id="783481" wikidata="Q6455574" url="?curid=783481" title="L'Anse Indian Reservation">
<text>The L&#x27;Anse Indian Reservation is the land base of the federally recognized Keweenaw Bay Indian Community () of the historic Lake Superior Band of Chippewa Indians. (The Keweenaw Bay Indian Community was defined in 1934 by the Indian Reorganization Act as the successor apparent of the L’Anse and Ontonagon bands). The reservation is located primarily in two non-contiguous sections on either side of the Keweenaw Bay in Baraga County in the Upper Peninsula of the U.S. state of Michigan. The Keweenaw Bay Community also manages the separate Ontonagon Indian Reservation.

As of 2020, the L&#x27;Anse reservation had a land area of , including off-reservation trust land. The population living on the reservation was 3,396 in the 2020 census. Most of the village of Baraga and part of the village of L&#x27;Anse are on reservation land. In 1999, tribal enrollment was 3,159 according to the Bureau of Indian Affairs &quot;1999 Labor Force Report.&quot;

==History==
This area was historically the territory of the L&#x27;Anse Band of the Lake Superior Band of Chippewa Indians, a large, decentralized group of loosely associated bands around southern Lake Superior.

The European-American community of L&#x27;Anse developed around a French fur trading post set up in colonial times at the site of an Ojibwa village on the bay. It continued to develop after the British took control of New France following the Seven Years&#x27; War. After the War of 1812 between Britain and the United States, negotiations settled the border with Canada, and this area became part of the United States.

As European-American settlers moved into Michigan in the early 19th century, the United States increased pressure on the Lake Superior Band of Ojibwa to cede their lands to allow unrestricted development. The Treaty of 1842, by which the Chippewa ceded lands to the federal government, was one of the largest land cession agreements ever made between the U.S. federal government and Indian tribes. It includes provisions and stipulations that the Chippewa retain their rights to fish, hunt and gather on these ceded lands.

The L’Anse Reservation is both the oldest and largest reservation in Michigan. It was established under the Chippewa Treaty of 1854. The United States Supreme Court has interpreted this treaty as creating permanent homelands for the Chippewa (Ojibwa Anishnaabeg) band signatories to the treaty. The US ultimately acquired land and set up other reservations in Michigan for Chippewa based on this treaty, for instance for the Bay Mills Indian Community.

 of forestland was transferred from The Nature Conservancy to the Keweenaw Bay Indian Community in 2024. The land, located within the ’s 1842 reservation boundary, was purchased from a landowner in 2021.

==Geography==
The reservation includes land on either side of the Keweenaw Bay in Baraga County, Michigan. The entire reservation encompasses nearly one third of the area of Baraga County. The largest section lies in northern L&#x27;Anse Township and western Arvon Township on the east side of Keweenaw Bay, while the smaller section lies in northern Baraga Township on the west side of Keweenaw Bay. There is also a much smaller (43.07 acre) part of the reservation in northern Chocolay Township in northeastern Marquette County.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the L&#x27;Anse reservation and off-reservation trust land have a combined total area of , of which is land and is water. Of the total area, was off-reservation trust land.

Due to historic allotment under the Dawes Act of 1886, only about 36% of the land inside the reservation is owned by the Keweenaw Bay Indian Community. The remaining 64% is owned by individuals (both Tribal members and non-members), businesses, and other local governments.

==Reservation demographics==
As of the census of 2020, the population of the L&#x27;Anse Reservation (including off-reservation trust land) was 3,396. The population density was . There were 1,844 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the reservation and off-reservation trust land was 58.6% White, 29.3% Native American, 0.1% Black or African American, 0.6% from other races, and 11.3% from two or more races. Ethnically, the population was 1.1% Hispanic or Latino of any race.

==Government==
The Keweenaw Bay Indian Community re-established its tribal government under the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934, with its constitution for elected government adopted in 1936. It elects members to a tribal council and executive.

The Act, which encouraged tribes to reorganize their self-governments, also required that the Ontonagon and L&#x27;Anse bands of the Lake Superior Band of Chippewa Indians be brought together as the federally recognized Keweenaw Bay Indian Community, defining it as the successor apparent of these two historic bands. Each had reservations in Michigan established through 19th-century treaties with the federal government.

The Keweenaw Bay Community was among the four founding tribes of the Inter-Tribal Council of Michigan, Inc. established in 1966 during a period of rising Indian activism in the United States and Canada. Others were the Bay Mills Indian Community, Hannahville Indian Community, and Saginaw Chippewa Indian Tribe; all were federally recognized at the time. They worked to pool resources, preserve communal land, improve the welfare of their peoples, and improve relations with state and federal governments. Working as a group, the tribes qualified for Community Action Program grants that helped fund improvements in living conditions for their peoples. The council now represents 11 of the 12 federally recognized tribes in Michigan.

The Keweenaw Bay Indian Community establishes its own membership rules for the tribe.

==Economy==
The Keweenaw Indian Community operates a fish hatchery at Pequamining Bay on Lake Superior. It works to improve and preserve water quality in the lake to support fish and other natural populations.

The tribe also operates two casinos, the Ojibwa I on reservation land in Baraga County, and the Ojibwa II in a residential neighborhood in Chocolay Township, Marquette County. A 2000 land claims settlement with the state required the tribe to relocate the latter casino. The tribe proposed moving it to the defunct Marquette County Airport. As of December 2012 the location remained unsettled.

<text>Pihtipudas is a municipality of Finland. Pihtipudas is known for the annual javelin carnival and for Lauri &quot;Tahko&quot; Pihkala, the inventor of Pesäpallo, the Finnish variant of baseball.

==Location and geography==
Pihtipudas is the northernmost municipality of the administrative sub-region of Saarijärvi-Viitasaari in the region of Central Finland. It is located on highway 4 (E75), approximately north of Jyväskylä, south of Oulu and north of the capital Helsinki. The municipality covers an area of of which is water. The neighbouring municipalities of Pihtipudas are Haapajärvi, Keitele, Kinnula, Pielavesi, Pyhäjärvi, Reisjärvi and Viitasaari. Just under half of the residents live in the largest settlement of Pihtipudas. The main villages within the municipality are located on the lakes of Alvajärvi, Elämäjärvi, Muurasjärvi, and Saani on the Saanijärvi, and at Ilosjoki, Korppinen, Kärväskylä, Peninki, Rönnynkylä, Kojola and Seläläntaus. 

The landscape has the typical characteristics of the Finnish Lakeland geographical region, with extensive birch and pine forest cover, small granite bedrock extrusions and extensive bodies of water. There are approximately 140 lakes in Pihtipudas municipality. The two largest lakes are Alvajärvi and Muurasjärvi, and smaller lakes include Saanijärvi, Elämäjärvi, Kinturi and Liitonjärvi. The northern parts of two large lakes, Kolima and Kolkku, are also within the municipality.

==Demographics==
The municipality has a population of (), steadily declining from 5,818 in 1987. The population density is . The municipality is 98.5% Finnish speaking.

== History ==

=== Prehistory ===

The area has been inhabited since the prehistoric period, evidenced by a range of Stone Age sites in the municipality, including: Niemet Keidas and Halmeniemi in the area of Muurasjärvi village; Kivikko; Pitkänen; Männikkö; Viipylä; Metsälä; Koivukangas; Rimpisuo; Santaharju; Teen; and Auhtola. Prehistoric artefacts recovered from the area include stone axes, awls, scrapers and other tools. The so-called &#x27;Village of Rönni&#x27; at Rönnynkylä on the north-east shore of Saanijärvi has been dated to approximately 5,000 BC in the Mesolithic period and contained the bones of a small-sized dog, one of the earliest discovered in Finland. Fragments of a clay figurine characterized as Comb ware have also been retrieved from a Mesolithic site at Pihtipudas. 
Archaeological evidence for Neolithic settlement in the area is rare, but palaeoecological data shows increasing signs of sporadic cultivation during the late Neolithic and the beginning of the Bronze Age between 2500 and 2100 BC, with pollen evidence for the first cultivation recovered from Pihtipudas, Keuruu, and Saarijarvi. Other evidence for human activity in the Neolithic period includes a zoomorphic stone mace, possibly carved with a fish or amphibian, believed to be associated with the arrival in Central Finland of cattle herding groups in the 3rd millennium BC. The prehistoric presence of the Sami people in the region are evidenced by two tampered cairns at Vaaksianniemi and Hameensaari. These were excavated in the 1980s and 1990s and contained bronze sheets with high elements of tin, dating them to the Early Metal Period of Central Finland.

=== Post-prehistory ===
The Pihtipudas region area was inhabited by Sámi peoples until the Middle Ages. The first known fixed settlement was established in the early 16th century with the first permanent residents of Pihtiputa, Pekka Varis and Pekka Rautaparta. The main industries were fishing and hunting, complemented by the development of grain and livestock farming.

Pihtipudas was first mentioned in 1552 as &quot;Pictipudhas&quot;, when it was a part of the large Rautalampi parish. Along with Kannonkoski, Kivijärvi and Konginkangas, the area was transferred to the newly established Viitasaari parish in 1635.

The main church in Pihtipudas was completed in 1783 and built by the peasant church builder Simo Jylkkä. The belfry was completed in 1785. Pihtipudas became an independent parish in 1863. The church was renovated in 1874, 1950 and 1991. The first public school in Pihtiputas was established in the village church in 1877. In 1917-18 there were 81 students. The first school in Muurasjärvi in the south of the municipality was opened in 1887. A Girl&#x27;s National School was established in 1887.

By 1910 there were 286 rental farms in the municipality and 128 small farms of less than 0.5 hectares. Only 2% of the area of the municipality’s 103,771 hectares were cultivated, with 94% forested. Two-thirds of the farmed land, comprising 1,400 hectares, were owned by self-employed farms. In the early 20th century there were 246 residents for every 100 hectares of arable land. In the late 1920s Lauri Tahko developed a sports field on land donated by the Läheaho estate near his summer cabin on Kolima lake in Hiekanpää, Ilosjoki. This field was used to train Olympic gold medalist Hannes Kolehmainen and to initiate the sport of Finnish baseball. 

In the 1940s the municipality was subject to post-war re-settlement with the introduction of migrants from 62 northern parishes, predominantly in the villages of Muurasjärvi and Kärväskylä. These included evacuees from the agricultural area of Sortavala (now in Russia) and soldiers from Ostrobothnia. As a consequence of post-war re-settlement the population grew to 8,500. The memorial at the Military Cemetery adjacent to the church was unveiled in 1953 and sculpted by Ilmari Wirkkala. The cemetery contains the graves and memorials for approximately 60 Finnish soldiers, the majority killed in action during the Winter War of 1939-1940 and the subsequent Continuation War of 1940-1944.

On 7 March 1969 Pihtipudas was the location of a mass shooting, in which Tauno Pasanen, a smallholder, shot and killed four armed policemen. The incident was dramatized in the 1972 Finnish film &quot;Eight Deadly Shots&quot;, directed by Mikko Niskanen.

The annual Boot Foot Rock festival (&#x27;Saapasjalkarock&#x27; in Finnish) was held in Pihtiputas between 1976 and 1988 and finally in 2006. The event was held eleven times, attracting an annual audience of 14,000 people. Notable performers at the 1986 festival included Metallica and Fabulous Thunderbirds.

==Attractions==

=== Pihtipudas Javelin Carnival ===
The annual Pihtipudas Javelin Carnival was started in 1971 by local athletes Leo Pusa and Jorma Kinnunen. Female participation started in 1974 and a javelin school was introduced in 1975. It also includes a paralympics event. This 4-day summer festival is now the largest javelin festival in Finland, attracting regional and international athletes, including British Olympic team member Laura Whittingham. The only javelin museum in Finland (&#x27;Keihäsmuseo&#x27; in Finnish) is located in the Putaanportti area of Pihtipudas.

=== Pihtipudas Local History Museum===

The local museum is situated in a converted granary next to the church in the center of Pihtipudas. The granary was built in 1857 and was acquired as a museum in 1960. The original building had double walls and floors with a wide space between them to prevent the theft of grain by drilling holes in the exterior. The museum contains approximately 900 items, including examples of local prehistory, fishing, agriculture and artisan crafts in several wood-lined rooms on two floors.

It includes a small selection of prehistoric artifacts from the area, including stone axes and other tools believed to be from the Stone Age and pottery from later prehistory. The collection includes a Stone Age axe head from the Neolithic period found in a field at Nokare in 1942, donated to the museum by Matti Pekkarinen.

Other collections reflect the more recent traditional practices of the region, including fishing nets, boats, winter transportation and animal traps for bear and fox hunting. The museum also contains an example of a unique mobile wood saw (&#x27;Puunkaatosaha&#x27; in Finnish) used for cutting trees and transportable by ski. It was invented in Pihtipudas by Uuno Kinnunen and presented to the Sandwick factory in Sweden in the 1950s, but was made obsolete by developments in mechanized tree-felling.

=== Water recreation ===
Pihtipudas has two discrete lakeside recreation areas: the north-west end of Kolima lake and the south-east end of the Alvajärvi. They are connected by the Heinäjoki river, running immediately to the north of the village. The river is spanned by Heinäjoki Bridge, a two-span stone-vault bridge commissioned by the Board of Public Roads and Waterways in 1919 and completed by the company Granit in 1924.

There are nature trails at Rapeikko on the west shore of Kolima lake and near the bridge at Heinäjoki. The trail at Rapeikko includes a tar burning pit and leads past Sarvilampi beach to the meadow at Rapeikko farm. The trail at Heinäjoki has duckboard walkways and bird watching towers. The municipality maintains two official beaches, at Häikkä on the west shore of Kolima lake near Saparoniemen and at Hiekkaranta (meaning in Finnish: &quot;Sandy Beach&quot;) at the southern end of the Alvajärvi. Both have basic changing and toilet facilities. Other swimming and beach locations are located at Alvajärvi, Muurasjärvi, Elämäjärvi (Pening and Hassila beach), and at Kärväskylä beach at the north-east end of Kolima lake.

The extensive fishing grounds of Pihtipudas consists of lakes Kolimajärvi, Alvajärvi, Muurasjärvi, Saanijärvi and Elämäjärvi. Stocked catch species include freshwater salmon, whitefish, pike, perch and brown trout. Natural catch species are brown trout, pike and perch. All fishing in the area requires a fishing permit.

=== Rillankivi boundary stone ===
Situated 30 kilometers to the north-east of Pihtipudas is the Rillankivi boundary stone, or &quot;Stone of Rilla&quot;. This glacial erratic is believed to be one of the stones marking the border of the Hazel Island Peace Treaty (Pähkinäsaaren Rauha) of 1323. This medieval boundary stone now marks the border between the municipalities of Pihtipudas, Pielavesi, and Pyhäjärvi. The site is protected by the Finnish Heritage Agency.
=== Imarrekivi stone ===
The Imarrekivi stone is a large glacial erratic located near Suurijärvi, south-west of Muurasjärvi, with one facet chipped to resemble a face. It is situated just off the Great Lakes hiking trail in the Harjuntakanen area. A local legend set in the 17th century tells how it was worshipped as a miracle-making place. On a Sunday night in the summer of 1600 Pekka Pekanpoika, a local Christian man from Muurasjärvi, went with his family to attempt to remove the face on the stone to discourage the heathen practice. Their attempts were halted when the &#x27;Stone King of Imarrekivi&#x27; spoke with the words: &quot;Before you were born, I was.&quot; Then the face in the stone became even clearer.

<text>Acme Markets Inc. is a supermarket chain operating 159 stores throughout Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, the Hudson Valley of New York, and Pennsylvania and, as of 1998, is a subsidiary of Albertsons, and part of its presence in the Northeast. It is headquartered in East Whiteland Township, Pennsylvania, near Malvern, a Philadelphia suburb.

Acme Markets has 159 supermarkets in Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, and Maryland.

After many decades of being the largest grocery retailer in the Delaware Valley, Acme fell to No. 2 behind ShopRite in 2011. As of 2013, Acme was No. 3 behind No. 1 ShopRite and No. 2 The Giant Company in the region.

==History==
=== Early history ===
Irish immigrants, Samuel Robinson and Robert Crawford, founded what is now Acme in south Philadelphia in 1891. In 1917, Robinson and Crawford merged Acme Markets with four other Philadelphia-area grocery stores, including English immigrant S. Canning Childs New Jersey–based &quot;American&quot; grocery chain; the new company was named American Stores. In 1927, smaller rival Penn Fruit began operating in Philadelphia&#x27;s Center City. In the late 1920s, supermarkets under the &quot;American Stores&quot; banner rapidly sprouted throughout the Philadelphia region, rivaling New Jersey–based A&amp;P, which then featured downtown stores throughout the East Coast, and as far west as New Orleans. American Stores first introduced self-service stores in shopping centers in the early 1950s.
===Expansion and acquisition===
In 1961, the American Stores company acquired southern California&#x27;s Alpha Beta chain of supermarkets. Many of Acme&#x27;s stores in the 1960s and 1970s were paired with a regional drugstore chain, a PLCB liquor store (in Pennsylvania), a Kmart, or Woolco (earlier centers had a Woolworth), and in rarer cases a department store such as Sears or JCPenney. American Stores also bought the Philadelphia franchise rights to the then fast-growing restaurant chain Pizza Hut in 1968. Acme would also acquire a number of stores from Kmart Foods (as did A&amp;P, Safeway, and Kroger); however, in the late 1970s, many recently closed 1950s-era supermarkets in Philadelphia and close suburbs were reopened as independents IGA or Thriftway/Shop &#x27;n Bag. Starting in the 1980s, these independents were overtaken by family chains Genuardi&#x27;s (later acquired by Safeway and now defunct) and Clemens (also defunct) along with Giant-Carlisle and Giant-Landover in newer suburbs, and modernized Acme, Super Fresh, and Pathmark stores in the city and older suburbs not long after.
From 1978 to 1982, Acme acquired many stores during Food Fair&#x27;s bankruptcy, including both ex-Food Fair (by then known as discount grocer Pantry Pride) and Penn Fruit units. The bulk of these dated to the 1950s. The former Food Fair/Pantry Pride stores were replaced by or remodeled into stores with the standard Acme prototype of the 1970s, as were many expanded A-Frame buildings and a few former Pathmark (these were former ShopRite) stores. Former Penn Fruit buildings, with their trademark barrel roof, could not be adapted to this model. Even many A-Frames were replaced by the often older but larger acquired stores.

In the early 1970s, Acme introduced a discount chain, Super Saver, in an effort to compete in densely populated areas. Both chains had the slogan &quot;Acme and Super Saver - you&#x27;re going to like it here!&quot; The brand Super Saver was retired in the 1980s, only to be resurrected in the 1990s in the West. Some isolated stores retained the signage into the early 1990s, however.

American Stores were sold in 1979 to the Skaggs Companies which took the American Stores name, moving its headquarters to Salt Lake City. Also in 1979, American Stores announced that it would be closing most of its stores in New York state. In the 1980s, American Stores undertook various acquisitions (including Chicago metropolitan area chain Jewel Food Stores) which ran the Jewel-T chain; it operated in many former urban Acme buildings. In 1995, Acme sold 45 stores in northeastern Pennsylvania to Penn Traffic. American Stores was acquired by major Western and Southern chain Albertsons in November 1999.

In 2006, Albertsons&#x27; supermarket holdings were bought by Cerberus Capital Management and SuperValu and divided between the two companies, with Acme going to SuperValu. In 2013 Cerberus, which was operating the Albertsons stores it owned under the name Albertsons LLC, agreed to purchase Acme from SuperValu.

In July 2016, it was announced that Albertsons had entered into a purchase agreement with Ahold and Delhaize Group to replace a Giant store in Salisbury, Maryland as part of the divestiture of stores to gain clearance from the Federal Trade Commission for the impending Ahold/Delhaize merger. The store was rebranded under the Acme banner in September 2016.

==Current and future operations==
Acme is the third-largest food and drug retailer in the Delaware Valley, where it competes with such chains as Ahold&#x27;s Giant-Carlisle, Giant-Landover, Food Lion, and Stop &amp; Shop; Wakefern Food Corporation&#x27;s ShopRite; Walmart and its warehouse club subsidiary Sam&#x27;s Club; BJ&#x27;s; Costco; natural/organic products retailer Whole Foods Market; Wegmans Food Markets; Trader Joe&#x27;s and Aldi; and various smaller chains. Acme was the regional sales leader in the Philadelphia area for decades, and only lost its lead to ShopRite in 2011.

Acme offers online grocery shopping for orders that can be picked up at the store or, in most areas, delivered to a home or business. In 2004, Acme introduced self-checkout stands, where shoppers could scan and bag their own groceries; however, many stores (including acquired stores - see below) have had their self-checkouts removed in an effort to expand customer service. In 2008, many Acme stores began adding hot food bars to the deli section.

In July 2015, Acme&#x27;s competitor A&amp;P announced it would be filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for the second time in three years and ceasing operations after 156 years. A&amp;P began placing many of its stores up for auction shortly thereafter, and Acme placed bids on 76 of them, eventually taking the leases to 71 stores in all from A&amp;P&#x27;s namesake brand and its subsidiaries Pathmark, Waldbaum&#x27;s, Superfresh, and The Food Emporium.

<text>Piippola is a village and a former municipality of Finland.

=== Villages ===
*Kangaskylä
*Lamu
*Leskelä
*Piippola (Piippolan kirkonkylä)
== History ==
The name of Piippola is derived from the surname &quot;Piippo&quot; or &quot;Piipponen&quot;, most likely a Karelian family. The upper Siikajoki river area was partially settled by Savonians in the 1560s, due to which the area was also known as &quot;Siikasavo&quot;. Despite this, most settlers in the area were Ostrobothnians.

Piippola was first mentioned in 1605 as &quot;Piippoila&quot;, when it was a part of the Saloinen parish and its chapel community of Siikajoki, which became a separate parish in 1689. Piippola became a chapel community in the 10th of October 1769, though a church was already built earlier without permission.

In 1845, the parish of Siikajoki was divided into two parts: Siikajoki proper and Piippola. The Piippola parish also included Kestilä, Pulkkila and Pyhäntä. Kestilä was separated in 1871, while Pulkkila and Pyhäntä became separate in 1899.

In 2009, Piippola united with Pulkkila, Kestilä and Rantsila to form the municipality of Siikalatva. The name was originally used for the administrative sub-region (now Haapavesi-Siikalatva), referring to the location of the municipalities on the upper Siikajoki river. The parish of Siikalatva was formed earlier in 2006 as a merger of the Piippola, Kestilä, Pulkkila and Pyhäntä parishes. The parish of Rantsila joined in 2008.

<text>Samuel Webber (1759 – July 17, 1810) was an American Congregational clergyman, mathematician, academic, and the 13th president of Harvard University from 1806 until his death in 1810.

==Biography==
Webber was born in Byfield, Massachusetts, in 1759. He was educated at Dummer Academy (now known as The Governor&#x27;s Academy) and Harvard College (B.A., 1784; M.A., 1787) where he distinguished himself in mathematics. He was a member of the Hasty Pudding. Webber was ordained as Congregational minister in 1787 and two years later became Hollis Professor of Mathematick and Natural Philosophy at Harvard. He served in the commission that drew the boundaries, later recognized by the Treaty of Paris, between the new United States of America and the surrounding British provinces. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1789 and also served as vice-president of the Academy. He authored &quot;System of Mathematics&quot;, which for many years served as the only textbook on the subject in New England.

Webber was appointed president of Harvard in 1806. That same year he received an honorary Doctor of Divinity degree from that institution. He led Harvard until his death in Cambridge, Massachusetts on July 17, 1810.

==Family==
Webber&#x27;s son, Samuel Jr., married Anna Winslow Green, a granddaughter of David Mathews, Loyalist Mayor of New York City under the British during the American Revolution. Webber&#x27;s son, also named Samuel (September 15, 1797 Cambridge, Massachusetts – December 5, 1880 Charlestown, New Hampshire), was a distinguished physician, chemist and author.

<doc id="783511" wikidata="Q4723148" url="?curid=783511" title="Alfred McCune Home">
<text>The Alfred McCune Home is one of the mansions on Capitol Hill in Salt Lake City, Utah, from around the turn of the 20th century. Built for Alfred W. McCune on the inclined south side of Capitol Hill at the northeast corner of 200 North Main Street, the mansion has 21 rooms and is on the National Register of Historic Places.

==About the owner==

McCune was born in Calcutta, India, while his father, Matthew McCune, was stationed with the British Army and converted there to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). The family immigrated to Utah Territory, settling in Farmington and then in Nephi. Alfred William McCune joined the LDS Church in Farmington in 1857. He and Elizabeth were childhood sweethearts and were married on July 1, 1872, in the Endowment House in Salt Lake City. Though McCune was not very active in church service, he donated a lot of money to it. According to LDS Church president Heber J. Grant&#x27;s notes in his personal journal (April 1, 1927), McCune was always in good standing with the LDS Church.

By the time he was 21, McCune had contracted to build portions of the Utah Southern Railroad. He was a highly successful railroad builder, and became well-connected to other late 19th century millionaires. He was a partner in the Peruvian Cerro de Pasco mines along with J. P. Morgan, William Randolph Hearst, and Frederick William Vanderbilt. He owned business interests throughout Utah and in parts of Montana, British Columbia, and South America.

McCune was respected by his contemporaries for his integrity, his congenial personality, and his generous donations to worthy causes. He was also civic-minded and politically ambitious. In 1899, he ran for the Senate as the Democratic candidate against Republican incumbent Frank J. Cannon and several other candidates. When none was able to get a majority of votes, the election went down in history as the time when Utah was unable to select or send a senator to Washington. McCune later tried again for the Senate but was defeated by another mining and railroad magnate, Thomas Kearns.

==The House==
The house was built in 1900. Elizabeth McCune had as many diversified interests as her husband had. She served in many prominent LDS Church positions and became close friends with Susa Young Gates, one of the daughters of Brigham Young. An active supporter of women&#x27;s rights, Elizabeth attended the 1889 International Congress of Women in London. After being voted patron of the organization, Elizabeth was entertained by Queen Victoria at Windsor Castle.

McCune wanted his home to be an extravagant display and to this end he financed a two-year tour of America and Europe for his architect S. C. Dallas to study designs and techniques. The design chosen was a Gothic revival plan with East Asian influence. The home is a replica of a house Alfred and Elizabeth saw while driving on Riverside Drive in New York City.

While the home was under construction, John R. Winder and McCune called upon the First Presidency of the LDS Church. McCune told them that he and his wife were building a new home and wished to rent the Gardo House for two or three years. The Gardo house had been used as a residence and offices for LDS Church leaders. Relieved to find a suitable new tenant, the church accepted his offer and set the rent at $150 per month.

The McCune home site was chosen to rise up impressively over the nearby streets, and little expense was spared on decoration. McCune had mahogany shipped from San Domingo, oak from England, and a rare white-grained mahogany from South Africa. The red roof tiles came from the Netherlands, and an enormous broad mirror wall was transported from Germany in a specially made railroad car. The walls were adorned with moiré silks, tapestries, and Russian leather. The exterior of the home was built of red Utah sandstone although some details like the lavish fireplaces used more exotic stone like Nubian marble. The home was completed in 1901 at a cost of one million dollars.

==History after the McCunes==
McCune and his wife lived in the home until 1920. Prior to moving to Los Angeles, they donated it to the LDS Church with the intent that it be used as an official residence for church president Heber J. Grant. Grant did not like the idea of living in such an ornate residence, and so decided to turn it into a Music School. It was used as the McCune School of Music, which ended in 1957 and was replaced by the Brigham Young University Salt Lake City Center, until 1972 when it too was moved into a larger location. In 1973, the LDS Church sold the house to a group of Salt Lake City residents who were seeking to make the building into a cultural center.

It then became the Virginia Tanner Modern Dance School, which held lessons in the ballroom. Since then, the building has been privately owned, often used for wedding receptions and other short-term rentals.

Philip McCarthey, a shareholder of the Kearns-Tribune Corp., which published &quot;The Salt Lake Tribune&quot; until 1997, bought the building and began restoring it after the August 11, 1999, Salt Lake City Tornado, which had toppled one of the building&#x27;s smokestacks. McCarthey completed the restoration in November 2001.

The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974.

A carriage house on the property, designed by architect Henry Monheim, is also a contributing building; it was built for the Judge R. N. Baskin house built in 1872 previously on the site, and was retained.

==Club history==

The history of volleyball in Jastrzębie-Zdrój dates back to 1949 when a group of young boys from the local schools gathered by a sports executive Jan Maciejewski formed a club under the name &quot;LZS Jastrzębie&quot;. In 1961 the club ceased to exist and in the same year due to the population increase, caused by the beginning of coal mining in the region, was founded a club named &quot;Górnik Jastrzębie&quot;, later in 1963 renamed to &quot;Górnik JAS–MOS&quot;. The club consisted of 4 departments: boxing, volleyball, football and ice hockey.

In 1970, the club changed its name to &quot;GKS Jastrzębie&quot; and under this name the team led by Jerzy Tomczyk in 1979 won a historical promotion to the 2nd Polish Volleyball League. In 1983, Leszek Dejewski joined the team, still to this day associated with the club, currently as an assistant coach. In 1989, &quot;GKS Jastrzębie&quot; led by Waldemar Kuczewski for the first time in club&#x27;s history was promoted to the 1st Polish Volleyball League, and in the next year in the upper league ended the season in 4th place. 

Just before the 1990–91 season, &quot;GKS Jastrzębie&quot; table tennis, ice hockey and volleyball departments seceded from the club with the volleyball department taking over the &quot;Jastrzębie Borynia&quot; name.
During the 1990s acting as &quot;Jastrzębie Borynia&quot; the team took part in the 1990–91 CEV Cup (former CEV Challenge Cup), reaching the second round and eventually losing to Belgian team Debic Zonhoven (3–2, 0–3). In the same season, the team led by Bronisław Orlikowski achieved its first medal of the Polish Championship, beating Płomień Milowice in four matches (3–1) for third place. Unfortunately, the next season did not end well with &quot;Jastrzębie&quot; being eliminated from the European Cups in the early stage of the competition. In the domestic league, &quot;Jastrzębie&quot; ended the season in 6th place. In 1993, the club was relegated from the 1st Polish Volleyball League and had to wait until 1997 when the team led by Zdzisław Grodecki for the second time in club&#x27;s history was promoted to the 1st Polish Volleyball League (official name since 2008: PlusLiga), playing there until this day. In 1999, Jan Such became the head coach of &quot;Jastrzębie Borynia&quot;. With him on the bench, the club achieved its 2nd bronze medal in 2001, exactly on the tenth anniversary of achieving the first one in 1991, defeating Czarni Radom. 

In 2002, the club changed its name to &quot;Ivett Jastrzębie Borynia&quot;. 

Jan Such remained as the club head coach until 2003. He ended his work with the club, winning 3rd bronze medal. He has been replaced by a Slovak expert Igor Prieložný. 

With Igor Prieložný as the &quot;Ivett Jastrzębie Borynia&quot; head coach, the club reached the CEV Challenge Cup quarterfinals, losing there with Serbian club Vojvodina Novi Sad (0–3, 0–3) while in the domestic league &quot;Jastrzębie&quot; achieved its first Polish Championship, winning with AZS Olsztyn in three matches (3–0). 

In 2004, the club has been taken over by the coal mining company JSW, what resulted in the club&#x27;s new name – &quot;Jastrzębski Węgiel&quot;. 

During the 2004/05 season &quot;Jastrzębski Węgiel&quot; competed in the CEV Champions League where the club reached the Playoff 12 stage and eventually lost to Belgian club Noliko Maaseik (0–3, 1–3). The 2004–05 PlusLiga season, &quot;Jastrzębski Węgiel&quot; ended in 4th place. The 2005–06 PlusLiga season, &quot;Jastrzębski Węgiel&quot; spent playing in the CEV Challenge Cup and despite winning the first match with Russian club Iskra Odintsovo (3–2) in the 1/8 stage, &quot;Jastrzębski Węgiel&quot; lost the second match (0–3) and has been eliminated from the further competition. At the end of 2005, Igor Prieložný was dismissed as the club head coach and has been replaced by Ryszard Bosek. The team led by him made it to the final of the Polish Championship but had to credit the superiority of BOT Skra Bełchatów, and eventually was awarded with the first ever silver medals won by the club. In the next PlusLiga season, Jastrzębski Węgiel participated in the CEV Challenge Cup, losing in the quarterfinals to Italian club Copra Berni Piacenza (1–3, 3–2). Ryszard Bosek has decided to resign his post a month after that defeat and has been replaced by an Italian coach Tomaso Totolo who led the club to its 2nd silver medal, again losing in the final of the Polish Championship to BOT Skra Bełchatów. After the season, Tomaso Totolo decided to leave the club and has been replaced by his compatriot – Roberto Santilli. 

Roberto Santilli led the team until 2010. During his work with the club, &quot;Jastrzębski Węgiel&quot; managed to reach the final of the 2008–09 CEV Challenge Cup held in İzmir. &quot;Jastrzębski Węgiel&quot; lost in the final to Turkish club Arkas İzmir (2–3) and achieved silver medals. In 2010, the team led by him not only ended the season in 2nd place but also for the first time in club&#x27;s history won the Polish Cup, beating Asseco Resovia in the final (3–2). In 2010, Roberto Santilli left the club from Jastrzębie-Zdrój. Igor Prieložný again became the head coach of the club but only remained as such until December 2010 when he has been replaced by one of the best players of the 20th century – Lorenzo Bernardi. The 2010/11 PlusLiga season, the club ended in 2nd place, losing in the final to PGE Skra Bełchatów in three matches (1–3). 

With Lorenzo Bernardi as a head coach, the club for the first time in its history advanced to the Final Four of the CEV Champions League in 2011, and achieved a silver medal of the 2011 FIVB Club World Championship. In the 2012/2013 season &quot;Jastrzębski Węgiel&quot; won a bronze medal of the Polish Championship. In 2014, the club for the second time in its history advanced to the Final Four of the CEV Champions League held in Ankara, Turkey and after defeating Zenit Kazan won a bronze medal. The club, ended the 2013–14 PlusLiga season with another bronze of the Polish Championship. After the season, Lorenzo Bernardi and one of the club main players Michał Kubiak left the team. An Italian coach Roberto Piazza, became the successor of Lorenzo Bernardi.

The team led by Piazza took 4th place of the Polish Championship and has been eliminated in the Playoff 12 stage of the 2014–15 CEV Champions League by Italian club Sir Safety Perugia (2–3, 0–3). Piazza left the club after that season and has been replaced by an Australian coach Mark Lebedew. Except for the coach, a few significant players left the club: previous captain and opposite Michał Łasko, opposite Mateusz Malinowski and outside hitter Zbigniew Bartman. It was all caused by the financial crisis in the mining industry, the branch closely related to the club&#x27;s main sponsor – JSW. 

Mark Lebedew remained as the &quot;Jastrzębski Węgiel&quot; head coach for 3 seasons, during his work the club achieved its 7th bronze medal of the Polish Championship after 2 matches for 3rd place against Asseco Resovia (3–1, 3–2). As a result, &quot;Jastrzębski Węgiel&quot; once again gained the right to compete in the upcoming CEV Champions League season. On 12 January 2018, the club informed about dismissing Mark Lebedew. The dismissal of the head coach took place two days after losing the quarterfinals of the 2017–18 Polish Cup to Onico Warsaw (2–3). His duties were taken over by his assistant Leszek Dejewski and the next official head coach Ferdinando De Giorgi took over the team on 12 January 2018. De Giorgi was a head coach of the Polish national team from 2016 to 2017, and prior to that – of ZAKSA Kędzierzyn-Koźle.

The 2017–18 PlusLiga season &quot;Jastrzębski Węgiel&quot; finished in 5th place. Before the 2018–19 PlusLiga season, a few notable players reinforced the squad: two–time World Champion Dawid Konarski and two national team members: Julien Lyneel and Christian Fromm. In the middle of December, De Giorgi decided to break an agreement with the club, after receiving an offer from Italian club Cucine Lube Civitanova. On 16 December 2018, Roberto Santilli was announced as the new head coach. Santilli was already coaching &quot;Jastrzębski Węgiel&quot; from 2007 to 2010, and returned to the club from Jastrzębie-Zdrój after 8 years.

Santilli led the club to its 8th bronze medal of the Polish Championship after defeating Aluron Virtu Warta Zawiercie in 3 matches (3–2, 3–2, 3–0). Thanks to that, &quot;Jastrzębski Węgiel&quot; returned to the CEV Champions League after a one–year break. A month after the beginning of the 2019–20 PlusLiga season, the club management decided to dismiss Roberto Santilli due to &quot;the unsatisfactory team performance and lack of expected results&quot;. Slobodan Kovač was announced as the new head coach on 1 December 2019.

The team from Jastrzębie-Zdrój finished 1st in its 2019–20 CEV Champions League group, defeated Russian team Zenit Kazan two times and ultimately reached the quarterfinals. During the away game against Zenit Kazan, &quot;Jastrzębski Węgiel&quot; managed to come back from 9–14 in the 5th set, and defeated the six–time CEV Champions League winners 16–14. Unfortunately, the team did not have a chance to play the quarterfinals against Italian team Itas Trentino due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the domestic league, &quot;Jastrzębski Węgiel&quot; ended the season in 4th place, after having played 24 out of 26 games of the 2019–20 PlusLiga regular season. As a result of CEV decision, the club was granted a place in the qualification stage of the next CEV Champions League edition, despite not being entitled to start in the competition. On 31 May 2020, the club management informed about not extending the contract with 8 players and the head coach Slobodan Kovač. An Australian coach Luke Reynolds, so far acting as an assistant coach of &quot;Jastrzębski Węgiel&quot; was announced as the new head coach on 3 June 2020.

===Early years (1930–2000)===
 (Workers Sports Club) &quot;Skra&quot; was founded in 1930 in Bełchatów. Initially, it was a football club. In 1957, a volleyball section was created although it celebrated its biggest successes during the 21st century. In 1977, the football section was separated from the club and transformed into GKS Bełchatów. In 1991 Bełchatów Power Station became the main sponsor of Skra and the club changed its name to (Energetic Sports Club) &quot;Skra&quot;. In 1994, the club advanced to the 2nd Polish Volleyball League and in 1997 to the 1st League &quot;B&quot; series. In 1999, they were promoted to &quot;A&quot; series, but after a year they fell back down to &quot;B&quot; series again.

===2001–2010===
In 2001, the club led by Wiesław Czaja was promoted to the highest level of the Polish Volleyball League. In their first season there – 2001/2002 – the team achieved a bronze medal of the Polish Championship, defeating Jastrzębski Węgiel after three matches.

The team was also defeated in the final match of the Polish Cup by Płomień Sosnowiec. It was during the 2004/2005 season that the winning streak for &quot;Skra&quot; began. The club won its first title of the Polish Champion after three matches with AZS Olsztyn, and also achieved its first Polish Cup after the final match with the same club (3–1). The team repeated that success in the next season, when they won their second title of the Polish Champion in four final matches with Jastrzębski Węgiel, and also the Polish Cup for the second year in a row (winning final match with AZS Częstochowa (3–0)). They lost two matches against the Greek team Iraklis Thessaloniki in the Playoff 6 of the 2005–06 CEV Champions League.

<text>The Woodruff-Riter-Stewart Home is a mansion on Capitol Hill in Salt Lake City, Utah. It sits on the corner of State Street and 200 North on the south slope of Capitol Hill.

Originally built for Edward D. Woodruff, a Union Pacific doctor who partnered a successful laundry business, the home was designed by architects Headlund and Wood and was finished in 1906. The home is an example of Renaissance architecture.

Originally, the house had an interior like an English home with stained glass, mahogany paneling (although it was cheap local pine painted to resemble mahogany), leather coverings, and mural-adorned walls. However, subsequent owners painted over all of the original interior. Likewise, the original red brick of the house was painted white for a time.

Woodruff lived in the house his entire life and it was inherited by his daughter Leslie and her husband, General Franklin Riter, a noted local citizen. Riter was the first Utah attorney on the Board of the American Bar Association. He was also the US Judge Advocate in Germany. In 1950 the home was sold to DeVirl Stewart. It was a family residence for the Grace Nixon Stewart &amp; Devirl Stewart family from 1950 to 1974. She taught elocution, poise &amp; etiquette classes from her home and also from the McCune mansion for years. After she stopped teaching at the McCune mansion, she taught at BYU for years as well. She led a passionate &amp; interesting life &amp; adds an intriguing spark to the history of this remarkable building. The building was sold in 1950 &amp; for a time it was used for office space, but the building&#x27;s interior and exterior is now restored. The building was purchased by Philip McCarthey in 2003. The bed and breakfast, Inn on the Hill, was reopened in 2004 and is open daily.

<doc id="783563" wikidata="Q644785" url="?curid=783563" title="Total synthesis">
<text>Total synthesis, a specialized area within organic chemistry, focuses on constructing complex organic compounds, especially those found in nature, using laboratory methods. It often involves synthesizing natural products from basic, commercially available starting materials. Total synthesis targets can also be organometallic or inorganic. While total synthesis aims for complete construction from simple starting materials, modifying or partially synthesizing these compounds is known as semisynthesis.

Natural product synthesis serves as a critical tool across various scientific fields. In organic chemistry, it tests new synthetic methods, validating and advancing innovative approaches. In medicinal chemistry, natural product synthesis is essential for creating bioactive compounds, driving progress in drug discovery and therapeutic development. Similarly, in chemical biology, it provides research tools for studying biological systems and processes. Additionally, synthesis aids natural product research by helping confirm and elucidate the structures of newly isolated compounds.

The field of natural product synthesis has progressed remarkably since the early 19th century, with improvements in synthetic techniques, analytical methods, and an evolving understanding of chemical reactivity. Today, modern synthetic approaches often combine traditional organic methods, biocatalysis, and chemoenzymatic strategies to achieve efficient and complex syntheses, broadening the scope and applicability of synthetic processes.

Key components of natural product synthesis include retrosynthetic analysis, which involves planning synthetic routes by working backward from the target molecule to design the most effective construction pathway. Stereochemical control is crucial to ensure the correct three-dimensional arrangement of atoms, critical for the molecule&#x27;s functionality. Reaction optimization enhances yield, selectivity, and efficiency, making synthetic steps more practical. Finally, scale-up considerations allow researchers to adapt lab-scale syntheses for larger production, expanding the accessibility of synthesized products. This evolving field continues to fuel advancements in drug development, materials science, and our understanding of the diversity in natural compounds.

==Scope and definitions==
There are numerous classes of natural products for which total synthesis is applied to. These include (but are not limited to): terpenes, alkaloids, polyketides. and polyethers. Total synthesis targets are sometimes referred to by their organismal origin such as plant, marine, and fungal. The term total synthesis is less frequently but still accurately applied to the synthesis of natural polypeptides and polynucleotides. The peptide hormones oxytocin and vasopressin were isolated and their total syntheses first reported in 1954. It is not uncommon for natural product targets to feature multiple structural components of several natural product classes.

==Aims==
Although untrue from an historical perspective (see the history of the steroid, cortisone), total synthesis in the modern age has largely been an academic endeavor (in terms of manpower applied to problems). Industrial chemical needs often differ from academic focuses. Typically, commercial entities may pick up particular avenues of total synthesis efforts and expend considerable resources on particular natural product targets, especially if semi-synthesis can be applied to complex, natural product-derived drugs. Even so, for decades there has been a continuing discussion regarding the value of total synthesis as an academic enterprise. While there are some outliers, the general opinions are that total synthesis has changed in recent decades, will continue to change, and will remain an integral part of chemical research. Within these changes, there has been increasing focus on improving the practicality and marketability of total synthesis methods. The Phil S. Baran group at Scripps, a notable pioneer of practical synthesis have endeavored to create scalable and high efficiency syntheses that would have more immediate uses outside of academia.

==History==

Friedrich Wöhler discovered that an organic substance, urea, could be produced from inorganic starting materials in 1828. That was an important conceptual milestone in chemistry by being the first example of a synthesis of a substance that had been known only as a byproduct of living processes. Wöhler obtained urea by treating silver cyanate with ammonium chloride, a simple, one-step synthesis:
: AgNCO + NH4Cl → (NH2)2CO + AgCl

Camphor was a scarce and expensive natural product with a worldwide demand. Haller and Blanc synthesized it from camphor acid; however, the precursor, camphoric acid, had an unknown structure. When Finnish chemist Gustav Komppa synthesized camphoric acid from diethyl oxalate and 3,3-dimethylpentanoic acid in 1904, the structure of the precursors allowed contemporary chemists to infer the complicated ring structure of camphor. Shortly thereafter, William Perkin published another synthesis of camphor. The work on the total chemical synthesis of camphor allowed Komppa to begin industrial production of the compound, in Tainionkoski, Finland, in 1907.

The American chemist Robert Burns Woodward was a pre-eminent figure in developing total syntheses of complex organic molecules, some of his targets being cholesterol, cortisone, strychnine, lysergic acid, reserpine, chlorophyll, colchicine, vitamin B12, and prostaglandin F-2a.

Vincent du Vigneaud was awarded the 1955 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the total synthesis of the natural polypeptide oxytocin and vasopressin, which reported in 1954 with the citation &quot;for his work on biochemically important sulphur compounds, especially for the first synthesis of a polypeptide hormone.&quot;

Another gifted chemist is Elias James Corey, who won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1990 for lifetime achievement in total synthesis and for the development of retrosynthetic analysis.
