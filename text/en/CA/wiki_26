<text>Wilson Cary Nicholas (January 31, 1761October 10, 1820) was an American politician who served in the U.S. Senate from 1799 to 1804 and was the 19th Governor of Virginia from 1814 to 1816.

==Early life==
Nicholas was born in Williamsburg in the Colony of Virginia on January 31, 1761. The son of Robert Carter Nicholas Sr. and his wife Ann Cary was born into the First Families of Virginia and would have ten siblings (of whom seven reached adulthood). His eldest brother George Nicholas (1754–1799) became a Virginia legislator before moving to Kentucky, and his elder brother John Nicholas (1756–1820) would serve as a Virginia legislator and U.S. Congressman before moving to New York. Their youngest brother, Philip Norborne Nicholas (1776–1849), served as Virginia&#x27;s attorney general from 1800 to 1819 before becoming a state judge. Only their brother Lewis Nicholas (1766–1840) failed to enter politics. Their eldest sister Sarah married John Hatley Norton of Winchester, and Elizabeth Carter Nicholas (1753–1810) married Edmund Jennings Randolph (1753–1813), who preceded this man as Governor of Virginia. However, their sisters Mary (1759–1796), Judith (b. 1765), and brother Robert (b. 1768) never reached adulthood.

===Education===

As usual for his class, Nicholas received a private education and later attended the College of William &amp; Mary. Nicholas studied law, probably with his father and possibly with George Wythe.

===Family===
Nicholas married Margaret Smith (1765–1849) of Baltimore, and they had nine children. His brother George married Margaret&#x27;s sister, Mary. Thus his brothers-in-law (the sisters&#x27; brother) were Samuel Smith and Robert Smith.

Perhaps the most famous of their male descendants was Robert C. Nicholas, who moved to Louisiana and became a U.S. Senator, or Jane Hollins Nicholas (1798–1871), who became the wife of Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s grandson Thomas Jefferson Randolph (1792–1875), who spent years disentangling the financial arrears of his father-in-law&#x27;s estate as mentioned below. Three of the children of Wilson Cary Nicholas and Margaret Smith Nicholas married Baltimore residents, including Mary Nicholas (who married John Patterson), Sarah (who married J. Howard McHenry), and John Nicholas (1800- ; who married Mary Jane Carr Hollins). Their brother Wilson Nicholas and sister Margaret died unmarried. Sidney Nicholas married Dabney Carr, and Cary Ann Nicholas married John Spear Smith, all of whom had children.

==Revolutionary War==
Nicholas served as a lieutenant in the Albemarle County Militia during the American Revolution.

==Career==

===Lawyer and planter===

Nicholas was admitted to the Virginia bar in 1778 and returned to Albemarle County after the war. By 1794, he settled his family at a plantation along the James River, which he called &quot;Mount Warren&quot;. Like his father and relatives, Nicholas farmed and operated his household using enslaved labor. Tobacco was the main crop in Albemarle County. Still, in the 1790s, Richmond merchant Robert Gamble convinced W.C. Nicholas to switch to wheat when everyone was aware of the damage erosion and tobacco&#x27;s nutrient demands made to the local soil, and wheat prices had risen. However, Nicholas would have a longstanding feud with the Scott family over the location of the tobacco and wheat warehouses along the James River in Albemarle County. Nicholas temporarily won in 1789, as the town of Warren was established on his lands. Still, by 1817, the terminus of the Rockfish Gap turnpike became Scottsville. In the 1787 Virginia tax census, Nicholas enslaved 39 adults and 23 children, as well as 22 horses and 49 cattle and a four-wheeled phaeton in Albemarle County. In the final census in his lifetime, Nicholas enslaved 57 people in Albemarle County, of whom 32 worked in agriculture, including 9 girls and 8 boys under age 14, and 6 men and 6 women more than 45 years old.

===Politician===

Meanwhile, Albemarle County voters elected (and re-elected) Nicholas as one of their two members of the Virginia House of Delegates several times, and he served in that part-time position from 1784 to 1785 and again from 1788 to 1789.

Both he and his brother George (who served several times when W.C. Nicholas did not run) represented Albemarle County in the ratifying convention of 1788. They favored the adoption of the federal Constitution. During the convention&#x27;s debates, on June 6, 1788, Wilson Cary Nicholas countered Patrick Henry&#x27;s objection that correcting defects in the new national Constitution by way of the Article V convention would be challenging. Nicholas said, &quot;The conventions which shall be so called will have their deliberations confined to a few points; no local interest to divert their attention; nothing but the necessary alterations. They will have many advantages over the last Convention. No experiments to devise; the general and fundamental regulations being already laid down.&quot; The Convention ultimately voted to ratify the federal Constitution, despite the opposition of most other representatives of Piedmont counties. The Nicholas family (and that of relative Edward Carter of Blenheim) remained Federalists for years, despite the popularity within the county of Thomas Jefferson.
From 1794 to 1800, Nicholas again won election and several times on re-election as one of Albemarle County&#x27;s two representatives in the House of Delegates.

Fellow legislators elected Nicholas as a Democratic-Republican to the U.S. Senate to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Henry Tazewell. Nicholas served as one of Virginia&#x27;s senators from December 5, 1799, until May 22, 1804, when he resigned to become a port collector of Norfolk 1804–1807.

Nicholas re-entered the public arena and won election to the U.S. House of Representatives in the Tenth and Eleventh Congresses. He served from March 4, 1807, until his resignation on November 27, 1809. He was elected Governor of Virginia in 1814 and served until 1816, when he retired from office, as the state constitution forbade second terms.

===Bank of the United States===
Nicholas became president of the Richmond branch of the Second Bank of the United States, charted by fellow Virginian and President James Madison in 1816, after Nicholas&#x27; daughter Jane married Thomas Jefferson Randolph, eldest and favorite grandson of Nicholas&#x27; longtime neighbor and friend, Thomas Jefferson. The bank made several loans to the former president, who was beset with high expenses. However, Nicholas also speculated in western lands, which put him in serious debt during the Panic of 1819. Jefferson had endorsed two of Nicholas&#x27;s notes for $10,000 each, believing that Nicholas&#x27; plantations were worth more than $350,000. However, after Nicholas&#x27; death, his lands were worth only a third of that amount, and the estate was insolvent, which indebtedness considerably worsened Jefferson&#x27;s financial situation, as described below.

==Death==
He died on October 11, 1820, at Tufton, the plantation home of his daughter Jane and her husband, Thomas Jefferson Randolph, now part of Jefferson&#x27;s Monticello near Charlottesville, Virginia. Nicholas was interred in the Jefferson burying ground at Monticello, near Charlottesville. However, when Jefferson died on July 4, 1826, and an inventory was taken of his estate, debts attributable to Nicholas&#x27; insolvency far exceeded those incurred by Jefferson personally, which led to the sale of the furnishing and enslaved people of Monticello, and which was not finally extinguished by his descendants until 1878, following Jeff Randolph&#x27;s death.

==Legacy==
The Virginia General Assembly named Nicholas County, West Virginia in his honor in 1818. Also named for him is a residence hall at William and Mary.

<doc id="764127" wikidata="Q994702" url="?curid=764127" title="Ernest Fox Nichols">
<text>Ernest Fox Nichols (June 1, 1869 – April 29, 1924) was an American educator and physicist. He served as the 10th President of Dartmouth College.

==Early life==
Nichols was born in Leavenworth County, Kansas, and received his undergraduate degree from Kansas State University in 1888. After working for a year in the Chemistry Department at Kansas State, he matriculated to graduate school at Cornell University, where he received degrees in 1893 and 1897. He also studied at the University of Berlin and Cambridge University.

==Career and death==
Nichols served as a professor of physics at Colgate University from 1892 to 1898, at Dartmouth College from 1898 to 1903, and Columbia University from 1903 to 1909. Nichols was awarded the Rumford Prize by the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1905 for his proof that light exerts pressure. The following year, he was elected to the American Philosophical Society. He was also elected vice president of the National Academy of Sciences. He was adviser of numerous outstanding scientists in Columbia University including Frederic Columbus Blake. His PhD adviser was Edward Leamington Nichols.
He served as the President of Dartmouth College from 1909 to 1916. In 1921, he became the president of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), but was too ill from heart disease during his brief tenure to enter actively into his responsibilities, and stepped down in 1922. On April 29, 1924, Dr. Nichols was invited to the inauguration of the new building of the American National Academy of Sciences in Washington, D.C., and was reading a research paper to the audience when he collapsed and died.

==Dartmouth presidency==
The appointment of Ernest Fox Nichols as the 10th president in the Wheelock Succession could be seen as both a reflection of the times and a tribute to the quality of Dartmouth&#x27;s faculty. A member of the physics department and its chair at the time of his appointment, Nichols&#x27; pioneering work in the measurement of radiation expanded the frontiers of knowledge at the end of the 19th century. He was the first Dartmouth president since John Wheelock who was not a member of the clergy, yet his deep appreciation of the importance of broad-based scholarship to the moral and spiritual growth of students was internationally recognized.

Many of the college&#x27;s most cherished institutions and traditions took shape during the Nichols administration, including the Dartmouth Outing Club and Winter Carnival. In addition, to improve communications between Dartmouth and its growing body of graduates, President Nichols established the Dartmouth Council of Alumni.

Ernest Fox Nichols stepped down in 1916 to become a professor of physics at Yale University and subsequently became president of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

<text>Jaime Barbara King (born April 23, 1979) is an American actress and model. In her modeling career and early film roles, she used the names Jamie King and James King, which was a childhood nickname given to King by her parents, because her agency already represented another Jaime—the older, then-more famous model Jaime Rishar.

A successful model, King was discovered at age 14 in 1993 and appeared in &quot;Vogue&quot;, &quot;Mademoiselle&quot; and &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;, among other fashion magazines. From 1998, she moved into acting, taking small film roles. Her first major role was in &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; (2001) and her first starring movie role was in &quot;Bulletproof Monk&quot; (2003). She has since appeared in other films including &quot;Sin City&quot; (2005) and &quot;My Bloody Valentine 3D&quot; (2009) and, from 2011 to 2015, starred in the television series &quot;Hart of Dixie&quot;. In 2016, she had the lead role in &quot;The Mistletoe Promise&quot;, a Hallmark movie. She also voiced the role of Aurra Sing on &quot;Star Wars: The Clone Wars&quot;.

==Early life==
King was born on April 23, 1979, in the suburbs of Omaha, Nebraska, the daughter of Nancy King, a former beauty queen, and Robert King. She has an older sister Sandi, an older brother Barry and a younger brother Robert (Robbie). King was named after Lindsay Wagner&#x27;s character, Jaime Sommers, on the 1970s television series &quot;The Bionic Woman&quot;. King&#x27;s parents separated in 1994. King had attended Nancy Bounds&#x27; Studios, a modeling school, and in 1995 dropped out of Westside High School in order to pursue a modeling career in New York City. She later enrolled in a home-study program run by the University of Nebraska.

== Modeling career ==
King was discovered in November 1993, at age 14, while attending Nancy Bounds&#x27; Studios. After being spotted at her graduation fashion show by model agent Michael Flutie, King was invited to New York City to begin modeling professionally. She joined Company Management, which already represented Jaime Rishar, a more established model. To avoid confusion, King opted to use her childhood nickname, James, for the duration of her modeling career and later, at the beginning of her film career. In March 1994, she traveled to New York for test pictures and received enthusiastic responses, however, she did not return to New York until July 1994, after gaining a successful advertisement for Abercrombie &amp; Fitch. Much of fall and spring 1994 were spent commuting between Omaha and New York.

King had a successful early career as a fashion model, and by age 15 she had been featured in the fashion magazines &quot;Vogue&quot;, &quot;Mademoiselle&quot;, &quot;Allure&quot;, and &quot;Seventeen&quot;. At sixteen, King had graced the pages of &quot;Glamour&quot; and &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;. She was featured in the cover story of the &quot;New York Times Magazine&quot; published on February 4, 1996, and had walked the runway for Chanel, Alexander McQueen and Christian Dior. In 1998, she began co-hosting MTV&#x27;s fashion series, &quot;House of Style&quot;, with fellow model turned actress Rebecca Romijn. Despite her success, King noted that she &quot;remember[s] the times where I was so alone&quot; and thought she was &quot;never gonna be able to be a kid.&quot;

In 2004, King, along with Halle Berry, Julianne Moore, and Eva Mendes was chosen as a spokesmodel for a high-profile ad campaign for Revlon. The advertisements were featured in print, television, theatrical, outdoor, and Internet venues, banking on their spokeswomen&#x27;s &quot;collective star power&quot; to sell the cosmetics products. In 2006, King was chosen by Rocawear CEO Jay-Z to become the new face of the line; her advertisements were featured for the winter 2006 season.

==Acting career==

=== Early work (1998–2004) ===
In 1999, King began her acting career and made her debut in the Daniel Waters&#x27; comedy &quot;Happy Campers&quot;, as Pixel. &quot;Happy Campers&quot; was screened at the Sundance Film Festival in 2001, and in 2003, King was nominated for Best Actress at the DVD Exclusive Awards. Filmed in 1999, she also appeared in Filter&#x27;s music video for &quot;Take a Picture&quot;. Following her debut acting roles, King appeared briefly in the film &quot;Blow&quot;, portraying the adult Kristina Jung, daughter of cocaine smuggler George Jung (portrayed by Johnny Depp).

King made her first appearance in a large Hollywood production with her role as a nurse, Betty Bayer, in the World War II epic romance &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; (2001). Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine commented that King &quot;has a lively minute or two&quot; in the film, but her part was small and the &quot;young cast is mostly pinup packaging&quot;. King went on to be featured in the Incubus music video &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot;. The roles King took part in during 2001 garnered her the &quot;New Stylemaker&quot; title at the Young Hollywood Awards.

In 2002, she appeared in the teen comedy &quot;Slackers&quot; as Angela Patton, &quot;Four Faces of God&quot; as Sam, and the crime comedy &quot;Lone Star State of Mind&quot; as Baby. &quot;Slackers&quot; received negative responses from critics, including one who found that the characters &quot;are not so strikingly original as to elevate the slack material&quot;, while &quot;Four Faces of God&quot; and &quot;Lone Star State of Mind&quot; did not have wide theatrical releases. 2003 saw King in the film &quot;Bulletproof Monk&quot;, alongside Chow Yun-fat and Seann William Scott, an adaptation of a comic book by Michael Avon Oeming. After five auditions, a screen test, and a physical test, she landed the role of Jade, a character skilled in martial arts. This was King&#x27;s first leading action film role. &quot;Bulletproof Monk&quot; received mostly negative reviews from critics, who cited that the fight scenes were not as well choreographed or directed as those other genre films, and that the alternating comedic and action scenes were jarring. Regardless, &quot;Bulletproof Monk&quot; was nominated for Choice Movie in a Drama/Action Adventure award at the Teen Choice Awards. In late 2003, King appeared in the music video for the Robbie Williams song, &quot;Sexed Up&quot;, and on the cover artwork for the single&#x27;s release. In 2004, she appeared in the comedy &quot;White Chicks&quot;, playing Heather Vandergeld, with actress Brittany Daniel as her sister Megan Vandergeld, a parody on socialites Paris and Nicky Hilton. &quot;White Chicks&quot; was negatively reviewed by critics, receiving five nominations at the Razzie Awards in the categories for Worst Actress, Worst Director, Worst Picture, Worst Screen Couple and Worst Screenplay. However, &quot;White Chicks&quot; won Outstanding Directing for a Box Office Movie and Outstanding Writing for a Box Office Movie at the BET Comedy Awards.

=== Breakthrough (2005–08) ===
In 2005, King appeared in a variety of film and television roles. She first appeared in the independent black comedy and satire &quot;Pretty Persuasion&quot;, playing a small role as Kathy Joyce, the stepmother of Evan Rachel Wood&#x27;s character. King landed dual roles (as twins) in the film adaptation of Frank Miller&#x27;s graphic novel &quot;Sin City&quot;. She had met with director Robert Rodriguez, who was a fan of her work, and at the time King was unaware that Rodriguez wanted her involved in the film. Eventually, &quot;we started reading [the &quot;Sin City&quot; graphic novel], and it was really fun&quot;. King portrayed Goldie and Wendy, the twin prostitutes in charge of the girls of Old Town, in the segment &quot;The Hard Goodbye&quot; opposite Mickey Rourke. &quot;Sin City&quot; featured a large ensemble cast of well-known actors which included Rosario Dawson and Jessica Alba, with whom King &quot;kinda grew up together&quot; in New York.

In &quot;Sin City&quot;, King was one of the few in the black and white film to have color, that being, red lips and blonde hair when acting as Goldie. The film was screened at the 2005 Cannes Film Festival in-competition and won the Technical Grand Prize for the film&#x27;s &quot;visual shaping.&quot; The family comedy &quot;Cheaper by the Dozen 2&quot; featured King as Anne Murtaugh in another large ensemble cast. She also acted in the Al Pacino drama &quot;Two for the Money&quot; as Alexandria. Both films had negative critical and box office reception.

On television, she had a guest appearance on the teen drama &quot;The O.C.&quot; and a recurring role on the short-lived situation comedy &quot;Kitchen Confidential&quot;. King was featured in the Zach Braff-directed music video for Gavin DeGraw&#x27;s &quot;Chariot&quot;.

In 2006, King appeared with a small role as Heather in the comedy &quot;The Alibi&quot; and a starring role in the thriller &quot;True True Lie&quot;. Her largest role that year was in the David Arquette horror film &quot;The Tripper&quot; as Samantha. King had a recurring role on the short lived comedy &quot;The Class&quot;, which ended its run on television after an announcement in May 2007. &quot;The Class&quot; had been nominated for an Emmy Award in 2007, and it won the People&#x27;s Choice Award for Favorite New TV Comedy.

In 2007, King filmed &quot;They Wait&quot;, a horror-thriller film inspired by true events, with Terry Chen as her husband and Regan Oey as their son. She stars as a mother attempting to find the truth and save her son when threatened by spirits during the Chinese tradition of Ghost Month. It was featured in the 2007 Toronto International Film Festival, but has not yet had a wide theatrical release. However, it was broadcast on Lifetime Movie Network February 2015. In 2008, King appeared as Lorelei Rox in &quot;The Spirit&quot;, a live-action film adaptation based on the 1940s newspaper strip &quot;The Spirit&quot; created by Will Eisner. The role reunited King with &quot;Sin City&quot; writer Frank Miller, who wrote and directed the film.

=== Film and television roles (2009–present) ===
King was cast as Sarah Palmer in the horror remake &quot;My Bloody Valentine 3D&quot;, which opened in January 2009. She also appeared in the &quot;Star Wars&quot;-themed comedy &quot;Fanboys&quot;; originally set for release in January 2008, the film was postponed when director Kyle Newman received additional funding to shoot new scenes. A dispute between the filmmakers and the film&#x27;s distributor, the Weinstein Company, over which version of the film to release caused further delays, and the film was ultimately released in early 2009 to poor reviews. In May 2008, King featured in another Newman-directed film, Act I of &quot;The Cube&quot;, the beginning of an online movie-making contest.

&quot;The Pardon&quot;, a film based on the true life story of Toni Jo Henry, the only woman to be electrocuted by Louisiana, stars King in the lead role with John Hawkes playing her partner-in-crime. This drama was released in 2013. The film&#x27;s co-producer and writer Sandi Russell was quoted as saying: &quot;Jaime carries this film. She is literally in every scene of the movie and given the subject matter, that is no small task.&quot;

The Jim Kouf comedy, &quot;A Fork in the Road&quot;, has King portraying April Rogers, alongside Daniel Roebuck. She plays Beth in Darren Lynn Bousman&#x27;s remake of &quot;Mother&#x27;s Day&quot; and narrated the movie on Scream Award 2009. King hosts the reality show &quot;Scream Queens 2&quot;, directed by Biagio Messina and Joke Fincioen on VH1. She appeared in the music video for the song &quot;Bury Me Alive&quot; by the band We Are The Fallen with her husband Kyle Newman.

King worked in the TV series &quot;Star Wars: The Clone Wars&quot;. She played the role of Aurra Sing in the series Season 1 finale episode &quot;Hostage Crisis&quot; and later the final three episodes of Season 2: &quot;Death Trap&quot;, &quot;R2 Come Home&quot;, and &quot;Lethal Trackdown&quot; as well as an appearance in Season 3. She played three other characters in addition to Aurra Sing in the series. In the episode &quot;Lightsaber Lost&quot;, she voices Cassie Cryar and Muk Muk Monkey. She voices a ticket droid in the episode &quot;Lethal Trackdown&quot;.

King appeared in the ABC documentary-style dramedy television series &quot;My Generation&quot;, which premiered on September 23, 2010. After initial low ratings, ABC pulled the program from broadcast after two episodes.

King also appeared in the music video for The Fray&#x27;s hit single &quot;Never Say Never&quot;.

King played Lemon Breeland in the CW show &quot;Hart of Dixie&quot;, which premiered on September 26, 2011. She had expressed interest in working in the Dark Knight trilogy, specifically in the role of Catwoman, which was eventually played by Anne Hathaway in &quot;The Dark Knight Rises&quot; in 2012.

King appeared in Lana Del Rey&#x27;s music video, &quot;Summertime Sadness&quot;, which was directed by her husband, Kyle Newman. The video was released in July 2012 and can be seen on YouTube. In the video, King plays Del Rey&#x27;s suicidal lover. King reprised her role as twins Goldie and Wendy in the part sequel and part prequel of the Miller written and co-directed film &quot;Sin City: A Dame to Kill For&quot;.

== Personal life ==
During her first job modeling, King began using heroin and had an addiction to the drug from age 14 to 19, at which time she went to rehabilitation for her addiction. Her boyfriend, 20-year-old fashion photographer Davide Sorrenti, died from a kidney ailment. She briefly dated Kid Rock at the age of 21.

In 2006, while working on the set of &quot;Fanboys&quot;, she met future husband Kyle Newman, the film&#x27;s director. Within three months of dating, the two moved in together. Newman proposed in spring 2007, and the two married on November 23, 2007, in an &quot;intimate and relaxed&quot; ceremony in Los Angeles at Greystone Mansion, where Newman had proposed. King told &quot;InStyle&quot; magazine, &quot;I want at least three children.&quot; King and Newman have two sons together; Taylor Swift is godmother to their second son. In 2014, she revealed her struggles with endometriosis and polycystic ovary syndrome, which led to infertility. King suffered five miscarriages and an ectopic pregnancy prior to her first successful pregnancy.

In May 2020, King filed for divorce from Newman after 14 years of marriage. King also filed a domestic violence prevention petition and was granted a temporary restraining order against Newman, which was later withdrawn. The divorce was finalized in September 2023.

<text>East African Safari Air was an airline based in Kenya. Its international operations were suspended in September 2004, by the Kenya Civil Aviation Authority, but the airline still maintained scheduled regional and domestic services through its subsidiary East African Safari Air Express. In December 2010, East African Safari Air Express was ostensibly purchased by the parent company of another Kenyan airline Fly540 and was rebranded as [[Fly SAX]]. (Litigation concerning this purchase is pending in Kenyan courts).

==History==

East African Safari Air Limited was founded by Anthony A Kegode, a well-known African entrepreneur and aviator. The airline was derived from a company known as Car Hire Services (Aviation) Limited, which was incorporated on or about 16 May 1989 in the Companies Registry as No. C. 40158. The company later changed its name to East African Safari Air Limited on 27 February 1998.

At the time of incorporation of Car Hire Services (Aviation) limited the shareholders were Mr. Kegode, M/s William Henry Boyd Parkinson, Pritam Singh Panesar and Samuel Gakuru. On 27 November 1990, Mr. Mohammed Aslam Khan was appointed managing director of CHS Aviation, and in December 1990 East African Safari Air (then CHS Aviation) was granted a license from the Civil Aviation Board to operate scheduled and coach services to the Maasai Mara. Additionally, CHS Aviation operated 2 Cessna 310s and 1 Cessna 402B. In 1990 East African Safari Air (then CHS Aviation) borrowed US$247,000 from Barclays Bank Kenya and purchased a de Havilland Twin Otter from Sataircraft in Denmark registration 5Y-KEG (after the first three letters of the founder&#x27;s last name KEGODE) and leased it to Air Kenya Aviation Ltd.

In 1992 CHS Aviation became the first privately owned Kenyan carrier, if not in the East African region, to be licensed by the Kenya Civil Aviation Board to operate charter flights to and from South Africa to Mombasa using a Boeing 707 aircraft. Kenya Airways attempted to have the designation withdrawn as it faced the prospect of competition for the first time from the private sector.

12 November 1992 CHS Aviation was licensed by the Kenya Civil Aviation Board and the Italian Civil Aviation Authorities to operate charter flights to and from Italy and Mombasa. CHS aviation flew from Milan to Mombasa wet leasing two Boeing 767 300ER from Air Europe (Italy). As East African Safari Air the company ferried 1,320,000 tourist passengers to and from Italy to Kenya between 1992 and 2002.

In October 1992 there was an ownership change and the Managing Director Aslam Khan left CHS Aviation to start his own charter company Aircraft Leasing Services Ltd. In February 1993 CHS Aviation was granted permission to operate charter flights from Nairobi to Paris and Mombasa to Paris. CHS Aviation used a McDonnell Douglas MD-82 of 167 pax to operate the route twice a week. In October 1993 CHS Aviation added two Cessna 208 Caravans and a Beechcraft B200 King Air to its general aviation fleet, to provide charter services to Southern Sudan for the South Sudan Liberation Movement. At the end of October 1993 CHS Aviation had three Cessna Caravans, and two King Air B200s operating flights to Southern Sudan.
In February 1998 Anthony Kegode and Uhai Ltd bought out all the shares of WHB Parkinson and PS Panesar. Uhai Ltd was then owned 100% by Anthony Kegode and Elizabeth Kegode.

When the company later changed its name to East African Safari Air Limited on 27 February 1998, it saw the exist of the other founder shareholders, with Uhai Limited and Mr. Kegode acquiring 100% of the shares of East African Safari Air. Mr. Pritam Singh Panesar remaining on the board of the company as a non-shareholding Director; by a special resolution passed on 2 July 1998, Mrs. Elizabeth Ann Kegode was appointed as a member of East African Safari Air, Anthony Kegode became the carriers&#x27; Executive Chairman.

In 1998 East African Safari Air applied to the Kenya Government and was the first privately owned local airline to be granted designation on Bilateral Air Service Agreements to all Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) Countries, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy, Switzerland and Germany. The company was also granted permits to operate scheduled flights to Mombasa, Lokkichoggio, and Kisumu from Nairobi.

In or about the year 2001, East African Safari Air acquired all (99%) but one of the shares in Flying Jetpet (Kenya) limited, which was incorporated as Company No. c. 82314. The said company later changed its name to East African Safari Air Express Limited. In 2001 East African Safari Air acquired 99% East African Safari Air Express Limited with Anthony Kegode still holding 1% of the company.

In 2003 East African Safari Air began operating international, and regional designated routes, local scheduled and other charter flights, using two Boeing 767-300ER (5Y-CCC &amp; 5Y-QQQ) and two F28 -4000.

East African Safari Air Express purchased Eagle Aviations&#x27; two Fokker F28 Fellowship aircraft by a Conditional Sale Agreement dated 30 April 2003 from Aircraft Services Corporation (&quot;ACS&quot;) based in Ireland, a subsidiary of General Electric Aviation Capital (&quot;GECAS&quot;) . Prior to the execution of the agreement Aircraft Services Corporation entered into an early termination accord with M/s Eagle Aviation Limited concluding an earlier contract between the parties to facilitate the sale of Fokker F28-4000 Serial No 11229 and Fokker F28-4000 Serial No 11231 to East African Safari Air Express.
Fast growth saw the airline run into cash flow problems and in late 2003 East African Safari Air started to search for investors. In May 2004 Mr. Adam Ogden through Two Ninety Investments Limited approached East African Safari Air Express with an interest to invest in the company. On 27 August 2003 passengers narrowly escaped a crash when their plane made an emergency landing soon after take-off at Kisumu Airport after it hit a flock of birds. The Nairobi-bound East African Safari Air Express plane Fokker F28-4000 landed safely but burst a tyre in the morning incident aircraft. On 7 December 2003 another Fokker F28-4000 5Y – NNN was involved in an accident at Lokichoggio Airport, Kenya.
In late 2003, as the operations of East African Safari Air (the parent of East African Safari Air Express) experiences unrelenting cash flow problems. This was due to the company&#x27;s decision to operate five flights per week to London Heathrow from Nairobi. East African Safari Air entered into a joint venture agreement with British Midland International (bmi) airlines, who provided passenger handling services at London Heathrow Airport (LHR). Although East African Safari Air was the first to introduce daytime flights out of Nairobi to London, and direct flights to the resort holiday town of Mombasa, other major airlines quickly followed suit. At first, the difficulty in establishing strong traffic numbers was forcing the company to operate near empty flights to and from Heathrow. Gradually however, the numbers carried began to steadily increase. Unfortunately the months by which the route was being built and traffic was uneconomical had taken their toll. East African Safari Air had accumulated nearly US$24,000,000 in debt.

At this stage however passenger traffic had steadily gained in numbers, and the forward bookings in mid-2004 showed that all the airline&#x27;s flights would operate at strong load factors and have enough business to trade out its crushing debt. In early 2004 it was decided that the company would benefit from the injection of investment capital from the outside. To this end, Ogden who was well known to the largest shareholders of the company, Mr. and Mrs. Kegode, introduced a company by the name of Four Ninety Investments Limited willing to invest US$6,000,000.

An agreement prepared by Four Ninety&#x27;s lawyers Walker Kontos advocates to the effect that, interalia, East African Safari Air was insolvent and that Four Ninety would only pay Ksh 5 for a 90% stake in the company, but invest enough cash to take the company out of insolvency. The agreement left Anthony A Kegode with only 10% interest in the company and also saw to it that Mr. Kegode was to be bound by way of personal guarantees for 100% of the loans the company had hitherto taken. &quot;As much as I felt the arrangement was inequitable, I was at pains to salvage the company, and since the strategy of Four Ninety in the run up to this final agreement had left us with no other choices to save the business, we were inclined to proceed with the sale for the sake of the company&#x27;s survival,&quot; said Kegode.

East African Safari Air Shareholders passed minority rights and approved the agreement selling 90% shares to Four Ninety and leaving the founder with 10% shareholding in the company on 4 June 2004. Ogden thereafter took over the management of the company&#x27;s operations.
On 13 September 2004, nearly four months under Ogden&#x27;s stewardship, East African Safari Air and East African Safari Air Express were placed in receivership, a month after only US$2,000,000 was purportedly paid in by Four Ninety Investments Limited, only one third of the US$6,000,000 required for the airline&#x27;s recovery needs. At that time the airline was ferrying approx 25,000 passengers per month on various routes.

<text>The Karamnasa or Karmanasa River () is a tributary of the Ganges. It originates in Kaimur district of Bihar and flows through the Indian states of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. Along the boundary between Uttar Pradesh and Bihar it has the districts of Sonbhadra, Chandauli, Varanasi and Ghazipur on its left (UP side); and the districts of Kaimur and Buxar on its right (Bihar side).

==Disambiguation==
Karmanasa is also the name of a river in the Garhwal Himalayas.

==Etymology==
The name of the river means &quot;destroyer of religious merit&quot;. There are several legends about it.

According to one legend, the sage Vishvamitra through &quot;tapasya&quot; (penance, meditation and correct practices) acquired the power to create a whole new universe. When he set out to create a new universe it aroused consternation in Indra. However, he continued and after creating a copy of our universe, he started creating people, the first being Trishanku whom he decided to send up to rule his new universe. Indra stopped his progress. That is how Trishanku ended up suspended head down in mid-air. The Karmanasa was born out of the saliva dripping from his mouth.

==Course==
The Karmanasa originates at a height of on the northern face of Kaimur Range near Sarodag in Kaimur district of Bihar. It flows in a north-westerly direction through the plains of Mirzapur, then forms the boundary between Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, and finally joins the Ganges near Village Bara (East Side) Ghazipur Uttar Pradesh and Chausa (Bihar). The length of the river is , out of which lies in Uttar Pradesh and the rest forms the boundary between Uttar Pradesh (Bara-Ghazipur) and Bihar (Chausa). Total drainage area of the Karmnasa along with its tributaries is .

===Tributaries===
Its tributaries are the Durgavati, the Chandraprabha, the Karunuti, the Nadi, the Goriya and the Khajuri.

===Waterfalls===
The Karmanasa reaches the plains by a succession of leaps, including three falls known as the Karkatgarh,Devdari and the Chhanpathar, which, from their height and beauty, are 
deserving of special notice. Chhanpathar Falls is high. Devdari Falls, at an edge of the Rohtas Plateau, along the course of the Karmanasa is high. However, Chandauli district administration mentions Devdari Fall as being on the Chandraprabha River.

===Dams and bridges===
There are two dams across the Karmanasa – the Latif Shah bund and the Nuagarh dam. There also is a dam across the Chandraprabha.

The Grand Trunk Road passes over a bridge on the Karmanasa.

==Archaeology==
UP State Archaeology department under the direction of Rakesh Tewari, excavations has unearthed iron artifacts dated between 1200 – 1300 BC at Raja Nal Ka Tila site in Karmanasa river valley of north Sonebhadra. It throws new light on the history of iron-making in India.

==History==
The Karmnasa was the western boundary of the Sena dynasty.

At the Battle of Chausa, situated on the banks of the Karmanasa, on 26 June 1539, Sher Shah defeated the Mughal emperor Humayun and assumed the royal title of Farīd al-Dīn Shēr Shah.

<text>John George Nicolay (February 26, 1832 – September 26, 1901) was a German-born American author and diplomat who served as private secretary to U.S. President Abraham Lincoln and later, with John Hay, co-authored &quot;Abraham Lincoln: A History&quot;, a ten-volume biography of the 16th president. He was a member of the German branch of the Nicolay family.

==Early life==
He was born Johann Georg Nicolai in Essingen, Kingdom of Bavaria. In 1838, he immigrated to the United States with his father and attended school in Cincinnati, Ohio.

== Career ==
Nicolay moved to Illinois, where he edited the &quot;Pike County Free Press&quot; at Pittsfield, Illinois, and he became a political power in the state. Then he became assistant to the secretary of state of Illinois. While in this position, he met Abraham Lincoln and became his devoted adherent.

In 1861, Lincoln appointed Nicolay as his private secretary, which was the first official act of his new administration. Nicolay served in this capacity until Lincoln&#x27;s death in 1865. Twice Lincoln sent Nicolay to record treaties with Native Americans. In 1862 he went to Minnesota for a Chippewa treaty that was delayed because of the Santee Sioux uprising. The next year he traveled to Colorado for the Ute Treaty. Shortly before his assassination, Lincoln appointed Nicolay to a diplomatic post in France. After the death of the president, Nicolay became United States Consul at Paris, France (1865–69). For some time after his return to the United States, he edited the Chicago &quot;Republican&quot;. He was marshal of the United States Supreme Court (1872–1887). In 1881, Nicolay wrote &quot;The Outbreak of Rebellion&quot;.

Nicolay and John Hay, who had worked with Nicolay as assistant secretary to Lincoln, collaborated on &quot;Abraham Lincoln: A History&quot;. It appeared in &quot;The Century Magazine&quot; serially from 1886 to 1890 and was issued (1890–94) in book form as 10 volumes, together with the two-volume &quot;Complete Works of Abraham Lincoln&quot;. The resulting biography is a definitive resource on Lincoln and his times. Nicolay and Hay also edited Lincoln&#x27;s &quot;Works&quot; in 12 volumes published after Nicolay’s death (1905).

In 1912, Nicolay&#x27;s daughter, Helen Nicolay (1866–1954), published &quot;Personal Traits of Abraham Lincoln&quot;. The book was based on envelopes of material that Nicolay had collected but been unable to use in the biography of Lincoln that he wrote with Hay. Helen Nicolay wrote in the preface to the book that the envelopes contained &quot;miscellaneous notes, personal jottings, private letters, and newspaper clippings.&quot; In 1949, Helen Nicolay published a biography of her father.

Historian Joshua M. Zeitz writes, &quot;Above all, Nicolay and Hay created a master narrative whose influence would ebb and flow over the years but that continues to command serious scrutiny and engagement... Early in the writing process, Nicolay assured Robert Todd Lincoln&quot;:
:We hold that your father was something more than a mere make-weight in the cabinet ... We want to show that he formed a cabinet of strong and great men—rarely equaled in any historical era—and that he held, guided, controlled, curbed and dismissed not only them but other high officers civilian and military, at will, with perfect knowledge of men.

Nicolay was a founding member of the Literary Society of Washington in 1874, according to a book about the society written by his daughter Helen Nicolay. Both Nicolay and Hay were members of long standing in the society.

==Death==

Poor health had forced Nicolay to resign as Marshal of the Supreme Court, and he suffered from a wide range of ailments in his final years. He lived with his daughter Helen Nicolay at her home at 212 B Street SE in Washington, D.C. He died at home of unspecified causes on September 26, 1901. He was buried at Oak Hill Cemetery in the city.

==In popular culture==
In the TV series &quot;Carl Sandburg&#x27;s Lincoln&quot;, aired on NBC in 1974–1976, he was portrayed by Michael Cristofer. In the 1992 documentary &quot;Lincoln&quot;, the German-born Nicolay is voiced by the Austrian-born actor Arnold Schwarzenegger. In the 1988 NBC mini-series &quot;Lincoln&quot;, based on Gore Vidal&#x27;s book, Nicolay is portrayed by actor Richard Travis. In Steven Spielberg&#x27;s 2012 film &quot;Lincoln&quot;, Nicolay is portrayed by Jeremy Strong. In the 2017 documentary film &quot;The Gettysburg Address&quot;, Nicolay is portrayed by actor William Fichtner.

<text>Jean Nicolet (Nicollet), Sieur de Belleborne (159829 October 1642) was a French &quot;coureur des bois&quot; noted for exploring Lake Michigan, Mackinac Island, Green Bay, and being the first European to set foot in what is now the U.S. state of Wisconsin.

==Early life==
Nicolet (Nicollet) was born in Cherbourg, France, in the late 1590s, the son of Thomas Nicollet, who was &quot;messenger ordinary of the King between Paris and Cherbourg&quot;, and Marguerite de Lamer. They were members of the Roman Catholic Church. He was a known friend of Samuel de Champlain and Étienne Brule, and was attracted to Canada to participate in Champlain&#x27;s plan to train young French men as explorers and traders by having them live among Native Americans, at a time when the French were setting up fur trading under the &quot;Compagnie des Marchands.&quot;

==Arrival at Quebec==
In 1618, Nicolet immigrated to Quebec as a clerk to train as an interpreter for the &quot;Compagnie des Marchands&quot;, a trading monopoly owned by members of the French aristocracy. As an employee, Jean Nicolet was a faithful supporter of the &quot;Ancien Régime&quot;.

To learn the language of the First Nations, Nicolet was sent to live with the Algonquins on Allumette Island, a friendly settlement located along the important Ottawa River fur trade route. Upon his return to Quebec in 1620, he was assigned to live among the Odawa and Algonquin people in the Lake Nipissing region. During his nine-year stay, he ran a store and traded with the native peoples in the area.

He had a relationship with a Nipissing woman, and they had a daughter, whom he named Euphrosine-Madeleine Nicolet. When Nicolet returned to Quebec, he brought his daughter Euphrosine with him to educate her among the French. On July 19, 1629, when Quebec fell to the Kirke brothers who took control for England, Jean Nicolet fled to the safety of the Huron country. He worked from there against English interests until the French were restored to power. After Canada was restored to France he married Marguerite Couillard. Marguerite, the daughter of leading Quebec settler and his wife Marie-Guillemette Hébert, was also the goddaughter of Champlain. The couple were residents of Trois-Rivières in later life, where they raised children.

==Exploration of Wisconsin==

Nicolet is noted for being the first European to explore Lake Michigan. In 1634 he became the first European to explore what would become Wisconsin. Jean Nicolet landed at Red Banks, near modern-day Green Bay, Wisconsin, in search of a passage to the Orient. He and other French explorers had learned from their native contacts that the people who lived along these shores were called &quot;Ho-Chunk,&quot; which some French mistakenly translated as &quot;People of the Sea&quot;. In the Ho Chunk language, it means people of the big voice, because they believe their language was the original language of their family of tribal languages. However, the Ojibwe had a less appealing name for them, Winnebago, or &quot;people of the fragrant waters,&quot; translated to French as, Puants or Puans. This exonym was derogatory, however, not knowing that, Nicolet concluded that the people must be from or near the Pacific Ocean and would provide a direct contact with China.

Nicolet became the French ambassador to the Ho-Chunk people. He wore brightly colored robes and carried two pistols, to convey his authority. The Ho-Chunk people appreciated his ritual display. With some Ho-Chunk guides, Nicolet ascended the Fox River, portaged to the Wisconsin, and travelled down it until it began to widen. So sure, was he that he was near the ocean, that he stopped and went back to Quebec to report his discovery of a passage to the &quot;South Sea,&quot; unaware that he had just missed finding the upper Mississippi River.

==Recent controversy==
In the last couple decades , some have questioned the traditional account of Nicolet&#x27;s arrival in Green Bay, saying that Nicolet was not looking for a route to China, did not wear a Chinese robe, and did not meet the Puans at Red Banks. Ronald Stiebe proposed that Nicolet did not even go to Lake Michigan but that the Puants were actually Algonquin people and Nicolet met them at Keweenaw Bay, Michigan. Nancy Oestreich Lurie, of the Milwaukee Public Museum—followed by Patrick J. Jung, of the Milwaukee School of Engineering —concluded that Nicolet actually met the Puans near Menominee, Michigan. Although the Menominee people and the Puants were different tribes, they were allies who jointly controlled access to Green Bay. Also, the Menominee would have been able to serve as interpreters for Nicolet in negotiations with the Puans. Lurie and Jung propose that the main purpose of Nicolet&#x27;s mission was to establish peace between New France and the Puants and an alliance against the Iroquois people.

==Death==
On October 29th, 1642, Jean Nicolet drowned after his boat capsized just off of Quebec City in Saint Lawrence River. He was either 43 or 44 years old. His body was never found.

<text>The president of the European Parliament presides over the debates and activities of the European Parliament. They also represent the Parliament within the European Union (EU) and internationally. The president&#x27;s signature is required for laws initiated under co-decision and the EU budget.

Presidents serve 2.5-year terms, normally alternating between the two major political parties. There have been 30 presidents since the Parliament was created in 1952, 17 of whom have served since the first parliamentary election in 1979. Three presidents have been women and most have come from the older member states.

==Role in Parliament==
The president chairs debates and oversees all the activities of the Parliament and its constituent bodies (ensuring the Parliament&#x27;s rules of procedure are applied), in this the role is similar to that of a speaker in a national parliament. Below the president, there are 14 vice-presidents who chair debates when the president is not in the chamber. The president also chairs the meetings of the Bureau, which is responsible for budgetary and administration issues, and the Conference of Presidents, which is a governing body composed of the presidents of each of the parliament&#x27;s political groups.

==Position in the Union==
The president represents Parliament in all legal matters and external relations, particularly international relations. When the European Council meets, the president addresses it to give the Parliament&#x27;s position on subjects on the council&#x27;s agenda. The president also takes part in Intergovernmental Conferences on new treaties. The president&#x27;s signature is also required for the budget of the European Union and Union acts adopted under codecision procedure to be adopted. The president also chairs conciliation committees with the Council under these areas.

In most countries, the protocol of the head of state comes before all others. However, in the EU the Parliament is listed as the first institution, and hence the protocol of its president comes before any other European, or national, protocol. The gifts given to numerous visiting dignitaries depends upon the president. President Josep Borrell MEP of Spain gave his counterparts a crystal cup created by an artist from Barcelona which had engraved upon it parts of the Charter of Fundamental Rights among other things.

With the reorganisation of leading EU posts under the Lisbon Treaty, there was some criticism of each post&#x27;s vague responsibilities. Ukrainian ambassador to the EU Andriy Veselovsky praised the framework and clarified it in his own terms: The president of the European Commission speaks as the EU&#x27;s &quot;government&quot; while the president of the European Council is a &quot;strategist&quot;. The high representative specialises in &quot;bilateral relations&quot; while the European commissioner for enlargement and European neighbourhood policy deals in technical matters such as the free trade agreement with Ukraine. The Parliament&#x27;s president meanwhile articulates the EU&#x27;s values such as democratic elections in other countries.

==Election==

The president is elected by the members of Parliament for a two-and-a-half-year term, meaning two elections per parliamentary term, hence two presidents normally serve during any one Parliamentary term. Since the 1980s, the two major parties in the Parliament, the European People&#x27;s Party (EPP) and Party of European Socialists (PES), have had the custom of sharing the two presidencies between themselves. For example, in the 2004–2009 legislature the EPP supported the PES candidate for president and, when his term expired in 2007, the PES supported the EPP&#x27;s candidate. This resulted in large majorities for presidents, although there are some exceptions: in the 1999–2004 legislature, under an EPP–Liberal deal, the president for the second half of the term was a Liberal, rather than a Socialist.

Starting from the 2009–2014 session of the Parliament the outgoing president presides over the election of the new president, provided that the outgoing president is re-elected as an MEP. If the outgoing president is not re-elected as an MEP then one of the 14 vice-presidents takes up the role. While the outgoing president or vice-president is in the chair, they hold all the powers of the president, but the only business that may be addressed is the election of the new president.

Before the ballot nominations are handed to the chair who announces them to Parliament. If no member holds an absolute majority after three ballots, a fourth is held with only the two members holding the highest number of votes on the previous ballot. If there is still a tie following this, the eldest candidate is declared elected.

A number of notable figures have been President of the Parliament and its predecessors. The first president was Paul-Henri Spaak, one of the founding fathers of the Union. Other founding fathers include Alcide de Gasperi and Robert Schuman. The first two female presidents were Simone Veil MEP in 1979 (first president of the elected Parliament) and Nicole Fontaine MEP in 1999, both Frenchwomen. Jerzy Buzek, former prime minister of Poland and member of Solidarity Electoral Action, was elected as the first president from the central and eastern European countries which joined in the 2000s (more precisely, he is the first person from a country that joined the EU after 1986 to hold the post).

===Oldest member===

Prior to 2009, the &quot;oldest member&quot;, the eldest MEP (similar to the Father of the House), presided over the chamber during the election of the president rather than the previous president. The member had all the duties of president but the only business that could be addressed was the election of the president.

In 2009, the Parliament&#x27;s rules were changed so that the outgoing president (if re-elected as an MEP) or one of the outgoing vice-presidents would chair the first session of Parliament until a new president was elected.

=== Seventh European Parliament ===
====2009====
The two major factions of the European Parliament, the EPP and the S&amp;D, have reached a formal agreement to share the presidency under the 2009–2014 term. Under the agreement, Jerzy Buzek would be president in the first half of the term and a S&amp;D member would be elected in the second half (2012–2014) of the term. Martin Schulz (SPD, Germany), leader of the S&amp;D group, was speculated as the likely nominee, and in the event he was elected on 17 January 2012.

Buzek&#x27;s presidency is part of the usual People&#x27;s Party – Socialist agreement to have one presidency each of the two during each parliament. For the 2009–2014 term Buzek gets the post for the first term of office of two and a half years, and someone from the Socialists will get it for the second. The 2004–2009 parliamentary term saw a great amount of co-operation between the two groups following on from the 1999–2004 term which saw an EPP-ELDR alliance. The Socialist candidate would be Martin Schulz who was unanimously nominated by the group. Diana Wallis (Liberal) and Nirj Deva (Conservative) also announced candidacies.

Meanwhile, Graham Watson, the leader of ALDE, stated he wished to challenge this system of carving up the post, and presented himself as a candidate. He made a point of running a public campaign, to contrast against the closed-doors agreement of Peoples Party-Socialists, which he claimed was the first such campaign to be run. Through this, he also stated he hoped to open up a debate on the role of the president and make the figure more dynamic, to counterbalance the growing power of the presidency of the Council of the European Union. However, on 8 July 2009 Watson announced that he withdrew his candidacy thus leaving Buzek with only one opponent. The other official candidate was Eva-Britt Svensson, nominated from EUL-NGL. She campaigned with the slogan &quot;a different voice&quot;. She was the first MEP from Sweden to candidate to the position.

In the first vote of the new Parliament Jerzy Buzek (EPP, Poland) was elected Parliament president, winning with 555 votes to 89 votes over his opponent Eva-Britt Svensson (EUL-NGL, Sweden).

=== Eighth European Parliament ===
====2017====
At the end of Martin Schulz&#x27;s term, the presidency for the remainder of the eighth European Parliament (2014–2019) would have been due by convention to pass to an EPP member. However, the EPP–S&amp;D agreement appeared broken, making it less certain that Antonio Tajani (EPP, Italy) would be elected president. The other contenders were Gianni Pittella (S&amp;D, Italy), Guy Verhofstadt (ALDE, Belgium), Helga Stevens (ECR, Belgium), Eleonora Forenza (GUE/NGL, Italy) and Jean Lambert (Greens/EFA, UK). On 17 January 2017, Tajani was elected after four rounds of voting, following the withdrawal of Verhofstadt and declaration of support for the EPP candidate by the ALDE.

===Ninth European Parliament===
====2019====
The election of the president for the first half of the term of the Ninth European Parliament took place on 3 July 2019. David Sassoli (S&amp;D, Italy) was elected as President in the 2nd round of voting.

====2022====
Following various periods of hospitalisation, David Sassoli died on 11 January 2022, one week before the expiry of his term. Roberta Metsola, as First Vice-President, became the acting president.

The election to choose Sassoli&#x27;s successor took place as previously scheduled on 18 January 2022. The candidates were the acting president Roberta Metsola (EPP, Malta), Alice Bah Kuhnke (Greens/EFA, Sweden), Kosma Złotowski (ECR, Poland; withdrew before the vote), and Sira Rego (The Left, Spain). Metsola was elected in the first round of voting, having secured an absolute majority of 458 out of votes cast. On her election, Metsola became the youngest president ever, the first Maltese person to hold the office, and the first female president since 2002 (and only third female president ever).

===Tenth European Parliament===
====2024====

The election for the president of the Tenth European Parliament took place on 16 July 2024. Metsola was re-elected on the first ballot with the highest vote total ever for the office.

==List of officeholders==

The list below includes all presidents as far back as 1952. However the Parliament is ambiguous about whether it sees continuity between the Common Assembly and the post-1958 European Communities Parliamentary Assembly. For example, the 50th anniversary of the European Parliament was celebrated in 2008, not 2002 (so Jerzy Buzek would be the 24th president, not the 28th). However, the official portraits of past presidents do start with the first president of the Common Assembly, Paul-Henri Spaak.

<doc id="764169" wikidata="Q2560318" url="?curid=764169" title="Society for the Propagation of the Faith">
<text>The Society for the Propagation of the Faith (Latin: &quot;Propagandum Fidei&quot;) is an international association coordinating assistance for Catholic missionary priests, brothers, and nuns in mission areas. The society was founded in Lyon, France, in 1822, by Pauline Jaricot. It is the oldest of four Pontifical Mission Societies of the Catholic Church.
==Origin and development==
In 1815, Bishop Louis William Valentine Dubourg of New Orleans, Louisiana was in Lyon collecting alms for his diocese, which was in a precarious condition. To a Mrs. Petit, whom he had known in the United States, he expressed the idea of founding a charitable association for the support of Louisiana missions, which suggestion she cordially embraced, but could procure only small alms among her friends and acquaintances.

Separately, in 1820, Pauline Jaricot of Lyon received a letter from her brother, a student at the Seminary of St. Sulpice, in which he described the extreme poverty of the members of the Paris Foreign Missions Society. She conceived the idea of forming an association whose members would contribute one cent a week for the missions. The membership rose to a thousand and the offerings were sent to Asia.

In 1822, Father Inglesi, Vicar-General of New Orleans, was sent to Lyon by Bishop Dubourg to visit his benefactors and reanimate their zeal. Seeing the success of Miss Jaricot, they thought at first of establishing a similar society for American missions, but decided to unite, instead of dividing, efforts. A meeting of the friends of the missions called by Father Inglesi was attended by twelve ecclesiastics and laymen, and on 3 May 1822, the Society for the Propagation of the Faith was formally established, with a declared mission to help Catholic missionaries by prayers and alms. The very first collection of the Propagation of the Faith in 1822 supported the vast Diocese of Louisiana and the Two Floridas in the United States, which then extended from the Florida to Canada, as well as the missions in China. Pope Leo XIII designated Jaricot as the official founder of the society.
The society&#x27;s goal was to support missions worldwide, which excluded majority-Catholic countries like France, Italy, Austria, Spain, and Portugal. As soon as missions are able to exist by their own efforts the society discontinues its aid, because demands are many and resources inadequate. In 1827, The Diocese of New York received its first grant of $1,776.00. In 1842, the Church of St. Vincent de Paul, on Canal Street, a parish for French-speaking residents, was built with money received from the Propagation. In 1853 St. Vincent de Paul became the location of the first chapter of the Society in New York.

In 1823, a delegate was sent to Rome and the group received the blessing of Pope Pius VII.
In 1840, Gregory XVI placed the society in the rank of Universal Catholic institutions, and on 25 March 1904, in the first year of his pontificate, Pius X recommended it to the charity of all the faithful, praising its work, and raising the feast of its patron saint, Francis Xavier, to a higher rite. A large number of provincial and national councils (especially the third of the Plenary Councils of Baltimore, 1884), as well as thousands of bishops from all parts of the world, have likewise enacted decrees and published letters in favour of its development. It receives contributions from all parts of the Christian world.

==Apostolate==
Pontifical status was granted to the Society on May 3, 1922 and its central administration was transferred to Rome. In 1926, Pope Pius XI established an annual collection for the missionary work of the Church called &quot;World Mission Sunday&quot;. World Mission Sunday is organized by the Society for the Propagation of the Faith. The Society is under the direction of the Dicastery for Evangelization. The national office for the Society for the Propagation of the Faith in the United States is located in New York.

The Society for the Propagation of the Faith concentrates its efforts to communities in Africa, Asia, the Pacific Islands, and remote area of Latin America. It provides financial support to mission bishops for day-to-day expenses and special projects. It supports pastoral and evangelizing programs, catechists and catechetical work, the building of churches and chapels, the work of Religious communities in health care and education, and for communication and transportation needs.

Allocations are based on the reports of the superiors of the missions, bishops, vicars and prefects Apostolic; and in consideration of the desires of the pope. It is a law of the society to make its affairs public, and each year an integral account of all money received, all appropriations made, and all expenditures is published in the &quot;Annals&quot;. All money received is distributed each year to more than 1,100 mission dioceses and vicariates around the world. There is no permanent endowment.

The society also publishes &quot;MISSION Magazine&quot;, formerly &quot;Mission Today&quot;.

===England and Wales===
The society works in England and Wales with the Mill Hill Missionary Society. Mill Hill was one of the first societies to introduce lay missionaries; and its priests, lay brothers and associates work in 27 countries on every inhabited continent.

In England and Wales funds for the missions are collected through the famous red collection boxes.

<text>William Guglielmo Niederland (29 August 1904 – 30 July 1993) was a German-American psychoanalyst and a pioneer in the scholarly field of psychogeography. 

==Early life==
William Guglielmo Niederland was born in Schippenbeil, East Prussia, the son of an orthodox rabbi, and in early life was exposed to both the classic Talmudic education and to the secular learning of the Realgymnasium of Würzburg, Bavaria. 

==Medical career==
After completing his medical studies at the University of Würzburg, Niederland went on to an internship and residency in medicine. For years he served as an officer of the Department of Health for the industrial region of the Ruhr. 

In the 1950s Niederland began work with concentration camp survivors. He investigated and documented the particular characteristics of their reactions, coining the term &quot;survivor syndrome&quot; in 1961. He later worked with the Vietnam Veteran Working Group in restoring the concept of post-traumatic stress disorders to the American Psychiatric Association&#x27;s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-III) in 1980. 

==Publications==
Niederland is the author of &quot;The Schreber Case: Psychoanalytic Profile of a Paranoid Personality&quot; (1974), which is about Daniel Paul Schreber.

<doc id="764174" wikidata="Q708881" url="?curid=764174" title="Arthur Nielsen">
<text>Arthur Charles Nielsen Sr. (September 5, 1897 – June 1, 1980) was an American businessman, electrical engineer and market research analyst who created and tracked the Nielsen ratings for television as founder of the A.C. Nielsen Company.

==Background==
Nielsen was born in Chicago, Illinois. Nielsen was educated at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, where he received a B.S., summa cum laude in electrical engineering in 1918. He was a member of Tau Beta Pi (engineering honor society), the Sigma Phi Society and a captain of the varsity tennis team from 1916 to 1918. He subsequently served in the U.S. Naval Reserve.

==Career==
Nielsen worked as an electrical engineer for the Isko Company from 1919 to 1920 and for the H. P. Gould Company, both in Chicago, from 1920 to 1923. He founded the ACNielsen company in 1923, and in doing so advanced the new field of market research. This involved: (1.) test marketing new products to determine their viability prior to costly mass marketing and production; and (2.) measuring product sales at a random sample of stores to determine market share. Careful statistical sampling was crucial to this process. The techniques developed by Nielsen were especially important for the efficient operation of a market prior to the introduction of computerized digital networks that in the 1990s enabled continuous and comprehensive monitoring of sales by product retailers. Nielsen was also a pioneer in developing methods of measuring the audience of radio and television broadcasting programs, most notably the Nielsen ratings.

Nielsen inaugurated a National Radio Index for broadcasters and advertisers in 1942, followed by a television ratings service in 1950. By the time of his death, the company&#x27;s revenue was US$398 million annually.

==Personal life==
With his son Arthur Nielsen Jr. he won the U.S. Father and Son doubles tennis titles in 1946 and 1948. He was elected to the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1971 for his contributions to the sport. The University of Wisconsin awarded him an honorary Doctor of Science (ScD) in 1974. Nielsen was appointed a Knight of the Order of the Dannebrog, &quot;Ridder af Dannebrog&quot; (1961) by the king of Denmark.

Nielsen and his wife Gertrude (also a Wisconsin grad; d.1998) donated the Nielsen Tennis Stadium to the University of Wisconsin–Madison. In 1990, the A.C. Nielsen family made a donation to UW-Madison to establish the A.C. Nielsen Center for Marketing Analytics and Insights, which provides MBA, MS, and certificate programs in marketing research, consumer insights, and analytics. It is the only full-time market research program in the United States. A small tennis center in Winnetka, Illinois, is named after him.

===ACNielsen Jr.===

Nielsen&#x27;s oldest son had four siblings. He graduated from the University of Wisconsin and married Patricia McKnew; the couple had two sons, Arthur II and Chris, and a daughter. Jr. died in 2011, and his wife in 2005. They had seven grandchildren. Arthur Charles Nielsen Jr was described by The New York Times as having institutionalized his father&#x27;s innovations, including &quot;urging&quot; the company to purchase a $150,000 Univac computer in 1948.

<text>A proskynetarion (Greek &quot;προσκυνητάριον&quot;, plural proskynetaria; from &quot;προσκύνησις&quot;, proskynesis, lit. &#x27;kiss towards something&#x27;) is a term suggesting worship and reverence, which has several concrete applications.

==Islamic cultic place or object==
As a rare Byzantine term meaning &quot;oratory&quot; or &quot;place of worship&quot;, it was used for Islamic cultic places or objects.

==Monumental icon==
&quot;Proskynetarion&quot; can mean a monumental icon of the Eastern Orthodox Church usually depicting Christ, the Virgin Mary, or the patron saint of a church. Proskynetaria were usually made of mosaic or fresco in a marble frame and placed on the piers separating the parts of a templon in a Byzantine church, though proskynetaria of patron saints were often in the narthex or on the nave walls.

==Pilgrim&#x27;s guide to the Holy Land==
Proskynetaria were also a genre of Orthodox Christian pilgrim guides to the Holy Land, which appeared in the mid-17th century and flourished during the 18th. The usually small-format, accessibly written books served as practical itinerary suggestions, with descriptions of the pilgrimage sites in Palestine. They were authored either by pilgrims, or by writers who recycled material from existing works.

==Souvenir icon for Holy Land pilgrims==
Large icons painted on canvas and sold as souvenirs to Orthodox Christian pilgrims to the Holy Land. They depicted a topographic overview of Christian holy sites, with the walled city of Jerusalem and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre placed at the centre. They represent the most visually attractive genre of the flourishing local icon industry from the late Ottoman period, 19th-century artists from Palestine dominating the pilgrim souvenir production also in Egypt and Syria. Possibly first created in the second half of the 17th century, the oldest specimen preserved among the several hundred surviving examples is from 1704. In the first half of the 19th century the pattern changed, replacing the topographic depiction with a patchwork of icons, still centred around the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and the Holy Fire ceremony, but surrounded by scenes from the life of Christ and the Akathistos Hymn of the Theotokos. Cheap prints rang death knell of the painted proskynetaria by the end the 19th century.

<text>The Fawn River is a river in southwest Michigan and northeast Indiana in the United States. It flows into the St. Joseph River in the city of Constantine, Michigan. The headwaters rise in a series of lakes and marshes in northern Steuben County, Indiana near Pokagon State Park, where it is known as &quot;Crooked Creek&quot; and &quot;Little Fawn River&quot;. It flows west-northwest across the northeast corner of LaGrange County, Indiana and then over the state line across the southeast corner of Branch County, Michigan before entering St. Joseph County, Michigan. Passing to the south of Sturgis, Michigan, the river meanders across the state line a few more times before flowing north into Constantine. Except for Constantine, the river does not flow through any large communities, although it passes near Fremont, Indiana, Orland, Indiana, Sturgis, Howe, Indiana, and White Pigeon, Michigan.

Fawn River Township, Michigan is named after the river.

<text>Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz ( , ; 6 February 1758 – 21 May 1841) was a Polish poet, playwright and statesman. He was a leading advocate for the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth&#x27;s Constitution of 3 May 1791.

==Early life and education==
Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz was born 6 February 1758 in Skoki, near Brest, Belarus in what was then the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. The son of a moderately well-to-do Polish noble family, Niemcewicz graduated from the Warsaw Corps of Cadets.

==Career==

After graduating from the Corps of Cadets, he subsequently served as aide to Adam Kazimierz Czartoryski and visited France, England and Italy. Niemcewicz served as a deputy to the Great Sejm of 1788–1792 and was an active member of the Patriotic Party that pushed through adoption of the historic Constitution of 3 May 1791. He was subsequently a founder of the Friends of the Constitution, formed to support the implementation of that progressive document. After the victory of the Targowica Confederation in 1792 and the consequent overthrow of the May 3 Constitution, Niemcewicz, along with other Patriotic Party members, emigrated to Germany.

During the Kościuszko Uprising in 1794, Niemcewicz served as aide to Tadeusz Kościuszko. Both were captured by the Russians at the Battle of Maciejowice in 1794 and imprisoned in the Peter and Paul Fortress at St. Petersburg along with Niemcewicz&#x27;s aide-de-camp named Kuźniewski. In 1796, on the death of Tsaritsa Catherine the Great, they were released by Tsar Paul I and made their way together to the United States. They sailed on the ship &quot;Adriana&quot; from Bristol, in England, in the company of the Portuguese abbot and botanist, José Correia da Serra, who served as the chaplain on ship for Niemcewicz and Kościuszko. They arrived in Philadelphia on August 18, 1797. During his stay, he visited Niagara Falls. In 1798, he was elected a member of the American Philosophical Society.

Niemcewicz was upset when Kościuszko decamped for Europe without giving him any notice. After Napoleon&#x27;s 1807 invasion of Poland, Niemcewicz returned to Warsaw and was made secretary of the senate. After the Congress of Vienna, he was secretary of state and president of the constitutional committee in Poland. In the years of the Kingdom of Poland Niemcewicz was the central figure of Polish cultural life and his moral influence was sometimes compared with political and military strength of Grand Duke Constantine.

On 11 May 1830, he unveiled a new landmark before the Staszic Palace, the seat of the Society of Friends of Science in Warsaw — a monument to Nicolaus Copernicus sculpted by Bertel Thorvaldsen. During the failed November Uprising of 1830–31, Niemcewicz was a member of the insurrectionary Polish government. In the final months of the Uprising the poet went on a diplomatic mission to London (as the last Polish envoy to Britain) and he remained in exile, first in Britain, then in France, until his death in 1841.

===Works===
As a writer, Niemcewicz tried many styles of composition. His political comedy, &quot;The Return of the Deputy&quot; (1790), enjoyed great acclaim. His novel, &quot;John of Tenczyn&quot; (1825), written in the style of Sir Walter Scott, gives a vigorous picture of old Poland. He also wrote a &quot;History of the Reign of Sigismund III&quot; (3 volumes, 1819) and a collection of memoirs for ancient Polish history (6 volumes, 1822–23).

Niemcewicz&#x27;s 1817 pamphlet &quot;Rok 3333 czyli sen niesłychany&quot; (The Year 3333, or an Incredible Dream), first published posthumously in 1858, describes a Poland transformed into a sinister Judeo-Polonia. The pamphlet has been described as &quot;the first Polish work to develop on a large scale the concept of an organized Jewish conspiracy directly threatening the existing social structure.&quot; His collected works were published in 12 volumes at Leipzig in 1838–40.

==Personal life==

While in the United States, Niemcewicz met and married the wealthy widow, Mrs. Livingston Kean (née Susan Livingston) in 1800 who had hired him as a tutor for her son Peter Kean. Susan, a member of the Livingston family, was the daughter of Peter Van Brugh Livingston and the widow of John Kean, a delegate from South Carolina to the Continental Congress.

He died on 21 May 1841 in Paris, France, aged 83, and was buried at Champeaux Cemetery in Montmorency, Val-d&#x27;Oise.

<text>A Wound Chevron was a United States military insignia authorized for wear on the service uniform between 1918 and 1932. The Wound Chevron was a gold metallic-thread chevron on an Olive Drab backing displayed on the lower right cuff of a US military uniform. It denoted wounds which were received in combat against an enemy force or hospitalization following a gassing.

==History==

===Army Wound Ribbon===

The original Army Wound Ribbon was created on September 6, 1917, to recognize those soldiers who had received combat wounds during World War I. The Wound Ribbon was established by Secretary of War Newton D. Baker on September 6, 1917, and implemented by Paragraph XI-1 of War Department General Orders Number 134 of October 12, 1917. However, it was rescinded by Paragraph 1(d) of War Department General Orders Number 6 of January 12, 1918, which replaced it with wound chevrons.

The Wound Chevron was a replacement insignia for the short-lived Army Wound Ribbon of 1917 and was issued to Army, Navy and Marine Corps personnel who had been wounded in combat.

===Purple Heart===
In 1932, with the creation of the Purple Heart, Wound Chevrons were no longer awarded. A directive of the United States War Department and United States Navy Department permitted soldiers to exchange wound chevrons for the new Purple Heart medal. This was not required, however, and some Army personnel elected to retain wound chevrons for wear on their uniforms instead of the Purple Heart. For those who were subsequently wounded, both the original wound chevrons and the Purple Heart medal were worn simultaneously. It is historically agreed that regulations did not permit wearing both the Purple Heart and the Wound Chevron at the same time; however, photographic evidence indicates that this was often done by veterans of both the First World War and Second World War. Its wear on the uniform was abolished in 1953, as the Overseas Service Bars were moved there.

In the modern military, the Wound Chevron is considered obsolete. The decoration is very similar to the Overseas Chevron, which in World War I was worn on the left sleeve.

<text>The &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot; Trading Card Game is a collectible card game developed and published by Konami. Initially introduced in Kazuki Takahashi&#x27;s iconic manga as a parody of during the manga&#x27;s &quot;variety tabletop horror&quot; era as Magic &amp; Wizards, the fictional game eventually evolved into Duel Monsters, which appears in portions of the manga franchise and is the central plot device throughout its various anime adaptations and spinoff series after it&#x27;s introduction. From there, after streamlining Takahashi&#x27;s otherwise hyper-dramatized fictional ruleset, Duel Monsters was treated as a basis for the real life Yu-Gi-Oh! card game.

The trading card game was launched by &quot;Konami&quot; in 1999 in Japan and March 2002 in North America. It was named the top selling trading card game in the world by Guinness World Records on July 7, 2009, having sold over 22 billion cards worldwide. As of March 31, 2011, Konami Digital Entertainment Co., Ltd. Japan sold billion cards globally since 1999. , the game is estimated to have sold about cards worldwide. &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot; Speed Duel, a faster and simplified version of the game, was launched worldwide in January 2019. Another faster-paced variation, &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot; Rush Duel, launched in Japan in April 2020.

==Gameplay==
In the trading card game, players draw cards from their respective decks and take turns playing cards onto &quot;the field&quot;. Each player uses a deck containing forty to sixty cards, and an optional &quot;extra deck&quot; of up to fifteen cards. There is also an optional fifteen-card side deck, which allows players to swap cards from their main deck and/or extra deck between games. Players are restricted to three of each card per deck and must follow the Forbidden/Limited card list, which restricts selected cards by Konami to be limited to two, one, or zero. Each player starts with 8,000 &quot;life points&quot; (LP) (Though the players can decide to start with more or less in casual games), with the main aim of the game to use monster attacks (and sometimes card effects) to reduce the opponent&#x27;s life points. The game ends upon reaching one of the following conditions:
* A player loses if their life points reaches zero.
* A player loses if they are required to draw a card, but have no more cards to draw in the main deck.
* Certain cards have special conditions which trigger an automatic win or loss when its conditions are met (e.g. having all five cards of &quot;Exodia the Forbidden One&quot; in the hand, playing all five cards of the &quot;Destiny Board&quot; on the field, or having &quot;Ghostrick Angel of Mischief&quot; on the field with ten XYZ materials).
* A player can forfeit at any time.
If both players trigger a win/lose condition at the same time (e.g. both players&#x27; life points reach zero), the game ends in a draw.

===Zones===
Cards are laid out in the following manner:
* Main Deck: Main deck is placed here face-down, and can consist of 40 to 60 cards. Normal, Effect, Ritual, and Pendulum monsters can be stored here. Spell and Trap cards are also stored here.
* Extra Deck: Extra deck is placed here face-down, if they have one, and may have 15 cards consisting of Fusion, Synchro, Xyz, and Link monster cards. Pendulum monsters are also placed here face-up when they would otherwise be sent from the field to the Graveyard.
* Graveyard (GY): A zone where cards are sent to when they are discarded or destroyed, like monsters that have been tributed or destroyed, or most spell/trap cards after they have been activated.
* Main Monster Zones: A field of five spaces where monster cards are placed when successfully Summoned. Prior to the addition of Link monsters, any kind of monster could be placed there at any time. After Link monsters were introduced, monsters from the extra deck could only be Special Summoned from the extra deck to the extra monster zone, or a main monster zone a Link monster points to, up until the rule change for April 2020 onward, where only Link monsters and Pendulum monsters summoned from the extra deck follow this restriction.
* Extra Monster Zones: Introduced with Link monsters, this is a zone where monsters from the extra deck can be Summoned. An extra monster zone is not a part of either player&#x27;s field until they Summon a monster to the extra monster zone, meaning they are shared between the players.
* Spell/Trap Zones: Five spaces in which either spell or trap cards can be placed. The leftmost and rightmost spell/trap zones can optionally be treated as &quot;Pendulum zones&quot; by placing Pendulum monsters there, allowing players to use Pendulum effects and perform Pendulum Summons.
** The Pendulum Zones originally were at the left and right sides of the main monster and spell/trap zones when introduced with the &quot;Arc-V&quot; era, but were integrated into the leftmost and rightmost spell/trap zones during the &quot;VRAINS&quot; era.
* Field Zone: A zone where field spell cards are placed.
* Banishment: A zone where cards that are &quot;banished&quot; by card effects are sent.

===Phases===
Each player&#x27;s turn contains six phases that take place in the following order:
* Draw Phase: The turn player draws one card from their deck.
* Standby Phase: No specific action occurs, but it exists for card effects and maintenance costs that activate or resolve during this specific phase.
* Main Phase 1: The turn player may Normal Summon or Set a monster, activate cards and effects that they control, change the battle position of a monster (provided it was not summoned this turn), and Set Spells or Traps face-down.
* Battle Phase: The turn player may choose to attack their opponent using any monsters on their field in Attack Position. Depending on the position of opposing monster, the attacking monster&#x27;s ATK points are taken into account against the opposing monster&#x27;s ATK or DEF points. If both monsters are in Attack Position, the monster with fewer ATK points is destroyed and its owner takes life point damage equal the difference between both monster&#x27;s ATK points (if both monsters have equal ATK points, they are both destroyed and no damage is taken, unless both of their ATK points are 0, in which case neither is destroyed). If the opposing monster is in Defense Position and has fewer DEF points than the attacking monster&#x27;s ATK points, it is destroyed and the owner takes no damage. However, if its DEF point is equal or higher, the attacker takes life point damage equal to the difference between the two values and neither monster is destroyed. If the defending player has no monsters defending them, a Direct Attack can be performed, with the defending player receiving life point damage equal to the attacking monster&#x27;s ATK points. The turn player can choose to not enter the battle phase and instead go to the end phase.
* Main Phase 2: The player may do all the same actions that are available during main phase 1, though they cannot repeat certain actions already taken in main phase 1 (such as Normal Summoning) or change the battle position of a monster that has already been summoned, attacked, or had their battle position changed during the same turn. This phase is only accessible if the battle phase was entered.
* End Phase: The player declares the end of their turn. Certain card effects and maintenance costs may activate or resolve during this specific phase.

At the start of a game, the starting player cannot enter the draw or battle phases during their first turn.

===Card types===
Gameplay revolves around three types of cards: monster, spell, and trap cards. Monster cards are monsters used to attack and defend against the opposing player, mainly for the purpose of damaging an opponent&#x27;s life points. Spells, which can either be played from the hand or set for later use, provide various effects such as altering a monster&#x27;s strength, drawing additional cards, or removing an opponent&#x27;s cards from the field. Traps are cards that are set on the field in advance and activated in later turns when certain conditions are met, such as when an opponent targets a player&#x27;s monster.

With some exceptions, a typical monster card possesses ATK and DEF points that determine its attack and defense power in battles, a level represented by stars, with more powerful monsters typically being of higher levels, an attribute that certain effects may react to, and a description listing the monster&#x27;s types and any effects or summoning conditions they may have. Monsters are summoned to the field through three main categories of summoning: Normal, Tribute, and Special. Once during a player&#x27;s main phase, they can choose to normal summon a level 4 or lower normal or effect monster from their hand, in face-up attack position or face-down defense position, or tribute summon a level 5 or higher monster by tributing one or more monsters already on the field. Special summons are performed by utilising card effects or fulfilling the conditions of other summoning methods, such as those used to summon cards from the extra deck, and may be performed as many times as desired if the conditions are met.

The game currently features the following types of monster.
* Normal (yellow): A monster with no effects of its own, instead simply having a description of the monster. Stored in the main deck and can be normal, tribute, or special summoned. Due to their lack of a effect, they are rarely played in the modern competitive game, unless there is an archetype (a series of thematically related cards that support each other) that centers on a particular normal monster; an example would be the &quot;Dark Magician&quot; archetype.
* Effect (orange): A monster that possesses at least one effect. Can be summoned in the same manner as normal monsters.
* Ritual (blue): Stored in the main deck, these monsters can typically only be special summoned by using a ritual spell card and tributing required monsters listed in its instructions that meets the ritual monster level or is greater than its level.
* Fusion (purple): Stored in the extra deck, these monsters are summoned by utilising cards with a &quot;fusion&quot; effect, such as the Spell &quot;Polymerization&quot;, and Using monsters listed in the monster&#x27;s description. Another mechanic Fusion monsters possess is the ability to fusion summon without a spell card, they are instead summoned by following the requirement for the monster materials written on the card.
* Synchro (white): Stored in the extra deck, these monsters are summoned by using from the field a tuner-type monster and one or more non-tuner-type monsters whose levels equal the level of the synchro monster being summoned.
* Xyz (black): Stored in the extra deck, these monsters possess ranks as opposed to levels, and require two or more monsters whose level is the same as the Xyz monster&#x27;s rank. These monsters become the Xyz monster&#x27;s &quot;overlay units&quot;, which can then be sent to the GY by &quot;detaching&quot; them to activate effects. Besides the usual Xyz summon, some monsters can be summoned by using a Rank Up Magic/Rank Down Magic Spell card (which summons a Xyz monster of a higher or lower rank than the one that was Used) or by their effect, bypassing the usual summoning requirements.
* Pendulum (green gradient): Variations of other monster types which, if sent from the field to the GY, are placed face up in the extra deck instead. Pendulum monsters can be placed in pendulum zones in the leftmost and rightmost spell/trap zones, where they can utilise pendulum effects. When both pendulum zones contain pendulum monsters with differently valued &quot;pendulum scales&quot;, players can perform a pendulum summon during the main phase to summon multiple monsters from the hand and face-up pendulum monsters from the extra deck whose levels lie between the two pendulum scale values.
* Link (dark blue): Stored in the extra deck, link monsters have link values instead of levels and can only be played in attack position. These are summoned by using one or more monsters on the field as link material that meets the summon requirements, with link monsters able to be used as multiple link material depending on its link value. Link monsters feature arrows which, when pointed towards other zones on the field, allows additional link monsters to be summoned outside of the extra monster zone to the zone those link monsters point to. Link monsters may also possess effects that can be used when another card is Co-linked.
* Token (grey): A low-level monster that can only be summoned through card effects. These cards do not exist outside of the field and are removed from play upon leaving. While official token monster cards do exist, players can use other objects such as coins to represent token monsters.
Also there are subtype monsters with special effects being;
*Flip: Flip monsters have the unique mechanic to use effects when they are turned face-up.
*Union: Union monsters have the unique mechanic to equip or unequip from a monster.
*Gemini: Gemini monsters have the unique mechanic to normal summon while on the field to gain additional effects.
*Toon: Toon monsters have the unique mechanic to attack directly if your opponent has no toon monsters.
Spell cards, green, are magical spells with a variety of effects, such as reviving destroyed monsters. They can be played from the hand during a player&#x27;s turn or placed faced down for activation on a later turn. There are six types of Spell Card:
*Normal: A spell that can only be activated during the player&#x27;s main phase.
*Quick Play: A spell that can be activated from the hand at any time during the player&#x27;s turn, or can be set and activated during an opponent&#x27;s turn. However, they cannot be activated the turn they are set.
*Continuous: A spell with a continuous effect that remains until conditions are met or it is destroyed.
*Equip: A spell that is equipped to a monster, providing it with support effects. It is removed if the monsters leaves the field or is set face-down, or the card is destroyed.
*Field: A spell that is placed in a player&#x27;s field spell zone, which affects the entire field. Each player can only have one field spell in play at a time.
*Ritual: A spell that is required to summon a ritual monster.

Trap cards, dark pink, have to be set on a player&#x27;s field face-down and can only be activated after the turn they were set has passed, including the opponent&#x27;s turn. (Quick play spells, when set, have the same rule.) They are generally used to stop or counter the opponent&#x27;s moves, and come in three varieties.
*Normal: A standard trap that is discarded once its effect resolves.
*Continuous: A trap that remains on the field until destroyed or its conditions are met.
*Counter: A trap that is activated in response to the activation of other cards.

==Rules==

===Chains===
A chain is a stack of card effects activated one after the other. It exists for the management of multiple card effects.

A chain is created when the effects of One or more card are activated at the same time, or when a player activates an effect after a card is played, but before the card impacts the game.

If the effect of a card is activated, the opponent always has the possibility to reply with an effect of their own cards.
*If the opponent replied with an effect, the player can choose to reply back and add another effect to the chain.
*If the opponent chooses not to reply, the player can add a second effect and create a chain off of the activation of their own card. Mandatory effects must be activated before or at the start of chain or right after the chain resolves.
Each player can then continue to add effects to the chain. The chain ends when the players wish to not (or are unable to) play any more cards. Should this happen, the chain is resolved: the resolution is performed in reverse order of play, starting with the effect of the most recently played card.

It is advised to not resolve card effects before ensuring that a chain had not been created.(ask for a Response)

====Example====
The player plays &quot;Raigeki&quot; (a normal spell destroying all of the opponent&#x27;s monsters) (Starting Chain link 1). As a response to the player’s &quot;Raigeki&quot;, their opponent plays &quot;Destruction Jammer&quot; (a counter trap that negates the destruction of a monster by discarding a card) to negate the effects of &quot;Raigeki&quot; (thus placing &quot;Destruction Jammer&quot; in chain link 2). The player then plays &quot;Solemn Judgement&quot; (a counter trap that negates a monster summon and/or the activation of a spell or trap, but at the cost of half of the player&#x27;s LP) (as chain link 3 to negate &quot;Destruction Jammer&quot;&#x27;s effect). Their opponent decides not to reply to &quot;Solemn Judgement&quot;, thus the chain is resolved starting with the highest chain link, which achieves this result:
#&quot;Solemn Judgement&quot; is activated: the player pays half of their LP, and the effect of &quot;destruction jammer&quot; is negated.
#&quot;Destruction Jammer&quot; should have been resolved and negate the effect of &quot;Raigeki&quot;, but &quot;Solemn Judgement&quot; prevents the effect from resolving.
#&quot;Raigeki&quot; is then able to resolve successfully, and all of the opponent&#x27;s monsters are destroyed.

A chain can only be created when a card or effect is activated. Summoning or tributing a monster, changing position or paying a cost do not represent valid effects. Thus, it is not possible to reply to a chain with these effects.

==Product information==
&quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot; Trading Cards are available in Starter decks, Structure decks, booster packs, collectible tins, and occasionally as promotional cards.

=== Booster packs ===
As in all other trading card games, booster packs are the primary avenue of card distribution. In Konami&#x27;s distribution areas, five or nine random cards are found in each booster pack depending on the set and each set contains around one hundred different cards. However, in Upper Deck&#x27;s areas, early booster packs contained a random assortment of nine cards (rarity and value varies), with the whole set ranging around one hundred and thirty cards. To catch up with the Japanese meta game, two or more original sets were combined into one. Now, more recent Upper Deck sets have simply duplicated the original set. Some booster sets are reprinted/reissued (e.g. Dark Beginnings Volume 1 and 2). This type of set usually contains a larger number of cards (around 200 to 250), and they contain twelve cards along with one tip card rather than the normal five or nine. Since the release of &quot;Tactical Evolution&quot; in 2007, all booster packs that have a Holographic/Ghost Rare card, will also contain a rare. Current sets have 100 different cards per set. There are also special booster packs that are given to those who attend a tournament. These sets change each time there is a different tournament and have fewer cards than a typical booster pack. There are eight Tournament Packs, eight Champion Packs, and 10 Turbo Packs.

=== Duelist packs ===
Duelist packs are similar to booster packs, albeit are focused around the types of cards used by characters in the various anime series. Cards in each pack are reduced from nine to five.

=== Promotional cards ===
Some cards in the TCG have been released by other means, such as inclusion in video games, movies, and Shonen Jump Magazine issues. These cards often are exclusive and have a special type of rarity or are never-before-seen to the public. Occasionally, cards like Elemental Hero Stratos and Chimeratech Fortress Dragon have been re-released as revisions.

==Formats==
Tournaments are often hosted either by players or by card shops. In addition, Konami, Upper Deck (now no longer part of &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot; organized play), and Shonen Jump have all organized numerous tournament systems in their respective areas. These tournaments attract hundreds of players to compete for prizes such as rare promotional cards.

There are two styles of tournament play called &quot;formats&quot;; each format has its own rules and some restrictions on what cards are allowed to be used during events.

The advanced format is used in all sanctioned tournaments (with the exception of certain Pegasus League formats). This format follows all the normal rules of the game, but also places a complete ban on certain cards that are deemed too powerful or are unsuitable for tournament play. These cards are on a special list called the forbidden, or banned list. There are also certain cards that are limited or semi-limited to only being allowed 1 or 2 of those cards in a deck and side deck combined, respectively. This list is updated several times annually and is followed in all tournaments that use this format.

Traditional format, created in October 2004, is a format where all cards in the advanced format&#x27;s forbidden list are instead allowed at 1 copy per deck, while all other rules are identical. This format is rarely used in competitive play.

The game formerly incorporated worldwide rankings, including a rating system called &quot;COSSY&quot; (Konami card game official tournament support system). COSSY was retired on March 23, 2017.

With the introduction of the Battle Pack: Epic Dawn, Konami has announced the introduction of drafting tournaments. This continued with a second set for sealed play: Battle Pack: War Of The Giants in 2013. The third and final Battle Pack, Battle Pack 3: monster League, was released on July 25, 2014.

There is also &quot;Time Wizard&quot;, a format that relies on the ruleset, card pool and limitations of a specific past date in the trading card game&#x27;s history.

==Alternate Formats==
===&quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot; Speed Duel===
&quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot; Speed Duel is a specialized format of the &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot; Trading Card Game which launched worldwide in January 2019. Inspired by the videogame &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Links&quot;, it features a smaller field and simplified rules, along with a new type of card called Skill card. Skill cards are themed around a particular character of the &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot; series. To use a card in Speed Duel it must have the &quot;Speed Duel&quot; symbol on the card. Cards without the symbol are not legal in Speed Duel format, but Speed Duel cards can be used in all other formats of the Yu-Gi-Oh! TCG. Skill Cards may only be used in Speed Duel.

Speed Duel games are known for its rapid duels, averaging on 10 minutes.

The Speed Duel format follows the same rules as advanced format, with the following differences:
* Each player has 3 Main Monster Zones, 3 Spell &amp; Trap Zones, 1 Field Zone and a Graveyard.
** There are no Extra Monster Zones.
* There is no Main Phase 2.
* Each player begins the Duel with 4000 Life Points.
* Each player begins the Duel with 4 cards in the starting hand.
* Main Deck size is 20 to 30 cards.
* Extra Deck size is up to 6 cards.
* Side Deck size is up to 6 cards.
* Each player can use up to 1 Skill card.
* All cards must have the &quot;Speed Duel&quot; logo.

===&quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot; Rush Duel===
 is a variation of the &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot; Trading Card Game which launched in Japan in April 2020 alongside the release of the &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh! Sevens&quot; anime series. This variation of the game uses a different set of cards from the main &quot;OCG/TCG&quot; entirely, though certain cards appear in Rush Duel. Rush Duel features reworked rules similar to those introduced in Speed Duels and expanded upon with a more streamlined version of the original to make the game faster.

*The playing field now has only three monster zones and three spell/trap zones, and extra monster zones and pendulum zones are not featured.
*The phase order for each turn is draw, main, battle, and end. Unlike the main game, there is no standby phase or main phase 2.
*Players begin the game with four cards each, with the starting player able to draw on their first turn. During the draw phase of each player&#x27;s turn, they must keep drawing until they have five cards in their hand. If the player already has five or more cards in their hand, they may only draw one card. There is no maximum limit to the number of cards players can have in their hand. However, if a player is unable to draw the required amount of cards when asked to (e.g. if the player&#x27;s hand is empty and there are four or less cards remaining in their deck at the start of their draw phase), they will automatically lose the game.
*Players can normal summon and tribute summon as many times as possible during a single turn.
*Certain cards, such as Blue-Eyes White Dragon, are marked with a &quot;legend&quot; icon. Each player may only have one legend card of each card type (monster, spell, trap) in their deck.
*In &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot; Rush Duel every monster effect also has what is known as a &quot;soft once per turn&quot; limit on their effect, meaning each effect of one card may only be used once, but another copy of the same card may use it once as well.
*In addition to normal and effect monsters, there are currently two other monster card types: maximum and fusion. Maximum monsters are sets of three corresponding monster cards that, when assembled in the hand, can be summoned to the field in &quot;maximum mode&quot;, where they are treated as a single powerful monster with its attack power represented by the maximum ATK value on the central card. Fusion monsters, similar to the main game&#x27;s fusion monsters, are stored in the extra deck and summoned using cards with a fusion effect and sending the fusion material monsters from the field to the graveyard. Some fusion monsters possess types not found among main deck monsters based on a fusion of their fusion materials&#x27; types: for example a cyborg type fusion monster is created by fusing a machine type monster with a monster that has a different type. Some fusion monsters possess &quot;selection effects&quot;, allowing players to activate one of multiple effects during their turn if the conditions are met.

==Comparison to other media==
In its original incarnation in Kazuki Takahashi&#x27;s &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot; manga series, &quot;Duel Monsters&quot;, originally known as &quot;Magic &amp; Wizards&quot;, had a rather basic structure, not featuring many of the restricting rules introduced later on and often featuring peculiar exceptions to the rulings in the interest of providing a more engrossing story. Beginning with the Battle City arc of the manga and &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters&quot; anime series, more structured rules such as tribute requirements were introduced to the story, with the series falling more in line with the rules of the real life card-game by the time its spin-off series began. From the &quot;Duel Monsters&quot; anime onwards, characters use cards which resemble their real life counterparts, though some monsters or effects differ between that of the real life trading card game and the manga and anime&#x27;s &quot;Duel Monsters&quot;, with some cards created exclusively for those mediums. Some of those anime original cards have been printed since, usually through various side sets, with their effects being adjusted for the real card came. &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D&#x27;s&quot; featured an anime-original card type known as Dark Synchro, which involved using &quot;Dark Tuners&quot; to summon Dark Synchro monsters with negative levels. Dark Synchro cards were featured in the PlayStation Portable video game, &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D&#x27;s Tag Force 4&quot;, while Dark Synchro monsters featured in the anime were released as standard Synchro monsters in the real-life game. &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V&quot; features Action Cards, spell and trap cards that are picked up in the series&#x27; unique Action Duels, which are not possible to perform in the real life game. In the film &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!: The Dark Side of Dimensions&quot;, an exclusive form of summoning known as Dimension Summoning is featured. This method allows players to freely summon a monster by deciding how many ATK or DEF points it has, but they receive damage equal to that amount when the monster is destroyed. The &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS&quot; anime series features Speed Duels which use a smaller number of monster and Spell &amp; Trap zones and remove main phase 2 for faster duels. In the anime, characters can activate unique Skills depending on the situation (for example, the protagonist Yusaku can draw a random monster when his life points are below 1000) once per duel. A similar ruleset is featured in the &quot;Duel Terminal&quot; arcade machine series and the &quot;Duel Links&quot; mobile game. 

With the exception of the films &quot;Pyramid of Light&quot; and &quot;The Dark Side of Dimensions&quot;, which base the card&#x27;s appearance on the English version of the real-life card game, all Western releases of the &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters&quot; anime and its subsequent spin-off series, produced by 4Kids Entertainment and later Konami Cross Media NY, edit the appearance of cards to differentiate them from their real-life counterparts in accordance with U.S. Federal Communications Commission regulations in concerning program-length commercials, as well as to make the show more marketable across non-English speaking countries. These cards are edited to only display their background, illustration, level/rank, and ATK/DEF points.

== Controversies ==
=== Tokyo Dome Riot ===
On August 1999 Konami held an invite only tournament in Tokyo Dome, where participants could buy packs containing limited edition cards. Despite being invite only, the venue quickly become overcrowded with over 55,000 kids and their parents. Fearing the danger of overcrowding, Konami decided to cancel the event midway. Unfortunately this incited the crowds, as some participant were waiting for four hours only to find out that they will be unable to get said cards. Police were called to defuse the situation.

After this no &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot; events were held in Tokyo Dome until 2024, almost 25 years since the accident.

=== Konami-Upper Deck lawsuit ===
From March 2002 to December 2008, Konami&#x27;s trading cards were distributed in territories outside of Asia by The Upper Deck Company. In December 2008, Konami filed a lawsuit against Upper Deck alleging that it had distributed inauthentic &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot; TCG cards made without Konami&#x27;s authorization. Upper Deck also sued Konami alleging breach of contract and slander. A few months later, a federal court in Los Angeles issued an injunction preventing Upper Deck from acting as the authorized distributor and requiring it to remove the &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot; TCG from Upper Deck&#x27;s website. In December 2009, the court decided that Upper Deck was liable for counterfeiting &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot; TCG cards, and it dismissed Upper Deck&#x27;s countersuit against Konami. Konami is now the manufacturer and distributor of the &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot; TCG. It runs regional and national tournaments and continues to release new &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot; TCG products.

<text>The Jesus Army, also known as the Jesus Fellowship Church and the Bugbrooke Community, was a neocharismatic evangelical Christian movement based in the United Kingdom, part of the British New Church Movement. The name &quot;Jesus Army&quot; was used specifically for the outreach and street-based evangelism for which they were known. The Jesus Fellowship was founded in 1969, when Noel Stanton (1926–2009), at that time the lay pastor of the Baptist chapel in the village of Bugbrooke near Northampton, East Midlands, was inspired by a charismatic experience which led him to successfully expand the congregation, largely by appealing to a younger generation of worshippers. As the new church grew and became more charismatic in nature, many of the original congregation left to continue worshipping in more traditional churches. The Jesus Fellowship grew considerably and by 2007 there were approximately 3,500 members in around 24 congregations in various cities and towns of the UK. The Jesus Fellowship frequently engaged in evangelism in public places, seeking through outreach to demonstrate the love of Jesus and the moving of the Holy Spirit. The Fellowship used various slogans, in its early days adopting &quot;Love, Power &amp; Sacrifice&quot; and later &quot;Jesus People, Loving People&quot;, and the name &quot;Jesus Army&quot;. The church announced in May 2019 that it &quot;will cease to exist and the current National Leadership Team will be stepping down from their roles once the winding up of the central Church has been completed&quot;. Members had voted on 26 May 2019 to revoke the Church&#x27;s constitution, after a decline in membership to less than 1,000 following claims against its founder and two other then members of the church of a history of sexual assault during the 1970s. It was planned that the Jesus Centres charity the church created would continue to operate and that individual churches would become independent congregations. Fewer than 200 people were still living in communal households of the Jesus Fellowship. In October 2021, Companies House certified the change of name from &quot;Jesus Centres Trust&quot; (1165925) to &quot;JCT - Joining Communities Together Limited&quot;. Since December 2020, the Jesus Fellowship Community Trust has existed as a residuary body with the sole purpose of winding up the administrative affairs of the Jesus Fellowship Church.

==Distinctive features==
The Jesus Fellowship operated like the house church movements, or the more radical elements of the larger, more conventional churches. It was affected by the charismatic movement of the late 1960s and early 70s, and influenced by the Jesus people movement in the US. According to William Kay, Stanton was highly influenced by Arthur Wallis&#x27;s book &quot;In the Day of Thy Power,&quot; and associated with a number of the early leaders within the British New Church movement. The beliefs of the Jesus Fellowship are in line with historic Christian orthodoxy. Nevertheless, there are various aspects of the Jesus Fellowship&#x27;s way of practising Christianity that are distinctive when compared with more conventional churches.

===Jesus Army, evangelism and ministry to the marginalised===
The UK general public were most likely to be aware of the Jesus Army by its brightly coloured minibuses and coaches and highly visible multi-coloured camouflage jacket often worn by Jesus Army evangelists on the street. The Jesus Army was launched in 1987 as the campaigning identity of the Jesus Fellowship. Following the example of the early Salvation Army, and with a stated intention to &quot;go where others will not go&quot;, the Jesus Army engaged in what has been called &quot;aggressive and effective street evangelism among the marginalized sections of society&quot;. The Jesus Army&#x27;s mission was described as &quot;essentially one to the poor, the disadvantaged and the marginalized&quot;. Since 1987 The Jesus Army held an annual high-profile gospel event in London called London Jesus Day with a three-hour public event on Trafalgar Square, then (until 2005) an evening event in a marquee on Roundwood Park.
===Jesus Army Charitable Trust and Jesus Centres===

Growing from the Jesus Army&#x27;s work among homeless street people, those involved in drug or alcohol abuse, and prisoners and ex-prisoners, the Jesus Army/Jesus Fellowship founded a charitable trust &quot;to develop and enhance its existing work with many disadvantaged groups and individuals&quot;, largely through the founding and running of &quot;Jesus Centres&quot; in UK cities and towns. In 2002, the Jesus Fellowship opened the Coventry Jesus Centre including a Drop-In Centre known as &quot;The Bridge&quot;, which provided services such as a subsidised breakfast, free clothing, showers and hot drinks, as well as social support, job training and providing medical help to vulnerable people. The Centre also assisted in finding rented accommodation for the homeless, though a major emphasis of these activities was evangelistic, &quot;bringing people to Jesus&quot;. Other Jesus Centres were opened in Northampton (2004), Central London (2008) and Sheffield (2011).

===Multiply Christian Network===
The Jesus Fellowship was also linked to around 250 other churches and groups in the UK and elsewhere through the Multiply Christian Network, which it initiated in 1992.

===Youth ministry===
From 2007 to 2017 the Jesus Army hosted a yearly event for young people aged between 15 and 35 called &quot;RAW (Real and Wild)&quot;. In contrast with many Christian churches which often have an aging population, the Jesus Army had a comparatively high proportion of young members.

===New Creation Christian Community===

In the early years of the Jesus Fellowship, a residential Christian community was founded for its growing membership. Initially, a large Anglican rectory in Bugbrooke was purchased and renamed &quot;New Creation Hall&quot;. Several members of the Jesus Fellowship moved in and it became the first centre of a community lifestyle. By 1979, several other large houses in the surrounding area were purchased and &quot;New Creation Christian Community,&quot; as the entire community was named, was established, with some 350 residents. At its height in the early 1990s there were roughly 850 residents in about 60 communal households, but their numbers later dropped to less than 200 persons. Motivation for the Jesus Fellowship&#x27;s venture into residential communal living and the sharing of possessions came primarily from their interpretation of Biblical descriptions of the early church. The Jesus Fellowship&#x27;s community had many features in common with other charismatic Christian intentional communities and part of the initial stimulation towards starting the New Creation Christian Community came from the Church of the Redeemer, Houston, Texas, established by the Episcopalian priest Graham Pulkingham. New Creation Christian Community was one of the largest intentional Christian communities in Europe, charismatic or otherwise. According to sociologist Stephen J. Hunt, the Jesus Fellowship&#x27;s community &quot;has been a source of inspiration and frequently attracts visitors from Europe and beyond who wish to observe, and sometimes imitate, a vibrant and enduring model of charismatic community life.&quot; Residents of each community house ranged in number from 6 to 60 people. The pattern of community life in the largest, down to the smallest residence, was modelled along the same principles and pattern. Those dwelling in a community house, along with the majority of members who lived outside but who are formally attached to it, made up the &quot;church household&quot;. The church household was the basic unit of the Jesus Fellowship, usually comprising both members who lived in community and a majority who did not. Several church households usually came together to form congregations for public worship along with members of the public who wished to attend. Jesus Fellowship congregations typically met in a hired venue such as a school or community centre, although latterly the church purchased &quot;Jesus Centres&quot; in some cities and towns: the Jesus Fellowship in these places used these centres as their venue for public meetings. The community founded a series of Christian businesses (House of Goodness group) employing once up to 250 people. Profits from the businesses helped fund the wider work of the Jesus Fellowship. Businesses and community houses were owned by a Trust Fund ultimately controlled by the members. In 2001, one of the houses was featured in a Channel 4 television documentary, &quot;Battlecentre&quot;.

===Membership===
There were a variety of levels of commitment in the Jesus Fellowship with corresponding types of membership. Those in the loosest forms of membership may have been merely attached to a Jesus Fellowship weeknight &quot;cell group&quot; or attended only on Sundays. Others were more involved. The committed core membership of the Jesus Fellowship consisted of &quot;covenant members&quot;, those who had made a &quot;covenant&quot;, or pledge expressing an intention of lifelong loyalty to the Jesus Fellowship. Even within covenant membership, there were four different &quot;styles&quot;. &quot;Style 1&quot; was the non-resident membership, with a similar membership practice to that of most members of other churches. &quot;Style 2&quot; covenant members entered into closer financial and general accountability. &quot;Style 3&quot; covenant members were the residential members of the New Creation Christian Community: all their income, wealth and possessions were shared, though they may have reclaimed them should they subsequently decide to leave. While they were members, the value of their contribution was protected by the Trust Fund. Becoming a member of the Jesus Fellowship&#x27;s community was a gradual process and most of those who joined the community had already belonged to the Jesus Fellowship as part of its broader membership first. &quot;Style 4&quot; was for covenant members who lived at a distance and were unable to join regularly in the life of the church.

===Celibacy and marriage===
The Jesus Fellowship was the only new church stream that advocated and practised celibacy, claiming that it led to a full life for single people. Within the Jesus Fellowship there were both couples and male and female celibates. The Jesus Fellowship claimed both as high callings. The main justification used for advocating celibacy was that it freed a member for ministry, particularly in the unsocial hours that Jesus Army campaigning required. Some critics maintained that the Jesus Fellowship taught celibacy as a better or higher way, and that single members felt pressured into making the vow. Others denied this and insisted that both marriage and family life, and celibacy were held in high regard in the Jesus Fellowship. Celibacy was, however, described by the Jesus Fellowship as &quot;a precious gem&quot;. At most some 200 Fellowship members were committed to celibacy, plus a further 100 or so probationers. There were instances where committed celibates subsequently entered into married life within the Jesus Fellowship, but this was not taken lightly. Such a step could involve sanctions such as having one&#x27;s leadership responsibilities reduced. Noel Stanton, the Jesus Fellowship&#x27;s original leader, was himself a celibate, and the senior leadership of the church was made up of roughly 50 per cent celibates and 50 per cent who were married. Despite this high view of celibacy, studies indicate that marriage and the family were afforded a high priority by the Jesus Fellowship. According to sociologist Stephen J. Hunt, marriage in the Jesus Fellowship was seen as &quot;a ministering relationship in which human warmth and Christian fellowship can be offered to others, providing spiritual parenting for those who are emotionally damaged&quot;. Hunt found that &quot;where problems in child-rearing occur, support and advice for the parents is on hand from fellow members. Even those children brought up in the New Creation Christian Community are not totally separated from the outside world.&quot; The Jesus Fellowship&#x27;s children attended state schools.

==Beliefs==

The Jesus Fellowship upheld the historic creeds of the Christian faith. The creeds are a set of common beliefs shared with many other Christian churches, and consist of the Apostles&#x27; Creed, the Athanasian Creed and the Nicene Creed. It believed in baptism in water and the Holy Spirit, in the Bible as the Word of God, and in acceptance of charismatic gifts. The Jesus Fellowship defined their Christian beliefs in the following statement:

===Theology and economics===
Underwriting much of the Jesus Fellowship&#x27;s beliefs and practices was a theology of the new creation. Regeneration brought the individual into a spiritual family that incorporated and transcended the biological family. Critics claimed that this had the potential to break up the natural family, but the Jesus Fellowship maintained that many relationships with parents were strengthened and that the Fellowship encouraged (and the community paid for) community members to visit relatives, including visits overseas if family members were abroad. In line with this basic theology, all members were deemed as equal in an economic sense. There was little by way of private property for those who lived in community. Jesus Fellowship community members aimed to &quot;eschew worldly belongings and seek what is perceived as a simple and more ethical form of economic life&quot;. Prosperity theology espoused by many ministries originating in the United States was singled out for particular scorn. Wealth was not regarded as a blessing, particularly for the individual. An official Jesus Fellowship publication stated that &quot;the love of money brings selfishness in human hearts&quot;. As far as the Fellowship was concerned, &quot;wealth for Jesus&quot; meant to benefit of the whole church and the deprived individuals it served. The wealth deposited in the common purse included members&#x27; incomes and salaries. Approximately half of this wealth was used for the needs of the community itself and to fund evangelising endeavour. The other half was re-invested in the fellowship&#x27;s businesses or in paying off bank loans for new business ventures. In many respects the economic structure of the Jesus Fellowship might be said to have been &quot;socialist&quot; in orientation and is most readily seen in the property-less community and the philosophy of &quot;each according to their need&quot;. One writer described the Jesus Fellowship as &quot;careful with both members and money&quot;. New community members were required to over 21 and had to live in a community for a probationary period for two years before being allowed to commit themselves to full community membership. Although New Creation Christian Community members donated all their money to the Community Trust fund, if they later decided to leave the community, their capital was paid back, sometimes with interest. New Creation Christian Community kept its running expenses and its capital completely separate, and has its accounts audited by an international firm of accountants.

==Controversy==

===Sexual, physical, emotional and financial abuse===

Some leaders and members of the Jesus Fellowship committed abuse of children and vulnerable adults, with Noel Stanton and other leaders of the group accused of committing abuse. Several former members were found guilty of sexual abuse of children. Karl Skinner was given a suspended prison sentence for inappropriate behaviour with a young boy, and Alan Carter was sentenced to three years in prison for sex acts on a boy aged between 14 and 16 in the 1990s. After Noel Stanton&#x27;s death in 2009, the church supplied allegations to Northamptonshire Police of sexual offences against Stanton and others, and there were 43 complainants of historic sexual and physical abuse. Ten people from the church were convicted of sex offences, and a report concluded that abuse of women and children was covered up by senior members. A Jesus Fellowship Survivors Association represents about 800 alleged victims. The Jesus Fellowship Community Trust closed in December 2020 following the scandal, and issued a Closure Statement including an unreserved apology for the abuse that occurred in the Jesus Fellowship Church (JFC) and the residential New Creation Christian Community (NCCC). The Jesus Fellowship Redress Scheme was available to those who have suffered harm, abuse and/or adverse experiences within the Jesus Fellowship community. The Redress Scheme closed for applications on 31 December 2023; applications received up to this date will continue to be processed in 2024. The scheme to compensate members identified 539 alleged perpetrators of alleged abuse and revealed about one in six children had been sexually abused. 601 individuals applied for damages, though the trust recognised the true number of victims was likely to be greater. A total of £7.7m has been paid directly to applicants of the scheme. The trust accepted ultimate responsibility for 264 alleged abusers, 61% of them former leaders. Some twelve former members of the Jesus Fellowship Church have been convicted for indecent assaults and other offences.

===Baptist Union and Evangelical Alliance membership===
From its inception, the Jesus Army aroused controversy. The original Bugbrooke Jesus Fellowship had long been a part of the Baptist Union. However, the sudden expansion in members made the new church a nationwide movement. This took it out of the ambit of the Baptist Union, which places authority within a specific congregation. The JA was also accused of &quot;isolationism&quot;, epitomised by the JA practice of sometimes rebaptising new members who had already been baptised by other Baptist churches, implying that Christian baptism elsewhere may have been invalid. Consequently, in 1986 the Jesus Army was expelled from the Baptist Union, leaving it on the margins of the Baptist denomination. In 1982, the Jesus Fellowship had joined the Evangelical Alliance, one of whose membership requirements was that the church remain in close fellowship with other local evangelical churches. Earlier in 1986, the Evangelical Alliance had launched an inquiry into the beliefs and practices of the Jesus Fellowship Church and found that it no longer qualified for membership, citing much the same problems as did the Baptist Union later that year but at least as relevant in both cases was the fact that the rise of the JA came at a time when an international welter of anti-cult activity was under way. Allegations that the JA had too authoritarian a style of leadership and that members were under pressure to commit to lifelong celibacy, together with the corporal punishment of children (&#x27;rodding&#x27;) was practised, and that community members were required to hand over their material possessions, left them vulnerable to accusations of cultic practices. Their intense style and requirement of totalitarian commitment led to some allegations of abuse from disillusioned former members, and some hostility from more conventional churchgoers. A number of churches within the Evangelical Alliance threatened to leave if the Jesus Fellowship Church was allowed to remain a member. During the late 1980s and 1990s, the Jesus Fellowship improved its relationships with other churches, and broadened its membership so that community residents became a minority of the church. At the same time it re-examined its practices and loosened its style, with the result that when it reapplied for membership of the Evangelical Alliance in 1999 it received endorsements from both local and national church leaders and was accepted into membership later in the year. It never re-applied for membership of the Baptist Union, though a number of key Baptist ministers spoke at Jesus Fellowship events. Despite the entry of the Jesus Army into the charismatic mainstream, the church still attracted a range of views and anti-cult groups like the Cult Information Centre, FAIR and Reachout Trust still included the Jesus Army on their lists.
Writing in 1998, Stephen Hunt summed up the outlook of the wider charismatic Christian fraternity on the Jesus Fellowship at that time as follows: &quot;To some in the broader movement, the Jesus Fellowship will always be something of an enigma, tending towards exclusiveness and displaying a sectarianism incongruent with contemporary Pentecostalism. To others, the Jesus Fellowship will continue to epitomize the fullest expression of Christian and Pentecostal life.&quot;

<text>The Thermal Imaging Airborne Laser Designator (TIALD) was a targeting pod manufactured by Ferranti/GEC Marconi in the late 1980s and 1990s, and was the UK&#x27;s primary laser designator for its Paveway series of laser-guided bombs (LGBs).

==History==
The RAF&#x27;s first laser designators were Westinghouse Electric Corporation Pave Spike pods fitted to Blackburn Buccaneers which entered service in 1979. As these were limited to daylight use, the Ministry of Defence initiated studies for a new laser designator. The first operational use of LGBs by the UK&#x27;s armed forces were the RAF Harrier attacks on Argentine forces during the Falklands War. Laser designation for these attacks was carried out by a forward air controller using a ground designator.

In 1988 a Ferranti-led consortium was awarded a contract for development of its TIALD laser designator pod for use on the Panavia Tornado. The Ferranti pod incorporated thermal imagers from GEC-Marconi and automatic video tracking equipment from British Aerospace. The first use of the TIALD pod occurred during trials in May 1990 where a Buccaneer guided Paveway II bombs dropped from a Tornado.

The 1990 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait saw the TIALD pod rushed into service on Tornado GR1s in just 46 days. In the resultant Gulf War, two pre-production TIALD pods were used to guide 229 LGBs to their targets.

The TIALD pod was used extensively following the Gulf War including during the Iraqi no-fly zone patrols (1991-2003), the related Operation Desert Fox (1998), Operation Deliberate Force, Bosnia (1995), the Kosovo War (1999) and the 2003 Iraq Conflict.

In March 1995 the RAF received the first upgraded SEPECAT Jaguar aircraft capable of operating the TIALD pod. The upgrade required both hardware and software updates of the type. Integration on the Harrier GR7 commenced in 1996.

===Manufacturer===
Due to the corporate history of its parent companies, the manufacturer of the TIALD pod has been known as Ferranti, GEC-Ferranti/GEC-Marconi, BAE Systems Avionics, and Selex ES.

===Replacement===
Experience in Afghanistan lead to the realisation that TIALD was outdated, as described by an RAF Wing Commander: &quot;[It] was designed in the 1980s, to allow pilots to drop laser guided bombs on targets like bridges, big buildings and aircraft hangars... TIALD as an air interdiction targeting pod is very good and has done this reasonably well over the last decade, as was proved in Deliberate Force (1995), Allied Force (1999), and Operation Telic (2003). Now, however, we need a sensor that is geared more towards urban [close air support], where we need to defend particular targets that are very similar to others, like compounds within small towns or villages.&quot;

The TIALD pod was replaced by the LITENING targeting pod on Tornados. The Sniper pod replaced TIALD on Harriers following an urgent operational requirement in 2007.

<text>The Ohio House of Representatives is the lower house of the Ohio General Assembly, the state legislature of the U.S. state of Ohio; the other house of the bicameral legislature being the Ohio Senate.

The House of Representatives first met in Chillicothe on March 3, 1803, under the later superseded state constitution of that year. In 1816, the capital was moved to Columbus, where it is located today.

Members are limited to four successive two-year elected terms (terms are considered successive if they are separated by less than four years). Time served by appointment to fill out another representative&#x27;s uncompleted term does not count against the term limit. There are 99 members in the house, elected from single-member districts. Every even-numbered year, all the seats are up for re-election.

<doc id="764217" wikidata="Q380360" url="?curid=764217" title="Christophe Plantin">
<text>Christophe Plantin (; – 1 July 1589) was a French Renaissance humanist and book printer and publisher who resided and worked in Antwerp. He established in Antwerp one of the most prominent publishing houses of his time, the Plantin Press. It played a significant role in making Antwerp a leading centre of book publishing in Europe. The publishing house was continued by his successors until 1867. 

==Life==

Plantin was born in France, probably in Saint-Avertin, near the city of Tours, Touraine. He was not born to a wealthy family, and his mother died when Plantin was still quite young. As a youth he apprenticed as a bookbinder in Caen, Normandy, and also married there. In 1545, he and his wife, Joanna Rivière, set up shop in Paris, but after three years, they chose to relocate to the booming commercial centre of Antwerp, where Plantin became a free citizen and a member of the Guild of St Luke, the guild responsible for painters, sculptors, engravers and printers. The quality of his work as a bookbinder brought him into contact with nobility and wealth. By 1549, he headed one of the most well-respected publishing houses in Europe. He was responsible for printing a wide range of titles, from Cicero to religious hymnals. While delivering a prestigious commission, he was mistakenly attacked and received an arm wound that prevented him from labouring as a bookbinder and led him to concentrate on typography and printing. By 1555, he had his own print shop and was an accomplished printer. The first book he is known to have printed was &quot;La Institutione di una fanciulla nata nobilmente,&quot; by Giovanni Michele Bruto, with a French translation. This was soon followed by many other works in French and Latin, which in point of execution rivalled the best printing of his time. The art of engraving then flourished in the Habsburg Netherlands, and Dutch engravers illustrated many of his editions. Antwerp was a dangerous place for publishers around the time. In 1561, the Spanish governor ordered a raid on Plantin&#x27;s workshop for possibly housing heretical works and being a Protestant sympathizer. To avoid being jailed, Plantin quickly sold all of his works so that nothing would be found in his possession. As soon as things calmed down around him, he bought them all back.

In 1562, while Plantin was absent in Paris, his workmen printed a heretical pamphlet, which resulted in his presses and goods being seized and sold. It seems, however, that he eventually recovered much of the value that was taken from him. With the help of four Antwerp merchants, he was able to re-establish and expand his printing business significantly. Among these friends were two grand-nephews of Daniel Bomberg, who furnished him with the fine Hebrew typefaces of that renowned Venetian printer. The co-venture lasted only until 1567 but enabled Plantin to acquire a house in the &quot;Hoogstraat&quot; which he named &quot;De Gulden Passer&quot; (The Golden Compasses). This gesture mirrors the commercial success of publishing emblem books, which present collections of images paired with short, often cryptic, text explanations. It is also at this time that Plantin adopted a printer&#x27;s mark which would appear in various forms on the title pages of all Plantin Press books. The motto &quot;Labore et Constantia&quot; (&quot;By Labor and Constancy&quot;) surrounds the symbol of a pair of compasses held by a hand extending from a bank of clouds and inscribing a circle. The center point of the compasses indicates constancy, the moving point which renders the circle is the labor. Plantin holds the instrument in portraits of him, such as the one commissioned from the Flemish painter Peter Paul Rubens.

In November 1576, the Spaniards plundered and burned Antwerp, which essentially ended its supremacy as the commercial centre and richest city of Europe, and Plantin had to pay an exorbitant ransom to protect his printing works. He established a branch of his firm in Paris. In 1583, the states of Holland sought a typographer for the newly erected university at Leiden. Plantin moved there after he had left his much-reduced business in Antwerp to his sons-in-law Jan Moretus and Frans van Ravelingen (Raphelengius). Plantin left his Leiden office to Raphelengius and returned to Antwerp after it became more settled after its conquest by the prince of Parma in 1585. Plantin laboured in Antwerp until his death.

==Printing work==
Plantin was a prolific printer and prosperous entrepreneur, publishing more than 40 editions of emblem books. His most important work is considered to be the &quot;Biblia Regia&quot; (King&#x27;s Bible), also known as the Plantin Polyglot. Facing increasing pressure and turmoil in the Habsburg Netherlands, Plantin needed to find a patron that would not fall victim to claims of heresy or being a Protestant sympathizer. In spite of clerical opposition, Plantin was encouraged by King Philip II of Spain, who sent him the learned Benito Arias Montano to lead the editorship. The Polyglot Bible has parallel texts in Latin, Greek, Syriac, Aramaic, and Hebrew. This venture for Plantin was very expensive, requiring him to mortgage his own business to pay for the production of this bible, in the hope that there would be a worthwhile payoff in the end. It took thirteen presses and fifty-three men to complete the task. Characters in each of the printed languages were required, with French type designer Claude Garamond providing the steel punches. With Montano&#x27;s zealous help, the work was finished in four years (1568 - 1572). There were eight volumes in folio format, meaning only two pages could be printed at one time. This work earned Plantin little profit, but resulted in Philip&#x27;s granting him the privilege of printing all Roman Catholic liturgical books (missals, breviaries, etc.) for the states ruled by Philip, the title &quot;Architypographus Regii,&quot; which he dutifully added to the title pages of Plantin Press books, and the unwanted duty of &quot;prototypo-graphus regius,&quot; obligating him to inspect and verify the skill and dogmatic adherence of other printers. 

Besides the Plantin Polyglot, Plantin published many other works of note, such as the &quot;Dictionarium Tetraglotton&quot; of 1562, which was a dictionary in Greek, Latin, French and Flemish, editions of St. Augustine and St. Jerome, the botanical works of Dodonaeus, Clusius and Lobelius, and the description of the Habsburg Netherlands by Guicciardini. His editions of the Bible in Hebrew, Latin and Dutch, his &quot;Corpus juris,&quot; Latin and Greek classics, and many other works are renowned for their beautiful execution and accuracy. A skillful businessman, by 1575 his printing firm reckoned more than 20 presses and 73 workmen, plus various specialists who did job-work out of their homes. The vast collection of handwritten ledgers and letters of the Officina Plantiniana, as it was known, can be examined online following digitization by the Museum Plantin-Moretus and hosting by World Digital Library.

Though outwardly a faithful member of the Catholic Church, he appears to have used his resources to support several sects of heretics, sometimes known as the Family of Love or Familists. It is now proven that many of their books, published without naming the printer, came from Plantin Press.

After Plantin&#x27;s death, his firm was taken over by his son-in-law, Jan Moretus who ran his shop in Antwerp, and Francis van Ravelinghen who took over his shop in Leiden. Towards the end of the 17th century, the business began to decline. Plantin&#x27;s works however, were meticulously preserved. Today, the building that housed the firm is called the Plantin-Moretus Museum. Moretus and his descendants continued to print many works of note &quot;in officina Plantiniana&quot;, but the firm began to decline in the second half of the 17th century. It remained, however, in the possession of the Moretus family, which left everything in the office untouched, and when the city of Antwerp acquired (for 1.2 million francs) the old buildings with all their contents, the authorities created, with little trouble, the Musee Plantin, which opened on 19 August 1877.

In 1968, the Christophe Plantin Prize was created in his memory, given to a Belgian civilian who resides abroad, who has made significant contributions to cultural, artistic or scientific activities.

==Family tree==
The Plantin-Moretus family tree, including the heads of &quot;Officiana Plantiniana&quot;, later known as Plantin Press.

Christophe Plantin (1520–1589) married Joanna Riviere; they had five daughters and a son. Christophe&#x27;s daughters were described as learned in reading and writing, especially Greek and Latin. One teenage daughter is said to have helped proofread the &quot;Plantin Polygot&quot;.

*Margaretha Plantin married Franciscus Raphelengius, who led the Leiden branch of the house. They stayed printers in Leiden for two more generations of Van Ravelinge, until 1619. A great-granddaughter of the last Van Ravelinge printer married in 1685 Jordaen Luchtmans, founder of what would become later the still existing Brill Publishers.
*Magdalen Plantin, who was reported to have aided her father in proofreading the &quot;Biblia Regia&quot; in five different languages. It is important to note that “it was said that she could correct the script perfectly accurately, but without understanding a word of it.” Magdalen would later marry her father&#x27;s Paris agent.
*Martina Plantin, who with her sister, Catherine, helped run the family&#x27;s silk shop by the age of seventeen. Martina and Catherine were efficient and well known in their silk handlings. Later, Martina married Jan Moretus (Jan or Joannes Moerentorf) (1543–1610) in 1570. They had 10 children. After her husband&#x27;s death, Martina was the head of the firm until her sons took over running the business.
**Balthasar I Moretus (1574–1641)
**Jan II Moretus (1576–1618) married Maria De Sweert; they had 6 children
***Balthasar II Moretus (1615–1674) married Anna Goos; they had 12 children
****Balthazar III Moretus (1646–1696) married Anna Maria de Neuf; they had 9 children
*****Balthazar IV Moretus (1679–1730) married Isabella Jacoba De Mont (or De Brialmont); they had 8 children
*****Joannes Jacobus Moretus (1690–1757) married Theresia Mechtildis Schilder; they had 9 children
******Franciscus Joannes Moretus (1717–1768) married Maria Theresia Borrekens, who led the office after Franciscus&#x27; death until her death in 1797. They had 13 children
*******Jacobus Paulus Josephus Moretus (1756–1808)
*******Ludovicus Franciscus Xaverius Moretus (1758–1820)
*******Josephus Hyacinthus Moretus (1762–1810) married Maria Henrica Coleta Wellens; they had 8 children
********Albertus Franciscus Hyacinthus Fredericus Moretus (1795–1865)
********Eduardus Josephus Hyacinthus Moretus (1804–1880). He sold the office to the city of Antwerp in 1876, after having printed the last book in 1866.
*Magdalena Plantin married Gilles Beys, who then ran the French branch of the Plantin office. This continued for one more generation under their son, Christophe Beys.

<text>The Youngs River is a tributary of the Columbia River, approximately long, in northwest Oregon in the United States. It drains part of the Northern Oregon Coast Range in the extreme northwest corner of state, entering the Columbia via Youngs Bay just approximately from its mouth.

It rises in a remote section of the mountains of central Clatsop County, north of Saddle Mountain State Natural Area. It flows generally northwest, passing over Youngs River Falls. The falls were encountered in 1806 by a hunting party of the Lewis and Clark Expedition from nearby Fort Clatsop and documented in William Clark&#x27;s journals. It broadens in a large estuary and enters the south end of Youngs Bay on the Columbia at Astoria. It receives the Klaskanine River from the east approximately south of Astoria. It receives the Wallooskee River from the east approximately south of Astoria.

Named tributaries of Youngs River from source to mouth are Fall Creek and South Fork Youngs River, then Fox, Osgood, Rock, Bayney, Wawa, and Moosmoos creeks followed by the Klaskanine River. Below that come Cooperage, Battle Creek, Tucker, Casey, Binder, and Cook sloughs followed by the Wallooskee River. Further downstream are Crosel, Brown, and Craig creeks followed by Knowland Slough and the Lewis and Clark River.

About from the mouth of the river are Youngs River Falls, a tall waterfall.

<doc id="764236" wikidata="Q4744768" url="?curid=764236" title="American Public Transportation Association">
<text>The American Public Transportation Association (APTA) is a nonprofit group of approximately 1,500 public and private sector member organizations that promotes and advocates for the interests of the public transportation industry in the United States.

APTA represents all modes of public transportation, including bus, paratransit, light rail, commuter rail, subways, waterborne services, and intercity and high-speed passenger rail. More than 90 percent of the people using public transportation in the United States ride on APTA member systems.

APTA&#x27;s membership consists of more than 320 public transit agencies, including New York MTA, the nation&#x27;s largest transit system, as well as transportation-related businesses and organizations. Members are engaged in every aspect of the industry – from planning, designing, financing, constructing and operating transit systems to the research, development, manufacturing and maintenance of vehicles, equipment and transit-related products and services. Additionally, academic institutions, transportation network companies, transit associations and state departments of transportation are APTA members.

== Leadership and governance ==
Paul Skoutelas was elected by the APTA Board of Directors in November 2017 and became president and chief executive officer in January 2018. He has spent more than 40 years in public and private sector positions related to public transportation. He was CEO of public transit systems in Pittsburgh and Orlando and as senior vice president for WSP USA, one of the world&#x27;s largest architectural and engineering firms. Skoutelas has also held leadership positions on numerous boards and committees for transportation organizations, including on APTA&#x27;s Board of Directors and Executive Committee, the Transportation Research Board, National Transit Institute, Pennsylvania Transportation Institute, and the Transit Cooperative Research Program.

APTA&#x27;s Board of Directors is the 112-member governing body of the association. The individuals that preside on the APTA Board of Directors are elected and appointed by APTA members to oversee the management of the association. Elections are held each fall during APTA&#x27;s annual business meeting, and nominations typically open in June of each year.

APTA&#x27;s Executive Committee is composed of 25 individuals who are elected by APTA members to make recommendations to the Board of Directors and to make decisions on behalf of the Board on specific matters.

== Activities ==

* Advocating for increased federal funding as well as on policy, legislative and regulatory issues is one of APTA&#x27;s most important functions. The association supports investment in public transportation infrastructure that models smart growth and creates jobs, produces safe, efficient transportation, reduces congestion and pollution, connects people to jobs, and provides access to opportunities such as health care, education, social services and commerce. In 2015, APTA played a key role in the passage of the FAST Act, which provided predictable and reliable multi-year funding for public transportation and passenger rail programs over five years (2016-2020). The association also maintains a 220,000-member grassroots advocacy effort called &quot;Voices for Public Transit.&quot;
* Since 1943, APTA has been publishing its annual Public Transportation Fact Book (formerly known as the Transit Fact Book), a compendium of industry facts and data.
* APTA frequently works in partnership with The National Alliance for Public Transportation Advocates (NAPTA), Center for Transportation Excellence (CFTE), Transit Cooperative Research Program (TCRP) and Transportation Research Board (TRB), all of which share a common goal of developing practical solutions to mobility challenges.
* The association also maintains relationships and plans study missions with international public transportation groups, including the Canadian Urban Transit Association, UITP (&quot;Union Internationale des Transports Publics&quot; or International Association of Public Transport), and GIE Objectif Transport Public.
* APTA&#x27;s Policy Development and Research Program serves as the association&#x27;s think tank, conducting original research through polling, surveys and in-depth studies and publishing reports on priorities issues for the industry.
* APTA plans and organizes more than 14 conferences, workshops and seminars every year, the largest of which is the Annual Meeting. Every three years, the association holds an international exposition called APTA EXPO, the world&#x27;s largest trade show for the public transportation industry. Annual events include the International Bus Roadeo and Conference, International Rail Rodeo and Conference, Legislative Conference, and safety and security awards in excellence. In 2018, the association held its first &quot;The Future of Mobility Summit&quot; to explore how changes in technology, business models and customer preferences are transforming the public transportation sector and creating opportunities for a variety of integrated mobility services.
* Professional and workforce development are key APTA activities. Under the brand APTA-U, the association offers classroom and online education and training programs for senior executives, emerging leaders and front-line managers. APTA-U is exploring credentialing and certifications to help prepare a high-skilled workforce.
* APTA conducts peer reviews and safety audits to assist its members with critical challenges. The association also works with the Federal Transit Administration (FTA), Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) and Transportation Safety Board (TSB) to develop industry standards on a range of issues.
* In addition to its Fact Book and research reports, APTA publishes a biweekly print and digital news magazine, called &quot;Passenger Transport&quot; as well as a biweekly electronic version called &quot;Passenger Transport Express&quot;.

== History ==
The organization that would eventually become known as APTA was first established as the American Street Railway Association on December 12, 1882, in Boston, Massachusetts. The initial meetings focused on the price of oats for the horses that pulled transit vehicles, but that focus evolved as more transit companies built electric systems.

In 1905, the group met in New York and reorganized as the American Street and Interurban Railway Transportation and Traffic Association. To encompass even more modes of electric transit, the group changed its name to the American Electric Railway Transportation and Traffic Association in 1910. By 1932, many of the transit systems relied on motor coaches and trolleys in addition to electric streetcars, so the organization became known as the American Transit Association (ATA).

In 1966, ATA relocated from New York City to Washington, DC because of increasing reliance on federal funding, especially with the passage of the Urban Mass Transportation Act in 1964 and the creation of the Urban Mass Transportation Administration (now the Federal Transit Administration). In the 1970s, the organization developed a closer working relationship with the federal government as more and more transit systems became publicly financed. The American Public Transit Association (APTA) was created in 1974 when the American Transit Association and the Institute for Rapid Transit (IRT) merged. The IRT dated back to 1929 and formally organized on June 7, 1961. In 1976, the Transit Development Corporation also merged with APTA.

In January 2000. the name of the organization was changed to the American Public Transportation Association. Despite the various name changes, the mission of the organization has remained generally the same.

<text>Turok () is a fictional character who first appeared in American comic books published by Western Publishing through licensee Dell Comics. He first appeared in &quot;Four Color Comics&quot; #596 (October/November 1954). After a second &quot;Four Color&quot; appearance (#656, October 1955), the character graduated to his own title – Turok, Son of Stone (#3, March–May 1956) – published by both Dell and then Gold Key Comics from 1956 to 1982. Subsequently, he appeared in titles published by Valiant Comics, Dark Horse Comics and Dynamite Comics.

The character also inspired a popular video game series, starting with &quot;&quot;, published by Acclaim Entertainment in 1997. Several sequels would be released in the following years for various gaming consoles.

==Publishing history==
===Western Publishing===
The original comic, titled &quot;Turok, Son of Stone&quot;, was illustrated by Rex Maxon. The writer-creator credit for the characters of Turok and Andar is disputed, with historians citing Matthew H. Murphy, Gaylord Du Bois, and Paul S. Newman as the feature&#x27;s earliest writers.

The Western Publishing version of Turok was a Pre-Columbian era Native American (identified as Mandan in the first issue, on page 21 and 32 of &quot;Dell Four Color&quot; #596) who, along with his brother, Andar, finds himself lost in an isolated valley populated by dinosaurs. Turok refers to many of the prehistoric animals as &quot;honkers&quot; or by their most obvious characteristics (tyrannosaurus are called &quot;runners&quot;, pterosaurs are called &quot;flyers&quot;, velociraptors are &quot;screamers&quot;, plesiosaurs are &quot;sea demons&quot;, &quot;Triceratops&quot; are &quot;rammers&quot;, etc.). The Du Bois stories involve Turok and Andar seeking a way out of the valley. Du Bois was influenced by his visits to Carlsbad Caverns in New Mexico, and developed the &quot;Lost Valley&quot; from his visits to the area.

After two appearances in &quot;Four Color&quot; #596 and #656, the title ran 27 issues (#3–29) published by Dell Comics (1956–1962); then issues #30–125 (1962–1980) from Gold Key Comics; and finally issues #126–130 (1981–82) under Western&#x27;s Whitman Comics imprint.

The first Turok one-shot (&quot;Four Color&quot; #596) was originally written by Du Bois as a &quot;Young Hawk&quot; story. &quot;Young Hawk&quot; was an earlier Native American comic book feature Du Bois created, which appeared in Dell&#x27;s &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot; comic book series.

Although the artists had long since established Turok as an adult, Du Bois&#x27;s last scripts for the series (&quot;Turok&quot; #8) still introduced stories by describing Turok and Andar as &quot;youths&quot;, more befitting Young Hawk than Turok (though Andar was depicted as a youth). The first story in that issue begins as &quot;Turok and Andar, Indian youths, have found their way into a strange network of deep canyons in the Carlsbad area, where ancient forms of life still exist ... They have found no way to get out&quot;. The second story begins where &quot;trapped in a deep canyon in the Carlsbad area of New Mexico, Turok and Andar, two Indian youths, have met ancient forms of life which have disappeared from all other parts of the world&quot;.

In Du Bois&#x27; last Turok story (issue #8, &quot;Turok Seeks the Trail to Freedom&quot;, in which Turok encounters a herd of horses, which he calls &quot;slim-legged creatures&quot;, having no word for them, as the horse had not yet been reintroduced to the Americas by the Spanish), Turok scales the cliffs, and escapes the Lost Valley. However, he returns for Andar, who was left behind after being injured. Soon, an avalanche permanently seals the way out and the series begins anew. Paul S. Newman began writing the Turok stories afterward.

===Valiant Comics===

In 1992, Valiant Comics introduced a revamped Turok, debuting him in &quot;&quot; #12. With this version, the concept and setting were altered. Turok and Andar were now 18th-century Native Americans. The isolated valley became &quot;the Lost Lands&quot; – a land where demons, dinosaurs and aliens flourish and where &quot;time has no meaning&quot;. A cosmic anomaly causes time in the Lost Lands to move in a self-contained loop (which means that while millions of years pass outside of it, inside it, time barely moves at all). &quot;Unity&quot;, a line-wide Valiant Comics crossover storyline, altered the concept even further. The crossover&#x27;s main villain, a psychotic superpowered being known as Mothergod, uses the Lost Lands as her base of operations. She outfits dinosaurs with intelligence-boosting implants, turning them into &quot;bionisaurs&quot;.

In the aftermath of the final battle between Mothergod and the Valiant Universe heroes, the Lost Lands begin to disappear. Turok and Andar are tossed into a post-apocalyptic future Earth, and a group of bionisaurs make it to Earth along with them. Following this, they become ruthless hunters trying to contend with the demons and aliens that exist in the future world, as well as various Lovecraftian abominations and high-tech future warriors. Mothergod seizes power in this future and begins to rebuild her empire and attempts to hunt down and kill Turok and Andar.

A new volume of Turok&#x27;s own comic, &quot;Turok: Dinosaur Hunter&quot;, was launched in 1993. Valiant published 53 issues before Acclaim purchased the company, including &quot;Turok: Dinosaur Hunter&quot; #0–47, &quot;Original Turok: Son of Stone&quot; #1–2, &quot;Turok: Dinosaur Hunter Yearbook&quot; in 1994, and the two-issue miniseries &quot;Turok the Hunted&quot; in 1996. &quot;Turok: Dinosaur Hunter&quot; #1 was the sixth best-selling comic of the month of June, surpassed only by the first five installments of &quot;Reign of the Supermen!&quot;.

===Acclaim Comics===

A new Turok series, titled simply &quot;Turok&quot;, was published by Acclaim Comics in 1997 and 1998. In the revamped Acclaim Comics universe, Turok is not the character&#x27;s name, but rather a title meaning &quot;Son of Stone&quot;. The Turok must protect the barriers between this dimension and the others—the axis of all worlds being the Lost Lands, a place where creatures from across time and space had been dragged and where &quot;time has no meaning&quot;. Joshua Fireseed, the latest Turok, must travel between alternate universes stopping those who would try to conquer the Lost Lands, and thus all of the multiverse with it.

===Dark Horse Comics===
A new Turok series, again titled &quot;Turok: Son of Stone&quot;, was launched by Dark Horse Comics, under license by Classic Media in 2010. The title was written by former Valiant Comics writer Jim Shooter and illustrated by Eduardo Francisco. This was one of a series of titles released by Dark Horse that year based on classic Gold Key Comics properties. The entire line, including Turok, was short-lived, with Turok lasting only four issues.

===Dynamite Comics===
Dynamite Entertainment launched a new Turok comic series, titled &quot;Turok: Dinosaur Hunter&quot;, as well as books based on other Gold Key Comics properties, as part of a licensing deal with DreamWorks Classics. The creative team on the title was Greg Pak and Mirko Colak. This comics series was released in 2014. The series ended after 12 issues.

In 2016, Turok appeared in a five-issue miniseries called &quot;Gold Key: Alliance&quot;. Written by Phil Hester and illustrated by Brent Peeples, the book starred heroes from multiple Gold Key Comics titles.

Dynamite published a second Turok comic series titled &quot;Turok&quot;, written by Chuck Wendig and illustrated by Álvaro Sarraseca, in 2017. It also featured backup stories starring fellow Gold Key character Doctor Spektor.

<text>Caymanians are the status holders or born citizens of the Cayman Islands. As a British Overseas Territory, citizens of the Cayman Islands will hold British Overseas Territories Citizenship. There is no record of a native people to the Cayman Islands, such as groups like the Arawak or Carib people who were native to most of the Caribbean; therefore most Caymanians today are of mixed European and African descent, coming from early British settlers and enslaved people from Africa.

Since 21 May 2002, citizens of all the British Overseas Territories became British citizens under a new UK law, granting the people of every BOT, including the Cayman Islands, the right to live, study and work in the UK as a full citizen, as well as receive the same benefits given to British citizens in the UK.

==Ethnicities==


Most Caymanians are of mixed European and African ancestry. Although slavery occurred in the Cayman Islands, it was not as common in comparison to the rest of the Caribbean, therefore, when it was abolished, European and African residents seemed to integrate faster than other nations, resulting in a more mixed race population. There are also prominent black and white populations, with a sizable South Asian population, mainly made up of immigrants from India and the Philippines.

==Languages==


English is the official language of the Cayman Islands. A large number of the population also converse in Spanish, as there are many mixed Caymanian families of Latin American origin. Tagalog is also spoken by Filipino-Caymanians and Filipino immigrants.

==Religion==

Most Caymanians identify as Christians (66.9%), with 25% belonging to no religion. There are also small numbers of Hindus (1.7%), Muslims (0.4%), Rastafarians (0.3%) and those of Jewish faith (0.2%). 5.5% have not specified.

==Diaspora==
The Caymanian diaspora population is roughly around 4,000, although the true number is not securely documented. Most Caymanians overseas live in the United Kingdom, which would be due to the convenience of being British Overseas Territories citizens; along with many residing in the United States and Canada. It is common for many young Caymanians to travel to these countries for further education. A small number also reside in Jamaica. With its close proximity to the islands, many Caymanian families are of Jamaican origin or have Jamaican family members.

<text>Youngs River Falls is a tall waterfall on the Youngs River in central Clatsop County, northwestern Oregon, United States. They are located about south of Astoria.

== History==
The first Americans to report on the falls were members of a hunting party from the Lewis and Clark Expedition, in March 1806.

== In the media ==
The falls have appeared in movies such as &quot;Free Willy 2: The Adventure Home&quot;, &quot;Benji the Hunted&quot; and &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III&quot;.

In July 2014, Tod Gary Wagoner, of Williamsburg, Colorado, died after jumping from the falls, the &quot;first [such] fatality at the falls in a while.&quot; In April 2016, Joseph T. Nestor, a 34-year-old Astoria man, fell and died from injuries at the falls.

<doc id="764257" wikidata="Q3607176" url="?curid=764257" title="Air Force Research Laboratory">
<text>The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) is a scientific research and development detachment of the United States Air Force Materiel Command dedicated to leading the discovery, development, and integration of direct-energy based aerospace warfighting technologies, planning and executing the Air Force science and technology program, and providing warfighting capabilities to United States air, space, and cyberspace forces. It controls the entire Air Force science and technology research budget which was $2.4 billion in 2006.

The Laboratory was formed at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base near Dayton, Ohio, on 31 October 1997 as a consolidation of four Air Force laboratory facilities (Wright, Phillips, Rome, and Armstrong) and the Air Force Office of Scientific Research under a unified command. The Laboratory is composed of eight technical directorates, one wing, and the Office of Scientific Research. Each technical directorate emphasizes a particular area of research within the AFRL mission which it specializes in performing experiments in conjunction with universities and contractors.

Since the Laboratory&#x27;s formation in 1997, it has conducted numerous experiments and technical demonstrations in conjunction with NASA, Department of Energy, National Laboratories, DARPA, and other research organizations within the Department of Defense. Notable projects include the X-37, X-40, X-53, HTV-3X, YAL-1A, Advanced Tactical Laser, and the Tactical Satellite Program.

In 2009, it was reported that the Laboratory may face problems in the future as 40 percent of its workers are slated to retire over the next two decades, and since 1980, the United States has not produced enough science and engineering degrees to keep up with demand.

==History==
In 1945, the Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratories were established. These laboratories were active from 1945 to 2011, following consolidation to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base and Kirtland Air Force Base under the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure Commission. The labs were founded as the Air Force Cambridge Research Center (AFCRC), a Cold War systems development organization which developed telephone modem communications for a Digital Radar Relay in 1949. Created by General Henry H. Arnold in 1945, AFCRC participated in Project Space Track and Semi-Automatic Ground Environment development.

The path to a consolidated Air Force Research Laboratory began with the passage of the Goldwater–Nichols Act which was designed to streamline the use of resources by the Department of Defense. In addition to this Act, the end of the Cold War began a period of budgetary and personnel reductions within the armed forces in preparation for a &quot;stand-down&quot; transition out of readiness for a global war with the Soviet Union. Prior to 1990, the Air Force laboratory system spread research out into 13 different laboratories and the Rome Air Development Center which each reported up two separate chains of command: a product center for personnel, and the Air Force Systems Command Director of Science &amp; Technology for budgetary purposes. Bowing to the constraints of a reduced budget and personnel, the Air Force merged the existing research laboratories into four &quot;superlabs&quot; in December 1990. During this same time period, the Air Force Systems Command and Air Force Logistics Command merged to form Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC) in July 1992.

While the initial consolidation of Air Force laboratories reduced overhead and budgetary pressure, another push towards a unified laboratory structure came in the form of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1996, Section 277. This section instructed the Department of Defense to produce a five-year plan for consolidation and restructuring of all defense laboratories. The currently existing laboratory structure was created in October 1997 through the consolidation of Phillips Laboratory headquartered in Albuquerque, New Mexico, Wright Laboratory in Dayton, Ohio, Rome Laboratory (formerly Rome Air Development Center) in Rome, New York, and Armstrong Laboratory in San Antonio, Texas and the Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR). The single laboratory concept was developed and championed by Maj Gen Richard Paul, who was Director of Science &amp; Technology for AFMC and Gen Henry Viccellio Jr, and then became the first Commander of AFRL.

With the merger of the laboratories into a single entity, the history offices at each site ceased to maintain independent histories and all history functions were transferred to a central History Office located at AFRL HQ at Wright-Patterson AFB. In homage to the predecessor laboratories, the new organization named four of the research sites after the laboratories and assured that each laboratory&#x27;s history would be preserved as inactivated units.

In 2023, the National Advanced Air Mobility Center of Excellence was completed to help the Laboratory, private companies, and local academics collaborate on the research of eVTOL and UAS aircraft.

==Organization==
The laboratory is divided into eight Technical Directorates, one wing, and the Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR) based on different areas of research. AFOSR is primarily a funding body for external research while the other directorates perform research in-house or under contract to external entities.

A directorate is roughly equivalent to a military wing. Each directorate is composed of a number of divisions and typically has at least three support divisions in addition to its research divisions. The Operations and Integration Division provides the directorate with well-conceived and executed business computing, human resource management, and business development services while the Financial Management Division manages the financial resources and the Procurement Division provides an in-house contracting capability. The support divisions at any given location frequently work together to minimize overhead at any given research site. Each division is then further broken down into branches, roughly equivalent to a military squadron.

Superimposed on the overall AFRL structure are the eight detachments. Each detachment is composed of the AFRL military personnel at any given geographical location. For example, the personnel at Wright-Patterson AFB are all part of Detachment 1. Each detachment will typically also have a unit commander separate from the directorate and division structure.

===Headquarters AFRL===
Located at Wright-Patterson AFB, OH, AFRL Headquarters houses the commanders and staff for the laboratories (q.v.). Its primary responsibilities are leadership, policy and guidance; unifying the common objectives of the eight Technical Directorates, the 711th wing, and AFOSR. The staff functions include Public Relations, Strategic Communication, Business Outreach, Planning, Programming, Budgeting and Execution (PPBE), Technology Transition, Transformation, Contracting and a High-Performance Computing Center. HQ also includes the Center for Rapid Innovation, which handles urgent operational requests from commanders of Air Force Space Command, Air Force Global Strike Command, Air Mobility Command, and others.

===Air Force Office of Scientific Research===
The Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR), located in Arlington, Virginia, invests in basic research efforts for the Air Force by funding investigation in relevant scientific areas. This work is performed in cooperation with private industry, academia, and other organizations in the Department of Defense and AFRL Directorates.

AFOSR&#x27;s research is organized into four scientific directorates: the Engineering and Complex Systems Directorate; the Information and Networks Directorate; the Physical Sciences Directorate; and the Chemistry and Biological Sciences Directorate. Each directorate funds research activities that it believes will enable the technological superiority of the Air Force.

AFOSR also maintains three foreign technology offices located in London, UK (the European Office of Aerospace Research &amp; Development), Tokyo, Japan, and Santiago, Chile. These overseas offices coordinate with the international scientific and engineering community to allow for better collaboration between the community and Air Force personnel.

AFOSR is one of the sponsors of the University Nanosatellite Program.

===Air Vehicles Directorate===
The Air Vehicles Directorate, located at Wright-Patterson AFB, has the mission of developing technologies that support cost-effective and survivable aerospace vehicles capable of accurate and quick delivery of a variety of future weapons or cargo anywhere. The current director is Col Michael Hatfield.

The Directorate has previously collaborated with NASA in the X-24 project to research concepts associated with lifting body type aircraft. The X-24 was one of a series of experimental aircraft, including the M2-F1, M2-F2, HL-10, and HL-20, by NASA and Air Force programs to develop the lifting body concept into maturity. The tests conducted during these programs led to the choice of an unpowered landing for the Space Shuttle program.
In 2002, the Directorate initiated the X-53 Active Aeroelastic Wing program in cooperation with NASA&#x27;s Dryden Flight Research Center and Boeing Phantom Works to research ways to make more efficient use of the wing surface during high-speed maneuvers.

The Directorate is also a collaborator with DARPA, the U.S. Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center, Sandia National Laboratories and AFRL&#x27;s Space Vehicles Directorate on the FALCON program, which includes the HTV-3X Blackswift hypersonic flight demonstration vehicle. The Air Vehicles Directorate also collaborated with NASA and Boeing on the initial work for the X-37B Orbital Test Vehicle and the 80% scaled version, X-40A Space Maneuver Vehicle, prior to the classification of the program and its transfer from NASA to DARPA in late 2004. The X-37 program is now managed by the Air Force Rapid Capabilities Office.

Another recent project managed by the Air Vehicles Directorate is the Advanced Composite Cargo Aircraft program begun in 2007. This is an experimental, composite aircraft program with a goal of demonstrating the feasibility of the development of a cargo airframe constructed primary of light-weight composite materials. AFRL intends to gain X-plane designation for the program once flight tests begin.

The VTHL Reusable Booster System program was initiated by the USAF in 2010.

In 2012, the Air Vehicles Directorate merged with the Propulsion Directorate to become Aerospace Systems Directorate.

===Directed Energy Directorate===
In addition to serving as the Air Force&#x27;s Center of Excellence for high power microwave technology, the Directed Energy Directorate is also the Department of Defense&#x27;s Center of Expertise for laser development of all types. The current director is Susan Thornton.

The Starfire Optical Range at Kirtland AFB, North Oscura Peak on White Sands Missile Range, and the Air Force Maui Optical and Supercomputing observatory (AMOS) are also operated by divisions of the Directed Energy Directorate in addition to their facilities at the Directorate&#x27;s headquarters at Kirtland AFB. The Starfire Optical Range is used to research various topics of advanced tracking using lasers as well as studies of atmospheric physics which examines atmospheric effects which can distort laser beams. North Oscura Peak is used to research the various technologies necessary to facilitate successful tracking and destruction of an incoming missile via a laser and is used frequently for laser-based missile defense tests. AMOS provides space observation capabilities and computational resources to AFRL, the Department of Defense and other agencies of the US Government.

Directed Energy projects typically fall into two categories: laser and microwave. Laser projects range from completely non-lethal targeting lasers to dazzlers, such as the Saber 203 used by US forces during the Somali Civil War and the more recent PHaSR dazzler, to powerful missile defense lasers such as the chemical oxygen iodine laser (COIL) used in the YAL-1A project now led by the Missile Defense Agency. A continuation of the Airborne Laser experiment is also being conducted in the form of the Advanced Tactical Laser, which is a Special Forces demonstrator project to mount a COIL system in a tactical AC-130 gunship. Microwave technologies are being advanced for use against both electronics and personnel. One example of an anti-personnel microwave project is the &quot;less-than-lethal&quot; Active Denial System, which uses high-powered microwaves to penetrate less than a millimeter into the target&#x27;s skin, where the nerve endings are located.

Going back as far as 1995, there were arguments that laser dazzlers could potentially cause permanent blindness in targets, and these same concerns were revived with the announcement of the PHaSR project, which is claimed to be a non-blinding laser weapon. Due to concerns that even low-powered lasers could cause blindness, the Human Rights Watch proposed that all tactical laser weapons should be scrapped and research stopped by all interested governments. The Active Denial System has also been the target of Amnesty International as well as, less directly, a United Nations special rapporteur as being a potential weapon of torture.

===711th Human Performance Wing===
In March 2008, AFRL&#x27;s Human Effectiveness Directorate located at Wright-Patterson AFB was merged with the Air Force School of Aerospace Medicine and the Human Performance Integration Directorate from the 311th Human Systems Wing both located at Brooks City-Base, Texas to form the 711th Human Performance Wing. In its vision statement, the wing includes the goals of improving aerospace medicine, science and technology, and human systems integration. The current Commander of the 711th is Brig. Gen. Timothy Jex.

One practical application of its work is ensuring and advancing the safety of ejection systems for pilots. With the increasing number of females in the Air Force ranks, anthropometry is of greater import now than ever, and 711th&#x27;s WB4 &#x27;whole-body scanner&#x27; enables swift and accurate acquisition of anthropometric data which may be used to design pilot equipment with a better fit for comfort and safety.

===Information Directorate===
The mission of the Information Directorate, located at the Rome Research Site on the Griffiss Business and Technology Park in Rome, New York, is to lead the discovery, development, and integration of affordable warfighting information technologies for air, space, and cyberspace forces. The current director of the Information Directorate is Colonel Timothy J. Lawrence.

The Information Directorate has contributed research to a number of technologies which have been deployed in the field. These projects include collaboration with other agencies in the development of ARPANET, the predecessor of the Internet, as well as technologies used in the Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System which is a key aspect of theater command and control for combat commanders. The Directorate also collaborated with the Department of Justice performing research on voice stress analysis technologies.

===Materials and Manufacturing Directorate===
The Materials and Manufacturing Directorate, located at Wright-Patterson AFB and Tyndall AFB, develops materials, processes, and advanced manufacturing technologies for aerospace systems and their components to improve Air Force capabilities in these areas. The current director is Mr. Darrell K. Phillipson.

In 2003, the Directorate announced a new manufacturing method for use producing the turbine exhaust casing for the F119 jet engine used on the F-22 Raptor stealth fighter which will result in an estimated savings of 35% of the cost while also improving the durability. In collaboration with Lockheed Martin Aeronautics, the Directorate helped develop a new laser-based ultrasonic scanner to inspect composite parts also for use on the F-22. The Directorate also developed an advanced thermoplastic composite material for use in the landing gear doors on the F-22. In 2008, the Air Force announced that the Directorate had developed a method of using fabric made of fiber optic material in a friend or foe identification system.

===Munitions Directorate===
The mission of the Munitions Directorate, located at Eglin AFB, Florida, is to &quot;develop, demonstrate and transition science and technology for air-launched munitions for defeating ground fixed, mobile/relocatable, air and space targets to assure pre-eminence of U.S. air and space forces.&quot; The current director of the Munitions Directorate is Colonel Woodrow &quot;Tony&quot; Meeks.

Notable projects which have been made public include the GBU-28 &quot;bunker-buster&quot; bomb which debuted during the 1991 Persian Gulf War in Iraq and took only 17 days from concept to first deployment. The Directorate also developed the GBU-43/B Massive Ordnance Air Blast bomb which was deployed during the 2003 invasion of Iraq for Operation Iraqi Freedom and was the largest non-nuclear air-delivered munitions at that time.

===Propulsion Directorate===

The mission of the Propulsion Directorate, located at Wright-Patterson AFB and Edwards Air Force Base, is &quot;to create and transition propulsion and power technology for military dominance of air and space.&quot; The current director of the Propulsion Directorate is Douglas L. Bowers.

Research areas range from experimental rocket propulsion to developing the first ever lithium-ion main aircraft battery for use in the B-2 stealth bomber. At Edwards AFB, the Directorate&#x27;s test area is located east of Rogers Lake.

The Propulsion Directorate was formed through the merger of the aerospace propulsion section at Wright Laboratory and the space propulsion section at Phillips Laboratory. Each section, both before and after the merger, has played a significant role in past and present propulsion systems. Prior to the development of Project Apollo by NASA, the Air Force worked on the development and testing of the F-1 rocket engine used to power the Saturn V rocket. The facilities for testing rockets are frequently used for testing new rocket engines including the RS-68 rocket engine developed for use on the Delta IV launch vehicle. The space propulsion area also develops technologies for use in satellites on-orbit to alter their orbits. An AFRL-developed experimental Electric Propulsion Space Experiment (ESEX) arcjet was flown on the ARGOS satellite in 1999 as part of the Air Force Space Test Program.

The Directorate currently manages the X-51A program, which is developing a scramjet demonstration vehicle. The X-51 program is working to develop a flight demonstrator for a hypersonic cruise missile which could reach anywhere on the globe in an hour. In January 2008, the Directorate used a modified Scaled Composites Long-EZ aircraft to demonstrate that a pulse detonation engine could successfully power flight. That aircraft has now been transferred to the National Museum of the U.S. Air Force at Wright-Patterson AFB for display.

===Sensors Directorate===
The mission of the Sensors Directorate, located at Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio, is to provide a full range of air and space sensors, networked to the warfighter, providing a complete and timely picture of the battlespace enabling precision targeting of the enemy and protection friendly air and space assets and its core technology areas include: radar, active and passive electro-optical targeting systems, navigation aids, automatic target recognition, sensor fusion, threat warning and threat countermeasures. As of July 9, 2021, the current director is Amanda Gentry.

The divisions formerly located at Hanscom AFB and Rome Research Site moved to Wright-Patterson AFB under the Defense Base Realignment and Closure, 2005 Commission.

The Directorate has contributed significantly to the Integrated Sensor is Structure (ISIS) project managed by DARPA which is a project to develop a missile tracking airship. In June 2008, the Air Force announced that scientists working for the Sensors Directorate had demonstrated transparent transistors. These could eventually be used to develop technologies such as &quot;video image displays and coatings for windows, visors and windshields; electrical interconnects for future integrated multi-mode, remote sensing, focal plane arrays; high-speed microwave devices and circuits for telecommunications and radar transceivers; and semi-transparent, touch-sensitive screens for emerging multi-touch interface technologies.&quot;

===Space Vehicles Directorate===
The mission of the Space Vehicles Directorate is to develop and transition space technologies for more effective, more affordable warfighter missions. In addition to the Directorate headquarters at Kirtland AFB, New Mexico and an additional research facility at Hanscom AFB, Massachusetts, the High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program (HAARP) located near Gakona, Alaska is also jointly operated by the Space Vehicles Directorate as well as DARPA, the Office of Naval Research (ONR), the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) and universities to conduct ionospheric research. The current director is Col David Goldstein. The Battlespace Environment Division formerly located at Hanscom AFB moved to a new Research lab facility at Kirtland AFB in 2011–2012 as directed under the Defense Base Realignment and Closure, 2005 Commission.

The IBM RAD6000 radiation hardened single board computer, now produced by BAE Systems, was initially developed in a collaboration with the Space Electronics and Protection Branch and IBM Federal Systems and is now used on nearly 200 satellites and robotic spacecraft, including on the twin Mars Exploration Rovers—&quot;Spirit&quot; and &quot;Opportunity&quot;. In November 2005, the AFRL XSS-11 satellite demonstrator received Popular Science&#x27;s &quot;Best of What&#x27;s New&quot; award in the Aviation and Space category. The Space Vehicles Directorate is also a leading collaborator in the Department of Defense Operationally Responsive Space Office&#x27;s Tactical Satellite Program and served as program manager for the development of TacSat-2, TacSat-3, and is current program manager for the development of TacSat-5. They also have contributed experimental sensors to TacSat-4 which is managed by the NRL&#x27;s Center for Space Technology.

The University Nanosatellite Program, a satellite design and fabrication competition for universities jointly administered by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA), AFOSR, AFRL, and the Space Development and Test Wing, is also managed by the Space Vehicles Directorate&#x27;s Spacecraft Technology division. The fourth iteration of the competition was completed in March 2007 with the selection of Cornell University&#x27;s CUSat as the winner. Previous winners of the competition were University of Texas at Austin&#x27;s Formation Autonomy Spacecraft with Thrust, Relnav, Attitude, and Crosslink (FASTRAC) for Nanosat-3 and the joint 3 Corner Satellite (3CS) project by the University of Colorado at Boulder, Arizona State University and New Mexico State University for Nanosat-2. , only the 3CS spacecraft has launched, however FASTRAC has a launch tentatively scheduled for December 2009.

The Directorate has indirectly faced significant controversy over the HAARP project. While the project claims to be developed only for studying the effects of ionospheric disruption on communications, navigation, and power systems, many suspect it of being developed as a prototype for a &quot;Star Wars&quot; type of weapon system. Still others are more concerned with the environmental impact to migratory birds of beaming thousands of watts of power into the atmosphere.

In 2020, the Space Vehicles Directorate announced the creation of a new Deployable Structures Laboratory (DeSel) focused on developing high-strength materials and satellite structures at Kirtland Air Force Base.

<doc id="764267" wikidata="Q554871" url="?curid=764267" title="Alexander Lodygin">
<text>Alexander Nikolayevich Lodygin, known after immigration to US as Alexandre de Lodyguine (; October 6, 1847 – March 16, 1923) was a Russian electrical engineer and inventor, one of the inventors of the incandescent light bulb.

Alexander Nikolayevich Lodygin was born in Stenshino village, Tambov Governorate, Russian Empire. His parents were of a very old and noble family (descendants of Andrei Kobyla like Romanovs), but of very moderate means. He studied at the Tambov Cadet School (1859–1865). Then he served in the &quot;71st Belev regiment&quot;, and in 1866–1868 studied at the Moscow Infantry School. Soon after graduation from his military school he retired from the military and worked as a worker at the Tula weapons factory.

==Timeline== 
*1872: He decided to go to Saint Petersburg to attend lectures at Saint Petersburg Institute of Technology and to start working on an &quot;electrical helicopter&quot; (&quot;electrolyot&quot;). The electrical helicopter would need some sort of artificial lighting that would have to be electrical. He decided to start his helicopter work by developing a source of electrical light for it.
*1872: He applied for a Russian patent for his filament lamp. He also patented this invention in Austria, Britain, France, and Belgium. For a filament, Lodygin used a very thin carbon rod, placed under a bell-glass.
*August 1873: He demonstrated prototypes of his electric filament lamp in the physics lecture hall of the Saint Petersburg Institute of Technology.
*1873–1874: He conducted experiments with electric lighting on ships, city streets, etc.
*11 July 1874: He was granted the Russian patent, as patent number 1619.
*In 1874, the Petersburg Academy of Sciences awarded him with a Lomonosov Prize for his invention of the filament lamp. That same year, Lodygin established the Electric Lighting Company, A.N. Lodygin and Co.
*1875: From here on he was very interested in the socialist ideas of the Narodniks.
*1880s: After Narodniks killed Emperor Alexander II of Russia, there were repressions against their organization.
*1884: As a result, he had to emigrate from Russia to France and United States.
*1895: He married the German reporter Alma Schmidt, the daughter of an electrical engineer.
*1890s: He invented a few types of filament lamps with metallic filaments; some say he was the first scientist to use a tungsten filament. He got a patent for lamps with tungsten filaments (US Patent No. 575,002 &quot;Illuminant for Incandescent Lamps&quot;, Application on 4 January 1893) and sold it to General Electric (1906), who began the first industrial production of such lamps.
*1899: Petersburg Institute of Electrical Engineering awarded Lodygin with the honorary title of electrical engineer.
*1907: Lodygin returned to Russia. He continued work on a series of his inventions, including a new type of electrical motor, electrical welding, tungsten alloys, electrical ovens and smelting furnaces. He taught at Petersburg Institute of Electrical Engineering and worked for the Petersburg railroad.
*1914: He was sent by the Ministry of Agriculture to develop plans for electrification of Olonets and Novgorod governorates.
*After the February Revolution Lodygin emigrated to United States. Because of health problems he declined a Soviet offer to work for their State Plan for Electrification of Russia (1918).
*1923: He died in Brooklyn in New York.

He invented an incandescent light bulb before Thomas Edison, but it was not commercially profitable. The lamp with a tungsten filament is indeed the only design used now, but in 1906 they were too expensive.

Several Lodygin&#x27;s ideas were implemented much later, even after his death. In 1871 Lodygin proposed an autonomous diving apparatus that consisted of a steel mask, natural rubber costume, accumulator battery and a special apparatus for electrolysis of water. The diver was supposed to breathe the oxygen-hydrogen mix obtained by electrolysis of water.
The invented diving apparatus was very similar to modern scuba equipment

His ideas for an electrical helicopter were used many years later by Igor Sikorsky.

<text>A chief of police (COP) is the title given to an appointed official or an elected one in the chain of command of a police department, particularly in North America. A chief of police may also be known as a police chief or sometimes just a chief, while some countries favour other titles such as commissioner or chief constable. A police chief is appointed by and answerable to a state or local government.

== Duties ==
The precise role of a chief of police varies by country and sometimes within a country. The larger a police force or department, the more likely that some duties will be delegated to mid-ranked officers. The following list is a general sense of the actions and responsibilities held by any chief of police.

* Oversight of a department&#x27;s operations and budgeting
* Oversight of officers
** Limited disciplinary actions to be addressed on infractions of policy, rules, regulations, laws or ordinances
** Full dismissal or heavy sanctioning of officer duty; these powers vary by department
** Promotion and rank placement of officers
* Production and development of department policies and regulations
* Liaison with the governments that oversee and fund the department
* In small police departments, upkeep and updating of department equipment such as police vehicles, weapons, communications equipment and uniforms
* In the smallest police departments, the chief may also carry out the same duties as regular officers (patrol, investigations, etc.)

Police chiefs are usually sworn police officers, and therefore wear police uniforms and have the power of arrest, though there are exceptions. In practice, their work is administrative in all but the smallest police departments. The rare occasions when police chiefs make arrests have drawn media coverage. In 2014, Bernard Hogan-Howe chased a group of fare evaders and made an arrest. A taxi driver had approached Hogan-Howe for help, unaware that he was London&#x27;s police commissioner. In 2017, Los Angeles Police Department Chief Charlie Beck arrested a police officer on suspicion of a sexual offence.

== Canada ==

The title &quot;Chief of Police&quot; () is the most common title for the highest-ranked officer in a Canadian police service. The exceptions are: the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (commissioner), Ontario Provincial Police (commissioner), South Coast British Columbia Transportation Authority Police Service (chief officer), Vancouver Police Department (chief constable), West Vancouver Police Department (chief constable), Nelson Police Department (chief constable), Quebec City (director) and the Sûreté du Québec (director-general).

In the province of Ontario, a chief of police must be a sworn police officer and therefore have completed training at the Ontario Police College (OPC) or have served a probationary period with another recognized police force (such as the Royal Canadian Mounted Police&#x27;s academy known as &quot;Depot&quot;). This requirement is legislated in the Police Services Act of Ontario. The legislation states in section two that a chief of police is a police officer. Section 44.2 of the PSA defines the training requirements. There was a case in the police department of Guelph, Ontario, where a human resource manager was promoted to the position of deputy chief but was required to complete training at the OPC. The candidate is selected by a police services board.

=== Deputy chief ===

The title &quot;Deputy Chief of Police&quot;, or more commonly &quot;Deputy Chief&quot;, ranks directly below the chief. Officers are stylized as deputy chief, deputy chief constable (in British Columbia) and deputy commissioner or associate director (in Quebec). They serve as the second-in-command within a police service and may be tasked with specific responsibilities.

== Germany ==
In Germany, the police are structured at the state level. As a result, every State Police Department has its Chief of Police, and the titles for these chiefs vary from one state to another. 
==India==
In India, the police are structured at the state level. As a result, every State Police Department has its Chief of Police, and the titles for these chiefs vary from one state to another. The Chief of Kerala Police has the title of &quot;State Police Chief&quot;.
Most Indian state police departments generally has more than one officer with the rank of Director General (DG), because of which one of the officers with the rank of Director General is appointed to the position of the Director General of Police. The other common titles includes, &quot;Director General of Police, Director General and Inspector General of Police&quot;.

The Chiefs of Municipal Police Force has the title of Commissioner of Police (CP).

==Indonesia==

In Indonesia, the chief of the National Police of Indonesia is often colloquially dubbed: &quot;Kapolri&quot;, an acronym of &quot;Kepala Kepolisian Negara Republik Indonesia&quot; meaning &quot;Head of the National Police of the Republic of Indonesia&quot;.The National Police Chiefs are four-star ranking officers in the national police. The National Police Chief is appointed to the position by the President of Indonesia after the nomination of a candidate is approved in House of Representatives and is directly responsible to the president. Since Indonesia adopts the system of a unified &quot;national police&quot;, the chief of the Indonesian National Police holds strong responsibility in policing authorities nationally across Indonesia. The police chief usually conducts strong relations and work together with the Commander of the National Armed Forces. In line with the general features of unified structure of local governments, all chiefs of the Indonesian police, at district level (&quot;kapolsek&quot;, &quot;kepala kepolisian sektor&quot;), municipal level (&quot;kapolres&quot;&quot;, &quot;kepala kepolisian resor&quot;), and provincial level (&quot;kapolda&quot;&quot;, &quot;kepala kepolisian daerah&quot;) in Indonesia, are subordinates of &quot;Kapolri&quot;, the national police chief.

== Philippines ==
In the Philippines, the chief of police was the head of small city and municipal police.

== United Kingdom ==

In the United Kingdom, the chief police officer for 43 of the 45 territorial police forces and the three special police forces holds the rank of chief constable. The exceptions are the Metropolitan Police Service and City of London Police, where the chief police officer instead holds the rank of commissioner. The umbrella term for the chief constables and commissioners is &quot;chief police officer&quot;. The term &quot;chief officer&quot;, by contrast, includes the chief police officers and their deputies and assistants. The members of the National Police Chiefs&#x27; Council are all of chief officer rank, including police staff equivalents, but the organisation does not represent its members&#x27; interests; rather, the Chief Police Officers&#x27; Staff Association serves this purpose.

The rank of commissioner should not be confused with the police and crime commissioners. They are elected officials who oversee a police force and how its funds are spent, rather than being police officers.

==United States==
Chief of police is the most common title for the head of a police department of a city. The highest-ranking officers of boroughs and parishes are also known as police chiefs. In large urban areas, some departments are led by an overseer who is not a sworn officer, usually referred to as a commissioner. In these departments, the police chief is the highest-ranking police officer of the agency but not the department head. The New York City Police Department is one such case where the commissioner is the head of the NYPD. The resources available to the head of a police department vary greatly; the chief of a small town may be the only paid employee of the police department with volunteer officers at their disposal only on certain occasions. On the other hand, the chief of a major city may have thousands or in the case of very large cities such as New York tens of thousands of sworn officers. Such a department may have thousands of employees other than police officers, including operators, secretaries, and unsworn peace officers. Alternative titles for a chief of police include police commissioner, colonel, police superintendent, police president or police director.

A sheriff is the chief of a county law enforcement agency. Although sheriffs are not usually counted as police chiefs, their agencies usually have the powers and role of a police department (although in some rare cases, the role of a sheriff&#x27;s agency is limited to non-policing matters such as courtroom security). The usual difference between a sheriff and a police chief is that sheriffs are elected (except in New York City, Rhode Island and Hawaii) and responsible for a county whereas a police chief manages law enforcement in a city or town and is appointed by its local government. Many state constitutions require every county to have a sheriff; some make no provision for this position to be eliminated even in the case of the formation of a consolidated city–county or &quot;metropolitan government&quot; because of which a decision on the division the powers between the county sheriff and the city chief of police is made. The usual compromise allows the chief of police to exercise law enforcement jurisdiction and to give the sheriff and his deputies authority over jails and the serving of civil papers. An alternative and lesser-used solution is to make the office of sheriff a purely ceremonial one. One other solution, an example of which is seen in the case of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, is to provide for the sheriff to simultaneously serve as the chief of police, thus remaining as the chief law enforcement officer (CLEO) of the county. Other titles for the executives of Sheriff&#x27;s Departments include colonel, superintendent, and director.

The fraternal organization International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP) is an organization that many chiefs of police are associated with.

The extent to how much a police a police department is overtly influenced by politics is also an important topic and varies greatly from one jurisdiction to another. Increasingly, all U.S. law enforcement officers including small-town police chiefs and their charges are being required to meet at least minimum levels of professional training.

The rank insignia for the chief of a large or medium-sized department most often consists of three or four gold stars, similar to the insignia of a lieutenant general or general in the army. Smaller departments and state agencies most often consists of silver or gold eagles similar to colonel in the army; however, several small departments with only a few dozen employees have been known to possess five star rank insignia for the police chief, the same as a General of the Army . On the opposite, some extremely small police department chiefs wear no rank insignia at all, or simply a pin which reads &quot;CHIEF&quot;.

<text>The Hawaiian Islanders were a minor league team of the Arena Football League&#x27;s developmental league, the AF2. Based in Honolulu, Hawaii, the Hawaiian Islanders home field was at the Neal S. Blaisdell Center Arena. It competed in the AF2 National Conference West. They were owned by Charles Wang, who also owned the New York Islanders and the AFL&#x27;s New York Dragons. The Islanders were an affiliate of the Dragons, along with the short-lived New Haven Ninjas. The team existed from 2002 to 2004.

The Islanders were coached by Guy Benjamin and Chad Carlson in 2002. In 2003, they were coached by Cal Lee, who had been coaching high school football at Hawaii&#x27;s St. Louis School for the past 20 seasons. Fullback Josh White played with the Islanders before playing in the AFL.

The team disbanded after the 2004 season.

During the team&#x27;s inaugural 2002 season, Oceanic Time Warner Cable carried every home game live on a pay-per-view basis. Kanoa Leahey and Robert Kekaula served as the television announcers.

<text>This is a list of destroyer escorts of the United States Navy, listed in a table sortable by both name and hull-number. It includes the hull classification symbols DE (both Destroyer Escort and Ocean Escort), DEG (Destroyer Escort, Guided missile), and DER (Destroyer Escort, Radar picket).

==Historical overview==
The Lend-Lease Act was passed into law in the US in March 1941 enabling the United Kingdom to procure merchant ships, warships and munitions etc. from the US, in order to help with the war effort. This enabled the UK to commission the US to design, build and supply an escort vessel that was suitable for anti submarine warfare in deep open ocean situations, which they did in June 1941. Captain E.L. Cochrane of the American Bureau of Shipping came up with a design which was known as the British Destroyer Escort (BDE). The BDE designation was retained by the first six Destroyer Escorts transferred to the United Kingdom (BDE 1, 2, 3, 4, 12 and 46); of the initial order of 50 these were the only ones the Royal Navy received, the rest being reclassified as Destroyer Escort (DE) on 25 January 1943 and taken over by the United States Navy.

Ships that were classified DE or DEG were reclassified in 1975 as FF or FFG (frigates). This affected hull numbers DE-1037 and higher as well as all DEGs.

==Classes==

* 97 &quot;Evarts&quot; were completed 
** 32 converted to Royal Navy s before commissioning as DEs
** 34 converted to DERs
* 148 &quot;Buckleys&quot; were completed
** 46 converted to &quot;Captain&quot;s before commissioning as DEs
** 37 reclassified and converted to APDs after having been commissioned as DEs
** 6 in addition to the 148 completed as APDs
* 22 &quot;Rudderrow&quot; were completed
** 1 converted to APD after commissioning as DE
** 50 additional completed as APDs
* 83 &quot;John C. Butler&quot; were completed
** 2 converted to DERs

* DEG-7 through 13 The ships were redesignated FFG, a patrol frigate design would be re-designated the FFG-7 Oliver Hazard Perry class frigate.

==Radar picket Destroyer Escorts (DER)==

During World War II seven DEs would be converted to this role, and during the Cold War another 36 would be converted. All would be replaced by more modern radar by 1965.

==High Speed Transports (APD)==
During World War II 94 DEs would be converted to High Speed Transports for amphibious assaults and raids; in 1969 all surviving ships would be reclassified as Fast Amphibious Transports (LPR).

<doc id="764303" wikidata="Q1015367" url="?curid=764303" title="Longest prefix match">
<text>Longest prefix match (also called Maximum prefix length match) refers to an algorithm used by routers in Internet Protocol (IP) networking to select an entry from a routing table.

Because each entry in a forwarding table may specify a sub-network, one destination address may match more than one forwarding table entry. The most specific of the matching table entries — the one with the longest subnet mask — is called the longest prefix match. It is called this because it is also the entry where the largest number of leading address bits of the destination address match those in the table entry.
For example, consider this IPv4 forwarding table (CIDR notation is used):

 192.168.20.16/28
 192.168.0.0/16

When the address codice_1 needs to be looked up, both entries in the forwarding table &quot;match&quot;. That is, both entries contain the looked up address. In this case, the longest prefix of the candidate routes is codice_2, since its subnet mask (/28) is longer than the other entry&#x27;s mask (/16), making the route more specific.

Forwarding tables often contain a default route, which has the shortest possible prefix match, to fall back on in case matches with all other entries fail.

<text>The Klaskanine River is a tributary of the Youngs River, approximately long, in northwest Oregon in the United States. It drains a small section of the Coast Range in the extreme northwest corner of the state in the watershed of the nearby Columbia River.

It rises in three short forks in the mountains in central Clatsop County, in the Clatsop State Forest north of Saddle Mountain State Natural Area. The Middle Fork joins the North Fork, which then joins the South Fork. The combined stream flows generally northwest and enters the Youngs River from the east approximately south of Astoria.

<text>Ugueth Urtaín Urbina Villarreal (; born February 15, 1974) is a Venezuelan former relief pitcher in Major League Baseball. A two-time All-Star, Urbina led the National League in saves with 41 in the 1999 season and helped the Florida Marlins win the 2003 World Series. He is the only player in major league history with the initials &quot;UU&quot; or &quot;UUU&quot;. His baseball career was cut short after the 2005 season, as he was arrested by Venezuelan authorities for attempted murder, for which he served seven years in prison.

==Playing career==
In 11 major league seasons, Urbina compiled a 44–49 record with 237 saves, 814 strikeouts, and a 3.45 ERA. He played with the Montreal Expos (1995–2001), Boston Red Sox (2001–2002), Texas Rangers (2003), Florida Marlins (2003), Detroit Tigers (2004–2005), and Philadelphia Phillies (2005).

===Montreal Expos (1995–2001)===
Urbina started his career as a middle reliever with the Montreal Expos, where he pitched for six seasons and was an All-Star once, in 1998.

As a 21-year-old in 1995, Urbina made seven pitching appearances, starting four, and went 2–2 with a 6.17 ERA. In 1996 he established himself on Montreal&#x27;s pitching staff, as he hurled 33 games, including 17 starts and a career-high 114 innings, and posted a 10–5 record with a 3.71 ERA. His career as a closer began In 1997, when he collected 27 saves with a 3.71 ERA and a 5–8 record in 63 relief appearances.

Urbina improved in 1998, going 6–3 with 34 saves and a 1.30 ERA in 64 games. In 1999, he topped the National League with 41 saves, while notching a 6–6 record and a 3.69 ERA in 71 contests. In 2000, Urbina was limited to 13 appearances and ended the year with an 0–1 mark, eight saves and a 4.05 ERA.

Urbina started the 2001 season well, going 2–1 with a 4.24 ERA while notching 15 saves in 45 games before being traded to the Boston Red Sox on July 31.

===Boston Red Sox (2001–2002)===
Urbina was headed to the Red Sox in the same transaction that sent Tomo Ohka and Rich Rundles to Montreal. Urbina appeared in 19 games with Boston, saving nine and compiling a 0–1 record with a 2.25 ERA. Overall, he went 2–2 with 24 saves and a 3.65 ERA in 64 relief opportunities.

Urbina earned his second All-Star berth in 2002, when he went 1–6 with 40 saves and a 3.00 ERA in 61 games.

===Texas Rangers (2003)===
Urbina signed as a free agent with the Texas Rangers on December 23, 2002. He went 0–4 with 26 saves and a 4.19 ERA in 39 games for the Rangers in 2003 before being traded during the midseason.

===Florida Marlins (2003)===
On July 11, 2003, Urbina was traded by Texas to the Florida Marlins in exchange for Adrián González, Ryan Snare, and a minor leaguer. For the remainder of the season, Urbina served as a setup man for Marlins closer Braden Looper, going 3–0 with six saves and a 1.41 ERA in 33 games. He posted a combined record of 3–4 with 32 saves and a 2.81 ERA in 54 appearances during the 2003 season.

Urbina finished his short stint with the Marlins by helping them win the 2003 World Series title, while defeating the New York Yankees in six games. During his only postseason in the majors, he went 1-0 along with four saves and a 3.46 ERA in 10 games.

===Detroit Tigers (2004–2005)===
Urbina signed a two-year contract with the Detroit Tigers on March 29, 2004. That marked his last year where he was closer for at least part of the season. In 54 games, he went 4–6 with 21 saves and a 4.50 ERA. He began the 2005 season in good form, collecting a 1–3 record with a 2.63 ERA while contributing with nine saves, but then found himself on the move again for the third time in his career.

===Philadelphia Phillies (2005)===
On June 8, 2005, the Tigers traded Urbina along with infielder Ramón Martínez to the Philadelphia Phillies in exchange for second baseman Plácido Polanco.

Urbina went 4–6 with a 4.13 ERA and just one save in 56 games. Overall, he posted a 5–6 record with 10 saves and a 3.62 ERA in a career-high 81 games.

He made his last Major League appearance on October 2, 2005, during a 9–3 Phillies victory over the Washington Nationals at RFK Stadium.

==Pitching style==
Urbina&#x27;s pitches included a moving fastball and a slider that enabled him to hold left-handed hitters in check. He also threw a changeup which tailed away from right-handers and a splitter that broke sharply.

==Mother&#x27;s kidnapping==
In September 2004, Urbina&#x27;s 54-year-old mother, Maura Villarreal, was kidnapped and held for a $6 million ransom in southwest Venezuela. Urbina&#x27;s family refused to pay the ransom and an anti-kidnapping unit rescued her in a military-style operation on February 18, 2005.

==Attempted murder conviction==
On November 7, 2005, Urbina was arrested in Venezuela for attempted murder, stemming from an incident on October 16. He assaulted five farm workers on his property, accusing them of stealing a gun. Urbina used a machete and tried to douse them with gasoline. On March 28, 2007, Urbina was convicted of attempted murder and sentenced to fourteen years and seven months in prison. He was released on December 24, 2012, after serving just over seven years of his sentence.

== Family ==
Urbina has a son Juan who pitched in the Mets organization, appearing in three seasons for the short season single-A Brooklyn Cyclones.

<text>Georges Canguilhem (; ; 4 June 1904 – 11 September 1995) was a French philosopher and physician who specialized in epistemology and the philosophy of science (in particular, biology).

==Life and work==
Canguilhem entered the École Normale Supérieure in 1924 as part of a class that included Jean-Paul Sartre, Raymond Aron and Paul Nizan. He aggregated in 1927 and then taught in lycées throughout France, taking up the study of medicine while teaching in Toulouse.

He took up a post at the Clermont-Ferrand based University of Strasbourg in 1941, and received his medical doctorate in 1943, in the middle of World War II. Using the pseudonym &quot;Lafont&quot; Canguilhem became active in the French Resistance, serving as a doctor in Auvergne.

By 1948 he was the French equivalent of department chair in philosophy at Strasbourg as well. Seven years later, he was named a professor at the Sorbonne and succeeded Gaston Bachelard as the director of the Institut d&#x27;histoire des sciences, a post he occupied until 1971, at which time he undertook an active emeritus career.

In 1983 he was awarded the Sarton Medal by the History of Science Society. In 1987 he received the &quot;médaille d&#x27;or&quot;, awarded by the Centre national de la recherche scientifique (CNRS).

===Philosophy of biology===

Canguilhem&#x27;s principal work in philosophy of science is presented in two books, &quot;Le Normal et le pathologique&quot;, first published in 1943 and then expanded in 1968, and &quot;La Connaissance de la vie&quot; (1952). &quot;Le Normal et le pathologique&quot; is an extended exploration into the nature and meaning of normality in medicine and biology, the production and institutionalization of medical knowledge. It is still a seminal work in medical anthropology and the history of ideas, and is widely influential in part thanks to Canguilhem&#x27;s influence on Michel Foucault. &quot;La Connaissance de la vie&quot; is an extended study of the specificity of biology as a science, the historical and conceptual significance of vitalism, and the possibility of conceiving organisms not on the basis of mechanical and technical models that would reduce the organism to a machine, but rather on the basis of the organism&#x27;s relation to the milieu in which it lives, its successful survival in this milieu, and its status as something greater than &quot;the sum of its parts&quot;. Canguilhem argued strongly for these positions, criticising 18th and 19th century vitalism (and its politics) but also cautioning against the reduction of biology to a &quot;physical science.&quot; He believed such a reduction deprived biology of a proper field of study, ideologically transforming living beings into mechanical structures serving a chemical/physical equilibrium that cannot account for the particularity of organisms or for the complexity of life. He furthered and altered these critiques in a later book, &quot;Ideology and Rationality in the History of the Life Sciences&quot;.

Canguilhem was originally hostile to the ideas of Henri Bergson and vitalism but was later influenced by them and developed his own &quot;idiosyncratic brand of vitalism.&quot; 

More specifically, Canguilhem’s take on vitalism was influenced in the early stages of his career by his non-dogmatic reading of Karl Marx. Prinz and Schmidgen argue that Canguilhem was the key representative of an “undercurrent of European philosophy” they call “Vitalist Marxism,” designating “a theoretical position that not only recognizes ‘life’ as an essential foundation of the production process in modern societies, but also considers it a critical resource for resistance to the capitalist logic of exploitation”.

In fact, Canguilhem’s above-mentioned concepts – most importantly the irreducibility of the organism to the machine and the relation between the organism and the &quot;milieu&quot; – can be traced back to his early engagement with Marx’s notion of labor mediating between men and nature as well as Marx’s critical analysis of the corrupted shape this mediation takes under the regime of factory production.

More than just a great theoretician, Canguilhem was one of the few philosophers of the 20th century to develop an approach that was shaped by a medical education. He helped define a method of studying the history of science which was practical and rigorous. His work focused on the one hand on the concepts of &quot;normal&quot; and &quot;pathological&quot; and, on the other, a critical history of the formation of concepts such as &quot;reflex&quot; in the history of science. Canguilhem was also a mentor to several French scholars, most notably Foucault, for whom he served as a sponsor in the presentation of &quot;Histoire de la folie à l&#x27;âge classique&quot; (&quot;History of Madness&quot;) for the &quot;Doctorat d&#x27;État&quot; and whose work he followed throughout the latter&#x27;s life.

=== Institutional role ===
As Inspector General and then president of the jury d&#x27;Agrégation in philosophy, Canguilhem had a tremendous and direct influence over philosophical instruction in France in the latter half of the twentieth century and was known to more than a generation of French academic philosophers as a demanding and exacting evaluator who, as Louis Althusser remarked, believed he could correct the philosophical understanding of teachers by bawling them out. This belief did not prevent him from being regarded with considerable affection by the generation of intellectuals that came to the fore in the 1960s, including Jacques Derrida, Michel Foucault, Louis Althusser, and Jacques Lacan. Althusser once wrote to his English translator that &quot;my debt to Canguilhem is incalculable&quot; (italics in the original, from &quot;Economy and Society&quot; 27, page 171). Likewise, Foucault, in his introduction to Canguilhem&#x27;s &quot;The Normal and the Pathological&quot;, wrote:

Take away Canguilhem and you will no longer understand much about Althusser, Althusserism and a whole series of discussions which have taken place among French Marxists; you will no longer grasp what is specific to sociologists such as Bourdieu, Castel, Passeron and what marks them so strongly within sociology; you will miss an entire aspect of the theoretical work done by psychoanalysts, particularly by the followers of Lacan. Further, in the entire discussion of ideas which preceded or followed the movement of &#x27;68, it is easy to find the place of those who, from near or from afar, had been trained by Canguilhem.

Derrida recalled that Canguilhem advised him early in his career that he would have to distinguish himself as a serious scholar before he could exhibit professionally the particular philosophical sense of humour for which he is at turns famous and notorious, advice which Derrida seemed to have taken in earnest.

After years of neglect, a great deal of Canguilhem&#x27;s writings have been translated into English. Among them are his celebrated works &quot;The Normal and the Pathological&quot; and &quot;Knowledge of Life&quot; as well as two collections of essays, titled &quot;A Vital Rationalist&quot; and &quot;Writings on Medicine.&quot;

<text>Lawmaking is the process of crafting legislation. In its purest sense, it is the basis of governance. 

Lawmaking in modern democracies is the work of legislatures, which exist at the local, regional, and national levels and make such laws as are appropriate to their level, and binding over those under their jurisdictions. These bodies are influenced by lobbyists, pressure groups, sometimes partisan considerations, but ultimately by the voters who elected them and to which they are responsible, if the system is working as intended. Even the expenditure of governmental funds is an aspect of lawmaking, as in most jurisdictions the budget is a matter of law.

In dictatorships and absolute monarchies the leader can make law essentially by the stroke of a pen, one of the main objections to such an arrangement. However, a seemingly-analogous event can occur even in a democracy where the executive can make executive orders which have the force of law. In some instance, even regulations issued by executive departments can have the force of law. Libertarians, in particular, are known for denouncing such actions as being anti-democratic, but they have become such a salient feature of modern governance that it is hard to picture a system in which they no longer exist, because it is hard to picture the time involved in every regulation being debated prior to becoming law. That, say libertarians, is precisely the point: if such executive orders and regulations do not stand up to legislative scrutiny, they should never be implemented. In response to this, limits on regulatory authority have been made legislatively, and libertarians still contend for, if not the abolition of executive orders altogether, then their automatic sunset after a fixed period if not legislatively reviewed and confirmed; this policy has been adopted in some jurisdictions.

<doc id="764334" wikidata="Q2447529" url="?curid=764334" title="Acolytes Protection Agency">
<text>The Acolytes Protection Agency (APA) was an American professional wrestling tag team who consisted of Bradshaw (John Layfield) and Faarooq (Ron Simmons). They wrestled in the World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment (WWF/E) between October 1998 and March 2004.

Before forming the APA, Faarooq and Bradshaw were known simply as The Acolytes and went on to become a part of The Undertaker&#x27;s Ministry of Darkness. As The Acolytes, they won two World Tag Team Championships in 1999, while feuding with X-Pac and Kane and the Hardy Boyz. After renaming themselves the Acolytes Protection Agency in 2000, they adopted the gimmick of bodyguards-for-hire to other wrestlers, and won a third tag team championship in 2001.

In 2002, the brand split also split the duo as the 2002 draft sent Faarooq to SmackDown and Bradshaw to Raw. As a singles competitor, Bradshaw had an extensive hardcore wrestling career, winning the Hardcore Championship on various occasions. The two reunited as a tag team in Ohio Valley Wrestling and then on &quot;SmackDown&quot; in 2003. The team again split in 2004 when Simmons was getting ready to retire, and as part of Bradshaw&#x27;s heel turn Simmons was on-screen released by WWE; Bradshaw continued his singles career before retiring in 2009, and the group has made sporadic appearances afterwards, mostly in a non-competing capacity.

== History ==

=== The Acolytes (1998–2000) ===
As single competitors in the World Wrestling Federation, Bradshaw and Faarooq&#x27;s careers had stalled. WWF management then placed them in a tag team called The Hell&#x27;s Henchmen managed by The Jackyl. Both men made their first appearance on TV as a team on the November 15, 1998, episode of &quot;Sunday Night Heat&quot; attacking 8-Ball, Skull and Paul Ellering as the D.O.A. came down to the ring for a match. The following week on &quot;Sunday Night Heat&quot;, The Jackyl came down to the ring as the duo interrupted a match and proclaimed Bradshaw and Faarooq to be his Acolytes. Both men made their official tag team debut on the November 30, 1998, episode of &quot;Raw is War&quot;, when they attacked Tiger Ali Singh and his manager, Babu, after Singh&#x27;s match against Val Venis. The team was notorious for their intense and brutal beatings done during the ensuing matches. Afterwards, they won tag team matches against the team of Venis and The Godfather and the team of The J.O.B. Squad.

When The Jackyl left the WWF, the duo joined The Undertaker&#x27;s new heel stable, the Ministry of Darkness. They debuted in Undertaker&#x27;s Ministry on the January 11, 1999, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, recruited Dennis Knight into the Ministry, giving him the name Mideon. After Undertaker&#x27;s Ministry merged with The Corporation to form the Corporate Ministry, the Acolytes began a feud with X-Pac and Kane over the WWF World Tag Team Championship. The feud began on the May 30, 1999, episode of &quot;Sunday Night Heat&quot; with the Acolytes attacking X-Pac after his match against Big Boss Man. Their attack was to no avail, however, as Kane, X-Pac&#x27;s tag team partner, came down to the ring to attack the Acolytes. Later that night, the Acolytes challenged X-Pac and Kane for a WWF Tag Team Championship match on the following &quot;Raw&quot; broadcast. The following night on &quot;Raw&quot;, X-Pac and Kane accepted the challenge. During the match, however, Shane McMahon, who was also a member of the Corporate Ministry, interfered in the match, causing Kane to chase McMahon to the backstage area. The situation allowed Bradshaw to hit X-Pac with a Clothesline from Hell into a pinfall, allowing the Acolytes to win their first WWF Tag Team Championship.

The Acolytes then began a feud with the Hardy Boyz, who had defeated The Brood at King of the Ring to become the number one contenders to the Acolytes&#x27; WWF Tag Team Championship. The feud intensified on the July 3, 1999, episode of &quot;Shotgun Saturday Night&quot;, when the Acolytes attacked the Hardy Boyz during a segment. On the July 5, 1999, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, however, the Acolytes lost the WWF Tag Team Championship to the Hardy Boyz, after Jeff attacked Bradshaw with Michael Hayes&#x27;s, the Hardy Boyz&#x27;s manager, cane, and Matt delivered a Tornado DDT on Bradshaw into a pinfall. The Acolytes regained the WWF Tag Team Championship at Fully Loaded in a No Disqualification Handicap match against the Hardy Boyz and Hayes.

After regaining the championship, the Acolytes began another feud with Kane with various partners. On the August 8, 1999, episode of &quot;Sunday Night Heat&quot;, Kane teamed up with Road Dogg to face the Acolytes for the WWF Tag Team Championship, in a losing effort. The following night on &quot;Raw&quot;, Kane then teamed up with X-Pac to face the Acolytes in another championship match, in which X-Pac delivered an X-Factor to Faarooq into the pinfall, which meant that the Acolytes lost the title. The following week, they lost a rematch for the WWF Tag Team Championship. After losing their rematch, they won a Tag Team Turmoil match at SummerSlam to become number one contenders for the WWF Tag Team Championship but their title match against The Big Show and The Undertaker ended in a no-contest. After this, they feuded with the Dudley Boyz and defeated them at Unforgiven. The Acolytes then developed a gimmick as card players and beer drinkers, hustling many wrestlers and WWF employees out of their money.

After sporadic feuds, the Acolytes won a tag team battle royal at Armageddon against seven other tag teams to win a WWF Tag Team Championship match. They were unable to win the championship at the Royal Rumble, as the New Age Outlaws defeated them, after Billy Gunn performed a Fame-ass-er on Bradshaw, after interference from X-Pac.

=== Acolytes Protection Agency (2000–2002) ===

According to Layfield, he got drunk during a party for his birthday in Baltimore, and Vince and Shane McMahon saw him. They found it funny, so they asked both of them to portray a similar, beer drinking character on TV, just sitting around, playing cards, drinking beer and getting into fights backstage and in bars. Upon being told this, Simmons said it was “the best idea I’ve ever heard”, as both Layfield and Simmons liked to participate in the APA&#x27;s social activities in real life, so both talents felt at home. On the January 31, 2000, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, the Mean Street Posse asked the Acolytes to protect them, which they refused to do, until the Posse offered to pay them. When they did, Bradshaw started the Acolytes Protection Agency (APA). Behind the scenes, the gimmick of the tag team was also created by John Layfield. To further enhance their mercenary gimmick, the APA began to appear weekly backstage in an &quot;office,&quot; dubbed the &quot;APA Office&quot;. The office was a free-standing door and frame, with the letters &#x27;A.P.A.&#x27; written in magic marker on a piece of typing paper. A running gag consisted of Faarooq and Bradshaw seated at a table playing cards with the door open. When a wrestler would appear to hire their services, they would admonish the potential customer for either not knocking on the door, walking around the door frame or not closing the door on the way out. The APA would only accept cash or beer in payment for protection work. After protecting many WWF superstars, the APA began a feud with Bull Buchanan and Big Bossman. On the April 10, 2000, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, the APA protected Kai En Tai during a match, when they were attacked by Buchanan and Bossman. The APA, however, was unsuccessful in winning a tag team match against them at Backlash. On the May 18, 2000, episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, the APA were hired to protect Crash Holly for an hour, to prevent him from losing his WWF Hardcore Championship. After the hour was up, the APA left, allowing Gerald Brisco to pin Holly for the Hardcore Championship. The situation resulted in Holly challenging Bradshaw in a Hardcore match, which Bradshaw won. Later that week on &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Faarooq defeated Holly in a Hardcore match.
On the June 26, 2000, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, the APA won a Tag-Team Battle Royal against seven other teams to earn an opportunity at the WWF Tag Team Championship. During the weeks leading up to Fully Loaded, Edge and Christian avoided defending the Tag Team Championship against the APA by challenging their opponents to one-on-one matches: on the July 10, 2000, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Edge defeated Bradshaw, while on &quot;SmackDown!&quot; later that week, Christian was defeated by Faarooq. At Fully Loaded, the APA defeated Edge and Christian by disqualification but due to WWF rules, Edge and Christian retained the Tag Team Championship.

On the September 7, 2000, episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, the Dudley Boyz and the APA formed an alliance. The following week on &quot;Raw&quot;, the APA faced Right to Censor (Bull Buchanan and The Goodfather) in a losing effort. Then, on the September 18, 2000, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, the APA come out to help the Dudley Boyz against an assault by all the members of the Right to Censor. At Unforgiven, The Dudley Boyz and the APA lost an Eight-man Tag Team match against Right to Censor.

After sporadic feuds through midway 2001, the APA were awarded a WWF Tag Team Championship match against the Dudley Boyz. On the July 9, 2001, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Bradshaw pinned D-Von to win their third WWF Tag Team Championship. The following month on &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, however, the APA lost the WWF Tag Team Championship to Kanyon and Diamond Dallas Page, one of the invading WCW wrestlers in The Alliance stable. After losing the Tag Team Championship, Faarooq was briefly absent, while Bradshaw pursued singles championships: on the September 27, 2001, episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Bradshaw lost a WWF Intercontinental Championship match against Christian. On the October 22, 2001, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Bradshaw defeated The Hurricane to win the WWF European Championship. When Faarooq returned, Bradshaw lost the European Championship to Christian on the November 1, 2001, episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;. At No Way Out, the APA won a Tag Team Turmoil match to win a WWF Tag Team Championship match at WrestleMania X8. The APA were unsuccessful in winning the Tag Team Championship on two occasions: on the February 28, 2002, episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; and at WrestleMania X8.

=== Initial separation (2002) ===

On March 25, 2002, the APA were split up when the WWF roster was divided into the Raw and SmackDown! brands. Bradshaw was drafted to Raw, while Faarooq was drafted to SmackDown!. On the Raw brand, Bradshaw won the WWF Hardcore Championship eighteen times, and went back to his Blackjack Texan gimmick, while Faarooq – now wrestling under his real name – had a brief stint with the SmackDown! brand, teaming with Reverend D-Von in a tournament to determine the newly created WWE Tag Team Champions. In September 2002, Bradshaw was injured and was inactive for six months.

=== Return to SmackDown (2003–2004) ===
After their brief single careers, Bradshaw and Simmons reunited in WWE&#x27;s former farm territory, Ohio Valley Wrestling in March 2003, winning the OVW Southern Tag Team Championship on April 10, 2003. They vacated the OVW title when they returned to WWE television on the June 19, 2003, episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; to assist The Undertaker in an ambush from the F.B.I. During their return, they revived their former gimmick of beer drinking and card playing segments in backstage areas. Bradshaw had a new look as he had a shorter hair style, debuted a clean shaven look and went to his natural hair color. At Vengeance, the APA hosted a Bar Room Brawl, which Bradshaw won. On the September 4, 2003, episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, the APA were booked in a WWE Tag Team Championship match against the defending champions, Charlie Haas and Shelton Benjamin, which the APA lost. After sporadic tag team matches, the APA was once again booked in a WWE Tag Team Championship match at WrestleMania XX, in a Fatal-Four way tag team match also involving Haas and Benjamin, Rikishi and Scotty 2 Hotty, and the Basham Brothers, which Rikishi and Scotty won to retain the Tag Team Championship. On March 18, 2004, the APA angered SmackDown! general manager Paul Heyman by mocking his being Stunned by Stone Cold Steve Austin the previous week; Heyman ordered them to face Rikishi and Scotty 2 Hotty with the APA&#x27;s jobs on the line. After the APA was defeated, Heyman only fired Faarooq and told Bradshaw to worry about his own career, calling him a valued asset to the company and noting his role as a published author and a Fox financial analyst. While Bradshaw stayed, Faarooq left in disgust. The angle covered Simmons&#x27; real-life retirement from professional wrestling.

=== Non-wrestling reunions and legacy (2007–present) ===
Two years later in 2006, Layfield was injured and became a commentator for SmackDown. Bradshaw returned to wrestling in 2007, on the Raw brand, while Simmons began cutting promos with his trademark catchphrase, &quot;Damn!&quot;.

The APA had an in-ring reunion on the December 3, 2007, episode of &quot;Raw&quot; when Hornswoggle hired their protection services for his handicap match against Jonathan Coachman and Carlito.

Simmons and Layfield reunited for &quot;Raw 1000&quot; on July 23, 2012, when they provided protection for Lita during her brief match with Heath Slater. Layfield attacked Slater with a Clothesline from Hell, and after the match, Simmons simply said his trademark catchphrase, &quot;Damn.&quot;

The APA again reunited on the January 19, 2015, episode of &quot;Raw&quot; (dubbed &quot;Raw Reunion&quot; due to numerous special appearances by various WWE Hall of Famers and Legends), alongside the New Age Outlaws, saving the New World Order (nWo) members from The Ascension, during which Layfield attacked Ascension member Viktor with a &quot;Clothesline from Hell&quot;.

On April 2, 2016, the APA inducted The Godfather into the WWE Hall of Fame. They returned the following year, on March 31, 2017, to induct Theodore Long into the WWE Hall of Fame.

On January 22, 2018, the APA appeared backstage hosting a poker game during &quot;WWE Raw 25 Years&quot;.

On the October 23, 2020, episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, both Simmons and Layfield, along with Hall of Famer Theodore Long appeared in a court-like segment named &quot;Law and Otis&quot; wherein debates are tackled between Otis and The Miz for the Money In The Bank contract.

Since October 17, 2022, Layfield, now a manager for Baron Corbin, had been frequently shown doing poker matches backstage with Akira Tozawa.

On January 23, 2023, Layfield and Simmons once again appeared backstage for Raw is XXX to celebrate the 30th anniversary of Monday Night Raw, the pair once again hosted poker matches.

On the 2023 WWE Hall of Fame ceremony, Layfield and Simmons appeared to award Tim White with the Warrior Award. White&#x27;s brothers, Tom and Pat, accepted the award.

Layfield and Simmons reunited again on Night 2 of the 2024 WWE Draft, with Layfield selecting draft picks for the Raw brand, and Simmons selecting draft picks for the SmackDown brand.

<doc id="764335" wikidata="Q7397704" url="?curid=764335" title="Saddle Mountain State Natural Area">
<text>Saddle Mountain State Natural Area is a state park in northwest Oregon. It is located in the Northern Oregon Coast Range in central Clatsop County, about by road from Seaside. A long hiking trail climbs to the top of Saddle Mountain, which is located in the park. On clear days, the Pacific Ocean, Columbia River mouth and several of the Cascade mountains in Washington and Oregon can be seen from the summit.

==History==
Oregon&#x27;s State Land Board was given by the federal government on August 11, 1916, to be set aside for use as a park around Saddle Mountain. On November 21, 1928, the state highway commission, who at that time operated Oregon&#x27;s state parks, received as a gift from Nellie and O. W. Taylor to use for a park. This was the first land incorporated into what was originally known as Saddle Mountain State Park.
During the Great Depression, of the 1930s, the park was the site of a Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) camp. The state leased the land to the federal government for two years starting in June 1935. During their stay at the park, the CCC made improvements including building the main trail to the top of the mountain, constructing a road from the Sunset Highway to the main parking lot, the parking lot itself, a picnic area, and restrooms.

On December 5, 1935, the Oregon State Land Board donated the they received from the federal government to the state highway commission, as they felt the parks division could better manage the land. This new land, which already been logged, was incorporated into the park. Forest fires burned through many of the trees near the base of the mountain in 1936 and again in 1939. The state built an overnight camping area, a Quonset hut, and a water system complete with reservoir in 1948.

The Oregon State Board of Forestry built a fire lookout tower on the summit of Saddle Mountain in 1953. By 1964, the state had bought five tracts of land totaling and added them to the park, bringing the total to . By 1997 the park had been renamed Saddle Mountain State Natural Area.

==Details==

Saddle Mountain Road intercepts U.S. Route 26 eight miles (13 km) east of Necanicum Junction where Oregon Route 53 meets Route 26. A primary feature of the park is tall Saddle Mountain. From the top of the peak, on clear days, mountains in the Cascade Range far to the east can be seen, as well as the Pacific Ocean to the west and the mouth of the Columbia River to the north. Amenities at the park include primitive campsites, restrooms, trails, and picnic facilities. The campground is closed from October 31 to March 1.

Natural features in the park include forests and a year-round spring near summit of the mountain. Tree species include cedar, hemlock, and spruce. Other flora include the rare &quot;Cardamine pattersonii&quot;. A herd of elk have been seen in the park.

<text>Robert Norman William Blake, Baron Blake, (23 December 1916 – 20 September 2003), was an English historian and peer. He is best known for his 1966 biography of Benjamin Disraeli, and for &quot;The Conservative Party from Peel to Churchill&quot;, which grew out of his 1968 Ford lectures.

==Early life==
Robert Blake was born in Brundall, Norwich, the elder son of William Joseph Blake, a schoolmaster, and of Norah Lindley Blake, (&quot;née&quot; Daynes), the daughter of a leading Norwich solicitor. The family firm was Daynes, Hill &amp; Perks, subsequently acquired by Eversheds. He was said to be related to Admiral Robert Blake, of the Parliamentary navy.

Blake was educated at a dame school in Brundall; King Edward VI&#x27;s Norwich School, where his father taught History; and Magdalen College, Oxford, where he was an Eldon Law Scholar. He graduated from Oxford with a First in Modern Greats and a hockey Blue. One of his contemporaries at Oxford was Keith Joseph.

Blake had planned to go to the bar. However, when the Second World War broke out he was commissioned into the Royal Artillery, turning down an offer from a friend to join MI5. He was taken prisoner at the Siege of Tobruk in 1942, escaped from Italy in 1944, and was mentioned in despatches. He worked for MI6 from 1944 to 1946, where he was a colleague of Kim Philby.

==Academic career==
In 1947 he became a student (fellow) and tutor in Politics at Christ Church, Oxford, replacing Lord Pakenham, who had joined Clement Attlee&#x27;s government. His first work was an edition of the papers of Douglas Haig, which did much to restore Haig&#x27;s reputation. It was followed by a biography of Bonar Law, written at the invitation of Lord Beaverbrook, Law&#x27;s executor.

Blake&#x27;s most famous work is his 1966 &quot;Disraeli&quot;, a biography of Benjamin Disraeli, which has been variously described as &quot;the best single-volume biography of any British prime minister&quot; and &quot;the best biography of anyone in any language&quot;. He was elected a Fellow of the British Academy the following year.

Having abandoned a project for a biography of Lord Derby, in 1970 he published &quot;The Conservative Party from Peel to Churchill&quot;, a general history of the Conservative Party based on his 1968 Ford Lectures. The work was later extended to cover the period up to the premiership of Margaret Thatcher and, later, that of John Major.

In 1968 he was elected provost of The Queen&#x27;s College, Oxford, a post he retained until retirement in 1987. On 17 May 1971, on the recommendation of the Prime Minister Edward Heath, Blake was created a life peer as Baron Blake, of Braydeston in the County of Norfolk. In the House of Lords he took the Conservative whip. In 1972 he moved the address in reply to the Queen&#x27;s Speech.

His &quot;History of Rhodesia&quot; (1977) is, according to Kenneth O. Morgan, &quot;essentially a study of white rule, ending with sharp comments on the illegal breakaway regime of Ian Smith, where Blake&#x27;s views were much influenced by his friendship with the liberal Garfield Todd and his daughter&quot;. It makes interesting reading in conjunction with the less critical &quot;Rainbow on the Zambezi&quot; (1953) by Don Taylor.

In 1987 Lord Blake was nominated in the election for the Oxford Chancellorship, but lost to Roy Jenkins, although polling ahead of Edward Heath. Blake was hurt by the fact that the Cabinet had decided to endorse Heath, and became withdrawn from Oxford.

In 1990 he was one of the leading historians behind the setting up of the History Curriculum Association. The Association advocated a more knowledge-based history curriculum in schools. It expressed &quot;profound disquiet&quot; at the way history was being taught in the classroom and observed that the integrity of history was threatened.

In 1992 Blake gave the centenary Romanes Lecture on &quot;Gladstone, Disraeli and Queen Victoria&quot;.

Blake was for many years Senior Member (the University don responsible for ruling on internal disputes such as accusations of electoral malpractice) of the Oxford University Conservative Association.

==Politics==
Concomitant with his study of Conservative history, Blake was a political Conservative, and took the Conservative whip in the House of Lords. He defended the British government during the Suez Crisis and in later life was a Eurosceptic. He was, however, a supporter of proportional representation, and served as the Chairman of the Electoral Reform Society. He also rebelled over the War Crimes Bill.

Blake opposed the Labour Party&#x27;s policy to abolish the hereditary peers in the House of Lords. Writing the year before the 1997 general election, he commented:

Abolition of the hereditary vote ... is alleged to be phase one of a policy to substitute an elective Upper House for the existing chamber. Meanwhile we would have the biggest quango of all time: a House whose members would owe their seats solely to past or present prime ministerial patronage. Even as an interim measure, this would be thoroughly undesirable, and certainly no improvement on the present composition. The hereditary system, whatever its logical defects, does produce some people of independent opinions and also some who are much younger than the normal run of middle-aged legislators ... My guess is that after achieving stage one, which would involve a great deal of parliamentary time and much controversy, a Labour Cabinet would rest on its oars and postpone for many years any plans for an elective chamber. There are immense difficulties involved – its powers, electoral system, and above all relations with the Commons, which would certainly resent the creation of a body with rival claims to democratic legitimacy.Blake was a Conservative member of Oxford City Council from 1957 to 1964.

==Other activities and honours==
Blake served as a Trustee of the Rhodes Trust from 1971 to 1987, and as Chair of the Rhodes Trustees from 1983 to 1987. He was editor of the &quot;Dictionary of National Biography&quot;, a Trustee of the British Museum, and Chairman of the Royal Commission on Historical Manuscripts. He was High Bailiff and Searcher of the Sanctuary of Westminster Abbey between 1988 and 1989, and High Steward of Westminster Abbey from 1989 to 1999.

He was a Director of Channel 4 Television.

Portraits of Lord Blake hang at The Queen&#x27;s College, Oxford, and at Rhodes House, Oxford.

== Family ==
Blake married Patricia Mary Waters (1925–1995), the daughter of a Norfolk farmer, on 22 August 1953; Hugh Trevor-Roper was the best man. The couple had three daughters. One daughter, Letita, is the Secretary of the Monte San Martino Trust, which awards English-language study bursaries to young Italians in recognition of assistance offered to thousands of escaping Allied prisoners-of-war during the Second World War, whose number included Blake. Another daughter, Victoria, is a crime novelist.

<text>Robert Jackson (born December 18, 1950) is an American politician. A member of the Democratic Party, he represents District 31 in the New York State Senate. He previously served in the New York City Council from 2002 to 2013, representing the 7th district in Manhattan. He is the first Muslim New York State Senator.

==Early life and education==
Robert Jackson was born in Harlem, the son of Zelma Jackson and Chinese immigrant Eddie Chu. He grew up in Manhattan and The Bronx, attending P.S.186 in Washington Heights, and P.S. 146, Junior High School 120, and Benjamin Franklin High School in The Bronx. As a child, he sold newspapers. Jackson graduated from the State University of New York at New Paltz in 1975. After college, he worked for the New York State Department of Labor and the Public Employees Federation, a labor union. In 1986, he was elected to New York City Community School Board 6.

== Campaign for Fiscal Equity ==
In 1992, Jackson was serving as the elected president of Community School Board 6. He sued the state, frustrated and accusing the state of under-funding New York City public schools. Jackson sought assistance from the school board&#x27;s attorney, Michael A. Rebell; they founded the Campaign for Fiscal Equity, and in 1993 filed suit in CFE v. State of New York. The lawsuit argued that the State of New York&#x27;s method of allocating funds for public education did not provide adequately for children in New York City, and therefore violated the New York State Constitution and the federal Civil Rights Act.

On June 26, 2003, the New York State Court of Appeals (the state&#x27;s highest court) ruled in favor of plaintiffs, and gave the State until July 30, 2004, to implement changes. However, lawmakers could not agree on a formula. The Court of Appeals appointed a special panel to address the problem, and in 2005, the panel proposed that NY City schools receive an extra $5.6 billion per year. Justice Leland DeGrasse accepted that solution, and in 2007, the Legislature established the Foundation Aid Formula to distribute the requisite funds, phased in over a period of four years. Because of the subsequent fiscal crisis, funding was frozen during 2009–2012. Full funding has yet to be restored, a situation Jackson protested both in Albany and New York City.

==New York City Council==
Robert Jackson was elected to the New York City Council&#x27;s 7th district in 2001 as a Democrat. Before it was redistricted in 2013, the district included portions of the neighborhoods Harlem, Washington Heights and Inwood. He served parts of his three terms as Education Committee Chair and co-chair of the Black, Latino and Asian Caucus with Council Member Fernando Cabrera. Jackson was twice re-elected before being term-limited in 2013.

Jackson is Muslim, and was the only Muslim City Council member during his tenure.

==2013 Manhattan Borough President campaign==
Jackson announced in late January 2013 that he was running in the Democratic Primary for Manhattan Borough President. Jackson highlighted the Campaign for Fiscal Equity as a significant accomplishment in at least five campaigns since he initially ran, and won a seat on, the New York City Council in 2001, and his literature stated Jackson &quot;brought home billions of additional dollars each year to improve our public schools,&quot; though the Campaign for Fiscal Equity was called a failure by the Village Voice.

Jackson, who was the only male or black candidate in the race, received the endorsement of former mayor David Dinkins, New York City&#x27;s first Black mayor, prior to announcing. His opponents in the Democratic Primary were former city council members Jessica Lappin and Gale Brewer, as well as small business owner and former Chair of Community Board 1, Julie Menin. Jackson lost the Democratic Primary election to Brewer, coming in third place with 19% of the vote, compared to Brewer&#x27;s 40% and Lappin&#x27;s 25%.

==New York State Senate==
===2014 campaign===
In 2014, Jackson for ran for the New York State Senate in the 31st State Senate district against the incumbent, Adriano Espaillat. In the September 2014 Democratic primary election, he lost with roughly 43% of the vote to Espaillat&#x27;s 50%, and Luis Tejada&#x27;s 7%, in a race described by the New York Daily News as &quot;his second shot at a campaign in less than a year.&quot; Jackson&#x27;s campaign manager, Michael Oliva, said that there were no specific plans moving forward, and quoted Jackson as saying he&#x27;s &quot;not going to deal with this bullshit for another two years.&quot;

===2016 campaign===
In 2016, Espaillat ran for U.S. House of Representatives to replace retiring long-term Congressman Charlie Rangel of Harlem; Jackson ran for Espaillat&#x27;s seat in State Senate District 31 once again. In a tight primary race, Jackson came in 3rd place with 30% of the vote, losing to District Leader Marisol Alcantara, Espaillat&#x27;s chosen successor, with 33% of the vote, and Bloomberg administration alumnus Micah Lasher with 31% of the vote, while again defeating Luis Tejada with 5% of the vote.

===2018 campaign===
In 2018, Jackson ran for State Senate District 31 for the third time. In the September 2018 Democratic primary election, he won with 56% of the vote, defeating Alcantara, the incumbent, with 39% of the vote, Tirso Pina with 4% of the vote and Thomas Leon with 1% of the vote. Jackson&#x27;s victory was attributed to backlash against Alcantara, who in the State Senate had joined the Independent Democratic Conference, a group of Democratic senators who allied themselves with the Senate Republican Conference that controlled the chamber. Jackson had the support of 2016 rival Micah Lasher.

In November 2018, Jackson easily won the general election in the heavily Democratic district with 89% of the vote, becoming the first Muslim state senator. In the Senate, Jackson is serving as Chairman of Committee on Cities.

==Controversies==
===Bill Thompson heckling===
On February 1, 2013, a Democratic mayoral forum was held in Washington Heights. Elected officials repeatedly neglected to acknowledge City Councilman Robert Jackson, who represented the area. Finally, when black mayoral candidate Bill Thompson greeted State Senator A. Espaillat, Assemblywoman G. Rosa, and Councilman Y. Rodriguez, Mr. Jackson called out, &quot;I&#x27;m not part of the Northern Manhattan team? ... Can you see? Hello? Am I black enough for you, brother?&quot; Thompson responded that he had no intention of ignoring Jackson, and referred to him as a &quot;hero&quot; for his fight for NY City schools.

===Fairway Market lawsuit===
In February 2013 Jackson, and his wife Faika Jackson, sued Fairway Market and New York City. The Jacksons claimed Faika tripped over a downed stop sign in front of the Harlem location of the market in April 2010.

===Climate change banner===
Jackson and Senator Rachel May received criticism in March 2022 after attending a rally organized by NY Renews, where they posed with a sign that compared climate change to the September 11 attacks. The sign used imagery that depicted a plane flying into the World Trade Center, with &quot;climate change&quot; captioned over the plane. Jackson was captured helping hold the sign up, and reading aloud from it. Jackson apologized for the incident, stating &quot;the artwork depicted is wrong and I fully reject it.&quot;

==Personal life==
Jackson has three daughters. He met his wife, Faika Jackson, while in college. He currently lives with his family in Washington Heights.

<doc id="764342" wikidata="Q821886" url="?curid=764342" title="USS Thomas S. Gates">
<text>USS &quot;Thomas S. Gates&quot; (CG-51) was a flight-I that was used by the United States Navy. The warship was named after Thomas S. Gates, Secretary of Defense in the last years of the Eisenhower Administration (1959–1961).

In a break from normal naming conventions for the &quot;Ticonderoga&quot;-class cruisers, the &quot;Thomas S. Gates&quot; was originally the only vessel of the class to be named after a person; all of the other cruisers are named after notable events in American military history until 2023, when USS &quot;Chancellorsville&quot; was renamed .

== Construction ==
The &quot;Thomas S. Gates&quot; was laid down 31 August 1984, at Bath Iron Works, Bath, Maine, and sponsored by Anne Gates, widow of the ship&#x27;s namesake. It was launched on 14 December 1985, purchased on 22 June 1987, and commissioned on 22 August 1987, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, with Captain Robert Sutton in command.

==History==

This ship&#x27;s maiden deployment took place from 31 May 1989 to 10 November 1989. After transiting to the Mediterranean Sea as part of the battle group formed around the aircraft carrier , the &quot;Thomas S. Gates&quot; in-chopped to the Sixth Fleet on 10 June 1989; she participated in Operation National Week (10–19 June 1989), conducting turnover with the guided missile cruiser at Augusta Bay, Sicily (15 June).

After visiting Palma, Majorca (20–27 June) and Toulon, France (30 June – 15 July), where she underwent an Intermediate Maintenance Availability (IMAV), the &quot;Thomas S. Gates&quot; transited to the eastern Mediterranean (15–21 July); following a port visit to İzmir, Turkey (21–23 July), &quot;Thomas S. Gates&quot; participated in Exercise Demon Jazz 89 (24–29 July). She then visited Istanbul, Turkey (31 July – 2 August), where she embarked VADM Paul Ilg, Deputy Commander in Chief U.S. Naval Forces, Europe, and then stood into the Black Sea (3–4 August). Accompanied by the guided missile frigate , the &quot;Thomas S. Gates&quot; visited Sevastopol, USSR, from 4–8 August, and then returned to Istanbul, where she disembarked VADM Ilg (9–10 August).

Owing to the crisis in Lebanon, which had dictated that the fleet flagship, guided missile cruiser , not carry out her scheduled visit to Sevastopol, the &quot;Thomas S. Gates&quot; subsequently operated in support of the &quot;Coral Sea&quot; and battle groups off Beirut.

Returning to Toulon, the &quot;Thomas S. Gates&quot; there underwent a period of maintenance (7–13 September). After taking part in NATO Exercise Display Determination 89 (14 September- 3 October) in concert with units of the French and Turkish Navies, she conducted a period of escort operations (3–11 October) as she transited to the western Mediterranean. She then underwent a period of maintenance in Marseille, France (11–22 October) before she participated in Exercise National Week (24–31 October), during which she conducted turnover with her relief, the cruiser at Pollensa Bay, Majorca (29 October). Out-chopping to Commander, 2d Fleet, on 31 October 1989, the &quot;Thomas S. Gates&quot; then conducted her return transit to Norfolk (31 October-10 November 1989).

===Desert Shield and Desert Storm===
From 15 August 1990 to 28 March 1991, the &quot;Thomas S. Gates&quot; deployed in support of Desert Shield and Desert Storm.

With only five days of intensive preparations, she deployed as an element of the battle group under RADM Riley D. Mixson, formed around the aircraft carrier to participate in Operation Desert Shield. The group exercised at sea from 16–21 August, then began its voyage toward the Mediterranean Sea (22 August), transiting the Strait of Gibraltar on 30 August to become Task Force (TF) 60. On 1 September, the ship experienced a gas turbine casualty while transiting the western Mediterranean that compelled her to put into Augusta Bay, Sicily, for an engine changeout (3–11 September), after which time she rejoined TF-60 (13 September) off Port Said, Egypt.

The &quot;Thomas S. Gates&quot; began her maiden transit of the Suez Canal (14 September), leading the battle group on its passage through that historic waterway. Becoming part of Task Group (TG) 150.5 (15 September) upon entering the Red Sea, the guided missile cruiser rode &quot;shotgun&quot; for &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot; and operated as anti-air warfare commander (16 September – 14 October) before being detached from the carrier on 15 October. With a USCG detachment embarked, &quot;Thomas S. Gates&quot; transited the Straits of Tiran, at the mouth of the Gulf of Aqaba, and conducted maritime interdiction operations to enforce United Nations-enforced sanctions against the ingress of Iraqi goods (15–19 October); the boarding operations conducted during this time &quot;putting to good use skills developed in February in the Caribbean Sea…&quot;
the &quot;Thomas S. Gates&quot; then visited Hurghada, Egypt (20–23 October 1990), after which time she served as &quot;Gate Guard&quot; in the Gulf of Suez, screening all shipping traffic. TG 150.5 became TF-60 on 26 October, and on the 27th transited the Suez Canal.

Between 28 October and 11 December, the &quot;Thomas S. Gates&quot; operated in the central and eastern Mediterranean, evolutions punctuated by port visits to Naples (31 October – 2 November), İzmir, Turkey (7–13 November), and Haifa, Israel (16–17 November), and an IMAV alongside destroyer tender at Souda Bay, Crete (29 November – 5 December 1990). Transiting the Suez Canal on 9 December, the guided missile cruiser returned to the Red Sea, in-chopping to CTG 150.5 the following day.

The &quot;Thomas S. Gates&quot; then conducted maritime interdiction operations in the Strait of Tiran (10–14 December), completing her 37th boarding of the deployment on the latter date (14 December). Between 15 and 28 December, the ship rode shotgun for the &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot; and served as anti-air warfare commander, participating in three exercises with Royal Air Force units (20, 23, and 26 December) during that time. She put into Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, on 29 December in company with the &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot;, where Vice President Dan Quayle addressed the crews of both ships on New Year&#x27;s Day 1991. Between 3 and 16 January 1991, the &quot;Thomas S. Gates&quot; conducted Desert Shield operations in the Red Sea, punctuating that period exercising the Royal Saudi Navy in an antisubmarine warfare exercise, Operation Camelot 91 (3–7 January 1991).
Iraq&#x27;s ignoring the UN-imposed deadline (16 January) for withdrawing from Kuwait changed the complexion of events in the region; however, and Operation Desert Storm soon got underway early the following day (17 January). Over the ensuing weeks (17 January – 13 February), the &quot;Thomas S. Gates&quot;, as Red Crown (Inter Anti-Aircraft Warfare Defense Zone Coordinator) coordinated the departures and returns of air strikes from the aircraft carriers &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot;, and &quot;America&quot;, &quot;ensuring that all friendly aircraft returned safely through the air defense net while preventing any possible raid-following Iraqi aircraft getting through.&quot;

Following a visit to Hurghada (14–18 February), the &quot;Thomas S. Gates&quot; operated once more in the Red Sea (19 February – 1 March), during which time (24 February) the ground war began in Iraq and Kuwait. Following the cease-fire (28 February), the ship conducted a brief period of maritime interdiction operations in the Gulf of Aqaba. Following an in-port period at Jeddah (2–10 March), where she underwent an IMAV alongside the destroyer tender , the &quot;Thomas S. Gates&quot; transited the Suez Canal (12 March). She then conducted anti-submarine warfare exercises in the central Mediterranean (15–17 March), after which she transited the Strait of Gibraltar (18 March), headed for Norfolk, returning to her homeport on 28 March.

===1990s after the Gulf War===
This ship&#x27;s fourth major deployment was from 6 May to 6 Nov 1992. The &quot;Thomas S. Gates&quot;, with HSL-44 Detachment 9 embarked, deployed (Med 2-92) in company with guided missile cruiser and destroyer on 6 May 1992, and joined the battle group formed around the carrier &quot;Saratoga&quot; three days later. Transiting the Strait of Gibraltar on 18 May, the guided missile cruiser operated from one end of the Mediterranean to the other for almost two months, pausing at Augusta Bay (23–24 May), Naples (26–30 May), and Gaeta, Italy (4–7 June), participating in Exercise Dasix Lafayette 92-1 (9–11 June), and visiting Ibiza, Spain (13–19 June), a call enlivened by an emergency sortie from her anchorage (14 June) because of heavy seas.

Following her participation in joint-service exercise Eclipse Bravo (21–28 June), the &quot;Thomas S. Gates&quot; then visited Villefranche-sur-Mer, France (30 June – 10 July 1992, during which time she received an IMAV alongside the destroyer tender &quot;Yellowstone&quot;. She then operated in the Gulf of Lyon (11–12 July), after which she paused at Monaco (13–17 July). The guided missile cruiser participated in ASW exercises in the Strait of Bonifacio (19–20 July), before she was diverted to the Adriatic to serve as anti-air warfare commander for Commander TF 61 in support of Operation Provide Promise (23 July-2 September), monitoring the safety of relief flights into beleaguered Sarajevo. During that time, she took part in missile-firing exercises in the Ionian Sea (27 August).

At the conclusion of those operations, she employed her embarked SH-60B Seahawk helicopters in search and rescue efforts in the wake of the crash of an Italian relief aircraft in the former region of Yugoslavia (3 September). Following a visit to Trieste, Italy (4–13 September), &quot;Thomas S. Gates&quot; then operated in the Adriatic and Ionian Seas (14–24 September), before pausing briefly for a port visit to Aksaz Karagac, Turkey on 25 September 1992.
The guided missile cruiser then took part in a multi-phase NATO exercise, Display Determination 92. The exercise was marred by tragedy when live missiles hit the Turkish destroyer , formerly the light minelayer , on 2 October 1992. The &quot;Thomas S. Gates&quot; provided a damage control boarding team, communications assistance, and directed her fire hoses on the flames on board the Turkish warship from 20 yards away; ten of the guided missile cruiser&#x27;s crew received decorations for the valor they displayed during the incident. The exercises began anew the next day at the request of the Turkish government.

Subsequently, the &quot;Thomas S. Gates&quot; hosted dignitaries (Lieutenant General Mihov, Bulgarian Chief of Staff, on 4 October, and His Royal Highness Prince Philippe of Belgium on 6 October). Detached from Display Determination 92, the guided missile cruiser proceeded to Naples for a three-day port visit (8–11 October), then participated in Exercise Dasix Lafayette 92-2 (14–15 October), after which time she returned to the Adriatic and Ionian Seas (16–17 October), reprised her visit to Trieste (18–20 October), and operated once more in the Adriatic, turning over her duty as AAW commander to the cruiser in those waters on 22 October, in the &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot; battle group, and then headed for home. Transiting the Strait of Gibraltar on 25 October and detached from the &quot;Saratoga&quot; battle group on 4 November, &quot;Thomas S. Gates&quot; stood in to Norfolk on 6 November.
This ship&#x27;s sixth major deployment took place from 20 May 1994 to 17 Nov 1994. Underway in company with the Battle Group, the &quot;Thomas S. Gates&quot; with HSL-44 Detachment 9 (&quot;Magnum 453&quot;) embarked, sailed to Great Britain to take part in ceremonies for the 50th anniversary of the D-Day landings in Normandy. On 5 June 1994, she anchored off Pointe du Hoc along with a dozen other NATO warships as a backdrop for the ceremonies and put into Le Havre on the 6th to allow veterans to tour the ship.

Underway on 9 June, the cruiser sailed south to the Adriatic Sea (arriving there on the 20th via Gibraltar) for duty as &quot;Red Crown&quot; (AAW defense warship) in support of Operations Sharp Guard, Deny Flight and Provide Promise. An engine failure on the 24th sent the cruiser to Augusta Bay for repairs, where she remained until 5 July 1994. The warship then sailed east to Haifa, Israel, for a port visit (10–12 July) before returning to the Adriatic on the 16th.

After turning over duties on 27 July, the cruiser proceeded to the south of France for festivities celebrating the 50th anniversary of the amphibious landings at Théoule-sur-Mer (10–16 August 1994). Following a short repair period at Naples from 16–23 August 1994, the Thomas S. Gates quickly steamed to the Suez Canal, transited the Red Sea and proceeded on to the Northern Persian Gulf. Once there, she provided AAW coverage for Operation Southern Watch from 27 August to 21 September 1994, the Allied flights over Iraq designed to protect local Shia Arabs from attacks by Saddam Hussein&#x27;s Baathist regime. Back in the Mediterranean on 29 September 1994, she participated in NATO Exercise Dynamic Guard 94 (2–12 October) and conducted additional &quot;Red Crown&quot; ops in the Adriatic (17–31 October) before sailing for home, arriving in Norfolk on 17 November 1994.

This ship&#x27;s ninth major deployment took place from 29 April 1997 to 27 October 1997. Departing Norfolk on 29 April 1997, with HSL-48, Detachment 1 (&quot;Venom 500&quot;) embarked, the guided missile cruiser sailed across the Atlantic and in-chopped to the 6th Fleet on 11 May, the same day she relieved guided missile destroyer as anti-air warfare commander. Following the week-long Exercise Linked Seas (11–18 May), she pulled into Palma de Mallorca, Spain, for a five-day port visit. Underway 26 May, the cruiser sailed to Barcelona, arriving there 3 June after conducting a burial at sea with the remains of three World War II veterans. The warship then shifted north on 9 June, arriving at Cannes, France, on 16 June after flying off &quot;Venom 500&quot; on the 13 June to participate in the Paris Air Show.

The &quot;Thomas S. Gates&quot; then sailed to La Maddalena, Italy, for a short maintenance period (24–29 June) alongside submarine tender . Following Exercise INVITEX 97 (30 June – 18 July) in the Tyrrhenean Sea, and a short visit to Naples (18–25 July), the cruiser steamed east for a diplomatic visit to Constanța, Romania, arriving there via Corfu, Greece, on 11 August. The cruiser hosted a press conference on 14 August, as well as a reception for over 200 guests—including Rear Admiral Traian Atanasiu, Romanian Chief of the General Staff—before getting underway for joint Exercise Rescue Eagle 97 (17–18 August 1997) in the Black Sea.

The warship then sailed west, arriving in Rota, Spain, on 7 September after stops in Istanbul, Turkey and Livorno, Italy. The cruiser then participated in joint Exercise Strong Tarpon (14–21 September) in the eastern Atlantic before conducting return port visits to Palma de Mallorca, Barcelona and Cannes. After &quot;Thomas S. Gates&quot; put into Gibraltar on 10 October, she turned over with guided missile cruiser on 16 October before sailing to Bermuda, arriving there 25 October 1997. That same day, just after embarking crew relatives for a Tiger cruise home, the cruiser responded to a distress call, recovering two crewmen from the drifting sailboat &quot;Glou Glou&quot;. &quot;Thomas S. Gates&quot; arrived home at Norfolk on 27 October 1997.

On 25 September 1999, the &quot;Thomas S. Gates&quot; responded to a call for assistance from the United States Coast Guard vessel , then in the process of conducting boarding operations of the suspect merchant vessel &quot;Love&quot;. After an attempt by the &quot;Love&quot;″s crew to scuttle their ship, the cruiser sent a damage control team to try to keep the merchant vessel seaworthy, but those efforts failed after repeated attempts to stop the flooding. The cruiser then sank the awash vessel with 5-inch gunfire as it was as a hazard to navigation.

===2000s===

&quot;Thomas S. Gates&quot; departed Pascagoula on 3 June 2002, with HSL 42, Detachment 9 (&quot;Proud Warrior&quot;) embarked, transited the Panama Canal on 7 June 2002 to conduct counter-drug ops in the eastern Pacific. During a three-month deployment, the cruiser conducted six patrols out of Rodman, Panama, during which she made two major drug seizures (4.5 tons of cocaine) from &quot;Go-Fast&quot; speedboats off El Salvador. The warship also conducted a special forces exercise called Trident Warrior and a submarine tracking and gunnery exercise with the Peruvian Navy.

In March 2003, &quot;Thomas S. Gates&quot; was homeported at Pascagoula and was assigned to Destroyer Squadron 6.

On 21 March 2004, &quot;Thomas S. Gates&quot; rendezvoused with cruise ship &quot;Celebrity Summit&quot;, of Royal Caribbean International Cruise Lines, in the central Caribbean. The cruiser&#x27;s embarked USCG Enforcement Detachment boarding team, with the cooperation of the cruise ship&#x27;s captain and security force, apprehended Jose Miguel Battle, Jr. the suspected leader of The Corporation, an organized crime outfit. &quot;Thomas S. Gates&quot; also provided an escort for the aircraft carrier through the Strait of Magellan. Due to poor weather in the Pacific, &quot;Thomas S. Gates&quot; exited the strait via the Smyth Channel and conducted a 36-hour transit through restricted maneuvering waters. &quot;Thomas S. Gates&quot; was the first &quot;Ticonderoga&quot;-class cruiser to make that transit. The cruiser returned to home port on 2 August 2004.

==Fate==
Due to Hurricane Katrina, her last deployment was cut short. The crew was given leave to take care of their families and other personal business. The Navy decommissioned &quot;Thomas S. Gates&quot; on 15 December 2005, four months earlier than the planned March 2006 date, and after serving only 18 years in the active fleet. She was stricken the same date and was berthed at the Naval Inactive Ship Maintenance Facility in Philadelphia, PA as of 2014. As of 2008, she was slated to be dismantled in the next five years along with her sisters and . As of July 2014, NAVSEA planned to place ex-&quot;Thomas S. Gates&quot; and ex-&quot;Ticonderoga&quot; up for bid to scrappers via the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA). DLA awarded a contract to scrap ex-&quot;Thomas S. Gates&quot; to ESCO Marine, 15 December 2014. She was towed to New Orleans, LA., for scrapping in July 2017.

The Naval Vessel Register lists the ships decommissioning and strike date as 16 December 2006. DANFS lists the decommissioning date as 15 December 2005. There is also a pamphlet entitled &quot;USS Thomas S. Gates (CG 51) decommissioning ceremony, 14 December 2005 Naval Station Mayport&quot; OCLC 156786375 listed on Worldcat. The Times-Union of Jacksonville, Florida noted that &quot;USS Gates&quot; (sic) was to decommission today, 14 December 2005.

==Ship insignia==

&quot;Thomas S. Gates&quot;″s insignia reflects the government service of the man honored in the name of the ship. The upper section of the crest represents Gates&#x27;s World War II service in various aircraft carriers (large, small, and escort); the deep blue represents the Pacific Ocean; the gold U.S. Navy tradition. The heraldic rayonne division of scarlet and gold symbolizes the severity of Japanese kamikaze attacks that descended upon aircraft carriers during the Lingayen, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa campaigns, in which Gates participated. The anchor and stars, adapted from the Secretary of the Navy&#x27;s flag, refer to Gates&#x27;s tenure as Undersecretary of the Navy and Secretary of the Navy. The three arrows, which appear on the flag of the Secretary of Defense, reflect his tours as Deputy Undersecretary of Defense and Secretary of Defense.

On the crest, the eagle, symbolic of power and authority, along with the ship&#x27;s wheel, allude to the strong leadership provided by Gates during a period of technological change (guns to missiles, conventional to nuclear power, piston engines to jets, and the beginning of space exploration) while at the helm of the Defense Department. The alternating colors of the wheel symbolize that era of change. The blue stars represent the United States, the red, China; the gold rays from the Presidential seal emphasize the significance of Gates&#x27;s appointment, by President Gerald R. Ford, to head the U.S. Liaison Office to the People&#x27;s Republic of China, and reflect Gates&#x27;s contributions to the United States in that role, his last as a public servant.

<text>Vapor Transmission is the second album by American Industrial rock band Orgy. It was released on October 10, 2000.

The first 1000 pressings (as well as the Japanese release) of the album included a bonus track known as &quot;The Spectrum&quot;, which starts at the 6 minute mark of the last track &quot;Where&#x27;s Gerrold&quot;.
Some packages of this album included an enhanced CD that contained a demo version of the song &quot;Stitches,&quot; a remix, and a video for the single &quot;Fiction (Dreams in Digital)&quot;. The aforementioned single received significant radio play upon release, reaching number 6 on the Hot Modern Rock Tracks chart. A second single, &quot;Opticon&quot;, had more moderate success, and was featured on the soundtrack to the 2001 horror film &quot;Valentine&quot;. According to vocalist Jay Gordon, the song contains a drum sample from &quot;The Stroke&quot; by Billy Squier. &quot;Suckerface&quot; and &quot;Eva&quot; were also released as promotional singles.

&quot;Vapor Transmission&quot; largely continues the style heard on &quot;Candyass&quot;. However, while the electronic effects remain prominent, heavily distorted guitars are slightly de-emphasized with a strong focus on melody.

<doc id="764348" wikidata="Q184812" url="?curid=764348" title="Zeigarnik effect">
<text>In psychology, the Zeigarnik effect, named after Lithuanian-Soviet psychologist Bluma Zeigarnik, occurs when an activity that has been interrupted may be more readily recalled. It postulates that people remember unfinished or interrupted tasks better than completed tasks. In Gestalt psychology, the Zeigarnik effect has been used to demonstrate the general presence of Gestalt phenomena: not just appearing as perceptual effects, but also present in cognition.

The Zeigarnik effect should not be confused with the Ovsiankina effect. Maria Ovsiankina, a colleague of Zeigarnik, investigated the effect of task interruption on the tendency to resume the task at the next opportunity.

==Overview==
Lithuanian-Soviet psychologist Bluma Zeigarnik first studied the phenomenon after professor and Gestalt psychologist Kurt Lewin noticed that a waiter had better recollections of still unpaid orders. However, after the completion of the task — after everyone had paid — the waiter was unable to remember any more details of the orders. Zeigarnik then designed a series of experiments to uncover the processes underlying the phenomenon. The research report was published in 1927, in the journal &quot;Psychologische Forschung.&quot;

The advantage of remembrance can be explained by looking at Lewin&#x27;s field theory: a task that has already been started establishes a task-specific tension, which improves cognitive accessibility of the relevant contents. The tension is relieved upon completion of the task, but persists if it is interrupted. Through continuous tension, the content is made more easily accessible, and can be easily remembered.

The Zeigarnik effect suggests that students who suspend their study to perform unrelated activities (such as studying a different subject or playing a game), will remember material better than students who complete study sessions without a break (McKinney 1935; Zeigarnik 1927).

==Harden rule==
Sportswriter Matt Moore has suggested that the Zeigarnik effect could explain the widespread criticism of the National Basketball Association in allowing free throws for a player &quot;chucking it up whenever a guy comes near them&quot;. There is a stoppage of play with each foul. When repeatedly done, it is felt to build up a cognitive bias against this move. The criticism necessitated a rule change penalizing this activity, known as the Harden Rule, named after its most prominent user, James Harden.

==Criticism==
The reliability of the effect has been a matter of some controversy.

Several studies, performed later in other countries, attempting to replicate Zeigarnik&#x27;s experiment, failed to find any significant differences in recall between &quot;finished&quot; and &quot;unfinished&quot; (interrupted) tasks, for example Van Bergen (1968).

==Usages==

=== Software ===
The Zeigarnik effect is used in some SaaS (Software as a service) systems to onboard users faster and effectively.

Usually, it is implemented as user interactions gamification. Examples include:

* Progress trackers which inform users of how close they are to complete a task. For example, when users see a message like &quot;Your profile is 64% complete&quot;, they are more likely to spend a few minutes on providing all missing details.
* Checklists to provide a clear step-by-step on-boarding flow.

<text>USS &quot;Mobile Bay&quot; (CG-53) was a &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; class guided-missile cruiser that served in the United States Navy from 1987 to 2023. She is named for the naval Battle of Mobile Bay during the American Civil War in 1864.

==Design and construction==
The ship was ordered from Ingalls Shipbuilding on 15 January 1982. She was laid down on 6 June 1984, launched on 22 August 1985, and commissioned on 21 February 1987 at the Alabama State Docks in Mobile, Alabama. She was decommissioned August 10, 2023.

With guided missiles and rapid-fire cannons, &quot;Mobile Bay&quot; was capable of defeating threats in the air, on the sea, on shore, and undersea. She carries the Tomahawk Land Attack Missile which played an integral part in the strikes on Iraqi targets during the opening stages of Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2003. She also carries two Seahawk LAMPS multi-purpose helicopters, mainly for anti-submarine warfare (ASW). The ship was capable of conducting Maritime Interdiction Operations, and carried a fully trained boarding team.

==Operational history==
After commissioning, &quot;Mobile Bay&quot; joined the U.S. Atlantic Fleet, arriving at Mayport, Florida, her homeport in March 1987. Following a year of crew qualifications, tests and systems trials, &quot;Mobile Bay&quot; embarked on her maiden deployment on 11 May 1989. During this cruise, &quot;Mobile Bay&quot; earned her first two awards: the Sea Service Deployment Ribbon and the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal, for operations conducted in the Gulf of Oman.

In June 1990, &quot;Mobile Bay&quot; shifted homeports from Mayport to Yokosuka, Japan. Shortly thereafter, she deployed in August 1990 in support of Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm, becoming the first AEGIS cruiser to circumnavigate the globe. In the Persian Gulf, the ship distinguished herself by becoming the first Battle Force Anti-Air Warfare Commander to control a four-carrier Task Force. &quot;Mobile Bay&quot; launched 22 Tomahawk land-attack cruise missile strikes, and performed as the Battle Force Anti-Surface Warfare Commander targeting Iraqi naval vessels and directing carrier-launched attack aircraft to destroy 38 Iraqi naval vessels resulting in the complete neutralization of the Iraqi Navy. Helicopter Anti-Submarine Squadron Light 43 (HSL-43) Detachment 2B was assigned with two SH-60B Seahawk helicopters aboard.

In February 1991, the Tactical Information Coordinator (TIC) aboard &quot;Mobile Bay&quot;, reported SPY-1 Radar acquisitions of what appeared to be SCUD missile launches that were detected over Saudi Arabia. These tracks were reported over Data Systems Administration (DSA) and Anti-Air Warfare Coordination and Reporting (AAWC&amp;R) voice networks and were confirmed to be valid targets by Patriot Batteries who engaged these SCUDs.

In May 1991, &quot;Mobile Bay&quot; was ordered to Subic Bay, Republic of the Philippines, to participate in Operation Fiery Vigil, the evacuation of thousands of people displaced by the volcanic eruption of Mount Pinatubo. In December 1991, &quot;Mobile Bay&quot; began work-ups for a spring 1992 Persian Gulf deployment.

On 15 April 1992, &quot;Mobile Bay&quot; once again set sail for the Persian Gulf. En route, the ship and crew visited Sydney, Australia, to represent the U. S. Navy at the 50th Anniversary celebration of the Battle of Coral Sea. Sailing through the Straits of Hormuz in late May 1992, the ship began duties as the Persian Gulf Anti-Air Warfare Commander. &quot;Mobile Bay&quot; also played a vital role in Operation Southern Watch, the enforcement of the U. N.-mandated &quot;No Fly Zone&quot; over Southern Iraq. Returning to Japan in October, &quot;Mobile Bay&quot; participated in ANNUALEX-92, a major naval exercise involving units of the U. S. Navy and the Japanese Maritime Self Defense Force. &quot;Mobile Bay&quot; served as the Anti-Air Warfare Commander for a joint U. S. - Japanese flotilla.

After participating in &quot;SPRING TRAINING-93&quot; off the coast of Australia, she made an historic visit to the Russian seaport of Vladivostok in September 1993. Accompanying her was the .

&quot;Mobile Bay&quot; was deployed to East Timor as part of the Australian-led INTERFET peacekeeping taskforce from 20 September to 5 October 1999. As the most capable air defense vessel available, the ship was placed in charge of air defence, although the U.S. requests for screening &quot;Mobile Bay&quot; necessitated a considerable degree of effort by other ships of the force.

In March 2003 &quot;Mobile Bay&quot; was assigned to Cruiser-Destroyer Group 5.

&quot;Mobile Bay&quot; operated in support of the 2003 invasion of Iraq from 17 June to 17 December 2004. The ship was later awarded the Iraq Campaign Medal.

In 2006, the cruiser was deployed to the Western Pacific, where she served as the Air Defense Commander for the Carrier Strike Group.

On 16 February 2007, &quot;Mobile Bay&quot; was awarded the 2006 Battle &quot;E&quot; award. The ship completed a 10-month overhaul in early 2010.

On 8 April 2011, the ship was given a failing grade of &quot;unsatisfactory&quot; in her INSURV inspection, mainly for problems with the ship&#x27;s propulsion, operations, aviation, and communications. A remedial inspection was scheduled and passed in June 2011.
The ship returned from back to back deployments (2011 and 2012) as the Air Defense Commander for John C Stennis Strike Group. She was awarded the 2012 Battle E and Spokane Award for her service.

In December 2020 the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Report to Congress on the Annual Long-Range Plan for Construction of Naval Vessels stated that the ship was planned to be placed Out of Commission in Reserve in 2023.

On 9 May 2022, &quot;Mobile Bay&quot; transited the Philippine Sea and she steamed into Tokyo Bay on 22 May 2022 as a part of Carrier Strike Group 3 with . &quot;Mobile Bay&quot; also participated in RIMPAC 2022 in that year.

On 10 August 2023, &quot;Mobile Bay&quot; was decommissioned at a ceremony at Naval Base San Diego after over 36 years of service.

<text>Punk Statik Paranoia is the third album by the industrial metal band Orgy. It was released on February 24, 2004, their first independent recording.

The album&#x27;s style is a departure from the electronic rock sound that was present in &quot;Candyass&quot; and &quot;Vapor Transmission&quot;, leaning more to an aggressive nu metal sound similar to bands like Korn and Linkin Park. It is also the first Orgy album to feature occasional screaming vocals.

There are four different versions of the album, the final release in 2004 and an advance version used for promotion dated to 2003, each of which have an explicit and clean variant. The advance versions are missing some elements that were added before the final release. All versions feature the same track list.

==Sales and chart performance==
&quot;Punk Statik Paranoia&quot; debuted at #11 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Independent Albums chart. The album sold 5,353 copies during its first week of release.

<text>Robert Earl Jackson (born 1949) is a scientist, who, with Sandra M. Faber, in 1976 discovered the Faber–Jackson relation between the luminosity of an elliptical galaxy and the velocity dispersion in its center.

Jackson was a graduate student at the University of California at Santa Cruz. As a research assistant for Faber, he contributed to the data analysis on the project that led to the Faber–Jackson relation (1976). Jackson received his Ph.D. in 1982 with the thesis titled &quot;The Anisotropy of the Hubble Constant&quot;.

From 1984 to 1999, he worked for Computer Sciences Corporation at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, Maryland.

<text>USS &quot;Leyte Gulf&quot; (CG-55) is a guided missile cruiser in the United States Navy. She was named in memory of the World War II Battle of Leyte Gulf in the Pacific. She is powered by four large gas-turbine engines, and she has a large complement of guided missiles for air defense, attack of surface targets at sea and ashore, and anti-submarine warfare (ASW). In addition, she carries two &quot;Seahawk&quot; LAMPS multi-purpose helicopters, whose primary mission is ASW.

&quot;Leyte Gulf&quot; was laid down by the Litton-Ingalls Shipbuilding Corporation at Pascagoula, Mississippi, on 18 March 1985, launched on 20 June 1986, and commissioned on 26 September 1987 at Port Everglades, Florida.

&quot;Leyte Gulf&quot; was decommissioned on 20 September 2024 at Naval Station Norfolk, Virginia.

==History==
On 14 October 1996, &quot;Leyte Gulf&quot; collided with the , while conducting operations off the coast of North Carolina. The incident occurred as the carrier, without prior warning, reversed her engines while &quot;Leyte Gulf&quot; was behind her and slammed into the cruiser&#x27;s bow. There were no personnel casualties or injuries reported, and damage to the Leyte was only $2 million.

In 2002, she won the Marjorie Sterrett Battleship Fund Award for the Atlantic Fleet.

In late 1992 &quot;Leyte Gulf&quot; was assigned to Carrier Group 2. In March 2003 &quot;Leyte Gulf&quot; was assigned to Carrier Group Eight.
On 15 September 2007, there was a fire aboard &quot;Leyte Gulf&quot; as she underwent an extensive modernization program in BAE Systems Shipyard in Norfolk, Virginia. Initially the fire received national attention due to the possibility that it was a terrorist incident, however, it was quickly revealed to be an industrial accident. Five shipyard workers were injured in the incident, one seriously, but no naval personnel were involved.

In February 2011, &quot;Leyte Gulf&quot; was involved in an incident with Somali pirates after they captured the United States flagged yacht &quot;Quest&quot;.

The cruiser returned to Norfolk on 15 July 2011. During her deployment, she had participated in operations which had captured 75 Somali pirates and had missile strikes by her carrier strike group against the Libyan government.

In January 2015, &quot;Leyte Gulf&quot; returned from a six-month deployment to the Mediterranean Sea. The ship served as flagship of Standing NATO Maritime Group 2 for much of the deployment.

In August 2022 &quot;Leyte Gulf&quot; was again deployed to the Mediterranean Sea. She returned to Norfolk on 9 June 2023.

On 29 January 2024, &quot;Leyte Gulf&quot; deployed Sunday from Naval Station Norfolk, Va., to the 4th Fleet area of operations, which includes the Caribbean and Central and South America. It will host HSM-50, Helicopter Maritime Strike Squadron 50 and Coast Guard Law Enforcement Detachment 404 and is expected to conduct passing exercises with regional partners and make port visits to counter threats such as illegal drug trafficking. She returned to Naval Station Norfolk on 17 May 2024. This will be her final deployment before decommissioning.

In March 2024, the Navy announced plans to inactivate &quot;Leyte Gulf&quot; on 20 September 2024.

On March 21, 2024, the &quot;Leyte Gulf&quot; and the US Coast Guard captured a narco-submarine 150 miles off the coast of Guyana carrying 5,225 pounds of cocaine.

On September 20, 2024 at Naval Station Norfolk, USS &quot;Leyte Gulf&quot; (CG-55) was decommissioned with Commanding Officer Commander Brian Harrington and Command Master Chief Michael Jedrykowski presiding.

<text>The Wallooskee River (also known as the Walluski River) is a tributary of the Youngs River, about long, in northwest Oregon in the United States. It drains a small area of the foothills of the Coast Range near the mouth of the Columbia River. The Youngs River is a tributary of the Columbia River.

It rises southwest of Astoria in a northern Clatsop County at . It flows generally west in a winding course. About a mile (1.6 km) before its mouth, it receives the Little Wallooskee River from the right at which flows about from its source at .
The Wallooskee enters Youngs River from the east at the south end of Youngs Bay, approximately south of Astoria.

==Walluski==
The name of the river was formerly spelled &quot;Walluski&quot; but the Board on Geographic Names changed it to &quot;Wallooskee&quot; in 1975. Although there is not a formal settlement by the name of Walluski, Oregon, the Olney-Walluski area is considered a community by local residents and the Walluski area was a census precinct as recently as 1950. As of 1892, there was a Walluski School. The school was located near Oregon State University&#x27;s John Jacob Astor Agricultural Experiment Station, that was later used as the Clatsop Community College farm and today is the site of the Clatsop County Fairgrounds.

There is also a Walluski soil series named for the area.

<doc id="764374" wikidata="Q1780531" url="?curid=764374" title="USS San Jacinto (CG-56)">
<text>USS &quot;San Jacinto&quot; (CG-56) was a in the United States Navy. She is named for the Battle of San Jacinto, the decisive battle of the Texas Revolution.

==Construction==
&quot;San Jacinto&quot; was laid down on 24 July 1985, by Ingalls Shipbuilding, in Pascagoula, Mississippi. She was launched on 11 November 1986, and commissioned 23 January 1988, by then vice-president George H. W. Bush in Houston, Texas.

== Service history ==
She completed her fitting out and work-ups, then deployed to the Mediterranean Sea in late May 1989, returning in November. While &quot;San Jacinto&quot; and her sister ship were underway off the Virginia coast, performing testing of CEC, the Iraqi army invaded and occupied Kuwait. The next day, &quot;Leyte Gulf&quot; detached and headed back to Mayport, Florida. The day after, &quot;San Jacinto&quot; returned to her homeport of Norfolk, Virginia, to prepare for the massive armada to the Middle East.

After CINCLANT had all their ships provisioned, barely five days later, &quot;San Jacinto&quot; headed for the Mediterranean. Other ships in the battle group included the cruiser and the aircraft carriers and .

She fired the opening shots of Operation Desert Storm with the launch of two BGM-109 Tomahawk cruise missiles, firing a total of 16 missiles during the 43-day war. She was also the first ship of her class to be deployed with a full load of 122 missiles. While stationed in a search area at the southern tip of the Sinai Peninsula in the Red Sea, her Visit, Boarding, Search &amp; Seizure (VBSS) teams inspected several dozen ships for contraband being smuggled for the Iraqi government.

During her 2000-2001 deployment with Carrier Group Two, she deployed with Helicopter Antisubmarine Squadron Light 42 (HSL-42) Det 8 with two SH-60B Seahawks.

On 26 May 2010, &quot;San Jacinto&quot;″s VBSS team rescued five Yemenis hostages from 13 suspected pirates. The master stated his dhow had been under pirate control for one day only. The VBSS team detained the pirates on the dhow without conflict.

On 13 October 2012, &quot;San Jacinto&quot; was involved in a collision with U.S. nuclear submarine off the coast of northeastern Florida. The cruiser suffered damage to her sonar dome. Due to the emergency dry docking, &quot;San Jacinto&quot; was unable to join Carrier Strike Group Ten and aircraft carrier deployment to the Persian Gulf. The cruiser has undergone approximately $11 million in repairs since the accident.

In 2020, &quot;San Jacinto&quot; and , while on deployment together, became the first U.S. Navy ships to exceed 160 consecutive days at sea. Later in 2020, &quot;San Jacinto&quot; was deployed to Cape Verde as a deterrent to any attempts to aid Venezuelan diplomat Alex Saab in fleeing the island prior to being extradicted to the U.S. on money-laundering charges.

In December 2020 the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Report to Congress on the Annual Long-Range Plan for Construction of Naval Vessels stated their intention to decommission the ship in Fiscal Year 2022. The Navy formally asked Congress for permission to decommission the ship in the FY2022 budget in July 2021 along with six other cruisers, but Congress only allowed the Navy to retire five cruisers, and the Navy chose to retain &quot;San Jacinto&quot;. The Navy again asked Congress for permission to retire the ship in the 2023 budget request, and as of June 2022 the budget is still being debated.

On 6 May 2022, &quot;San Jacinto&quot; conducted an underway replenishment (UNREP) with . &quot;San Jacinto&quot; was a part of Carrier Strike Group 8 led by the in the Mediterranean Sea.

&quot;San Jacinto&quot; was decommissioned on 15 September 2023 in a ceremony at her homeport Naval Station Norfolk. &quot;San Jacinto&quot; will be inactivated and towed to the Navy’s Inactive Ship Maintenance Facility in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania where they will be in a Logistic Support Asset (LSA) status.

<doc id="764380" wikidata="Q829504" url="?curid=764380" title="Sound reinforcement system">
<text>A sound reinforcement system is the combination of microphones, signal processors, amplifiers, and loudspeakers in enclosures all controlled by a mixing console that makes live or pre-recorded sounds louder and may also distribute those sounds to a larger or more distant audience. In many situations, a sound reinforcement system is also used to enhance or alter the sound of the sources on the stage, typically by using electronic effects, such as reverb, as opposed to simply amplifying the sources unaltered.

A sound reinforcement system for a rock concert in a stadium may be very complex, including hundreds of microphones, complex live sound mixing and signal processing systems, tens of thousands of watts of amplifier power, and multiple loudspeaker arrays, all overseen by a team of audio engineers and technicians. On the other hand, a sound reinforcement system can be as simple as a small public address (PA) system, consisting of, for example, a single microphone connected to a 100-watt amplified loudspeaker for a singer-guitarist playing in a small coffeehouse. In both cases, these systems &quot;reinforce&quot; sound to make it louder or distribute it to a wider audience.

Some audio engineers and others in the professional audio industry disagree over whether these audio systems should be called sound reinforcement (SR) systems or PA systems. Distinguishing between the two terms by technology and capability is common, while others distinguish by intended use (e.g., SR systems are for live event support and PA systems are for reproduction of speech and recorded music in buildings and institutions). In some regions or markets, the distinction between the two terms is important, though the terms are considered interchangeable in many professional circles.

==Basic concept==
A typical sound reinforcement system consists of; input transducers (e.g., microphones), which convert sound energy such as a person singing into an electric signal, signal processors which alter the signal characteristics (e.g., equalizers that adjust the bass and treble, compressors that reduce signal peaks, etc.), amplifiers, which produce a powerful version of the resulting signal that can drive a loudspeaker and output transducers (e.g., loudspeakers in speaker cabinets), which convert the signal back into sound energy (the sound heard by the audience and the performers). These primary parts involve varying numbers of individual components to achieve the desired goal of reinforcing and clarifying the sound to the audience, performers, or other individuals.

===Signal path===
Sound reinforcement in a large format system typically involves a signal path that starts with the signal inputs, which may be instrument pickups (on an electric guitar or electric bass) or a microphone that a vocalist is singing into or a microphone placed in front of an instrument or guitar amplifier. These signal inputs are plugged into the input jacks of a thick multicore cable (often called a &quot;snake&quot;). The snake then delivers the signals of all of the inputs to one or more mixing consoles.

In a coffeehouse or small nightclub, the snake may be only routed to a single mixing console, which an audio engineer will use to adjust the sound and volume of the onstage vocals and instruments that the audience hears through the main speakers and adjust the volume of the monitor speakers that are aimed at the performers.

Mid- to large-size performing venues typically route the onstage signals to two mixing consoles: the front of house (FOH), and the stage monitor system, which is often a second mixer at the side of the stage. In these cases, at least two audio engineers are required; one to do the main mix for the audience at FOH and another to do the monitor mix for the performers on stage.

Once the signal arrives at an input on a mixing console, this signal can be adjusted in many ways by the sound engineer. A signal can be equalized (e.g., by adjusting the bass or treble of the sound), compressed (to avoid unwanted signal peaks), or panned (that is sent to the left or right speakers). The signal may also be routed into an external effects processor, such as a reverb effect, which outputs a &quot;wet&quot; (effected) version of the signal, which is typically mixed in varying amounts with the &quot;dry&quot; (effect-free) signal. Many electronic effects units are used in sound reinforcement systems, including digital delay and reverb. Some concerts use pitch correction effects (e.g., AutoTune), which electronically correct any out-of-tune singing.

Mixing consoles also have additional &quot;sends&quot;, also referred to as &quot;auxes&quot; or &quot;aux sends&quot; (an abbreviation for &quot;auxiliary send&quot;), on each input channel so that a different mix can be created and sent elsewhere for another purpose. One usage for aux sends is to create a mix of the vocal and instrument signals for the monitor mix (this is what the onstage singers and musicians hear from their monitor speakers or in-ear monitors). Another use of an aux send is to select varying amounts of certain channels (via the aux send knobs on each channel), and then route these signals to an effects processor. A common example of the second use of aux sends is to send all of the vocal signals from a rock band through a reverb effect. While reverb is usually added to vocals in the main mix, it is not usually added to electric bass and other rhythm section instruments.

The processed input signals are then mixed to the master faders on the console. The next step in the signal path generally depends on the size of the system in place. In smaller systems, the main outputs are often sent to an additional equalizer, or directly to a power amplifier, with one or more loudspeakers (typically two, one on each side of the stage in smaller venues, or a large number in big venues) that are connected to that amplifier. In large-format systems, the signal is typically first routed through an equalizer then to a crossover. A crossover splits the signal into multiple frequency bands with each band being sent to separate amplifiers and speaker enclosures for low, middle, and high-frequency signals. Low-frequency signals are sent to amplifiers and then to subwoofers, and middle and high-frequency sounds are typically sent to amplifiers which power full-range speaker cabinets. Using a crossover to separate the sound into low, middle and high frequencies can lead to a &quot;cleaner&quot;, clearer sound (see bi-amplification) than routing all of the frequencies through a single full-range speaker system. Nevertheless, many small venues still use a single full-range speaker system, as it is easier to set up and less expensive.

==System components==

===Input transducers===

Many types of input transducers can be found in a sound reinforcement system, with microphones being the most commonly used input device. Microphones can be classified according to their method of transduction, polar pattern or their functional application. Most microphones used in sound reinforcement are either dynamic or condenser microphones. One type of directional microphone, called &quot;cardioid&quot; mics, are widely used in live sound, because they reduce pickup from the side and rear, helping to avoid unwanted feedback from the stage monitor system.

Microphones used for sound reinforcement are positioned and mounted in many ways, including base-weighted upright stands, podium mounts, tie-clips, instrument mounts, and headset mounts. Microphones on stands are also placed in front of instrument amplifiers to pick up the sound. Headset-mounted and tie-clip-mounted microphones are often used with wireless transmission to allow performers or speakers to move freely. Early adopters of headset mounted microphones technology included country singer Garth Brooks, Kate Bush, and Madonna.

Other types of input transducers include magnetic pickups used in electric guitars and electric basses, contact microphones used on stringed instruments, and pianos and phonograph pickups (cartridges) used in record players. Electronic instruments such as synthesizers can have their output signal routed directly to the mixing console. A DI unit may be necessary to adapt some of these sources to the inputs of the console.

===Wireless===
Wireless systems are typically used for electric guitar, bass, handheld microphones and in-ear monitor systems. This lets performers move about the stage during the show or even go out into the audience without the worry of tripping over or disconnecting cables.

===Mixing consoles===
Mixing consoles are the heart of a sound reinforcement system. This is where the sound engineer can adjust the volume and tone of each input, whether it is a vocalist&#x27;s microphone or the signal from an electric bass, and mix, equalize and add effects to these sound sources. Doing the mixing for a live show requires a mix of technical and artistic skills. A sound engineer needs to have an expert knowledge of speaker and amplifier set-up, effects units and other technologies and a good &quot;ear&quot; for what the music should sound like in order to create a good mix.

Multiple consoles can be used for different purposes in a single sound reinforcement system. The front-of-house (FOH) mixing console is typically located where the operator can see the action on stage and hear what the audience hears. For broadcast and recording applications, the mixing console may be placed within an enclosed booth or outside in an OB van. Large music productions often use a separate stage monitor mixing console which is dedicated to creating mixes for the performers on-stage. These consoles are typically placed at the side of the stage so that the operator can communicate with the performers on stage.

===Signal processors===
Small PA systems for venues such as bars and clubs are now available with features that were formerly only available on professional-level equipment, such as digital reverb effects, graphic equalizers, and, in some models, feedback prevention circuits which electronically sense and prevent audio feedback when it becomes a problem. Digital effects units may offer multiple pre-set and variable reverb, echo and related effects. Digital loudspeaker management systems offer sound engineers digital delay (to ensure speakers are in sync with each other), limiting, crossover functions, EQ filters, compression and other functions in a single rack-mountable unit. In previous decades, sound engineers typically had to transport a substantial number of rack-mounted analog effects unit devices to accomplish these tasks.

====Equalizers====

Equalizers are electronic devices that allow audio engineers to control the tone and frequencies of the sound in a channel, group (e.g., all the mics on a drumkit) or an entire stage&#x27;s mix. The bass and treble controls on a home stereo are a simple type of equalizer. Equalizers exist in professional sound reinforcement systems in three forms: shelving equalizers (typically for a whole range of bass and treble frequencies), graphic equalizers and parametric equalizers. Graphic equalizers have faders (vertical slide controls) which together resemble a frequency response curve plotted on a graph. The faders can be used to boost or cut specific frequency bands.

Using equalizers, frequencies that are too weak, such as a singer with modest projection in their lower register, can be boosted. Frequencies that are too loud, such as a &quot;boomy&quot; sounding bass drum, or an overly resonant dreadnought guitar can be cut. Sound reinforcement systems typically use graphic equalizers with one-third octave frequency centers. These are typically used to equalize output signals going to the main loudspeaker system or the monitor speakers on stage. Parametric equalizers are often built into each channel in mixing consoles, typically for the mid-range frequencies. They are also available as separate rack-mount units that can be connected to a mixing board. Parametric equalizers typically use knobs and sometimes buttons. The audio engineer can select which frequency band to cut or boost, and then use additional knobs to adjust how much to cut or boost this frequency range. Parametric equalizers first became popular in the 1970s and have remained the program equalizer of choice for many engineers since then.

A high-pass (low-cut) and/or low-pass (high-cut) filter may also be included on equalizers or audio consoles. High-pass and low-pass filters restrict a given channel&#x27;s bandwidth extremes. Cutting very low-frequency sound signals (termed &quot;infrasonic&quot;, or &quot;subsonic&quot;) reduces the waste of amplifier power which does not produce audible sound and which moreover can be hard on the subwoofer drivers. A low-pass filter to cut ultrasonic energy is useful to prevent interference from radio frequencies, lighting control, or digital circuitry creeping into the power amplifiers. Such filters are often paired with graphic and parametric equalizers to give the audio engineer full control of the frequency range. High-pass filters and low-pass filters used together function as a band-pass filter, eliminating undesirable frequencies both above and below the auditory spectrum. A band-stop filter, does the opposite. It allows all frequencies to pass except for one band in the middle. A feedback suppressor, using an microprocessor, automatically detects the onset of feedback and applies a narrow band-stop filter (a notch filter) at specific frequency or frequencies pertaining to the feedback.

====Compressors====

Dynamic range compression is designed to help the audio engineer to manage the dynamic range of audio signals. Prior to the invention of automatic compressors, audio engineers accomplished the same goal by &quot;riding the faders&quot;, listening carefully to the mix and lowering the faders of any singer or instrument which was getting too loud. A compressor accomplishes this by reducing the gain of a signal that is above a defined level (the threshold) by a defined amount determined by the ratio setting. Most compressors available are designed to allow the operator to select a ratio within a range typically between 1:1 and 20:1, with some allowing settings of up to ∞:1. A compressor with high compression ratio is typically referred to as a limiter. The speed that the compressor adjusts the gain of the signal (attack and release) is typically adjustable as is the final output or &quot;make-up gain&quot; of the device.

Compressor applications vary widely. Some applications use limiters for component protection and gain structure control. Artistic signal manipulation using a compressor is a subjective technique widely utilized by mix engineers to improve clarity or to creatively alter the signal in relation to the program material. An example of artistic compression is the typical heavy compression used on the various components of a modern rock drum kit. The drums are processed to be perceived as sounding more punchy and full.

====Noise gates====
A noise gate mutes signals below a set threshold level. A noise gate&#x27;s function is in, a sense, opposite to that of a compressor. Noise gates are useful for microphones which will pick up noise that is not relevant to the program, such as the hum of a miked electric guitar amplifier or the rustling of papers on a minister&#x27;s lectern. Noise gates are also used to process the microphones placed near the drums of a drum kit in many hard rock and metal bands. Without a noise gate, the microphone for a specific instrument such as the floor tom will also pick up signals from nearby drums or cymbals. With a noise gate, the threshold of sensitivity for each microphone on the drum kit can be set so that only the direct strike and subsequent decay of the drum will be heard, not the nearby sounds.

====Effects====
Reverberation and delay effects are widely used in sound reinforcement systems to enhance the sound of the mix and create a desired artistic effect. Reverb and delay add a sense of spaciousness to the sound. Reverb can give the effect of singing voice or instrument being present in anything from a small room to a massive hall, or even in a space that does not exist in the physical world. The use of reverb often goes unnoticed by the audience, as it often sounds more natural than if the signal was left &quot;dry&quot; (without effects). Many modern mixing boards designed for live sound include on-board reverb effects.

Other effects include modulation effects such as Flanger, phaser, and chorus and spectral manipulation or harmonic effects such as the exciter and harmonizer. The use of effects in the reproduction of 2010-era pop music is often in an attempt to mimic the sound of the studio version of the artist&#x27;s music in a live concert setting. For example, an audio engineer may use an Auto Tune effect to produce unusual vocal sound effects that a singer used on their recordings.

The appropriate type, variation, and level of effects is quite subjective and is often collectively determined by a production&#x27;s audio engineer, artists, bandleader, music producer, or musical director.

====Feedback suppressor====
A feedback suppressor detects unwanted audio feedback and suppresses it, typically by automatically inserting a notch filter into the signal path of the system. Audio feedback can create unwanted loud, screaming noises that are disruptive to the performance, and can damage speakers and performers&#x27; and audience members&#x27; ears. Audio feedback from microphones occurs when a microphone is too near a monitor or main speaker and the sound reinforcement system amplifies itself. Audio feedback through a microphone is almost universally regarded as a negative phenomenon, many electric guitarists use guitar feedback as part of their performance. This type of feedback is intentional, so the sound engineer does not try to prevent it.

===Power amplifiers===

A power amplifier is an electronic device that uses electrical power and circuitry to boost a line level signal and provides enough electrical power to drive a loudspeaker and produce sound. All loudspeakers, including headphones, require power amplification. Most professional audio power amplifiers also provide protection from clipping typically as some form of limiting. A power amplifier pushed into clipping can damage loudspeakers. Amplifiers also typically provide protection against short circuits across the output and overheating.

Audio engineers select amplifiers that provide enough headroom. Headroom refers to the amount by which the signal-handling capabilities of an audio system exceed a designated nominal level. Headroom can be thought of as a safety zone allowing transient audio peaks to exceed the nominal level without damaging the system or the audio signal, e.g., via clipping. Standards bodies differ in their recommendations for nominal level and headroom. Selecting amplifiers with enough headroom helps to ensure that the signal will remain clean and undistorted.

Like most sound reinforcement equipment, professional power amplifiers are typically designed to be mounted within standard 19-inch racks. Rack-mounted amps are typically housed in road cases to prevent damage to the equipment during transportation. Active loudspeakers have internally mounted amplifiers that have been selected by the manufacturer to match the requirements of the loudspeaker. Some active loudspeakers also have equalization, crossover and mixing circuitry built in.

Since amplifiers can generate a significant amount of heat, thermal dissipation is an important factor for operators to consider when mounting amplifiers into equipment racks. Many power amplifiers feature internal fans to draw air across their heat sinks. The heat sinks can become clogged with dust, which can adversely affect the cooling capabilities of the amplifier.

In the 1970s and 1980s, most PAs employed heavy class AB amplifiers. In the late 1990s, power amplifiers in PA applications became lighter, smaller, more powerful, and more efficient, with the increasing use of switching power supplies and class D amplifiers, which offered significant weight- and space-savings as well as increased efficiency. Often installed in railroad stations, stadia, and airports, class D amplifiers can run with minimal additional cooling and with higher rack densities, compared to older amplifiers.

Digital loudspeaker management systems (DLMS) that combine digital crossover functions, compression, limiting, and other features in a single unit are used to process the mix from the mixing console and route it to the various amplifiers. Systems may include several loudspeakers, each with its own output optimized for a specific range of frequencies (i.e. bass, midrange, and treble). Bi-amping and tri-amping of a sound reinforcement system with the aid of a DLMS results in more efficient use of amplifier power by sending each amplifier only the frequencies appropriate for its respective loudspeaker and eliminating losses associated with passive crossover circuits.

===Main loudspeakers===

A simple and inexpensive PA loudspeaker may have a single full-range loudspeaker driver, housed in a suitable enclosure. More elaborate, professional-caliber sound reinforcement loudspeakers may incorporate separate drivers to produce low, middle, and high frequency sounds. A crossover network routes the different frequencies to the appropriate drivers. In the 1960s, horn loaded theater and PA speakers were commonly columns of multiple drivers mounted in a vertical line within a tall enclosure.

The 1970s to early 1980s was a period of innovation in loudspeaker design with many sound reinforcement companies designing their own speakers using commercially available drivers. The areas of innovation were in cabinet design, durability, ease of packing and transport, and ease of setup. This period also saw the introduction of the hanging or &quot;flying&quot; of main loudspeakers at large concerts. During the 1980s the large speaker manufacturers started producing standard products using the innovations of the 1970s. These were mostly smaller two way systems with 12&quot;, 15&quot; or double 15&quot; woofers and a high frequency driver attached to a high frequency horn. The 1980s also saw the start of loudspeaker companies focused on the sound reinforcement market.

The 1990s saw the introduction of line arrays, where long vertical arrays of loudspeakers in smaller cabinets are used to increase efficiency and provide even dispersion and frequency response. Trapezoidal-shaped enclosures became popular as this shape allowed many of them to be easily arrayed together. This period also saw the introduction of inexpensive molded plastic speaker enclosures mounted on tripod stands. Many feature built-in power amplifiers which made them practical for non-professionals to set up and operate successfully. The sound quality available from these simple powered speakers varies widely depending on the implementation.

Many sound reinforcement loudspeaker systems incorporate protection circuitry to prevent damage from excessive power or operator error. Resettable fuses, specialized current-limiting light bulbs, and circuit breakers were used alone or in combination to reduce driver failures. During the same period, the professional sound reinforcement industry made the Neutrik Speakon NL4 and NL8 connectors the standard speaker connectors, replacing 1/4&quot; jacks, XLR connectors, and Cannon multipin connectors which are all limited to a maximum of 15 amps of current. XLR connectors are still the standard input connector on active loudspeaker cabinets.

To help users avoid overpowering them, loudspeakers have a power rating (in watts) which indicates their maximum power capacity. Thanks to the efforts of the Audio Engineering Society (AES) and the loudspeaker industry group ALMA in developing the EIA-426 testing standard, power-handling specifications became more trustworthy.
Lightweight, portable speaker systems for small venues route the low-frequency parts of the music (electric bass, bass drum, etc.) to a powered subwoofer. Routing the low-frequency energy to a separate amplifier and subwoofer can substantially improve the bass response of the system. Also, clarity may be enhanced because low-frequency sounds can cause intermodulation and other distortion in speaker systems.

Professional sound reinforcement speaker systems often include dedicated hardware for safely &quot;flying&quot; them above the stage area, to provide more even sound coverage and to maximize sightlines within performance venues.

===Monitor loudspeakers===

Monitor loudspeakers, also called &quot;foldback&quot; loudspeakers, are speaker cabinets used onstage to help performers to hear their singing or playing. As such, monitor speakers are pointed towards a performer or a section of the stage. They are generally sent a different mix of vocals or instruments than the mix that is sent to the main loudspeaker system. Monitor loudspeaker cabinets are often a wedge shape, directing their output upwards towards the performer when set on the floor of the stage. Simple two-way, dual-driver designs with a speaker cone and a horn are common, as monitor loudspeakers need to be smaller to save space on the stage. These loudspeakers typically require less power and volume than the main loudspeaker system, as they only need to provide sound for a few people who are in relatively close proximity to the loudspeaker. Some manufacturers have designed loudspeakers for use either as a component of a small PA system or as a monitor loudspeaker. A number of manufacturers produce powered monitor speakers, which contain an integrated amplifier.

Using monitor speakers instead of in-ear monitors typically results in an increase of stage volume, which can lead to more feedback issues and progressive hearing damage for the performers in front of them. The clarity of the mix for the performer on stage is also typically compromised as they hear more extraneous noise from around them. The use of monitor loudspeakers, active (with an integrated amplifier) or passive, requires more cabling and gear on stage, resulting in a more cluttered stage. These factors, amongst others, have led to the increasing popularity of in-ear monitors.

===In-ear monitors===

In-ear monitors are headphones that have been designed for use as monitors by a live performer. They are either of a &quot;universal fit&quot; or &quot;custom fit&quot; design. The universal fit in-ear monitors feature rubber or foam tips that can be inserted into virtually anybody&#x27;s ear. Custom-fit in-ear monitors are created from an impression of the user&#x27;s ear that has been made by an audiologist. In-ear monitors are almost always used in conjunction with a wireless transmitting system, allowing the performer to freely move about the stage while receiving their monitor mix.

In-ear monitors offer considerable isolation for the performer using them: no on-stage sound is heard and the monitor engineer can deliver a much more accurate and clear mix for the performer. With in-ear monitors, each performer can be sent their own customized mix; although this was also the case with monitor speakers, the in-ear monitors of one performer cannot be heard by the other musicians. A downside of this isolation is that the performer cannot hear the crowd or the comments from other performers on stage that do not have microphones (e.g., if the bass player wishes to communicate to the drummer). This has been remedied in larger productions by setting up microphones facing the audience that can be mixed into the in-ear monitor sends.

Since their introduction in the mid-1980s, in-ear monitors have grown to be the most popular monitoring choice for large touring acts. The reduction or elimination of loudspeakers other than instrument amplifiers on stage has allowed for cleaner and less problematic mixing for both the front of house and monitor engineers. Audio feedback is greatly reduced and there is less sound reflecting off the back wall of the stage out into vocal mics and the audience, which improves the clarity of the front-of-house mix.

==Applications==
Sound reinforcement systems are used in a broad range of different settings, each of which poses different challenges.

===Rental systems===

Audio-visual rental systems have to be able to withstand heavy use and even abuse from renters. For this reason, rental companies tend to own speaker cabinets that are heavily braced and protected with steel corners, and electronic equipment such as power amplifiers or effects are often mounted into protective road cases. Rental companies also tend to select gear that have electronic protection features, such as speaker-protection circuitry and amplifier limiters.

Rental systems for non-professionals need to be easy to use and set up and they must be easy to repair and maintain for the renting company. From this perspective, speaker cabinets need to have easy-to-access horns, speakers, and crossover circuitry, so that repairs or replacements can be made.

Many touring acts and large venue corporate events will rent large sound reinforcement systems that typically include one or more audio engineers on staff with the renting company. In the case of rental systems for tours, there are typically several audio engineers and technicians from the rental company that tour with the band to set up and calibrate the equipment. The individual that mixes the band is often selected and provided by the band, as they are familiar with the various aspects of the show and understand how the band wants the show to sound.

===Live music clubs and dance events===
Setting up sound reinforcement for live music clubs and dance events often poses unique challenges, because there is such a large variety of venues that are used as clubs, ranging from former warehouses or music theaters to small restaurants or basement pubs with concrete walls. Dance events may be held in huge warehouses, aircraft hangars or outdoor spaces. In some cases, clubs are housed in multi-story venues with balconies or in L-shaped rooms, which makes it hard to get a consistent sound for all audience members. The solution is to use fill-in speakers to obtain good coverage, using a delay to ensure that the audience does not hear the same reinforced sound at different times.

The number of subwoofer speaker cabinets and power amplifiers dedicated to low-frequency sounds used in a club depends on the type of club, the genres of music played there, and the size of the venue. A small coffeehouse where traditional folk, bluegrass or jazz groups are the main performers may have no subwoofers, and instead rely on the full-range main PA speakers to reproduce bass sounds. On the other hand, a club where hard rock or heavy metal music bands play or a nightclub where DJs play dance music may have multiple large subwoofers, as these genres and music styles typically use powerful, deep bass sound.

A challenge with designing sound systems for clubs is that the sound system may need to be used for both prerecorded music played by DJs and live music. A club system designed for DJs needs a DJ mixer and space for record players. In contrast, a live music club needs a mixing board designed for live sound, an onstage monitor system, and a multicore snake cable running from the stage to the mixer. Clubs that feature both types of shows may face challenges providing the desired equipment and set-up for both uses. Clubs can be a hostile environment for sound gear, in that the air may be hot, humid, and smoky. In some clubs, keeping power amplifiers cool may be a challenge.

===Houses of worship===

Churches and similar houses of worship often pose design challenges. Speakers may need to be unobtrusive to blend in with antique woodwork and stonework. In some cases, audio designers have designed custom-painted speaker cabinets. Some facilities, such as sanctuaries or chapels are long rooms with low ceilings and additional fill-in speakers are needed throughout the room to give good coverage. Once installed, church systems are often operated by amateur volunteers from the congregation, which means that they must be easy to operate and troubleshoot. To this end, some mixing consoles designed for houses of worship have automatic mixers, which turn down unused channels to reduce noise, and automatic feedback elimination circuits which detect and notch out frequencies that are feeding back. These features may also be available in multi-function consoles used in convention facilities and multi-purpose venues.

===Touring systems===

Touring sound systems are available in many different sizes and shapes as they have to be powerful and versatile enough to cover many different halls and venues. Touring systems range from mid-sized systems for bands playing nightclub and other mid-sized venues to large systems for groups playing stadiums, arenas and outdoor festivals. Tour sound systems are often designed with substantial redundancy features, so that in the event of equipment failure or amplifier overheating, the system will continue to function. Touring systems for bands performing for crowds of a few thousand people and up are typically set up and operated by a team of technicians and engineers who travel with the performers to every show.

Mainstream bands that are going to perform in mid- to large-sized venues during their tour schedule one to two weeks of technical rehearsal with the entire concert system and production staff, including audio engineers, at hand. This allows the audio and lighting engineers to become familiar with the show and establish presets on their digital equipment (e.g., digital mixers) for each part of the show, if needed. Many modern musical groups work with their front of house and monitor mixing engineers during this time to establish what their general idea is of how the show and mix should sound, both for themselves on stage and for the audience.

This often involves programming different effects and signal processing for use on specific songs, to make the songs sound somewhat similar to the studio versions. To manage a show with a lot of effects changes, the mixing engineers for the show often choose to use a digital mixing console so that they can save and automatically recall these many settings in between each song. This time is also used by the system technicians to get familiar with the specific combination of gear that is going to be used on the tour and how it acoustically responds during the show. These technicians remain busy during the show, making sure the SR system is operating properly and that the system is tuned correctly, as the acoustic response of a room or venue will respond differently throughout the day depending on the temperature, humidity, and number of people in the room or space.

===Live theater===
Sound for live theater, operatic theater, and other dramatic applications may pose problems similar to those of churches; theaters may be in heritage buildings where speakers and wiring is required to blend in with the architecture. The need for clear sightlines may make the use of regular speaker cabinets unacceptable; instead, slim, low-profile speakers are often used instead.

In live theater and drama, performers move around onstage, which means that wireless microphones may be necessary. Some of the higher-budget theater shows and musicals are mixed in surround sound live, often with the show&#x27;s sound operator triggering sound effects that are being mixed with music and dialogue by the show&#x27;s mixing engineer. These systems are usually much more extensive to design, typically involving separate sets of speakers for different zones in the theater.

===Classical music and opera===
A subtle type of sound reinforcement called acoustic enhancement is used in some concert halls where classical music such as symphonies and opera is performed. Acoustic enhancement systems add more sound to the hall and prevent &quot;dead spots&quot; in the audience seating area by &quot;...augment[ing] a hall&#x27;s intrinsic acoustic characteristics.&quot; The systems use &quot;...an array of microphones connected to a computer [which is] connected to an array of loudspeakers.&quot; However, as concertgoers have become aware of the use of these systems, debates have arisen, because &quot;...purists maintain that the natural acoustic sound of [Classical] voices [or] instruments in a given hall should not be altered.&quot;

Kai Harada&#x27;s article &quot;Opera&#x27;s Dirty Little Secret&quot; states that opera houses have begun using electronic acoustic enhancement systems &quot;...to compensate for flaws in a venue&#x27;s acoustical architecture.&quot; Despite the uproar that has arisen amongst operagoers, Harada points out that none of the opera houses using acoustic enhancement systems &quot;...use traditional, Broadway-style sound reinforcement, in which most if not all singers are equipped with radio microphones mixed to a series of unsightly loudspeakers scattered throughout the theatre.&quot; Instead, most opera houses use the sound reinforcement system for acoustic enhancement, and for subtle boosting of offstage voices, onstage dialogue, and sound effects (e.g., church bells in Tosca or thunder in Wagnerian operas).

These systems use microphones, computer processing &quot;with delay, phase, and frequency-response changes&quot;, and then send the signal &quot;... to a large number of loudspeakers placed in extremities of the performance venue.&quot; Another acoustic enhancement system, VRAS uses &quot;...different algorithms based on microphones placed around the room.&quot; The Deutsche Staatsoper in Berlin and the Hummingbird Centre in Toronto use a LARES system. The Ahmanson Theatre in Los Angeles, the Royal National Theatre in London, and the Vivian Beaumont Theater in New York City use the SIAP system.

===Lecture halls and conference rooms===
Lecture halls and conference rooms pose the challenge of reproducing speech clearly in a large hall, which may have reflective, echo-producing surfaces. One issue with reproducing speech is that the microphone used to pick up the sound of an individual&#x27;s voice may also pick up unwanted sounds, such as the rustling of papers on a podium. A more tightly directional microphone may help to reduce unwanted background noises.

Another challenge with doing live sound for individuals who are speaking at a conference is that, in comparison with professional singers, individuals who are invited to speak at a forum may not be familiar with how microphones work. Some individuals may accidentally point the microphone towards a speaker or monitor speaker, which may cause audio feedback.

In some conferences, sound engineers have to provide microphones for a large number of people who are speaking, in the case of a panel conference or debate. In some cases, automatic mixers are used to control the levels of the microphones and turn off the channels for microphones that are not being spoken into, to reduce unwanted background noise and reduce the likelihood of feedback.

===Sports sound systems===

Systems for sports facilities often have to deal with substantial echo, which can make speech unintelligible. Sports and recreational sound systems often face environmental challenges as well, such as the need for weather-proof outdoor speakers in outdoor stadiums and humidity- and splash-resistant speakers in swimming pools. Another challenge with sports sound reinforcement setups is that in many arenas and stadiums, the spectators are on all four sides of the playing field. This requires 360-degree sound coverage. This is very different from the norm with music festivals and music halls, where the musicians are on stage and the audience is seated in front of the stage.

==Setting up and testing==
Large-scale sound reinforcement systems are designed, installed, and operated by audio engineers and audio technicians. During the design phase of a newly constructed venue, audio engineers work with architects and contractors, to ensure that the proposed design will accommodate the speakers and provide an appropriate space for sound technicians and the racks of audio equipment. Audio engineers will also provide advice on which audio components would best suit the space and its intended use, and on the correct placement and installation of these components. During the installation phase, audio engineers ensure that high-power electrical components are safely installed and connected and that ceiling or wall-mounted speakers are properly mounted (or &quot;flown&quot;) onto rigging. When the sound reinforcement components are installed, the audio engineers test and calibrate the system so that its sound production will be even across the frequency spectrum.

===System testing===
A sound reinforcement system should be able to accurately reproduce a signal from its input, through any processing, to its output without any coloration or distortion. However, due to inconsistencies in venue sizes, shapes, building materials, and even crowd densities, this is not always possible without prior calibration of the system. This can be done in one of several ways.

The oldest method of system calibration involves a set of healthy ears, test program material (i.e. music or speech), a graphic equalizer, and a familiarity with the desired frequency response. One must then listen to the program material through the system, take note of any noticeable frequency deviation or resonances, and correct them using the equalizer. Engineers typically use a familiar playlist to calibrate a new system. This &quot;by ear&quot; process is still done by many engineers, even when analysis equipment is used, as a final check of how the system sounds with music or speech playing through the system. Another method of manual calibration requires a pair of high-quality headphones patched into the input signal &quot;before&quot; any processing. One can then use this direct signal as a reference with which to identify any differences in frequency response.
Since the development of digital signal processing (DSP), there have been many pieces of equipment and computer software designed to shift the bulk of the work of system calibration from human auditory interpretation to software algorithms that run on microprocessors. One tool for calibrating a sound system is a real-time analyzer (RTA). This tool is usually used by piping pink noise into the system and measuring the result with a special calibrated microphone connected to the RTA. Using this information, the system can be adjusted to help achieve the desired frequency response.

More recently, sound engineers have seen the introduction of dual fast-Fourier transform (FFT) based audio analysis software, such as Smaart, which allows an engineer to view not only frequency response information that an RTA provides, but also in the time domain. This provides the engineer with much more meaningful data than an RTA alone. Dual FFT analysis allows one to compare the source signal with the output signal. A system can be calibrated using normal program material instead of pink noise or other special test signals. Calibration can be monitored during a performance.

==Equipment supply stores==
Professional audio stores sell microphones, speaker enclosures, monitor speakers, mixing boards, rack-mounted effects units and related equipment designed for use by audio engineers and technicians. Stores often use the word &quot;professional&quot; or &quot;pro&quot; in their name or the description of their store, to differentiate their stores from consumer electronics stores, which sell consumer-grade loudspeakers, home cinema equipment, and amplifiers, which are designed for private, in-home use.

<text>USS &quot;Lake Champlain&quot; (CG-57) is a guided missile cruiser in the United States Navy. She is the third US Naval ship to be named &quot;Lake Champlain&quot;, in honor of Battle of Lake Champlain, which took place during the War of 1812.

&quot;Lake Champlain&quot; was laid down 3 March 1986, at Ingalls Shipbuilding in Pascagoula, Mississippi, launched 3 April 1987, and commissioned 12 August 1988, at Intrepid Pier at the Intrepid Sea-Air-Space Museum in New York City. She then steamed to her homeport of San Diego, via Cape Horn, South America, losing part of her hurricane bulwark in heavy seas.

==Ship history==
===Deployments===
She has been to the Persian Gulf on multiple occasions, first as a part of Operation Desert Shield, then later following Desert Storm.

On 25 January 1990 in the northern Philippine Sea, &quot;Lake Champlain&quot; rescued 14 sailors from MV &quot;Huazhu&quot; and transported the survivors to Subic Bay. She aided in the evacuation of the Philippines during the 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption while transiting to the Persian Gulf.

&quot;Lake Champlain&quot; was assigned to Carrier Group One. The ship completed 17 major deployments.

===2007 explosion===
On 10 November 2007 an explosion occurred in the ship&#x27;s hull during routine maintenance in a San Diego dry dock. Six workers were injured, one of them critically. The explosion was caused when flammable gases ignited inside the fuel-tank compartment where the workers were working. The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) investigated the incident. OSHA cited NASSCO, a Navy contractor in charge of the work, for seven serious safety violations and two minor safety violations at the site. The explosion occurred one day after NASSCO subcontractor Técnico Corporation fired a safety inspector who was responsible for measuring oxygen levels in enclosed worksites. The inspector subsequently filed a lawsuit against his former employer, alleging that he was a whistleblower who was fired after warning superiors that additional safety measures were needed on the ship.

===2017 collision===
On 9 May 2017, a South Korean fishing vessel, approximately in length, collided with the port side of &quot;Lake Champlain&quot; while the ship was underway and conducting routine operations in international waters off Asia. No injuries were reported. &quot;Lake Champlain&quot; had attempted to contact the fishing vessel, but it didn&#x27;t have a radio. The fishing vessel did not respond to &quot;Lake Champlain&quot;″s emergency whistle. Both the cruiser and the fishing vessel were undamaged enough to be able to sail away under their own power.

===2023 end of service===
&quot;Lake Champlain&quot; was decommissioned during a ceremony at San Diego Naval Base on 1 September 2023. She remains with the Navy as they plan to use her as a Logistics Support Asset.

<doc id="764387" wikidata="Q5898009" url="?curid=764387" title="Hooked on Phonics">
<text>Hooked on Phonics is a commercial brand of educational materials, initially designed to teach reading through phonics. First marketed in 1987, the program uses systematic phonics and scaffolded stories to teach letter–sound correlations as part of children&#x27;s literacy. Over time, the brand has expanded to include a wide variety of media, such as books, computer games, music, videos, and flashcards. The current primary target audience includes individuals, some schools, and homeschooling parents. The product gained significant recognition during the 1990s due to extensive television and radio advertising.

==History==

Hooked on Phonics was developed in the 1980s, with the original &quot;Learn to Read&quot; product released by Gateway Educational Products in 1987. The company&#x27;s success was largely driven by significant advertising, leading to sales exceeding $100 million annually. The product&#x27;s catchphrase, &quot;Hooked on Phonics worked for me!&quot;, and the memorable telephone number &quot;1-800-ABCDEFG&quot; became widely recognized during the mid-1990s. The Rush Limbaugh radio program was among the notable advertising venues.

In 1994, the company was featured on &quot;Dateline NBC&quot;, with an official from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) accusing it of &quot;deceptive advertising.&quot; Gateway Educational Products and the FTC reached a settlement, with the company agreeing to adhere to advertising guidelines and disclose all research data and consumer complaints. Despite the settlement, negative media coverage led to a significant decline in sales, resulting in the company&#x27;s bankruptcy. In 2001, the company introduced the &quot;Hooked on School Success&quot; program, which included test-taking strategies and study skills. That same year, a partnership with KinderCare Learning Centers was established to use Hooked on Phonics materials in KinderCare&#x27;s private childcare facilities.

In 2004, the FTC fined the company, then known as Gateway Learning Corporation, for retroactively changing its privacy policy without informing customers and for sharing private information, including data on children, with external marketing firms.

In 2005, Educate, Inc., which also operated Sylvan Learning, acquired Hooked on Phonics and began selling the products at retail. In 2006, the company released new educational programs, including &quot;Hooked on Spanish&quot;, &quot;Hooked on Handwriting&quot;, and &quot;Hooked on Spelling&quot;. By 2007, the Hooked on Phonics program had been introduced in over 30 countries. Later that year, the company was taken private and renamed &quot;Smarterville, Inc.&quot; 

In 2009, the flagship &quot;Learn to Read&quot; product was extensively redesigned, incorporating DVDs, web customizations, and a new series of systematic phonics readers. This release also included 60 music videos composed by Russell Ginns and performed by artists such as Cathy Fink, Marcy Marxer, and the acappella group The Bobs. Sandviks Inc. acquired Hooked on Phonics in 2011, bringing new management and a fresh start to the company.

In 2013, the Hooked on Phonics mobile app was launched for iOS and Android devices. This app was completely overhauled and relaunched in 2020. In 2022, the Hooked on Math app was introduced, and the brand expanded under the umbrella name Hooked &amp; Company.

==Authors==

The Hooked on Phonics program features books and stories by more than fifty authors, including Charlotte Zolotow, Robert D. San Souci, Russell Ginns, David Ezra Stein, Rosemary Wells, and Jahnna N. Malcolm.

==Performers==

The program&#x27;s musical content includes contributions from the following artists:
* The Bobs
* Cathy Fink &amp; Marcy Marxer
* Marcy Heisler
* Russell Ginns
* Bob Dorough
* Stuart Kollmorgan
* Ben Steinfeld
* Carolee Goodgold
* Eric Stuart
* April and Eva Ginns
* Randy Thomas

==Awards==
Hooked on Phonics products have received several awards over the years, including:
* National Parenting Seal of Approval (1998, 2005, 2007)
* Teachers&#x27; Choice Award (2004, 2008, 2009)

<doc id="764388" wikidata="Q354009" url="?curid=764388" title="National parks of the United Kingdom">
<text>National parks of the United Kingdom (; ) are 15 areas of relatively undeveloped and scenic landscape across the country. Despite their name, they are quite different from national parks in many other countries, which are usually owned and managed by governments as protected community resources, and which do not usually include permanent human communities. In the United Kingdom, an area designated as a national park may include substantial settlements and human land uses that are often integral parts of the landscape. Land within national parks remains largely in private ownership. These parks are therefore not &quot;national parks&quot; according to the internationally accepted standard of the IUCN but they are areas of outstanding landscape where planning controls are a little more restrictive than elsewhere.

Within the United Kingdom there are fifteen national parks of which ten are in England, three in Wales, two in Scotland, and none in Northern Ireland.

An estimated 110 million people visit the national parks of England and Wales each year. Recreation and tourism bring visitors and funds into the parks, to sustain their conservation efforts, and support the local population through jobs and businesses. However, these visitors also bring problems, such as erosion and traffic congestion, and conflicts over the use of the parks&#x27; resources. Access to cultivated land in England and Wales is restricted to public rights of way and permissive paths. (Under the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 there is a right of access for walkers to most but not all uncultivated areas in England and Wales.)

==Administration==
National parks are a devolved matter, so each of the countries of the United Kingdom has its own policies and arrangements for them. The national parks of Scotland and those of England and Wales are governed by separate laws: the National Parks (Scotland) Act 2000 in Scotland and the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949 for England and Wales.

The Environment Act 1995 defines the role of national parks in England and Wales as being: 
*to conserve and enhance the natural beauty, wildlife and cultural heritage of the National Park, and 
*to promote opportunities for the understanding and enjoyment of the special qualities of the National Parks by the public.

The Broads differs from the twelve national parks in England &amp; Wales in having a third purpose that carries equal weight, that of: 
*protecting the interests of navigation.

The Scottish national parks have two further statutory purposes:
*to promote sustainable use of the natural resources of the area, and
*to promote sustainable economic and social development of the area&#x27;s communities.

===National park authorities===
Following the Environment Act 1995, each English and Welsh national park has been managed by its own national park authority, a special-purpose local authority, since April 1997. Previously, all but the Peak District and the Lake District were governed by county councils. The Peak District and the Lake District, the first two national parks to be designated, were under the control of planning boards that were independent of county councils. Similar national park authorities have also been established for the Scottish parks under separate legislation.

Slightly over half the members of each national park authority are appointees from the principal local authorities covered by the park; the remainder are appointed by the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (in England) or the Welsh Ministers (in Wales), some to represent local parish or community councils, others to represent the national interest. The Broads Authority also has members appointed by Natural England, Great Yarmouth Port Authority and the Environment Agency. The national park authorities and the Broads Authority are covered by regulations similar to those that apply to local councils.

The national park authority for each park addresses the stated aim in partnership with other organisations, such as the National Trust. In cases where there may be conflict between the two purposes of designation, the first (to conserve and enhance the natural beauty, wildlife and cultural heritage of the National Park) must take precedence under the Sandford Principle. This principle was given statutory force by section 62 of the Environment Act 1995, although there are no explicit provisions as to how wildlife is to be preserved. The national park authorities also have a duty to foster the economic and social wellbeing of communities in pursuit of these purposes.

Funding for national parks is complex, but the full cost of each park authority is funded from central government funds. In the past this was partly paid for by local authorities and refunded to them from the government to varying degrees. In 2003/2004 the park authorities received around £35.5 million of central government funding.

===Other organisations===

The UK&#x27;s national parks are members of National Parks UK, which works to promote them, and to facilitate training and development for staff of all the parks.

Natural England is the statutory body responsible for designating new national parks in England, subject to approval by the Secretary of State; Natural Resources Wales designates new national parks in Wales, subject to approval by the Welsh Ministers. All fifteen United Kingdom national parks are represented by the Association of National Park Authorities, which exists to provide the park authorities with a single voice when dealing with government and its agencies. The Campaign for National Parks (formerly Council for National Parks) is a charity that works to protect and enhance the national parks of England and Wales.

==Legal designation==
National parks were first designated under the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949, and in England and Wales any new national park is designated under this Act, and must be confirmed by the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. The 1949 Act came about after a prolonged campaign for public access to the countryside in the United Kingdom with its roots in the Industrial Revolution. The first &#x27;freedom to roam&#x27; bill was introduced to Parliament in 1884 by James Bryce but it was not until 1931 that a government inquiry recommended the creation of a &#x27;National Park Authority&#x27; to select areas for designation as national parks. Despite the recommendation and continued lobbying and demonstrations of public discontent, such as the 1932 Kinder Scout mass trespass in the Peak District, nothing further was done until a 1945 white paper on national parks was produced as part of the Labour Party&#x27;s planned post-war reconstruction, leading in 1949 to the passing of the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act.

In England and Wales, as in Scotland, designation as a national park means that the area has been identified as being of importance to the national heritage and as such is worthy of special protection and attention. Unlike the model adopted in many other countries, such as the US and Germany, this does not mean the area is owned by the state. National parks in the United Kingdom may include substantial settlements and human land uses which are often integral parts of the landscape, and within a national park there are many landowners including public bodies and private individuals.

==Origins and growth==
Archaeological evidence from prehistoric Britain shows that the areas now designated as national parks have been occupied by humans since the Stone Age, at least 5,000 years ago and in some cases much earlier.

Before the 19th century relatively wild, remote areas were often seen simply as uncivilised and dangerous. In 1725 Daniel Defoe described the High Peak as &quot;the most desolate, wild and abandoned country in all England&quot;. However, by the early 19th century, romantic poets such as Byron, Coleridge and Wordsworth wrote about the inspirational beauty of the &quot;untamed&quot; countryside. Wordsworth described the English Lake District as a &quot;sort of national property in which every man has a right and interest who has an eye to perceive and a heart to enjoy&quot; in 1810. This early vision, based in the Picturesque movement, took over a century, and much controversy, to take legal form in the UK with the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949.

The idea for a form of national parks was first proposed in the United States in the 1860s, where national parks were established to protect wilderness areas such as Yosemite. This model has been used in many other countries since, but not in the United Kingdom.

After thousands of years of human integration into the landscape, Britain lacks any substantial areas of wilderness. Furthermore, those areas of natural beauty so cherished by the romantic poets were often only maintained and managed in their existing state by human activity, usually agriculture.

===Government support is established===
By the early 1930s increasing public interest in the countryside, coupled with the growing and newly mobile urban population, was generating increasing friction between those seeking access to the countryside and landowners. Alongside of direct action trespasses, such as the mass trespass of Kinder Scout, several voluntary bodies took up the cause of public access in the political arena.

In 1931 Christopher Addison (later Lord Addison) chaired a government committee that proposed a &#x27;National Park Authority&#x27; to choose areas for designation as national parks. A system of national reserves and nature sanctuaries was proposed:

However, no further action was taken after the intervention of the 1931 General Election.

The voluntary Standing Committee on National Parks first met on 26 May 1936 to put the case to the government for national parks in the UK. After World War II, the Labour Party proposed the establishment of national parks as part of the post-war reconstruction of the UK. A report by John Dower, secretary of the Standing Committee on National Parks, to the Minister of Town and Country Planning in 1945 was followed in 1947 by a Government committee, this time chaired by Sir Arthur Hobhouse, which prepared legislation for national parks, and proposed twelve national parks. Sir Arthur had this to say on the criteria for designating suitable areas:

===National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949===
The National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949 was passed with all party support. The first ten national parks were designated as such in the 1950s under the Act in mostly poor-quality agricultural upland. Much of the land was still owned by individual landowners, often private estates, but there was also property owned by public bodies such as the Crown, or charities which allow and encourage access such as the National Trust. Accessibility from the cities was also considered important.

The Peak District, site of the Kinder Scout trespass, was designated the first national park in April 1951 under the Clement Attlee led Labour administration. This was followed in the same year by the designations of three more national parks; the Lake District, Snowdonia and Dartmoor. By the end of the decade the national park family had increased to ten with the Pembrokeshire Coast, North York Moors, Yorkshire Dales, Exmoor, Northumberland and Brecon Beacons national parks all being designated.

Other areas were also considered: for example, parts of the coast of Cornwall were considered as a possible national park in the 1950s but were thought to be too disparate to form a single coherent national park and were eventually designated as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) instead. The north Pennines were also considered for designation as a national park in the 1970s but the proposal was thought to be administratively too difficult because the area was administered by five different county councils.

===Later additions===
The Norfolk and Suffolk Broads was designated through its own Act of Parliament in 1988, gaining status equivalent to that of a national park. The Broads in East Anglia are not in the strictest sense a national park, being run by a separately constituted Broads Authority set up by a special Act of Parliament in 1988 and with a structure in which conservation is subordinate to navigational concerns (see Sandford Principle below), but it is generally regarded as being &quot;equivalent to&quot; a national park.

Separate legislation was passed in Scotland, namely the National Parks (Scotland) Act 2000, and from this two Scottish national parks, the Cairngorms and Loch Lomond and The Trossachs, were created.

The New Forest, which includes the largest remaining tracts of unenclosed pasture land, heathland and old-growth forest in the heavily populated south east of England, was designated as a national park on 1 March 2005. On 31 March 2009 it was announced that the South Downs would be designated a national park; the South Downs National Park came into effect on 31 March 2010. Of the English and Welsh national parks that were originally proposed, two remain undesignated: the Cambrian Mountains and Cornish Coast.

===Overview===

Of the twelve national parks in England and Wales, four are in the North of England, two in the Southwest, one in the North Midlands, two (the most recently designated) in the South and three in Wales. They cover 10.7 per cent of England and 19.9 per cent of Wales. They touch only sixteen English counties and there is no national park in the southern Midlands.

The Cairngorms National Park, at , is the largest of the national parks. Outside the Scottish Highlands the largest is the Lake District National Park, which, at , is the largest National Park in England and the second largest in the United Kingdom.

Snowdonia National Park, at , is the largest national park in Wales and the fourth largest in the United Kingdom.

The smallest national park in England and Wales, and in the United Kingdom, is The Broads, at .

The total area of the national parks in England and Wales is about , for an average of 1,251 square kilometres but a median of 1,344 square kilometres. In the United Kingdom the total increases to 22,660 square kilometres (average 1511 km2). The most-visited national park is the Lake District, with 15.8 million visitors in 2009, although by visitor days the South Downs at 39 million compares to 23.1 million for the Lake District.

===List of national parks===

===National parks in England===

(Numbers are those on map.)
*Peak District (1): The central location of this park provides for the coincidence of the northern limit of many lowland species, such as the stemless thistle and the southern extent of many northern upland species, such as the mountain hare and globe flower. It is located at the southern end of the Pennines, known as the backbone of England. The Carboniferous Limestone of the White Peak in its southern and central areas, gives rise to peaks formed by harder reef limestone and dales rich in wildlife (typically over fifty species of wildflower and herb per square metre) gouged out by meltwater from the Ice Age. In the north, east and west is the Dark Peak where the rocks are shale, sandstone and gritstone and where layers of peat have given rise to stark moorland landscapes.
*Lake District (2): England&#x27;s largest national park has geology providing a dramatic record of nearly 500 million years, with evidence of colliding continents, deep oceans, tropical seas, and kilometre-thick ice sheets. The area has the largest and deepest lakes and highest peaks in England. This landscape is overlaid by thousands of years of human activity and the habitats for wildlife to be found in the park include mires, limestone pavement, upland heath, screes and arctic-alpine communities, lakeshore wetlands, estuary, coastal heath and dunes.
*Dartmoor (4): Dartmoor is the largest and wildest area of open country in the south of England. Granite, intruded 295 million years ago underlies 65% of the park and is surrounded by sedimentary rocks including limestones, shales and sandstones belonging to the Carboniferous and Devonian periods. Almost half of the park is moorland, and within it are four separate national nature reserves, including the 366 hectare East Dartmoor Woods &amp; Heath. There are also over forty locations designated as Sites of Special Scientific Interest within the national park covering 26,169 hectares. Dartmoor is also home to England&#x27;s second highest waterfall (Canonteign Falls) and highest man made waterfall.
*North York Moors (6): Boasting archaeology dating from the end of the last ice age, the park contains the largest Iron Age hill-fort in the North of England, Roman forts, castles and abbeys, moorland crosses and important early industrial sites. Its ancient and varied geology includes the evidence left behind of ancient oceans, huge river deltas and great ice sheets. The evidence left behind by these events has brought geologists to the area for over a century, including figures such as William Smith, &#x27;the father of English geology&#x27;. The area is also famous for its fossils, from ammonites to dinosaur footprints.
*Yorkshire Dales (7): The park straddles the central Pennines. At the Millstone Grit-capped Three Peaks it rises to over 2,300 ft, contrasting with its deep cut valleys (dales) from which it derives its name. In the south the park boasts limestone (Karst) scenery, with its crags, pavements and extensive cave systems, whilst in the north valleys with distinctive stepped profiles are separated by extensive moorland plateaux. A different geology shapes the grassy rounded hills with deep ravines in the west known as the Howgill Fells. The park is noted for its glacial and post-glacial landforms including the drumlin fields, Norber erratics, and the moraines and post-glacial lakes of Semerwater and Malham Tarn. The park also boasts waterfalls including Hardraw Force and the Aysgarth Falls.
*Exmoor (8): The majority of Exmoor&#x27;s rocks were formed during the Devonian period of geological history between about 410 and 360 million years ago, the most prominent being old and new red sandstones, Devonian slates, shales and limestone. The park rises to 519m at Dunkery Beacon and boasts 55 km of coastline towards which flow a number of rivers, most notably the River Lyn. In contrast the Exe flows south and east. A number of settlements are found within the park including the much-visited Lynton and Lynmouth.
*Northumberland (9): With a population of around 2,000 people this is the least populated of all the national parks in England and Wales. Rising to 815m at The Cheviot, the park contains over 1,100 km of paths for walking, cycling and horse-riding. The park also contains a Ramsar site (an international site for the protection of wetlands) as well as 31 Sites of Special Scientific Interest, six Special Areas of Conservation and three national nature reserves. The park&#x27;s human heritage is no less impressive than its natural diversity, with 259 listed buildings, 432 scheduled monuments and 3,883 Historic Environment Records.
*The Broads (11): Britain&#x27;s largest nationally protected wetland, the Norfolk and Suffolk Broads is considered to be the eleventh member of the national park family, but in fact was designated through its own Act of Parliament in 1988 gaining similar status to a national park. The Broads was not established as a national park, but was described at the time as having a &#x27;status equivalent to that of a national park&#x27;. It has since adopted the title &#x27;national park&#x27; and is a member of the UK national parks family, with the same level of landscape protection and an additional statutory purpose: to protect the interests of navigation. Its rivers, broads (shallow lakes), marshes and fens make this area rich in rare habitats, supporting myriad plants and animals. It is also one of Europe&#x27;s most popular inland waterways. There are six rivers (Bure, Ant, Thurne, Yare, Chet and Waveney) and 63 broads within the park, comprising over 125 miles (200 km) of navigable waterways. The How Hill National Nature Reserve is wholly contained within the boundaries of the park, as well as 28 Sites of Special Scientific Interest, most of which fall under the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands of International Importance.
*New Forest (12): England&#x27;s smallest national park was designated as a hunting ground by William the Conqueror almost 1,000 years before it became a national park and has its own section in the Domesday Book, in 1086. Originally the term &#x27;forest&#x27; referred to the designation as a hunting ground subject to forest law, not to a collection of trees and today less than half the national park is tree-covered (22,300 hectares). The rest is heather- and bracken-covered heath, open pasture, marsh, villages and coastline, and the park contains the largest remaining lowland heath in Europe as well as three quarters of Europe&#x27;s 120 lowland valley mires. 38,000 hectares of the park is covered by the historic &#x27;Perambulation&#x27; in which commoners’ rights apply and their animals can roam freely. Amongst the 700 species of wildflower in the forest grow the blue marsh gentian and the bog orchid and the park is the only place in Britain where the wild gladiolus grows. The park is home to five types of deer, all species of British newt, all three native species of British snake, the UK&#x27;s largest breeding population of the Dartford warbler, the rare southern damselfly with thirty colonies, thirteen native species of British bat and the New Forest cicada, rediscovered in 1962. The park also contains a wealth of human history with 214 scheduled monuments.
*South Downs (13): The most recently designated national park in the United Kingdom is a line of hills that run from Winchester in the west to Eastbourne in the east. The underlying geology of the eastern half, from the River Arun to Eastbourne, is mainly hills made of Chalk. To the west of the Arun, the area is wider and includes not only chalk hills but also part of the Weald made of sandstones and clay. Most of the rocks that make up the South Downs were formed 120 million years ago, uplifted by earth movements and pushed up into a huge dome about 125 miles long and 50 miles wide which was then worn away to form the North Downs, South Downs and the plain of the Weald. Amongst the key habitats overlaying this geology are chalk grassland, lowland heath and floodplain grazing marsh. The park rises to 280 metres at Blackdown in Sussex. The park has the highest population of any national park in the UK which at 107,929 is bigger than the next two largest combined (Lake District: 42,000 and Peak District: 38,000). The park has a wealth of cultural heritage from evidence in Boxgrove of the earliest humans, through to contemporary arts, such as Edward James’ collection of surrealist art at West Dean College. The park contains 600 scheduled monuments, over 5,000 listed buildings, two registered battlefields and 165 conservation areas.

===National parks in Wales===

*Snowdonia (3): The largest national park in Wales, it includes the highest mountain in Ireland, England and Wales, and Wales&#x27; largest natural lake. The area is steeped in culture and local history, where more than half its population speak Welsh. Fossil shell fragments on the summit of Snowdon date from over 500 million years ago and the ancient ‘Harlech Dome’ of which Snowdon and Cadair Idris form the northern and southern extents respectively, was created in the Cambrian Period before the volcanoes erupted. The more recent Ice Age glaciers were at their peak 18,000 years ago in Snowdonia and formed the distinctive U-shaped valleys including Llanberis and Nant Gwynant in the north and Tal-y-llyn Lake in the south.
*Pembrokeshire Coast (5): The only UK national park recognised primarily for its coastline, it covers almost all the Pembrokeshire Coast, every offshore island, the Daugleddau estuary and large areas of the Preseli Hills and the Gwaun Valley. It is an ecologically rich area recognised as of international importance for a wide range of high quality habitats and rare species. The park contains thirteen Special Areas of Conservation, five Special Protection Areas, one of three UK marine nature reserves and seven national nature reserves as well as sixty Sites of Special Scientific Interest. The park also contains a wealth of human history and culture, including the UK&#x27;s smallest city, St Davids and Iron Age forts. Within the park there are also a total of sixty geological conservation sites ranging from small roadside quarries and isolated crags on hilltops to many kilometres of coastline.
*Brecon Beacons (10): The last of the original ten national parks to have been designated in the 1950s, the park straddles the divide between rural mid Wales and industrial South Wales. It is formed from sedimentary rocks from the mid Ordovician through to the late Carboniferous though it is the Devonian Old Red Sandstone which is the rock most identified with the park, since it forms the larger part of the different mountain massifs including South Wales&#x27; highest point Pen y Fan at 886m. Like many other upland national parks in the UK, it is glacial activity during the Quaternary ice ages which is responsible for many of the well-known landforms. The west of the park is also designated as Fforest Fawr Geopark in recognition of its geological interest, and includes Waterfall Country. A number of former tramroads and the Monmouthshire and Brecon Canal running down the Usk valley dating from the Industrial Revolution now serve as recreational facilities.

===National parks in Scotland===

*Loch Lomond and The Trossachs: The park, the fourth largest in the United Kingdom, includes 21 Munros (including Ben Lomond, Ben Lui, Beinn Challuim, Ben More and two peaks called Ben Vorlich) and 20 Corbetts. There are two forest parks (Queen Elizabeth Forest Park and Argyll Forest Park), and two national nature reserves.
*Cairngorms: The largest national park in the United Kingdom, the heart of it is the eponymous mountain range, the Cairngorms, but these mountains form only one part of it, alongside other hill ranges such as the Angus Glens and the Monadhliath, and lower areas like Strathspey and upper Deeside. Three major rivers rise in the park: the Spey, the Dee, and the Don.

===National parks in Northern Ireland===
There are currently no national parks in Northern Ireland though there have been controversial moves to establish one in the Mourne Mountains. If established, it would stretch from Carlingford Lough to Newcastle and Slieve Croob.

==Development and land use planning in national parks==
National park authorities are the strategic and local planning authorities for their areas, so that the local district or unitary councils do not exercise planning control in an area covered by a national park. Consequently, they have to perform all the duties of a local planning authority.

They are responsible for maintaining the local development framework — the spatial planning guide for their area. They also grant planning consent for development, within the constraints of the Framework. This gives them very strong direct control over residential and industrial development, and the design of buildings and other structures; as well as strategic matters such as mineral extraction.

The national park authorities&#x27; planning powers vary only slightly from other authorities, but the policies and their interpretation are stricter than elsewhere. This is supported and encouraged by the government who regard:
:&quot;National Park designation as conferring the highest status of protection as far as landscape and scenic beauty are concerned.&quot; The Countryside — Environmental Quality and Economic and Social Development (1997)

==Contribution to the local economy==
Tourism is an important part of the economy of the regions which contain national parks. Through attractions, shops and accommodation, visitors provide an income and a livelihood to local employers and farmers. This income provides jobs for the park. For example, within the Peak District National Park the estimate in 2004 for visitor spending is £185 million, which supports over 3,400 jobs, representing 27% of total employment in the national park.

==Conflicts in national parks==
The national park authorities have two roles: to conserve and enhance the park, and to promote its use by visitors. These two objectives cause frequent conflicts between the needs of different groups of people. It is estimated that the national parks of England and Wales receive 110 million visitors each year. Most of the time it is possible to achieve both the original two purposes by good management. Occasionally a situation arises where access for the public is in direct conflict with conservation. Following the ethos of the Sandford Principle, the Environment Act 1995 sets down how a priority may be established between conservation and recreational use. Similar provision has been made for Scottish national parks.

Although recreation and tourism bring many benefits to an area, they can also bring a number of problems. The national funding offered to national park authorities is partly in recognition of the extra difficulties created in dealing with these conflicts.
; Congestion of villages and beauty spots : Some of the most popular &quot;honeypot&quot; areas attract large numbers of visitors, resulting in overcrowded car parks, blocked roads, and overstretched local facilities, particularly on Sundays in the summer and on bank holidays. Examples include the areas near Keswick in the Lake District, Castleton and Bakewell in the Peak District, and Betws-y-Coed in Snowdonia.
; Erosion : Hill-walking and use of other public rights-of-way is an extremely popular use of all the national parks. Heavy use of the most popular paths leads to considerable erosion, but strengthening of paths can be unsightly. Particularly heavy wear is caused by sponsored walks, walks promoted by national books and magazines, by horse riding on unsurfaced bridleways, mountain biking and use of off-road vehicles on green lanes. Examples include Dovedale in the Peak District. Over-grazing, for example, by sheep on hill and moorland areas, can also reduce vegetation, leading to increased erosion.
; Damage and disturbance to wildlife : Wildlife may be disturbed by the level of use within some of the areas of the parks that are open to the public. Moorland and chalk downland is easily damaged by regular use, and takes many years to recover. Moorland birds in particular nest and roost on the ground and are therefore especially sensitive. Dog walking, orienteering, mountain biking and hang gliding are typical activities which are likely to cause disturbance to nesting birds.
; Litter : Litter of all kinds is unsightly and can also cause pollution and harm to livestock and wild animals. Broken glass is a danger to people and, by focusing the rays of the sun, a possible cause of fire, particularly in areas of moorland such as Exmoor, parts of the Peak District and the North York Moors.
; Damage to farmland : Trampling of grass meadows reduces the amount of winter feed for farm animals. Walkers who stray from footpaths may climb over fences or dry stone walls rather than looking out for the stiles that often mark the course of footpaths across farmland. Sheep can be injured or even killed by dogs not under proper control, especially at lambing time.
; Local community displacement : Gift shops and cafés which cater for the needs of tourists are often more profitable than shops selling everyday goods for local people (such as butchers or bakers). In some villages where tourist shops are in the majority and there are few shops catering for the local people, the local community may feel pushed out by the tourists. Houses are often very expensive in tourist villages as there is demand for them as second homes or holiday homes by holiday cottage firms or well-off people who live elsewhere, or who move to a local home from which they commute to work, making them unaffordable for local people. This is a particular problem in areas within easy commuting distance of large cities, such as the Peak District, the Lake District, the Yorkshire Dales, and the New Forest and South Downs.
; Conflict between recreational users : Some forms of use of national parks interfere with other uses. For example, use of high-speed boats causes noise pollution, and conflicts with other uses such as boat trips, yachting, canoeing, and swimming. A bylaw imposing a 10 knot speed limit came into force on Windermere on 29 March 2005. The new speed limit for Windermere effectively prohibited speedboats and water skiing in the Lake District. Of the 16 larger lakes in the Lake District, only Windermere, Coniston Water, Derwent Water and Ullswater have a public right of navigation; speed limits were imposed on the three lakes other than Windermere in the 1970s and 1980s.

==Other designated landscapes==

The United Kingdom has a number of other designated landscape areas besides its national parks. Most similar to the parks are Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty which differ in part because of their more limited opportunities for extensive outdoor recreation. Dartmoor, the Lake District, North York Moors and the Yorkshire Dales all abut AONBs and in addition the coasts of Exmoor and the North York Moors coincide with heritage coasts. All the Parks contain in varying numbers Sites of Special Scientific Interest and national nature reserves. A part of the Brecon Beacons National Park is also designated as one of the UNESCO Global Geoparks. Of the various World Heritage Sites in England and Wales, one – the Lake District – is wholly coincident with a national park whilst a part of the Blaenavon Industrial Landscape World Heritage Site falls within the Brecon Beacons National Park and parts of the Castles and Town Walls of King Edward in Gwynedd and of the Slate Landscape of Northwest Wales fall within Snowdonia National Park.

<text>A Campingflight to Lowlands Paradise (commonly called Lowlands or Lowlands Festival), is an annual three-day music and performing arts festival, held in the Netherlands. The festival is held east of Amsterdam in Biddinghuizen, at Spijk en Bremerberg, which is adjacent to Walibi Holland.

Although the main focus is on music - rock, pop, dance, hip hop and alternative - Lowlands also offers indoor and outdoor cinema, (street) theatre, cabaret and stand-up, ballet, literature and comic strips.

In recent years, the festival is attended by around 55,000 visitors, and features over 200 acts on more than ten stages every year which are named according to the NATO phonetic alphabet apart from the Heineken stage (named after the beer brewer Heineken, the main sponsor of the festival since 2015). The majority of stages are inside large tents to protect spectators against inclement weather, with the largest being approximately the size of a regulation football pitch.

==History==
===1967–1968: Origin and debacle===
The festival is a successor to one of the first Dutch pop festivals: &quot;A Flight to Lowlands Paradise&quot; that was organised in November 1967 by the Utrecht-based artist and painter Bunk Bessels. This festival took place in the Margriethal of Jaarbeurs Utrecht. The entry fee was 10 Dutch guilders (approximately €4.50), including breakfast. This 18-hour-long event had no top acts but included experimental theatre, dancing, poetry, films, body painting and massage.

On 28 December 1968, this festival was held a second time, postponed by a month from its original date of 23 November in an attempt to get Jimi Hendrix to attend the event. This could not be arranged, and other large acts such as Jeff Beck and Jethro Tull were cancelled. However, Pink Floyd remained on the bill. In the end, the show was sold out to its capacity of 18,000 visitors, though many attendees were unable to get inside resulting in unrest and police intervention.

===1993–1997: Revival and growth===

In August 1993 the first edition of &quot;A Campingflight To Lowlands Paradise&quot; takes place after Willem Venema revived it. Weather conditions are moderate: barely 15 degrees Celsius and rain on Friday and Sunday being the best day with a maximum of 18 degrees Celsius. Tickets were bought at the entrance for 75 guilders and people receive a drawn floor plan. People are allowed to put up a tent to the left after the entrance with behind it a camping shop. The festival site consists of nothing more than a small stage tent and a larger one. People visit the festival for Rage Against the Machine and on Saturday Urban Dance Squad. Organizer Mojo Concerts aims for 10,000 visitors, but only 7,000 finally visit the festival. A month prior the festival was almost canceled because of messy organization and slow ticket sales. However, Mojo continued and made sure the line-up consisted of big names. This was partly possible because Lowlands is programmed in the same weekend as Pukkelpop (Belgium) and Reading (Great Britain), so the big American rock bands didn&#x27;t have to come across for only one performance. 1994 was the first edition in which certain things would become characteristic for the following decades. Tents are named after the NATO phonetic alphabet: Alpha, Bravo, and Charlie. Peter te Bos, singer of rock band Claw Boys Claw and a graphic designer, takes care of the design and mascot: &quot;Rapid Razor Bob&quot; with a razor mouth. This style would stay the appearance of Lowlands for more than twenty years, until the collaboration ended in October 2016. Partly due to the extra tent, up to 12,500 people come to Lowlands, five thousand people more than the year before.

Rapid growth continues the next year in 1995: 20,000 people visit the festival. Different this year is that it becomes a broader cultural festival. The three tent for music from the year before (Alpha, Bravo, Charlie) are back, with a new tent for theatre called Delta and the Echo for comedy. For the first time ever the festival is sold out. Because of electricity issues, The Prodigy&#x27;s performance was delayed till later in the evening. Amsterdam hip hop group Osdorp Posse had their performance early Saturday evening in the Charlie tent. Frontman Def P shouts &quot;They should have fucking put us in the big tent, pull a fucking tent peg out of the ground and let the cancer ceiling collapse&quot;. Security people headed towards the Charlie tent to keep order. According to Def P it was a miracle that there were no deaths.

In 1996 Lowlands becomes a big &#x27;crossover&#x27; festival, showcasing many different types of genres like pop, rock, grunge, dance, house, hiphop and a lot in between. Side programming consisting of film and cabaret also expands. The festival grows to 31,000 visitors and the price of a ticket doubled since 1993 to 140 guilders (about 63,50 euros). There are more than 100 acts and 6 tents. Two new tents are introduced: Foxtrot and Golf. More different types of food is introduced, something which distinguishes Lowlands from other festivals. Instead of only fries and burgers, people can choose from Mexican, Spanish, Italian and Surinam cuisine, and even a separate stand for vegetarians. Sunday evening a few visitors pull over a few containers with squeezed oranges behind a juice stall, which start a big, meanwhile iconic, fight with orange peels.

In 1997 gabber is very popular and Lowlands decided to make place for Dj Dano, however, he quickly got beer thrown at him and stopped his performance in the Alpha early. It showed visitors of Lowlands drew a line in terms of the variety of music genres. Punkband Pennywise stops its performance after 20 minutes because a crowdsurfing girl falls and gets angry at the security shouting &quot;Why didn’t you catch that girl? I saw her breaking her arm, you damned motherfucker.&quot; after which security leaves and fans climb on stage in anarchy. The 1997 edition received 40,000 visitors, paying 145 guilders. In five years time, the festival grew in fivefold and is almost as big as older Pinkpop. Infrastructure can&#x27;t keep up and people complain it&#x27;s too crowded. However people and newspapers still praised the festival. Life of Agony released a CD of their unplugged set from the Lowlands Festival in 1997, entitled &quot;Unplugged at the Lowlands Festival &#x27;97&quot;.

===1998–2002: The &quot;bridge of death&quot; and end to rapid growth===
Instead of growing in amounts of tents, Lowlands needed to grow in surface area. In order to do this they crossed the trunk road in 1998 by building an improvised bridge and hosted the camping on the other side. The bridge nowadays has the nickname &quot;the bridge of death&quot; because it&#x27;s very hard for visitors to cross the bridge with their packaging and it became an icon for Lowlands. Also, for the first time ever, Lowlands stopped using the NATO phonetic alphabet for tent names to give priority to commercial parties. Delta became Dommelsch, named after the beer supplier. The 1998 edition received 45.000 visitors. On Friday evening, many people headed to the Alpha stage to see the Beastie Boys with their worldwide hit song Intergalactic. However, it was so crowded people in the front came under pressure and the show got stopped temporarily in order for the band to ask people to stop pushing and help other people get up.

In 1999 Lowlands reaches a state which shows many things at the terrain will remain the same for years ahead, because of maximum use of capacity. A new medium-sized tent called India is introduced for smaller pop and rock bands. The Dommelsch becomes an outdoor cinema after 23.00 and the night programming becomes more important as in almost all tents dj&#x27;s and parties keep going on till late. Lowlands also expands more on the cultural side with serious theatre, stand-up comedy and literature. About 58.000 people visit the festival and pay 160 guilders for a ticket. At the camping, a visitor climbs in a light pole but falls and doesn&#x27;t survive.

The ninth edition of Lowlands in 2000 starts with a minute of silence and a strict crowd-surfing prohibition because of the Roskilde incident, at which 9 people died at a Pearl Jam performance.

In 2001 even more people visit the festival, but maximum capacity seems reached, with 57.000 people. At the same time, this edition was the warmest ever (till 2012 beat the record) with 30 degrees Celsius on Sunday.
With the introduction of the euro, prices of Lowlands went up from 195 guilders (88,50) in 2001 to 97,50 euro in 2002, however prices had been raised anyway so the euro didn&#x27;t have much impact. 60,000 people visit the festival, but this seems too much. People complain about the crowdedness and weather conditions are bad. Festival director Eric van Eerdenburg, who had just been appointed, sees something needs to change in order to make Lowlands the festival people always loved.

===2003–2012: Needs for innovation and golden era===
In 2003, festival director Eric van Eerdenburg takes measures because Lowlands 2002 was too crowded and had a for many people disappointing line-up. For the first time ever the festival did not sell out and fewer people visited the festival, from 60.000 in 2002 to 48.000 in 2003. Ticket pricing goes from 97.50 euros to 107.50 euros which might have crossed a psychological limit. For the first time, biodegradable plastic is used. The Charlie tent disappears and the large Dommelsch stage is exchanged for a covered tent with the same name (this tent is later renamed to Grolsch in 2004 and to Heineken in 2015). Also, silent disco headphones are introduced.

A running gag takes over entire Lowlands in 2004: a year earlier, a boy named Theo Vlaar stepped out of the line at the entrance to pee, but upon his return, he lost his friends. They kept calling him and other people took over. This continued in 2004 and the years to come and shouting &quot;Theo!&quot; (or other random names) became part of Lowlands subculture. Just like in 2003, Lowlands does not sell out, but nonetheless 4,000 more people show up. 52,000 people visit the festival. For the first time there is a deposit on plastic cups. When handing in a few, people earn a coin (about 2 euros).

In 2005 Lowlands is doing better and makes good progress, also because the festival was shifted a week forward, from the last to the third weekend of August, because there are then more major international acts nearby. Lowlands sells out at the door.

A year later Lowlands is doing even better. In 2006, all tickets sell out a month prior. The X-ray is introduced, a dome of corrugated galvanised iron at which more experimental, border-seeking acts are programmed. Also the &quot;Magneetbar&quot; (Magnet bar) is introduced, a small tent for visitors to perform.

In 2007, the festival sells out again, but it takes a week longer than in 2006. The Magneetbar gets bigger because of its popularity. A year later in 2008, all tickets had been sold on 21 June. The festival was never sold out so quick.

For the first and last time ever, the ticket sales in 2010 start with a launch party. It seemed very effective as it took only 1 week in February to sell out all tickets. According to the organization, this was not the intention because loyal visitors didn&#x27;t have a fair chance.

In 2011 the financial crisis is still partly going on, and the First Rutte cabinet, which was appointed in October 2010, had to make major cuts. The culture sector was one of the main victims, including an increase in VAT on concert tickets as of January 1, 2011. Lowlands took measures and started the ticket sale way earlier in November 2010. This was a success and within 2 hours all tickets had been sold (after all the VAT increase was delayed by 6 months and after the fall of the First Rutte cabinet in April 2012, the VAT increase was reversed). For the first time in a decade Lowlands changes the terrain again. The Bravo tent is moved to make room for something new: the Titty Twïster, a strip club with literature at day and striptease performers at night.

With 27 degrees Celsius on Friday and even warmer temperatures on Saturday and Sunday, Lowlands 2012 becomes the warmest Lowlands ever. Foo Fighters was programmed to give a 2,5 hour lasting performance, but stopped after 2 hours because it was too warm.

===2013–present: Reinvention and new audience===

In January 2013, booking office Friendly Fire, a competitor of Lowlands organiser Mojo, announces a new three-day music festival called Best Kept Secret. The first four names - Arctic Monkeys, Portishead, Alt-J and Sigur Rós - show that Lowlands is no longer the only place for Indie music. However, it had no effect on this edition because just like the year before, the tickets (at 175 euro) sold out within two hours. On the Monday after the festival the message follows that an Amsterdam visitor who was found in a comatose state on a remote part of the grounds during the first night, later died in hospital. He had used ecstasy but it is not clear if that was the cause of death.

The following year in 2014 it took many times longer before Lowlands sold out. According to festival director Eric van Eerdenburg it seemed that &quot;a part of the older generation is dropping out&quot;. Big dance acts like Skrillex, Major Lazer and Disclosure create a new kind of audience, but at the same time repel the rock lovers for whom it was mainly intended a long time ago. Another explanation for the declining interest in that group may be that Lowlands organizer Mojo was setting up a new festival called Down the Rabbit Hole, a cuddlier version with more attention for alternative music. Lowlands abolishes the deposit-return system on plastic mugs after years of complaints about people who mainly come to the festival to collect mugs and allegedly use them to collect around 1,000 euros a day, and in some cases are also guilty of pickpocketing and theft.

In advance of 2015, it is predicted that this 23rd edition will be crucial for the future of Lowlands. Some of the loyal visitors are dropping out and the festival ends up in a quarterlife crisis. Domestic and foreign competition on the festival market, causing audiences to stay away and big acts to charge ever higher amounts of money, makes festival director Eric van Eerdenburg &quot;terribly&quot; worried. Lowlands does not sell out, for the first time since 2004. Just over 48,000 people come to the festival, which has a capacity of 55,000 people. Small changes take place on the site: the smaller tents Charlie and Lima swap places and the Tïtty Twïster disappears after four years. The two largest tents, the Alpha and the Bravo, are made a bit smaller to make them more cosy. The third beer supplier in Lowlands history makes its appearance: after Dommelsch (1993–2003) and Grolsch (2004–2014) the organisation now signs a contract with Heineken.

In 2017, Hansje van Halem was appointed head designer of the Lowlands festival identity after 20 years of collaboration between designer Peter te Bos and Lowlands.

<text>USS &quot;Philippine Sea&quot; (CG-58) is a Flight II &quot;Ticonderoga&quot;-class guided missile cruiser on active service in the United States Navy. She is named for the Battle of the Philippine Sea during World War II and is the second ship to bear the name. She has completed multiple deployments as part of Operation Enduring Freedom from 2001 to 2014.

==Operational history==
&quot;Philippine Sea&quot; was built by Bath Iron Works in Bath, Maine. Her keel was laid on 8 April 1986 and she was launched on 12 July 1987. Upon completion of her sea-trials after construction, &quot;Philippine Sea&quot; transferred to the Atlantic Fleet and was commissioned on 18 March 1989 in Portland, Maine. Her initial homeport was Naval Station Mayport, Florida.

In 2003, the ship was assigned to Cruiser-Destroyer Group 12.

In 2010, the ship failed her initial Board of Inspection and Survey (INSURV) inspection. On 7 May 2011, &quot;Philippine Sea&quot; departed Mayport for a scheduled overseas deployment to the U.S. Fifth Fleet and U.S. Sixth Fleet Area of Responsibility. On 3 June 2011, &quot;Philippine Sea&quot; paid a port visit to Kiel, Germany, prior to participating with the multi-national exercise Baltic Operations 2011 (BALTOPS-2011). This exercise included naval units from the United States, Russian, Danish, Polish and French navies, and BALTOPS-2011 ended on 21 June 2011. On 6 July 2011, &quot;Philippine Sea&quot; rescued 26 Filipino crew members from the Marshall Islands-owned, Liberian-flagged supertanker &quot;Brillante Virtuoso&quot; southwest of Aden, Yemen, after the ship&#x27;s superstructure was set on fire following a reported attack by pirates using rocket-propelled grenades (RPG). &quot;Philippine Sea&quot; transited the Suez Canal on 1 July 2011.

The cremated remains of Neil Armstrong, the first man to walk on the Moon, were buried at sea from the warship on 14 September 2012, in the Atlantic Ocean.

Starting on 23 September 2014, USS &quot;Philippine Sea&quot; fired Tomahawk missiles in the Persian Gulf at sites in Syria, targeting Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant&#x27;s command-and-control centers, training camps and weapons depots. The operation was expected to last several hours, with the first explosions from Tomahawk missiles heard near Raqqa in northern Syria. The USS &quot;Philippine Sea&quot; was part of the carrier strike group. In May 2021, the cruiser&#x27;s homeport was shifted to Naval Station Norfolk, Virginia.

===2023 Israel-Hamas war===
On 14 October 2023, Lloyd Austin directed and her carrier strike group, which includes &quot;Philippine Sea&quot;, and destroyers , and , to the eastern Mediterranean in response to Israel&#x27;s war with Hamas. This is the second carrier strike group to be sent to the region in response to the conflict, following and her group, which was dispatched only six days earlier.

===United States–Houthi conflict (2023–present)===

On 12 January 2024, &quot;Philippine Sea&quot;, &quot;Mason&quot; and &quot;Gravely&quot; fired Tomahawk cruise missiles at Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen. Aircraft from Carrier Air Wing Three, embarked on the carrier &quot;Dwight D. Eisenhower&quot; also participated in the strikes.

<doc id="764398" wikidata="Q1461304" url="?curid=764398" title="USS Princeton (CG-59)">
<text>USS &quot;Princeton&quot; (CG-59) is a guided missile cruiser serving in the United States Navy. Armed with naval guns and anti-air, anti-surface, and anti-submarine missiles, plus other weapons, she is equipped for surface-to-air, surface-to-surface, and anti-submarine warfare. She was previously home to two SH-60B LAMPS Mk III Seahawk helicopters and now carries a pair of the MH-60R version of the Seahawk. This warship is named for the Revolutionary War victories over the British by George Washington in and around the town of Princeton, New Jersey.

&quot;Princeton&quot; was the first &quot;Ticonderoga&quot;-class cruiser to carry the upgraded AN/SPY-1B radar system.

==Operational history==

The ship was commissioned on 11 February 1989 in the Ingalls shipyard in Pascagoula, Mississippi. After traveling through the Panama Canal, &quot;Princeton&quot; was home-ported at the Long Beach Naval Station, California.

===Vladivostok port visit===
In 1990, &quot;Princeton&quot; served as the flagship for the first US Navy visit to the Soviet Union&#x27;s Pacific port of Vladivostok since before World War II. She sailed with . Before the visit was completed, the crew received word that their Pacific cruise was canceled. They returned to Long Beach and joined the Battle Group preparing to deploy to the Persian Gulf.

===Mine strike===

On the morning of 18 February 1991, during Operation Desert Storm, &quot;Princeton&quot; was patrolling off Failaka Island in the Persian Gulf, on the west side of the decoy United States Marine Corps and naval invasion forces afloat. At exactly 7:15 AM local time two Italian-made MN103 Manta bottom-mounted influence mines detonated, one just under the port rudder and the other just forward of the starboard bow, the second explosion most likely being a sympathetic detonation caused by the first. The blasts cracked the superstructure, buckled three lines in the hull, jammed the port rudder, flooded the #3 switchboard room through chilled water pipe cracks, and damaged the starboard propeller shaft. Three crewmembers were injured, one seriously. Despite the severe damage, the forward weapons and the AEGIS combat system were back online within 15 minutes.

At great peril, the Canadian destroyer moved north through the minefield to deliver damage-control supplies to the severely damaged &quot;Princeton&quot;, which remained on station for 31 hours until she was relieved. &quot;Princeton&quot;″s commanding officer, Captain Edward Hontz, specifically requested the assistance of &quot;Athabaskan&quot; despite the latter not originally assigned to the area. Unlike most ships of her size, &quot;Athabaskan&quot; could simultaneously operate two large CH-124 Sea King helicopters, which could search out mines for long periods. As a gesture of solidarity, &quot;Athabaskan&quot; winched over several cases of beer for the crew of &quot;Princeton&quot;, since United States Navy vessels were dry.

&quot;Princeton&quot;, which suffered from a locked starboard propeller shaft and a locked port rudder, was guided through the minefield by the minesweeper . Temporary repairs were conducted first in Bahrain, and then in the port of Jebel Ali near Dubai by the duty destroyer tender , and finally in a Dubai drydock. After eight weeks, &quot;Princeton&quot; returned to the United States under the ship&#x27;s power for additional repairs. The ship and her crew were awarded the Combat Action Ribbon.

Captain Edward Hontz turned over command to Captain J. Cutler Dawson before moving on to command the Aegis Training Command in Dahlgren, Virginia. Future Chief of Naval Operations, Michael M. Gilday was serving aboard &quot;Princeton&quot; as an officer during the ordeal, and was awarded the Navy Commendation Medal with Valor for his actions.

When the U.S. Naval Base in Long Beach was closed due to BRAC action, the home port of &quot;Princeton&quot; was moved to Naval Base San Diego. &quot;Princeton&quot; was overhauled from 1999 to 2000 in San Diego, California. In 2003, the ship was assigned to Carrier Strike Group Three.

===&quot;Princeton&quot; aerial object incident===
While training in the Pacific Ocean, in November 2004 &quot;Princeton&quot; tracked unidentified flying objects that were capable of accelerating and maneuvering at extraordinary speeds. &quot;Princeton&quot; subsequently contacted two Navy F/A-18F fighters from who tracked and filmed their interactions with the objects. The incident was publicly disclosed in December 2017 with the revelation of the funding of the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program.

===&quot;Hamid&quot; rescue===
On 21 July 2005, &quot;Princeton&quot; responded to a radio call from an Iranian dhow, named &quot;Hamid&quot;, that was dead in the water and in need of engineering assistance. A rescue and assistance team was dispatched to &quot;Hamid&quot; where it was determined that the engine would not start due to corroded batteries that were low on power. The batteries were removed and brought back to &quot;Princeton&quot; for maintenance, cleaning and recharging. &quot;Princeton&quot; rescue team restored power onboard &quot;Hamid&quot;, restarted the engines, and then provided minor medical assistance and fresh water to the dhow&#x27;s crew.

===Man overboard incident===
In 2005, the warship was acting as an escort for Carrier Strike Group Eleven, led by &quot;Nimitz&quot;, and was featured in the documentary &quot;Carrier&quot;. While in the Persian Gulf on the night of 12 September 2005, or the early morning of 13 September, during the filming of the documentary, a sailor fell overboard. Despite a search lasting over five days, and covering a area, the sailor was not found.

===&quot;Magellan Star&quot;===

<doc id="764399" wikidata="Q233322" url="?curid=764399" title="Giulietta Simionato">
<text>Giulietta Simionato (born Giulia Simionato; Forlì, Romagna, 12 May 1910 – Rome, 5 May 2010) was an Italian mezzo-soprano. Her career spanned the period from the 1930s until her retirement in 1966.

==Life==
As a girl she studied in a boarding school with nuns who sensed her musical qualities and invited her to study singing, which she did against the opposition of the family, especially her mother. After the latter&#x27;s death, Giulietta studied first in Rovigo, then in Padua. Her singing debut was in the 1927 musical comedy &quot;Nina, Don&#x27;t Be Stupid&quot; (&quot;Nina, non far la stupida&quot;) with music by (Gian Capo) and lyrics by . The following year she made her operatic debut at Montagnana. In 1933 she won the first &quot;bel canto competition&quot; in Florence against 385 competitors and got an audition at the Teatro alla Scala, Milan. The result was positive, but the artistic director Fabbroni found her voice still immature and invited her to return a few years later. Two years later she was put under contract. In 1928 she sang in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Rigoletto&quot;. The first fifteen years of her career were frustrating, it seems because she was not supported by the fascist regime. She was only given minor roles and her career struggled to take off, but by the late 1940s she had attracted growing attention. In 1936, she had made her debut at La Scala and appeared there regularly between 1936 and 1966. By then, Simionato was recognised as one of the most respected singers of her generation. She had made her debut at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden in 1953, where she likewise appeared regularly between 1963 and 1965.

Simionato made her United States opera debut in 1953 as Charlotte in Jules Massenet&#x27;s &quot;Werther&quot; at the San Francisco Opera with Cesare Valletti in the title role. In 1959 she made her debut at the Metropolitan Opera, as Azucena in &quot;Il Trovatore&quot;, with Carlo Bergonzi, Antonietta Stella, and Leonard Warren. Simionato also appeared at the Edinburgh Festival (1947), the San Francisco Opera (1953), the Teatro Nacional de São Carlos (1954), the Lyric Opera of Chicago (1954–1961), the Vienna State Opera (from 1956), and the Salzburg Festival. 
In 1957, she sang in &quot;Anna Bolena&quot; with Maria Callas. In 1961, she withdrew from three performances at the Metropolitan Opera, with Trigeminal Neuralgia.

Simionato had a large repertory including Rossini&#x27;s Rosina and Cinderella, Charlotte in &quot;Werther&quot;, and &quot;Carmen&quot;. She also excelled in the Verdian repertoire, as Amneris, Eboli and Azucena, and as Santuzza in Mascagni&#x27;s &quot;Cavalleria rusticana&quot;.

She was a major recording artist, and in addition many of her performances gained live radio broadcast or were captured on film. Fono has gathered her recordings on the CD, &quot;The Color of a Voice&quot;. She retired in 1966, and married Dr. Cesare Frugoni.

She continued to inspire admiration through teaching and various directorial positions, with amazing vitality even in her 90s. She was featured in Daniel Schmid&#x27;s award-winning 1984 documentary film &quot;Il Bacio di Tosca&quot; (&quot;Tosca&#x27;s Kiss&quot;) about a home for retired opera singers founded by Giuseppe Verdi. She also appeared in an interview by Stefan Zucker in Jan Schmidt-Garre&#x27;s 1999 film, &quot;Opera Fanatic&quot;.

She died in Rome at age 99.

<text>In parallel computing, the Geometric Arithmetic Parallel Processor (GAPP), invented by Polish mathematician Włodzimierz Holsztyński in 1981, was patented by Martin Marietta and is now owned by Silicon Optix, Inc. The GAPP&#x27;s network topology is a mesh-connected array of single-bit SIMD processing elements (PEs), where each PE can communicate with its neighbor to the north, east, south, and west. Each cell has its own memory. The space of addresses is the same for all cells. The data travels from the cell memories to the cell registers, and in the opposite direction, in parallel. Characteristically, the cell&#x27;s arithmetic logic unit (ALU) (that is, its PE) in the early versions of GAPP was nothing but a 1-bit full-adder/subtractor, which efficiently served both the complex arithmetic as well as logical functions, and with the help of shifts it served also the geometric transformations—in short, it was doing all three types of the tasks (while other designs used three separate hardware special-purpose units instead).

The 10,000-element GAPP grew to 82,944 elements by 1992. 
In its most recent incarnation (as of 2004), the systems by Teranex utilize GAPP arrays of up to 294,912 processing elements.

In mathematics, Holsztyński is known for Holsztyński theorem.

<doc id="764401" wikidata="Q3309251" url="?curid=764401" title="Michel Chartrand">
<text>Michel Chartrand (20 December 1916 – 12 April 2010) was a Canadian trade union leader from Quebec.

Born in Outremont and trained as a typography and print worker, Chartrand became involved in union activism in the 1940s. During the &quot;Grande Noirceur&quot;, he took part in major strike actions such as the Asbestos strike in 1949, the in 1952 and the Murdochville strike in 1957. In 1968, he became president of the Montreal central council of the Confédération des syndicats nationaux (CSN). In 1970, during the October crisis, he was arrested without a warrant and put in jail for four months. He was president of the CSN Montreal central council until 1978.

During the 1980s, he took action for the rights of injured workers; he created the &quot;Fondation pour l’aide aux travailleuses et travailleurs accidentés&quot; (FATA) in 1984. He promoted progressive values and syndicalism in the media until the end of his life. He endorsed Québec solidaire.

Chartrand is considered to have been a promoter of socialism, a severe critic of capitalism, and a leading figure of syndicalism in Quebec. He was married to feminist writer and union activist Simonne Monet-Chartrand.

==Education==
Born on 20 December 1916 in the Montreal neighbourhood of Outremont, he studied at Collège Jean-de-Brébeuf secondary school and collège Sainte-Thérèse. In 1933, he trained to be a Trappist monk, but left after two years and worked with a Roman Catholic Church youth movement. In the 1939 Quebec election, he campaigned for the Action libérale nationale (ALN) party. In 1940, he enrolled in a history course at the Université de Montréal taught by Lionel Groulx, a Quebec nationalist Roman Catholic priest.

Chartrand is reported to have joined the Canadian Officer Training Corps in 1941 following the outbreak of World War II in September 1939. This program, conducted across Canada, allowed university students to be credited with military service while continuing their studies without being posted to active duty. Chartrand protested that the Canadian Army documents were only in the English language and returned to the Trappists&#x27; monastery in the village of Oka, Quebec.

In a 1994 interview, Suzette Rouleau, Pierre Trudeau&#x27;s sister, described engaging in a fist fight with Chartrand, to prevent him bullying her baby brother, when they were all teenagers.

==Opponent of conscription==
Following the federal government&#x27;s 1942 announcement of a national plebiscite on military conscription, Michel Chartrand became an outspoken opponent and joined the Bloc populaire canadien movement to campaign against conscription.

In February 1942, he was married to Simonne Monet by Lionel Groulx at the Notre-Dame Basilica. By the time the Parliament of Canada put conscription in place in November 1944, Chartrand was the father of three children.

In the 1945 federal election, he was the Bloc Populaire candidate in the Chambly-Rouville riding. He lost in a landslide to his Liberal Party of Canada opponent.

==Seeking elected office==
In 1948, his fifth child was born, and the following year he went to the Asbestos Region to participate in the Asbestos strike by local mine workers. In 1950, he became active with the executive committee of the Catholic Workers Confederation of Canada (CTCC). Involved with a number of union operations, in 1953 Chartrand became a salaried member of the union&#x27;s executive committee. After internal disputes, he was fired from his job. However, after appealing the decision, a tribunal under Pierre Trudeau reinstated him.

In 1954, Chartrand stood for election to the post of secretary-general of the union but was defeated by Jean Marchand. In 1956, he joined the Cooperative Commonwealth Federation (CCF), a social democratic federal political party headed in Quebec by Thérèse Casgrain. Chartrand was appointed a Quebec delegate to the party&#x27;s convention in Winnipeg, Manitoba. As a result, a Quebec branch of the party was organized under the name Parti social démocratique du Québec. Chartrand was the party&#x27;s candidate in the Chambly riding in the 1956 provincial election, but was badly defeated. His union duties involved numerous high-profile strikes, and he was seen by some as a future leader of the movement and was leader of the party from 1957 until 1960.

Chartrand ran for the CCF in the Longueuil district in the 1953 and 1957 federal elections. He finished third with 11.1% and 5.4% of the vote. He also ran for the same party in the Lapointe district (town of Arvida, Quebec) in the 1958 federal election. Despite a strong union base, he nevertheless finished third with 24.3% of the vote. In 1959, Chartrand tried again for public office, running in a Quebec provincial by-election in Lac Saint-Jean, Quebec for the Social Democratic Party, but once again finished third with 21.8% of the vote. His frustration became evident through his increasingly extremist statements, and in 1959, the union forced him to resign from its executive committee. He was then hired to work at the printing office of the Parti social-démocratique, and was again a delegate to the CCF&#x27;s convention in Winnipeg.

==Peace advocacy and socialism==
In 1960, the Confederation of Catholic Workers of Canada changed its name to the Confédération des syndicats nationaux (CSN). Chartrand took part in the peace movement, participating in demonstrations and marches against nuclear proliferation and other causes. An admirer of the communist revolution in Cuba and its leader Fidel Castro, in 1963 Chartrand accompanied a group on a month-long visit to Cuba. On his return to Quebec, he called Cuba &quot;a paradise&quot; and held it out as a symbol of what Quebec should become. Chartrand then helped found the Parti socialiste du Québec (Socialist Party of Quebec), and, as its president, soon began supporting the Quebec sovereignty movement, the Rassemblement pour l&#x27;indépendance nationale (RIN).

==Involvement for Quebec independence==
In 1968, Michel Chartrand was elected president of the Montreal Central Council of the Confédération des syndicats nationaux, serving in that position until 1978. By the end of the 1960s, his views became more resolved. As a member of the Quebec Independence movement, Chartrand staunchly supported the Front de libération du Québec (FLQ).

During the October Crisis, when asked by a reporter about the ordeal the family of kidnapped British trade commissioner James Cross was being put through, Chartrand stated: &quot;I have no more sympathy for Mrs. Cross than for the wives of thousands of men without jobs in Quebec at the present time.&quot; Even after the murder of Quebec vice-premier Pierre Laporte, Chartrand remained steadfast in his beliefs, and proved it by bailing FLQ leader Charles Gagnon out of jail, paying nearly three thousand dollars of his own money. On 15 October 1975, five years after the October Crisis, FLQ and Front de rassemblement d&#x27;action populaire members and supporters met at the Paul-Sauvé Centre in Montreal where Michel Chartrand addressed the crowd.

In the 1998 Quebec election, he again ran for political office. He represented the Rassemblement pour l&#x27;alternative progressiste (now Québec solidaire) against Lucien Bouchard in Jonquière, finishing third with 14 per cent of the votes.

==In film==
Michel Chartrand and Simonne Monet&#x27;s lives were the subject of a television mini-series entitled &quot;Chartrand et Simonne&quot;. Chartrand was also the subject of a 1991 National Film Board of Canada documentary &quot;Un homme de parole&quot;. Earlier, in 1994, Michel Chartrand appeared besides former FLQ members Charles Gagnon and Pierre Vallieres, in a documentary directed by Jean Daniel Lafond, &quot;La liberté en colère&quot;.

He also had a small acting role in the 1970 comedy film &quot;Two Women in Gold (Deux femmes en or)&quot;.

==Death==
Chartrand died on 12 April 2010 from kidney cancer. The Parc régional de Longueuil was renamed Parc Michel-Chartrand by the city of Longueuil in June 2010.

<doc id="764402" wikidata="Q751462" url="?curid=764402" title="USS Normandy">
<text>USS &quot;Normandy&quot; (CG-60) is a &quot;Ticonderoga&quot;-class guided-missile cruiser in the service of the United States Navy. Armed with naval guns and anti-air, anti-surface, and anti-submarine missiles, plus other weapons, she is equipped for surface-to-air, surface-to-surface, and anti-submarine warfare. The cruiser was the first US warship since 1945 to go to war on her maiden cruise, and in 1998 was awarded the title &quot;Most Tomahawks shot by a U.S. Navy Cruiser&quot;. She is named for the World War II Battle of Normandy, which took place in France on, and following, D-Day.

==Construction==
&quot;Normandy&quot; was laid down at Bath Iron Works, Bath, Maine, on 7 April 1987, launched on 19 March 1988, and commissioned on 9 December 1989. She is homeported in Norfolk, Virginia.

==Service history==
===Gulf War===
Just one year after her commissioning in Newport, Rhode Island, &quot;Normandy&quot; sailed into action in order to support the multinational effort to free Kuwait. &quot;Normandy&quot; and her crew left on 28 December 1990 to join United Nations forces conducting Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm. As part of the Battle Group, &quot;Normandy&quot; transited the Suez Canal and the Red Sea on her way to the Persian Gulf. &quot;Normandy&quot; fired 26 Tomahawk cruise missiles, protected allied ships and aircraft in the area, conducted maritime interdiction operations, and helped to locate and destroy enemy mines. She was the first US warship since 1945 to go to war on her maiden cruise.

===Adriatic Operations===
On 11 August 1995, &quot;Normandy&quot; and the Battle Group deployed to the Adriatic Sea in support of United Nations efforts with the war-torn Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. &quot;Normandy&quot;″s primary duty was Adriatic air-space controller for Operations Provide Promise, Deny Flight, and Sharp Guard.

===50th Anniversary of D-Day===
In a historic first, &quot;Normandy&quot; embarked nine World War II veterans on 18 May 1994, for commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the Allied landings on the coast of France. These activities took place in Portsmouth, England, until 31 May, ending in Le Havre, France. Over 15,000 visitors toured the ship while &quot;Normandy&quot;″s honor guard embarked veterans participated in various memorial services and events on both sides of the English Channel. &quot;Normandy&quot; served as a centerpiece over the two-week course of ceremonies, and specifically for national commemorations at Slapton Sands, United Kingdom, on 31 May, by U.S. Ambassador Crowe, and at the Normandy beachheads on 6 June, by President Bill Clinton.

On 27 June 1994, &quot;Normandy&quot; participated in the Naval Station New York closing ceremonies. Staten Island&#x27;s Borough President, Guy Molinari, and his daughter Congresswoman Susan Molinari were the featured speakers as the Navy turned the base over to the city&#x27;s Emergency Services. After four years homeported at Staten Island, New York, &quot;Normandy&quot; departed for her new homeport of Norfolk, Virginia.

===Operation Deliberate Force===
On 28 August 1995, &quot;Normandy&quot; began a six-month deployment to the Mediterranean with &quot;America&quot;. On 8 September, &quot;Normandy&quot; was in the Western Mediterranean conducting turnover with the outgoing battle group. After receiving immediate tasking to proceed at best speed to the Adriatic, &quot;Normandy&quot; sped across the at maximum speed. Arriving in the Operation Deliberate Force theater of operations on 10 September, &quot;Normandy&quot; launched a 13 Tomahawk missile strike against hostile air defense command and control sites in Lisina, Bosnia-Herzegovina, north of the Bosnian Serb stronghold of Banja Luka, between 20:40 and 20:45. The cruiser used a new type of Tomahawk missile, the Block-III model, which included for the first time GPS guidance in combination with its TERCOM system based on topographic maps. This gave flexibility and speed to the attack. This precision strike, flawlessly executed on extremely short notice, paved the way for follow-on tactical air strikes against Bosnian Serb military positions in the region. This action sent a strong signal of United States resolve and played a significant role in convincing the Bosnian Serb government to cease hostilities and resume peace negotiations. During the six-month deployment &quot;Normandy&quot; again served as Adriatic air-space controller for Operation Deny Flight, Sharp Guard, and Decisive Endeavor.

===Exercise Bright Star and Operation Southern Watch===
On 3 October 1997, &quot;Normandy&quot; once again began a six-month deployment, this time as Air Defense Commander of the battle group. Throughout the month of October, &quot;Normandy&quot; participated, along with 27 other international units, in Exercise Bright Star off the Egyptian coast. Upon completion of Bright Star, &quot;Normandy&quot; was directed to proceed at best speed to the Persian Gulf.

Beginning 16 November, &quot;Normandy&quot;, along with other units of the &quot;George Washington&quot; battle group, transited the Suez Canal, Red Sea, Gulf of Oman, and Arabian Sea. In a record-setting five days, &quot;Normandy&quot; and &quot;George Washington&quot; entered the Persian Gulf and joined the Battle Group in an impressive show of force and United Nation resolve to Iraq. &quot;Normandy&quot; immediately assumed duties as the &quot;Ready Strike&quot; platform in the Gulf and, later, also assumed duties as the air-defense commander for the entire Persian Gulf. For four months &quot;Normandy&quot; patrolled the Gulf in support of Operation Southern Watch. During this time, she conducted several successful maritime-interception operations along with her strike and air-defense duties.

Throughout this deployment, &quot;Normandy&quot; achieved more than 300 mishap-free hours of flight operations, conducted 27 underway replenishments and sailed a total of . Underway for the holidays, &quot;Normandy&quot; hosted pop singer Paula Cole on 23 December. On Christmas morning, it hosted Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Jay L. Johnson, his wife, and Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy ETCM John Hagan. &quot;George Washington&quot;″s battle group was relieved by the Battle Group in the Persian Gulf, and &quot;Normandy&quot; returned to her homeport of Norfolk on 3 April 1998. &quot;Normandy&quot; finished a major overhaul period in Norfolk Naval Shipyard on 28 February.

=== 2023-24 Israel–Hamas war ===
On 8 October 2023, the day after the Hamas attack on Israel, the U.S. Secretary of Defense, Lloyd Austin, directed the carrier strike group to the Eastern Mediterranean in response. Along with the carrier, the group also includes &quot;Normandy&quot;, and the destroyers , , and .

On 24 January 2024, USS &quot;Normandy&quot; returns home to Norfolk from 8-month deployment. Over the course of 262 days, &quot;Normandy’s&quot; crew conducted over 40 replenishments-at-sea, and manned flight quarters 670 times. Normandy’s embarked air detachment, the “Spartans” of Helicopter Maritime Strike Squadron (HSM) 70, flew 393 sorties, totaling 1,132 hours flown. 

===Miscellaneous Activities===
On 8 May 1990, &quot;Normandy&quot; responded to a distress call by the destroyer off of the coast of Virginia. A major fuel oil fire erupted from the ship&#x27;s Forward Fire Room into the ship&#x27;s superstructure, isolating the crew forward and aft. Fire crews from the &quot;Normandy&quot; boarded &quot;Conyngham&quot; via small boat transfer and were instrumental in extinguishing the fire.

On 21 June 2000, &quot;Normandy&quot; and the &quot;George Washington&quot; Battle Group deployed to the Mediterranean and the Arabian Sea. On 19 December, &quot;Normandy&quot; returned to Norfolk just in time for the holidays.

On 20 June 2002, &quot;Normandy&quot; left the US East Coast on deployment. Again assigned to the &quot;George Washington&quot; Battle Group, &quot;Normandy&quot; returned to Norfolk in December 2002.

In 2003, the ship was assigned to Cruiser-Destroyer Group 2.

On 25 March 2005, &quot;Normandy&quot; left the East Coast with the assault ship ESG, deployed to the Mediterranean and Northern Persian Gulf. &quot;Normandy&quot; returned to Norfolk in October 2005.

In April 2007, &quot;Normandy&quot; deployed on her 7-month NATO cruise. The ship&#x27;s crew was awarded the Article 5 NATO Medal. She returned on Halloween after 200 days of showing the flag, in the process becoming the first ship to circumnavigate Africa. On this cruise, sailors on board earned their Bluenose and Emerald Shellback.

On 13 January 2010, &quot;Normandy&quot; was ordered to assist in humanitarian efforts following the 2010 Haiti earthquake.

On 20 May 2010, &quot;Normandy&quot; deployed to the Persian Gulf for a seven-month deployment. It returned on 12 December 2010, on a bitterly cold, snowy day.

In 2012, &quot;Normandy&quot; deployed for two months to the Baltic Sea in support of diplomatic relations in regards to BaltOps 2012 and FRUKUS 2012 (France, Russia, United Kingdom, and United States).

On 20 April 2015, &quot;Normandy&quot; along with were deployed off the coast of Yemen to intercept suspected Iranian weapons shipments intended for the Houthi rebels, who are locked in battle with Yemeni government forces.

On 9 February 2020 while patrolling in the Arabian Sea, &quot;Normandy&quot; captured a stateless dhow carrying a cargo of 358 missiles, Iranian surface-to-air missiles.

In July of 2024, &quot;Normandy&quot; conducted operations in the Norwegian Sea alongside USS Tennessee (SSBN-734).

==Awards==
&quot;Normandy&quot; received the Navy Unit Commendation, the National Defense Service Medal, and the Southwest Asia Service Medal (with two bronze stars) for her efforts in support of Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm. She was awarded her second Navy Unit Commendation Medal in June 1994, for her extensive participation in events commemorating D-Day. &quot;Normandy&quot; was awarded her third Navy Unit Commendation and the Meritorious Unit Commendation for her actions during her time in the Adriatic in 1995. The cruiser won the Marjorie Sterrett Battleship Fund Award for the Atlantic Fleet in 1997.

Along with the 1998 title &quot;Most Tomahawks shot by a US Navy cruiser&quot;, &quot;Normandy&quot; holds three Battle &quot;E&quot; Awards for overall ship-wide excellence in performance.

==Coat of arms==
=== Shield ===

The lettering, lion, anchor, and perimeter of the shield are gold. The border beneath the lettering and the crest background are dark blue. These are the color traditionally associated with the Navy. The caltraps symbolize mines and German defenses on the Normandy beaches. The anchor characterizes sea power and strength. The chevron is broken and thrust forward, denoting the assault landing and the &quot;breaking through&quot; the enemy defenses; it is white for honor and integrity, edged with red for valor, sacrifice, and bloodshed.

=== Crest ===
The pole star signifies the Allied Forces that joined for the Normandy Invasion. It also portrays the four points of the globe, signifying the worldwide mission of the &quot;Normandy&quot;. The gold lion, adopted from the Coat of Arms of Normandy, France, represents the location of the assault and characterizes the courage, strength, and determination of the invasion forces. He grasps an inflamed trident in honor of Neptune, mythological lord of the sea, and code name for the Navy&#x27;s crucial gunfire support and the delivery of land forces in the Battle of Normandy. 

=== Motto ===
The words, &quot;VANGUARD OF VICTORY,&quot; underscore the Battle of Normandy as the spearhead of the Allied defense which turned the tide of war in Europe, as well as the leading role of the AEGIS cruiser in today&#x27;s world as a defender of world freedom.

From 20 to 22 January, she was underway from Haifa, Israel for exercise Noble Dina Seven. On 22–23 January, she was in port in Haifa, Israel for post-exercise debriefs, before leaving for a US Navy/NATO Combined Air Defense Exercise. On 29 March, Vice Admiral W. A. Owens, Commander, United States Sixth Fleet, embarked with a 28-man Army, Navy, and Air Force Staff including Brigadier General James Mathers (Commanding General, Operation Provide Comfort) at Haifa for the first Joint Task Force Operation at sea in the European Theater, Exercise Juniper Falconry II. From 1–7 April, &quot;Monterey&quot; was underway for Juniper Falconry II, with a two-day port visit in Haifa on 3–4 April. From 7–9 April, she visited Haifa again for exercise debriefs and to disembark the Joint Task Force.

From 24 to 26 April 1993, &quot;Monterey&quot; participated in ASW Proficiency Training as a part of COMPTUEX, the first major exercise the &quot;America&quot; Joint Task Group (JTG) in preparation for MED 3–93. COMPTUEX lasted from 21 April to 14 May and tested the &quot;America&quot; JTG in coordinated warfare operations. The exercise was a success and the JTG was certified &quot;ready&quot; for more advanced training. In May and June, &quot;Monterey&quot; conducted port visits to Nassau, Bahamas and Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico. &quot;Monterey&quot; visited Nassau from 9–12 May as a wrap-up to COMPTUEX and NSRR from 31 May to 3 June prior to a missile exercise with the German Navy.

September 1993 was the first time that &quot;Monterey&quot; served as the Adriatic Cruiser in support of United Nations Resolutions in Operations Sharp Guard, Deny Flight, and Provide Promise. After a stint as the Adriatic Cruiser from 6–13 September, she departed for İzmir, Turkey. After a training anchorage in Izmir from 16 to 22 September, &quot;Monterey&quot; prepared for Exercise Dynamic Guard, hosted by the Turkish Navy. From 22 September to 4 October, she participated in amphibious, anti-air, anti-surface, anti-subsurface, and mine warfare events. She served as the Eagle Control ship for the entire exercise, monitoring the airspace above the Aegean Sea for possible territorial airspace violations.

Upon completion of Dynamic Guard, &quot;Monterey&quot; departed for the Adriatic Sea for carrier escort duty with &quot;America&quot; from 6–13 October. While operating in the Adriatic, she participated in numerous Anti-Submarine Warfare exercises with various NATO/WEU ships and aircraft operating in support of United Nations&#x27; resolutions. After detaching from &quot;America&quot;, &quot;Monterey&quot; conducted a brief stop in Augusta Bay while en route to Haifa, Israel, where she conducted a port visit from 17 to 28 October.

From 30 October to 5 November, &quot;Monterey&quot; participated in SHAREM 106 in the Adriatic Sea. Upon completion of the exercise, she departed for Volos, Greece. She then conducted a training anchorage from 7–8 November in Volos, Greece in preparation for Exercise Niriis. From 8–13 November, she participated in Exercise Niriis which was hosted by the Greek Navy. She served as the Support Operations Coordinating Authority with submarine during Niriis. Upon completion, &quot;Monterey&quot; departed for the Adriatic Sea.

From 1–16 December 1993, &quot;Monterey&quot; served as the Adriatic Cruiser. During this period, she hosted the Engineering Training Group from Staten Island, New York, in preparation for the next year&#x27;s Operational Propulsion Plant Examination. SECNAV and CINCUSNAVEUR visited from 11 to 12 December and were very impressed with the ship and the crew. In addition, the Commanders of the NATO/WEU ships in the Southern Adriatic, Capt. Bolongaro of the Italian Navy and Commodore Maddison of the Royal Canadian Navy visited &quot;Monterey&quot; on 2 and 15 December respectively. After completing the ship&#x27;s duties as Adriatic Cruiser, she departed for Toulon, France.

&quot;Monterey&quot; arrived in Toulon on 20 December and remained there throughout the Christmas and New Years holidays. While in port, the ship underwent voyage repairs. Many crewmembers took leave and vacationed nearby with their partners. The rest of the crew were given tours and dinners by French families through the Adopt-A-Sailor program.

During Carrier Group Seven&#x27;s deployment in 1998, Helicopter Antisubmarine Squadron Light 42 (HSL-42), Detachment 2 deployed two SH-60B Seahawk on board the &quot;Monterey&quot;.

===2000===

On 2 February 2000, &quot;Monterey&quot; stopped Russian tanker &quot;Volga-Neft&quot;-147. The tanker was suspected of smuggling Iraqi oil in violation of UN sanctions, as it had left the Iraqi port of Shatt al-Arab. The boarding operation was conducted by SEAL Team Two and no shots were fired as the tanker crew was cooperative. The tanker was subsequently diverted into Oman where she was confirmed to be carrying Iraqi oil illegally. After the illegal cargo was unloaded, the crew and tanker were free to leave.

===2003===
In March 2003, the ship was assigned to Carrier Group 6.

===2009===
On 4 March 2009, &quot;Monterey&quot; assisted in the first German Navy arrest of pirates (9 in all) off the coast of the Horn of Africa. &quot;Monterey&quot; dispatched helicopters in the attack of an Antiguan ship, MV &quot;Courier&quot;.

===2011===
In March 2011, &quot;Monterey&quot; was sent to the Mediterranean as the first part of the planned European anti-ballistic missile defense shield. In June 2011, &quot;Monterey&quot; arrived in the Black Sea to participate in multinational military exercises, &quot;Sea Breeze 2011&quot;, cosponsored by the US and Ukraine, whose theme is antipiracy operations, leading to protests from Russia.

<doc id="764405" wikidata="Q1527413" url="?curid=764405" title="Turing degree">
<text>In computer science and mathematical logic the Turing degree (named after Alan Turing) or degree of unsolvability of a set of natural numbers measures the level of algorithmic unsolvability of the set.

==Overview==
The concept of Turing degree is fundamental in computability theory, where sets of natural numbers are often regarded as decision problems. The Turing degree of a set is a measure of how difficult it is to solve the decision problem associated with the set, that is, to determine whether an arbitrary number is in the given set.

Two sets are Turing equivalent if they have the same level of unsolvability; each Turing degree is a collection of Turing equivalent sets, so that two sets are in different Turing degrees exactly when they are not Turing equivalent. Furthermore, the Turing degrees are partially ordered, so that if the Turing degree of a set &quot;X&quot; is less than the Turing degree of a set &quot;Y&quot;, then any (possibly noncomputable) procedure that correctly decides whether numbers are in &quot;Y&quot; can be effectively converted to a procedure that correctly decides whether numbers are in &quot;X&quot;. It is in this sense that the Turing degree of a set corresponds to its level of algorithmic unsolvability.

The Turing degrees were introduced by and many fundamental results were established by . The Turing degrees have been an area of intense research since then. Many proofs in the area make use of a proof technique known as the priority method.

==Turing equivalence==
For the rest of this article, the word &quot;set&quot; will refer to a set of natural numbers. A set &quot;X&quot; is said to be Turing reducible to a set &quot;Y&quot; if there is an oracle Turing machine that decides membership in &quot;X&quot; when given an oracle for membership in &quot;Y&quot;. The notation &quot;X&quot; ≤T &quot;Y&quot; indicates that &quot;X&quot; is Turing reducible to &quot;Y&quot;.

Two sets &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; are defined to be Turing equivalent if &quot;X&quot; is Turing reducible to &quot;Y&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; is Turing reducible to &quot;X&quot;. The notation &quot;X&quot; ≡T &quot;Y&quot; indicates that &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; are Turing equivalent. The relation ≡T can be seen to be an equivalence relation, which means that for all sets &quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;, and &quot;Z&quot;: 
* &quot;X&quot; ≡T &quot;X&quot; 
* &quot;X&quot; ≡T &quot;Y&quot; implies &quot;Y&quot; ≡T &quot;X&quot;
* If &quot;X&quot; ≡T &quot;Y&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; ≡T &quot;Z&quot; then &quot;X&quot; ≡T &quot;Z&quot;.

A Turing degree is an equivalence class of the relation ≡T. The notation [&quot;X&quot;] denotes the equivalence class containing a set &quot;X&quot;. The entire collection of Turing degrees is denoted formula_1.

The Turing degrees have a partial order ≤ defined so that [&quot;X&quot;] ≤ [&quot;Y&quot;] if and only if &quot;X&quot; ≤T &quot;Y&quot;. There is a unique Turing degree containing all the computable sets, and this degree is less than every other degree. It is denoted 0 (zero) because it is the least element of the poset formula_1. (It is common to use boldface notation for Turing degrees, in order to distinguish them from sets. When no confusion can occur, such as with [&quot;X&quot;], the boldface is not necessary.)

For any sets &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot;, X join Y, written &quot;X&quot; ⊕ &quot;Y&quot;, is defined to be the union of the sets } and }. The Turing degree of &quot;X&quot; ⊕ &quot;Y&quot; is the least upper bound of the degrees of &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot;. Thus formula_1 is a join-semilattice. The least upper bound of degrees a and b is denoted a ∪ b. It is known that formula_1 is not a lattice, as there are pairs of degrees with no greatest lower bound.

For any set &quot;X&quot; the notation &quot;X&quot;′ denotes the set of indices of oracle machines that halt (when given their index as input) when using &quot;X&quot; as an oracle. The set &quot;X&quot;′ is called the Turing jump of &quot;X&quot;. The Turing jump of a degree [&quot;X&quot;] is defined to be the degree [&quot;X&quot;′]; this is a valid definition because &quot;X&quot;′ ≡T &quot;Y&quot;′ whenever &quot;X&quot; ≡T &quot;Y&quot;. A key example is 0′, the degree of the halting problem.

==Basic properties of the Turing degrees==
* Every Turing degree is countably infinite, that is, it contains exactly formula_5 sets.
* There are formula_6 distinct Turing degrees.
* For each degree a the strict inequality a &lt; a′ holds.
* For each degree a, the set of degrees below a is countable. The set of degrees greater than a has size formula_6.

==Structure of the Turing degrees==
A great deal of research has been conducted into the structure of the Turing degrees. The following survey lists only some of the many known results. One general conclusion that can be drawn from the research is that the structure of the Turing degrees is extremely complicated.

===Order properties===
* There are minimal degrees. A degree a is &quot;minimal&quot; if a is nonzero and there is no degree between 0 and a. Thus the order relation on the degrees is not a dense order.
* The Turing degrees are not linearly ordered by &amp;leq;T.
* In fact, for every nonzero degree a there is a degree b incomparable with a.
* There is a set of formula_6 pairwise incomparable Turing degrees.
* There are pairs of degrees with no greatest lower bound. Thus formula_1 is not a lattice.
* Every countable partially ordered set can be embedded in the Turing degrees.
* An infinite strictly increasing sequence a1, a2, ... of Turing degrees cannot have a least upper bound, but it always has an &quot;exact pair&quot; c, d such that ∀e (e&lt;c∧e&lt;d ⇔ ∃&quot;i&quot; e≤a&quot;i&quot;), and thus it has (non-unique) minimal upper bounds.
* Assuming the axiom of constructibility, it can be shown there is a maximal chain of degrees of order type formula_10.

===Properties involving the jump===
* For every degree a there is a degree strictly between a and a′. In fact, there is a countable family of pairwise incomparable degrees between a and a′.
* Jump inversion: a degree a is of the form b′ if and only if 0′ ≤ a.
* For any degree a there is a degree b such that a &lt; b and b′ = a′; such a degree b is called &quot;low&quot; relative to a.
* There is an infinite sequence a&quot;i&quot; of degrees such that a′&quot;i&quot;+1 ≤ a&quot;i&quot; for each &quot;i&quot;.
* Post&#x27;s theorem establishes a close correspondence between the arithmetical hierarchy and finitely iterated Turing jumps of the empty set.

===Logical properties===
* showed that the first-order theory of formula_1 in the language or is many-one equivalent to the theory of true second-order arithmetic. This indicates that the structure of formula_1 is extremely complicated.
* showed that the jump operator is definable in the first-order structure of formula_1 with the language .

==Recursively enumerable Turing degrees==

A degree is called &quot;recursively enumerable&quot; (r.e.) or &quot;computably enumerable&quot; (c.e.) if it contains a recursively enumerable set. Every r.e. degree is below 0′, but not every degree below 0′ is r.e.. However, a set formula_14 is many-one reducible to 0′ iff formula_14 is r.e..

* : The r.e. degrees are dense; between any two r.e. degrees there is a third r.e. degree.
* and : There are two r.e. degrees with no greatest lower bound in the r.e. degrees.
* and : There is a pair of nonzero r.e. degrees whose greatest lower bound is 0.
* : There is no pair of r.e. degrees whose greatest lower bound is 0 and whose least upper bound is 0′. This result is informally called the &quot;nondiamond theorem&quot;.
* : Every finite distributive lattice can be embedded into the r.e. degrees. In fact, the countable atomless Boolean algebra can be embedded in a manner that preserves suprema and infima.
* : Not all finite lattices can be embedded in the r.e. degrees (via an embedding that preserves suprema and infima). A particular example is shown to the right. L. A. Harrington and T. A. Slaman (see ): The first-order theory of the r.e. degrees in the language 〈 0, ≤, = 〉 is many-one equivalent to the theory of true first-order arithmetic.

Additionally, there is Shoenfield&#x27;s limit lemma, a set A satisfies formula_16 iff there is a &quot;recursive approximation&quot; to its characteristic function: a function &quot;g&quot; such that for sufficiently large &quot;s&quot;, formula_17.

A set &quot;A&quot; is called &quot;n&quot;-r e. if there is a family of functions formula_18 such that:
* &quot;A&quot;s is a recursive approximation of &quot;A&quot;: for some &quot;t&quot;, for any &quot;s&quot;&amp;geq;&quot;t&quot; we have &quot;A&quot;&quot;s&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = &quot;A&quot;(&quot;x&quot;), in particular conflating &quot;A&quot; with its characteristic function. &quot;(Removing this condition yields a definition of&quot; A &quot;being&quot; &quot;weakly &quot;n&quot;-r.e.&quot;&quot;)&quot;
* &quot;A&quot;s is an &quot;&quot;n&quot;-trial predicate&quot;: for all &quot;x&quot;, &quot;A&quot;0(&quot;x&quot;)=0 and the cardinality of formula_19 is &amp;leq;n.

Properties of &quot;n&quot;-r.e. degrees:
* The class of sets of &quot;n&quot;-r.e. degree is a strict subclass of the class of sets of (&quot;n&quot;+1)-r.e. degree.
* For all &quot;n&quot;&gt;1 there are two (&quot;n&quot;+1)-r.e. degrees a, b with formula_20, such that the segment formula_21 contains no &quot;n&quot;-r.e. degrees.
* formula_14 and formula_23 are (&quot;n&quot;+1)-r.e. iff both sets are weakly-&quot;n&quot;-r.e.

==Post&#x27;s problem and the priority method==
Emil Post studied the r.e. Turing degrees and asked whether there is any r.e. degree strictly between 0 and 0′. The problem of constructing such a degree (or showing that none exist) became known as Post&#x27;s problem. This problem was solved independently by Friedberg and Muchnik in the 1950s, who showed that these intermediate r.e. degrees do exist (Friedberg–Muchnik theorem). Their proofs each developed the same new method for constructing r.e. degrees, which came to be known as the priority method. The priority method is now the main technique for establishing results about r.e. sets.

The idea of the priority method for constructing a r.e. set &quot;X&quot; is to list a countable sequence of &quot;requirements&quot; that &quot;X&quot; must satisfy. For example, to construct a r.e. set &quot;X&quot; between 0 and 0′ it is enough to satisfy the requirements &quot;Ae&quot; and &quot;Be&quot; for each natural number &quot;e&quot;, where &quot;Ae&quot; requires that the oracle machine with index &quot;e&quot; does not compute 0′ from &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Be&quot; requires that the Turing machine with index &quot;e&quot; (and no oracle) does not compute &quot;X&quot;. These requirements are put into a &quot;priority ordering&quot;, which is an explicit bijection of the requirements and the natural numbers. The proof proceeds inductively with one stage for each natural number; these stages can be thought of as steps of time during which the set &quot;X&quot; is enumerated. At each stage, numbers may be put into &quot;X&quot; or forever (if not injured) prevented from entering &quot;X&quot; in an attempt to &quot;satisfy&quot; requirements (that is, force them to hold once all of &quot;X&quot; has been enumerated). Sometimes, a number can be enumerated into &quot;X&quot; to satisfy one requirement but doing this would cause a previously satisfied requirement to become unsatisfied (that is, to be &quot;injured&quot;). The priority order on requirements is used to determine which requirement to satisfy in this case. The informal idea is that if a requirement is injured then it will eventually stop being injured after all higher priority requirements have stopped being injured, although not every priority argument has this property. An argument must be made that the overall set &quot;X&quot; is r.e. and satisfies all the requirements. Priority arguments can be used to prove many facts about r.e. sets; the requirements used and the manner in which they are satisfied must be carefully chosen to produce the required result.

For example, a simple (and hence noncomputable r.e.) low &quot;X&quot; (low means &quot;X&quot;′=0′) can be constructed in infinitely many stages as follows. At the start of stage &quot;n&quot;, let &quot;T&quot;&quot;n&quot; be the output (binary) tape, identified with the set of cell indices where we placed 1 so far (so &quot;X&quot;=∪&quot;n&quot; &quot;T&quot;&quot;n&quot;; &quot;T&quot;0=∅); and let &quot;P&quot;&quot;n&quot;(&quot;m&quot;) be the priority for not outputting 1 at location &quot;m&quot;; &quot;P&quot;0(&quot;m&quot;)=∞. At stage &quot;n&quot;, if possible (otherwise do nothing in the stage), pick the least &quot;i&quot;&lt;&quot;n&quot; such that ∀&quot;m&quot; &quot;P&quot;&quot;n&quot;(&quot;m&quot;)≠&quot;i&quot; and Turing machine &quot;i&quot; halts in &lt;&quot;n&quot; steps on some input &quot;S&quot;⊇&quot;T&quot;&quot;n&quot; with ∀&quot;m&quot;∈&quot;S&quot;\&quot;T&quot;&quot;n&quot; &quot;P&quot;&quot;n&quot;(&quot;m&quot;)≥&quot;i&quot;. Choose any such (finite) &quot;S&quot;, set &quot;T&quot;&quot;n&quot;+1=&quot;S&quot;, and for every cell &quot;m&quot; visited by machine &quot;i&quot; on &quot;S&quot;, set &quot;P&quot;&quot;n&quot;+1(&quot;m&quot;) = min(&quot;i&quot;, &quot;P&quot;&quot;n&quot;(&quot;m&quot;)), and set all priorities &gt;&quot;i&quot; to ∞, and then set one priority ∞ cell (any will do) not in &quot;S&quot; to priority &quot;i&quot;. Essentially, we make machine &quot;i&quot; halt if we can do so without upsetting priorities &lt;&quot;i&quot;, and then set priorities to prevent machines &gt;&quot;i&quot; from disrupting the halt; all priorities are eventually constant.

To see that &quot;X&quot; is low, machine &quot;i&quot; halts on &quot;X&quot; iff it halts in &lt;&quot;n&quot; steps on some &quot;T&quot;&quot;n&quot; such that machines &lt;&quot;i&quot; that halt on &quot;X&quot; do so &lt;&quot;n&quot;-&quot;i&quot; steps (by recursion, this is uniformly computable from 0′). &quot;X&quot; is noncomputable since otherwise a Turing machine could halt on &quot;Y&quot; iff &quot;Y&quot;\&quot;X&quot; is nonempty, contradicting the construction since &quot;X&quot; excludes some priority &quot;i&quot; cells for arbitrarily large &quot;i&quot;; and &quot;X&quot; is simple because for each &quot;i&quot; the number of priority &quot;i&quot; cells is finite.

<text>USS &quot;Robert Smalls&quot; (CG-62) is a guided-missile cruiser built during the Cold War for the United States Navy. Commissioned in 1989, the warship was originally named USS &quot;Chancellorsville&quot; for the American Civil War Battle of Chancellorsville. In March 2023, she was renamed for Robert Smalls, a former slave who freed himself and others by commandeering a Confederate transport ship.

Until 30 December 2011, the ship was operationally part of Carrier Strike Group Seven. In 2010 she was administratively under the command of Commander, Naval Surface Forces Pacific. She was assigned to Carrier Strike Group Five and is deployed to Yokosuka, Japan.

&quot;Robert Smalls&quot; is equipped with guided missiles and rapid-fire cannons, with anti-air, anti-surface and anti-subsurface capabilities. She also carries two MH-60R Seahawk Light Airborne Multi-Purpose System (LAMPS) helicopters, focused on anti-submarine warfare.

==History==
The ship was commissioned at Ingalls Shipbuilding in Pascagoula, Mississippi, as &quot;Chancellorsville&quot; on 4 November 1989.

=== 1990s ===
She first deployed in March 1991, to the Persian Gulf in support of Operation Desert Storm.

&quot;Chancellorsville&quot; was next deployed from February to August 1993, to the Persian Gulf as part of the Nimitz Battle Group. On 26 June 1993, &quot;Chancellorsville&quot; launched strikes on the Iraqi Intelligence Center in Baghdad with nine Tomahawk missiles in retaliation for the aborted assassination attempt on former President Bush. She deployed again to the Western Pacific and Persian Gulf from April to October 1995.

Following a Fifth Fleet deployment to the North Persian Gulf in 1995, &quot;Chancellorsville&quot; was awarded the Spokane Trophy in 1996. The Spokane Trophy is awarded by Commander-in-Chief, United States Pacific Fleet to the surface combatant ship considered to be the most proficient in overall combat systems readiness and warfare operations.

&quot;Chancellorsville&quot; deployed to the Caribbean and Eastern Pacific in support of joint counter-narcotics operations in November 1997. During this deployment, she rescued the crew of an Ecuadorian fishing vessel which had been adrift for ten days. Upon her return home, &quot;Chancellorsville&quot; underwent her first major nine-month overhaul in San Diego, California.

On 7 July 1998, &quot;Chancellorsville&quot; changed homeport from San Diego, to Yokosuka, Japan, joining Task Force 70/Battle Force Seventh Fleet, and probably, Carrier Group Five. After arriving in Yokosuka, &quot;Chancellorsville&quot; participated in multinational operations in the Sea of Japan, including the International Fleet Review. &quot;Chancellorsville&quot; took part in exercises with the &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; Battle Group in the spring of 1999.

On 6 April 1999, &quot;Chancellorsville&quot; deployed to the Persian Gulf in company with and in support of Operation Southern Watch, and returned to Yokosuka on 5 January 2000. In May 2000, &quot;Chancellorsville&quot; participated in exercises with the Thai and Singaporean navies.

===2000s===
Following a visit to Qingdao, China, in August 2000, &quot;Chancellorsville&quot; took part in ANNUALEX 12G, a joint U.S.-Japanese naval exercise. In November, &quot;Chancellorsville&quot; fired guns and SM-2 missiles as part of MISSILEX 01-1. In March through June 2001, she visited Singapore, Thailand, Saipan and Sydney, Australia, as part of an extended Spring Cruise. &quot;Chancellorsville&quot; then entered dry dock for an upkeep period in the fall. In September 2001, &quot;Chancellorsville&quot; deployed with the &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; Battle Group in support of Operation Enduring Freedom, operating in the theater for several months. &quot;Chancellorsville&quot; paid her first visit to Vladivostok, Russia, in July 2002, celebrating Independence Day in Russia along with . In March 2003, the ship was assigned to Carrier Group Five. On 22 October 2003, &quot;Chancellorsville&quot; played host in Guam to two warships of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, which made the first-ever visit of the Chinese navy to Guam. By May 2004, she was back in the Southwest Asian region, where she lent aid to a disabled Indonesian fishing boat.

On 19 July 2004, &quot;Chancellorsville&quot; departed Yokosuka to participate in Exercise Summer Pulse 2004 and Joint Air and Sea Exercises (JASEX) 2004, with the &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; Battle Group. Summer Pulse was the Navy&#x27;s first implementation of the new Fleet Response Plan (FRP). She returned to homeport 7 September. &quot;Chancellorsville&quot; entered a nine-week dry dock availability in February 2005. Following the maintenance period, she immediately returned to sea to participate in the exercises Talisman Saber 2005, the third annual Orange Crush and the Joint Air and Sea Exercise (JASEX) 2005. She returned to Yokosuka in August. ANNUALEX 2005 commenced in November with &quot;Chancellorsville&quot; participating, along with other U.S. and Japanese assets. The exercise saw a total of 61 naval vessels, including two U.S. submarines, 10 U.S. Navy ships and 49 Japanese ships. &quot;Chancellorsville&quot; visited Hong Kong at the end of November and returned to Yokosuka 12 December. &quot;Chancellorsville&quot; swapped with based in San Diego. &quot;Chancellorsville&quot;″s homeport was changed to San Diego, with &quot;Shiloh&quot; moving to Yokosuka. The crews remained in their respective locations.

In winter of 2006, &quot;Chancellorsville&quot; deployed again into the Western Pacific, visiting Singapore and Pattaya, Thailand, in February. In April, she joined forces of the Republic of Korea for Reception, Staging, Onward-movement, &amp; Integration and Foal Eagle 2006 (RSOI/Foal Eagle 06), exercises utilizing more than 70 U.S. and Korean ships. &quot;Chancellorsville&quot; returned to Yokosuka in August in preparation for a hull swap with &quot;Shiloh&quot;. &quot;Chancellorsville&quot; was scheduled to return to San Diego, in October 2006, making it her homeport once again.

===2010s===

In March 2011, in company with the carrier , &quot;Chancellorsville&quot; was deployed off northeastern Honshu, Japan, to assist with relief efforts after the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. During that time, helicopter crews from &quot;Ronald Reagan&quot; were exposed to leaking radiation from the nuclear accidents and ships from the carrier strike group were moved to avoid being downwind from the facility.

During the latter half of 2012, &quot;Chancellorsville&quot; underwent equipment upgrades as part of the Aegis Modernization effort ACB-12. In January 2013, the ship spent five days under way off the coast of California to perform a series of tests of the updated ACB-12 equipment and software.

In November 2013, while testing combat weapons systems off the coast of Point Mugu, California, a BQM-74E unmanned drone being used in the exercise failed to respond to commands to turn away from the ship and collided with &quot;Chancellorsville&quot;. Since it was a tracking exercise and not a live fire exercise, the crew did not engage the drone with the Phalanx CIWS. Two sailors received treatment for minor burns and the ship suffered some damage and returned to San Diego for assessment. The damage later proved to be more severe than initially assessed. Citing Navy sources, the U.S. Naval Institute reported that repairs to the ship would cost $30 million and take six months to complete.
On 7 June 2019 &quot;Chancellorsville&quot; came close to a collision with the Russian destroyer . Each side blamed the other for the near collision. Russian sources stated that the incident occurred in the southeast of the East China Sea while US sources named the location as in the Philippine Sea. According to retired US Navy captain Carl Schuster, the Russian ship&#x27;s wake shows that it &quot;didn&#x27;t adhere to either the rules of the road or the incidents at sea agreement.&quot; United States Seventh Fleet spokesman Commander Clayton Doss said the Russian destroyer came within of &quot;Chancellorsville&quot;, &quot;putting the safety of her crew and ship at risk.&quot; The Russian Navy released a statement claiming that &quot;Chancellorsville&quot; had &quot;suddenly changed its course and crossed the Admiral Vinogradov destroyer&#x27;s course some 50 meters away from the ship.&quot; According to the same statement, this caused &quot;Admiral Vinogradov&quot; to take an &quot;emergency maneuver&quot; in order to avoid a collision with the American ship. In November 2019 and again on 15 February 2020, the ship transited the Taiwan Strait.

===2020s===
During the 2020 George Floyd protests, the name of the ship came into question because it honors a victory of the Confederate Army fighting against the United States for southern independence and in defense of slavery. In December 2020, the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Report to Congress on the Annual Long-Range Plan for Construction of Naval Vessels stated that the ship was planned to be placed Out of Commission in Reserve in 2026.
In May 2022, &quot;Chancellorsville&quot; was homeported out of Yokosuka, Japan. She was as part of Carrier Strike Group 5 led by the carrier &quot;Ronald Reagan&quot;. On 28 August 2022, &quot;Chancellorsville&quot; along with sister ship conducted a routine transit through the Taiwan Strait. This was the first such transit to occur since the 2022 visit by Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan.

==== Ship renaming ====

The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021 created a new Naming Commission to examine names across the US armed forces that honor the Confederate States of America, the group of states that attempted to break away from the US during the American Civil War. &quot;Chancellorsville&quot; was explicitly named in early news reports about the commission due to its clear association with the Confederate victory at the Battle of Chancellorsville, which included a portrait of generals Robert E. Lee and Thomas &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson in the cruiser&#x27;s wardroom. The painting was removed in 2016. The commission&#x27;s report noted that &quot;Chancellorsville&quot;″s crest also included an inverted wreath that commemorated the death of Jackson during the Battle of Chancellorsville.

In September 2022, the Naming Commission recommended that the US Navy rename two shore installations, USNS &quot;Maury&quot; (T-AGS-66) (named for Matthew Fontaine Maury, who chose to fight for the Confederates), and &quot;Chancellorsville&quot;. The choice of what to rename them to was left to the Secretary of the Navy. As part of its report, the Commission judged that the ship celebrated the Confederacy.

On 27 February 2023, the Secretary of the Navy Carlos Del Toro announced that the US Navy would rename &quot;Chancellorsville&quot; after Robert Smalls, a slave who commandeered the Confederate ship CSS &quot;Planter&quot; in 1862. The name change was made effective on 1 March 2023, The Navy held a ceremony to mark the change that was designed to not disrupt the ship&#x27;s activities. and deployed with the &quot;Ronald Reagan&quot; carrier strike group in May 2023. &quot;Robert Smalls&quot; made a port visit to Da Nang, Vietnam in June 2023. &quot;Robert Smalls&quot; participated in exercise Talisman Sabre 2023 in July 2023.

<doc id="764415" wikidata="Q12981756" url="?curid=764415" title="Sensor (character)">
<text>:&quot;This page discusses the post-Zero Hour reboot version of the character. For the other versions, see Princess Projectra.&quot;

Sensor (Jeka Wynzorr) is a superhero appearing in media published by DC Comics, primarily as a member of the Legion of Super-Heroes.

She is a snake-like alien who was later altered by &quot;Hypertaxis energy&quot; into a semi-humanoid shape, retaining her serpent tail but gaining a humanoid upper body.

==Fictional character biography==
Jeka Wynzorr is a snake-like alien and the princess of the planet Orando who renounces her position to travel the galaxy, using her illusion-casting abilities to disguise herself as a human. She joins the Legion of Super-Heroes as Sensor and obtains cybernetic arms, which she is rarely seen without.

While battling the Terrorforms on Xanthu, Sensor is exposed to Hypertaxis energy and mutates uncontrollably until Ra&#x27;s al Ghul stabilizes her into a nāga-like form. In 2004, the Legion&#x27;s continuity is rebooted, erasing Sensor from existence and replacing her with a new version of Projectra.

In &quot;Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds&quot;, an alternate universe variant of Sensor in her original form is among the Legionnaires summoned to help fight the Time Trapper.

Sensor also makes a minor appearance in &quot;Action Comics&quot; (vol. 2), where she, Chameleon Boy, and Shrinking Violet unsuccessfully attempt to change the past.

== In other media ==
Sensor appears in &quot;Adventures in the DC Universe&quot; #10.

<doc id="764424" wikidata="Q907" url="?curid=764424" title="Gordon Freeman">
<text>Gordon Freeman is the silent protagonist of the &quot;Half-Life&quot; video game series, created by Gabe Newell and designed by Marc Laidlaw of Valve. His first appearance is in &quot;Half-Life&quot; (1998). Gordon is depicted as a bespectacled white man from Seattle, with brown hair and a signature goatee, who graduated from MIT with a PhD in theoretical physics. He was an employee at the fictional Black Mesa Research Facility. Controlled by the player, Gordon is often tasked with using a wide range of weapons and tools to fight alien creatures such as headcrabs, as well as Combine machines and soldiers. Gordon&#x27;s character has been well received by critics and gamers, and various gaming websites often consider him to be one of the greatest video game characters of all time, including UGO and &quot;GameSpot&quot;.

==Character design==
Valve president and &quot;Half-Life&quot; director Gabe Newell coined the name &quot;Gordon Freeman&quot; during a conversation with the game&#x27;s writer Marc Laidlaw in his car. Laidlaw had originally named the character &quot;Dyson Poincaré&quot;, combining the names of physicist and philosopher Freeman Dyson and mathematician Henri Poincaré. The texture for Gordon&#x27;s head was &quot;too big of a job for just one person&quot;, so Valve designers combined references from four people. An earlier model of Gordon, known as &quot;Ivan the Space Biker&quot;, had a full beard that was subsequently trimmed. Other iterations of Gordon&#x27;s concept featured different glasses, a ponytail, and a helmet.

Gordon wears a special full-body hazmat suit, known as the Hazardous Environment Suit (or HEV Suit). The suit is designed to protect the user from radiation, energy discharges, and blunt trauma during the handling of hazardous materials. The suit&#x27;s main feature is its &quot;high-impact reactive armor&quot;, an electrically powered armor system that, when charged, absorbs two-thirds of the damage that Gordon would ordinarily suffer in &quot;Half-Life&quot; and 80% in &quot;Half-Life 2&quot;. A fully charged suit can survive several dozen hits from small arms and even one direct hit from an RPG. The suit can be charged by various means, and has its own oxygen supply and medical injectors, such as morphine and a neurotoxin antidote. It comes with a built-in flashlight, a radio, various tracking devices, a compass, and a Geiger counter. The suit contains an on-board computer system that constantly monitors the user&#x27;s health and vital signs, and reacts to any changes in the user&#x27;s condition. It also projects a heads-up display (HUD) which displays Gordon&#x27;s health and suit charge level, remaining ammunition, and a crosshair. As a means of immersing the player in the role, Gordon never speaks, and there are no cutscenes or mission briefings—all action is viewed through Gordon&#x27;s eyes, with the player retaining control of Gordon&#x27;s actions at nearly all times. The images of Gordon are only seen on the game&#x27;s cover and menu pages, and also in advertisements, making them marketing tools rather than pictures of what Gordon is &quot;really like&quot;. Gabe Newell has stated that Valve sees no reason to give Gordon a voice.

In &quot;Half-Life&quot;, Gordon wears the &quot;Mark IV&quot; suit. Later in the game, the suit is equipped with an optional long-jump module so Gordon can leap great distances. It is charged using power modules throughout Black Mesa. In &quot;Half-Life 2&quot; Gordon receives the upgraded &quot;Mark V&quot; suit, which lacks the long-jump module but gains several new abilities. It features a visual zooming capability, limited sprinting, an anti-venom injector, an optional ammo and a health counter on the crosshair, and has been modified to use Combine power nodes to charge the suit.

The &quot;Mark V&quot; initially used a single power source for the flashlight, sprinting, and oxygen supply; in &quot;Half-Life 2: Episode Two&quot; the flashlight was given a separate power source to improve gameplay. The symbol on Gordon&#x27;s HEV suit is the lowercase Greek letter Lambda, λ. This symbol is used by scientists to denote the decay constant of radioactive elements (related to the half-life of an element). As well as appearing on Gordon&#x27;s suit, the symbol replaces the letter &quot;a&quot; in the game title (&quot;Hλlf-Life&quot;) and is the name of the complex in the Black Mesa Research Facility where teleportation experiments are conducted in the first game. The Lambda symbol is also seen in &quot;Half-Life 2&quot; as a marking of the human resistance, seen close to hidden supplies and on the armbands of better equipped resistance fighters.

==Appearances==
In the &quot;Half-Life&quot; saga, Gordon Freeman is a silent protagonist who, despite lacking formal weapon training, survives a chaotic inter-dimensional incident at the Black Mesa Research Facility. In &quot;Half-Life 2&quot;, after being kept in stasis for nearly two decades, Freeman battles the Combine Empire to liberate Earth. He gains legendary status and sparks a rebellion, ultimately destroying the Citadel, a major Combine stronghold. The G-Man rescues Freeman after this critical event, praising his accomplishments and placing him back in stasis.

In &quot;Episode One&quot;, Gordon Freeman and Alyx Vance work to stabilize the Citadel&#x27;s core to prevent a catastrophic explosion. In &quot;Episode Two&quot;, they work together to transport crucial data to close a forming super portal. After a revelation from the G-Man about saving Alyx, they learn about the &quot;Borealis&quot;, a research vessel with the potential to cause significant events. The game ends with Alyx mourning her father&#x27;s death at the hands of a Combine Advisor.

&quot;Half-Life: Alyx&quot;, set five years before &quot;Half-Life 2&quot;, follows Alyx Vance trying to locate Gordon. She infiltrates a Combine vault, believing it holds Gordon, but instead releases the G-Man. As a reward for freeing him, the G-Man shows her a vision of her father&#x27;s death in the future, and offers her the chance to change the outcome. Alyx complies, killing the Advisor and saving her father, and the G-man suspends her in stasis and leaves. Five years later, Freeman regains consciousness at White Forest and is reunited with Eli. Realizing that the G-Man has Alyx, Eli declares his intention to kill him and hands Freeman his crowbar.

==Critical reception==
Gordon Freeman quickly became and then remained one of the most popular video game characters ever. In 2008, &quot;The Age&quot; ranked him as the 16th-best Xbox character of all time, adding that &quot;no one has done more for the reputations and street cred of theoretical physicists than Valve.&quot; In 2009, GameDaily listed the &quot;strong and silent type&quot; in their top 25 video game archetypes, using Gordon Freeman as an example. In 2010, &quot;Empire&quot; ranked him as the number one Greatest Video Game Character, commenting that &quot;the character is the quintessential geek fantasy&quot; who &quot;has become a gaming icon, synonymous with the apotheosis of first-person action.&quot;

He was also ranked 14th on UGO.com&#x27;s list of top 100 heroes in all media, with a comment that &quot;an MIT graduate, donning black-framed glasses and a goatee, he&#x27;s not the guy you&#x27;d picture decimating the alien threat.&quot; In 2012, GamesRadar ranked him as the sixth &quot;most memorable, influential, and badass&quot; protagonist in games, adding: &quot;It&#x27;s how the characters of the &quot;Half-Life&quot; universe treat Gordon Freeman, not the way he treats them, that shape such a compelling character.&quot; In 2013, &quot;Complex&quot; ranked him as the 45th &quot;most badass&quot; video game character of all time. On the other hand, 1UP.com&#x27;s Marty Sliva included him among the most unrelatable narrators, stating, &quot;I&#x27;m sure some people love the fact that they can become Gordon Freeman -- I just think I&#x27;d be a little happier if there was anything there &quot;to&quot; become.&quot;

In 1998, readers of &quot;GameSpot&quot; ranked him as the fifth-best Hero of gaming. In 2009, a public poll on GameSpot resulted in him being voted the All Time Greatest Video Game Hero. He was also voted as the eighth-best video game character of all time in the &quot;Guinness World Records Gamer&#x27;s Edition&quot; 2011.

<text>Bhat (also spelled as Bhatt or Butt) is a Brahmin surname used in the Indian subcontinent. Bhat and Bhatt are shortened renditions of Bhatta or Brahmabhatta.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;Bhat&quot; (, ) means &quot;scholar&quot; in Sanskrit. While the original shortened rendition of &quot;Bhatta&quot; was &quot;Bhat&quot; or &quot;Bhatt,&quot; many of the Kashmiri Brahmin migrants to the Punjab region started spelling their surname as &quot;Butt&quot;, which is the transliteration of the name when written using the Urdu/Persian alphabet (as opposed to Bhat when using the Devanagari alphabet).

==Geographic distribution==
===Goa===
The surname is in use among some Konkani Goud Saraswat Brahmins as well as Konkani Christians (who trace their ancestry to the Gaud Saraswat Brahmins of Goa).

===Kashmir===
Bhat, also spelled as Bhatt, Batt or Butt, is a Kashmiri Pandit surname found among the Saraswat Brahmins indigenous to the Kashmir Valley, as well as the Kashmiri Brahmins who migrated to Punjab, a region now divided between India and the neighbouring Pakistan.

The Bhats who migrated to Punjab in the late 19th century and the early 20th century due to the 1878 drought, were Brahmin migrants from Kashmir, escaping discrimination by local rulers and seeking trade opportunities.

The surname is now shared by both Kashmiri Hindus and Kashmiri Muslims who mostly retained their Hindu last names.

===Punjab===
Some Bhats/Butts found in the Punjab region are descendants of those Kashmiri Brahmins who migrated to different cities of (undivided) Punjab from the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir during the 1878 famine in British India.

In Ludhiana, Kashmiris became known for their contribution to the handicraft arena.

===Karnataka and Tamil Nadu===
The word Bhaṭṭa (Kannada:ಭಟ್ಟ) or Bhaṭṭar (Tamil: பட்டர்) is traditionally used, especially in the states of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka usually to denote a &quot;learned man&quot; or a &quot;scholar&quot; (Brahmins), but also in other southern states.

It was originally used as an honorific like śāstri or paṇḍita, but has become a surname in parts of the country in modern times used as a family name rather than an honorific. In Southern Karnataka naming convention followed is such that, generally, one&#x27;s father&#x27;s name is kept as the surname irrespective of caste and many of these honorifics continue to be used as honorifics.

In earlier times a caste name or village name was used by the Tamils as their last name, but due to the influence of the Dravidian movement, Tamils of all castes have mostly given up caste surnames. However, women frequently adopt their father&#x27;s or husband&#x27;s name and take it for successive generations. But, honorific like Bhaṭṭar are still in use in spoken language rather than as a surname.

This surname is commonly found in Havyaka Brahmins, Kota Brahmins, Shivalli Brahmins, Sthanika Brahmins, Koteshwara Brahmins, Kandavara Brahmins, Hoysala Brahmins of Karnataka.

<text>In mathematics, the Lyusternik–Schnirelmann category (or, Lusternik–Schnirelmann category, LS-category) of a topological space formula_1 is the homotopy invariant defined to be the smallest integer number formula_2 such that there is an open covering formula_3 of formula_1 with the property that each inclusion map formula_5 is nullhomotopic. For example, if formula_1 is a sphere, this takes the value two.

Sometimes a different normalization of the invariant is adopted, which is one less than the definition above. Such a normalization has been adopted in the definitive monograph by Cornea, Lupton, Oprea, and Tanré (see below).

In general it is not easy to compute this invariant, which was initially introduced by Lazar Lyusternik and Lev Schnirelmann in connection with variational problems. It has a close connection with algebraic topology, in particular cup-length. In the modern normalization, the cup-length is a lower bound for the LS-category.

It was, as originally defined for the case of formula_1 a manifold, the lower bound for the number of critical points that a real-valued function on formula_1 could possess (this should be compared with the result in Morse theory that shows that the sum of the Betti numbers is a lower bound for the number of critical points of a Morse function).

The invariant has been generalized in several different directions (group actions, foliations, simplicial complexes, etc.).

<text>USS &quot;Cowpens&quot; (CG-63) was a guided missile cruiser in service with the United States Navy from 1991 to 2024. The ship is named after the Battle of Cowpens, a major American victory near Cowpens, South Carolina, in the American Revolution. She was built at the Bath Iron Works in Maine. &quot;Cowpens&quot; was last stationed at Naval Base San Diego.

==History==

=== 1980s and 1990s ===
&quot;Cowpens&quot;&#x27; keel was laid 23 December 1987, at Bath Iron Works; she was launched 11 March 1989, and sponsored by Lucy Mustin, wife of Vice Admiral Henry C. Mustin. &quot;Cowpens&quot; was commissioned 9 March 1991 in Charleston, South Carolina, In January 1993, &quot;Cowpens&quot; was one of four ships to launch Tomahawk missiles against a nuclear production facility in Iraq.

In June 1994, &quot;Cowpens&quot; deployed with and her Battlegroup to the Korean Peninsula during the 1994 Nuclear Crisis in the region. On 12 July, she took part in a search for wreckage from &quot;NL-102&quot;, an F-14A from VF-51 that crashed the previous night aboard &quot;Kitty Hawk.&quot; On 30 August, &quot;Cowpens&quot; was overflown by two ROCAF F-5 Tigers while moving to rejoin the &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; Battlegroup following a port visit to British Hong Kong. Between 8-12 November, &quot;Cowpens&quot; and the &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; Battlegroup joined with several JSMDF units to participate in ANNUALEX 06G. The Battlegroup returned on 22 December.

&quot;Cowpens&quot; made another deployment with &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; on 11 October 1996. While making her way to the Persian Gulf in late November, the ship avoided Typhoon Carlo. During mid-December, a visit to Bahrain was cut short as &quot;Cowpens&quot; was ordered to observe the firing of Iranian C-802 cruise missiles from Jask. In January 1997, the ship would win her fifth Battle E award.

&quot;Cowpens&quot;″s ELINT crew detected a Chinese-flagged vessel on 3 February 1997. The vessel was smuggling Iraqi oil illegally in violation of UN Sanctions and was seized by and in coordination with HSL-16 Det.8. On 8 February the ship took part in an exercise that successfully integrated the &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; Battlegroup into the Theater Ballistic Missile Defense (TBMD), which included MIM-104 Patriot missile sites in Bahrain and USSPACECOM assets in space. The ship returned to San Diego on 11 April 1997.

=== 2000s ===
In August 2000, an Aegis fire controlman died when he fell from the main mast of &quot;Cowpens&quot;.

In March 2003, &quot;Cowpens&quot;, assigned to Carrier Group Five, became the first United States Navy ship to launch ordnance in the opening stages of the Iraq War, firing Tomahawk cruise missiles.
This ship was one of several participating in disaster relief after the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami.

In June 2010, a quartermaster fell to his death from the bridge wing of &quot;Cowpens&quot; while the ship was in dry dock.

=== 2010s ===
&quot;Cowpens&quot; was scheduled to be decommissioned on 31 March 2013. However, &quot;Cowpens&quot; was retained under the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013. In February 2013, &quot;Cowpens&quot; was relieved by in a &quot;hull-swap&quot; at Yokosuka, Japan, in which the two crews swapped ships. &quot;Cowpens&quot;, previously deployed to Yokosuka, was then homeported at Naval Base San Diego, California. On 5 December 2013, &quot;Cowpens&quot; was involved in a minor confrontation with a Chinese warship that was escorting the Chinese aircraft carrier &quot;Liaoning&quot; while conducting surveillance of Chinese ships in International waters in the South China Sea. After &quot;Cowpens&quot; refused a Chinese demand to leave the area, a Chinese amphibious transport dock crossed directly in front of &quot;Cowpens&quot; and halted. The two vessels were barely away when the captain of &quot;Cowpens&quot; ordered &quot;all stop&quot;. Chinese admiral Yin Zhuo said that the Chinese action was intentional and that American ships sent to observe PLAN maneuvers would be &quot;blocked&quot;. Pentagon spokesman Steve Warren said that American procedures had not been changed in light of the incident, but defense analyst Tim Brown said that it reflected &quot;a growing willingness by the Chinese to engage in potentially reckless behavior&quot;.

In September 2015, &quot;Cowpens&quot; transferred from Naval Surface Forces Command to Naval Sea Systems Command, where she will undergo a &quot;modernization period&quot;, extending the serviceable life of the ship into the 2040s.

=== 2020s ===
In the US Navy&#x27;s 2024 proposed budget, presented in 2023, &quot;Cowpens&quot; was again proposed for retirement. Navy Undersecretary Erik Raven stated that this was due to the ship&#x27;s &quot;material condition, life remaining, cost, ... time to upgrade ... and the warfighting value.&quot;

In March 2024, the Navy announced plans to inactivate &quot;Cowpens&quot; on 30 August 2024. She was decommissioned on 27 August 2024.

Captain Edward Moore Jr. was the first commanding officer of &quot;Cowpens&quot;. Vice Admiral Moore later became Commander of Naval Surface Force, U.S. Pacific Fleet, from August 1998 to May 2001.

Captain W. Dallas Bethea was the second commanding officer of &quot;Cowpens&quot;. He relieved Captain Moore, who had just been promoted to rear admiral, on 2 February 1993 in Bahrain and was on board when the ship took part in the Tomahawk strike on 17 January. Captain Bethea often challenged other ships in the fleet to a 5-mile drag race and enjoyed an undefeated record. Captain Bethea previously commanded and played a significant role during Operation Praying Mantis, a punitive strike against Iran for damage done by an Iranian mine to . He is prominently mentioned in the book Tanker War, which chronicles this tense conflict between Iran and the United States. During Captain Bethea&#x27;s last year in command in 1994, &quot;Cowpens&quot; was awarded the coveted U.S. Pacific Fleet Spokane Trophy (citation below) for the top operational combat systems readiness performance in the fleet for a surface ship, the Secretary of the Navy Meritorious Unit Commendation, as well as her second consecutive Pacific Fleet Surface Force Battle Efficiency Award in addition to the Pacific Fleet Surface Force LAMPS Helicopter Ship Safety Award.

On 13 January 2010, the ship&#x27;s commanding officer, Captain Holly Graf, was relieved of command by Rear Admiral Kevin Donegan, Commander, Carrier Strike Group Five, following the imposition of non-judicial punishment. The punishment followed an investigation which verified allegations of cruelty and maltreatment toward her crew and conduct unbecoming an officer – violations of articles 93 and 133 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, by Graf during her tenure as captain of &quot;Cowpens&quot;. The investigation was initiated after multiple allegations and complaints of physical and verbal abuse were made to Naval Criminal Investigative Service and the Navy Inspector General by several members of the crew. Captain Graf was subsequently replaced as the commanding officer by Captain Robert Marin. A subsequent &quot;Time&quot; article revealed that Graf had a history of abusive treatment of subordinates in earlier command and non-command assignments and that naval leaders had not acted on previous complaints about her behavior. The US Navy forced Graf into early retirement in 2012, but allowed her to do so at her current rank of captain and under &quot;honorable circumstances.&quot;

On 10 February 2012, &quot;Cowpens&quot;&#x27; commanding officer, Captain Robert G. Marin, was relieved of command for inappropriate personal behavior after he had an adulterous affair with a fellow captain&#x27;s wife. Captain Paul Lyons, deputy commander Destroyer Squadron 15, temporarily assumed command.

On 10 June 2014, the commanding officer of &quot;Cowpens&quot;, Captain Gregory Gombert, was relieved of command for poor performance in many inspections. Capt. Robert B. Chadwick II temporarily assumed command on that date. Based on an official report, the Navy Times reported that Gombert took ill midway through the deployment and rarely left his quarters for nearly three months of the cruise. The report concluded Gombert had exaggerated the extent of his illness. It also noted accusations of an unduly familiar relationship between Gombert and a female Lieutenant Commander who was Chief Engineer, acting Executive Officer, and filling in for Gombert during his illness. The Command Master Chief was also relieved since he did not report the problems to higher authorities. At Admiral&#x27;s non-judicial punishment in July 2014, Gombert was found guilty of five counts of failure to obey lawful orders and one count of conduct unbecoming an officer. The Chief Engineer was found guilty of two counts of failure to obey lawful orders and one of conduct unbecoming an officer. The Command Master Chief was found guilty of two counts of failure to obey lawful orders. Gombert was the third commanding officer of &quot;Cowpens&quot; to be fired since 2010.

In September 2014, &quot;Cowpens&quot; second-in-command, executive officer, was fired after being found guilty of Admiral&#x27;s non-judicial punishment of drunken or reckless vehicle operation and conduct unbecoming an officer. He was the fourth member of &quot;Cowpens&quot; leadership team to be removed in 2014.
