<text>A box office or ticket office is a place where tickets are sold to the public for admission to an event. Patrons may perform the transaction at a countertop, through a hole in a wall or window, or at a wicket. By extension, the term is frequently used, especially in the context of the film industry, as a metonym for the amount of business a particular production, such as a film or theatre show, receives. The term is also used to refer to a ticket office at an arena or a stadium.

&quot;Box office&quot; business can be measured in terms of the number of tickets sold or the amount of money raised by ticket sales (revenue). The projection and analysis of these earnings is greatly important for the creative industries and often a source of interest for fans. This is predominant in the Hollywood movie industry.

To determine if a movie made a profit, it is not correct to directly compare the box office gross with the production budget, because the movie theater keeps nearly half of the gross on average. The split varies from movie to movie, and the percentage for the distributor is generally higher in early weeks. Usually the distributor gets a percentage of the revenue after first deducting a &quot;house allowance&quot; or &quot;house nut&quot;. It is also common that the distributor gets either a percentage of the gross revenue, or a higher percentage of the revenue after deducting the nut, whichever is larger. The distributor&#x27;s share of the box office gross is often referred to as the &quot;distributor rentals&quot;.

==Etymology==
Ceramic money boxes were used at the sixteenth-century Globe Theatre and Rose Theatre in London, where many examples have been found during archaeological investigations. They were possibly used by the &quot;gatherer&quot; at the entrance to the theatres, who collected the admission money. There is disagreement, however, around whether the term originates from this time, as the objects could have been carried by the many snack-sellers attending the audiences; they too needed a convenient and secure way to collect their customers&#x27; cash. There is no record of the term being used until the eighteenth century.

The term &quot;box office&quot; was being used from at least 1741, deriving from the office from which tickets for theatre boxes were sold (although the use of &quot;box&quot; for a private section from which to watch the play was in use in 1609); this is the derivation favoured by the Oxford English Dictionary.

== Related terminology ==
Total ticket sales were being termed &quot;box office&quot; from at least 1904.

The following is film industry specific terminology used by box office reporters such as &quot;Variety&quot; and Box Office Mojo. For films released in North America, box office figures are usually divided between domestic, meaning the United States and Canada, and foreign which includes all other countries. Weekly box office figures are now normally taken to be from Friday through Thursday to allow for the fact that most films are officially released in the United States on a Friday. With &quot;Variety&quot; being published for many years every Wednesday, most weekly box office figures they reported from the 1920s to the 1990s were for the week from Thursday to Wednesday. A large component of the weekly gross is the weekend box office. Historically, this was reported as the box office receipts around Friday through Sunday plus any public holidays close to the weekend, such as a 4-day Memorial Day weekend, however, with the increased regularity of reporting of box office figures, a comparable 3-day figure for the Friday to Sunday is now also used. In particular, the weekend box office for the initial week of release, or opening weekend, is often widely reported. (See List of highest-grossing openings for films.)

Theaters is the number of theaters in which the movie is showing. Since a single theater may show a movie on multiple screens, the total number of screens or engagements is used as another measure. The theaters measure is used to classify whether a film is in wide release, meaning at least 600 theaters, or limited release which is less than 600 theaters. Occasionally, a film may achieve wide release after an initial limited release; &quot;Little Miss Sunshine&quot; is an example of this.

Gross refers to gross earnings. On average, the movie&#x27;s distributor receives a little more than half of the final gross (often referred to as the rentals) with the remainder going to the exhibitor (i.e., movie theater).

Multiple is the ratio of a film&#x27;s total gross to that of the opening weekend. A film that earns $20 million on its opening weekend and finishes with $80 million has a multiple of 4. From 2004 to 2014, films viewers graded as A+ on CinemaScore had a 4.8 multiple, while films graded as F had a 2.2 multiple.

Admissions refers to the number of tickets sold at the box office. In countries such as France, box office reporting was historically reported in terms of admissions, with rules regulated by the government and fines issued if exhibitors failed to report the data. Other countries which historically reported box office figures in terms of admissions include European countries such as Germany, Italy, and Spain, the Soviet Union, and South Korea. Box Office Mojo estimates the North American ticket sales by dividing the domestic box office gross by the average ticket price (ATP) of a given year, a method that Box Office India uses to estimate Indian footfalls (ticket sales). See &quot;List of films by box office admissions&quot; for the films with the highest known estimated ticket sales.

===Box office lists===
For lists of films which are major box-office hits, see &quot;List of highest-grossing films&quot;, &quot;List of films by box office admissions&quot; and &quot;Lists of highest-grossing films&quot;. Films that are considered to have been very unsuccessful at the box office are called box-office bombs or box office flops. For a list of these films, see &quot;List of biggest box-office bombs&quot;.

Inflation Adjustment 

There are two main methods of box office inflation. First, used by boxofficemojo and comscore, To adjust it for inflation (or see what it might have made in the past), the estimated number of tickets sold is multiplied by the average ticket price of the selected year.

Second, Using CPI of respective country. 

Both methods have some flaws. I first, content of movies change over time, then number of ticket sold may increase or decreas. In second, ATP of movies increased exponentially in 1990s but CPI increased slower than ATP.

A third method is also available, In which we can use APT of movies as CPI and adjust box office.

==Box office reporting==
There are numerous websites that monitor box-office receipts, such as &quot;BoxOffice&quot;, Box Office Mojo, The Numbers, and ShowBIZ Data. These sites provide box office information for hundreds of movies. Data for older movies is often incomplete due to the way box office reporting evolved, especially in the U.S., and the availability of information prior to the introduction of the internet.

===History===

====Rise of Hollywood====
&quot;Variety&quot; started reporting box office results by theatre on March 3, 1922, to give exhibitors around the country information on a film&#x27;s performance on Broadway, which was often where first run showings of a film were held. In addition to New York City, they also endeavoured to include all of the key cities in the U.S. in future and initially also reported results for 10 other cities including Chicago and Los Angeles.

In 1929, the first issue of &quot;The Motion Picture Almanac&quot; was released and included a list of the top 104 grossing films for the past year. In 1932, &quot;Variety&quot; published the studios&#x27; top-grossing films of the year and has maintained this tradition annually since. In 1937, &quot;BoxOffice&quot; magazine]began publishing box office reports. Beginning in the 1930s, BoxOffice magazine published a Barometer issue in January, which reported the performance of movies for the year expressed as percentages.

====Golden era of film====
In 1946, &quot;Variety&quot; started to publish a weekly National Box Office survey on page 3 indicating the performance of the week&#x27;s hits and flops based on the box office results of 25 key U.S. cities.

Later in 1946, &quot;Variety&quot; published a list of All-Time Top Grossers with a list of films that had achieved or gave promise of earning $4,000,000 or more in domestic (U.S. and Canada) theatrical rentals. This became a leading source of data for a film&#x27;s performance. &quot;Variety&quot; would publish an updated all-time list annually for over 50 years, normally in their anniversary edition each January. The anniversary edition would also normally contain the list of the top performing films of the year.

====Dawn of modern film industry====
In the late 1960s, &quot;Variety&quot; used an IBM 360 computer to collate the grosses from their weekly reports of 22 to 24 U.S. cities from January 1, 1968. The data came from up to 800 theatres which represented around 5% of the U.S. cinema population at the time but around one-third of the total U.S. box office grosses. In 1969, &quot;Variety&quot; started to publish a list of the top 50 grossing films each week. &quot;The Love Bug&quot; was the number one on the first chart published for the week ending April 16, 1969. The chart was discontinued in 1990.

In 1974, Nat Fellman founded Exhibitor Relations Co., the first company set up to track box office grosses, which it collected from the studios. Two years later, Marcy Polier, an employee of the Mann theater chain, set up Centralized Grosses to collate U.S. daily box office data on a centralized basis from theaters rather than each theater chain collating their own numbers from other theater chains. The company later became National Gross Service then Entertainment Data, Inc. (EDI).

Except for disclosures by the studios on very successful films, total domestic (U.S. and Canada) box office gross information for films was not readily available until National Gross Service started to collate this data around 1981. The collation of grosses led to wider reporting of domestic box office grosses for films. Arthur D. Murphy, a former U.S. Navy lieutenant at &quot;Variety&quot; was one of the first to organize and chart that information and report it in a meaningful form. During the 1980s, Daily &quot;Variety&quot; started to publish a weekly chart of the domestic box office grosses of films collated from the studios as compared to the Top 50 chart in &quot;Variety&quot; which was based on a sample of theatre grosses from key markets.

Gradually the focus of a film&#x27;s performance became its box office gross rather than the rentals that &quot;Variety&quot; continued to report annually. Prior to the tracking of these grosses, domestic or worldwide box office grosses is not available for many earlier films so the only domestic or worldwide data available is still often the rental figures.

Murphy started to publish &quot;Art Murphy&#x27;s Box Office Register&quot; annually from 1984 detailing U.S. box office grosses.

In 1984, EDI started to report Canadian grosses as well and by 1985 was reporting data for 15,000 screens. In 1987, EDI set up a database of box office information which included data on certain films back to 1970. By 1991, all U.S. studios had agreed to share their complete data reports with EDI. By then box office results were publicized, with &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot; segments on the weekend&#x27;s top films, increasing public discussion of poorly performing films. In 1990, EDI opened an office in the UK, moved into Germany in 1993 and Spain in 1995 reporting box office data for those markets. EDI were acquired by ACNielsen Corporation in 1997 for $26 million and became Nielsen EDI.

By the 1990s, &quot;Daily Variety&quot; started to report studio&#x27;s weekend estimates from Sundays on Monday mornings which led to other media reporting the data earlier. When &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; was launched in 1990 it started to publish the top 10 box office weekend lists from Exhibitor Relations and the company was also supplying box office data to companies such as the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, CNN and the Associated Press.

In 1994, &quot;Variety&quot; published their first annual global box office chart showing the top 100 grossing films internationally for the prior year.

On August 7, 1998, Box Office Mojo was launched by Brandon Gray and in 1999 he started posting the Friday grosses sourced from Exhibitor Relations so that they were publicly available for free online on Saturdays and posted the Sunday estimates on Sundays. In July 2008, Box Office Mojo was purchased by Amazon.com through its subsidiary, IMDb.

====Modern film industry====
Rentrak started tracking box office data from point of sale in 2001 and started to rival EDI in providing the studios with data. In December 2009, Rentrak acquired Nielsen EDI for $15 million, and became the sole provider of worldwide box office ticket sales revenue and attendance information which is used by many of the websites noted above.

On October 23, 2019, Box Office Mojo unveiled a dramatic redesign resembling IMDb, and was rebranded as &quot;Box Office Mojo by IMDbPro&quot; with some of the content move to the subscription based IMDbPro.

US box office reporting largely paused for the first time in 26 years in March 2020, as nearly all theaters nationwide were closed because of the coronavirus pandemic. Only drive-in theaters, which are typically not included in box office reporting, remained open.

==Average ticket price==
The average ticket price (ATP) is the average cost to purchase a film ticket at the box office in any given year. According to the UNESCO Institute for Statistics, the ATP is &quot;calculated as the total revenues generated from tickets sales divided by the number of feature film tickets sold during the year of reference.&quot;

==Distributor rentals==
Box-office figures are reported in the form of either gross receipts or distributor rentals, the latter being especially true of older films. Commonly mistaken for home video revenue, the rentals are the distributor&#x27;s share of the film&#x27;s theatrical revenue i.e. the box office gross less the exhibitor&#x27;s cut. Historically, the rental price averaged at 30–40% when the distributors owned the theater chains, equating to just over a third of the gross being paid to the distributor of the film. , rental fees varied greatly, depending on a number of factors, with films from the major studios averaging 43% of gross receipts.

Tervola is named after its first Finnish settler, a Savonian named Olli Paavonpoika Tervonen, mentioned on a tax list from the year 1579. The part of the Kemijoki between Paakkola and Rovaniemi was essentially uninhabited before his family&#x27;s arrival. 

The area was originally subordinate to Kemi, becoming a chapel community in 1627 under the name &quot;Lapinniemi&quot;, while the settlement name &quot;Tervola&quot; was first mentioned in 1796. Tervola became an independent parish in 1860.

<text>Willem Janszoon Blaeu (; 157121 October 1638), also abbreviated to Willem Jansz. Blaeu, was a Dutch cartographer, atlas maker, and publisher. Along with his son Johannes Blaeu, Willem is considered one of the notable figures of the Netherlandish or Dutch school of cartography during its golden age in the 16th and 17th centuries.

==Biography==
Blaeu was born at Uitgeest or Alkmaar. As the son of a well-to-do herring salesman, he was destined to succeed his father in the trade, but his interests lay more in mathematics and astronomy. Between 1594 and 1596, as a student of the Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe, he qualified as an instrument and globe maker. During this time in 1596, his son Joan Blaeu was born and he would also become a well established cartographer. Later in 1600 Willem discovered the second ever variable star, now known as P Cygni.

Once he returned to Holland, he made country maps and world globes, and as he possessed his own printing works, he was able to regularly produce country maps in an atlas format, some of which appeared in the &quot;Atlas Novus&quot; published in 1635. In 1633 he was appointed map-maker of the Dutch East India Company. He was also an editor and published works of Willebrord Snell, Descartes, Adriaan Metius, Roemer Visscher, Gerhard Johann Vossius, Barlaeus, Hugo Grotius, Vondel and the historian and poet Pieter Corneliszoon Hooft. He died in Amsterdam.

He had two sons, Johannes and Cornelis Blaeu, who continued their father&#x27;s mapmaking and publishing business after his death in 1638. Prints of the family&#x27;s works are still sold today. Original maps are rare collector items.

Blaeu&#x27;s maps were featured in the works of the Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer of Delft (1632–1675), who holds a position of great honor among map historians. Several of his paintings illustrate maps hanging on walls or globes standing on tables or cabinets. Vermeer painted these cartographical documents with such detail that it is often possible to identify the actual maps. Evidently, Vermeer was particularly attached to a Willem Blaeu – Balthasar Florisz van Berckenrode map of Holland and West Friesland, as he represented it as a wall decoration in three of his paintings. Though no longer extant, the map&#x27;s existence is known from archival sources and the second edition published by Willem Blaeu in 1621, titled &quot;Nova et Accurata Totius Hollandiae Westfriesiaeq. Topographia, Descriptore Balthazaro Florentio a Berke[n]rode Batavo&quot;. Vermeer must have had a copy at his disposal (or the earlier one published by Van Berckenrode). Around 1658 he showed it as a wall decoration in his painting &quot;Officer and Laughing Girl&quot;, which depicts a soldier in a large hat sitting with his back to viewer, talking with a smiling girl who holds a glass in her hand. Bright sunlight bathes the girl and the large map on the wall. Vermeer&#x27;s gift for realism is evidenced by the fact that the wall map, mounted on linen and wooden rods, is identifiable as Blaeu&#x27;s 1621 map of Holland and West Friesland. He captures faithfully its characteristic design, decoration, and geographic content.

==Legacy==

His maps formed the bulk of the Atlas Maior, which became a collector&#x27;s item in Amsterdam.

() and covers an area of of which is water. The population density is . The municipality is unilingually Finnish.

The sower pictured in the coat of arms of Toivakka refers to agriculture but also to hope for the future. The coat of arms was designed by Gustaf von Numers and was confirmed for use on April 23, 1957.

==Geography==
Neighbouring municipalities are Hankasalmi, Joutsa, Jyväskylä, Kangasniemi, Laukaa and Muurame.

There are altogether 82 lakes in Toivakka. The biggest lakes are Päijänne, Maunonen and Palosenjärvi.

The largest forest tree and the deepest inland water point in Finland are both located in Toivakka.

== History ==
A farm named Toivakka has existed since 1540. Its name is derived from the Savonian surname &quot;Toivakainen&quot;. It was a part of the village of Leppävesi in Laukaa, which was included in the Rautalampi parish after its establishment in 1561. Laukaa became an independent parish in 1628 and Toivakka remained a part of it until 1871, when it was transferred to Jyväskylän maalaiskunta, which was split off from Laukaa a few years earlier in 1868. Toivakka became a separate parish in 1909 and a municipality in 1910.

<text>Dwight Muhammad Qawi ( ; born Dwight Braxton; January 5, 1953) is an American former professional boxer who competed from 1978 to 1998. He was a world champion in two weight classes, having held the WBC and &quot;Ring&quot; magazine light heavyweight titles from 1981 to 1983, and the WBA cruiserweight title from 1985 to 1986. Qawi was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 2004.

==Early life==
Qawi, then known as Dwight Braxton, was born in Baltimore, Maryland, but grew up in Camden, New Jersey, where he got involved with crime at a young age. He was eventually convicted of armed robbery and spent around five years in prison.

It was in Rahway State Prison that Braxton found his place in life. The prison had an extensive boxing program and one of its inmates, James Scott, was a light heavyweight title contender who fought several times inside the prison itself. Braxton took up the sport, and when he was released from prison in 1978, immediately became a professional boxer. Qawi&#x27;s style was most often likened to Joe Frazier and with good reason as he had trained in Frazier&#x27;s Philadelphia gym as a professional. He converted to Islam in the early 80s and had his name changed from Dwight Braxton to Dwight Muhammad Qawi.

==Professional career==

He went 1-1-1 in his first three pro fights, but then reeled off 14 straight victories to move into the world rankings at light heavyweight. The last of those wins came on September 5, 1981, when Braxton returned to Rahway to fight Scott, with the winner promised a shot at Matthew Saad Muhammad&#x27;s WBC world championship belt. Braxton won a unanimous 10-round decision.

On December 19 of the same year, Braxton faced Saad Muhammad in Atlantic City. Braxton was the underdog against Saad, one of the most popular fighters of his generation and a fellow future Hall of Famer, but Braxton defeated him on a 10th-round technical knockout and became a world champion for the first time. It was shortly after this that he announced his conversion to Islam and changed his name.

He defended the title three times in the next 15 months, knocking out Jerry Martin, Saad Muhammad a second time and Eddie Davis. On March 18, 1983, he lost a close but unanimous decision to WBA champion Michael Spinks in a unification bout.

Qawi felt that making the division&#x27;s 175-pound weight limit had drained him physically, and resolved to seek another world title in the newly created cruiserweight division. Freed of the need to fight to keep his weight down, Qawi reeled off another series of wins and claimed the WBA cruiserweight title on July 7, 1985, knocking out Piet Crous in Crous&#x27; native South Africa.

He won two more fights, including a victory over former world heavyweight titlist Leon Spinks, before accepting a challenge from Olympian Evander Holyfield on July 12, 1986. The fight, in Holyfield&#x27;s hometown of Atlanta, went the full 15 rounds with Holyfield winning a split decision.

After the loss to Holyfield, Qawi fought off and on for the next 12 years, but never regained a world title. He rematched with Holyfield in 1987 for the WBA and IBF cruiserweight titles, but was stopped in the fourth round.

After a short stint in the heavyweight ranks, where in 1988 he lost to George Foreman by knockout in seven rounds, being forced to quit from exhaustion, he tried to regain the cruiserweight title. On November 27, 1989, he dropped a split decision to Robert Daniels for Holyfield&#x27;s vacated WBA title.

Qawi retired in 1999 at the age of 46, with a career record of 41 wins, 11 losses and one draw, with 25 wins by way of knockout. Currently, he works as a boxing trainer in New Jersey.

== Life after boxing ==
In 1998, Dwight began working at the Lighthouse, a drug and alcohol rehabilitation center in Mays Landing, New Jersey. He works with both adults and adolescents and is a patient advocate.

<doc id="784720" wikidata="Q3150286" url="?curid=784720" title="Area codes 850 and 448">
<text>Area codes 850 and 448 are telephone area codes in the North American Numbering Plan for the Florida panhandle, including Pensacola, Tallahassee and Panama City. Area code 850 was created in 1997 in a split from 904, and area code 448 was assigned as a second code to the same area in an overlay plan in 2019; mandatory ten-digit local dialing began in May 2021.

==History==
When the North American Numbering Plan (NANP) was created by AT&amp;T in 1947, the entire state of Florida was assigned the area code 305. In 1953, the western part of the peninsula from the Tampa Bay area southward received area code 813, and in 1965, North Florida from the panhandle to Jacksonville was assigned area code 904 to mitigate the state&#x27;s growth in population and telephone service. For thirty years, North Florida remained a single numbering plan area (NPA) until 1995, when the southern part of the territory was split off with area code 352. Continued demand put new pressure on the numbering resources, and within a year, further relief action was in the planning stage. The result was that the far western part of the panhandle (south of the Alabama state line) became a new numbering plan area with area code 850. Permissive dialing in the numbering plan area began June 23, 1997, and mandatory dialing commenced on March 23, 1998.

===Original plan===
Area code 850 was originally intended to be the relief code used in the 1995 split of the 904 area code. The Jacksonville, Tallahassee, Panama City and Pensacola LATAs, and the Florida portion of the Mobile, Alabama, LATA were to retain 904 while the Daytona Beach and Gainesville LATAs changed to 850. This plan was scrapped in favor of a plan that moved only the Gainesville LATA to a new area code, this time 352 (FLA on the telephone keypad) and kept the Daytona Beach LATA in then-904 along with the rest of northern Florida. The reason for changing from 850 to 352 was a potential dialing conflict with the 407-850 exchange and some rate centers in the Gainesville LATA with 7-digit local dialing into the 407 area code. Political pressure from the tourism industry in Daytona Beach resulted in that area being kept in the then-904 area code.

The Florida Public Service Commission had planned a three-way split of 904 to take place in 1997. The Jacksonville LATA would move to a proposed 234 area code while the Daytona Beach LATA would change to the 386 area code. The panhandle would have retained the 904 area code. Outcry from the public and business community in the Jacksonville region was significant since Jacksonville is the largest urban area in northern Florida, and would thus face a greater expense and burden to change phone numbers, reprogram cell phones and update printed materials than other parts of the area code. When an area code is split, normal practice calls for the old area code to be retained by the largest city in the former area code territory in order to minimize disruption. There was also opposition from NANPA and the Federal Communications Commission. These two agencies objected because the split would have been unbalanced by creating a new code just for Daytona Beach. The Florida PSC changed course and adopted the plan that was ultimately implemented with the panhandle, including Tallahassee, moving to 850 and Jacksonville and Daytona Beach retaining 904. The 234 area code has since been put into service in Ohio as an overlay to area code 330.

===Relief planning for an overlay===
Area code 850 exhausted its available supply of central office codes in May 2021. Based on previous exhaust forecasts, NANPA began relief planning to provide additional numbering capacity in the 850 region. An initial planning meeting was held on May 16, 2019, during which industry members recommended an all-services overlay as the preferred relief method. NANPA subsequently filed a request with the Florida Public Service Commission to approve a new area code overlaying 850. The Florida Public Service Commission approved the industry&#x27;s all-services overlay recommendation on November 5, 2019. The new area code, 448, was officially assigned to overlay 850. Ten-digit dialing became mandatory on May 22, 2021. The in-service date, when first central office code assignment can become effective, is June 22, 2021. The first central office code assignment within the 448 area code occurred on May 14, 2021.

<doc id="784723" wikidata="Q846627" url="?curid=784723" title="Ocmulgee River">
<text>The Ocmulgee River () is a western tributary of the Altamaha River, approximately 255 mi (410 km) long, in the U.S. state of Georgia. It is the westernmost major tributary of the Altamaha. It was formerly known by its Hitchiti name of Ocheese Creek, from which the Creek (Muscogee) people derived their name.

The Ocmulgee River and its tributaries provide drainage for some 6,180 square miles in parts of 33 Georgia counties, a large section of the Piedmont and coastal plain of central Georgia.

The Ocmulgee River basin has three river subbasins designated by the U.S. Geological Survey: the Upper Ocmulgee River subbasin (hydrologic unit code 03070103); the Lower Ocmulgee River Subbasin (03070104); and the Little Ocmulgee River Subbasin (03070105).

The name of the river may have come from a Hitchiti words &quot;oki&quot; (&quot;water&quot;) plus &quot;molki&quot; (&quot;bubbling&quot; or &quot;boiling&quot;), possibly meaning &quot;where the water boils up.&quot;
==Description==
The river rises at a point in north central Georgia southeast of Atlanta, at the confluence of the Yellow, South, and Alcovy rivers. Since the construction of the Lloyd Shoals Dam in the early 20th century, these rivers join as arms of the Jackson Lake reservoir. The river&#x27;s source is formed at an elevation of around 530 feet above sea level.

The Ocmulgee River flows from the dam southeast past Macon, which was founded on the Fall Line. It joins the Oconee from the northwest (241 miles downstream from Jackson Lake) to form the Altamaha near Lumber City. The Ocmulgee River Water Trail begins from Macon&#x27;s Amerson River Park to the confluence near Lumber city and Hazelhurst, encompassing approximately 200 miles.

Four power plants in the Ocmulgee basin that use the river&#x27;s water, including the coal-fired Plant Scherer in Juliette, operated by the Georgia Power Company. Plant Scherer is the seventh-largest power plant in the United States by capacity , and the largest to be fueled exclusively by coal.

==Fish fauna==
A diverse array of fish—105 species in twenty-one families—inhabit the Ocmulgee River basin. The family with the largest representation in the river basin is &quot;Cyprinidae&quot; (carp and true minnows), with 27 species. It is followed by &quot;Centrarchidae&quot; (sunfish), which has 22 species. The Ocmulgee basin contains ten species in the family &quot;Ictaluridae&quot; (catfish) and eight species of in the family &quot;Catostomidae&quot; (suckers). The river basin is also inhabited by one State of Georgia-designated endangered fish species, the Altamaha shiner (&quot;Cyprinella xaenura&quot;) and two designated rare species, the goldstripe darter (&quot;Etheostoma parvipinne&quot;) and redeye chub (&quot;Notropis harperi&quot;).

The Ocmulgee River is popular with anglers for its excellent fishing, particularly for redbreast sunfish, bluegill, redear sunfish, largemouth bass, black crappie, channel catfish, and flathead catfish. The world record for largest recorded catch of a largemouth bass was achieved in 1932 in Montgomery Lake, an oxbow lake off the Ocmulgee River in Telfair County. The record-setting fish, caught by farmer George Washington Perry, weighed 22 pounds, 4 ounces. The International Game Fish Association officially declared the world record for largemouth bass tied in 2010, following Manabu Kurita&#x27;s catch (in July 2009) of a 22 pound, 4 ounce largemouth taken from Lake Biwa in Japan.

There are some fifteen invasive species of fish which inhabit the river basin. According to a Georgia Department of Natural Resources report, &quot;many of these species are well-established and are detrimental to native fish populations. The fifteen invasives are threadfin shad (&quot;Dorosoma petenense&quot;), goldfish (&quot;Carassius auratus&quot;), grass carp (&quot;Ctenopharyngodon idella&quot;), blacktail shiner (&quot;Cyprinella venusta&quot;); common carp (&quot;Cyprinus carpio&quot;); flathead catfish (&quot;Pylodictis olivaris&quot;); white bass (&quot;Morone chrysops&quot;); morone hybrids (&quot;Morone&quot; sp.); green sunfish (&quot;Lepomis cyanellus&quot;); longear sunfish (&quot;Lepomis megalotis&quot;); Lepomis hybrids (&quot;Lepomis&quot; sp.); shoal bass (&quot;Micropterus cataractae&quot;); spotted bass (&quot;Micropterus punctulatus&quot;); white crappie (&quot;Pomoxis annularis&quot;); and yellow perch (&quot;Perca flavescens&quot;).

==History==
Archeological evidence shows that Native Americans first inhabited the Ocmulgee basin about 10,000 to 15,000 years ago (see settlement of the Americas). Scraping tools and flint spearpoints from nomadic Paleoindians hunters have been discovered in the Ocmulgee floodplain.

In the Archaic period (c. 8000-1000 BCE) which followed, hunter-gatherers in Ocmulgee basin used fiber-tempered pottery and stone tools. During the Woodland period (c. 1000 BCE-900 CE), there were various villages in the area, evidenced by earthen mounds and pottery sherds.

There is evidence that the Mississippian culture reached the Ocmulgee basin by 900 CE; according to the &quot;New Georgia Encyclopedia&quot;, &quot;on the Macon plateau and in the nearby Ocmulgee bottomlands, stretches of farmsteads and gardens constructed around elaborate ceremonial mounds are the most prominent evidence of this early Mississippian influence.&quot; These areas are now part of the Ocmulgee National Monument, a National Park Service-administered protected area established in 1936.

Europeans first explored the Ocmulgee basin in 1540, during the expedition of the Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto and his party, who visited the late Mississippian chiefdom of Ichisi, now identified by archeologists as the floodplain south of Macon. The Ichisi served corncakes, wild onion, and roasted venison to De Soto and his party. Over the next hundred years, however, the Native Americans in the area were devastated from disease and chaos following European contact.

Between 1689 and 1692, a number of towns of the Apalachicola Province located on the Chattahoochee River moved to central Georgia, settling in the area of the Ocmulgee River, which the English at the time called Ochese Creek. In 1715, the English recorded ten towns among the &quot;Ochese Creek Indians&quot; (which the Spanish called &quot;Uchese&quot;), with a population of 2,406. Early 18th century maps show a total of twelve towns in the vicinity of Ochese Creek, many with names corresponding to towns that had been on the Chattahoochee River. The Muscogee-speaking towns of Coweta, Kasihta, Tuskegee, and Koloni were located on the north side of the cluster. Several of the Hitchiti-speaking towns were located to the southern part of the Ochese Creek cluster, including Ocmulgee, Hitchiti, and Osuchi. Two Muskogee-speaking towns from the Tallapoosa River in Alabama, Atasi and Kealedji, joined the cluster of towns around Ochese Creek, as did the Hitchiti-speaking town of Chiaha from western North Carolina. The Ochese Creek cluster also included Westo and Yuchi towns. Following the outbreak of the Yamassee War in 1715, the Ochese Creek towns moved west, mostly returning to the Chattahoochee River, where they evolved into the Lower Towns of the Muscogee Confederacy (referred to by the English as the &quot;Lower Creeks&quot;).

Eli Whitney&#x27;s invention of the cotton gin stimulated development of short-staple cotton plantations in the uplands, where it grew well. The gin mechanized processing of the cotton and made it profitable. Demand for land in the Southeast increased, as well as demand for slave labor in the Deep South. In 1806, the U.S. acquired the area between the Oconee and Ocmulgee rivers from the Creek Indians by the First Treaty of Washington. That same year United States Army established Fort Benjamin Hawkins overlooking the Ocmulgee Fields. In 1819 the Creek held their last meeting at Ocmulgee Fields. they ceded this territory in 1821.

In the same year, the McCall brother established a barge-building operation at Macon. The first steamboat arrived on the river in 1829. During the 19th century, the river provided the principal water navigation route for Macon, allowing the development of the cotton industry in the surrounding region. In 1842 the river was connected by railroad to Savannah. The river froze from bank to bank in 1886. In 1994 devastating floods on the river after heavy rains caused widespread damage around Macon.

==Ocmulgee creeks==
Major creeks that flow into the Ocmulgee River include:

<doc id="784730" wikidata="Q4677572" url="?curid=784730" title="Active object (Symbian OS)">
<text>An active object framework is a callback-based form of multitasking for computer systems. Specifically, it is a form of cooperative multitasking and is an important feature of the Symbian operating system.

Within the framework, active objects may make requests of asynchronous services (e.g. sending an SMS message). When an asynchronous request is made, control is returned to the calling object immediately (i.e. without waiting for the call to complete). The caller may choose to do other things before it returns control back to the operating system, which typically schedules other tasks or puts the machine to sleep. When it makes the request, the calling object includes a reference to itself.

When the asynchronous task completes, the operating system identifies the thread containing the requesting active object, and wakes it up. An &quot;active scheduler&quot; in the thread identifies the object that made the request, and passes control back to that object.

The implementation of active objects in Symbian is based around each thread having a &quot;request semaphore&quot;. This is incremented when a thread makes an asynchronous request, and decremented when the request is completed. When there are no outstanding requests, the thread is put to sleep.

In practice there may be many active objects in a thread, each doing its own task. They can interact by requesting things of each other, and of active objects in other threads. They may even request things of themselves.

This is an implementation of a very old idea that was developed to handle software interruptions in the 70s. The operating system was acting as the first object and the peripheral as the second one.

<doc id="784733" wikidata="Q1289889" url="?curid=784733" title="Jim Clyburn">
<text>James Enos Clyburn (born July 21, 1940) is an American politician serving as the U.S. representative for . First elected in 1992, Clyburn is in his 17th term, representing a congressional district that includes most of the majority-black precincts in and around Columbia and Charleston, as well as most of the majority-black areas outside Beaufort and nearly all of South Carolina&#x27;s share of the Black Belt. Since Joe Cunningham&#x27;s departure in 2021, Clyburn has been the only Democrat in South Carolina&#x27;s congressional delegation and as well as the dean of this delegation since 2011 after fellow Democrat John Spratt lost re-election.

Clyburn served as the third-ranking House Democrat, behind Nancy Pelosi and Steny Hoyer, from 2007 until 2023, serving as majority whip behind Pelosi and Hoyer during periods of Democratic House control, and as assistant Democratic leader behind Pelosi and Hoyer during periods of Republican control. He was House Majority Whip from 2007 to 2011 and again from 2019 to 2023 and also House assistant Democratic leader from 2011 to 2019 and again from 2023 to 2024. After the Democrats took control of the House in the 2018 midterm elections, Clyburn was reelected majority whip in January 2019 at the opening of the 116th Congress, alongside the reelected Speaker Pelosi and Majority Leader Hoyer, marking the second time the trio has served in these roles together.

In the 2022 midterm elections, Republicans gained control of the House, and Pelosi retired as leader of the House Democratic Caucus. In the 2022 United States House of Representatives Democratic Caucus leadership election, Clyburn successfully sought the position as House Assistant Democratic Leader, rather than that of Democratic Whip.

Clyburn played a pivotal role in the 2020 presidential election by endorsing Joe Biden three days before the South Carolina Democratic primary. His endorsement came at a time when Biden&#x27;s campaign had suffered three disappointing finishes in the Iowa and Nevada caucuses and the New Hampshire primary. Biden&#x27;s South Carolina win three days before Super Tuesday transformed his campaign; the momentum led him to capture the Democratic nomination and later the presidency.

== Early life and education ==
Clyburn was born in Sumter, South Carolina, the son of Enos Lloyd Clyburn, a fundamentalist minister, and his wife Almeta (née Dizzley), a beautician. A distant relative of his was George W. Murray, an organizer for the Colored Farmers Alliance (CFA), who was a Republican South Carolina Congressman in the 53rd and 54th U.S. Congresses in the late 19th century. He and other black politicians strongly opposed the 1895 state constitution, which essentially disenfranchised most African-American citizens, a situation the state maintained for more than half a century until federal civil rights legislation passed in the mid-1960s.

Clyburn graduated from Mather Academy (later named Boylan-Haven-Mather Academy) in Camden, South Carolina, then attended South Carolina State College (now South Carolina State University), a historically black college in Orangeburg. He joined the Omega Psi Phi fraternity and graduated with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in history.

For his first full-time position after college, Clyburn taught at C.A. Brown High School in Charleston.

==Early political career==
Clyburn became involved in politics during the 1969 Charleston hospital strike. After assisting the settlement of the protests at the Medical University of South Carolina, he became involved in St. Julian Devine&#x27;s campaign for a seat on the Charleston city council in 1969. Clyburn came up with the campaign&#x27;s slogan, &quot;Devine for Ward Nine&quot;. When Devine won the race, he became the first African American to hold a seat on the city council since Reconstruction. Clyburn later credited that campaign as the reason he got into electoral politics.

After an unsuccessful run for the South Carolina General Assembly, Clyburn moved to Columbia to join the staff of Governor John C. West in 1971. West called Clyburn and offered him a job as his advisor after reading Clyburn&#x27;s response to his loss in the newspaper. After West appointed Clyburn as his advisor, Clyburn became the first nonwhite advisor to a governor in South Carolina history.

In the aftermath of the 1968 Orangeburg massacre, when police killed three protesting students at South Carolina State, West appointed Clyburn as the state&#x27;s human affairs commissioner. He served in this position until 1992, when he stepped down to run for Congress. The Orangeburg massacre and civil-rights protest predated the 1970 Kent State shootings and 1970 Jackson State killings, in which the National Guard at Kent State, and police and state highway patrol at Jackson State, killed student protesters demonstrating against the U.S. invasion of Cambodia during the Vietnam War.

== U.S. House of Representatives ==

===Elections===
After the 1990 census South Carolina&#x27;s district lines were redrawn. Due to prior racial discrimination before the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the Supreme Court required the 6th district, which had previously included the northeastern portion of the state, to be redrawn as a black-majority district. The 6th was reconfigured to take in most of the majority-black areas near Columbia and Charleston, as well as most of the Black Belt. Five-term incumbent Robin Tallon&#x27;s home in Florence stayed in the district, but he chose to retire. Five candidates, all of whom were African American, ran for the Democratic nomination for the seat. Clyburn&#x27;s campaign was led by NAACP activist Isaac W. Williams.

Clyburn won 55% of the vote in the primary, eliminating the need for a runoff. As expected, he won the general election in November handily, becoming the first Democrat to represent a significant portion of Columbia since 1965 and the first Democrat to represent a significant portion of Charleston since 1981. He was the first African-American to represent South Carolina in Congress since George W. Murray in 1893. He has been reelected 15 times with no substantive Republican opposition.

For his first 10 terms, Clyburn represented a district that stretched from the Pee Dee through most of South Carolina&#x27;s share of the Black Belt, but swept west to include most of the majority-black precincts in and around Columbia and south to include most of the majority-black precincts in and around Charleston. After the 2010 census, the district was pushed well to the south, losing its portion of the Pee Dee while picking up almost all of the majority-black precincts near Beaufort and Hilton Head Island (though not taking in any of Beaufort or Hilton Head themselves). The reconfigured 6th was no less Democratic than its predecessor. In all its incarnations as a gerrymandered black-majority district, it has been dominated by black voters in the Columbia and Charleston areas, and for much of that time has been the only safe Democratic district in the state.

In 2008, Clyburn defeated Nancy Harrelson, 68% to 32%. In 2010, he defeated Jim Pratt, 65% to 34%. In 2012, Clyburn defeated Anthony Culler, 73% to 25%.

In March 2024, Clyburn announced his run for re-election. Duke Buckner, who ran against Clyburn in 2022, defeated Justin Scott in the June Republican Primary. Gregg Marcel Dixon, who ran against Clyburn as a Democrat in 2022, switched to the United Citizens Party for his 2024 run for the seat. Alliance Party candidate Joseph Oddo and Libertarian candidate Michael Simpson have also filed for the seat. In November 2024, Clyburn won re-election with 59.5% of the vote.

==== South Carolina Redistricting ====
In 2023, &quot;ProPublica&quot; reported that Clyburn secretly worked with South Carolina Republicans during the 2020 Congressional redistricting process to dilute the state&#x27;s Black vote. The resulting Congressional map made Democrats &quot;have virtually no shot of winning any congressional seat in South Carolina other than Clyburn’s.&quot; The NAACP, in 2022, challenged the South Carolina&#x27;s redistricting as an unconstitutional racial gerrymander, alleging that Republicans deliberately moved Black voters into Clyburn’s district to solidify Republican control over a neighboring swing district. A spokesperson for Clyburn denied &quot;any accusation that Congressman Clyburn in any way enabled or facilitated Republican gerrymandering.&quot; The NAACP case, filed as &quot;Alexander v. South Carolina State Conference of the NAACP&quot;, was argued on October 11, 2023, in the Supreme Court and a ruling siding with the State was made in the 2024 term.

===Tenure===

====Party leadership====

Clyburn was elected vice-chairman of the House Democratic Caucus in 2003, the caucus&#x27;s third-ranking post. He became chair of the House Democratic Caucus in early 2006 after caucus chair Bob Menendez was appointed to the Senate. After the Democrats won control of the House in the 2006 election, Clyburn was unanimously elected Majority Whip in the 110th Congress.

Clyburn would have faced a challenge from Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee chair Rahm Emanuel, but Speaker-elect Nancy Pelosi persuaded Emanuel to run for Democratic Caucus chair. Clyburn was interviewed by National Public Radio&#x27;s &quot;Morning Edition&quot; on January 12, 2007, and acknowledged the difficulty of counting votes and rallying the fractious Democratic caucus while his party held the House majority.

In the 2010 elections, the Democrats lost their House majority. Pelosi ran for Minority Leader in order to remain the House party leader, while Clyburn announced that he would challenge Steny Hoyer, the second-ranking House Democrat and outgoing Majority Leader, for Minority Whip. Clyburn had the support of the Congressional Black Caucus, which wanted to keep an African-American in the House leadership, while Hoyer had 35 public endorsements, including three standing committee chairs. On November 13, Pelosi announced a deal whereby Hoyer would remain Minority Whip, while a &quot;number three&quot; leadership position styled &quot;Assistant Leader&quot; would be created for Clyburn. The exact responsibilities of Clyburn&#x27;s assistant leader office were unclear, though it was said to replace the &quot;Assistant to the Leader&quot; post previously held by Chris Van Hollen, who had attended all leadership meetings but was not in the leadership hierarchy.

On November 28, 2018, Clyburn was elected to serve his second stint as House Majority Whip.

;Ideology
Clyburn is regarded as liberal in his political stances, actions and votes. In 2007 the &quot;National Journal&quot; ranked him the 77th most liberal U.S. representative, with a score of 81, indicating that the conductors of this study found his voting record to be more liberal than 81% of other House members, based on their recent voting records. Clyburn identifies as a progressive, but thinks the Democratic Party&#x27;s more liberal wing should be &quot;practical&quot;. Various progressives have called him &quot;conservative&quot; and &quot;centrist&quot;.

Clyburn has established liberal stances on health care, education, organized labor and environmental conservation issues, based on his legislative actions as well as evaluations and ratings by pertinent interest groups.

;Healthcare

In 2009, Clyburn introduced the Access for All Americans Act. The $26 billion sought by the Act would provide funding to quadruple the number of community health centers in the US that provide medical care to uninsured and low-income citizens.

The American Public Health Association, the American Academy of Family Physicians, The Children’s Health Fund, and other health care interest groups rate Clyburn highly based on his voting record on pertinent issues. Other groups in this field, such as the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, gave Clyburn a rating of zero in 2014.

Despite his opposition to partial-birth abortion, Clyburn is regarded as pro-abortion rights, as shown by his high ratings from Planned Parenthood and NARAL Pro-Choice America and low rating from the National Right to Life Committee. But at the height of national polarization after the Supreme Court&#x27;s intention to overturn &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; had been leaked, Clyburn controversially campaigned on behalf of anti-abortion incumbent Representative Henry Cuellar, who faced a pro-choice primary challenger.

;Education

Clyburn has continuously sought new and additional funding for education. He has gained additional funding for special education and lower interest rates on federal student loans. In many sessions Clyburn has sought, sponsored and/or voted for improvements in Pell Grant funding for college loans.

The National Education Association and the National Association of Elementary School Principals rate Clyburn very highly, as do other education interest groups.

;Ports
Although he was criticized for a previous expenditure of 160 million dollars to expand South Carolina&#x27;s ports, Clyburn said he would continue to make funding available for further expansions. The plan is to deepen the ports to allow for larger commercial ships to arrive from the Panama Canal, which is being expanded to allow for larger ships to pass through. This is primarily because of larger commercial ships from China, and China&#x27;s extremely high demand for soybeans, which are produced in South Carolina but must be sent to larger ports for exporting. This measure will benefit South Carolina business and farmers and is thus heavily backed by these groups.

;Labor
Clyburn has consistently voted for increases in minimum wage income and to restrict employer interference with labor union organization.

Many national labor unions, including the AFL–CIO, the United Auto Workers, the Communication Workers Association, and the International Brotherhood of Boilermakers, give Clyburn outstanding ratings based on his voting record on issues that pertain to labor and employment.

;Environment

Clyburn has opposed legislation to increase offshore drilling for oil or natural gas. Instead, he has promoted use of nuclear energy as a cheaper alternative to fossil fuels than wind and solar energy. Members of the nuclear power industry have said that there is mutual respect between Clyburn and themselves. Clyburn pushed for a 2010 contract to convert plutonium from old weapons into nuclear fuel.

Organizations such as the League of Conservation Voters and Defenders of Wildlife have viewed Clyburn favorably, but he angered environmentalists when he proposed building a $150 million bridge across a swampy area of Lake Marion in Calhoun County.

;Objection to the 2004 presidential election
Clyburn was one of 31 House Democrats who voted not to count Ohio&#x27;s 20 electoral votes in the 2004 presidential election. George W. Bush won Ohio by 118,457 votes. Without Ohio&#x27;s electoral votes, the election would have been decided by the U.S. House of Representatives, with each state having one vote in accordance with the Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

;War in Iraq
On July 31, 2007, Clyburn said in a broadcast interview that it would be a &quot;real big problem&quot; for the Democratic Party if General David Petraeus issued a positive report in September, as it would split the Democratic caucus on whether to continue to fund the Iraq War. While this soundbite caused some controversy, the full quote was, in reference to the 47-member Blue Dog caucus, &quot;I think there would be enough support in that group to want to stay the course and if the Republicans were to stay united as they have been, then it would be a problem for us.&quot;

;Bill Clinton comments
Clyburn was officially neutral during the 2008 primary battle between Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, but former President Bill Clinton blamed Clyburn for Hillary&#x27;s 29-point defeat in the South Carolina primary and the two of them had a heated telephone conversation. Clyburn had voted for Obama, saying, &quot;How could I ever look in the faces of our children and grandchildren had I not voted for Barack Obama?&quot; He negatively viewed Bill Clinton&#x27;s remarks about Obama winning the South Carolina primary. Clinton had compared Obama&#x27;s victory to Jesse Jackson&#x27;s win in the 1988 primary. &quot;Black people are incensed all over this&quot;, Clyburn said. Clinton responded that the campaign &quot;played the race card on me&quot;, denying any racial tone in the comment. Speaking to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Clyburn said such actions could lead to a longtime division between Clinton and his once most reliable constituency. &quot;When he was going through his impeachment problems, it was the black community that bellied up to the bar&quot;, Clyburn said. &quot;I think black folks feel strongly that this is a strange way for President Clinton to show his appreciation.&quot;

;Impeachments of Bill Clinton and Donald Trump
On December 19, 1998, Clyburn voted against all four articles of impeachment against President Bill Clinton. On December 18, 2019, Clyburn voted for both articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump. On January 13, 2021, one week after the January 6 United States Capitol attack, Clyburn voted for the single article of impeachment against Trump.

;Israel
In January 2017, Clyburn voted against a House resolution condemning the UN Security Council Resolution 2334, which called Israeli settlement building in the occupied Palestinian territories in the West Bank a &quot;flagrant violation&quot; of international law and a major obstacle to peace. He voted to provide Israel with support following 2023 Hamas attack on Israel

;Homosexuality and same-sex marriage
In 1996, Clyburn voted in favor of the Defense of Marriage Act. The act restricted federal recognition of marriage to the union of a man and a woman, and explicitly granted states the power not to introduce same-sex marriage and refuse to acknowledge same-sex marriages granted under the laws of other states. The House Judiciary Committee had explicitly said the act was meant to &quot;express moral disapproval of homosexuality&quot;. The act passed by an 85-vote majority in the Senate and was signed into law by President Bill Clinton.

In 2012, after Obama&#x27;s public endorsement of same-sex marriage, Clyburn said in an interview that he too supported same-sex marriage. In the interview, he said his former disapproval was rooted in his Christian faith, but that he had since &quot;evolved&quot;. Clyburn called for nationwide legislation of marriage equality, opposing Obama&#x27;s state-by-state approach, saying, &quot;if you consider this to be a civil right—and I do—I don&#x27;t think civil rights ought to be left up to a state-by-state approach&quot;.

During the 2020 Democratic presidential primaries, when considering an endorsement, Clyburn cited Pete Buttigieg&#x27;s sexual orientation as an issue, saying it was &quot;no question&quot; that his sexuality would hurt his popularity and that &quot;[he] knew a lot of people [his] age that felt that way.&quot; Clyburn added, &quot;I&#x27;m not going to sit here and tell you otherwise, because I think everybody knows that&#x27;s an issue.&quot; In the wake of his comments, then-candidate Kamala Harris dismissed his comments as &quot;nonsense&quot; and &quot;a trope&quot; of the African American community, but the Benson Strategy Group reported that &quot;being gay was a barrier for these voters, particularly for the men who seemed uncomfortable discussing it.&quot;

===Committee assignments===
On April 2, 2020, Pelosi announced that Clyburn would chair the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis.

* Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction (2011–2012)

===Caucus memberships===
* Congressional Black Caucus
* House Democratic Caucus 
*United States Congressional International Conservation Caucus
* Congressional Arts Caucus
* Congressional Cement Caucus
* United States–China Working Group

==Presidential endorsements==

Clyburn is considered a power broker in South Carolina. For almost 30 years, he has hosted an annual fish fry &quot;that every four years becomes a must-attend event for presidential hopefuls.&quot;

During the 2004 Democratic presidential primaries, Clyburn supported former House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt until he dropped out of the race and then supported John Kerry. Clyburn was one of the 31 who voted in the House not to count Ohio&#x27;s electoral votes in the 2004 presidential election amid a dispute over irregularities.

Like other Democratic congressional leaders, Clyburn remained publicly uncommitted throughout most of the 2008 presidential primary elections. Despite being officially neutral, Clyburn voted for Obama in the South Carolina primary. Former President Bill Clinton accused Clyburn of being responsible for Hillary&#x27;s 29-point defeat in South Carolina, while Clyburn criticized Bill Clinton&#x27;s comments on race comparing Obama&#x27;s win to that of Jesse Jackson. Clyburn endorsed Obama on June 3, immediately before the Montana and South Dakota primaries. By that time, Obama&#x27;s lead in pledged delegates was substantial enough that those two primaries could not undo it.

Clyburn endorsed Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential campaign.

Clyburn&#x27;s endorsement of Joe Biden on February 26, 2020, three days before the South Carolina primary, was considered pivotal in the 2020 Democratic presidential primaries. Several analyses have determined the endorsement changed the trajectory of the race, due to Clyburn&#x27;s influence over the state&#x27;s African-Americans, who make up the majority of its Democratic electorate. Until Clyburn&#x27;s endorsement, Biden had not won a single primary and had placed fourth, fifth, and a distant second in the Iowa, New Hampshire, and Nevada caucuses and primaries, respectively. Three days after the South Carolina primary, Biden took a delegate lead on Super Tuesday, and a month later he clinched the nomination. Biden went on to win the 2020 Presidential election. Clyburn&#x27;s endorsement of Biden, and subsequent political endorsements in later democratic primaries, have given him a reputation as a political &quot;kingmaker&quot;.

In 2024, amidst calls from other Democrats for Biden to withdraw from his 2024 presidential campaign, Clyburn stated his support for Biden, but also that he would back Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic presidential candidate if Biden were to withdraw, which eventually came to happen.

<text>Buckland Dinham is a small village near Frome in Somerset, England. The village has a population of 381. The village&#x27;s main industry is farming (arable and dairy), but the village is also a dormitory village for the nearby cities of Bath and Bristol.

==History==
In 951 King Eadred granted land at Buckland to his relative Ælfhere.

The village used to be known as Buckland Denham. Denham is believed to be a family name (there are many other villages with Denham in their name) whilst Buckland may refer to a former deer population. Although Buckland Dinham itself does not have a manor house, it is close to Orchardleigh Estate.

There are signs of prehistoric archaeology. A hand axe has been found in Lower Street (which follows the spring line). Kingsdown Camp is an Iron Age hill fort. It is a Scheduled Ancient Monument. It is a univallate fort with an area of , and is approximately quadrilateral in shape. In the Iron Age or Roman period a drystone wall was constructed, possibly high and wide. There is an entrance on the northeast side. The fort continued to be used by the Romans.

The parish of Buckland Denham was part of the Kilmersdon Hundred.

The Dorset and Somerset Canal&#x27;s branch to the Somerset coalfields would have passed via the bottom end of the Buckland vale, had it ever been completed. It is now just off the route of NCR 24, the Colliers Way. The Murtry Aqueduct remains. Fussell&#x27;s balance locks were built on the side of Barrow Hill, an extension of the hill on which Buckland Dinham is perched.

==Governance==

The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council&#x27;s operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council&#x27;s role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council.

The village falls within the Non-metropolitan district of Mendip, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, having previously been part of Frome Rural District, which is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism.

Somerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, policing and fire services, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning.

It is also part of the Frome and East Somerset county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election, and was part of the South West England constituency of the European Parliament prior to Britain leaving the European Union in January 2020, which elected seven MEPs using the d&#x27;Hondt method of party-list proportional representation.

==Geography==

Geographically, the village is on the side of a hill (known as Buckland Down). It looks out over a vale formed by several small streams, in particular the Buckland Brook, which leads southwards towards Frome (and other villages such as Great Elm and Mells). The Buckland Brook skirts the north-eastern side of the village.

==Transport==

It is on the A362 road from Radstock to Frome. Coming off this at the bottom of the hill is Lower Street, which subsequently turns uphill (as Sands Cross Hill) before looping back to the main road at the top of the village, opposite the &quot;Bell&quot; public house. Lanes also lead off to Lullington and Great Elm.

Buckland Dinham has never had a railway station, although the Great Western Railway branch from Frome to Radstock (and thence to Bristol) passes by the bottom of the valley. This is today unused by passenger trains, but limestone trains to Whatley Quarry use the line. They then seem to disappear into a clump of trees; in reality, a tunnel entrance is hidden, leading to Vallis Vale and the quarry.

==Religious sites==

The Church of St. Michael has a nave, chancel, south chapel and south porch which dates from around 1200. The north chapel was added in 1325, and a further chapel to the north of the chancel and the west tower being added in 1480. It underwent restoration in the late 19th century. It has been designated as a Grade I listed building.

<text>Levanta (previously [[Linuxcare]]) was a company based in San Mateo, California, United States, that created products for Linux management and data virtualization.

==Company history==

Linuxcare was founded in San Francisco in 1998 by Dave Sifry, Arthur Tyde and Dave LaDuke. The company&#x27;s initial goal was to be &quot;the 800 number for Linux&quot; and operate 24 hours a day. In the late 1990s, Linux was slowly gaining in popularity as both a desktop and server operating system. A common complaint was that Linux was inappropriate in business environments because obtaining support for Linux involved newsgroups, mailing lists, and websites operated by volunteers. Linuxcare intended to hire some of the disparate Linux experts and get them working together to provide reliable support, for which individuals and businesses would pay.

When Dell started to ship desktop computers with Red Hat Linux pre-installed in 1999, they bundled a coupon that allowed a certain number of free support calls to Linuxcare.

Several of the people that Linuxcare eventually hired were developers of well-known open source software projects:

* Rasmus Lerdorf worked on PHP
* Martin Pool worked on Apache
* Rusty Russell worked on ipchains
* Richard Morrell founded SmoothWall
* Andrew Tridgell worked on samba, rsync

These experts were allowed to use company time to develop their projects, and were expected to help with technical support in their areas of expertise.

They also hired a number of people from the open source support community including the Linux Gazette &quot;Answer Guy&quot; (Jim Dennis).

Linuxcare had four divisions: Linuxcare Labs that tested and certified hardware systems for Linux compatibility, Linuxcare University, which provided training, Professional Services which provided consultants to other companies and Research and Development that concentrated on enhancing open source software.

Some of their early training engagements included courses presented to customer technical support and sales engineering staff for SGI, Motorola Computer Products, and others. The training materials were primarily focused around LPI topics and certification (systems administration). Linuxcare was a significant support of the early LPI work and former Linuxcare employees (including Jim Lacey, current president and CEO of LPI who was in charge of Linuxcare University).

In December 1999, Linuxcare acquired Ottawa-based consulting company The Puffin Group and the Italian company Prosa. Linuxcare was preparing for an initial public offering in early 2000, until it fired its CEO Fernand Sarrat and CIO Doug Nassaur. Shortly after, around 33% of the company was laid off. In January 2001, Turbolinux and Linuxcare began discussing a merger, but it was called off in May 2001.

Following the withdrawal of its IPO registration statement, Linuxcare changed direction and began developing Linux-based software. Over the next several years, the company became much smaller, replaced most of its staff and board, relocated to San Mateo, California, received new venture capital investments, and, in 2004, changed its name to Levanta (the name of its flagship software product). As Levanta, the company no longer provided Linux technical support.

Levanta changed from software to hardware product model and in 2005 introduced the Intrepid, the industry&#x27;s first Linux management appliance, which permitted machine provisioning, change control and limited content management for multiple Linux distributions. The initial Intrepid M offering was followed by the high-availability Intrepid X model, which provided warm-failover capability. Finally the Intrepid M designation was changed to refer only to models using external NAS storage served by a NetApp filer; the model with its own internal storage was then redesignated Intrepid S. The last Intrepid release included monitoring capability for managed machines and the Intrepid itself plus a sophisticated policy engine that permitted on-the-fly rebooting or rebinding of managed machines to new ones from a reserved pool as dictated by policy rules.

Levanta laid off all employees and sold its intellectual property on March 31, 2008.

The rights to the Linuxcare brand were repurchased in 2009, and the company has been reborn as Linuxcare LLC, based in San Francisco.

<text>Thomas Michael Bond (13 January 1926 – 27 June 2017) was an English author. He is best known for a series of children&#x27;s books featuring the character of Paddington Bear. More than 35 million books in the series have been sold worldwide, and the characters have also appeared in several animated television series, a film series, and a .

==Early life==
Thomas Michael Bond was born on 13 January 1926 in Newbury, Berkshire. He grew up in Reading, where his visits to Reading railway station to watch the &quot;Cornish Riviera Express&quot; pass through started a love of trains. His father was a manager for the post office. He was educated at Presentation College in Reading. His time there was unhappy. He told &quot;The Guardian&quot; in November 2014 that his parents had chosen the school &quot;for the simple reason [that his] mother liked the colour of the blazers ... she didn&#x27;t make many mistakes in life, but that was one of them&quot;. He left education aged 14, despite his parents&#x27; wishes for him to go to university. The Second World War was under way and he went to work in a solicitor&#x27;s office for a year, and then as an engineer&#x27;s assistant for the BBC.

On 10 February 1943 Bond survived an air raid in Reading. The building in which he was working collapsed under him, killing 41 people and injuring many more. Shortly afterwards he volunteered for aircrew service in the Royal Air Force as a 17-year-old, but he was discharged after being found to suffer from acute air sickness. He then served in the Middlesex Regiment of the British Army until 1947.

==Author==

Bond began writing in 1945, when he was stationed with the Army in Cairo, and sold his first short story to the magazine &quot;London Opinion&quot;. He was paid seven guineas and thought that he &quot;wouldn&#x27;t mind being a writer&quot;. After he&#x27;d produced several plays and short stories, and had become a BBC television cameraman (he worked on &quot;Blue Peter&quot; for a time), his first book, &quot;A Bear Called Paddington&quot;, was published by Collins in 1958. Barbara Ker Wilson had read his draft at one sitting and she then phoned Bond at the number given. She was put through to Lime Grove Studios. Bond had to tell her that he wasn&#x27;t supposed to take calls at work.

This was the start of Bond&#x27;s series of books recounting the tales of Paddington Bear, a bear from &quot;darkest Peru&quot;, whose Aunt Lucy sends him to the United Kingdom, carrying a jar of marmalade. In the first book the Brown family find the bear at Paddington Station, and adopt him, naming the bear after the station. By 1965 Bond was able to give up his BBC job to work full time as a writer.

Paddington&#x27;s adventures have sold over 35 million books, have been published in nearly 20 countries, in over 40 languages, and have inspired pop bands, race horses, plays, hot air balloons, movies and adaptations for television. Bond stated in December 2007 that he did not plan to continue the adventures of Paddington Bear in further volumes, but in April 2014 it was reported that a new book, entitled &quot;Love From Paddington&quot;, would be published that autumn. In &quot;Paddington&quot;, a 2014 film based on the books, Bond had a credited cameo as the Kindly Gentleman.

Bond also wrote another series of children&#x27;s books, telling of the adventures of a guinea pig named Olga da Polga, who was named after the Bond family&#x27;s pet, as well as the animated BBC television series &quot;The Herbs&quot; (1968). Bond also wrote culinary mystery stories for adults, featuring Monsieur Pamplemousse and his faithful bloodhound Pommes Frites.

Bond wrote &quot;Reflection on the Passing of the Years&quot; shortly after his 90th birthday. The piece was read by Sir David Attenborough, who also turned 90 in 2016, at the national service of thanksgiving to commemorate Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s 90th birthday at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral in June 2016. 

On 20 June 2016 StudioCanal acquired the Paddington franchise outright. Bond was allowed to keep the publishing rights to his series, which he licensed in April 2017 to HarperCollins for the next six years.

==Television writing==
Bond wrote two short films for the BBC: &quot;Simon&#x27;s Good Deed&quot;, which was shown on 11 October 1955, and &quot;Napoleon&#x27;s Day Out&quot;, shown on 9 April 1957. He also wrote one episode of the series &quot;The World Our Stage&quot;, an adaptation of the short story &quot;The Decoration&quot; by Guy de Maupassant, which aired on 4 January 1958.

His best known television work is as the creator and writer of the children&#x27;s television series &quot;The Herbs&quot; and &quot;The Adventures of Parsley&quot;, again for the BBC.

==Honours==
Bond was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE), for services to children&#x27;s literature, in the 1997 Birthday Honours and Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2015 Birthday Honours. On 6 July 2007 the University of Reading awarded him an Honorary Doctor of Letters.

On 10 January 2018 GWR named one of their Class 800 trains &quot;Michael Bond / Paddington Bear&quot;.

==Personal life and death==

Bond was married twice: to Brenda Mary Johnson in 1950, from whom he separated in the 1970s; and to Susan Marfrey Rogers in 1981. He had two children. He lived in London, not far from Paddington Station, the place that inspired many of his books.

Bond died in London on 27 June 2017, at the age of 91. The cause of death was not disclosed. The film &quot;Paddington 2&quot; (2017) was dedicated to his memory. He is buried in Paddington Old Cemetery close to where he lived. The epitaph on his gravestone reads &quot;Please look after this bear. Thank you.&quot;

In 2022, on the ITV programme &quot;DNA Journeys&quot;, it was discovered that Bond is a relative of the television presenter Kate Garraway.

<text>London Buses route 11 is a Transport for London contracted bus route in London, England. Running between Fulham Town Hall and Waterloo station, it is operated by Go-Ahead London.

==History==

Route 11 was introduced by the London General Omnibus Company in August 1906, and is amongst the oldest routes to have operated continuously in London, although its route has changed on several occasions. It was the first route operated by London Road-Car Co Ltd, running from Victoria to Hammersmith via Chelsea. From 1916, LGOC B-type buses allocated to Old Kent Road garage were used until 1924, when it was allocated to Kingston garage.

On 5 August 1922, Leyland LB (London Bus) type buses were introduced on route 11 by Arthur George Partridge and Christopher Dodson Ltd with chocolate livery and the fleet name &quot;Express&quot;. The first AEC NS-Type buses entered service on route 11 in May 1923. On 5 September 1932, Q1 buses were used on this route which operated from Shoreditch to Shepherd&#x27;s Bush.

In May 1949, Leyland Titan RTW buses were introduced on route 11. AEC Regent III RT buses were in service on route 11 in the 1950s. On 12 June 1959, the fourth AEC Routemaster in passenger service (RM14), entered service on route 11 from Riverside garage.

The route starts at Fulham Broadway and operates via the West End and some of London&#x27;s most famous landmarks to Waterloo station. The journey from the top deck is a cheap means of sightseeing in London. It previously ran to Hammersmith until being replaced west of Fulham Broadway on 17 July 1993 by route 211.

In October 1996, London General buses operating on route 11 from its Waterloo garage switched to City Diesel.

On 4 June 2002, Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s Golden Jubilee, the Metropolitan Police flagged down a Number 11 bus and used it as temporary transport for twenty-three peaceful anti-royalty demonstrators whom they had arrested after the demonstration, most of them in a nearby pub. The bus was used to take the protestors to various police stations for questioning. The protesters sued the police, and the Met settled out of court with an apology, an admission of unlawful detention, and a payment of £3,500 to each protester.

The route has a cameo appearance in the 2006 film &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot;, where the protagonists take a number 11 bus from near Temple Church to get to &quot;Chelsea Library&quot;, though they get off at Westminster Abbey; this is the same route the bus takes in real life.

Go-Ahead London has successfully retained route 11 with new contracts starting on 30 October 2010 and 31 October 2015.

New Routemasters were introduced on 21 September 2013. In September 2016, conductors were removed from buses on route 11 and buses now operate with drivers only and the rear platform closed.

In 2021, the frequency of the service was reduced from six buses per hour to five on Monday to Sunday daytimes.

In July 2022, Transport for London opened a public consultation on proposals for the route to be withdrawn as part of the Central London Buses Review. In November 2022, it was announced that the route would not be withdrawn but would instead be rerouted to terminate at Waterloo station instead of Liverpool Street station. This change was implemented on 29 April 2023.

==Current route==
Route 11 operates via these primary locations:
* Fulham Town Hall
* Chelsea &quot;World&#x27;s End&quot;
* King&#x27;s Road
* Sloane Square station 
* Victoria Coach Station 
* Victoria station 
* St James&#x27;s Park station 
* Westminster station 
* St Thomas&#x27; Hospital
* Waterloo station 

The bus route passes many tourist attractions including:

*Westminster Cathedral
*Westminster Abbey
*Methodist Central Hall Westminster
*St Margaret&#x27;s, Westminster
*Churchill War Rooms
It also went near the Royal Courts of Justice, St Clement Danes, Aldwych station, High Commission of Australia, Savoy Hotel, Nelson&#x27;s Column, Admiralty Arch, Big Ben, Palace of Westminster and New Scotland Yard. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; called the route one of the &quot;best routes for sightseeing on a shoestring&quot;. There is an e-book tour guide indicating the points of interest along the number 11 bus route and detailing connecting buses to other London tourist attractions.

<text>Tuusula (; ) is a municipality in Finland, located in the southern interior of the country. Tuusula is situated in the centre of the Uusimaa region. The population of Tuusula is approximately . It is the most populous municipality in Finland and the second most populous municipality without city status () after Nurmijärvi. Tuusula is part of the Helsinki metropolitan area, which has approximately  million inhabitants. 

A laurel branch in the coat of arms of Tuusula refers to the local artist community and a wheellock was borrowed from the coat of arms of the Stålhane noble family, which has long been influential in Tuusula. The coat of arms was designed by Olof Eriksson in 1953.

==Geography==
Tuusula, lying on the shores of Tuusulanjärvi lake, is located in the province of Southern Finland and is part of the Uusimaa region. It covers an area of of
which 
is water. The population density is

Tuusula has three population centres. The administrative centre is Hyrylä (about 19,500 residents), other two are Jokela (5,300 residents) and Kellokoski (4,300 residents). The remaining 4,400 residents are distributed to the rural areas outside of municipal centres. The most significant main road connection between Hyrylä and Helsinki is the Tuusulanväylä motorway.

The neighbouring communes are Vantaa to the south, Nurmijärvi to the west, Hyvinkää to the north, Mäntsälä and Järvenpää to the north east, and Sipoo and Kerava to the east.

==History==
The area in what is now Tuusula was located in the larger municipality of Sipoo. In 1643, it became a separate parish in the municipality, and in 1653, it became a separate municipality. Tuusula&#x27;s boundaries have not always remained the same: in 1924 the municipality of Kerava split from here; in 1950 the municipality of Korso was split between Tuusula, Kerava, and Sipoo; and in 1951 the municipality of Järvenpää split from here.

During the Crimean War (1853–1856), a Russian garrison was stationed in what is now Hyrylä. The modern parish mostly developed around it.

The area had always been a fairly fertile area, thus encouraging farming. The development of other industries began in 1795, when an ironworks was created in Kellokoski that functioned until the 1980s. The establishment of a railway in Jokela furthered the growth.

Soon after this industrial time another aspect of Tuusulan history was realised. The Tuusulanjärvi lake attracted many artists who wanted to paint the beautiful landscape. Following the footsteps of Aleksis Kivi, the Finnish national poet who spent the last years of his life in a hut on the shores of the lake, Jean Sibelius, Juhani Aho, and Pekka Halonen even established their main residences here. Recently these houses have become tourist sites, especially Sibelius&#x27; house Ainola. Also, Tuusula Lake Road on the eastern shore of the lake is an outside museum.

The Jokela rail crash was a rail crash which occurred on 21 April 1996 here.

Jokela High School was the site of the Jokela school shooting, a school shooting which occurred on 7 November 2007, leaving 9 dead (including the 18-year-old perpetrator, Pekka-Eric Auvinen).

<doc id="784781" wikidata="Q208511" url="?curid=784781" title="Global city">
<text>A global city is a city that serves as a primary node in the global economic network. The concept originates from geography and urban studies, based on the thesis that globalization has created a hierarchy of strategic geographic locations with varying degrees of influence over finance, trade, and culture worldwide. The global city represents the most complex and significant hub within the international system, characterized by links binding it to other cities that have direct, tangible effects on global socioeconomic affairs.

The criteria of a global city vary depending on the source. Common features include a high degree of urban development, a large population, the presence of major multinational companies, a significant and globalized financial sector, a well-developed and internationally linked transportation infrastructure, local or national economic dominance, high quality educational and research institutions, and a globally influential output of ideas, innovations, or cultural products. Quintessential examples, based on most indices and research, include New York City, London, Paris, and Tokyo.

==Origin and terminology==
The term &#x27;global city&#x27; was popularized by sociologist Saskia Sassen in her 1991 book, &quot;The Global City: New York, London, Tokyo&quot;. Before then, other terms were used for urban centers with roughly the same features. The term &#x27;world city&#x27;, meaning a city heavily involved in global trade, appeared in a May 1886 description of Liverpool, by &quot;The Illustrated London News&quot;; British sociologist and geographer Patrick Geddes used the term in 1915. The term &#x27;megacity&#x27; entered common use in the late 19th or early 20th century, the earliest known example being a publication by the University of Texas in 1904. In the 21st century, the terms are usually focused on a city&#x27;s financial power and high technology infrastructure.

==Criteria==
Competing groups have devised competing means to classify and rank world cities and to distinguish them from other cities. Although there is a consensus on the leading world cities, the chosen criteria affect which other cities are included. Selection criteria may be based on a yardstick value (e.g., if the producer-service sector is the largest sector then city is a world city) or on an imminent determination (if the producer-service sector of city is greater than the combined producer-service sectors of other cities then city is a world city.) Although criteria are variable and fluid, typical characteristics of world cities include:
* The most prominent criterion has been providing a variety of international financial services, notably in finance, insurance, real estate, banking, accountancy, and marketing; and their amalgamation of financial headquarters, a stock exchange, and other major financial institutions,
* Headquarters of numerous multinational corporations,
* Domination of the trade and economy of a large surrounding area,
* Major manufacturing centers with port and container facilities,
* Considerable decision-making power daily and at a global level,
* Centers of new ideas and innovation in business, economics, and culture,
* Centers of digital and other media and communications for global networks,
* The dominance of the national region with great international significance,
* The high percentage of residents employed in the services sector and information sector,
* High-quality educational institutions, including renowned universities and research facilities; and attracting international student attendance,
* Multi-functional infrastructure offering some of the best legal, medical, and entertainment facilities in the country,
* High diversity in language, culture, religion, and ideologies.

<text>In mathematics, particularly in operator theory and C*-algebra theory, the continuous functional calculus is a functional calculus which allows the application of a continuous function to normal elements of a C*-algebra.

In advanced theory, the applications of this functional calculus are so natural that they are often not even mentioned. It is no overstatement to say that the continuous functional calculus makes &quot;the&quot; difference between C*-algebras and general Banach algebras, in which only a holomorphic functional calculus exists.

== Motivation ==

If one wants to extend the natural functional calculus for polynomials on the spectrum formula_1 of an element formula_2 of a Banach algebra formula_3 to a functional calculus for continuous functions formula_4 on the spectrum, it seems obvious to approximate a continuous function by polynomials according to the Stone-Weierstrass theorem, to insert the element into these polynomials and to show that this sequence of elements converges to 
The continuous functions on formula_5 are approximated by polynomials in formula_6 and formula_7, i.e. by polynomials of the form Here, formula_7 denotes the complex conjugation, which is an involution on the 
To be able to insert formula_2 in place of formula_6 in this kind of polynomial, Banach *-algebras are considered, i.e. Banach algebras that also have an involution *, and formula_11 is inserted in place of In order to obtain a homomorphism formula_12, a restriction to normal elements, i.e. elements with formula_13, is necessary, as the polynomial ring formula_14 is commutative.
If formula_15 is a sequence of polynomials that converges uniformly on formula_1 to a continuous function formula_17, the convergence of the sequence formula_18 in formula_3 to an element formula_20 must be ensured. A detailed analysis of this convergence problem shows that it is necessary to resort to C*-algebras. These considerations lead to the so-called continuous functional calculus.

== Theorem ==

Due to the *-homomorphism property, the following calculation rules apply to all functions formula_21 and scalars formula_22:

One can therefore imagine actually inserting the normal elements into continuous functions; the obvious algebraic operations behave as expected.

The requirement for a unit element is not a significant restriction. If necessary, a unit element can be adjoined, yielding the enlarged C*-algebra Then if formula_23 and formula_24 with formula_25, it follows that formula_26 and 

The existence and uniqueness of the continuous functional calculus are proven separately:

* &quot;Existence:&quot; Since the spectrum of formula_2 in the C*-subalgebra formula_28 generated by formula_2 and formula_30 is the same as it is in formula_3, it suffices to show the statement for The actual construction is almost immediate from the Gelfand representation: it suffices to assume formula_3 is the C*-algebra of continuous functions on some compact space formula_33 and define 

* &quot;Uniqueness:&quot; Since formula_34 and formula_35 are fixed, formula_36 is already uniquely defined for all polynomials formula_37, since formula_36 is a *-homomorphism. These form a dense subalgebra of formula_4 by the Stone-Weierstrass theorem. Thus formula_36 is 

In functional analysis, the continuous functional calculus for a normal operator formula_41 is often of interest, i.e. the case where formula_3 is the C*-algebra formula_43 of bounded operators on a Hilbert space In the literature, the continuous functional calculus is often only proved for self-adjoint operators in this setting. In this case, the proof does not need the Gelfand 

== Further properties of the continuous functional calculus ==

The continuous functional calculus formula_36 is an isometric isomorphism into the C*-subalgebra formula_28 generated by formula_2 and formula_30, that is:

* formula_48 for all formula_49; formula_36 is therefore continuous.
* formula_51

Since formula_2 is a normal element of formula_3, the C*-subalgebra generated by formula_2 and formula_30 is commutative. In particular, formula_20 is normal and all elements of a functional calculus 

The holomorphic functional calculus is extended by the continuous functional calculus in an unambiguous Therefore, for polynomials formula_57 the continuous functional calculus corresponds to the natural functional calculus for polynomials: formula_58 for all 

For a sequence of functions formula_59 that converges uniformly on formula_1 to a function formula_49, formula_62 converges to For a power series formula_63, which converges absolutely uniformly on formula_1, therefore formula_65 

If formula_66 and formula_67, then formula_68 holds for their If formula_69 are two normal elements with formula_70 and formula_71 is the inverse function of formula_17 on both formula_1 and formula_74, then formula_75, since 

The &quot;spectral mapping theorem&quot; applies: formula_76 for all 

If formula_77 holds for formula_78, then formula_79 also holds for all formula_80, i.e. if formula_81 commutates with formula_2, then also with the corresponding elements of the continuous functional calculus 

Let formula_83 be an unital *-homomorphism between C*-algebras formula_3 and Then formula_85 commutates with the continuous functional calculus. The following holds: formula_86 for all In particular, the continuous functional calculus commutates with the Gelfand 

With the spectral mapping theorem, functions with certain properties can be directly related to certain properties of elements of C*-algebras:

* formula_20 is invertible if and only if formula_17 has no zero on Then formula_89 

* formula_20 is self-adjoint if and only if formula_17 is real-valued, i.e. 
* formula_20 is positive (formula_93) if and only if formula_94, i.e. 
* formula_20 is unitary if all values of formula_17 lie in the circle group, i.e. 
* formula_20 is a projection if formula_17 only takes on the values formula_99 and formula_100, i.e. 

These are based on statements about the spectrum of certain elements, which are shown in the Applications section.

In the special case that formula_3 is the C*-algebra of bounded operators formula_43 for a Hilbert space formula_103, eigenvectors formula_104 for the eigenvalue formula_105 of a normal operator formula_106 are also eigenvectors for the eigenvalue formula_107 of the operator If formula_108, then formula_109 also holds for all 

== Applications ==

The following applications are typical and very simple examples of the numerous applications of the continuous functional calculus:

=== Spectrum ===

Let formula_3 be a C*-algebra and formula_111 a normal element. Then the following applies to the spectrum 

* formula_2 is self-adjoint if and only if 
* formula_2 is unitary if and only if 
* formula_2 is a projection if and only if 

&quot;Proof.&quot; The continuous functional calculus formula_36 for the normal element formula_23 is a *-homomorphism with formula_117 and thus formula_2 is self-adjoint/unitary/a projection if formula_119 is also self-adjoint/unitary/a projection. Exactly then formula_120 is self-adjoint if formula_121 holds for all formula_122, i.e. if formula_1 is real. Exactly then formula_124 is unitary if formula_125 holds for all formula_122, therefore Exactly then formula_124 is a projection if and only if formula_128, that is formula_129 for all formula_122, i.e. formula_131

=== Roots ===

Let formula_2 be a positive element of a C*-algebra Then for every formula_133 there exists a uniquely determined positive element formula_134 with formula_135, i.e. a unique formula_136-th 

&quot;Proof.&quot; For each formula_133, the root function formula_138 is a continuous function on If formula_139 is defined using the continuous functional calculus, then formula_140 follows from the properties of the calculus. From the spectral mapping theorem follows formula_141, i.e. formula_81 is If formula_143 is another positive element with formula_144, then formula_145 holds, as the root function on the positive real numbers is an inverse function to the function 

If formula_146 is a self-adjoint element, then at least for every odd formula_147 there is a uniquely determined self-adjoint element formula_148 with 

Similarly, for a positive element formula_2 of a C*-algebra formula_3, each formula_151 defines a uniquely determined positive element formula_152 of formula_153, such that formula_154 holds for all If formula_2 is invertible, this can also be extended to negative values of 

=== Absolute value ===

If formula_23, then the element formula_157 is positive, so that the absolute value can be defined by the continuous functional calculus formula_158, since it is continuous on the positive real 

Let formula_2 be a self-adjoint element of a C*-algebra formula_3, then there exist positive elements formula_161, such that formula_162 with formula_163 holds. The elements formula_164 and formula_165 are also referred to as the In addition, formula_166 

&quot;Proof.&quot; The functions formula_167 and formula_168 are continuous functions on formula_169 with formula_170 and Put formula_171 and formula_172. According to the spectral mapping theorem, formula_164 and formula_165 are positive elements for which formula_175 and formula_176 Furthermore, formula_177, such that 

=== Unitary elements ===

If formula_2 is a self-adjoint element of a C*-algebra formula_3 with unit element formula_30, then formula_181 is unitary, where formula_182 denotes the imaginary unit. Conversely, if formula_183 is an unitary element, with the restriction that the spectrum is a proper subset of the unit circle, i.e. formula_184, there exists a self-adjoint element formula_146 with 

&quot;Proof.&quot; It is formula_186 with formula_187, since formula_2 is self-adjoint, it follows that formula_189, i.e. formula_17 is a function on the spectrum of Since formula_191, using the functional calculus formula_192 follows, i.e. formula_193 is unitary. Since for the other statement there is a formula_194, such that formula_195 the function formula_196 is a real-valued continuous function on the spectrum formula_197 for formula_198, such that formula_199 is a self-adjoint element that satisfies 

=== Spectral decomposition theorem ===

Let formula_3 be an unital C*-algebra and formula_111 a normal element. Let the spectrum consist of formula_136 pairwise disjoint closed subsets formula_203 for all formula_204, i.e. Then there exist projections formula_205 that have the following properties for all 

* For the spectrum, formula_206 holds.
* The projections commutate with formula_2, i.e. 
* The projections are orthogonal, i.e. 
* The sum of the projections is the unit element, i.e. 

In particular, there is a decomposition formula_208 for which formula_209 holds for all 

&quot;Proof.&quot; Since all formula_210 are closed, the characteristic functions formula_211 are continuous on Now let formula_212 be defined using the continuous functional. As the formula_210 are pairwise disjoint, formula_214 and formula_215 holds and thus the formula_216 satisfy the claimed properties, as can be seen from the properties of the continuous functional equation. For the last statement, let

<text>Rich Kids were a short-lived new wave band from London, founded in 1977 by Glen Matlock following his departure from the Sex Pistols. The band also included teenage guitarist Steve New, former Slik and future Ultravox member Midge Ure and Rusty Egan, who both later founded Visage together. They released one album and three singles during their existence, from March 1977 to December 1978 (although the official announcement of their disbanding was not made until mid-1979).

Rich Kids were amongst the foremost British exponents of the power pop style, blending influences from 1960s acts such as Small Faces and The Who with more recent punk rock sounds. Only the first of their three singles entered the Top 40 in the UK Singles Chart.

==Career==
Rich Kids were formed in 1977 by bass player Glen Matlock after he left the Sex Pistols. An early line-up consisted of keyboardist and guitar player Bill Smyth, Rusty Egan on drums, Steve New on lead guitar, and The Clash&#x27;s Mick Jones, who acted as a session live player. Glaswegian Midge Ure, whose band Slik had split up and reformed as the punk sounding PVC2, moved to London and joined Rich Kids. Smyth left the group followed by Jones, who continued with The Clash.

Rich Kids recorded their first set of radio sessions on 1 October 1977 for the 7 November broadcast of BBC Radio 1, hosted by DJ John Peel. Following on 13 January 1978, they were ranked at #24 on 4 February UK Charts with their first self-titled single &quot;Rich Kids&quot;. This caught more attention from the BBC, who invited them to perform on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; and several more sets for the short-lived live music TV series &quot;Revolver&quot; hosted by Peter Cook.

On 22 March, they recorded a further session for John Peel&#x27;s 3 April broadcast. Another single, &quot;Marching Men&quot; was released on 19 May as means to promote the release of their album produced by Mick Ronson. Despite taping a video promo for Donnie Sutherland and &quot;After Dark&quot;, the song did not chart. At their Lyceum show in spring 1978, Ronson played guitar and Ian McLagan (ex-Faces) played keyboards. Several of the band&#x27;s performances were featured in the 1980 film &quot;D.O.A.&quot;.

Matlock and New later played with Sid Vicious in the band Vicious White Kids, which only played one concert.

The Rich Kids released the album &quot;Ghosts of Princes in Towers&quot;, and the single of the same name, in August, with the latter ranking only at #51. Their last TV appearance was at the University of Reading where they taped a live show for &quot;Rock Goes to College&quot; on 27 October. But the band ran into creative differences as they recorded demos for a second album. Having acquired a synthesiser, Ure, alongside bandmate Egan, wanted to integrate the new instrument into the band&#x27;s sound while Matlock and New preferred to remain with traditional guitars and drums. This resulted in the group&#x27;s decision to go their separate ways.

Matlock and New went on to tour with Iggy Pop, while Egan and Ure formed a band called The Misfits (not the American horror punk band Misfits) and, after short spells with Skids and Thin Lizzy, respectively, reunited in Visage. In April 1979, Ure joined Ultravox.

On 7 January 2010, the band played a one-off reunion concert at The O2 Academy Islington, London in aid of Steve New. New died from cancer on 24 May 2010.

In February 2016, it was announced that Rich Kids, with Gary Kemp on lead guitar and James Hallawell (Waterboys) on keyboard, would reform for a joint headline show with The Professionals at London&#x27;s O2 Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Empire for 16 May. The show was rescheduled for 23 June due to the ongoing structural work at the venue.

The band reunited for a one-off appearance at the Vive Le Rock awards at The O2 Academy Islington, London on 27 March 2019, with Neal X of Sigue Sigue Sputnik standing in on lead guitar.

<text>A chiller is a machine that removes heat from a liquid coolant via a vapor-compression, adsorption refrigeration, or absorption refrigeration cycles. This liquid can then be circulated through a heat exchanger to cool equipment, or another process stream (such as air or process water). As a necessary by-product, refrigeration creates waste heat that must be exhausted to ambience, or for greater efficiency, recovered for heating purposes. Vapor compression chillers may use any of a number of different types of compressors. Most common today are the hermetic scroll, semi-hermetic screw, or centrifugal compressors. The condensing side of the chiller can be either air or water cooled. Even when liquid cooled, the chiller is often cooled by an induced or forced draft cooling tower. Absorption and adsorption chillers require a heat source to function.

Chilled water is used to cool and dehumidify air in mid- to large-size commercial, industrial, and institutional facilities. Water cooled chillers can be liquid-cooled (through cooling towers), air-cooled, or evaporatively cooled. Water or liquid-cooled systems can provide efficiency and environmental impact advantages over air-cooled systems.

==Use in air conditioning==

In air conditioning systems, chilled coolant, usually chilled water mixed with ethylene glycol, from a chiller in an air conditioning or cooling plant is typically distributed to heat exchangers, or coils, in air handlers or other types of terminal devices which cool the air in their respective . The water is then recirculated to the chiller to be recooled. These cooling coils transfer sensible heat and latent heat from the air to the chilled water, thus cooling and usually dehumidifying the air stream. A typical chiller for air conditioning applications is rated between and , and at least two manufacturers (York international and LG) can produce chillers capable of up to cooling. Chilled water temperatures (leaving from the chiller) usually range from , depending upon application requirements. Commonly, chillers receive water at 12°C (entering temperature), and cool it to 7°C (leaving temperature).

When the chillers for air conditioning systems are not operable or they are in need of repair or replacement, emergency chillers may be used to supply chilled water. Rental chillers are mounted on a trailer so that they can be quickly deployed to the site. Large chilled water hoses are used to connect between rental chillers and air conditioning systems.

==Use in industry==
In industrial applications, chilled water or other coolant liquid from the chiller is pumped through process or laboratory equipment. Industrial chillers are used for controlled cooling of products, mechanisms and factory machinery in a wide range of industries. They are often used in the plastic industries, injection and blow molding, metalworking cutting oils, welding equipment, die-casting and machine tooling, chemical processing, pharmaceutical formulation, food and beverage processing, paper and cement processing, vacuum systems, X-ray diffraction, power supplies and gas turbine power generation stations (see Turbine inlet air cooling#Vapour compression chiller), analytical equipment, semiconductors, compressed air and gas cooling. They are also used to cool high-heat specialized items such as MRI machines and lasers in hospitals, hotels, and campuses.

Chillers for industrial applications can be centralized, where a single chiller serves multiple cooling needs, or decentralized where each application or machine has its own chiller. Each approach has its advantages. It is also possible to have a combination of both centralized and decentralized chillers, especially if the cooling requirements are the same for some applications or points of use, but not all.

Chilled water is used to cool and dehumidify air in mid- to large-size commercial, industrial, and institutional (CII) facilities. Liquid chillers can be liquid-cooled, air-cooled, or evaporatively cooled. Water or liquid-cooled chillers incorporate the use of cooling towers which improve the chillers&#x27; thermodynamic effectiveness as compared to air-cooled chillers. This is due to heat rejection at or near the air&#x27;s wet-bulb temperature rather than the higher, sometimes much higher, dry-bulb temperature. Evaporatively cooled chillers offer higher efficiencies than air-cooled chillers but lower than liquid-cooled chillers.

Liquid-cooled chillers are typically intended for indoor installation and operation and are cooled by a separate condenser water loop and connected to outdoor cooling towers to expel heat to the atmosphere.

Air-cooled and evaporative cooled chillers are intended for outdoor installation and operation. Air-cooled machines are directly cooled by ambient air being mechanically circulated directly through the machine&#x27;s condenser coil to expel heat to the atmosphere. Evaporative cooled machines are similar, except they implement a mist of water over the condenser coil to aid in condenser cooling, making the machine more efficient than a traditional air-cooled machine. No remote cooling tower is typically required with either of these types of packaged air-cooled or evaporatively cooled chillers.

Where available, cold water readily available in nearby water bodies might be used directly for cooling, replacing or supplementing cooling towers. The deep water source cooling system in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, is an example. It uses cold lake water to cool the chillers, which in turn are used to cool city buildings via a district cooling system. The return water is used to warm the city&#x27;s drinking water supply, which is desirable in this cold climate. Whenever a chiller&#x27;s heat rejection can be used for a productive purpose, in addition to the cooling function, very high thermal effectiveness is possible.

==Vapor-compression chiller technology==
A vapor compression chiller typically uses one of four types of compressor: Reciprocating compression, scroll compression, screw-driven compression, and centrifugal compression are all mechanical machines that can be powered by electric motors, steam, or gas turbines. Using electric motors in a semi-hermetic or hermetic configuration is the most common method of driving the compressors since electric motors can be effectively and easily cooled by the refrigerant, without requiring fuel supply or exhaust ventilation and no shaft seals are required as the motor can operate in the refrigerant, reducing maintenance, leaks, operating costs and downtime, although open compressors are sometimes used. They produce their cooling effect via the reverse-Rankine cycle, also known as vapor-compression. With evaporative cooling heat rejection, their coefficients of performance (COPs) are very high; typically 4.0 or more.

::COP formula_1

Current vapor-compression chiller technology is based on the &quot;reverse-Rankine&quot; cycle known as vapor-compression.
See the attached diagram which outlines the key components of the chiller system.

Key components of the chiller:

Refrigeration compressors are essentially a pump for refrigerant gas. The capacity of the compressor,
and hence the chiller cooling capacity, is measured in kilowatts input (kW), Horse power input (HP), or
volumetric flow (m3/h, ft3/h). The mechanism for compressing refrigerant gas differs between
compressors, and each has its own application. Common refrigeration compressors include
reciprocating, scroll, screw, or centrifugal. These can be powered by electric motors, steam turbines, or
gas turbines. Compressors can have an integrated motor from a specific manufacturer, or be open drive--allowing the connection to another type of mechanical connection. Compressors can also be either hermetic (welded closed) or semi-hermetic (bolted together).

In recent years, application of variable-speed drive (VSD) technology has increased efficiencies of vapor
compression chillers. The first VSD was applied to centrifugal compressor chillers in the late 1970s and
has become the norm as the cost of energy has increased. Now, VSDs are being applied to rotary screw
and scroll-technology compressors.

Condensers can be air-cooled, liquid-cooled, or evaporative. The condenser is a heat exchanger which
allows heat to migrate from the refrigerant gas to either water or air. Air cooled condenser are
manufactured from copper tubes (for the refrigerant flow) and aluminium fins (for the air flow). Each
condenser has a different material cost and they vary in terms of efficiency. With evaporative cooling
condensers, their coefficients-of-performance (COPs) are very high; typically 4.0 or more. Air cooled condensers are installed and operated outdoors and are cooled with outside air, that is often forced through the condenser using electric fans. Water or liquid cooled condensers are cooled with water that is often in turn cooled by a cooling tower.

The expansion device (TEV) or refrigerant metering device (RMD) restricts the flow of the liquid refrigerant
causing a pressure drop that vaporizes some of the refrigerant; this vaporization absorbs heat from nearby liquid refrigerant.
The RMD is located immediately prior to the evaporator so that the cold gas in the evaporator can absorb
heat from the water in the evaporator. There is a sensor for the RMD on the evaporator outlet side which
allows the RMD to regulate the refrigerant flow based on the chiller design requirement.

Evaporators can be plate type or shell and tube type. The evaporator is a heat exchanger which allows
the heat energy to migrate from the water stream into the refrigerant gas. During the state change of the remaining
liquid to gas, the refrigerant can absorb large amounts of heat without changing temperature.

==How absorption technology works==
The thermodynamic cycle of an absorption chiller is driven by a heat source; this heat is usually delivered to the chiller via steam, hot water, or combustion. Compared to electrically powered chillers, an absorption chiller has very low electrical power requirements – very rarely above 15 kW combined consumption for both the solution pump and the refrigerant pump. However, its heat input requirements are large, and its COP is often 0.5 (single-effect) to 1.0 (double-effect). For the same cooling capacity, an absorption chiller requires a much larger cooling tower than a vapor-compression chiller. However, absorption chillers, from an energy-efficiency point of view, excel where cheap, low-grade heat or waste heat is readily available. In extremely sunny climates, solar energy has been used to operate absorption chillers.

The single-effect absorption cycle uses water as the refrigerant and lithium bromide as the absorbent. It is the strong affinity that these two substances have for one another that makes the cycle work. The entire process occurs in almost a complete vacuum.

#Solution Pump : A dilute lithium bromide solution (60% concentration) is collected in the bottom of the absorber shell. From here, a hermetic solution pump moves the solution through a shell and tube heat exchanger for preheating.
#Generator : After exiting the heat exchanger, the dilute solution moves into the upper shell. The solution surrounds a bundle of tubes which carries either steam or hot water. The steam or hot water transfers heat into the pool of dilute lithium bromide solution. The solution boils, sending refrigerant vapor upward into the condenser and leaving behind concentrated lithium bromide. The concentrated lithium bromide solution moves down to the heat exchanger, where it is cooled by the weak solution being pumped up to the generator.
#Condenser : The refrigerant vapor migrates through mist eliminators to the condenser tube bundle. The refrigerant vapor condenses on the tubes. The heat is removed by the cooling water which moves through the inside of the tubes. As the refrigerant condenses, it collects in a trough at the bottom of the condenser.
#Evaporator : The refrigerant liquid moves from the condenser in the upper shell down to the evaporator in the lower shell and is sprayed over the evaporator tube bundle. Due to the extreme vacuum of the lower shell [6 mm Hg (0.8 kPa) absolute pressure], the refrigerant liquid boils at approximately , creating the refrigerant effect. (This vacuum is created by hygroscopic action – the strong affinity lithium bromide has for water – in the Absorber directly below.)
#Absorber : As the refrigerant vapor migrates to the absorber from the evaporator, the strong lithium bromide solution from the generator is sprayed over the top of the absorber tube bundle. The strong lithium bromide solution actually pulls the refrigerant vapor into solution, creating the extreme vacuum in the evaporator. The absorption of the refrigerant vapor into the lithium bromide solution also generates heat which is removed by the cooling water. Now the dilute lithium bromide solution collects in the bottom of the lower shell, where it flows down to the solution pump. The chilling cycle is now completed and the process begins once again.

===Industrial chiller technology===
Industrial chillers typically come as complete, packaged, closed-loop systems, including the chiller unit, condenser, and pump station with recirculating pump, expansion valve, no-flow shutdown, internal cold water control. Compressors can be of two types - scroll and screw depending on the budget and the performance expected from a chiller. The internal tank helps maintain cold water temperature and prevents temperature spikes from occurring. Closed-loop industrial chillers recirculate a clean coolant or clean water with condition additives at a constant temperature and pressure to increase the stability and reproducibility of water-cooled machines and instruments. The water flows from the chiller to the application&#x27;s point of use and back.

If the water temperature differentials between inlet and outlet are high, then a large external water tank would be used to store the cold water. In this case the chilled water is not going directly from the chiller to the application, but goes to the external water tank which acts as a sort of &quot;temperature buffer.&quot; The cold water tank is much larger than the internal water goes from the external tank to the application and the return hot water from the application goes back to the external tank, not to the chiller.

The less common open loop industrial chillers control the temperature of a liquid in an open tank or sump by constantly recirculating it. The liquid is drawn from the tank, pumped through the chiller and back to the tank. In industrial water chillers is the use of water cooling instead of air cooling. In this case the condenser does not cool the hot refrigerant with ambient air, but uses water that is cooled by a cooling tower. This development allows a reduction in energy requirements by more than 15% and also allows a significant reduction in the size of the chiller, due to the small surface area of the water-based condenser and the absence of fans. Additionally, the absence of fans allows for significantly reduced noise levels.

Most industrial chillers use refrigeration as the media for cooling, but some rely on simpler techniques such as air or water flowing over coils containing the coolant to regulate temperature. Water is the most commonly used coolant within process chillers, although coolant mixtures (mostly water with a coolant additive to enhance heat dissipation) are frequently employed.

==Industrial chiller selection==
Important specifications to consider when searching for industrial chillers include the total life cycle cost, the power source, chiller IP rating, chiller cooling capacity, evaporator capacity, evaporator material, evaporator type, condenser material, condenser capacity, ambient temperature, motor fan type, noise level, internal piping materials, number of compressors, type of compressor, number of fridge circuits, coolant requirements, fluid discharge temperature, and COP (the ratio between the cooling capacity in RT to the energy consumed by the whole chiller in kW). For medium to large chillers this should range from 3.5 to 7.0, with higher values meaning higher efficiency. In the US, chiller efficiency is often specified in kilowatts per refrigeration ton (kW/RT).

Process pump specifications that are important to consider include the process flow, process pressure, pump material, elastomer and mechanical shaft seal material, motor voltage, motor electrical class, motor IP rating and pump rating. If the cold water temperature is lower than −5 °C, then a special pump needs to be used to be able to pump the high concentrations of ethylene glycol. Other important specifications include the internal water tank size and materials and full load current.

Control panel features that should be considered when selecting between industrial chillers include the local control panel, remote control panel, fault indicators, temperature indicators, and pressure indicators.

Additional features include emergency alarms, hot gas bypass, city water switchover, and casters.

Demountable chillers are also an option for deployment in remote areas and where the conditions may be hot and dusty.

If noise levels of the chiller are acoustically unacceptable, noise control engineers will implement sound attenuators to reduce chiller noise levels. Larger chillers will typically require an array of sound attenuators sometimes known as a silencer bank.

==Refrigerants==
A vapor-compression chiller uses a refrigerant internally as its working fluid. Many refrigerants options are available; when selecting a chiller, the application cooling temperature requirements and refrigerant&#x27;s cooling characteristics need to be matched. Important parameters to consider are the operating temperatures and pressures.

There are several environmental factors that concern refrigerants, and also affect the future availability for chiller applications. This is a key consideration in intermittent applications where a large chiller may last for 25 years or more. Ozone depletion potential (ODP) and global warming potential (GWP) of the refrigerant need to be considered. ODP and GWP data for some of the more common vapor-compression refrigerants (noting that many of these refrigerants are highly flammable and/or toxic):

R12 is the ODP reference. CO2 is the GWP reference

The refrigerants used in the chillers sold in Europe are mainly R410a (70%), R407c (20%) and R134a (10%).

<doc id="784872" wikidata="Q1059672" url="?curid=784872" title="Seikilos epitaph">
<text>The Seikilos epitaph is an Ancient Greek inscription that preserves the oldest surviving complete musical composition, including musical notation. Commonly dated between the 1st and 2nd century AD, the inscription was found engraved on a pillar (stele) from the ancient Greek town of Tralles (modern Aydın in present-day Turkey) in 1883. The stele includes two poems; an elegiac distich and a song with vocal notation signs above the words. A Hellenistic Ionic song, it is either in the Phrygian octave species or Ionian (Iastian) tonos. The melody of the song is recorded, alongside its lyrics, in ancient Greek musical notation. While older music with notation exists (e.g. the Hurrian songs or the Delphic Hymns), all of it is in fragments; the Seikilos epitaph is unique in that it is a complete, though short, composition.

Based on its structure and language, the artifact is generally understood to have been an epitaph (a tombstone inscription) created by a man named Seikilos and possibly dedicated to a woman named Euterpe. An alternative view, put forward by Armand D&#x27;Angour, holds that the inscription does not mark a tomb, but was instead a monument erected by Seikilos himself to commemorate his musical and poetic skill.

The Sekilos stele is an inscribed marble column from the ancient settlement of Tralles in western Anatolia, in what is now the city of Aydın, Turkey. Serving as a gravestone, it bears an elegiac distich (a form of Ancient Greek poetry) and a song transcribed in Ancient Greek musical notation.

=== Discovery ===
The epitaph was discovered sometime around 1883 by British engineer Edward Purser during the construction of a railroad in Aydın, Turkey. In 1883, the archaeologist William Mitchell Ramsay published a description of the epitaph in the . A rubbing was made of the inscription at some point prior to 1893, and was published in 1894 by French archaeologist Théodore Reinach. The base of the stele was in a damaged state; wishing to use it as a pedestal for his wife&#x27;s flowerpots, Purser had the bottom of the pillar sawed flat so it would stand steadily. This destroyed a line of text on the monument, which is only documented via the earlier rubbing. The pillar later passed to the private collection of De Jongh, Purser&#x27;s son-in-law, in nearby Buca.
The Dutch Consul in İzmir protected the stele during the 1922 Burning of Smyrna in the Greco-Turkish War. The consul&#x27;s son-in-law transported it, via stops in Istanbul and Stockholm, to The Hague, where it remained until 1966. Presumed lost, it was acquired by the Department of Antiquities of the National Museum of Denmark in Copenhagen and revealed in December of the following year. The stele continues to be showcased at the museum.

=== Dating ===
The find has been variously dated, but the first or second century AD is the most probable guess. One authority states that on grounds of paleography the inscription can be &quot;securely dated to the first century C.E.&quot;, while on the same basis (the use of swallow-tail serifs, the almost triangular Φ with prolongation below, ligatures between N, H, and M, and above all the peculiar form of the letter omega) another is equally certain it dates from the second century AD, and makes comparisons to dated inscriptions of 127/128 AD and 149/150 AD.

==Inscription==
===Distich===
The elegiac distich (also called couplet) was written on top of the tombstone and precedes the song. Originally in all-capitals (followed below by the polytonic lowercase and Latin transliteration), it reads:

Per Landels (2002), the distich translates in English as: 

D&#x27;Angour (2021) maintains that the translation of the letter &quot;Η&quot; (Eta) as &quot;the&quot; () results in an awkward phrasing in Greek, and thus prefers the conjunctive &quot;and&quot; (), which translates as &quot;I am an image and a stone; Seikilos sets me up here as a long-lasting marker of undying memory&quot;. In all cases, the language of the distich implies that the stone should be imagined as speaking to the reader in first person and in the present tense; a familiar structure that is commonly found in ancient epitaphs, where the stone appears to &#x27;speak&#x27; to the passer-by (see the epitaph of Simonides).

=== Epitaph ===
Below the distich follows a brief poem, also in all-capitals, with vocal notation signs above the words. The text, here excluding the musical notations (followed below by the polytonic script and Latin transliteration), reads:

In English the poem translates as: &quot;As long as you&#x27;re alive, shine, don&#x27;t be sad at all; life is short, time asks for its due&quot; per Rohland (2022). Landels (1999) provides the alternative translation: &quot;As long as you live, let the world see you, and don&#x27;t make yourself miserable; life is short, and Time demands his due&quot;.

===Dedication===

Before the last line was ground off so Mrs. Purser (the wife of the discoverer) could use the stele as a flowerpot stand, the dedication read:

The verb , meaning &quot;is alive&quot;, was a common ancient convention indicating that the dedicator had survived the dedicatee and created the monument in their memory. The last two surviving words on the tombstone itself are (with the bracketed characters denoting a partial possible reconstruction of the lacuna or of a possible name abbreviation) meaning &quot;Seikilos to Euterpe&quot;; hence, according to this reconstruction, the tombstone and the epigrams thereon were dedicated by Seikilos to a woman named Euterpe, who was possibly his wife. Alternatively, the inscription references Euterpe, the Muse of lyric poetry and music in Greek mythology, as a way to emphasize Seikilos&#x27; poetic skill. Another possible partial reconstruction could be: meaning &quot;Seikilos of Euterpes&quot;, i.e. &quot;Seikilos, son of Euterpes&quot;.

=== Word accent ===
A German scholar Otto Crusius in 1893, shortly after the publication of the inscription, was the first to observe that the music of this song as well as that of the hymns of Mesomedes tends to follow the pitch of the word accents. The publication of the two Delphic hymns in the same year confirmed this tendency. Thus in this epitaph, in most of the words, the accented syllable is higher in pitch than the syllable which follows; and the circumflex accents in , and have a falling contour within the syllable, just as described by the 1st century BC rhetorician Dionysius of Halicarnassus, while the first syllable of (a long vowel with an acute accent) has a rising melody.

One word which does not conform is the first word , where the music has a low note despite the acute accent. Another example of a low note at the beginning of a line which has been observed is in the 2nd Delphic Hymn. There are other places also where the initial syllable of a clause starts on a low note in the music.

Another apparently anomalous word is &#x27;is&#x27;, where the music has a rising melody on the first syllable. However, there exists a second pronunciation , which is used, according to Philomen Probert, &quot;when the word expresses existence or possibility (i.e. when it is translatable with expressions such as &#x27;exists&#x27;, &#x27;there is&#x27;, or &#x27;it is possible&#x27;)&quot;, which is evidently the meaning here.

==Melody==
===Transcription===
The inscription above each line of the lyrics (transcribed here in polytonic script), consists of letters and signs indicating the melody of the song:



===Scholarly views===

Although the transcription of the melody is unproblematic, there is some disagreement about the nature of the melodic material itself. There are no modulations, and the notation is clearly in the diatonic genus, but while it is described by Thomas J. Mathiesen and Jon Solomon on the one hand as being clearly in the diatonic Iastian tonos, Mathiesen also says it would &quot;fit perfectly&quot; within Ptolemy&#x27;s Phrygian tonos, since, according to Jon Solomon, the arrangement of the tones (1 ½ 1 1 1 ½ 1 [ascending]) &quot;is that of the Phrygian species&quot; according to Cleonides. The overall note series is alternatively described by and Martin Litchfield West as corresponding &quot;to a segment from the Ionian scale&quot;. R. P. Winnington-Ingram says &quot;The scale employed is the diatonic octave from &quot;e&quot; to &quot;e&quot; (in two sharps). The tonic seems to be &quot;a&quot;; the cadence is &quot;a&quot; &quot;f&quot; &quot;e&quot;. This piece is … [in] Phrygic (the D mode) with its tonic in the same relative position as that of the Doric.&quot; Yet Claude Palisca explains that the difficulty lies in the fact that &quot;the &quot;harmoniai&quot; had no finals, dominants, or internal relationships that would establish a hierarchy of tensions and points of rest, although the &quot;mese&quot; (&#x27;middle note&#x27;) may have had a gravitational function&quot;. Although the epitaph&#x27;s melody is &quot;clearly structured around a single octave, … the melody emphasizes the &quot;mese&quot; by position … rather than the &quot;mese&quot; by function&quot;. Moreover, Charles Cosgrove, building on West, shows that although the notes correspond to the Phrygian octave species, analyzing the song on the assumption that its orientation notes are the standing notes of a set of disjunct tetrachords forming the Phrygian octave species does not sufficiently illumine the melody&#x27;s tonal structure. The song&#x27;s pitch centers (notes of emphasis according to frequency, duration, and placement) are, in Greek notational nomenclature, C and Z, which correspond to G and D if the scale is mapped on the white keys of the piano (A and E in the &quot;two sharps&quot; transcription above). These two pitches are mese and nete diezeugmenon of the octave species, but the two other standing notes of that scale&#x27;s tetrachords (hypate and paramese) do not come into play in significant ways as pitch centers, whether individually or together in intervals forming fourths. The melody is dominated by fifths and thirds; and although the piece ends on hypate, that is the only occurrence of this note. This instance of hypate probably derives its suitability as a final by virtue of being &quot;the same,&quot; through octave equivalency, as nete diezeugmenon, the pitch center Z.

=== &quot;Stigmai&quot; ===
The musical notation has certain dots above it, called &quot;stigmai&quot; (), singular &quot;stigmē&quot; (), which are also found in certain other fragments of Greek music, such as the fragment from Euripides&#x27; &quot;Orestes&quot;. The meaning of these is still uncertain. According to an ancient source (known as the &quot;Anonymus Bellermanni&quot;), they represent an &#x27;arsis&#x27;, which has been taken to mean a kind of &#x27;upbeat&#x27; (&#x27;arsis&#x27; means &#x27;raising&#x27; in Greek); Armand D&#x27;Angour argues, however, that this does not rule out the possibility of a dynamic stress. Another view, by Solomon, is that the stigmai &quot;signify a rhythmical emphasis&quot;. According to Mathiesen,
A stigme appears on all the syllables of the second half of each bar as it is printed above (for example on ). If the &quot;Anonymus Bellermanni&quot; source is correct, this implies that whole of the first half of each double-foot bar or measure is the thesis, and the whole of the second half is the arsis. Stefan Hagel, however, argues that this does not preclude the possibility that within the thesis and arsis there was a further hierarchy of strong and weak notes.

=== Alternative rhythmization ===
A possible alternative way of rhythmizing the Seikilos song, in order to preserve the iambic (&#x27;rising&#x27;, di-dum) feel of the rhythm, was suggested by classicist and musician Armand D&#x27;Angour, with the barlines displaced one quaver to the right, as in the following transcription:

Stefan Hagel, discussing an example in the &quot;Anonymus Bellermanni&quot;, suggests the possibility of a similar transcription with displaced barlines of a line of music with this same rhythm. His hypothesis is based on an assumption about ancient rhythmical theory and practice, namely that &quot;the regular iambic environment precluded accented shorts altogether; in other words, the accent of the iambic foot fell on its long&quot;. 

However, Tosca Lynch argues that this assumption is contradicted by ancient rhythmical theory and practice. She notes that the song in its conventional transcription corresponds to the rhythm referred to by ancient Greek rhythmicians as an &quot;iambic dactyl&quot; ( () (using the term &quot;dactyl&quot; in the rhythmicians&#x27; sense of a foot in which the two parts are of equal length) (cf. Aristides Quintilianus 38.5–6). According to this, the whole of the first half of each bar (e.g. ) is the thesis, and the whole of the second ( ), as the &quot;stigmai&quot; imply, is the arsis. Therefore, in Lynch&#x27;s opinion the conventional transcription is to be preferred as it accurately reflects the original rhythm.

== Posterity ==

A singularity, and not the least, of musical history, is the close relationship of this melody with one of those of the Roman liturgy, the &quot;Hosanna&quot; antiphon of the Palm Sunday office, but where the long notes are resolved by groups of simple beats. Only one explanation is plausible: the Greek melody will have given rise to a citharodic variation, where this resolution of long values ​​was the rule; preserved in the repertoire of instrumentalists, with its title alone, it was used by the centonisator of the &quot;Hosanna&quot; antiphon, to whom the rapprochement of &quot;Hoson&quot; and &quot;Hosanna&quot; will have given the idea of ​​using the ancient theme. Thus, later, timbres of songs from the 14th or 15th century, whose titles had survived the words, gave rise to the polyphonists of the 16th and 17th centuries to write so many masses with bizarre titles, for those who do not know their origin. The similarity can be observed up to the word &quot;Domini&quot;; the rest is an interesting reminder of the theme.

<text>Uurainen (, also ) is a municipality of Finland.

It is part of the Central Finland region. The municipality has a population of () and covers an area of of which , or roughly 6.5%, is water. The population density is .

Neighbouring municipalities are Jyväskylä, Laukaa, Multia, Petäjävesi, Saarijärvi and Äänekoski.

The municipality is unilingually Finnish.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Uurainen&quot; is derived from the lakes Iso-Uurainen and Pieni-Uurainen. The root word for these lake names is most likely &quot;uuro&quot;, a dialectal word meaning &quot;riverbed&quot;, referring to the Takapuro river between the two lakes, as it has been a strait in the past. Uurainen is also the name of a register village in the municipality.

==Geography==
=== Lakes ===
There are all together 125 lakes in Uurainen. The biggest lakes are Kyynämöinen, Sääkspää and Iso-Uurainen.
=== Villages ===
Settlements:

Register villages:
*Kuukkajärvi
*Uurainen
*Kangashäkki
*Höytiä
*Nyrölä (mostly in Jyväskylä)

== History ==
Six possible Stone Age settlements have been found on the territory of modern Uurainen. Four of these sites are in Kuukkajärvi, one in the village of Uurainen and another one in Höytiä. Evidence for permanent Iron Age settlement has not been found.

The area of modern Uurainen was devoid of a permanent settled population in the Middle Ages. In the 15th and early 16th centuries, these lands were held as hunting grounds by Tavastians. The first settler of Uurainen was Paavo Minkkinen, who in 1548 established a farm named &quot;Salmela&quot; in the hunting grounds of &quot;Heinäjoensuu&quot;, owned by the men of the village of Laitikkala in Kulsiala (nowadays in Pälkäne). This area would later become the register village of Kuukkajärvi. Paavo Minkkinen, like almost all settlers of Uurainen, was a Savonian. The Minkkinen family likely originated from Pellosniemi near modern Mikkeli.

The first register villages to be established in the area were Kuukkajärvi and Akonjärvi, both of which were first mentioned in 1561. Akonjärvi was merged into Kuukkajärvi in 1586.

Uurainen was originally a part of the parish of Saarijärvi. It was mentioned in 1741 under the Swedish name &quot;Uhrais&quot;. The area got its own chapel in 1801 and was variously called &quot;Uurainen, Kuukkajärvi, Kuukka&quot; and &quot;Minkkilä&quot;. The area had multiple names as the vicarage (&quot;pappila&quot;) was located in the register village of Uurainen while the church was located in the village of Kuukkajärvi on the lands of the Minkkilä farm.

Uurainen became a separate parish in 1868, though the separation effectively happened in 1887. The northern part of Nyrölä, which at that time included Höytiä, was transferred from the Jyväskylä parish to Uurainen in 1868.

<text>Uusikaupunki (; , ) is a town and municipality of Finland. It is located in the Southwest Finland region, northwest of Turku and south of Pori. The municipality has a population of () and covers an area of of which is inland water. The population density is .

The municipality is unilingually Finnish. Both its Finnish and Swedish names translate literally to &quot;new town&quot;. The original name of the main village that was incorporated into Uusikaupunki was Kalainen (roughly translated from Finnish as &quot;rich in fish&quot;). The surrounding region, and especially the neighboring town of Kalanti, which merged with Uusikaupunki in 1993, was already a lively marketplace for wooden objects and salt in the early Middle Ages. Uusikaupunki was founded to legalize this trade.

==Geography==
Uusikaupunki is located in the Vakka-Suomi sub-region on the shores of the Gulf of Bothnia. The (&quot;Sirppujoki&quot;) flows through the town and flows into the reservoir of Uusikaupunki in the northern part of the town. The freshwater pool was built in 1965 when the bays of Velhovesi and Ruotsinvesi were dammed from the sea. The area of the basin is about 40 km², and the town and part of Vakka-Suomi get their domestic water from it. The acidity of the freshwater basin has caused some fish deaths as well as an overgrowth of aquatic plants.

In 2011, the Bothnian Sea National Park was established in the outer archipelago of Uusikaupunki. The area, named Finland&#x27;s largest marine national park, begins in the south of the Kustavi archipelago and ends in the north in the Merikarvia archipelago.

===Cityscape===

The center of Uusikaupunki is built according to the so-called &quot;grid plan layout&quot; and is one of the best-preserved Empire-style wooden house blocks in the country. Today, there are a total of 40 blocks left. Because of this, the area is characterized by wide streets and large blocks with the narrow alleys. In a town plan drawn up in 1649, there were 27 blocks in the town center that required residential buildings to be built. The town was built of densely red-soil houses, and the estates were not pleasantly considered deserted. The town also expanded around the base of the bay, where a suburban settlement was built. Green areas were not established in the town until the 1850s, when a new town plan was planned for the town.

According to the Finnish Heritage Agency, the town&#x27;s most significant public buildings are the Seikow&#x27;s school building and the Uusikaupunki&#x27;s library building. Seikow&#x27;s Neo-Renaissance building was one of the oldest school buildings in Finland. The town library is thought to be one of the oldest functioning library buildings in the country; it was founded in 1861. The first glass factory of Finland, which was located in Uusikaupunki, was destroyed in a fire in 1685. In the center of Uusikaupunki is the &quot;Bonk Centre&quot; museum, which houses a collection of products from the fictional Bonk Business Company. In addition, the town has a cultural history museum. A notable building in the town center is also &quot;Wallila&quot;, designed by F. A. Sjöström and located on a hill near the sea. It is now used as venue for Crusell Week music festival, which is named after composer-clarinetist Bernhard Crusell, who was born in Uusikaupunki.

==History==
The town of Uusikaupunki was founded as a town with the rights of commerce on April 19, 1617 by decree by Gustav II Adolf. In 1721, the Peace of Nystad was signed in Uusikaupunki, ending the Great Northern War between Sweden and Russia, but as the Crimean War broke out in 1853, Uusikaupunki was attacked by French Navy and British Navy in 1855 during the Åland War. Up to the 19th century, Uusikaupunki was an important port for commerce and fishing, and up to the latter half of the 20th century, the Port of Uusikaupunki retained an important ship-building industry.

==Economy==
Uusikaupunki is the home of Valmet Automotive, a contract automobile mechanical production company, producing cars and vehicles for brands such as Mercedes-Benz. It was founded in 1968 as Saab-Valmet for manufacturing Saab cars. As of June 2017, Valmet is assembling Mercedes-Benz A-Class and Mercedes-Benz GLC-Class cars. Furthermore, it produces the first commercially available solar-electric vehicle - the Lightyear 0 - as of November 2022. Today, Valmet is one of the largest and most significant employers in Uusikaupunki.

<doc id="784889" wikidata="Q5398059" url="?curid=784889" title="Indian reservation">
<text>An American Indian reservation is an area of land held and governed by a U.S. federal government-recognized Native American tribal nation, whose government is autonomous, subject to regulations passed by the United States Congress and administered by the United States Bureau of Indian Affairs, and not to the U.S. state government in which it is located. Some of the country&#x27;s 574 federally recognized tribes govern more than one of the 326 Indian reservations in the United States, while some share reservations, and others have no reservation at all. Historical piecemeal land allocations under the Dawes Act facilitated sales to non–Native Americans, resulting in some reservations becoming severely fragmented, with pieces of tribal and privately held land being treated as separate enclaves. This intersection of private and public real estate creates significant administrative, political, and legal difficulties.

The total area of all reservations is , approximately 2.3% of the total area of the United States and about the size of the state of Idaho. While most reservations are small compared to the average U.S. state, twelve Indian reservations are larger than the state of Rhode Island. The largest reservation, the Navajo Nation Reservation, is similar in size to the state of West Virginia. Reservations are unevenly distributed throughout the country, the majority being situated west of the Mississippi River and occupying lands that were first reserved by treaty (Indian Land Grants) from the public domain.

Because recognized Native American nations possess tribal sovereignty, albeit of a limited degree, laws within tribal lands may vary from those of the surrounding and adjacent states. For example, these laws can permit casinos on reservations located within states which do not allow gambling, thus attracting tourism. The tribal council generally has jurisdiction over the reservation, not the U.S. state it is located in, but is subject to federal law. Court jurisdiction in Indian country is shared between tribes and the federal government, depending on the tribal affiliation of the parties involved and the specific crime or civil matter. Different reservations have different systems of government, which may or may not replicate the forms of government found outside the reservation. Most Native American reservations were established by the federal government but a small number, mainly in the East, owe their origin to state recognition.

The term &quot;reservation&quot; is a legal designation. It comes from the conception of the Native American nations as independent sovereigns at the time the U.S. Constitution was ratified. Thus, early peace treaties (often signed under conditions of duress or fraud), in which Native American nations surrendered large portions of their land to the United States, designated parcels which the nations, as sovereigns, &quot;reserved&quot; to themselves, and those parcels came to be called &quot;reservations&quot;. The term remained in use after the federal government began to forcibly relocate nations to parcels of land to which they often had no historical or cultural connection. Compared to other population centers in the U.S., reservations are disproportionately located on or near toxic sites hazardous to the health of those living or working in close proximity, including nuclear testing grounds and contaminated mines.

The majority of American Indians and Alaska Natives live outside the reservations, mainly in the larger western cities such as Phoenix and Los Angeles. In 2012, there were more than 2.5 million Native Americans, with 1 million living on reservations.

==History==
===Colonial and early U.S. history===
From the beginning of the European colonization of the Americas, Europeans often removed Indigenous peoples from their homelands. The means varied, including treaties made under considerable duress, forceful ejection, violence, and in a few cases voluntary moves based on mutual agreement. The removal caused many problems such as tribes losing the means of livelihood by being restricted to a defined area, poor quality of land for agriculture, and hostility between tribes.

The first reservation was established by Easton Treaty with the colonial governments of New Jersey and Pennsylvania on August 29, 1758. Located in southern New Jersey, it was called Brotherton Indian Reservation and also &quot;Edgepillock&quot; or &quot;Edgepelick&quot;. The area was . Today it is called Indian Mills in Shamong Township.

In 1764 the British government&#x27;s Board of Trade proposed the &quot;Plan for the Future Management of Indian Affairs&quot;. Although never adopted formally, the plan established the British government&#x27;s expectation that land would only be bought by colonial governments, not individuals, and that land would only be purchased at public meetings. Additionally, this plan dictated that the Indians would be properly consulted when ascertaining and defining the boundaries of colonial settlement.

The private contracts that once characterized the sale of Indian land to various individuals and groups—from farmers to towns—were replaced by treaties between sovereigns. This protocol was adopted by the United States Government after the American Revolution.

On March 11, 1824, U.S. Vice President John C. Calhoun founded the Office of Indian Affairs (now the Bureau of Indian Affairs) as a division of the United States Department of War (now the United States Department of Defense), to solve the land problem with 38 treaties with American Indian tribes.

=== Letters from the presidents of the United States on Indian reservations (1825–1837)===
Indian Treaties, and Laws and Regulations Relating to Indian Affairs (1825) was a document signed by President Andrew Jackson in which he states that &quot;we have placed the land reserves in a better state for the benefit of society&quot; with approval of Indigenous reservations before 1850. The letter is signed by Isaac Shelby and Jackson. It discusses several regulations regarding the Native Americans and the approval of Indigenous segregation and the reservation system.

President Martin Van Buren negotiated a treaty with the Saginaw Chippewas in 1837 to build a lighthouse. The President of the United States of America was directly involved in the creation of new treaties regarding Indian Reservations before 1850. Van Buren stated that indigenous reservations are &quot;all their reserves of land in the state of Michigan, on the principle of said reserves being sold at the public land offices for their benefit and the actual proceeds being paid to them.&quot; The agreement dictated that the indigenous tribe sell their land to build a lighthouse.

A treaty signed by John Forsyth, the Secretary of State on behalf of Van Buren, also dictates where indigenous peoples must live in terms of the reservation system in America between the Oneida People in 1838. This treaty allows the indigenous peoples five years on a specific reserve &quot;the west shores of Saganaw bay&quot;. The creation of reservations for indigenous people of America could be as little as a five-year approval before 1850. Article two of the treaty claims &quot;the reserves on the river Angrais and at Rifle river, of which said Indians are to have the usufruct and occupancy for five years.&quot; Indigenous people had restraints pushed on them by the five-year allowance.

=== Early land sales in Virginia (1705–1713) ===
Scholarly author Buck Woodard used executive papers from Governor William H. Cabell in his article, &quot;Indian Land sales and allotment in Antebellum Virginia&quot; to discuss Indigenous reservations in America before 1705, specifically in Virginia. He claims &quot;the colonial government again recognized the Nottoway&#x27;s land rights by treaty in 1713, at the conclusion of the Tuscaro War.&quot; The indigenous peoples of America had land treaty agreements as early as 1713.

=== The beginning of the Indigenous Reservation System in America (1763–1834) ===

The American Indigenous Reservation system started with &quot;the Royal Proclamation of 1763, where Great Britain set aside an enormous resource for Indians in the territory of the present United States.&quot; The United States put forward another act when &quot;Congress passed the Indian Removal Act in 1830&quot;. A third act pushed through was &quot;the federal government relocated &quot;portions of [the] &#x27;Five Civilized Tribes&#x27; from the southeastern states in the Non-Intercourse Act of 1834.&quot; All three of these laws set into motion the Indigenous Reservation system in the United States of America, resulting in the forceful removal of Indigenous peoples into specific land Reservations.

=== Treaty between America and the Menominee Nation (1831) ===
Scholarly author James Oberly discusses &quot;The Treaty of 1831 between the Menominee Nation and the United States&quot; in his article, &quot;Decision on Duck Creek: Two Green Bay Reservations and Their Boundaries, 1816–1996&quot;, showing yet another treaty regarding Indigenous Reservations before 1850. There is a conflict between the Menomee Nation and the State of Wisconsin and &quot;the 1831 Menomee Treaty … ran the boundary between the lands of the Oneida, known in the Treaty as the &quot;New York Indians&quot;. This Treaty from 1831 is the cause of conflicts and is disputed because the land was good hunting grounds.

=== 1834 Trade and Intercourse Act (1834) ===

The Trade and Intercourse Act of 1834 says &quot;In the 1834 Indian Trade and Intercourse Act, the United States defined the boundaries of Indian County.&quot; Also, &quot;For Unrau, Indigenous Country is less on Indigenous homeland and more a place where the U.S. removed Indians from east of the Mississippi River and applied unique laws.&quot; The United States of America applied laws on Indigenous Reservations depending on where they were located like the Mississippi River. This act came too, because &quot;the federal government began to compress Indigenous lands because it needed to send troops to Texas during the Mexican-American War and protect American immigration traveling to Oregon and California.&quot; The Federal Government of America had their own needs and desires for Indigenous Land Reservations. He says, &quot;the reconnaissance of explorers and other American officials understood that Indigenous Country possessed good land, bountiful game, and potential mineral resources.&quot; The American Government claimed Indigenous land for their own benefits with these creations of Indigenous Land Reservations .

=== Indigenous Reservation System in Texas (1845) ===
States such as Texas had their own policy when it came to Indian Reservations in America before 1850. Scholarly author George D. Harmon discusses Texas&#x27; own reservation system which &quot;Prior to 1845, Texas had inaugurated and pursued her own Indian Policy of the U.S.&quot; Texas was one of the States before 1850 that chose to create their own reservation system as seen in Harmon&#x27;s article, &quot;The United States Indian Policy in Texas, 1845–1860.&quot; The State of &quot;Texas had given only a few hundred acres of land in 1840, for the purpose of colonization&quot;. However, &quot;In March 1847, … [a] special agent [was sent] to Texas to manage the Indian affairs in the State until Congress should take some definite and final action.&quot; The United States of America allowed its states to make up their own treaties such as this one in Texas for the purpose of colonization.

=== Rise of Indian removal policy (1830–1868) ===

The passage of the Indian Removal Act of 1830 marked the systematization of a U.S. federal government policy of moving Native populations away from European-populated areas, whether forcibly or voluntarily.

One example was the Five Civilized Tribes, who were removed from their historical homelands in the Southeastern United States and moved to Indian Territory, in a forced mass migration that came to be known as the Trail of Tears. Some of the lands these tribes were given to inhabit following the removals eventually became Indian reservations.

In 1851, the United States Congress passed the Indian Appropriations Act which authorized the creation of Indian reservations in Indian Territory (which became Oklahoma). Relations between white settlers and Natives had grown increasingly worse as the settlers encroached on territory and natural resources in the West.

===Forced assimilation (1868–1887)===
In 1868, President Ulysses S. Grant pursued a &quot;Peace Policy&quot; as an attempt to avoid violence. The policy included a reorganization of the Indian Service, with the goal of relocating various tribes from their ancestral homes to parcels of lands established specifically for their inhabitation. The policy called for the replacement of government officials by religious men, nominated by churches, to oversee the Indian agencies on reservations in order to teach Christianity to the Native American tribes. The Quakers were especially active in this policy on reservations.

The policy was controversial from the start. Reservations were generally established by executive order. In many cases, white settlers objected to the size of land parcels, which were subsequently reduced. A report submitted to Congress in 1868 found widespread corruption among the federal Native American agencies and generally poor conditions among the relocated tribes.

Many tribes ignored the relocation orders at first and were forced onto their limited land parcels. Enforcement of the policy required the United States Army to restrict the movements of various tribes. The pursuit of tribes in order to force them back onto reservations led to a number of wars with Native Americans which included some massacres. The most well-known conflict was the Sioux War on the northern Great Plains, between 1876 and 1881, which included the Battle of Little Bighorn. Other famous wars in this regard included the Nez Perce War and the Modoc War, which marked the last conflict officially declared a war.

By the late 1870s, the policy established by President Grant was regarded as a failure, primarily because it had resulted in some of the bloodiest wars between Native Americans and the United States. By 1877, President Rutherford B. Hayes began phasing out the policy, and by 1882 all religious organizations had relinquished their authority to the federal Indian agency.

===Individualized reservations (1887–1934)===
In 1887, Congress undertook a significant change in reservation policy by the passage of the Dawes Act, or General Allotment (Severalty) Act. The act ended the general policy of granting land parcels to tribes as-a-whole by granting small parcels of land to individual tribe members. In some cases, for example, the Umatilla Indian Reservation, after the individual parcels were granted out of reservation land, the reservation area was reduced by giving the &quot;excess land&quot; to white settlers. The individual allotment policy continued until 1934 when it was terminated by the Indian Reorganization Act.

===Indian New Deal (1934–present)===
The Indian Reorganization Act of 1934, also known as the &quot;Howard-Wheeler Act&quot;, was sometimes called the &quot;Indian New Deal&quot; and was initiated by John Collier. It laid out new rights for Native Americans, reversed some of the earlier privatization of their common holdings, and encouraged tribal sovereignty and land management by tribes. The act slowed the assignment of tribal lands to individual members and reduced the assignment of &quot;extra&quot; holdings to nonmembers.

For the following 20 years, the U.S. government invested in infrastructure, health care, and education on the reservations. Likewise, over two million acres (8,000 km2) of land were returned to various tribes. Within a decade of Collier&#x27;s retirement the government&#x27;s position began to swing in the opposite direction. The new Indian Commissioners Myers and Emmons introduced the idea of the &quot;withdrawal program&quot; or &quot;termination&quot;, which sought to end the government&#x27;s responsibility and involvement with Indians and to force their assimilation.

The Indians would lose their lands but were to be compensated, although many were not. Even though discontent and social rejection killed the idea before it was fully implemented, five tribes were terminated—the Coushatta, Ute, Paiute, Menominee and Klamath—and 114 groups in California lost their federal recognition as tribes. Many individuals were also relocated to cities, but one-third returned to their tribal reservations in the decades that followed.

== Governance ==

Federally recognized Native American tribes possess limited tribal sovereignty and are able to exercise the right of self-governance, including but not limited to the ability to pass laws, regulate power and energy, create treaties, and hold tribal court hearings. Laws on tribal lands may vary from those of the surrounding area. The laws passed can, for example, permit legal casinos on reservations. The tribal council, not the local government or the United States federal government, often has jurisdiction over reservations. Different reservations have different systems of government, which may or may not replicate the forms of government found outside the reservation.

===Land tenure and federal Indian law===

With the establishment of reservations, tribal territories diminished to a fraction of their original areas; customary Native American practices of land tenure were sustained only for a time, and not in every instance. Instead, the federal government established regulations that subordinated tribes to the authority, first, of the military, and then of the Bureau (Office) of Indian Affairs. Under federal law, the government patented reservations to tribes, which became legal entities that at later times have operated in a corporate manner. Tribal tenure identifies jurisdiction over land-use planning and zoning, negotiating (with the close participation of the Bureau of Indian Affairs) leases for timber harvesting and mining.

Tribes generally have authority over other forms of economic development such as ranching, agriculture, tourism, and casinos. Tribes hire both members, other Indians and non-Indians in varying capacities; they may run tribal stores, gas stations, and develop museums (e.g., there is a gas station and general store at Fort Hall Indian Reservation, Idaho, and a museum at Foxwoods, on the Mashantucket Pequot Indian Reservation in Connecticut).

Tribal citizens may utilize several resources held in tribal tenures such as grazing range and some cultivable lands. They may also construct homes on tribally held lands. As such, members are tenants-in-common, which may be likened to communal tenure. Even if some of this pattern emanates from pre-reservation tribal customs, generally the tribe has the authority to modify tenant-in-common practices.
With the General Allotment Act (Dawes), 1887, the government sought to individualize tribal lands by authorizing allotments held in individual tenure. Generally, the allocation process led to grouping family holdings and, in some cases, this sustained pre-reservation clan or other patterns. There had been a few allotment programs ahead of the Dawes Act. However, the vast fragmentation of reservations occurred from the enactment of this act up to 1934, when the Indian Reorganization Act was passed. However, Congress authorized some allotment programs in the ensuing years, such as on the Palm Springs/Agua Caliente Indian Reservation in California.

Allotment set in motion a number of circumstances:
* individuals could sell (alienate) the allotment – under the Dawes Act, it was not to happen until after twenty-five years.
* individual allottees who would die intestate would encumber the land under prevailing state devisement laws, leading to complex patterns of heirship. Congress has attempted to mollify the impact of heirship by granting tribes the capacity to acquire fragmented allotments owing to heirship by financial grants. Tribes may also include such parcels in long-range land use planning.
* With alienation to non-Indians, their increased presence on numerous reservations has changed the demography of Indian Country. One of many implications of this fact is that tribes can not always effectively embrace the total management of a reservation, for non-Indian owners and users of allotted lands contend that tribes have no authority over lands that fall within the tax and law-and-order jurisdiction of local government.

The demographic factor, coupled with landownership data, led, for example, to litigation between the Devils Lake Sioux and the State of North Dakota, where non-Indians owned more acreage than tribal members even though more Native Americans resided on the reservation than non-Indians. The court decision turned, in part, on the perception of &quot;Indian character&quot;, contending that the tribe did not have jurisdiction over the alienated allotments. In a number of instances—e.g., the Yakama Indian Reservation—tribes have identified &quot;open&quot; and &quot;closed&quot; areas within reservations. One finds the majority of non-Indian landownership and residence in the open areas and, contrariwise, closed areas represent exclusive tribal residence and related conditions.
Indian country today consists of tripartite government—i. e., federal, state and/or local, and tribal. Where state and local governments may exert some, but limited, law-and-order authority, tribal sovereignty is diminished. This situation prevails in connection with Indian gaming, because federal legislation makes the state a party to any contractual or statutory agreement.

Finally, occupancy on reservations can be by virtue of tribal or individual tenure. There are many churches on reservations; most would occupy tribal land by consent of the federal government or the tribe. Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) agency offices, hospitals, schools, and other facilities usually occupy residual federal parcels within reservations. Many reservations include one or more sections (about 640 acres) of land for schools, but such land typically remains part of the reservation (e.g., Enabling Act of 1910 at Section 20). As a general practice, such land may sit idle or be used for cattle grazing by tribal ranchers.

===Gaming===

In 1979, the Seminole tribe in Florida opened a high-stakes bingo operation on its reservation in Florida. The state attempted to close the operation down but was stopped in the courts. In the 1980s, the case of &quot;California v. Cabazon Band of Mission Indians&quot; established the right of reservations to operate other forms of gambling operations. In 1988, Congress passed the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, which recognized the right of Native American tribes to establish gambling and gaming facilities on their reservations as long as the states in which they are located have some form of legalized gambling.

Today, many Native American casinos are used as tourist attractions, including as the basis for hotel and conference facilities, to draw visitors and revenue to reservations. Successful gaming operations on some reservations have greatly increased the economic wealth of some tribes, enabling their investment to improve infrastructure, education, and health for their people.

===Law enforcement and crime===

Serious crime on Indian reservations has historically been required (by the 1885 Major Crimes Act, 18 U.S.C. §§1153, 3242, and court decisions) to be investigated by the federal government, usually the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and prosecuted by United States Attorneys of the United States federal judicial district in which the reservation lies.

Tribal courts were limited to sentences of one year or less, until on July 29, 2010, the Tribal Law and Order Act was enacted which in some measure reforms the system permitting tribal courts to impose sentences of up to three years provided proceedings are recorded and additional rights are extended to defendants. The Justice Department on January 11, 2010, initiated the Indian Country Law Enforcement Initiative which recognizes problems with law enforcement on Indian reservations and assigns top priority to solving existing problems.

The Department of Justice recognizes the unique legal relationship that the United States has with federally recognized tribes. As one aspect of this relationship, in much of Indian Country, the Justice Department alone has the authority to seek a conviction that carries an appropriate potential sentence when a serious crime has been committed. Our role as the primary prosecutor of serious crimes makes our responsibility to citizens in Indian Country unique and mandatory. Accordingly, public safety in tribal communities is a top priority for the Department of Justice.

Emphasis was placed on improving prosecution of crimes involving domestic violence and sexual assault.

Passed in 1953, Public Law 280 (PL 280) gave jurisdiction over criminal offenses involving Indians in Indian Country to certain States and allowed other States to assume jurisdiction. Subsequent legislation allowed States to retrocede jurisdiction, which has occurred in some areas. Some PL 280 reservations have experienced jurisdictional confusion, tribal discontent, and litigation, compounded by the lack of data on crime rates and law enforcement response.

As of 2012, a high incidence of rape continued to impact Native American women.

====Violence and substance abuse====
A survey of death certificates over a four-year period showed that deaths among Indians due to alcohol are about four times as common as in the general U.S. population and are often due to traffic collisions and liver disease with homicide, suicide, and falls also contributing. Deaths due to alcohol among American Indians are more common in men and among Northern Plains Indians. Alaska Natives showed the least incidence of death. Under federal law, alcohol sales are prohibited on Indian reservations unless the tribal councils allow it.

Gang violence has become a major social problem. A December 13, 2009, article in &quot;The New York Times&quot; about growing gang violence on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation estimated that there were 39 gangs with 5,000 members on that reservation alone. As opposed to traditional &quot;Most Wanted&quot; lists, Native Americans are often placed on regional Crime Stoppers lists offering rewards for their whereabouts.

==Disputes over land sovereignty==

When the Europeans encountered the New World, the American colonial government determined a precedent of establishing the land sovereignty of North America through treaties between countries. This precedent was upheld by the United States government. As a result, most Native American land was purchased by the United States government, a portion of which was designated to remain under Native sovereignty. The United States government and Native Peoples do not always agree on how land should be governed, which has resulted in a series of disputes over sovereignty.

=== Black Hills land dispute ===

The Federal Government and The Lakota Sioux tribe members have been involved in sorting out a legal claim for the Black Hills since signing the 1868 Fort Laramie Treaty, which created what is known today as the Great Sioux Nation covering the Black Hills and nearly half of western South Dakota. This treaty was acknowledged and respected until 1874 when General George Custer discovered gold, sending a wave of settlers into the area and leading to the realization of the value of the land from United States President Grant. President Grant used tactical military force to remove the Sioux from the land and assisted in the development of the Congressional appropriations bill for Indian Services in 1876, a &quot;starve or sell&quot; treaty signed by only 10% of the 75% tribal men required based on specifications from the Fort Laramie Treaty that relinquished the Sioux&#x27;s rights to the Black Hills. Following this treaty, the Agreement of 1877 was passed by Congress to remove the Sioux from the Black Hills, stating that the land was purchased from the Sioux despite the insufficient number of signatures, the lack of transaction records, and the tribe&#x27;s claim that the land was never for sale.

The Black Hills are sacred to the Sioux as a place central to their spirituality and identity, and contest of ownership of the land has been pressured in the courts by the Sioux Nation since they were allowed legal avenue in 1920. Beginning in 1923, the Sioux made a legal claim that their relinquishment from the Black Hills was illegal under the Fifth Amendment, and no amount of money can make up for the loss of their sacred land. This claim went all the way up to the Supreme Court &quot;United States v. Sioux Nation of Indians&quot; case in 1979 after being revived by Congress, and the Sioux were awarded over $100 million as they ruled that the seizure of the Black Hills was in fact illegal. The Sioux have continually rejected the money, and since then the award has been accruing interest in trust accounts and amounts to about $1 billion in 2015.

During President Barack Obama&#x27;s campaign, he made indications that the case of the Black Hills was going to be solved with innovative solutions and consultation, but this was questioned when White House Counsel Leonard Garment sent a note to The Ogala people saying, &quot;The days of treaty-making with the American Indians ended in 1871; ...only Congress can rescind or change in any way statutes enacted since 1871.&quot; The He Sapa Reparations Alliance was established after Obama&#x27;s inauguration to educate the Sioux people and propose a bill to Congress that would allocate 1.3 million acres of federal land within the Black Hills to the tribe. To this day, the dispute of the Black Hills is ongoing with the trust estimated to be worth nearly $1.3 billion and sources believe principles of restorative justice may be the best solution to addressing this century-old dispute.

=== Iroquois land claims in Upstate New York ===

While the 1783 Treaty of Paris, which ended the American Revolution, addressed land sovereignty disputes between the British Crown and the colonies, it neglected to settle hostilities between Indigenous people—specifically those who fought on the side of the British, as four of the members of the Haudenosaunee did—and colonists. In October 1784 the newly formed United States government facilitated negotiations with representatives from the Six Nations in Fort Stanwix, New York. The treaty produced in 1784 resulted in Indians giving up their territory within the Ohio River Valley and the U.S. guaranteeing the Haudenosaunee six million acres—about half of what is present-day New York—as permanent homelands.

Unenthusiastic about the treaty&#x27;s conditions, the state of New York secured a series of 26 &quot;leases&quot;, many of them lasting 999 years on all Native territories within its boundaries. Led to believe that they had already lost their land to the New York Genesee Company, the Haudenosaunee agreed to land leasing which was presented by New York Governor George Clinton as a means by which the Indigenous nations could maintain sovereignty over their land. On August 28, 1788, the Oneida people leased five million acres to the state in exchange for $2,000 in cash, $2,000 in clothing, $1,000 in provisions and $600 annual rent. The other two tribes followed with similar arrangements.

The Holland Land Company gained control over all but ten acres of the Native land leased to the state on 15 September 1797. These 397 square miles were subsequently parceled out and subleased to whites, allegedly ending the Native title to land. Despite Iroquois protests, federal authorities did virtually nothing to correct the injustice. Certain of losing all of their lands, in 1831 most of the Oneidas asked that what was left of their holdings be exchanged for 500,000 acres purchased from the Menominees in Wisconsin. President Andrew Jackson, committed to Indian Removal west of the Mississippi, agreed.

The Treaty of Buffalo Creek signed on 15 January 1838, directly ceded 102,069 acres of Seneca land to the Ogden company for $202,000, a sum that was divided evenly between the government—to hold in trust for Indians—and non-Indian individuals who wanted to buy and improve the plots. All that was left of the Cayuga, Oneida, Onondaga and Tuscarora holding was extinguished at a total cost of $400,000 to Ogden.

After Indian complaints, a second Treaty of Buffalo was written in 1842 in attempts to mediate tension. Under this treaty the Haudenosaunee were given the right to reside in New York and small areas of reservations were restored by the U.S. government.

These agreements were largely ineffective in protecting Native American land. By 1889 eighty percent of all Iroquois reservation land in New York was leased by non-Haudenosaunees.

=== Navajo–Hopi land dispute ===

The modern-day Navajo and Hopi Indian Reservations are located in Northern Arizona, near the Four Corners area. The Hopi reservation is within Arizona and lies surrounded by the greater Navajo reservation which spans and extends slightly into the states of New Mexico and Utah. The Hopi, also known as the Pueblo people, made many spiritually motivated migrations throughout the Southwest before settling in present-day Northern Arizona. The Navajo people also migrated throughout western North America following spiritual commands before settling near the Grand Canyon area. The two tribes peacefully coexisted and even traded and exchanged ideas with each other. Their way of life was threatened when the &quot;New people&quot;, what the Navajo called white settlers, began conquering native tribes across the continent and claiming their land, as a result of Andrew Jackson&#x27;s Indian Removal Act. War ensued between the Navajo people, who call themselves the Diné, and new Americans. The result was the Long Walk in the early 1860s in which the entire tribe was forced to walk roughly from Fort Canby (present-day Window Rock, Arizona) to Bosque Redondo in New Mexico. This march is similar to the well-known Cherokee Trail of Tears and like it, many of the tribe did not survive the trek. The roughly 11,000 tribe members were imprisoned here in what the United States government deemed an experimental Indian reservation that failed because it became too expensive, there were too many people to feed, and they were continuously raided by other Native tribes. Consequently, in 1868, the Navajo were allowed to return to their homeland after signing the Treaty of Bosque Redondo. The treaty officially established the &quot;Navajo Indian Reservation&quot; in Northern Arizona. The term reservation is one that creates territorialities or claims on places. This treaty gave them the right to the land and semi-autonomous governance of it. The Hopi reservation, on the other hand, was created through an executive order by President Arthur in 1882.

A few years after the two reservations were established, the Dawes Allotment Act was passed under which communal tribal land was divvied up and allocated to each household in an attempt to enforce European-American farming styles where each family owns and works their own plot of land. This was a further act of enclosure by the U.S. government. Each family received or less and the remaining land was deemed &quot;surplus&quot; because it was more than the tribes needed. This &quot;surplus&quot; land was then made available for purchase by American citizens.

The land designated to the Navajo and Hopi reservation was originally considered barren and unproductive by white settlers until 1921 when prospectors scoured the land for oil. The mining companies pressured the U.S. government to set up Native American councils on the reservations so that they could agree to contracts, specifically leases, in the name of the tribe.

During World War II, uranium was mined on the Diné and Hopi reservations. The dangers of radiation exposure were not adequately explained to the Native people, who made up almost all the workforce of these mines, and lived in their immediate adjacency. As a result, some residents who lived near the uranium projects used the quarried rock from the mines to build their houses, these materials were radioactive and had detrimental health effects on the residents, including increased rates of kidney failure and cancer. During extraction some Native children would play in large water pools which were heavily contaminated with uranium created by mining activities. The companies also failed to properly dispose of the radioactive waste which did and will continue to pollute the environment, including the Natives&#x27; water sources. Many years later, these same men who worked the mines died from lung cancer, and their families received no form of financial compensation.

In 1979, the Church Rock uranium mill spill was the largest release of radioactive waste in U.S. history. The spill contaminated the Puerco River with 1,000 tons of solid radioactive waste and 93 million gallons of acidic, radioactive tailings solution which flowed downstream into the Navajo Nation. The Navajos used the water from this river for irrigation and their livestock but were not immediately informed about the contamination and its danger.

After the war ended, the American population boomed and energy demands soared. The utility companies needed a new source of power so they began the construction of coal-fired power plants. They placed these power plants in the four corners region. In the 1960s, John Boyden, an attorney working for both Peabody Coal and the Hopi tribe, the nation&#x27;s largest coal producer, managed to gain rights to the Hopi land, including Black Mesa, a sacred location to both tribes which lay partially within the Joint Use Area of both tribes.

This case is an example of environmental racism and injustice, per the principles established by the Participants of the First National People of Color Environmental Leadership Summit, because the Navajo and Hopi people, which are communities of color, low income, and political alienation, were disproportionately affected by the proximity and the resulting pollution of these power plants which disregard their right to clean air, their land was degraded, and because the related public policies are not based on mutual respect of all people.

The mining companies, however, wanted more land but the joint ownership of the land made negotiations difficult. At the same time, Hopi and Navajo tribes were squabbling over land rights while Navajo livestock continuously grazed on Hopi land. Boyden took advantage of this situation, presenting it to the House Subcommittee on Indian Affairs claiming that if the government did not step in and do something, a bloody war would ensue between the tribes. Congressmen agreed to pass the Navajo-Hopi Land Settlement Act of 1974 which forced any Hopi and Navajo people living on the other&#x27;s land to relocate. This affected 6,000 Navajo people and ultimately benefitted coal companies the most who could now more easily access the disputed land. Instead of using military violence to deal with those who refused to move, the government passed what became known as the Bennett Freeze to encourage the people to leave. The Bennett Freeze banned of Navajo land from any type of development, including paving roadways and even roof repair. This was meant to be a temporary incentive to push tribe negotiations but lasted over forty years until 2009 when President Obama lifted the moratorium. The legacy of the Bennett Freeze looms over the region as seen by the nearly third-world conditions on the reservation – seventy-five percent of people do not have access to electricity and housing situations are poor.

===Eastern Oklahoma===
Much of what is now Oklahoma was considered Indian Territory from the 1830s. The tribes in the area attempted to join the union as the Native-led State of Sequoyah in 1905 as a means of retaining control of their lands, but this was unsuccessful and the lands were merged into Oklahoma with the Enabling Act of 1906. This act had been taken to disestablish the reservation in order for the foundation of the state to proceed. In July 2020, the Supreme Court ruled in &quot;McGirt v. Oklahoma&quot; that the area, about half of the modern state, never lost its status as a Native reservation. This includes the city of Tulsa. The area includes lands of the Chickasaw, Choctaw, Cherokee, Muscogee, and Seminole. The ruling is based on an 1832 treaty, which the court ruled was still in force, adding that &quot;Because Congress has not said otherwise, we hold the government to its word.&quot;

In 2021, the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals upheld a lower court ruling that the Quapaw Nation&#x27;s reservation in Ottawa County in northeastern Oklahoma was never disestablished. In 2024, the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals ruled that the Wyandotte Nation&#x27;s reservation was also never disestablished. Court rulings also confirmed the existence of the reservations of the Miami Tribe of Oklahoma, Peoria Tribe of Indians of Oklahoma, and Ottawa Tribe of Oklahoma.

==Life and culture==


Many Native Americans who live on reservations interact with the federal government through two agencies: the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Indian Health Service.

The standard of living on some reservations is comparable to that in the developing world, with problems of infant mortality, low life expectancy, poor nutrition, poverty, and alcohol and drug abuse. The two poorest counties in the United States are Buffalo County, South Dakota, home of the Crow Creek Indian Reservation, and Oglala Lakota County, South Dakota, home of the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, according to data compiled by the 2000 census. This disparity in living standards can partly be explained by centuries-long instances of settler colonialism which have systematically harmed Indigenous peoples&#x27; relations with land, and have attempted to erase their cultural ways of life. Potawatomi scholar Kyle Powys Whyte has stated,&quot;While Indigenous peoples, as any society, have long histories of adapting to change, colonialism caused changes at such a rapid pace that many Indigenous peoples became vulnerable to harms, from health problems related to new diets to erosion of their cultures to the destruction of Indigenous diplomacy, to which they were not as susceptible prior to colonization.&quot;This has resulted in an ever widening disparity between Native peoples and the rest of the United States.

It is commonly believed that environmentalism and a connectedness to nature are ingrained in the Native American culture. However, this is a generalization. In recent years, cultural historians have set out to reconstruct and complicate this notion as what they claim to be a culturally inaccurate romanticism. Others recognize the differences between the attitudes and perspectives that emerge from a comparison of Western European philosophy and Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) of Indigenous peoples, especially when considering natural resource conflicts and management strategies involving multiple parties.

== Environmental issues ==
The lands on which reservations are located are disproportionately low in natural resources and quality soil conducive to fostering economic prosperity. Starting in the mid-20th century reservations came to be increasingly located in areas contaminated with toxic runoff from current or historical industrial activities conducted by outside entities including private corporations as well as the federal government. According to anthropologists Merrill Singer and Derrick Hodge: &quot;The toxic and poor land quality of Native American lands is neither a historical accident nor the result of any cultural deficiency on their part, but rather is the result of aggressive westward economic expansion. This process was calculated and unconcerned with indigenous wellbeing. [...] Thus, federal policy, including the Indian Removal Act of 1830, was designed to displace Native Americans from coveted land and to relocate them to areas seen as relatively &quot;valueless by nineteenth century standards&quot;

Communities living on Native reservations are also disproportionately affected by environmental hazards. Due to them being deemed as &quot;undesirable&quot;, lands on and near reservations are often used by the U.S. government and private industries as areas for environmentally hazardous activities. These activities include uranium mining, nuclear waste disposal, and military testing. Due to this, many reservation communities have been subjected to adverse health issues. Specifically, according to scholar Traci Lynn Voyles, the Navajo Nation has been affected for decades by uranium mining and nuclear waste dumping: &quot;Radiation-related diseases are now endemic to many parts of the Navajo Nation, claiming the health and lives of former miners to be sure but also those of Navajos who would never see the inside of a mine. Diné children have a rate of testicular and ovarian cancer fifteen times the national average, and a fatal neurological disease called Navajo neuropathy has been closely linked to ingesting uranium-contaminated water during pregnancy&quot;.Other reservation communities have been subjected to instances like this as well. According to scholar Winona LaDuke, the Paiute- Shoshone community was deliberately exposed to radiation throughout the latter half of the 20th century:&quot;In 1951 the Atomic Energy Commission set up the Nevada Test Site within Western Shoshone territory as a proving grounds for nuclear weapons. Between 1951 and 1992, the U.S. and UK exploded 1,054 nuclear devices above and below ground [...] According to Sanchez, the Atomic Energy Commission would deliberately wait for clouds to blow north before conducting tests, so that the fallout would avoid any heavily populated areas such as Las Vegas and Los Angeles. This meant that the Shoshones would get a larger dose.&quot;Many Indigenous communities have also been subjected to the degradation of sacred lands in favor of resource extraction. Around 79 percent of the lithium deposits on U.S. soil are within 35 miles of Indian reservations. Thacker Pass is home to both one of the largest lithium deposits in the world and home to a sacred burial site of multiple tribes including the Pitt River and Paiute. The mining company, Lithium Nevada, was recently granted permission to mine the area by the Bureau of Land Management. Tribal members argue that these permits were unlawfully issued, and that &quot;the BLM notified only three of Nevada&#x27;s 27 tribes about the mine&quot;.

Historically, Indigenous groups have had little say when it comes to which land they are designated to occupy, as well as what happens to the land. This can be explained by the following excerpt from an academic journal on the impacts of climate change in the Arctic: &quot;While a government-to-government relationship is now officially required, these cases (which continue to define the indigenous/federal relationship in the U.S.) instituted a federal &#x27;trust responsibility&#x27; for indigenous people in the U.S., codifying a legal relationship of paternalism that limits the autonomy of tribal governments. The United States government is thus under a legal obligation to protect the lands, resources and traditionally used areas of indigenous peoples, and government agencies are required to consult with tribal governments and Alaska Native Corporations in natural resource decision-making. While some view this form of representation as the best and only practical means of influencing Northern policy, the actual involvement of tribal governments has been limited, and seen as perfunctory, and may be precluded by the procedural and structural mandates of federal law and legal precedent.&quot; We can see this with the amount of reservations placed near massive construction projects that lead to pollution, such as landfills or the Dakotas Access Pipeline. In addition, the lands that Indigenous people are designated to occupy by the federal government typically have difficulties already. As explained by scholars Gregory Hooks and Chad Smith in their academic journal connecting the focus on production to environmental issues, &quot;Federally owned and Native American lands tended to be in close proximity, and they had a great deal in common: they were concentrated in the states west of the Mississippi, and they tended to be lands that were too dry, remote, or barren to attract the attention of settlers and corporations.&quot;

Reservations are often designated or located close to &quot;superfund sites&quot; areas designated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as polluted and hazardous to live in and requiring action to clean up. In 2014, of 1,322 Superfund sites in the United States, 532 or almost 25% where in Indian Country. Some of these include the Jackpile-Paguate Uranium Mine on the Pueblo of Laguna, the St. Regis Paper Company on the Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe&#x27;s reservation, and the Sulphur Bank Mercury Mine on the Elem Band of Pomo Indians&#x27; reservation.

<text>Stephen Bier, formerly known by his stage name Madonna Wayne Gacy and by the nickname Pogo, is an American musician who was the keyboard player for Marilyn Manson from 1989 to 2007. His stage name came from the names of the singer Madonna and the serial killer John Wayne Gacy.

==Career==
Bier joined Marilyn Manson in late 1989 as a live prop actor after Zsa Zsa Speck left the band. Bier is responsible for much of the Qabalistic and numerological meanings behind Manson&#x27;s albums. He did not contribute to Manson&#x27;s album &quot;Eat Me, Drink Me&quot;, having been replaced by Chris Vrenna.

In 2007, Bier filed a lawsuit against Manson for unpaid &quot;partnership proceeds&quot;. Bier claims Manson spent the band&#x27;s earnings on luxurious items and &quot;devised a campaign to drive Bier out of the band and rob him of his entitlement&quot;. Manson filed a counter suit against Bier, accusing him of breach of contract. The lawsuit was settled for $380,000, $175,000 of which was paid out by Manson while the rest was ordered to be paid by Stephen Bier&#x27;s former business managers.

<text>Vahto () is a former municipality of Finland. It was consolidated with Rusko on January 1, 2009.

It is located in the province of Western Finland and is part of the Southwest Finland region. The municipality had a population of 1,876 (2004-12-31) and covered an area of 77.10 km2 of which 0.02 km2 is water. The population density was 24.34 inhabitants per km2.

Vahto was one of the 18 municipalities in the Turku region, and due to its close proximity to the center of Turku (about 20 km), it may also be considered part of the Turku metropolitan area. In the north, Vahto shared a common boundary mark with seven other municipalities. This famous site, called Kuhankuono in Finnish, is also a pre-historical border mark between Southwest Finland and the other Finnish provinces.

The municipality was unilingually Finnish.

<doc id="784912" wikidata="Q1507115" url="?curid=784912" title="Imperial Estate">
<text>An Imperial Estate (; , plural: &#x27;) was an entity or an individual of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] with representation and the right to vote in the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]] (&#x27;). Rulers of these Estates were able to exercise significant rights and privileges and were &quot;immediate&quot;, meaning the only authority above them was that of the Holy Roman Emperor. They were thus able to rule their territories with a considerable degree of autonomy.

The system of imperial states replaced the more regular division of Germany into stem duchies in the early medieval period. 
The old Carolingian stem duchies were retained as the major divisions of Germany under the Salian dynasty, but they became increasingly obsolete during the early high medieval period under the Hohenstaufen, and they were finally abolished in 1180 by Frederick Barbarossa in favour of more numerous territorial divisions. From 1489, the Imperial Estates represented in the Diet were divided into three chambers, the college of prince-electors (), the college of imperial princes () and the college of imperial cities. Counts and nobles were not directly represented in the Diet in spite of their immediate status, but were grouped into &quot;benches&quot; () with a single vote each.
Imperial Knights had immediate status but were not represented in the Diet.

== Composition ==
Imperial Estates could be either ecclesiastic or secular. The ecclesiastical Estates were led by:
* the three clerical Prince-electors: the Archbishops of Cologne, Mainz and Trier;
* Prince-Archbishops and Prince-Bishops as well as Prince-Abbots and Prince-Provosts of the Empire;
* Imperial Prelates, immediate Priors and Provosts;
* Grand Masters of military orders like the Teutonic Knights or Knights Hospitaller.
The secular Estates, most notably:
* the four Prince-Electors of the County Palatine of the Rhine, Saxony, Brandenburg and Bohemia, later also Bavaria (replacing the Palatinate) and Hanover.
* Imperial Princes including Grand Dukes, Dukes, Counts Palatine, Margraves and Landgraves;
* Imperial Counts, Burgraves, Barons, and prelates;
* the Free and Imperial cities.
Until 1582 the votes of the Free and Imperial Cities were only advisory. None of the rulers below the Holy Roman Emperor ranked as kings, with the exception of the Kings of Bohemia.

The status of Estate was normally attached to a particular territory within the Empire, but there were some &quot;&quot;, or &quot;persons with Imperial statehood&quot;. Originally, the Emperor alone could grant that status, but in 1653, several restrictions on the Emperor&#x27;s power were introduced. 
The creation of a new Estate required the assent of the College of Electors and of the College of Princes (see below). The ruler was required to agree to accept Imperial taxation and military obligations. Furthermore, the Estate was required to obtain admittance into one of the Imperial Circles. Theoretically, personalist Estates were forbidden after 1653, but exceptions were often made.
Once a territory attained the status of an Estate, it could only lose that status under very few circumstances. A territory ceded to a foreign power ceased to be an Estate.

From 1648 onwards, inheritance of the Estate was limited to one family; a territory inherited by a different family ceased to be an Estate unless the Emperor explicitly allowed otherwise. Finally, a territory could cease to be an Imperial Estate by being subjected to the Imperial ban (the most notable example involved Frederick V, Elector Palatine, who was banned in 1621 for his participation in the Bohemian Revolt).

In the German mediatization between 1803 and 1806, the vast majority of the Estates of the Holy Roman Empire were mediatised. They lost their Imperial immediacy and became part of other Estates. The number of Estates was reduced from about three hundred to about thirty. Mediatisation went along with secularisation: the abolition of most of the ecclesiastical Estates. This dissolution of the constitution of the structure of the empire was soon followed by the dissolution of the empire itself, in 1806.

== Rights and privileges ==
Rulers of Imperial States enjoyed precedence over other subjects in the Empire. Electors were originally styled &#x27; (Serene Highness), princes &#x27; (high-born) and counts &#x27; (high and well-born). In the eighteenth century, the electors were upgraded to &#x27; (Most Serene Highness), princes to &#x27; (Serene Highness) and counts to &#x27; (Illustrious Highness).

Imperial States enjoyed several rights and privileges. Rulers had autonomy inasmuch as their families were concerned; in particular, they were permitted to make rules regarding the inheritance of their states without imperial interference. They were permitted to make treaties and enter into alliances with other Imperial States as well as with foreign nations. The electors, but not the other rulers, were permitted to exercise certain regalian powers, including the power to mint money, the power to collect tolls and a monopoly over gold and silver mines.

== Imperial Diet ==
From 1489 onwards, the Imperial Diet was divided into three &quot;&quot;: the Council of Electors, the Council of Princes, and the Council of Cities. Electoral states belonged to the Council of Electors; other states, whether ecclesiastical or secular, belonged to the Council of Princes.

Votes were held in right of the states, rather than personally. Consequently, an individual ruling several states held multiple votes; similarly, multiple individuals ruling parts of the same state shared a single vote. These rules were not formalized until 1582; before then, when multiple individuals inherited parts of the same state, they sometimes received a vote each. Votes were either individual or collective. Princes and senior clerics generally held individual votes (but such votes, as noted above, were sometimes shared). Prelates (abbots and priors) without individual votes were classified into two benches: the Bench of the Rhine and the Bench of Swabia. Each of these had a collective vote. Similarly, Counts were grouped into four comital benches with one collective vote each: the Upper Rhenish Bench of Wetterau, the Swabian Bench, the Franconian Bench and the Westphalian Bench.

No elector ever held multiple electorates; nor were electorates ever divided between multiple heirs. Hence, in the Council of Electors, each individual held exactly one vote. An example of this was when Charles Theodore, Elector Palatine, inherited the Electorate of Bavaria in 1777, the vote of the Palatinate was nullified. However, Electors who ruled states in addition to their electorates also voted in the Council of Princes; similarly, princes who also ruled comital territories voted both individually and in the comital benches. In the Reichstag in 1792, for instance, the Elector of Brandenburg held eight individual votes in the Council of Princes and one vote in the Bench of Westphalia. Similarly, among ecclesiastics, the Grand Master of the Teutonic Order held one individual vote in the Council of Princes and two in the Bench of the Rhine.

==Quaternions==

The so-called imperial quaternions (German: &quot;Quaternionen der Reichsverfassung&quot; &quot;quaternions of the imperial constitution&quot;; from Latin &quot;quaterniō&quot; &quot;group of four soldiers&quot;)
were a conventional representation of the Imperial States of the Holy Roman Empire which first became current in the 15th century and was extremely popular during the 16th century.

Apart from the highest tiers of the emperor, kings, prince-bishops and the prince electors, the estates are represented in groups of four. The number of quaternions was usually ten, in descending order of precedence Dukes (&quot;Duces&quot;), Margraves (&quot;Marchiones&quot;), Landgraves (&quot;Comites Provinciales&quot;), Burggraves (&quot;Comites Castrenses&quot;), Counts (&quot;Comites&quot;), Knights (&quot;Milites&quot;), Noblemen (&quot;Liberi&quot;), Cities (&quot;Metropoles&quot;), Villages (&quot;Villae&quot;) and Peasants (&quot;Rustici&quot;). The list could be shortened or expanded, by the mid-16th century to as many as 45.
It is likely that this system was first introduced under Emperor Sigismund, who is assumed to have commissioned the frescoes in Frankfurt city hall in 1414.

As has been noted from an early time, this representation of the &quot;imperial constitution&quot; does not in fact represent the actual constitution of the Holy Roman Empire, as some imperial cities appear as &quot;villages&quot; or even &quot;peasants&quot;. 
E.g. the four &quot;peasants&quot; are Cologne, Constance, Regensburg and Salzburg. The Burggrave of Stramberg (or Stromberg, Straburg, Strandeck, and variants) was an unknown entity even at the time. The representation of imperial subjects is also far from complete. The &quot;imperial quaternions&quot; are, rather, a more or less random selection intended to represent &quot;pars pro toto&quot; the structure of the imperial constitution.

<doc id="784921" wikidata="Q4891029" url="?curid=784921" title="Sea Service Ribbon">
<text>A Sea Service Ribbon is an award of the United States Navy, U.S. Marine Corps, U.S. Coast Guard, the U.S. Army, and the NOAA Commissioned Officer Corps which recognizes those service members who have performed military duty while stationed on a United States Navy, Coast Guard, Army, or NOAA vessel at sea and/or members of the Navy, Marine Corps or Coast Guard who have been forward-deployed with their home unit.

Additional awards of the Sea Service Deployment Ribbon, Naval Reserve Sea Service Ribbon, Coast Guard Sea Service Ribbon, Army Sea Duty Ribbon, and NOAA Corps Sea Service Deployment Ribbon are denoted by bronze and/or silver service stars on the ribbon.

==U.S. Army Sea Duty Ribbon==

The U.S. Army Sea Duty Ribbon (ASDR) was established on 17 April 2006 as the &quot;Army Sea Duty Ribbon&quot;; its name was changed to its current moniker on 30 June 2010. It may be awarded to active duty soldiers who complete two cumulative years of sea duty on a Class A or B U.S. Army vessel. Duty aboard U.S. Navy, U.S. Coast Guard, U.S. Navy Military Sealift Command, NOAA vessels, or aboard Army leased or foreign and non–military vessels may also qualify if soldiers serving on those vessels have a formally assigned primary mission that is accomplished underway, are in an active status, and are approved for creditable sea service by the Career Sea Pay Office. The Chief of the Marine Qualification Division is the approval authority for award of the ASDR to eligible service members. The ASDR may be awarded retroactively to those personnel who were credited with qualifying service, as defined in regulations, after August 1, 1952. Subsequent awards are authorized upon completion of an additional two years of cumulative sea duty under qualifying conditions.

U.S. Army Reserve and U.S. Army National Guard soldiers must have two creditable years in a U.S. Army watercraft unit, including a minimum of 25 days underway annually as well as two annual training exercises underway on a Class A or B army vessel; or a 90-day deployment aboard an army vessel underway. Subsequent awards are authorized upon the completion of additional qualifying periods of sea duty. For mobilized soldiers, one year of sea duty as a mobilized soldier will be credited toward one creditable year as long as minimum underway requirements are met.

The U.S. Army Sea Duty Ribbon is wide, composed of vertical stripes. The edges are in navy blue, bordered by scarlet stripes, followed by stripes of old gold, bordered by stripes of teal blue, next to stripes of grotto blue, bordered by stripes of soldier red, and a center stripe of old gold. Subsequent awards are denoted by bronze and silver service stars.

==Navy and Marine Corps Sea Service Deployment Ribbon==

The Navy and Marine Corps Sea Service Deployment Ribbon (SSDR) is a service award of the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps which was authorized in May 1980 and retroactively authorized to 15 August 1974, coinciding with a temporary suspension in authority for award of the National Defense Service Medal between that date and 2 August 1990. It was the first type of sea service ribbon established in the U.S. Armed Forces.

The Sea Service Deployment Ribbon is granted to any member of the U.S. Navy or U.S. Marine Corps assigned to a deployable unit (e.g., a ship (including submarines), aircraft squadron, air wing or air group, detachment, battalion, Marine Expeditionary Unit, Marine Air Ground Task Force, or other unit type that operates away from its assigned homeport) and is forward-deployed for a period of either 90 consecutive days or two periods of at least 80 days each within a given 12-month period; or 6 months stationed overseas in a forward deployed location. Staffs of embarked Destroyer Squadrons (DESRONs), Amphibious Squadrons (PHIBRONs), Amphibious Readiness Groups (ARG), Expeditionary Strike Groups (ESGs), Carrier Strike Groups (CSGs) and similar units deployed within time period requirements are also eligible for award. A bronze star is awarded for the second through the fifth award of the ribbon; a silver star would be worn in lieu of five -inch bronze stars.

When a ship&#x27;s crew qualifies for the Sea Service Deployment Ribbon, the ship is authorized to paint and display the ribbon and award stars on the port and starboard side of the bulwark aft to designate the number of deployments conducted throughout the commissioned life of the ship since August 1974.

When a U.S. Navy or U.S. Marine Corps aviation squadron qualifies for the Sea Service Deployment Ribbon, the squadron is authorized to paint and display the ribbon and award stars on the exterior or interior of their hangar or squadron spaces to designate the number of deployments conducted throughout the active life of that squadron since August 1974.

==Navy Reserve Sea Service Deployment Ribbon==

The Navy Reserve Sea Service Deployment Ribbon (f/k/a Naval Reserve Sea Service Ribbon) was created in May 1986. As of January 1, 2014, it is awarded to any member of the U.S. Navy Reserve who completes a cumulative total of 90 days of OCONUS or Underway Duty while assigned to a deployable Navy Reserve or Active-Duty unit. Active-Duty members assigned to a deployable Navy Reserve unit are also eligible for the award under the same qualifying service requirements. Qualifying service must be performed in an operational or operational support role with a deployable unit while operating underway or OCONUS, away from homeport or the permanent duty station. A member is eligible for one award upon completing 90 cumulative days of qualifying service regardless of the length of time required to accumulate the qualifying days. Additional restrictions apply to Inactive Duty Training (IDT) drill periods and travel days. For Selected Reserve (SELRES) IDT drill periods, only one day of qualifying service is authorized per calendar day regardless of the number of drill periods performed. Each travel day between a Navy Operational Support Center (NOSC)/Permanent Duty Station and the qualifying duty location is considered .5 days for purposes of counting qualifying days. Qualifying days applied to the Navy Reserve Sea Service Deployment Ribbon may not be credited towards the Sea Service Deployment Ribbon or the Navy and Marine Corps Overseas Service Ribbon.

For service prior to January 1, 2014, the former requirements still apply. Under those rules, the Naval Reserve Sea Service Ribbon was awarded to any member of the U.S. Navy Reserve (formerly U.S. Naval Reserve) who, while serving as a drilling Selected Reservist (SELRES) or a Training and Administration of the Reserve/Full Time Support (TAR/FTS) officer or sailor, completed twenty-four cumulative months of duty on board a U.S. Navy Reserve Force surface ship or assigned to a deployable/regularly deploying U.S. Navy Reserve Force Aviation Squadron (RESFORON).

The term &quot;Navy Reserve Force Ship&quot; refers to any U.S. Navy commissioned warship under the operational or administrative control of the Navy Reserve, or a self-propelled auxiliary, boat, or other surface craft operated under the operational control of fleet or type commanders.

The term &quot;Navy Reserve Force Aviation Squadron&quot; refers to any Navy Reserve flying squadron that operates naval aircraft, is considered a command at sea, routinely deploys or is capable of deploying overseas, and is considered a &quot;hardware&quot; unit under the operational control of Commander, Naval Air Force Reserve (formerly Commander, Naval Air Reserve Force) or fleet or other type commanders.

The Navy Reserve Sea Service Ribbon is also granted to members of embarked Navy Reserve staffs, provided that at least half of the embarked reserve drills qualified as underway drills.

The Navy Reserve Sea Service Ribbon is not eligible for service performed by Marine Corps Forces Reserve members, or Navy Reservists who were called to active duty, but the service performed by those personnel would qualify towards the &quot;Sea Service Deployment Ribbon&quot; or the &quot;Navy and Marine Corps Overseas Service Ribbon&quot; as applicable.

==Coast Guard Sea Service Ribbon==

The Coast Guard Sea Service Ribbon is a United States Coast Guard decoration that was created in 1984. It is awarded to those members of the Coast Guard who serve more than twelve cumulative months of sea duty on board a U.S. Coast Guard cutter, attached to a Fleet Training Group, or on board certain other Coast Guard vessels and non-Coast Guard vessels (i.e., U.S. Navy warships with a Coast Guard Law Enforcement Detachment [LEDET] embarked) that are under official Coast Guard orders. Additional awards, displayed as service stars, may be awarded for a further three years of sea service.

==NOAA Corps Sea Service Deployment Ribbon==

The NOAA Corps Sea Service Deployment Ribbon is a NOAA Commissioned Corps award established retroactive to 1 January 2002. It is awarded to NOAA Commissioned Corps and Public Health Service Officers who have served twelve months accumulated sea duty, which may also include temporary duty at sea, that includes at least one 90 consecutive-day deployment. Subsequent awards may be earned for additional twelve-month accumulations of sea duty, so long as they also include an additional 90 consecutive-day deployment. Previously, the Navy Sea Service Deployment Ribbon was awarded. Those NOAA Corps members who previously earned the Navy Sea Service Deployment Ribbon replace it with the NOAA version, unless they earned the Navy version while serving in the Navy.

<text>Vampula is a former municipality of Finland. It was consolidated with Huittinen on 1 January 2009.

It is located in the province of Western Finland and is part of the Satakunta region. The municipality had a population of 1,677 (31 December 2008) and covered a land area of . The population density was .

The municipality was unilingually Finnish.

== History ==
A few discoveries of objects from the Stone Age have been made in the Vampula area. Farming started along Loimijoki already in the Iron Age, and by the 13th century at the latest, almost all of Vampula&#x27;s major inhabited villages were recorded by the church authority. The first inhabitants arrived in the Vampula area probably from Huittinen, but the oldest church connections point to Säkylä.

In 1590, four householders built a small log church at their own expense. This first sanctuary is used as a motif for the municipality&#x27;s coat of arms, which depicts a cross and four nails as a metaphor for the builders. Vampula got its own municipal administration in 1867. The first public school opened in Sallila village in 1878, and was followed by schools in Soinila (1897), Kukonharjan-Murro (1910) and Huhtaa (1915). The Finnish senate made a decision to establish Vampula congregation in 1891, but independence from Huittinen was only realized in 1900.

Varkaus was born in the late 19th century as an industrial community of the A. Ahlström paper mills. It was a part of the municipalities of Leppävirta and Joroinen until 1929 when Varkaus became a market town. During the Finnish Civil War in 1918 the town was taken over by the Reds, but because of its isolated location in rural Finland, it was soon taken by the Whites on the Battle of Varkaus 19–21 February. The whites proceeded to execute every tenth Red soldier.

The municipality of Kangaslampi was consolidated to Varkaus on 1 January 2005.

== Sport ==
The bandy team Warkauden Pallo-35, or just WP-35, plays in the highest division, Bandyliiga, and has become Finnish champions 16 times.

Varkaus Speedway Stadion is a motorcycle speedway on the northern outskirts of the town off the Tykkitie road, adjacent to the motorcycle racing and karting facilities.

<doc id="784934" wikidata="Q640259" url="?curid=784934" title="Allen Ludden">
<text>Allen Ellsworth Ludden (born Allen Packard Ellsworth; October 5, 1917 – June 9, 1981) was an American television personality, actor, singer, emcee, and game show host. He hosted various incarnations of the game show &quot;Password&quot; between 1961 and 1980.

==Early years==
Ludden was born on October 5, 1917, in Mineral Point, Wisconsin, the first child of Elmer and Leila M. (née Allen) Ellsworth. Elmer was a Nebraska native who worked as an ice dealer, while Leila was a Wisconsin native and housewife. Elmer Ellsworth died on January 6, 1919, at age 26, from the Spanish flu.

When Ludden was about five years old, his mother married Homer J. Ludden, an electrical engineer. Homer J. Ludden was the son of Franklin C. Ludden, a merchant and then the superintendent of the electric plant in Mineral Point, Wisconsin. Allen was given his adoptive father&#x27;s name and became Allen Ellsworth Ludden. The family lived briefly in the Wisconsin cities of Janesville, Elkhorn, Antigo, and Waupaca before moving to Texas when Ludden was nine years old. The Ludden family resided in Corpus Christi in 1940, appearing in the City Directory, where Allen is listed as a student, Homer an engineer, and Homer and Leila&#x27;s son, Franklin C. Ludden, a mail clerk.

==Education and career==

An English and dramatics major at the University of Texas (now known as the University of Texas at Austin), Ludden graduated with Phi Beta Kappa honors in 1940 and received his Master of Arts in English from the same university in 1941. He served in the United States Army as officer in charge of entertainment in the Pacific theater, received a Bronze Star Medal for meritorious service, and was discharged with the rank of captain in 1946.

In 1948, Ludden became the program director at radio station WCBS in New York City. He left that position in June 1959 to become program coordinator for all CBS owned-and-operated radio stations. During the late 1940s and early 1950s he began his career as an adviser for youth in teen magazine columns and on radio. His radio show for teenagers, &quot;Mind Your Manners&quot;, received an honorable mention Peabody Award in 1950.

Ludden hosted many game shows, including the &quot;College Bowl&quot;, but he was most well known for hosting both the daytime and prime time versions of &quot;Password&quot; on CBS and ABC between 1961 and 1975. His opening TV catch phrase, &quot;Hi doll,&quot; was directed toward his mother-in-law, Tess White, the mother of his wife, actress and television personality Betty White.

Ludden began hosting an updated version of the game, &quot;Password Plus&quot;, on NBC, in 1979, but chemotherapy treatments for stomach cancer forced him off the show in late October 1980. Other shows hosted by Ludden include &quot;Liar&#x27;s Club&quot;, &quot;Win with the Stars&quot;, and &quot;Stumpers!&quot; He also hosted the original pilot for &quot;The Joker&#x27;s Wild&quot; and hosted a talk-variety show, &quot;Allen Ludden&#x27;s Gallery&quot;.

At the request of the publishers Dodd, Mead &amp; Co., Ludden wrote and published four books of &quot;Plain Talk&quot; advice, plus a youth novel, &quot;Roger Thomas, Actor&quot; (1959), all for young readers. He received the 1961 Horatio Alger Award. He released an album called &quot;Allen Ludden Sings His Favorite Songs&quot; on RCA Records in 1964.

==Family==
Ludden married Margaret McGloin on October 11, 1943. She died of cancer on October 30, 1961. They had a son, David, and two daughters, Martha and Sarah.

He proposed to Betty White, whom he had met on &quot;Password&quot;, at least twice before she accepted. Their romance blossomed when they played summer stock theatre together, in the play &quot;Critic&#x27;s Choice&quot; in 1962. They also appeared together in the romantic comedy &quot;Janus&quot; in 1963. They were married on June 6, 1963, and remained together until Ludden&#x27;s death.

They appeared together in an episode of &quot;The Odd Couple&quot; in which Felix and Oscar appeared on &quot;Password&quot; and also as a couple on a season 4 episode of &quot;The Love Boat&quot;.

==Death==
After Ludden was diagnosed with stomach cancer in early 1980, he took a month-long leave of absence from &quot;Password Plus&quot; for chemotherapy treatment, with Bill Cullen filling in as host. On October 7, 1980, he slipped into a coma while on vacation in Monterey, California. It was initially reported that he had a stroke, but the coma was actually caused by high levels of calcium from medication taken to help fight the cancer. Tom Kennedy assumed duties as host of &quot;Password Plus&quot;, and although Ludden hoped to return to the show, his cancer grew worse and he never returned. He died in Los Angeles on June 9, 1981, at age 63. Ludden was buried beside his father in the Ellsworth family plot in Graceland Cemetery in his hometown of Mineral Point, Wisconsin.

==Legacy==
A walkway at the Los Angeles Zoo was named in his memory (Betty White was a board member at the Zoo), and an artificial lake in Mineral Point was named Ludden Lake in his honor. Betty White also donated a Labrador Retriever named &quot;Ludden&quot; to Guide Dogs for the Blind in San Rafael, California, in memory of her late husband.

Ludden&#x27;s star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame is located on the north side of the 6700 block of Hollywood Boulevard, next to Betty White&#x27;s. White accepted Ludden&#x27;s posthumous star on April 19, 1987, during an appearance on &quot;This Is Your Life&quot;. The star was formally unveiled in a ceremony on March 31, 1988.

When Betty White was asked in an interview on &quot;Larry King Live&quot; whether she would remarry, she said, &quot;Once you&#x27;ve had the best, who needs the rest?&quot; She never remarried and died in 2021 at age 99.

== Archive ==
The Allen Ludden Papers collection is located at the Free Public Library in his native Mineral Point, Wisconsin. The items include letters written or received by Ludden, typed radio scripts, newspaper and magazine clippings by or about Ludden, publicity photographs and personal photographs, and a broken pair of horn-rimmed glasses. The collection was donated by Betty White.

<text>Velkua () is a former municipality of Finland. It was, together with Merimasku and Rymättylä, consolidated with the town of Naantali on January 1, 2009.

== History ==
The village of Palva, located on the homonymous island, was mentioned already in 1469. Its name may refer to a place where meat and fish were cured by hunters or to a site of worship. Palva was the original center of the area, becoming a separate chapel community in 1793, when it was a part of the Taivassalo parish. In the 19th century, the name &quot;Velkua&quot; began appearing for the chapel community after the largest island in it: &quot;Velkua&quot; or &quot;Velkuanmaa&quot;. A densely populated village on the island of Velkua, &quot;Velkuankaupunki&quot;, was established in the 19th century.

The municipality was established in the 1860s and &quot;Velkua&quot; had become the predominant name. Velkua became a separate parish in 1917.

Velkua was consolidated with Naantali in 2009.

<text>Edward Davis Fagan (born October 20, 1952, Harlingen, Texas) is a former American reparations lawyer who was disbarred for his conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation.

Fagan was raised in San Antonio, Texas. He participated in the Yom Kippur War in Israel. After graduating from Cardozo School of Law in 1980, he initially worked as a personal injury lawyer and later with a law firm representing corporate defendants. In the 1980s, he founded an exploration club for the wealthy, organizing trips to exotic locations accompanied by scientists and environmentalists.

Fagan gained attention for filing lawsuits against Swiss banks in 1995, seeking reparations for Holocaust victims. Critics accused him of prioritizing personal gain and failing to adequately represent his clients. Fagan faced controversies in other cases, such as the 2002 slavery class action lawsuit and 2005 Kaprun disaster lawsuit.

Fagan lost his license in both New York and New Jersey for failing to pay court fines, and stealing client money and escrow trust funds from Holocaust survivors, some of whom he represented in the 1996-98 World Jewish Congress-initiated lawsuit against Swiss banks. Bankruptcy proceedings in 2007 revealed significant financial troubles, with debts said to be $9.4m.

==Background==
Fagan was born in Harlingen, Texas, and raised in a Conservative Jewish home in San Antonio, Texas and has two children. Before embarking on his legal career, he traveled to Israel to take part in the Yom Kippur War. After returning to the US, he enrolled in Cardozo School of Law and graduated in 1980. He initially worked as a personal injury lawyer, then worked with a large law firm, representing corporate defendants, before he started an exploration club for the wealthy in the 1980s, allowing rich customers to visit exotic locations, entertained and accompanied by scientists and environmentalists. A nonprofit venture of the business, the Odyssoe Foundation, was created in 1991, but collapsed with the entire enterprise.

Clients and partners have stated publicly and in court that Fagan often failed to represent the interests of his clients, generally took on &quot;too many clients&quot;, &quot;vastly outstrip[ed] his resources&quot; and was &quot;often absent for the legal fight&quot;. According to Burt Neuborne, law professor at New York University, who had worked with Fagan before breaking with him, &quot;Mr. Fagan&#x27;s filing in the Swiss banks case was so inadequate that a judge asked him to rewrite it...This was an ordinary man who got swept up in issues that were bigger than he was.&quot;

== Career ==
=== 1995 Holocaust lawsuits against Swiss banks ===
In the 1995, Fagan filed lawsuits against three Swiss banks that had refused to release funds they held that belonged to Holocaust victims. The banks in question settled the claims outside of court, resulting in a payout of US$1.25 billion.

According to news reports Fagan held up the final formal signing of the German slave labor settlement because he wanted more money for himself. While several hundred people and German and American representatives waited, Fagan, still wearing an ABCNEWS &quot;20/20&quot; microphone, could be heard &quot;haggling over the fees, and then boasting of his success&quot;. He was recorded saying &quot;I got the legal fees up..We did great, we did great we just got another, we just got some more money.&quot;

Among Fagan&#x27;s many critics was New York University law professor Burt Neuborne, who had said on record: &quot;We essentially worked around him...I mean, he was, he was there, but, but he played, if I tell you zero, I mean zero role in developing the legal theory, in presenting the legal theory, and in participating as a lawyer.&quot; Neuborne, a leading human rights lawyer, believed that it was time to set the record straight:

In 1998, Gizella Weisshaus, the named plaintiff in the lawsuit against Swiss banks, opted out of that historic settlement because she felt that her attorneys were more interested in paying themselves millions of dollars, even before some of the survivors had received any money. On April 8, 1998, Weisshauss filed an attorney ethics complaint, claiming that Fagan, her lawyer at the time, held back $82,583.04 (~$ in ) belonging to her from the estate of her deceased cousin Jack Oestreicher. Hal R. Lieberman, from Departmental Disciplinary Committee, Supreme Court, Appellate Division, responded on May 6, 1998, that in this &quot;ongoing criminal proceeding&quot; the outcome of the disciplinary investigation should be awaited.

In 2000, Fagan represented some 82,000 Holocaust victims and family members (many of whom later accused him of negligence), suing governments and companies in Germany and Austria based on the Alien Tort Claims Act.

===2002 slavery class action lawsuit===
In April 2002, Fagan filed a class action lawsuit against eighteen companies, including FleetBoston, CSX Corporation, Aetna, Union Pacific Railroad, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company and Lehman Brothers, accusing the companies to have &quot;unjustly enriched (themselves) through profits earned either directly or indirectly from the Trans-Atlantic slave trade and slavery between 1619 and 1865, as well as post-Emancipation slavery through the 1960s&quot;. In January 2004, Judge Charles R Norgle dismissed the lawsuit because Fagan failed to establish a clear link between plaintiffs and the companies.

===2002 apartheid lawsuit against Swiss and U.S. banks===
According to news reports by CNN, the &quot;maverick lawyer&quot; attempted to file a $50 billion class action lawsuit against Swiss-based UBS and Credit Suisse and U.S.-based Citicorp Inc. for providing funds to the South African apartheid government during 1985 and 1993. Swiss Foreign Ministry spokesman Ruedi Christen dismissed the lawsuit with the following words: &quot;It&#x27;s another unjust attack against Switzerland,&quot; an opinion shared in Switzerland, where citizens told Fagan to &quot;Go home!&quot; and &quot;Wash your dirty linen elsewhere&quot;, when he held a news conference on Zurich&#x27;s Paradeplatz, home of the two biggest banks of Switzerland: Credit Suisse and UBS.

=== 2003 apartheid lawsuit against Anglo American ===
In 2003, Fagan and South African law firm Ngcebetsha Madlanga Attorneys attempted to sue Anglo American, the world&#x27;s second-biggest mining company, diamond producer De Beers, Sasol Ltd., which supplies about 44% of South Africa&#x27;s motor fuel, and Fluor Corporation, a California-based engineering company, claiming that the companies profited from South Africa&#x27;s racial discrimination policies that ended in 1994. The claims were dismissed by a federal district judge in November 2004, and Fagan was not allowed to represent the case.

=== 2004 artwork lawsuit against Bank Austria Creditanstalt AG ===
In 2004, Fagan filed a federal lawsuit in Manhattan for a non-existent group called the Association of Holocaust Victims for Restitution of Artwork &amp; Masterpieces (AHVRAM) against Bank Austria Creditanstalt AG and other European corporate, governmental and financial institutions for $6.8 billion. The lawsuit alleged the theft of artworks and other property during World War II&#x27;s Holocaust, but was dismissed by U.S. District Court Judge Shirley Wohl Kram on August 19, 2005, because Fagan failed to state any basis for federal court jurisdiction of the &quot;frivolous&quot; and &quot;bad faith&quot; lawsuit. Kram noted that the &quot;plaintiff organization AHVRAM did not exist,&quot; Fagan&#x27;s &quot;lack of preparation and professionalism, his &#x27;glaringly inadequate filings,&#x27; and the fact that he deceived the court&quot;. Fagan&#x27;s failure to pay the more than $350,000 (~$ in ) in fines and litigation costs to the Bank Austria Creditanstalt AG led to his bankruptcy and disbarment.

===2004 slave trade lawsuit against Lloyd&#x27;s of London===
In the same year, Fagan unsuccessfully sued Britain&#x27;s Lloyd&#x27;s of London for insuring slave ships involved in the transatlantic slave trade. Fagan&#x27;s inclusion of demands for financial compensation in his lawsuit was criticized by Kofi Mawuli Klu, the chairman of the Pan-Afrikan Taskforce for Internationalist Dialogue (PATFID); the Anti-Slavery Abolitionist Heritage Learning Movement and member of the Pan-Afrikan Reparations Coalition in Europe (PARCOE): &quot;We have to make sure that the focus does not shift from the broad, deeper understanding of reparations to just one of financial compensation...We see action for reparations more as an educational issue of bringing masses of people into the fight against racism.&quot;

=== 2005 Kaprun disaster lawsuit ===
Fagan attempted to represent the plaintiffs in a suit brought by relatives of 6 Americans who died in mountain railway disaster in Kaprun, Austria, which killed 155 people, but in August 2007, Southern District of New York Judge Shira Scheindlin disqualified Fagan from representing the plaintiffs, after noting that Fagan, who had filed for personal bankruptcy, had a personal interest in the litigation&#x27;s outcome and made false representations to the court. Scheindlin slapped the attorney with a $5,000 fine. Fagan continues to seek winnings [2009] in this case with a former partner in the case that through their failed Florida partnership representing victims in the Louis J Pearlman fraud, allowed Fagan to vindictively sell his services to victims of that fraud. Fagan eventually deserted these clients after severely hurting their chances of any recovery due to his obstructionist and disingenuous involvement in their cases.

=== 2005 Indian Ocean tsunami victims lawsuit ===
In 2005, he initiated a lawsuit on behalf of 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake victims. The lawsuit was directed against the Thai government, the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the French hotel group Sofitel for insufficient quake and tsunami warnings.

=== 2006 Borat lawsuit ===
In 2006, Fagan initiated legal proceedings, suing the makers of the film &quot;&quot; for $30 million (~$ in ) in damages on behalf of two inhabitants of the Romanian village of Glod, Dâmbovita for human rights violations. He planned to submit lawsuits in New York and Florida state courts, as well as in Frankfurt, Germany. Fagan said that he hoped to &quot;teach Hollywood a very expensive lesson&quot;. The lawsuit was thrown out by U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska in a hearing in early December 2006 on the grounds that the charges were too vague to stand up in court. Fagan planned to refile.

== Malpractice ==
Fagan has been accused of abandoning personal injury clients in favor of the more lucrative Holocaust reparations cases. One personal injury client sued Fagan, and won a $3.2 million malpractice award. Fagan has been accused of having wasted over $500,000 of his clients&#x27; money.

In 1998, Judge Sterling Johnson Jr. of Federal District Court dismissed the federal lawsuit of Mr. Ortiz, noting that Fagan, his attorney, had &quot;failed to prosecute&quot; it for three years and had ignored court orders. The lawsuit of Ortiz, then a 49-year-old truck driver involved in a traffic accident, started in 1994, when Fagan filed a $35 million lawsuit on his behalf in federal court in Brooklyn and State Supreme Court, but Fagan failed to pursue the case after 1996. After that, Fagan did not see, visit, or speak with his client.

In another case, Fagan failed to submit a claim for Tom Giron to a New York state fund that compensates victims of uninsured motorists. Giron was struck and severely injured in 1992 by a car reported stolen, but did not receive any compensation, because, according to Jeffrey Rubinton, the fund&#x27;s president, a claim was never filed and &quot;its records showed that such an action had not been pursued and that the statute of limitations on making one had long expired.&quot; Another client, Offer Salmoni, won a $167,000 malpractice judgment against Fagan, because Fagan repeatedly failed to make court appearances in his eviction case, and so the statute of limitations expired without refiling.

New Jersey ethics officials filed a misconduct complaint before a grievance committee against Fagan on behalf of Diane Gibbons, another former client, who complained that Fagan failed to submit required papers in her personal injury case, leading to its dismissal. During the proceedings Fagan was forced to admit that he failed to withdraw from suits that he could not pursue, excusing himself with the words: &quot;I was in over my head a lot of the time.&quot;

== Sexual misconduct investigation ==
The Jewish Daily &quot;The Forward&quot; reported in October 2005 that Fagan was engaged in a legal investigation about published accusations and sexual contacts with underage prostitutes in Austria. Austrian print and broadcast media reported that the state prosecutor in Vienna is looking into Fagan&#x27;s contact with a prostitution ring that involved underage girls from Eastern Europe. Fagan confirmed the sexual contacts with a 17-year-old Lithuanian prostitute named Inga but claims that he believed the prostitute to be at least 22 years old. Although prostitution is regulated in Austria, it is still illegal to knowingly hire a prostitute under the age of 18. The maximum sentence, according to § 207b (Sexual abuses of adolescents) of the Austrian Strafgesetzbuch (criminal law) is 3 years of imprisonment.

== Disbarment in New Jersey and New York ==
In 2005, Fagan became the subject of an ethics investigation by the New Jersey Office of Attorney Ethics, accusing him of &quot;knowing misappropriation&quot; of client money. On April 2, 2007, Appellate Division, 1st Department held that Fagan had &quot;violated a number of disciplinary rules prohibiting an attorney from disregarding a court&#x27;s rulings, engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, misrepresentation or deceit, and acquiring a proprietary interest in the subject of the litigation.&quot;

On December 11, 2008, in the &quot;Matter of Edward D. Fagan, M-2732, M-3148, M-3193&quot;, a unanimous panel of the Appellate Division, 1st Department, ruled, that Fagan&#x27;s failure to pay sanctions and money owed to Bank Austria, his &quot;pattern of prior sanctions for unprofessional conduct&quot; and his &quot;lack of contrition&quot; made him unfit to practice law. Fagans will be &quot;stricken from the roll of attorneys and counselors-at-law in the State of New York.&quot; The following day, Fagan was disbarred in New York for failing to pay a court fine and fees due to Bank Austria.

Following the 2008 recommendation of a special ethics master, the state disciplinary board of New Jersey decided in January 2009 that Fagan should be disbarred and banned from practicing in the state because he misappropriated hundreds of thousands of dollars entrusted to him by Holocaust survivors.

== Bankruptcy ==
Fagan&#x27;s finances and businesses started to collapse in the 1990s. According to public records and newspaper articles Fagan began to owe large amounts of federal income taxes. In 1996 the Nynex Corporation filed a $228,000 lawsuit against Odyssoe in a New Jersey court for unpaid advertisements services, a bill that was, according to a spokeswoman for Verizon, the successor to Nynex, not even paid in 2000. Facing an eviction proceeding for unpaid rent, Fagan was forced in 1997 to abandon his offices and rent space from a law firm in the World Trade Center.

In 2005, Fagan had 28 outstanding court awards and liens of more than $4 million against him and his firm, Fagan &amp; Associates, including three from clients who alleged that he neglected their cases. In February 2007, he filed for protection under federal bankruptcy laws in Tampa, Florida. Court documents are said to show that he owes about $9.4 million to creditors.

<text>Carlos Hartling (2 September 1869 – 13 August 1920) was a German-born composer from Honduras, who composed the music for the national anthem of Honduras, adopted as the country&#x27;s national anthem in 1915. 

Born in Schlotheim, Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt, his parents were Georg Friedrich Hartlíng and Johanne Henriete Wilhemine Hartling. He studied in the Weimar and Leipzing Conservatory. In September 1896, he went to Tegucigalpa because he had a 27 June 1896 contract to be a music and band teacher. He sang for the first time on 23 September. In 1903, he received the honor of writing the music of a poem written by Augusto Cesar Coello Ramos. He was married to Guadalupe Ferrari Guardiola. Since the second administration of General Manuel Bonilla in February 1912, the lyrics and music were popularized and sung at all official ceremonies.

The Museo de la Republica in Tegucigalpa has his zither on display.

<text>Bacon is an English surname originally from Normandy and England.
==Etymology==
Its etymology is uncertain, with favoring a derivation from a diminutive of Germanic &quot;bach&quot; (&quot;little stream, creek&quot;) and others from an eponymous seigniory in Normandy or from a corruption of Beacon. It is sometimes folk etymologized from &quot;bacon&quot;.

<text>A cordless telephone or portable telephone has a portable telephone handset that connects by radio to a base station connected to the public telephone network. The operational range is limited, usually to the same building or within some short distance from the base station.

A cordless telephone differs functionally from a mobile phone in its limited range and by depending on the base station on the subscriber premises. Current cordless telephone standards, such as PHS and DECT, have blurred the once clear-cut line between cordless and mobile telephones by implementing cell handoff (handover); various advanced features, such as data-transfer; and even, on a limited scale, international roaming. In specialized models, a commercial mobile network operator may maintain base stations and users subscribe to the service.

Unlike a corded telephone, a cordless telephone needs mains electricity (to power the base station). The cordless handset contains a rechargeable battery, which the base station re-charges when the handset rests in its cradle.

==History==

Radio telephony (telephony without wires) predated cordless phones by at least two decades. The first, MTS, or Mobile Telephone Service went into service in 1946. Because the range was intended to cover the widest possible service area, capacity was extremely low, and the early tube technology made equipment rather large and heavy. The second generation radio telephone, or IMTS, or Improved Mobile Telephone Service became active in 1964.

Beginning in 1963, a small team of Bell Laboratories engineers were tasked with developing a practical and fully functional duplex wireless telephone. The team included (in alphabetic order): S.M. Baer, G.C. Balzer, J.M. Brown, W.F. Clemency, M. Rosenthal, and W. Zinsmeister, under the direction of W.D. Goodale, Jr.

By 1964, breadboard models were working in the lab. During 1964-65 these were refined and packaged to test around the Bell Labs Holmdel N.J. facilities. The system operated under an experimental license on crystal controlled channels in the 35 and 43 MHz bands using FM, a low power transmitter and a sensitive &quot;superhet&quot; receiver. Full supervision of all telephone functions, including on-off hook and dialing was provided via an out of band tone supervision system. The model developed for home use was designed to look like a standard (although bulky) telephone handset. The base station was a small box connected to a standard telephone network. About 50 units were built in a Western Electric model shop in Andover Mass. for field trials in two Bell System locations in the Boston and Phoenix area. The overall project was described in the Bell Laboratories Record, Volume 45 (1967).

In 1966, George Sweigert submitted a patent application for a &quot;full duplex wireless communications apparatus&quot;. He was awarded in June 1969. Sweigert, a radio operator in World War II stationed at the South Pacific Islands of Guadalcanal and Bougainville, developed the full duplex concept for untrained personnel, to improve battlefield communications for senior commanders.

Sweigert was an active proponent for directly coupling consumer electronics to the AT&amp;T-owned telephone lines in the late 1960s. The telephone companies at the time did not permit third-party equipment to be connected to their lines; most telephones were made by Western Electric and leased to the customer by AT&amp;T. The Carterfone coupler, a crude device for interconnecting a two-way radio with the telephone, led to the reversal of the Federal Communications Commission ban on direct coupling of consumer equipment to phone lines (known as the landmark Carterfone decision) on June 26, 1968. The original cordless phones, like the Carterfone, were acoustically (not electrically) connected to the public telephone network.

In 1977, Douglas G. Talley and L Duane Gregory were granted for a duplex voice communication link including controls provided between a base station connected directly to a telephone line of a telephone exchange and a mobile unit consisting of a small, compact cordless telephone instrument containing transmitter, receiver and control circuits powered by a rechargeable battery pack. A single logic tone is transmitted and detected for all logical control for ring signals, on-hook and off-hook signals and dial pulses.

Cordless phones became widely used in home and workplaces during the early 1980s. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the number of cordless phones sold in the United States grew from 50,000 in 1980 to 1 million in 1982. They quickly became popular because of their convenience and portability, despite fears that their reliance on radio signals would make them vulnerable to eavesdropping or other malfeasance.

In 1994, digital cordless phones in the 900 MHz frequency range became available to consumers. These new types of phones provided better audio quality because it could filter out interference and its signals could penetrate walls more easily. Digital signals allowed the phones to be more secure and decreased eavesdropping; it was relatively easy to eavesdrop on analog cordless phone conversations. In 1995 digital spread spectrum (DSS) was introduced for cordless phones. This technology enabled the spreading of the digital voice transmission over multiple frequencies, improving privacy and reducing interference between different subscribers.

== Frequencies ==
=== United States ===
In the United States, seven frequency bands have been allocated by the Federal Communications Commission for uses that include cordless phones. These are:
* 1.7 MHz (1.665–1.770 MHz, narrow-band FM) Cordless phones manufactured after October 1, 1984, are not allowed to use this band and were required to use the newer (higher) 43-50 MHz frequencies, although older telephones, on the older frequency pairs, could still be used.
* 27 MHz, near the Citizens Band (CB) Radio service with some frequencies being 26.010, 26.050, 26.380, 26.419 and 27.095 MHz. These were initially paired with the 1.7 MHz frequencies, then, later, with the 49 MHz frequencies. Signals were FM - frequency modulation. 
* 43–50 MHz (Base: 43.72–46.97 MHz, Handset: 48.76–49.99 MHz, FM) Allocated in December 1983, and approved for use in mid-1984 for 10 channels. 15 additional channels allocated April 5, 1995.
* 900 MHz (902–928 MHz, allocated in 1993) 
* 1.9 GHz (1920–1930 MHz, developed in 1993 and allocated in October 2005, especially with DECT 6.0) 
* 2.4 GHz (2400–2500 MHz, allocated in 1998) 
* 5.8 GHz (5725–5875 MHz, allocated in 2003 due to crowding on the 2.4 GHz band) 

Over-crowding of earlier frequency allocations led users to discontinue using telephone equipment that operated on those frequencies, leaving those bands relatively clear. Radio hobbyists monitor usage of the older equipment with telephone activity in the US AM broadcast band, some 27 MHz frequencies and most older 43-50 MHz frequencies.

1.7 MHz cordless phones were the earliest models available at retailers, and are generally identifiable by their large metal telescoping antennas. Channels just above the AM broadcast band were selected manually by the user. Some of the frequencies used are now part of the expanded AM radio band, and can be heard by anyone with an AM radio. There are reports of people still using these phones, and using them as makeshift AM radio stations that can be heard for a couple of city blocks. These models became obsolete because they are susceptible to eavesdropping, and interference from fluorescent lighting and automobile ignition systems. However, under ideal conditions they could have or more range.

43–50 MHz cordless phones had a large installed base by the early 1990s, and featured shorter flexible antennas and automatic channel selection. Due to their popularity, an overcrowding of the band led to an allocation of additional frequencies; thus manufacturers were able to sell models with 25 channels instead of just 10 channels. Although less susceptible to interference than previous AM units, these models are no longer in production and are considered obsolete because their frequencies are easily heard on practically any radio scanner. Advanced models began to use voice inversion as a basic form of scrambling to help limit unauthorized eavesdropping. These phones share the 49.8 MHz band (49.830 - 49.890) with some wireless baby monitors.

900 MHz cordless phones are rarely sold but have a huge installed base. Features include even shorter antennas, up to 30 auto selecting channels, and higher resistance to interference. Available in several varieties; analog, analog spread spectrum (100 kHz bandwidth), digital, and digital spread spectrum, most being sold today are low-cost analog models, which are still susceptible to eavesdropping. Digital variants can still be scanned, but are received as a digital hiss and therefore are difficult to eavesdrop upon. Digital transmission is immune to static interference but can experience signal fade (brief silence) as the phone goes out of range of the base. Newer Digital Spread Spectrum (DSS) variants spread their signal over a range of frequencies, providing more resistance to signal fade. This technology enabled the digital information to spread in pieces among several frequencies between the receiver and the base, thereby making it almost impossible to eavesdrop on the cordless conversation. The FCC only allows DSS model phones to transmit at the full power of 1 watt, which allows increased range over older analog and digital models.

Virtually all new cordless phones sold in the US use DECT 6.0 on the 1.9 GHz band, though legacy phones can remain in use on the older 900 MHz, 2.4 GHz and 5.8 GHz bands. There is no specific requirement for any particular transmission mode on the older bands, but in practice many legacy phones also have digital features such as DSSS and FHSS.

Some cordless phones formerly advertised as 5.8 GHz actually transmit from base to phone on 5.8 GHz and transmit from phone to base on 2.4 GHz or 900 MHz, to conserve battery life.

The 1.9 GHz band is used by the DECT 6.0 phone standard and is considered more secure than the other shared frequencies. The vast majority of new cordless phone devices sold in North America, whether connected by landline or to mobile phones (usually via Bluetooth), now use DECT 6.0. However, DECT 6.0&#x27;s late start compared to DECT elsewhere has led to a large installed base of legacy cordless phones using other frequencies, many of which remain in use today despite increasingly common interference with the ever growing use of Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and other unlicensed digital radio standards, especially at 2.4 GHz and 5.8 GHz.

=== Outside the United States ===
In Europe, the 1.9 GHz (1880–1900 MHz) band was set aside for the DECT phone standard from its inception. DECT, on its European band &amp; related frequencies, has largely displaced all other cordless phone standards worldwide except for North America.

== Performance ==
Many cordless phones in the 21st century are digital. Digital technology has helped provide clear sound and limit casual eavesdropping. Many cordless phones have one main base station and can add up to three or four additional bases. This allows for multiple voice channels that allow three-way conference calls between the bases. This technology also allows multiple handsets to be used at the same time, and up to two handsets can have separate conversations with outside parties.

Manufacturers usually advertise that their higher frequency systems improve audio quality and range. In the ideal case, higher frequencies actually have worse signal propagation as shown by the basic Friis transmission equation, and path loss tends to increase at higher frequencies as well. Practical influences on quality and range are signal strength, antenna quality, the method of modulation used, and interference, which varies locally.

&quot;Plain old telephone service&quot; (POTS) landlines are designed to transfer audio with a quality that is just adequate for the parties to understand each other. Typical bandwidth is 3.6 kHz; only a fraction of the frequencies that humans can hear, but enough to make the voice intelligible. No phone handset can improve on this quality, as it is a limitation of the phone system itself. Higher-quality phones can transfer this signal to the handset with less interference over a greater range, however. Most cordless telephones, no matter what frequency band or transmission method is used, will hardly ever exactly match the sound quality of a high-quality wired telephone attached to a good telephone line. This limitation is caused by a number of issues, including the following:

* Sidetone: hearing one&#x27;s own voice echoed in the receiver speaker
* A noticeable amount of constant background noise (this is not interference from outside sources, but noise within the cordless telephone system)
* Frequency response not being the full frequency response available in a wired landline telephone

Most manufacturers claim a range of about for their 2.4 GHz and 5.8 GHz systems, but inexpensive models often fall short of this claim.

However, the higher frequency often brings advantages. The 900 MHz and 2.4 GHz band are increasingly being used for a host of other devices, including baby monitor, microwave oven, Bluetooth, and wireless LAN; thus, it is likely that a cordless phone will suffer interference from signals broadcast by those devices, and also may itself generate interference. It is also possible for a cordless phone to interfere with the 802.11a wireless standard, as the 802.11a standard can be configured to operate in the 5.8 GHz range. However, this can easily be fixed by reconfiguring the wireless LAN device to work in the 5.180 GHz to 5.320 GHz band.

The newer 1.9 GHz band is reserved for use by phones that use the DECT standard, which should avoid interference issues in the unlicensed 900 MHz, 2.4 GHz, and 5.8 GHz bands.

== Security ==
Many analog phone signals are easily picked up by radio scanners, allowing anyone within range to listen in on conversations (though this is illegal in many countries). Though many such analog models are still produced, modern digital technology is available to reduce the risk of eavesdropping. Digital Spread Spectrum (DSS) typically uses frequency hopping to spread the audio signal (with a 3 kHz bandwidth) over a much wider range of frequencies in a pseudorandom way. Spreading the signal out over a wider bandwidth is a form of redundancy, and increases the signal-to-noise ratio, yielding longer range and less susceptibility to interference. Higher frequency bands provide more room for these wide-bandwidth signals.

To an analog receiver like a scanner, a DSS signal sounds like bursts of noise. Only the base unit using a matching pseudorandom number can decode the signal, and it chooses from one of thousands of such unique codes each time the handset is returned to the cradle. Additionally, the digital nature of the signal increases its tolerance to noise, and some systems even encrypt the digital signal for additional security.

== Cordless phone handsets ==

Roaming cordless phone handsets exist which are not tethered to any particular base station, but which also do not use traditional mobile (cellular) phone networks. These most commonly use digital technologies like DECT, 2.4 GHz unlicensed spectrum, or 802.11a/b/g standards-based wireless LAN technology. Analog equivalents do exist and can provide longer reach, but with potential loss of confidentiality and voice quality. The cordless phone handset connects to a wireless access point or base station that supports the same technology. A Voice over IP service can be used by phones that use wireless data access points, thus using a broadband Internet connection to defer the connection to the PSTN to a remote gateway operated by the service provider.

==Health and safety==
Unlike wired telephones that are powered from the telephone company&#x27;s central station batteries, a cordless phone base station required electrical power to operate. During a power interruption, the cordless base station will not be operable, while wired sets may continue to operate.

<doc id="785032" wikidata="Q2341532" url="?curid=785032" title="Wallingford, Seattle">
<text>Wallingford is a neighborhood in north central Seattle, lying on a hill above the north shore of Lake Union about four miles from the downtown core. The neighborhood developed quickly during the early 20th century after the establishment of the University of Washington to the east. With trolley tracks laid through the neighborhood as early as 1907, Wallingford is a classic streetcar suburb, typified by its many 1920s era box houses and bungalows. Commercial development is primarily concentrated along North 45th Street where a number of iconic structures stand including the neon &quot;WALLINGFORD&quot; sign, the Wallingford Center, and the original Dick&#x27;s Drive-In. With its central location, numerous public amenities, including the Gas Works Park, and views of both the Olympic and Cascade mountains, Wallingford has long been home to many middle and upper-class families. While Wallingford is mostly residential in nature, the neighborhood&#x27;s southern edge, along Lake Union, has historically been an industrial and commercial business strip. In recent years, numerous office buildings have been developed as an extension of the burgeoning business center in neighboring Fremont. In 2014 Brooks Sports moved its headquarters from Bothell to a new six-story office building at the southwestern edge of Wallingford.

==Boundaries==
Like all Seattle neighborhoods, there are no official boundaries for Wallingford. Geographically speaking, the neighborhood is primarily defined by the sloping ridge that runs north from the edge of Lake Union to 45th Street, with the ridge line approximately following Wallingford Avenue. Generally the boundaries are considered as Aurora Avenue to the west, Interstate 5 to the east, Lake Union to the south, and 50th Street to the north; however the western and northern boundaries are often debated. The Seattle City Clerk defines the area south of 45th Street and west of Stone Way as part of Fremont. A number of businesses in this southwestern section, particularly those south of 40th street, use the Fremont moniker in their names, such as the Fremont Collective at Stone Way and 35th Street and the Fremont Brewing Company at 34th Street and Woodland Park Avenue. The 1998 Neighborhood Plan defined the northern edge of the neighborhood as 60th Street, however the area north of 50th street is sometimes associated with Green Lake and sometimes considered part of the distinct neighborhood of Tangletown/Meridian, a northern part of Wallingford.

The cultural center of the neighborhood is frequently considered the intersection of 45th street and Wallingford Avenue. The QFC grocery store on the north side of this intersection has a large, neon &quot;WALLINGFORD&quot; sign made up in part from letters in the old &quot;FOOD GIANT&quot; sign which adorned QFC&#x27;s predecessor for decades. On the southeastern corner of this intersection is the Wallingford Center, a 53,000 square foot elementary school built in 1904 that has been renovated and converted into two floors of shopping and dining establishments with 24 studio apartments above.


==History==
John Noble Wallingford Jr. (1833–1913) was a major local landowner and real estate speculator; at one time his holdings included most of what is now Wallingford and extended north as far as Green Lake. He traveled often up and down the West Coast of the United States and lived for a time in Alaska.

==Neighborhood character==

Wallingford&#x27;s business district extends along N 45th Street from Stone Way N in the west to Sunnyside Avenue N in the east and features the QFC grocery store, many small shops, three banks, three pharmacies, a few taverns and bars, the Wallingford Center (the former Interlake Elementary School, now turned into shops and apartments), and numerous restaurants (including the original Dick&#x27;s Drive-In, founded 1954).

===Notable structures and places===

Public spaces include Gas Works Park, Meridian Playground, Wallingford Center shopping mall, Wallingford branch of Seattle Public Library and Wallingford playfield. Gas Works Park on Lake Union borders the Burke-Gilman Trail and provides a panoramic extension into Lake Union, with a playground in planning as part of the 2009 parks levy. The nearby North Transfer Station, a waste sorting center, was rebuilt in 2016 and includes a small park and playground.

Meridian Playground features a former Roman Catholic home for wayward girls called the Good Shepherd Center, now a shared community space run by Historic Seattle. Major tenants include Tilth Alliance, Meridian School, the Wallingford Senior Center, and the Chapel performance space which features the Wayward Music Series. Wallingford playfield borders recently renovated Hamilton International Middle School and features views and a wading pool open in summer months. To the north lies Lower Woodland Park, which features athletic fields, a skate park, tennis courts, and connections to the Woodland Park Zoo and Green Lake. The University of Wallingford began in 1984, to provide religious training and Social Gospel Care to the neighborhood. It is located in the Seattle First Church of the Nazarene, behind Dick&#x27;s on 45th.

Wallingford is home to several community organizations. The Wallingford Neighborhood Office, located behind the CVS helps organize local events. The Wallingford Community Council meets the first Wednesday every month in the Good Shepherd Center and engages the community with government organizations. Sustainable Wallingford is a residents group dedicated to sustainable living. Tilth Alliance runs the public gardens and plant sales at the Good Shepherd Center. Solid Ground (formerly The Fremont Public Association) is colocated with the Wallingford Branch of the Seattle Public Library and runs a food bank and family support services. The Wallingford Boys and Girls club provides a safe, social space for kids and teens along 45th, while the Wallingford Senior Center provides a safe social space for older folks. Wallingford Toastmasters is for adults of all ages and meets periodically at the Wallingford Senior Center.

Just south of N 45th is Lincoln High School. The school was re-established as a comprehensive high school in the fall of 2019 after being closed in 1981 and comprehensively renovated in 2017–2019. During the years when the high school was not operating, the school buildings were used house public schools &quot;in exile&quot; while their own buildings undergo major renovations the and also as the North Seattle site for Cascadia Elementary, a selective public school.

Several major motion pictures have featured scenes filmed in Wallingford, including &quot;Cinderella Liberty&quot;, &quot;Scorchy&quot;, &quot;Harry and the Hendersons&quot;, &quot;World&#x27;s Greatest Dad&quot;, &quot;Singles&quot;, &quot;Say Anything...&quot;, &quot;American Heart&quot;, &quot;Class of 1999&quot;, &quot;10 Things I Hate About You&quot;, and &quot;Three Fugitives&quot;.

The Wallingford–Meridian Streetcar Historic District was designated by the National Register of Historic Places on December 9, 2022, to recognize the neighborhood&#x27;s streetcar suburb origins. The designation covers the area between Northeast 46th Street to the south, Interlake Avenue North to the west, North 50th Street to the north, and 5th Avenue Northeast to the east, which has 570 single-family homes and 66 multifamily buildings. The designation was criticized as an attempt to prevent further density in the neighborhood and preserve single-family zoning, while proponents favored protection of aesthetic and architectural features.

==Demographics==
While the neighborhood does not have official boundaries, the area roughly corresponds to the King County Census Tracts 50, 51, and 54. While portions of Census Tract 52 would generally be considered part of Wallingford, it is not included in the demographic estimates below.

As of the 2010 U.S. Census there were roughly 12,210 people living in the neighborhood. The population density was , roughly 47% denser than the average density of Seattle.

The racial makeup of the neighborhood was 84.3% White, 2.2% African American, 0.4% Native American, 7.2% Asian, 0.1% Pacific Islander, 0.9% from other races, and 4.8% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 4.6% of the population. The neighborhood&#x27;s non-white population of 15.7% is roughly half that of Seattle as a whole.

According to the 2013 American Community Survey, 40% of neighborhood units are single family homes, with the other 60% made up of apartments, condos, and townhomes. Roughly 45.4% of units were owner-occupied, compared to 54.6% managed as rental properties. 45.9% of the housing structures were built prior to 1939.

Wallingford is a relatively prosperous community. The median income for a household in 2013 was $76,909, compared to $67,479 for the city as a whole. The median home price for Wallingford was $522,366 compared to $421,000 for the city as a whole. The unemployment rate for the neighborhood was 4.2% compared to around 5.9% for 2013 for the city as a whole.

==Events==

Major annual events in the neighborhood include the Wallingford Kiddie Parade as part of Seafair, the Wallingford Wurst Festival run by St Benedict&#x27;s Church, and the Family Fourth fireworks show at Gas Works Park. Smaller events include Seattle Tilth&#x27;s chicken coop tour and the Wallingford Neighborhood office&#x27;s garden and home tours.

<text>Vårdö is an island municipality of Åland, an autonomous territory of Finland.

The municipality has a population of () and covers an area of of which is water. The population density is of land.

The municipality is unilingually Swedish.

Two notable Finnish authors, Sally Salminen and Anni Blomqvist, were born in Vårdö. Blomqvist lived her whole life on the Vårdö island of Simskäla.

The word &quot;vårdö&quot; means &quot;the guardian island&quot;. On the highest mountain of Vårdö people used to light bonfires to warn the other islands of danger.

The old post route from Stockholm to Turku went through Vårdö, by road from Båthusviken to Hullvik on the main island, otherwise by water. The local citizens took care of the mail transport in any type of weather. The dangerous mail transport lasted for over 300 years (1638–1910). Many people drowned on these journeys and in the memory of them the municipality of Vårdö has erected a memorial on the seashore of Hullvik. Today the post route road is marked with milestones.

<text>Lavarand, also known as the Wall of Entropy, is a hardware random number generator designed by Silicon Graphics that worked by taking pictures of the patterns made by the floating material in lava lamps, extracting random data from the pictures alledgedly using the result to seed a pseudorandom number generator.

==Details==
Although the secondary part of the random number generation uses a pseudorandom number generator, the full process essentially qualifies as a &quot;true&quot; random number generator due to the random seed that is used. However, its applicability is limited by its low bandwidth.

It was covered under the now-expired , titled &quot;Method for seeding a pseudo-random number generator with a cryptographic hash of a digitization of a chaotic system.&quot; by Landon Curt Noll, Robert G. Mende, and Sanjeev Sisodiya.

From 1997 to 2001,
there was a website at lavarand.sgi.com demonstrating the technique. Landon Curt Noll, one of the process&#x27;s originators, went on to help develop LavaRnd, which does not use lava lamps. Despite the short life of lavarand.sgi.com, it is often cited as an example of an online random number source.

, Cloudflare alledgedly maintains a similar system of lava lamps for securing Internet traffic, which it also calls the &quot;Wall of Entropy&quot;.

<text>Theodoros Zagorakis ( ; born 27 October 1971) is a Greek politician and former professional footballer who played as a midfielder. He was the captain of the Greece team that won UEFA Euro 2004, and was also captain and later president of PAOK. He was named the Greek Male Athlete of the Year in 2004. 

He was elected as a Greek MEP at the May 2014 and May 2019 European Parliament Elections. He was also the president of the Hellenic Football Federation from March to September 2021.

==Club career==

===Kavala===

Zagorakis was a central midfielder who could also play on the right side of midfield. He started his career with Kavala in 1988, the club that also produced Zisis Vryzas, with whom he became close friends. He was an important part of helping the team get into the Beta Ethniki.

===PAOK===

In the 1992–93 season, Zagorakis left Kavala as a winter transfer to join PAOK, part of a string of star transfers made that season. He played for PAOK until December 1997, and also captained the squad in his last two seasons. He rarely missed a league derby and scored important goals, particularly in 1994–95 when he struck four, his best-ever tally.

===Leicester City===

Zagorakis left for English club Leicester City the following winter and signed for Martin O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s side in 1998. While in England, he took part in two consecutive League Cup finals at Wembley Stadium, losing the first against Tottenham Hotspur in 1999 and defeating Tranmere Rovers in the second, though he was an unused substitute in the latter. Zagorakis will always be fondly known by Leicester fans for his sheer determination in midfield and also his goalkeeping cameo against Crystal Palace, in a 3–3 draw, where he went in goal after Pegguy Arphexad and then Tim Flowers went off injured.

===AEK Athens===

Zagorakis was disappointed with Leicester manager Martin O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s reluctance to use him regularly and decided to return to Greece in 2000. He moved to AEK Athens, and played alongside fellow countrymen such as Michalis Kapsis, Vasilios Lakis, Demis Nikolaidis and Vasilios Tsiartas. He formed an excellent duo in midfield with both Akis Zikos and Kostas Katsouranis, helping with his game in the defensive part and also in the organization of the offense, where he also competed at times as a captain. A goal with AEK was against Inter Milan at Giuseppe Meazza with a great shot for the round of 16 of the UEFA Cup. With AEK, Zagorakis won the Greek Cup in 2002 against rivals Olympiacos. Zagorakis, during his last season in AEK, has accepted a reduced pay-off which is reported to be £220,000.&quot;He showed he genuinely has the club&#x27;s best interests at heart and is free to take up any of the great offers from teams abroad,&quot; said a club statement. In the summer of 2004, having the best moment of his career at the Euro in Portugal and with AEK in a difficult administrative situation, he left the team.

===Bologna===

On 14 July 2004, he left AEK Athens for Bologna, signing a two-year contract worth €1.5 million per year. Zagorakis–who was voted player of the tournament in Portugal–was released by AEK Athens and joined Bologna on a Bosman free transfer. &quot;Zagorakis is our Greek Baggio&quot;, Bologna owner Giuseppe Gazzoni Frascara told the newspaper. In 2004–05, Zagorakis was a regular feature in the squad, but the team found itself relegated to Serie B after a play-out series against Parma. In the following summer, he was released from the team as they couldn&#x27;t afford his payroll under the new conditions.

===Return to PAOK===

In 2005, Zagorakis arrived in Thessaloniki to sign a deal with PAOK. The midfielder was released by Bologna following the Italian team&#x27;s relegation from Serie A, and rejoined one of his old clubs. Zagorakis eventually signed a two-year contract with PAOK for €700,000 a year. When Zagorakis landed at Makedonia Airport in Thessaloniki, 7,000 supporters were there to welcome him back. His return however coincided with a turbulent period, with the club many financial and administrative problems. On 28 May 2007, after the fifth Greek Super League All-Star Game, Zagorakis announced his retirement from professional football.

==International career==

Zagorakis received his first cap for Greece on 7 September 1994, against the Faroe Islands. He scored his first goal against Denmark in 2006 World Cup qualifying, in Athens, while earning his 101st cap. Numbering 120 caps, Zagorakis was Greece&#x27;s all-time leader in international games played until 12 October 2012, when Giorgos Karagounis made his 121st appearance for the national team. He earned his 100th against Kazakhstan on 17 November 2004, and was the team&#x27;s longest-serving captain.

Zagorakis played an important role in Greece&#x27;s win in the 2004 European Championships, and was named the Player of the Tournament by UEFA and consequently he was in the Team of the Tournament. FIFA named Zagorakis as a contender for the 2004 FIFA World Player of the Year award (he finished in 17th place alongside Spain&#x27;s and Real Madrid&#x27;s legend, Raúl), as well as UEFA named him for the 2004 Ballon d&#x27;Or award (he finished in fifth place), behind the likes of Ronaldinho (third place) and Thierry Henry (fourth place). He holds the record of most consecutive matches (57) (except one in 2006 because of injury) of the national team (due to either injury or not selection) since his first cap in a period of 12 years.

After 12 full playing years as the captain for Greece, Zagorakis announced his retirement from international football on 5 October 2006. More specifically, Greece captain was considering retiring after his team&#x27;s European championship qualifier against Norway in Athens on 2 October 2006, has also been called up for the match against Bosnia four days later, officials said.
On 22 August 2007, however, he played for the last time with the national side, in a special friendly match against Spain in Toumba Stadium, Salonica. He played for about 15 minutes and was then replaced by Giannis Goumas, receiving an applause by fans singing his name.

==PAOK presidency==
Following his retirement as a footballer, after many widespread rumours, it was announced that he was to become PAOK&#x27;s new president, on 18 June 2007.

The club had been in dire financial straits for several years. Zagorakis undertook to sort out finances by attracting investors, increasing revenue and mobilising the club&#x27;s fan base. In his unifying first statement he said: &quot;The strength of PAOK lies in its supporters, its fans...I would have not made this decision&quot; (to retire from playing and assume administration) &quot;if i did not love my club. The situation for PAOK is very difficult and I will not try to hide its problems; instead I will do all I can to solve the pressing financial issues.&quot;

Soon he set about restructuring the club&#x27;s debt and team, and recruited former teammate Zisis Vryzas as technical director. As of late 2008, PAOK has been able to pay off most of its accumulated debt, seen a steady increase in ticket sales and advertising revenue, and team performance on the field has improved considerably, under the coaching of Portuguese manager Fernando Santos.

On 15 December 2008, Zagorakis announced a major issue of new stock by the club, valued at €22.3 million. He appealed to small investors and stated that, although it is unlikely that the entire sum could be covered in a worldwide crisis environment, he felt confident that the expected influx of capital would enable PAOK finally to put its past problems behind and focus on future growth.

On 8 October 2009, Zagorakis surprised fans and press alike by announcing his decision to quit the presidency. In a short announcement on the club&#x27;s official website, he cited that personal problems have led him to this decision. He was rapidly replaced by his close friend Zisis Vryzas.

Nevertheless, he kept close contact with his former associates, and also frequently attended the club&#x27;s home games alongside Vryzas. Zagorakis finally changed his mind and on 20 January he reprised his position as president, with Vryzas stepping down to assume the post of vice-president.

In January 2012 Zagorakis resigned as president after the sale of Vieirinha for financial reasons provoked a supporters&#x27; protest.

==Style of play==

Zagorakis was described by UEFA.com as a &quot;combative, industrious defensive midfielder with a powerful right-foot shot&quot;.

==Personal life==

Zagorakis was featured on the cover of the Greek edition of FIFA 2001.

==Political career==

Zagorakis is looking to kick-off a new career in politics by becoming a Member of the European Parliament (MEP). He was a New Democracy candidate for the European Parliament in the elections of 25 May 2014. He was elected as an MEP and became a member of the European People&#x27;s Party (Christian Democrats). He was unveiled as one of the party&#x27;s hopefuls by the Greek Prime Minister, Antonis Samaras. He was re-elected in the European Parliament in the elections of 2019.

In January 2020, a Committee of Professional Sports (with members placed by Sports Minister Lefteris Avgenakis) proposed the relegation of PAOK FC and Xanthi FC. Zagorakis stated that he could no longer be MEP for New Democracy after this. The party&#x27;s leader and PM Kyriakos Mitsotakis decided his deletion. Several MP&#x27;s said that Zagorakis was elected in European Parliament to represent Greece, not PAOK. Nevertheless, in 2021, Zagorakis returned to New Democracy and its group of MEPs.

In the 2024 European elections, he was announced as a candidate for PASOK, but he was not elected.

== President of Hellenic Football Federation ==

Theodoros Zagorakis served as the president of the Hellenic Football Federation (EPO). He was elected to the position in March 2021. He was supported by Greece&#x27;s major football clubs and was elected with an almost unanimous majority. He aimed to reform Greek football, which had faced serious corruption and governance challenges. However, his tenure as president was relatively short, as he resigned from the position in September 2021 due to disagreements and challenges related to the federation&#x27;s governance.

<text>Vähäkyrö () is a former municipality of Finland and an exclave of the city of Vaasa since January 1, 2013.

It was located in the province of Western Finland and is part of the Ostrobothnia region. The municipality had a population of 4,727 (31 December 2012) and covered an area of of which was water. The population density was . The municipality was unilingually Finnish.

== Merger with Vaasa ==

Vähäkyrö held a referendum about joining Vaasa in May 2012, with 49% of votes against the amalgamation and 48% for it - the no side won by a margin of 13 votes. However, a vote held by the municipal council passed the amalgamation, overturning the referendum with 18 yes and 9 no votes. The vote held in Vaasa was unanimous, thus sealing the amalgamation. The municipality officially ceased to exist on New Year&#x27;s Day 2013.

The amalgation of Vähäkyrö to Vaasa was historical in Finnish geography, because two municipalities without any common border merged for the first time, making Vähäkyrö an exclave of Vaasa and also the first exclave in the history of sovereign Finland. Worth noting is that even though the municipality of Säynätsalo was merged to Jyväskylä in 1993 and the two had no common border by land, Säynätsalo did not become an exclave because the municipalities shared a borderline of few hundred meters in the middle of Lake Päijänne.

<text>Värtsilä () is a former municipality of Finland. It merged with Tohmajärvi in 2005. It included the international border crossing between Niirala and Vyartsilya.

Värtsilä was located in the province of Eastern Finland and was part of the North Karelia region. The municipality had a population of 660 (2005) and covered an area of of which was water. The population density was .

The main language spoken in Värtsilä is Finnish but new settlers from Russia and people evacuated from the lost Karelian areas after the Second World War form Russian and Karelian speaking minorities.

In addition to the current village, Värtsilä used to include the urban settlement of Vyartsilya (), which since 1944 has belonged to Russia.

The biggest employers in the village include the Finnish Border Guard and Finnish Customs.

== 1679 uprising ==
In 1679, Nils Kagg sent his inspector Sven Stille to demand taxes from the peasants in Tohmajärvi that had not paid it, however, in Värtsilä, Sven was met with a mob of angry peasants, who threatened him and his family until he was forced to flee. After this, Swedish troops were called and were able quell the uprising. The amount of resistance that the peasants gave the troops is not known, and two of the leaders were executed.

<doc id="785061" wikidata="Q1501239" url="?curid=785061" title="Insulinoma">
<text>An insulinoma is a tumour of the pancreas that is derived from beta cells and secretes insulin. It is a rare form of a neuroendocrine tumour. Most insulinomas are benign in that they grow exclusively at their origin within the pancreas, but a minority metastasize. Insulinomas are one of the functional pancreatic neuroendocrine tumour (PNET) group (&quot;functional&quot; because it increases production of insulin). In the Medical Subject Headings classification, insulinoma is the only subtype of &quot;islet cell adenoma&quot;.

Beta cells secrete insulin in response to increases in blood glucose. The resulting increase in insulin acts to lower blood glucose back to normal levels, the point at which further secretion of insulin is stopped. In contrast, the secretion of insulin by insulinomas is rather independent of blood glucose; these tumours continue to secrete insulin, causing blood glucose levels to fall further below normal.

As a result, patients present symptoms of low blood glucose (hypoglycemia), which are improved by eating. The diagnosis of an insulinoma is usually made biochemically with low blood glucose, elevated insulin, proinsulin, and C-peptide levels, and confirmed by localizing the tumour with medical imaging or angiography. The definitive treatment is surgery.

==Signs and symptoms==
Patients with insulinomas usually develop neuroglycopenic symptoms. These include recurrent headache, lethargy, diplopia, altered mental status, and blurred vision, particularly with exercise or fasting. Severe hypoglycemia may result in seizures, coma, and permanent neurological damage. Neuroglycopenic symptoms are more prominent in insulinoma, however patients may also have symptoms resulting from the catecholaminergic response to hypoglycemia (i.e. tremulousness, palpitations, tachycardia, sweating, hunger, anxiety, nausea). Weight gain is sometimes seen, as patients may eat more frequently to manage symptoms. 

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis of insulinoma is suspected in a patient with symptomatic fasting hypoglycemia. The conditions of Whipple’s triad need to be met for the diagnosis of &quot;true hypoglycemia&quot; to be made:

# symptoms and signs of hypoglycemia,
# concomitant plasma glucose level of 45 mg/dL (2.5 mmol/L) or less, and
# reversibility of symptoms with administration of glucose.

===Blood tests===
These blood tests are needed to diagnose insulinoma:
* low glucose levels
* elevated insulin levels
* elevated C-peptide levels

If available, a proinsulin level might be useful, as well. Other blood tests may help rule out other conditions which can cause hypoglycemia.

===Suppression tests===
Normally, endogenous insulin production is suppressed in the setting of hypoglycemia. A 72-hour fast, usually supervised in a hospital setting, can be done to see if insulin levels fail to suppress, which is a strong indicator of the presence of endogenous hyperinsulinemia, of which the most common cause is insulinoma (followed by autoimmune causes). 

During the test, the patient may have calorie-free and caffeine-free liquids. Capillary blood glucose is measured every 4 hours using a reflectance meter, until values &lt; 60 mg/dL (3.3 mmol/L) are obtained. Then, the frequency of blood glucose measurement is increased to every hour until values are &lt; 49 mg/dL (2.7 mmol/L). At that point, or when the patient has symptoms of hypoglycemia, a blood test is drawn for serum glucose, insulin, proinsulin, and C-peptide levels. The fast is then stopped at that point, and the hypoglycemia is corrected with intravenous dextrose or carbohydrate-containing food or drink.

===Diagnostic imaging===
The insulinoma might be localized by noninvasive means, using ultrasound, CT scan, or MRI techniques. An indium-111 pentetreotide scan is more sensitive than ultrasound, CT, or MRI for detection of somatostatin receptor positive tumours, but not a good diagnostic tool for insulinomas. An endoscopic ultrasound has a sensitivity of 40-93% (depending on the location of the tumour) for detecting insulinomas.

Sometimes, angiography with percutaneous transhepatic pancreatic vein catheterization to sample the blood for insulin levels is required. Calcium can be injected into selected arteries to stimulate insulin release from various parts of the pancreas, which can be measured by sampling blood from their respective veins. The use of calcium stimulation improves the specificity of this test.During surgery to remove an insulinoma, an intraoperative ultrasound can sometimes localize the tumour, which helps guide the surgeon in the operation and has a higher sensitivity than noninvasive imaging tests.

==Treatment==

The definitive management is the surgical removal of the insulinoma. This may involve removing part of the pancreas, as well (Whipple procedure and distal pancreatectomy).
Medications such as diazoxide and somatostatin can be used to block the release of insulin for patients who are not surgical candidates or who otherwise have inoperable tumours.
Streptozotocin is used in islet cell carcinomas which produce excessive insulin. Combination chemotherapy is used, either doxorubicin and streptozotocin, or fluorouracil and streptozocin in patients where doxorubicin is contraindicated.
In metastasizing tumours with intrahepatic growth, hepatic arterial occlusion or embolization can be used.

==Prognosis==
Most patients with benign insulinomas can be cured with surgery. Persistent or recurrent hypoglycemia after surgery tends to occur in patients with multiple tumours. About 2% of patients develop diabetes mellitus after their surgery.

==Incidence==
Insulinomas are rare neuroendocrine tumours with an incidence estimated at one to four new cases per million persons per year. Insulinoma is one of the most common types of tumours arising from the islets of Langerhans cells (pancreatic endocrine tumours). Estimates of malignancy (metastases) range from 5 to 30%. Over 99% of insulinomas originate in the pancreas, with rare cases from ectopic pancreatic tissue. About 5% of cases are associated with tumours of the parathyroid glands and the pituitary (multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1) and are more likely to be multiple and malignant. Most insulinomas are small, less than 2 cm.

==History==
Hypoglycemia was first recognized in the 19th century. In the 1920s, after the discovery of insulin and its use in the treatment of diabetics, hyperinsulinism was suspected to be a cause of hypoglycemia in nondiabetics. A pioneering description of hyperinsulinism as a cause of hypoglycemia was published by Seale Harris in 1924. The first report of a surgical cure of hypoglycemia by removing an islet cell tumour was in 1929.

An insulinoma removed from a woman in Munich provided insulin mRNA that was used in the first human gene cloning experiment. In 1979, Axel Ulrich cloned this gene into &quot;E. coli&quot;. Most therapeutic insulin used today derives from this woman&#x27;s tumour.

The series follows Max, an adventurous teenage boy who receives in the mail a small statue of a fowl, inscribed with Egyptian hieroglyphs whereof the translation states: &quot;You have been chosen to be the cap-bearer. Go to the mini-mart and wait for a sign, Mighty Max&quot;. Shocked by the message, Max drops the statue, shattering it and revealing a red baseball cap emblazoned with a yellow &quot;M&quot;, which he dons. The cap is capable of projecting wormhole-like &quot;portals&quot; through which Max can teleport across space and time.

Upon arriving at the mini-mart, Max is chased by a lava-monster sent by antagonist &#x27;Skullmaster&#x27;. As Max flees, the cap teleports them to the Mongolian desert, where he befriends Virgil, a nearly omniscient Lemurian whose appearance is that of an anthropomorphic &quot;fowl&quot; (a running gag in the series is that Max refers to Virgil as a &quot;chicken&quot; to which the Lemurian replies &quot;Fowl, actually&quot;), who explains that Max&#x27;s reception of the cap was prophesied c. 3000 B.C. Thereafter Max, Virgil, and Norman, his Viking bodyguard, travel together around the world, defending Earth against the minions of Skullmaster, who is responsible for the downfall of the Lemurians. Norman is supposedly immortal and identified as or with Sir Lancelot, Thor, Samson, and Hercules. Most plot-driving episodes involve Skullmaster or one of his monstrous followers, but in many episodes, Max is required to stop an independent villain. While all episodes involve travel across Earth, one involves time travel, and the portal can even extend into the astral plane (as seen in the episode &quot;Souls of Talon&quot;).

While generally lighthearted and comical, the show&#x27;s violence and descriptions of violent acts were considered excessive by some viewers. Many episodes began with a depiction of the story&#x27;s principal monster killing a victim, whereas the series finale featured Max, Norman, and Virgil pitted against Skullmaster and their previously defeated foes. Both Norman and Virgil are killed, leaving Max to defeat Skullmaster. Unable to do so, Max uses the cap in order to time travel to the events of the first episode, creating a time paradox. At first, he experiences &quot;déjà vu&quot;, but after he reads Virgil&#x27;s modified letter, he recalls everything, and decides to use the knowledge he gained from the initial timeline to set it right in order to defeat Skullmaster once and for all.

===Educational epilogues===
In all episodes, a short ending scene preludes the credits, wherein Max is shown at his desk in his room, where he discusses with the audience some aspect of the episode in an educational way (similar to other children&#x27;s cartoon series, including &quot;The Magic School Bus&quot;), usually the location where the events took place, the type of monster that was fought, etc. Occasionally, Max is shown in another setting such as a library or museum, or is simply heard recorded on an answering machine (such as &quot;Armageddon Outta Here&quot;, the series finale), but these sequences were not broadcast on some channels, such as the British terrestrial airings on BBC1 (though included on the Nickelodeon airings). Generally, the educational messages at the end of each episode were of scientific, historical, or cultural significance (for example, the mythology of another culture; new astronomical theories of the time; the biology of a giant squid; or the fact that Native Americans were first believed to be Indians by European explorers).

In addition to the epilogue, facts are unobtrusively given in show, often by Virgil&#x27;s comment.

==Characters==
===Heroes===
* Max (voiced by Rob Paulsen) is the protagonist of the series: a rambunctious, clever, and blond teen empowered, through a series of adventures, to protect the signature cap that enables travel through various places. Max sometimes claims reluctance to retain this role, but Virgil and the cap leave him with little choice.
* Virgil/Narrator (voiced by Tony Jay) – Virgil, a fowl-like humanoid, is the last living Lemurian and Max&#x27;s mentor. He is over ten thousand years old, and knowledgeable of both past and future, but often frustrated by Max&#x27;s carefree ways (which include teasingly calling Virgil a &quot;chicken&quot;) and frequently reminded of having mentored Skullmaster, who consequently destroyed his people later on. Virgil would often send unusual messages to Max on where to go in order to get taken through a portal to meet up with him.
* Norman (voiced by Richard Moll as an adult, Jason Marsden as a child) is Max&#x27;s bodyguard who, after failing to prevent his father&#x27;s defeat, vowed to become the greatest warrior that ever lived (cf. &quot;Norman&#x27;s Conquest&quot;). After a lifetime of battle, Norman was appointed by Virgil to his current role. He earned his immortality by defeating the Conqueror, an undefeated champion, and swore to defend the Mighty One with his life if necessary (cf. &quot;Dawn of the Conqueror&quot;). As the Mighty One&#x27;s bodyguard, Norman is usually serious but, unlike Virgil, seems to enjoy Max&#x27;s carefree ways. Norman&#x27;s exploits through the ages were the basis of numerous legends, including those of Thor, Hercules, Samson, Lancelot, and Little John. Norman is shown throughout the series to be fearless, but not above disgust and has a fear of spiders. It is hinted in the final episode that he may have finally met his match in combat and died at the hands of an enormous spider. His common catchphrase is, &quot;I eat [X] for breakfast&quot;, usually naming his enemy. Another is the wry statement made upon meeting one of the many monsters they encounter, &quot;That is a big [X]&quot;. He and the title character&#x27;s names may be a reference to famed UK-based record producer Max Norman.

===Allies===
* Max&#x27;s Mother (voiced by Tress MacNeille) is a blonde archaeologist who works for the local museum. She often travels all over the world and usually leaves Max to his own devices. More than once Max has had to rescue her, but despite misgivings, she and Virgil often have historical discussions and she is one of the few people who can out-talk Virgil.
* Bea (voiced by Kath Soucie) is one of Max&#x27;s two best friends. Bea is an intelligent young girl who has assisted and sometimes rescued Max. Level-headed and cool under pressure, she often balances Max&#x27;s exuberance with a more intellectual approach.
* Felix (voiced by Corey Burton) is Max&#x27;s friend who takes Max&#x27;s new heroism in stride. Felix has assisted Max on numerous occasions, but usually gets left behind when the adventure starts, only to be relied upon thereafter.
* Thor is Max&#x27;s pet green iguana and loyal companion. During Max&#x27;s first encounter with antagonist Dr. Zygote, Thor was &quot;devolved&quot; into a dinosaur and ended up rescuing Max from Zygote&#x27;s &quot;Tyrannosaurus rex&quot;-like &quot;Mutosaurus&quot; (as seen in &quot;Zygote&#x27;s Rhythm&quot;). Later, Max &quot;devolved&quot; Thor back into his usual, pocket-sized self.

===Villains===
* Skullmaster (voiced by Tim Curry) is the main villain of the series and the nemesis of the Mighty One. Skullmaster is an ancient warrior/sorcerer whose lust for power has driven him to destroy the Lemurians. Afterwards, Skullmaster was imprisoned in the Underworld after the final battle with Max&#x27;s predecessor Maximus where he took command of the inhabitants there. During the second season, Skullmaster is freed to roam the Earth itself and seeks to control the universe.
** Warmonger (voiced by Frank Welker) is a demon and Skullmaster&#x27;s errand runner. Cruel and sadistic, he briefly showed ambition when he tried to kill Skullmaster in the episode &quot;I, Warmonger&quot;, but found himself ignorant of what to do with his newfound power and position. The death of Skullmaster proved to be a ruse and Skullmaster himself was proud of Warmonger for showing such deviousness and plans to reward him later.
** Double-Headed Dragon is a double-headed dragon that serve Skullmaster.
** Giant Crabs - a race of large crabs that serve Skullmaster.
** Rock Monsters – a race of rock monsters that serve Skullmaster.
** Skeleturtles – a race of skeletal turtles that serve Skullmaster.
* Lava Lord (voiced by Frank Welker) is the previous ruler of Underworld, dethroned and sealed in solid rock by Skullmaster. At the beginning of season 2, Lava Lord was freed and recovered the allegiance of the Lava Beasts. He planned to destroy Skullmaster with a giant robot called Magus. Though Lava Lord has no love for humans, his hatred for Skullmaster has caused him to align with Max on more than one occasion.
** Magus is a giant lava-powered robot working for Lava Lord who treated it like his own son.
** Lava Beasts are a race of creatures of molten rock that served Lava Lord until his defeat by Skullmaster. The Lava Beasts were later restored to Lava Lord.
* Cyberskull (voiced by Danny Goldman) – Marlin Curt is a programmer who merged with a computer virus and discovered that he can alter reality and become electricity. He plotted revenge on the founder of &quot;MegaCorp&quot; for stealing his ideas. Cyberskull later returned to create a physical body for himself.
* Professor Eggbert Zygote (voiced by Kenneth Mars) is a mad scientist with plans to manipulate evolution. In his first appearance in &quot;Zygote&#x27;s Rhythm&quot;, he developed a machine that devolved reptilian life to their dinosaur forms. Max unintentionally evolves him into a form with a large brain. Zygote escapes into the sea following the fight. In &quot;Zygote Music&quot;, Zygote has mastered the psychic abilities that came with his new form. He captures a telepathic boy whom he believes to be the key to human evolution. He is &quot;defeated&quot; when he evolves into a being of pure consciousness, losing interest in &quot;such primitive concepts as good and evil&quot;.
* Arachnoid (voiced by René Auberjonois) – Dr. Stanley Kirby is a scientist who was mutated into the half-spider Arachnoid.
* Talon (voiced by David Warner) is a giant skull-like entity that feeds on the souls of the living. He requires Mighty Max&#x27;s cap to escape from the astral plane into our dimension. In &quot;Armageddon Outta Here&quot;, Skullmaster uses Talon to carry a message to Max to show up at Stonehenge or else he will kill Virgil.
* Fuath is a gigantic clockwork stone golem that was created by a sect of druids to plan revenge on humanity. Max, Virgil, and Norman were able to defeat Fuath by taking out the crystal that powered it. In &quot;Armageddon Outta Here&quot;, Skullmaster summons Fuath to fight Lava Lord and Magus.

==Home release==
Select episodes of the show were released on VHS in NTSC and PAL formats.

==Merchandise==

The merchandising was far more popular than the show itself. Mighty Max toys were sold as play-sets of varying sizes with very small (usually non-articulated) figurines inside. Each play-set contained a Mighty Max figure as well as one or more villains and sometimes Virgil, Norman, or both. There were a small series of larger, more expensive play-sets with various mechanical and electronic features such as opening jaws (on an island play-set shaped as a dragon&#x27;s head) and lights. Almost all episodes of the TV series were based at least loosely on one of the Mighty Max play-sets.

In 1994, due to the popularity of the play-sets at the time, the McDonald&#x27;s Happy Meal offered a toy play-set featuring Mighty Max.

In 1994, a video game, &quot;The Adventures of Mighty Max&quot;, was released for the SNES and Sega Genesis/Mega Drive (which were packaged with a VHS copy of &quot;Day of the Cyclops&quot; and &quot;Let Sleeping Dragons Lie&quot;, respectively). A handheld game was also released by Tiger Electronics and Systema.

The show generated other merchandise such as a comic book (10 issues), a sticker album, at least one puzzle, and board games. In some countries, replicas of Max&#x27;s cap were sold, although not all are officially licensed merchandise.

<doc id="785151" wikidata="Q3033276" url="?curid=785151" title="The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis">
<text>The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis (also known as simply Dobie Gillis or Max Shulman&#x27;s Dobie Gillis in later seasons and in syndication) is an American sitcom starring Dwayne Hickman that aired on CBS from September 29, 1959, to June 5, 1963. The series was adapted from the &quot;Dobie Gillis&quot; short stories written by Max Shulman since 1945, and first collected in 1951 under the same title as the subsequent TV series, which drew directly on the stories in some scripts. Shulman also wrote a feature-film adaptation of his &quot;Dobie Gillis&quot; stories for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in 1953, titled &quot;The Affairs of Dobie Gillis&quot;, which featured Bobby Van in the title role.

Hickman in &quot;Dobie Gillis&quot; was among the first leads to play a teenager on an American television program. &quot;Dobie Gillis&quot; broke ground by depicting elements of the current counterculture, particularly the Beat Generation, primarily embodied in a stereotypical version of the &quot;beatnik,&quot; mainly in the character of Maynard G. Krebs, portrayed by actor Bob Denver, though a few others are shown. Series star Dwayne Hickman wrote in 1994 that &quot;Dobie&quot; represented &quot;the end of innocence of the 1950s before the oncoming 1960s revolution&quot;.

==Overview==
===Dobie Gillis and Maynard G. Krebs===

The series revolved around teenager Dobie Gillis (Dwayne Hickman), who aspired to have popularity, money, and the attention of beautiful and unattainable girls. He did not have any of these qualities in abundance, and the tiny crises surrounding Dobie&#x27;s lack of success made the story in each weekly episode. Also constantly in question, by Dobie and others, was Dobie&#x27;s future, as the boy proved to be a poor student and an aimless drifter.

His sidekick and best friend was American television&#x27;s first beatnik, Maynard G. Krebs (Bob Denver), who became the series&#x27; breakout character. An enthusiastic fan of jazz music (with a strong distaste for the music of Lawrence Welk), Maynard plays the piano and bongos, collects tinfoil and petrified frogs, and steers clear of romance, authority figures, and work (yelping &quot;Work?!&quot; every time he hears the word). Always speaking with the vernacular and slang of the beatniks and jazz musicians he admired, Maynard punctuates his sentences with the word &quot;like&quot; and has a tendency towards malapropisms. The main running gag on &quot;Dobie Gillis&quot; would have Dobie or one of the other characters rattling off a series of adjectives describing something undesirable or disgusting (&quot;I&#x27;d be a ragged, useless, dirty wreck!&quot;), at which point a previously unseen Maynard would appear (entering the scene in close-up), saying &quot;You rang?&quot;

&quot;Dobie Gillis&quot; is set in Central City, a fictitious city in the Midwestern United States (the original short stories are explicitly set in the Minneapolis–Saint Paul area). One of the show&#x27;s running gags is that Maynard is going downtown &quot;to watch them knock down the old Endicott Building&quot; (which is in Saint Paul, Minnesota). Another running gag is the reference, especially by Maynard, to a film called &quot;The Monster that Devoured Cleveland&quot; and its sequels, one of which always seems to be playing at the local cinema.

===Supporting characters===
Dobie&#x27;s often apoplectic father, Herbert T. Gillis (Frank Faylen), owned a grocery store and was only happy when Dobie was behind a broom. Dobie&#x27;s mother, Winifred (Florida Friebus), was a usually calm and serene woman who protected Dobie to the best of her ability and tended to baby him. Herbert Gillis, a proud, hard-working child of the Great Depression and World War II veteran, was often (during the first season of the show) heard to declare, in relation to Dobie, &quot;I gotta kill that boy, I just gotta!&quot; The Gillis family also originally included an older son, Davey Gillis (portrayed by Dwayne Hickman&#x27;s own older brother, Darryl Hickman), who made three appearances during the first season while home on break from college before being written out of the show.

Dobie&#x27;s two main antagonists were rich kids Milton Armitage (played by Warren Beatty), who appeared in five episodes, and after Beatty&#x27;s departure, Chatsworth Osborne Jr., Milton&#x27;s cousin (played by Steve Franken). Both characters represented the wealth and popularity to which Dobie aspired, but also served as romantic and competitive rivals for Dobie. Beatty&#x27;s Milton was taller, better looking, and more athletic than Chatsworth. Doris Packer played Clarissa Osborne, Chatsworth&#x27;s overbearing and snobbish mother, whom he affectedly referred to as &quot;mumsie.&quot;

Dobie was hopelessly attracted to the beautiful but greedy blonde Thalia Menninger (Tuesday Weld). Thalia was written out of the series after the first season and was succeeded by a seemingly endless stream of women for whom Dobie hankered. Weld returned as a slightly wiser Thalia for two guest appearances in seasons three and four.

Zelda Gilroy (Sheila James) was a brilliant and eager young girl, hopelessly in love with Dobie, much to his annoyance. Zelda did not find Dobie particularly attractive, but fell in love with him because she found him helpless and needing of her care, and also because of the concept of &quot;propinquity&quot; (or nearness; as Gillis and Gilroy, they were typically seated together in class). Despite his protests, Dobie was clearly fond of Zelda, and Zelda claimed Dobie loved her, but just had not realized it yet. To prove this, she would wrinkle her nose at Dobie, who would reflexively do the same back to Zelda and then protest &quot;now cut that out!&quot; Dobie and Zelda later appeared as a middle-aged married couple in the two spin-off &quot;Dobie Gillis&quot; reunion projects of the 1970s/1980s.

Leander Pomfritt (Herbert Anderson in the pilot, William Schallert thereafter) was Dobie&#x27;s English and science teacher at Central High School, and later, when Dobie went to S. Peter Pryor Junior College, Pomfritt (played by Schallert) was on the faculty there, as well. A stern educator fond of deadpan quips, Pomfritt referred to his pupils as &quot;my young barbarians&quot; or &quot;students (and I use that term loosely)&quot; and served as a father figure to both Dobie and Maynard.

===Format===

Most of the action for the first season-and-a-half of &quot;Dobie Gillis&quot; centered on the Gillis grocery store, Central High School, and the Central City park. The park scenes are used as the show&#x27;s framing device, with Dobie sitting on a park bench in front of a reproduction of Auguste Rodin&#x27;s statue &quot;The Thinker&quot;. Breaking the fourth wall, he would explain to the viewing audience his problem of the week, usually girls or money (in the earliest episodes, Dobie is seen emulating the trademark pose of &quot;The Thinker&quot; – head planted on fist in deep contemplation – before turning and acknowledging the camera).

The teen characters graduated from high school halfway through the second season, and Dobie and Maynard (along with Chatsworth) subsequently did a brief stint in the U.S. Army. Dobie continued to break the fourth wall and narrate the episodes, with the park set eschewed for an abstract set with the same reproduction of &quot;The Thinker&quot;.

At the start of the third season, Dobie and Maynard received their Army discharges, after which they, Zelda, and Chatsworth enroll in S. Peter Pryor Junior College, where Mr. Pomfritt was now a professor after having resigned from his position at Central High. Dobie&#x27;s science and history teacher at the college was Dr. Imogene Burkhart (Jean Byron, whose real name was used for that of the character). In season four, Dobie&#x27;s teenaged cousin Duncan &quot;Dunky&quot; Gillis (Bobby Diamond) moves in with the Gillises, and becomes something of a tag-along for Dobie and Maynard. The fourth-season episodes tended more towards surreal plots and situations featuring Maynard as the central character rather than Dobie.

==Cast==
===Main===
*Dwayne Hickman as Dobie Gillis is a clean-cut teenager (later young adult) and unremarkable student whose young heart finds poetry and literature resonant. He aspires to have dates with all of the beautiful girls he pursues, despite the pressures of home life, high school, and later the military and college. Dobie also serves as the series narrator, relating his observations to the audience from in front of a statue of Rodin&#x27;s &quot;The Thinker&quot;.
*Frank Faylen as Herbert T. Gillis, Dobie&#x27;s old-fashioned, short-tempered, and gruff father, who runs a small independent grocery store.
*Florida Friebus as Winifred &quot;Winnie&quot; Gillis is Dobie&#x27;s doting mother, who tends to baby her son and critique her husband&#x27;s parenting skills.
*Bob Denver as Maynard G. Krebs is Dobie&#x27;s lazy and somewhat goofy best friend. Maynard is a would-be beatnik who shuns romance, authority figures, and work. Like Dobie does later, Maynard briefly joins the Army in season two between his high-school graduation and enrollment in college.

===Semiregulars===
*Tuesday Weld as Thalia Menninger (season one) is a beautiful high-school classmate of Dobie&#x27;s. Thalia is only willing to date Dobie when he has money or helps her in her schemes to make some for herself (with a father in poor health and a sister who married a layabout, Thalia sees it as her duty to bring some money into the family; she acknowledges that were this not a factor, she would date Dobie). Weld departed the series after the first season, later returning to make two guest appearances, as a somewhat chastened Thalia, once in season three and once in season four.
*Warren Beatty as Milton Armitage (season one) is a rich jock at Dobie&#x27;s high school and a rival of Dobie&#x27;s for Thalia&#x27;s affections. Beatty quit the series midway through the first season.
*Sheila James as Zelda Gilroy is the smartest girl in Dobie&#x27;s high school and college. Zelda is in love with the uninterested Dobie and schemes ways to get him to date and marry her.
*Steve Franken as Chatsworth Osborne, Jr., is a spoiled rich boy and a classmate of Dobie&#x27;s in high school and college. Chatsworth assumed the role left vacant by the departure of Milton from the series. Like Dobie, Chatsworth also briefly joins the Army in season two between his high-school graduation and enrollment in college.
*William Schallert as Professor Leander Pomfritt is a dry-wit English and science teacher at Dobie&#x27;s high school and later one of Dobie&#x27;s college professors at S. Peter Pryor Junior College (seasons one-three). Herbert Anderson plays Mr. Pomfritt in the pilot episode.
*Jean Byron as Mrs. Ruth Adams is Dobie&#x27;s math teacher in high school (season one), and as Dr. Imogene Burkhart, is one of Dobie&#x27;s professors at S. Peter Pryor Junior College. (seasons three and four). One of the series&#x27; inside jokes was that Jean Byron&#x27;s birth name was Imogene Audette Burkhart.
*Doris Packer as Mrs. Clarice Armitage is Milton&#x27;s mother, a rich and eccentric socialite. She shifted to Mrs. Clarissa Osborne (Chatsworth Osborne, Jr.&#x27;s mother) when Franken replaced Beatty midway through season one. She has disdain for anyone outside her social class and considers all boys, including her own son, as &quot;nasty&quot;.

===Notable recurring roles===
*Darryl Hickman as Davey Gillis (season one) is Dobie&#x27;s older brother, a college student no more responsible and no less girl-crazy than Dobie. Davey was written out of the series after season one and Dobie is regarded as an only child thereafter.
*Michael J. Pollard as Jerome Krebs (season one) is Maynard&#x27;s cousin, also a beatnik. Jerome was intended as a replacement for Maynard when Bob Denver was drafted in mid-1959, and was written out of the show after Denver failed his Army physical and returned to the series.
*Marjorie Bennett as Blossom Kenney (seasons one and two) is a frequent and persnickety customer of the Gillises&#x27; grocery store.
*Tommy Farrell as Riff Ryan (seasons one and two) is a beatnik record-store and coffee-house proprietor who serves as something of a reluctant mentor for Maynard.
*Lynn Loring as Edwina &quot;Eddie&quot; Kegel (season three) is Chatsworth Osborne, Jr.&#x27;s beatnik cousin.
*Raymond Bailey as Dean McGruder (seasons three and four) is the head of S. Peter Pryor Junior College.

==Episodes==

==Production==

Max Shulman&#x27;s first Dobie Gillis short stories were printed in 1945, and a short-story compilation, &quot;The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis&quot;, was published in 1951. These stories were originally published in such magazines as &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; and &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot;.

A follow-up collection, &quot;I Was a Teen-age Dwarf&quot;, appeared in 1959. The titular character appeared at various ages in these stories, all of which are set in St. Paul, Minnesota, though the majority of the stories centered on his college years at the University of Minnesota. Aside from Dobie and his parents, Zelda Gilroy was the only other character from the books directly adapted to the series as a regular or recurring character.

Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer produced the first media adaptation of &quot;The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis&quot; in 1953 as &quot;The Affairs of Dobie Gillis&quot;, a black-and-white musical film starring Debbie Reynolds, Bob Fosse, and Bobby Van as Dobie Gillis. Following its release, Shulman set about attempting to bring &quot;Dobie Gillis&quot; to television. An initial pilot was produced by comedian and producer George Burns in 1957, with his son Ronnie Burns starring as Dobie.

After this pilot did not sell, Shulman took &quot;Dobie Gillis&quot; to 20th Century Fox Television, run at the time by Martin Manulis. Manulis asked Shulman to reduce the Dobie character&#x27;s age from 19 to 17, making him a high-school student instead of a college student and an age peer of Ricky Nelson from &quot;The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet&quot; and Wally Cleaver (Tony Dow) from &quot;Leave It to Beaver&quot;. Shulman agreed to the change after negotiating employment for himself on the series as show runner. The Fox pilot, &quot;Caper at the Bijou&quot;, featured Dwayne Hickman as Dobie, Frank Faylen and Florida Friebus as his parents, newcomer Bob Denver as a new character, Dobie&#x27;s beatnik best friend Maynard G. Krebs, and Tuesday Weld as Dobie&#x27;s unattainable love interest Thalia Menninger.

First pitched to and rejected by NBC, &quot;The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis&quot; was greenlit for series by CBS. Phillip Morris&#x27; Marlboro was the program&#x27;s primary sponsor, and it sold a week-to-week alternating co-sponsorship to Pillsbury Company for the first two seasons, with Dwayne Hickman appearing in one of the Pillsbury commercials. Colgate-Palmolive replaced Pillsbury as the alternate sponsor in season three.

While the pilot for &quot;The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis&quot; was shot at the main 20th Century Fox lot in Century City, California, principal photography and production for the series proper took place at the original Fox Film Corporation studio at the intersection of Sunset Boulevard and Western Avenue (next to the headquarters of DeLuxe) in Hollywood. &quot;Dobie Gillis&quot; was filmed with two cameras, a method that producer and director Rod Amateau had learned while working on &quot;The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show&quot;. Fox turned out one episode of &quot;Dobie Gillis&quot; a week, working from May to December of each year. Dwayne Hickman&#x27;s fourth wall-breaking monologues were saved for the end of the production of each episode; their length resulted in Hickman requesting and getting a teleprompter from which to read them for season two forward.

The show was not filmed before a live studio audience; during the first season, a live audience viewed each episode and provided its laugh track. Subsequent seasons used a standard laugh track provided by technician Charles Douglass.

Creator Max Shulman served as the show runner for and an uncredited producer of &quot;Dobie Gillis&quot;. He contributed scripts for episodes of the show during all four seasons, with several stories – including &quot;Love is a Science&quot; (season one, episode three), &quot;Love is a Fallacy&quot; (season one, episode 22), and &quot;Parlez-Vous English&quot; (season two, episode 11) – directly adapted by Shulman from his original Dobie Gillis short stories.

During its fourth season, the show, by then known as &quot;Max Shulman&#x27;s Dobie Gillis&quot;, suffered both from competition with NBC&#x27;s color Western &quot;The Virginian&quot; and from the growing inattention from Max Shulman. Shulman began spending increasing amounts of time at his home in Westport, Connecticut, while the show was in active production, ceding his role as show runner to associate producers Joel Kane and Guy Scarpitta. CBS decided not to renew &quot;Dobie Gillis&quot; after production had concluded on its fourth season.

The theme song &quot;Dobie&quot; accompanying the UPA-style animated titles was written by 20th Century-Fox musical director Lionel Newman, with lyrics by Shulman. The theme was sung by Judd Conlon&#x27;s Rhythmaires, with music conducted by Newman. Session singer Gloria Wood of the Rhythmaires provided the scat singing used as incidental score during the first two seasons.

===Series regular casting notes===
Dwayne Hickman, at the time the breakout star on &quot;The Bob Cummings Show&quot; (also known as &quot;Love That Bob&quot;) as nephew Chuck MacDonald, gained the part of Dobie Gillis over several other candidates, including Michael Landon. Despite being cast as a 17-year-old, Hickman was 24 when he starred in the pilot in the summer of 1958. Because Hickman had appeared for several years on &quot;Bob Cummings&quot; as Chuck, he was required by Shulman and CBS to bleach his dark brown hair blond for the role of Dobie to distance himself from that character in the public&#x27;s (and the sponsors&#x27;) minds. By the second season, however, Hickman was permitted to return to his natural hair color, after he had complained to the producers that the constant bleaching required to keep his low crew cut hairstyle blond was causing his scalp to break out.

Bob Denver, a 23-year-old grade-school teacher and postal worker with no previous professional acting experience, won the part of 18-year-old Maynard G. Krebs after his sister, a casting director&#x27;s secretary, added his name to a list of candidates auditioning for the role. Denver and Hickman had both attended Loyola University together several years earlier and were casually acquainted before &quot;Dobie Gillis&quot;. After filming the third episode of &quot;Dobie Gillis&quot;, Denver announced that he had received his draft notice. The character of Maynard enlisted in the Army and was given an elaborate sendoff in the show&#x27;s next episode, &quot;Maynard&#x27;s Farewell to the Troops&quot;. Stage actor Michael J. Pollard was brought out from New York to play Maynard&#x27;s cousin, Jerome Krebs, who was introduced at the end of &quot;Maynard&#x27;s Farewell to the Troops&quot; and was to assume Maynard&#x27;s role in future scripts.

Before Pollard had completed his first episode, &quot;The Sweet Singer of Central High&quot;, however, Denver returned and announced that he had been designated &quot;4F&quot; – unfit for service – during his physical because of a neck injury he had sustained some years earlier. After completing &quot;The Sweet Singer of Central High&quot;, Pollard was bought out of his contract – he had signed a &quot;play-or-pay&quot; contract and was paid for all 30 episodes in which he was to have appeared, while Denver was rehired. Maynard&#x27;s return was explained by stating that the Army had given Maynard a &quot;hardship discharge&quot; – the Army&#x27;s hardship, not Maynard&#x27;s.

Initially only a supporting character, Denver&#x27;s Maynard had graduated to co-lead by season two, as the character&#x27;s &quot;beatnik&quot; mannerisms and eccentricities made him a hit with the viewing audience. For a handful of episodes towards the end of season three, Maynard became the show&#x27;s lead character while Dwayne Hickman was hospitalized with and later recovering from pneumonia.

Despite Maynard&#x27;s increasing screen time, however, Denver – who had signed on as a Fox contract player without an agent – was unable to negotiate a raise in his $250 a week salary until season four. Denver was able to parlay his role on &quot;Dobie Gillis&quot; into lead roles on later television series, in particular the one for which he is best remembered, the 1964–67 CBS sitcom &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot;.

Established actors Frank Faylen, a longtime acquaintance of the Hickman family and a fellow parishioner at their church, and Florida Friebus were cast as Dobie&#x27;s parents, Herbert T. Gillis and Winifred Gillis. Faylen&#x27;s gruff, no-nonsense father character, which according to Hickman, was essentially the same as Faylen&#x27;s real-life personality, was more of an antagonist to Dobie during the first season of the show, his demeanor underscored by his often-repeated catchphrase &quot;I gotta kill that boy! I just gotta!&quot; Both CBS and Marlboro strongly disapproved of the catchphrase and the Herbert T. Gillis character&#x27;s hard edges. An early season-two episode, &quot;You Ain&#x27;t Nothin&#x27; But a Houn&#x27; Dog&quot; (episode two), in which Dobie inadvertently wins a father-and-son essay contest, was produced to explain why Herbert ceased use of his catchphrase. Herbert was further softened as the series wore on, the character&#x27;s anger tempered to frustration.

===Recurring casting notes===
Experienced child actress Tuesday Weld was cast as Dobie&#x27;s love interest in &quot;Caper at the Bijou&quot; and stayed on as a semiregular. Weld and Dwayne Hickman had previously appeared as a teenaged couple in the 1958 Fox feature film &quot;Rally &#x27;Round the Flag, Boys!&quot;, based on a Max Shulman novel, though produced without his input. Neither Hickman nor Weld was fond of the other, with Hickman later stating he felt Weld was not as dedicated as necessary to rehearsal and referring to her as &quot;a pain in the neck&quot;. Weld reportedly found Hickman pushy and out-of-touch. Aged 15 at the time of shooting the pilot, Weld had to legally spend much of her time on set in school with a tutor, and the production periodically ran into issues involving Weld&#x27;s later publicly known difficult home life.

Her work in &quot;Dobie Gillis&quot; and the feature film &quot;The Five Pennies&quot; made Weld a star, leading to substantial publicity. She departed the series after the first year to star in features, although she was persuaded by Max Shulman to return for two guest appearances, &quot;Birth of a Salesman&quot; (season three, episode 21) and &quot;What&#x27;s a Little Murder Between Friends?&quot; (season four, episode two).

Herbert Anderson was cast as Mr. Pomfritt, Dobie and Maynard&#x27;s English teacher at school. Anderson appeared in a lead role in the pilot for &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot;; when that show was picked up (also by CBS), he chose to stay with that cast, and actor William Schallert appeared in the recurring role of Mr. Pomfritt through the end of season three.

Warren Beatty was cast as Milton Armitage, a recurring rival of Dobie&#x27;s at his high school, during the first half of season one. Hickman later recalled that Beatty &quot;looked at me like I was a bug&quot; while on set. Beatty did remain friends with his brief co-star Michael J. Pollard. The two co-starred in &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot; eight years later. He quit the series in September 1959, midway through production of the first season after filming his fifth and final &quot;Dobie&quot; episode, &quot;The Smoke-Filled Room&quot;, to appear in &quot;A Loss of Roses&quot; on Broadway.

Former child actress Sheila James, who, playing daughter &quot;Jackie&quot; on &quot;The Stu Erwin Show&quot;, had worked with Dwayne Hickman on that series and &quot;The Bob Cummings Show&quot;, was cast without an audition as Zelda Gilroy, the tomboyish brainy girl who was in love with Dobie. Originally intended as a one-shot character for the episode &quot;Love is a Science&quot; (season one, episode three), Max Shulman liked both Zelda and Sheila James and had Zelda retained as a semiregular character. Signing a contract with &quot;Dobie Gillis&quot; necessitated James, then an 18-year-old college student, changing her major from theater to English, so Shulman could assist her with her studies on set.

After the third season of &quot;Dobie Gillis&quot;, Rod Amateau and Max Shulman produced a pilot for a &quot;Zelda&quot; spinoff starring Sheila James as Zelda Gilroy, with Joe Flynn and Jean Byron cast as her parents. However, CBS president James Aubrey lingered over moving forward with the &quot;Zelda&quot; series for a long time before firmly rejecting the series, with Amateau telling James in private that Aubrey had found &quot;Zelda&quot; (and by extension James, then a closeted lesbian) &quot;too butch&quot;. James&#x27; contract for the pilot and the resulting waiting period caused her to be absent from much of the fourth and final season of &quot;Dobie Gillis&quot;, though Amateau was able to hire her to return as Zelda for four episodes towards the end of the season. Acting roles became sparse for James by the late 1960s; she went into law and politics under her birth name of Sheila Kuehl, and later became the first openly gay person elected to the California State Legislature.

Steve Franken, a 28-year-old character actor, was cast immediately after Beatty&#x27;s departure as Chatsworth Osbourne, Jr., a replacement character for Milton Armitage. While both Milton and Chatsworth were rich rivals of Dobie Gillis&#x27;s (and both characters shared the same actress, Doris Packer, for a mother) and were, according to canon, cousins, where Beatty&#x27;s Milton was a menacing and athletic physical threat, Franken&#x27;s pompous, foppish Chatsworth tended to plot and scheme his way through competitions with Dobie, more often than not using his riches to get ahead. The Chatsworth character became popular enough that the producers had to consciously limit his appearances on the series to roughly one per month to prevent Franken from upstaging Hickman and Denver, but Franken stated both during and after &quot;Dobie Gillis&quot; that playing Chatsworth led him to be typecast and stifled his career.

Young actor Bobby Diamond was brought on at the beginning of season four as Dobie&#x27;s teenaged cousin, Duncan &quot;Dunky&quot; Gillis. By 1962, the 28-year-old Dwayne Hickman had begun to look too mature to carry the teenager-based plot lines, and instead Diamond&#x27;s &quot;Dunky&quot; was given this material, with the older yet immature Maynard as a running partner. The character was dropped midway through the fourth season, with attention shifting back to the characters of Dobie, Maynard, Chatsworth, and Zelda for the remaining episodes of the series.

Actresses who played Dobie&#x27;s love interests included Cheryl Holdridge, Michele Lee, Susan Watson, Marlo Thomas, Sally Kellerman, Ellen Burstyn (then billed as Ellen McRae), Barbara Babcock, Sherry Jackson, and Danielle De Metz. Yvonne Craig appeared in the opening credits and the closing sequence of the pilot film used to sell the series to CBS, but did not appear in the actual episode, &quot;Caper at The Bijou&quot;, when it was broadcast. She eventually played five different girlfriends on the show, more than any other actress.

Actress Sherry Alberoni, an original Mickey Mouse Club &quot;Mouseketeer&quot;, played one of Zelda Gilroy&#x27;s sisters in the 1960 episode &quot;Dobie Spreads a Rumor&quot;.

==Other media==
After the first season of &quot;The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis&quot; had aired, Capitol Records attempted to make a recording star out of Dwayne Hickman, ignoring the fact that Hickman, by his own admission, was not a singer. Recording engineers had to piece together numerous takes to get a usable vocal track from Hickman for each song. Hickman introduced several of the songs from the &quot;Dobie!&quot; album on the show during its second season, including &quot;I&#x27;m a Lover, Not a Fighter&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Send a Rabbit&quot;. Earlier, while Hickman was appearing on &quot;Love That Bob&quot;, he had recorded a single, &quot;School Dance&quot;, for ABC-Paramount Records, but both the single and the later Capitol album sold very few copies.

DC Comics published a &quot;Many Loves of Dobie Gillis&quot; comic book that ran for 26 issues from 1960 to 1964, featuring artwork by Bob Oksner. Stories from this comic-book series were later reprinted, with updates to the artwork and lettering to remove any references to &quot;Dobie Gillis&quot;, by DC as a short-lived series titled &quot;Windy and Willy&quot; in 1969.

==Sequel films==
The program spawned two 20th Century Fox-produced sequels, the pilot &quot;Whatever Happened to Dobie Gillis?&quot; (1977) and the TV movie &quot;Bring Me the Head of Dobie Gillis&quot; (1988). &quot;Whatever Happened to Dobie Gillis?&quot; was an unsuccessful pilot for a new weekly sitcom series, which was produced, directed, and developed by James Komack after creator Max Shulman was fired from the production. It was broadcast by CBS on May 10, 1977, as a one-shot special. In the pilot, Dobie had married Zelda and is helping his father Herbert run the Gillis Grocery when Maynard comes back to Central City from his world travels.

Depressed over turning 40 and not living the life he had dreamed of as a teenager, Dobie goes to his beloved &quot;Thinker&quot; statue and attempts to destroy it, landing in jail. The production starred Dwayne Hickman, Bob Denver, Sheila James, Frank Faylen, and Steven Paul as Dobie and Zelda&#x27;s teenaged son Georgie, who was a lot like Dobie had been at his age.

&quot;Bring Me the Head of Dobie Gillis&quot;, first aired as the &quot;CBS Sunday Movie&quot; on February 22, 1988, was directed and co-written by Stanley Z. Cherry after Dwayne Hickman, who was the film&#x27;s producer, was forced by the network to fire Max Shulman and Rod Amateau, with whom he had originally conceived the film. The plot features the married Dobie and Zelda running the Gillis Grocerynow also a pharmacyon their own, Dobie&#x27;s parents having died. Meanwhile, Thalia (played by Connie Stevens after Weld declined to reprise the role) returns to Central Citywith Maynard, whom she has rescued from a deserted island (a homage to &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot;)after 20 years. She offers a $50,000 bounty to anyone who will kill Dobie when he refuses to divorce Zelda and marry her. Hickman, Denver, and James returned for &quot;Bring Me the Head of Dobie Gillis&quot;, which featured Steve Franken as Chatsworth, William Schallert as Mr. Pomfritt, and Scott Grimes as son Georgie Gillis. Connie Stevens&#x27; daughter, Tricia Leigh Fisher, played Chatsworth&#x27;s daughter Chatsie, who chased Georgie Gillis with the same zeal Zelda had once used chasing Dobie.

==Home media==
On July 2, 2013, Shout! Factory released &quot;The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis – The Complete Series&quot; on DVD in Region 1. The set included all 147 episodes of the series, plus the original prenetwork version of the pilot and appearances by Dwayne Hickman and Bob Denver on other television programs of the time. &quot;Whatever Happened to Dobie Gillis?&quot; and &quot;Bring Me the Head of Dobie Gillis&quot; were not included, the latter due to music clearances, and the former because the master copy could not be located. The first season of the show was also made available on Amazon Prime Video on this date.

Shout! subsequently released each season individually, season one on September 10, 2013, season two on January 14, 2014, season three on May 6, 2014 and the fourth and final season on December 16, 2014.

In addition to the physical releases, all episodes of &quot;Dobie Gillis&quot; are also available on the streaming services Shout! Factory TV, Amazon Prime Video, Tubi, and Vudu.
==In popular culture==
&quot;The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis&quot; was a major influence on the characters for another successful CBS program, the Hanna-Barbera Saturday morning cartoon &quot;Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!&quot;, which ran on the network from 1969 to 1970 followed by several spin-offs. As confirmed by series creators Joe Ruby and Ken Spears and writer Mark Evanier, the four teenaged lead characters of &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; were based on four of the lead characters from &quot;Dobie Gillis&quot;: Fred Jones on Dobie, Daphne Blake on Thalia, Velma Dinkley on Zelda, and Shaggy Rogers on Maynard.

Garry Marshall said that he drew inspiration from &quot;Dobie Gillis&quot; when he created the ABC sitcom &quot;Happy Days&quot;.

Singer-songwriter Dobie Gray&#x27;s stage name served as a reference to the Dobie Gillis character.

<text>Aguas frescas () or frescos or aguas, are light non-alcoholic beverages made from one or more fruits, cereals, flowers, or seeds blended with sugar and water. They are popular in many Latin American countries, as well as parts of the United States such as the Southwest and heavy-Latino population cities, such as Los Angeles. Some of the more common varieties include , , and .

&quot;Aguas frescas&quot; are sold by street vendors and are commonly found in convenience stores, restaurants and juice bars.

==Terminology==
The terms &quot;aguas frescas&quot; is most common in Mexico, however, they are called &quot;fresco&quot; in Nicaragua and Honduras. Frescos refers to non-carbonated drinks, usually referring to traditional drinks, or those made from fruits. Some of them include fresco de Cacao, melon con naranja, chicha, pinolillo, and others. 

&quot;Aguas frescas&quot; could lead to confusion in some Spanish speaking countries, as they may refer to bottled soft drinks. In Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, and Panamá soft drinks are referred to as &quot;&quot;frescos&quot; (short for &quot;refresco&quot;), which in Mexico means soft drinks and in Nicaragua means aguas frescas. Soft drinks in Guatemala are called &quot;aguas&quot;&quot;, short for &quot;aguas gaseosas&quot;, which could easily be confused with the Mexican &quot;aguas frescas&quot; or Nicaraguan soft drinks which are called &quot;gaseosas&quot;.

<text>The Gdańsk University of Technology (Gdańsk Tech, formerly GUT; ) is a public research university in Gdańsk, Poland. Founded in 1904 and re-established in 1945, it is the oldest university of technology in modern-day Poland. It is consistently ranked among the leading universities in the country.

The university comprises eight academic faculties that provide higher education in 40 fields of study across 14 scientific disciplines. Its campus, located in the Wrzeszcz borough of Gdańsk, covers an area of . As of 2023, the university had 15,622 students, including 11,490 undergraduates, 3,644 postgraduates and 488 doctoral students.

The Gdańsk University of Technology has an international institutional accreditation, EUA-IEP (European University Association-Institutional Evaluation Programme).

== History ==
=== Beginnings under Emperor Wilhelm II (German Empire, 1899–1918) ===
On 16 March 1899, following a decision by Wilhelm II, deputies of the Kingdom of Prussia approved the establishment of a technical university in Gdańsk, then part of German Empire. was appointed as the chief designer of the university. Construction commenced in 1900 and was completed in four years. The university buildings were designed in the Northern Renaissance style with elements of Art Nouveau.

The ceremonial inauguration took place on 6 October 1904, when the institution was named the &quot;Royal Institute of Technology in Gdańsk&quot; (). In that same year, 189 students enrolled. By 1914, the number of regular students had grown to 675. The university remained operational during World War I.

=== Growth during the interwar period (Free City of Danzig, 1918–1933) ===
After the end of World War I, the university became part of the Free City of Danzig. In 1918, it was renamed the &quot;Technical University of the Free City of Danzig&quot; (). In agreement with the newly established Second Polish Republic, Free City authorities introduced a Polish language course and lectures on Polish economic geography, and provided the necessary textbooks and teaching aids to the Polish students. All foreign students, except Poles, were required to present a passport.

This period saw a considerable increase in the number of students: in the winter semester of 1922, their number reached 1,651; by 1929, it was 1,630; and in 1933, it was 1,548. While German students constituted the majority, there was a significant minority of Polish students, along with Ukrainian, Russian, Bulgarian, Yugoslav, Estonian, and Jewish students.

=== German Nazi takeover (Free City of Danzig, 1933–1939) ===
The takeover of power in the Free City of Danzig by the Nazis in 1933 resulted in the forced retirement of older professors and the dismissal or suspension of Jewish students. Nearly all student organizations were dissolved and replaced by the obligatory National Socialist German Students&#x27; League. In 1934, , a member of the NSDAP, was appointed as the rector of the university. By 1939, Pohlhausen had dismissed all Polish and Jewish students and staff.

=== World War II (Nazi Germany, 1939–1945) ===
At the outbreak of World War II, the city of Gdańsk had been annexed into the Nazi Germany. The university was subjected to Berlin authorities in 1941, resulting in the dismissal of the rector and the introduction of stricter regulations. The number of students and staff decreased significantly during the war, and by 1944, the university had been converted into a 3000-bed hospital, with much of its valuable equipment and documents evacuated to Germany.

=== Re-estabilishment after the war (Polish People&#x27;s Republic, 1945–1989) ===
In January 1945, as Gdańsk became part of Poland, preparations began for the Polish re-establishment of the university. By a decree on 24 May 1945, the university was transformed into a Polish state academic institution, and the first staff, mainly from Lviv and Warsaw universities, began work. Despite difficult conditions, learning commenced on 22 October 1945, with the official inauguration taking place on 9 April 1946. The re-establishment was supervised by , a Polish mathematician and former inmate of German Nazi concentration camps.

In the 1960s and 1970s, the university expanded, adding new buildings and increasing its student population. By the late 1980s, the university had grown to include several faculties and thousands of students, continuing its development and contribution to higher education in Poland.

=== Rise in modern times (Third Polish Republic, 1989–present) ===
The year 1989 marked an end of communism in Poland, with the creation of Solidarity on the Gdańsk coast playing a crucial role. Employees, students and graduates of Gdańsk University of Technology such as Andrzej Gwiazda were actively involved in these transformative events, leading to the establishment of the Republic of Poland as a democratic state with a market economy.

In response to the fall of communism in Poland, the Gdańsk University of Technology underwent significant organizational and infrastructural transformations between 1990 and 2010. Infrastructure expansions included new laboratories and facilities funded by the European Union, such as the Nanotechnology Center, the Pomerania Center of Advanced Technologies, and modern educational spaces, alongside the introduction of three-cycle degree studies (BSc, MSc, PhD), the European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System (ECTS), and a quality assurance system.

== Location ==
The Gdańsk University of Technology (Gdańsk Tech) is located in Gdańsk, situated at the mouth of the Vistula River on the Baltic Sea. The Main Campus is situated in the centre of old Wrzeszcz. The campus is located on Narutowicza Street. 

== Interior ==
The main building, designed by Hermann Eggertt and Albert Carsten, was built between 1900 and 1904. All the buildings were designed in the style of the Northern Renaissance with the elements of Art Nouveau. The images above the eastern side gate are a lighthouse and the tower of St. Mary&#x27;s Church. The ornamental gutters are decorated with copper spouts in the shape of four male figures holding water monsters. The Clock Tower destroyed in 1945 was restored to the roof of the main building on 13 May 2012. The tower is 18 meters in height. The main building encloses inner courtyards that were covered by glass domes.

In 2012, the South Courtyard was officially renamed in honour of Johannes Hevelius. It is named after the French physicist who first performed a similar experiment at the Paris Pantheon in 1851. The Foucault pendulum is designed to show the rotation of the Earth on its axis. An electromagnet fixed at the point of suspension powers the movement of the pendulum. Reliefs in the window niches above the Foucault pendulum show the design of a reflective sundial (on the left) and a rotating map of the sky with a sextant.

== Faculties ==
The university&#x27;s faculties are:
*Faculty of Architecture
*Faculty of Electronics, Telecommunications and Informatics
*Faculty of Electrical and Control Engineering

=== Chemical Faculty ===

The Chemical Faculty was one of the four original faculties of the university and one of five faculties that started operations research and teaching in 1945 as a result of the decree of the Polish government transforming technical universities acting in Gdańsk since 1904 into Polish Gdańsk University of Technology.

At the faculty, there are projects that were financed by the State Committee for Scientific Research and European Commission. At the faculty operates the &quot;Centre of Excellence in Environmental Analysis and Monitoring&quot;. There are also research programmes financed by the European Commission within the framework of EU programmes V and VI.

The &quot;Centre of Excellence in Environmental Analysis and Monitoring&quot; operates within the faculty. Additionally, there are research programs financed by the European Commission under the EU&#x27;s V and VI framework programmes.

== Academic Computer Centre ==
The Academic Computer Centre in Gdańsk (CI TASK) has been operating since 1992 due to an agreement reached between the Tri-City&#x27;s chief institutions of higher education. The initial plan was for it to primarily serve all schools of higher education as well as local branches of the Polish Academy of Sciences.

<doc id="785198" wikidata="Q4971429" url="?curid=785198" title="British prince">
<text>Prince of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is a royal title normally granted to sons and grandsons of reigning and past British monarchs, plus consorts of female monarchs (by letters patent). The title is granted by the reigning monarch, who is the fount of all honours, through the issuing of letters patent as an expression of the royal will.

Individuals holding the title of prince will usually also be granted the style of &quot;His Royal Highness&quot; (HRH). 

When a British prince marries, his wife becomes a British princess; however, she is addressed by the feminine version of the husband&#x27;s senior title on his behalf, either a princely title or a peerage. Traditionally, all wives of male members of the British royal family, the aristocracy, and members of the public take the style and title of their husbands. An example of this case is Princess Michael of Kent, the wife of the King&#x27;s first cousin once removed Prince Michael of Kent.

There is also the case when a princess of blood royal marries a British prince. She also becomes a princess by marriage and will be addressed in the same way. An example of this situation was the late Princess Alexandra, Duchess of Fife: when she married her mother&#x27;s cousin, Prince Arthur of Connaught, she became Princess Arthur of Connaught, Duchess of Fife.

If a British prince has a peerage, then the princess is addressed by the feminine version of her husband&#x27;s peer title; an example of this case is the wife of Prince William, who was (briefly) officially styled &quot;His Royal Highness The Duke of Cornwall and Cambridge&quot; while his wife Catherine became &quot;Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Cornwall and Cambridge&quot;, omitting both the &#x27;prince&#x27; and &#x27;princess&#x27; titles and their first names. When William was then created Prince of Wales, that became the senior title held in his own right, and he and Catherine are styled &quot;His/Her Royal Highness The Prince/Princess of Wales&quot;.

==History==
Before 1714, the title of prince and the style of &quot;HRH&quot; was not customary in usage. Sons and daughters of the sovereign were not automatically or traditionally called a prince or princess. An exception was the Prince of Wales, a title conferred on the eldest son of the sovereign since the reign of King Edward I of England. In the Kingdom of Scotland, even though an honorific principality was created by King James VI, the heir-apparent was only referred to as Duke of Rothesay. Some others include John, brother of King Richard I and later King John, who is sometimes called Prince John.

After the accession of King George I of Great Britain (the first monarch from the House of Hanover), it became customary for the sons of the sovereign and grandsons of the sovereign in the male line to be titled &#x27;Prince&#x27; and styled &quot;His Royal Highness&quot; (abbreviated &quot;HRH&quot;). Great-grandsons of the sovereign were princes styled &quot;His Highness&quot; (abbreviated &quot;HH&quot;).

* The first male-line great-grandchild of a British monarch was not born until 1776. In keeping with tradition, he was given the style of His Highness Prince William of Gloucester (later Prince William Frederick, Duke of Gloucester and Edinburgh). On 22 July 1816 when he married his cousin and daughter of King George III, he was granted the style His Royal Highness. His only surviving elder sister, Princess Sophia of Gloucester, was also elevated to Her Royal Highness style the following day. Prince William died in 1834 before the accession of Queen Victoria.
* The first of the second set of male-line great-grandchildren of a British monarch was born on 21 September 1845 as Prince Ernest Augustus. He was granted the style of &quot;His Royal Highness&quot; because he was a male-line grandson of the king of Hanover and heir to the heir of that kingdom.

Just three weeks after the birth of her fourth grandchild but first male-line grandson, Victoria issued letters patent in 1864 which formally confirmed the practice of calling children and male-line grandchildren &quot;His Royal Highness&quot; with their titular dignity of &quot;Prince&quot; or &quot;Princess&quot; prefixed to their respective Christian names. The letters patent did not address the styling of great-grandchildren or further descendants as &quot;His/Her Highness&quot; or &quot;Prince&quot; or &quot;Princess&quot;.

Subsequent to 1864 some amendments regarding princes were made, with the issuance of specific letters patent changing the title and style of the following groups:

*In 1898, the children of Prince George, Duke of York, the eldest living son of the Prince of Wales, were customarily titled princes, with the style of &quot;Highness&quot;, as great-grandchildren of Victoria in the male line. With letters patent dated 28 May 1898, the Crown granted the children of the eldest son of any Prince of Wales the style of &quot;Royal Highness&quot;.
*In 1914, the children of Ernest Augustus, Duke of Brunswick, a great-great-grandchild of George III, were granted the title of prince and the style &quot;Highness&quot; by King George V, in letters patent dated 17 June 1914.
*In 1917, George V issued a royal proclamation, altering the name of the Royal House from the House of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha to the House of Windsor and the discontinuance of the usage of the German titles of Duke of Saxony, Prince of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha and the like.
*Later that year, letters patent altered the rights to the title prince and the style &quot;Royal Highness&quot;. These letters patent, dated 30 November 1917, stated that &quot;the children of any Sovereign of these Realms and the children of the sons of any such Sovereign &quot;(as per the above Letters Patent of 1864)&quot; and the eldest living son of the eldest son of the Prince of Wales &quot;(a modification of the Letters Patent of 1898)&quot; shall have and at all times hold and enjoy the style, title or attribute of Royal Highness with their titular dignity of Prince or Princess prefixed to their respective Christian names or with their other titles of honour&quot;. It was also decreed in these letters that &quot;grandchildren of the sons of any such Sovereign in the direct male line ... shall have and enjoy in all occasions the style and title enjoyed by the children of Dukes of these Our Realms&quot; (i.e., &quot;Lord&quot; or &quot;Lady&quot; before their Christian name). In addition the letters stated &quot;save as aforesaid the style title or attribute of Royal Highness, Highness or Serene Highness and the titular dignity of Prince or Princess shall not henceforth be assumed or borne by any descendant of any Sovereign of these Realms&quot;.
:Both the proclamation and the letters patent of 1917 remain in force today, excepting a few amendments and creations noted.
*However, the former reigning Duke of Brunswick, head of the House of Hanover, refused to recognise the letters depriving his children of the British and Irish princely titles, and in 1931, he issued a decree, in the capacity of the head of the House of Hanover and senior male-line descendant of George III, purporting to state that the members of the former Hanoverian royal family would continue to bear the title of Prince (or Princess) of Great Britain and Ireland with the style of Royal Highness. This title and style remains in use to this day by his descendants, including the current head of the House of Hanover, Prince Ernst August. This decree is not legally recognised in the United Kingdom or Ireland, and the titles are used as titles of pretence. Since, however, the Hanovers are born in the male line of George II, they were bound by the Royal Marriages Act 1772 until repealed in 2015. Thus, before his marriage to Princess Caroline of Monaco, Ernst August requested, and Queen Elizabeth II issued on 11 January 1999, an Order in Council: &quot;My Lords, I do hereby declare My Consent to a Contract of Matrimony between His Royal Highness Prince Ernst August Albert of Hanover, Duke of Brunswick-Luneburg and Her Serene Highness Princess Caroline Louise Marguerite of Monaco...&quot; Without the royal assent, the marriage would have been void in the United Kingdom.
*After the abdication crisis of 1936, King George VI issued letters patent (dated 27 May 1937) regranting his elder brother his style as son of a sovereign, whilst expressly denying the style of &quot;Royal Highness&quot; to his wife and descendants. The marriage, however, had no issue.
*On 22 October 1948, George VI issued letters patent allowing the children of his daughter Princess Elizabeth, Duchess of Edinburgh, and son-in-law Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, to assume princely titles and the style &quot;Royal Highness&quot;; they would not have been entitled to them ordinarily, as grandchildren in the female line, until their mother ascended the throne as Elizabeth II. Thus her son was styled &quot;HRH Prince Charles of Edinburgh&quot; until his mother&#x27;s accession. Otherwise the children would have been styled Earl of Merioneth and Lady Anne Mountbatten, respectively.
*Elizabeth II issued letters patent, dated 22 February 1957, creating Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, a &quot;Prince of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland&quot;. Prince Philip had been born a Prince of Greece and Denmark, titles he renounced upon going through the naturalisation process, unaware that he was already a British subject by virtue of the Sophia Naturalization Act 1705.
*On the wedding day of Prince Edward and Sophie Rhys-Jones, it was announced by Buckingham Palace that Elizabeth II, in agreement with their wishes, had declared that their children would be styled as children of an earl, and not as Prince/Princess of the United Kingdom with the style &quot;Royal Highness&quot;.
* On 31 December 2012, Elizabeth II declared that all the children of the eldest son of the Prince of Wales, at that time Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, would have the title Prince or Princess and the style &quot;Royal Highness&quot;. (Prince William&#x27;s eldest son, born on 22 July 2013, was styled &quot;His Royal Highness Prince George of Cambridge,&quot; a right he had under the 1917 letters patent, as the eldest son&#x27;s eldest son). Whereas, his daughter, born on 2 May 2015, was styled &quot;Her Royal Highness Princess Charlotte of Cambridge&quot;. And his second son, born on 23 April 2018, was styled &quot;His Royal Highness Prince Louis of Cambridge&quot;.

==Styles of British princes==

* Sovereign&#x27;s male line grandsons without peerage – HRH Prince &quot;X&quot; of &quot;Y&quot; (with &quot;Y&quot; being the territorial designation of their father&#x27;s highest title), e.g., HRH Prince Michael of Kent.
* Sovereign&#x27;s great-grandsons whose father is the oldest son of the heir apparent – HRH Prince &quot;X&quot; of &quot;Y&quot; (with &quot;Y&quot; being the territorial designation of their father&#x27;s highest title), e.g., His Royal Highness Prince George of Cambridge before 2022.

==List of British princes since 1714==

Of the 58 British princes listed here, two are spouses of a reigning queen, and eight lost their title after World War I.

 – In letters patent dated 20 November 1917, King George V restricted the title of Prince to the children of the sovereign, the children of the sovereign&#x27;s sons, and the eldest living son of the eldest son of the Prince of Wales.

 – By an Order in Council dated 28 March 1919, as authorised by the Titles Deprivation Act 1917, King George V suspended the British peerage titles, princely dignities and honours of those who sided with Germany in World War I.

<text>The use of the title of Princess of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is entirely at the will of the sovereign, and is now expressed in letters patent. Individuals holding the title of princess will usually also be granted the style of &quot;Her Royal Highness&quot; (HRH). The current letters patent were issued in 1917 during World War I, with one extension in 2012. 

Between 1714 and 1917, pursuant to the then custom, daughters of the monarch and daughters of male-line descendants of a monarch were accorded the rank of a British princess. King George V issued letters patent on 30 November 1917 (issue 30428, Dec. 14, 1917, p. 2.), predefining who held the title, style and rank of a British Princess to restrict the automatic assignment of the title &quot;princess&quot; and the use of the style &quot;Royal Highness&quot; to the following persons:

* the legitimate daughters of a British Sovereign
* the legitimate male line granddaughters of a British sovereign.

On 31 December 2012, Queen Elizabeth II issued letters patent enabling daughters of the eldest son of the Prince of Wales to hold the title &quot;princess&quot; and style &quot;Royal Highness&quot;, as opposed to only the eldest son (the 1917 patent having extended &quot;prince&quot; to his eldest living son).

The wife of a British prince whose marriage has been approved by the British Sovereign is automatically accorded the status of the prince (princess) and the feminine form of her husband&#x27;s titles.

==Princesses of the blood royal and princesses by marriage==
Under the current practice, princesses of the blood royal are the legitimate daughters and the legitimate male line granddaughters of a British sovereign. They are dynasts, that is potential successors to the throne. For these individuals, the title &quot;Princess of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland&quot; and the style &quot;Her Royal Highness&quot; is an entitlement for life. The title Princess and the style Royal Highness is prefixed to the Christian name, before another title of honour. From 1714 until 1917, the male-line great-granddaughters of the Sovereign were titled &quot;Princess of Great Britain and Ireland&quot; with the style &quot;Highness&quot;. Since 1917, the male-line great-granddaughters of the Sovereign have held &quot;the style and title enjoyed by the children of dukes&quot;. For example, the daughters of Prince Richard, Duke of Gloucester, a male line grandson of George V, are styled Lady Davina Windsor and Lady Rose Gilman.

The legal wife of a British prince is also entitled to the status and rank of a British princess. If their husband is not the holder of his own substantive title, then the wife of a British prince has the right to be styled as Princess followed by their husband&#x27;s first given name. However, if their husband is the holder of either a Dukedom or an Earldom then this takes precedence. For example, upon her marriage to Prince Michael of Kent in 1978, Baroness Marie-Christine von Reibnitz assumed the title and style of &quot;Her Royal Highness Princess Michael of Kent&quot;. Similarly, upon her marriage to then Prince Richard of Gloucester, the former Birgitte van Deurs assumed the title and style of &quot;Her Royal Highness Princess Richard of Gloucester&quot;. Upon marriage, the wife of the prince of Wales becomes &quot;Her Royal Highness The Princess of Wales&quot;. Upon marriage, the wife of a royal duke (or earl) becomes &quot;Her Royal Highness The Duchess (or Countess) of X&quot;. When Prince Richard of Gloucester succeeded to his father&#x27;s dukedom in 1974, his wife became &quot;Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Gloucester&quot;. Since 1714, only four princesses were at marriage known in their title by their husband&#x27;s name, since all the others took the duchess form of the royal duke&#x27;s title. The four are Princess George of Cumberland, Princess Arthur of Connaught, Princess Richard of Gloucester and Princess Michael of Kent.

Princesses by marriage are entitled to the style &quot;Royal Highness&quot; by virtue of marriage, and retain the style if widowed. However, Elizabeth II issued letters patent dated 21 August 1996 stating that any woman divorced from a prince of the United Kingdom would no longer be entitled to the style &quot;Royal Highness&quot;. This has so far applied to Diana, Princess of Wales, and Sarah, Duchess of York. The title of HRH is not intrinsically linked to the title of Princess. Diana was restyled as &quot;Diana, Princess of Wales&quot; following her divorce as a courtesy of the late Queen Elizabeth II having been officially styled as The Princess of Wales during marriage. If Diana had ever remarried then she would have lost the right to the style and title completely. 

Since the passage of the &quot;Royal Marriages Act 1772&quot;, there were a few instances in the reign of King George III in which princes of the blood contracted marriages without consent of the king. This meant they were not legally married, denying the woman the lawful style &quot;Her Royal Highness&quot;, as well as any title in the peerage. For example, Prince George, Duke of Cambridge, a male-line grandson of King George III, &#x27;married&#x27; Sarah Louisa Fairbrother: the marriage was in contravention of the &quot;Royal Marriages Act&quot;, and therefore legally invalid. Accordingly, the duke&#x27;s wife was never titled the Duchess of Cambridge or accorded the style &quot;Her Royal Highness&quot;. Instead, she was known as &quot;Mrs FitzGeorge&quot;. An exception to the rule was created for King Edward VIII following his 1936 abdication. King George VI issued letters patent dated 27 May 1937 that entitled The Duke of Windsor, as Edward was now entitled, &quot;to hold and enjoy for himself only the title, style or attribute of Royal Highness so however that his wife and descendants if any shall not hold the said title, style or attribute&quot;.

There is also the case when a princess of the blood royal marries a British prince. She also becomes a princess by marriage and will be addressed in the same way. An example of this situation was the late Princess Alexandra, Duchess of Fife, when she married her cousin Prince Arthur of Connaught and became &quot;Princess Arthur of Connaught, Duchess of Fife&quot;.

Typically a princess by marriage should not be called princess followed by her first name. Diana, Princess of Wales, was consistently referred to as &quot;Princess Diana&quot; by fans and the media, but this usage of the title is technically erroneous, as she was not the child of a monarch nor the child of a son of a monarch. However, this tradition was broken once in the past century with Elizabeth II&#x27;s aunt, Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester, being referred to—with permission from the sovereign—in official sources as such following the death of her husband.

==History==
The use of the titles prince and princess and the styles of Highness and Royal Highness for members of the Royal Family is of fairly recent usage in the British Isles. Before 1714, there was no settled practice regarding the use of the titles prince and princess other than the heir apparent and his wife. From 1301 onward, the eldest sons of the Kings of England (and later Great Britain and the United Kingdom) have generally been created Prince of Wales and Earl of Chester. Their wives were titled Princess of Wales.

The title Princess Royal came into being in 1642 when Queen Henrietta Maria, the French-born wife of King Charles I, wished to imitate the way the eldest daughter of the French King was styled &quot;Madame Royale&quot;. However, there was no settled practice on the use of the title princess for the Sovereign&#x27;s younger daughters or male-line granddaughters. For example, as late as the time of King Charles II, the daughters of his brother James, Duke of York, both of whom became Queens regnant, were called simply &quot;The Lady Mary&quot; and &quot;The Lady Anne&quot;. The future Queen Anne was styled princess in her marriage treaty to Prince George of Denmark and then styled &quot;Princess Anne of Denmark&quot; once married. However, in exile at Saint-Germain-en-Laye, the deposed James II &amp; VII gave the title of Princess Royal to his last daughter, Louisa Maria (1692–1712).

After the accession of George Louis of Hanover as King George I, the children, grandchildren, and male line great-grandchildren of the British Sovereign were automatically titled &quot;Prince or Princess of Great Britain and Ireland&quot; and styled &quot;Royal Highness&quot; (in the case of children and grandchildren) or &quot;Highness&quot; (in the case of male line great-grandchildren). Queen Victoria confirmed this practice in letters patent dated 30 January 1864 (the first Act of the Prerogative dealing with the princely title in general terms).

On 31 December 2012, Elizabeth II issued letters patent enabling all children of the eldest son of the Prince of Wales to enjoy the princely title and style of &quot;Royal Highness&quot;, as opposed to only the eldest son.

==Styling of princesses==
===Princesses of the blood royal ===
*Daughter of a Sovereign: &quot;HRH The Princess N&quot; (e.g. &quot;HRH&quot; &quot;The Princess Margaret).&quot;
**The style &quot;HRH The Princess Royal&quot; is customarily (but not automatically) granted by the Sovereign, when vacant, to the Sovereign&#x27;s eldest daughter.
*Daughter of a son of a Sovereign: &quot;HRH Princess N of X&quot;, where &quot;X&quot; is the territorial designation of their father&#x27;s senior peerage; e.g. &quot;HRH Princess Alexandra of Kent&quot;, &quot;HRH Princess Charlotte of Wales&quot;, &quot;HRH Princess Lilibet of Sussex&quot;.
**Prior to Princess Charlotte, a daughter of the Prince of Wales: &quot;HRH Princess N&quot;
**Prior to 1917, a daughter of a son of a son of a Sovereign: &quot;HH Princess N of X&quot;
*From 31 December 2012, daughter of the eldest son of the Prince of Wales: &quot;HRH Princess N of X (e.g.&quot; &quot;HRH Princess Charlotte of Cambridge,&quot; until 2022).

When a princess marries, she still takes on her husband&#x27;s title. If the title is higher than (or equal to) the one she possesses, she will normally be styled using the female equivalent. If her husband has a lower title or style, her style as a princess remains in use, although it may then be combined with her style by marriage, e.g. &quot;HRH The Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll&quot; or &quot;HRH Princess Alice, Countess of Athlone&quot; – if that princess had a territorial designation, she may cease its use. It has become customary, however, for a princess who has been granted the title of &quot;HRH The Princess Royal&quot; to not combine it with her style by marriage: Princess Anne remains &quot;HRH The Princess Royal&quot; rather than &quot;HRH The Princess Royal, Lady Laurence&quot;.

===Princesses by marriage ===
A princess by marriage is addressed as &quot;Princess Husband&#x27;s name&quot;; this is akin to a woman being referred to as &quot;Mrs. John Smith&quot;. The only recent time this has broken tradition is with the sovereign&#x27;s express consent. Namely, with Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s aunts Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester, and Princess Marina, Duchess of Kent. The former was not a princess by birth, while the latter was born a princess of Greece and Denmark. Both women asked the Queen to use their given names after their husbands&#x27; deaths.

*Wife of a prince who has a peerage: &quot;HRH The Duchess/Countess of X&quot;, or, prior to 1917, possibly &quot;HH (&quot;e.g. &quot;HRH The Duchess of Edinburgh&quot; and &quot;HRH The Duchess of Sussex)&quot;
**Since 1996, divorced wife of a prince who held a peerage: &quot;N, Duchess/Countess of X&quot;. (e.g. Diana, Princess of Wales, and Sarah, Duchess of York)
*Wife of a son of a Sovereign, who has no peerage: &quot;HRH The Princess Husband&quot;.
*Wife of another prince who has no peerage: &quot;HRH Princess Husband of X&quot;. (X usually taken from father&#x27;s Dukedom; e.g. &quot;HRH Princess Michael of Kent&quot;)
*Prior to 1917, the wife of a prince in the third generation, who has no peerage: &quot;HH Princess Husband of X&quot;.

===Exceptions===
* There were only two historical princesses who would have been exceptions to the 1917 rule, but they died long before that. The sisters Sophia Matilda and Caroline Augusta Maria born in 1773 and 1774 were male line great-granddaughters of George II. All of the other exceptions were still alive in 1917 and were no longer permitted to use the style of HRH and Princess.

There have been several exceptions in recent history to these rules, but all have come by order of the Sovereign, mostly through letters patent. 
*In November 1905, King Edward VII allowed the two daughters of Louise, Princess Royal to use a princely title and the style of &quot;Highness&quot;. They were not entitled to the style of Royal Highness. The 1917 letters patent which stripped great-grandchildren of a British sovereign of the style of &quot;Highness&quot; with a princely title was complicated as it did not technically overrule Edward VII&#x27;s letters patent, as the former practice was mostly an unspoken courtesy as opposed to a written rule. The elder sister, Princess Alexandra, Duchess of Fife, was already married by that time, to Prince Arthur of Connaught: he was a male-line grandson of Victoria, and so entitled to use the style of Royal Highness. Alexandra was therefore styled &quot;Her Royal Highness Princess Arthur of Connaught, Duchess of Fife&quot; from her 1913 marriage for the rest of her life, and the 1917 letters patent did not change this. Her younger sister, Princess Maud, on the other hand, was unmarried in 1917. Until her 1923 marriage, she continued to use the title of &quot;Princess&quot; granted to her in 1905. Upon her marriage to Charles, Lord Carnegie, however, she chose to be known as &quot;Lady Maud Carnegie&quot; (or, from 1941, &quot;The Countess of Southesk&quot;), dropping her princely title.
*Charles III had the style and title His Royal Highness Prince Charles of Edinburgh from birth in 1948, even though he was a female-line grandchild of the Sovereign, being born to the future Elizabeth II, then Princess Elizabeth, Duchess of Edinburgh, during the reign of Elizabeth&#x27;s father, King George VI, who had no sons. George VI issued letters patent on 22 October 1948, granting the style to Elizabeth&#x27;s children. Under the same exception, Anne, Princess Royal was styled Her Royal Highness Princess Anne of Edinburgh from her birth in 1950 until her mother&#x27;s accession in 1952.
*In 1961, when her son married, the Duchess of Kent asked Elizabeth II to extend the use of a princely title to precede her first name, in order to avoid confusion with her daughter-in-law, Katharine Worsley, the new Duchess of Kent. As she was born a princess of Greece and Denmark, this was not incredibly notable, although traditionally she would have been styled as &quot;Her Royal Highness&quot; The Dowager Duchess of Kent. After this she was styled as &quot;Her Royal Highness&quot; Princess Marina, Duchess of Kent. 
*In 1974, the Duchess of Gloucester asked Elizabeth II for the same title as her sister-in-law, then Princess Marina, Duchess of Kent, with a princely title preceding her first name. Unlike Princess Marina, Alice had never been a princess in her own right, thus this allowance was far more unusual. Instead of being referred to as &quot;Her Royal Highness&quot; The Dowager Duchess of Gloucester, as is customary, she became &quot;Her Royal Highness&quot; Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester.
*In 2003, upon the request of Elizabeth II&#x27;s youngest son, Edward, his children would be styled as the children of an earl, though still retaining their royal titles. The children would be able to decide if they would want to use the title once they turned eighteen. As male-line grandchildren of a British monarch, Lady Louise Mountbatten-Windsor and the James, Earl of Wessex, would traditionally enjoy a princely title and style.
*In December 2012, Elizabeth II issued letters patent that stated that all children born to the eldest child of the Prince of Wales (then her son Charles), would enjoy a princely title and style, and not just the eldest son. Although in effect since 2012, it was not used in practice until the birth of Princess Charlotte in 2015.

==List of princesses by marriage since 1714==

=== Notes ===
Each of the following women married a royal prince but as their marriages were invalid under the Royal Marriages Act 1772, they did not become princesses:
* Maria Anne Fitzherbert, married George, Prince of Wales in 1785
* Lady Augusta Murray, married Prince Augustus Frederick, Duke of Sussex in 1793
* Lady Cecilia Buggin, married Prince Augustus Frederick, Duke of Sussex. She was later created Duchess of Inverness.
* Sarah Louisa Fairbrother, married Prince George, Duke of Cambridge in 1847

Although Wallis Simpson married the Duke of Windsor in 1937, and he was a British prince with the style &quot;His Royal Highness&quot;, having been confirmed as such by letters patent 27 May 1937 from his brother, George VI, Wallis and her descendants from the marriage were expressly denied the style of &quot;Royal Highness&quot; by the same letters patent before she married him. As a duke&#x27;s wife, she was always styled &quot;Her Grace The Duchess of Windsor&quot;. Her husband, the Duke of Windsor, insisted that staff and friends should refer to her as Her Royal Highness.

There have been two instances where a British princess married a British prince: first The Princess Mary, daughter of George III, who married her first cousin Prince William Frederick, Duke of Gloucester and Edinburgh; secondly Princess Alexandra, Duchess of Fife, granddaughter of Edward VII, who married her first cousin once removed Prince Arthur of Connaught. In the first instance Princess Mary was of higher rank and the Duke of Gloucester and his sister were elevated from the style &quot;His/Her Highness&quot; to &quot;His/Her Royal Highness&quot;. In the second instance Princess Alexandra had been granted the style &quot;Her Highness&quot; by her grandfather the King; as the wife of a Prince she received the style &quot;Her Royal Highness&quot;.

There is also the curious case of Princess Victoria Eugénie of Battenberg, later Queen Victoria Eugenia of Spain (the daughter of Princess Beatrice and Prince Henry of Battenberg). Prior to her marriage to Alfonso XIII of Spain in May 1906, she was styled Her Highness Princess Victoria Eugénie of Battenberg. On 3 April 1906 Edward VII, in order to elevate her standing prior to her wedding, raised her status to Royal Highness per royal declaration which read: &quot;Whitehall April 3, 1906. The KING has been graciously pleased to declare and ordain that His Majesty&#x27;s niece, Her Highness Princess Victoria Eugenie Julia Ena, daughter of Her Royal Highness the Princess Beatrice Mary Victoria Feodore (Princess Henry of Battenberg), shall henceforth be styled and called &quot;Her Royal Highness&quot;; And to command that the said Royal concession and declaration be registered in His Majesty&#x27;s College of Arms.&quot; Edward VII concurrently issued a Royal Warrant on the elevation which read: &quot;Our Will and Pleasure is and we do hereby declare and ordain that from and after the date of this Warrant our most Dear Niece Princess Victoria Eugénie Julia Ena, only daughter of Our most Dear Sister Beatrice Mary Victoria Feodore (Princess Henry of Battenberg) shall be styled entitled and called &quot;Her Royal Highness&quot; before her name and such Titles and Appellations which to her belong in all Deeds Records Instruments or Documents whatsoever wherein she may at any time hereafter be named or described. And We do hereby authorize and empower Our said most Dear Niece henceforth at all times to assume and use and to be called and named by the Style, Title and Appellation of &quot;Her Royal Highness&quot; accordingly. Given at Our Court of Saint James&#x27;s, the Third day of April 1906: in the Sixth Year of Our Reign. By His Majesty&#x27;s Command. M Gladstone&quot; Whether this made her a British Royal Princess is the subject of debate.

The former Lady Diana Spencer lost the prefix of Her Royal Highness upon her divorce in August 1996, and was restyled as &quot;Diana, Princess of Wales&quot;. Buckingham Palace issued a press release on the day the decree absolute of divorce was issued, announcing Diana&#x27;s change of title, but made it clear that Diana continued to be a member of the British Royal Family. This was confirmed by the deputy coroner of the Queen&#x27;s Household, Baroness Butler-Sloss, after a pre-hearing on 8 January 2007: &quot;I am satisfied that at her death, Diana, Princess of Wales continued to be a member of the Royal Household.&quot; This appears to have been confirmed in the High Court judicial review matter of &quot;Al Fayed &amp; Ors v Butler-Sloss&quot;. In that case, three High Court judges accepted submissions that the &quot;very name &#x27;Coroner to the Queen&#x27;s Household&#x27; gave the appearance of partiality in the context of inquests into the deaths of two people, &quot;one of whom was a member of the Family&quot; and the other was not.&quot;

==Common names==

Of the above named princesses, there are a great number of shared names:
* Mary, or similar (like Marie and Maria, usually ultimately after Mary, mother of Jesus), occurs thirty-one times – Queen Mary; her daughter, Mary, Princess Royal; Queen Alexandra; Queen Victoria&#x27;s daughter, Victoria, Princess Royal and her mother, Princess Victoria, Duchess of Kent; Queen Elizabeth II; and, currently, Princess Beatrice; Lady Louise Mountbatten-Windsor; The Duchess of Kent and Princess Michael of Kent among them.
* Louise (or Louisa) is borne by twenty-six – including Queen Louise of Denmark; Queen Adelaide; Queen Victoria&#x27;s daughters, Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll and Victoria, Princess Royal, as well as her mother, Princess Victoria, Duchess of Kent; Queen Alexandra; Louise, Princess Royal; Princess Louise, Duchess of Connaught; Queen Mary; and, currently, Lady Louise Mountbatten-Windsor and Anne, Princess Royal.
* Victoria is the name of twenty-five princesses, nineteen of whom are named for Queen Victoria – among these being her four daughters (including Victoria &quot;Vicky&quot;, Princess Royal); her granddaughter, The Princess Victoria; Mary, Princess Royal; and, currently, Princess Eugenie. Among those not named for the queen are her mother, Princess Victoria, Duchess of Kent and Queen Mary.
* Others include Charlotte, Alexandra (and Alexandrina), Augusta, Elizabeth, Caroline, Sophie (and Sophia), Matilda (or Maud), Alice, Frederica, Helena, Beatrice, Olga, Feodora, Alberta, and Adelaide.

<text>Windows XP Media Center Edition (MCE) is a version of the Windows XP operating system which was the first version of Windows to include Windows Media Center, designed to serve as a home-entertainment hub. The last version, Windows XP Media Center Edition 2005 Update Rollup 2, was released on October 14, 2005. After that, Windows Media Center was included in certain editions of later Windows versions. It was an optional, paid addition to Windows 8 and then discontinued in Windows 10. Windows XP Media Center Edition reached end of support on April 8, 2014, along with most other Windows XP editions.

==Versions==
Windows XP Media Center Edition has had the following releases, all based on Windows XP Professional with all features enabled except domain-joining ability disabled in Windows XP Media Center Edition 2005 and Terminal Services in the original release.

*A preview version of Windows XP Media Center Edition from Microsoft&#x27;s eHome division, was shown at CES 2002, with the final version released later that year.
*Windows XP Media Center Edition (codenamed &quot;Freestyle&quot;) was the original version of Windows XP Media Center, which was built from the Windows XP Service Pack 1 codebase. It was first announced on July 16, 2002, released to manufacturing on September 3, 2002, and was first generally available on October 29, 2002, in North America.
*Windows XP Media Center Edition 2004 (codenamed &quot;Harmony&quot;), which was launched on September 30, 2003, and was made available as an upgrade to the owners of the original editions&#x27; licenses, was built from the Windows XP Service Pack 1 codebase, after the original Windows XP Media Center Edition.
*Windows XP Media Center Edition 2005 (codenamed &quot;Symphony&quot;), which was launched on October 12, 2004, was built from the Windows XP Service Pack 2 codebase. It is the first edition of MCE available to non-Tier 1 system builders. Among other things, it includes support for Media Center Extenders, and CD/DVD-Video burning support.
*Windows XP Media Center Edition 2005 Update Rollup 2 (codenamed &quot;Emerald&quot;, October 14, 2005) is a major update to MCE 2005 (Symphony) and was a recommended download. It adds support for the Xbox 360 as a media center extender, DVB-T broadcasts, and support for two ATSC tuner cards. It is the second version of Windows XP Media Center based on Windows XP Service Pack 2, after Windows XP Media Center Edition 2005.

To determine the underlying edition of Windows XP on which a particular revision of MCE is based, the System Properties Control Panel applet can be used. To determine the revision of MCE that is being used, select the About Media Center option from the General -&gt; Settings area inside MCE.

==Exclusive features==
Windows XP Media Center Edition is distinguished with its exclusive component, Media Center, a media player that supports watching and recording TV programs, as well as playing DVD-Video, photo slideshows, and music. Media Center sports a user interface that is optimized for use from a distance with large fonts and icons.

Unlike competing commercial DVR products, Microsoft did not charge a monthly subscription fee for its Media Center TV guide service.

Due to its strict hardware requirements, Microsoft opted not to supply Media Center as an independent retail version. Microsoft only distributed it to MSDN subscribers and original equipment manufacturers in certain countries. Consumers purchase Media Center preinstalled on a new computer, set-top box or embedded device.

==Windows XP Media Center Edition 2005==

===New features===
*Away Mode in Update Rollup 2 allows the machine to appear off while it performs background tasks.
*Windows Movie Maker, contains new effects and transitions and support for DVD burning based on Sonic Solutions&#x27;s AuthorScript technology.
*Windows Media Player, upgraded to version 10, along with Windows Media Format Runtime 9.5.
*Royale theme: not included in other editions of Windows XP except Windows XP Tablet PC Edition, it is included and enabled by default.
*Microsoft Plus! Digital Media Edition components: a number of applications not included in previous versions of MCE are now included such as Audio Converter, CD Label Maker, Dancer and Party Mode.
*SoundSpectrum&#x27;s G-Force: a special edition is included as one of the music visualizations for Windows Media Player.
*Screensavers and themes from &quot;Microsoft Plus! for Windows XP&quot; are included (Aquarium, Da Vinci, Nature, Space and My Pictures Premium).
*Media Center Extender Support, dedicated hardware devices that allow users to view the same content that is available on the MCE computer over wired or wireless Ethernet, are introduced in this version for the first time. Linksys and other companies currently sell Media Center Extenders, and Microsoft sells an add-on kit for the Xbox game console that allows it to function as an extender. The Xbox 360 also has Media Center Extender functionality out of the box, including HDTV support (which is notably absent from current extenders). Media Center 2005 currently can support up to 5 Media Center Extenders per household.
*First party hardware: Microsoft has released its own first party remote, receiver and infrared blaster with MCE 2005. A new specially designed wireless computer keyboard for MCE 2005 was released September 2005.

===Removed features===
*Joining a Windows Server domain: The ability to join an Active Directory domain is disabled by default. Computers that upgrade to Windows Media Center from a version of Windows that had joined the domain before upgrade will remain joined to the domain. However, if they leave the domain, they may never re-join. The option to join a domain during installation of this version of Windows is still available. Microsoft says that the reason for this discontinuation of feature is to support Media Center Extenders which required Fast User Switching. It is possible to re-enable joining a domain by modifying the Windows registry.
*Windows Media Player 6.4, which is shipped with Windows 2000 and can be installed on Windows 95, Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 98, was removed.

==Hardware requirements==

Media Center has higher hardware requirements than other editions of Windows XP. MCE 2005 requires at least a 1.6 GHz processor, DirectX 9.0 hardware-accelerated GPU (ATI Radeon 9 series or nVidia GeForce FX Series or higher), and 256 MB of System RAM. Some functionality, such as Media Center Extender support, use of multiple tuners, or HDTV playback/recording carries higher system requirements.

Media Center is much more restricted in the range of hardware that it supports than most other software DVR solutions. Media Center tuners must have a standardized driver interface, and they must have hardware MPEG-2 encoders (this was changed as companies such as ATI wrote drivers to support MCE 2005 with their All-In-Wonder cards and HDTV Wonder cards), closed caption support, and a number of other features. Media Center remote controls are standardized in terms of button labels and functionality, and, to a degree, general layout.

==Upgradeability==
Windows XP Media Center Edition could be directly upgraded to Windows Vista Home Premium or Windows Vista Ultimate.

==Post-release support==
Support for Windows XP Media Center Edition under Microsoft&#x27;s consumer product lifecycle policy was planned to end on April 13, 2010, however, in July 2009, Microsoft extended the support window to July 12, 2011. This date would be then extended again on December 31, 2010 to a final end of support date of April 8, 2014, citing support volumes in emerging markets as the reason for the extension.

Windows XP Media Center Edition retail availability ended as planned on April 14, 2009.

==Career==
===Film career===

She also starred in the Telugu film &quot;Bhakta Dhruva Markendaya&quot; in 1982, an acclaimed all children film made in both Tamil and Telugu. As an adult, she was introduced to the film industry through the Malayalam film &quot;April 18&quot; (1984), by director Balachandra Menon. In the same year, she debuted in the Tamil film industry with &quot;Enakkul Oruvan&quot; (1984), directed by SP Muthuraman. She did come back to act in occasional Tamil films opposite Satyaraj (&quot;Mallu Vetti Minor, Vaathiyar Veetu Pillai&quot;), Bhagyaraj (&quot;Ithu Namma Aalu&quot;) and Vijayakanth (&quot;Ponmana Selvan&quot;, &quot;En Kitta Mothathey&quot;) in the early 90s – these roles were generally glamorous in which Shobana generally acted as the beautiful, posh and haughty city girl who is eventually charmed by the village boy.

From &quot;Aviduthe Pole Ivideyum&quot; to &quot;Upaharam&quot;, Shobana did sixteen movies in a single year, 1985. Shobana also acted in the Tamil period film &quot;Kochadaiiyaan&quot; (2014).

In &quot;Rudraveena&quot; (1984), alongside Mega Star Chiranjeevi, she played classical dancer Lalitha Sivajyothi, who belongs to a lower caste and is denied entry into the temple. In &quot;Abhinandana&quot; (1988), she paired with Karthik, and essayed his love interest, who aspires to become a classical dancer. In &quot;Kokila&quot; (1990), she paired with Naresh, and In &quot;Alludugaru&quot; (1990) she starred opposite Mohan Babu and was a remake of Malayalam film &quot;Chithram. 1 April Viduthala&quot; and &quot;Rowdy Gari Pellam&quot; were other Telugu films in 1991.

Shobana won her first National Film Award for Best Actress in 1993 for her performance in AM Fazil&#x27;s &quot;Manichitrathazhu&quot;. Her portrayal of Ganga Nakulan and alter-ego Nagavalli in the film was described by critics as &quot;spell binding&quot;.

<text>Sally Jane Janet Gunnell, OBE, DL (born 29 July 1966) is a British former track-and-field athlete, active between 1984 and 1997, who won the 1992 Olympic gold medal in the 400 metres hurdles. During a 24-month period between 1992 and 1994, Gunnell won every international event open to her, claiming Olympic Games, World Championship, European Championship, Commonwealth Games, Goodwill Games, IAAF World Cup and European Cup golds in the event, and breaking the British, European and World records in it. She is the only female British athlete to have won all four &#x27;majors&#x27;; Olympic, World, European and Commonwealth titles, and was the first female 400 metres hurdler in history to win the Olympic and World titles and break the world record. Her former world record time of 52.74 secs in 1993 is still the current British record. She was named World and European Female Athlete of the Year in 1993, and was made an MBE in 1993 and an OBE in 1998.

==Early life==

Gunnell was born in Chigwell, Essex, England to Les and Rosemary Gunnell, and grew up on the family&#x27;s three-hundred-acre farm and attended the local primary and West Hatch High schools in Chigwell.

==Athletics career==

Gunnell started out in athletics with the Essex Ladies club as an accomplished long jumper and heptathlete, before specialising in hurdling. In 1984, she narrowly missed Olympic selection at both heptathlon, with a score of 5680 points and in the 100 metres hurdles, where she set a UK junior record of 13.30 secs.

In 1986, having won the AAAs and UK titles, Gunnell won the Commonwealth Games gold medal in the 100 metres hurdles in Edinburgh, ahead of Wendy Jeal and 1984 Olympic heptathlon champion Glynis Nunn. She would remain the UK number one in the event over the next four seasons and reach the semi-finals at the 1987 World Championships and 1988 Olympics in the event.

Gunnell first attempted the 400 m hurdles event in 1987, with a 59.9 clocking. In 1988, in her first full season at the event, she would reach the Olympic final in Seoul. At the Olympic trials in Birmingham, she broke the UK record with 55.40. In Seoul she would improve this twice, first to 54.48 in the semis then to 54.03, to finish fifth in the final. This would remain her best time in the event for three years.

In 1989, Gunnell won the European Indoor title at 400 metres. Outdoors, she finished second in the 400 m hurdles at the European Cup behind East Germany&#x27;s Petra Krug, but ahead of Olympic silver medallist Tatyana Ledovskaya. In September at the World Cup, she was third behind Sandra Farmer-Patrick of the US and Ledovsakya, but this time ahead of Krug. In January 1990, she defeated 1988 Olympic champion Debbie Flintoff-King to win the Commonwealth title in Auckland. The 1990 summer season however was disappointing, when she only finished sixth at the European Championships.

Gunnell entered into the best phase of her career in 1991, improving her own three-year-old UK record three times. In Monaco she ran 53.78, in Zurich she ran 53.62, then at the World Championships in Tokyo, she won the silver medal behind Ledovskaya with 53.16, the then third fastest time of all-time. Ledovskaya won with 53.11.

Gunnell won the 400 m hurdles at the 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona, running 53.23 to defeat Sandra Farmer-Patrick. She also anchored the British 4 × 400 m quartet to a bronze medal. In 1993, she reached her peak, when she set the world record in the 400 hurdles to win gold in the World Championships in Stuttgart, winning in 52.74, narrowly ahead of Farmer-Patrick who ran 52.79, also inside the old record.

This record was broken by Kim Batten in 1995, but is still the British record. Gunnell was the first female 400 metres hurdler to have won the Olympic and World titles and broken the world record, a feat since achieved by both Dalilah Muhammad and Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone.

In 1994, Gunnell added the European title to her collection, winning comfortably in 53.33. She also won the Goodwill Games ahead of Kim Batten, successfully defended her Commonwealth title and won the World Cup title in London. 1994 was her third (and final) year as the world&#x27;s number one. She missed most of 1995 due to injury, an injury from which she would never fully recover. Her defence of her Olympic title in Atlanta in 1996 was cut short when she pulled up injured in the semi-finals. This seemed a particularly cruel blow, as this race occurred on her 30th birthday. Also in 1996, she worked as a Red Cross ambassador in Angola. In September 1997, she retired after a recurrence of an Achilles tendon injury forced her to pull out of the World Championships semi-final.

Gunnell remains the only woman to have won the European, World, Commonwealth and Olympic 400-metre hurdles titles.

Gunnell is now involved as one of the ambassadors for McCain&#x27;s Track &amp; Field partnership with UK Athletics.

==Television==

Gunnell worked as a television presenter, predominantly for the BBC, until 2006. She also co-hosted the game show &quot;Body Heat&quot; (1994–96) on ITV with Mike Smith and Jeremy Guscott.

Gunnell was one of the four celebrity guests in the ITV&#x27;s &quot;You Bet!&quot; – Series 7 (1993–94), co-winning with Michaela Strachan, donating her winnings to a charity working to find a cure for breast cancer. In 1997, she was the recipient of the &quot;big red book&quot; on the &quot;This is Your Life&quot; programme.

In summer 2006, she was a celebrity showjumper in the BBC&#x27;s Sport Relief event &quot;Only Fools on Horses&quot;. She also won a &quot;Weakest Link&quot; Sporting Heroes Special, first broadcast on 25 July 2009 on BBC One.

She took part in a celebrity version of TV show &quot;Total Wipeout&quot; which aired on 2 January 2010.

In 2012, Gunnell took part on ITV&#x27;s &quot;The Cube&quot; and won £20,000 for her charity.

==Recognition==

In the 1993 New Year Honours, Gunnell was made an MBE (Member of the Order of the British Empire) and in the 1998 Birthday Honours, she was made an OBE (Officer of the Order of the British Empire). In 2011, Gunnell was appointed Deputy Lieutenant of West Sussex.

In 2012, Gunnell was one of five Olympians chosen as part of a series body-casting artworks by Louise Giblin exhibited in London and copies were being sold in aid of the charity Headfirst.

==Personal life==

Gunnell is married to fellow athlete Jonathan Bigg, and has three sons; Finley, Luca and Marley. She lives near Brighton in East Sussex.

<doc id="785210" wikidata="Q3843056" url="?curid=785210" title="Spike of Bensonhurst">
<text>Spike of Bensonhurst is a 1988 American comedy drama mafia film written and directed by Paul Morrissey and starring Sasha Mitchell. The film also features Ernest Borgnine, Maria Pitillo, and Talisa Soto. It was released in the United States on November 11, 1988 after it premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival. In the United Kingdom and other countries, the film was released with the title Mafia Kid.

==Plot==
Spike Fumo is a young Italian-American man who lives in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn and aspires to be a boxer. He hopes to impress the local mob boss, Baldo Cacetti, so that he will become his sponsor. However, Cacetti knows Spike only competes in fixed matches, so he turns down the offer. Spike reminds Cacetti that his father went to prison for working for him, so Cacetti gives Spike a job collecting money for his numbers racket.

Spike meets the young woman Angel when she shows up to one of his boxing matches with her boyfriend, Justin. Angel also happens to be Cacetti&#x27;s daughter. Cacetti makes clear to Spike that he does not want his daughter with Spike as he thinks Justin, who attends college and is the son of a congresswoman, is upwardly mobile and thus a better fit for her. Cacetti orders Spike to leave Bensonhurst, even though Angel prefers to be with him.

Spike ends up in a predominantly Puerto Rican section of Red Hook, where Bandana, one of his boxing friends, lives. Bandana invites Spike to live at his apartment. Spike is appalled at the decaying state of the neighborhood and manages to scare off loiterers and drug addicts away from the apartment building. Bandana&#x27;s mother thanks him for the gesture and introduces him to her teenage daughter, India.

While living in Red Hook, Spike continues to train with Bandana at the local gym and begins a relationship with India. One day, Spike calls his friend Frankie to deliver his old boxing equipment. Frankie arrives with a now pregnant Angel accompanying him. Angel informs Spike that her father is still against their union. Soon after, Spike learns that India is also pregnant.

Back in Bensonhurst, Angel tries to convince her father that Spike could make something out of his life if only he helped him. Cacetti relents and arranges for Spike to win a fixed match in Bensonhurst. Spike believes this match is his chance to return to Bensonhurst and marry Angel. He tells India although he loves her, he cannot stay and returns to his old neighborhood. Cacetti&#x27;s plan for Spike goes awry when he catches his wife Sylvia asleep in bed with Spike, though it is a misunderstanding and the two merely fell asleep together after playing cards. Cacetti orders for Spike to lose the match instead.

When Spike discovers these plans, he angrily defies them and knocks out his opponent in the first round. Angel arrives at the banquet hall with Justin. Cacetti has his men take Spike to the kitchen, where Angel pleads with her father and tells him although she does not want to marry Spike, she doesn’t want to see him murdered, either. Cacetti agrees to spare Spike&#x27;s life, but he allows his men to break his right hand. Angel goes on to marry Justin and gives birth to Spike’s son. Spike returns to Red Hook, marries India, and becomes a police officer. Cacetti, having forgiven Spike, takes his grandson to visit Spike, India, and their new family.

==Cast==
==Critical reception==
Roger Ebert gave the film 3 out of 4 stars and said the film is &quot;not the best comedy ever made but has energy and local color and a charismatic lead performance by Sasha Mitchell as Spike.&quot; He called Borgnine&#x27;s performance the &quot;funniest in a long time&quot; and added, &quot;The domestic arrangements of a middle-class Mafia household are examined here as hilariously as in &quot;Married to the Mob&quot;, and if we do not care much about the final fight by the time it comes, well, neither do the fighters.&quot; In response to claims that the movie &quot;is generated mostly out of broad stereotypes&quot; of Italians and Puerto Ricans, Ebert wrote, &quot;I do not think the filmmakers or the actors had any racist intents. I think they were inspired more by the ethnic humor of TV sitcoms and movies like &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot;.&quot; His colleague, Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, had a completely different reaction, giving it 2 out of 4 stars, and calling it &quot;a weak imitation of &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; with Italian family conflicts substituting for John Travolta&#x27;s dancing. The stridency of the screenplay diminishes the humor in this story of another youth trying to break out of his neighborhood.&quot;

Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote while the film &quot;doesn&#x27;t have the sharpest satirical edge...it does have personality&quot;. Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote the film &quot;has to buck the truth that comedies about Italian-Americans and the Mafia are beginning to wear a bit thin. With his outrageous sense of humor Morrissey turns this seeming obstacle to great advantage only to be slowed down by too much plot. The film begins to lose steam after its first hour and becomes dragged-out. Luckily, there’s as compensation for this drawback--a roster of rousing performances. Newcomer Mitchell is a breezy charmer; Borgnine is fresh and canny in a jewel of a portrayal; Anne DeSalvo is a likeably smart cookie as Baldo’s wife, and Antonia Rey practically walks off with the movie as an exuberant Puerto Rican mother. Best of all, &quot;Spike of Bensonhurst&quot;...boasts a finish that takes your breath away in its utter lack of sentimentality.&quot; Eleanor Ringel of the &quot;Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot; called it &quot;a real dog of a movie, a strutting exercise in style-over- substance that’s so tickled by its own jokes that you can almost hear it giggling at itself from off-camera.&quot; Desmond Ryan of &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; wrote that it &quot;walks the same neighborhood as &quot;Moonstruck&quot;, but its estimation of honor and honesty in contemporary American life is strictly out of &quot;Prizzi&#x27;s Honor&quot;; its motto could come from John Huston&#x27;s caustic look at the Cosa Nostra, in which a capo gives this warmhearted praise for hit-woman Kathleen Turner: &#x27;She&#x27;s an American. She saw a chance to make a buck, and she took it.&#x27;&quot; Ben Yagoda of the &quot;Philadelphia Daily News&quot; said that it &quot;is kind of a mess. But you can&#x27;t help feeling warm toward it. It has a great cast, a lot of good lines and an absolute refusal to do the expected. A plus is the sound track, which is composed of corny, wonderful pop songs from Italy.&quot; Jay Carr of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; called the film &quot;messy, but cheerfully tangy and winning.&quot; However, Michael Sragow of the &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot; said that it &quot;fails to stretch a blase manner into a satirical point of view. Now and then, one of the performers breaks out of the movie&#x27;s mode of low-key archness, like Anne De Salvo (who plays the don&#x27;s wife), an indestructible comedian who can&#x27;t help creating an outsize character even when only a caricature is called for. In &quot;Spike of Bensonhurst&quot;, however, if the cast starts to rouse some energy, schmaltz and raucous humor, the director is sure to squelch it with a wilting piece of parody and then to put it all on cruise control. Morrissey doesn&#x27;t just undercut the kind of movie he&#x27;s razzing; he undercuts himself.&quot;

The film received generally positive reviews in Canada, the only other market to see a theatrical release of the film. Peter Goddard of &quot;The Toronto Star&quot; called the film &quot;funnier than &quot;Married To The Mob&quot;, spunkier than &quot;Rocky&quot;, [and] more happily off-the-wall than &quot;Moonstruck&quot;&quot;, adding that it was &quot; the sweetest satire of the season—one so funny you needn&#x27;t always laugh at it.&quot; Marke Andrews of &quot;The Vancouver Sun&quot; called the film &quot;coarse, cheeky and funny.&quot; John Griffin of the Montreal &quot;Gazette&quot; called the film &quot;reactionary, racist, misogynist, derivative and dumb as dirt&quot;, but said he liked it &quot;because it&#x27;s alive; because it crackles with misguided energy; because the young actors physically will the story line back on track with performances that should take them off the welfare lines and into Hollywood immediately.&quot;

In Australia, where the film was released under the title of &quot;The Mafia Kid&quot; and went directly to video, Bill Halliwell of &quot;The Age&quot; wrote that &quot;even though the story set-ups are as predictable as the mob cliches, [it] turns out to be nonetheless enjoyable thanks to a quick, inventive script by director Paul Morrissey and co-writer Alan Browne.&quot;

<doc id="785238" wikidata="Q7699810" url="?curid=785238" title="Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah">
<text>Tengku Razaleigh bin Tengku Mohd Hamzah (Jawi: تڠکو غزالي بن تڠکو محمد حمزة; born 13 April 1937) is a Malaysian politician who served as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Gua Musang from August 1986 to November 2022 and for Ulu Kelantan from August 1974 to August 1986. He is the longest-serving MP to date, serving from 1974 until 2022, for 48 years in a row. He is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Father of Malaysian Economic Development&quot; for playing a pivotal role in establishing and implementing key foundations and policies in Malaysian economy. A descendant of Malay royalty, he is a great-uncle of the current Sultan of Kelantan, Sultan Muhammad V.

He was the Minister of Finance (1976–1984), Minister of International Trade and Industry (1984–1987), former chairman of Asian Development Bank, former chairman of Islamic Development Bank, founding Chairman and Chief Executive of Malaysian oil company, Petronas, and chairman of the 33rd Board of Governors of the World Bank and IMF. He is now the longest serving MP in Malaysia. His popularity has earned him nicknames such as &quot;The People&#x27;s Prince&quot; and &quot;Ku Kita&quot; (Our Tengku). He is affectionately known as Ku Li, derived from the last syllables of Tengku Razaleigh; a common custom in the Kelantan dialect.

==Early life and education==
Razaleigh was born on 13 April 1937 in Kota Bharu to Tengku Sri Maharaja Tengku Muhammad Hamzah Ibni Almarhum Raja Dewa Tengku Zainal Abidin, who was once the Menteri Besar of Kelantan. Razaleigh was educated at English-medium schools and attended Sultan Ismail College before moving on to the Malay College Kuala Kangsar (MCKK). He left MCKK disliking the boarding school environment there, and transferred to Anderson School in Ipoh, Perak. He received a Bachelor of Science in economics from the Queen&#x27;s University of Belfast in 1959 and later pursued a law degree at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn. However, upon his father&#x27;s death, he was forced to return and never continued his studies.

Razaleigh took over the family business, and then joined the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO).

==Involvement in Malaysia&#x27;s economic development==

Starting from the mid-1960s, with the support of then Prime Ministers Tunku Abdul Rahman and Abdul Razak Hussein, several initiatives were launched to increase Malaysia&#x27;s economic growth. Being a favourite of both leaders, Razaleigh was hand-picked to fulfill many of these initiatives. This included major corporate takeovers of foreign conglomerates and industries which were previously foreign-owned.

===Bank Bumiputra Malaysia Berhad===
On 4 June 1965, &quot;Kongres Ekonomi Bumiputra&quot; (Bumiputra Economic Congress), sponsored by the Ministry of National and Rural Development, was held in Kuala Lumpur for 3 days to generate an interest among Malays and other local indigenous groups to participate in commerce and industry. Seven working committees were formed to achieve these objectives.

Tun Abdul Razak, the then deputy prime minister of Malaysia, announced that the Government had agreed to form a local Bank (&quot;Bank Bumiputra&quot;) as recommended by the Economic Congress based on a majority of the 69 resolutions passed in the meeting. The Bank, with its initial capital to be provided by the Malaysian Government, would be established. The bank&#x27;s ownership would ultimately be sold to the public through shares. On 15 July 1965, Abdul Razak announced the Government&#x27;s decision to provide $5 million as the initial capital for Bank Bumiputra. He stated that the bank&#x27;s main function was to assist rural businessmen in the form of loans.

Bank Bumiputra Malaysia Berhad was formally launched by Tun Abdul Razak on 1 October 1965 with authorised capital of $25 million, instead of the $5 million announced earlier. The senior management was headed by Mohd Raslan bin Dato&#x27; Abdullah as managing director and Tengku Razaleigh as executive director. The other board members include S.O.K. Ubaidulla (president of the United Chamber of Commerce), L.E Osman, K. Mushir Ariff, Wan Yahya bin Haji Mohamad, K.D. Eu and Kuok Hock Nien. The general manager of the bank was Wong Aun Pui, a prominent local banker with 20 years of experience and director of many rubber and palm oil companies.

In 1999, Bank Bumiputra was merged into Bumiputra-Commerce Holdings (which is the listed vehicle for CIMB Group).

=== Perbadanan Nasional Berhad (PERNAS) ===
PERNAS (Perbadanan Nasional Berhad or National Corporation) was set up in November 1969 as a wholly owned government company to carry out the resolutions at the Second Bumiputera Economic Congress. Among the major shareholders were the Ministry of Finance, Bank Negara Malaysia (The Central Bank of Malaysia) and Bank Bumiputera Malaysia Berhad. Pernas was put under a solid footing under the chairmanship of Razaleigh (1970–1974).

In view of the very low participation of Bumiputeras in the private sector and industries at the time, PERNAS&#x27; principles were to:
* enter undertakings which would bring high economic returns,
* enter into joint ventures where PERNAS was to be the majority shareholder with controlling interest over operations,
* employ Bumiputeras at all levels of operations and undertakings.

To achieve its objectives, many subsidiaries were subsequently set up. The first of which was Malaysia National Insurance Berhad (MNI), which was established in April 1970. This was followed with Pernas Construction Sdn Bhd, Pernas Engineering Sdn Bhd, and Pernas Securities Sdn Bhd. In 1973, Pernas Mining Sdn Bhd was set up and in the following year, Pernas Edar Sdn Bhd.

Razaleigh became involved in what became known as the Haw Par imbroglio of the mid-1970s, working in concert with the Singapore-based Haw Par Brothers International Ltd, then one of the subsidiaries under the control of British wheeler-dealer Jim Slater, to acquire control of the British-owned tin conglomerate known as the London Tin Company, and the plantations conglomerate Sime Darby. This was to be achieved through a web of transactions in which both would end up in the control of PERNAS. Things came to a standstill when Singapore accused Haw Par of financial irregularities and later jailed a senior executive.

But this proved a short-lived setback for Razaleigh. Within two years, he enlisted the help of the merchant bank Rothschild – which was also a part owner of Bumiputera Merchant Bankers – to engage in a share and proxy battle to wrest Sime Darby from British control and shift its headquarters to Kuala Lumpur. Control of the London Tin Company soon followed. In 1979, another takeover attempt was made to achieve control of Kumpulan Guthrie Bhd, when Malaysian money made a &quot;dawn raid&quot; on the plantation giant; this helped to kickstart a &quot;domino effect&quot; which sealed the fates of most other foreign owned plantations.

Among the major corporate takeover exercise and formation of new businesses during Razaleigh&#x27;s stewardship as Pernas chairman were
* Insurance – Malaysia National Insurance Bhd,
* Banking – Maybank Bhd,
* Mining – the then-largest tin mining company in the world, London Tin Company, which was later renamed MMC Corporation Berhad.
* Palm Oil and Rubber Producer – Sime Darby, Guthrie Berhad, Highlands &amp; Lowlands Berhad.

In 1971, Razaleigh led a trade delegation to China to initiate a prospect of a business relationship. During the visit to China, Razaleigh was granted a meeting with China&#x27;s then Premier Zhou Enlai. In 1971, total trade with China stood at a mere RM105.6 million. By 1980, this ballooned to RM1.6 billion. Since then, the contact between the two countries has steadily increased.

=== Fleet Holdings ===
Fleet Holdings was created to reduce UMNO&#x27;s financial dependence on non-Malay supporters, such as Chinese businessmen, and to break the foreign hold over Malaysia&#x27;s media companies.

The Youth division of UMNO had protested strongly about foreign control over the Malaysian publishing media and passed a resolution requesting the then prime minister, Tun Abdul Razak, to obtain control of the publishing company, the Straits Times Press.

As a result, Fleet Holdings Sdn Bhd was formed in 1972 by Razaleigh as the Treasurer of UMNO on the instructions of Tun Abdul Razak. This company was started with Razaleigh&#x27;s own money and its purpose was to take control of the local media not just in the form of capital, but in management terms as well.

In the year that it commenced operations, Fleet Holdings paid RM32 million to control 80% of Straits Times Press (later renamed New Straits Times Press). After its successful venture in media, Fleet Holdings expanded into other fields, including banking, car rental, leasing, communications, filming, insurance, and others. When Razaleigh gave up control of the company in 1983, total asset value of Fleet Holdings stood at more than RM500 million with liabilities amounting to only RM56 million. By 1987 however, liabilities exceeded RM448 million and the company was struggling to service its monthly interest payments of RM3 million. Fleet Holdings became the subject of a bitter dispute between Mahathir and Razaleigh before the UMNO party&#x27;s split.

Through Fleet Group, UMNO held substantial stakes in Bursa Malaysia listed companies, including The New Straits Times Press (M) Bhd, Time Engineering Bhd (now known as Dagang NeXchange Bhd), Bank of Commerce Bhd, Commerce International Merchant Bankers Bhd (both banks later subsumed into CIMB Group) and Faber Group Bhd (now known as UEM Edgenta). Many of the assets have since been sold to government investment companies and other investors.

=== Petroliam Nasional Berhad (Petronas)===
Due to a dispute between the Sarawak Chief Minister Abdul Rahman Ya&#x27;kub and his nephew Abdul Taib Mahmud (at the time the Federal Natural Resources Minister) over oil rights, then Prime Minister Abdul Razak dispatched Razaleigh to visit Rahman at the latter&#x27;s private residence. Razaleigh suggested the formation of a company instead of a statutory body where the former would distribute profits equally between the Federal and the State governments. Rahman was agreeable to this proposal. Upon Razaleigh&#x27;s return to Kuala Lumpur, the Prime Minister tasked him with drafting, in secret, the Petroleum Development Act to be completed before the 1974 Malaysian general election. Rahman was in regular contact with Razaleigh to ask for updates about the terms offered by the Federal government. Razaleigh told Rahman about the abolishment of the concessions system and that 5% of oil revenues will be redirected back to the respective oil-producing States as royalty payments. A similar amount would go to the Federal government. Rahman considered this a fair deal and gave his blessings.

While all other oil-producing States in Malaysia signed the petroleum agreement, Tun Mustapha, the chief minister of Sabah, stubbornly refused, complaining of the meagre 5% oil royalty. Mustapha requested for 10-20% of revenue as royalty, failing which he would pull Sabah out of Malaysia. However, Razaleigh refused to budge. This left the Malaysian Federal government with no choice but to make another deal with Harris Salleh (who was out of favour with Tun Mustapha) to establish the political party Parti Bersatu Rakyat Jelata Sabah (BERJAYA) and try to oust Mustapha out of power. However, Harris was reluctant to become the Chief Minister of Sabah and so Fuad Stephens was asked to assume the post of Chief Minister were BERJAYA to succeed. In the 1976 Sabah State elections, Tun Mustapha was successfully ousted by BERJAYA and Stephens was installed as Chief Minister in his place. Unfortunately, Stephens did not complete his term as he, along with five other State Ministers, died in the 1976 air crash. Harris replaced Stephens, and a week later, the oil agreement was signed. With Sabah entering into the agreement, Petronas had finally achieved total control of all oil and gas reserves in Malaysia.

In 1974, the Petroleum Development Act was tabled in Parliament and then approved. Petronas (Petroliam Nasional Berhad) was incorporated on 17 August 1974. On 6 September 1974, Prime Minister Abdul Razak announced the appointment of Razaleigh as Chairman and Chief Executive of Petronas. Razak said:&quot; &quot;From among the new blood, I intended to bring Tengku Razaleigh into the Cabinet. However, I have an important job for him, a job as important as that of a Cabinet Minister. I have decided to appoint him as chairman and Chief Executive of Petronas, which is equivalent to being a Cabinet Minister.&quot;&quot; Subsequently, Razaleigh had to relinquish his job as Chairman of PERNAS which he held from 1970, but retained the chairmanship of Bank Bumiputra.

Initially, Exxon and Shell refused to surrender their concessions and negotiate with Petronas. Owing to this tough stance, Razaleigh served a notice to all foreign oil companies that after 1 April 1975, they would be operating illegally in Malaysian waters if they do not start negotiating with Petronas. After many months of discussions, foreign oil companies surrendered their concessions to Petronas.

=== Permodalan Nasional Berhad (PNB) ===
The company was founded on 17 March 1978 based on an idea from Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah, as an instrument of the Government&#x27;s New Economic Policy to promote share ownership among the Bumiputera, and to develop opportunities for deserving Bumiputera professionals to participate in the creation and management of wealth.

Today, PNB is a major investor in Bursa Malaysia, investing nearly 10% of the market capitalisation of the bourse, across most major Malaysian corporations and also actively contributing towards the nation&#x27;s human capital development through scholarships and employment opportunities.

===Setting up banking firms and other institutions===
He also set up Bank Pembangunan Malaysia and founded and established both Bank Islam and Syarikat Takaful, an insurance company run in accordance with Syariah principles.

Institute of Marketing Malaysia (IMM) was founded by Razaleigh in 1977 and he became the institute&#x27;s first Patron.

===Malaysian &amp; ASEAN Chamber of Commerce===
Razaleigh was President of the Malay Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Malaysian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and consequently the President of the ASEAN Chamber of Commerce and Industry. He played a major role in the strategic restructuring of the Malaysian economy. The Malaysian Chamber of Commerce acknowledged his expertise in the petroleum business and once called him the &quot;Malaysian Oil Prince.&quot; In the 1975 Malaysian Chamber of Commerce resolution, Razaleigh was named &quot;Father of Malaysian Economic Development.&quot;

==Political career==
===Joining UMNO===
As the former president of the Malayan Students Union in London and the secretary of the Malay Society in Britain, Razaleigh has been in politics since the early 60s. He formally joined UMNO in 1962 and was unanimously elected the chairman of UMNO&#x27;s Ulu Kelantan Division at its annual general meeting. He had returned to Malaya earlier that year to attend his father&#x27;s funeral. A few months later, Razaleigh was chosen to be a part of Malaya&#x27;s delegation to the United Nations for the 17th Session of the U.N. General Assembly in 1962. The leader of the delegation was Ismail Abdul Rahman, the then Minister of Internal Security.

Tunku Abdul Rahman was a very close friend of Razaleigh&#x27;s father as they shared similar backgrounds, both were from Royal houses. This closeness is also the result of their involvement in politics and their struggle for Malaya&#x27;s independence. The Tunku saw leadership potential in Razaleigh and after Razaleigh&#x27;s father had passed on, the Tunku sought to have him compete for a seat on the UMNO ticket. However, Razaleigh resisted the offers presented to him as he wanted to focus on his fledgling business career.

This came to a head several years later when Razaleigh finally gave in after he had learned from various quarters that the Tunku had lost patience with him for stalling. He competed in the 1969 general election and won Kelantan State Legislative Assembly seat of Ulu Kelantan Barat.

In 1971, he was elected to the UMNO Supreme Council. Besides Musa Hitam and Prof. Abdul Jalil Hassan, he was among the 7 new faces in the Supreme Council. He was later appointed the Treasurer of UMNO by then President Abdul Razak Hussein in 1973.

In the 1974 general election, Razaleigh won the Parliamentary seat of Ulu Kelantan then (now known as, Gua Musang). In 1975, he secured the second most votes for the Vice President post in the party elections and thus was one of the three VPs elected to serve a three-year term.

In 1976, after the death of Prime Minister Tun Abdul Razak, Razaleigh became the Minister of Finance. At the time, Razaleigh had gotten a reputation for being an ultra nationalist due to his hard line stance in the negotiations for Petronas&#x27; oil rights with the Americans. Eventually, Razaleigh did relinquish his positions in Petronas as he was juggling between many different jobs which prohibited him from focusing on his main role as Finance Minister.

Razaleigh&#x27;s planning is reputed to have been the main reason the Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition, of which UMNO is a major component, almost totally defeats the opposition Islamic party of Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS) in the 1978 general election and the Kelantan state elections of the same year. In an election where few observers were willing to predict the outcome, a decisive victory for UMNO in Kelantan both at the Federal and State level meant that Razaleigh had solidified his position as one of the foremost political personalities on the national stage. This was reflected in the UMNO elections that year when he garnered the most votes for the Vice President post and was reelected to another three-year term. Razaleigh&#x27;s strong position led to him being widely tipped to eventually become Prime Minister of Malaysia.

In 1981, Mahathir became prime minister. Instead of sticking to the original agreement he had made with Razaleigh, Mahathir declared an election for the Deputy Premiership to be decided through the results of the UMNO Deputy Presidency. The new prime minister announced that he would not endorse any candidate and would take a neutral stance. Razaleigh sensed that Mahathir was averse to having him as his Deputy per their earlier understanding, but welcomed this decision nonetheless. His main quibble was that this was not in accordance with tradition, as Deputy Prime Ministers are usually hand-picked by the Prime Minister. Razaleigh joined the contest, and his main opposition was Musa Hitam. Eventually, Musa won the election with 722 votes to Razaleigh&#x27;s 517, becoming the new Deputy President of UMNO and leading to his appointment as Deputy Prime Minister. Razaleigh blamed himself for taking &quot;a rather passive stance&quot; and not having a campaign strategy. Meanwhile, Mahathir had maintained Razaleigh as Finance Minister until he was made the Minister of International Trade and Industry in a 1984 cabinet reshuffle.

===Exit from UMNO and formation of Semangat 46===
Tengku Razaleigh challenged Mahathir in the 1987 UMNO leadership election, teaming up with former Deputy Prime Minister Musa Hitam, who had in the year prior resigned from Mahathir&#x27;s cabinet owing to some conflict with the Prime Minister. Mahathir&#x27;s then Deputy Prime Minister, Ghafar Baba, contested against Musa for the Deputy Presidency. This led to UMNO being split into two camps, i.e. &quot;Team A&quot; and &quot;Team B&quot; with Mahathir and Razaleigh as leaders of the respective camps. Mahathir managed to retain his party president position by a mere 43 votes and Musa lost by 40 votes. The election was held on a Friday, and coinciding with the Friday prayers, it is alleged that many used this opportunity to &quot;buy&quot; votes from delegates in order to have them cast a vote for their leader.

There were many who changed camps at the last minute, including Najib Razak who was then the leader of UMNO&#x27;s Youth Wing, who ended up endorsing Mahathir. It has also been alleged by Razaleigh&#x27;s camp that while the votes were being counted and Razaleigh was leading, a &quot;black-out&quot; had suddenly occurred whereby the room lost electricity. This was especially curious as the rooms adjacent to where the votes were being counted did not experience the same. After the electric power was back on, Razaleigh&#x27;s lead was slowly erased and Mahathir was eventually declared the winner.

This left Razaleigh and his Team B supporters unsatisfied. A few Team B leaders had claimed many party delegates were improperly elected. They eventually took UMNO to court and filed suit to overturn the election after finding discrepancies throughout the voting process. The courts found that some of the delegates that voted were ineligible and UMNO was thus declared illegal on technical grounds in 1988. Despite Mahathir&#x27;s camp blaming Razaleigh for UMNO being declared an unlawful party although Razaleigh was not among the twelve plaintiffs, he was widely believed to be funding and co-ordinating the suit. The event did not please Mahathir began making heated attacks on the judiciary and it was considered a judicial intervention of the political dispute triggering the 1988 Malaysian constitutional crisis. Mahathir immediately reconstituted UMNO as &quot;UMNO Baru&quot; (New UMNO), with only Team A members. Most of its leaders, however, were selected from Team A of the old UMNO, with Team B ignored. UMNO Baru was later announced the &quot;de facto&quot; and &quot;de jure&quot; party to succeed its predecessor, the original but &#x27;illegal&#x27; UMNO, dropping the &#x27;Baru&#x27; suffix and have the old UMNO&#x27;s assets transferred over too.

Razaleigh and his supporters which constituted Team B, had faced difficulties to register as members of Team A&#x27;s newly formed UMNO Baru. With the personal support of former UMNO prime ministers Tunku Abdul Rahman, Razaleigh who had also failed registering &quot;UMNO 46&quot; had founded a new political party called Parti Melayu Semangat 46 (S46 or Semangat 46) instead. The number 46 refers to the year the original UMNO was founded. On 3 June 1989, Semangat 46 was officially registered with the electoral college. Among notable leaders that joined Semangat 46 were including Marina Yusoff, Ilyani Ishak, Rais Yatim, Harun Idris, Suhaimi Kamaruddin, Ahmad Shabery Cheek, Othman Saat, Salleh Abas, Mohd Radzi Sheikh Ahmad, Tengku Azlan Sultan Abu Bakar and Ibrahim Ali. In 1990, Semangat 46 also formed Gagasan Rakyat (GR) and Angkatan Perpaduan Ummah (APU) opposition coalitions.

In the 1993 Malaysian constitutional crisis, Razaleigh strongly opposed the amendment for Rulers to be tried at court and their legal immunity be stripped. However, his efforts failed to bear fruit as it did not gain enough support. In 1996, Tengku Razaleigh disbanded Semangat 46 and rejoined UMNO.

===Return to UMNO===
Tengku Razaleigh return to UMNO as he has discussed earlier with Mahathir after the dissolution of Semangat 46 in 1996. Mahathir dismissed allegations that he brought Razaleigh back to check the influence of Anwar Ibrahim in the party and government.

As Anwar was sacked from UMNO in 1998, Mahathir himself brought Razaleigh back into the limelight again in June 1999 by making him the UMNO Kelantan liaison chief, a job the PM had held himself since 1987, Razaleigh could well been Mahathir&#x27;s heir apparent if he had defeated PAS and won his home state.

In 2004, he announced his interest for the UMNO top post yet again but failed to garner enough nominations to contest the presidency. In 2008, Razaleigh had again expressed his interest in becoming prime minister, hoping to replace Abdullah Ahmad Badawi. However, his movement also did not get enough traction to seriously contest against Najib Razak for the post.

On 22 July 2011, Razaleigh launched a non-Government Organisation (NGO), Angkatan Amanah Merdeka (Amanah), at Memorial Tunku Abdul Rahman to revive and restore the spirit of Merdeka among Malaysians. The aim of NGO led by Razaleigh himself, along with several other political figures and prominent activists were dubious and some have demanded it transforms to a political party and join the opposition in the coming general election.

After the 2018 general election (GE14) which see the downfall of BN federal government and Najib&#x27;s resignation as President of UMNO, Razaleigh contested the post of party president for a second time in the 2018 UMNO leadership election but lost to former Deputy Prime Minister Ahmad Zahid Hamidi in a three-corner fight along with former Youth chief Khairy Jamaluddin.

He was made the Chairman of the Advisory Council of UMNO afterwards. Razaleigh somehow had sent the resignation letter from the UMNO post dated 20 September 2021 to the party caretaker President Ahmad Zahid, expressing his dissatisfaction and disappointment of the political cooperation between UMNO and the Malaysian United Indigenous Party (BERSATU) in collaborating a failed government.

==In popular culture==
Razaleigh is one of many Malaysian politicians, celebrities, and other well-known personalities who appear in Pete Teo and Namewee&#x27;s public service announcement voter education video , released in 2011. Razaleigh provides a spoken word introduction to the rap song.

In conjunction with the 50th anniversary of the formation of Malaysia, Pete Teo released the video &quot;Hari Malaysia&quot;, featuring many public figures and well-known personalities. Razaleigh was seen sitting next to Lim Kit Siang, another Malaysian prominent political figure, in Merdeka Stadium.

==Personal life==
Razaleigh married his longtime friend, former Malaysia Airlines executive Yvonne Law, an ethnic Chinese, who changed her name to Noor Yvonne Abdullah after her conversion to Islam then. While being out of the limelight and shying away from the public, she was married to him since 9 December 1993. She died on 5 June 2015 due to multiple myeloma, a blood cancer disease she had been suffering from for the previous year.

<doc id="785242" wikidata="Q1120909" url="?curid=785242" title="CompactPCI">
<text>CompactPCI is a computer bus interconnect for industrial computers, combining a Eurocard-type connector and PCI signaling and protocols. Boards are standardized to 3U or 6U sizes, and are typically interconnected via a passive backplane. The connector pin assignments are standardized by the PICMG US and PICMG Europe organizations. The connectors and the electrical rules allow for eight boards in a PCI segment. Multiple bus segments are allowed with bridges.

Unlike the original Eurocard solutions such as VME, which use connectors with a 0.1 inch (2.54 mm) pin spacing, CompactPCI cards use metric connectors with a 2-millimeter pin spacing, designed to the IEC 1076 standard. 3U boards have a 110-pin connector (J1), which carries the 32-bit PCI bus signals, and an optional 110-pin connector (J2), which carries either user-defined I/O or the upper 32 bits of an optional 64-bit PCI bus. 6U cards have an identical J1, a J2 that is always used for 64-bit PCI, as well as J3, J4, and J5 connectors for a variety of uses either as user-defined I/O or specified signaling such as Telephony and/or Ethernet signaling. Hot-plugging is a supported feature of CompactPCI. Some of the pins are slightly longer to provide proper grounding when devices are inserted and removed.

The backplanes can be designed for 3.3 V VIO or 5 V VIO operation. These are differentiated by having &#x27;Cadmium Yellow&#x27; coloured key for 3.3V or &#x27;Brilliant Blue&#x27; colour for 5V operation. If the CompactPCI card operates on a particular VIO voltage the card shall have the respective coloured coding key. If the card is compatible with both voltages then it may not have any coding key. The image above illustrates a 5 V VIO 8-slot backplane.

CompactPCI was initially ratified as PICMG 2.0 in late 1995 as a passive backplane for PCI signaling. The 2.x series of specifications from PICMG provide support for a variety of technologies including Hot Swap (PICMG 2.1), Telephony signaling (PICMG 2.5) and most notably the expansion of the architecture to include switched Ethernet (PICMG 2.16).

Originally designed to support the PCI signaling protocol (and hence the name &quot;CompactPCI&quot;), CompactPCI has grown to include a variety of technologies centered on the application of the 2mm HM connector on the 3U and 6U form factor. In fact many systems are implemented with no PCI bus on the backplane, such as those implemented with switched Ethernet board interconnection (PICMG 2.16).

A drawback of the design is that the signal pins can become bent when a new device is inserted.

Related standards include CompactPCI Express and CompactPXI, which follow a similar concept, but substitute the protocols and signaling of PCI Express and PXI respectively.

The abbreviations cPCI, CPCI, cPCIe, and CPCIe are colloquial terms and are not officially used by PICMG.

<text>Conductor (Cdr) is an appointment held by a few selected warrant officers class 1 in the Royal Logistic Corps and is one of the most senior appointments that can be held by a warrant officer in the British Army. Previously conductor was the most senior warrant officer appointment, but it was outranked with the creation of the Army Sergeant Major appointment in 2015 following Army reforms. The appointment was also reintroduced into the Royal Australian Army Ordnance Corps for selected warrant officers class 1 in 2005.

==History==

The first known mention of conductors is in the 1327 Statute of Westminster, when they are mentioned as the men whose job it was to conduct soldiers to places of assembly. The &quot;Conductor of Ordnance&quot; is mentioned in the records of the siege of Boulogne in 1544 and conductors are mentioned several times in surviving records from the 17th century. In 1776 they are described in Thomas Simes&#x27;s book &quot;The Military Guide for Young Officers&quot; as assistants to the Commissary of Stores; and they were equivalent to non-commissioned officers in the Board of Ordnance Field Train Department from its establishment in 1792. The Land Transport Corps and the Military Store Department of the 19th century both included conductors on their strength.

On 11 January 1879, a Royal Warrant established conductors of supplies (in the Army Service Corps) and conductors of stores (in the Ordnance Store Branch) as warrant officers, ranking above all non-commissioned officers. In 1892, conductors of supplies were renamed staff sergeant majors 1st class, but conductors of stores remained in what in 1896 became the Army Ordnance Corps. Staff sergeant majors in the new corps were renamed sub-conductors. In February 1915, with the general introduction of warrant officers throughout the army, conductors and sub-conductors became warrant officers class I. Sub-conductors reverted to the appointment of staff sergeant major in 1967, but the appointment of conductor passed to the new Royal Logistic Corps in 1993.

The appointment lapsed in the Australian Army in the late 1940s, but was reintroduced in July 2005. The first six conductors were appointed in April 2006.

The appointment of conductor was used in the New Zealand Army up to the 1930s. It then lapsed, to be introduced back into the New Zealand Army in 1977, with he proviso that a maximum of five conductors could be appointed at any one time. The appointment of conductor was discontinued with the amalgamation of the Royal New Zealand Army Ordnance Corps into the Royal New Zealand Army Logistic Regiment on its establishment in 1996.

Conductors and sub-conductors also existed in the British Indian Army as appointments held by British warrant officers. The Indian Army, however, never adopted the rank of warrant officer class I, and conductor or sub-conductor was, therefore, the only title they used.

==Contemporary==

The appointment may now be held by WO1s in any RLC trade, including transport, catering, pioneer, ammunition technician, petroleum operator and postal warrant officers, as well as the original suppliers.

Prospective conductors must have held the rank of WO1 for at least one year (reduced from three years in 2006). They may not be currently serving as regimental sergeant majors (that is, they must be staff sergeant majors). Since 2009, no more than eight serving WO1s of the RLC at any one time may hold the appointment of conductor; before then it was no more than 10% of the WO1s of the RLC (excluding RSMs). Since 2001, conductors have received their warrant of appointment on a parchment scroll.

==Insignia==

From 11 July 1900, conductors were authorised to wear a crown within a laurel wreath on their lower sleeve and sub-conductors a crown, although they did not start actually wearing these until 1901 and 1904 respectively. In 1915, conductors were authorised a crown in a laurel wreath and sub-conductors the royal coat of arms. In 1918, conductors began wearing the royal arms in a laurel wreath, still their badge of rank, and sub-conductors the royal arms alone. Like other WO1s, conductors wear Sam Browne belts.

==Victoria Crosses and George Cross==

Two conductors of the Bengal Ordnance Department won the Victoria Cross during the Indian Mutiny. John Buckley won it at Delhi on 11 May 1857 and James Miller at Futtepore on 28 October 1857.

A former conductor of the Royal Logistic Corps, Captain Peter Norton, won the George Cross near Baghdad on 24 July 2005.
